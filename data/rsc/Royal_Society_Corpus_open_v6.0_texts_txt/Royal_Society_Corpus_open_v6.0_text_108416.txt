Introductory Remarks .
IN the month of December last I visited the Lake District , chiefly with the view of ascertaining approximately , the heights above the sea of some of the mountain gauges which I have hitherto been obliged to estimate .
The heights of these stations were taken by means of an excellent aneroid barometer ( previously compared with a standard ) , and a standard barometer read simultaneously , or nearly so , at the sealevel .
By this method I found the height of Cockermouth above the sea to be 127 feet , Keswick 253 feet ( Crosthwaite 258 feet ) , Bassenthwaite Lake and Lowdore ( measured from Keswick ) 214 and 224 feet respectively ; Seathwaite ( mean of two observations calculated from Lowdore ) 368 feet ; from Wastdale I-ead , 399 feet ; and taken direct from the sea-level , 389 feet .
I find the summit of Seatollar Common to be about 1590 feet , and the gauge 1388 feet above the sea , assuming the elevation of Seathwaite to be 368 feet ; the gauge on Sprinkling Fell or the Sty , 948 feet , measured from Wastdale , and 936 feet by a simultaneous barometrical reading at the coast .
Two distinct observations taken on the 16th and 17th of December , show the gauge near the top of Sty Head Pass to be 1443 and 1448 feet above the sea respectively , supposing the height of Wastdale Head village to be 247 feet .
Mr. OTLEY states the summit of the Pass to be 1250 feet above the valley , or , taking Wastdale Head at 247 feet , 1497 feet above the sea ; and an observation of Dr. DALTON'S from the same base , gives 1506 feet , both of which correspond very nearly with my own results , as the gauge is somewhat below the highest part of the road leading over the Pass .
I have hitherto stated the height of this station to be 1250 feet , but it appears I have misinterpreted my authority ( Mr. OTLEY ) , whose calculation represents the height above the valley , not above the sea .
The gauges on Brant Rigg and on Lingmell appear to be 924 and 1778 feet respectively above the sea .
At the latter station , the barometer fell to 27'00 in .
, while in the valley it stood at 28'67 in .
, and at Whitehaven at 28'86 in .
Temperature in the valley 48 ?
; at 1778 feet , 32 ?
'8 , wet bulb 32 ?
'2 , heavy rain falling .
I was prevented from ascending to any of the higher stations by the unfavourable state of the weather ; indeed the barometrical observation at Brant Rigg , and also a second reading on Sty Head were taken at night , after having been confined to the valley the whole of the day by torrents of rain ; I have consequently not had an opportunity of ascertaining the altitude of Sprinkling Tarn , but in 1812 Dr. DALTON states it to be 1860 feet ; and another observation , either by DALTON or OTLEY , gives 1943 feet above the sea .
I have therefore allowed the elevation of 1900 feet , previously given in my tables , to remain unaltered for the present .
A complete and authentic table of the heights of our principal lakes and mountains is much wanted .
Of the elevations given in the Guide Books to the Lake District , some are probably not far from the truth , but others are undoubtedly very erroneous ; thus , Ennerdale Lake , by the Whitehaven Waterworks ' Survey , proves to be 356 feet above the sea , instead of 246 feet , as stated in one of these treatises , showing an error or miscalculation of 110 feet .
This is , no doubt , an extreme instance ; but the altitudes of several of our lakes and mountains are yet unknown ; and a careful measurement or remeasurement of the whole of them with accurate instruments and under favourable circumstances , is very desirable , as the results would be more or less interesting and valuable both to the meteorologist and the geologist , the botanist and the tourist .

Considerable delay took place before the instruments were adjusted , and the rlegistrar did not receive them again till the mniddle of December .
From about the middleof August till the 17th of December , the maxilmum was obtained by frequent examination of the spirit thermometer in the course of the day ; the mean of the maximumt for 1850 is in consequence about 10 ?
5 too low .
The mercurial thermometer , prior to its getting out of order , was considered to be nearly freefrom index error , and the night thermometer has been compared with it throughout the scale , and reduced to the mercurial as a standard .

The fall of rain throughout the Lake District in 1850 , is slightly above the average of the six preceding years .
At Seathwaite , the depth is 1'77 inch over the average of this period .
The largest daily falls in 1850 , at the three principal stations , are grouped as under : Wastdale .

038 ; mean of maximum , 52 ?
032 ; mean of minimum , 42 ?
'43 .
At Whitehaven , on the west coast , seventeen miles distant in a direct line , bearing W.N.W. from Seathwaite , the mean of the maximum for the same period is 54 ?
.18 ; mean of minimum , 44 ?
'25 ; average mean temperature , 49 ?
'22 .
The mean difference between the two places is , in the maximum , 10 ?
86 ; in the minimum , 10 ?
82 , and in the mean 1 ?
'84 , the temperature at Whitehaven being higher than at Seathwaite by these quantities .
The mean temperature at Whitehaven from eighteen years ' observations is 490 ; at Greenwich , the mean for seventy-eight years is 48 ?
'3 ; and at Somerset House for sixty-nine years , 49 ?
'5 .
The radiation of heat from the earth 's surface at night , as indicated by self-registering thetrmometers fully exposed to the sky on grass , appears on the whole to be greater in the mountain valleys than at the coast , and particularly in summer ; but , occasionally in the winter months , the results are strangely and unaccountably anomalous .
Thus , in November 1850 , the mean amount or effect indicated was only 0 ?
090 , and in December the mean reading of the therrnometer on the grass was identical with that at 4 feet above the surface .
At Whitehaven , the amount in those months was 5 ?
'25 and 5 ?
'86 .
Yet the same instrument ( which has been in use at Seathwaite since 1846 ) in nearly all the other months of 1850 , shows a greater extent of radiation than at Whitehaven .
Results almost equally abnormal were presented in the winter of 1846 and 1847 , and as such they were omitted fiorom the Tables for that year* .
I have examined the thermometer employed at Seathwaite for indicating the direct effect of terrestrial radiation ; the column is perfect , and I am satisfied it has no material index error , and that it is correctly read off ; moreover , it is exposed in the same place throughout the year .
The cause of its occasional anomalous indications in the winter months must therefore be left unexplained for the present .
The Mountain Gauges.-The phenomena exhibited by the mountain gauges in the year 1850 , do not seem to call for any particular comment , as the results are very generally in accordance with the deductions embodied in former papers which have appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society ; and at the present time I am more anxious to eliminate new facts and to accumulate a mass of accurate observations and well-digested Iesults made and obtained both in normal and abnormal seasons and under various modifying circumstances , than to theorize upon or draw from them inferences or conclusions which extended experience may modify , contradict or destroy .
The following Table shows the excess or deficiency per cent. of the principal mountain gauges over or under the quantity of rain received by the adjacent valley of Wastdale , both in the summer and winter months , in each year since the instruments were erected in 1846 .
The positive sign signifies that the quantity is greater , and the negative sign that it is less than the fall in the valley in the same period .

40'5 -21-3 36'5 + 7'7 1'7 -171 The remarkable deficiency in the per-centage of rain both in the summer and winter months of 1849 , is accounted for by the abnormal and relatively excessive fall of rain in the Vale of Wastdale in that year , as explained in my last report on the meteorology of the Lake District .
The increase in the per-centage in the winter months of 1850 is doubtless attributable to the fact of the deposition being almost entirely in the form of rain , the fall of snow on the mountains having been unusually small both in the early and latter months of the past year .
The most interesting and important circumstance connected with the experiments in 1850 , is the discovery of a mountain station which promises to yield nearly onethird more rain than the celebrated hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale , hitherto , and with good reason , considered to be the wettest spot in Great Britain .
The new station is about a mile and a half distant from Seathwaite in a south-westerly direction , and 580 feet above it , or 948 feet above the sea-level , at the extreme southern termination of the valley ; it is on the shoulder of Sprinkling Fell or the Sty , about 100 yards south of the road leading over the Sty Pass to Wastdale .
The actual quantity of water measured on Sprinkling Fell in eleven months of 1850 , is 174'33 inches ; but the receiver was found running over on four different occasions , by which I calculate 5 or 6 inchles at least must have been lost to the instrument ; hence , if we add 5-67 inches for overflow , and 9'49 inches for the computed depth in January ( 7'34 inches at Seathwaite ) , the result is 189'49 inches for the fall on the Sty in 1850 , with 143^96 inches at Seathwaite* .
The wettest year since the commencement of the experiments is 1848 , when 160*89 inches fell at Seathwaite ; and , computing the fall at the new station for that year in the same proportion which the two localities bear to each other in 1850 , we have 211 '62 inches for the depth of rain on the Sty in 1848 .
An inspection of the following Table , which exhibits the fall at the coast during the last eighteen years , will show that the period ( 1844-50 ) over which the Lake District gauges have been in operation , has been far from a wet one .

, i , ... ... w ir -- , At Whitehaven , the average annual fall fromtl 1844 to 1850 inclusive , is 43 543 inches ; but in the eleven years preceding 1844 , the average is 48'53 inches ; and the average of the last eighteen years , from 1833 to 1850 inclusive , is 46-58 inches .
And if we analyse the period of seven years comprehended between 1844 and 1850 , we find that only three of those years have exceeded the average ; while of the remaining four , one year is characterized by drought , and the other three by unusual dryness .
Even in the year 1848 , when 161 inches fell at Seathwaite , the depth at Whitehaven was only 47*34 inches , or -3ths of an inch above the average of eighteen years ; whilst in 1835 , the fall was 54'13 inches ; if 1836 , 58'97 inches ; and in 1841 , 55'97 inches .
It is not pretended that the gradation in quantity between Seathwaite and Whitehaven in any particular year will be the same in other single years , or that the differential mean of one term of vears will correspond precisely with that of other terms of equal length , although I conceive that the proportion found to obtain for a group of ten consecutive years , will never be very widely departed from in future decennial periods ; but we may , at least , fairly assume that a wet or a dry season at either station will bear a similat character at the other ; and sufficient evidence has been adduced to show that the mean annual fall of rain in the Lake District has yet .
to be determined , by the incorporation of a future tern of wet years with the comparatively dry period already on record .
And this remark applies with still greater force to the maximum fall , as , judging from the records kept at the coast during eighteen years , no one of the last seven , during which the Lake District gauges have been in action , has any pretension to a character for excessive wetness .
Hence , the maximum annual depth in the mountain district of Cumberland may far exceed the computed fall of 211 inches at the Sty in 1848 , enormous and almost incredible as is the quantity for a climate situated in the heart of the temperate zone .
I may observe that the fall of rain at the coast in one year is rigidly comparable with any other year ; the gauge having been in the same spot , or at least within a few feet of it , from the year 1832 up to the present time .
Moreover , the same gauge and the same glass metre ( graduated to the -ol-th part of an inch ) have been used from the first ; and the rain has been read off daily throughout the period .
In my paper printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1848 ( Part I[ .
) , allusion was made to the difference in the receipts of rain gauges within 100 yards of each other , when placed near the head of a valley .
A still more remarkable instance is presented in the past year , but in this case the gauge is considerably elevated above the valley .
On the 31st of August 1849 , the gauge on Seatollar Common , 1338 feet above the sea , was removed 90 yards to the south-westward , nearly in a direct line , the difference in height between the old and new station being only 5 feet .
