Influence of Temperature upon Electrotonic .
383 material , like clouds of water on the earth , but in view of the high solar temperature it seems improbable that any body , except , perhaps , carbon , could exist in any condition other than the gaseous state in the solar atmosphere ; so that it seems more probable that sun-spots are due , at least partly , to reflection by convection streams of gas , rather than by clouds of transparent solid or liquid particles .
.\#171 ; Influence of Alterations of Temperature upon the Electro-tonic Currents of Medullated Nerve."* By AUGUSTUS D. Waller , M.D. , F.R.S. Received December 14 , \#151 ; Read December 17 , 1896 .
( Abstract .
) The effects of a rise of temperature upon electrotonic currents may be briefly stated as follows:\#151 ; 1 .
The ordinary electrotonic currents , A and K , are temporarily diminished or abolished at about 40 ' .
2 .
At about 30 ' of a rising temperature the K current is increased without notable alteration or with actual diminution of the A current .
3 .
On returning from 40 ' towards the normal ( 15 ' + 2 ' ) temperature , the A and K currents reappear .
K is increased and A is diminished , so that the previous normal inequality A \gt ; K is diminished , or actually reversed to A \lt ; K. In all cases the quotient A/ K is diminished ; in some cases it actually falls below unity .
[ The negative variation is temporarily abolished at about 40 ' ; a positive gives place to a negative variation in consequence of a raised temperature to 40 ' .
] The above three statements are illustrated by Experiments 2366 , 2322 , and , from the examination of their records , it will be clear that there is here no question of the effects being due to alterations .of resistance .
A and K are tested for alternately , and the deflection by 0'001 volt is taken at intervals of about ten minutes .
[ Other .examples of a similar character are given in the ' Proceedings of the Physiological Society ' for November , 1896 , and a record of temporary diminution of the negative variation is given in fig. 12 .(Experiment 777 ) , ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1897 .
] * In all the experiments referred to in this communication , the polarising current is by one Leclanche cell ( the resistance in its circuit being about 100,000 .ohms ) .
The nerve lies upon four unpolarisable electrodes fixed at intervals of 12 mm. , serving as leading-in electrodes to the polarising current and leading-out .electrodes to the electrotonic current .
On the galvanometer records , the anelectro-tonic deflection A reads upwards , the katelectrotonic deflection K reads downwards ; after-anelectrotonic and after-katelectrotonic deflections A ' and K ' read respectively downwards and upwards ( there being under the conditions of experiment no marked homodromous after-katelectrotonic deflection ) .

Dr. A. D. Waller .
Influence of Alterations of Electrotonic after-currents , A ' and K ' , when present to any marked degree , are opposed to the previous electrotonic currents A and K. Designating A and K respectively as positive and negative , the after-currents A ' and K ' are respectively negative and positive .
Such after-currents are in general modified by previous rise of temperature , which gives rise to an evident A ' ( negative ) in a nerve which previously gave no marked A ' , and abolishes a K ' ( positive ) that may previously have been present .
Experiment 2366 exhibits the development of an evident negative A ' subsequent to heating of the nerve .
Experiment 2322 exhibits the abolition of a positive K ' , evident previous to heating of the nerve .
A fall of temperature causes an increase of the A current and , in less degree , of the K current ; by reason of the diminution of resistance that takes place with lowered temperature , the increase of A is more marked than is apparent upon the record , and the smaller increase of K is quite masked by the diminution of resistance .
The quotient A/ K is augmented .
At a temperature of \#151 ; 4 ' to \#151 ; 6 ' both currents are somewhat suddenly abolished ; this abolition may be complete and final , no recovery taking place , or it may be temporary , being succeeded by imperfect recovery as the nerve temperature returns towards normal .
It is noteworthy that the A and K currents are not abolished at 0 ' suddenly , and all but finally abolished at \#151 ; 4 ' Temperature upon Electrotoniv Currents .
387 _(j0^ probably by reason of the nerve having been frozen at this temperature and thus cut to pieces .
It is evident that little stress is to be laid upon an apparent decrease of K with falling temperature ( 2417 ) and increase of K with rising temperature ( 2366 ) .
On the other hand , a diminished A. with rising temperature ( 2366 ) and an increased A. with falling temperature ( 2417 ) are not open to doubt .

In other words , the anodic or acidic polarisation is favoured by base , disfavoured by acid ; the kathodic or basic polarisation is favoured by acid , disfavoured by base .
Anaesthetics ( C02 ; Et20 ; CH013 ) act like acids and like rise of temperature , causing , at certain strengths , a greater relative diminution of A than of K , and therefore a diminution of the quotient A/ K\#151 ; temporary in the case of C02 and Et20 , permanent in the case of CHC1S .
In the weakest dilution that will produce any effect at all there may be increase of A , no increase , or a relatively smaller increase , of K , and therefore increase of the quotient A/ K. These effects are , however* at present under examination , and will form the subject of a future communication .
The tabular summary ( p. 391 ) will at this juncture be sufficient to enable a comparison to be made between the effects of heat and cold and those of acids and alkalies .

In the month of April of , this year , we had the honour to submit to the Royal Society* a preliminary notice of the evidence we had obtained of the existence of gallium in the Yorkshire ironstone smelted at Middlesbrough-on-Tees .
We propose now to give a concise but detailed account of the methods of analysis carried out on the metaland the ore , and the determination of the quantity of gallium present .

Method of Analysis.\#151 ; The very large proportion of iron rendered the application of some special method of analysis necessary for the separation of metals present in minute proportions , and for the qualitative and quantitative examinations of the separated substances .
We have successfully employed fractional precipitations and the spectrographic analysis of the precipitates , supplemented by gravimetric determinations of the purified gallium sesquioxide .
