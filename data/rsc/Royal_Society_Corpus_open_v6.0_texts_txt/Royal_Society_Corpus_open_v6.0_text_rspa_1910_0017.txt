) The present instalment of my experiments on this subject refers to .the minerals of igneous rocks .
A word of preface is necessary as to the interpretation of results obtained from these .
An igneous magma , at the time of consolidation , contains large quantities of gases : the liquid carbonic acid which may be seen in the cavities of granitic quartz is a proof of this , as is also the copious emission of water vapour from consolidating lava streams .
We are for the most part ignorant of the history of rock magmas previous to their intrusion into their present position among the strata , and consolidation there ; consequently , it is impossible to say whether any helium which may be found in the consolidated rock as a whole was generated since the consolidation , or whether it partly represents what was entangled or dissolved in the molten magma previous to consolidation ; for there is no doubt that helium was being generated in the molten just as in the consolidated material .
All the evidence goes to show that the rate of radio-active change is nearly if not quite independent of the physical conditions in which the radio-active matter may happen to be , and of its state of chemical combination .
We may evade the difficulty by concentrating attention on those constituent minerals of the rock which are exceptionally radio-active .
These , although they may in some sense have been present in the magma , in solution , must at that time have added the helium they were generating to the common stock of the magma as a whole .
It is only since they separated in the solid form that they can have begun to accumulate within themselves a store of helium greatly more concentrated than that present in the rock mass generally .
Minerals like zircon and sphene , containing hundreds of times as much helium as the average of the rock of which they are constituents , may accordingly be regarded as having generated the whole of their supply since consolidation .
The geological age of igneous rocks is of course more difficult to ascertain than that of sedimentary ones , and can often only be assigned vaguely .
Specimens of zircon can , however , be obtained from rocks belonging to several well defined epochs .
In particular , the tertiary volcanic rocks of Europe afford three separate occurrences of this mineral , and these are The Accumulation of Helium in Geological Time .
299 widely separated in time from any of the older specimens ; for the secondary epoch affords few examples of igneous rocks of any kind ; and I have not been able to learn of the occurrence of zircons in any of them .
Zircon is a very refractory material , and difficulty was experienced in devising a convenient means of decomposing it so as to extract the contained helium quantitatively .
Eventually the following method was found very satisfactory .
The powdered mineral is mixed with two or three times its weight of fused and powdered borax , and heated in a platinum boat contained in a quartz tube .
After a few minutes at a bright red heat the zircon is completely dissolved , and all helium evolved .
Enough water vapour is evolved from the molten mass to ensure a wash-out of all helium .
If the fusion were carried out in a vacuum it would be difficult to prevent frothing .
Accordingly the tube is filled with oxygen , which is subsequently pumped out and absorbed with phosphorus .
There is a slight escape of helium through the walls of the hot quartz tube , but it is too small to be of importance under the conditions of these experiments .
The table gives my results for this one particular mineral , zircon .
The notation is the same as that employed in my previous paper , * but for convenience may be explained again here .
The generation of helium is due partly to uranium with its series of products , and partly to thorium with its series .
One gramme of thoria is assumed equivalent to 0*203 gramme of uranium oxide ( UsOg ) , each with its line of descendants ; and the uranium oxide + 0*203 time the thoria is referred to as the total equivalent quantity of uranium oxide .
The ratio of the helium to this in the last column ( cubic centimetres per gramme ) measures the age , supposing all the helium retained , or otherwise sets an inferior limit to it .
Each unit in the helium ratio probably indicates about 11 million years , but this will be fixed more definitely later .
It cannot , I think , be doubted by anyone who studies this table that the helium ratio of zircon , as determined experimentally , stands in very close relation to the geological age of the specimen .
Four specimens out of the large number examined belong to the younger rocks , and these show , without exception , a ratio far lower than is ever encountered in specimens of this mineral from the older rocks .
Again , the specimens from the archsean rocks of Canada , which may be regarded as in all probability the oldest in my list , show the highest ratio of all .
I feel some satisfaction in being able to bring these results before the Society , as they have only been obtained after many comparatively unsuccessful efforts with other materials .

] Helium in Geological Time .
The phosphates with which some of my previous attempts have been made differ so much in their power of retaining helium that their time relation is obscured .
The same applies to the limestones , and , in a less measure , to the iron ores .
Zircon , on the other hand , is always hard and compact , crystallising , as it does , from a molten magma , and its structure may be regarded as comparatively uniform .
In this connection , the question will inevitably present itself , whether the helium found in the zircons represents the whole , or nearly the whole , of what they have generated .
In view of the enormous lengths of time indicated for the most ancient zircons , there is a temptation to conclude that it does .
Nevertheless , I cannot think that there is any sufficient ground for this conclusion .
The results are equally consistent with the view that a fraction only has been retained in each case .
This fraction must be supposed fairly definite , depending on the structure of zircon , which is the same for all .
The chronological relation would not , in that case , be obscured by loss of the gas .
Many other data on the minerals of igneous rocks have been obtained , but , for the moment , I confine myself to the above .
Summary of Conclusions .
Zircons generally similar in composition and quantity of radio-active matter occur in rocks of various geological ages .
The ratio of the amount of helium to the amount of radio-active matter contained stands in unmistakable connection with the age .
Absolute values for this ratio are given , which will enable a minimum in years to be accurately set to the age .
\_Note added January 20,1910.\#151 ; Since writing the above I have learned that the large zircons found embedded in lavas ( Nos. 2 , 3 , and 4 in the table ) are regarded by petrologists as having been derived from granites , or other ancient rocks , which have come in contact with the lava and have been melted down .
The zircons are believed to have survived this action by virtue of their refractory nature .
The general conclusions of the above paper will not be much affected if this view of the origin of the zircons in lavas is taken .
A temperature sufficient to melt down granite will not have failed to drive off most of the contained helium .
It may perhaps be doubted whether it would expel quite the whole .
For this reason 1 should be unwilling to draw positive conclusions as to the time which has elapsed since the consolidation of rocks containing such zircons .
