Introduction .
The Forest of Dean lies in a somewhat out-of the-way corner of Gloucestershire , West of the Severn , and is bounded on the North-west by Herefordshire , and on the West and South by Monmouthshire and the Wye .
The nearest coalfield is to the North , where a small area of Upper Carboniferous rocks occurs at Newent , also in Gloucestershire .
The Bristol and Badstock coalfields lie some little distance to the South , and still further to the West is the great basin of South Wales .
The Forest of Dean is remarkable for the simplicity of the structure of the Carboniferous area .
As is well known , the basin is the most symmetrical in England , the beds , very little disturbed by faulting or folding , having , for the most part , a very regular outerop .
From the mining point of view , the entire absence of fire-damp and the consequent use of naked lights below ground , as is also the case in the Badstock coalfield , is remarkable .
The Coal Measures , which occupy an area of about 16,700 acres , overlie beds which have long been spoken of as Millstone Grits , and these , with the Carboniferous Limestone , form the elevated rim of the field , except for a short distance in the South-east , YOL .

where the Coal Measures overstep both the so-called Millstone Grits and the Carboniferous Limestone ( see p. 269 ) .
The latter has a much less regular distribution than the " Millstone Grits , " and a considerable development of the Limestone series is found to the North and West of the Forest , and this is continuous with a long tongue of Lower Carboniferous stretching South to Chepstow , and then South-west in the direction of Newport .
It is only proposed to discuss here the general geology of the Forest , # in so far as may be necessary in connection with the study of the distribution of the fossil plants in the Upper Carboniferous rocks of the area .
It may be pointed out , however , that this was one of the earliest of British coalfields to be described geologically , and that our present knowledge rests mainly on the memoirs of Buckland and Conybeare , !
published in 1824 , of MaclaughlanJ in 1840 , and especially on that of de la Beche , S which appeared in 1846 .
Geological maps of the Forest are included in the two first-mentioned papers , and the 1-inch Geological Survey Maps ( XLIII S. W. and XLIII S.E. and also a small part of XXXV ) were published about 1855 , or perhaps earlier .
Sopwith , in 1835 , published a series of 16 engraved plans of the coal seams and iron mines , and a large and well-known model of the coalfield was also made by him in 1841 .
Examples of this model may be seen at the Jermyn Street Museum , and at the Sedgwick Museum , Cambridge .
So far as I am aware , the district has not been surveyed more recently , nor have the Upper Carboniferous rocks since attracted any special attention .
The most important of the more recent notices of the beds in the Forest is that by Hoskold , || published in 1892 .
Other brief mentions have also been made by Buckman,1[ Nicholls , ## BiNKS , tt Moore , Thompson , SS and Bichardson.|||| The Upper Carboniferous rocks fall naturally into a higher , productive series , and a lower , unproductive series .
It will be necessary here to consider the succession in each case .
That of the productive series , from which the plants described here have been obtained , is shown in the following table .
These beds fall naturally into three divisions , in accordance with the relation of the * The Forest of Dean has long been the property of the Crown , in whom the mining rights are also vested .
Nearly the whole of the area occupied by Carboniferous rocks is as densely forested to-day as it has been for many centuries past .

THE FOREST OF DEAN COALFIELD ( GLOUCESTERSHIRE ) .
235 outerops of the seams .
The highest , or First Division , contains two seams , the Upper and Lower Woorgreens coals , and these lie isolated in the centre of the basin , and are separated by 348 feet of barren strata from the coals of the Second Division .
The lattfir consists of a group of eight , closely associated seams ( 208 feet of strata in all ) , the outerops of which are very regular , and parallel to one another .
The Third Division consists of six coals , more widely separated , and with outerops more irregular and less nearly parallel than those of the Second Division .
This division is 833 feet in thickness , and is separated by 42 feet of barren rock from the Second Division .
It rests directly upon the " Millstone Grits , " except in one small portion of the field .
The names of the seams are shown in the following table :\#151 ; Diagrammatic Vertical Section of the Upper Carboniferous Rocks of the Forest of Dean.* ( Not to Scale .

THE FOREST OF DEAN COALFIELD ( GLOUCESTERSHIRE ) .
Coleford High Delph Coal .
Trenchard Coal.* As will be seen from this table , the associated rocks of the seams of the First and Second Divisions ' are essentially argillaceous , and in them plant remains are abundant .
As we pass downwards , however , through the Third Division , and especially below the Yorkley Coal , the arenaceous beds increase in importance , and not only form the roofs of the lowest coals , but by far the greater part of the thickness of the sediments separating the seams , while argillaceous beds are of very rare occurrence .
Consequently fossil plants are much more difficult to obtain from this division than from beds higher in the series .
With the help of some of my pupils at Cambridge , I have spent some time in the Forest during each of the last five years in forming as complete a collection of fossil plants as possible from this coalfield .
It has been found that specimens can be obtained from each of the three divisions .
The coals of the First Division are only worked at Woorgreens Colliery , but since this pit does not mine those of the Second Division , the origin of the specimens to be obtained at the waste heap there is accurately fixed .
All the larger collieries in the Forest , such as Trafalgar , Foxe 's Bridge , New Fancy , Lightmoor , and Crump Meadow , work the coals of the Second Division , but not those of the first or third .
Several seams , usually four or more , the exact number and identity varying in different cases , are worked at each colliery .
Owing to the thinness of the seams , enormous quantities of the rocks between them have to be brought to the surface , and are thrown on vast and high waste-heaps .
The sandstones and shales there are of course very much mixed , and it is naturally impossible to correlate them with the coals with which they were originally associated .
For this reason the coals and the intervening rocks of the Second Division are here treated as if they formed one vast seam , and since they are naturally closely associated , this is a satisfactory way of dealing with the difficulty , for the present purpose .
The Third Division is very disappointing as a collecting ground for fossil plants , * Total thickness of the Productive Series ( to base of Trenchard Coal ) , 1509 feet .
Third Division 833 feet contd .
Grey rock , etc. 44 yards 3 feet " Millstone Grits " ?
600 feet owing to the predominance of arenaceous sediments .
Fortunately the Yorkley Seam has a shale roof , and still more fortunately , from a collector 's point of view , this seam is worked alone at two pits , Park Gutter and Flour Mill , belonging to the Princess Boyal Colliery Company .
The waste heap of Park Gutter pit has yielded many excellent specimens , which give us a good idea of the flora of the higher beds of the Third Division .
I have spent a great deal of time to no purpose in trying to obtain fossil plants from the Coleford High Delph and Trenchard , the two lowest seams , at different workings .
The roof always proved to be a coarse sandstone , without any indications of plant remains .
Fortunately , however , Mr. John Morris , the Manager of Lydbrook Colliery , which works the former coal , very kindly interested himself in this matter .
When , in April , 1909 , the unexpected event occurred , almost unheard of previously in the Forest , of a bed of shale of very limited extent being discovered above the seam , he very kindly communicated with me , and saved as much as possible of the material , from which I was able to unearth a number of species of interest .
These remain the only well-preserved specimens I have been able to obtain from the Coleford High Delph coal .
I would express my sincere thanks to Mr. Morris for his valuable services in this and other matters .
I would also here record my thanks to many who have assisted me in the field .
I am especially indebted to my friend Mr. D. C. Lillie , B.A. , of St. John 's College , Cambridge , now Biologist to Captain Scott 's Expedition in the Antarctic , who has accompanied me on three of my visits to the Forest , and has entered most enthusiastically into the laborious work of collecting the specimens .
Mr. M. P. Price , B.A. , and Mr. W. B. Price , B.A. , both of Trinity College , have also rendered me much assistance by placing their special knowledge of the Forest and of the collieries at my disposal , which has been of great value .
Mr. Lillie and Mr. W. B. Price have also very kindly presented the specimens which they personally collected to the Sedgwick Museum , Cambridge .
I also gratefully acknowledge the help and influence of Mr. W. Forster Brown , the Deputy Cavelier of the Forest , who , through the Chief Clerk of the Crown Office at Coleford , Mr. T. A. Llewellyn , has aided my work in many directions .
I would especially express my thanks to Mr. Llewellyn for the constant kindness and courtesy which I have received at his hands , and for the personal trouble he has taken to aid this work .
To the Managers of the various collieries , and especially to Mr. Frank Brain of the Trafalgar , and to Mr. C. Cooke of the Princess Boyal Collieries , I return my thanks for permission to collect at the collieries , and for the kindness and sympathy which they invariably extended to me during my visits to the Forest .
I have also to acknowledge my indebtedness for grants from the Boyal Society Government Grant Committee , whereby part of the expenses of the field work were defrayed .

Previous Records .
It has been known for nearly a hundred years past that well-preserved plant remains occur in the Upper Carboniferous rocks of the Forest of Dean .
There is no evidence , however , that any attempt has been made hitherto to undertake a thorough examination of the fossil flora of this coalfield , or to examine the vertical distribution of the plants in detail .
Excellent specimens from the Forest are to be found in many collections , notably those in the Sedgwick Museum ( Cambridge ) , the Natural History Museum , and the Jermyn Street Museum .
Few , if any , of these examples , however , are accompanied by labels stating the exact locality , with the seam or division , from which they were derived , and thus they are of comparatively little value as evidence of the distribution of the flora in this coalfield .
The earliest figured specimens from the Forest are those described by Lindley and Hutton* as Hippurites longifolia , and now known by the name Ccdamocladus equisetiformis ( Schloth .
) .
In none of the earlier descriptions of the coalfield are any fossil plants mentioned by name .
In 1858 , however , NiCHOLLsf included , in his description of the Forest , a list of 33 species drawn up by Mr. H. Gibbs .
This was no doubt an amateur 's effort to further a knowledge of this flora , and a number of the species were , as we should expect , wrongly determined , and thus the list at the present day is of little interest or value .
Among the plants recorded , no doubt correctly , are those known as :\#151 ; Calamocladus equisetiformis ( Schloth .
) .
Annulariaradiata Brongn .
Lepidodendron dichotomum Sternb .
Neuropteris macrophyllaBrongn .
Pecopteris miltoni ( Artis .
) .
Pecopterisarborescens ( Schloth .
) .
Pecopteris ( .Dactylotheca ) ( Artis .
) .
In 1886 Kidston| recorded from this coalfield the following species , which are preserved in the British Museum ( Natural History ) collection .
I have added their registered numbers in the following list :\#151 ; Annularia radiata Brongn .
S A. stellata ( Schloth .
) [ No. 39,323 ] .
Dictyopteris brongniartiGutbier .
S * * * S * Lindley and Hutton ( '35 ) , vol. 3 , PI .
CXC and CXCI .
t Nicholls ( '58 ) , p. 251 .
X Kidston ( '86 ) .
S After careful search , I have been unable to find any specimens of this species labelled " Forest of Dean .
" Alethopteris lonchitica ( Schloth.).* A. serli ( Brongn .
) [ No. 39,089 ] .
Lonchopteris rugosa Brongn .
[ No. 52,674 ] .
Pecopteris arborescens(Schloth .

P. oreopteridea ( Schloth .
) [ No. 39,324].t P. miltoni ( Artis .
) [ Nos. 52,674 and V. 884 ] .
Curiously enough , among the large collection which I have gathered together from the Forest , I have found no examples of Dictyopteris , Alethopteris lonchitica , A. serli or Pecopteris oreopteridea , and only one example of Annularia stellata .
Dr. Kidston^ has also since recorded Pecopteris Brongn .
from the Forest of Dean .

The Fossil Flora .
None of the species collected from the Forest of Dean appear to be new , and the majority are already well known from other British coalfields .
Descriptions are , therefore , only given in cases where there appear to be special reasons for so doing .
No attempt has been made to construct a complete synonymy in any case , but references to figures of the type and a few other important illustrations of the species are given in each instance .
The relative abundance or rarity of occurrence , which is a matter of great importance in estimating the horizon , is indicated by the list of localities at which the plants were observed , the numbers referring to the specimens now incorporated in the Carboniferous Plant Collections of the Sedgwick Museum , Cambridge , where they may he consulted .

Above one of the nodes two branch scars are seen .
The surface of the hark is smooth , though finely striated longitudinally .
The excellent example of the pith-cast of this species collected at Trafalgar Colliery , part of which is figured on Plate 13 , fig. 16 , closely resembles that described by Dr. Kidston in 1889 ( see synonymy ) , now in the Liverpool Museum .
It shows 22 internodes of varying length .
Above the fifth node from the broken lower end of the specimen , there is a row of four small branch scars , distant from one another ( Plate 13 , fig. 16 ) .
Then follow eleven internodes without branch scars , and at the seventeenth node , not shown in the figure , another row of three branch scars is seen , above which four further internodes occur without branch scars .

Description.\#151 ; Several good examples of this plant , which is comparatively rare in Britain , have been obtained , of which that on Plate 13 , fig. 19 , shows the external features of the cone .
As is usually the case , the upper part of each whorl of the united bracts has been broken off irregularly .
This cone measures over 16 cm .
in length and 3 cm .
across .
The large size of these cones , in comparison with those of other fructifications attributed to Calamites , is one of their most striking features .
The example figured on Plate 13 , fig. 20 , is 20 cm .

in breadth , and , like the last , is incomplete , neither the base nor the apex being seen .
The external surfaces of the broken whorls of sporophylls are seen above , while below , the axis of the cone , with its short internodes , is clearly shown .
Unfortunately , however , neither of these specimens permits us to add anything to what is already known of the organisation of Macrostachya .

Remarks.\#151 ; After a careful examination of these specimens , which also show some resemblance to S.( Renaultia ) footneri , Maratt , I have arrived at the conclusion that they are probably identical with S. ( .(Brongn .

Remarks.\#151 ; The specimens from Badstock figured by Kidston ( see above ) were regarded as allied to L. brevifolium Lesq .
, but apparently there appeared to him to be some doubt as to their identity with Lesquereux 's plant .
I have examined other examples from Badstock and the Forest of Dean , and , while these exhibit among themselves some small variation in size and shape , they appear to me to agree very well with Lesquereux 's figure , and I have therefore attributed them provisionally to his species .

Description.-\#151 ; The specimen figured on Plate 12 , fig. 11 , is no doubt nearly allied to S. mamillarisBrongn .
, though , as regards the shape of the leaf scar , it is quite distinct from the typical examples of that variable species , occurring in Britain .
The apical angle of the scar is rounded , and the upper lateral margins , on each side , are markedly concave , so that the whole outline of the scar is somewhat pyriform in shape .
So far as one can judge from Sternberg 's somewhat rough figure of his example from Badnitz in Bohemia , this specimen agrees with his S. trigona , and a comparison with the much clearer figures given by Weiss and Kidston confirms this conclusion .
So far as I am aware this species has only been previously recorded from Britain from the Middle Coal Measures of Lancashire .
The leaf-base , below the scar , has a faint vertical median ridge , with a very faint , oblique , lateral ridge on either side , the latter traversed by fine oblique striae , slanting in the opposite direction to the lateral ridges .

It is probably one of the numerous varieties of S. tessellata , perhaps approximating very closely to S. fossorum Weiss , which I regard merely as a variety of that species .

\#151 ; XXX \#151 ; XX THE FOREST OF DEAN COALFIELD ( GLOUCESTERSHIRE ) .
The number of records from the seams of the First and Third Divisions is naturally less than that from the coals of the Second Division .
The plants from the First Division were obtained from two seams only , worked at a single colliery , those from the Third , from two seams , worked at three pits , whereas those from the Second Division were collected at many large collieries , each working several coals .
Comparing the flora of the First Division with that of the Second , we find that all the species recorded above are common to the two , except:\#151 ; Annulariagalioides ( L. and H. ) , Sphenopteris(Renaultia ) c ( Brongn .
) , both of which are rare , and represented only by two specimens in each case .
The commonest species of the First Division are :\#151 ; Calamocladus equisetiform(Schloth .
) .
Pecopteris polymorpha ( Brongn .
) .
Lepidodendron lanceolatum Lesq .
All of these are also abundant in the Second Division .
There appears to be no essential difference between the flora of the Woorgreens coals and that of the Second Division , and the horizon of the former is undoubtedly the same as that of the latter .
Turning next to the Third Division , we find that the following species have not been obtained from the higher beds :\#151 ; Annularia stellata ( Schloth .
) .
Sphenophyllum m ( Bronn ) .
Mariopterislatifolia ?
( Brongn .
) .
Pecopteris arborescens ( Schloth .
) .
P. ( Dactylotheca ) plumosa ( Artis ) .
Lepidophloios , cf. L. Sternb .
Leipidophyllum b Lesq .
The most abundant plants in the Third Division are :\#151 ; W Sphenophyllum emarginatum Brongn .
Sphenopteris neuropteroides ( Boul .
) .
Neuropteris ovata Hoflm .
Pecopteris miltoni ( Artis ) .
These are also frequent in the Second Division , except Sphenopteris neuropteroides ( Boul .
) .
From a comparison of the floras of the three Divisions we thus arrive at the conclusion that they are practically identical , and that the palgeobotanical horizon is undoubtedly the same in each case .
This horizon is unmistakeably that known to the palseobotanist as the Upper Coal Measures , and we have thus arrived at the VOL. COIL----B .

258 MR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORA OF important deduction , which it was one of the particular objects of this work to determine , that the whole of the 'productive coal measures of the Forest of Dean belong to one horizon , the Upper Coal Measures .
This conclusion is in entire agreement with the opinion expressed by Dr. Kidston* many years ago , though the fact that no other horizon is represented among the productive series had not hitherto been proved , nor had the vertical distribution of the flora been previously worked out in detail .
We will now compare the fossil flora of the Forest of Dean with the Upper Coal Measure floras as developed elsewhere in Britain .

X X X 1 From this table we see that there is a very marked agreement between the flora of the Forest of Dean and the Upper Coal Measure floras of other British coalfields .

, Sigillaria rugosa Brongn .
, and S. brardi Brongn .
, have been already recorded elsewhere from the lower horizons of the Transition Coal Measures and the Middle Coal Measures , and now , from a still higher horizon , in the Forest .
On the other hand , Sphenophyllum magus Broun , and Mariopteris ( Brongn .
) , have not apparently been previously found above the Middle Coal Measures , while Sigillaria trigona Sternb .
is very rare in Britain on that horizon .
A more detailed comparison of the flora of the Forest with that of the Upper Coal Measures of Badstock and Bristol , the nearest coalfields to the South , is of interest , for , as will be seen from the following table , there are considerable differences in detail between them .

In the Forest of* Dean , Calamite pith-casts are as infrequent as at Radstock .
Catamites undulatusSternb .
, which is not found at Radstock or Bristol , is , however , known from the Upper Coal Measures elsewhere in Britain .
On the other hand , C. crucialus Weiss is very rare at Radstock , only two specimens being known .
Annularia galioides ( L. and H. ) is the most remarkable species , new to this horizon .
Calamocladus equisetiforniis ( Schloth .
) is the most frequent type of Calamite foliage in the Forest , where Annularia stellata(Schloth .
) and A. ( Zenker ) , both of which are very abundant at Badstock , are very rare , only one specimen of the former , and two of the latter , having been collected .
Several examples of the cones Calamostachys tubercidata(Sternb .
) belonging to the same plant as the leaves Annularia stellata ( Schloth .
) have , however , been found .
The very interesting cone Macrostachya infundibidiformis ( Brongn .
) appears to be a little more frequent in the Forest than at Badstock , where it is very rare .
Sphenophyllales.\#151 ; Passing to the SphenophyHales , we find emarginatum Brongn .
as abundant in the Forest as at Badstock .
Two specimens of S. majus ( Bronn ) have also been obtained from the Forest , and this plant has apparently not been recorded elsewhere from the Upper Coal Measures .
Pteridospermece and Filicales.\#151 ; Of the Sphenopterids , only one is common both to the Forest and to Badstock .
S. neuropteroides ( Boulay ) is abundant in the former , but rare in the latter coalfield .
The six other species of Sphenopteris , recorded from Badstock by Kidston , are all infrequent , four of them being very rare or known only from a single specimen .
This is also the case as regards the records of the genera Ptychocarpus , Schizostachys , and On the other hand , the occurrence of Sphenopteris chcerophylloides ( Brongn .
) in the Forest is the only recorded instance of this species in the Upper Coal Measures in Britain .
I believe I have also collected it from Badstock .
Mariopteris muricata ( Schloth .
) and M. nervosa ( Brongn .
) are stated to he very rare at Badstock .
The former species is not infrequent in the Forest , where M. latifolia ( Brongn .
) may also occur .
The Neuropterids , on the other hand , correspond very closely , both as regards species and abundance .
N. scheuchzeri Hoff .
, N. macrophylla Brongn .
, and N. ovata Hoffm .
, are all frequent , both at Badstock and in the Forest , while iV .
rarinervis Bunb .
and N. ( Cyclopteris ) Jimbriata ( Lesq .
) are much rarer in both coalfields .
Dictyopteris munsteri(Eichw .
) has been recorded by Kidston from Badstock , and another species D. brongniarti Gutb .
from the Forest ( see p. 240 ) .
Odontopteris occurs in both coalfields , though but very rarely , and the Forest species has not been determined .
As regards the Alethopterids , the most striking difference is the absence in my collections of any examples of A. serli and A. lonchitica , the former species being one of the commonest and most typical plants at Badstock .
Dr. Kidston ( see p. 240 ) has , however , recorded both species from the Forest , where they must be very rare .
In the Forest of Dean , A. davreuxi(Brongn .
) and A. aquilina ( Schloth .
) are the two commonest representatives of this genus , but while fairly abundant they are by no means so frequent as A. serli is at Badstock , where these two species are very rare .
A.grandini ( Brongn .
) is rare in both coalfields .
The Pecopterids of the Forest , so far as the recorded species are concerned , agree very closely with those of the Radstock coalfield , with the important exception that Pecopteris oreopteridea , so abundant at Radstock , is probably unknown in the Forest , where its place is taken by P.polymorpha Brongn .
, which is very rare at Radstock .
Pec .
arborescens ( Schloth .
) , another abundant Radstock species , is rare in the Forest , only three examples having been obtained from the Third Division.* P. ( Artis ) is abundant in both coalfields , though P. ( ) plumosa ( Artis ) , which is very frequent at Radstock , is rare in the Forest .
The other eleven species of Pecopteris , recorded by Kidston from Radstock , are unknown from the Forest , and so also is ( Schloth .
) .
All of these , however , except P. unita Brongn .
, are very rare plants , only represented in Britain by a very few specimens .
Lycopodiales.\#151 ; Turning next to the Lycopodiales , we find that the commoner species of Lepidodendron and Lepidophyllumoccur in about equal abundance in both coalfields .
In the case , however , of the Sigillarias , matters are very different .
Seven of the species recorded from Radstock by Kidston are there very rare , and no examples of these , nor of Asolanus camptotce Wood , have been met with in the Forest .
The two commonest Radstock species are S. cumulata Weiss and S. laevigata Brongn .
, the latter alone being found in the Forest , where the other important species are S. elongata Brongn .
, S. rugosa Brongn .
tessellata ( Steinh .
) , S. ( Brongn .
) , and S. trigona Sternb .
also occur in the Forest , where they are rare .
These three species have not been found at Radstock .
Cordaitales.\#151 ; The leaf Cordaites angidosostriatus Grand ' Eury is as abundant in the Forest as at Radstock .
From this comparison of the floras of the Forest of Dean and Radstock coalfields , we see that while there is a general agreement , there are differences in detail , which are more marked than those which exist between the known floras of Radstock and Bristol ( see Table III ) .
These differences , however , do not appear to indicate any considerable disagreement as regards horizon , for , as we shall see , the percentage of essentially Stephanian plants present is approximately the same in each case .
They are best explained as local variations in the distribution of the flora of the period .
As compared with the flora of the Upper Coal Measures ( Upper Pennant ) of South Wales , !
of which , unfortunately , little is known at present , we find that five Forest of Dean species are there represented out of a total of eight recorded .
Two of the three species occurring in South Wales , which are not included in my collections , have , however , been previously recorded by Kidston ( see p. 240 ) from the Forest of Dean .
They are Alethopterisserli ( Brongn .
) and A. lonchitica * There is , however , a specimen of this species from the Second Division , at Trafalgar Colliery , in the Sedgwick Museum , Cambridge ( No. 1216 ) , which was presented by Mr. W. H. Norris in 1905 .

Neuropteris jtexuosa Sternb .
, abundant at Eadstock and in South Wales , is apparently unrecorded from the Forest .
Lastly , we may institute a comparison with the scanty flora known from the Newent Coalfield , # lying but a short distance North of the Forest of Dean .
Of the nine Newent species , two only , Sphenopterobtusiloba Brongn .
and Pecopteris oreopteridea ( Schloth .
) , are unrepresented in my collections from the Forest , and of these the latter has been previously recorded by Kidston ( see p. 240 ) .
The flora of the Upper Coal Measure horizon is essentially Westphalian in type , though a considerable number of Stephanian species are present , as I have recently explained in another paper , f In the case of the Iladstock flora , as recorded by Dr. Ktdston , out of some 90 species , about 24 are essentially Stephanian plants , or 26'6 per cent. In the case of the Forest of Dean flora , as indicated by the following table , 11 essentially Stephanian species occur out of a total of 44 , or 25 per cent. Table IV shows the distribution in time of the Forest of Dean species , all of which are known from the Westphalian .
Some of them are essentially Stephanian plants , while others , essentially Westphalian , are also known to occur in the higher zone .

The " Millstone Grits " of the Forest of Dean .
The Third Division ( see table on p. 236 ) of the productive measures of the Forest is , as has been already pointed out , essentially an arenaceous series .
The sandstones , especially those both above and below the Wittington Coal , are quarried on a large scale and exported from the Forest .
They are much used for building purposes , the THE FOREST OF DEAN COALFIELD ( GLOUCESTERSHIRE ) .
reputation of the Forest of Dean Stone being considerable in the West of England .
As has been shown here , these sandstones are of Upper Coal Measure age .
Below the Trenchard Coal , and above the Carboniferous Limestone , we also find arenaceous rocks , red in colour , with subsidiary beds of marl , limestone , and ironstone , and , near their base , conglomerates .
The thickness of these beds no doubt varies locally .
It is estimated at 299 feet by Buck land and Conybeare , * 265 feet by de la Beche , f 470 feet by Weathered , | and 612-780 feet by Hoskold .
S In Mushet 's section , quoted by Buckland and Conybeare , || these beds are termed Millstone Grit , and the same term has also been applied to them by all those who have since written on the geology of this coalfield , and , except by Maclaughlan , they have always been mapped as such .

If we enquire what is the evidence for regarding the 267 feet of arenaceous sediments , as shown above , lying below the Trenchard Coal and above the Lid Stone , as the equivalents of the Millstone Grits of the North Midland coalfields , we find that it rests entirely on lithological grounds .
It will be remembered that there was formerly a tendency , in the case of nearly all British coalfields , to map the basal sediments of the Upper Carboniferous sequence , whenever they have proved to be sandy or gritty , as Millstone Grits .
The only true Millstone Grits are those beds which belong palseon tologically to the basal portion of the Lower Coal Measures horizon .
In recent years the suspicion that such mapping is sometimes unreliable has become more and more pronounced , especially where the lithology is the sole THE FOREST OF DEAN COALFIELD ( GLOUCESTERSHIRE ) .
basis of such conclusions .
It seems to have been overlooked that the first phase in the initiation of an Upper Carboniferous sequence has commonly been the deposition of a considerable thickness of arenaceous rocks , without or with only a few thin seams of coal , and that the productive beds ( above this series ) have been laid down at different periods in Coal Measure time in different areas , as has been indicated on palseobotanical evidence .
The same conclusion also has recently been arrived at on other grounds .
Dr. Vaughan* has shown that in the Mitcheldean area of the Forest , as well as at Bristol , the higher beds of Carboniferous Limestone age assume a Millstone Grit facies .
It is therefore clear that , in the Forest of Dean , the so-called Millstone Grits overlie conformably the Carboniferous Limestone , and are in part of Lower Carboniferous age .
It has been shown here that the Coleford High Delph seam belongs to the Upper Coal Measures , and that there is every reason to suppose that the Upper and Lower Trenchard Coals belong to the same horizon , though no fossil plants have been found associated with them .
It is therefore clear that there must be an unconformity somewhere below the Trenchard Coal , and between it and the lower portion of the so-called Millstone Grits .
Mr. Dixonf has recently discovered such an unconformity between the " Sweet Coals " of the Titterstone Clee Hills and the so-called Millstone Grits of that area , which , again , he regards as " much older than the rocks of that name which underlie Coal Measures elsewhere .
" In the Forest of Dean there is at present no evidence of such an unconformity , except in the South-eastern portion of the field , where , as is well known , the productive measures overstep the so-called Millstone Grits as well as the Lower Carboniferous rocks , from the Howbeach Valley southwards to Soil well Farm.| In other parts of the coalfield there appear to be very few sections showing the junction of the Carboniferous Limestone and the sandstone series above , which at the present time , unlike the sandstones of the Third Division of the productive measures , are very little worked .
Further , so far as 1 can ascertain , there are now no exposures to be found which exhibit the relationships of the productive measures and the so-called Millstone Grits below .
Thus , if an unconformity exists below the Trenchard Coals , there is no direct evidence of it at the present time , but this may be well explained by the lack of sections in a region densely forested , and for the most part uninhabited except on the North and North-east boundaries .
As the result of a rapid examination of the margin of this coalfield , the only evidence which I could discover , which may or may not bear on this question , occurs in the Mitcheldean area .
At the northern end of Mitcheldean Meend enclosure , at Pingary 's Tump , there are two pairs of small quarries , one close to and slightly to the South-west of the cottage , and the other pair a few yards further north .
In these quarries the beds * Vaughan ( '05 ) , pp. 252 and 199 .
t Dixon ( 'll ) , p. 612 .
t See Hoskold ( '92 ) , pp. 133-135 .
in descending order are a thick pebble conglomerate , sandstones , and limestones , all dipping west .
The conglomerates have been worked in one quarry of each pair , while the other quarry , at a lower level in each case , shows a sandstone bed overlying limestones .
There appears to be a considerable difference in the dip of the sandstones as compared with that of the limestones in both quarries .
On the other hand , until the area has been thoroughly mapped on a large scale , it will not he possible to determine the position of the beds seen in these quarries , either in relation to the Whitehead Limestone or to any other landmark in the series , and the observed difference in the dip of the beds is not in itself conclusive evidence of an unconformity .
I have not been able to obtain any fossil plants from the so-called Millstone Grits of the Forest .
Weathered * has , however , recorded a Lepidodendron " allied to L. Grijfithii Brongn .
" from them at Dry brook .
Thus their paleeobotanical horizon remains unknown .
Reviewing the present evidence I am inclined to think that it will eventually prove that an unconformity exists a short distance below the Lower Trenchard Coal ( see the table on p. 268 ) perhaps a little above the Sandstone vein of Iron Ore. In this case the greater portion of the Millstone Grits , so-called , will be found to be simply a sandy facies of the Carboniferous Limestone series , just as the lower beds have already been shown to be by Dr. Vaughan .
I imagine that , in the Forest of Dean , the Upper Coal Measures rest unconformably on an ancient floor consisting for the most part of the higher sandy beds of the Carboniferous Limestone series , though , in some parts of the area , on Carboniferous Limestone of normal facies or even on Old Red Sandstone .

The Relationships of the Forest of Dean Coalfield the Coalfields of , Radstock , South Wa , and Newent .
We now pass to a consideration of the relationships of the Forest of Dean to the Carboniferous tracts which occur to the North , South , and West .
The opinion has been frequently expressed that the Forest of Dean is an outlying portion of the South Wales coalfield .
This view has been upheld by de la Beche , !
Ramsey , ; [ Hoskold , S ( who also concludes that the Forest was originally joined to the Bristol coalfield ) and quite recently by Gibson.|| MushetI identified the Third Division of the productive series in the Forest with the Pennant Rock of Bristol , and * * * S * Weathered ( '83 ) , p. 215 .

THE FOREST OF DEAN COALFIELD ( GLOUCESTERSHIRE ) .
Hoskold# has provisionally accepted the same view more recently .
De la BecheI and others have correlated these beds with the " central sandstone series of the Pont y pool district " in South Wales , i.e. , the Pennant Grit .
Gibson !
states that a " thick mass of sandstone , comparable with the Pennant Sandstone of South Wales , lies between the Coleford Highdelf and a seam known as the Church way Highdelf .
" The evidence brought forward in this paper is entirely at variance with many of the conclusions previously expressed .
The recent studies of the fossil floras of the plexus of Upper Carboniferous areas in the West of England and South Wales have served to show that the problem of tracing the original relationships of these tracts , now isolated in separate basins by earth movements , is far more complicated than was at one time imagined .
At present many difficulties remain to be overcome , and it would appear to be unlikely that we shall understand fully the true relationships of these coalfields for some time yet , until further palaeontological investigations and a broad study of the tectonics of the whole area have been completed .
It may be well , however , to enumerate here some of the chief difficulties , unexplained at present .
The idea has long been prevalent that these detached basins at one time formed a continuous sheet of measures over the West of England and South Wales , and that their present deposition was due to the Armorican uplift , the axes of which traverse the South of England and Wales , from West to East .
S This theory was established on a sure footing by Godwin-Austin in his celebrated paper " On the Possible Extension of the Coal-Measures beneath the South-Eastern part of England , " published in 1856 .
Further Godwin-Austin showed that , in theory , the main axis of elevation is prolonged across Southern England into France , Belgium , and Westphalia , and that the coalfields there are not only closely related to one another , but to those under discussion here .
The same author also prophesied the discovery of other coalfields , east of the Forest of Dean and Somerset coalfields , beneath the Mesozoic rocks of the South of England , and this assumption has since been fully proved by the discovery in recent years of the Kent coalfield .
The theory that these coalfields once formed a continuous sheet does not necessarily imply that the beds of the now isolated basins belong to the same horizon in all cases .
The author|| has recently pointed out how , as we pass from Westphalia through Belgium , France and Kent to Somerset , higher and higher horizons appear towards the West .
The Middle Coal Measure horizon is the highest represented on the Continent , so far as this chain of coalfields is concerned .
In Kent , the Transition series appears , and , in Somerset and Bristol , Upper Coal Measures occur in addition .
So far no particular difficulty can be said to arise .
But when we come to examine * * * S * HOSKOLD ( '92 ) , pp. 127 , 135 , 142 .

|| Arber ( '09 ) , p. 37 .
the mutual relationships of Upper Carboniferous rocks in Somerset , Gloucester , and South Wales we meet with the following difficulties .
In the Forest of Dean , as has been shown here , there is little doubt that the beds are wholly of Upper Coal Measure age , and that they probably rest unconformably on Lower Carboniferous deposits .
In South Wales , not only are the Upper , Transition , and Middle Coal Measures well developed , as Kidston* has proved , but rocks mapped as Millstone Grits fringe the basin and overlie the Carboniferous Limestone .
So far as I am aware , it has never been shovm , on palaeontological evidence , that these sandy , basal beds are the true equivalent of the Millstone Grits of the Midlands .
Whether they are so or not , remains an open question .
At any rate , apart from these beds , should they prove to be true Millstone Grits , the Lower Coal Measures are unrepresented , on the present evidence , in South Wales .
The succession of seams and the thickness of the beds in South Wales varies in different portions of the coalfield .
In the Eastern ( Monmouth ) district the following is the general section :\#151 ; f Horizon .
Upper Pennant Series 2-300 feet , with 3 coals \#151 ; Upper Coal Measures .
Shales and Sandstones Lower Pennant Series = Pennant Grit or Sandstone 800-1000 feet , with 9 coals Chiefly Sandstones = Transition Coal Measures .
White Ash Series or Infra-Pennant 850-1600 feet , with 17 coals = Middle Coal Measures .
Chiefly Shales Farewell Pock Thus , as regards the horizons represented , the South Wales coalfield differs entirely from the Forest of Dean , and for this reason alone it seems extremely improbable that the latter is really an outlier of the former .
If this were the case , how are we to explain the absence of the Middle and Transition Coal Measures in the Forest ?
On the southern side of the Bristol Channel we find the great barren coalfield * Kidston ( '942 ) .

ol Devon and Cornwall , which is no doubt also related to the Armorican uplift , and is at present the only coalfield in Britain which is definitely known to lie to the south of the North Devon axis .
Here the rocks belong to the Middle Coal Measure* horizon , and apparently rest directly on Lower Carboniferous sediments .
We turn next to the Badstock portion of the Somerset coalfield , lying between the Mendip and the South Wales axes .

MR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORA OF and the red shales above the Farrington series are very thin .
The Upper and Transition Coal Measure floras have been worked out by Dr. Kidston , '* and , more recently , additions have been made to the former by Mr. LiLLJE.f A short distance to the North-east of the Forest of Dean , and separated from the Mitcheldean area by May Hill , there is a small tract of Upper Carboniferous rocks , of which very little is known .
These beds rest on the Old Red Sandstones .
An attempt^ has been made recently to obtain fossil plants from this area , with but little success , for the coals have not been worked for many years past , and the coalfield is largely concealed beneath Mesozoic rocks .
Exposures , either natural or artificial , are thus practically absent at present .
So far as the limited flora , which includes Pecopteris oreopteridia ( Schloth .
) , arborescens ( Schloth .
) , Neuropteris rarmervisBunb .
and Annularia radiata Brongn .
, will permit of an opinion being expressed as to the horizon of the beds , their position certainly appears to be higher than the Middle Coal Measures , and to be equivalent either to the Upper or the Transition Coal Measures of Badstock and Bristol .
To the North of Newent , several small patches of Coal Measures^ form links in the chain connecting Newent with the Forest of Wyre and Coalbrookdale coalfields , these being the most southerly of the series of coal basins of the Welsh Borderland .
The fossil floras of these areas are under examination , but the work will not be completed for some time yet .
So far as it has progressed at the present time , it would certainly seem that the Newent area is more closely connected with the Wyre Forest than with the Forest of Dean .

From this brief summary it is obvious that , while the productive measures of the Forest of Dean are the equivalents of the Hadstock and Farrington Series in Somerset and of the Upper Pennant Series of South Wales , there is no exact lithological correspondence between these coalfields .
There appear to be no equivalents in the Forest of the New Hock and Yobster Series of Bristol and Hadstock , nor of the Pennant Grit and Middle Coal Measures of South Wales .
The horizon of the Pennant Grit of Somerset is unknown .
It may be either Upper or Transition Coal Measures , and it is thus still an open question whether , if the former alternative should prove to be correct , the Third Division of the Forest may not be the representative in the Forest of the Pennant Grit of Bristol .
As regards South Wales , however , the so-called " Millstone Grit " of the Forest is the only series there developed which could possibly be the equivalent of the Lower Pennant ( = Transition Coal Measures ) , and , as has been emphasised already , part of these beds , and probably a very large part , belong to the Carboniferous Limestone .
This being the case , it appears to me to be futile at present to institute a closer comparison between the massive sandstone series of these three neighbouring coalfields .
All that we can say at the present stage is that , in the Forest , this series is of Upper Coal Measure age , while in the eastern portion of South Wales it belongs to the Transition Coal Measures , and in the Bristol and Hadstock coalfields the exact horizon is unknown , though it is not lower than the Transition Coal Measures .
On the whole , it is clear that the correspondence between the Forest of Dean and the coalfields of Bristol and Hadstock is much closer than with the South Wales .
It may perhaps be imagined that the present difficulties originate from the fact that the horizons , as determined by the fossil plants , are not sufficiently accurate to warrant a close comparison .
Or it may be thought that the productive measures of these coalfields all belong to one horizon , and that we are dealing with floras of local distribution , and not with assemblages representing different stages in the evolution of Carboniferous vegetation .
It would be out of place here to attempt to justify the existence of palseohotanical horizons , or the validity of the large amount of work which has been done , in recent years and in many lands , on the study of the vertical , as well as the lateral , distribution of Carboniferous plants .
As a reply , however , to such a possible criticism , attention may be called to the fact that an essentially similar problem , and one quite independent of the palseobotanical evidence , is still unsolved in the Midlands .
This is the relationship of the Southern Midland to the North Midland coalfields .
The latter , comprising the basins of South Lancashire on the West , and Yorkshire , with extensions into Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire , on the East , are now very well known , both geologically and pakeobotanically .
The relationship of the one to the other , and of each to the Pennine uplift , is of the simplest , so much so that the chief seams on either side of the axis can be correlated .
We find here Upper , Transition , Middle , and Lower Coal Measures , resting on true Millstone Grits and , below these , Lower Carboniferous marine deposits .
2 m 2 MR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORA OF Some little distance to the South we find the Southern Midland fields of Warwickshire and South Staffordshire .
There is reason to believe that these basins are also related to the Pennine uplift , and to the North Midland basins , ^ but since their geology and palaeontology has been less thoroughly studied , the relationships are still far from clear .
We find , however , that , in both fields , the Middle Coal Measures are the lowest horizon of the Upper Carboniferous represented , and that these rest , in Warwickshire directly on Cambrian , and in South Staffordshire on Silurian rocks .
The Lower Coal Measures , Millstone Grits , and Carboniferous Limestones are here absent , which is , of course , a fact deduced from geological rather than palseobotanical observation .
It is scarcely necessary to emphasise the fact that the problem to be solved here has much in common with that with which we are concerned in the West of England and South Wales .
The tectonics of the districts under consideration here require much greater attention than has at present been devoted to them before the relationships of these coalfields can be made clear .
It is , however , becoming obvious that , on the borders of Gloucester and Somerset , we have evidence of possibly three distinct sets of axes , and where three ways meet confusion is likely to arise .
There are first of all the East and West axes of South Wales , the Mendips and North Devon , to which the coalfields of South Wales and of Devon and Cornwall , with their approximately East and West strike , are no doubt to be correlated .
A second uplift , possibly subsidiary to , though connected with the Armorican uplift , with a direction roughly North and South , starting from the Mendips and approximating to the Valley of the Severn , is probably responsible for the Radstock and Bristol coalfields on the East , and the Forest of Dean on the West , the strike of these coalBelds being also North and South .
This is the view first put forward by Buckland and ConybeareI as early as 1824 , and it is one with which I am in entire agreement .
Next , we have the complex series of uplifts of the Welsh Borderland , stretching , as Murchison showed , from Shropshire through the Malverns , approximately North and South , with which the Welsh Borderland chain of coalfields may be associated .
Where this axis ends to the southward is a disputed point .
The Forest of Wyre coalfield certainly belongs to this system .
The axis is continued further to the South in the Malvern Hills and May Hill .
The Newent coalfield was regarded by Buckland and Conybeare as belonging to the same system as the Somerset , Bristol , and Forest of Dean coalfields .
As I have already pointed out , I am inclined to think that it is more nearly related to the Welsh borderland chain .
At the same time I have not been able to find any evidence that the Newent Coals are newer than those of the Forest of Dean , as Dr. Groomj has recently concluded in an able discussion of the tectonic problems of the southern portion of the Welsh Borderland .

THE FOREST OF DEAN COALFIELD ( GLOUCESTERSHIRE ) .
2 77 lithology of the Borderland coalfields enables us to form any opinion , they appear to be very different from the basins of Badstock , Bristol , and the Forest of Dean , and I am therefore inclined provisionally to regard them as separate systems due to separate uplifts .

Conclusions .
Of the 44 species here described from the Forest of Dean coalfield none are new to Britain , though some are very rare fossils in this country .
From a study of the vertical distribution of these plants , it has been shown that the three divisions of the productive measures all belong to one horizon , which is the Upper Coal Measures .
Several species , including Annularia galioides ( L. and EL ) , ( Bronn ) , Lepidodendrondichotomum Sternb .
, as well as three species of Sigillaria , none of which have been previously known to occur above the Transition or Middle Coal Measures in Britain , are found in the Forest on a still higher horizon .
As compared with the flora of the Radstock coalfield , that of the Forest of Dean shows many points of general agreement , though there are also differences in detail .
Certain species which are abundant in one coalfield are rare in the other , and versa .
These differences are regarded as due to local variations in the distribution of O the flora of the period .
The rocks between the productive measures and the Carboniferous Limestone are discussed , and reasons are advanced in support of the view that the Upper Coal Measures of the Forest of Dean overlie unconformably the so-called Millstone Grits , which are in reality the higher beds ( of a sandy facies ) of the Carboniferous Limestone .
Owing to the general absence of sections , the unconformity has not , however , been demonstrated in the field .
True Millstone Grits , Lower , Middle , and Transition Coal Measures appear to be absent in the Forest of Dean , so that the unconformity in question is of considerable importance .
The relationships of this coalfield to the neighbouring coalfields of the West of England and South Wales are discussed from the palseobotanical standpoint .
It has been pointed out that the Forest of Dean exhibits no obvious relationship either to the South Wales or to the Radstock-Bristol coalfields .
The massive sandstone facies of the productive measures , known as the Pennant Grits in South Wales , belong to a lower horizon than the corresponding beds in the Third Division of the Forest of Dean .
There may be some correspondence between these beds and the so-called Pennant Grits of the Radstock-Bristol area , but until the palseobotanical horizon of the latter has been ascertained , the degree of correlation must remain doubtful .
On the whole the agreement between these two coalfields is closer than that between South Wales and the Forest of Dean .
The Radstock , Bristol , and Forest of Dean basins are believed to be related , not to the main axes of South Wales and the Mendips , but to a secondary , cognate uplift , stretching North and South , and approximating to the valley of the Severn .
The Forest of Dean does not appear to have any special affinity to the Newent , Wyre Forest , Coalbrookdale , and other 278 MR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORA OF coalfields of the Welsh Borderland series , which are regarded as forming a distinct chain of coalfields .
In the case of the Forest of Dean it seems evident that the Lower Carboniferous rocks and Old Bed Sandstones of the area remained elevated above sea level , and were denuded , until the beginning of Upper Coal Measure times , whereas in South Wales , and in Devon and Cornwall , depression set in , and the deposition of coal-bearing sediments began in Middle Coal Measure times , and in the Badstock-Bristol area in the Transition Coal Measure period .
Thus , on the palseobotanical evidence , the relationships of the coalfields of the West of England and South Wales have proved to be more complex than has hitherto been supposed , and this appears to be due , in part at least , to the coincidence of three distinct axes of elevation in the neighbourhood of the Forest of Dean .
