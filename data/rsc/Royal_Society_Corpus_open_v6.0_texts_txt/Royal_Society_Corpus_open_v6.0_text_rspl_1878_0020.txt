" " Note on the Valuc of Euler 's Constant ; likewise on the es of the Napierian Logarithms of 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 , and of the Modulus of common Logarithms , all carl.ied to 260 places of Decimals By Professor J. C. ADAMS , M.A. , F.B.S. Received December 6 , 1877 .
In bhe " " Proceedings of the Royal Society , pp. 521 , 522 , Mr. Glaisher has given the values of the Iogarithms of 2 , 3 , 5 , and 10 , and of Euler 's constant to 100 places of decimals , in correction of some previous results given by Mr. Shanks .
In vol. , pp. 28 and 31 , Mr. Shanks gives the resuIts of -calculation of the above-mentioned logarithms and of the modulus of common Iogarithms to 205 places , and of Euler 's constant to 110 places of decimals .
Having calculated the value of 31 Bernoulli 's numbers , in addition to the 31 previously known , I was induced to carry the approximation to ]Juler 's constant to a much greater extent than had been before practicable .
For this purpose I likewise -calculated the values of the above-mentioned logarithms , and found the sum of the reciprocals of the first 500 and of the first 1000 integers , all to upwards of 260 places of decimals .
I also found two independent relations between the logarithms just mentioned and the logarithm of 7 , which furnished a test of the accuracy of the work .

] on the Value of Euler 's Constant .
On comparing my results with those of Mr. Shanks , I found that the latter were all affected by an error in the and 104th places of decimals , in consequence of an error in the 104th place in the determination of .
With this exception , the logarithms given by Mr. Shanks were found to be correct to 202 places of decimals .
The error in the determination of , of course entirely vitiated Mr. Shanks ' value of the modulus from the place onwards .
As gives the complete remainder , however , after the division by his value of lo , I was enabled readily to find the correction to be applied to the erroneous value of the modulus .
Afterwards I tested the accuracy of the entire work by multiplying the corrected modulus by my value of Mr. Shanks ' values of the sum of the reciprocals of the first 500 and of the first 1000 integers , as well as his value of Euler 's constant , were found to be incorrect from the place onwards .
Let , or simply , when we are concerned with a given value of ? ?
denote the sum of the harmonic series , Also let , or simply , denote the value of the semi-convergent series , where , \amp ; c. , are the successive Bernoulli 's numbers .
Then if Euler 's constant be denoted by Fi , we shall have and the error committed by stopping at any term in the part of will be less than the value of the next term of the series .
I have calculated accurately the values of the Bernoulli 's numbers as far as , and approximately as ffi as , retaining a number of significant figures varying from 35 to 20 .
When , the employment of the numbers up to suffices to give the value of to 265 places of decimals .
When , it is necessary to employ the approximate values up to , in order to determine with an equal degree of exactness .
In order to reduce as much as possible the number of quantities which must be added together to find and , I have resolved the reciprocal of every integer up to 1000 into fractions whose denominators are primes or powers of primes .
Thus , and may be expressed by means of such fractions , and by adding or subtracting one or more integers , each of these ( 10 Prof. J. C. Adams [ Feb. 7 , fractions may be reduced to a positive proper fraction , the value of which in decimals may be taken from Gauss ' Table , in the second volume of his collected works , or calculated independently .
Thus I have found that:\mdash ; ( the sum of tlJe reciprocals of the pl.imes from 251 to 499 ) \mdash ; 19 .
Similarly I have found that:\mdash ; ( the sum of the reciprocals of the primes from 503 to 997 ) 1878 .

This mode of and is attended with the that if an error were made in the calculation of the former of these quantities , it would not affect latter .
The Iogarithms required have been found in the following manner:\mdash ; Let , and Then we have Also ; or again , and we have the equation of condition , which supplies a sufficient test of the accuracy of the calculations by which , and have been found .
Since If we have settled beforehand on the number of decimal places which we wish 10 retain , and have already formed the decimal values of the reciprocals of the successive integers to the extent required , then the formation of the values of , and , will only involve operations which , though numerous , are of extreme simplicity .
In this way have been found the following results:\mdash ; 0515657826 30122 75009 80839 1994520255 65155 3198701772 1174763352 Prof. J. C.
