Nascent hydrogen , acting upon an alcoholic solution of dinitrobenzole or of nitraniline , produces a crimson coloration , due to the formation of a new substance , to which we have given the name nitrosophenyline .
This new body presents some remarkable properties .
It fuses below 100 ?
C. ; is uncrystallizable , and not volatile without decomposition ; it dissolves in alcohol with an orange-red tint , and an alcoholic solution containing only '2 per cent. , although perfectly transparent to transmitted light , presents a flame-coloured luminous opacity in reflected light .
Nitrosophenyline dissolves in hydrochloric acid , producing an intense crimson colour , which is changed to a yellowish-brown by alkalies and is restored by acids .
The analysis of nitrosophenyline has led us to the formula C12 H6 N2 02 , which may be written thus:--C12NI N , and so may be viewed as aniline , in which 1 equiv. of hydrogen is replaced by 1 equiv. of binoxide of nitrogen : the following equation sufficiently explains the formation of nitrosophenyline : C12 114 2N04+ 8-==C12 HII N2 02+I 6O .
We have produced from all the dinitro-compounds we have yet experimented upon , colouring matters similar to nitrosophenyline : the following is a list of such dinitro-compounds:1 .
Dinitrobenzole ... .C12 114 2N4 .
2 .
Dinitrotoluole ... ... C14 H6 2NO4 .
3 .
Dinitroxylole ... ... C16 HE 2N04 .
4 .
Dinitroxylole ... . .
C1s HI1 2N04 .
5 .
Dinitrocymole ... ... C20 H12 2N04 .
6 .
Dinitronaphthaline. .
C2o I-I6 2N04 .
We have examined minutely the colouring substance produced in the case of dinitronaphthaline .
It proves to be perfectly analogous in composition with nitrosophenyline ; in properties also it is similar ; and from its alcoholic solution it may be obtained in crystals , having a lustre somewhat similar to that of mnurexide : its formula , as deduced from our analysis , is C20 HS N2 02 , which we may arrange thus:-C20 8N , and so view it as naphthylN02 amine in which 1 equiv. of hydrogen has been replaced by 1 equiv. of binoxide of nitrogen .
This substance we term nitrosonaphthyline .
It may likewise be obtained by the action of nitrous acid on naphthylamine , or of nitrite of potassium upon the hydrochlorate of naphthylamine : the following equations represent the three processes for its formation:1 .
C2o H62NO4+ 8=C2 1H8 N202+6HO .
2 .
C20,19 N+N03=C20 11s N2 02+ HO .
3 .
C20 H10 N , Cl+ KNO4=C2o , H8 N2 02 2HO + KC1 .
