physical and Physiological Properties of Tetrachlorethane , etc. 217 the toxic action had been more profound at high than at low temperature .
But the recovery , having once commenced , proceeded more rapidly at high than at low temperature .
We have not attempted to trace any quantitative relation between temperature and rate of recovery ; we content ourselves with noting in this connection that after , e.g. , quinine 2000 , recovery began at once at 19 ' , but was delayed for five minutes at 25 ' , in another case , after alcohol n/ 1 at 20 ' , recovery began after 1 minute , and at 24 ' after 4 minutes .
With a given toxic solution at a given temperature , the degree and completeness of recovery in saline were influenced by the previous duration of exposure to the action of the drug .
Thus , in alcohol n/ 1 the delay of recovery was 6 minutes after immersion for 12 minutes , and 10 minutes after immersion for 25 minutes .
An Examination of the Physical and Physiological Properties of Tetrachlorethane and By Y. H. Veley , F.R.S. ( Received November 23 , 1909 , \#151 ; Read January 20 , 1910 .
) ( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , South Kensington .
) Introductory.\#151 ; Within the last few years chloroderivatives of the aliphatic hydrocarbons , other than the familiar chloroform , have been used for various purposes , occasionally with fatal results .
It would , therefore , appear desirable to apply physiological tests , in the first instance , to such compounds to ascertain whether they might reasonably be scheduled as poisons , before they are entrusted to the hands of unskilled and ignorant persons .
As two such substances , namely ( 1 ) one of the isomeric tetrachlorethanes , and ( 2 ) trichlor-ethylene , came into my hands through Dr. Willcox , they were compared with chloroform ( taken as a standard ) by the muscle method ; further , as the physical data at least of the latter compound have been curiously overlooked , the opportunity was taken of determining certain of these by instruments , calibrated for previous investigations .
Historical.\#151 ; Symmetrical tetrachlorethane , sometimes called acetylene perchloride , CHCI2.CHCI2 , was first obtained by Berthelot and Jungfleisch* from acetylene and chlorine gases in presence of antimony chloride ; the * ' Count .

These writers also showed that when this compound is heated with alcoholic potash , one molecular proportion of hydrochloric acid is removed with formation of trichlorethylene , CHC1 : CC12 , a liquid , b.p. 88 , of chloroformlike odour .
Tetrachlorethane was more fully examined by Paterno and Pisati , * who prepared it from dichloraldehyde and phosphorus pentachloride ; the following physical data are given , b.p. ( corr .
) 147 + 0*25 ; D ' = 1*614 , D24 = 1*578 , I)100 = 1*522 compared with water at the same respective temperatures .
They confirmed the observation of Berthelot and Jungfleisch as to the formation of trichlorethylene , b.p. 87 to 88 .
Trichlorethylene was also obtained by Paterno and Oglialorof as one of the products formed by heating chloral with phosphorus pentasulphide .
Certain physical data of tetrachlorethane are given by Kanonnikoff , | namely D20/ 4 = 1*5897 and the refractive index / u.A = 1*49051 .
The preparation of tetrachlorethane on a sufficiently large scale by the chlorination of either ethylene chloride or acetylene ( adopting certain precautions ) in presence of aluminium chloride is fully described by Mouneyrat .
S As the cost of manufacture , both of acetylene and chlorine gases , as also the price of aluminium chloride , have been considerably reduced , tetra-chlorethane can be prepared cheaply , as also trichlorethylene from it .

Another sample -was previously shaken up with a concentrated solution of sodium carbonate , then dried over calcium chloride and redistilled ; the main bulk of the liquid came over at87'55 + 0-l ( corr .

Both the samples were used as pure for the purpose of experiment .
I am indebted to Mr. Ellis for a determination of the chlorine contents ; the value obtained was 99-97 of that required by theory , thus showing that the method adopted for purification had been successful .
As the statement has been made that trichlorethylene on distillation gives off hydrochloric acid gas , the receiver in the latter operation was connected with an absorption vessel , containing a definite volume of 10 sodium hydroxide , but the amount of alkali neutralised by the gas evolved on distillation of 250 c.c. of trichlorethylene was quite insignificant .
The vapour of trichlorethylene , kept in a stoppered bottle and exposed to ordinary daylight , gave an acid reaction , but the same applies in a less degree to chloroform .
At present , no experiments have been conducted with a view of determining the relative decomposition and consequent acidity of trichlorethylene and chloroform respectively of presumably the same degree of purity and under identical conditions of illumination .
The suggestion is , however , raised that the superincumbent vapour , and not the liquid , in a partially filled bottle is initially decomposed .
Determination of the density at different temperatures gave the following results:\#151 ; D*/ 4 - 1-49045 , D17'5/ 17*5 = l-47020 , D25'5^25'5 = l-45987 ; from these determinations the relative volumes in terms of that at 4 ' are :\#151 ; V4 = 1 , yu.5 = 10128 , V25.5 = 1-0209 .

] Physiological Properties of Tetrachlorethane , etc.221 Preparation of Solutions for Physiological Experiments with Frog 's Sartorius Muscle by Waller 's * The standard taken for comparison was n/ 100 chloroform , and all data are given in terms thereof ; the chloroform sample used had been prepared from chloral hydrate .
Solutions of chloroform , tetrachlorethane , and trichlor-ethylene were made up in physiological saline solution ( 0'6 per cent. ) to m/ 100 concentration by weighing out to within 1 part in 800 the quantities of the several liquids required , which would be as under:\#151 ; 1195 gramme chloroform in 1 litre = 0119 per cent , ( neglecting density variation of water ) .
1-315 " trichlorethylene " = 0131 " " 1-678 " tetrachlorethane " = 0168 " " Half these quantities were actually taken and dissolved in litre saline solution .
The chloroform and trichlorethylene dissolved fairly readily in this proportion , but the tetrachlorethane required a day or more for completion .
It was found necessary to prepare the chloroform solution afresh after two or three days , as otherwise irregular results were obtained ; but whether this was the result of loss of chloroform by evaporation , or some chemical change between the chloroform and water in presence of daylight , or from both causes , was not further investigated .
In the preliminary experiments with the commercial products the substances were weighed out as pure for lack of better data ; the errors would probably amount to 8 to 10 per cent. The experiments were conducted in the usual manner ; simultaneous records with a pair of muscles were obtained : firstly , of the normal response to induction shocks when the muscles were immersed in tap-water saline solution ( 0"6 per cent. ) ; secondly , the time required for abolition of response after the solutions to be examined had been simultaneously substituted for the saline solution , and , thirdly , the time and degree of recovery , if any , after the saline solution was in its turn resubstituted for the solutions under examination .
Preliminary experiments with commercial samples of trichlorethylene and tetrachlorethane showed that the former was rather more toxic , but more \ regular in its action , than chloroform , and that the latter was about four times more toxic than chloroform ; in both cases the recovery was more regular .
The details with the purified materials are given in the sequel:\#151 ; * ' Roy .

] Physiological Properties of Tetrachlorethane , etc. 225 It will be observed from the above numbers that the action of trichlorethylene on the muscle can be represented practically , except at the end , by a straight line , * the geometrical figure being approximately a right-angled triangle , whereas that of chloroform is initially an area bounded by a convex and a concave surface , and finally becomes triangular .
Though cases in which the rate of chemical change is a linear function of time are rare , yet they have been observed , especially with solutions of very great dilution.f Such a result would not , therefore , exclude the action of trichlorethylene on muscle from the category of chemical change .
As regards the recoveries , that from the chloroform was , at first , more pronounced , but generally a diminution set in , and in some cases a contracture more or less marked , which put an end to the record .
On the other hand , that from the trichlorethylene started slowly and proceeded regularly .
The measurements of one such recovery are given ; at the point called " interval " it was necessary to reset the travelling plate and marker for a higher line ; the time would be about two to three minutes .

But , however this may be , the recovery from trichlorethylene is more regular than that from any other drug examined by this method .
* From an inspection of numerous records it appears probable that an arc of a curve has become almost coincident with its chord ; the result is quite analogous with certain cases of chemical change .
