Extract of a Letter , written to the Publisher by M. Denys from Paris , May 1 .
1673 ; giving notice of an admirable Liquor , instantly stopping the Blood of Arteries pricked or cut , without any suppuration , or without leaving any scar or cicatrice .
SIR , WE are now busy , by the King 's order , in making Experiments , whence the world is like to receive great benefit .
It is needless to prepare you for it by putting you in mind of the difficulty there is in stopping the Blood of Arteries , pricked or cut .
Mean time here hath been found out an admirable Essence , which being applied to any Artery whatsoever , stops the blood instantly without any need of binding up the wound .
We have first experimented it upon Dogs , of whom we cut the Crural and Carotid arteries and the Thigh it self ; and the blood stopped in less time than needs to read this Letter .
It is a remedy which is not corrosive ; the wound healing without any scar , suppuration , or cicatrice .
We have also made Trials upon Men , of whom the Temporal arteries were opened ; and upon others , whose hands and face had been cut : And it succeeded with them as well as it did upon dogs .
You may judge , how useful this Essence is like to prove in Armies , where most men dye for want of a good remedy to stop the blood .
This Liquor works not only outwardly , but also being taken inwardly ; for it stops the Loss of blood in faeminis , Inveterate fluxes of blood , open Hemorrhoides , and other Hemorrhagies .
Now that this Remedy hath been well tried in the presence of all the Court , and of many of our best Physicians and Chirurgions , that have admired it ; the King hath given a privilege to sell it in his Armies and throughout the whole Kingdom .
So far this Letter ; which being confirmed by those of two others , persons of good credit , of the same place , hath induced the Publisher to desire one of them to send him some of this Essencefor trial .
