" Report of a Geometrical Measurement of the Height of the Aurora Borealis above the Earth .
" By the Rev. James Farquharson , LL. D. , F.R.S. The principal object to which the author directed the inquiries of which he here gives an account , is the determination by geometrical measurement of the height of the aurora borealis , and of the altitude and azimuth of the point to which the streamers seem to converge , and which has been termed the centre of the corona : these latter determinations constituting important data for enabling us to form a clear conception of the whole definite arrangement and progress of the meteor , and also a correct judgement of the degree of reliance to be placed on the methods employed for measuring its height above the earth .
The paper is chiefly occupied with the details of the observations made or collected by the author , with their critical dis ?
cussion , with the correction of some misapprehensions which have existed respecting the views stated by the author in his former papers , and with a reply to the strictures of M. Arago on those views .
The result of the geometrical measurement of one particular au ?
rora , gave as the height of its upper edge , 5693 feet above the level of the Manse at Alford ; and the vertex of its arch was found to be 14,831 feet northward of the same place .
The vertical extension of the fringe of streamers was 3212 feet ; leaving 2481 feet for the height of the lower edge above the level of Alford .
The tops of the Corean hills , immediately under the aurora , are about 1000 feet higher than that level ; so that the lower edge of the arch was only 1500 feet above the summit of that range of hills .
