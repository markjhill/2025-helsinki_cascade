F.I.C. ( Communicated by Prof. H. E. Armstrong , F.R.S. Received March 28 , 1919 .
) The object of the present communication is , firstly , to compare the behaviour of unsaturated fatty oils towards hydrogen , in presence of finely disseminated nickel , with that of glucosides , towards water , in presence of enzymes \ secondly , to emphasise the remarkable analogy that is apparent between these two different types of interaction .
The nature of enzymes and of their action as hydrolytic agents has been fully discussed by one of us , * in conjunction with H. E. Armstrong .
The main thesis put forward , in the communication referred to , involves the assumption that enzymic hydrolysis is an operation which takes place at the pseudo-solid surfaces of colloid particles suspended in a solution of the hydrolyte\#151 ; not between substances in actual solution , as in the case of soluble acids and the soluble glucosides .
It was long customary to regard these two cases of change as similar in form and as mass-action effects .
In the course of the extended inquiry into the action of urease on urea , by Armstrong and Hortonf and by Armstrong , Benjamin and Horton , J however , results were brought to light which could not well be interpreted otherwise than on the assumption , first put forward by Duelaux , that the hydrolysis took place at a practically " linear rate " and that the approximately " logarithmic rates " observed in most cases of enzymic hydrolysis were the result of interferences with the " linear rate " due to the action of the products of change .
Careful experimental work showed , in fact , that enzymic changes would take place at apparently constant rates were it not that they are subject directly and indirectly to considerable retardation by the products of change .
Urea , for example , is hydrolysed to carbonic acid and ammonia by urease ; when the hydrolysis is effected in presence of an excess of either of these products , the rate is approximately a linear function of the time .
Ammonia has a definite retarding influence on the enzyme ; but if this effect be * 'Roy .

neutralised by introducing an excess of carbonic acid\#151 ; which presumably is too weak an acid to influence the enzyme\#151 ; the change takes place much more rapidly than in the absence of the acid and practically at a linear rate .
On the other hand , hydrolysis conditioned by acids is a bimolecular process , effected by the breakdown of a system composed of the hydrolyte , the catalyst and water ; as such it follows the laws of mass action , its rate being expressed by the well-known logarithmic law .
Hence no analogy exists between the catalytic action of enzymes and of acids ; indeed that of acids is not one in which surface phenomena and colloid structure are concerned .
In the case of the hydrogenation of oils , in presence of nickel , it is beyond cjuestion that the catalyst is active in the solid state ; the fact , that , as will now be shown , action takes place in a manner which is clearly similar to that observed in the case of the hydrolysis of urea under the influence of urease , is the strongest possible argument in favour of the view put " forward to explain the action of this enzyme and indeed of enzymes generally .
The catalytic hydrogenation of liquid fats in presence of nickel has been studied by measuring the volume of hydrogen entering and leaving the system .
In our most recent experiments , this has been effected by water meters designed to measure 2-5 litres of gas per revolution ; it was found that accurate results were obtainable when the gas entering each meter was brought to constant temperature by passage through metal coils immersed in the same water-bath .
The meters were checked against each other before and after each experiment , to guard against constant errors due to the meters not recording with equal accuracy ; they were also calibrated fairly frequently by passing a known volume ( 10 litres ) of hydrogen through them .
The purest obtainable oils of a number of types were used , viz.:\#151 ; Oil .

All the curves , excepting those for olive oil , are characterised by an initial linear segment ; this is followed by an abrupt change of direction to a segment of gentler slope , which is also linear at first but subsequently may exhibit considerable curvature .
The position of the point of inflexion on these curves merits some attention , as it takes place , approximately , at a corresponding part of each curve , at a point when , apparently , only 10-20 per cent , of the glycerides present is derived from acids less saturated than olein .
This is clear when the rates of absorption of hydrogen ( litres per minute ) are compared for various portions of the curves :\#151 ; ' Oil .

The case of olive oil , which contains but little linolein , is complicated by the change of direction taking place almost immediately after the commencement of the action , so that the exact point of inflexion is very difficult to determine .
Oils from various sources , consisting of mixtures of closely allied unsaturated glycerides , are hydrogenated , broadly speaking , at a constant rate until only about 10-20 per cent , of glycerides more unsaturated than olein is left , after which an abrupt change occurs .
Soon , however , the rate settles down^again to approximate constancy ; then , after an interval , it gradually declines , as a state of saturation is approached .
We have , therefore , to distinguish two well-defined linear components of the curves , namely , ( 1 ) the portion corresponding to glycerides more unsaturated than olein , ( 2 ) the part representing the hydrogenation of olein .
In fact , the course of the change is to a great extent specific , that is to say , dependent on the nature of the unsaturated organic compound .
Turning to a more general interpretation of the curves , it is seen that these never approach the logarithmic type required for a unimolecular action , whilst they conform still less to those representative of bi- or ter-molecular i A Study of Catalytic Actions at Solid Surfaces .
143 actions .
On the other hand , over the greater portion of their course , they must represent , to comply with the law of mass action , the measurement of some change in which the acting mass is constant ; it would therefore appear that either the rate of action of the catalyst or ( possibly ) that of the hydrogen is being portrayed , since these are the only substances present whose concentration can remain unchanged .
Further consideration of the above data have led us to the opinion , ( i ) that the agent in question is the catalyst ; ( ii ) that the process of catalytic hydrogenation , in the solid liquid state , involves the primary formation of an unstable complex or " intermediate compound " between nickel and the unsaturated organic compound ; the following is a necessarily condensed outline of the reasoning we have adopted :\#151 ; If the acting mass measured be hydrogen , the following changes are possible:\#151 ; ( i ) Direct Interaction of Hydrogen and Fat at the Unsaturated Linkage .
This case is excluded , as , on the one hand , such an action is infinitely slow , except in presence of a catalyst ; whilst , on the other hand , if we assume that the catalyst does not play a chemical part but merely acts in virtue of some physical peculiarity of its surface , the interaction should follow either a " unimolecular " or a " bimolecular " course .
( ii ) Primary Formation of a Nickel-Hydrogen Complex , followed by Interaction of the Latter and the Unsaturated Organic Compound .
In this case , if the speed of each component action be of the same order , the absorption-time-curves cannot be linear , since the rate of interaction of the nickel-hydrogen complex and the unsaturated compound must affect the equilibrium of the first action .
If the rate of the second action be so great that the absorption measured is only an indication of the speed of formation of the supposed complex , the latter , being independent of any factors but nickel and hydrogen , should lead to identical absorption-time-curves throughout ; moreover , in particular , the well-marked point of inflexion on the curve ( corresponding directly to a definite phase in the composition of the partly saturated glycerides ) would be quite out of the question .
Accordingly , this explanation is in direct conflict with observed facts .
If , conversely , the rate of the second interaction be much slower than that of the first and is thus the actual chemical change that is being measured , then , unless the concentration of the nickel-hydrogen complex be throughout very much greater than the " concentration of the unsaturated complex " ( which is improbable , if only by reason of the small proportion of nickel X44 Drs. E. F. Armstrong and T. P. Hilditch .
present ) , the effect of the latter , which is of course rapidly decreasing , must make itself felt so that the resulting action will appear to be either uni-molecular or bimolecular .
If the acting mass measured be nickel , we may have ( ii ) Primary Formation of a Nickel-Hydrogen Complex , etc. , as dealt with in the preceding ; or ( iii ) Primary Interaction of Nickel and Fat at the Unsaturated Linkage followed by Further Action of Hydrogen on the Unstable System so Produced and the Formation of a Saturated Fatty Compound and Regenerated Nickel .
Here , again , if the experimental data were a measure of the first phase of the change , it is difficult to see how linear graphs could result , bearing in mind the diminishing concentration of the unsaturated constituent .
If , however , the formation of the assumed complex ( Hi lead \#151 ; CH : CH\#151 ; ) were a preponderatingly fast equilibrium interaction with the balance strongly in favour of the unassociated constituents , it is possible that any variation in the speed of formation of the complex would be negligible in comparison with the slower rate of the second ( measured ) action ; at the same time , it is also possible that the various complexes formed by nickel with the different unsaturated glycerides present would be acted on by hydrogen at varying rates , thus allowing for linear segments of varying slope .
We have observed that , when hydrogen containing small quantities of carbon monoxide is used to hydrogenate oil , the emerging gas is deprived of the carbon monoxide but contains , as near as we can ascertain , an equivalent quantity of methane ; in other words , the carbon monoxide has been hydrogenated during its passage through the oil:\#151 ; Temperature of experiment .

Moreover , the amount of change effected is as much , if not more , than the amount which takes place under similar conditions in absence of oil .
Sabatier* * ' La Catalyse en Chimie Organique , ' p. 66 .
A Study of Catalytic Actions at Solid Surfaces .
145 states that carbon monoxide and hydrogen commence to interact , forming methane and water , in presence of finely-divided nickel , at about 190 ' C. , the action becoming rapid only at and above 230'-250 ' C. ; we have confirmed this statement .
In the case of the hydrogenation of vapours of unsaturated substances , Sabatier* has also emphasised the fact that the action is absolutely inhibited by any film of liquid condensed on the nickel .
We therefore consider that it is possible that a small quantity of nickel carbonyl is formed and that this , in solution in the oil .
is decomposed by the hydrogen , forming methane , water and nickel ; again , therefore , we have combination between nickel and an unsaturated compound preceding hydrogenation of the latter .
We may cite here a further fact which , in common with the well-marked character of the " linolein " and " olein " linear segments of the preceding curves , indicates the dependence of catalytic hydrogenation on the specific type of the unsaturated organic compound : the optimum temperature of hydrogenation is not the same for all compounds in presence of nickel , as might be expected if the catalysis depended merely on the presentation under certain special conditions of hydrogen by the catalyst to the organic compound .
Thus , whilst the simpler olefines and acetylene , according to Sabatier , are most smoothly hydrogenated to the corresponding paraffins at about 150 ' C. , the hydrogenation of unsaturated glycerides and of the ben-zenoid nucleus proceeds best at 170'-180 ' C. ; again the reduction of carbon monoxide to methane does not proceed rapidly till about 230'-250 ' C. It is interesting , in this connection , that copper , which does not form a copper carbonyl derivative , is unable to effect the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide , although it is active in converting many olefines into paraffins in presence of hydrogen .
An instance has been given by Schlenck ( D.E.P. 292310 ) of a definite metallic compound of sodium with an ethylenic linkage , which is comparable with that of an unstable nickel-unsaturated-organic-compound-complex which we have outlined above .
Stilbene , when treated in solution in an inert medium with finely-divided sodium , in absence of oxygen , water or carbon dioxide , was observed to give a compound C6H5.CHNa .

The general aspect of the curves obtained for catalytic hydrogenation is markedly similar to those obtained in the case of enzymes and they undoubtedly represent related phenomena .
In each case , the catalyst ( enzyme or reduced nickel ) unites primarily with the organic compound about * Ibid. , p. 56 .

to undergo change ( hydrolyte or unsaturated glyceride)j the complex so formed being decomposed by the other component of the interaction ( water or hydrogen ) .
In each case , moreover , action takes place entirely at the surface of minute particles and the activity of the catalyst depends entirely on the production of the maximum surface and the avoidance of impurities likely to destroy or dirty this surface .
In attempting to explain the nature of the influence of the nickel catalyst in promoting the hydrogenation of fatty oils , we see no reason to depart from the view laid down in the discussion of enzyme action referred to , that the interchanges take place in an electrolytic circuit in which the interacting substances are necessarily all comprised .
The hydrogen and the fatty oil are both to be thought of as coupled with the nickel and the interaction as brought about through the inclusion in the system of the electrolyte required to establish a conducting circuit .
Both hydrogen and the fatty oil are to be regarded as having some affinity for the catalyst ; and the rate of change is to be considered as determined by the rate at which the less active ( hydrogen ) enters into productive association with the catalyst .
A gradual falling-off in the rate of change is to be anticipated\#151 ; greater probably than that observed in aqueous solutions\#151 ; owing to the slowness with which diffusion would take place in the oily medium and the consequent growth of mechanical interference due to the diminution of the amount of the unsaturated compounds and increase of the saturated ; also , it is to be supposed that the specific attractive influence of the nickel for the unsaturated organic compound would diminish as the degree of unsaturation of the oils were lowered , as indeed is definitely indicated by our experimental results .
