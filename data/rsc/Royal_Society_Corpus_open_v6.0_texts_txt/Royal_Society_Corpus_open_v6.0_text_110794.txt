A letter from Prof. Hanson to G. B. Airy , Esq. , F.R.S. , A.R. , was also read , " On a New Method of computing the Perturbations of the Planets whose eccentricities and inclinations are not small .
" Communicated by G. B. Airy , Esq. , F.R.S. The author announces that he has found a method by which the absolute perturbations of planets for any given time , with any given eccentricity and inclination of the orbit , may be calculated ; and he exemplifies his method by applying it to the computation of the per ?
turbations produced by Saturn on the comet of Encke , in every point of its orbit ; a problem of which hitherto there existed no solution .
