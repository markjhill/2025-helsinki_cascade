] The present may be regarded as an addition to those reasons which the author lately gave for placing the Lamprey and Myxine in a rank intermediate between fishes and vermes ; for instead of having distinct sexes , as is the case in perfect fish , Sir Everard Home observes that they are hermaphrodite .
He finds that the organs , which have been hitherto taken for kidneys in supposed females , are in reality testicles , and that the supposed males are really fish without spawn , in consequence of their not breeding two seasons together .
