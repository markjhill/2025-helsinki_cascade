" On the Properties of Electro-deposited Antimony " ( concluded ) .

( Abstract .
) In this communication the author has described two additional kinds of electro-deposited antimony possessing the property of evolving heat ; one of them is obtained from a solution of bromide , and the other from a solution of iodide of antimony ; there is also given additional information respecting the peculiar heating-antimony obtained from the aqueous terchloride .
The following is a brief statement and comparison of some of the properties of the three kinds of thermically active antimony .
The specific gravity of the chloride deposit is 5*8 , the bromide one 5'44 , and the one from the iodide 5'25 .
The amount of heat evolved is greatest with the one from the chloride solution , and least with that from the iodide ; the former evolves all its heat at 60 ?
Fahr. , by contact with a red-hot wire , the bromide one at 280 ?
Fahr. , whilst the iodide one requires a temperature of 340 ?
Fahr. ; the latter also acquires a reddish-brown colour by exposure to solar light .
The chloride deposit contains about 6'3 per cent. of saline matter , the bromide one about 20 , and the one from the iodide liquid about 22'2 .
The quantities deposited by a single equivalent of zinc were about 42*5 in the chloride , 50 in the bromide , and 51 in the iodide solution .
The explanation proposed of their formation is , that the antimony in depositing , being in the " c nascent " state , combines chemically in a feeble manner with the saline ingredients of the electrolyte ; but the complete sources of the evolved heat remain undecided .
