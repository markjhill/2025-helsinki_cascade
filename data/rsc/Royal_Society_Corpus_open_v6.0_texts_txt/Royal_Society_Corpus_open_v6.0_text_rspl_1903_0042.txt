( Abstract .
) The author discusses the experiments in Dr. W. J. Russell 's paper , * finding from optical examination of the phenomena that the dust falls out from the layer of air creeping along the lower side of the plate , and this dust-free layer of air turns round the edges of the plate and flows over and in contact with its upper surface , so protecting it from any deposit of dust where the current has sufficient horizontal motion ; but deposition takes place where the motion is checked by the currents meeting , or where obstructions cause eddies and break the stream-lines , or by anything that tends to prevent the dustless layer of air flowing over the upper surface of the plate .

" By J. C. Graham .

In order to get the solution of the salt below the pure water which is above it , without any intermixing at their common surface , the apparatus was used which is shown in fig. 1 .
A is a cylindrical glass vessel containing a solution of the salt to be investigated , in the lower half , and containing pure water in the upper half .
The internal diameter of the vessel was about 125 mm. , and* the depth of the cylindrical part about 300 mm. B is a tube which passes up through the bottom of the vessel , and is continued outside in the manner shown .
C is a tube which opens into the lowest part of the vessel and is connected with a funnel Ci .
D is a small tube which passes up the centre of the vessel to the point Di .
The vessel is first completely filled with pure water through the funnel Ci , until it has risen to the point marked Dx ; the cocks X3 and X4 being closed , and the cocks Xx and Xj open .
