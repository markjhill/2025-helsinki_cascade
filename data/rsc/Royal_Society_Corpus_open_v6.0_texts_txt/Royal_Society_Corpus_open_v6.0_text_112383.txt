It is hoped that on some future occasion further results , derived from an intercomparison of these curves , may be presented to the Society .

" On the reappearance of some periods of Declination Disturbance at Lisbon during two , three , or several days .
" By Senhor CAPELLO , of the Lisbon Observatory .
Communicated by BALFOU : R STEWAIT , LL. D. Received October 28 , 1868 .
Any one who carefully examines the magnetograph curves must often notice that there are , during periods of disturbance , synchronous movements of the needle during corresponding hours for two , three , or more days .
In some cases the repetition is only in two or three parallel movements , in others there are true periods of some hours in duration .
The repeated periods are not entirely similar , their phases being in general so modified that in some cases their identity can only be recognized by a very minute investigation .
The same periods , when repeated , have not always the same total duration ; nor do they recommence at the same precise hour , but sometimes earlier , and sometimes later , the differences varying from a few minutes to two or three hours .
There is also to be remarked in the repeateed disturbances a tendency to modify in form , or to level their peaks and hollows , or , on the contrary , to augment the angular forms .

W.We rt tirp Pln1 T. We also see that the greatest number of repetitions belong to the night hours , that is to say , those hours when the movements of the needle are easterly .
In the morning hours there do not appear to be any wellmarked repetitions .
I append examples chosen from the five years complete ( July 1863 to June 1868 ) of the declination curves of the Observatory at Lisbon ( see Plates V. &amp; VI .
) .
A greater number of cases might be quoted , but those I have chosen are sufficient for our purpose .
Meanwhile I must mention that , in the majority of instances , where no relation apparently exists between one disturbance and the disturbances of the days preceding and following , the disturbances are generally violent .
There are twenty-four examples , fifteen of which show repetition on two days , eight on thiee days , and one only where the curve appears repeated for four days .
In order that the identity may be easily recognized , I have placed the curves with their corresponding periods vertical , the hours being marked on each curve .
It appears that all the facts exhibited in these examples agree with the cosmical theory ; the cause ( existing in the sun or in space ) appears to continue sometimes during two , three , or several days without undergoing remarkable transformations .
The repetition , being sometimes earlier , sometimes later , seems also to indicate that the cause possesses a proper movement ; the cause persists , but only comes again into operation when the earth by its diurnal rotation is placed in a similar position or conjunction to that of the preceding days .
It would be very curious to analyze the photographs of the sun so as to see if there were any spots in the days of the examples , and if these spots remained without sensible alteration during the days when the disturbances remained so similar .
Semaarcs by B. STEWART .
I have compared Senhor Capello 's curves with the corresponding traces of the declination at Kew , and it would appear that the Lisbon disturbances are almost invariably reproduced at Kew at the same time , only to a greater extent .
It would fuarther appear that the same amount of similarity which the various Lisbon curves exhibit is also exhibited in the corresponding Kew curves .
Opinions may differ with regard to the strength of the evidence exhibited by Senhor Capello in support of the peculiar action of the disturbing forces of which he is an advocate .
It would appear to me that the strongest point in favour of the hypothesis is not so much the repetition of a single disturbance as the repetition of a complicated disturbance in most if not all of its sinuosities .
Several examples of this occur in these diagrams .
