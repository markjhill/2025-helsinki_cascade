Observations on the Human Urethra , showing its internal Structure , as it appeared in the Microscope of F. Bauer , Esq. By Sir Everard Home , Bart. V.P.R.S. Read June 1 , 1820 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1820 , p. 183 .
] Mr. Bauer has discovered , by the aid of the microscope , that the , human urethra is made up of two parts , an internal membrane and an external muscular covering ; the former , very thin and destitute of fibres , is thrown into folds in a collapsed state , and upon its surface are numerous orifices of glands ; the latter is made up of short interwoven fibres , forming fasciculi united by an elastic substance of the consistence of mucus : these observations show the fallacy of the common opinion , that the lining of the urethra consists of circular contractile fibres , and throw a new light upon the disease called Stricture ; a spasmodic stricture being a contraction of a small portion of the longitudinal muscular fibres , while the others are relaxed ; and a permanent stricture consisting in the exudation of coagulable lymph , in consequence of inflammation , between the fasciculi of muscular fibres and upon the internal membrane .
After adverting to what is known respecting the structure of the corpus spongiosum , and corpora cavernosa , the author proceeds to state the result of Mr. Bauer 's examination of those parts .
The cellular structure of the corpora cavernosa is made up of many thin membranous plates , very elastic , and so connected as to form a trellis-work , the edge of which is attached to the elastic ligamentous substance which surrounds them , and which forms the septum that separates them .
The structure of the corpus spongiosum resembles that of the corpora cavernosa , except that the parts are formed upon a smaller scale , and that there are no muscular fibres in its ligamentous elastic covering .
The various details and descriptions in this paper are illustrated by Mr. Bauer 's drawings .
