GEORGE RENNIE , Esq. , Treasurer and V.P. , in the Chair , " A Practical Extension of the application of the Law of Mortality announced by B. Gompertz , Esq. , in the Philosophical Transactions for 1823 .
" By A. M. Drach , Esq. Communicated by B. Gompertz , Esq. , F.R.S. In endeavouring to verify the theoretical law of mortality , announced by Mr. Gompertz , by means of constants derived from the results of the English census of 1841 , which are contained in the sixth Annual Report of the Registrar-General , and which furnish an extended basis for computation , the author found the accordance between the two to be so remarkably close as to justify the assumption that Mr. Gompertz 's formula expresses the true law of the decrement of human life .
The paper is occupied with the analytical details of this investigation .
