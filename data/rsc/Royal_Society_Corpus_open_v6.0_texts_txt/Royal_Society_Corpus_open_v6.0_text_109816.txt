On the Means of producing a double Distillation by the same heat .

] When steam is passed through a tube surrounded with water , it is well known that it becomes condensed on the sides of the tube so long as the water continues at a lower temperature than that of the steam ; but since the latent heat given out in the condensation of steam soon raises the temperature of the water to 2120 , all transfer of heat ceases at that temperature , and the steam then passes uncondensed .
But since the temperature at which water may be raised into vapour depends on the pressure of the atmosphere , the temperature of the surrounding water may be kept permanently lower , by removing that pressure , so as permanently to act in condensing the vapour of the first distillation ; and being itself raised into vapour by mere transfer of the same original quantity of heat , may be received as an additional product of the same process , by a suitable arrangement of the apparatus .
For this purpose , the vessel which serves as condensing worm-tub to the first distillation requires to be fitted with a head and a receiver , all perfectly air-tight ; and it may with most convenience be so constructed , that , by application of heat in the first instance to this vessel , the water within may be made to boil completely , so that the air within it will be thereby expelled , and , by a valve or cock , may be prevented from returning when the heat is withdrawn .
