) In Part V of these Studies* much evidence was adduced showing that a close relationship is traceable between the substituted sulphonic chlorides and bromides generally of the form C6H3R1R2 .
SO2X , as these may all be referred to equivalence parameters , varying between narrow limits , similar in two directions to those deduced for benzene itself , the change in the third being such as may be expected to follow from the introduction of the group SO2X .
It is obviously desirable to consider also cases in which X is a more complex radicle than either Cl or Br .
A few of these have been dilcussed in Part V. Certain benzenesulphonates were considered in two previous communications of the series :j* apparently the results justify conclusions in harmony with those arrived at in the case of the simple sulphochlorides and bromides .
But in view of the marked influence which halogens exert on the properties of the benzenesulphonic acids and of the manner in which the amount of " water of crystallisation " often varies as the metal is varied , it appeared to be desirable to study sulphonates generally as systematically as sulphonic chlorides and bromides have been studied .
We have directed our attention specially , in the first instance , to salts of dyad metals , on account of the observations made with reference to these salts in Part IY\#151 ; for the following reasons .
Of late years much attention has been paid to the so-called complex salts , particularly by Werner , who has obtained results of very special interest .
Such salts are formed with peculiar readiness by metals of the iron group .

expressions of the chemical behaviour of the salts , cannot be regarded as satisfactory or perhaps even as possible representations of their molecular structure .
We stand urgently in need of special methods of determining structure in such cases ; the study of salts formed by the metals referred to in various ways is therefore of particular interest .
We have represented ( No. IY , p. 310 ) the structure of sulphonates of the dyad metals provisionally in the manner shown in fig. 1 , in which the shaded portion represents the region occupied by the sulphonic radicles and the water of crystallisation , the metal being at the " centre " of the system.* Assuming the metallic atom to be placed at the " centre " of the system in the manner shown , it appeared probable that the direction in which the metallic atoms were stacked in the crystal might prove to be one having special properties , in the case of a magnetic metal such as iron , for example .
We had in mind Faraday 's demonstration of " magnecrystallic polarity " in various substances , notably in ferrous sulphate .
In the expectation that the parameter would prove to be such an axis , we determined the effect of a magnetic field on several ferrous sulphonates .
On suspending the crystals between the poles of a magnet of moderate strength , so that one or other of the three axial directions was in a vertical position , the direction of maximum magnetic permeability was found to be along x when the crystal was suspended with either or vertical , and along y when x was vertical , therefore at right angles to the z parameter .
In the case of ferrous sulphate , as stated by Faraday , we found that the crystal was affected specially in only one direction .
On examining salts of the other magnetic metals , however , we found their magnetic behaviour to be so different from that of the iron salts that we have been led to devote our attention more particularly to the problem thus disclosed , especially as the property referred to has proved to be of unexpected significance as an aid to the interpretation of crystalline form .
* It is necessary to make slight changes in the figure if it is to correspond to the values given later on ( p. 489 ) .

465 In our experiments the comparison has always been made between strictly isomorphous salts .
The salts compared have been sulphates , double sulphates of ammonium and the dyad metals , benzene- and toluene-sulphonates , parachloro- , parabromo- and pariodobenzenesulphonates .
Certain other salts of different type have also been examined tentatively .
Hitherto we have made only qualitative observations .
It so happened that the magnet with which we made our first experiments affected iron and cobalt salts readily but was without perceptible action on the corresponding salts of zinc and magnesium and even on those of manganese ; salts of nickel were but slightly affected , as were those of copper and to about an equal extent .
The salts that were unaffected by this magnet could be directed by a stronger field .
The electromagnet used has flat poles facing one another , 6'4 cm .
apart ; it was found necessary , however , to concentrate the field by facing each pole with a rectangular block of soft iron , thus reducing the distance between the poles to 1-9 cm .
The flux density of the field used was 2400 lines per square centimetre .
The area of the face of each pole ( 7'7 x 4'75 cm .
) was such that the field between them must have been sensibly uniform .
The crystal to be examined was suspended , so that free rotation was possible , from a suitable support , by a single strand of artificial silk fastened by means of a hook of copper wire to a paper stirrup .
The crystal could be fixed in any desired position upon the stirrup by means of a tiny pellet of plasticine or vaseline .
Faraday 's original observations were made with bismuth and were subsequently extended to ferrous sulphate and a few other substances .
At about the same time , Pliicker carried out similar experiments principally with minerals .
Faraday formed the opinion that crystals possess what he termed a magnecrystallic axis .
In some cases , this axis set along the lines of force\#151 ; axially ; in others at right angles to the lines of force\#151 ; equatorially ; ferrous sulphate , a magnetic salt , behaved in the former manner ; bismuth , a strongly diamagnetic substance , in the latter.* Pliicker was of opinion that a definite relationship was traceable between the magnetic and the optical properties of crystals .
His views were adversely criticised by Knoblauch and Tyndallf and at a later date , Grailich * ' Electrical Researches , ' 1848-1850 , xxii , xxiii , xxvi .
+ ' Phil. Mag. , ' 1850 , p. 1 .
The whole of Tyndall 's work ( 1850-1856 ) on the subject is published in a special volume , ' Diamagnetism and Magnecrystallic Action ' ( Longmans , Green and Co. , London ) .
Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Bodd .
and von Lang* also came to the conclusion that there is no obvious relationship between the optical and magnetic properties of crystals .
According to Knoblauch and Tyndall , a relationship exists between the direction of the cleavage plane of a crystal and the manner in which it sets in the magnetic field ; all the crystals they examined , whether paramagnetic or diamagnetic , set in a definite manner when the field was sufficiently powerful .
In the case of paramagnetic substances , the cleavage plane set in the axial plane , i.e.with the perpendicular thereto across the lines of force ; whilst in that of diamagnetic substances this plane was found to set in the equatorial plane , with its perpendicular along the lines of force from pole to pole .
Of the few examples adduced in support of this view , the most striking are those afforded by the isomorphous sulphates of magnesium , zinc and nickel ; the first two are diamagnetic and set with the cleavage plane equatorially : the last is paramagnetic and sets with its cleavage plane axially .
The first crystal which we examined , one of ferrous tolueneparasulphonate , proved to be an exception to the principle enunciated by Knoblauch and Tyndall , as it set with its cleavage plane in the equatorial plane , a behaviour characteristic , according to them , of diamagnetic substances .
Many similar exceptions were subsequently discovered .
Even ferrous sulphate sets with its cleavage plane in the equatorial plane , a fact unaccountably overlooked by Tyndall , Faraday having described its behaviour in the magnetic field as accurately as was possible without mentioning crystallographic details .
To judge from our observations , the direction of maximum permeability in paramagnetic substances may lie either in the cleavage plane or perpendicular thereto : and in some cases , the cleavage plane sets either axially or equatorially according to the direction in which the crystal is suspended .
Apparently no simple relationship obtains between the cleavage plane and the magnetic properties of crystals .
The apparent connexion no doubt arises from the fact that both the direction of maximum permeability and the cleavage plane or its perpendicular are important directions in the crystal structure .
The only systematic attempt that has been made to determine the orientation of crystals in a magnetic field with respect to their crystallographic axes appears to be that of Grailich and von Lang.f These authors examined over 30 orthorhombic substances , by suspending them successively with the axes a , b , and c in the vertical position , then observing in each case which of the other two axes set axially and which equatorially .

467 however , they chose their material in a haphazard manner : consequently no general conclusions can be drawn from the observations .
They devised a system of symbols to indicate the magnetic properties of a crystal .
If , in the case of a paramagnetic substance , the strongest tendency were for the axis b to set axially and if , when b was vertical , set axially , the symbol 7T ( bat ) was given to the substance , ir denoting a paramagnetic substance and .
the order of the letters the order in which the axes stand with respect to their power of transmitting the magnetic force .
In the case of diamagnetic substances , the symbol 8 is used instead of r , the order of the letters indicating the power of transmitting " diamagnetic force , " the first letter indicating which axis sets equatorially with the greatest force .
Not only is the assumption of two kinds of magnetic force , diamagnetic and paramagnetic , unwarranted but the system of symbols does not apply , in many cases , to monosymmetric crystals , which sometimes set with a direction between the crystallographic axes along or at right angles to the lines of force .
The Magnetic Properties of Salts of Dyad Metals .
For the purposes of this inquiry , we have specially prepared and measured iron , cobalt and nickel salts of benzenesulphonic , tolueneparasulphonic , paraehloro- , bromo- and iodobenzenesulphonic and paradiehlorobenzene-sulphonic acids .
The observations made with these and other similar salts are recorded in this section .
Ferrous sulphate , FeS04.7H20.\#151 ; This salt is monosymmetric ; the axial ratios are :\#151 ; a :b \ c \#151 ; 1*1828 : 1 : 1*5427 .
/ 3 = 104 ' 16$ ; There is a perfect plane of cleavage parallel to c{001 } , When the crystal is suspended from any point in the zone ab , so that c{001 } is in a vertical plane , it sets very strongly with the face c{001 } parallel to the pole of the magnet , i.e. , in the equatorial plane ; when suspended so that c{001 } is horizontal , the axis b sets axially but is weakly directed .
Cobalt sulphate , CoS04.7H20.\#151 ; This salt is isomorphous with ferrous sulphate .
a :b : c \#151 ; 1*1815 : 1 : 1*5325 .
/ 3 = 104 ' 40 ' ( Marignac ) .
The plane of cleavage is c{001 } .
When the crystal is suspended in the magnetic field with its cleavage plane vertical , this plane sets axially .
In the case of ferrous sulphate , the cleavage plane sets equatorially .
When the cleavage plane is horizontal , the axis b sets equatorially , the axis a setting in the axial direction .
Ferrous ammonium sulphate , FeS04.(NH4)2S04.6H20.\#151 ; This substance has Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Rod .
recently been subjected to an exhaustive crystallographic examination by Tutton* ; our measurements of well developed crystals , made before we became acquainted with Tutton 's work , agree precisely with his .
The double salt is monosymmetric , the axial ratios being :\#151 ; .
a : b : c = 0-7377 : 1 : 0-4960 .
0 = 106 ' 50 ' .
The crystals cleave fairly readily parallel to r{201 } .
The behaviour of the crystals in a magnetic field is highly interesting .
The most important plane in the crystal ( magnetically ) is r{201 } .
So long as the crystal is suspended with r{201 } in a vertical plane , the crystal sets strongly with this plane in the axial plane , the perpendicular thereto setting across the lines of force .
If , however , the plane r{201 } be horizontal , the crystal sets weakly with the axis of symmetry 5 across the lines of force .
On contrasting these results with the observations of St. Meyer , as interpreted by Tuttonf , upon the crystallisation of this salt in a magnetic field , it appears that tabular crystals are formed , growing on r{201 } , which are all so deposited that the shorter diagonal , which is parallel to the plane of symmetry , coincides with the direction of the lines of force .
The crystals are therefore orientated precisely as they set when suspended in a magnetic field so that r{201 } is horizontal .
It may well be that such crystals are first formed floating freely in the liquid and are orientated before they take up a stationary position upon the bottom of the vessel .
Our observations also raise anew the question , which was discussed by Tutton , as to the correct setting of crystals of this salt and of other members of the series .
Gr .
Wulff , j on account of the remarkable predominance of the form r{201 } in ferrous ammonium sulphate , considers this to be a fundamental form and proposes to make it the basal plane c{001 } .
Tutton , however , taking into account the complete isomorphous series to which this salt belongs , prefers to adhere to the original setting proposed by Murmann and Rotter .
S Our observations , however , emphasize the importance of the plane r{201 } particularly in the cases of ferrous and of cobalt ammonium sulphate .
This evidence , together with the fact that the plane is the principal cleavage plane throughout the series , inclines us to prefer Wulffs setting .
Further discussion of this point must , however , be reserved .
Cobalt ammonium sulphate , CoSO^NH^SCh .

We find the magnetic behaviour to be directly opposed to that of the isomorphous ferrous salt .
The cleavage plane y{201 } , when in a vertical plane , always sets in the equatorial plane _ very strongly with its perpendicular along the lines of force ; when r{201 } is horizontal , the axis of symmetry b sets axially , along the lines of force .
Cobalt ammonium selenate , CoSeOi^NH^aSeCh .
GH^O .
This salt corre sponds in magnetic behaviour with cobalt ammonium sulphate .
The tendency of the axis b to set axially when r{201 } is horizontal seems , however , to be weaker than in the case of the sulphate .
Such observations are evidence of the need of quantitative experiments in connection with the work .
Nickel ammonium sulphate and Copper ammonium sulphate.\#151 ; These two isomorphous salts behave similarly when suspended in the magnetic field .
( 1 ) When c{001 } is horizontal , the axis b sets equatorially .
( 2 ) When the plane a{100 } is horizontal ( this face not being developed ) , the axis b sets axially .
( 3 ) When the axis b is vertical , the plane a{100 } sets in the equatorial plane .
The point of interest about these observations is that , whereas in the case of the isomorphous ferrous and cobalt salts the plane r{201 } sets in the one case axially and in the other equatorially , in the nickel and copper salts this plane seems to have lost its influence on the setting of the crystals , as when b is vertical the plane a { 100 } sets equatorially .
Ferrous benzenesulphonate , ( CeHsSO^Te .
GHsO.\#151 ; This salt crystallises from water in well developed tablets , of a pale green colour , generally growing on a{100 } , thin in the direction of the a axis .
The crystals are similar in appearance to those of cobalt tolueneparasulphonate ( fig. 6 ) .
Sometimes growth takes place on #{011 } or m{110 } , so that the crystals have a prismatic habit .
One of the faces a{100 } generally gives multiple reflections , owing to the presence of vicinal faces .
The reflections from the other forms are usually good , particularly from gjOll } .

The crystals are affected even by a weak magnetic field ; their behaviour , deduced from that of many specimens of different shapes and sizes , was very uniformly as follows:\#151 ; Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Podd .
Vertical axis Setting in magnetic field Axial Equatorial a b c b a c c a b The axis a tends strongly to set axially .
This is well shown on suspending the crystal with b horizontal and a inclined at various angles to the vertical ; the tendency of a or its horizontal component to set axially then opposes the tendency of b to set axially ; but b is always forced into the equatorial position until a is but slightly inclined to the vertical .
Then , as a approaches closely to the vertical , the crystal sets with b in the axial position .
When the axis a sets axially , the face a{100 } , which is the cleavage plane , is in the equatorial plane .
According to Knoblauch and Tyndall 's rule , as the salt is paramagnetic , the cleavage plane should set in the axial plane .

In their magnetic behaviour the crystals correspond with those of cobalt parachloro- and parabromobenzenesulphonate .

When either of the salts is suspended in the magnetic field with the b axis vertical , the crystal sets with the face { 101 } in the equatorial plane in the case of the former , in the axial plane in that of the latter .
Further examination of the crystals , suggested by this last observation , revealed the fact that r{101 } is a plane of cleavage , a fact which had been overlooked in the case of the zinc and magnesium salts .
From these observations it would appear that the plane { 101 } , being so important a plane in the crystal structure , should be chosen as the pinacoid a{100 } ; it would then correspond with the { 100 } plane of the benzene- , toluene- and parahalogenbenzene-sulphonates both in being a cleavage plane and in setting equatorially in the ferrous and axially in the cobalt salt .
The change suggested involves a change of the interaxial angle / 3 , { 101 } becoming { 100 } and { 001 } becoming the new { 101 } .
The axial ratios of the four salts , determined from the new setting , * are as follows:\#151 ; a : b : c ( C6H3Cl2S03)2Mg.8H20 ... ... ... 1-7562 : 1 : 2 0960 78 ' 13* ' ( C6H3Cl2S03)2Zn.8H20 ... ... ... 1*7528 : 1 : 2T055 78 24 ( C6H3Cl2S03)2Fe.8H20 ... ... ... 1*7543 : 1 : 2-1053 78 40 ( C6H3C12S03)2Co.8H20 ... ... ... 1-7456 : 1 : 2*1034 78 15* Ferrous paradiclilorobenzenesulphonate , ( C6H3Cl2S03)2Fe.8H20 .

They were well developed , short , stout prisms , the prism axis being the axis of symmetry .
The two ends of the prism are differently developed , the hemimorphic character of the crystals being clearly shown .
Generally the form { 110 } appeared at both ends : at one end this was accompanied by { 011 } and { 111 } , at the other by { 012 } .
Sometimes { 111 } appeared also .
When a crystal is suspended in the magnetic field , so long as the axis b is Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Rod .

The observations now recorded of the magnetic behaviour of the salts examined are of special interest in that we have found that salts of ferrous iron and of dyad cobalt are very sensitive to magnetic influence , whilst those of nickel are but feebly affected and those of manganese only respond when the field is a very strong one , no more readily than do those of magnesium and zinc .
On the other hand , copper salts are about as sensitive as those of nickel .
The readiness of response is to be correlated perhaps rather with the appearance of colour than with the presence of a magnetic metal in the salt .
The opposite behaviour of iron and cobalt in structures which presumably only differ in having the one or the other metallic atom at the centre of the molecular system is very remarkable .
But it is clear that the constitution of the salt plays an important part in such phenomena .
Whilst the yellow salt potassium ferrocyanide is not in the least disturbed in the field of our weaker magnet , the red ferri-cyanide is powerfully affected .
Strange to say , the very pale yellow salt , potassium cobalticyanide , is unaffected even in the field of our stronger magnet ; several platinocyanides we have tested are also unaffected .
Preliminary observations we have made with several of the pseudotrigonal salts of rare-earth metals ( Nd , Pr , Gd ) described in Part III show that these are more or less powerfully directed .
It is obvious that a wide field for study has been opened up .
We propose to prosecute the inquiry in various directions and.to ascertain Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Rod .
whether magnetic susceptibility is in any way to be correlated with the appearance either of colour or of an unsaturated condition , particularly as this latter is known to influence optical refractive power in a high degree .
JThe special influence exercised by iron and cobalt is the more remarkable in view of the agreement in behaviour of salts of copper , nickel , manganese , zinc and magnesium .
The behaviour of salts of other metals remains to be determined and will be made the subject of systematic study , to ascertain whether or not iron and cobalt stand alone .
As non-isomorphous but morphotropically related salts of a metal have similar magnetic properties in corresponding directions , the magnetic behaviour of crystals may prove to be of great value as a means of discovering relationships in crystalline structure in cases in which these are not immediately obvious\#151 ; several such cases are discussed by us .
Similarly , it is to be anticipated that the magnetic behaviour will be of use , in doubtful cases , in arriving at a correct mode of* setting a crystal .
In orthorhombic crystals , the directions which set either axially or equatorially appear always to correspond with a crystallographic axis ; it will be rational , therefore , in the case of monosymmetric crystals , to apply this principle in selecting axial directions .
The Marshalling of Benzene Units in In Part Y of these studies , we have advanced a very considerable body of evidence that the parameter which presumably is the measure of the thickness of the individual layers of the benzenoid molecules in a crystal has a value very slightly removed from that which it has in benzene itself when the marshalling is hexagonal , viz. 2,78 .
In the second form of marshalling foreseen by Barlow and Pope , * which has rhombohedral symmetry , the layers are supposed to be of less thickness and they have suggested that this form is met with in paradiiodobenzene and a number of similar compounds .
In the third of these studies , on account of the pseudo-trigonal character of various sulphonates of rare earth metals and the very close resemblance they bear to paradiiodobenzene , we were led to assume that in most of the salts examined the low value of the z parameter was evidence of rhombohedral marshalling of the benzene units .
This conclusion was extended to salts of dyad and of some monad metals in Part IY ( p. 308 ) : the silver salt alone appeared to be an exception .
The results recorded in Part Y have led us to think , however , that the z ( and correlatively the y ) dimension may be subject to not inconsiderable fluctuation without an alteration in the marshalling .
In the case of the salts .

485 considered , if the benzene residues are separated in the manner we have suggested to a considerable extent by intervening " blocks " of water of crystallisation , it is to be expected , we should imagine , that these " blocks " would be piled perpendicularly rather than diagonally and would therefore tend to prevent the shear from taking place that is involved in the passage from hexagonal to rhombohedral symmetry .
On the whole , we are inclined to think that the evidence generally favours the view that the dimensions are subject to more or less variation but that the general mode of arrangement remains the same .
Bridgmans recent discovery of a second crystalline form of benzene , stable only under pressure , is not without significance perhaps from this point of view ; it may well be the second form adumbrated by Barlow and Pope .
In any case , the question we raise is one of importance to be considered carefully as opportunity offers .
The Influence and Distribution of Water of .
The salts we have studied have other peculiarities , however , which render them of special interest .
The close relationship between corresponding benzenesulphonates and toluenesulphonates has been pointed out already in Part IV ( p. 307 ) .
The relationship is sufficiently apparent on inspection of the axial ratios ; whilst the introduction of CH3 in the para position has no effect on the ratio it involves a considerable alteration of the ratio : It is therefore clear that , as in the cases discussed in Part V , an extension takes place only in one direction ; when the equivalence parameters are calculated , it appears that the alteration is precisely in the proportion of the alteration of the valency volume from 100 to 112 .
But the axial ratios of the substituted benzenesulphonates containing a single atom of halogen are in no apparent relationship with those of the benzenesulphonates , thus : : 3 I. ( C6H5S03)2Pe.6H20 ... ... ... .

( C6H4ClS03)2Fe.6H20 ... ... .
3*6781 : 1 : 0*9094 94 21| On comparing the magnetic properties of the three salts , however , it appears that , whilst I and II can both be represented by the scheme a\gt ; b\gt ; c , that representing III is a\gt ; c\gt ; 5 .
If now the assumption be made that the directions in crystals which correspond magnetically also correspond geometrically , it is plain that , in order to make III correspond with I and II , Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Podd .
it is necessary to interchange b and c in the case of this substance .
The axial ratios then become:\#151 ; a : b : c ( C6H5S03)2Fe.6H20 ... ... . .
3*5690 1 : 1*1058 0= 86 ' 18 ' ( C6H4CH3S03)2.Fe.6H20 ... ... 3*9972 : 1 : 1*1051 = 88 37 ( C6H4ClS03)2Fe.6H20 ... ... ... 4*0445 : 1 : 1*0996 7 = 94 21$ In the case of all three salts the ratio : is practically constant .
Moreover , when the crystals are regarded from this point of view , the correspondence is complete between all three with regard to habit , to forms developed and to cleavage , as well as in magnetic behaviour figs. 4 and 5 ) .
It is certainly remarkable that the axial ratio of the parachloro-salt is practically the same as that of the toluenesulphonate .
The valency volume of chlorine being unity , a close correspondence is to be expected between the benzenesulphonate and the parachloro-derivative* and , as a matter of fact , it is shown in the previous communication by Mummery ( p. 455 ) that the sulphochlorides C6H4C1.S02C1 , C6H4Br .
S02Cl and C6H4I.S02C1 have equivalence parameters in accordance with this assumption .
It might be argued from this , as the chlorine atom produces the same effect on the ratio : as the methyl group , that Cl and CH3 , not Cl and H , occupy the same volume .
That such a conclusion would be , to say the least , a rash one , however , the following argument will show .
To admit that Cl and CH3 have the same volume would be to return to the view held by Kopp and it would then follow that Br has an atomic volume much greater than that of either , iodine a still greater volume .
Kopp 's values are : CH3 = 27'5 , Cl = 22*7 , Br = 53*4 .
Accepting these , bromine should produce a change more than twice as great as that produced by chlorine ; iodine would produce a still greater change .
The measurements of the three sulphochlorides made by Mummery , referred to above , afford no support to this view ; moreover , in the case of the sulphonates , chlorine , bromine and iodine produce much about the same effect on the ratio a : b , the slight rise as the atomic weight increases agreeing with the slight increase of the size of the sphere of influence of the halogen atom , in passing from chlorine to iodine , suggested by Barlow and Pope .
a : b : c ( C6H5S03)2Fe.6H20 ... ... 3*5690 : 1 : 1*1058 = 86 ' 18 ' ( C6H4ClS03)2Fe.6H20 ... ... 4*0445 : 1 : 1*0996 7 = 94 21$ ( C6H4BrS03)2Fe.6H20 ... ... 4*0964 : 1 : 1*0984 7 = 94 26J ( C6H4IS03)2Fe.6H20 ... ... 4*1670 : 1 : 1*1007 7 = 93 35 * Cf .

487 It must therefore be admitted that the three halogens have practically the same valency volume .
It is still necessary , however , to account for the effect on the crystal structure of the benzenesulphonate of the substitution of hydrogen by halogen .
It will be observed that in each salt ( I , II and III ) in the first table in ' this section , the monosymmetric angle / 3 is not far removed from a right angle ; in fact the departure from orthorhombic symmetry involves only a slight shear .
In the case of I and II , this shear has taken place in one and the same direction in the structure ; in the case of III it is in a direction at right angles to that in which it has taken place in II and III : hence when III is made comparable with I and II , by interchanging the axes b and c , the interaxial angle becomes 7 instead of / 3 .
It is suggested that the peculiarity in the halogen atom which brings about this change , whether it be owing to a slight increase of its sphere of influence over that of the hydrogen atom displaced or whether it be due to the introduction of a new centre of influence , produces some slight readjustment of the constituent units in the structure .
That the modification of internal structure is a very slight one follows from the general similarity of habit found to exist between the ferrous benzenesulphonate and the parachlorobenzenesulphonate .
The net result of the substitution of hydrogen by halogen is to change slightly the shape of the parallelepipedal cell or space lattice , elongating it in one direction and shortening it in the same proportion in the other two , so that the ratio c : b remains unchanged .
But the increase in the one direction , which brings the substituted benzenesulphonates into apparent harmony with the toluenesulphonates , * is so considerable that it is not improbable that a special influence is at work in the case of the former salts and that they are in some respects different in constitution from the benzene- and toluenesulplionates .
The still greater departure of the dichlorosulphonates , obvious in the fact that these contain a larger proportion of water of crystallisation ( 8H2O instead of 6H20 ) , is not without importance from this point of view .
It must not be forgotten that the acids free from halogen differ to a not inconsiderable extent in properties from the substituted acids : the difference is particularly obvious perhaps in the case of the corresponding anhydrides : thus , whereas benzenesulphonic anhydride is described as deliquescent and easily soluble in water , which hydrolyses it readily , the anhydride of the paradibromo-benzenesulphonic acid is insoluble in most solvents and is hydrolysed with difficulty .
Such differences are indications that the forces operative within the molecules are very different : presumably , the " sulphonic region " is the * Not improbably the coincidence is accidental .
Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Rod .
one specially affected and as the " water " is present in this region it is probably subject to these special influences .
The results obtained by Tamman and by Bridgman in recent years are proof that water may undergo great changes in volume and it can scarcely be doubted that the changes in volume are the consequences of alteration in the structure of the complex perhaps more or less of the character pictured by one of us in discussing the nature of water.* It is commonly assumed that , in the case of salts of multivalent metals , the acid radicles are in direct association with the metallic atom , which serves as the link ; the so-called water of crystallisation is pictured , as a rule , as an addition , to the complex .
Our view practically involves the assumption that the metallic atom is at the centre of the system , as space cannot well be found for the water molecules if the metal serve as the direct link .
If the views applied by Armstrong and Worley to sulphuric acidf are applied generally to salts containing water of crystallisation , there is no difficulty in picturing the several molecules of " hydrone " taking up the position of intermediaries and the metallic atom\#151 ; probably in the form of metallic oxide \#151 ; as placed in whatever position its own influence and that of the acidic groups may reciprocally determine .
Prom this point of view , of 'water present in a salt may vary according to the influences at work .
It is assumed by Barlow and Pope that when a variation in volume takes place , the volumes of the different atoms in a molecule vary concomitantly , so that they remain relatively the same ; in other words , the valency-volume is a constant .
It appears to us that , in special cases such as we are considering , in which a molecule is built up of several systems each of which is deformable within certain limits , the one complex may be more or less deformable independently of the other .
The equivalence parameters of the salts under consideration , calculated from the axial ratios without modification , are as follows :\#151 ; * ' Boy .

... ... ... ... \ \ / / 2 The y and z values thus found appear to us to he more in accordance with those deduced as characteristic of a great variety of benzene derivatives in Part Y of these studies than are those calculated from modified values of the axial ratios in Part IY .
Though the z values are relatively high , those of y are correspondingly low ; but the great increase of x , in the case of the substituted benzenesulphonates , appears to need some special explanation such as we now venture to put forward .
[ Note added June 22.\#151 ; We have recently obtained a crystal of ferrous benzenesulphonate\#151 ; a strongly paramagnetic substance\#151 ; ( similar in shape to fig. 3 ) the dimensions of which in the direction of its three axes , , and c , are 1/ 16 " , 1/ 2 " and 1 " respectively .
When suspended with the axis b vertical , this crystal is powerfully directed*so that the a axis sets along the lines of force , though its length in the direction of the c axis\#151 ; which* sets at right angles to the lines of force\#151 ; is 16 times as great as is the length in the direction of a. A crystal of the corresponding paramagnetic cobalt salt of similar shape sets with the c axis along the lines of force .
The behaviour of the iron salt , coupled with the difference between the two salts , is at once a proof that the property we have brought under notice is a function of the internal structure of the crystal and not that of a merely paramagnetic substance .
Moreover , if the dimensions of the crystal in the direction of the different Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. E. H. Podd .
axes be entirely changed by cutting sections , the setting of the mass with respect to the axes of the crystal remains unaltered .
This is true of all the crystals we have examined , whether paramagnetic or diamagnetic .
In view of the known connexion between optical and magnetic phenomena , the possibility that coloured substances might be specially affected in a magnetic field led us to examine the behaviour of crystals of azobenzene , a brilliantly orange-red coloured substance .
Azobenzene is monosymmetric , its axial ratios being a:b:c = 2T076 :1 : 1*3312 .
/ 3 = 65 ' 34'.* A form { 401 } , not recorded by Boeris , is also sometimes apparent .
If the form { 401 } be changed to a{100 } , c{001 } remaining the same , { 100 } becoming { 101 } , the axial ratios are a : b : c = 2*1076 : 1 : 4*8492 .
/ 3 = 91 ' 7 ' .
This alteration involves a simplification of the indices , as { 201 } becomes { 101 } , { 403 } { 203 } and { 021 } { Oil } .
The valency volume W is 64 : if \amp ; be doubled , the equivalence parameters when b and c are interchanged are x : y : z =3*0837 : 7*0946 : 2*9261 .
The x and 2 parameters thus deduced are very similar to those of benzene , whilst vis slightly more than double the corresponding benzene parameter .
Crystals of azobenzene are affected quite strongly in a magnetic field , even in that of our smaller magnet .
The direction of greatest permeability lies along the axis of symmetry b : this axis always tends to set along the lines of force .
This direction corresponds to that of the z parameter , i.e. , to the direction in which we suppose the benzene units to be stacked .
It is in this direction also that the doubly linked nitrogen atoms would be in greatest proximity to one another .
When the crystals are suspended so that this direction is vertical , the direction of the x parameter ( the a axis ) sets axially , and it is in this direction presumably that the colour-producing centres are closer together than in the direction perpendicular thereto .
In view of the striking crystallographic similarity between the salts of tolueneparasulphonic and parachlorobenzenesulphonic acid containing dyad metals , it is obviously important to study the .
salts which these acids form with monad metals .
We have examined crystals of the anhydrous potassium salt of parachlorobenzenesulphonic acid .

The relationship between the potassium and cobalt salts cannot well be accounted for in any other manner .

) The conditions of the co-existence of hydrogen dioxide and formaldehyde , and the nature of their interaction , are of special interest in connection with the theories which have been advanced to account for the photosynthesis of carbohydrates in plants .
As the initial stage in the assimilation of carbon dioxide , Bach* suggested that carbon dioxide in presence of water gives rise to percarbonic acid ( H2C04 ) and formaldehyde , whereas Usher and Priestleyf consider that the primary products are hydrogen dioxide and formaldehyde , the change being reversible in the sense C02+3H20 -r H.CHO +2H202 .
This view has been opposed by various authors , one ground for objection being the , presumably , incompatible nature of the two compounds named .
The interaction of hydrogen dioxide and formaldehyde was first studied by Blank and Finkenbeiner , J who showed that , in presence of alkalis , * 'Comptes Rendus , ' vol. 116 , p. 1145 ( 1893 ) .
