( Abstract .
) M. Hermit , in a paper " Sir la theory de la transformation des fonctions Abeliennes , " Comptes Rendus , t. xl .
( 1855 ) , establishes incidentally the properties of the matrix for the automorphic linear transformation of the bipartite quadric function xw'-'yz'-y'--wx ' , or transformation of this function into one of the like form , XW'+YZ'-ZY'WX ' .
These properties are ( as will be shown ) deducible from a general formula in my " t Memoir on the Automorphic Linear Transformation of a Bipartite Quadric Function , " Phil. Trans. t. cxlviii .
( 1858 ) , pp. 39-46 ; but the particular case in question is an extremely interesting one , the theory whereof is worthy of an independent investigation .
For convenience the number of variables is taken to befoir ; but it will be at once seen that as well the demonstrations as the results are in fact applicable to any even number whatever of variables .
