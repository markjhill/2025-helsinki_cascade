492 Squares of Ellipsoidal Surface Harmonic Functions .
[ Dec. 2 , bling ones found in the lobus pyriformis , and it seems likely that these are the end-stations for fibres proceeding from the inner olfactory root .
A total absence of large fibres and large cells and a simple plan of arrangement is the general character of this area and does not lend colour to the doctrine that it , and not the Rolandic region , is a centre for common sensation .

( Abstract .
) This paper is a sequel to three others on ellipsoidal harmonic analysis and its applications , published in Series A of the 'Philosophical Transactions , 'vol .
197 , pp. 461\#151 ; 557 ; vol. 198 , pp. 301\#151 ; 331 and vol. 200 , pp. 251\#151 ; 314 .
The integrals referred to in the title are absolutely essential for practical applications of this method of analysis .
A table of all such integrals is given in the first of the above-named papers , but the results are only approximate .
In the present paper the rigorous forms of the integrals , numbering 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 , are given for the surface harmonics of orders 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 .
A mistake is detected on p. 556 of the first of the previous papers , where the coefficient of f3in the cosine-function of the third zonal harmonic is erroneously given as 3 ; it should have been f.
