[ Phil. Trans. 1823 , p. 187.1 This instrument consists of two plates , each fifty feet long and two wide , one of copper and the other of zinc .
They are rolled round a cylinder of wood , and their contact is prevented by the interposition of hair rope and notched sticks .
This coil is counterpoised and suspended by a rope and pulleys over a tub of acid , into which it is immersed when required for use .
When thus immersed , with its poles connected by a sufficient conductor , it affected magnetic needles at a distance of five feet , and was extremely powerful in conferring magnetism upon steel bars , which acquire a north polarity at the copper , and a south at the zinc plate .
The electric intensity of the apparatus is exceedingly feeble .
