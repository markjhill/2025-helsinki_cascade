A further Account of the Bones of Animals being made Red by Aliment only .
By John Belchier , F. R. S. IN the former Account , which I gave concerning the Red Bones of the Hogs , ( see No 442.p.286 .
) I mentioned , That the Colour was occasioned by Bran , ( being mixed with their common Food ) after it had been made Use of to clean printed Callicoes ; the Colours of which were made , some from Preparations of Iron , which were the Blacks and Purples ; others from Preparations of Alum , and Sacc .
Saturni , which produces the Red Colours ; and that Madder Root was made Use of to fix these Colours on the Cloth.-To which of these Preparations the Colour was owing , I could not determine .
Some were of Opinion , that it was entirely occasioned by the Preparations of Iron ; others , that it was the whole blended together : And , in orQ q2 der der to clear up this Point , I determined to make some Experiments .
The first I made was upon a Cock , by mixing some of the Madder Root with Fig Dust , on which they feed.-The Cock dying within sixteen Days after his first feeding on the Madder , I dissected him , and examined the Bones , not in the least Expectation of finding them ting 'd in so small a Time ; but , to my great Surprise , found them universally of a Red Colour : So that , from this Experiment , it appears , that the Madder alone causes this Alteration : But why the Bones only are affected , I shall consider of in the Course of more Experiments .
