But Note , that in such of these Places as lie open to the Sea , and where no great Rivers are , the Quarter-Moonhigh-waters , hold out longer than the times showed by this Reduction , near half an hour .
As also that , when by reason of the long Droughts in Summer , or continual hard Frosts in Winter , the fresh Waters are low ; or when the Wind blows hard at N , or N.W. theTides may hold up longer in the River of Thames , than the Times showed in the Table .
But when the Wind is strong at W. or W. by S. or there are great Freshes ; they hold not out so long , but the difference is seldom above half an hour .
