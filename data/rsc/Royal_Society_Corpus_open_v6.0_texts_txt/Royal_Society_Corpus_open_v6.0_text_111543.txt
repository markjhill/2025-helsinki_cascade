I. Letter to Dr. SHARPEY , Sec. R.S. , from Dr. THOMAS WILLIAMS , F.R.S. , dated Swansea , Dec. 12 , 1858 .
In my paper entitled " Researches on the Structure and Homology of the Reproductive Organs of the Annelids , " lately published in the Philosophical Transactions , the following passage occurs in a note at page 1 13:- " Some of these demonstrations have been recently witnessed by Mr. Busk and Dr. Carpenter .
" Some time after the publication of my paper , I received a letter from Mr. Busk , observing that when taken in connexion with the context , the above allusion to his name and that of Dr. Carpenter might lead to the supposition that they acquiesced in the views which I ventured to advocate in my paper .
If permitted , I should be glad to state , that although I had shown to Mr. Busk and Dr. Carpenter certain of my dissections , and although I was favoured at the time with what I believed to be their concurrence and approbation , I am most anxious at present to explain that in referring to their names , I had no intention whatever to implicate them in the opinions which I entertained .
I remain , &amp;c. , THOMAS WILLIAMS , M.D. , F.R.S.
