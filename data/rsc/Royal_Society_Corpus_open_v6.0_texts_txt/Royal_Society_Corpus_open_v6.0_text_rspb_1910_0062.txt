Introduction .
This species was only met with on one occasion during the work of the Commission in 1909 .
This was in the blood of an ox from the Mabira Rubber Estate ( latitude 0 ' 30 ' N " longitude 32 ' 55 ' E. ) .
The manager wrote that the animal came from the Bukedi District , about 100 miles to the north ( latitude 1 ' 50 ' N. , longitude 32 ' 40 ' E. ) .
Not much is known of this district , as it has only recently come under administration , and therefore it is impossible to say whether the ox was infected in Bukedi or on the journey south .
This is the species of trypanosome which was first discovered by Bruce , in 1894 , in Zululand , to be the cause of Nagana , or tsetse-fly disease .
During the work of the Sleeping Sickness Commission of the Royal Society in 1903 , it was also met with in a herd of cattle from the same district of Bukedi , and then described as the " Jinja trypanosome .
" f It is impossible to name with any certainty the trypanosome seen in 1903 , which affected the horses , camels , and dogs of the Abyssinian Boundary Commission .
This was described as the " Abyssinian trypanosome .
" Its morphology , as given * Continued from ' Roy .

Trypanosome [ July 15 , in the coloured plate , * shows it to be similar to Trypanosoma so that in all likelihood it was either this species or the closely related Trypanosoma evansi .
As camels were infected , it was more probably the latter .
In regard to the third kind of trypanosome found in 1903 , and referred to as the " Mule trypanosome , " no opinion can , at present , be given .
As to the remaining trypanosome seen in 1903 , and known as " Pordage 's ox trypanosome , " !
an examination of the old specimens at once disclosed its identity .
It is Trypanosoma vivax ( Ziemann ) ; and this accounts for the fact that the blood of the ox injected into a monkey and a dog had no effect , these animals being refractory to Trypanosoma vivax . .
Morphology of Trypanosoma rrucei , Uganda , 1909 .
This species is interesting on account of its well-marked dimorphism , in which Trypanosoma gambienseresembles it .
There are two varieties\#151 ; the long and slender with free flagellum , and the short and stumpy without free flagellum .
The shortest are only 13 , and the longest 35 microns in length .
In this paper the long and slender are considered to be those which measure from 25 to 35 microns ; the short and stumpy from 13 to 21 microns .
Those trypanosomes which measure 22 , 23 or 24 microns are called intermediate .
The general character of these forms may be given , shortly , as follows :\#151 ; The long and slender have a narrow extended posterior extremity , an elongated oval nucleus , a well-developed undulating membrane thrown into many waves , folds or plications , and a long free flagellum ( see Plate 2 , figs. 1 to 5 ) .
The short and stumpy , on the other hand , have a rounded posterior extremity , somewhat like the head of a turtle , a round or oval nucleus lying transversely to the long axis of the trypanosome , a well-developed undulating membrane thrown into bold folds , and ho free flagellum ( see Plate 2 , figs. 11 to 16 ) .
The intermediate have a short free flagellum , a posterior extremity resembling that of the short and stumpy form but narrower , an oval nucleus , and a well-developed undulating membrane ( see Plate 2 , figs. 6 to 10 ) .
A. Living , Unstained .
No observations were made in Uganda on this species of trypanosome in the living , unstained condition .
B. Fixed and .
Stained .
The blood films were fixed , stained , and measured as described in the * Proceedings .

Diseases of Domestic Animals Uganda .
Length.\#151 ; The following table gives the length of this species as found in Uganda , in the ox , monkey , dog , guinea-pig , and rat .
Only one trypanosome was found in the blood of the original Mabira ox .
It measured 24 microns .
In the monkey only 11 trypanosomes could be found .
In all the others , 20 trypanosomes have been drawn and measured . .
These were taken as they came , except that dividing forms were passed by .

Doubtless , individuals could be found slightly longer or shorter than this if they were hunted for .
In Table I , as already mentioned , the 20 trypanosomes drawn are the first met with , except that dividing forms are left out , and this rule is adhered to throughout .
The average length of the 172 trypanosomes dealt with in Table I is 23-6 microns ; but , as this does not give much information , the following table has been prepared .
This represents by means of dots the length of each of 160 trypanosomes , in eight preparations of 20 each .
Although Trypanosoma brucci is described as a dimorphic species , it must not be supposed that there is any strict line of demarcation between the long and slender and short and stumpy forms .
There are the intermediate forms .
This table is also useful in showing at a glance the distribution of the various lengths .

Trypanosome [ July 15 , This division of Trypanosoma bruceiinto long , intermediate , and short forms is , of course , quite artificial , as the one form passes into the other by insensible gradations .
It may , however , prove of some use in the identification of this species .
In the same way a series of measurements of the various parts of the 'trypanosome body may also prove useful .
The following table gives the distance between the posterior extremity and the micronucleus , the micronucleus and the nucleus , the size of the nucleus , the distance between the nucleus and the anterior extremity , and the length of the free flagellum .
Breadth.\#151 ; The long and slender forms average 1*5 micron ; the short and stumpy 2*5 microns .
Shape.\#151 ; As already mentioned , this is a markedly dimorphic species , composed of long , slender forms with free flagella , and short , stout forms without free flagella .
It is curious that the long forms may preponderate in the blood one day and the short forms another .
Tor example , as will be seen from Table I , the trypanosomes in the guinea-pig 's blood on October 11 were mostly short forms , giving an average of 207 microns , while a week later they were mostly long forms , giving an average of 27'1 microns .
Note also Bat 1643 , with an average of 19'6 microns , and Bat 1482 , with an average of 24-7 microns .
This species may be compared with Dutton and Todd 's Trypanosoma dimorphon , and in truth the coloured drawings given hy them in their original plate* ( figs. VII , IX , and X ) are very similar , if not identical , in shape and size with Trypanosoma brucei .
Fig. X , the long , slender form with free flagellum , is 305 microns in length .
Fig. VII , the short , stumpy form without free flagellum , is 16 microns in length .
As to fig. VI , on the same plate , stated to represent the " tadpole form , " one would suspect from its general shape and appearance that it had no connection with the others .
But in regard to figs. VII and X , anyone comparing Dutton and Todd 's plate with the coloured plate , accompanying this paper must be struck with the close resemblance between these two forms of Trypanosoma dimorphon and Trypanosoma brucei .
Is it possible that Dutton and Todd were dealing with Trypanosoma brucei when they described Trypanosoma dimorphon ?
Contents of Cell.\#151 ; The protoplasm which is stained a pale blue is often dotted over with chromatin granules , especially in the anterior half ( Plate 2 ) .
In well-stained preparations the distribution and number of these granules is sufficient , according to McFadyean , to differentiate this species from Trypanosoma evansi .
This was also pointed out by Laveran * ' First Report of the Trypanosomiasis Expedition to Senegambia ( 1902 ) , ' University Press of Liverpool , 1903 .

Micronucleus , \#151 ; Small and round , situated , on an average , 24 microns from the posterior extremity in the long and slender forms , 14 microns in the intermediate , and 11 microns in the short and stumpy .
Undulating Membrane.\#151 ; This is well developed in this species and thrown into many folds and undulations .
In this it differs markedly from Trypanosoma vivax .
Flagellum.\#151 ; The flagellum in the long and slender forms is free and , on an average , 6*4 microns in length .
In the short and stumpy forms there is no free flagellum .
Comparison of Trypanosoma brucei , Uganda , 1909 , with Trypanosoma brucei , Zululand , 1894 ( see Plate 1 ) .
When Trypanosoma brucei was discovered in Zululand , in 1894 , it was naturally thought to be the one and only trypanosome in Africa , and a detailed description seemed unnecessary .
Now , however , since the number of species in Africa has increased to such an alarming extent , it is necessary to add to the old description by more detailed measurements .
Luckily , many of the old Zululand preparations are still extant , so that it has been possible to do this .
It must , however , be borne in mind that the Zululand preparations are some 15 years old , and were stained with carbol-fuchsin and not by Giemsa as in the case of the Uganda strain .
They may , therefore , have shrunk to a greater extent than the more recently stained specimens .

Trypanosome [ July 15 , The average length of the Trypanosoma Uganda , 1909 , was 23-6 microns , the maximum 34 microns , and the minimum 15 microns .
The measurements of the two strains therefore correspond very closely .
Tables II and V can be compared in the following chart , which gives the curves of the distribution in respect to length of Trypanosoma brucei , Uganda , 1909 , and Trypanosoma brucei , Zululand , 1894 .

Animals Susceptible to Trypanosoma brucei .
Table VI shows the effect of inoculating various animals with Trypanosoma brucei , Uganda strain , 1909 .
The number of experiments carried out on the various animals is too small for comparative purposes , but sufficient to show that cattle and the smaller laboratory animals are susceptible to this trypanosome .
Cultivation of Trypanosoma brucei , Uganda Strain , 1909 .
No attempt was made in Uganda to cultivate this trypanosome .
Carrier of Trypanosoma brucei .
No experiments were made in the laboratory at Mpumu with Glossina palpalis as a carrier of this trypanosome , and no evidence is to hand as to how it is conveyed from sick to healthy animals in the district of Bukedi .
