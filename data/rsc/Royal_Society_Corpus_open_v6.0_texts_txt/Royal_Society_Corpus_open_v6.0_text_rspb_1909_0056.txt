The former cannot at present be answered , and there is no experimental proof of the latter , since the injection of the blood of the Lake-shore birds and mammals into susceptible animals has always , up to the present , given negative results .
Glossina palpalis as a Carrier of Trypanosoma vivax Uganda .

( Sleeping Sickness Commission of the Royal Society , 1908-09 .
) ( Received November 27 , \#151 ; Read December 9 , 1909 .
) One of the important trypanosome diseases of cattle in Uganda is that caused by Trypanosoma vivax(Ziemann ) .
This species of trypanosome appears to be widely distributed in Central Africa .
It has been reported from Senegal , the Sudan and Erythrea in the North , to Rhodesia in the South .
It is fairly easily recognised on account of its extreme activity during life , its characteristic shape in stained specimens , and the fact that it only affects cattle , goats , and sheep ; while monkeys , dogs , rabbits , guinea-pigs , rats , and mice are refractory .
Its carriers have usually been reported as tabanus and stomoxys .
This short note is written to place on record that fact , that in Uganda the tsetse flies , Glossina palpalis , which are found in large numbers on the Lake-shore , are infected , not only by Trypanosoma gambiense , the cause of sleeping sickness , but also by Trypanosoma vivax .
The first experiment which showed that these tsetse flies are infected with the latter trypanosome was the following :\#151 ; Experiment 1318.\#151 ; Calf .
To ascertain if oxen will become infected by trypanosomes if allowed to feed in the " fly area .
" July 12 , 1909 .
A healthy calf was taken down to the Lake-shore at Kibanga and ferried across the bay to Nsonga , where tsetse flies are numerous .
The flies were observed to feed on it in numbers .
It was then brought back to Kibanga .
In future this calf will be taken out every day by the fly-boys to different parts of the Lake-shore , where it will graze while the boys are catching tsetse flies .

Trypanosoma vivaxpresent in the blood of this calf .
Remarks.\#151 ; If the incubation period of this disease is assumed to be eight days , then this calf remained 19 days at the Lake-shore before it became infected .
The proof that the trypanosome found in this calf 's blood was Trypanosoma vivax and not Trypanosoma gambiense was the shape and appearance of the parasite , the fact that the calf 's blood injected under the skin of two monkeys gave negative results , and , lastly , that 50 laboratory -bred flies fed on this calf afterwards infected a goat with Trypanosoma vivax .

The remaining experiments were carried out by bringing freshly-caught Glossina palpalis from the Lake-shore to the laboratory at Mpumu and placing them on healthy oxen .

Conclusions .
1 .
The Glossina palpalis on the shores of Victoria Nyanza are infected , not only by Trypanosoma gambiense , but also by Trypanosoma vivax .
2 .
What the reservoir of the virus of Trypanosoma vivax is , is unknown , but the buffalo , waterbuck , and other antelope which live on the Lake-shore should be examined .
