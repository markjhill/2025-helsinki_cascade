On the late extraordinary depression of the Barometer , By LUKE HOWARD , Esq. F. R. S. Read January 24 , 1822 .
THE quicksilver having fallen to a lower point in the barometer in the course of last month than any person , probably , remembers to have seen it at , in the neighbourhood of London , a short account of the circumstances may , perhaps , not be unacceptable to the Royal Society .
On the evening of December 24 , I found the barometer at 28.20 in .
the wind being moderate at S. E. , with steady rain , the temp. without , at 8 p.m. 45 ? .
Water boiled freely at 210 ? .
Finding the depression still to continue , I took a portable barometer , on Sir H. ENGLEFIELD'S construction , and having ascertained its height to be , at i1 p. m. , 27.96 in .
, I set it up in my chamber on the first floor .
At 5 a. m. the 25th , this instrument gave 27.83 in .
, and I have reason to think it did not go much lower : the rain had ceased early in the night , and it had become somewhat star-light , with a calm air , and hazy cirrostrati above : soon after five , however , the wind rose again , bringing some rain , apparently from N. W. , but there was no tempest that I had opportunity to observe , though it might have blown hard during the few hours I slept .
The pencil of my clock barometer travelled precisely to two-tenths below the bottom of the scale , having made a continuous downward sweep of nearly an inch and four-tenths in 24 hours : it appears to have turned to rise abruptly , and by 8 a. m. was again on the point of passing 28 inches .
In the 24 hours preceding this time , there had fallen eight tenths of an inch of rain ; in the 24 hoursfollowing it there fell none , nor was the wind , which blew from S.W. , at all strong ; indeed it was calm all the middle part of the day , with sunshine and cirrus above : evaporation was very perceptible , and the night , up to to p. m. starlight .
The barometer , at 8 p. m. the 25th ; was at 28.40 in .
In the early morning of the 27th , not having yet reached 29 in .
, it turned to fall again , with the wind at S. and S.W. , after S*E .
: we had again some heavy rain with hail about noon , and by midnight the quicksilver reached 28.07 , or.o6 in .
, where it stood , or rather made minute oscillations , during the 12 hours following , a thing I should scarcely have thought possible in our climate .
It was stormy , with much rain , and cloudy during most of this interval ; but at noon on the 29th , and from the abovementioned very low point , the decisive rise began ; which proceeding in a bold uninterrupted curve into the afternoon of the 31st , the quicksilver once more touched upon 30 inches , with the winds northerly , and moderate ; and the year went out with fine weather .
Such were the principal circumstances which met my notice in a depression of the barometer , to which I find no parallel , for London , in the whole Meteorological Annals of the Society .
Let us , however , now advert to a case or two which seem to have approached to it .
BARKER , of Lyndon , gives the following monthly minima , viz. 1782 , April , 28.09 in .
; 1783 , February , 28.08 ; and March , 27.88 in .
( Philosophical Transactions , Vol. LXXIII .
, p. 242 , and LXXIV .
, 114 p. e83 .
) Now , the two latter occurred during the dreadful earthquakes in Calabria , of which we have a record in the Transactions ; and I believe the barometer was noted to be extremely low , about that time , in various distant parts of England ; but a comparison of the Society 's Register is here precluded by a chasm of several years continuance .
I have no doubt , however , from the general appearance of the means in the Lyndon Register , that the barometer there stood commonly some tenths lower than that at Somerset house .
With respect to my own , I found yesterday , when the quicksilver was but little above 3o in .
, that my portable barometer exceeded that at Somerset House , when placed by its side , by 0.05 in .
, which was likewise , as nearly as I could judge , the difference in excess from my clock barometer .
The latter therefore agrees very nearly , in this part of the scale at least , with the barometer registered in the Transactions .
I annex to this paper a diagram , traced from the variation on the face of my clock , for the two latter months of 1821 , the scale being three quarters to an inch , ( P1 .

) placing at bottom the amount of rain in each successive five days , and the winds , so far as may serve to show their succession .
It will be seen that this great depression was preceded by abrupt changes , fluctuating for o3 days , chiefly between 29.5 and 3o inches , during a continuance of stormy weather ; and that the depression itself was 14 or 15 days in progress , from the point of 3o inches , to that from which it finally rose in three days .
The rain for these two months is x1o.o inches , a quantity ; without precedent in the same space of time at London : that is to say , without one on record .
BARKER gives , however , i15 for " April , 1782 , 6.125 in .
; and for " May , 5.722 in .
" at Lyndon ; yet the South Lambeth table , given along with his own , exhibits but 6.24 in .
for these two months ; and states 6.88 in .
for the seventh month ( July ) , following , where he has but 2.70 in .
I am almost at a loss for an apology to the Society , for having in my last paper anticipated , on the strength of a single analogy , a dry year for 1821 , the fact being , that there has fallen at Tottenham , in the whole year , no less than 33.84 inches .
It seems as if , with all our anxiety to pass the stream of uncertainty in this science , we must give over making the wooden bridges of conjecture , and wait till we can accumulate more solid materials .
