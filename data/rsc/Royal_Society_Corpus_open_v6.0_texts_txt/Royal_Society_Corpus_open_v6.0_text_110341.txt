A paper was read , entitled , " An experimental Inquirv into the Treatment of Tic Douloureux .
" Bv W. R. Whatton , Esq. F.S.A. M.R.C.S. Communicated by P. M.'Roget , M.D. Sec. R.S. The author , after giving a brief account of the history of neuralgia facialis , and of the opinions that have been entertained of its nature , states the results of his trials of morphia applied to the skin , when denuded of cuticle by the previous application of a blister .
The form he usually employs is that of a cerate , composed of eight grains of the acetate of morphia , finely powdered , to an ounce of simple ointment or lard , one dram of which is applied every eight hours .
After afew weeks the proportion of the acetate is doubled , and occasionally , in very severe cases , a cerate , containing twenty or twenty-four grains in the ounce , was used .
He relates a number of cases in which this treatment was perfectly successful in curing the disease , even when it had been of long standing , and had resisted every other mode of treatment .
