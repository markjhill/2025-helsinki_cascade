On Respiration .
By William Allen , Esq. F. R. S. and William Hasledine Pepys , Esq. F. R. S. Read June 22 , 1809 .
ONE of the most prominent features in our last communication was the evolution of a considerable quantity of azote , when oxygen gas nearly pure was respired ; and although a considerable part of this azote must undoubtedly be attributed to the residual gas in the lungs , after the most forcible attempt at expiration , yet the fact seemed to demand still farther investigation , it appearing of consequence to ascertain whether the increase of azote was uniform throughout the latter stages of the experiment , or solely confined to the earlier periods .
By adverting to our former Paper , it will be found , that in an experiment where more than 3ooo cubic inches of oxygen passed through the lungs in seven minutes and a quarter , 62 cubic inches of azote were found in the first 250 cubic inches expired , though the gas originally contained but 2,5 per cent. or only 6 cubic inches in this quantity ; in the two next portions expired , consisting of 56e cubic inches , we found 56 cubic inches of azote , though this quantity of gas , before it was respired , contained only 14 ; these , first portions , were given off in about two minutes , and contained nearly loo cubic inches of azote more than could be accounted for in the oxygen employed ; hence it is plain , that a large proportion of the increase is evolved in the first periods of the process .
Our attention was particularly directed to this point in the following experiment .
The oxygen , procured as usual from hyperoxygenised muriate of potash , was found to contain four per cent. of azote ; the experiment was conducted in the same manner as the preceding ones , except that the tubes of the gasometers were filled with oxygen , and the gas was not merely passed once through the lungs , but breathed backwards and forwards .
In order to prolong the duration of the experiment , which began and ended with a forcible expiration , portions of the respired gas were preserved for examination from each of the gasometers , in the following order : No. .

29,9 51 2668 2544 124 13 minutes ; here the deficiency was greater than we had ever remarked before ; but on passing an equal quantity of common air from the water gasometer , and registering it in the mercurial ones , we were satisfied that the apparatus was quite perfect .
It is , however , to be considered , that the respiration in this case was not natural , and that some small degree of force was required when the inspirations and expirations were made in the mercurial gasometers , which renders this experiment rather different from those which had preceded it ; and it appears to us probable , that a portion of air was forced into the extremities of the bronchea , which could not be suddenly expelled by the strongest attempts at expiration .
Hence also , perhaps , the constant though smaller deficiency , even when the air was only once passed through the lungs ; but when the process is continued for a much longer time , it is probable that the vessels recover their tone , and are able to expel nearly the whole of the volume admitted .
The air expired in the present instance , being examined in the manner described in our last paper , we found that 0oo parts from each of the gasometers contained the following proportions : No. i. io carbonic acid 21 azote 69 oxygen 100 No. e. to carbonic acid 11 azote 79 oxygen 100 40o6 No. 3 .

The question now is , whether this increase of azote can be owing to the residual gas contained in the lungs at the beginning of the experiment , or whether a portion of oxygen is not actually exchanged for azote , when pure oxygen gas is respired .
Here it may be tseful to compare the azote found in our former experiments on oxygen , with the present .

29,9 5I 2668 2544 1n4 13 , 205 105 133 The greatest increase of azote was in the sd and 3d experiments , when the thermometer was at 70 ?
, which might materially influence the results : in the other cases , it was not higher than 53 .
From the experiments of GOODWIN , We might be inclined to admit the capacity of the lungs , inferred from the ist and 4th experiments , as very possible ; but it seems difficult to conceive that it can amount to 236 or 225 cubic inches , and yet this must be the case , unless a portion of azote is .
given off from the blood , or there is some process in nature by which it is capable of being produced from oxygen .
Having , by the kindness of our friend HENRY CLINE , jun .
409 been furnished with the lungs of a stout man , about five feet ten inches high , taken from the body not long after death , and in a sound state , we proceeded to ascertain the quantity of air contained in this organ after the most complete expiration , as in death .
HENRY CLINE had judiciously taken the precaution to divide the trachea just below the crichoid cartilage , before he opened the thorax ; he then inserted a tube with a brass stop-cock , which he tied firmly to the trachea , and attached an empty bladder to the other end .
The cock was tlen turned , so as to communicate with the bladder , and on opening the thorax 31-2 cubic inches of air were expelled into it .
The weight of the lungs was four pounds one ounce .
A very large glass jar being placed in a shallow tin vessel , was filled to the brim with water , the lungs were then completely immersed , and the water which flowed over , and was the measure of their volume , weighed six pounds two ounces ; we next cut a portion of the lungs into small pieces , under a large inverted glass of water , and attempted to squeeze the air from the cells , but although several cubic inches were thus procured , we were soon convinced that it was utterly impossible to arrive at our object by these means , as no force that we could use seemed capable of expelling the air from the cellular membrane , into which it escaped from the vesicles .
We therefore took portions of the lungs , which weighed 2774 grains ; the mass being put into a piece of new hair cloth , was subjected to the action of a powerful screw press , and the fluid was received in a vessel ; after twice undergoing this operation , the mass weighed only 660ograins .
Its specific gravity was very nearly that of water , viz.,93o water being 1 , ooo : the fluid procured by the press , was of the specific gravity of 1 , o19 ; this would make the specific gravity of the lungs 997 , water being 1 , ooo ; hence it appears , that the substance of the lungs , and the contents of the blood-vessels together , are so near the specific gravity of water , that they may be fairly considered as the same .
Then , as the mass of the lungs was equal to 4 pounds of water , though 6,2 pounds of water were displaced by them , and as a pound of water occupies the space of 28,875 cubic inches , we have the following calculation : lbs. oz. 62 water displaced by the lungs 41 weight of the lungs , i , or 59,554 cubic inches of air in the lungs , to which mustbe added 31,580 the volume of the air forced into the ---bladder on opening the thorax .
91,134 and this gives us 91,134 cubic inches , as the air contained in ; the lungs of this person after death ; and when we reflect that the air must have been under compression , when the lungs were inmmersed in water , some force being required to keep them down , and also that not less than 7 or 8 cubic inches must be contained in fauces , &amp;c. , we cannot estimate the whole : at less than loo cubic inches .
It is farther to be noted , that these loo cubic inches would occupy much more space in the temperature of the human body , than in the mean temperature in which the examination was made ; and this difference would be nearly 8 cubic inches ; the air left in the lungs , after complete expiration , would .
therefore be 1o8 cubic inches ; but the mean of our experiments would make it 183 .

133 we are then almost compelled to allow that when pure oxygen is respired , a portion of azote is given off from the blood .
We now resolved to perform a series of experiments upon some animal which lived wholly upon vegetable food , and made choice of the Guinea pig as one of the most manageable .
The apparatus consisted of our two large mercurial gasometers , which were made to communicate with a strong trough E , in the middle of which a small mahogany table D was made fast by a screw , for the purpose of supporting the animal under the bell-glass A , two holes were made through the table for the insertion of tubes to supply , and take off the air , each of them communicated with one of the mercurial gasometers ; the tube B delivered gas towards the upper part of the glass A , in order to bring the supply of fresh air near the head of the animal : the opening of the tube C was placed within half an inch of the table to convey off the respired air ; the gasometer connected with this tube , was made to communicate with a mercurial bath G , in which portions of the respired air were preserved for examination .
Quicksilver being 412 poured into the trough E , so as to rise to a level with the top of the mahogany stand , we placed a Guinea pig upon it , withi the bell-glass over him , and as its edges were immersed in ; quicksilver , the animal was completely confined in atmospheric air : we found that his body occupied the space of 39 cubic inches , which deducted from the cubic contents of the glass A , left 55 cubic inches for the air confined with the pig , to which must be added 5 more for that contained in the tube C. First Expriment with Atmosphec ir .
The pig was placed upon the stand , and the apparatus arranged as represented in the plate : ^50 cubic inches of atmospheric air were admitted into the mercurial gasometer communicating with B : the gasometer communicating with C was quite empty , the apparatus being tried was found perfectly air tight , and the whole quantity of air 31o cubic inches .
The cocks H and I being opened , gentle pressure was made upon the glass of gasometer B , so as to cause the air to pass through A , which consequently drove an equal portion through the tube C into the empty gasometer ; a quarter of an hour was employed in passing the gas , which measured exactly 250 cubic inches in C , so that there was no alteration of volume ; the cocks H and I were now closed , and the respired air being examined by the usual methods , 0oo parts were found to contain 5 carbonic acid 16 oxygen 79 azote 100 As the air after the experiment had experienced no alteration of volume , and as it contained the same proportion of azote as atmospheric air , this substance had remained unaltered .
But 15,50 cubic inches of oxygen had been converted into carbonic acid gas .

The pig hitherto employed was put into the glass vessel A , which with the tube contained 60 cubic inches of atmospheric air ; 25o cubic inches of oxygen , containing 5 per cent. of azote , were admitted into the gasometer communicating with B , and during a quarter of an hour were made to pass slowly through the vessel in which the animal was confined , to the empty gasometer communicating with C , where it measured exactly 250 cubic inches ; a portion was preserved in the mercurial bath for examination , and the gasometer B was replenished with 250 cubic inches of the same oxygen ; this was passed in about the same time as before , through A into gasometer C , when it measured 248 cubic inches .
50o cubic inches more of the oxygen were now admitted into gasometer B , and passed in the same manner through A into C , where they measured 249 .
The gasometer B was for the fourth and last time supplied with 50o cubic inches more of the oxygen , which were passed as before , through A into C , during about a quarter of an hour , and then measured 249 .

25o cubic inches more were passed during the next 23 minutes , and these measured 248 in C ; the last 50 were passed in 24 minutes , and the volume remained unaltered .

z 78,91 II1 1 II 36,20 34,20 The quantity if azote added , of oxygen missing , and of carbonic acid formed , were smaller than in the last experiment : but the animal in this instance was smaller , as well as the quantity of oxygen passed through in a given time .
In this case , as in the human subject , the increase of azote takes place principally in the early periods .
The whole azote contained in the 66 cubic inches , confined with the pig , was only 52,14 , but supposing , which perhaps was not the case , that the 66 of common air were expelled by the first 250 cubic inches of oxygen , we should have 250 less 66 184 of oxygen , containing 5 , per cent. azote , or 9,20 cubic inches ; these adcded to the 52,14 , would make 61,34 of azote to be found in the first gasometer of respired gas , but we detected 75 , so that even on this supposition 1i3,66 of azote were added in the first twenty-four minutes .
The azote contained in the second gasometer before respiration , was 12,50 cubic inches , but after it had been respired for twenty-three minutes , we found 23,75 , or an increase of 11,25 azote .
The azote contained in the third gasometer , before respiration , was , as before , 12,50 cubic inches ; but after it had been respired for twenty-four minutes , we found 20 , or an increase of 7,50 azote .
The azote contained in the 66 cubic inches , was 3,30 , but we found 5,28 , or an increase of 1,98 azote .
From the results of these experiments , it seemed that when the usual proportion of azote was not present in the gas respired , there was a disposition in the blood to give out a certain quantity in exchange for an equal volume of oxygen , and we resolved to try , whether this circumstance would occur when hydrogen was substituted for azote , we accordingly made a mixture containing r per cent. oxygen and 78 hydrogen .
Experiment 6 .
Hydrogen and Oxygen .
The pig employed in the last experiment , was placed upon the stand in the glass A , with 66 cubic inches of common air as usual .
e5o cubic inches of the mixture were passed from the gasometer , communicating with B through the glass A into the gasometer communicating with C during sixteen minutes .
The animal did not appear uneasy : a second quantity of 250 cubic inches was passed in seventeen minutes and three quarters : the animal did not seem to be in the least incommoded , A third quantity of 250 cubic inches was passed , in about sixteen minutes .
And a fourth quantity of 250 cubic inches in eleven minutes and three quarters ; but during this time , the animal became very sleepy , and towards the end of the experiment , kept his eyes constantly shut ; he , however , appeared to suffer nothing , and was easily roused for a short time by rapping at the side of the glass .
At the end of sixty one minutes and a half , he was taken out , and we found that during this time , he had produced 60,20 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas , or rather less than one cubic inch in a minute .
It appears , thalt less carbonic acid was evolved in this instance in a given time , than when oxygen was respired , but some circumstances occurred to prevent us from discovering what change the azote had experienced : this point was , however , decided by the following experiment .
Experinent 7 .
Hydrogen and Oxygen .
Having mixed hydrogen and oxygen gases in such proportion as that the oxygen should rather exceed the quantity contained in atmospheric air , we placed the same animal in the glass A with 66 cubic inches of atmospheric air , 250 cubic inches of the mixture were admitted into gasometer B , from the large water gasometer , and gradually passed through the glass A into gasometer C , during fifteen minutes .
The pig did not appear uneasy , and the respired gas measured 250 in C : a portion of this was preserved for examination , which we shall call No. 1 .
s50 cubic inches more of the mixture were admitted into B , and gradually passed , as before , during thirteen minutes ; it measured 2,50 in C ; and a portion No. 2 was preserved for examination .
The animal did not seem to suffer any inconvenience .
250 cubic inches more of the mixture were admitted into B , and gradually passed , as before , through A into C during seventeen minutes .
The animal now become quite sleepy , but did not appear to suffer any thing .
He was taken out at the end of forty-minutes .
At the close of the experiment , the remains of the mixture , which had stood about an hour in the large water gasometer , being examined was found to contain 22 per cent. of oxygen and no carbonic acid ; of the residual 78 parts , 20 were mixed with xo of oxygen , which had been previously found to contain 4a2 3 per cent. azote ; these go parts being detonated in DAVY'S improved VoLTA 's eudiometer , by the electric spark , were reduced to 3 parts , and these 3 parts being treated with the tests for oxygen , were reduced to e parts , a proof that all the hydrogen had been consumed ; but the xo parts of oxygen contained , 3 of azote ; this deducted from 2 , leaves 1,7 for the azote contained in 2o parts of the residuum 78 .

In this , as in the former experiment , we observed that the evolution of carbonic acid was greatest at the middle of the time , but was considerably diminished toward the end , as the pig became sleepy ; it is not improbable therefore that dur424 pa d25 ing sleep , less carbonic acid is evolved than when the animal is exercising all its faculties .
When atmospheric air alone is respired , we have uniformly found , that the carbonic acid evolved , added to the oxygen remaining , exactly equalled the oxygen existing in the air before it was respired , but in the present instance it was one per cent. more , a circumstance which we are at present unable to account for , but it was constantly the case in all the threetrials. .

Hydrogen before Experiment .
The mixture before the experiment was found to contain 71,4 hydrogen .
10oo : 71,4 : : 750 : 53550 therefore the total quantity must be 535,50 cubic inches .

) which contained only 12,14 making together 64,28 of azote , which was all that 4 could have been expected in the : first gasometer of 5o0 after respiration , supposing the whole of the common air had been expelled , but we detected 112,50 , or an increase of 48,22 cubic inches in fifteen minutes .
The second gasometer before it was connected with the glass A , contained but 16,50 cubic inches of azote ; we found however about 26 , and what is remarkable , in the last gasometer there was no increase at all .

The foregoing experiments seem to prove , 1 .
That when atmospheric air alone is respired , even by an animal subsisting wholly upon vegetables , no other change takes place in it , than the substitution of a certain portion of carbonic acid gas , for an equal volume of oxygen .
2 .
That when nearly pure oxygen gas is respired , a portion of it is missing at the end of the experiment , and its place supplied by a corresponding quantity of azote ; the portion evolved in a given time , being greater in the early than in the later periods .
3 .
That the same thing takes place when an animal is made to breathe a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen , in which 427 the former is in nearly the same proportion to the latter , as azote to oxygen in atmospheric air .
4 .
That an animal is capable of breathing a mixture of 78 parts hydrogen , and 2 oxygen for more than arn hour , without suffering any apparent inconvenience .
5 .
That the excitability of an animal is much diminished when he breathes any considerable proportion of hydrogen gas , or that it at least has a tendency to produce sleep .
6 .
That there is reason to presume an animal evolves less carbonic acid gas during its sleeping , than in its waking hours .
7 .
That the lungs of a middle sized man contain more than 0oo cubic inches of air after death .
These experiments have been conducted without reference to any particular theory , and indeed some of the results were so contrary to our preconceived opinions , that we have been induced to bestow more than ordinary attention on the subject .
Confident , however , that all those who repeat the experiments with the same care will arrive at the same results , we shall rest satisfied with stating the facts , not without a hope that those brilliant discoveries of Professor DAVY , which have already given us new views of the operations of nature , will in their progress furnish us with that explanation which it is in vain to expect at present .
Azote or nitrogen , for instance , has been considered as a simple or elementary substance ; it is recognised , however , principally by negative properties .
Every gaseous fluid which will not support life or combustion , which is not absorbed by water , nor acted upon by the tests for oxygen , nor capable of being detonated with oxygen gas , is generally pro4oznounced to be azote : it is the constant residuum in almost all our experiments upon gases , but who shall say whether this residuum is a simple substance or a compound ?
Theeexperiment of Professor BERZELIUS , leads us to suspect it of metallic properties ; and those of DAVY make it probable that it is an oxydated body ; the subject is still under discussion .
But we may fairly indulge more than a hope that the ardent zeal , and well directed labours of the philosophers just mentioned , will throw a new and important light upon this obscure and difficult subject .
