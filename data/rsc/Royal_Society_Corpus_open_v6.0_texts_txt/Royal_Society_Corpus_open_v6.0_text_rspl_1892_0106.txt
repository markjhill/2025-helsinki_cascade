] Egyptians , 5 Hindoos , 8 Australians , and a small number of examples of several other races .
The results obtained were compared with those given by Professor Sir William Turner in his monograph on the Human Crania and Bones of the Skeleton , collected during the voyage of H.M.S. " Challenger .
" The mean index calculated from the two series of observations , disregarding sex , is 106-7 ; of the males alone , 103-5 .
The human sacrum is thus generally broader than long , as already known ; and the female sacrum is relatively broader than the male .
The races dealt with may be divided into three classes :\#151 ; ( a. ) Those distinctly dolicholiieric , with a sacral index below 100 , including the Kaffir , Hottentot , and Bushman .
( 6 .
) Those which may be called sub-platyhieric , with an index between 100 and 106 , including , the Andamanese , Australian , Chinese , Tasmanian , and Negro races , ( c. ) Those which are cleaidy platyhieric , with an index over 106 , including American , ancient Egyptian , Melanesian and Polynesian , Hindoo , European , and other races examined .

The sacral curvature was examined in 236 cases , of which 82 were males , 38 females , and the rest of unknowm sex .
The curve is generally deepest opposite the third sacral vertebra , and is more deeply curved below than above that point .
It is not an equal and uniform curve , but is flattened above , and possesses a more pronounced curvature below the third sacral vertebra .
This occurs in both sexes and in all races .
A promontory between the first and second sacral vertebrae occurs frequently , in the majority of cases in association with an additional sacral vertebra , and more often in the male than in the female .
The female sacrum is more frequently curved more deeply in the upper part of the bone than the male sacrum .
The actual depth of the curve , that is , the amount of curvature , is greater in the male than in the female , irrespective of the absolute size of the sacrum .
The amount of curvature is greatest iu the European races , and , apparently , greater in the European and Mongolian races than in the Negro and Polynesian .
