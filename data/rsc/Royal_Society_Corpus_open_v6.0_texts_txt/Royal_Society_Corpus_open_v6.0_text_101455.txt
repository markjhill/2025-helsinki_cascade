An Account of an odd Spring in Westphalia , together with an Information touching Salt-Springs and the straining of salt-water .
An observing Gentleman did lately write out of Germany , that in Westphalia in the Diocese of Paderborn , is a Spring , which looses it self twice in 24 hours ; coming always after 6 hours , back again with a great noise , and so forcibly , as to drive 3 Mills not far from its source .
The Inhabitants call it the Bolderborn , as if you should say , the Boisterous Spring .
The same Person , having mentioned the many Salt-Springs in Germany , as those at Lunenburg , at Hall in Saxony , at Saltzwedel in Brandenburger Mark , in Tyrol , &amp;c. observes , that no Salt-water , which contains any Metal with it , can well be sodden to Salt in a Vessel of the same Metal , which it self contains , except Vitriol in Copper Vessels .
He adds , that , to separate Salt from Salt-water , without Fire , if you take a Vessel of Wax , hollow within , and every where tight ; and plunge it into the Sea , or into other Saltwater , there will be made such a separation , that the vessel shall be full of sweet water , the Salt staying behind : but , though this water have no saltish taste , yet , he saith , there will be found a Salt in the Essay , which is the Spirit of Salt , subtle enough with the water to penetrate the Wax .
