( Abstract .
) The extensive contributions which have recently been made to the physical history of the ocean have shown the desirability of exact knowledge of the relations of sea-water to heat .
We have accordingly thought it worth while to make observations in order to determine the law of the thermal expansion of sea-water .

N Messrs. T. E. Thorpe and A. W. Rucker on j-ja ^ The only attempt hitherto made to solve this problem which ---- Winch Ofl-n 1 any real claim to consideration is due to the late Professor H ay the United States National Observatory .
The results of his In ^ 8V tion are contained in Maury 's ' Sailing Directions , ' 1858 vol ' 9^ Muncke , nearly fifty years ago , determined the expansion of anartifr'i sea-water at various temperatures between 0 ' and 100 ' C. ; but fidence in the results as applicable to natural sea-water is* affected !
T circumstance that the solution was prepared from data furnished bvft imperfect analyses of Vogel and Bouillon La Orange .
y tte The observations of Despretz were confined to temperatures belo 130,27 , as the main object of his inquiry was the determination of the point of maximum density of sea-water .
The subsequent investigations of Neumann and Rossetti were equally limited , as they were undertaken with the same view .
The water used in our observations was collected from the Atlantic in lat. 50 ' 48 ' N. and long .

' compared with distilled water at the same temperature , was found bvfhn bottle to be 1-02867 .
J The method of experiment was precisely the same as that already employed by one of us in determining the expansion of the liquid chlorides of phosphorus .
It was essentially that already used by Kopp and lerre ; i. e. the expansion was observed in thermometer-shaped vessels - ( so-called dilatometers ) , graduated and accurately calibrated .
Three of these instruments and two sets of thermometers were 'ye\lt ; ^ ; -^e letter were made by Casella ; the length of a degree in difterent instruments varied between 9 and 13 millims. ; they had been compared ( the one set directly , the other indirectly ) with New Standards .

In the original paper we show that if a be the specific gravity at any temperature t of a solution the specific gravity of which at 0 ' C. is 5 , ffe may without sensible error assume to be constant ; whence , by means of the above formula , we are able to give in the following Table all the data necessary for calculating the specific gravity of sea-water of degree of salinity at any temperature between 0 ' and 36 ' .
Column II .
contains the specific gravities at the temperatures given in Column I. of a solution the specific gravity of which at 0 ' C. is 1-02000 ; Column III .
contains the numbers which must be subtracted from those in Column I. for each increase of 0'-l over the temperatures opposite to which they are placed ; and Column IV .
the numbers which must be added for each increase of *00001 of the specific gravity of the solutions at zero .
At the heads of Columns III .
and TV .
are the numbers of ciphers which must he prefixed to the figures written in them in the unit place .
In order to facilitate the use of the Table , we subjoin directions for its application in the form of rules , and give a couple of examples .
I. Given the specific gravity of a sample of'sea-water at any temperature tj to find it at 0 ' C.:\#151 ; Took out in Column I. the figure giving the number of entire degrees of the temperature ; multiply the corresponding number in III , by the fraction by which the observed temperature exceeds that number , and subtract the result from the corresponding number in Column II .
Subtract the difference from the observed specific gravity , and divide the number so obtained by that corresponding to the observed temperature in Column IV .
( without prefixing the ciphers at the top of thecolumn ) ; add the quotient to 1-02000 , and the sum will be the specific gravity required* ' Sample I. Specific gravity observed at 18'-5 C.=l*02475 .

is *00023 , which , multiplied by *5 equals .00011 ; and 1-01763\#151 ; .00011=1*01752 .
Subtract this from the observed specific gravity , 1-02475\#151 ; 1-01752=*00723 .
Divide by *945 ( the number corresponding to 18-5 ) , and the quotient is .00765 , which added to 1-02000 gives 1*02765 as the specific gravity at 0'C .
Example II .
Specific gravity observed at 15 ' C. =1*02570 .
1*02570 -1*01827=*00743 , and ^=.00780 .
*9o2 Therefore specific gravity at 0 ' C. =1-02780 .
We next discuss the discrepancies which occur between our own results and those of Professor Hubbard ; and we point out various circumstances in the methods employed in m aking and reducing the latter observations which appear to us to explain in a great measure the divergences which exist .
