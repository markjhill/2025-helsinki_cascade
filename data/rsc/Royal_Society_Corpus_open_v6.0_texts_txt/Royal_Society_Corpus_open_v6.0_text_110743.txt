" Investigation of a New and Simple Series , by which the Ratio of the Diameter of a Circle to its Circumference may easily be computed to any required degree of accuracy .
" By William Rutherford , Esq. , of the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich .
Communicated by Samuel Hunter Christie , Esq. , M.A. , Sec. R.S. Among various formulas for the rectification of the circle discovered by the author , he has found the one given in this paper to be that best fitted for computation : and he has been enabled by means of it , with comparatively little labour , to extend the number , express ?
ing the ratio of the diameter to the circumference , to 208 places of decimals , a degree of accuracy hitherto unhttainable , without a great amount of labour , by means of any of the series which have yet been employed .
The celebrated series of Mr. John Machine , for the rectification of the circle , is derived from the formula 7T u -11 ? .
-1 1_ =4 tan §§tan - , 45 239 which converges with considerable rapidity , but gives rise to tedious computations , in consequence of the divisor 239 being a prime number .
But by converting the above formula into the following , ? .
=4 tan §§tan ?
+ tan ?
, 45 70 99 a series is obtained by which the extended computation above men ?
tioned was readily effected .
The methods of computation are then stated in detail , and the resulting value of n is given to 208 places of decimals , which is presumed to be accurate to the last figure , the computations having been actually carried as far as 210 figures .
