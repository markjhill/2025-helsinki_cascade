Under the influence of various acents these new acids undergo renmarkable changes , amongst which the transformation produced by the mineral acids deserves to be particularly noticed .
If the acid C28 111 N3 08 be genitly heated with strolng hydrochloric acid , nitrogern gas is evolved , the yellow colour of the original acid disappears , and a red body separates , which may be separated by filtration and puirified by treatment with animlal charcoal .
Both the physical properties and the analysis of the substance thus obtained , prove it to be puire chloroZenzoic acid .
The hydrochloric mother-liquor on evaporation deposits crystals of the h4ydroc1lorate of benzamic acid .

To renlder initelligible this transformation , the acid C38 13Hl N3 08 may be viewed as a double acid correspondling to two molecules of water , C14 ( I-13 N'2 ) 03 -14 4 12 N ) 0304 C12 ( 1-1 .

It deserves to be merftionied that the acid C28 1-ll N31 0 may be derived also from two equivalents of hydrated oxide of ammoniium , whenits formula assunies the followinr , shapi [ ( C,4 114 02)2 N " ' 1 2 } 0N " Further experiments are necessary to dec ; id which of these two formlinit deserves the prefelrelce .

lodobenzoic Acid , C1(115 1 ) 04 .
This substance is produced by a process similar to that which furnishes the chlorobenzoic acid , viz. by the action of hydriodic acid on the acid C28 HlN3 08 , -beautiful white plates resembling benzoic acid , easily soluble in alcohol and in ether and difficultly soluble in water .
Jodobenzoic acid is remarkable for its great stability ; even fuming nitric acid fails to expel the iodine , and transforms the substance simply into nitro-iodobenzoic acid .
The silver salt of iodobenzoic acid is a white amorphous precipitate containling C4 ( 1714 IA g ) 0 , , .
, odotoluic Acid , C16 ( 17 1)04 .
This acid is formed from the analogous nitrogenous acid in the toluic series , according to the equation 32 13 308+2111 C 2HW N3 ?

It crystallizes in white plates of a pearly lustre , which in their chemical and physical properties are very similar to iodobenzoic acid .
lodanisic Acid , C16 ( 117 1 ) 06 is obtained by the action of hydriodic acid upon the nitrogenous acid C,2 H15 N3 012 ) C32 1 , N3 12 + 12 I12 = C16 ( 1-17 I ) 06 + C16 ( 117 112 N ) 06 , HI +N Exceedingly small , nearly white needles , almost insoluble in boiling water , very soluble in alcohol and in ether .
The new method of substitutioni , by which the described products were obtained , although less direct than the ordinary processes , promises nevertheless to adapt itself to several cases of special interest .
I am at present engaged in pursuing these experiments , with the view of producing fluoand cyano-benzoic acids and their homologues , which have never been obtained .
The experiments which I have described were performed in Professor 11ofmann 's laboratory .
