) The behaviour of the albumin glucosides and the mucus bodies known as mucins , mucinogens , mucoids , and hycdogens , on hydrolysis suggests the probability that these complex proteins would bear the same relation to the condensation products of the sugars or the amino-sugars with the amino-acids as the simpler proteins bear to the polypeptides .
Consequently , the authors decided two years ago to make a start in the synthesis of the glucoproteins by preparing the condensation products of glucosamine with the amino-aliphatic acids , in order that their properties and behaviour towards ferments could be ascertained and compared with those of the degradation products of the glucoproteins and thereby throw some light on the constitution of these complex and important organic bodies .
After many failures , the method of synthesis which we eventually adopted for the condensation of glucosamine with amino-aliphatic acids was somewhat similar to one of the methods employed , by Emil Fischer and his co-workers* in the synthesis of the polypeptides .
In brief , the method consists in condensing a-bromoacyl haloids with glucosamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide , and then displacing the halogen in the resulting a-bromoacyl glucosamines by an amino-group through the action of cold aqueous ammonia , viz.:\#151 ; a-Bromoacyl Haloid + Glucosamine Hydrochloride .

Anhydride of a-Aminoacyl Glucosamine .
Numerous difficulties were encountered in carrying out these changes .
In coupling the a-bromoacyl haloids with glucosamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide , it was found that good yields were obtained only when molecular proportions of the reacting substances were employed and when the mixture was vigorously shaken and maintained about the temperature of melting ice .
Further , in the subsequent treatment of the a-bromoacyl glucosamines with aqueous ammonia , the temperature had also * ' Ber .

Synthesis of the [ Apr. 5 , to be kept low both during the interaction of the bodies and the subsequent evaporation under reduced pressure , otherwise much decomposition took place and sticky brown masses resulted .
It should be observed here that when molecular proportions of a-bromoacyl haloids and glucosamine hydrochloride are condensed together in the presence of cold alkali hydroxide , the whole of the bromoacyl group of the substituted acid chloride appears to unite with the amino-group and none with the hydroxyl groups of glucosamine .
This is shown by the fact that the condensation product made from molecular proportions of a-bromolauryl chloride and glucosamine hydrochloride in the presence of normal sodium hydroxide is practically insoluble in dilute or concentrated hydrochloric acid , an almost conclusive proof that only the amino-group present in glucosamine is attacked when the condensation process is carried out under the above conditions .
Moreover , this view is also supported by the analogous behaviour of the a-bromoacyl haloids towards serine , isoserine , tyrosin , and other hydroxyamino-acids in the presence of alkali hydroxides.* It should also be noted that when the a-bromoacyl glucosamines interact with cold aqueous ammonia , they do not yield the expected a-aminoacyl glucosamines but the anhydrides of a-aminoacyl glucosamines .
The action appears to consist in the replacement of the bromine atom in one molecule of the a-bromoacyl glucosamines for an amino-group , and the simultaneous or subsequent withdrawal of the elements of water .
The analyses of the products formed by the action of ammonium hydroxide on a-bromopropionyl glucosamine and a-bromoisohexoyl glucosamine demand this conclusion .
Moreover , it seems that whenever ammonia or alkalies act upon glucose or its derivatives the change which takes place is generally accompanied by the loss of a molecule of water.f In concluding this introduction , we should state that since we published a preliminary note on the condensation of a-bromoacyl haloids with glucosamine , J we find that other chemists have also been working simultaneously on the derivatives of glucosamine with a view to developing the synthetic chemistry of the glucoproteins .
S We should like to state that we are experimenting from an entirely different point of view , and no overlapping has so far * * * S * Of .

ot-Bromopropionyl Glucosamine , CH3*CHBrC0*NH*C6Hii05 .
a-Bromopropionyl glucosamine is prepared by the condensation of a-bromopropionyl bromide and glucosamine hydrochloride in cold alkaline solution .
For this purpose , 4 grm. of a-bromopropionyl bromide ( 1 mol .
) and 18*6 c.c. of N sodium hydroxide ( 1 mol .
) are added gradually and alternately , with vigorous shaking after each addition , to a well-cooled solution containing 4 grm. of glucosamine hydrochloride ( 1 mol .
) dissolved in 18-6 c.c. of N sodium hydroxide ( 1 mol .
) .
There is much frothing and a colourless precipitate separates out immediately after the condensation begins to take place .
The mixture is kept cool for about two hours by surrounding the containing vessel with melting ice , and when the odour of a-bromopropionyl bromide has disappeared a slight excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added .
After standing for about 30 minutes , the impure a-bromopropionyl glucosamine is collected , washed with a little cold water , and dried in air on a porous plate .
A further crop of crystals is obtained by evaporating the mother liquor at ordinary temperatures , which like the former are purified by recrystallisation from hot absolute alcohol .
Total yield , 4T grm. a-Bromopropionyl glucosamine crystallises from alcohol in colourless prismatic needles which melt and decompose at 200-201 ' when slowly heated , and at 210-211 ' when quickly heated , yielding a black liquid .
The crystals are readily soluble in hot and moderately soluble in cold water .
They are readily soluble in dilute alcohol ( 50 per cent. ) , but are difficultly soluble in cold and only moderately soluble in hot absolute alcohol .
They are insoluble in ether , but dissolve instantly in cold ammonia or alkali hydroxides , forming yellow solutions .
The warm aqueous solution of a-bromopropionyl glucosamine readily reduces alkaline copper solutions , yielding red copper oxide , or ammonio-silver nitrate solution , giving a silver mirror ; but when an aqueous solution of the bromide is shaken and warmed for two hours with a little more than one molecular proportion of either semicarbazide hydrochloride dissolved in excess of sodium acetate solution or phenyl hydrazine dissolved in dilute acetic acid no semicarbazone or phenylhydrazone is formed , and the resulting solutions on evaporation under reduced pressure yield most of the original bromide unchanged .

Synthesis of the [ Apr. 5 , Alanyl Glucosamine Anhydride , C9Hi605N2 .
Alanyl glucosamine anhydride is prepared by the action of cold ammonium hydroxide on a-bromopropionyl glucosamine .
For this purpose 1 grm. of a-bromopropionyl glucosamine is mixed with excess of concentrated aqueous ammonia in a pressure bottle and then shaken for five days at the ordinary temperatures of the laboratory .
The resulting solution is evaporated whilst cold in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulphuric acid until crystals of impure alanyl glucosamine anhydride separate out , which are then collected and washed with cold absolute alcohol in order to remove brown decomposition products .
Further crops of crystals are obtained by evaporating the aqueous mother liquor and the alcoholic washings at ordinary temperatures under reduced pressure .
The crude products are then dissolved in hot water and boiled with animal charcoal until the solution becomes colourless .
On cooling , alanyl glucosamine anhydride separates from the aqueous solution in colourless prismatic needles , which are further purified by recrystallisation from hot water .
Yield , 0*3 grm. Alanyl glucosamine anhydride when heated quickly turns pale brown at 245-250 ' and melts at 269-272 ' , yielding a black liquid .
It is moderately soluble in cold and readily soluble in hot water , but it is almost insoluble in cold and only sparingly soluble in hot absolute alcohol .
On prolonged heating , the aqueous solution of alanyl glucosamine anhydride slowly reduces Fehling 's solution , yielding red copper oxide , or ammonio-silver nitrate solution , giving a silver mirror ; but when an aqueous solution of the anhydride is shaken and warmed for two hours with a little more than one molecular proportion of either phenyl hydrazine dissolved in dilute acetic acid , or semicarbazide hydrochloride dissolved in excess of sodium acetate solution , no phenyl hydrazone or semicarbazone is formed , and the resulting solutions on evaporation to crystallisation under reduced pressure yield most of the original anhydride unaltered .
As a primary amine , the anhydride is readily soluble in dilute or concentrated hydrochloric acid , and when heated with alcoholic potash and chloroform yields an unpleasant earbylamine odour ; but when an aqueous solution of the anhydride is mixed with an aqueous solution of picric acid and afterwards evaporated to crystallisation under reduced pressure no picrate is formed and most of the original anhydride crystallises out unchanged .

The product crystallises from absolute alcohol in colourless rhombic plates melting and decomposing when heated quickly at 178-181 ' , and crystallises from water in colourless prismatic needles , melting when heated quickly at 192-195 ' , yielding a black liquid .
The crystals are slightly soluble in cold , and readily so in hot , water or alcohol , either of these liquids being suitable solvents for purifying the solid by crystallisation .
They are insoluble in ether , but dissolve slowly in cold ammonia or alkali hydroxides , yielding yellow solutions .
The warm aqueous solution of a-bromoisohexoyl glucosamine readily reduces alkaline copper solutions , yielding red copper oxide , or ammonio-silver nitrate solution , giving a silver mirror ; but , like a-bromopropionyl glucosamine , does not appear to react with either phenyl hydrazine or semicarbazide .

When quickly heated , it sinters about 205 ' and melts at 213-215 ' , yielding a brownish black liquid .
It is moderately soluble in cold , and readily soluble in hot , water , but it is difficultly soluble in cold , and only slightly soluble in hot , absolute alcohol .
On prolonged heating , the aqueous solution of leucyl glucosamine anhydride slowly reduces Fehling 's solution , yielding red cuprous oxide , or ammonio-silver nitrate solution , giving a silver mirror , but , like alanyl glucosamine anhydride , does not appear to react with either phenyl hydrazine or semicarbazide .

The product crystallises from hot absolute alcohol in colourless rhombic plates , which , when heated quickly , turn brown at 183-186 ' , and melt with frothing at 194-196 ' , yielding a dark brown liquid .
The crystals are insoluble in hot or cold water , but moderately soluble in hot absolute alcohol .
They are insoluble in ether and almost insoluble in concentrated ammonium hydroxide , but they dissolve in hot solutions of sodium or potassium hydroxide , with evolution of ammonia and formation of brown solutions .
The crystals are insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid , and only slightly soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid , showing that the amino-group , and not the hydroxyl groups of glucosamine , has been attacked during the condensation .

Constitution of the u-Bromoacyl Glucosamines and the Anhydrides of u-Aminoacyl Glucosamines .
The analyses and properties of the a-bromoacyl glucosamines are in strict accordance with their representation by aldehydic or glucosidic formulae similar to those generally adopted for glucosamine , * viz.:\#151 ; H H OH H H H OH H I I I I III !
OH CHsC\#151 ; C\#151 ; C\#151 ; C CHO or OH*CH2C\#151 ; C\#151 ; 0\#151 ; C-CHOH ( a or A ) OH OH H NHAc OH H NHAc -0 \#151 ; where Ac is a bromoacyl group of elements .
The representation of the anhydrides of a-aminoacyl glucosamines by constitutional formulae is , however , a more difficult matter , inasmuch as no satisfactory explanation has yet been given of the much simpler anhydrides formed by the action of ammonia or alkalies on glucose and its derivatives.f It is a matter of conjecture to state from what part of the molecules the elements of water are abstracted when the a-bromoacyl glucosamines react with aqueous ammonia .
The feebly basic and slightly reducing properties of the anhydrides of a-aminoacyl glucosamines may be explained by assuming that the elements of water are withdrawn between the amino- and the aldehydic groups with the consequent formation of a linkage between them , which linkage is only broken by the prolonged action of hot alkaline copper solutions .
But , on the other hand , as the elements of water seem to disappear so often when glucose and its derivatives react with ammonia or alkalies , it is more probable that when a molecule of an a-bromoacyl glucosamine interacts with aqueous ammonia a molecule of water is abstracted from the glucose portion of the molecule in much the same way as in other anhydro-derivatives of glucose .
We mean to continue further this investigation .
In conclusion we desire to express our thanks to the Research Fund Committee of the Chemical Society for a grant which defrayed the greater part of the cost of this investigation .
