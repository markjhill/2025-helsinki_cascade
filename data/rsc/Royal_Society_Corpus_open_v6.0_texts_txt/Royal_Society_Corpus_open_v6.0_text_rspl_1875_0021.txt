Since , therefore , on the nights of the experiments at Yillejuif and I Monthery it is stated that the sky was clear , that there was dew , and i the temperature recorded at the two stations shows the diminution to have been downwards , it is argued that the effect of the wind to render the sound less audible at Villejuif was completely balanced by the downward refraction of temperature .
Another phenomenon recorded by Arago is , that while the reports of the guns at Monthery as heard at that station were attended with prolonged echoes , this was not the case with those at Yillejuif .
It is thought that this difference is sufficiently accounted for by the fact that while Monthery is surrounded by high hills with precipitous or wooded sides , which must produce echoes , the country in front of Yillejuif is very flat and has not a tree upon it for miles .
In concluding the paper reference is made to the Appendix to the last Report of the American Lighthouse Board , in which Dr. Henry , the Chairman , gives an account of his experiments , extending over thirty years , and the conclusions to which they have led him , both of which are in favour of the apparent stoppage of the sound being due to refraction .

" On the Length of the Spark from a Battery of 600 , 1200 , 1800 , and 2400 rod-Chloride-of-Silver Cells , and some Phenomena attending the Discharge of 5640 Cells/ - ' By Warren De La Rue , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , and Hugo W. Muller , Ph. D. , F.R.S. Received January 6 , 1876 .
On the 24th February , 1875 * , we had the honour of communicating to the Society , in conjunction with our friend Mr. Spottiswoode , an account of some experiments to ascertain the cause of stratification in electrical discharges in vacuo .
These experiments were made with a battery of 1080 cells of powder chloride of silver , which was described ; we have now in action 3240 such cells , and have recently completed 2400 rod-chloride-of-silver cells t , making our total force 5640 cells in action .
To these will be shortly added another unit of 1080 cells powder chloride , and two other units of 1200 rod chloride , making a total of 9120 cells .
We have more recently made a verbal communication to the Society of * Proc. Koy .

Messrs. W. De La Rue H. W. Muller on [ Jan. 6 , Telegraph Engineers , and also in October last a written one to the Aca-demie des Sciences of Paris * , wherein we have stated that the length of the spark in air appears to be in the direct ratio of the square of the number of cells .
Having completed the 2400 cells , and charged them up in a single day , they were exactly in the same condition as to electromotive force and internal resistance ; consequently they afforded the means of testing the truth of the law of the length of spark in a manner more efficacious than had hitherto obtained , the more especially as by the use of paraffin corks and other precautions we had obtained an excellent insulation .
Our assistant , Mr. Pram , has constructed a discharger which permits of the accurate measurement of the distance of the terminals to read to of an inch , and by estimation to the tenth of that quantity .
The nut through which the screw ( ^j-of-an-inch thread ) carrying one of the terminals works is divided into two parts , which are separated by a spiral pressure-spring so as to prevent shake .
In making measurements the terminals are separated to a greater quantity than the anticipated striking-distance , and gradually approached until the spark passes ; the discharger is then detached from the battery , and , after reading the scale , connected up with a separate battery of 10 cells , with a detector-galvanometer in circuit .
The terminals are again approached until the motion of the galvanometer indicates contact between them ; the scale is again read , and the length of spark obtained by the difference between the first and second reading .

The length of the spark is much influenced by the shape of the terminals ; those which we frequently employ consist of a point as one terminal and a plane for the other .
Hitherto we have used copper terminals , making the point and the plane alternately positive and negative by ; * Comptes Rendus , no. 16 , p. 686 , '\amp ; no , 17 , p. 746 ( 1875 ) .

169 means of a double key discharger , or by a rapidly revolving commutator reversing up to 352 times in a second .
One terminal in the above determinations consisted of a point of 30 ' , and the other of a slightly convex surface 0*46 inch in diameter .
While making these measurements , we noticed in a nearly dark room that when the point was negative a glow , in form like a paraboloid , was seen surrounding it long before the spark passed , and its appearance afforded , by its increasing brilliancy , useful information to guide us as to the more cautious approach of the terminals ; gradually the sugar-loaf-like glow extended to the positive terminal .
With 1800 cells the glow was seen when the terminals were 0*0545 inch apart , the spark passing at 0*0345 inch ; with 2400 cells the glow began at a distance of 0*0865 inch , the spark passing at 0*0535 inch .
Moreover it was noticed that the disk ( positive ) became covered all over with a peach-like bloom , which became stronger in the centre as the terminals were made to approach each other , giving rise to Newton 's iridescent rings .
In order to study more readily the phenomena accompanying the glow preceding the spark , the whole series of 5640 cells was used , the terminals being a point as before of 30 ' for one , and sometimes a flat disk 1*1 inch in diameter or a slightly convex one of 0*8 inch in diameter for the other .
In all cases a peach-like bloom deposited on the disk , which was connected with the silver ( positive ) terminal ; and when the flat disk was used the deposit was notably greater at the periphery and the centre than in other portions of it .
With this number of cells , With the flat disk the glow occurred at 1*073 in .
, the spark at 0*139 in .
With the slightly convex disk " 1*124 in .
" 0*140in.* To ascertain whether a current really passed when the glow appeared , various vacuum-tubes were interposed in circuit between the battery and one of the terminals ; in all cases they were illuminated even before a glow was perceptible on the negative pole ; their interposition , as was to be expected , shortened the spark and diminished the distance at which the glow was perceptible .
Tor example , with a hydrogen tube , having a capillary portion between two larger tubes , such as is used for spectrum experiments , and offering a resistance of 190,000 ohms , the glow occurred at 0*939 inch , the spark at 0*092 inch .
A tube of 31 inches between the terminals , and offering a resistance of 350,000 ohms , was brilliantly illuminated when interposed between one terminal and the battery ; when the terminals were separated the extreme range of the discharge was 1*2 inch , and before any glow was visible at the negative electrode .
How much further between the electrodes it * Postscript , Jan. 7tb.\#151 ; At the suggestion of Professor Stokes , who saw the experiment repeated , the point was made positive , when a longer spark was obtained , namely 0*154 inch and 0*164 inch .

[ Jan. 13 , will be possible to obtain a current has yet to be determined with a larger discharger now in course of construction * .
" We have alluded to the resistance offered by vacuum-tubes .
At first we experienced considerable difficulty in measuring it .
For example , when in a Wheatstone 's bridge the resistance of the tube was balanced by inserted resistances , the galvanometer could only for a short time be brought to rest , and it was then found that the cause of this was that the tubes rapidly increased in resistance as the current passed .
After a time , however , they recovered their original resistance , sometimes rapidly , sometimes only after the lapse of days .
The resistances were found not to be dependent on the length of tube , but to a great extent on their bore , capillary tubes offering a considerable resistance .
Ultimately it was found that it was better to discard the indications of the galvanometer , and to rely solely on the appearance of a luminosity in the tubes placed on one side of Wheatstone 's bridge as soon as the insertion of a balancing resistance was made in the other .
Later on we hope to have the honour of sending to the Society a more detailed statement of our experiments in support of those now quoted , and in confirmation of our former paper on the cause of stratification in electric discharges in vacuo .
In conclusion we venture to draw attention to the following consequences of the law of the length of spark being dependent on the ratio of the square of the number of cells of a voltaic battery , in the event of its being confirmed by experiment .
Taking as a basis the spark with 600 cells of the rod-chloride-of-silver battery=0*0033 inch , a unit of 1000 such cells would give a spark of \#151 ; 0*009166 inch , one hundred units ( 100,000 ) a spark of 91*66 inches , a thousand units ( 1,000,000 ) " 9166 inches=764 feet nearly , whereas a single cell would have a striking-distance of ^ ooo.ooo an inch only .
As far as our own experiments have gone the law has been confirmed ; and although a million cells will probably never be made , a hundred thousand come within the range of experimental possibility .
