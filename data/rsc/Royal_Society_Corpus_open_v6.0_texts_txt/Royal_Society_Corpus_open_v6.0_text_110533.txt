" First Memoir on the Theory of Analytical Operations .
" By the Rev. Robert Murphy , M.A. , F.R.S. , Fellow of Caius College , Cambridge .
The author considers the elements of which every distinct analy ?
tical process is composed , as of three kinds ; the first , being the subject , that is , the symbol on which a certain notih'ed operation is to be performed ; the second , the operation itself , represented by its own symbol ; and the third , the result , which may be connected with the former two by the algebraic symbol of equality .
The operations are either monomial or polynomial ; simple or compound- , and with respect to their order , are either Jixed ox free .
He uses the term linear operations to denote those of which the action on any subject is made up by the several actions on the parts , connected by the signs plus or minus , of which the subject is composed ; and these linear operations likewise may be monomial or polynomial .
A variety of theorems for the developement of functions of a very general nature are then deduced from expansions of the fundamental expressions , derived from the principles stated in the beginning of this memoir : and various laws embracing the relations subsisting between analytical operations , and the fundamental formulae for their transformation are investigated .
