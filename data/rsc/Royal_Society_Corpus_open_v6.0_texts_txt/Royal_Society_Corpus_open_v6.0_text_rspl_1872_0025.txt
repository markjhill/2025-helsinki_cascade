D\amp ; hlandor discusses is in reality much simpler than his enunciation implies ; it amounts to this : investigate the conditions under which a fluid will be in equilibrium in the form of an ellipsoid , when , besides the attraction of the fluid , there are forces parallel to the piincipal axes , which may be denoted by fx , gy , Tiz respectively .
Traces of such a problem appear in other places\#151 ; as , for example , in Lagrange 's ' Mecanique Analytique , ' premiere party , Sect. VII .
This is , however , different from the problem of rotciting fluid , which it was proposed to discuss .

Additional Note to the Paper " On a supposed Alteration in the Amount of Astronomical Aberration of Light produced by the Passage of the Light through a considerable thickness of Refracting Medium " By the President .
Received November 2 , 1872 .
Some months since I communicated to the Royal Society the result of observations on y Draconis made with the water-telescope of the Royal Observatory ( constructed expressly for testing the equality of the coefficient of sidereal aberration , whether the tube of a telescope be filled with air , as usual , or with water ) in the spring and autumn of 1871 .
Similar observations have been made in the spring and autumn of 1872 , and I now place before the Society the collected results .
It will be remembered , from the explanation in the former paper , that the uniformity of results for the latitude of station necessarily proves the correctness of the coefficient of aberration employed in the Nautical Almanac .
