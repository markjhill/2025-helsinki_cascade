) In Part III of these studies , in which a number of isomorphous paradi-bromobenzenesulphonates of the rare earth metals ( La , Ce , Nd , Pr , Gd , Sm ) are described crystallographically , * the conclusion was arrived at that in these salts three of the benzenesulphonic groups , together with 9 or 12 molecules of water , are disposed symmetrically in a plane around a central atom of the tervalent metal .
Molecular units presumably of this kind are packed together in a structure one dimension of which corresponds to the thickness of a single benzene complex observed in numerous substituted benzene derivatives , such as diiodobenzene , for example ; as was pointed out , the salts under consideration may be regarded , in fact , as derived from benzene merely by the pushing apart of the zigzag columns of carbon domains , depicted by Barlow and Pope as characteristic of the hydrocarbon , in such manner as to allow of the introduction of the substituting groups present in the sulphonate in addition to benzene .
In view of this result , it was desirable to determine the crystalline structure of the acid from which the salts were derived as well as of salts containing metals of other degrees of valency .
Numerous unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain measurable crystals of the paradibromo-acid ; ultimately , good crystals were secured of the corresponding dichloro-acid and of its lanthanum , neodymium and praseodymium salts .
The measurements made of these salts , together with those of several related salts , are described in the following section ; the issues are discussed under the headings :\#151 ; ( 1 ) The isomorphism of the dichloro- and dibromobenzenesulplionates .
( 2 ) The morphotropic relationship of dibromobenzenesulphonates to the unsubstituted salts .

Morphotropic Relationship of Substituted and Unsubstituted sulphonates.\#151 ; It is to be expected that didymium benzenesulphonate , which crystallises with nine molecules of water , would bear a close relationship to the corresponding neodymium salt , Nd(C6H3Br2S03)3.9H20 .
This expectation is fully realised .
The benzenesulphonate is orthorhombic , the axial ratios being a :b:c = 2-0801:1:1-9374 , whilst the neodymium ^\gt ; -dibromobenzenesulphonate is also orthorhombic a :b':c ' = 1-3990:1:0-8789 .
When the crystals of the two salts are compared , two significant facts are noticeable : firstly , that the ratio a ' : V is almost exactly two-thirds of : ; secondly , that angles on one of the corresponding zones of the two crystals are practically identical .
Thus , in the case of the didymium benzenesulphonate , we have { 100 } : { 101 } = 47 ' 2 ' , and in that of the dibromobenzene sulphonate { 100 } : { 301 } =46 ' 42 ' .
If in the benzenesulphonate { 101 } be changed to { 301 } and at the same time Mr. E. H. Rod .
the ratio a:bbe multiplied by two-thirds , the axial ratios of the salt become a :b:c = 1*3868 :1:0-8611 , i.e. almost identical with those of the neodymium p-dibromobenzene-sulphonate .
Moreover , the pseudo-trigonal character of the salt is revealed , as the ratio c : bis very nearly equal to the value 0*866 :1 , characteristic of trigonal symmetry.* The equivalence parameters of the benzenesulphonate deduced from the actual ratios thus arrived at , in comparison with those of the neodymium p-dibromobenzenesulphonate , are as follows :\#151 ; x y z Nd(C6H3Br2S03)3.9H20 ... ... ... 2*6475 : 5*6773 : 9*9796 Di(C6H3S03)3.9H20 ... ... ... .
2*6502 : 5*7327 : 9*8729 The close similarity between the structures of the two salts is immediately obvious from these figures.* !

Part III , p. 213 .
t In calculating the equivalence parameters of the acid , it is necessary first to modify the axial ratios by multiplying a by three-quarters and c by 2 .
As objection is sometimes made to this mode of treatment by those who do not clearly appreciate the flexible character of axial ratios , it may be as well to refute these objections here .
The axial ratios of a crystal may be defined as the relative distances from the centre of the crystal at which the form which is designated ( 111 ) cuts the three axes .
In all systems but the cubic , the choice of ( 111 ) is to a certain extent arbitrary : the lower the symmetry of the system , the wider is the range of choice .
For instance , in the case of the monosymmetric sodium p-dichlorobenzenesulphonate described in this paper , there was a wide choice : a particular form was chosen as ( 111 ) and others then became ( 322 ) and ( 122 ) ; but there was no reason why either of these others should not have been made ( 111 ) ; if ( 322 ) had been called ( 111 ) , the axial ratio a : b would have had two-thirds its present value .
Moreover , we are at present entirely ignorant of the causes determining what particular forms shall develop on the crystal and there is no a priori reason why these should always be the simplest possible forms .
In view of these considerations it is not therefore surprising that in most cases , when dealing with orthorhombic and mono-symmetric crystals , some slight modification of the interpretation originally given to the measurements is necessary , in order that morphotropic relationships between different substances may be revealed in the equivalence parameters .
Without guidance from previous knowledge and a general idea of the relationship sought , it would be impossible to discover the morphotropic relationships pointed out in this paper .
Fortunately Barlow and Pope have worked out the structure of crystalline benzene on incontrovertible evidence and a relationship to benzene is first looked for .
When this is found , it is generally accompanied by other significant relationships which serve to enhance the probability of the correctness of the results obtained .
This was particularly well illustrated in the case of the acid and salt just discussed , as the very close structural relationship of acid to salt is apparent only when the x parameters of the two agree with the z parameter of rhombohedral benzene .
Morphological Studies in the Benzene Series .
299 sulphonate of several other metals was discussed in the previous communication .
The heptahydrate now described is apparently very different in form .
It crystallises in the monosymmetric system , the axial ratios being a:b:c-1-2595 :1 : 0-6031 ; / 3 = 89 ' 16 ' .
The markedly pseudo-trigonal structure , which was a feature of the nona- and dodeca-hydrates , is no longer apparent ; this is to be expected , as the number 7 , the number of molecules of water contained in the salt , is incompatible with three-fold symmetry .
When the equivalence parameters of the salt are calculated , the axial dimension b being doubled , the following values are obtained :\#151 ; x:y:z = 5-7160:9-0768:2-7373 .
The z parameter approaches closely that of crystalline benzene , 2*780 ; it therefore appears probable that this salt may be derived from the benzene structure of hexagonal marshalling ( z = 2-780 ) , and not from the alternative rhombohedral marshalling ( z = 2*64 about ) , as are the other salts .
From the general similarity of the parameters of the heptahydrate to those of the other hydrates , it is to be inferred , however , that the molecules of all these salts have very similar configurations , and differ merely in being derived from the two forms of benzene , the difference being due , therefore , only to the manner in which the successive layers of molecules are superimposed one upon another .
The Relationship in Crystalline Form of Acid and the Sulphonates of Metals .
In view of the conclusions arrived at in the previous sections and in Part III of these studies , it appears probable that the crystalline structure of the rare earth salts generally of benzenesulphonic acid and its halogen derivatives always conforms to one type , the type being one in which three sulphonic groups are symmetrically arranged around a central atom of the metal .
In the case of such salts , the arrangement must be largely determined by the metal ; in the case of the acid , the attractive tendencies of the constituent radicles are chiefly operative : as chemical methods throw but little light on such a problem , the study of crystalline form becomes of special importance , as a means of determining the directions in which the forces act in the formation of solids .

301 it is obvious that the ratio c:bof the salt is exactly thrice that of the acid .
This result is of special importance , inasmuch as each group in the molecule of the acid is repeated three times in that of the salt , the valency volume of the latter being therefore three times that of the acid .
When the equivalence parameters of the acid are calculated and compared with those of the salt the following values are obtained :\#151 ; W x H(C6H3C12S03).3H20 ... ... ... 50 2-6763 : 5*7050 : 3-3296 La(C6H3Br2S03)3.9H20 ... ... 150 2-6480 : 5-6885 : 9-9582 It can be seen that the dimensions of the assemblage are practically identical in two directions and that the third dimension is exactly three times as great in the salt as in the acid .
The significance of the values given under x will be obvious .
If as the crystal unit of the acid we take that of three molecules having a valency volume equal to that of the salt and calculate the equivalence parameter of the acid on this basis , values are obtained which are immediately comparable with those of the salt , viz. , x:y:z = 2-6763 : 5-7013 : 9-9880 .
In other words it appears to be legitimate to assume that the crystalline structure of the acid is pseudo-trigonal like that of the salt of a tervalent metal\#151 ; that is to say , that three molecules of acid act in conjunction .
If such be the case , the formation of the salt from the acid involves merely the displacement of three adjacent hydrogen atoms , each of unit volume , by a single atom of metal of three times the volume valency of the hydrogen atom .
The fact that the symmetry is changed from monosymmetric to orthorhombic in the passage from acid to salt is proof that the equivalence though not absolute is very close ; apparently the metal has the effect of rendering the arrangement slightly more symmetrical .
Assuming , in the case of the acid , that the molecules are disposed in groups of threes , the crystalline form is evidence of an attractive influence exerted at the moment of crystallisation , if not in the solution , which causes the sulphonic radicles to set radially , so that a mass of the acid ( or of the salt of a rare earth metal ) can Joe regarded as a mosaic of triangular groups each of which has its centre occupied by three sulphonic radicles .
Further justification of these conclusions is afforded by the following argument : The structure assigned by Barlow and Pope to the form of benzene in which the crystal units are packed together in rhombohedral marshalling is that given in fig. 5 .
Such a structure has rhombohedral symmetry , the point O , around which are grouped three small or hydrogen Mr. E. H. Rod .
spheres , being an unique point of the structure from which emerges a trigonal axis perpendicular to the plane of the paper .
For the present purpose it is sufficient to consider only the three benzene units outlined in the figure which are disposed symmetrically about the point 0 .
If the three hydrogen spheres at 0 be removed in order to make room for three sulphonic groups , the whole structure is expanded ; if the expansion take Fig. 5 .
place symmetrically , so as to make room for three sulphonic groups together with nine molecules of water , the structure would assume the appearance shown diagrammatically in fig. 6 .
This figure is drawn strictly to scale , the shaded area representing the space which would be occupied by the acid groups and the water assuming that no expansion took place in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the paper .
The heavily outlined figure therefore represents the crystal unit of the acid or of a " corresponding " salt .
It is highly probable that when such units are packed together , they are more or less compressed in one direction or another according to the nature of the radicle at 0 and that the crystal retains trigonal symmetry more or less completely according to the influences at work at each centre .
Presumably the complex would assume an approximately triangular shape through compression and its outline would be approximately such as is represented by the broken line triangle .
In constructing the diagram the figure was drawn to scale , using the x and y values of benzene in deducing the hydrocarbon areas and assigning to the shaded space an area ( the valency volume Morphological Studies in the Benzene Series .
303 divided by the vertical dimension of rhombohedral benzene , = 2*64 ) corresponding to the valency volume of the sulphonic groups , the metal and the nine molecules of water .

The angular measurements of the crystals are almost identical with those of the zinc salt .
The crystals belong to the hemimorphic class of the monosymmetric system , as they are destitute of a plane of symmetry , the two ends of the prisms ( which are elongated in the direction of the b axis ) being differently developed .
The form { 212 } invariably appears on only one end of the prism , being sometimes so largely developed at that end that other forms are almost entirely suppressed .
The prisms appear to consist of two individuals imperfectly twinned on { 010 } , and to be expanded in a belt around the middle of the prism ; moreover , the faces on opposite ends of the prism are never truly parallel .

Mr. E. H. Rod .
A glance at the column of equivalence parameters shows that , throughout the series , with one exception , one parameter has a practically constant value , as it varies only between 2-64 and 2*68 , the mean value being 2*658 .
This value has been met with in all the salts of tervalent metals previously discussed and must be taken to represent the distance between corresponding points in successive layers of benzene complexes in rhombohedral marshalling .
The occurrence of this value is proof that in the crystalline structure of all the salts considered , as in those of tervalent metals , the substituting groups are not intruded be the layers of benzene complexes but are included within and form part of these layers .
In view of the conclusion that the crystalline form of p-dichlorobenzene-sulphonic acid is similar to that assumed by salts of tervalent metals and that its molecules become grouped in triads , it is important to consider whether there be any evidence of such an arrangement in the case of the salts of monad metals .
In only one instance , that of potassium p-toluenesulphonate , does this appear to be immediately obvious .
The axial ratio : in this salt is 0865 :1 , a value almost identical with the ideal trigonal ratio 0866 :1 .
It will be noticed that the parameter values of this salt are very similar to those of dichlorobenzenesulphonic acid and that the two compounds have nearly the same valency volume .
It is further legitimate to assume that as the value 2*6618 represents the thickness of each layer , the value ( 3*2285 ) is that in the direction DO in fig. 6 , the y value ( 5*8855 ) being that of AD .
In silver toluene-/ \gt ; -sulphonate one parameter has the value 2*7957 , which is practically that of the z parameter of the second form of benzene , 2*780 .
It is highly probable , therefore , that the crystal structure of this compound is modelled on the hexagonal type of benzene marshalling , not the rhombohedral .
It has been pointed out already that the two modes of arrangement differ essentially only in the manner in which successive layers of benzene complexes are packed together one upon the other .
It is conceivable that the trigonal arrangement prevails also in this salt and that it differs merely in being derived from " hexagonal " rather than " rhombohedral benzene .
" Further , it may be regarded as not improbable that the remaining salts of the group are similarly constituted , though the evidence is of such a character that no definite conclusion is possible at present .
Though the equivalence parameters of the rhombohedral type of benzene are not known , they are probably numerically very close to those of ^\gt ; -diiodo-benzene .
The equivalence parameters of this substance are x:y:z = 3*1402:3*6161:2*6419 .
When one hydrogen atom is displaced by the sulphonic group , it is to be expected that a considerable elongation will be produced in one direction in Morphological Studies in the Benzene Series .
309 the crystal structure , that is to say , in the direction either of the x or of the y parameter ; it may also be anticipated that the adjustments necessary to bring the assemblage into a close-packed condition would involve a certain amount of distortion which would affect the dimension of the other parameter .
The introduction of molecules of water of crystallisation would also produce a dimensional change , probably an elongation in the same direction as that affected by the sulphonic group ; a methyl group in the ^-position might be expected to produce an elongation in the same direction .
Finally , it is to be supposed that one parameter in each of the salts would correspond more or less closely with either the x or the value of rhombohedral benzene , i.e. with 3T40 or 3-616 ; the other should be considerably greater .
It is noteworthy , therefore , that in the three salts under consideration the y parameter approaches as closely as can be expected to the y value , 3-616 , of jp-diiodobenzene , the third parameter being considerably elongated and varying according to the nature of the compound .

5 1030 : 3-6758 : 2*6656 As the argument adopted in the previous communication and also in the present has been that there is close analogy in structure between p-diiodo-benzene and the sulphonates of pseudo-trigonal form , this close correspondence between the salts of the monad metals and the diiodo-compound might be regarded as an indication that these latter salts are also of pseudo-trigonal form .
If this point of view be accepted , the y values should be trebled and , therefore , are not to be compared with those of the salts of bivalent metals .
A second possibility , however , is that in some cases the structure of the salts of monad metals is similar to that which appears to be characteristic of those of dyad metals now to be discussed , two atoms of the monad metal taking the place of the dyad .
Probably such questions as these will be settled only by the study of the optical properties of the salts or by the application of methods such as are now being developed involving the use of X-rays .
Passing to the salts of bivalent metals , the marked elongation of the x parameter is the striking feature ( see table , p. 307 ) .
It is scarcely possible to doubt that the influence of the metallic atoms is exercised from a mean position between two " lines " of benzene molecules which become thrust apart by the intrusion of the sulphonic radicles connected in pairs with the metallic atoms and the attendant molecules of water .
This mode of arrangement is represented in fig. 11 , which is drawn to scale in the manner already explained .
Mr. E. H. Rod .
On contrasting the parameter values with the dimensions of the full-line figure , which is constructed from the assumed parameter values of rbombo-hedral benzene and the valency volume of the salt , it appears that whilst slight compression is exercised in one direction ( that of there is a corresponding expansion in the direction at right angles to x. This alteration , which is shown by the broken line figure , corresponds to that involved in the case of trigonal salts in the compression of the irregular figure into the triangular form .
It may be taken to represent the orienting influence exercised at and from the centre of the metallic atom .
It appears to be a noteworthy point that whereas in the case of the salts of triad and monad metals a perfect cleavage plane exists in the plane of the layers of benzene , no such cleavage is manifest in salts of the dyad metals .
On reference to fig. 6 , it is noticeable that whereas , in the case of the triad metallic salts , the three hydrogen atoms displaced are in one plane , the two atoms displaced by the salts of the dyad metal are in different planes .
Obviously if the atoms thus displaced were those belonging to different benzene molecules in two superposed layers , the benzene layers would be tied together and it is not only conceivable but to be expected that in such a case there would be no cleavage plane .
The present inquiry has shown that in selecting for study paradibromo-benzenesulphonic acid and the rare earths a peculiarly fortunate choice was made , as attempts to use other acids and other oxides of tervalent metals have been attended with but little success .
The acids used unsuccessfully include ^-diiodobenzenesulphonic , p - bromobenzenesulphonic , 1*3 - dibromobenzene-4-sulphonic , T3-dibromobenzene-5-sulphonic , m-nitrobenzenesulphonic and m- and p-benzenedisulphonic acids .
The salts derived from p-diiodobenzene-sulphonic acid are noteworthy on account of their slight solubility in water ; they crystallise in thin flakes unsuitable for goniometric measurement .
The following figures show how much less soluble the salts of the diiodo-acid are than those of the dibromo-acid :\#151 ; Fig. 11 Morphological Studies in the Benzene Series Salt .

Anhydrous salt dissolved per 100 grm. water at 25'1 ' C. 4'52 grm. 6-81 " " Of the salts of the other acids used , none crystallised well from water , most of them being very soluble ; nor were better results obtained when either alcohol or ethylic acetate or mixtures of these with water were used as solvents .
In the hope of gaining information which would be of service in determining the position of the rare earths in the periodic scheme of classification , the ferric , chromium and aluminium salts of ^\gt ; -dibromobenzenesulphonic acid were studied ; unfortunately , these all crystallise with much water in masses of very fine needles and have not been obtained in measurable form .
The normal ferric salt , a white compound , is stable only in presence of an excess of acid : water readily hydrolyses it into a yellow basic salt , Fe(0H)(C6H3Br2S03)2.12II20 ; this is further decomposed by water in neutral solution and converted into a more basic salt the composition of which has not been determined .
Although it has not therefore been possible to establish any morphotropic relationship between the salts of the rare earth metals and those of other tervalent metals , yet it is extremely probable that some such relationship does exist .
In this connexion , it is interesting to note that Bodman* has shown that the nitrates of didymium and bismuth are isodimorphous and crystallise together .
The p-Dibromobenzenesulphonates of Iron , Chromium and Aluminium .
The following is a brief account of these salts , which have not hitherto been described .

Ferric p-dibromobenzenesulphonate.\#151 ; Ferric hydroxide dissolves only to a limited extent in jp-dibromobenzenesulphonic acid .
The solution so obtained is dark yellow when hot but colourless when cold ; it deposits the normal ferric salt in the form of a mass of very fine white needles .
This salt cannot be recrystallised from water , since it is stable only in presence of excess of acid .
For analysis it was filtered from the solution , washed with cold water and dried on a porous plate ; on standing , it gradually became yellow , owing to loss of water .

The present account is an extension of the previous communication in which it was shown that the ^-dibromobenzenesulphonates of several of the tervalent rare-earth metals all crystallise in pseudo-trigonal forms .
In the light of the Barlow-Pope hypothesis these are to be regarded as so constituted that the molecules are arranged in layers in a plane at right angles to the pseudo-trigonal axis .
Each such layer appears to be of the thickness attributed to a single layer of benzene molecules in crystalline benzene or one of its halogen derivatives .
In the formation of the sulphonate the benzene structure is opened out to admit of the introduction of the sulphonic radicles , of the metallic atoms and of water molecules between the benzene molecules in such manner that the trigonal symmetry of the original structure is either preserved or at most only slightly modified .
It is now shown that similar conclusions may be drawn with reference to the structure of |\gt ; -dichlorobenzenesulphonic acid , several salts of which isomorphous with ^-dibromobenzenesulphonates are described .
The structure of sulphonates containing monad and dyad metals is also discussed .
It is argued that in the formation of the latter the molecules of benzene in contiguous rows become separated by the intervention of the sulphonic radicles ( together with water ) which are united in pairs by the metallic atom .
The structure of the salts containing monad metals appears in some cases to be pseudo-trigonal like that of the acid ; in others to resemble that of salts of dyad metals .
Diagrams to scale are given illustrating the molecular structure of the several types of crystal .
It is proposed to study the optical properties of crystals of salts such as those described , in the hope of discovering criteria significant of the several types .

319 The tube D had been lined inside with shellac to obviate such an occurrence but it was thought that discharge might take place from the aluminium window , 1 mm. diameter , which , of course , could not be covered with shellac .
An earthed ring electrode was accordingly placed at E , so as to prevent such discharge reaching the lining of the tube A. Then the discharge tube was started , using cathode rays of given speed , and the ionisation in the long cylinder due to the Rontgen rays was measured for different voltages applied to the cylinder .
The cylinder in this experiment contained air at a pressure of 10 cm .
, so that saturation could be obtained at much lower voltages than 400 volts .
Hence any deviation from the usual form of saturation curve was to be attributed to a subsidiary discharge in the vacuum tube , due to the air insulation breaking down under the voltage applied to the tube D. Table I shows the values of the resistance P necessary to balance the electroscope when cathode rays of speed from 7 x 109 to 9 x 109 cm./ sec. were used .
P would , in the ordinary way , be proportional to the ionisation in the long cylinder per unit cathode ray current , and , if saturation were obtained , would be constant , in spite of altering the voltage applied to the long cylinder .
How , from fig. 5 we see that saturation actually is attained under these conditions .
Hence any change in P as the voltage is altered would indicate a disturbed value for the cathode ray current , due to a subsidiary discharge which might be expected to increase with the voltage applied .
From Table I we must conclude that no abnormal effect comes in till the pressure in the vacuum tube is such that cathode rays of speed 9 x 109 cm./ sec. are produced .

We have placed the long cylinder properly in alignment , and have shown that the Rontgen rays cannot strike the curved surface of this cylinder and that they are totally absorbed by the gas inside .
