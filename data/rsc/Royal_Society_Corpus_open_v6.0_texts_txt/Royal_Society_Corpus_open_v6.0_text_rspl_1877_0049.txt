In anticipation of a detailed account of our researches in voltaic ele\lt ; tricity , which have engaged our attention for nearly three years , we vei ture to publish , as of interest to the electrician , an account of the resul ; obtained with two spherical surfaces of 3 inches radius and 1-5 inc diameter .
It will be seen that they differ materially from those whit occur from the employment of a point for one terminal and a flat disk ft the other , with which the striking-distance is in the ratio of the squai of the number of cells up to 8040 , as has already been stated to be tl case up to 2400 cells ( Proc. Roy .

This agrees with Sir William Thom ' son 's experience .

At certain pressures there is only one stratum , then , as the pressure is diminished , two , three , and so on , each being added on from the positive pole .
We succeed easily in obtaining photographs of the phenomena , as the strata can generally be made to remain stationary for some time .
Several of the photographs are in the hands of the engraver to be copied , and we hope to be able to show the history of several tubes in a communication we are now drawing up .

( Abstract .
) In the first paper of this subject it was shown that by the action of chlorine on a normal paraffin a primary chloride and a secondary one of the general formula CwHg+1 j CHC1 are formed simultaneously* .
It appeared of interest also to examine the action of bromine on the paraffins .
The present paper contains the first results of this research .
I. Normal Hexane.\#151 ; When bromine vapour is passed into the vapour of the boiling hydrocarbon , in the daylight , its colour disappears quickly and substitution products are formed which are partly decomposed by distillation .
The portion distilling without decomposition consists of a * Phil. Trans , vol. 162 , part i. p. 111 .
