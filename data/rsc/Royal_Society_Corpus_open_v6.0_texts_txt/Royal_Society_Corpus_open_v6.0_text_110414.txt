A paper was read , entitled , " On the Arcs of certain Parabolic Curves .
" By Henry Fox Talbot , Esq. , M.P. , F.R.S. The general equation to parabolic curves , ( namely , nu = un ; where u is the abscissa and v the ordinate , ) gives for the are of the curve an expression which , excepting in a very few instances , is transcendental .
But although the length of an are , considered by itself , cannot be as ?
signed algebraically , yet it frequently happens that the sum of two or more arcs is capable of being so assigned , and sometimes in a very simple manner .
The author has found this reduction to take place in so many instances , as to incline him to believe that it may be uni ?
versally possible , provided the exponent ( ?
) of the ordinate in the equation to the curve is a rational quantity of these reductions : he gives a great number of examples ; but although the processes for that purpose are easy , the difficulty consists wholly in finding the proper method of treating each individual case .
The author hopes to lay before the Society , on a future occasion , an account of the principles on which this branch of analysis is founded .
