motor cells is represented in fig. 4 .
It was drawn from a section of the cord ( of the same fish from which fig. 1 was taken ) , about six inches in front of the electric organ .
It closely resembles , except in size , the electric cell ( fig. 1 ) , and it also resembles the large motor cells of the Mammalian cord .
A motor cell from the spinal cord of a Mammal , drawn to the same scale as the other cells given , is represented in fig. 5.* This cell , smaller than the electric cell of the Skate ( 1 ) , and still smaller than the cell from Torpedo ( 3 ) , is about the same size as the electric cell of Gymnotus ( 2 ) .
With the help of sections through a series of embryo Skate , for most of which I was indebted to Dr. Beard , I have been able to study the development of the cells in the Skate 's electric centre .
This part of the subject , together with the condition of the electric cells in large fish , will be dealt with in a subsequent communication .
It may , however , be stated now : 1 .
That in embryos under 5 cm .
in length none of the motor cells in the caudal region have undergone enlargement , 2 .
That in an embryo 5'8 cm .
in length , although the muscular fibres seemed still unchanged , certain cells in the anterior horn of the caudal portion of the cord were distinctly larger than similarly shaped cells in their vicinity .
3 .
That in an embryo 15-5 cm .
in length , in which the electrical elements were already well developed , the electric nerve-cells were large and conspicuous , so that sections through the cord in the region of the electric organ presented quite a different appearance from sections through the root of the tail , where no change had taken place in the cells of the anterior horn .
