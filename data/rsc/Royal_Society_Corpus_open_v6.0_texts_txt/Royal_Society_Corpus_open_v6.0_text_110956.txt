" On the Lunar Atmospheric Tide at St. Helena .
" By Lieut. Colonel Edward Sabine , R.Ao , For .
Sec. R.S. The results of the observations made by Captain Lefroy , of the Royal Artillery , Director of the Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory at St. Helena , are here given ; from which it appears , on the examination of the barometrical changes during seventeen months , that a maximum of pressure corresponds to the moon 's passage over both the inferior and superior meridians , being slightly greater in the latter case , and that a minimum corresponds nearly to the rising and setting , or to six hours before and after the former periods .
The average atmospheric pressures are 28'2714 , inches in the first case , and 28*2675 in the last ; the difference being 0'0039 inch .
The height of the cistern of the barometer above the sea is 1764 feet ; and the latitude of the Observatory 15ยง 57 ' S. These results were still further confirmed by those of a series of observations during two years .
These observations also establish the conclusion that the moon exerts a greater influence on the amount of atmospheric pressure at the periods of her perigee than at those of her apogee .
