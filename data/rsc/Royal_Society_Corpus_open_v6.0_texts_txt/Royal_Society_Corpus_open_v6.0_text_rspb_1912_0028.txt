) The action of B. subtilis ( Cohn ) , B. vulgatus ( Fliigge ) { B. vulgatus ( Fliigge ) Migula ) , and Tyrothrix tenuis ( Duclaux ) { B. tenuis ( Duclaux ) L. and N. ) on various substances has been investigated by Per4 ( 1 ) .
This observer , on distilling his various culture media , obtained lsevo-rotatory distillates strongly reducing to Fehling 's solution .
In all cases he concluded that the volatile substance present was glyceraldehyde , and upon his results based a theory that sugars undergoing bacterial fermentation break down primarily to a triose , that is to say , glycerose .
He was , however , unable to characterise his compound satisfactorily ; for .example , it did not give Schiffs reaction , no osazone was obtainable , and although in some cases he obtained small quantities of lead , calcium , and barium salts of an acid formed by the oxidation of his volatile substance with nitric acid , which he took for salts of glyceric acid , the quantities analysed were so small that no reliance can be placed upon the results .
Moreover , none of his salts was obtained in crystalline form .
Soon after the appearance of Pore 's work Wohl ( 2 ) succeeded in preparing glyceraldehyde in a pure state , and found that it was non-volatile in steam , that it gave Schiff 's reaction , and also formed a highly characteristic osazone , M.P. 131 ' C. It seemed therefore impossible that the volatile substance obtained by P6r4 could have been glyceraldehyde , and a further investigation of the subject has therefore been made .
In a previous communication ( 3 ) the action of B. lactis aerogenes and B. cloacce on many carbohydrates , alcohols , etc. , has been described .
With glycerol itself the liquid obtained on distilling the culture medium was absolutely without reducing power .
In the majority of cases , however , the distillate possessed reducing power which was shown to be due not to the presence of glyceraldehyde , but to that of acetylmethylcarbinol , CH3 CH(OH)-COCH3 , the substance responsible for theVogesand Proskauer reaction ( 4 ) , which had previously been observed as a product of the bacterial fermentation of glucose by Grimbert ( 5 ) .
The above experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions , but Walpole ( 6 ) has shown that * For first part see paper read February 1 , B , vol. 84 .

Production of [ Jan. 25 , the yield of carbinol may be increased by aerobic culture .
The whole of P4r^ 's experiments were carried out under aerobic conditions , and although he employed different organisms from those given above , they have all been shown by Desmots ( 7 ) to be capable of producing acetylmethylcarbinol under suitable circumstances .
Desmots , in fact , describes experiments very similar to those carried out by P4r^ , but makes no mention of the possible formation of glyceraldehyde .
It seems therefore not at all unlikely that P4r4 's volatile reducing substance was acetylmethylcarbinol and not glyceraldehyde .
His experiments have accordingly been repeated , using identical culture media and conditions of growth , and the results of these investigations form the subject of the present communication .
In addition to repeating P4r4 's experiments a quantitative estimation of the action of B. lactis aerogenes on glycerol has been made .
In this case neither acetylmethylcarbinol nor glyceraldehyde is obtained .
Action of B. subtilis and B. mesentericus vulgatus on Mannitol and Tyrothrix tenuis on Glucose .
The culture media were made up exactly in the same way as those used by P4r4 , and in the case of the first two organisms named consisted of 20 grm. , of mannitol in 200 c.c. water containing 2 grm. ammonium phosphate , 1 grm. ammonium sulphate , and 0*4 grm. potassium phosphate .
For the experiment with Tyrothrix tenuis 5 grm. of glucose were made up to 100 c.c. with broth. .
After sterilisation and inoculation with the organism in question , the various culture media were incubated at 37 ' C. In every case growth was continued for 30 days , after which time the cultures were worked up according to* Perm 's directions .
To take one example\#151 ; the action of B. subtilis on mannitol\#151 ; after the 30 days ' incubation the culture medium was made acid with citric acid and distilled , the distillate was found to be strongly reducing and lsevo-rotatory , and also gave a very strong Yoges and Proskauer reaction , , which is characteristic of acetylmethylcarbinol , but is not given by glyceraldehyde .
The remaining distillate was then made alkaline and again distilled , yielding a second time a reducing lsevo-rotatory body giving the Yoges and Proskauer reaction .
This second distillate was then steam-distilled for three hours , and by the end of that time the whole of the reducing body had passed over with the steam , the residue being non-reducing and optically inactive .
The steam distillate , on the other hand , was still lsevo-rotatory , , reducing , and gave the Yoges and Proskauer reaction .
An osazone was prepared from this distillate and gave a definite melting point of 243 ' O. , , corresponding to the phenylosazone of diacetyl , which is always obtained from acetylmethylcarbinol in this manner .
In a similar way the action of 1912.1 Acetylmethylcarbinol and Z.Z-Butylene Glycol .
75- B. mesentemcus vulgatus and Tyrothrixtenuis on mannitol and glucose respectively was also examined and similai results obtained .
The Action of Tyrothrix tenuis on Glycerol .
This offered a case of much greater interest , as the formation of acetylmethylcarbinol would involve a carbon synthesis , and does not take place from this substance when B. lactis is used under anaerobic conditions .
P^rt^ 's directions were again carefully followed , 5 grm. of glycerol were made up to 100 ' C. with broth , and , after sterilisation and subsequent inoculation , were incubated at 37 ' C. for 30 days .
An investigation of the culture medium , as described above , again showed the presence of acetylmethylcarbinol , which passed over into the distillate , and was characterised by the preparation and analysis of the osazone , as well as by the Voges and Proskauer reaction .
The lead , calcium , and barium salts of the oxidation products analysed by P4r4 , and believed by him to be the salts of glyceric acid , were in all probability the salts of lactic acid .
As he was only able to analyse extremely small quantities ( 0'032 grm. of a lead salt containing 50 per cent. Pb ) of non-crystalline substances , the experimental error was probably too great for him to distinguish between these two acids .
There is therefore no evidence to show that glyceraldehyde is produced in the above fermentations , and the theory that sugars undergoing bacterial fermentation are first broken down to trioses derives no support from this investigation .
The Action o/ B. lactis aerogenes ( Bsche on Glycerol under Anaerobic Conditions .
The experiments previously described were all carried out under aerobic conditions , and , as an example of anaerobic decomposition , the action of B. lactis aerogenes on glycerol has been studied .
This organism under these conditions forms acetylmethylcarbinol from all the hexoses , but produces none from glycerol , no reducing substance at all being found among the products of the reaction .
The method of investigation was substantially that used by Harden ( 8 ) , the gases , however , being collected and measured in the apparatus devised by Harden , Thompson , and Young ( 9 ) .
The organism was grown in an atmosphere of nitrogen , the medium consisting of 1 per cent. Witte 's peptone solution containing 10 per cent , of glycerol , sufficient chalk being added to neutralise the acids formed during fermentation .
In the glycerol experiments quoted* the times of growth were respectively five weeks , 76 Dr. A. Harden and Mrs. D. Norris .
Production of [ Jan. 25 , two weeks , and four weeks .
A different strain of the organism was used in Experiment 1 from that used in Experiments 2 and 3 .
The glycerol added , and the amount unfermented , were estimated by means of the method of Zeisel and Fanto ( 10 ) , as described below .
Estimation of the Residual Glycerol.\#151 ; 100 c.c. of the liquid in which the organism had grown were evaporated at a low temperature under reduced pressure , in order to ensure the removal of all alcohol .
The residue was then taken up in a small quantity of water , the volume made up to 100 c.c. with water , and 5 c.c. of this solution taken for the estimation .
Search for Acetylmethylcarlinol.\#151 ; A portion of the culture medium was distilled and the distillate tested for reducing power with Fehling 's solution .
In every case the distillate was found to be non-reducing and the absence of acetylmethylcarbinol was further confirmed by trying the Yoges and Proskauer reaction , which was invariably negative .
It was also found impossible to prepare any osazone .
Detection of 2.3-Butylene Glycol.\#151 ; This substance was detected and estimated as previously described , the estimation being made on 300 c.c. of the culture medium in which the organism had been grown .
In every experiment this glycol was found tojbe present , the other products being ethyl alcohol , formic , lactic , and succinic acids , carbon dioxide , and hydrogen .
The diacetylphenylosazone prepared from the oxidation product of the butylene glycol was analysed and gave the following results:\#151 ; 0T372 grm. substance gave 0*3656 grm. COa and 0*0876 grm. HaO .
C = 72*6 per cent. ; H = 7 per cent. 0*0950 grm. substance gave 17*5 c.c. N at 21 ' C and 765*5 mm. N = 21*12 per cent. C16H18N4 requires C = 72*2 per cent. , H = 6*8 per cent. , 1ST = 21*05 per cent. The lactic acid produced was also characterised by the preparation and analysis of the zinc salt and by Fletcher and Hopkins ' reaction ( 11 ) .
0*1500 grm. of the zinc salt dried at 105 ' O. gave 0*0499 grm. ZnO .
ZnO = 33*28 per cent. ( C3H503)aZn requires ZnO = 33*4 per cent. The analysis of the calcium salt prepared from the succinic acid formed gave the following results:\#151 ; 0*0550 grm. substance gave 0*0202 grm. CaO .
CaO = 36*7 per cent. ( C^iO^Ca requires CaO = 35*9 per cent. The pure acid was also isolated in this case and gave M.P. 183-4 ' C. The percentage of these substances on the weight of glycerol fermented is shoym in the following table , Columns 1 , 2 , and 3 .

It is interesting to find that alcohol accounts for 35'2 per cent , of the glycerol used , as against 17'1 per cent , in the case of glucose .
Harden suggested ( 8 ) that the source of the alcohol might be the presence in the molecule undergoing decomposition of the terminal group CH2(OH)*CH(OH)- .
This was confirmed in the case of glucose and mannitol , this latter substance yielding twice the amount of alcohol produced under similar conditions from 78 Production of Acetylmethylcarbinol and 2.3-Butylene Glycol .
glucose .
It would be interesting to find whether the same relationship holds in the case of glycerol and glyceraldehyde .
Formic acid ( or its decomposition products , C02 and H2 ) and alcohol , which might he formed according to the equation C3H803 = C2H60 + ch2o2 , make up 64\#151 ; 77 per cent , of the glycerol fermented .
Summary .
1 .
The volatile reducing substance obtained by P4r4 in the aerobic fermentation of mannitol by B. subtilis and B. mesentericus vulgatus , and of glucose and glycerol by Tyrothrix tenu , is acetylmethylcarbinol , which is readily volatile in steam , gives the Yoges and Proskauer reaction , and forms the phenylosazone of diacetyl .
2 .
The action of B. lactis aerogenes on glycerol , under anaerobic conditions , does not give rise to any reducing substance .
The products of this decomposition have been quantitatively estimated and ; are as follows:\#151 ; Ethyl alcohol , formic , acetic , lactic and succinic acids , carbon dioxide , hydrogen and 2.3-butylene glycol .
[ .
Note added February 29 , 1912.\#151 ; Since writing the foregoing paper our attention has been called to a paper by Fernbach* in which he shows that T. tenuis acts both on glucose and glycerol with the production of nonvolatile dihydroxyacetone .
Volatile reducing substances were also formed which he regards as a mixture of methylglyoxal and formaldehyde .
Since neither of these substances is optically active they cannot be identical with the lsevo-rotatory substance obtained by Pere and ourselves , so that Fern-bach 's observations in no way disprove our conclusion that the optically active , volatile substance produced is acetylmethylcarbinol .
