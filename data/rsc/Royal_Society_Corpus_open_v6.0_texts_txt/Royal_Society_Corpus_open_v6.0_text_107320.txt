Or the Attraction of such Solids as are terminalted by Plans ; and of Solids of greatest Attraction .
By Thomas Knight , Esq. Communicated by Sir H. Davy , LL. D. Sec. R. S. Read March 19 , 1812 .
IATHENMATICIAN , in treating of the attraction of bodies , have confined their attention , almost entirely , to those solids which are bounded by continuous curve surfaces ; and Mr. PLAYFAIR , if I do not mistake , is the only writer , who has given any example of that kind of inquiry , which is the chief object of the present paper .
This learned mathematician has found expressions * for the action of a parallelopiped ; and of an isosceles pyramid , with a rectangular base , on a point at its vertex ; and observes , on occasion of the first mentioned problem , that what he has there done , " gives some hopes of c being able to deternine generally the attraction of solids bounded by any planes whatever .
" It is this general problem , that I venture to attempt the solution of , in what follows : viz , any solid , regular or irregular , terminated by plane surfaces , being given , to find , both in quantity and direction , ts action , on a point , given in position , either within or without it .
Nor has the matter any difficulty , as far as theory* only is concerned ; although , actually to find the attraction , of a body of very complicated figure , may , no doubt , be exceedingly laborious and troublesome : for no one , I suppose , will conceive , that it can be done in any other manner , than by a previous partition into more simple forms , each of which must have its action found separately .
Having completed this part of my subject in the three first sections , I next apply the formulas , given in ? .
i , to find the attraction of certain complex bodies , which , though not bounded by planes , have yet a natural connexion with the preceding part of the paper .
Finally , the fifth section treats , pretty fully , of solids of greatest attraction , under various circumstances ; and I do not know , that any one of the problems there given has been before considered by mathematicians ; whilst , on the other hand , the results of former writers are easily derived as corollaries .
For the sake of perspicuity , I have divided the paper into .
propositions , and shall terminate this short introduction by expressing a hope , that I may not be chargeable with unnecessary prolixity . ?
.L .
Of the Attraction of Planes bounded by right Lines .
As all such figures may be divided into triangles , it seems natural to begin with these .
Prop. i. Let rvm , fig. i , be a triangle , right angled at r , and pm a right line , perpendicular to the plane of the triangle , at the angular point m ; it is required to find the attraction of the triangle , on the point p , both in quantity and direction .
Conceive a plane to pass through the point p , parallel to the plane of the triangle , and , in it , the lines pg , po , respectively parallel to rm , rv .
The problem will be solved , if we find the actions of the triangle , in the directions of the three rectangular co-ordinates pm , pg , po .
Draw ks parallel to rv , and put a= pm , b =rm , T= mk , t kq ; then pq = V/ a +I'+ t. Let r= tang .
vmr , then ks rx km .
The element of the plane at q is Tx t , and its action , on p , ti .
in the direction pq , is , --~- " ; by resolving which , and putting A , B , C for the actions of the triangle , in the directions pm , pg , po , we get Azzjf TII It B ff Ttt A==/ Ta it_ ; B =f Ti t C_Jf Tt t * ; ( az+ T(+ta ) ( a+T +t)i ( a+ T2+t)2 in all which expressions , we must first take the fluent , with respect to t , from t= o , tt rT ; and afterwards , with respect to T , Irom T= o , to T= b. To begin with A , a first operation gives Ta rTT A -= ___Z__ t ( a+ T2 ) ( a2 +(I r2)T2)z which , if we put 3=1+ r ' , wil be changed to A'_ , f_____arTT ( a + " ) I+ TZ 249 a a a , Put T= .

Cor. i. If , whilst r remains constant , b and a are supposed to vary , but so as to preserve the same ratio to each other , the 251 partial forces A , B , C will remain unchanged , as , consequently , will the total force , both in quantity and direction .
For , if we put mxa for b , the expressions of the forces become w ) ( t , , r ) arc ( tang .
r ) , ( i , m , r ) , , ( i , m , r ) ; which are independent of the absolute values of a and b. It is scarcely necessary to , observe , that arc ( tang .
- ) is the arc , to the radius unity , corresponding to the angle rvm .
Cor. 2 .
When r becomes infinite , the triangle rmv is chatnged into a parallelogram , infinitely extended in the direction rv ; in which case , the expressions of the forces become very b/ va " Gbz simple , viz. A arc ( tang .

b+ V/ a+ b1 a Prop. 2 .
Let vmu , fig. b , be any triangle whatever , pm a line perpendicular to the plane of the triangle , at the angular point m from whence , let fall the perpendicular mr on the opposite side uv ; moreover , let pg , po , be respectively parallel to Inr , vu .
It is required to find the actions of the triangle vmu on the point p , in the directions pm , pg , po .
If we keep the same denotinations as before , and put , besides , r'= tang .
umr , it is plain from the last proposition , and because the action of the whole must necessarily equal the sum of the actions of its parts , that A3 ( a , b , r ) +q ( a , b , " )-arc ( tang .
= ) -arc ( tang.= ) ; B=X ( a , b , r ) x(a , b , r ' ) ; C ( a , b , r ) ( a , b , r ' ) .
When umv is a right angle , we shall evidently have arc ( tang .
=)+ arc ( tang .
7-r ) = being the number 3,1415 , &amp;c. : this makes the expression for A somewhat simpler , in that case .
If it is the triangle vmu ' whose attraction we seek , we have , putting r ' = tang .
u'mr , A= ( a , b , r)-(p(a , b , r ' ) arc(tang.=-)+arc(tang.= r ; B-=%(a , b , r)--x(a , b , r ' ) ; C / ( a , b , r)--/ ( a-b , r ' ) .
Cor. i. As a rhombus may be divided , from its centre , into four-equal triangles , like that in fig. 2 , but right angled at m , the angle lying at the centre ; if b represent a perpendicular from the centre of a rhombus on one of its sides , and r and r ' the tangents of the angles , that this perpendicular makes , at the centre , with the semi-diameters of the figure , we shall have for the action of the rhombus , on a point situated perpendicularly over its centre , at the distance a , A= q4 ( a , b , r ) +4 ( a , b , r ' ) 2r .
Cor. 2 .
As any plane , terminated by right lines , may be divided into triangles from a point within it , we may find , by means of this proposition , the attraction of such a plane , on a point above it , both in quantity and direction .
Let , for example , uvu'v'u , fig. 6 , be the plane , p the attracted point ; let fall the perpendicular pm on the plane , and from m draw right lines to the angles u , v , u ' , v ' ; the plane will thus be divided into triangles , situated , with respect to the point p , like that in the proposition .
The attraction may still be found , if the perpendicular should fall without the figure ; as in Prop. 3 .
To find the attraction of a triangle umv , fig. 3 , on a point p any how situated .
Let fall from p the perpendicular pTm ' , on the plane of the triangle ; join m 'm , m'u , m'v .
Find , by the last Prop. the attractions of the triangles m'uv , m'um , m'vm , on the point p ; and resolve them into others in the directions of any three rectangular co-ordinates : and , when thus resolved , let the actions of f'V 1 in the directions of these I , , C 4m'um A , B ' , C ' 1m J co-ordinates be " B| , C ' Lm'vmj LA , B " , C. J It is plain , that the actions of the triangle umv , on p , in the directions of the same co-ordinates , will be A A ' -A " ; B -B-B"C ; CC ' -C " .
There may be other cases of this proposition , in which the triangle and point are placed differently , with respect to each other , from what I have represented in fig. 3 ; but the reader , who understands the case that has been considered , will have no difficulty in any other that may occur .
Though the preceding propositions contain every thing that is necessary , for finding the attraction , both in quantity and direction , of any plane bounded by right lines ; yet there are some cases worthy of a particular notice : as Prop. 4 .
To find the attraction of a rectangle mrvr ' , fig. 4 , on a point p situated perpendicularly over one of its corners as m. Draw pg , po , parallel to mr , mr ' , the sides of the rectangle ; put b= rm , b ' =-r 'm , r tang .
rmv , r ' = tang .
r'my : then , if 55 A , B , C represent the actions of the rectangle , in the directions pm , pg , po , we find , by means of Proposition 1 , A= p(a , b , r ) + ( a , b'r')2B ( a , b , r ) +H / ( a , b ' , r ' ) ; C ( a , b , r ) +x ( a , b ' , r ' ) .
We may eliminate r and r ' , from these expressions , by b ' b means of their values -b and -T ; and thus we may put A under a very simple form .
It becomes , at first , b va2+ bb-rbz ' b\ A =arc ( tang .
=^x a+ arc ( tang.b 4a+zb"+b , fa1 But , by trigonometry , a and P representing any angles whatever , tang .
( a + g. = : the application of i tang .
aX tang .
which formula gives us , instead of the foregoing expression , A= arc ( tang.= bb 8+ b+ b'~ - ) and this again is easily changed into the following form , A -=arc tang .
= a. -Tb ) , which is easily perceived to be the same as Mr. PLAYFAIR'S expression .
In a similar manner , might the expressions for B and C be simplified : but it is perhaps easier to find new forms , ab initio .
Thus we may get B immediately , from the double integral B =ff ( - , +I ^ , if the fluent , with respect to t , be taken from t=o to t= b ' ; and , with respect to T , from T=o to b ' TI T= b. The first integration gives B =CJ-(a+ ))(aT+b'--+l')t and , by the second , a+ b ' a ' , V ' LlI It is plain that , to find C , we need only change b into b ' , and the reverse , in the last expression , whence +f4+b Tz bZt bi ' bC -L L. - ; +bb ?
b* a Vra+ b ' , Prop 5 .
To find the attraction of a regular polygon , on a point situated perpendicularly over its centre .
As this figure is composed of isosceles triangles , if we put b for the perpendicular from the centre on one of the sides , and r for the tangent of half the angle at the centre , subtended by one of those sides , we have , by Prop. i , for a polygon of n sides , A == 2n arc ( tang .
'+ ) arc ( tang .
r az r/ which , because the last term =(n -2 ) ) , by Euclid 1.iss Cor. 1 , is *o &gt; -_ -i Z ' r- , A=n arc ( tang .
=+I6 ( n ) 2 .
Prop. 6 .
To find the attraction of a circle , on a point situated perpendicularly over its centre .
This is only a particular case of the last proposition , when n is infinitely great and r infinitely small .
It is easy to see , that the arc whose tangent is / 1 ' +L + ; b will have for its cosine r^ if we keep only the first power of r ; consequently we may put it under the form arc ) in c='2 - , a very nearly ; this multiW plied by 2n is nxr vnra nbz r -a2 by putting vr for:r .
If we substitute this value in the expression for a regular polygon , it becomes A= ir i -- , a the well known expression of NEWTON . ? .
IT .
Of the Attraction of Pyramids , and generally of any Solids whatever that are bounded by Planes .
The simplest case of the attraction of such bodies as we are to consider , is that of a pyramid with the attracted point at the vertex : and it fortunately happens , that on this simple case the action of any body whatever may be made to depend ; which is the reason of my placing the general problem in this section , though I afterwards treat separately of prisms .
This facility , in the case of pyramids , results from what was shown in Cor. i. Prop. i , viz. that if we put x for a and mx for b , in the functions p ( a , b , r ) , ( a , b , r ) , ( ( a , b , r ) , they will become p( 1 , m , r ) , %( i , m , r ) d ( i , m , r ) , into which x does not enter .
Prop. 7 .
Let figure 5 represent a pyramid with a triangular base umv , the vertex p of the solid being in a line pm , perpendicular to the triangle at the angular point m. It is required to find the action of the pyramid on a point at that vertex .
Draw the perpendicular mr , also pg , po parallel to mr , rv .
Join pr , and let r 'm ' be parallel to rm .
Call pm ' , x ; r 'm ' , y ; then y =mx , m being the tangent of the angle rpm .
The attraction of a triangular section of the solid , made by a plane , s * .
passing through r 'm ' , parallel to the base , will be found by Prop. 2 , if we put x for a , and mx for b ; and is in the respec .
tive directions , gp p , po .

=I )arc ( tang .
r ' )B =-x( , m , - ) 4r xX ( 1i , ) , ; C x= ( i , , r)x ( 1 , m , , ) .
If the pyramid , whose action we were seeking , had been that whose is u'my , we must have used the other values of A , B , C given in Prop. 2 .
Prop. 8 .
Let fig. 6 represent any pyramid whatever , whose base uvu'v'u is terminated by right lines ; to find its attraction , on a point at the vertex p , both in quantity and direction .
Let a perpendicular from p meet the base at m , and draw lines from this point to all the angles u , v , &amp;c. of the base .
It is plain , that the solid will thus be divided into such pyramids as were considered in the last proposition ; so that the problem is already solved .
Cor. We may apply this to the pyramid whose base is a rhombus , and the vertex placed perpendicularly over its centre .
By proceeding as in the proposition , it will be divided into four equal triangular pyramids ; and , using for each of them the notation of Prop. 7 , we have for the action of the whole rhomboidal pyramid , on a point at its vertex , A= 4cp ( i , m , r ) + 4x ( ( i , r r ' ) 2X The other attractions evidently destroy each other .
It is not necessary , in the above proposition , that the per .
pendicular pm should fall within the base ; if it falls without , we shall however have occasion for the following problem .
Prop. 9 .
Let umv , fig. g , be any triangle whatever , pa point any how situated with respect to it ; join pm , pu , pv.* It is required to find the attraction of the oblique pyramid pumv , whose base is the triangle umv , on a point at the vertex p. Let fall , from p , the perpendicular pm ' on the plane of the base umv , draw the lines mr 'm , m'u , m'v .
Find , by Prop. 7 , the attractions of the pyramids pm'uv , pmo'um , pm'vm , whose bases are m'uv , m'um , m 'v , and their common vertex p. Resolve these attractions into others in the directions of any rectangular co-ordinates , and when thus resolved let the actions of the pyramids fpm'uv A , B , C1 Pm,1 in the directions of these I C. pmum &gt; &lt; A ' , B ' , C ' ip Im'rut | co-ordinates be A , , B , C Lpm'vmj LA B " , C " It is plain , that the actions of the pyramid pumv , on the point p , in the directions of the same co-ordinates , will be A A'A " ; B-B'-B " ; C-C'--C " .

Let fig. 4 represent , in every respect , the same as it did in Prop. 4 ; join pr , pv , pr ' ; it is required to find the attraction of the square pyramid pmrvr ' , on the point p at its vertex .

rIz Prop. ii .
Let the base of the pyramid be a regular polygon ; the vertex situated perpendicularly over the centre of the base ; the attracted point at the vertex .
By making use of the expression in Proposition 5 , putting x for a , and mx for b ( m being the tangent of the angle , at the vertex , formed by the axis of the pyramid and a line drawn from the vertex to the middle of one of the sides of the base , we get A= nx are ( tang .
=7 ( +r ( 2)x Hitherto , I have considered the action of a pyramid , only.on a point at its vertex ; the case which next presents itself , is that of the attraction on a point p ' ( fig. 5 and 6 ) any where in the produced axis mpp ' .
It would be easy to give a direct solution to this problem , but I choose rather to make it depend on the propositions that have been already established : and to show that the functions ( ( a , b , r ) X ( a , b , r ) 4 ( a , b , r ) , of which so much use has been made , in the preceding investigations , are sufiicient in all cases of the attraction of bodies bounded by planes .
Prop. 12 .
Let pumv ( fig. 5 ) represent the same pyramid as in Prop. 7 ; to find its attraction on a point p ' in the produced axis .
Suppose p'u , p'v joined , the attraction of the pyramid pumv , on the point p ' , is the difference of the attractions of the pyramids p'umv , p'upv on the same point ; which point being at the common vertex of these two pyramids , their attractions.are found by Propositions 7 and 9 ; and the problem is solved .
Prop.,13 .
Let it now be the action of the pyramid pumv , fig. 7 , ( where the plane of the base umv is not perpendicular to the line mpp ' ) on the point p ' , that is required .
The attraction sought for wiil still be the difference of the cactions of the two pyramids p'umv , p'upv , but these must now both be found by Prop. 9 .

i6 M am Prop. 14 , Figure 6 representing , in every respect , the same as in Prop. 8 , it is required to find the action of the pyramid , on the point p ' , in the produced axis .
As this solid may be divided into others , situated , with respect to pI , like that in Prop. 1 , the problem is solved by what was shown there .
If the attracted point was not in the line p'pm , perpendicular to the base , but in some other line -rpp , passing through the vertex , and meeting the base in ; draw lines from P to all the angles of the base , and the solid will be divided in such pyramids as were treated of in Prop. 13 .
Prop. 15 .
Let pumv , fig. 7 , be any triangular pyramid whatever , and let it be any how cut by a plane , whose intersection with the pyramid is the triangle a , y ; it is required to determine the action of the portion q , yvum ( which is cut off by the plane ) on a point at p. The attraction , of the solid in question , is the difference of the actions of the pyramids pumv and pa/ 3y , which actions are ' found by Prop. 9 .
Prop. 16 , or general Problem .
To fnd the action of any solid , bounded by planes , on a point either within or without it .
It is plain that by drawing lines , from the attracted point through the solid , this may always be divided , either into such pyramids ( with the point at the vertex ) as were considered in Prop. 9 , or into portions of pyramids , like that treated of in Prop. 15 ; and consequently the solution of the problem may be obtained by means of these propositions . ? .

Let the base of the prism be a rhombus , the attracted point in the produced axis of the prism .

264 We will now consider the attractions of prisms more generally .
Prop. to .
Let pr'v'vrm , fig. 8 , be a right prism , whose base is the triangle vrm right angled at r. It is required to determine its attraction on a point at p , in the directions pm , pr ' , po ; po being parallel to r'v ' .
If we wish to obtain a solution by means of what has been already done , we may conceive the solid under consideration to be divided into two pyramids ; viz. the pyramid pmrv with the triangular base mrv ; and the other pyramid pr'v'vr , whose base is the rectangle r'v'vr ; the point p being at the common vertex of both .
Put pm = x , mr = pr ' = x ' ; conceive the diagonal vr ' to be drawn , and put tang .
rmv =tang .
r'pv ' = r ; tang .
v'rr = r ' ; tang .
vr'V ' = r " ; tang .
rpm = m ; tang .
rpr ' = m ' We get immediately , from propositions 7 and io ( putting A , B , C for the respective actions in the directions pm , pr ' , po ) A= x(p ( , m , r ) x arc ( tang.= + x ' ( 1 , ' , r ) + x'4 ( , r , r " ) ; B -x ( i , m , r ) ; 4. .

Thus we may obtain the value of the force A , by the method of the preceding propositions : a triangular section of the prism , parallel to the end r'pv ' , and at a distance x from that end , will have its action on p expressed by p ( x , x ' , r ) arc ( tang .

traction of right prisms , in all cases , may be made to depend on it .
Cor. i. It is in the first place evident , that by means of this proposition , we may find , by parts , the force , both in quantity and direction , with which a point q , any where on the edge pm of the scalene prism represented by fig. 9 , is attracted .
The same may be said of the action on p ' any where in the produced axis ; this will be the difference of the actions of two prisms , like that in the figure .
Cor. .
Moreover , if , instead of the prism in fig. 9 , the point q was placed any where on the edge of a prism whose base is the triangle quv , fig. 10 , the action may still be found ; for it will now depend on the diflerence of the action of such prisms as were treated of in the Proposition ; that is to say , the action of the prism whose base is quv as the difference of the actions of those whose bases are qvr , qur , qr being a perpendicular ton vu produced .
s67 Prop. 21 .
To find the quantity and direction of the attraction of a right prism , whose base is any triangle whatever , on a point any where on its surface .
Let the triangle uvu ' , fig. ii , be a section of the prism , parallel to its base , and through the attracted point p. Let fall the perpendiculars pr , pr ' , on the opposite sides : and the solid may be divided into four prisms , whose bases are the right angled triangles pur , pry , pvr ' , pr'u ' , and the attraction of each of these , both in quantity and direction , is given by Prop. 20 .
It is plain that there may be other cases of this problem , besides the one here considered ; for instance , one of the perpendiculars may fall beyond the base ; but it would be endless , in a subject of this kind , to consider every particular case , and in inone can the intelligent reader find the smallest difficulty .
Prop. 22 .
To find the attraction of any prism , fig. 12 , whose base is a convex polygon uvu'v ' , on a point q any where within it .
As such a solid may be divided into triangular prisms , like those in Prop. 20 and its corollaries , with the attracted point on the common edge pm , the problem is already solved .
If the point be at p ' , in the line mp produced , the action on it may still-be found , being the difference of the actions of two prisms , like that in the figure .
Prop. 23 .
'Let vuv , fig. 13 , be the section of an isosceles prism ; pv a line passing through the vertex v perpendicularly on the middle of the base .
It is required to find the action of the prism on any point p in the line pv .
This action is equal to the action of the prism whose base is the triangle v'pu ( given by Prop. 2o ) , less the actions of the prisms whose bases , or sections , are the triangles v'vp , uvp , which are found by Cor. , Prop. o0 .
Scholium .
I considered here only an isosceles prism ; but the solution is just the same , if the section of the prism is any triangle whatever , as v'uv , fig. 14 , and the action on a point p , ( situated in the line uv produced ) is required .
For the attraction wanted will be the difference of attractions of the two prisms whose bases are the triangles v'up , v'vp , and these are given by Cor. 2 , Prop. 0o .
Suppose the base of the prism , whose attraction is required , to be the trapezium v'u43 , fig. 14 , the action of this on p , being the difference of the actions of the triangular prisms , whose bases are v'uv , 3av , is found by the case just now considered .
In this manner , might cases be multiplied without end ; but I think it is sufficiently plain , that by means of the preceding propositions and scholium , we may find the action of any prism whatever , on a point either within or without it . ? .
IV .
Of the Attraction of certain Solids not terminated by Planes .
The expressions , arrived at in the first section , are useful in finding the attraction , not only of such solids as are bounded by planes , but of a great variety of others ; viz. of such as have their sections in one direction continuous curves , whilst1 being cut in a different way , there results , from their intersection with a plane , a polygon , or rectangle , or some other right lined figure .
As no one , that I know of , has considered the actions of such bodies , I shall offer no.apology for giving a few exanmples .
Let uvv'u ' , fig. 15 , represent any regular polygon , whose plane is perpendicular to the line pm , and its centre in that line : moreover , let this polygon be variable in magnitude , and move parallel to itself in the direction pm , in such a manner , that the middle point r of each of its sides uv , may describe a given curve pr .
Prop. 24 , Let it be required to find the attraction of the solid thus generated by the polygon , when the curve pr is a circle , * and the attracted point at the vertex p of the solid .
The attraction of a regular polygon was found in Prop. and it will be adapted to our present purpose , by putting xe for at , and 2kx x for b6 , where k is the radius of the circle pr : and we have , for the attraction of the solid , A -=2nf .

The attractions of cylinders of finite length , in directions perpendicular to their axes , are to be found after the manner of this last proposition ; but there are not many cases in which they can be expressed by circular arcs and logarithms .

It is required to determine the action of this cylinder on a point at C. Put k for the radius of the circle , and let x be the distance from C of a chord parallel to ab .

Prop. 29 .

Cor. 2 .
Let r ' be infinite , then r= o , and the solid becomes an infinitely long circular cylinder ; and it is easy to see that the value of A is reduced to 2k7r , as we found before in a different manner .
The foregoing problems , which I have chosen from a great variety that occurred to me , are sufficient to show the use that may be made of the expressions given in the first section .
The attractions of certain infinitely long cylinders , which were derived , as corollaries , from some of the preceding propositions , present us with several curious relations ; with these I shall terminate the present division of my subject .
Let pout , fig. 18 , represent the base , or section , of a circular cylinder , infinitely extended both above and below the plane of the figure .
Let p be an attracted point in the circumference of the section .
Draw the diameter pu , and , at right angles to it , the diameter ot .
By Cor. 1 , Prop. 27 , the action of the whole cylinder on the point p is 2k7r ( k being the radius of the circular section ) ; the action of that half of the cylinder , whose base is the semicircle opto , is 2k ( Tr 1 ) ; the action of the other half of the cylinder , which is furthest from p , is 2k : therefore , i. The attraction of a sphere is to that of an infinite circular cylinder of the same diameter ( on a point at the surface of each ) as 3 to i , which is the ratio of the solidity of a sphere to that of its circumscribing cylinder .
2 .
The attraction of the whole infinite cylinder , on p , is to the attraction of that half which is furthest from that point , as the circumference of a circle is to its diameter .
S. Consequently , the attraction of the nearest half , is to that of the furthest half , as the difference between the circumference and diameter of a circle is to the diameter ; or nearly as 2 to 1 .
4 .
In the circle optu , fig. 18 , inscribe the parabola owpvt , whose equation is kx -= , so that its vertex may be at p , and its axis coincide with pu : this parabola will plainly cut the circle at the quadrantal points o and t ; and , I say , that the action , on the point p , of the infinitely long cylinder , whose base is the parabolic area owpvtco , is to the attraction of the furthest half of the infinite circular cylinder , exactly as 2 to i. For the latter action has been shown to be 2k ; and if in the expression , obtained in Cor. 2 , Prop. 27 , we make a and x both = k , it is reduced to A 4k .
5 .
In fig. i8 , draw fug perpendicular to pu at u ; and from p , through o and t , the lines pof , ptg .
The attraction , on the point p , of the infinitely long prism whose base is the triangle pfg , is equal to the attraction of the infinitely long circular cylinder .
For the action of the prism is 4x pu x arc .
fpu ( by Prop. o)= Sk x= 2k r ; and this has been already shown to be the attraction of the circular solid . ?
.V .
Of Solids of greatest Attraction .
The subject of this section has occupied the attention of Mr. PLAYFAIR , * in the same paper I have before noticed ; it had previously been treated of by SILVABELLE .
FRISI also , in the third volume of his works , gives a solution of the same problem as that which is first considered by Mr. PLAYFAIR , but his result is an erroneous one .
None of these writers have pursued the matter any further than what relates to the figure of a homogeneous solid of revolution .
My manner of treat* The problems which I investigate are similar to the first of Mr. PLAYFAIR'Swhere the equation of a curve is sought ; nor do I at all meddle with that other class of problems which.he treats of in the subsequent part of the paper..8el ing the subject connects it intimately with the preceding parts of this paper ; otherwise I should not have given the following problems a place here .
Prop. 31 .
Suppose that a given quantity of matter is to be formed into a right cylinder of the length 2d ; what must be the figure of its base , so that it shall attract , with the greatest force possible , a point in its surface , and in the middle with respect to its two ends ?
Let fig. 19 represent a section of the cylinder , at the attracted point p , parallel to its base .
It is plain enough , that , whatever is the nature of the curve pab , we may draw a line pb from p , which shall divide the area into two equal and similar portions pabp , pcbp .
Put the absciss pd == x , the ordinate ad = y : the mass of the cylinder is 4dfyx ; and , by Prop. 4 , its attraction on p is 4f arc ( tang .

iation , I ke of the point as being in the surface of the cylinder , yet there is nothing in the above method of investigation that supposes it to be in contact withe solid : if the e is to bi a^'a given distance between them , the nature of the curve will b ' the same .
7tor : i. If we make dinfinitely sall , there results ax(x + y/ , ) ' o for the equation of the curve bounding ' the pe i fn ogreatesta"ttraction ' ; and ' it is evident , that , by the revolution of this curve about its axis , will be generated the solid of greatest attraction , when it is sought for without any such coniditions or restrictions as hentered ito ti_he reding problem .
This exactly agrees with the conclsion arrived at by SIi VABELLE and Mr. PLAYFAIR .
Cor. 2 .
If , on the other hand , we make d infinitely great , :the equation is reduced to , y = axx , which is that of a circle whose diameter is a , the attracted point being in thecircu ference .
Therefore , of all iiinitely long clinders , having the areas of their bases , or transverse sections , equa , ; that which has a circlefor the circumfere af]thesaid base , shall exert the greatest action on a point at its surface .
Prop p32 .
Let a given quantity of matter be fashioned into such a solid as was treated of at the beginning of the last section ( in Propostions'oS4 , 2i 6 , Yviz , having its section perpendicular to the axis a regularpolygon .
The polygon being given in it is required to determine the nature of the curve pr , fig. 5 , : so that the solid may have the greatest possible action on a point at its vertex p. If we put x for the distance of the generating polygon from the vertex , and y for the perpendicular let fall from the centre of the polygon on one of its sides , the action of the solid is 2nfl arc ( tang .

--+ C= o , or x C2 ( x2+y " ) ( x2 + ( x+ 'y : ) V/ x ; + ( l+rO yj ( i+r)y &gt; )=o .
Let a be the value of x when y= o , then C ' = , , and the equation of the curve becomes a4xIX(+y2 ) { 2+ ( i + )y } == o. When the polygon is a circle , r= o , and the equation is reduced to a4 ' ( x + -'2)3 = o , the same as we found in Cor. i , Prop. 31 .

Lemma 2 .
To find the quantity of matter in a right prism , whose base is the triangle rmv , fig. i , and height d ; supposing the density at any ordinate ks to be f ( a , T ) .
Pp 287 The magnitude of the element of the prism is dTrT and the mass of this element is rd xf ( a , T ) TT ; whence the mass of the whole prism is raff ( a , T ) TT .
The mass of a prism whose height is a and base a regular polygon of n sides , formed of triangles having this law of density , is 2nrftf ( a , T ) TT and its fluxional coeQficient , with respect to T , is onr f ( a , T ) Tx a. Prop. 33 .
Let the last proposition be again proposed , but with this difference , that the solid , instead of being homogeneous , is to be formed of polygonal prismatic elements , having such a law of density as in the preceding lemmas .
By proceeding as before , we shall have for the equation of the curve pr , fig. 15 , 2nxr f(a , ,y)y ( z-~+ ?

When r= o , we have , as before , a4x= ( s + y)3 ; which shows that the result of Mr. PLAYFAIR extends to an infinity of cases besides that of homogeneity .
When , as in our last supposition , r o , and the mass is a solid of revolution , the function f ( a , T ) expressing the density , is a function of the perpendicular let fall from any particlei a the axis of the solid , and of the distance between the foot of that perpendicular and the attracted point .
s88 Scholium .
If the preceding lemmas , had been treated on the supposition that the density was variable along the line ks , fig. i , ( which is the same as making the density f(t ) , or more generally f ( a , T , t ) a function of a , T , and t ) their application to the problem we have been considering , would give an indefinite number of different equations , for the curve pr , fig. 15 , according to the nature of the assumed function f ( a , T , t ) : every one of which equations will , however , have this peculiarity , that if we make r o , it will become a4x 2 ( xa.y')3 .
Fur when r= o , t= o , and f ( a , T , t ) becomes a function of a and T only , and the case enters into Prop. 33 just now considered .
It may be worth while to see an example of this ; we should have had , in general , for the action of the polygonal prismatic element of the solid , by Prop. , .
_,.a f ( a , 7T , t ) / tB A=i +naflai+a 3 and the mass of the same element would h_ave been 2na ff( a , T , tC ) ti .
These must be integrated , with respect to t , from t oo to t= rT : which cannot be done till we assign a form for the function f ( a , T , t ) .
Let this be a2 + T2 + t2 , that is to say , let the density at any point q , in the triangle vrm , be as the square of its distance pq from the attracted point p. This will give Z.*6 a t , A=2a ffA-T= 2naf{ L ( rT+ a ( 1 + r ) --L Va+Tf T ; , and for the mass 28s s4f ( 4a-^+ T-'+ ) it= 2/ I ( airT+ rT+ rj ) tT If therefore we solve Prop. ge , on this supposition of density , we have for the equation of the curve pr , fig. 15 , when the solid has the greatest attraction , L ( ry / ' +(1 + y2 ) y ) x VS +7 +C ( xry + ry r3y3 ' Now , when r is infinitely small , we shall have , by neglecting all the higher powers thereof , L ( ry + Vx+ ( T + r)y ) = LV / x ' + 7I ; by substituting which our equation becomes : : +4C ( x2+ y ) , or ax'(x2+y2)3=o , as we showed a priori must necessarily happen .
I shall just remark here , that , as the results of Prop. 32 , are not altered by conceiving the density any function of a and T , such is also the case with respect to Problem 31 , if T there represent the distance of any particle from a plane passing through the attracted point and the axis of the cylinder .
This the reader may easily convince himself of .
The proposition just mentioned ( 31 ) is only a particular case of the following very general one .
Prop. 34 .
Let uvv'u ' , fig. i5 , be a rectangle , whose plane is perpendicular to the line pm , and its centre in that line .
Let this rectangle move parallel to itself , in the direction pm , and vary in such a manner , that the middle points r and r ' of its sides may continually touch two different curves , The quantity of matter in the solid so generated being given , and the nature of one of the curves as pr ' , to find what must be the other curve pr , so that the action of the solid , on a point at its vertex p , may be the greatest possible .
Put x for the absciss ptn , y ' and y for the ordinates mr ' , mr ; then by Prop. 4 , the action of the solid will be 4fx arc ( tang .
= -- , == ) ; and its mass is 4fyy'x .
But y ' is a given function of x , suppose f ( x ) .
The quantity if ( x ) Arc ( tang .
= -x^++-)f( + Cyf ( x ) is therefore to have its fluxion , with respect toy , made = o : and this gives , for the equation of the curve pr , +Y5-. .
-+ C= o , or x C2 ( X'+y2 ) ( 2+y'+ f ( x4-)v+y ) Va+y .
' +t(x ) ( l)2 ( X ) ) ==0 .
Ex. 1 .
Let f ( x ) = ax , or pr ' be a straight line , the equation of pr must be x C2(Z2+y){ ( 1+ a ' ) x'+y } = o. Ex. 2 .
Let pr ' be a circle , or f ( x)2 =2kx x , k being the radius , then xsC2 ( x2 +ya)2 ( 2kx +y2 ) o , is the equation of the other curve .
Ex. 3 .
If pr ' is a parabola , or f ( .r)2 = ax , the equation of pr is x C2 ( x +-y ) ' ( ax + xi + y ) = o. Scholium .
In Prop. 27 , after having found the action of the solid there treated of , we derived , as corollaries , the action of parabolic and circuiar cylinders of infinite length , by separately making infilite the diameter of the circle and the parameter of the parabola .
Perhaps it might therefore be supposed , that if we made k infinite in the second of the preceding examples , or a 291 infinite in the third , the result would be the equation of the base of the infinitely long cylinder of greatest attraction ; which however is by no means the case ; for that was found to be a circle , whereas the equation we get here is x -C ' ( Xe-+ ) -o , and if we make a infinitely great in the first example , the equation becomes C'= x'-+y , or the line pr is a circle with its centre at the attracted point .
We might resolve this problem , on a variety of hypotheses respecting the density ; or we might add other conditions of a different kind ; for instance , not only the mass of the solid , but the area of the section , passing through the required curve pr and axis pm , might be supposed constant .
But I pass on to other suppositions respecting the force of attraction ; which will be treated with as much brevity as possible .
Lemma 3 .
To find the attraction of the triangle vrm , fig. i , on the point p , in the direction pm , supposing the force to be inversely as the mth power of the distance .
Keeping the same notation as in Prop. i , we have , for the attraction of an element at q , t m ; which being re(a%+T +rt ) i solved , gives , for the force of the whole triangle , in the direction aT* The further integration , with respect to T , is not necessary for our purpose .
Cor. i. If we multiply this by 2n , it will be the attraction of a regular polygon of n sides ; and making n i-finitely great and r infinitely small , the attraction of a circle to the radius T is found to be A 2nraTTl -2znra 2nra A-= = ( a '+T)2(m-i ) ( aI +T ' ) ( Z-I ) ) which , by putting vr for nr , is t(mA ) a ( m I ) ( ml )+ T ) the same as is found differently by other writers .

If instead of the action of the triangle vrm , that of a rectangle , whose sides are rm ( y ) and rv ( y ' ) , had been required , we must have proceeded exactly in the same manner , but the fluent , with respect to t , must have been taken from t= o , to t =y ' ; so that we have only to substitute y for rT , in the value found by the lemmia , and there results A =-Z~ , ~ { 1~(2 1 ' j - ; + ( 2-m ) ( a + T ) ( a+T + +y'2 L( ( 4--m)r-~ &amp;c.

If m is among the odd nulubers i , , , &amp;c. mi will be a whole positive number ; and we have for the action of the triangle , or rectangle ( accordingly as the fluent , with respect to t , is taken from t= o , to t rT , or from t o , to t =y ' ) provided mn is greater than 3 , Irt m---2 A -=faT ( r _i)(- ) x+t _ .

When m= i , or 3 , the above expression will not give the attraction ; but we evidently have , in the case of m = , A=fV Ta2 +x arc ( tang .

This lemma has been treated on the supposition that the density is the same at every part of the triangle rmv , fig. i ; but there are other hypotheses which render the solution easier : for instance , we may conceive the density of a particle at q to be as its distance ( t ) from the line rm , in which case A = .

From this simple case , we may not only arrive at some curious results , connected with the particular hypothesis of density , but may find with equal ease the figure of a homoge- .
neous solid of revolution of greatest attraction , as will just now be seen .
If the density was to be a fiunction of a and T only , it would be suffcient to nultiply the values found in the lemma , by that function , see le ; mma 1 .
Prop. 35 .
Let Prop. 31 be again proposed , but with this difference , that the force is inversely as the mth power of the distance , and that the density of any particle of the cylinder is as its distance ( t ) from that middle section ( parallel to the ends of the cylinder ) which passes through the attracted point .
In the expression we just now found , in the preceding scho .
lium , put x for a , and ( half the length of the cylinder ) for t. The action of the cylinder is A 4_ ff _-x..x.l _.(m1 ) ( x2+'-t2-d2)m(m-1 ) ( xz+ ) T -t 22 its quantity of matter is 4JfffTtt = [ fxTJi ; so that we have , for the equation of the curve bounding the base,.-. .

Let a be the value of x when y= o , then C ' 4 ; and the equation of the curve , bounding the plane of greatest attraction , amx = ( z '+ y)which is exactly the same result as that obtained by Mr. PLAYFAIRs p. 203 , on the supposition of homogeneity ; and this was to be expected ; for , though a certain condition of the density of the cylin:der entered into the foregoing problem , yet when d vansanises and th solid becomes a plane , we must evidently obtain the same result as if it had been arrived at by supposing ' the cyiinder homogeneous ; which in fact it will be when the length is evanescent .
Nor is this observation to be confined to that particular case when the density is as t : if we had solved the problem on the supposition of any function of x , T , and t , for the density , it is easy to see that though different functions will give different results when d is finite , yet when the solid becomes a plane , and d= o , the equation will always be reduced to atx ( x + y ) ' .
Hence we may conclude , that , the solid of revolution which shall exercise the greatest atraction on a point in its axis , whez theforce is inversely as the mth power of the distance , and the density either uniform , or any function whatever of x and T ( T being the perpendicular letfall from any particle to the axis of the solid , and x the distance between the foot of that perpendicular and the attracted point ) will have , for the equation of its generating cuve , amx:=( , + lt 2 am { x( +y'Ys\ Cor. 2 .

If m= 3 , we have ax -= x ' + y ' , the equation of a circle with the attracted point in its circumference .
If m -= 4 , the equation is atx = ( x +.y ) .
, which is Mr. PLAYFAIRS curve of equal attraction .
If we want the figure of the infinite cylinder of greatest attraction , when m= i , we must have recourse to the last corollary ; where we found xL ( x + y+ d ) xL ( x +y ) = C. This , when d is infinite gives xL .

Let Prop. 3$ be yet once more resolved , on the supposition that the force is inversely as the mth power of the distance ; and the density , in the triangles forming the generating polygon , either uniform , or as any function of x and T. If we make use of the first value of A in lemma 3 , we get , for the equation of the curve touching the sides of the polygon , ( x2-y2 ) ( x^2 ( 1 y)2 ) 3-(v+y ) ^+ r ) y 3r45 ( _ &amp;c. +C o.

And because the equation of the curve generating the solid of revolution of greatest attraction ( on the same hypotheses of force and den , sity ) has been shown to be r , -+ C= o , we have the following remarkable Theorem .
m being any whole positive number , and the density either uniform or as any function of x and T , the same curve which , by revolving , generates the solid of revolution of greatest attractionz when the force is inversely as the mth power , shall be the base of the izfinitely long cylinder of greatest attraction , when the force is inversely as the ( m + ith ) power .
Numberless other interesting questions might be proposed , relating to solids of greatest attraction ; for instance , we may inquire what must be the curve bounding the base of a cylinder of given mass and length so that it shall exercise the greatest action in a direction parallel to its axis .
But as this kind of inquiry proceeds exactly in the same way as the other ( only we must use the attraction B , instead of A , in Prop. it ) , it is unnecessary to lengthen a paper which has already been extended too far .

Of the Attraction of an infinitely long Prism , whose Base is any right lined Figure whatever .
Prop. A. Let the rectangle bb ' c'c , fig. 0o , be the section or base of a prism , infinitely extended on both sides of it , and let the line psu bisect the opposite sides bb ' , cc ' of the rectangle .
It is required to find the attraction of the infinitely long solid , on the point p , in the direction psu .
Let C be the centre of the rectangle , put k= sC , a= bs , u= pC ; draw rm perpendicular to sCu , and put x= Cm .

} Cor. If the position of the attracting solid be reversed , as in fig. 22 , call ps , u , and the attraction will be given by the same formula ; only the fluent ( if it begin at the point ) must now be taken from o tox , instead of from o to x. A being a function of r , x , and u , may be represented by 9q ( r , x , u ) .
To correct the fluent , let sm ( fig. 23 ) = X , sm'-x , then , the attraction of the solid , whose base is the quadrilateral figure prr'p ' , will be o(p ( r , x , u ) ( p ( r X , u ) .
In figure 24 , call ps , u ; sm , X ; sm ' , x. The action of the solid , whose base is prrp ' , is expressed by 2 ( r , --x , u ) 2p ( r , -X , u ) .
In fig. 25 , put ps = , PS'= u , sm = 'm == x , tang .

Prop. C. Let fig. 26 represent the base or section of an infinitely long prism , and let this base be any right lined figure whatever , regular or irregular : from p , a point in the same plane , draw any line pq , cutting the base at s and m " ' .
It is required to find the action of the solid on the point p , in the direction pq .
From the angles r , r ' , r " , r " ' , &amp;c. of the base , let fall the perpendiculars rm , r 'm ' , r"m " , r" 'm ' " , &amp;c. on the line pq .
Prolong the sides of the polygon till they meet pq at the points s , s ' , s " , s " ' , &amp;c. Put u= ps , u ' = ps ' , ul = ps " , u " == ps " ' , &amp;c. ; and x -sm , XI ' s ' m J ' X " s"m I X11 = s" 'm " &amp;c. Also , let r= tang .
rsm , r'= tang .
r 's 'm ' , r " ' = tang .
r"s"m " r"'= tang .
r"'s'"m " ' , &amp;c. then it appears from the last proposition , that the attraction , of the upper half of the solid , is expressed by ( r , ,u )-x ( r , , u)+ p(r ' x ' , u')-p(r ' , X , u ' ) + ( p r " , x " Z/ )u ( r " , X " , u)+ &amp;c. &amp;c. And in the same manner is found the attraction of the lower portion .
If any part of the polygon , as pp ' , is parallel to pq , the attraction of that portion of the solid may be found by Prop. A. Scholium to Prop. 25 , page 273 .
The following expression includes the attraction ( on a point at the pole or vertex ) of all this class of solids , where the generating plane is a regular polygon , and guiding curve a conic section : or where y ' =a ( T3x + eyx ) .

If the variable rectangle is given in species , and the touching curves are conic sections ; that is , if y'= _ ( X + ' ) , y == ' ( Ax + yx ) , we shall have , for the action of the generated solid , on a point at its vertex by Prop. 4 , A= 4fS arc ( tang .

This is the action of an infinitely long cylznder on a point at the vertex of its transverse section , the equation of the said section being y2 = a " ( Ax +y x ) .
Ex. If the base , or transverse section , is an ellipsis , or if y-= 7 ( ax-x2 ) , we have , 9= - , / 3 = a , ry = i ; and A =4 ( x + ab^ ) arc ( tang .

When x= a , this expression is reduced to 2ab A -a+b Scholium to Cor. 2 , Prop. 30 , page a81 .
If we would have a general expression for the attraction of such solids as the one we considered in the proposition , when the guiding curve is any conic section , or when y ' = a* ( 3x + 7 ' ) , there arises at first ( from the formula for the action of a rhombus ) A= 4fr arc ( tang .
