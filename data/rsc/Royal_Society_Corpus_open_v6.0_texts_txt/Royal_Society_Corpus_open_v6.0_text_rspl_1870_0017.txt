were found to be almost identical , the most marked of the few differences being that the blood-red colour given with nitric acid is much more permanent than in the similar apomorphia reaction .
Between the two bases also a very marked difference exists in respect of stability , apocodeia being far superior in this respect to apomorphia ; in fact it may be precipitated by ammonia or carbonate of sodium , washed and dried , without undergoing a marked change of colour .
The hydrochlorates also differ ; for that of apomorphia can be easily crystallized , whereas hydrochlorate of apocodeia has only been obtained in an amorphous state .
The preparation of apocodeia is easy and sure , yielding a very large product .
In this respect it differs materially from apomorphia , the preparation of which is tedious , and the amount of yield very uncertain , hence the high price of this valuable therapeutical agent .
The solutions of the two hydrochlorates also show the same differences that the bases themselves do .
In physiological effects also there is a decided difference between the hydrochlorates , that of apomorphia being , as observed by Dr. Gee , a very violent emetic , whilst that of apocodeia is , according to Dr. Legg 's experiments , a mild emetic ; it also produces subcutaneous abscesses at the place of injection , which the apomorphia salt does not .
It has been shown in Part II .
( Proc. Roy .
Soc. vol. xvii .
p. 460 ) of these researches , that when codeia is heated with hydrochloric acid it splits up into chloride of methyl , water , and apomorphia .
The action of hydriodic acid on narcotine for the elimination of the methyl contained in it is , however , more energetic than that of hydrochloric acid .
Therefore it was thought probable that , by means of hydriodic acid , CH2 might be abstracted alone , as iodide of methyl , from the codeia , leaving the elements of water , and thus forming morphia .
On trying the experiment , however , not a trace of iodide of methyl was obtained , but the iodide of a new base , which is at present under examination .
The codeia with which the foregoing experiments were made was kindly presented to us by Messrs. McFarlan and Co. , of Edinburgh , to whose liberality we are already so much indebted .
" Experiments on the Action of Red Bordeaux Wine ( Claret ) on the Human Body .
" By E. A. Parks , M.D. , F.R.S. , Professor of Hygiene in the Army Medical School , and Count Cyprian Wollowicz , M.D. , Assistant Surgeon , Army Medical Staff .
Received July 5 , 1870 .
In the Proceedings of the Royal Society ( No. 120 ) is an account of some experiments with pure alcohol and brandy on a healthy man .
This paper is intended as a continuation , with the substitution in the experiments of red Bordeaux wine ( claret ) for alcohol and brandy .
The same 74 Messrs. Parks and Wollowicz on the [ Recess , man was the subject of the experiments , and he was placed on precisely the same diet as is recorded in the former paper .
The experiments were continued for 30 days , the man having abstained from any alcoholic beverage for 16 days previously .
During the first 10 days , water only was taken at dinner , during the next 10 days red Bordeaux wine was substituted for the water ; 10 fluid ounces ( 284 cub. centims. ) being given on the first 5 days , and 20 fluid ounces ( 568 cub. centims. ) on the last 5 days .
The wine was taken at dinner time , at a quarter past 1 o'clock .
In the last 10 days water was again given .
The wine was a good claret , as it was thought best to use a superior wine ; it was Haut Brion wine of second growth , of the vintage of 1863 , and was sold in London at the price of 60-s .
per dozen .
It contained 11 per cent , of alcohol .
The free acidity was equal to about 3 grains per ounce of tartaric acid ( C4H606 ) ; the total solids amounted to 21*76 grammes , and the fire-proof salts to 2*359 grammes per litre .
Of this amount of salts 2*027 grammes were soluble , and *332 insoluble .
In the former , phosphoric acid and chlorine were present in the amounts of *145 and *106 gramme per litre respectively ; the insoluble salts contained only *0175 gramme of phosphoric acid per litre .
In the 10 ounces of wine there were therefore only 0*7 grain of phosphoric acid , and 0*46 grain of chlorine .
The ash was intensely alkaline , and , when neutralized with standard acid , the alkalinity was found to be equal to 1*679 gramme of tartaric acid ( C4 H6 Oe ) per litre .
Only two circumstances ( except the taking of wine ) were different in this set of experiments as compared with the former .
The first experiments were made in February and March 1870 , when the weather was very cold ; the present were made in May and June in very hot and dry weather .
The only influence we could trace to this altered condition of climate was that the amount of water allowed was insufficient , and the man suffered some discomfort from thirst .
We could not perceive that any effect was produced on the nitrogenous elimination ; certainly there was no diminution .
The other alteration was that the man had gained 4 lbs. in weight , and was still gaining a little when the experiments were commenced ; he continued to do so slowly until the 24th day , when his health began to give way and he lost weight .
The experiments included the number of the pulse ( taken in the recumbent position ) every 2 hours from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. , tracings of the pulse and respirations , the temperature of the axilla every 2 hours from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. , the temperature of the rectum four times a day ( the observations being taken with the same thermometers as on the former occasion ) , the amounts of nitrogen , phosphoric acid , chlorine and free acidity of the urine , and the weight , and in the two cases the amount of nitrogen in the stools .

If the last line ( the mean of the hours ) is read , and it is remembered that breakfast was taken at 8 , dinner at 1 , and tea at 5 , the increase in the number of beats at 10 , 2 , and 6 o'clock is at once accounted for .
It rose after breakfast nearly 7 beats ; then fell 4 beats ; rose after dinner nearly 10 beats ; then fell , but not to its previous standard ; rose after tea 3 beats , and then fell , till at 10 p.m. it was nearly the same as at 8 a.m. The 76 Messrs. Parks and Wollowicz on the [ Recess , other cause influencing the heart 's beats was exercise ; we kept the exercise as uniform as we could , but there were variations , and we could often trace defect or excess of exercise on the next reading of the pulse .
The daily mean of the pulse was fairly uniform , the mean of the 10 days being 76*3 beats per minute , the extreme mean daily variation was from 74*2 to 77*87 .

In the 24 hours there was then an excess in the heart 's action of 6120 beats , or nearly 6 per cent. As the amount of alcohol was 1*1 ounces in the first 5 days , and 2'2 ounces in the other 5 , the increase in the number of the heart 's beats was slightly more than in the days when an equal quantity of pure alcohol was taken .
This was partly owing to the continuance of the wine , as the first day 's excess was only 1658 beats , and partly to the fact that whereas in the former series of experiments the mean pulse-beats in the water period were 73* , in this they were 76'3 .
The man 's heart was evidently rather more excitable in this series than in the former .
When the hourly changes are compared with the water period , it is seen that the influence of food is marked as before , but that the wine exaggerated the effect , and kept the pulse at a greater rate for a longer time .
An extract from the Tables will show this .
It must be noted that the wine was taken at 1 o'clock , or a little after .

It will be seen , then , that the pulse at 4,6 , and 8 o'clock in the wine period is much above the corresponding numbers in the water period .
The effect of the wine is largely perceptible for eight hours , and is traceable during all the observations .
The mean of the first five days is 80*34 beats per minute , and of the last five days 80*78 beats .
The effect of increasing the wine to 20 ounces is chiefly perceived in the greater acceleration of the pulse at 4 o'clock in the last five days as compared with the first five .
When 10 ounces were taken , the mean pulse at 4 o'clock was 84*2 , or two beats per minute less than at 2 o'clock , whereas in the 20-ounce days the mean pulse at 4 o'clock was four beats above the 2 o'clock rate .

Sphygmographic observations were taken three times a day ; but as the curves from alcohol were so fully given in the former paper , we have thought it necessary only to put in nine curves , three before , four during , and two after wine .
We have selected 3 o'clock as the hour , so that the influence of food is perceptible in all : the effect of the wine was the same as that of alcohol , though of course in a degree proportional to the amount .
We also attempted to determine the ratio of the radial pulse , heart 's action , and respiration by means of Dr. Burdon-Sanderson 's ingenious cardiograph .
Unfortunately we did not obtain the instrument in time to determine the curves properly in the period before wine , and we are therefore not able to give proper comparisons .
We could not , however , so far trace any effect on the number or depth of the respirations .

The only exception ( and this is perhaps apparent only ) is at 8 p.m. , when the mean temperature is higher than at 6 p.m. while the pulse is falling ; but this was perhaps accidental , i. e. a longer eeries of observations might have given different results ; for in three observations the temperature was higher at 6 o'clock , and in three it was equal , while in the other four , when it was highest at 8 o'clock , there were two exceptional high temperatures which augmented the mean amount .
In the next period the mean temperature at 8 p.m. was lower than at 6 .
We were unable to see any diurnal change of temperature in this man apart from food ; there was no afternoon or evening rise of temperature , dependent solely on the time of day .
The temperature was more uniform than in the experiments in February , Second Period .

In the other 5 hours the mean temperature was four times slightly higher in the water , and once in the wine period .
The result of all the observations was that , in the water period of ten days , the mean temperature was 970,726 , and in the wine period was 97''56 , or 0o,166 less , a difference so slight as probably to fall within the limits of unavoidable error .
The mean of the first five days , with 10 ounces of wine , was 97'*526 ; the mean of the last five days , with 20 ounces of wine , was 97 ' ' 590 , proving that doubling the amount of wine caused no lowering of mean temperature , and probably no rise , as the difference is so slight .
We conclude that in health the apparent heat after wine must be owing , as in the case of alcohol and brandy , rather to subjective feelings connected with the quickened circulation than with an actual rise of temperature ; but that , on the other hand , wine in the above quantities causes no appreciable lowering of temperature .

It was also more uniform , both from day to day and hour to hour .
If these four hours be accepted as giving the mean temperature of the 24 hours , the rectum temperature was l'-654 above that in the axilla .

It is curious that this is almost precisely the same change as in the case of the axillary temperature ; yet it is probably an accidental coincidence .
The 4 p.m. temperature , which ought to show the effect of wine , is slightly higher ( 0o-09 ) than in the first period ; the 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. temperatures are lower by nearly 0'*3 , and the 12 o'clock temperature is higher by 0'*1 .
The differences are thus slight , and in contrary directions , so that no decided influence , one way or the other , can , we think , be ascribed to the wine .

Action on the Urine .
Elimination of water by the kidneys .
Twenty-eight fluid ounces were taken as drink , and the water in the so-called solid food made the total daily ingress of water 72| fluid ounces , or 2059 cub. centims. The following are the means of the three periods:\#151 ; 1st period ( water ) 2nd period ( wine ) 3rd period ( water ) Amount of water taken daily in solid food and as drink .

As 49 cub. centims. less water were taken in the wine-period , the amount of urine ought perhaps to be increased by this amount , and this would make it only 13 cub. centims. less than the first period , It may be concluded that 10 and 20 ounces of light wine ( containing 1*1 and 2*2 ounces of alcohol ) , when substituted for water , had no diuretic effect .
The amount of alcohol to act as a diuretic was perhaps too small , as in the former series with the larger quantities of alcohol there was certainly some increased flow of urinary water .
Elimination of nitrogen by the kidneys .
The same amount of food being given as in the previous experiments , the amount of nitrogen passing into the body was 17^ or J7^ grammes , or probably a little more .
The whole of this passed by the urine and bowels , so that in this respect the difference in the temperature of the air had no effect .
In other words , although the weather was so hot , there was no evidence of urea escaping by the skin .

The difference is so slight ( under 6 grains in 24 hours ) that the two series may be considered identical .
Possibly as the man was 4 lbs. heavier , there might be some additional nitrogenous tissue furnishing the slight excess of nitrogen .

Parks and Wollowicz on the [ Recess , insignificant , as to prove that 10 and 20 fluid ounces of claret , taken for two periods of five days , caused no alteration in the elimination of nitrogen , when the egress of nitrogen was constant .
Thus to express the result in grains , the daily nitrogen calculated from the urea was , in the first period of ten days , 257*37 grains , and in the second or wine-period 260 grains .
In nine days of the two periods , the daily nitrogen by soda-lime was 255*19 grains in the water- , and 253*35 grains in the wine-period .

If this be done , the mean daily excretion of nitrogen was 18*362 grammes .
This gives an excess of no less than 1'682 gramme over the first period , and 1-504 over the wine-period .
The excess was so large , and was so unlike anything seen before during any of the experiments , as to prove it was not accidental .
The question now arises , if the increase was owing to the direct effect of the wine .
This seems unlikely , partly because some evidence of increase would then have been obtained from the ten days during which the wine was taken , and partly from another reason .
During this last period the man became ill ; he was not feverish , but his pulse was quick .
On the 25th , 26th , and 27th days there was some looseness of the bowels and headache ; he could scarcely eat his food , and lost weight for the first time .
On the 29th day he was better , and on the 30th felt quite well , and on that day the nitrogen ( as determined in both ways ) fell greatly .
He ascribed his illness to the monotony of his life , the sameness of his diet , and the comparative want of exercise , whilst it is also possible that the 1870 .
] Action of Claret on the Human Body .
wine , to which he was unaccustomed , and the small allowance of water , may have had some effect in deranging his nutrition .
It seems , however , fair to conclude that the wine had only an indirect share , if any , in causing this illness and increased elimination , which was manifestly caused by some peculiar morbid state of nutrition .
It is noticeable in this case that there was increased elimination of nitrogen ( evidently in the form of urea ) , without any increase in the mean temperature of the body .
There was , however , an increase in the temperature at 2 , 4 , and 6 o'clock , when digestion was most active .
The gradual loss of weight of the body was very striking .

The effect on the chlorine is uncertain , as that ingredient has such a wide range of variation .
It is , however , interesting to note that the mean daily excretion of the whole thirty days is almost precisely the same as the mean daily excretion of the twenty-five days in the previous series ( viz. 7 028 grammes as against 6 915 grammes ) , and this proves the equality of the diet .
The acidity of the urine was increased during the wine-period , and this continued afterwards .
It may be observed that the mean free acidity of the former experiments was almost precisely the same as in these experiments during the water-period ( viz. 1'974 as against 1*955 gramme ) , and was very nearly the same in the alcoholic as in the wine-period ( viz. 2*342 as against 2*221 ) .
It seems fair to conclude that the free acidity was really increased , and that the increase continued subsequently .

Looking to the mean weight of all the stools , to the particular circumstances of the 10th day 's stool , and the very nearly equal percentage of nitrogen on the 10th and 19th days , it may be concluded that the wine did not affect the intestinal discharges either as regards quantity or nitrogen .
6 .
The Elimination of Alcohol .
As in the former series , the numerous experiments we had to perform prevented us from thoroughly investigating this difficult problem .
We tested the appearance of alcohol in the excreta by the bichromate-of-potas-sium test as before .
The general results were as follows :\#151 ; Elimination by the breath .
In the first period the bichromate test was not tried on the first day ; it was very slightly changed in colour on the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th days , when the breath was blown through the test for 15 minutes about 2 o'clock .
On the remaining 5th , 6th , 7th , 8th , 9th , and 10th days , no change was produced .
On the 1st day of wine after dinner , the colour became green in eight minutes , on the 2nd day in six minutes , and subsequently a little sooner .
On the 16th and subsequent days ( when the wine was doubled ) the change was much greater .
In the evening , except in one or two cases , no change was produced .
On the 21st day ( 1st day after wine ) and subsequent days there was no alteration .
The breath was condensed by a freezing-mixture on the 9th day about 4 o'clock ; about \ cub. centim. was collected ; it was tested for alcohol by the Iodoform test , but none was found ; it was unfortunately not examined by the bichromate test .
On the 20th day ( 20 ounces of wine ) the breath was again condensed ; it gave an immediate marked green reaction with the bichromate test .
On the 22nd day ( the 2nd after the wine ) it was again condensed , and gave still an immediate reaction , though not so marked as on the 20th day ; so that two days after the wine was left off , some was passing off by the lungs , though it was not detected by merely breathing through the test .
On the 25th and 28th days , when the breath was again condensed , no effect was produced on the bichromate test .
Elimination by the skin .
In the former series of experiments , when the perspiration was obtained by putting the arm in an hermetically sealed glass jar , no effect was produced in the bichromate test by the sweat before alcohol had been taken .
But on this occasion , when 12 cub. centims. of perspiration were collected in four hours on the 5th day , the bichromate test was at once made green .
No alcohol was detected by the Iodoform test , but we are not certain if this can be relied upon .
This was on the l/ th May , and no alcoholic liquid had been taken since the 25 th April .
88 Messrs. Parks and Wollowicz on the [ Recess , It seemed improbable that alcohol , taken so long before , could be still passing off ; and if not , then the perspiration may at times contain some non-alcoholic substance capable of reducing the bichromate .
The perspiration of the arm was condensed on the 10th day ( before wine ) , on the 19th day ( during wine ) , and on the 26th , 28th , and 30th days ( after wine ) .
In all cases an extremely marked green reaction was at once given .
We conclude , therefore , that fresh experiments are necessary with regard to the correctness of the bichromate test , when applied to the condensed perspiration .
Elimination by the kidneys .
The examination was conducted in the same way as on the former occasion , the urine being first distilled , the distillate tested with the bichromate test , and if no reaction was given redistilled .
The following Table gives the results:\#151 ; Days .

1 ounce of absolute alcohol ) were taken , no alcohol passed into the urine .
On the 16th day , when 20 ounces ( ==2'2 ounces of absolute alcohol ) were taken , none was found in the urine ; the next day no examination was made , but on the 18 th day alcohol was detected , and two days later the reaction was marked .
Two days after the wine was left off no alcohol was found .
Therefore , when this man took 2 ounces of absolute alcohol day after day , some of it was eliminated by the urine .
When he took only 1 ounce , none was eliminated during the space of five days .
If , as has been surmised by Dr. Anstie , the appearance of alcohol in the urine indicates that there is an excess in the body , it seems clear that this man cannot take much more than 1 ounce without the urine giving evidence of it , and thereby proving excess .
It soon disappeared from the urine , certainly on the 2nd day ( the first day 's urine was not examined ) , whereas , on the former occasion , when a much larger quantity had been taken , it could be detected five days after it had been discontinued .
* Tested also with the Iodoform test .

General Conclusions .
1 .
The general results of these experiments are in all respects identical with the experiments on alcohol and brandy , that is to say , there was a marked effect on the heart , coinciding tolerably well in amount with the effect produced by pure alcohol in the former experiments ; there was no unequivocal alteration of temperature in the axilla or rectum , no alteration in the elimination of nitrogen , for the increase in the last period cannot be credited to the direct effect of the wine ; no alteration in the phosphoric acid of the urine ; some augmentation of the free acidity of the urine ; no alteration of the alvine discharges .
In other words , claret-wine in the above quantities cannot so far be distinguished in its effect from pure alcohol .
Its most marked effect , the increase of the heart 's action , must be ascribed to the alcohol , in great measure , though the ethers may play some slight part .
But it would be going too far to assert that the dietetic effects of red Bordeaux wine and of dilute alcohol are identical .
The difference between them must probably be sought in their effects on primary digestion and assimilation , delicate and subtle influences which experiments like those recorded in the paper do not touch .
The influence of the sugar , of the salts , and of the acidity must also be appreciated by other methods .
The man himself affirmed that the wine agreed with him better than the alcohol or brandy , but the large quantity he took of these last fluids vitiates the comparison .
r\gt ; These experiments on wine enabled us to define somewhat better than the previous trials what might be considered moderation for this man .
The 10 ounces of wine , containing about 1 fluid ounce of pure alcohol , did not cause the least unpleasant feeling of heat or flushing .
The 20 ounces ( containing almost 2 fluid ounces of alcohol ) were manifestly too much .
He felt hot and uncomfortable , was flushed , the face was somewhat congested , and he was a little drowsy .
Moreover , as already mentioned , alcohol then began to appear in the urine .
Therefore he ought certainly not to take much more than 1 fluid ounce of absolute alcohol in 24 hours .
\#166 ; With regard to the propriety of this healthy man taking any alcohol , we have no hesitation in saying he would be better without it .
His heart naturally acts quickly and strongly enough ; alcohol increases its action too much , and might lead on to alteration in its condition , or to injury of vessels , if any degeneration were to take place in them .
This man had gone through the Abyssinian campaign , and stated that when the force was without rum , owing to deficiency of transport beyond Antalo , he had in no way felt the want of the stimulant , though some of his comrades did .
This seems to confirm our opinion , that alcohol for him is not a necessity , and indeed is not desirable .
