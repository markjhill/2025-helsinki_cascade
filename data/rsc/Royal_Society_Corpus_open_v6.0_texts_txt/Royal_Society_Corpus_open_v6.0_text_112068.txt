" On the Physical Constitution and Rlelations of Musical Chords .
" By ALEXANDER J. EELLIs , F.R.S. , F.C.P.S.* Received June 8 , 1864 .
When the motion of the particles of air follows the law of oscillation of a simple pendulum , the resulting sound may be called a simple tone .
The pitch of a simple tone is taken to be the number of double vibratiouls which the particles of air perform in one second .
The greatest elongation of a particle from its position of rest may be termed the extent of the tone .
The intensity or loudness is assumed to vary as the square of the extent .
The tone heard when a tuning-fork is held before a proper resonance-box is simple .
The tone of wide covered organ-pipes and of flutes is nearly simple .
Professor G. S. Ohm has shown mathematically that all musical tones whatever may be considered as the algebraical sum of a number of simple tones of different intensities , having their pitches in the proportioni of the numerical series 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , &amp;c. Professor Helmholtz has established that this mathematical composition corresponds to a fact in nature , that the ear can be taught to hear each one of these simple tones separately , and that the character or quality of the tone depends on the law of the intensity of the coinstituent simple tonles .
These conistituent simple tonies will here be termied indifereiutly parti Il The Table belonjing to tfhis Paper will be found after p. 422 , tones or harmonics , and the result of their combination a compoutnd tone .
By the pitch of a compound tone will be meant the pitch of the lowest partial tone or.primary .
When two simple tones which are not of the same pitch are sounided together , they will alternately reinforce and enfeeble each other 's effect , producing a libration of sound , termed a beat .
The number of these beats in one second will necessarily be the difference of the pitches of the two simple tones , which may be termed the beat number .
As for some time the two sets of vibrations concur , and for some time they are nearly opposite , the compound extent will be for some time nearly the sum , and for some time nearly the difference of the two simple extents , and the intensity of the beat may be measured by the ratio of the greater intensity to the less .
But the beat will not be audible unless the ratio of the greater to the smaller pitch is less than 6 : 5 , according to Professor Eelmholtz .
This is a convenient limit to fix , but it is probably not quite exact .
To try the experiment , I have had two sliding pipes , each stopped at the end , and having each a continuous range of an octave , connected to one mouthpiece .
The tones are niearly simple ; and when the ratio approaches to 6 5 , or the interval of a minor third , the beats become faint , finally vanish , and do not reappear .
But the exact moment of their disappearance is difficult to fix , and indeed seems to vary , probably with the condition of the ear .
The ear appears to be most sensitive to the beats when the ratio is about 16 : 15 .
After this the beats again diminish in sharpness ; and when the ratio is very near to unity , the ear is apt to overlook them altogether .
The effect is almost that of a broken line of sound , as the spaces representing the silences .
Slow beats are not disagreeable ; for example , when they do not exceed 3 or 4 in a second .
At 8 or 10 they become harsh ; from 15 to 40 they thoroughly destroy the continuity of tone , and are discordant .
After 40 they become less annoying .
Professor Helmholtz thinks 33 the beat number of maximum disagreeableness .
As the beats become very rapid , from 60 to 80 or 100 in a second , they become almost insensible .
Professor Helmholtz considers 132 as the limiting number of beats which can be heard .
They are certainly still to be distinguished even at that rate , but become more and more like a scream .
Thoughf8 and q8 should give 198 beats in a second if c=264 , and the interval is that for which the ear is most sensitive , I can detect no beats when these tones are played on two flageolet-fifes .
Hence beats from 10 to 70 may be considered as discordant , and as the source of all discord in music .
Beyond these limits they produce a certain amount of harshness , but are not properly discordant .
Wheni the extent of the tones is not infinitesimal , Professor lelmholtz has proved that on two simple tones being sounded together , many other tones will be generated .
The pitch of the principal and only one of these combinational tonies necessary to be considered , is the difference of the pitch of its generating tones .
It will therefore be termed the differential tone .
Its intensity is generally very small , but it becomes distinctly audible in beats .
The differential tone is frequenitly acuter than the lower generator , and hence the ordinary name " grave harmonic " is inapplicable .
As its pitch is the beat number of the combination , Dr. T. Young attributed its generation to the beats having become too rapid to be distinguished .
This theory is disproved , first , by the existence of differential tones for intervals which do not beat , and secorndly , by the simultaneous presence of distinct beats and differential tones , as I have frequently heard on sounding f4 , f , or even f2 , f 2 : together on the concertina , when the beats form a distinct rattle , and the differential tone is a peculiar penetrating but very deep hum .
The object of this paper is to applv these laws , partly physical and partly physiological , to explain the constitution and relations of musical chords .
It is a continuation of my former paper on a Perfect Musical Scale* , and the Tables are numbered accordingly .
Two simple tones which make a greater interval than 6 : 5 , and therefore never beat , will be termed disjunct .
Simple tones making a smaller interval , and therefore generally beating , will be termed pulsative .
The unreduced ratio of the pitch of the lower pulsative tone for which the beat number is 70 to that for which it is only 10 , will be termed the range of the beat .
The 'fraction by which the pitch of the lower pulsative tone must be multiplied to produce the beat number , will be termed the beat factor .
The ratio of the pitches of the pulsative tones , on which the sharpness of the dissonance depends , will be termed the beat interval .
A compound tone will be represented by the absolute pitch of its primary and the relative pitches of its partial tones , as C ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... .
) .
As generally only the relative pitch of two compound tones has to be considered , the pitches will be all reduced accordingly .
Thus , if the two primaries are as 2 : 3 , the two compound tones will be represented by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , ... .
, and 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 ... .
The intensity of the various partial tones differs so much in different cases , that any assumption which can be made respecting them is only approximative .
In a well-bowed violin we may assume the extent of the harmonics to vary inversely as the number of their order .
Hence , putting the extent and intensity of the primary each equal to 100 , we shall have , with sufficient accuracyHarmonics ... 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 .
Extent ... 100 , 50 , 33 , 25 , 20 , 17 , 14 , 12 , 11 , 10 .
Intensity ... 100 , 25 , 11 , 6 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 .
It will be assumed that this law holds for all combining compound tones , the intensity of the primary in each case being the same .
The results will be sufficient to explain the nature of chords on a quartett of bowed instruments , but may be much modified by varying the relative intensities of the combining tones .
On examining a single compound tone , we may separate its partial tones into two groups : the first disjunct , which will never beat with each other ; the second pulsative , which will beat with the neighbouring disjunct tones .
Thus Disjunct. .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , - , 8 , - , 10 , - , 12 , - , - , - , 16 , Pulsative .
, - , - , ,- , , 7 , - , 9 , - , 11 , , 13 , 14 , 15 , - , Disjunct. .
, , - , 20 , - , - , - , 24 , - , - , _ , - , -,30 .
Pulsative .
17 , 18 , 19 , - , 21 , 22 , 23 , - , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , - .
When any compound tone therefore developes any of the harmnoniics above the 6th , there may , and probably will , be beats , producing various degrees of harshness or shrillness , jarring or tinkling .
These , however , are all natural qualities of tone , that is , they are produced at once by the natural mode of vibration of the substances employed .
But if we were to take a series of simple tones having their pitches in the above ratios , and to vary their intensities at pleasure , we should produce a variety of artificial qualities of tone , some of which might be coincident with natural qualities , but most of which would be new .
This method of producing artificial qualities of tone is difficult to apply , but has been used with success by Professor Helmholtz to imitate vowel-sounds , &amp;c. If , however , instead of using so many simple tones , we combine a few compound tones , the pitches of which are such that their primaries might be harmonics of some other compound tone , then the two sets of partial tones will necessarily combine into a single set , which may , or rather must be considered by the ear as the partial tones of some new compound tone , having very different intensities from those possessed by the partial tones of either of the combining compound tones .
That is , an artificial quality of tone will have been created by the production of these joint harmonics .
Such an artificial quality of tone constitutes what is called a musical chord .
The two or more compound tones from which it is built up are its constituents .
The primary joint harmonic is the real root orfundamental bass of the chord , which often differs materially from the supposititious root assigned by musicians .
If the primaries of the constituents are disjulnct , and all their partial tones are disjunct , then the joint harmonics will be also disjunct , unless some pulsative differential tones have been introduced .
If , however , the constituents have pulsative partial tones , the chord will also have them .
Such chords , which are generally without beats , and are only exceptionally accompanied by beats , are termed concords , and they are tunisonant or dis.onant according as the beats are absent or present .
Their character therefore conrsists in having the pitches of their constituents as 1 , 3 , 5 , or as these numbers multiplied by various powers of 2 , that is , as 1 , 3 , 5 , or their octaves .
If any of the colnstituents is pulsative the chord will generally have beats , but may be exceptionally without beats .
Such chords are termed discords .
Their character consists in having two or more of the pitches of their constituents as 1 , 3 , 5 , or their octaves , and at least one of them as 7 , 9 , or some other pulsative tones , or their octaves .
What pulsative tones should be selected depends on the sharpness of the dissonance which it is intended to produce , and therefore on the initerval of the beat which is created .
Thus , since 7 : 6=1 16667anid8 : 7=1 14286 are both near the limit 6 : 51 2 , the discord arising from 7 would be slight .
Some writers have even considered the chord 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 to be concordant .
Again , 9:8=1e125 is rather rough , but 10 : 9=1 l111 is much rougher .
Hence , if 9 is introduced , 10 should be avoided , that is , the octave of 5 should be omitted , which generally necessitates the omission of 5 itself , as in the chord 1 , 3 , 9 .
But 11 : 10= 10 1 arid 12 : 11 =1 09091 are both so sharply dissornant , that if 11 is used neither 10 nor 12 should be employed .
Now 10 is the octave of 5 , and 12 is both the 3rd harmonic of 4 and the 4th harmonic of 3 , and would therefore be produced from 3 and 4 .
Hence the use of 1I would forbid the use of 3 , 4 , and 5 , that is , of the best disjunct tones .
Hence 11 cannot be employed at all .
Similarly , 13:12= 1-08333 and 14:13= 107692 are both extremely harsh .
The latter is of no consequence , because 7 can be easily omitted .
But even 15 : 13=1 15384 is more dissonant than 7 : 6 .
Hence 13 would also beat with the harmonics of 3 , 4 , and 5 .
Consequently 13 must be also excluded .
All combiniations in which the differential tones 11 and 13 are developed will also be extremely harsh .
As we therefore suppose that 14 : 13= 1-07692 never occurs , and as 14:12=7 : 6 , the mildest of the dissonances , 14 may be used if 15 is absent , and thus 1a : 14= 107143 avoided .
When 14 and 15 are developed as harmonics of 7 and.5 , and not as the primaries of constituent tones , their intensity will be so much diminished that the discord will not generally be too harsh .
When 15 is .
used as a constituent , 14 and 16 should be avoided ; that is , 7 , and 1 , 2 and 4 , of which 14 and 16 are upper harmonics , should be omitted to avoid 15:14 = 1-07143 and 16:15 =1 06667 , which may be esteemed the maximum dissonance .
By omitting 16 and 18 , and thus avoiding 17 : 16V10625 and 18 : 17= 1O05882 ( that is , by not using 4 , 8 , or 9 as constituent tones ) , 17 becomes useful ; for 17:15=1*13333 is milder than 9 : 8=1 125 , which is by no means too rough for occasional use .
The other pulsative harmonies , which are represented by prime numbers , are not sufficiently harmronious for use ; bhut those produced from 2 , 3 , 5 ( such as 25 , 27 , 45 ) may be sometinmes useful , provided that the tones with which they form sharp dissonances are omitted .
The resuilt of the above investigation is that the only pulsative tones suitable for constituent 's ae 7 , 9 , 15 , 1 7 , 25 , 27 , 45 , and their octaves The introduction of any one of these tones in conjunction with 1 , 3 , 5 and their octaves will therefore form a discord , the harshness of which may be frequently much diminished by the omission of 1 and its octaves for the constituents 7 , 15 , 17 , by the omission of 5 for the constituent 9 , and by the omission of 24 for the cornstituents 25 , 27 , 45 .
Using the notation of my former paper , where z=63 : 64 , and putting in addition vij=84 : 85 , xj=33 : 32 , xiij==39 : 40 , l 255 : 256 , and xvij = 135 : 136 , the tones 1 to 18 may be represented by the following notes in terms of C4- : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , C74 , C , G , c , e , g , gbb or vij at , c2 , d2 , e2 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , xjf , g2 , xiij a2 , g6f or vij a2t , 62 , c4 , 1 zd4 or xvij " c , 18 , 20 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 45 , d4 , e4 , g4 , tW4 ta4 , f4P .
This notation will show what are the musical names of the constituents of musical chords , and how they may be approximately produced on an organ , harmoniuim , or pianoforte .
By the type of a musical chord is meant the numbers which express the relative pitches of its constituents , after such octaves below them have been taken as to leave only uneven numbers , which are then called the elements of the type .
By the form of the ehord is mneant the numbers before such reduction .
Thus the type 1 , 3 , 5 embraces , among others , the forms 1 , 3 , 5 ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 ; 2 , 3 , 5 ; 4 , 3 , 5 ; 3 , 8 , 10 ; 6 , 10 , 16 ; 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and so on ; hence the types of musical chords consist of groups of the elements 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , lS , 17 , 25 , 27 , 45 .
The type of a concord is 1 , 3 , 5 , and of a discord 1 , 3 , 5 , P , or 1 , 3 , 5 , P , Pt , where P , P , are any of the numbers 7 , 9 , 15 , 17 , 25 , 27 , 45 .
Discords may be divided into strong and weak , according as those disjunict tones with which the pulsative tones principally beat are retained or omitted .
These discords again may be distinguished inito those which have one or two pulsative constituents .
The chords may also be grouped according to the number of elements in their type , dyads containing two , triads three , tetrads four , and pentads five .
The number of elements in the type by no means limits the numbers of colnstituents , as any octaves above any of the elements may be added .
Hence it is possible to classify all the suitable chords of music according to their type , as in Table VI .
, where the notes corresponding to each type are added in the typical form only .
A simple systematic nomenclature is proposed in an adjoining column , and the names by which the true chords or their substitutes are known to miusicians are added for reference .
Occasionally two forms of suLbstitution are given , as they are of theoretical importance , although confounded on some tempered instrumienits .
A inode of symbolizing the chords is subjoined , in which several types are classed under onie family .
A capital letter slhows the root of major chord , , either complete or imperfect , and of strong discords , and a smaller letter gives the root of weak discords , a number pointing out the family .
In the minor triad the characteristic number is omitted ; thus c is written for 15 c , meaning the minor triad ge 6 , which is the major tetrad 15 C , or CGB B , with its root C omitted , and is usually called " the minor chord of e , " ' a nomenclature which conceals its derivation .
Although chords of the same type have the same general character , this is so much modified by the particular forms which they can assume , that it is necessary to examine these forms in detail , They may be distinguished as simple and duplicated .
In the former the number of constituients is the same as in the type ; thus 4 , 5 , 6 ; 2 , 3 , 5 are simiple forms of the type 1 , 3 , 5 .
In the latter , the number of constituents is increased by the higher octaves of some or all of them ; thus 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 ; 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 are duplicated forms of 1 , 3 , 5 and 2 , 5 , 6 , as they contain the octaves 1 , 2 and 2 , 4 .
The mode in which the effect of any or all of these combinations may be calculated is shown in Table VII .
, which consists of two corresponding parts , each commencing with a column containing the " No. of J. H. , " or of the joint harmonics resulting from the combination of the harmonics of the constituent compound tones .
The next columns are headed by the relative pitch of the constituent tones , and contain their harmonics , never extending beyond the 8th , arranlged so that their pitch is opposite to the corresponding number of the joint harmonic .
lt is thus seen at a glance which harmonics of the constituents are conjunct or tend to reinforce each other , and produce a louder joint harmonic , and also which are disjunlict and pulsative .
In the second part of the Table the extent of each harmonic of each constituent is given on the assumptions already explained .
To find the extent of the joint harmonic , we add the extents of the generating conjunct harmonics , and thence find the intensity by squaring and dividing by 100 .
The differential tones must then be found by subtracting the pitches of the primaries ( or in exceptionial cases of higher and , louider harmonics ) .
The intensity of these differential tones may be called I for a single tone , and 4 for two concurrent tones , and this number may be subscribed to the intensity of the corresponding joint harmonic , as 0 , , 254 .
The beat intervals have next to be noted , and the beat factors , which are usually the reciprocal of the relative pitch of the lower pulsative harmonic .
Thus for the dyad 3 , 4 the beat interval is ' , and the beat factor l. From this factor , or 1 : !
, we calculate the range P:p= 70f : Of= 210 : 30 in the present case .
This must not be reduced , as it shows that the interval is dissonant when the pitch of the lower tone is between 30 and 210 .
To find the intensity , we add and subtract the extents of the pulsative joint harmonics ; in this case 50 and 33 are the extents of the 8th and 9th joint harmonics , and their sum and difference are 83 and 17 .
Then we take the ratio of their squares , each divided by 100 , which gives 69 : 3 .
This result must not be reduiced , as it gives not only the relative loudness of the swell and fall , but also the loudness of these in relation to the other z ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c WC0 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cd 70 t-k 9 cZ -4~00 0-D , ( 2 0 ( ) Q3Q Q0004o ~-~ 9 4r 4-4 cd -4 rt -4 -4 tca ~440 t~ ; r , ~~~~~~ I ~~~ ~~ 0t~~~~ ~cfk0k0I O rn ________ ~~~~~~~~~~~ 0____ _1 _____IC Cc CC CCCCCC CCCC H 0+-3 4C o ~~~~~~ o~~~oo 0000~~C .

It must be remembered that when there are several disjunct harmonics , their unbroken sound tends to obliterate the actioni of the beats .
There is no sensible silence between the beats unless the tones are simple and the intensities nearly equal .
The intensities of the beats between joint harmonics and differential tones cannot be reduced to figures .
It is not large .
The history of a beat is therefore giveln by four fractions , which in this case are the interval 9 : 8 , the factor I : 3 , the range 210 : 30 , and the intensity 69 : 3 .
These calculations have been made for concordant dyads in Table VIII .
, and for concordant or major triads in Table IX .
An attempt has been made to arrange the 13 forms of the first , and the 20 forms of the second in order of sonorousness , by considering the distribution of the intensities ' among the several joint harmonics , the development of pulsative differential tones , and the nature of the beats , omitting those due to the seventh harmonic of an isolated constituent .
It has not been thought necessary to give the history of every beat .
The intervals of all the beats are seen at a glance by the list of intensities of the joint harmonics .
By Table VIII .
we see that the only unisonant dvad is the octave 1 , 2* , which will be as unisonant as the constituents themselves .
All other dyads are occasionally dissonant .
Thus the fifth itself is decidedly dissonant when the pitch of the lower constituent lies between 20 and 140 .
On a bass conicertina tuned justly , I find the fifth , C4G4 , quiite intolerable , the fifth , C G , rough , but D tA nearly smooth , and at higher pitches there is no perceptible dissonance .
The beat interval of the major third is 16 : 15 , and the range of dissonance is much greater .
The roughness can be distinctly heard as high as c e ; in the lower octaves CE is quiite discordant , and C4E4 intolerable .
This Table VIII .
, therefore , establishes the fact that concordance does not depend on simplicity of ratio alone ; but when the denominator of the beat factor is small the range is lower , and therefore the diqsonance less felt .
Dissonance also arises from the pulsative differential tones 7 and 11 , so that if the relative pitches are expressed in terms high enough to differ by 7 and 11 , the combination will be dissoilant .
The ear is also not satisfied with forms in which great intensities of joint harmonics are widely separated by many small intensities .
The four last forms in Table VIII .
, namely , the minor tenith 5 , 12 , the eleventh 3 , 8 , and the two thirteenths 3 , 10 and 5 , 16 , shoild therefore be treated as discords .
The Table also suggests how defects may be remedied by introducing new constituents to fill up gaps , or by duplications .
Similar observations apply to the triads in Table IX .
None of them can le unisonant at all pitches .
Some of them , as the last seven , are really discordant .
The gaps may be generally filled up by duiplication .
Thus 1 , 3 , 5 may be converted into 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and by thus strengthening the 2 , 4 , and 8 joint harmonics the finest form of concord is produced .
In this way the series of duplications in Table X. was produced .
In this Table an example has been added to each form to , acilitate trial ; but the great imperfection of the major third in the ordinary system of tuning , pianos and harmoniums materially deteriorates the effect of the choirds , which ought to be taken on some justly tuned instruiment .
The discords may be deduced from Tables VII .
and VIII .
, when properly extended , by supposing 7 , 9 , 15 , 17 , 25 , 27 , 45 to be used in the first , and their effect allowed for in the second .
The additional discordant effect of 7 will be necessarily least felt where 7 occurs as a differential tone , but these are not the best forms of either triad or tetrad .
In the better forms the dissonances 6 , 7 and 7 , 8 will always be well developed , and as the latter is sharper , the omission of 8 , at least as a constitueint tone , is suggested .
If 7$ is used instead of 7 , the omission of 8 becomes more urgent , while 6 , 7$ will beat less sharply than 6 , 7 , and therefore almost inaudibly .
The real beats of the constituents 6 , 7$ arise from the harmonics 6 .
6 , 5 .
7- , or 36 , 355 , which are , however , not so much felt as those of 6 .
6 , ,5 .
7 arising from 6 , 7 , because 36 : 355= 10125 is further from 16 : 15= 10667 than is 36 : 35 1-0286 .
Hence , when 8 is omritted , the dissonance arising from 7$ is less than that arising from 7 itself .
When 8 is present , 7 or 7-1is superior to 7$ .
The use of 17TL5 for 17 would hardly create any perceptible alteration of roughness when 18 is absent , and when 18 is present 18:1 7 --1 0548 is further from 16 : 15 than is 18 : 17=1 0588 , and therefore the roughness is not quite so great .
Of all discords the least dissonant is the minor triad 3 , 5 , 15 , which is formed from the tetrad 1 , 3 , 5 , 15 by omitting the root 1 , to avoid the dissonance 15 , 16 .
When the differential tones derived from the primaries of the constituents are deeper than the primaries , and therefore merely indicate the presence of a pulsative tone , which is only faintly realized by the differential tones derived from the upper harmonics of the primaries , and whein the dissonant intervals of the mninor tenth and major thirteenth 5 , 12 and 3 , 10 are not present in the constituent tones , this chord may be treated as a concord .
But in most positions the minor triad is sensibly dissonant , as shown in Table XI .
, where an attempt has been made to arrange its 20 forms in order of sonorousness .
The pitches of the differential tones are added , and examples subjoined .
The effect of the minor chord is very much injured by the usual tuning of harmoniums , &amp;c. A peculiar character of these and other discords , when the pulsative constituent is not the highest , consists in the quality of tone being due to very high joint harmonics , except such as are due to differential tones .
The root will be consequently extremely deep when the constituent tones are taken at a moderate absolute pitch .
This great depth renders its recognition by the ear difficuilt .
Hence probably the disputes of musicians coincerning the roots of certain discords , and their error in considering 5 ; to be ____ ___ ___ ___ ____ tail IX.-Qualities of Concordant Triads.__(See p. 399.)_______ 123456789 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 No. 5556868 10 6 10 10 12 10 12 12 12 16 16 16 16 Index .

CLords will evidently be related to each other when one or more of their constituents are identical , and natural qualities of tone will be related which have one or more identical harmonics , or which form parts of related chords .
Transitions between related chords and compounid tones will be easy and pleasing .
Hence , in forming a collection of compound tones for use either as natural qualities of toi.e ( in melody ) or as constituents of artificial qualities of tone , that is , chords ( in harmony ) , it is important to select such as will have numerous relations , and will produce the concordant dyads and triads , and the least dissonant discord , the minor triad .
Hence , taking the concordanit major triad 1 , 3 , 5 as a basis , we must possess its products by 2 , 3 , and.5 .
There must be abundant multiples by 2 in order to take the several forms of the triad and to introduce the duplications .
The products by 3 and 5 give 3 , 9 , 15 and 5 , 15 , 25 .
We have then the tones 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 15 , 25 , and their octaves .
These give three concordant major triads , 1 , 3 , 5 ; 3 , 9 , 15 ; and 5 , 15 , 25 , each of which has one constituent in common with each of the others .
We have also the major peritad 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 15 , the ninie-tetrad 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , the major tetrad 1 , 3 , 5 , 15 , and the minor tetrad 3 , 5 , 9 , 15 , whence , by omissions , resuilt the ninetriad 1 , 3 , 9 and minor triad 3 , 5 , 15 .
Each of these triads is related to two of the three major triads .
The minor triad is intimately related to all three major triads by having two constituents in commoln with each of them .
The discords involving 7 and 17 would evidently require 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 17 to be taken as a basis .
Neglecting these discords for the present , the above results show that we should obtain a useful series of tones by multiplying 1 , 3 , 5 successively by 3 , and each product by 5 , taking octaves above and below all the tones thus introduced .
We thus find MAJOR .

Such multiplications are presumed to have been made in the columns of notes .
Hence tA : =81 : 5.16 , or t=81 : 80 , F : F-135 : 1.128 , or $=135 : 128 , tM C= 25 : 3.8 , or +4= 25 : 24 , whence o=80 : 81 .
And in the same way the other ratios in 'Proceedings , ' vol. xiii .
p. 95 , are reproduced .
In addition to the chords already noticed , we have now the twenty-seven tetrad , 1 , 3 , 5 , 27 , or F C. AD , and the twenty-seven triad , 1 , 5 , 27 , or FAD , and all the discords derived from 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 15 , 25 , 27 , 45 .
But for those derived from 7 and 17 substitutes must be employed .
These are obtained as follows .
The chord 9 , 27 , 45 , 1 .
64 is 9 times 1 , 3 , 5 , 74 , so that GDBF approximates to 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 in a Tnanner already tested .
Again , 1 .
32 , 3 .
32 , 5 .
32 , 225 is 32 times 1 , 3 , 5 , 7U-JT whence F CA 1D : gives the second and closer approximation to 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 already conisidered .
When 71 is used for 7 it will be better to use 1 , 3 , 5 , 74 , 88 , or one-ninth of 9 , 27 , 45 , 1 .
64 , 5 .
16 , that is GBD FA , in place of 1 , 3 , 5 , 7- , 9 or one-ninth of 9 , 27 , 44 , 1 .
64 , 81 , that is GBD FtA , to avoid the dissonance 5 .
7g , 4 .
9 , or 3540 , 36 .
This will therefore replace the seven-nine pentad 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 .
The chord 45 , 135 , 225 , 5 .
64 , 3 .
256 is 45 times 1 , 3,.5 , 74 , 1711 &gt; or B F# JD : A C , and it forms an excellent substitute for the seven-seventeen pentad 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 17 .
Again , the chord 3 .
16 , 5 .
16 , 15 .
16 , 135 , or 16 times 3 , 5 , 15 , 164 , that is CGAE F , is a sufficiently close approximation to the rouigh discord 3 , 5 , 15 , 17 .
It has already been shown that the alterations in the discords thus produced will be slight , and , under certain circumstances , improvements .
The omission of 7 , 17 in the base 1 , 3 , 5 is therefore justified .
Their insertion would embarrass the performer and composer by an immense variety of tones very slightly differing from each other , as 64 , 63 ; 13a , 136 ; 255 , 256 .
As it is , the distinction between 81 , 80 is the source of much difficulty , and separates chords such as 81 , 243 , 405 , and 5 .
16 , 15 .
16 , 25 .
16 , or 80 , 240 , 400 , that is , ta tE C : and AE tC , which composers desire to consider as identical .
It was shown in my former paper ( Proceedings , vol. xiii .
p. 98 ) that the use of 1 , 3 , 5 as a basis requires 72 different tones , exclusive of octaves .
The introduction of 7 in the base would increase this number by 45 , and the initroduction of 17 by 30 , while the mental effect produced would be very slightly -different .
On the other hand , if instead of 1 , 3 , 5 as a base , we took 1 , 2v , 4T , where v , T are ratios differing slightly from 3 : 2 and 5 : 4 , we might avoid the ratio 81 : 80 , reduce the number of tones to 27 , and greatly increase the relations of chords .
How to effect this important result with the least dissonant effect will be considered in the following paper on Temperament .
The three major triads 1 , 3 , 5 ; 3 , 9 , 15 ; 9 , 27 , 45 are so related as to form two major pentads , 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 15 and 3.1 , 3.3 , 3 .
5 , 3 .
9 , 3.15 .
Hence the middle triad forming part of both pentads connects the three triads into a whole , closely related to the middle triad , and therefore to its root .
These are called the tonic chord and tonic tone , and the connexion itself is termed tonality .
If octaves of these tones be taken , thus , 1.32 , 3.8 , 5.8 or FCA , 3.8 , 9.4 , 41.2 CGE , 9 .
4 , 27 , 45 GDB , and the results be takeln in order of pitch , we find , on supplying the second octave 3 .
16 , 24 , 27 , 30 , :32 , 36 , 40 , 4.5 , 48 C , D , E , _F , G , A , B , c. In this series any two consecutive tones , except 40 , 45 or A , B , belong to the same major pentad , and these are therefore eminently adapted for successions of chords .
Even 40 , 45 , or 5 .
8 , 45 , belong to two related discords ; for 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , or F , C , A , G , and 1 , 3 , 5 , 27 , or F CAD , !
have each two constituents in common with 9 , 27 , 45 , 1 .
64 , or GDB F. The discord 3 , 5 , 15 , 45 , or CA E B , contains both the tones in question .
These considerations justify the major diatonic scale .
The last discord containis a miinor triad , 3 , 5 , 1 5 .
These minor triads , from their relations to three major triads , are evidently peculiarly adapted to initroduce successions of harmonies .
Taking , then the three minor triads and forming their octaves , thus 3.64 , 5 .

256 , or BF , tD : a c , already noticed , the major triad , 45 , 135 , 225 , or B F$ tDt , is brought into close connexion with the minor triad , 3 , 5 , 15 , or ca e. Practically the use of the minor scale consists of a union of four major triads , 1 , 3 , 5 ; 3 , 9 , 15 ; 9 , 27 , 45 ; 27 , 81 , 135 , forming two major scales , with three other major triads , 5 , 15 , 25 ; 15 , 45 , 75 ) ; 45 , 135 , 225 , forming a third major scale , by means of three minor triads , 3 , 5 , 15 ; 9 , 15 , 45 ; 27 , 4.5 , 135 , the roots of which , 1 , 3 , 9 , are the same as the roots of the first three major triads .
There are therefore seven roots to all the chords introduced , namely 1 , 3 , 9 , 27 , and 5 , 15 , 45 , or F , C , G , D and A , E , B , and these seven roots form a major diatonic scale .
From these relations spring all the others which distinguish the minor scale together with all its various forms and its uncertain tonality , which is generally assumed to be the relation of the chords to 15 or E , the tonic of the last three major triads , but which evidently wavers between this and 3 , 9 or C , G , the tonics of the first fouir major triads , and these three tonics , 3 , 9 , 15 , or CG E , form ' a major triad .
By exteniding this system of ehords up and down , right and left , we arrive at the perfect musical scale in Table V. ( Proceedings , vol. xiii .
p. 108 ) , which is therefore entirely justified oll physical and physiological grounds , without any of those metaphysical assumptions or mystical attribuites of numbers which have hitherto disfigured musical cience , In that Table the chords have been arranged in the forms 4 , 5 , 6 and 10 , 12 , 15 , in accordance with the usual practice of musicians .
In the present paper the typical 1 , 3 , 5 and 3 , 5 , 15 have , for obvious reasons , been made the basis of the arrangement .
