[ Mar. 7 , lengths obtained for the aurora line were 5595 , 5586 , and 5587 .
Unlike most observations , these place the aurora line on the less refrangible side of the manganese fluting .
Hence , we have an addi-tional reason for neglecting the difference between the wave-length of the brightest edge of the manganese fluting , and the commonly accepted wave-length of the aurora line , as given by Angstrom .
These observations are the latest which have been pub-lished , and were obviously made with a full knowledge of all previous work , so that their importance must be strongly insisted upon .
" I have already pointed out that Krafft 's measures were not made under circumstances which assured to them a high degree of accuracy j and Krafft 's own words , which I have quoted , disclaim expressly any special attempt on his part to redetermine the position of the principal line with a higher degree of accuracy than the observers who preceded him.\#151 ; March 4 .
