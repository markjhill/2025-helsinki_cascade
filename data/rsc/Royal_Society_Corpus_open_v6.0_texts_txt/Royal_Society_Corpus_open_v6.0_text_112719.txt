On the Action of Hydrochloric Acid on Codeia .
In Part II .
( Proc. Roy .
Soc. vol. xvii .
p. 460 ) it was shown that when codeia is heated with excess of hydrochloric acid under pressure that it splits up into chloride of methyl , water , and apomorphia , thusC8 , H , NO3 + HC1I= CH{ Cl H , 0+ C , , H , , NO , .
At the time it appeared probable that one of the two following reactions would first take place , forming an intermediate product : I. C18 121 NO 3+ HCI=CH3 C1 + C17 IH9 NO3 .
II .
C , H21 NO = H,2 0+ C181 H NO2 .
On investigation , however , it has been found that neither the one nor the other takes place , at least as the chief reaction ; for by heating codeia with excess of hydrochloric acid on the water-bath , a body is obtained by the following reactionC18 121 NO , + HC1H O+ C18 H20 C1 NO2 ; and this base , when heated under pressure with hydrochloric acid , splits up into chloride of methyl and apomorphia , C18 H20 C1 NO2 = CH3 C1 + C , , H1 , NO2 .
The new base may be obtained in a state of purity thus:-codeia is heated under paraffin on the water-bath with ten to fifteen times its weight of strong hydrochloric acid for twelve to fifteen hours , and the resulting brownish liquid evaporated to dryness on the water-bath ; the residue is dissolved in water , and excess of bicarbonate of sodium added , whereby a voluminous white precipitate is formed , consisting chiefly of the new base mixed with a trace of apomorphia .
The filtrate contains the unaltered G2 83 codeia mixed with a little of the new base , which is not quite insoluble in bicarbonate of sodium solution ; the precipitate is washed with ammoniawater to remove the trace of apomorphia ( which is much more soluble in ammonia than the new base ) , and is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid and fractionally precipitated by bicarbonate of sodium : the second fraction is pure white , and is free from apomorphia and codeia ; this is then extracted with ether , which dissolves almost the whole .
The clear ethereal solution is then shaken up with a few drops of hydrochloric acid , and the solution of hydrochlorate thus obtained , if coloured , must be fractionally precipitated by bicarbonate of sodium , and the ether and hydrochloric-acid process repeated ; the resulting product is a viscid colourless solution of the hydrochlorate of the new base , which refuses to crystallize .
When evaporated on the water-bath , the dry residue yielded the following numbers on analysis:(I .
) 0-3270 gramme , burnt with lead chromate , gave 0-7230 carbonic acid and 0'1820 water .
( II .

If codeia be regarded as being formed on the mixed type Ha3 N then the HN new base may be looked upon as formed on the mixed type HCI ; and , using Professor Foster 's nomenclature* for these types ( viz. oxynitride and chloronitride respectively ) , codeia would be oxycodide , and the new base chlorocodide ; but until further investigation affords some knowledge of the nature of the radicals occurring in codeia and morphia , it would be premature to attempt to give rational formulae for these bases .
The folfowing Table ( p. 86 ) exhibits the comparative reactions of solutions containing 1 per cent. of the hydrochlorates of morphia , codeia , apomorphia , and chlorocodide respectively .
The physiological action of chlorocodide appears to be much less marked than that of apomorphia .
Doses of 4 grain of the hydrochlorate taken internally and -0 grain injected subcutaneously produced no appreciable effect ; Dr. Gee is now engaged in studying this subject .
§ 2 .
Action of lydrochloric Acid on Clhlorocodide .
When the hydrochlorate of this base is sealed up with eight to fifteen times its weight of strong hydrochloric acid and heated to 140 ?
-150 ?
for three hours , the tube is found , after cooling , to contain a layer of liquid chloride of methyl floating at the top : the tarry contents of the tube , when dissolved in water and precipitated by bicarbonate of sodium , yield , on shaking up the ethereal extract with a few drops of hydrochloric acid , a copious supply of crystals of hydrochlorate of apomorphia ; these , when drained from the mother liquors , washed with cold water , and recrystallized , had all the physical properties of the hydrochlorate of apomorphia from morphia , gave the same qualitative reactions , and produced the same physiological effects , and gave the following numbers on analysis after drying at 100 ?

It is worthy of notice that this reaction probably takes place gradually , while that whereby apomorphia and chloride of methyl are formed direct from codeia appears to occur suddenly , thereby bursting the large majority of sealed tubes used : this never occurred with chlorocodide .
§ 3 .
Action of Wrater on the Hydrochlorate of Chlorocodide .
When the hydrochlorate ( obtained by dissolving the base freed from codeia &amp;c. by the process previously described in as small an excess of hydrochloric acid as possible ) is sealed up with ten to fifteen times its weight of water and heated for three hours to 130 ?
-140 ?
, it splits up into hydrochloric acid and hydrochlorate of codeia , no gas whatever being formed during the reaction .
Ci H20 C1 NO , HCl+ H2O 0= HCl1+ C,18 H2I NO3 , HC1 .
In two experiments the amount of free hydrochloric acid thus formed was estimated by titration with a solution of carbonate of sodium , and after subtraction of the small amount due to the excess of hydrochloric acid in the original liquid ( estimated in the same way ) , was found to amount respectively to 9 and 10 per cent. of the hydrochlorate employed , the theoretical amount according to the above equation being 10-3 ; the amount of undecomposed chlorocodide was found to be very small , the liquid resulting from the digestion giving but a minute precipitate with carbonate of sodium .
The filtrate from the carbonate-of-sodium precipitate was extracted with ether , and the ethereal solution obtained shaken with a few drops of hydrochloric acid ; an oily liquid was thus obtained , which on standing several hours deposited crystals ; these , when drained from the mother liquors and recrystallized , had the character of hydrochlorate of codeia , and gave the following numbers after drying in an ordinary water-bath till constant in weight .
As crystallized hydrochlorate of codeia is stated to lose one-fourth of its water of crystallization at 100 ?
, a sample was prepared by dissolving codeia in hydrochloric acid and recrystallizing the product ; after drying in the same water-bath it was also burnt as a comparison ( III .
