Some Observations on the Head of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus .

] We learn from this communication that the beak of this singular animal , which on a cursory examination was thought to be exactly similar to that of the Duck , and calculated for the same purposes , is in fact materially different from it ; and that , so far from being the mouth of the animal , as had been imagined , it is only a part added to the mouth , and projecting beyond it .
This mouth has two grinding teeth on each side , both in the upper and lower jaw ; they are without fangs , and may be considered as bony protuberances .
Instead of incisor teeth , the nasal and palate bones are continued forwards , so as to support the upper portion of the beak ; while the two under jaws are likewise continued forwards in the shape of two thin plates of bone , forming the central part of the under portion of the beak .
The tongue is very short , and when extended can be projected into the bill scarcely one quarter of its length .
The organ of smell in this animal differs from that of quadrupeds in general , as well as of birds .
The nostrils are nearly at the end of the beak , while the turbinated bones are situated in the skull , as in other quadrupeds ; by which means there are two cavities the whole length of the beak superadded to this organ .
The nerves which supply this organ are very large in proportion to the size of the animal .
Considering this curious structure of the nose in an animal which lives in water , it is natural to conclude that nature has fitted it for discovering its prey in that element , by means of the sense of smell ; and that for this purpose it is enabled to introduce this prominence into the small recesses in which its natural food is probably concealed .
