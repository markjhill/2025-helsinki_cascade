The Postscript of a Letter from Mr. Nath .
Down to the Hon. Mr. Greenville , concerning an Earthquake felt at Bridport , on March 18 .
1749-50 .
SIR , Bridport , March 19 .
1749 .
YESTERDAY Morning the Sun shone very bright ; which , between 11 and 12 , was with thick dark Clouds so obscured , as rendered it darker than common .
Soon after , a violent Clap of Thunder , and a heavy Shower of Hail , succeeded : After which it grew again serene ; and in the Evening about 6 , a Shock of an Earthquake was felt in this Town , and the neighbouring Villages , with ( thro ' Mercy ) no other Damage than a great Surprise to all who felt it .
I am , SIR , Your most obedient , and very humble Servant , Nath .
Down .
