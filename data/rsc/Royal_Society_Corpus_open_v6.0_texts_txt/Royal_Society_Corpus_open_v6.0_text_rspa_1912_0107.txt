These points fall on two curves intersecting at the eutectic point 1065o per cent. , Cu per centHeyn found that all his mixtures showed a halt in the cooling curve at this eutectic temperature , so that within the of his experiments there is no evidence of the existence of solid solutions .
C. N. has lately published some experiments on the melting points of the system cuprous oxide-silica .

The highest temperature at which he found a halt in the cooling curve was 1205o C. Foot and Smith* found that the dissociation pressure of cuprous oxide does not exceed 1 mm. at 1020o C. It was the original intention of the authors to place a weighed amount of cuprous oxide in the furnace described in the previous paper , evacuate , heat to a certain temperature , determine the steady pressure obtained , and then to pump off the oxygen a little at a time , measure it , and determine again the steady pressure obtained .
From the amount of pumped off the composition of the mixture of copper cuprous oxide in the furnace at any time could have been determined after allowing for the known volume of the apparatus .
In this way a sel.ies of pressure-composition isothernls would have been obtained , from which the pressure , temperature , and temperature-composition rams could have been constructed .
Ths method was found to impossible , ving to the rapid volatilisation of the mixture from the boat into the cool ends of the tube , and it became necessary to investigate that portion of the melting diagram which was untouched by Heyn , in order to explain the results of our dissociation pressure measurenlents .
The Meltiny Point \mdash ; Two samples of cuprous oxide obtained from Kahlbaum were analysed by reduction in hydrogen and were found to contain and 8 per cent. respectively .
The former was a sample which had been in the laboratory stock for three years .
The cuprous oxide used in the following experiments was made by reducing an alkaline solution of copper sulphate with rape sugar at C. in presence of tartaric acid .
The product usually contained a small quantity of metallic copper .
The copper used in making up the mixtures for melting point determinations was either powder reduced from the oxide by heating in hydrogen , or electrolytic copper in form of short pieces of thin wire .
The oxide or mixture of oxide and metal was placed in ] azed crucible of Royal Berlin porcelain of the form generally sold as a Rose crucible .
These crucibles were found to be quite inappreciably attacked by or , even when exposed to their action for all hour at 1350o C. Each crucible held about 25 .

The thermo-couple was protected by tubes of the same material as the crucibles .
The thermo- couple was threaded through one of the tubes intended for introducing the 'Amer .

The crucibles were heated in a platinum-wound resistance furnace , through which was passed a stream of to avoid oxidation of the charge .
After the substance had become completely melted , the heating current was cut off and the cooling curve obtained .
temperatures were read on a miilivolt meter which was checked from time to time by means of potentiometer .
The couple was of platinum-platinum-rhodium ; it had been calibrated at the point of copper .
After the cooling curve been obtained the mass was broken up , from the adhering pieces of crucible , and analysed by reduction in hydrogen .

In one Jeriment the crucible was allowed to cool very slowly in the furnace so that equilibrium might be attained at the lowest temperature at which the two phases could exist , that is at 1195o .

The figure shows that the system is similar to that of phenol and tel The melting point of pure cuprous oxide is about 1210o C. Ab temperatules above 1195o mixtures having a composition between 20 per cent. and 95 per cent. cuprous oxide separate into two layers .
The above results show that up to 1400o C. there is only a slight } of this range of concentration , that is to say increase of temperature only slightly increases the Messrs. R. E. Slade and F. D. Farrow .

It is , however , just possible that the quenching was not rapid enough and that in all the experiments the equilibrium obtained was approximately that at 1195o .
Dissociation Pressures.\mdash ; From the melting point diagram we can , by means of the phase rule , determine what type of ( pressure , temperature ) diagram will be obtained .
Since the system contains two components , copper and oxygen , there must be three phases present for one degree of freedom , or in the usual notation of the phase rule That is to say , if there are three phases present there will be a definite pressure corresponding to each temperature , but if there are only two phases present\mdash ; e.g. liquid and gas\mdash ; the pressure will depend on the composition as well.as upon the temperature .
The diagram ( projection on the surface ) will be of the type shown in fig. 2 .

] Investigation of the System Copper-Cuprous Oxide .
529 \mdash ; The furnace described by one of us in the preceding paper ( p. 519 ) was used .
The tube was sealed to a tube which could be dipped in liquid air and which led to the vacuum gauge and Topler pump .
The arrangement is shown in fig. 3 .
FIG. 3 .
During all the experiments the portion of the tube was kept immersed in liquid air to condense any and evolved from the magnesia boat and so prevent them from affecting the measurements of the oxygen pressure .
Behind the vacuum gauge was a glass millimetre scale illuminated by a lamp and milk.glass screen .
The readings were made with a telescope ; they were accurate to mm. The magnesia boats used at first were made as follows : Pure magnesia was fused in an electric arc or resistance furnace , ground up until it passed through a sieve with 90 meshes to the inch , and then made into a paste with magnesium chloride solution .
A carbon mould having been made for the boat , it was lined with the paste and then dried , first at , then at The boat had now become quite hard owing to the formation of magnesium oxychloride and adhered firmly to the mould .
Mould and boat were then gradually heated in a granular carbon resistance furnace up to 1800-200 C. On opening the furnace the boat was quite hard and had become loose from the mould .
* Ihese boats were quite refractory , but were unsuitable for the work in hand because the liquid mixtures of Cu and rapidly absorbed by the porous magnesia .
Besides this it was found that these boats gave off large quantities of .
This obviously comes from the sulphur absorbed by the nesia from the retort carbon in which it was baked .
One of these boats having a volume of about 4 .
of magnesia on heating in vacuo to 1400o C. gave off .

Messrs. R. E. Slade and F. D. Farrow .
[ Sept. 24 , These two defects were overcome by making the boats in the following way : A vertical carbon electrode made an arc with the bottom of a carbon crucible ; nesia was then fed into the crucible to smother the arc .
* In three or four minutes , when the magnesia had been well melted by the high power arc of 30-40 kw .
, the current was cut off .
A piece of solid magnesia , like irregularly-shaped teacup glazed on the inside , was found in the crucible .
In such a lump one or two portions suitable for a boat , when cut away from the mass , would be found .
The lump was carefully broken to these portions , and the boats finally shaped by grinding on an emery wheel .
These boats were taken from the lump in such a way that the inside of the boat was formed of the glazed surface of the magnesia round the arc .
After the tube had been in use for some and a deposit of had formed on the cool parts , a run was made with the furnace empty .
The pressure rose only to mm. in one hour at C. The cuprous oxide was prepared as described in the first part of this paper .
In most of the experiments a small quantity of electrolytic copper was added to the cuprous oxide , so that if the euprous oxide had been slightly oxidised we should , after heating up , have the system and not the system .
The boats held about .

results of experiments on the dissociation pressure are shown in fig. 4 , where the are plotted as ordinates against the time as abscissae .
Each continuous curve is an isotherm .
The temperature , during an experiment lasting up to , was usually kept within 1o C. and always within a range of , and are curves of the system liquid ( 1 ) liquid ( 2)-gas .
It is seen that after about three hours the pressure becomes quite steady , when the temperature is , but a much shorter period is necessal for equilibrium to be attained at ( Curve III ) .
Curve is the dissociation urve of the -variant system liquid-gas at 1240o .
In this case , where there was not sufficient copper present to form two liquid phases , the pressure was still rising after five hours ; no equilibrium was reached .
The explanation of this is that Cu was being volatilised more rapidly than from the liquid phase , which thus became richer in , and so had a ] oxygen pressure .
From analogy with other metals we should expect the metal to have a greater vapour pressure than the oxide .
In those experiments in which there were two liquid phases present volatilisation would only affect the quantity of the two Both the eyes and face of the operator must , of course , be suitably protected from the ultra-violet light of such an arc .

531 liquid phases and not their composition ; therefore so as neither of the liquid phases had completely disappeared the system had a definite oxygen pressure .
The quantity of copper and cuprous oxide left in the boat after an experiment was , in only one case , enough for an analysis of sufficient accnracy to determine whether there had been one or two liquid phases present during the experiment .
Usually more than half of the mixture had been volatilised from the boat .
An analysis of the boat at the conclusion of one experiment ( Curve II ) gave Cu .
Tlus corresponds to a mixture cent. cent. .
Such a mixture would form two liquid phases at the temperatul.e of experiment , , as may be seen reference to fig. 1 .
The vapour of copper at these temperatures Dlay be calculated with a fair degree of as follows : has deternJined the boiling point of copper at one atmosphere to be 2310o , and has shown that the effect of pressure on the point of copper is sinilar to its effect on Thus where and are the absolute boiling points of } ) and mercury respectively at one atmosphere pressure , and and their boiling points at some other pressure .

[ Sept. 24 , at 1300o C. , that is 1573o absolute .
Then the temperature on the absolute scale at which mercury would have this same pressure is The pressure of mercury at this temperature\mdash ; 115o C.\mdash ; is approximately 1 mm. This is , therefore , also the vapour pressure of copper at 1300o C. It might be expected that the would not be appreciably volatile se , but that it would only volatilise by dissociating into copper and oxygen which , when they have diffused into the cooler parts of the apparatus , recombine , but this does not seem to be the case , for the authors find that a small piece of can be volatilised from a platinum strip at 1300o C. in a few minutes , even in air where the oxygen pressure is too great for diQsociation into copper and oxygen to take place , and would cause partial oxidation to cupric oxide .
Curve shows the results of an experiment in which a small piece of platinum was added to the mixture of cuprous oxide and copper to determine whether it would raise the dissociation pressure .
This was found to be the case , a steady pressure of 16 mm. being obtained , whilst at the same temperature\mdash ; 1240o C.\mdash ; without the platinum the dissociation pressure was 10 mm. This experiment was undertaken to explain an earlier experiment , in which an abnormally high pressure had been obtained .
and where it was found that a little of the oxide had been upset on to the hot part of the platinum tube .
The four values obtained for the pressure of the system liquid ( 1 ) liquid ( 2)-gas are given in Table and plotted in fig. 5 .
This is a portion of the curve of fig. 2 .

533 Table In one experiment at 1230o the system liquid-gas gave a pressure of 39 mm. after five and a-half hours , but the pressure was still steadily rising , owing to volatilisation of copper from the liquid phase , making the latter continually richer in cuprous oxide .
Thermodynamic Theory.\mdash ; Allmand* has calculated the dissociation pressure of the system solid -solid Cu-gas at C. from measurements of the E.M.F. of the cell .NaOH/ Pt. and found atmosphere .
He has also calculated this pressure by means of the Nernst formula , which in this case is where and If Using this same formula Stahl has calculated that at 1662o C. atmosphere .
For 1250o C. , about which our experiments were made , we get atmosphere mm. This is the pressure we should expect for the system solid -solid Cu-gas at 1250o C. , if it could exist at this temperature , and assuming that the heat of reaction did not vary with the temperature .
For the system liquid ( 1)-liquid ( 2)-gas at 1250o C. we get from our experimental results 11 mm. There are no data available for applying Nernst 's mula to this equilibrium , for we should require to know the heat of the reaction Liquid ( 1 ) \mdash ; liquid ( 2 ) oxygen , where liquid ( 1 ) is the phase rich in cuprous oxide and liquid ( 2 ) that rich in copper .
Allmand ( loc. cit. ) points out that the law of mass action applied to the equilibrium gives the equation 'Chem .

so that at a iven temperature we should expect greater , if in place of the solid system we had the system solid -liquid-gas since would be lower for liquid thau for solid , the pressure of the liquid copper would be lowered by the formation the solution .
In the system of which we have measured the pressure , liquid ( 1)-liquid ( 2)-gas , both and will be lower than they would be if both the metal and oxide remained solid up to the temperature under consideration .
Since , however , is proportional to , and inyersely proportional to if the ratio in which and are lowered is the same in both cases , the relative lowering of the value of vould be much greater than that of the value of should therefore expect to be greater for the liquid than for the solid systems .
As is shown above , the experimental value for the liquid systems reater than that calculated on the assumption that the system is solid at that temperature .
If the heat of dissociation does not vary with the temperature , we may apply the formula of va n't Hoff to calculate from our measurements at two temperatures .
We find from the values at 1205o and 1260o C. cals .
, and from the values at 1260o and 1324o cals .
At dinary temperature , the yalue of for the dissociation of solid into solid copper and is cals .
From the two values calculated from experiments it is obvious that is not independent of the temperature , and this is what we should expect if the composition of the two liquid phases changed with the temperature .
In our experiments we found a small change of composition with temperature , though , as is pointed out on p. 528 , this effect may be somewhat greater than is indicated in fig. 1 .
