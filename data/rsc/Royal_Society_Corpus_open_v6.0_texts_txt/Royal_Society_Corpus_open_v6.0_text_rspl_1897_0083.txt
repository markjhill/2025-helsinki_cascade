Influence of Acids and Alkalis The last glyph in the inscription is a Katun sign with the numeral 14 above it , and a sign for " beginning " in front of it , and indicates that the last date is the beginning of a 14th Katun .
If We turn to the table for the 9th Cycle of the 54th .
Great Cycle , from which we started , it will be seen that the 14th Katun of that cycle does commence with the date 6 Ahau 13 Muan .
It is simply impossible that the identity of the dates expressed in the inscription with those to which the computations have guided us can throughout be fortuitous .
Very nearly half of the forty-eight glyphs in the inscription have been accounted for , and I have no doubt that when the inscription passes under Mr Goodman 's scrutiny he will be able to give us much information about the remaining glyphs which I have passed over as undeciphered .
It can , I think , therefore , be fairly claimed for jVTr .
Goodman that his researches have raised the veil of mystery which has for so long hung over the carved hieroglyphic writing of the Mayas .
" Influence of Acids and Alkalis upon the Electrotonic Currents of Medullated Nerve .
" By Augustus D. Waller , M.D. , F.R.S. Received June 10 , \#151 ; Read June 17 , 1897 .
A. The Effect of Acids and of Alkalis .
Considering that electrotonic currents are characteristic of living medullated nerve , that such currents are due to electrolytic polarisation , and that such electrolysis must primarily consist in a liberation of electronegative principles ( oxygen , acid , Ac .
) at the anode , and of electropositive principles ( hydrogen , base , Ac .
) at the kathode , the first and most obvious test to be made is to examine comparatively the action of acids and bases upon anelectrotonic and katelectrotonic currents .
On the supposition that a medullated nerve-fibre is composed of two different electrolytes , white fatty sheath and grey proteid axis , and that electrolytic polarisation is aroused at the interface of separation between these two electrolytes , we may expect to find , as the characteristic acidic effect , diminution of A and increase of K , and as the characteristic basic effect , increase of A and diminution of K. This expectation is in the main substantiated by experiment , although owing to the somewhat narrow range of concentration within which moderate effects are produced , it is not common to obtain effects in both of the two opposite directions in a single experiment .
The reagent may be too weak , in which case neither A nor K are altered , or it may be too strong , in which case both A upon the Electrotonic Currents of Medullated Nerve .

Plates 2358 and 2359 illustrate this point , the former exhibiting the defective action of 82 Dr. A. D. Waller .
Influence , of Acids and Alkalis a base below optimum strength , the latter exhibiting the excessive action of an acid above optimum strength .
Partly for this reason , and partly in order to eliminate the resistance factor , results are formulated in terms of the relative magnitude of the quotient A/ K as well as in terms of the absolute magnitudes of A and K. This point is illustrated by plate 2410 .

upon the Electroionic Currents of Nerve .
83 Iu the earlier observations series of anelectrotonic and of katelec-trotonic currents were separately recorded .
In the later observations the A and K currents were taken at alternate minutes by means of a rotating reverser in the polarising circuit .
In the finished records A currents read upwards , and K currents read downwards .
Results.\#151 ; The characteristic results of acid and base upon the anodic and kathodic currents respectively are summarised in the following fonr observations ( Plates 2360 , 2412 , 2429 , 2432 ) .

They illustrate the rale that : Acidification diminishes the quotient A/ K. Basification increases the quotient A/ K. A diminution of the quotient A/ K may be by diminution of A or by increase of K. In plate 2412 it is mainly by diminution of A. In this case the augmentation of K is comparatively small .
The record in fact approaches towards the type of plate 2359 .

experiments ( e.g. , in plates 2429 and 2424 ) the diminution of A/ K is principally due to increase of K. An increase of the quotient A/ K may he by increase of A or by diminution of K. In plate 2360 , and in most of my other experiments , it is mainly by diminution of K. The two plates illustrate the points that acid affects A more than it does K , and that base affects K more than it does A. As mentioned above , acid above optimum strength causes a diminution of K ; we may , therefore , say that weak acid causes augmented K , and stronger acid diminished K. On testing carefully with very weak acids we shall find that at a strength below the optimum ( giving diminished A and increased K , e.g. , Plate 2429 ) the " very weak " acid causes augmented A. We may , therefore , say that very weak acid causes augmented A and rather stronger acid diminished A. And in genei*al summary of the action of acid from minimal to maximal effective we may state that:\#151 ; upon the Electrotonic Currents of Nerve .
85 ( 1 ) The weakest acid gives increased A. ( 2 ) Slightly stronger acid gives diminished A and increased K. ( 3 ) Still stronger acid gives diminished K. These statements are the outcome of a considerable number of observations , and one may hardly hope to verify the progressive action of acid from minimal to maximal in a single observation with a single acid .
Nor is it easy to give numbers in lieu of the indefinite qualifications " weak " and " strong .
" This much may , however , be said to give an idea of the order of magnitudes dealt with .
The second degree of change may be expected in consequence of bathing the nerve for one minute in an acid solution of a strength between N/ 20 and N/ 10 .
The free passage of " much " C02 into the nerve-chamber usually affects the second degree of change in its most typical form .
A small amount of C02 , a few puffs of expired air , will more probably affect the first degree of change .
A bath of one minute 's duration in a N/ 5 solution of mineral acid will almost certainly affect the third degree of change .
A diminution of K by C02 is rare ( e.g. , 2363 ) .
B. The Effect of Carbonic Acid and of I have given particular attention to the action of carbon dioxide and of tetanisation upon the A and K currents , in prosecution of observations already reported concerning the action-currents of nerve* and the influence of temperature upon the A and K currents .
The usual and typical effects of carbonic acid are of the characteristic acidic type , consisting in a diminution of A and an augmentation of K. H 2 Fig. 10.\#151 ; Action of C02 upon A and Iv ( 2422 ) .

Influence of Acids and Alkalis Less commonly , and by a slighter degree of action of C02 , the A current may be increased , while as the most pronounced degree of action of C02 the K current may be diminished .
In order of gravity the effects are : The second being the usual and typical result , the first and third being less frequently observed .
Prolonged tetanisation ( five minutes ) modifies the A and K currents in a similar direction , causing a diminution ( but sometimes an augmentation ) of the A current and an augmentation ( nearly always ) of the K current ( 2424 ) .
Thus it will be seen that the two groups of results , although not absolutely coincident , are in reasonable agreement , the two points of difference being that an augmentation of the A current has been more frequent by tetanisation than by C02 ; while a diminution of the K current , rarely observed in consequence of the full action of C02 , has been still more rare ( once only , and that not very markedly , 2287 ) in consequence of tetanisation .
Of these several effects the most characteristic has been the augmentation of K ( 2424 , fig. 11 ) with a consequent diminution of the quotient A/ K. And although\#151 ; in correspondence with the not infrequent augmentation of A , there has been not infrequently an augmentation of A/ K\#151 ; this latter augmentation has generally been slight or even doubtful as compared with its opposite .
I have been led to admit diminution of A/ K as typical ( 2424 , fig. 11 , 2425 2427 ) , and a distinct augmentation of A/ K as exceptional ( 2387 , 2388 , 2393 ) or doubtful .
( A similar augmentation of A/ K by predominant augmentation of A. has not hitherto come under my observation in consequence of the action of C02 .

The chief results of these experiments ( and of those on temperature* ) are to the following effect:\#151 ; The katelectrotonic current is augmented in consequence of ( a ) rise of temperature , ( b ) acidification , ( c ) tetanisation .
It is diminished by basification .
Its augmentation by tetanisation gradually declines during repose .
The anelectrotonic current is diminished in consequence of rise of temperature .
It is augmented by " very slight " acidification and by tetanisation , diminished by " slight " acidification and tetanisation .
The characteristic effect of the presumably " dissociative " influence of rise of temperature , of acidification , and of tetanisation , is a diminution of the quotient A/ K. A slighter and less assured effect of tetanisation consists in an augmentation of the quotient A/ K. Note.'\#151 ; The foregoing observations form part of an investigation of the action of reagents on nerve , towards the expenses of which a grant was made by the Physiological Sub-committee of the British Association to Miss S. C. M. Sowton , acting as my assistant in the prosecution of the research .
Our experiments during the last year have fallen under four heads:\#151 ; ( 1 ) On the action of acids and alkalis upon action-currents ; ( 2 ) on the action of acids and alkalis upon electrotonic currents ; ( 3 ) on the action of temperature upon electrotonic currents ; ( 4 ) on the action of anaesthetics , of neutral salts , and of alkaloids upon eleetrotonic currents .
The first and fourth of these four groups are not sufficiently advanced for publication , and have required to be prefaced by the second group which is now reported upon .
The third group is briefly reported on in ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' Dec. 17 , 1896 .
I wish to acknowledge Miss Sowton 's active participation during the past year in the work above specified .
Experiments under headings ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) will , it is to be hoped , be sufficiently advanced for publication during the coming year .
