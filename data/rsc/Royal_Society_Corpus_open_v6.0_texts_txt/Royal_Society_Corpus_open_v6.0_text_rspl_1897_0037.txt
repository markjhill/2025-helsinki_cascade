285 also the traction between the interfaces when it is divided : and the mode of calculation of the stress in a sphere of iron in a uniform magnetic field is indicated , agreeing for this case with Kircbhoff .
The mutual influence of stress and magnetisation is analysed , with reference to the experimental investigations of Bidwell .
Throughout the memoir care is taken to dispense , as far as possible , with detailed algebraic processes , which are essential for special computations and verifications , but are best evaded in the discussion of general principles .
Most of the discussion is also independent of the rotational aether scheme : the great advantage of an interlacing hypothesis of that kind , which remains even when it is only provisional , is that it gives an insight into the character of the formal relations that are possible or probable between the actual physical quantities involved in it .

( Abstract .
) The measurement of the vapour tension of solutions has hitherto been attended with serious errors .
This is especially true of the statical methods , which have alone been capable hitherto of furnishing results at temperatures between 60 ' C. and 100 ' C. The apparatus employed in this research was in conception similar to that described by Sakurai , * except that it was in duplicate , a divided steam supply passing through twoU-tubes placed in parallel .
It differed , however , from his apparatus in several important features , which cannot adequately be described in a paper of these dimensions .
Suffice it to say that the pressure on the contents of the two U-tubes , being the same , could be adjusted to any convenient value , and that the method of thermometry being differential , f the difference only of the boiling points of pure water and solution , in their respective U-tubes was recorded .
Two series of experiments were made at a pressure of 760 mrn .
, in one of which a small external heat supply was used to compensate the condensation in the L'-tubes , and a second in which this was dispensed with , and constancy in the amount of liquid operated on ( which proved to be of the first importance ) was * ' Chem. Soc. Journ. , ' 1892 .

secured by an automatic device .
The latter method was much the more satisfactory and regular , and is relied upon for the numbers published .
Neither method , however , gives results differing systematically from the other .
Observations were made at reduced pressures as well , and with very satisfactory results , but their publication is deferred .
The substances examined were the chloride and bromide of potassium and sodium , and chlorides of lithium , calcium , and strontium .
They were for the most part obtained from Messrs. Harringtons , and their purity confirmed by analyses .
As the full details both of the apparatus , observations , and calculations will be published later , the bare results are here stated .

But the discrepancy always exceeds the experimental error , except in the case of potassium chloride , and is particularly great in the case of calcium chloride .
The latter substance gave less defined boiling points than the others , for some unknown reason , and the experimental error is here certainly at its greatest , but not nearly great enough to account for the difference .
Certain other deductions will be made from these results and others which are accumulating , on a later occasion .

) The determination of the rate of transmission of heat from the surface of a heated metal to colder water in contact with it , or from hot water to a colder metal surface , is a problem of some importance
