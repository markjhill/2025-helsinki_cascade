" Further Remarks on the Sense of Sight in Birds .
" By Robert James Lee , M.A. , M.D. Communicated by Robert Lee , M.D. , F.R.S. Received October 14 , 1872 .
It was the object of my last communication to show the necessity for more extensive researches into the differences of certain structures in the eyes of birds in order to arrive at satisfactory conclusions regarding their functions , which are still undecided by anatomists .
It also appeared to me to be desirable and interesting to examine the different degrees of development which characterize those structures in different species of birds , as they seemed to afford an explanation of the remarkable powers of vision which most birds possess .
It would be premature to enter upon general deductions until the data we possess are more numerous and the anatomical details are generally allowed to be correct .
Since my last communication it has been my privilege to receive much assistance and valuable information from Mr. Hulke , who has directed considerable attention to the structure of the ciliary muscle in birds .
It appears to me impossible to reconcile the various opinions which Briicke , Cramer , Donders , and particularly Heinrich Miiller entertain on anatomical details , except on the supposition that the exact species of bird has not been considered of sufficient importance to the question , also that the particular method of dissection or preparation may have been the cause of a different appearance in the minute structures .
In my own experience I have often found that singular differences are produced by the method of preparation ; and it has usually been necessary , where there was any doubt , from the eye having been preserved for some time , to wait till a fresh specimen could be obtained .
In order to show the different degrees of development of the ciliary muscle , a short Table has been drawn up , containing those specimens which have been examined with most attention .
For the present I shall consider the ciliary muscle as a simple structure for the production of one effect , whatever minute differences may exist in the internal arrangement of its fibres .
The second Table may be regarded as a continuation of that commenced in my last communication , and is intended to furnish certain data which are necessary for the determination of the visual powers in various species of birds .
