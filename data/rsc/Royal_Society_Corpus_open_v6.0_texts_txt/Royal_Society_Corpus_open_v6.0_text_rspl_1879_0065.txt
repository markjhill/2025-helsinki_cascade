[ Nov. 27 , respects as much as possible alike , were taken ; one was killed hungryJ i.e. , twenty-four hours after feeding , the other in full digestion some 5\#151 ; 6 hours after a plenteous meal .
The gastric mucous membrane showed the usual difference to the unaided eye and to microscopical examination ; equal-sized pieces were removed from as near as possible a corresponding position of the fundus of each animal .
They were tested by Mr. Lea for ferment , the resting more granular piece was found to possess a not inconsiderably greater amount of ferment than the active less granular piece .
We may recall that Grutzner found the amount of ferment to diminish during digestion .
There is one other fact which leads us to connect the chief-cell granules with the ferment ; in protracted hunger the chief-cell granules , instead of increasing diminish , as we have mentioned above , occurs in the newt ; according to Grutzner , in protracted hunger , the ferment-content of the gastric mucous membrane diminishes .
To return to the consideration of the meaning of the finely granular chief-cells of the greater curvature .
These differ but little , histologically , from the pyloric gland cells .
Both form pepsin .
Such close similarity in form and function justify us in considering them to be fundamentally the same kind of cell .
How , then , do they stand related to the coarsely granular chief-cells P The distinguishing features of the latter are their coarsely granular appearance and their large ferment-content ; in an extreme digestive stage these features become much less conspicuous .
We are led , then , to think that the coarsely granular chief-cells are but a more highly developed form of the cells found in the other parts of the stomach as the finely granular chief-cells and pyloric gland cells .
The greater curvature of the rabbit probably corresponds to the intermediary portion of the stomachs of dog , cat , and rat. .
It will be noticed that in the main we advocate Heidenhain 's views , objecting , however , to the statement that the chief-cells and the pyloric gland cells are identical , since their normal appearance is so strikingly different .
The investigations , of which the foregoing is a brief account , were carried on in the Physiological Laboratory , Cambridge .

" Report on Phyto-Palseontological Investigations of the Fossil Flora of Sheppey .
" By Dr. Constantin Baron Ettingshausen , Professor in the University of Graz , Austria .
Communicated by Professor Huxley , Sec. R.S. Received November 3 , 1879 .
One of the most important , if not the most important , locality for the Eocene Flora of Great Britain , and perhaps of the tertiary forma- 1879 .
] On the Fossil Flora of Sheppey .
tion generally , is the London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey , in which are found great numbers of plant remains belonging to many different kinds of fossil fruits and seeds .
After an examination of the rich collection in the British Museum , I feel now sure that we possess , in the fruits and seeds of Sheppey , the key to a more precise determination of many of the genera and species of fossil plants which in other localities are known only by their leaves .
The literature of the Sheppey fruits is not very extensive ; a detailed account of all the works relating to it is published in Mr. Gardner 's " Introduction to our Monograph on the British Eocene Flora .
" Palseontographical Society , 1879 , p. 11 .
The only work on this subject with scientific determinations , and which need here be referred to , was published in the year 1840 by James Scott Bowerbank , and is entitled " A History of the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of the London Clay .
" He enumerates twelve genera , which are divided by him into nine families .
The genera are as follows : Nipadites , Hightea , Petro-philoides , Cupressinites , Cupanoides , Tricarpellites , Wetherellia , Cucu-mites , Faboidea , Leguminosites , Mimosites , Xulinosprionites .
Of these only one ( Nipadites ) , belongs to the Monocotyledons and one ( Cupressinites ) to the Gymnospermee , while the rest are Dicotyledons .
I am now able materially to advance the knowledge of this Flora .
Since my investigations in the course of the winter 1878-9 , at the British Museum , I have ascertained that the Fossil Flora of Sheppey contains , including those above mentioned , at least 72 genera and 200 species , which may be distributed into 41 families .
Of these genera one belongs to the Thallophyta , 7 to the Gymnospermee , 18 to Monocotyledons , 43 to the Dicotyledons , and 3 are indeterminable .
The existence of this Flora and generally of the Eocene Flora of Great Britain required , we believe , at least , a sub-tropical climate .
This is indicated by many of the ferns and palms , and by the Musaceee , Pandanse , Cinchonacese , Loganiaceee , Sapotaceae , Ebenaceae , Buttneria-ceae , Sapindaceae , \amp ; c. * Some only of the fossil fruits and seeds of Sheppey can be placed in living genera , but with regard to the rest , forming a considerable part of these , it was impossible , notwithstanding a careful comparison .
I therefore assume that some of the fruits and seeds belong to genera which no longer exist in the present Flora of the world .
In several of these extinct genera , however , I recognise their affinity with living genera , or at least determine the family to which they belong .
I have expressed this in the name of the genus .
But with many even that was impossible , and these I have placed in the meantime under the provisional name Carpolithes .
It is an important fact that the number of such extinct forms is relatively much larger than it is in any of the already known Miocene Floras .
I have also discovered fruits , but chiefly leaves belonging to many of the genera of the 390 Baron Ettingshansen .
[ Nov. 27 , Sheppej Flora in the Fossil Floras of Bournemouth and Alum Bay in the collections of the British Museum , and that of Mr. John Starkie Gardner , indicating that in age these are not far removed .
It is well known that the Sheppey Flora preceded the other two .
The genera which , I feel sure , are common to Sheppey and Bournemouth are ij Sphseria , Sequoia , Cyperites , Smilax , Sabal , Iriartea , Aronium , Quercus , Juglans , Liquidambar , Proteoides , Laurus , Nyssa , Cinchoni-dium , Apocynophyllum , Sapotacites , Diospyros , Magnolia , Acer , Sapindus , Cupania , Eugenia , Eucalyptus , Metrosideros , Bauhinia .
I believe that even some species of these genera are the same in both Floras .
It is surely probable that the fruits and seeds of Sheppey were related to the leaves found at Bournemouth and Alum Bay ; and it would be , therefore , undesirable always to propose separate specific names for the related fossils found in these different localities .
Among the plant-fossils of Bournemouth and Alum Bay I also found many leaves which I could not class with existing genera .
There is probability that these partially correspond with the extinct fruit- and seed-genera of Sheppey .
Before I enumerate the genera and species of the Fossil Flora of Sheppey , I have to remark as follows:\#151 ; Amongst the Sheppey fossils are now and then found fragments of the basis of the leaf of a palm , probably of Sabal major .
On such a fragment I found the apothecia of a Sphseria .
Of the Gymnospermae of Sheppey there were found fruits and seeds of the Sequoia Bower-bankii , also fragments of twigs .
The seeds of the Cupressineae and Abietineae had lost their wing-like expansions , which shows that the fruits and seeds of Sheppey were carried some distance in water , consequently their delicate membranous wings were injured and broken off by rubbing .
There are therefore no perfect winged fruits and seeds to be found .
In fact , even the firmer wings of the Acer-fruit have been entirely lost , and it is impossible to determine the species of the Acer-nucules , which remain .
The appearance of the Salisburia seeds is interesting .
They are very remarkable for their sharp , prominent edge .
The easily-determinable leaves of this genus have not as yet been found in the Eocene Flora of Great Britain .
The Agave is indicated by a valve of fruit ; Smilax , of which leaves are not unfrequently found at Bournemouth , is indicated by a berry .
Of Musa , of which only leaves had as yet been found , there are seeds .
Of Amomum , two kinds of fruit have been found .
These have hitherto been mistaken for smaller fruits of the Nipadites .
Of particular interest are the many species of palms .
The fruits and seeds of some , for instance , Sabal major , Trinax Bowerbankii , Ekeis eocenica , Iriartea striata , Livistona eocenica , have been found .
Of the Sabal and Iriartea the leaves are found at Bournemouth .
The Elasis f [ 879.1 On the Fossil Flora of 1 socenica , the most common palm of the Sheppey Flora , is nearly illied to the E. melanococca , and the Livistona eocenica to the L. i ehinensis .
I do not yet know whether the Aroidea seed , which I have placed in oAronium , might be united with the Aroidea leaf of Bournemouth .
On the other hand , I think it is very likely that some of the kinds of i oak fruits correspond with some of the kinds of oak leaves , which are f to be met with at Bournemouth .
Two of the Bournemouth species are i also found in the Miocene Flora , and one of these , Quercus Lonchitis , \gt ; also in other Eocene Floras .
A small nut shows all the characters of the Corylus , which is found in the Miocene Flora .
The absence of the Fagus is very remarkable , as two kinds of leaves , which can only belong to this genus , have been a found in Bournemouth .
Fagus is frequently found in the Miocene M and Post-Tertiary formations , and also in the Cretaceous formation , ( and I believe , therefore , that it may still be found in Sheppey .
The Liquidambar-fruit of Sheppey may belong to the same species as the inflorescence of Liquidambar , which I found amongst the fossils of Bournemouth .
The Laurus-berry , which I have found amongst i ; the Sheppey fruits , is placed by me in Laurus Lalages , the leaves of 1 which have been not only found in Bournemouth , but also in the i Austrian Eocene ( Sotzka , Hearing ) , where they occur associated with c berries .
The occurrence of a species of Hyssa , I think , may be also accepted ( for the Bournemouth strata .
Of the Proteacese , besides Petrophiloides , a seed belonging to the Protese occurs , perhaps corresponding with l the leaf which X have seen among the fossils of Alum Bay .
In Bourne-i mouth and Alum Bay were found the seeds of some other Proteaceaa ; v which are not in Sheppey , as they have delicate wings .
Some of the 0 cones referred by Bowerbanlc to Petrophiloides belong to Sequoia .
The Gamopetalae are represented by many genera , of which almost all f appear also in the Miocene Flora .
The fruit of Cinchonidium of Sheppey is and the leaves of a species of Cinchonidium from Bournemouth may X belong together .
I accept the same for the Apooynophyllum fruit of Sheppey and the corresponding leaf of Bournemouth .
This last h accords in all its characters with A. Reussi , which also appears in the [ \#187 ; fossil Flora of Sagor .
But I have not found up to the present time , in | the Eocene Flora of Great Britain , any leaf belonging to the charac1 teristic genus Strychnos , the seeds of which are met with at Sheppey .
Of the Sapotacese there are two species of seeds , which perhaps cor-l ' respond with two species of Sapotacece leaves of the Bournemouth I Flora .
One of these extends throughout in the Tertiary Flora ; the j| other , on the contrary , seems to be peculiar to the Eocene Flora .
1 Also peculiar to this Flora are two species of Diospyros , which are K common both to Sheppey and Bournemouth .
392 Baron-Ettirigshausen .
[ Nov. 27 , The species of Symplocos is common to Sheppey and Sagor .
In these two localities the pntamen of this species were fonnd .
In corresponding abundance are represented the Dialypetalse .
They are specially characteristic of the Eocene Flora in general , and of the Sheppey Flora in particular .
To the first belong Magnolia eocenica , Eugenia eocenica , Sapindus eocenicus , Metrosideros microcarpa , and Bauhinia primigenia , whose leaves or fruits are to be found associated together in Bournemouth .
To the last belong the genera Meni sperm-acites , Victoria , Thaspidium , Corchorites , Theobroma , Lawsoniaf the species Illicium Apollinis , Nelumbium microcarpum , .
Cucumites Sheppyensis , Cotoneaster Sheppyensis , Prunus prisca and Druidum Amygdalus eocenica , and Sporadum , Podogonium Sheppyense , \amp ; q. Belonging also to other Eocene Floras and to the Miocene Flora we have here only the Dialypetalous plants , Helumbium Buchii , and Eucalyptus oceanica .
Amongst the fruits and seeds of Sheppey we find also some species of herbaceous or tender plants whose leaves would not be preserved in the Tertiary strata .
To these belong the seeds of Solanites elegans , Menispermites abutoides , Cucumites Sheppyensis , the fruits of Thaspidium ovatum , and of the Corchorites species .
In conclusion I desire to express my thanks to the Royal Society !
for the important assistance it has rendered me by the grants from its funds by which I have been enabled to prosecute my investigations in England ; and for personal assistance in this work I desirej to record my indebtedness to Sir Joseph Hooker , Dr. Henry Woodward , Dr. William Carruthers , and Mr. John Starkie Gardner .
The descriptions and illustrations of the species , here enumerated , j will appear in the Monograph now in course of publication by the Palaeontographical Society .
