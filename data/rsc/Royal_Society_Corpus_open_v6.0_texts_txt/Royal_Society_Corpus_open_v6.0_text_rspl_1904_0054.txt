The number of substances which have been shown to possess more or less well-marked anaesthetising properties reaches some hundreds , and hence it is obvious that the action cannot have a different explanation in each case , but rather depends upon some general type of interaction between the anaesthetic and the active part of the cell , which is the cell-protoplasm .
Further , the .
action occurs not only with nerve-cells , but with ciliated and other epithelial cells , with muscle-cells of all types , with bacteria , amoebae , and other unicellular organisms , and with all types of vegetable cells in which activity is suited to experimental demonstration .
In all these varied types of living cell , activity decreases alike with increasing dose of the anaesthetic , and , with sufficient concentration , all sign of life becomes obliterated .
Hence the action of the anaesthetic must be due to some change brought about in the only material which is uniformly present in all these types of cell , that is , the cell-protoplasm .
Accordingly , in briefly reviewing , as an introduction to our experiments , the previous theories of anaesthesia which have been advanced by various observers , we believe we may justly cast aside those which attribute it fundamentally to anything peculiar in the structure or chemical composition of the nerve-cell , or to any alteration in the nutrition of the nervous system , brought about by variations in its blood supply or otherwise .
It is true that cells differ in the degree of their reaction to anaesthetics , but not in kind , and ultimately the metabolic jrrocesses of bacteria are stilled as effectually as are those of the mammalian nerve-cell .
Any such effects as anaemia or hj'peraemia of the brain , which have been alternately described by various observers , must accordingly be only set down as secondary effects , and not as primal y causes of anaesthesia .
Similarly , theories which are based on the peculiarly high content in cholestearin , lecithin , and , fatty derivatives soluble in ether , of the nerve-cell and its processes , cannot furnish an explanation of anaesthesia , 1904 .
] Properties of Solutions of Chloroform in Water , etc. 383 for these substances are not present in demonstrable quantity in by far the greater number of animal and vegetable cells .
Turning to the views of anaesthesia which rest upon an interaction between the anaesthetic and the cell-protoplasm , we find the speculation first thrown out by Claude Bernard* in 1875 , that anaesthesia consists in a semi-coagulation of the substance of the ( nerve ) cell , a coagulation which may not be definite , that is to say , in which the substance can return structurally to its primitive state after elimination of the toxic agent .
Bernard supports his view chiefly by analogy , and instances the stiffening and opacity of skeletal muscle when exposed to chloroform vapour .
A similar view was expressed by Binz , f who stated that sections of cerebral cortex placed in 1-per-cent , solution of hydrochlorate of morphia soon showed a cloudy appearance , and fine granules appeared in the nuclei ; the protoplasm also became granular .
The stage at which the cell-protoplasm was merely cloudy , and not discretely granular , could be recovered from by washing away the morphia , but , when once the granules appeared , they could not be made to disappear again .
Similar results were obtained by exposing cortical nerve-cells to vapour of chloroform , or to solution of chloral hydrate .
Neither Binz nor Bernard showed , however , that there was any precipitation or semi-coagulation at or near the concentrations which correspond to anaesthesia , nor were the optical methods used capable of demonstrating effects upon the protoplasm short of precipitation .
Similar speculations of a general nature regarding the action of toxic agents , as being due to the formation of a loose , easily-dissociated .
compound between the toxic agent and the cell-protoplasm , have been thrown out by various writers , as , for example , Buchheim ( 1856 ) and Schmiedeberg ( 1883 ) .
Demoor 7 has shown that , subsequent to prolonged and deep anaesthesia , the dendrites of nerve-cells acquire moniliform swellings , and has founded on this a mechanical theory , which rests on the view that the swellings observed are due to a retraction of the protoplasm of the dendrites , so that the communication of cell with cell is interrupted .
The swellings described by Demoor have also been observed by Hamilton Wright , S who also found that they became larger , more numerous , and encroach more and more on the dexidritic stems the longer the anaesthesia is kept up .
These effects are of importance as evidence of an interaction between protoplasm and anaesthetic , but the retraction theory of Demoor based # i Lemons sir les Anestlibsiques , ' etc. , 1875 , p. 153 .

[ Apr. 12 on them will not hold in view of more recent work on the fibrillar mode#of communication between cell and cell .
Further , as pointed out above , any adequate view as to how anaesthetics produce their effect must be applicable also to the unicellular organism , and not merely to the nerve-cell , or any colony of cells .
Wright obtained further effects as a result of prolonged anaesthesia , which led him to adopt the view that the action is bio-chemical in character .
He found , for example , that the Nissl 's bodies lost their affinity for basic dyes , such as methylene blue , but that this effect was only temporary , and disappeared as soon as the anaesthesia had passed off .
These changes , however , do not begin to appear immediately the anaesthetic commences to produce its effect , and are rather a signal of the changes produced in the protoplasm in marked degree by the prolonged action of the anaesthetic than an indication of the first reaction between cell-protoplasm and anaesthetic .
Our own attention was first attracted in this direction by witnessing the experiments of Sherrington and Sowton* upon the effects of chloroform on the excised mammalian heart , fed by a current of Ringer 's or Locke 's solution , and through which later a similar current , but containing in addition small amounts of chloroform , could be perfused .
These authors observed that a concentration of chloroform in the Locke solution , amounting to only 1 in 100,000 , produced a marked and unfailing action in diminishing the extent of the cardiac contractions , and further that this effect appeared rapidly after the dilute chloroform solution reached the heart , lasted just as long as the chloroform in this excessively low but yet adequate concentration was passed through , and ceased almost , immediately as soon as the normal Locke 's solution was recurred to , the heart attaining again its normal force .
This effect could be repeated as often as was desired , and there was no cumulative action whatever , that is , no matter how prolonged the passage of the chloroform solution on passing back to the normal Locke 's solution , the chloroform effect rapidly disappeared , and again recovered when the chloroform was once more turned on .
It was this latter effect which suggested the experiments on the chemistry of anaesthesia recorded in this paper .
It was quite obvious that the effect of the chloroform upon the cardiac muscle fibres depended solely upon the concentration ( solution tension , or osmotic pressure ) of the chloroform in the cell for the time being , and not at all upon the total amount of chloroform which had been fed to the heart up to the moment of observation .
This experimental fact suggested the view that the effect upon the * Thompson Yatee , ' Johnston Laboratories Reports , ' vol. 5 , Part 1 , p. 69 .
1904 ] Properties of Solutions of - Water , etc. 385 cell was due to some combination being formed between the protoplasm and the chloroform , and further that this combination was not a stable fixed one , leading to permanent removal of the protoplasmic activity , but an unstable one , which existed only so long as the pressure of the anaesthetic was kept up to a definite level , and gradually dissociated as the level of chloroform pressure was allowed to fall , and as a result left the protoplasm free for a renewal of its metabolic processes\#151 ; to choose a familiar analogy , that the protoplasm of a cell undergoing anaesthetisation entered into a combination with the anaesthetic , similar to that between haemoglobin and oxygen , unstable in character , and only lasting so long as the pressure of the anaesthetic was kept up .
It occurred to us , as protoplasm is built up chemically of proteid , that a certain amount of evidence as to the formation of such an unstable compound might be obtained , in the first instance , by experimenting with proteids .
We accordingly experimented with the proteids of the blood , and have obtained a number of results which together point to the formation of such compounds as are indicated above .
It is our intention to proceed further and study in a similar fashion the effects of chloroform upon various types of living cell , but we here present the work done upon proteids , which appears to us to prove that an easily dissociable compound is formed between proteid and chloroform .

[ Apr. 12 , using chloroform as a preservative for these fluids , and were also described by Formanek , * the bearing of such phenomena upon the question of anaesthesia was not , however , appreciated by these previous 1,3 observers , who had approached the matter from a different standpoint , and as we have in some respects amplified their observations , and in lie1 others have obtained results not quite in accord with theirs , we feel justified in here recording our experiments .
It was observed by E. Salkowski in 1888 that blood could not he preserved by adding chloroform , because it gradually became converted into a thick mass .
In 1891 it was observed by Horbaczewskif that haemoglobin was precipitated from a solution containing it , and kept at a temperature .ii\gt ; of 40\#151 ; 50 ' C. , to which chloroform was added as a preservative .
The subject was investigated more , minutely by Formanekj in 1900 , and this observer found that a solution of haemoglobin kept at Id 50\#151 ; 55 ' C. for some time with chloroform was completely precipitated , ia the filtrate being entirely free from haemoglobin .
w Formanek dried and analysed the precipitate , and from the absence pit of chlorine after fusion with sodium carbonate and potassium nitrate came to the conclusion that the precipitate is not a chloroform com- it pound of haemoglobin .
In our opinion this is not a valid proof , as the chloroform need not be so stably combined with the chloroform as to stand drying at 130 ' C. , and subsequent fusion as employed by Formanek .
The precipitate was dissolved by Formanek after thorough washing to remove the chloroform by the addition of a few drops of sodium carbonate solution , and the solution gave the bands of oxy-haemoglobin , and on treatment with ammonium sulphide reduced haemoglobin .
Formanek also found that blood serum and egg-albumin were precipitated ( when the reaction of the fluid was acid or neutral ) on keeping at a temperature of 50\#151 ; 55 ' C. in presence of chloroform .
From these experiments this observer came to the conclusion that the precipitate with which he was dealing was a mixture of haemoglobin and other proteids thrown out of solution by the chloroform .
It is also stated in this paper that oxy-haemoglobin is only slowly and incompletely precipitated by the action of chloroform at room temperatures .
E. Salkowski , in his later paper , S states that blood kept at a temperature of 40 ' C. for 24\#151 ; 48 hours in presence of chloroform changes to a thick mass , but found that the precipitation of the haemoglobin weis not complete under such circumstances .
Regarding the action of chloroform on serum , he states that serum * * * S * t Zeitsch .

] Properties of Solutions of Chloroform Water , etc. 387 can be preserved in contact with chloroform for years without precipitation at room temperatures , and finds this in agreement with Formanek 's results , who found , in presence of an alkaline reaction , no precipitation of serum by chloroform even at a temperature of 50___55 ' C. Formanek does not state whether his alkaline reaction is the natural alkaline reaction of the serum .
Salkowski also found a precipitating action of chloroform upon solutions of albumose and casein .
Our experiments were conducted with haemoglobin and serum obtained from pig 's blood .
The serum used was obtained from clotted blood and was thoroughly centrifugalised before use .
The haemoglobin was in all cases obtained by centrifugalising the blood corpuscles three times with normal saline , and then laking with distilled water and making up to the same volume as that of the blood taken .
In the case of serum we found that the fluid acquired , with less than 1 per cent , of chloroform ( and greater quantities up to saturation ) , a peculiar opalescent and fluorescent appearance , but remained quite transparent to transmitted light .
On the addition of over 2 per cent , of chloroform , there is a tendency to precipitation even in the cold , and at the end of 24\#151 ; 48 hours there is a slight precipitate present , but the effect is much hastened on placing the mixture in an incubator at 40 ' C. , so that it becomes impossible to determine the maximum solubility of chloroform in serum at body temperature .
Both in obtaining precipitation in the cold and more rapidly at 40 C. in presence of the natural alkaline reaction of the fluid , our results are at variance with those of Form\amp ; nek and Salkowski .
The results were obtained several times in succession .
The marked opalescence in the serum was obtained in preparation of solutions of known concentration in chloroform for purposes of measurement of their vapour pressures , and led us .
to doubt at first whether we were not dealing with a fine emulsion of chloroform in the serum .
Since this point was of vital importance to our experiments on vapour-pressure , we investigated it as completely as possible .
In the first place , examination with the microscope of the opalescent fluid showed no visible globules of chloroform , even with the highest powers .
To make certain of the matter , a current of air from an aspirator was bubbled first through chloroform contained in a Woulff 's bottle , afterwards through a similar bottle containing water , and then , at the same temperature , was sent through a third Woulff 's bottle containing serum .
By this procedure the serum never came in contact with fluid chloroform , nor with air more highly charged with chloroform vapour than corresponded to the saturation of the air in contact with it or passed through it .
There could , hence , be no condensation of chloroform and no means Prof. B. Moore and Mr. H. E. Ptoaf .
[ Apr. 12 by which an emulsion of chloroform , finer even than could he seen with a microscope , could be formed .
Very soon , however , after the chloroform vapour began to pass through , a distinct difference in appearance was observable between the serum and a control placed alongside , and after a time the serum charged with chloroform in this manner was as opalescent as the specimens made in the usual way by shaking with weighed quantities of chloroform , and gave similar results with regard to vapour pressure .
" These results show that the marked opalescence is not due to an emulsion of chloroform , and further that it is not due to precipitation of proteid in the ordinary sense of the word , for no precipitate can be j seen with the microscope in the opalescent fluid .
Further , experiments on the vapour pressure show that the value I of this is a long way from the maximum value , which it must obviously possess if an emulsion was present .
A similar opalescence is obtained on adding to serum other organic liquids which possess anaesthetic properties , thus we have obtained it on saturation of serum with ether , * benzol and xylol , but have not followed the matter up as we have done with chloroform .
In the case of haemoglobin solutions , we have not been able to observe an opalescence , similar to that seen in the case of serum , up to the strength at which precipitation begins .
In order to study where precipitation commences it is necessary to keep the haemoglobin and chloroform constantly stirred , or otherwise before the chloroform has dissolved the lower layer of haemoglobin solution in contact with the liquid chloroform becomes precipitated .
When precautions are taken to prevent this occurring , precipitation is found to take place when about 2 per cent , of chloroform has been added , that , is long before saturation is reached ( vide infra ) .
This precipitation prevents both the determination of the solubility of chloroform in haemoglobin solutions , and the observation of the vapour pressure with high concentrations .
With concentrations of 1 per cent , or under no precipitation whatever was found to occur .
Contrary to Salkowski and Formanek , we found that no raising of the temperature was required to cause precipitation of the haemoglobin ; in fact , with stiong solutions , , the precipitation occurs within a few hours , even in the ice chamber .
With time the precipitation is complete , and the precipitate is insoluble in water or saline , but in dilute sodium caibonate it is easily soluble , and we have found that the solution then shows the spectrum of alkaline haematin and not that of oxy-haemoglobin as was found by Formanek .
* The opalescence with ether is not nearly so well marked , but increases standing , and the solution in time becomes extremely viscid .

] Properties of Solutions of Chloroform in Water , etc. 389 IX , __On the Relative Solubility of Chloroform Water , Saline , Serum , and Haemoglobin Solution .
In jso far as we have been able to discover , no attention has been oaid by previous experimenters to the maximum amount of chloroform \#166 ; apable of solution in the blood or serum as compared with that taken ip by water or saline solution isotonic with blood .
When any reference is made to the matter it has been usually assumed m general principles that the serum or plasma will behave like a .saline solution of equal concentration and dissolve somewhat less chloroform than water.* In other words , that there is no specific action of the proteids or other substances in the plasma .
This supposition we have found experimentally to be entirely erroneous , for both serum and solutions of haemoglobin dissolve much more chloroform than water or normal saline solution .
This fact is of importance in regard to the mode of action , as it definitely points to an interaction between the chloroform and the proteid present .
The presence of fats would of course increase the apparent solubility of chloroform in serum , and hence it is necessary in all cases to use perfectly clear serum , free from suspended fat ; this precaution we have always been careful to observe , and in addition the serum has always been centrifugalised .
In this connection it may be added that the haemoglobin solutions which we have employed could not contain fatty matter , and hence the high solubilities which we have observed could only arise from chemical interaction between the haemoglobin and the chloroform .
Methods for Determining Maximum Solubility .
Three methods have been used in the determination of the maximum solubility of chloroform in the solvents mentioned above , which have given concordant results and shown that the solubility in proteid solution is much higher than in water or saline .
In the first method we have determined the amount of chloroform dissolved by obtaining the product of volume and vapour pressure at low pressure and with a small volume of fluid , so that practically all the chloroform was simply pumped off into the vacuum .
In this method the volume of fluid experimented with is necessarily small , and this gives rise to experimental error of measurement , which is added to by the volume measured being large and pressure small , so that the results are only approximative , yet it is observable that they confirm those obtained by the more accurate methods described below .
The details of the method are described in the succeeding section \gt ; on the relationship between vapour pressure and concentration of * Overton , ' Studien iiber die Narkose , ' p. 93 .

[ Apr. 12 , chloroform , and it need only he mentioned here that we have M obtained solubilities of 0-95 per cent. , in normal saline ( 0-75 per cent. ) w 3-33 per cent , in serum and 4'42 per cent , in whipped blood , by this method . .
The second method employed consists in weighing out known amounts of chloroform into water and serum and haemoglobin solution 1# respectively , and then determining by direct observation that con- 6 ; ii centration in each case at which the chloroform ceased to be dissolved .
This method of observation is made easy in the case of chloroform by the high specific gravity of that fluid , as a result of which on inverting the flask in which the determination is being made even minute globules of undissolved chloroform can be seen falling through the fluid .
The determinations of solubility by this method are made on the j following plan .
Pure chloroform is dropped from a fine capillary pipette into a tared graduated flask of 25 , 50 or 100 c.c. , and carefully weighed to definite amount , corresponding , when the flask has been filled by the solvent under experiment , to a definite percentage of I Bap chloroform .
A series of such flasks is prepared , and immediately after each flask is filled with the desired solvent and either shaken thoroughly by hand until solution is complete , or placed on a rotary shaking machine .
After the lapse of several days , during which time the flasks are never opened and are kept shaken up , it is noticed at what level of concentration the chloroform ceases to be completely dissolved , and so the solubility is determined .
The lower strengths of known value short of saturation , and also the saturated solutions so prepared , were kept and used also for the experiments on vapour pressure at varying concentration described in the next section of this paper .
The following results were obtained by the application of this method at room temperatures , approximately ( 13 ' C. ) , for the percentage by weight dissolved :\#151 ; JFater , 08 per cent , dissolved , 09 per cent , dissolved , 1 per cent , not dissolved completely .
Estimated solubility 095 per cent. Saline Solution ( 075 per cent , sodium chloride in water ) , 07 per cent , dissolved , 0'8 per cent , dissolved , 09 per cent , not dissolved .
Estimated solubility about 083 per cent. Serum , 3 per cent , dissolved , 3-5 per cent , dissolved , 4 per cent , all dissolved save a few small globules .
Haemoglobin Solution or Blood.\#151 ; Over 6 per cent , by weight is taken up when chloroform is shaken with blood or haemoglobin solution of equal strength to the blood , prepared from blood by centrifugalising several times with saline , and subsequent laking with distilled water , and no globules of chloroform can be seen on careful examination with the microscope .
But the solution rapidly changes in colour , an* l a 1904 .
] Properties of Solutions of Chloroform Water , etc. 391 precipitate is thrown out on standing , as above described , which is quite insoluble in water or saline , but easily soluble in dilute sodium carbonate solution , and then gives the spectrum of alkaline h anna tin .
The blood begins to give this precipitate when about 1 -5 per cent , of chloroform has been added at room temperature , but with a lower concentration , and more rapidly when heated to body temperature in the incubator .
Two per cent , of chloroform gives a precipitate in the cold , and on heating to 40 ' C. a red flocculent precipitate leaving a clear colourless fluid above .
The third method for determining the solubility of chloroform in the fluids experimented with consists in shaking up thoroughly for several hours with an excess of chloroform , and then pipetting off and determining the amount of chloroform in the solution .
The difficulty here is a rapid and accurate method of determining the amount of chloroform contained in a measured volume of the given saturated solution .
The procedure finally employed for this purpose , which is also being experimented with as a method for quantitative estimation of chloroform in blood and serum at lower values reaching to the anaesthetising value , was as follows , and led to very accurate results .
A measured volume ( usually 10 c.c. ) of the fluid saturated with chloroform is placed in a flask fitted airtight with a double bored cork , and a stream of hydrogen is aspirated through the solution , the oxygen present in the flask and connections is absorbed by passing through alkaline pyrogallate , and the mixture of hydrogen and chloroform is then burnt by passing over heated palladium asbestos placed in a very short combustion tube .
All the chlorine in the chloroform is thus burnt to hydrochloric acid , and the amount of this absorbed in standard alkali is then estimated , first by back titration against standard acid , and then further checked , either by volumetric titration with standard silver nitrate solution , or by gravimetric determination as silver chloride .
The serum used in these determinations was examined for chloroform emulsion by the microscope , but no undissolved chloroform in suspension was observed .
The precipitate in serum at atmospheric temperature obtained by this method of shaking up with excess of chloroform was very dense , so that the serum became quite opaque .
The results obtained by employing this method were as follows :\#151 ; -Distilled water , dissolved 0'95 per cent. , and serum , dissolved 5-08 per cent. III.\#151 ; On the Vapour Pressure of Chloroform Dissolved in Varying Concentration in Water , Saline , Serum , and Haemoglobin Solutions respectively .
A determination of the vapour pressure of an anaesthetic in solution at varying concentrations in serum , in haemoglobin , or in blood , is of 392 Prof. B. Moore and Mr. H. E. Boaf .
[ Apr. 12 high practical importance , since it is upon the relationship of this vapour pressure to the concentration of the solution that the amount of anaesthetic taken up by the blood circulating through the lungs depends .
It has hitherto been taken for granted that the Dalton-Henry law -can be applied , and that the amount of anaesthetic taken up is strictly proportional to , and varies directly with , the percentage of the vapour of the anaesthetic in the inspired air .
This has never , however , to our knowledge , been experimentally tested , and it seemed to us desirable to attempt such a determination .
We have investigated from this point of view solutions of chloroform in serum , haemoglobin solution ( of equal strength in haemoglobin to the blood from which the haemoglobin was prepared ) and whipped blood , and have contrasted the pressures obtained with those of .solutions in chloroform , in water , and normal saline at equal concentrations .
The vapour pressures have been measured corresponding to concentrations ranging from considerably below the anaesthetising values for \#166 ; chloroform vapour pressure in air ( viz. , 8\#151 ; 10 mm. ) observed by Paul Bert , up to the saturation points in most cases .
Apparatus .
The instrument employed for this purpose was a form of differential densimeter , " which , after passing through many modifications , took the form represented in the accompanying sketch ( fig. 1 ) , which is drawn approximately to a scale of -J .
The two tubes shown are exactly similar , and are graduated in .cubic centimetres and tenths in the upper portion , and in centimetres in the lower and wider portion .
The tubes are connected as shown by means of thick-walled rubber tubing and a glass Y-piece to a stout glass mercury receiver capable of holding more than enough mercury to fill both tubes and their .connections .
The tubes are held in a vertical position by clamps attached to the strong vertical iron bar of a massive retort stand , and each tube is capable of being moved in its clamp vertically up and down for purposes of adjusting the mercury levels .
In order to keep a constant temperature ( in the case of the experiments carried out at body temperature ) the upper portion of .each tube , from about the middle of the wide part to the level of the stopper at the top , was encased in a hot-water jacket of the form shown in detail in fig. 2 , and omitted for clearness from fig. .1 .
It was found convenient to use for the outer glass tubing of this jacket the largest size of a common variety of paraffin-lamp chimney , 1904 .

The two tubes carrying the water in , stopped about 2 cm .
above the upper surface of the rubber cork in each tube , so as to prevent blocking by mercury accidentally run over from the top when the inner tubes were being cleared out at the termination of a measurement .
The outer ends of these two tubes 1904 .
] Properties of Solutions of Chloroform in Water , etc. 395 were attached by means of narrow rubber tubings and a glass Y-tube to a bath of hot water , placed at a higher level , and a screw-down clip on each rubber tube regulated the flow until a thermometer placed in the corresponding hot-water jacket showed the desired temperature .
A constant level of water was kept up automatically in the warm supply bath , and its temperature was regulated so as to lie 2\#151 ; 3 ' above that of the jackets .
The two outflow tubes passed up , as shown , inside the jacket to the level of the ground in glass stopper , and their outside ends were connected by means of rubber tubing to the waste pipe .
In fig. 1 the upper portion of the left-hand tube is shown in section , j and that of the right-hand one in outline .
The ground in stoppers | shown were found , when sealed with mercury , to be much more effectual against minute leakages , which entirely vitiate the results , than any form of tap , and they are also much more convenient for introducing the solutions to be experimented upon , and for cleaning out the apparatus .
Further , since they do not require to be operated between the commencement and termination of each determination of vapour pressure , they are better adapted to their particular purpose than a tap .
In the course of our experiments , we also found it necessary to be able to dilute a solution with more of its solvent without allowing it to come in contact with any appreciable volume of air , and for this purpose found the stopper arrangement most convenient .
The side tube shown at the lower end of each main tube was designed to trap air which was found to slowly leak in through the rubber pressure tubing , when a vacuum was established by lowering the mercury receiver , and for a long time was a source of annoyance .
We subsequently learned that the device had been first introduced by Lord Rayleigh .
At the end of an experiment , any air which has collected is discharged by raising the mercury-holder , opening the screw-clip shown , and allowing enough mercury also to pass through to form a seal in the rubber tubing above the clip .
The mercury-holder was suspended by means of a ring and loop of wire attached around the bulb from a vertical rod , swivel , and hook , possessing a slow screw movement in a block attached to a horizontal rod fixed in a clamp , which could be moved up and down on a heav \ retort stand .
For large movements , the clamp was slid up or down the retort standard , and for fine movements the screw was raised or lowered in its block .
In using the apparatus , the two vertical tubes are first placed at the same level , the mercury-holder is filled with mercury , and , with the two glass stoppers out , the whole apparatus is filled with mercury , the two stoppers are next inserted , enough mercury being left above them to form a seal , and the mercury-holder is then lowered until the two vertical tubes become evacuated .
The receiver is then raised 396 Prof. B. Moore and Mr. H. E. Boaf .
[ Apr. 12 again to the level of the stoppers , and any bubble of air found is discharged .
The apparatus is now ready for an experiment , and , with stoppers out , the levels of mercury are adjusted until there is an equal volume left above the mercury on each side .
A given volume of the solvent ( say 5 c.c. ) is now introduced on the one side ( say left ) , and an equal volume of the solution of chloroform in the same solvent on the other side .
In each case , immediately after the fluid has been introduced , the stopper is inserted , care being taken to prevent any air being included , either as a bubble at the mercury surface , or between the surface of the introduced fluid and the stopper .
To achieve the latter end , we have almost always introduced above the mercury 2 or 3 c.c. more than the required quantity , so that it stood in the neck and slightly above , and then , by easing the stopper and gently j adjusting the level of the mercury-holder , have brought the level of the mercury in the tube to the desired volume mark .
After the solvent on the one side , and the solution of chloroform of the desired strength on the other side , have been successfully introduced in equal volume , and without any bubble of air , the mercury-holder is lowered until a space containing vapour has appeared on each side .
The level of the mercury will be found to be lower on the chloroform side , and it is obvious , the instrument being independent of variations in atmospheric pressure , and the only different factor being the added chloroform on the one side , * that the difference in pressure will give the vapour pressure directly for that strength of chloroform solution at that particular temperature .
There is hence no need to determine pressure due to dissolved gases on the two sides , f or pressure of aqueous vapour , since these balance , and the quickness with which readings can be directly obtained makes it possible to carry out a long series of determinations at varying strengths , without the proteid solutions having time to undergo bacterial change .
Certain precautions have to be taken , however , and corrections made which may here be mentioned:\#151 ; 1 .
Before taking a reading it is essential to move the tubes vertically and adjust the levels until the volumes of the vapour spaces above the upper aqueous solution meniscus in each case are exactly equal , otherwise inequality in pressure of gases pumped off ' on the two sides gives rise to an error , which is greater the smaller the vapour space .
* There will be a small difference in the pressure of water vapour on the two sides , due to there being a stronger solution on the chloroform side , but this is in all cases too minute compared to the pressure of the chloroform vapour to make any appreciable error .
+ Slight differences in dissolved gases gave a disturbance with very dilute chloroform solutions , and this was later obviated by pumping the gases off infra ) .
1904 ] Properties of Solutions of Chloroform Water , etc. 397 2 Before taking a reading , there must he certainty that each fluid is in equilibrium with its vapour space .
This is shown by absence of variation when the apparatus is left at rest .
For rapid and accurate working the mechanical stirring by means of the studs and magnet is indispensible , for even after the lapse of an hour when at rest the solution has not completely discharged its proper amount of chloroform into the vapour space .
When once the control , containing , of course , no chloroform , has been thoroughly stirred it remains constant , and need not be changed at the end of each determination , but can be used throughout an entire experiment .
By vigorous stirring , equilibrium can be attained in 5\#151 ; 10 minutes , and the level does not afterwards change no matter how long stirring and observation be kept up .
This important experimental observation we have taken occasion to verify several times during our experiments .
3 .
For very accurate working , especially with the dilute solutions and low pressures , it is necessary in the case of serum and haemoglobin to pump off the dissolved gases by means of a Topler pump , otherwise these come off unequally from solvent and solution and disturb the results at the low pressures .
The chloroform solutions are then made up from the pumped-out solvent , which also must be used for control and for making the dilutions .
_ 4 .
The temperature must be the same in the jackets surrounding each tube at the time when each reading is taken , and in a series of determinations at varying strength and a constant temperature , that temperature must be closely maintained throughout .
The temperature error is a maximum when the solutions are near saturation , foi t len the variation in vapour pressure per degree is very large ; fortunately here the differences in level under observation are also very large , which diminishes the percentage error arising from small deviations in temperature .
At concentrations away from saturation , the variations arising lorn small differences in temperature approximately obey the gas law , and under the conditions of our experiments become quite negligible .
5 .
A correction must be made in all cases , upon the concentiation o the solution introduced into the tube , for the amount of chloioform pumped off from the solution into the vapour space .
This correction is , of course , larger in the case of the more concentrated solutions v it i high vapour pressures .
This has been done in the experiments of which records are given below , and accounts for the concentrations not being exact peicentages or small fractions of exact percentages .
The amount of chloroform in the vapour space is readily calcu ate from the product of the observed vapour pressure and the volume of the vapour space , and this amount deducted from the quantity contained in the chloroform solution , when it was introduced , gives the necessary 398 Prof. B. Moore and Mr. H. E. Koaf .
[ Apr. 12 datum for calculating the concentration in chloroform of the solution corresponding to the observed vapour pressure in the vapour space .
The ratio of the vapour concentration in the fluid to the concentration in the vapour space gives the coefficient of distribution ( coefficient de portage , Theilungscoefficient ) ; this- should remain constant if the absorption of the chloroform vapour by the liquid were normal and strictly proportional to the vapour pressure , and if it varies it points to a physical or chemical aggregation or compound between the chloroform and the fluid or its constituents ( infra ) .
Method of Reading.\#151 ; The readings were taken with a ' cathetometer , * placed about 4 feet from the tubes , both for greater accuracy in reading than direct measurement would give and to avoid changes in temperature .
Two Methods of Experimentation.\#151 ; We have employed two different methods of experimentation in investigating the variation in vapour pressure with varying concentration .
It is obvious that the concentration of a measured volume of a strong solution introduced into the densimeter may be diminished by pumping off more and more chloroform , by increasing the volume of the vapour space above the solution .
A series of readings of differences in pressure may thus be obtained in which the vapour space on the two sides is kept equal and of known and increasing value throughout the series .
This method we have called the method of " variable vapour space .
" On the other hand , a series of solutions of known and steadily diminishing or increasing concentration may be introduced into the densimeter and measured one after another as to their vapour pressure , in each case with a known fixed volume of vapour space .
As stated above , the concentration at which each vapour pressure in the series is measured is then accurately known .
This method we have called the method of " constant vapour space .
" Method of " Variable Vapour Space."\#151 ; In this method , unless the volume of the tubes of the densimeter is very large , the volume of solution and solvent respectively introduced must be very small .
We have usually taken 4 c.c. on each side , either of a saturated solution or of a very strong solution of known strength , and by altering the levels of the tubes and mercury receiver , have taken a long series of readings , in each case with equal volume of vapour space on each side , at every increasing volume of vapour space , until the difference in pressure became of small value , and the product of volume and vapour pressure became approximately constant , showing that practically all * The instrument used was made by Pye and Co. , of Cambridge , and , by means of a vernier and divided screw-head , read to j{)7i of a millimetre .
We have frequently observed that we were able to take readings within five divisions , that is -jtjj mm. , which is far within the accuracy of other portions of our determinations .

] Properties of Solutions of Chloroform in , etc. 399 he chloroform had been pumped off from the solution .
This constant troduct then gave the necessary datum for calculating the concentration f the original solution introduced into the densimeter , the product of apour pressure and volume at each stage gave the datum for calcu-tting the quantity of chloroform pumped off from the solution , and herefore for deducing the corresponding concentration of solution .
)r also , by plotting vapour pressures as abscissae , and the product if vapour pressure and volume of vapour space as ordinates , the .ratio \#187 ; f vapour pressure and amount of chloroform absorbed at each stage old be shown .
The method of " variable vapour sphas , however , two working disadvantages , which caused us in the end to abandon it and replace it iy the method of " constant vapour space .
" The first objection is that he amount of solution taken is small , hence it is difficult to measure it with accuracy , and to make it equal on the two sides .
The second objection is that at the low concentrations the increase of volume for a small fall in pressure is very large , and hence the determinations become inaccurate , a small error in pressure reading making a large deviation .
The values for high pressures are also inaccurate , but for a different reason ; these readings are taken with small volumes of vapour space , and unless the vapour spaces are accurately equal on the two sides , there is a large disturbance due to inequality in pressure of the previously dissolved gases pumped off on the two sides .
The results , however in the intermediate pressures are accurate and are given below , as they confirm those given by the other method .
Method of 11 Constant Vapour Space."\#151 ; using this method we have always introduced a volume of 5 c.c. of the solvent on one side , and 5 c.c. of a solution of known strength on the other , and have invariably adjusted the levels so that at the temperatures of observation there was a vapour space of exactly 5 c.c. on each side .
In some cases we have started with a saturated solution of chloio orm and have then made dilutions of different percentages of that solution , in the manner described below .
In the later experiments w e founc it , however , more expedient , on account of knowing the exact concentia tion directly , to prepare a solution of known strengtn , sa } 1 pei cent. , and for the more dilute solutions to use various percentage dilutions of this stock solution .
The more concentrated solutions weie obtamec by making up solutions varying by 1 per cent , in strength , ant | per cent , differences were got by mixing these with each ot ler m equal proportions .
For percentages less than OT pei cent. , a 0 1 pei cent , solution was first prepared by making a ten-fold dilution of the 1-per-cent , solution , and this OT-per-cent .
solution was then diluted similarly to the 1-per-cent , solution .

[ Apr. 12 Precautions in Preparing , Preserving , in Unaltered Strength , and Diluting by known Amounts , of the Solutions Used .
In working with the solutions , it is , indispensable that due precaw tions be taken against loss by escape of chloroform into the air during the various manipulations .
If a portion , for example , of a stock solution of known strength be pipetted off for use in the densimeter , and then the stock bottle be merely stoppered , the air space over the portion of solution left in the bottle rapidly becomes charged with chloroform vapour at the expense of the stock solution , and a second sample taken later from the same bottle will be found to be weak and give a wrong result .
The way to guard against this is to fill the bottle with mercury up to the neck immediately after drawing off , and at once stopper up .
Similar devices were employed in all dilutions to complete the process out of contact with air .
The stock solutions were made by direct weighing , by dropping from a fine pipette , into graduated glass-stoppered flasks of 25 , 50 , or 100 c.c. capacity , according to the amount required , immediately filling up to the mark with the particular solvent , and setting at once upon a slowly rotating disc , driven at such a rate that the chloroform globules have just time to fall through the solution each time the flask is inverted .
In this way , a rapid solution is effected , so saving much time .
Further , in certain cases such shaking is indispensable , for a solution of haemoglobin left in contact with even a small amount of chloroform without continuous shaking soon forms a precipitated layer at the bottom .
The stock solutions were kept carefully stoppered , unless at the moment of introducing the pipette to remove a portion for experiment , and then the space within the bottle was always filled to the stopper with mercury in the manner above described .
" W e found much difficulty owing to leakage of chloroform during dilution in the case of the strengths intermediate between the stock strengths , until it occurred to us to make these dilutions in the densimeter itself .
For this purpose we always placed the mercury level at 10 c.c. below the stopper , on the side of the densimeter in which the mixing was to be carried out , then the proper amounts of the two solutions necessary to give the desired strength was drawn up in two graduated pipettes and run into the densimeter tube , the stopper was then inserted , including only a minute bubble of air , and now by thorough agitation of the iron stud through the fluid by means of the electro-magnet a thorough mixing of the two fluids was attained , then by raising the mercury-holder and slightly easing the stopper 5 c.c. were allowed to escape , the mercury level being placed accurately at 5 c.c. A seal of mercury was finally dropped in above the stopper , and so the dilution was effected .

It was thought that such compounds as are shown by the above experiments to be formed between chloroform and serum or haemoglobin solution , might interfere with the carriage of oxygen and carbon-dioxide by the blood .
Accordingly , experiments were carried , out upon serum and haemoglobin solutions to test this point .
A volume of about 500 c.c. of serum or of haemoglobin solution obtained as for the experiments in Section 3 , was completely deprived of gases by exhaustion with a Topler pump at 40 ' C. , afterwards saturation with air or air and carbon-dioxide , was carried out upon two equal volumes contained in similar bottles to one of which a sufficient quantity of chloroform was added to make a 1-per-cent , solution , while the other served as a control .
The gases dissolved in each case were then collected by means of the Topler pump as before , and analysed .
The results throughout were negative , and thus proved a fortiori that at the anaesthetising values chloroform does not depress the solubility of the respiratory gases in the blood .

There was obviously a slight leakage of air , but the figures are : sufficient to show that there is no appreciable change in the solubilities due to the presence of the chloroform .
Summary and Conclusions .
1 .
We believe that the experiments recorded above justify the conclusion that chloroform forms an unstable chemical compound or physical aggregation with the proteids experimented with , and that it is carried in the blood in such a state of combination .
Since proteids build up the protoplasm of living cells , it appears to us probable that chloroform , and other anaesthetics , must form similar combinations with protoplasm , and that anaesthesia is due to the formation of such [ compounds which limit the chemical activities of the protoplasm .
The compounds are unstable , and remain formed only so long as the pressure of the anaesthetic in the solution is maintained .
Such compounds are formed not only by haemoglobin but by serum proteid , and hence the position taken by the anaesthetic in haemoglobin is not that of the respiratory oxygen .
This is further shown by the fact that the oxygen-carrying power of haemoglobin is not interfered with in presence of chloroform .
The effect of chloroform upon various forms of protoplasm will form the subject of future experiments .
The facts upon which we rely as proofs of the formation of a compound or aggregaition between chloroform and seium pioteid oi haemoglobin may be summarised as follows :\#151 ; ( a ) Chloroform has a much higher solubility in serum or haemoglobin solutions than in saline or water .
( b ) Even in dilute solutions at the same pressure the amount of chloroform dissolved in serum or haemoglobin solution is considerably higher than in saline or water .
412 Properties of Solutions of Chloroform .
[ Apr. 12 ( c ) The curve of pressures and concentrations in the case of water and saline is a straight line , while in the case of serum and haemoglobin solution it is a curve , showing association at the higher pressures .
( d ) In the case of serum , chloroform causes a marked opalescence , v and also a slow precipitation at room temperature ( 15 ' C. ) , and at body temperature ( 40 ' C. ) a rapid , though incomplete precipitation , d In the case of haemoglobin , 1 -5\#151 ; 2 per cent , of chloroform causes a change of colour and commencing precipitation at room temperature , tj which becomes almost complete in the thermostat at 40 ' C. , while 5 per cent , and over causes complete precipitation even at 0 ' 0 .
2 .
The relations between chloroform pressure and concentration in solution have been worked out throughout a long range , from.below y the anaesthetising values ( 8-\#151 ; 10 mm. ) to nearly saturation in the case \gt ; i of water , saline , and serum .
Attention may be drawn here to the important practical fact that j with the same percentage of chloroform in the air breathed , serum or haemoglobin , and therefore the blood , will take up much more chloro- : form than would water or saline under equal conditions .
Thus at the q anaesthetising pressure , and at 40 ' C. , the coefficient of distribution in li the case of water and saline is approximately 4*6 , while that of serum is 7*3 ; at room temperature ( 15 ' C. ) these coefficients become 8-8 and 17*3 respectively .
