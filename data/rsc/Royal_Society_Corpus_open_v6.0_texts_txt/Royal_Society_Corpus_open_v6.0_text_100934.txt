An Account of the Aponensian Baths near Padua ; communicated by the foremention 'd Inquisitive Gentleman , Mr. Dodington , in a Letter written to the Publisher from Venice March 18 .
1672 .
SIR , IN the Observations and History of Nature possibly this may not be unworthy the notice .
Five miles from Padua are th waters , called Aponensia , from a town called Aponum , famous in antiquity , and among others frequently mentioned by Livy .
will not doubt , but that Sr. I.F.and D B. two worthy members of the R.Society and who lived long in Padova , have informed them selves most exactly of what ever I shall be able to say on this Sub ject ; however I do not scruple to give you a short relation of it The waters are actually very hot .
Secondly , they are stinking Thirdly , they yield a great deal of very fine salt ; of which th natives serve themselves in their ordinary occasions .
This salt is the thing , I think most considerable there .
It is gathered in th manner : The Natives , after Sun set , stir pieces of wood in th water , and presently the Salt sticks to them , and comes off in small flakes , exceeding white , and very salt .
This never looser its savour .
The people there , with the same water use to wash their wales , to render them whiter then ordinary ; which it doth even whiter than lime .
Such wales conserve their saltness some few days only , and then become insipid , even though they sweat forth a white excrescence in thin and light flakes like niter , many years after .
But that Salt , which is collected from the stones , gravel and earth , by which the rivulets , descending from those Baths , do run , is withour any taste of Salt ; though there be no difference in the form or colour from that which is gathered with the wooden instruments , by me mentioned .
This is the Sum of what I have to say at present of this particular .
If you think the matter tanti , I will send you a more ample description thereof , with my thoughts upon it .
