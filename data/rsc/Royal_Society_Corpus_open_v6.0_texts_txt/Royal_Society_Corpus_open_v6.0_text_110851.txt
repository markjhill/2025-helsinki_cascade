" Remarks on the amalgamation of Silver Ores in Mexico ; with an account of some new combinations of Copper , Oxygen and Chlorine .
" By John Christian Bowring , Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. The process employed in Mexico for amalgamating ores containing sulphurets of silver , and which consists in adding to them a solution of bichloride of copper with chloride of sodium , is explained by Sonneschmidt , Humboldt , and Boussingault , on the supposition that a chloride of silver is formed at the same time that the sulphur combines with the copper .
The author calls in question the truth of this theory , and proposes certain modifications of the process by the employment of a combination of deutoxide of copper with the bichloride , until an oxy-chloride is formed , and then adding finely precipitated copper , by which a salt of a brick-red colour is obtained , insoluble in water , and at a temperature of 200 ?
Fahr. speedily reducing sulphuret of silver to the metallic state .
