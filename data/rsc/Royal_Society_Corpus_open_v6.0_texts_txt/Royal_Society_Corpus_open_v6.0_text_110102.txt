] This communication consists of a table stating the annual variations of 23 of the principal fixed stars , as deduced from Dr. Brinkley 's observations , and those of the Astronomer Royal .
On these -Mr .
Pond remarks , that out of 16 stars observed at Dublin , 13 either indicate a southern deviation , or at least are not inconsistent with it , and that of these 13 , about half indicate a greater deviation than that assigned by Mr. Pond himself .
The other half a less , while the three remaining stars deviate northwards .
Mr. Pond further remarks , that the examination of this table is calculated rather to increase than to diminish scepticism on the subject of the determination of such very small quantities by astronomical observations .
He concludes by disclaiming all intention of placing the subject in a controversial point of view , and by expressing a hope that the difficulty will in a very few years be satisfactorily cleared up .
