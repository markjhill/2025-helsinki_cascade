On the Cause of the Discrepancies observed by Mr. BAILEY with the Cavendish Apparatus for determining the mean density of the Earth .

IN the Fourteenth Volume of the Transactions of the Royal Astronomical Society will be found a full account of the Cavendish apparatus , and of the mode of experimenting followed by Mr. BAILEY .
It will therefore not be necessary for me , in this place , to enter into any detail as to the different parts of the instrument , and the various precautions adopted in order to avoid that singular source of error C currents of air in the torsion box arising from unequal temperature , ' which had been discovered by CAVENDISH .
It will be sufficient for me to state that all the arrangements are of a highly satisfactory kind , and that I am of opinion that no aerial currents could have existed in the torsion box .
The deduction of the mean density of the earth from the observed vibrations of the balls influenced by the torsion force and the attraction of the masses , is founded on a mathematical theory of the motion of the balls given by the Astronomer Royal , Mr. AIRY ; and as this theory is certainly insufficient to account for the discrepancies , it will here be necessary to give a brief sketch of it .
The momentum of attraction of the masses and planks on the torsion rod and balls supposed to be in the zero position , is calculated .
The weights or masses are all represented in grains , and one inch is taken as the unit of length .
The momentum is called E. In deducing it , the portion depending on the attraction of the planks is obtained by supposing the masses of such planks to be collected in their axes .
The moment of inertia is then found and called F. A modulus of attraction k is then kxE assumed , so that F is the impressed angular accelerating force on the rod and balls in the zero position .
The distance from the centre of motion to the centre of the balls is denoted by c , so that , if 0 be the very small arc described , cO is the space described in inches .
Let m2d denote the force of torsion which is known to be proportional to the angle described , supposing the apparatus in a normal state ; or if we suppose it slightly out of order so as to rest at an angle a from the zero position when the masses are removed , m2(O-- ) will denote the force of torsion ; and it may also be conceived that the small force of attraction of the torsion box , &amp;c. is included in this .
The equation for angular motion is then d20 kxEl d+m2(--)= ---(I +nO ) , neglecting 02 , &amp;c. , where n is a constant depending on the distance of the masses from the balls .
Making 2 kxE Making m2---_F n=2 , this equation may be written d20 kxE dt+ ^20 m2a+ F Multiply by i the distance from the centre of motion to the scale =108 inches , and put i=-x , ia=b , then d2x kxE xi d-+t2 + 2X = m2b+ Fin which the masses are in the positive position .
The integral of the equation is m"b kxExi x=-+ x Ex +A cos ( pt+B ) , in which A and B are arbitrary constants depending on initial circumstances .
Let e be the value of x for the ' resting point , ' or mean value of the above , m%2b kxExi e= + FJ 2 When the masses are in the negative position , the only alteration in the equation ( still measuring x the same way ) is in the sign of k ; we have , therefore , for the negative resting point , tm2b kxxi e-et kxExi *-e -F= 2 ' Also T being the time of vibration T= .
1 2Ei T2 Hence k F7r e-e It is then shown , on the hypothesis that k is the same for all substances , and on the law of universal gravitation , that kA=H , a constant depending on known quantities , so that we have..Ei T2 AH.r-e2 Every division of the scale is 6th of an inch , so that if s and s ' be the scale readings for the resting points s=26e and s'=26e ' , T2 A=-XC , whs-se 26HEi where D= 2 and C= r ' 6-2 is called the general constant , which , combined with , gives C thespecialconstant .
The resting points s and s ' are not directly observed , and in strict accordance with the preceding theory , ought to be found thus .
Let a and a ' be the scale readings at the extremities of the arc of vibration , or when ( t-+B=O and r respectively , a =--s26A cos 0=s-+26A , '-=s+26A cos -=s-26A ; .s=-2(+ ) .
We will now deduce a few values of A in strict accordance with the theory frnom the numerical values given by Mr. BAILEY , extracting the data furnished by observation from his tables .

It is to be observed that Mr. AIRY'S theory does not contemplate a difference in the time of vibration in different experiments with the same balls suspended in the same manner , and moreover the effect of resistance of the air is entirely omitted .
2 F2 '219 have therefore selected the preceding consecutive positive and negative experiments which have the times very nearly alike .
The consideration of the resistance of the air might , however , at first sight , seem very necessary .
Since the velocity is very small , we may , according to the conclusions of experimentalists , assume that the resistance varies nearly as the velocity ; dx we ought therefore to introduce the term gTt into the differential equation .
The result shows that the time of vibration is very little affected by the resistance , but the resting point very considerably .
Mr. BAILEY observes four extreme divisions , that is , he watches the motion for three successive vibrations , and then takes the means of successive pairs of extreme divisions .
In this way he has three first means .
He then takes the means of successive pairs of those first means , and thus obtains two second means ; and lastly , he takes the mean of the second means , and this third mean is considered the resting point or place where the torsion rod would be in equilibrium .
This proceeding , as I afterwards shall prove , does in general pretty accurately correct for the resistance of the air , and therefore we may consider BAILY'S 'restdx ing points ' as those which would arise from Mr. ATRY'S theory , supposing the term fT for resistance had been introduced into his investigation .
After this Mr. BAILEY combines his experiments in a very remarkable manner .
Three successive experiments are combined in order to produce what he terms a single result ; and in combining them the means of the positive and negative resting points are taken , and means also of the times of vibration ; for such times it is found are never all exactly alike , and sometimes differ considerably .
In order that the reader may at once see the method pursued , I have made the following extract from the tables:3rd Series.-2-inch lead balls with 1bfilar silk lines ; distance ='177 inch ; upper distance *158 inch ; lower dist. 197 inch .

115 502-998 90-025 220 It is true that results tolerably accordant on the whole are deduced in this manner , but there is no explanation why they should be so combined .
It may be regarded as a mode of combination of the experimental data so arranged as to allow a medium result to emerge , in spite of the immense discrepancies which he could not but have perceived would have appeared had results been deduced from every pair of successive experiments .
I must not here be understood as insinuating any kind of deception on the part of this great experimental philosopher ; on the contrary , he is candid in the extreme .
He frequently refers to the " variation in the time of vibration and the perturbation of the resting points " as things for which he cannot account , and sometimes says , " there must be some disturbing force .
" Also " the force of torsion must be subject to variation .
" With respect to the hypothesis of a change in the torsion force , though I might grant its possibility when a single wire is employed for the suspending line , I cannot grant it when bifilar silk lines are used .
In this case the force of torsion is easily calculated , and there is no r eason why it should at all change .
But when such lines , *177 inch apart , are used , the greatest anomalies occur ; and I am persuaded that if the distance were still further diminished , and the torsion force thereby rendered weaker , the anomalies would be still further increased .
In order to obtain a theory which would account for the anomalies I tried many plans .
One was the integration of the equation of motion ( including resistance ) to terms of the second order , but the corrections thence arising were far too minute to afford any explanation .
Besides the above reason against the alteration of the torsion force , another occurred to me , which was this , were a change in the torsion force the sole cause of the perturbations , the time and resting point ought always to change simultaneously , but this is observed not to be the case .
Examples in abundance will present themselves to any one consulting the tables , in which the time changes , and the resting point remains nearly unaltered , and vice versed .
Jet also was out of the question , in consequence of the extreme precautions used to prevent the intrusion of this sort of disturbance .
At length I determined to try the effect of a supposed magnetic state of the masses and balls , and , as will be seen in the sequel , the hypothesis succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectations .
It is strongly suspected that all bodies are more or less susceptible of the magnetic state , and I think it very probable that what is called the coercive power of a substance , or that power which it possesses of retaining its magnetic state , after the magnetizing power has been withdrawn , for a longer or shorter period , may not only differ for different substances , which we know it does , but for different intensities of magnetization .
Thus , if magnetism be induced by a powerful magnet in a mass of soft iron or lead , the magnetic state will , to all appearance , subside when the magnet is withdrawn , and that very rapidly , perhaps instantaneously .
Now I contend that such may not be the case if the magnetization were very small ; it may require , even in lead , some time to elapse before the very feeble magnetic state wholly subsides .
221 We are sure that some degree of magnetism must be induced in the masses and balls by terrestrial magnetic influence , and then the magnetic systems may be capable of sensibly influencing each other .
Now when balls are magnetized , their action is the same as if there were a small magnet concentric with each ball , and therefore the mutual action of balls on each other is reduced to that of small magnets , the distance of whose centres is great compared with their lengths .
In the case of the earth being one of the magnetic bodies , the distance of the centres may be well considered infinite in comparison with the lengths of the supposed magnets , and therefore magnetic action of the earth upon any body at its surface will not tend to produce any motion of translation , or to increase the weight of such body .
But when two balls at a moderate distance from each other are magnetized , the force producing motion of translation does not vanish , except for certain relative positions of the magnetic axes , and is sometimes positive and sometimes negative ; that is , sometimes attractive and sometimes repulsive .
Imagine then that the masses have remained in the positive position for some hours ( e. g. during the night ) ; the mutual influence of the masses and balls combined with terrestrial influence must have induced a certain very minutely magnetic state in those bodies , and the resulting attraction of the masses and balls is mixed up with the attraction of their mutual gravitation .
Now reverse the masses by turning the plank round the centre of motion through nearly 180 ?
, the action arising from magnetism , if we suppose the masses capable of preserving ttleir minutely magnetic state , will now probably be one of repulsion , though perhaps not precisely equal in amount to the magnetic attraction in the positive position .
This repulsion will also be mixed up with the action of mutual gravitation .
Now , when we reflect that the attraction arising from gravitation between a mass and one of the balls is exceedingly minute ( about the tenth of a grain ) , it is clear that an almost inconceivably feeble magnetic state may be the cause of great perturbations .
I now proceed to apply mathematics to these views .
The term depending on the kE cM action of gravitation being F i.px , let that depending on magnetic action be r i.4x , then the differential equation of motion will be d2x dx kEi kMi dt + dt+m2(a - ) -P+ F +--X ; and if we suppose px and A , x expanded to the first power of x , we may write px= 1 +ax , x-r= 1 +cx ; kEia kMic and making m2--E_kc 2 , e have d2xc dox ki(E M ) we have 4dt-++ f +- ... .
( 1 .
) Let P be the value of x for the resting point or position of equilibrium , then 2p =m2b.+ ki(E + M ) ( Pi ... ... ... ... ... ( 2 .
) 222 and the equation of motion may be written d2x dx dt2 +S4 + -B2(--P)=0 O The integral of this equation is x=P+se 2 cosyt+ sinyt , ... ( 3 ) where y2=.2-.g 2 da X.,2 and sin yt ( 4 .
) ye2 Hence the time of vibration _=y To determine the coefficients from observation .
Let A , B , C be the extreme divisions observed , and let e 2y=u .
Then A=P+sl B==P-u , C=P+U2 , AC-B2 B-C " P--A+C-2B ' --A Now in all cases it is observed that B-C and B-A do not greatly differ , so that u=l -v , where v is a small quantity , eT 2 2v or e2=_ +v , .

I think it is to be regretted that in Mr. BAILY 's experiments he should have so seldom mentioned in what position the masses had been left during the night ; this last example is one of the cases in which he distinctly mentions that the masses had remained in the positive position during the night , and the first observation next morning was taken from the spontaneous motion of the rod .
Accordingly we find the magnetic action positive , and diminishing subsequently , as we would have been led to expect from the circumstances .
The following is an instance in which the magnetic acti on is negative , and I have placed in juxtaposition the gravitating energy .

-'36808 226 The two last examples are taken from the 25th series , 2-inch lead balls with single copper wire , diam. *0219 inchl ; and what is very remarkable is , that the time of vibration remains throughout nearly the same , 253 seconds .
And since ore kEia kMic T2 m2 -F~ kMic this circumstance shows two things , first that the term pmust be exceedingly snlall , and therefo re c very small ; and also that m2 , and therefore the force of torsion is not sensibly changed .
I have therefore , I conceive , satisfactorily shown that the masses and balls do exert influences on each other independent of the action of gravitation , and that such influences are of a very fluctuating nature , and the action arising from them is either positive or negative ; and changes as to sign when the masses are turned round a vertical axis through 180 ?
, or thereabouts .
Moreover , that such action may either fall short of that arising from gravitation , or exceed it many times .
It is inconceivable that this disturbing force can arise from anything but magnetic influence , and in this we must remember there are three distinct modifying causes at work , -first , terrestrial influence ; second , mutual influence of masses and balls ; and third , the alternate motion of the masses changing from one position to the other .
I am of opinion that ordinary magnetic influence is inadequate to the explanation of the motions , or rather of the disturbing force demonstrated to have an existence , and that , as all the substances used are such as are classed by Dr. FARADAY amongst the diamagnetic , that new magnetic condition discovered by this illustrious experimentalist is also greatly concerned as a cause .
It will probably be found that both species of magnetism combine in producing such very extraordinary results .
The circumstance of the numbers proportional to the gravitating influence not exactly agreeing is easily explained .
The simple condition M+M'=0 , which we have assumed , is of course not accurate , and the wonder is that it answers so well .
But we now come to the question how future experiments with the torsion balance are to be conducted so as to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to the mean density A. It has occurred to me that , instead of using diamagnetic substances , we should have hard iron balls possessing the ordinary magnetic state in sufficient intensity to render their magnetic effect sensible , so that we may with precision ascertain the magnetic axes of each iron mass and ball .
Suppose the balls placed on the rod so that their magnetic axes shall be in the direction of the rod and therefore horizontal .
Let the rod be suspended in the magnetic meridian , and let the masses be placed with their magnetic axes vertical , and centres in the same horizontal plane with those of the balls .
The contiguous masses and balls would exert no magnetic force on each other perpendicular to the length of the rod , and the resolvent of magnetic force of a further mass on a nearer ball , or a further ball on a nearer mass per2 G2 227 pendicular to the rod , would be exceeding small , and might possibly by some contrivance be altogether counteracted .
Under such an arrangement the only effective force would be that of gravitation .
I would also do away with the planks , support the masses on square blocks of wood , and transport them from the positive and negative positions by means of wooden train-roads parallel to the torsion box , so that all motion round an axis might be avoided .
It has also struck me that by suspending the rod by means of a single silk thread having little or no power of torsion , and by having very delicate hydrometers at each end of the torsion rod , the stems of which are attached to very fine hairs or silken threads passing over small fixed pulleys in the horizontal plane of the torsion rod , the horizontal portions of the hairs or threads being affixed to the ends of the torsion rod , the experiments might be rendered purely statical .
Supposing the hydrometers just floating in their position of equilibrium when the rod is in its zero position , and those hydrometers on contrary sides of the torsion rod opposed to the masses , it is clear that when the rod moves towards the masses , and raises the hydrometers above their position of equilibrium , that the tensions of the threads would increase , and vary as the angle through which the torsion rod has moved .
These forces of tension would ultimately be in equilibrium with the gravitating action , and by observing this position of equilibrium the force of tension and therefore that of gravitation would become known .
There may be practical objections to this arrangement , but I am of opinion that by using proper substances for the stems , &amp;c. of the hydrometers , and proper care in the manufacture of the small pulleys , they might be overcome .
After my views were fully matured I had some correspondence with Sir JOHN HERSCHEL , to whom I in part detailed them , and with the kindness and urbanity which so eminently distinguish him , he undertook to lay my communication before the Royal Society : in one of his letters he thus expresses himself .
" Very many years ago , immediately after the publication of a joint paper by Mr. BABBAGE and myself on the magnetic action of revolving copper discs , &amp;c. on magnets , a course of experiments suggested itself to me which , for want of a proper locale where I could establish an apparatus of considerable dimension and great delicacy out of the way of currents of air , I did not execute , a thing I now much regret .
" The plan of these experiments was to attach to the two arms of a long torsion balance two magnets , a stronger and a somewhat weaker ; thus A being the weaker and B the stronger , A horizontal and B so inA\ clined as precisely to counteract and destroy the directive power of A ( by forming ' neutral couples ' ) , the line AB being in the magnetic meridian , which would always be practicable as the superior power of B 228 might be weakened in any arbitrary degree by inclining it , or other modes of making the combination astatic , as for example by placing A and B ( supposed equal or very nearly so ) horizontal , and adding a small adjustable correcting magnet at nScAB C , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. " The whole being then enclosed _ in a case , it was proposed to bring --t---------near to both A and B ( and on oppoC site sides ) masses of various metals and other substances not usually considered as magnetic , with a view to increase by leverage and so place in evidence any very minute magnetic forces which might reside in the substances used .
" S I think that such a course of experiments would not now be without its interest , and that the magnetic and diamagnetic powers of FARADAY would be exhibited in such a course perhaps under new and remarkable light .
" I have now only further to add , that I think it would very much conduce to our knowledge of the subject to make a new series of experiments with the Cavendish apparatus as used by Mr. BAILEY , but in this manner:-Carefully stating how the masses of balls were disposed previously to the commencement of the experiments , and continuing those experiments without interruption day and night by several observers relieving each other through three or four successive days and nights , with a view to ascertaining the periodicity , &amp;c. of the magnetic or diamagnetic forces .
Of course when real magnets are attached to the rod , as I have advised when the object of investigation is the earth 's mean density , it would be necessary to render the torsion rod astatic by Sir JOHN HERSCHEL'S ingenious device , which , as he states , was contrived before he had had any knowledge of M. NOBILI'S astatic combination of needles .
