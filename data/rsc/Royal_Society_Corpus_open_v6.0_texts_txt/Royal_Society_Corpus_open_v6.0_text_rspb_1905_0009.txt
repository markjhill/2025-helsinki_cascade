) Although so much valuable work has been done upon the physiological action of Cobra-venom by Fraser , Calmette , Elliot and others , * so far no observations of its effects upon the metabolism have been recorded .
While its peculiarly selective action on the central nervous system would seem to suggest the absence of any marked general action , the demonstration afforded by Elliot 's work of its influence and the way in which peripheral nerve mechanism may be attacked , and of its interference with respiration , and the direct local action on the tissues into which it is injected , seem to indicate that its toxic action may extend to protoplasm generally and that it may thus lead to modification of the proteid metabolism , whether in the direction of altering the rate of proteid metabolism or of modifying the synthetic processes in the liver by which urea is elaborated , as do the toxins of certain micro-organisms .
I have to thank Sir Thomas R. Eraser for his kindness in giving me the Cobra-venom ; and also to thank Dr. jSToel Paton for much valuable assistance in this investigation .
y 5J i\#174 ; General Plan of Investigation and Methods .
Dogs were used for this investigation .
Before each experiment they were fed for some days on a fixed diet of oatmeal porridge and milk in order to establish nitrogenous equilibrium .
The urine was collected by keeping the animal in a cage with a sloping bottom made of zinc under which a suitable vessel was placed .
The floor was kept scrupulously clean , and faeces were removed as soon as possible after they were passed .
The urine was collected daily at 10 a.m. When the animal came into nitrogenous equilibrium , sub-lethal and in some cases lethal doses of Cobra-venom were injected subcutaneously .
Urine.\#151 ; The reaction and specific gravity were taken .
The quantity collected was noted and the urine diluted to a convenient volume .
The amounts of the following ingredients were determined by the methods Is ; i * See Fairer : 'Thanatophidia of India ' ; Brunton and Fairer , 'Roy .

167 enumerated , duplicate analyses were made in all cases and the mean of these taken:\#151 ; 1 .
Total nitrogen by Argutinsky 's modification of Kjeldahl 's method .
2 .
Nitrogen in urea by Bohland 's method by precipitating with phospho-tungstic ( Merck 's ) and hydrochloric acids .
3 .
Nitrogen of ammonia by Schlossing 's method .
4 .
Nitrogen not in urea ( non-urea nitrogen ) was calculated by difference .
5 .
Nitrogen in purin bodies by Kruger and Wulff 's method.* 6 .
Phosphoric acid as P205 by titrating with uranium nitrate .
7 .
The percentages of nitrogen in urea , not in urea ( non-urea nitrogen ) , in ammonia , in purin bodies , in other compounds were calculated in terms of total nitrogen . ?
8 .
The percentages of P205 were calculated in terms of total nitrogen .
Averages of the figures before and after the injections were determined .
Albumin was tested for by cold nitric acid and by heat and acetic acid .
Some of the experiments were rendered valueless by the early development of an abscess at the seat of inoculation , but the following were carried on , without disturbance from such accidents .
In all the experiments no marked symptoms were produced .
In some cases after injection the dog lay very quiet for a few hours .
In a few there was a local swelling observed next day , but it soon disappeared .
Experiment 1 .
For this experiment a retriever weighing 18 kilogrammes was used .
The dog was kept in its cage for two or three days before the examination of the urine was begun , so that it might get accustomed to its diet and nitrogenous equilibrium be established .
Food Analyses .
Analyses of the food given to the dog showed the amount of nitrogen to be:\#151 ; Daily diet : 500 c.c. milk ... ... ... ... . .
= 1-83 grammes nitrogen 200 grammes oatmeal ... ... = 4'30 " Total intake of nitrogen per diem ... = 6*13 " Analyses of the urine were begun on November 16 , 1903 , and on the 19th , at 4 p.m. , 1*25 milligrammes Cobra-venom dissolved in 0*5 c.c. sterilised normal saline solution was injected subcutaneously in the side .

For this experiment a collie , weighing 17 kilogrammes , was used .
The same precautions were taken and the same amount of food given .
The analyses of the urine were begun on March 22 , 1904 , and on the 26th 5 milligrammes Cobra venom in 0*5 c.c. sterilised normal saline solution were injected subcutaneously in the side at 11 a.m. A few hours after the injection the dog vomited , but there was no other symptom .

42 In two experiments a rise , in one no change , and in one a fall .
The variations in the P305 do not correspond to the changes in the purin bodies .
Conclusions .
1 .
Practically no change in rate of proteid metabolism was induced by the administration , in spite of well marked local reaction .
178 Influence of Cobra-venom on the Proteid Metabolism .
2 .
A slight decrease in the proportion of urea nitrogen , quite insignificant compared with that produced by diphtheria toxine and various drugs , was observed .
3 .
A slight rise in the proportion of ammonia nitrogen occurred .
4 .
There was a slight rise in the proportion of nitrogen in purin bodies .
5 .
The nitrogen in other compounds showed no constant change .
6 .
The P205 excreted showed no constant change , but in two experiments there was a slight rise .
The change produced in the proteid metabolism is , therefore , small , and such as it is , being in the directions , of decreased elaboration of urea and increase in the proportion of nitrogen excreted as ammonia , it seems to indicate a slight toxic action on the hepatic metabolism rather than a general action on the proteid changes ; and tends to confirm the view that the poison acts chiefly upon the nervous system .
