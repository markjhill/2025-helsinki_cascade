Dr. Geuther* found that sodium-alcohol ( C4 } )02 when gently warmed in a stream of carbonic oxide , yielded not pre* Annalen der Chet .

pionate of soda , but formiate of soda , with evolution of olefiant gas .
The reaction , accordingly , might be represented thus : Na 02 4-C202= Na 02 4+ C 114 and would consist in the replacement of C4 H4 by C2 0 .
On inspection of Dr. Geuther 's paper it appeared that the above reaction was not established with sufficient certainty .
The presence of C4 H4 as a gaseous product was not satisfactorily proved by direct experiment , but inferred from the production of formiate of soda .
Berthelot has shown that carbonic oxide is capable of uniting with the hydrated alkalies , so as to form alkaline formiates .
Also , it is extremely difficult , and perhaps impossible , to obtain sodiumalcohol free from hydrate of soda .
It seemed , therefore , not unreasonable to suspect that Dr. Geuther 's formiate came from hydrate of soda accompanying the sodium-alcohol employed in his experiments .
The investigation about to be described shows that such was really the case .
Sodium-alcohol , freshly prepared from sodium and anhydrous alcohol , was introduced into small glass bulbs , and hermetically sealed therein .
One of the bulbs , containing '406 gramme of crystallized sodium-alcohol , was placed in a flask of 155 cubic centimetres ' capacity .
The neck of the flask was contracted before the blowpipe .
Carbonic oxide , after slow passage through potash solution , and then through sulphuric acid , was next made to fill the flask by displacement .
Finally , the contracted neck of the flask was closed by fusion , and thus the bulb containing sodiumalcohol was enclosed in an atmosphere of pure oxide of carbon .
By agitation the enclosed bulb was broken , and its contents came freely in contact with the carbonic oxide contained in the flask .
Particular attention was paid during this stage of the process , and the fused sodium-alcohol was seen flowing over the inner surface of the flask .
After a digestion in the water-bath lasting for more than four hours , the flask was opened under mercury , when a slight contraction was observed in the volume of its gaseous contents .
This contraction , amounting to about one-fifth of the entire contents , was due no doubt partly to absorption of carbonic oxide by traces of hydrate of soda , and partly to the difference between the temperature at the time of sealing before the blowpipe , and that at the time of opening under mercury .
The following are the particulars of an examination of the gas contained in the flask after the four hours ' digestion at 100 ?
C. In order to remove any alcohol vapour , the gas was agitated with about one-fifth of its volume of boiled distilled water , when it underwent very little diminution in volume-a circumstance , which shows that no volatile liquid capable of absorption by water had been generated during the reaction .
Some of the washed gas was then treated with a potash bullet and with pyrogallic acid , in order to remove any traces of carbonic acid and oxygen .
The amount of these gases present was very trifling , as the readings show : Volume of gas taken ( corrected ( dry ) at 0 ?

300 Comparison of the analysis with these numbers will show that the gas was pure oxide of carbon .
Furthermore , if we assume that the trifling departure from the theoretical quantities for pure oxide of carbon was due to the presence of olefiant gas , and if we calculate how much olefiant gas would be required , we obtain a negative value for the quantity of olefiant gas from one equation , and a positive one from the other equation , viz.:By employing for data the original volume and the carbonic acid generated , the value of C , H4 is negative .
Vol. of C4 H4= vol. of CO2 -original vol. =-0 '82 per cent. By employing for data the original volume and the contraction , the value of C4 H4 becomes positive .
Vol. of C4 H4-I contraction-- ?
original vol.= l'19 per cent. This want of conformity shows that C4 HI4 will not satisfy the conditions of the case , and may be regarded as excluding the supposition that a trace even of C4 H , was present in the gas examined .
When it is considered that on Dr. Geuther 's hypothesis every volume of carbonic acid absorbed should be replaced by an equal volume of olefiant gas , and when it is borne in mind that sodiumalcohol and carbonic oxide must have been less perfectly exposed to mutual action in Dr. Geuther 's experiment than in the one just described , I think the conclusion cannot be avoided , that that experimenter 's formic acid came not from sodium-alcohol , but from hydrate of soda .
In a previous experiment I failed to obtain propionic acid on exposing at 100 ?
C. carbonic oxide along with sodium-alcohol , and in so far my result agrees with that of Dr. Geuther .
To resume : at 100 ?
C. sodium-alcohol is without action on carbonic oxide .
This research was made in the laboratory of Prof. Bunsen .
