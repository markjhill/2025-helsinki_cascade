I. MAGNETIC OBSEnVATIONS .
Throughout the past year the have rked in satisfactory manner , and the usual determinalions of the scale values of all the hnents were made in January Iast .
Owing to the gradual secular change of Declination tlJe distance between the dots of light upon the cylinder of the magnetometer had become too small for satisfactory registration , and in consequence ib Report of the Kew Committee .
was found necef ; sary to -adjust the instrument by altering slightly the inclination of the attached to the magnet .
The values of the ordinates of the different photographic curves determined then were as follows:\mdash ; Declination : 1 inch .
1 cm .

With to netic disturbances , no very movements have been registered during the year .
The principal oscillation however , were recorded 011 the November 2 to 6 , lS86 ; uary 1 and 14 , April 5 to 7 , August 2 , and September 26 and 27 , 1887 .
Much interest was the curve for February , which registered the occurl.encs of an earthquake .
In Februaly last new adjusting screws were fitted to one of the microscopes attached to the Kew dip-circle No. 33 .
Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various data have been supplied to Professor Mascart , Professol .
Adams , Dr. Atkinson , Professor Schering , Dr. Bijckevorsel , and Messrs. Archbutt and Stanley .
Professors Rucker and Thorpe visited the Observatory in last , and made a series of base ations , priol .
to their departnre for Ireland to finish their magnetic survey of the British Isles , which was commenced in 1883 .
On returning to England a further series of observations were made at Kew in October in order to complete the survey .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been made as usual , and the results are given in the tables Appendix I of this Report .
The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations made during the year:\mdash ; Determinations of Horizontal Intensity . . . . . . . .

The magnetograph curves made use of in the preparation of tables of diurnal ' of ] ination ( see Appcndix , Table III ) have been from the original photographs by means of an eidograph kindly lent by Captain W. J. L. Wharton , apher .
ctions.\mdash ; At the request of Professor Balfour Stewart , F.R.S. , copies of the Kew declination disturbances for years ether with the daily wind values for the to 1869 , have been made and to him ; the Rev. S. J. has also received copies of the records of cerain selected days of netic disbUl.bance for 1886 .
iErnption.\mdash ; In May last , at the request of the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society , a memorandum was prepared for that body on the netic effects recorded at the various observatories over the globe which occurred at the time of the explosion of August 27 , 1883 , in the Straits of Sunda .
Stations.\mdash ; A list of all knoWll mnetic stations has been prepared jointly GeneraI Sir J. H. Lef and the intendent for publication by the Committee of the British Association 011 agnetic reductions , and will be published in the Annual Reporb for the current year .
It references to all localities on the of the gloho where contintlous observations of terrestrial magnetism have becll made for periods of at least one month in duration , and gives , ether with the geographical position of the stations , references to the publications wbcre the results of such observations to be found , as vcll as the names of the ities , whenever these could be ascertained .
outh }\mdash ; At the request of Secretary of the Royal Cornwall Plytchnic Society , the ications for the graphs supplied to the Falmouth Observatory last year , which were drawn up by .
Whipple , have been revised and with trations in the lleport of that Society for 1886 .
Sectionol .\mdash ; In addition to the sectional lines for the purpose of plotting down magnetic observations on the international scale , as suggested by Sir J. H.

2182 In compliance with a request made by the Meteorolo , Council to the Committee , Mr. Whipple visited and inspected his vacation the Observatories at Falmouth and Valencia , and the Anemograph at ountjoy Barracks , Dublin .
Mr. Baker also visited the Aberdeen and Stonyhurst Observatories for the purpose of inspection .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteoroIogical results have been regularly forwarded to , and published by The Times ' and Torquay Direcbory .
' Data have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the editor of 'Symons 's Mouthly Meteorological Magazine , ' the Secretary of the Institnte of Mining ngineers , Captaim Abney , Messrs. Gwilliam , Rowland , and others .
The cost of hese abstracts is borne by the recipients .
The standard barometel .
( Adie 657 ) was fixed in the raph room adjacent to the barograph , and read five times daily at observation hours , in order to compare its indications with those of the standard barometer in another parb of the building .
Rep ort of the Kew nittee .
2 ] 5 Rendings were continuously made from January 1 to July last , and are now under discussion .
Turf has been laid down under the screen of the bhermograph with a view to avoiding effects of radiation as much as possible .
use of meteorological self-recording instruments having been partially discontinued at Armagh , Mr. Whipple dismouuted and packed the raph and raph , and they have been returned for to the ograph.\mdash ; The new ladrant electrometer , constructed on Mr. de la Rue 's principle , with Professor Cliftoll'S improvements , together with a of silver battery of 60 cells , for the purpose of main .
the potential of the quadrants at a certain point , gave great satisfaction during the year , and was found be a marked improvement upon the older form of the instrument .
On Setemb 2 , a wind , a part of the instrnment was accidentally sct on fire by the gas-burner , and the apparatus narl.owly escaped destruction .
Before -starting the strument it is proposed to make some minor alterations , suggested by experience , in the recording appara- tus , \amp ; c. The portable Thomson electrometer ( White No. 53 ) having been put in ough order , has been lent , in accordance with instructions received from the Meteorological Council , to the Hon. Ralph Abercromby , for the purpose of ations on the Peak of Teneriffe .
Abercromby visited Observatory for the pose of familiarlslng himself with the use of the instrument , the scale value having previously been redetermined , by the kinduess of the Chair , at his laboratory Portland Place .

Old Solar Observations.\mdash ; The library of the Observatory has received a from Wm. J. Davies , Esq. , of a MS .
volume of sunspot observations made at Edmonton , Middlesex , from August , 1819 , to March , 1823 .
It is intended to enumerate the spots after the method , so as to carr .
the Observatory catalogue of the new oo.roups of sun-spots bttck to 1819 .
Solar the request of the Chairmall , the MS .
sun-spot measurements and reductions from February , 1862 , to December , 1863 , together with the tables for computing the spotted positions , as well as the Kew working catalogues from 1864 to 1872 , have been forwarded to Mr. A. L. Soper for ths purpose of further discussion .

EXPERIMENTAL WORK .
Photo-nephograph.\mdash ; The cameras used in cloud photography having been put in order , and had new adjustable rapid shutters fitted , were again brought into use , and by equest of the Counoil 24 sets of comprising 90 negatives were aken on 14 days , chief attention being directed to the photographing high cirrus clouds .
Prints of all the pictures have been made on cyanotype paper , which together with the observational data have been transferred to the Office for the reduction and computation of cloud heights and velocities , Professor Stokes 's cloud projection apparatus having also been transferred there for the purpose .
SolarRadiation.\mdash ; The observations of the black bulb thermometers in vacuo made during 1886 were reduced and discussed , and the results found to be no more satisfactory than those obtained in previous years , the in all of the instruments having detel.iorated , and their readings having become lowered during the time they were under observation , whilst the readings differed considerably amongst themselves .
The Chairman having undertaken to submit the tubes to a lengbhy exhaustion , three instruments were fitted with new jackets and sealed on to the -pump in his laboratory .
They were there exhausted almost ] , the atmospheric pressure being reduced to and maintained at about from April to the end of September .
On October 1st they were removed the ]aboratory and replaced on the stand at the Observatory , having been read daily ever since .
Large differences are still found to exist in the readings of the similar and similarly placed instruments .
Pendulum periments.\mdash ; The Indian Pendulum Apparatus , returned from the United States by Professor Pierce , put up in the pendulum room specially for its accommodation in the South Hall Report of th of the Observatory , and tain pnary g made in the presence of both Gencral Walker and Colonel , R.E. , sufficed to show that the appal'atus had not any material since it left Kew in 1881 .
It however , fouud hat the vacuum chamber had received such uctural in transit as ' it ] of exhaustion to a sufficienlly high make the observations comparable with those previously made by Captains Basevi and Heaviside .
It lvas to the makcr , Mr. Adie , of iondon , for , and has reccntly been crccted in its place , and found in a very satisfactory condition , so that the preliminary observations may now be -commenced .
By the of Mr. W. H. Prcece , F.R.S. , the were favoured the loan of a for use ing the coincidences .
proved that it was unnecessary , and the apparatus has since been to the Post Office .
At the stion of Colonel Heaviside , raphs of the invariable obtained on their removal from their cases after travelling , order that a memorandum might be of their figure and shape on their retur.n to the Ke Observatory .
The following instruments have been purchased on commission and their constants determined:\mdash ; An lnclinometer the Tokio University , Japan .

232 6 Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated , and supplied to 4 societies and individuals during the year .
There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification , 21 Barometers , 462 Thermometers , 2 Hydrometers , and 10 Sextants .
The Committee , after considering question of certifyin the various and numerous classes of instruments on the hydrometer principle , have aathorised the Superintendent of the tory to refuse to verify any instruments except such as either indicate specffic directly or whose indications bear a known and well-defined relation to specific gravities .
Several patterns of range-finders , for use both at sea and on shore , have also been tested ; two additional movable adjustable collimators with scales having been fitted to the testing apparatus , to enable it to be used for this purpose .
Report of the Kew Committee .
AnerScales.\mdash ; The Commitbee have also had their attention called to the fact that several scales are in use for graduating the scales of heights upon the dials of aneroids .
Upon tion t ) Committee recommend as desirable the employment of Sir G. B. Airy 's , published in 1867 , and the equivalent metric scale , all cases where possible .
Two sensitive aneroids with Bourdoll tubes substituted for the ordinnry corrngated vacuum boxes , constructed by MM .
Richard , Freres , of Paris , have been examined for constancy at the request of the Meteorological Council .
It was found , however , that the metal of the tubes underwent similar to those experienced by the usual neroid boxes , the instruments were there ) fore liable to the same erl'ors as the common aneroid .
A Beckley was obtained , fitted with a Stonyhurst dis , and , after due trial , sent to the Mauritius , where an opportunity will be aflorded of noting the of the improved instrument during tropical rains .
Hygrometers.\mdash ; Dr. Doberck , bhc Director of the Hong Kong Observatory , having led a Royal Society grant for the purpose of -calculating Hygrometric tables , Mr. Whipple procured and forwarded to him examples of , Crova 's , and Dines ' instruments , after making preliminary observations at Kew .
Hot Springs.\mdash ; Mr. G. J. Symons , F.R.S. , having received a rant from the Government Fund of the Royal Society , the purpose of the temperatures of certain hot springs in the South of France and the Pyrenees , had a number of specially prepared thermometers carefully verified at the Observatory , both before and after he had made use of them abroad .
Anemometer Constants.\mdash ; At the request of Colonel Knight , F.R. Met .
Soc. , a number of comparisons with the standard Anemometer were made of a small Robinson 's Anemometer he had constructed , having cups fitted to arms of variable \ldquo ; and the moving parts provided with friction l'ollers .
Anemographs.\mdash ; Mr. Whipple has , at the request of the Imperial Chinese toms , supel.intended the construction of a new Beckley Anemograph for use at Formosa , as well as a similar instrument for Dr. A. S. Viegas , of the Coimbra Observatory , and two smaller instruments for the MeteoroIogical Council .
Telescopes.\mdash ; By the kindness of the Astronomer Royal the Kew Observatory has been favoured with descriptiollS of the tests applied to Navy telescopes supplied by contractors to H.M. Service , and also with descriptions of the apparatus employed at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , for applying the tests .
A standard Admiralty telescope has been purchased , and the necessary appliances are now being constructed , with the view of enabling Report of the Committee .
the Committee to apply similar tests to telescopes submitted to them for verification by opticians and others .
VI .
RATING OF CHES .
The arrangements for rating watches mentioned in prsvious Reports have been carried on during the year with continued success , and up to the present lS44 watches have been examined and reported upon .
510 entrics of watches were made as contrasted with 490 the corresponding period of last year .
They were sent for testing in the following classes:\mdash ; For class , 463 ; class ; and class , 22 .
Of these 1/ 4 failed to gain any certificate ; 19 passed in , 21 in 296 in , and 13 of the latter obtained the highest possible form of certificate , the class A especially good .
In Appendix III will be found statements giving the results of trial of the 26 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks the year , ths premier position being with 8 marks a keyless , double-roller , going-barrel watch , submitted by Jos .
hite , Earlsdon , Coventry .
This total exceeds that of last year , and it is also extremely satisctory to note that a very marked increase has taken place in tlIe number of watches which have gained more than 80 marks .
As some inconvenicllce was caused by the employment of temporary expedients to maintain the watch-safe at an average of F. for the " " middle-temperature\ldquo ; test , a burner was procured and fitted up with a shield , and the safe can now be kept at the desired point , whilst at the same time no deletel.ious fumes of coal-gas can penetrate into the interior amber .
The three rating safes are therefore now maintained by means of gas and ice practically the three constant temperatures of and F. respectively , all the year round .
Special attention continues to be give1l to the examination of pocket chronographs , in accordance with the request of the Cyclists ' Union .
of Chronometers.\mdash ; Since the institution of chronometer trials , as mentioned in last year 's Reporb , 27 movements have been examined , and certificates issued giving the mean daily rate and variation of rate at each change of temperature .
The trial occupies 3.5 days , divided into 5 pex.iods of 6 days each , and 5 intermediate days , namely , 1 day at the commencement of each period of test : Report of the Committee .

Report of the Kew Committee .
Mr. Whipple has recently designed two new simple forms of maximum pressure anemometers , which he exhibited before the Royal MeteorologicaI Society , and described in a paper read on April 2 They were also shown at the Falmouth Exhibition of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society in September .
Stevenson 's Screen.\mdash ; The Stevenson 's screen fixed on the lawn was blown over during the gale of September 2nd last , but fortunately the injury done by the accident was very trivial , as the screen was not in use at the time .
hibitions.\mdash ; Photographic curves and pictures have been by request shown at the Exhlbition at Newcastle-upon-Tyne and ths Royal Jubilee Exhibition , Manchester .
Library .
the year the library has received as presents the publications of\mdash ; 26 Scientific Societies and Institntions of Great Britain and Ire Iand , and 98 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments , as well as numerous private individuals ; the special thanks of the Committee being due to Dr. Neumayer , the Director of the Deutsche Seewarte , Hamburg , for a complete set of the publications of that establishment since 1876 .

APPENDIX I. ilfagnetic Observations at tloe Kew Long. W. , for the year October 1886 to September 1887 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator marked , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the samo netometer , Collimator Magnets 101 and being employed for The Dip observations were made with Dip.circle Barrow No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are in both EngIish and metrical scales\mdash ; the unit in the first being foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other oJle millimetre , one second oftime , and one milligramme , the factor for cing the nglish to metric values being By request , the corresponding values C. G.S. measure arc also given .
The value of employed in the reduction is at temperature F. The induction-coefficient is The correction of the magnetic power for temperature to an adopted standard temperature of F. is The true distaxlces between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflectionbar marked foot and feet , are feet and fact respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 14 observations of the time occupied by the in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have oeen made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant , employed in the formula of reduction , is In each observation of absolute Dechnation the instrumental readhave been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected feet of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of vihich , with respect to the Magnetometer , has been carefuIly detormined .
observations have been made and reduced by Mr. T. W. Baker .
