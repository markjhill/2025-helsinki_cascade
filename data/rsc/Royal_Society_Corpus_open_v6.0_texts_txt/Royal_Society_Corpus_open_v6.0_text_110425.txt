u On the Ova of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxits .
" By Richard Owen , Esq. Communicated by W. Clift , Esq. , F.R.S. The author , in this paper , has prosecuted more immediately and more minutely than in his former communication , the inquiry into the structure of theovary of the Ornithorhynchus , with a view to determine its exact relations with that of the normal Mammalia , and of the oviparous Vertebrata .
He has obtained from this investigation the full confirmation of the truth of the opinion he had previously formed , that lactation might coexist with a mode of generation essentially similar to that of the Viper and Salamander ; and this fact has been further established by the subsequent examination which he has made of the uterine foetus of the Kangaroo .
The author traces the regular gradation which obtains in different orders of Mammalia in which true viviparous or placental generation takes place , towards the ovo-viviparous or oviparous modes , in which the exterior covering of the ovum never becomes vascular , and shows that the Ornithorhynchus constitutes a connecting link in this chain .
Drawings illustrative of the anatomical descriptions of the parts examined by the author accompany the paper .
