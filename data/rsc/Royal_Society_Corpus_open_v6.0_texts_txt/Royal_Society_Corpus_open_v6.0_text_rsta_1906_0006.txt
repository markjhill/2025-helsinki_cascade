Researches on Explosives.\#151 ; Part By Sir Andrew Noble , Bart. , , , F.R.A.S. Received June 8 , \#151 ; Read June 8 , 1905 .
[ Plates 1-13 .
] The Researches which I venture to communicate to the Royal Society are , for the new explosives cordite , modified cordite , and nitro-cellulose , a continuation of the same modes of research , adopted in the experiments I made many years ago upon fired gunpowder with regard to the pressure and other phenomena attending its decomposition , and which appeared in the ' Philosophical Transactions .
' * In the present investigations the same general methods have been followed , but with apparatus greatly improved and of much greater delicacy .
The Academy of Sciences of France did Sir F. Abel and myself the great honour to appoint MM .
le General Morin and Berthelot to report on our paper , and after giving an extended analysis of the results of our experiments the reporters concluded t : " Par cette analyse trop succincte de l'important travail que MM .
Noble et Abel ont soumis au jugement de l'Academie , on peut voir que malgre certaines critiques auxquelles nul travail humain no saurait echapper , fensemhle de leurs recherches n'en constitue pas moins un oeuvre capitale , propre a jeter un grand jour sir toutes les questions qui se rattachent aux effets des poudres .
" A paper by M. Berthelot in the same No. of the ' Comptes Rendus ' draws attention to the chief point upon which that eminent chemist differed from ourselves .
A study of the variations in the products when the decomposition of gunpowder was conducted under pressures widely different , varying in fact between 1 ton per sq .
inch and 35 to 40 tons per sq .
inch , led my lamented friend Sir F. Abel and myself to state that , according to our view , " any attempt to express even in a complicated chemical equation the nature of the metamorphosis which a gunpowder of average composition may be considered to undergo , would only be calculated to convey an erroneous impression as to the simplicity or definite nature of the chemical results , and their uniformity under different conditions , while possessing no important bearing upon an elucidation of the theory of the explosion of gunpowder .

2 D 23.9.05 M. Berthelot , in the memoir to which I have referred , considers that the view which we took was contrary to all that was known in chemistry .
It is no light thing to differ from so great an authority as M. Berthelot ; but the innumerable experiments I have since made with various modern explosives , in which the decomposition is of a simpler nature than that of fired gunpowder , have only confirmed me in the opinion that Sir F. Abel and I then expressed .
Thus in a paper published in the ' Proceedings of the Boyal Society , '* I pointed out that when gun-cotton was fired under a great variation of pressure , the variations in the proportions of the resulting gases were both great and regular .
In passing , for instance , from explosions under a pressure varying from 1*5 ton per sq .
inch ( 2287 atmospheres ) to 50 tons per sq .
inch ( 76217 atmospheres ) the volume of carbonic anhydride increased from 26'49 per cent , to 36*18 per cent. , while the carbon monoxide decreased from 36'66 per cent , to 27'57 per cent. There were also other differences , though not quite so marked , such as the steady decrease of free hydrogen and the large and steady increase of marsh gas .
In the researches on gun-cotton to which I have alluded , certain data , such as the units of heat and the quantity of water formed by the explosion , although determined , were not determined under the varying conditions with regard to pressure and the quantity and nature of the gases generated , under which the explosion took place .
In the researches I am about to refer to , all the data connected with the explosion have been carefully determined , and I preface an account of the experiments themselves by a description of the varied apparatus adopted , or specially designed , for determining the tension of the gases generated by the explosion , the volume of the permanent gases and their nature , the quantity of water formed , the units ol heat generated , the time taken to complete the explosion under different pressures and different dimensions of the cords , tubes , or ribbons , these being the forms under which the explosives are generally made up .
I have made experiments also to determine the time in which the exploded gases part with their heat to the walls of the vessel in which they are confined .
These investigations have opened out many suggestive points , but in the present paper I propose to confine myself to a description of the apparatus used and the results obtained , giving also a resume of the calculations made to test the accuracy of the observations .
Commencing with the apparatus for firing the explosives experimented with at different densities , obtaining the gases for analysis , and measuring their total volume , the vessel A , in Plate 1 , is one of the explosion cylinders used for these experiments ; B is the plug closing the vessel , on which also is shown the arrangement by which , when desired , the gas is allowed to pass at a small pressure through the tubes , either * 'Roy .

to the gasometer C or at pleasure into the gas tubes D , which , before the experiment , are filled with mercury , the stop-cocks above and below being closed ; E is a thermometer for determining the temperature of the gas when its volume is measured .
Immediately after the explosion , it the vessel be quite tight , the valve at B is very slightly opened and the gas allowed to pass slowly through the tube F , containing pumice-stone and concentrated sulphuric acid , into the gasometer .
When it is quite certain that all air is removed from the conducting tubes , the gas is allowed to flow into one of the gas tubes D , and shortly afterwards or at fixed intervals of time into the other two tubes , the quantity of gas in the tubes being added to that measured in the gasometer , the height of the barometer and the temperature of the gas at the moment of measurement being also determined .
When the whole of the gas has been transferred to the gasometer , and the temperature and barometric pressure taken , the cylinder is opened .
A considerable quantity of water is always found ; as much as possible of this water is collected by means of a weighed sponge placed in a weighed vessel , and closed by a ground glass plate .
The amount of the water so collected is determined by weighing in the usual manner .
After all the water that it is possible to remove with the sponge is collected , a weighed vessel of calcium chloride is placed in the cylinder , which is then closed , and left for one or two days , when the same procedure is followed with a second calcium chloride vessel , after which the cylinder is generally found to be perfectly dry .
The next point to be determined is the amount of heat generated by the explosion .
For this purpose a strong steel vessel , the section of which is shown in Plate 2 , and of which the heat capacity is carefully determined , is employed .
The calorimeter used is practically of the same construction as that described by Ostwald in his ' Manual of Physico-Chemical Measurements .
' A section of this calorimeter is also shown in Plate 2 , the corresponding inner and outer surfaces of the several vessels being nickel plated .
For some hours before the experiment the calorimeter is kept in a room maintained at as even a temperature as possible , the explosion vessel itself with the charge to be exploded being kept in the water as shown , so that the whole system may assume practically the same temperature .
The rise of temperature due to the explosion being approximately known from previous experiments , the water in the outer cylinder before firing is kept at a temperature about half way between the initial and final temperatures of the inner vessel .
The thermometers employed for these determinations are calorimetric , specially made for calorimetric experiments , and are only used for observing changes of temperature , and not for determining absolute values .
The range of measurement in the thermometers I used was about 8 ' C. , but by a special contrivance these 8 ' 2 d 2 can be brought to any point of the thermometric scale that may be desired .
The temperature can be read approximately to 0*001 ' C. Full illustrations of a few of the calorimetric observations will be given with the corresponding calculations , and a resume of the results of the experiments at the end of the paper .
The analysis of the gaseous products of explosion was carried out by means of Sodeau 's gas analysis apparatus , * the principal features of which are shown in Plate 3 .
Mr. Sodeau 's apparatus is admitted to be the most convenient that has been yet devised .
I am indebted to him for the description of his apparatus and the mode of analysis followed .
The tubes used for measuring and correcting for variations of temperature and pressure are placed in a cylindrical water-jacket .
The measuring tube M is of 50 cub. centims. capacity , and is graduated in nj-cub .
centim. divisions .
Its upper end terminates in a capillary three-way stop-cock N , arranged so that the capillary K may be placed in communication either with the interior of the measuring tube or with the bent tube U containing water .
The zero point of the graduation is at the outer side of the plug of the stop-cock N. The level tube L communicates with the measuring tube by means of a side branch , bent so as to prevent any entangled air bubbles from reaching the measuring tube .
The lower end of the level tube is connected to a T piece , one end of which is provided with a stop-cock and leads to the mercury reservoir , whilst the other is prolonged across the table to a point near the reading telescope , where it terminates in a piece of thick-walled rubber tubing , the compression of which by a broad screw clip affords a means of accurately adjusting the level of the mercury without taking one 's eye from the reading telescope .
In order to render the apparatus more compact , the reading telescope is placed on the gas analysis table instead of on a separate support , and all graduations are consequently on the side opposite to that from which the stop-cocks are manipulated .
An illuminating arrangement slides on the rod P. The corrections for variations of temperature and pressure are found by means of the " Kew Principle " correction tube C , which is so called because , as in the " Kew " barometer , the disturbance of the level of the liquid is allowed for in the graduation of the instrument , instead of being adjusted before each reading is taken .
It consists of a cylindrical bulb having a stop-cock at its upper end , and attached below to a U tube , which is graduated on one limb and filled with water up to the zero mark whilst the stop-cock is open .
The volume of air contained in the bulb is such that the water is displaced to the extent of one small division by a change of temperature and atmospheric pressure , which will cause a gas to experience an alteration of volume amounting to 0*1 per cent. These small divisions are further * 'Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry , ' Feb. 28 , 1903 , page 187 .

subdivided into tenths by eye estimation .
Errors of parallax are avoided by the use of a mounted lens sliding on the rod It , and the corrections are thus read directly in percentages as easily as the temperatures would be read by means of a thermometer .
Absorptions are carried out in separate pipettes , one of which is shown in position .
About 20 cub. centims. of the absorbent is usually confined over mercury in the bulb E , which is slightly inclined in order to facilitate the return of the unabsorbed gas .
The horizontal bulb D receives the mercury displaced by the gas .
The bulb F contains clean mercury , and , like the bulb E , can be placed in communication with the capillary G by means of the three-way stop-cock H. The explosion pipette resembles that of Dittmar , but has a three-way stop-cock and mercury bulb arranged as in the absorption pipettes .
In conducting an analysis , the sample tube is connected to the measuring tube by means of a capillary tube previously filled with mercury , and the gas drawn in by lowering the reservoir .
After the mercury has been roughly levelled , the stopcock N is turned so as to connect the capillary K with the tube U , and an absorption pipette , containing caustic potash solution , connected to the measuring tube by means of thick-walled rubber tubing , the ends of the capillaries being made to meet .
A little water is then sucked through the capillaries into the bulb F , and mercury allowed to run back and fill the capillaries .
The stop-cock leading to the large mercury reservoir having been closed , and the level tube being open to the atmosphere , the mercury is accurately levelled , as already described , and the volume of the gas read by means of the reading telescope .
A reading of the correction tube is also taken .
In order to determine the amount of carbon dioxide present , the gas is driven over into the absorption pipette , followed by sufficient mercury to clear the capillaries , and the pipette well shaken in order to make the absorption complete .
A little more mercury is then run over in order to clear away the potash from the bottom of the capillary attached to the absorption bulb , and the stop-cock N reversed so that the mercury in the capillaries runs into the tube U. The stop-cock N is then again turned and the gas slowly passes into the measuring tube , the rate being controlled by the stop-cock H , which is reversed as soon as the absorbent reaches it , so that the gas may be swept out of the capillaries by means of clean mercury from the bulb F. The stop-cock N is closed as soon as it is reached by the mercury .
The gas is again carefully measured and the decrease of volume ( after the correction for alteration of temperature and pressure has been applied ) is equal to the amount of carbon dioxide originally present .
The residue is then treated with alkaline pyrogallol , in order to ascertain whether any trace of air has been left in the connecting tubes during the collection of the sample and has so contaminated the gas .
( This is more likely to occur when the explosion has taken place under feeble pressures and hut little gas been produced .
) If any oxygen is absorbed by the pyrogallol , its volume is multiplied by 4'8 and the product ( representing the volume of air present ) deducted from the volume of gas taken for analysis , in order to obtain the volume of uncontaminated gas in the sample , and hence the correct percentages of the various constituents .
Carbon monoxide is next removed by prolonged treatment with two successive portions of acid cuprous chloride solution .
After absorption in the first cuprous chloride pipette the gas is directly transferred to a second pipette containing a solution which has not previously absorbed more than a trace of carbon monoxide , this transference being accomplished in practically the same manner as the return of the gas to the measuring tube , which takes place after transference to a pipette containing a little water , which removes the traces of hydrochloric acid derived from the cuprous chloride solution .
An excess of oxygen* is then added , and , after measuring , the mixture is transferred to the explosion pipette , where it is exploded by means of an electric spark after expanding to such a volume as to prevent any marked oxidation of the nitrogen , whilst ensuring the complete combustion of the methane and hydrogen .
The residue is next measured in order to ascertain the reduction of volume resulting from the explosion , and the carbon dioxide , produced by the combustion of the methane , is determined by absorption with potash .
The volume of the carbon dioxide produced is equal to that of the methane originally present .
The contraction due to the combustion of the methane , or in other words , twice the volume of the carbon dioxide , is deducted from the total contraction resulting from the explosion , and two-thirds of the corrected contraction so obtained is equal to the volume of hydrogen .
Finally , the excess of oxygen remaining after explosion is determined by means of alkaline pyrogallol as a check upon the amounts of hydrogen and methane calculated as above .
The nitrogen is estimated by difference .
The above represents the routine determination of carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , hydrogen , methane and nitrogen , as usually carried out , but additional tests have also been employed in order to ascertain whether certain other bodies were present in measurable quantities , but with negative results .
Thus some of the gas samples were examined for unsaturated hydro-carbons ( ethylene , \amp ; c. ) immediately after the removal of the carbon dioxide , by shaking the gas with fuming sulphuric acid , f and removing acid fumes in the potash pipette before again measuring .
No change of volume was ordinarily observed , and in no case did the change exceed 0T per cent. , hence the samples did not contain any appreciable quantity of unsaturated hydrocarbons .
The ordinary determinations of contraction resulting from explosion , carbon dioxide * The oxygen is prepared by the electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid in a Hofmann voltameter and freed from traces of hydrogen by treatment in a Winkler combustion pipette .
A supply is stored over mercury in one of the ordinary absorption pipettes ready for use .
f Fuming sulphuric acid was used in one of the ordinary absorption pipettes , provided with a guard tube containing sulphuric acid , in order to prevent moisture from gaining access to the upper bulb D. Of course no mercury was employed in the absorption bulb , and that in the capillaries was driven into the bulb F when sending the gas into the pipette .

produced , and oxygen consumed , do not afford a means of distinguishing methane from its homologues in presence of an excess of hydrogen ; thus ethane , together with its own volume of hydrogen , would give the same numerical results as two volumes of methane .
A process of fractional combustion was therefore applied to some of the samples obtained from high density charges , as these contained large proportions ol saturated hydrocarbons .
After removing carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide and unsaturated hydrocarbons , an excess of oxygen was added and the hydrogen was removed by repeatedly passing over gently heated palladinized asbestos contained in a capillary tube attached to a pipette containing water , as in the ordinary Orsat-Lunge apparatus , until no further decrease of volume occurred .
The residual mixture was then examined by explosion , \amp ; c. , in the usual manner .
In each case the volume of carbon dioxide produced almost exactly half that of the decrease , resulting from the explosion , which latter was equal to the volume of oxygen consumed .
These ratios agree with those required by the equation CH4 + 2O2 = C02+2H20 , but differ markedly from those which would result with the homologues of methane , thus even with ethane the proportions are 4:5:7 instead of 1 : 2 : 2 .
It therefore follows that the saturated hydrocarbons should be calculated as methane , none of the other members of the series being present in appreciable quantities .
Examination of the water condensed in the closed vessel showed that the gas could not contain either ammonia or cyanogen in marked quantities , as the distribution under high pressure would so greatly favour the water .
The presence of oxides of nitrogen is , of course , incompatible with that of a large proportion of hydrogen , as the gases have slowly cooled from a very high temperature .
A trace of sulphuretted hydrogen , sufficient to markedly discolour mercury , exists in the gas when black powder is used as a lighter , but for all practical purposes the gaseous products of explosion may be regarded as consisting entirely of carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , hydrogen , methane and nitrogen .
One other arrangement of apparatus remains to be described , and that apparatus is used both for determining the time that explosives of various forms and natures require for their transformation , and for determining the rate at which they communicate the heat accompanying the explosion to the walls of the vessel in which the explosion takes place .
The apparatus ( see Plate 4 ) consists of an explosion vessel of the usual form , the explosion vessel being closed at its two ends by gas-tight plugs , through one of which pass the firing wires , while to the plug at the other end is fitted-a pressure indicator .
The pressure indicator is provided with a steel plunger of small area , which is exposed to the gas pressure .
An enlarged continuation of this plunger engages the end of a spiral spring a , the resistance of which has been carefully determined .
Attached to this plunger at b is a lever , the fulcrum of which , c , is fixed to the stationary bracket of the indicator , so that , when the spring is compressed , motion is given to the ends of the lever .
Fixed to the lever are two electric magnets d , the one to record seconds , the other to perfect the firing circuit .
A rocking bar e is coupled up over the seconds magnet , which is again coupled at the other end by a link / , thus conveying the seconds beats of the chronometer to the pen tracing its path on the revolving drum .
The revolving drum itself is of light wood ; fixed to the frame are two rods gg , upon which slides the carriage for carrying the recording pen .
The pen is held up by a detent , which is liberated by the firing current passing through the electromagnet to which the detent is attached .
There are two speeds given to the drum , the first a high speed ( about 40 inches per second ) , the second very slow , about one inch per second .
The drum is revolved by means of cord bands , which lead from the speed gear of the motor .
Before firing , the fast-speed cord is made to drive the drum , the slow-speed cord running free ; about one or two seconds after the explosion the change speed lever is raised , thereby releasing the fast cord and tightening the slow cord .
The fast speed is obtained approximately by watching the tachometer , but the actual speed is determined by measuring the length of the second on the recording diagram .
The diagram is traced on a sheet of tin foil backed by paper .
This is placed on the drum as shown on Plate 4 , the edges being joined with gum , the surface being smoked black by camphor .
The chronometer is of the ordinary marine type , but is furnished with a seconds make-and-break arrangement ; this being coupled up through a relay to the pressure lever , causes the recording pen to beat seconds till the desired curve is complete .
The action of the apparatus during an experiment is as follows :\#151 ; All connections being made , the chronometer is coupled up , the pen carriage beating seconds , but no mark is yet made on the recording tin foil , the pen being held by the detent .
The drum is started , and when it has reached the desired speed , as shown by the tachometer , the button of the firing battery is pressed and the circuit is completed at the beat of the next second .
The current simultaneously releases the pen and fires the charge .
As quickly as possible the speed is reduced by raising the speed lever and at the same time reducing the speed of the motor .
The chronometer continues to beat seconds , thereby giving the relation between time and pressure until the experiment is concluded .
The diagram is then removed from the drum by cutting through the point where the pen dropped , this being the beat of the second firing the charge .
The sheet is then laid on a tray face up , flooded with thin varnish , and hung up t ~\gt ; dry .
For the purposes of these reseaches , which are specially directed to ascertain the differences in the phenomena attending the transformation of explosives fired under different pressures , I have employed three explosives , viz. , the cordite known as SIR ANDREW NOBLE : RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES .
Mark I ( for which the country has been indebted to the labours of Sir F. Abel and Sir J. Dewar ) , the modified cordite known as M.D. , and a tubular nitrocellulose known as ft. It .
ftottweil .
The general results , which I need not say have necessitated much calculation , are given in tables , but I think it necessary to give the results of a few experiments worked out in full , these being a fair sample of the whole series .
In each case I give the reconciliation between the elements determined in the explosive and the same elements found in the gases after explosion .
Taking into account the fact that the explosives themselves are not always of precisely the same composition , and also the nature of the experiments , the reconciliation to which I have referred is a very great deal closer than I expected .
It has been suggested to me more than once that the mixture of the gases might not be homogeneous , that is , that tubes taken at different times from the explosion vessel might not give the same analysis .
I have not found this to be the case .
Thus , in an experiment where a charge of Rottweil ft. It .
was fired under a pressure of 20'5 tons per sq .
inch ( 3125 atmospheres ) , and a tube of the resultant gases was taken so soon as it was certain that all the air contained in the conducting tubes , \amp ; c. , was displaced , a second tube being taken 6 or 7 minutes later , the analysis gave for the two tubes of permanent gases the following percentages :\#151 ; 1st tube .

In these cases of course the weight would be in defect , but in a few cases the weight of the gases was in excess , and I proceed to show how these experiments were dealt with .
Experiment 1417.\#151 ; At a density of 0*45 a charge of 143*91 grammes of M.D. cordite , giving a pressure of 43*22 tons per square inch ( 6588*2 atmospheres ) , generated 98,231*9 cub. centims. at 0 ' C. and 760 millims. pressure ; the water collected was 15*59 grammes = 19,384*0 cub. centims.

The volume of the gases has therefore been reduced to 97,589*5 cub. centims. , thus giving 676*3 cub. centims. of permanent gases or 810*6 cub. centims. total gas for each gramme exploded .

" SIR ANDREW NOBLE : RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES .
The heat capacities of the explosion vessels were carefully determined , as were those of the calorimeters and their equipage , including the stirrers and the mercurial thermometers .
The latter were of the differential type described by Professor Ostwald , those I used having a range of about 8 ' C. Two observations for each density were sufficient if the observations were accordant .
If not accordant , three were generally taken .
Not unnaturally , the observations at the higher densities were considerably more accordant than those at the lower .
Commencing with the Chilworth It .
It .
nitrocellulose ( tubular ) in Experiment 1344 , 9T7 grammes were fired , the explosion vessel , when fired , being suspended in 4000 grammes of distilled water in the calorimeter , the water equivalent of the explosion vessel and the calorimeter being 680 cub. centims. It was then found that immediately before explosion the calorimeter differential thermometer showed 1'T61 ( equivalent to 190,9 C. ) .

A second determination of the heat , developed under the same conditions , was made in Experiment 1345 , which was simply a repetition of Experiment 1344 .
Here , immediately before explosion , the differential thermometer gave a temperature of 722 ( equivalent to 19'*4 C. ) .

The previous experiment having given 972*7 heat units , the mean may be taken as 972*5 .
It is unnecessary to say that this degree of accuracy is exceptional , but still , considering the nature of the experiments , the accuracy , even at moderate densities , cannot be considered unsatisfactory .
Thus in Experiment 1392 , at a density of 0*25 , 7*737 grammes of M.D. were fired , the differential thermometer being at 2'*012 ( ecpiivalent to 18'*3 C. ) .

To illustrate the remark I made as to increase of accuracy when taking the calorimetric observations at the higher densities , I give the whole of the observations on this point with Mark I cordite .
Thus , at the density of 0*05 the three observations were , respectively , 1265*1 , 1303"0 , 1248'8 , or a mean of 1272'3 units .
With density 0*1 the three observations were 1275*8 , 1240*5 , 1235*7 , or a mean of 1250*7 units .
Density 0*15 gave 1259*7 , 1247*2 , 1242*7 , or a mean of 1249*9 .

We are now in a position to give in a tabular form the result of the series of experiments on the three explosives fired under a variety of densities and pressures , and with regard to which the essential constants have been determined .
These tables give :\#151 ; ( 1 .

Thus in all three there is , with increase of pressure , at first a slight increase , afterwards a steady decrease in the volume of permanent gases produced .
This increase in the total gases is much less marked with cordite , and in the case of M.D. and nitrocellulose there is practically a steady decrease in the volume of the total gases .
In all three explosives there is , with increased pressure , a large increase in the volume of carbonic anhydride and a large decrease in the volume of carbonic monoxide .
In the case of hydrogen , this decrease of volume with increase of pressure is very great , while with methane , the percentage wdiich with low pressures is quite insignificant , very rapidly increases and at the highest density is from twenty to thirty times greater than the lowest density .
There are some variations in the percentages of nitrogen and H20 , but on the whole these constituents may be considered to be nearly constant .
The units of heat with a slight decline at first afterwards increase and somewhat rapidly at the highest pressures .
But the changes which take place under different pressures are more readily appreciated if the observations are graphically recorded by means of curves .
Accordingly in Plate 5 I have given for three explosives the pressures in tons per sq .
inch and in atmospheres , deduced from the experiments under consideration , and which pressures vary from about 3 tons per sq .
inch ( 457 atmospheres ) to ( in the case of Mark I cordite ) 53 tons per sq .
inch ( 8078 atmospheres ) .
It will be observed also that from densities of about 0'25 upwards the curve expressing the relation of pressure to density , both in the Mark I cordite and in the M.D. , differs inappreciably from a straight line .
This remark also appears to be , in some degree , corroborated by an experiment I once made at a density of unity , and which gave a pressure of about 112# tons per sq .
inch ( 17,070 atmospheres ) .
With nitrocellulose there appears , at high densities , to be a tendency to detonate , from which tendency Mark I cordite appears to be free .
By way of showing the enormous superiority of the new explosives as regards potential energy , I have added to Plate 5 the curve showing the relation of pressure to density of fired gunpowder .
In Plate 6 there are three sets of curves:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The changes in the volumes of the permanent gases due to increase of density ; ( 2 ) The changes in the volumes of the total gases which do not differ very greatly from those of the permanent gases ; and ( 3 ) The changes in the units of heat at different densities ( water fluid ) .
It may be noted that , while at pressures under 20 tons per sq .
inch the heat * On the occasion referred to , I was not sure that the pressure might not be higher , as there was considerable friction between the piston and the cylinder , due to compression of the gauge .
SIR ANDREW NOBLE : RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES .
developed does not vary greatly ; at higher pressures the heat increases considerably , thus compensating for the loss of potential energy due to the decrement in the volume of gas generated .
Plates 7 , 8 and 9 show graphically the great changes that take place in the decomposition of the gases in passing from densities of 0*05 to 0*45 .
In all , carbon monoxide and dioxide change places , the two gases having equal volumes in the case of cordite 24*2 per cent , at a density of 0*19 , in the case of M.D. 25'5 per cent , at a density of 0*32 , and with nitrocellulose 26 per cent , at a density of 0-36 .
The changes with hydrogen and methane are equally striking , the hydrogen in cordite falling from a maximum of nearly 16 per cent , in volumes to about 9*5 , while the methane increases from about 0*2 per cent , to about 5'5 per cent. In M.D. the volumes of hydrogen fall from about 19 per cent , to about 10'4 per cent. , while the volume of methane increases from about 0*3 per cent , to nearly 9 per cent. , and in nitrocellulose the volume of hydrogen falls from 20*7 per cent , to about 11 per cent. , the methane increasing from 0*5 per cent , to a little over 9 per cent. In the tables I have submitted it will be observed that the specific heats and the temperatures of explosion have been given , but in regard to temperatures so far above those in regard to which accurate observations have been made the figures I give can only be taken as provisional .
The specific heats of the various gases have been taken at the values usually assigned to them .
Of course , it cannot be assumed that these specific heats remain unchanged over the wide range of temperature necessary , although I believe it has been found that the specific heats of some permanent gases such as nitrogen and oxygen are but slightly altered up to 800 ' C. The temperatures of explosion which , as I have said , can only be taken as provisional , have been obtained by dividing the units of heat ( water gaseous ) by the specific heats , and , although provisional , can safely be used in comparing the temperatures of explosion of the three explosives .
The temperatures of explosion , for example , of cordite and nitrocellulose at the density of 0*20 may tolerably safely be taken to be in the ratio of 51 to 36 .
I am , from other considerations , inclined to believe that the temperatures I have obtained and given in the tables are not very far removed from the truth .
I tried with cordite to confirm the results by using the equation of dilatability of gases .
At the high pressures the results were satisfactory , but quite the reverse at the lower densities .
The comparative approximate potential energies are obtained by multiplying the volume of gas produced by the temperature of explosion .
The means for the three explosives are respectively : cordite , 0*9762 ; M.D. , 0*8387 ; nitrocellulose , 0*7464 .
The highest potential energy ( taken as unity ) , it will be noted , was obtained from cordite at a density of 0*5 .
I submit that the wide differences in the transformation of the three explosives VOL. OCV.\#151 ; A. 2 G with which I have experimented justify the conclusion at which Sir F. Abel and I arrived with respect to gunpowder , viz. , that any attempt to define by a chemical equation the nature of the metamorphosis which one explosive may be considered to undergo would only be calculated to convey an erroneous impression as to the definite nature of the chemical results and their uniformity under different conditions .
The apparatus shown in Plate 4 was employed for two purposes , ( 1 ) to determine the time for the complete ignition of various explosives , or for various forms and thicknesses of the same explosives ; ( 2 ) to determine the rate at which the exploded gases part with their heat to the walls of the vessel in which they are enclosed .
The high and low speeds that can be given to the drum permit these two observations to be made by a single experiment .
Thus , in Plate 10 , I show the commencement and part of the curves of two experiments , the one ( fig. 1 ) fired at a pressure of a little over 12 tons per sq .
inch ( 1829 atmospheres ) , the other ( fig. 2 ) nearly 18 tons ( 2744 atmospheres ) .
At the point " A " the charge is fired , and it will be noted that the circumference of the drum is travelling at about 40 inches per second .
From fig. 2 it will be seen that at 2 seconds after firing the speed has , in this experiment , been reduced to about an inch per second .
The times required for the completion of ignition are given in Plate 11 , and are obtained from the curves shown on Plate 10 and from two similar curves .
The vertical scale in Plate 11 for the three last densities is doubled to make them accord with density 0T , the spring employed in that experiment being half the strength of that used for the last three .
I may point out that when fired in close vessels the rate of combustion of the explosives , even in the cord form , appears to be very constant , the increase of pressure apparently nearly compensates for the reduction of surface , the differences in time of burning being due to want of uniformity in the lighting , which in many cases is very variable .
This is illustrated by comparing the times of ignition of densities 0'15 and 0'2 in Plate 11 , where the total time from firing to complete ignition is less for density 0'15 than for density 0'2 .
In reality , however , after complete lighting the latter is burning quicker , as may be seen by comparing the angles made by the curves with the axis of abscissae .
But this question is too large to enter into fully in the present paper .
I therefore only give the times of approximate complete combustion of cordite and M.D. cordite of different diameters when exploded at a pressure of about 9 tons on the square inch .

inches ( 354'3 sq .
centims. ) .
The communication of heat to the vessel is extraordinarily rapid .
The pressure and approximately the temperature of the exploded gases is in the case of Density 0*1 ( 32 grammes ) reduced to one half in 0*87 second , and to one quarter in 2*70 seconds .
Density 0*15 ( 48 grammes ) reduced to one half in 0*93 second , and to one quarter in 2*82 seconds .
Density 0*20 ( 64 grammes ) reduced to one half in 1*54 seconds , and to one quarter in 3*83 seconds .
Density 0*25 ( 80 grammes ) reduced to one half in 2*40 seconds , and to one quarter in 6*04 seconds .
1020*6 grammes of the same cordite fired at a density of 0*1 in a vessel whose interior surface was 3271 sq .
centims. reduced its pressure to one half in 3*1 seconds , to one fourth in 10 seconds .
1247*4 grammes fired at a density of 0*12 in the same vessel had the pressure reduced to one half in 4*2 seconds , and to one quarter in 13*8 seconds .
1360*8 grammes fired at a density of 0*131 in the same vessel recorded a pressure of one half in 6*3 seconds , and of one quarter in 31 seconds .
I venture to allude to two other points of interest .
I have always thought it probable that the dissociation , for example , of carbonic dioxide into carbonic monoxide and oxygen might be very greatly modified or extinguished by the extremely high pressure at which my experiments have been made ; and I thought it possible that , if dissociation did take place , some indication of the re-formation of carbonic dioxide would appear in the cooling curves , which have been obtained under a variety of conditions and pressures .
These curves , however , are singularly free from any indication of disturbance , so that , if any recombination does take place , it has no effect on the extremely regular coolings to which I have alluded , and would seem to prove that the re-formation of C02 and H20 must take place gradually and in no case per saltum .
I have found also , and this point is of some interest , that gases I have taken from the chamber of a 9'2-inch gun immediately after firing have , when corrected for the air with which they are mixed , the same composition as those which have been fired under similar densities in a close vessel .
The experiments I have made on erosion with the three explosives referred to in this paper , and on some others , have satisfied me that the amount of absolute erosion is governed practically entirely by the heat developed by the explosion .
I had thought that increase of pressure would considerably increase the amount of erosion , but in experiments carried on with cordite and nitrocellulose under pressures varying from 5 tons to 32 tons per sq .
inch the erosion was practically entirely independent of the pressure both for the cordite and the nitrocellulose .
The results of these experiments are given in Plate 13 .
