Communicated by Professor Pucker , Sec. E.S. Received June 6 , \#151 ; Read June 20 , 1901 .
The following Magnetic Observations have been made at various times during the years 1893 to 1899 , at first with a Declinatorium , made by Bamberg , of Berlin , the property of the Egyptian Government , and later with a Kew Magnetometer , No. 73 , and Dover 's Dip Circle , No. 99 , both kindly lent by the Council of the Royal Society on the recommendation of Professor A. W. Rucker , F.RS .
These observations are most conveniently divided into five groups , each of which includes observations made during a single period and with a single instrument\#151 ; I. Observations made with a Declinatorium by Bamberg , of Berlin : ( a. ) In the neighbourhood of Cairo , 1893\#151 ; 1894 .
( b. ) In the Lybian Desert , near the Kharga and Dakhla Oases , in December , 1893 , and January , 1894 .
( c. ) In the Lybian Desert from the Wadi Natrun to the Baharia Oasis , April , 1894 .

[ June 6 , The declinatorium used at first consisted of a horizontal circle furnished with two verniers reading to 30 " , while the magnet was balanced on a vertical steel pivot , in a box which occupied the centre of the horizontal circle .
Attached to the magnet was a mirror , in which the reflected image of the cross wires was observed with a small telescope placed excentrically .
The same telescope also served to observe the sun or a meridian mark for determining the geographical meridian .
The geographical positions were taken from Maps Nos. 740 , 662 , published by the Intelligence Division , War Office , or from astronomical observations taken on the spot ; the former are indicated by * and the latter by f. In each case the time of the observation is given as Cairo mean time , i.e. , 2h 5ra 8S,9 fast of Greenwich , since all the observations were made before the time of the 30 ' meridian E. of Greenwich was adopted as civil time for Egypt .
D'Abbadie 's station , beside the Great Pyramid at Giza , was occupied on May 10 , 1901 , to obtain improved values of the secular variation .
The observations were made between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. when the electric tramway was not working .
Since there are , as yet , no self-registering magnetic instruments in Egypt , it is impossible to reduce the results obtained to a single epoch with any accuracy ; they are , therefore , given as they were originally observed . .
Helwan , 20 kiloms .
south of Cairo , was chosen for the observations of 1898 and 1899 , since the electric tramways of Cairo render observations impracticable even if the amount of iron in the present observatory building at Abbassia did not vitiate all observations taken there .
For this reason the value of 5 ' 36 ' west for the declination , given in the ' Bulletin Mensuel ' of the Abbassia Observatory for June , 1886 , is wholly wrong .
In observing with the Declinatorium , the feet of the tripod were firmly pressed into the ground , and this was found sufficient for the precision obtainable with the instrument .
With the Kew pattern magnetometer , however , wooden pickets were driven firmly into the ground , and the feet of the tripod rested on these , thus avoiding any errors due to the tripod sinking into soft or sandy soil .
All the observations which follow may be considered as satisfactory ones taken under favourable conditions , since all those which were interfered with by high winds , sand storms , \amp ; c. , have been omitted .
The stations where igneous rocks are known to be near enough to affect the results somewhat are marked with an asterisk on page 10 .
At several places on the Bahr el Abyad granite masses , and occasionally basaltic rocks , rise through the sandstone , and the high value for declination obtained at Kenk ( page 23 ) is probably due to this .

While employed on Philse Island examining and restoring the ancient buildings on the island , magnetic observations in the neighbouring country could not be undertaken for want of time .
A magnetometer was set up , therefore , in a small , empty chamber on the roof of the Great Isis Temple , and the declination observed hourly ' from 7 A.M. to 5 P.M. , except when the work on the excavations prevented .

) V. Secular Variation .
As many early observations as it has been possible to find in various works have been collected in the following tables for the purpose of determining the average annual rate of change .
Generally the declination appears to have been annually decreasing by about 6 ' to 7 ' in the first half of the century , becoming , however , 3 ' to 4 ' only in the second half .
For the dip the available observations are very few ; but from those at Alexandria and at the Great Pyramid , Giza , the rate of decrease appears to be about 1 ' to l'*5 annually .
For the horizontal force the 'observations are too few , and give results which are not very concordant .
The observations before June , 1894 , were made with the declina-torium , so that those made at later dates are more reliable , since a Kew pattern magnetometer with a unifilar suspension was used .
The values obtained cannot be considered as laying claim to a high degree of accuracy , seeing that in most cases the hour of observation is not given in the older observations ; still in most cases the number of years elapsed is sufficiently great to reduce the error thus introduced into the value for the annual change to small dimensions .

Appendix .
Observations on the Upper Nile .
The following observations were taken in March and April of the present year ( 1901 ) while accompanying Sir W. E. Garstin , K.C.M.G. , Under-Secretary of State for Public Works , from Khartum through the region of the " Sadd " to Gondokoro and back , and are added here with his permission .
As this journey was specially undertaken to see the upper reaches of the Bahr el Jebel , and to measure the discharge of the White Nile and its Various tributaries in this district , magnetic observations had to be taken whenever opportunities occurred .
It has consequently happened that the stations occupied cannot be described with sufficient accuracy for them to be re-occupied at a future date , since most of them were wooding-stations with no permanent building or other marks in the neighbourhood .
The latitudes given are taken from the map of the Bahr el Abiad ( White Nile ) made under the direction of General Gordon , when Governor-General of the Sudan , for the stations on that river ; and those on the Bahr el Jebel from a compass survey of the river made on this occasion and adjusted to the latitudes of Gaba Shamba , Kenisa , Bor , Lado , and Gondokoro , which have been determined by observations at various times .
( See map , p. 24 .
) The station occupied at Omdurman was on the left bank of the Nile , half-way between the gunboat workshops and the angle of the old Omdurman wall , and about 100 metre\#169 ; from the river bank .
These observations , extending as they do from about 16 ' to 5 ' north latitude , and crossing the magnetic equator , form an interesting continuation to those from Cairo to Wadi Haifa , 30 ' N. to 21 ' 30 ' N. , which have been given above .
No attempt has been made to reduce these southern results to the same epoch as the others , since no reliable data are as yet available for doing so .
Hardly any observations exist , it seems , which can be utilised to determine the secular change .
Pruysenaere 's results ( quoted in the following short table taken from ' Petermann 's Mittheilungen , ' Erganz.-heft 51 , 1877 ) in the desert east of the Bahr el Abyad ( White Nile ) appear to show too much local attraction to be of much use .
An observation of Kussegger 's in April , 1837 , at Torra , on the Bahr el Abyad , gives 9 ' W. for the declination , which , taking the present value at 5 ' 20 ' W. , gives 3 ' 4 ' of annual decrease .

The only other observation it has been possible to find in the books of travel , \amp ; c. , available in Cairo , is a value of 7 ' 30 ' W. for the declination at Gondokoro on March 20 , 1861 , * which with 6 ' 20 ' for the present values gives - 2 ' per annum .
Unfortunately the first rains were already threatening at Lado and Gondokoro , and the sky was usually too cloudy to admit of satisfactory observations for azimuth , Hellet el Nuer and El Kenisa were therefore the only two places where the declination could be determined on the Bahr el Jebel .
Russegger also gives for El Obeid declination 8 ' 30 ' west and dip 18 ' for April , 1837 , but neither of these can be utilised , being too far from the Nile .
The instruments used were Kew-pattern Magnetometer , No. 87 , by Elliott , and a Dip Circle , No. 131 , by Dover .

)\gt ; " Note on the Effect of Mercury Vapour on the Spectrum of Helium .
" By Professor J. Norman Collie , F.B.S. Eeceived June 3 , \#151 ; Head June 19 , 1902 .
Some years ago the author , in conjunction with Professor Kamsay , published the results of some experiments relating to the visibility of the spectrum of one gas in presence of another.* Since then some experiments have been made on the effect of mercury vapour ( when present in considerable quantity ) on the spectrum of helium in an ordinary Pliicker 's tube , under the influence of the electric discharge from an induction coil .
When the spectrum-of helium is examined in an ordinary Plucker 's tube , it appears to be a simple one consisting of only eight lines\#151 ; two red , one yellow , three green , one blue , and one violet .
The spectrum , however , of the negative glow is much more com- # ' Roy .
