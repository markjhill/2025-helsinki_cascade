148 Anniversary Meeting .
appear at the higher concentrations , but at low concentrations equivalent solutions have equal conductivity .
4 .
The conductivity of the haloid salts as a group is distinct from that of the oxy-salts .
5 .
The conductivity of the haloid salts of a metal among themselves increases with the increasing atomic weight of the halogen .
6 .
The conductivity of the oxy-salts of a metal is approximately equal , and approaches that of the hydrates .
7 .
The more easily oxidisable halogen salts are probably partly converted into oxide in the flame , so that their conductivity is composed of two parts .
8 .
The behaviour of the salts in flames supplied with chloroform vapour seems to establish the fact that the conductivity and the colour produced by the salt vapour are not due to a common cause .
The coloration of a flame by an alkali salt does not seem therefore to be connected with the ionisation of the salt .
It must be attributed to the metal set free by a chemical process .
This process consists probably in a reduction effected by the fldme gases .
An oxy-salt would , generally speaking , form in the first instance an oxide , which would then be reduced .
In the case of haloid salts it seems also necessary to suppose that an oxide is intermediately formed , the metal then being liberated by reduction .
