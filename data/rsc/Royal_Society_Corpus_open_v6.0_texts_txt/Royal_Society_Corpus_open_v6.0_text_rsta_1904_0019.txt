In a recent paper , * termed here for brevity ( A ) , I considered the relationship between certain phenomena of terrestrial magnetism on " quiet " days at Kew and Wolfer 's sun-spot frequency .
Some contemporaneous French and German magnetic data were also referred to , but in no great detail .
I have now gone more fully into the question , in order to find out whether any of the phenomena conspicuous at Kew are peculiar to the place or to the period of time formerly dealt with .

7.7.04 Assuming the relation between any magnetic quantity It\#151 ; such as the daily range of declination\#151 ; and sun-spot frequency S to be of the simplest type , It = a + frS ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ( 1 ) , I determined the values of the constants a and in a number of cases .
The chief results were as follows :\#151 ; Supposing each month of the year treated separately , it was found that both a and b were conspicuously lower in " winter " ( the four months November to February ) than at the " equinoxes " or in " summer " ( May to August ) ; but b/ a was larger in " winter " than at the " equinoxes , " and larger at the " equinoxes " than in " summer .
" The b constants were generally fully larger at the " equinoxes " than in " summer , " but to this there were exceptions .
The values of b/ a were distinctly larger in the case of inclination and horizontal force than in the case of declination and vertical force ; generally they were larger for inclination than for horizontal force , and larger for declination than for vertical force .
In all the elements b/ a was larger when H represented the sum of the 24 hourly differences from the mean value for the day than when it represented the range in the diurnal inequality .
In ( A ) the letters D , I , H , V were used for declination , inclination , horizontal force and vertical force respectively .
This practice is continued here when it tends to brevity .
S 2 .
The first question now to be considered is as to the dependence of a and b on the particular period to which the magnetic and sun-spot data refer .
This is not so simple as might appear at first sight .
Very few observatories have magnetic records extending over any large number of years , and in the few cases where such long records exist their homogeneousness is seldom , if ever , beyond dispute .
There has usually been change both in the apparatus and its environment , and it is difficult even for those in immediate charge of an old observatory to know what allowance ought to he made to put old and new records on a common footing .
This is especially true of V and I. The element where least uncertainty should prevail is D , but even here there is usually cause for doubt .
Milan Decimation Ranges .
S 3 .
Rajnaw has recently considered a long series of data representing the mean value for each year of the diurnal range of D at Milan .
Since 1871 the range seems to have been determined from regular daily observations at 8 a.m , and 2 p.m. ; but previous to that date there seems to have been some lack of strict uniformity .
Rajna has calculated values for a and b in the formula ( 1 ) from the data for the 59 years 1836 to 1894 , and independently for the 24 years 1871 to 1894 , employing * 'Rendiconti del R. 1st .

the method ol least squares .
The formulae he thus obtains , and one which he quotes as obtained by Wolfer , are as follows:\#151 ; f 1836 to 1894 , It = 5-31 + 0*047 S . . . .
( L ) , [ 1871 " 1894 , R = 5*39 + 0*047 S ... .
( II .
) , Wolfer ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .R = 5-67 + 0*040 S . . . .
( III ) .
Wolfer 's value 0*040 for b is based on data from Christiania , Prague , Greenwich and Vienna , as well as from Milan .
Rajna compares the values calculated from each of the three formulae with the ranges observed at Milan from 1836 to 1901 .
Formula ( I. ) agrees rather better than ( II .
) with observation ; formula ( III .
) seems distinctly inferior .
The difference between the observed values and those calculated from ( I. ) varies from \#151 ; 17*87 in 1838 to -f- 17'87 in 1866 , the extreme values observed in R being 47*21 and 127*03 .
Since 1871 the agreement seems decidedly improved .
Over the 24 years for which it was originally calculated ( II .
) gives a " probable error " of only 07*21 , the difference between observed and calculated values varying from \#151 ; 0'*49 to + 0'*53 .
Rajna himself notices that there are several long runs of the same sign in the differences between observed and calculated values .
Thus from 1837 to 1850 the observed value is in excess of the calculated ( from either ( I. ) or ( II .
) ) 12 out of 14 times ; on the other hand , in the 14 years 1854 to 1867 , the calculated value is 13 times in excess .
In the 11 years 1890 to 1900 ( to which the Kew data treated in ( A ) referred ) Rajna 's calculated value from either ( I. ) or ( II .
) has been in excess 8 times , including every year since 1893 .
The two first specified predominances of one sign are certainly in excess of what one would expect from pure chance .
To throw some further light on the question , I have calculated values for a and b for the above-mentioned series of years .
Instead of least squares , I grouped the years , following the method explained in ( A ) , S 52 .
The grouping of years and the corresponding mean values of R and S were as follows : \#151 ; Mean R. Mean S. Period 1837 to 1850- 9-270 68-9 Years of sun-spot maximum , 1837 , 1838 , 1839 , 1847 , 1848 , 1849 . .

It is certainly satisfactory that the values of a and b for the period 1890 to 1900 differ so little from Rajna 's values for the long period 1836 to 1894 .
The probable error , employing my values of a and is only some 4 or 5 per cent , less than that found when employing Rajna 's values for the long period .
In considering the results for the two earlier periods , we must remember the want of homogeneousness referred to above .
The mere existence of Rajna 's formula ( I. ) seems , however , evidence that , in his opinion , the want of homogeneousness is not serious , and the similarity of formulae ( I. ) and ( II .
) to a certain extent supports this view .
The period 1837 to 1850 gives a very high value for and a distinctly low value for b. The outstanding features of this period were the high mean sun-spot frequency , and the largeness of the declination range in the years of sun-spot minimum .
Unless the results are very sensibly affected by heterogeneousness in the data , we must conclude that values calculated for and b from a period as long as 14 years may depart somewhat widely from those calculated from a different equal or longer period .
The range of variability would seem least in b and ( naturally ) greatest in b/ a. The value calculated for b from the period 1854 to 1867 agrees well with Rajna 's , but the value found for a is distinctly lower than his .
The sun-spot frequency during this period presented similar features to those occurring in the 11 years 1890 to 1900 .

A second long series of data is that employed by Mr. Ellis in two papers , * in which he compares D and H ranges at Greenwich with sun-spot frequency .
Mr. Ellis gives the observed D and H ranges from the diurnal inequalities for each month of the period 1841 to 1896 .
These are based on all days , excluding those of * ' Phil. Trans. , ' vol. 171 , for 1880 , p. 541 ; Proc. Roy .

large disturbance .
Corresponding " quiet " day data appear in Mr. Ellis ' second paper for the 8 years 1889 to 1896 .
Mr. Ellis specifies several sources which may have introduced some heterogeneousness into the earlier data as compared to the later .
Prior to 1848 there were only eye readings at 2-hour intervals , whereas subsequently hourly data were available .
Prior to 1864 , when the magnetographs were transferred to a new building , some uncertainty seems to have prevailed as to the temperature correction for H , and the data for 1864 itself seem to be interpolated .
The data subsequent to 1864 would seem to be strictly homogeneous .
S 6 .
Mr. Ellis employed no formula , and , whilst his graphical method appeals readily to the eye , it does not lend itself immediately to the present investigation .
I have accordingly calculated values for a and for each month of the year in both D and H for the following periods : 1841 to 1896 , 1865 to 1896 , and 1889 to 1896 for both " all " and " quiet " days .
In treating the first period , use was made of a group of sun-spot maximum years composed of 5 sub-groups each of 3 years , viz. , 1847 to 1849 , 1859 to 1861 , 1870 to 1872 , 1882 to 1884 , and 1892 to 1894 .
The corresponding sun-spot minimum group consisted similarly of 15 years , made up of 5 sub-groups , viz. , 1842 to 1844 , 1854 to 1856 , 1865 to 1867 , 1877 to 1879 and 1888 to 1890 .
For the period 1865 to 1896 the groups of sun-spot maximum and sun-spot minimum years were composed in either case of the last 3 sub-groups specified above .
For the period 1889 to 1896 the groups were : 1892 to 1895 for sun-spot maximum , and 1889 to 1890 for sun-spot minimum .
The values thus found for a , b and b/ a appear in Tables II .
and III .
In addition to values for the individual months , the tables give values for winter , equinox and summer\#151 ; each comprised of 4 months , as explained in S 1\#151 ; and for the year .
These seasonal and yearly values of a and b are simply arithmetic means of the individual monthly values ; the seasonal and yearly values of b/ a are derived from the seasonal and yearly values of a and b. The tables also supply corresponding data for Kew as given in ( A ) , Table XL .

157 S 7 .
In the case of D , Table II .
, we see on the whole a close resemblance between the results from the two longest series of data .
The later period shows , however , a slightly increased value of b and a slightly decreased value of in winter , equinox , and the year as a whole .
The last period , 1889-96 , in the " all " day data shows a further increase in b and decrease in a ; and the corresponding " quiet " day results give a still smaller value of a , especially in the winter months .
The " all " and " quiet " day mean values of b for the year , from the 1889-96 period at Greenwich , are practically identical and very close to the corresponding Kew value .
The values of b/ a at Greenwich are in each season slightly larger for the " quiet " days than for the corresponding " all " days ; and comparing the " all " day data amongst themselves we have an increase in b/ a in passing from the longest to the mean period , and in passing from the mean period to the shortest period .
This would imply that b/ a has increased of late years .
At Greenwich , as at Kew , b is conspicuously lowest in " winter " ; but no one of the four columns of Greenwich results gives so distinct an excess in the equinoctial over the summer value as appears at Kew , and , on the whole , we should infer that the equinoctial and summer values of b at Greenwich are practically equal .
At Greenwich , as at Kew , b/ a is distinctly smaller in summer than in the other seasons ; but the " winter " value of b/ a at Greenwich , instead of markedly exceeding the values for the other seasons , as at Kew , would seem to be if anything slightly smaller than the equinoctial .
On the whole , the variation of b/ a throughout the year at Greenwich is surprisingly small .
S 8 .
The H ranges in Mr. Ellis ' tables are expressed in terms of the value of H at Greenwich .
To make the results comparable with those for other stations , I have expressed the ranges in terms of lie as unit .
In doing so , I treated H as constant for each period , and as possessing the following values :\#151 ; Period .
Value of H. C.G-.S .
1841-96 .179 1865-96 .180 1889-96 .1829 Not knowing the exact procedure followed at Greenwich , I may not unlikely differ slightly from the exact values adopted there ; but , for the purpose of the present enquiry , such small uncertainty as may exist is immaterial .
The values of b/ a are , of course , independent of the unit adopted , The 1841-96 and 1865-96 data in Table III .
present some conspicuous differences ; a is larger in the former series than in the latter in every single month of the year , but b sliows exactly the opposite phenomenon in 9 months out of the 12 .
This BETWEEN SUN-SPOT FREQUENCY AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM .
implies a very conspicuous difference between the phenomena in years prior and subsequent to 1864 .
Not improbably the want of homogeneousness in the earlier data , already referred to , may be partly accountable for the apparent change .
At all events , the results for the final period , 1889-96 , show no distinct progressive diminution of a or increase of b as compared to the period 1865-96 .
In fact , the " all " day data for these two periods , and the " quiet " day data for the shorter period , give almost identical values for the mean b for the year .
As regards the seasonal phenomena , each set of Greenwich data makes b conspicuously least , but b/ a conspicuously largest , in " winter .
" The December value of b is invariably the smallest .
The " all " and " quiet " day data for 1889-96 , as already stated , give very nearly the same mean value of b for the year , but the " quiet " days ' value for bis much the larger of the two in winter , and the smaller in summer .
The " quiet " day data at Greenwich present a remarkable similarity to the corresponding Kew data , as is best seen by comparing the seasonal values for b/ a. The fact , however , that the absolute values of both a and b are some 10 per cent , higher at Greenwich than at Kew is rather suggestive of some misapprehension as to the scale values at one or both observatories .
S 9 .
In cases such as the present , a comparison of calculated and observed values is useful .
The Greenwich data do not lend themselves very readily to this , as Mr. Ellis does not give mean values for individual years , and the interest attaching to such a comparison for individual months of the year seems hardly sufficient to justify the necessary labour .
In ( A ) , S 75 , some results were given for individual months of the year at Kew , but none for the year as a whole .
This information is accordingly now supplied in Table IV .
, so far as concerns the ranges and the sum of the 24 hourly differences from the mean in the mean diurnal inequalities for the year in the several elements .
The calculated values are derived from the values given for a and b in ( A ) Table XLIV .
From the mathematical standpoint the nicety of agreement is best judged by considering the last line in Table IV .
, which shows what percentage the probable error in a calculated value is of the total variation exhibited by the element in the 11-year period .
For practical purposes the mean difference between the calculated and observed values , and the percentage it forms of the absolute mean value of the element , are , however , fully as important .
It will be seen that the agreement is about equally good for the ranges and for the sum of the 24 differences .
It is , on the whole , slightly better for D and H than for V and I. Table IV.\#151 ; Kew ( Units V for Angles , 1 for Force Components ) .

Magnetic observations at the three Russian magnetic observatories at Pawlowsk , Katharinenburg , and Irkutsk are published very nearly on parallel lines under the auspices of the Central Physical Observatory at St. Petersburg .
The results are very complete , and are kept well up to date .
For the present enquiry I have selected Pawlowsk and Katharinenburg .
The former is , I believe , the furthest north magnetic observatory which has been in continued existence for any length of time .
Its results include very full details of diurnal maxima and minima , and of the amplitudes of movements in magnetic storms .
They are not confined to " all " days , but give in addition full particulars for selected " quiet " days , or " normal " days as they were called by Wild , to whom the idea of their separate treatment is due .
I have treated the Pawlowsk data for the 11 years 1890 to 1900 by the method of groups , taking the same combination of years as for Kew , viz. , 1892 to 1895 for sunspot maximum , and 1890 , 1899 , and 1900 for sun-spot minimum .
Table V. refers to the ranges from the mean diurnal inequalities for the several months of the year , both from " all " and " quiet " days .
The seasonal and yearly values of a and b are arithmetic means from the included months , and these arithmetic means are employed in calculating the seasonal and yearly values of b/ a. VOL. CCI Table V.\#151 ; ( Units 1 ' for Angles , lie for Force Components .

Table V. presents several novel features .
In the declination we see a conspicuous difference between the variation of a throughout the year on \#163 ; C all " and on " quiet " days .
In December and January the " all " day value of a is more than double the " quiet " day value , and the excess of the " all " day value is also prominent in November and February .
On the other hand , the " quiet " day value of a is , in general , distinctly the larger throughout the equinoctial and summer months .
There is no such prominent difference between the " all " and " quiet " day values of b for declination .
There are , of course , conspicuous differences in one or two individual months , hut the seasonal and yearly values are closely alike .
The rise of b/ a in winter and its fall in summer are conspicuous , especially in the " quiet " days , where the phenomenon is even more prominent than at Kew .
The mean values of b/ a for the year from " all " and from " quiet " days are in close agreement with one another and with the corresponding Kew value .
In H the seasonal and yearly values of a in " all " and in " quiet " days are much alike .
The winter and equinoctial values of b in the two cases are also nearly equal , but in summer the " quiet " day value is very decidedly the smaller .
The mean " all " day value of b for the year is distinctly larger than the " quiet " day value , which is itself slightly in excess of the corresponding Kew value .
The excess of b/ a in winter is conspicuous in both " all " and " quiet " days ; in the latter case the variation of b/ a throughout the year is pretty similar to that at Kew .
In V the " all " and " quiet " day phenomena are vitally different .
The fact that the mean diurnal range during the 11-year period for the " quiet " days was barely 40 per cent , of that for " all " days prepares one for a material difference between the phenomena in the two cases , but hardly for the " all " day mean yearly value of b being more than six times the corresponding " quiet " day value .
The " quiet " day value of a for summer is not much less than the " all " day value , but in the equinoctial and winter months the latter greatly predominates .
The value of b is greatest at the equinox in both " all " and " quiet " days ; in fact , in " all " days the summer value of b falls short of the winter value , notwithstanding a marked depression in December and January .
The variation of b/ a throughout the year on " quiet " days is somewhat irregular .
In " all " days we have the fall in summer and rise in winter seen at Kew , hut there is a prominent depression in December and January .
As regards the absolute magnitudes of b and b/ a , the " quiet " day data are much closer than the " all " day to the Kew results .
Table V. gives only " all " day data for I , as no " quiet " day data for this element seem to be published .
Here again the phenomena resemble those observed at Kew , b being conspicuously small in winter and b/ a small in summer .
The values of a and b are , on the whole , distinctly larger than at Kew ( where the diurnal range of I is less than at Pawlowsk ) , hut the mean value of b/ a for the year is 105 X 10"4 as compared with 111 X 10-4 at Kew .

The Pawlowsk tables give for each month the mean of the differences between the daily maxima and minima , irrespective of their time of occurrence .
The range thus obtained is , of course , larger than that from the mean diurnal inequality for the month , and is a quantity considerably more influenced by magnetic disturbances .
The mean of the 12 monthly means may be regarded as the mean for the year of the absolute ranges in individual days .
This is the quantity to which the results in the first line of Table VII .
apply .
The figures in the second line refer to the mean of the 12 monthly ranges , a monthly range being defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values recorded during the month .
The third line in the table refers to the annual range , i.e. , the difference between the highest and lowest values recorded during the year .
Owing to occasional losses of trace , monthly and annual ranges are sometimes under-estimated , especially at times of large disturbance .
Both quantities are mainly dependent on the amplitude of disturbances ; the mean monthly range is the better measure of the generally disturbed character of the year .

C. CHREE : AN ENQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP S 14 .
If we compare the results for the mean daily range in Table VII .
with those for the range of the diurnal inequality in Table VI .
, we see that , though the values of a in Table VII .
are about double those in Table VI .
in the case of D and H , the increase in b is relatively so much greater that the values of b/ a in Table VII .
are some 40 per cent , in excess of those in the earlier table .
This means that the amplitude of magnetic disturbance is in general more enhanced relatively in years of sun-spot maximum than is that of the regular diurnal inequality .
The great rise in b/ a as we pass from the mean daily to the mean monthly range in Table VII .
is evidence of the same fact .
That this rise in is not continued , except in H , as we pass from the mean monthly to the annual range , is at least consistent with the view that the incidence of exceptionally large magnetic storms is determined by causes of which sun-spot frequency is no exact measure .

The calculated values of H and Y employed in Table VIII .
for the inequality ranges were taken only to the nearest lie , because the Pawlowsk tables go no nearer than this ; but in the " all " days ' D and I , both tables and calculation go to 0'*01 .
The agreement between calculated and observed values is much closer in D , H , and I than in Y ; and in D and H it is considerably closer for the " all " day than the " quiet " day results .
Probably this only means that the fewness of the " quiet " days ( sometimes only two or three a month ) introduces an element of uncertainty which more than neutralises the effect of the greater regularity in these days .
S 16 .
If the range of magnetic elements were largely dependent on influences which did not proceed pari passu with sun-spot frequency , then what we should expect to see in Table VIII .
would be a notable occurrence of large + values in all the elements in some years , and of large \#151 ; values in other years .
The same result would follow if , while an intimate connection subsisted , it were not of the linear type assumed in ( 1 ) .
So far as the inequality ranges in D , H , and I are concerned , there is no indication of such a phenomenon .
There is indeed an excess of -f- signs from 1890 to 1894 and of \#151 ; signs from 1895 to 1899 , but the differences themselves are small , and those for the " all " and the " quiet " days show no kind of regular relationship .
In the case , however , of the " all " day Y inequality , and of the absolute daily ranges for all the elements , especially H and Y , the observed values are conspicuously in excess of the calculated in 1892 , and as conspicuously below them in 1893 .
This phenomenon seems due beyond a doubt to the influence of the disturbance element .
S 17 .
With a view to further elucidation of the phenomenon described in the last paragraph , I have placed side by side in Table IX .
data as to the mean value for each year of a variety of quantities which are affected in different degrees by magnetic disturbance .
The small figures in brackets attached to the annual figures show the position which the year in question would occupy on a list which followed the order of magnitude of the quantity in question .
If two yearly items are equal , a common number is attached .
In the case of the years themselves , the attached figures indicate the order when the arrangement follows sun-spot frequency .
It should , however , be noticed that the excess of sun-spot frequency in 1898 over 1897 was very trifling , and that the differences between 1899 , 1900 , and 1890 were not large .
In the case of the diurnal inequalities in D and H , quantities but little affected by disturbance , 1893 heads the list , just as it does in sun-spot frequency .
In the case of the mean daily range\#151 ; a quantity more influenced by disturbance\#151 ; 1892 and 1894 come to the front , and 1893 falls to the fourth place .
Coming to the mean of the monthly ranges , we see 1892 and 1894 still more in advance , while in the case of II and Y 1893 stands lower than 1898 , a year of less than one-third its sun-spot frequency .
In the case of the annual range , 1893 has fallen to the eighth place in D and ninth place in Y , whilst 1898 mounts to the third or even the second place .
In the mean daily , mean monthly , and annual ranges , 1892 and 1894 are as conspicuously in excess of what one would expect from sun-spot frequency as 1893 and 1895 are below it .
Thus when we treat these four years as a unit , and compare it with a similar unit made up of the three years 1890 , 1899 , and 1900 , we may arrive at a conspicuous connection between sun-spot frequency and amplitude of disturbance ; but at the same time there is a marked absence of the close and regular connection in individual years which characterises the inequality ranges in D , H , and I.

It was pointed out in ( A ) , SS74 and 75 , that whilst an intimate general connection between sun-spot frequency and diurnal magnetic ranges is unmistakable , it is open to doubt whether the mean values of these quantities for so short a period as a single month can be regarded as directly interconnected .
If both phenomena proceed from a common cause whose intensity of action at a given instant varies throughout the solar system , then it might possibly be better to compare monthly magnetic ranges with sun-spot frequency for a longer overlapping period .
As shown in ( A ) , Table I. , the mean sun-spot frequency for individual months of the year from the period 1890 to 1900 varied from 35'0 in November and 35'5 in March to 45'4 in June and August .
Clearly , if the connection between sun-spot frequency and magnetic range is of the more general kind indicated above , the values we have found for b and 5/ a at Kew and Pawlowsk will be too large in months such as November and March and too small in months such as June and August .
To obtain an outside estimate of the uncertainty thus existing , I have calculated values for a , b and b/ a for the " quiet " day Pawlowsk data , employing Wolfer 's BETWEEN SUN-SPOT FREQUENCY AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM .

6-48 452 70 22-0 211 96 7-0 " 45 65 So far as the mean yearly and winter values of and are concerned , Tables Y. and X. are in practical agreement , but the equinoctial values of b in Table X. are decidedly lower , and the summer values decidedly higher , than the corresponding quantities in Table Y. The fact that the equinoctial values of b/ a for D and H in Table X. fall slightly below the summer ones seems hardly likely a 'priori to be a natural phenomenon , and it is not in accordance with the results obtained for Greenwich , in Tables II .
and III .
, from the longer periods , where the variation of the mean sun-spot frequency from month to month is naturally less than in 1890 to 1900 .
S 19 .
The effect of the substitution of the smoothed sun-spot frequencies on the values of b and b/ a from month to month is most easily followed by expressing the monthly values as percentages of their mean for the 12 months .
Table XI .
gives the mean of the results thus obtained for D and H , employing smoothed and observed sun-spot frequencies for the " quiet " days , and observed frequencies for the " all " days .
The employment of smoothed frequencies for the " all " days would alter the results to about the same extent as it does in the " quiet " days .
The substitution of the smoothed for the observed sun-spot frequencies for " quiet " days removes an isolated prominence shown by the b variation in March , and removes slight depressions in June and August , but it produces a depression in September and adds materially to an already conspicuous prominence in May .
Also the June depression and the March prominence are not apparent in the " all " day b variation using the observed sun-spots , and if we used smoothed frequencies for the " all " days we should have a marked depression in March and a largish prominence in June .
The b/ a variation throughout the year proceeds most regularly when we use the observed frequencies .

In D , b appears decidedly less at Katharinenburg than at Pawlowsk , especially in winter .
The dip in the December and January values of b in Table XII .
is particularly striking .
The summer and equinoctial values of at Katharinenburg are very similar to those at Kew and Pawlowsk , but the winter value is much less , owing to the low values in December and January .
In H the mean b for the year is close to the Kew value , but the winter values of b and b/ a are distinctly lower than at Kew and Pawlowsk .
In V , Katharinenburg occupies an intermediate position between the " all " and the " quiet " day results for Pawlowsk The mean value of b for the year in Table XII .
is little over half the corresponding " all " day value at Pawlowsk , but it is more than thrice the " quiet " day value at Pawlowsk , and double that at Kew .

168 In IT the values of b in Table XIII .
are on the average about double those in Table XII .
, but owing to the large values of a in Table XIII .
the excess in its values for b/ a is not striking , except in winter .
In V the values of a and b are again much larger in Table XIII .
than in Table XII .
, but the seasonal and yearly values of b/ a in the two are closely similar .
In Table XIII .
the December and January values of b/ a are conspicuously low in all the elements as compared to the values for November and February .

Table XIV .
gives results for the range from the mean diurnal inequality for the year ( corresponding to the Pawlowsk data in Table VI .
) , for the mean of the absolute daily ranges for the year ( corresponding to the first line of Table VII .
) , for the mean of the 12 monthly ranges , and for the yearly range .
The results for the second of these quantities , though practically accordant with those in the last line of Table XIII .
, are not absolutely identical .
The figures in Table XIII .
represent arithmetic means of a and b resulting from applications of formula ( 1 ) to individual months of the year .
Table XIV .
assumes the 12 monthly mean ranges for each year to be meaned , and these means dealt with by a single application of formula ( l ) .
The last two quantities dealt with in Table XIV .
do not in reality accord very closely with the linear formula ( l ) , but the figures at all events supply , as in the correBETWEEN SUN-SPOT FREQUENCY AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM .
sponding case at Pawlowsk , a rough measure of the amplitude of the fluctuation throughout a sun-spot period .
In all the elements included in Table XIV .
, as we pass from the range of the diurnal inequality to the mean absolute daily range , and thence to the mean monthly range\#151 ; quantities increasingly influenced by magnetic storms\#151 ; we see that whilst a increases , b increases in a greater ratio , so that b/ a notably rises .
The fall of b/ a as we pass from the mean monthly to the annual ranges in D and V may not improbably possess no real significance , but a similar phenomenon , it should be remembered , presented itself in the corresponding Pawlowsk results in Table VII .

Table XV .
shows the excess of observed over calculated values at Katharinenburg ; it answers to Table VIII .
for Pawlowsk .
The results for the diurnal inequalities in D , H , and I in Table XV .
are similar to the corresponding " all " day results in Table VIII .
, but on the whole show a slightly less close agreement between theory and observation .
In V , however , the agreement is distinctly better at Katharinenburg than at Pawlowsk .
In the case of the absolute daily range the agreement between observed and calculated values is particularly good in I ) , and it is closer in all the elements than at Pawlowsk .
This may be ascribed to the fact that magnetic disturbances are larger at Pawlowsk than at Katharinenburg .
The difference between the observed and calculated values in the monthly range is somewhat large , and there is now clear indication that sun-spot frequency is not by itself a sufficient guide .
The observed values in 1893 are conspicuously below , and those in 1892 and 1894 conspicuously above , the calculated .
The deficiency in the observed values in 1895 and the excess in 1898 are also marked .
Even in the absolute daily range in Table XV .
there is a distinct depression in the observed values in 1893 and corresponding enhancement in 1892 , though not to the same extent as in the corresponding case at Pawlowsk ( see Table VIII .
) .

Table XVI .
supplies disturbance data at Katharinenburg , corresponding to those given in Table IX .
for Pawlowsk .
If we compare the 11-year means in the two tables we see convincing proof of the remark already made that Pawlowsk is more disturbed than Katharinenburg , the mean ranges in Table IX .
being roughly double those in Table XVI .
The small bracketed figures in Table XVI .
have the same significance as those in Table IX .
According to the mean monthly range\#151 ; probably a better criterion than the annual range \#151 ; 1893 would seem to have been relatively less quiet at Katharinenburg than at Pawlowsk , but it stands much below 1892 and 1894 .
Whilst , however , all the Pawlowsk data made 1892 more disturbed than 1894 , the monthly ranges at Katharinenburg give the first position to 1894 .
In all the columns 1890 appears as the least disturbed year .
The monthly ranges\#151 ; though not the annual ranges\#151 ; assign to 1900 and 1899 the two next lowest places , the same positions as they occupy according to sun-spot frequency .
But , as at Pawlowsk , 1895 is less disturbed , and 1898 much more disturbed than they should be if sun-spot frequency were the sole criterion .

Prior to the introduction of electric tramways in 1899 the magnetic results at Batavia Observatory were treated with great completeness in the annual Batavia ' Magnetical and Meteorological Observations .
' Up to the end of 1900 the D and H results seem to have suffered comparatively little , but the V results even then were too disturbed for publication .
The Batavia magnetic records go back to 1882 , but are incomplete until 1884 .
Inspection of the vertical-force data for 1884 and 1885 created some misgivings , which gathered force from an editorial statement that the scale value in that element was at first very variable and remained so until a new magnet was introduced .
After considering all the circumstances , 1 decided to confine myself to the results for the 12 years 1887 to 1898 , coming down to the latest time at which all the elements were free from electric-tram effects .
This period has the advantage of supplying a sun-spot minimum group of years 1887 to 1890 equal in length to the sun-spot maximum group 1892 to 1895 .
The Batavia tables give not merely the hourly values , but also the sum of the 24 differences from the mean , in the monthly diurnal inequalities .
In ( A ) I found the sum of the 24 differences in D and H to show the sun-spot connection even more prominently than the ranges .
Accordingly I decided to use the sum of the 24 differences at Batavia , in preference to the ranges , when dealing with the diurnal inequalities for the individual months , and to employ the sum of the 24 differences as well as the ranges when dealing with the mean diurnal inequalities for the year .
S 26 .
Before giving the results , I would draw attention to a feature wherein Batavia differs widely from European stations .
At Kew , for instance , D , H , V , and I all show a large variation in the amplitude of the diurnal inequality throughout the year .
The range is three or four times as large at midsummer as at midwinter , and the way in which the range , or the sum of the 24 differences , varies throughout the year is pretty similar for all the elements .
Thus , assuming that the mean diurnal inequality for the year were derivable from a potential , one could obtain a fair first approximation to the mean diurnal inequalities for individual months by multiplying this potential by appropriate numerical factors .
How exceedingly far this is from being the case at Batavia will be seen on inspection of Table XVII .
This gives the sum of the 24 differences in the diurnal inequalities for each month of the year , with their mean , and the sum of the 24 differences in the mean diurnal inequality for the year .
Batavia being in the Southern hemisphere , May to August are the " winter'7 months .
The D data in Table XVII .
proceed , on the whole , like European data .
In V , too , the lowest value occurs in the winter months , but there is likewise a low value in December .
While the average value for I from the four winter months is below the mean for the year , the lowest values of all occur in November and December .
In H , three out of the four winter months show values above the average , while the four summer months are all below the average .
Thus no two elements behave alike , and the phenomena exhibited by H are more nearly opposite than parallel to those observed in high latitudes .

I he results pointed out in the last paragraph help to explain some novel features in Table XVIII .

In I ) and V the lowest values of a are found in winter , but in H and 1 the lowest values occur in November and December , that is , at midsummer .
In D and V , again , b is distinctly below the average in winter , though not nearly to the same extent as in Europe , and the winter value for I is less than the summer value ; but in H the winter value exceeds the summer .
In D , b/ a is distinctly smaller in summer than in the other seasons ; but in I , H and V the summer value is a trifle the highest .
The winter and equinoctial values of b/ a are almost identical in all the elements .
As compared to northern stations , the variation in b/ a throughout the year is exceedingly small .

In applying the method of groups , it is evidently desirable that one group of years should fall near the middle of the period dealt with , and that part of the second group should precede , and part follow it .
This arrangement helps to eliminate any long-period variation , or any gradual change in the conditions .
The period 1887 to 1898 being by no means ideal in the above respect , in dealing with the diurnal inequality for the year , I have employed both the method of least squares and the method of groups .
If large differences had presented themselves between the results from the two methods , it would have become necessary to reconsider Table XVIII .
As the question of the reliance to he placed on the method of groups is important , I give the results from both methods in Table XIX .
The agreement , it will be seen , is least good in D , hut it will , I think , be allowed that even there it leaves little to be desired .

In the case of I , H and V the values of a , b and bja given in Table XIX .
for the sum of the 24 differences in the mean diurnal inequality for the year do not differ much from the yearly mean in Table XVIII .
In the case of D , however , the results in the two tables are widely different , the a in Table XVIII .
being nearly 40 per cent , in excess of that in Table XIX .
The closeness of the values of a in the two tables in I , FI and V , and their divergence in the case of D , is what we might anticipate from the figures for the sums of the 24 differences in the last two lines of Table XVII .
The real inference to be drawn is that in D the hours of maximum and minimum vary somewhat widely from month to month , though apparently to a smaller extent in years of sun-spot maximum than in years of sun-spot minimum .
The data in Table XIX .
for Batavia correspond exactly to those given for Kew in ( A ) , Table XLIV .
In D the Batavia value of b for the 24 differences is almost exactly the third of the Kew value ; in the case of the ranges the Batavia value is relatively larger , but still less than half that at Kew , Greenwich or Pawlowsk .
The D values of b/ a , however , at Batavia and Kew are nearly equal .
In I the Batavia value of bis 70 per cent , larger than the Kew in the case of the ranges , and almost exactly double in the case of the 24 differences .
The Batavia BETWEEN SUN-SPOT FREQUENCY AN1 ) TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM , I 77 values of a , however , so much exceed the Kew that is more than twice as big at Kew as it is at Batavia .
In H the Batavia values of b are both roughly 50 per cent , in excess of the Kew , but the Kew values of b/ a are more than 50 per cent , in excess of those at Bata via .
In V the values of b are again very much larger at Batavia than at Kew ; in the 24 differences the Batavia value of b/ a is somewhat the higher , but in the ranges it is slightly the lower .
S 30 .
The relation between the values found for is probably the best measure of the relative importance of the sun-spot connection in any two cases .
Applying this criterion to the 24 differences and range results obtained by least squares in Tables XIX .
, we obtain the following values for the ratio of ( b/ a ) from sum of 24 differences : ( b/ a ) from ranges :\#151 ; Declination .

) is IT9 .
Thus the greater variability of the sum of the 24 differences with sun-spot frequency observed at Kew is also seen at Batavia , and to approximately the same extent .

The results should be compared with those given for Kew and Wilhelmshaven in ( A ) , Table XLII .
, though the slight difference in the method of obtaining the Kew results should be noted .
In I , H and Y the values of b/ a in Table XX .
are nearly alike in c1 and c3 , and they approach fairly closely to the corresponding values in Table XIX .
applicable to the ranges of the mean diurnal inequalities .
In declination and total force , however , the values of b/ a in Table XX .
are decidedly higher for than for c3 .
This phenomenon was observed at both Kew and Wilhelmshaven in the case of the declination and the westerly component .

Disturbances have special attention paid them at Batavia .
Following a practice , of which Sabine was an advocate , a reading at Batavia is regarded as disturbed when its difference from the mean reading at that hour during the month reaches or exceeds a certain limit .
The limiting values adopted at Batavia , are B*3 in D and lly in H and Y. The arbitrary nature of such criteria , and the difficulty of justifying one limiting value in preference to another , have been more than once pointed out .
It is arguable that the limit should vary with the season of the year , and even with the sun-spot frequency .
In a European station , for instance , the range of the regular diurnal inequality near sun-spot maximum at midsummer is very large compared to that near sun-spot minimum at midwinter , and a good deal might be said for a limiting value which bore a fixed ratio to the range from the mean diurnal inequality for the month .
The disturbed values which exceed the hourly mean , and those which fall below it , are termed respectively " positive " and " negative " disturbances ; they are in the first instance treated separately at Batavia , tables being given of the sum of the values of the disturbances and of their number .
A final summary gives the aggregates of the positive and negative totals treated numerically .
Table XXI .
gives these aggregate values and numbers as published in the annual Batavia ' Observations .
' The number of disturbances in D is less than half that in Y , and little over a quarter that in H. We cannot , however , draw any safe inference as to one element being absolutely more or less disturbed than another .
If we calculate the ratios borne by the disturbance limits accepted at Batavia to the mean ranges of the diurnal inequalities for the year in the respective elements , for the period 1887 to 1898 , we find the following results :\#151 ; BETWEEN SUN-SPOT FREQUENCY AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM .

Disturbance limit range 0-41 0-22 0-30 If instead of the ranges from the mean diurnal inequality for the year we had taken the arithmetic mean of the 12 monthly inequality ranges , we should have obtained a somewhat smaller fraction in the case of D. But the figures are at least suggestive that the explanation of the great difference in the number of disturbances in D , H , and Y may be largely due to the disturbance limit being less exacting in one element than another .

On examining Table XXI .
it will he seen that the number and aggregate value , though generally increasing or decreasing together , are far from being in a constant ratio in any of the elements .
As to which is the better measure of disturbance , opinions may well differ ; but the aggregate values constitute probably the nearest parallel to the Pawlowsk and Katharinenburg data in Tables IX .
and XVI .
According to both numbers and aggregate values , 1893 was less disturbed than 1892 or 1894 , hut its relative quietness is not so conspicuous , especially in D and V , as it was at Pawlowsk or even Katharinenburg .
Table XXI .
must , of course , receive contributions\#151 ; at least , in the case of H and Y\#151 ; from a number of days which are not days of large disturbance ; but if this were the true explanation , we should expect the position of 1893 at Batavia and Pawlowsk to differ more in the case of H than in that of D , which is the reverse of what happens .
S 34 .
Table XXII .
gives values of a , and b/ a calculated for the data in Table XXL The value of b/ a answering to the " aggregate value " is in each case greater than that answering to the " number " ; and , except in the case of Y , both values of b/ a are considerably higher than the corresponding yearly values in Tables XYIII .
and XIX .
If we compare Table XXII .
with Table XIY .
for Katharinenburg , we see that in Y the Batavia disturbance values of b/ a are much less than the lowest value of b/ a at Katharinenburg , viz. , that for the diurnal inequality .
In H the Batavia disturbance values of b/ a are similar to the value of in the absolutely monthly range at Katharinenburg .
In D , however , the Batavia disturbance values of b/ a are much in excess of any corresponding value at Katharinenburg .
The way in which disturbance influences the records at the two places are thus widely different .

Table XXIII .
compares observed and calculated values in the mean diurnal inequality for the year at Batavia , and in the aggregate value of the disturbances .
The values employed for a and b in the case of the ranges are those calculated by least squares .
The nicety of agreement in the case of the ranges is very similar to what has been already observed at Kew , Pawlowsk and Katharinenburg ; and , as at Kew , the agreement is practically the same for the 24 differences as for the ranges .
As has been generally observed elsewhere , the agreement is least good in the case of Y. In the case of the aggregate value of the disturbances , the agreement is pretty similar to what was found for the mean of the absolute monthly ranges at Katharinenburg ; and , as elsewhere , the failure of the formula to account satisBETWEEN SUN-SPOT FREQUENCY AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM .
factorily for the phenomena observed in 1892 and 1893 is conspicuous .
Unlike Pawlowsk and Katharinenburg , Batavia shows , however , no abnormal excess of disturbances in 1898 .

S 36 .
Owing to the novelty in some of the features of the Batavia results , examination of the data from a second tropical station seemed desirable .
I have accordingly made use of a number of tables of magnetic results* at Mauritius , published in a convenient form in 1899 .
In D , data are given for the period 1875 to 1890 , in II for 1883 to 1890 , and in V for 1884 to 1890 .
The shortness of the two latter periods , and the fact that the data are not contemporaneous with those for most of the other stations , are drawbacks , but there is small choice of magnetic data in low latitudes .
* 'Mauritius Magnetical Reductions , ' edited by T. F. Claxton , F.R.A.S. , Director Royal Alfred Observatory , Mauritius , 1899 , On examining the tables , I found that the mean D ranges in 1881 and 1882\#151 ; years of fairly large sun-spot frequency\#151 ; showed a remarkable depression , being only about half those in 1880 and 1883 , and in the preface I found the following editorial reference to some readjustment of the declination magnetograph in December , 1882 : " In the latter part of the year 1882 the effect of torsion on the magnetograph is very pronounced .
" As the phenomenal smallness of the range seems to have ceased with the readjustment , and as the Milan and Greenwich records show no parallel to the reduction of the ranges in 1881 and 1882 , I have omitted these years entirely from the calculations .
The Mauritius publication gives in special detail the mean value for each month and year of the absolute daily ranges .
These ranges seem based entirely on hourly readings , and so are not absolutely equivalent to the Katharinenburg ranges dealt with in Table XIII .
As the variation in these daily ranges throughout the year has exceptional features , 1 give particulars in Table XXIV .
There is a resemblance to phenomena at Batavia .
In D the variation in the range , though much less conspicuous than in Northern Europe , is well marked ; the values for the three midwinter months\#151 ; May , June , and July\#151 ; are well below the average .
In II the variation is small , and somewhat irregular ; on the whole , the range is smallest in winter , from May to August , but the next lowest values appear in February and December .
There is a distinct reduction in the V range near midwinter , but a very similar reduction occurs at midsummer .

The exceptional features presented by the September and October data in V had better be regarded provisionally as accidental .
In D and V we have b largest in winter and least at the equinox , a very remarkable feature .
Comparing Tables XXV .
and XIII .
, we see that whilst the mean values of a for the year are fairly similar , the values of b and of b/ a at Mauritius are roughly only from a half to a third of the corresponding values at Katharinenburg .

Table XXVI .
deals with the mean of the absolute daily ranges for the year , and with the ranges and the sums of the 24 differences in the mean diurnal inequalities for the year .
The grouping of the years is the same as for the previous table .
The values of a , b , and b/ a for the yearly mean of the absolute daily ranges do not agree quite so closely with the corresponding means of the 12 monthly values in Table XXV .
as was the case at Katharinenburg ( cf. Tables XIII .
and XIV .
) .
In H the values of a and b for the absolute daily range are about double those for the range of the diurnal inequality ; in D and V the differences between the two sets of values are smaller , but still considerable .
In all three elements the values of b/ a for the two species of ranges are fairly similar .
In the case of the mean diurnal inequality in D , the values of b are lower even than those given in Table XIX .
for Batavia , and the values of b/ a are the lowest we have yet met with .
The values of b for the ranges of the mean diurnal inequalities in H and V are much lower than at Batavia , but the values of b/ a at the two places are fairly similar .
The values of b/ a for the 24 differences do not show that decided excess over the values for the ranges that was seen at Kew and Batavia .

Table XXVII .
gives the differences between observed and calculated mean yearly data at Mauritius .
Comparing the figures in the last line of the table with the corresponding figures in Tables IV .

, XV .
, and XXIII .
, we conclude that the agreement is not quite so good at Mauritius as at the other stations .
The agreement is closest for the mean of the daily declination ranges , where it is very fair ; it is on the whole better for V than for H , which is exceptional .

A slight progressive decrease in a and increase in in the sun-spot formula ( l ) is suggested by the Greenwich D and H data from 1841 to 1896 , but this does not meet with support from Signor Uajna 's analysis of D ranges at Milan from 1836 to 1894 .
In both cases there is an element of uncertainty , arising from want ol homogeneousness in the data .
According to Rajna 's earlier data , values of , and to a lesser extent values of b , calculated from periods as long as 14 years may differ very sensibly from those calculated from longer periods , but differences of this kind seem to have diminished since observations became more homogeneous and are probably ascribable in part to observational uncertainties .
VOL. cciii.\#151 ; A. Results calculated for Milan from the period 1890 to 1900 , which is the period chiefly utilised in the present paper , differ but little from those found by Rajna for the periods 1836 to 1894 and 1871 to 1894 .
The tendency for b to be small in winter and large in summer , described at Kew , is also , in general , conspicuous elsewhere ; but there are exceptions , especially at tropical stations .
The tendency in b/ a to be large in winter as compared to summer , so prominent at Kew , is also , in general , prominent at other northern stations , but the phenomenon is comparatively inconspicuous in the case of the declination range at Greenwich .
At the tropical stations the seasonal change in appears much reduced and is somewhat uncertain .
There is no conspicuous difference between the " all " and the " quiet " days ' mean yearly values of b and b/ a for the ranges of the D and H diurnal inequalities at either Greenwich or Pawlowsk ; but at Pawlowsk there is a somewhat notable difference between " all " day and " quiet " day D results in winter , and the difference between " all " and " quiet " day V results is very large throughout the whole year .
If we exclude Mauritius , the values of 10 for the ranges in the mean diurnal inequality of declination for the year at the several stations vary only from 65 to 73 .
The corresponding values of b show also a pretty close agreement at the northern stations , but the values for the tropical stations are much smaller .
In H there is no very conspicuous difference in the values of b or b/ a for the ranges from the mean diurnal inequality for the year at the northern stations ; but the values found for b/ a at Batavia and Mauritius are considerably smaller , while the value found for b is smaller at Mauritius , but very materially larger at Batavia .
When the formula ( 1 ) is applied to any ordinary measure of magnetic disturbance , it gives much too high values for 1893\#151 ; the year of sun-spot maximum\#151 ; and much too low values for 1892 .
Thus the application of ( 1 ) to disturbances has not the same justification as its application to ordinary diurnal inequalities .
It may , however , serve a useful purpose in giving a greater degree of definiteness to the comparison of contemporaneous disturbance phenomena at the same or at different stations .
In the case of results obtained by the application of ( 1 ) to individual months of the year a considerable latitude must be allowed to chance , especially in winter months when the diurnal range is small , unless an exceptionally long series of observations is available .
Results obtained from arranging months in seasons are much less exposed to numerical uncertainties , but they are insufficient for the reason that there are conspicuous differences between months which have to be grouped under the same season .
This remark applies more particularly to winter and equinoctial months in higher latitudes .
