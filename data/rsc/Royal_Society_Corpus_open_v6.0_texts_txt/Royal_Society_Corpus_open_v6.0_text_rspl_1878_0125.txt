[ Jan. 23 , The ratio of the working effect of sodic to that of potassic sulphate , as calculated from the numbers given above , is iOO'16 : 100 , with a probable uncertainty of 1*3 per cent. This is the value , reckoned by the method of least squares , from the whole of the observations .
The rejection of the four experiments marked with an asterisk , which differ somewhat widely from the rest , would give the ratio 99'53 : 100 , with a probable nncertainty of 0*73 per cent. ; while the probable error of a single observation would then be reduced from 5'02 to 2 4 per cent. [ Owing to the number of determinations made , any error in the result is but very slightly affected by error in the ammonia estimation .
] The conclusions which we think may fairly be drawn from these numbers are:\#151 ; ( 1 .
) That sodic and potassic sulphates have a well-marked influence on the reaction to which we have referred ; ( 2 .
) That as more sulphate is added , the reaction is accelerated ; i ( 3 .
) That equal weights of sodic and potassic sulphates have as nearly as possible the same working effect .
The last conclusion may be otherwise expressed thus:\#151 ; If we represent our equivalent of potassic sulphate by a number , then the equivalent of sodic sulphate is represented by the same number .

Hydric Chloride and Sulphate .

Received December 4 , 1878 .
While carrying out our researches on lactin , * it struck us that use might be made of it to compare the dynamical equivalents of acid bodies .
We accordingly selected hydric chloride and hydric sulphate for the measurements in question , and prepared solutions of these acids , containing respectively 73 grammes hydric chloride ( 2HC1 ) , and 196 grammes hydric sulphate ( 2H2SO4 ) per litre .
An experiment was first tried with 5 grammes lactin and 10 cub. centims. of the hydric chloride solution in a total volume of 70 cub. centims. At a temperature of 17 ' C. there was no change of rotation in twenty-four hours .
In a second experiment a similar solution was raised for an hour to 40 ' C. , and then for an hour to 60 ' C. ; but without effect on the rotatory power .
The temperature of 100 ' 0 .
was finally adopted , the change at that point taking place at a rate admitting of accurate measurement .
The method of experiment was as follows : A measuring flask was made marked to contain 60 cub. centims. ; in this were placed 50 cub. centims. of a 10 per cent , solution of lactin ( i.e. , 5 grammes ) , the acid measured in , and the volume made up to * Pot , p. 273 .
1879.1 On Chemical Equivalence* the mark .
To prevent evaporation during heating , the neck of the flask was left long , and a narrow bent tube attached by an india-rubber joint .
The time was accurately noted when the flask was placed in the bath .
After half an hour , the flask was taken out quickly , plunged into cold water , and the contents when cold transferred to the polarimeter tube .
The tube used in the researches on lactin had to be modified in these experiments , the .
cement not being able to withstand the action of the acid .
In its altered form , the plate glass covers were secured by two screw rods and nuts , a thin washer of gutta-percha tissue being placed between the ends of the tube and the plates .
This washer did not materially affect the length of the column , and made the tube perfectly tight .
The length of the tube was thus reduced to 216 millims. The results of these experiments are given in the following table .
The quantity of acid is the only varied condition of experiment .
