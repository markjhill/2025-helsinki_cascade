] Being induced last autumn to suspect that the discordance in favour of parallax , before met with , might arise from variation of temperature , the author endeavoured last winter to keep the interior and exterior of the Observatory of the same temperature , which the mildness of the season easily enabled him to do .
From the 1st of July 1816 to March 1817 , the index error of the instrument suffered no variation ; and therefore the objections urged by Dr. Brinkley were done away .
Under these circumstances the observations of a Lyroe , y Draconis , a Cygni , and a Aquilke , showed no indication of periodical variation .
Whether the fixed instruments lately erected for this investigation will confirm the above result remains to be determined .
