Croonian Lecture .
On the anatomical structure of the Eye ; illustrated by microscopical drawings , executed by F. BAUER , Esq. By Sir EVERARD HOME , Bart. V. P. R. S. Read November 15 , 1821 .
HAAVING found an extraordinary advantage from Mr. BAUER S microscopical observations , when applied to anato .
mical investigations of other organs of animals , I requested him to give me his assistance in the examination of the different parts of the eye in the human species , quadrupeds , and birds .
In the first place , I wished him to ascertain whether the marsupium in the bird 's eye is muscular ; as I had advanced such an opinion in the Lecture for 1795 .
After the most careful examination , he has decided that it is not ; but is a fine vascular membrane , as represented in the annexed drawing , which Dr. YOUNG had long considered it The real structure of the marsupium being thus completely established , I was led to inquire what parts , contained within the globe of the eye , are possessed of muscular fibres .
Mr. BAUER , on examining the ciliary processes , found that the anterior layer is made up of about 80 processes , lying directly behind the iris , and with it firmly attached at the base to the choroid and sclerotic coat : these are membranous , very vascular , and the surface next the lens concave ; that next the iris , convex .
They are distinctly shown in the annexed drawings .
Between these membranous processes there are bundles of muscular fibres of 2-o of an inch in length , which I believe have not before been described : they originate all round from the capsule of the vitreous humor , pass forward over the edge of the lens , are attached firmly to its capsule and there terminate , as is seen in the drawings .
They are unconnected with the ciliary processes , or iris .
In the human eye , and that of the quadruped , they form bundles with intermediate spaces .
In the bird , they are nearly one continued layer of muscular fibres .
The choroid coat , which may be said to terminate anteriorly at the ciliary processes , is membranous in its structure ; so far similar to the marsupium of the bird when unfolded ; but in the choroid coat , Mr. BAUER has discovered lymphatic vessels , one on each side of every principal artery , not before ascertained , although there could be no doubt of their existence ; and the arteries , as will be seen in the drawings , have not the usual direction , but run parallel to one another , totally unlike those in the marsupium .
In the quadrupeds with the tapetum lucidum , the nigrum pigmentum is principally deposited between the sclerotic and choroid coat .
In the human eye and that of the bird , between the choroid coat and retina , a thin pellucid covering being interposed between it and the expansion of the optic nerve ; the marsupium has a similar covering between the nigrum pignientum and the vitreous humor .
The colour of the nigrum pigmentum differs in intensity according to the colour of the hair ; and when the animal is quite white , appears to be altogether wanting .
That the marsupial membrane secretes the nigrum pigmentum , there can be no doubt ; and for that purpose it is very abundantly supplied with large That the choroid in the human eye , as well as that of the bird does the same , is in some measure proved by the fine injection thrown into the arteries of that membrane escaping from their termination , so as to form a layer of injection behind the retina without the smallest appearance of extravasation .
The membrane between the nigrum pigmentum and retina , has been described by Dr. JAcoB , of Dublin , and his account of it published in the Philosophical Transactions .
The nigrum pigmentum appears to be nothing more than the colouring matter of the red globules , rendered black in the act of separation from the arteries ; it is also deposited upon the surface of the ciliary processes and iris , by the arteries with which they are loaded , and covered by a pellucid membrane .
In the horse , the arteries of the ciliary processes are very large ; and I am led to believe that the extraordinary disease that animal is liable to in India , of having two species of worms ( the strongylus armatus and filiaris papillosa ) found alive in the aqueous humor , is produced by the ova or young worms escaping from the terminations of those arteries ; more especially as Mr. HODGSON , in his engravings of diseased arteries , has figured the strongylus armatus adhering to the inner membrane of the superior mesenteric artery of the horse , showing that in that animal it gets into the circulation .
The iris is fixed at its origin to the annular ligament ; is divisible into two layers ; the posterior , muscular ; the fibres radiating towards the pupil , at which part there is a regular sphincter muscle ; the anterior , membranous .
My friend Mr. MAUNOIR , of Geneva , is , I believe , the first person who made out this structure , and gave an engraving of 78 _______________ ____________ ZYdlJ.yj)yrns.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-~121 ?

I have much pleasure in stating , that what he represented in the quadruped , corresponds with Mr. BAUER 's drawings from the human eye , made before Mr. MAUNOIR 's Treatise on the artificial pupil was shown to him .
The capsule of the crystalline lens is made up of two hemispheres of different texture , in which the lens is completely enclosed ; the anterior portion is more dense than the other .
The posterior is so thin , as to appear a continuation of the capsule of the vitreous humor , but from its curling up when cut , it must partake of the same nature as the anterior portion .
The vitreous humor consists of a very delicate gelatinous substance , exceedingly elastic , abundantly supplied with branches of vessels .
Arteries are sometimes met with carrying red blood , and in a degree capable of being injected .
The fibres of the lens have the appearance of hairs like those formed in spun glass .
The situation of the marsupium is shown both in the eagle and goose , and the difference of its radius of curvature at the bottom of the eye on its two sides , is as 70to -48th of an inch .
