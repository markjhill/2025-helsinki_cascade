On a remarkable Application of Cotes 's Theorem .
By J. F. W. Herschel , Esq. Communicated by W. Herschel , LL. D. F.R.S. Read November 12 , 1812 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1813 , p. 8 .
] This communication includes an application of Cotes 's theorem to 'conic sections in general ; but the application noticed in the title relates to the parabola in particular , and it may be thus enunciated .
If any number of radii vectores SP be drawn from the focus to the ceurve , making equal angles PSP with each other ; and if an equal 4Wg number of angles PS Q , QSQ be also taken , each equal to MS PI the angle which the first drawn radius makes with the axis , then will the continued product of all the radii SP be equal to the last SQ multiplied by the latus rectum raised to the power of n 1 , n being the number of angles taken .
The author thence proceeds to deduce other theorems that would be for the most part complicated and unintelligible when geometrically enunciated , though sufficiently simple in their algebraic expressions .
They are indeed , as the author observes , properties rather of the equations of the conic sections , than of the curves themselves ; properties of a limited number of disjoined points , determined according to a certain law , rather than of a series of consecutive points composing a line .
In the course of this investigation the author employs one species of notation , which is new , and for which he apologizes , by explaining its advantage in point of simplicity .
