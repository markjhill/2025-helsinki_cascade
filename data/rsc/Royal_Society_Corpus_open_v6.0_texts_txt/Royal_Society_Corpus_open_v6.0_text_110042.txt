] The elasticity of vapours , in contact with the liquids from which they are produced under high pressures in high temperatures , is known to increase in a higher ratio than the arithmetical one of the temperature ; but the exact law is not determined , and the loss of latent heat in compression , and the re-absorption in expansion , renders the advantage of steam under great pressure and at very high temperatures doubtful in an economical view .
No such doubt , however , exists in regard to those fluids which require very great compression for their existence , and where common temperatures are sufficient to produce an immense elastic force .
Thus sulphuretted hydrogen , which condenses into a liquid under a pressure of 14 atmospheres at 30 , had its elastic force increased so as to equal a pressure of 17 atmospheres by raising its temperature to 47 ? .
Liquid muriatic acid at 30 exerted an elastic force equal to the pressure of 20 atmospheres , at 250 = 25 atmospheres , and at 510 = 45 atmospheres .
After some experimental illustrations of the expansibility of the vapour of sulphuret of carbon at different temperatures , the author adverts to the possible application of the difficultly compressible gases , as mechanical agents , and to their power of producing cold by the rapidity of their evaporation .
