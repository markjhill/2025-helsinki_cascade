A Memoir on the Theory of Reciprocal Surfaces .
" By Professor CAYLLY , F.R.S. Received November 12 , 1868 .
( Abstract .
) The present Memoir contains some extensions of Dr. Salmon 's theory of Reciprocal Surfaces .
I wish to put the formulae on record , in order to be able to refer to them in a " Memoir on Cubic Surfaces , " but without at present attempting to completely develope the theory .
Dr. Salmon 's fundamental formulae ( A ) , ( B ) are replaced by a(n2)= r-B+ p+2-r , 6(n-2)= p+2+ 37y+3t , c(n-2)=2cr+43 ?
y+ 0 , a(n-2)(n-3)= 2(8-C ) +3(ac-3X ) +2 ( ab-2p -j ) , b(n2)(n -3)= 4k ( ab-2p-j)+3(bc-31 -y-i ) , c(n-2)(n-3)== 6+ ( ae -3o--X ) + 2(bc--3 , --y-i ) , where j , 0 , X , B , C refer to singularities not taken account of in his theory ; viz. j is the number of pinch-points on the nodal curve 0 , X , the numbers of certain singular points on the cuspidal curve , C the number of conic nodes , B the number of biplanar nodes : the reciprocal singularities j ' , 0 ' , X ' , * Proceedings of the Royal Society , 1868 , p. 425 .
B , C ' , are of course also considered .
An equation of Dr. Salmon 's is presented in the extended form , '--4n(n-2)-8b--1 lc-2j'3X'-2C'-4B ' ; and it is remarked that o ' denotes the order of the spinode-curve .
The Memoir contains an entirely new formula giving the value of P ' , but some of the constants of the formula remain undetermined .
