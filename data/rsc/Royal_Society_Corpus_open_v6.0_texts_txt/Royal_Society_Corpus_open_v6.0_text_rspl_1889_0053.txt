But the death-roll of the year , which according to our custom is read by the Senior Secretary at our annual meeting , is on this occasion unusually heavy , and the list recalls to us several who have taken an active part in the ordinary work of the Society , and some whose names will be prominently remembered by posterity .
Warren de la Rue , who has repeatedly served on the Council and Committees of the Society , was one of the early pioneers in the application of photography to the delineation and measurement of celestial objects , an application which has now received such great extension .
He was one of the party who went to Spain , in 1860 , to observe a total solar eclipse , and he took up the department of observation by photography .
His results formed the subject of a Bakerian lecture , and are published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1862 .
They threw much light on the subject of the solar prominences , then , we may say , in its infancy .
He devoted much attention to the subject of Sun-spots , and constructed an elaborate machine for their measurement on photographic negatives under the microscope .
Several of our Fellows have had the opportunity of seeing the beautiful experiments on electric discharges in rarefied gases which he carried out by means of his magnificent battery of 15,000 chloride of silver cells , the use of which , with his usual urbanity , he accorded to men of science who might be desirous of investigating some point requiring the aid of so costly an appliance .
Charles James Blasius Williams , who died last March , at a very advanced age , was , with one exception , the senior of our Fellows , having been elected in 1835 .
For many years one of the most prominent physicians in London , after retirement from medical 2 li 2 A nniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , practice , in the evening of his days , he took np the examination of solar spots , and their possible relation to meteorology .
Stephen Parkinson was well known to Cambridge men as a mathematician , and was the author of several mathematical works in common use in the University .
John Percy was for more than forty years a Fellow of the Society , and has served on the Council .
Many years ago I was myself associated with him at the Government School of Mines , where we both were lecturers together .
He was a man of accurate knowdedge but of a retiring character , and is perhaps best known to the world through his excellent work on metallurgy , the value of which is evidenced by the fact of its having been translated both into French and German .
Owen Rees , also for more than forty years a Fellow of the Society , did good service in the application of chemistry to the elucidation of disease .
Miles Joseph Berkeley , who died at the advanced age of eighty-six , was distinguished as a cryptogamic botanist ; indeed in this branch of botanical science he was long looked up to as the leading authority .
Our late Fellow John Ball was fora long time intimately associated with the work of the Society .
Besides serving on the Council , he has very frequently assisted us on various Committees .
It will be recollected that he was associated with Sir Joseph Hooker in botanical exploration , and the two , at no little personal risk , ascended the Atlas range on the northern side , being the first Europeans who had penetrated so far .
Fond of travel , and of .
mountain climbing , he was led to take up the subject of botany ; and in relation to this science , as well as to meteorology and geology , he turned his travels to good account .
George West Royston-Pigott took up the subject of improvements in the microscope , specially as regards the correction of the residue of spherical aberration , and a paper of his on the subject is printed in the ' Philosophical Transactions .
' John Frederic La Trobe-Bate man , who died in June , will long be remembered for his important engineering works , especially in relation to the supply of water to large towns .
William Henry Bristow was associated with De la Beche , Edward Forbes , and other geologists in the early history of the Geological Survey , and remained in that department of the Civil Service of the country , in which he had been promoted to the post of Senior Director , almost up to the end of his life .
He particularly distinguished himself by the careful and detailed manner in which he carried out the mapping of the Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks of the South of England .
His maps and descriptions of that region have become classical in English geology .
Outside of his official work he President 's 1889 .
] published a few papers giving the results of his researches , and was also the author of a useful glossary of mineralogy , as well as of translations of popular geological works .
On the 21st of April , our late Fellow Robert Stirling Newall passed away at the age of eighty-seven .
Mr. Newall , as a successful manufacturer , is well known through the improvements which he effected in the construction of iron rope , which rendered him , we may say , one of the chief founders of an important branch of national industry , and through his success in the construction of those submarine cables which play so important a part in the conveyance of iutelligence all over the civilized world .
But he did not coniine himself to the industrial application of scientific principles ; he took a leading step in the development of the refracting telescope .
At the time of the Exhibition of 1862 , the largest refracting telescope in operation was the 16-inch one at Pulkowa .
Messrs. Chance , of Birmingham , placed in that exhibition two disks of optical glass , one of flint and one of crown , of far larger size , about 26 inches in diameter .
These Mr. hie wall , being possessed of ample means , purchased , with the intention of trying what could be done for astronomical observation by the use of a telescope far larger , of its kind , than had hitherto been used .
The construction was confided to Cooke , of York , so well known for the excellence of his optical work .
The instrument was erected at Mr. Newall 's residence at Gateshead , and is pronounced by competent judges to be of first-rate excellence .
The atmospheric conditions of Gateshead were not however favourable for the use of so grand an instrument ; and shortly before his death Mr. Newall offered it to the University of Cambridge .
This generous offer was referred , as is usual in such cases , to a Committee for report The Committee have issued a provisional report in which they testify to the excellence of the instrument , and recommend its acceptance ; but the final arrangements to be proposed are still under consideration .
By the death of James Prescott Joule , the Society has this year lost one of its Fellows whose name will go down to posterity in connexion with his memorable researches on the mechanical equivalent of heat .
The circumstances of his birth would naturally have led him to devote himself to commercial pursuits , but the bent of his mind , animated in early years by the instruction he received from the illustrious Dalton , led him to devote himself mainly to the pursuit of science .
As in the case of Faraday , his investigations were carried on without the aid of mathematics , at least of the higher mathematics .
But , like Faraday , he seemed to have a sort of intuitive apprehension of physical laws .
His early scientific studies led him into the domain of electricity , and its connexion with heat ; and he showed that when a voltaic current passes through a conducting wire the heat gene- 452 Anniversary .
[ Nov. 30 , rated in a given time varies as the resistance multiplied by the square of the current .
It was in connexion with magneto-electricity that his first determination was made of the mechanical equivalent of heat , which was confirmed later by its accordance with the equivalent as determined independently altogether of electricity , by measuring on the one hand the work given out by a descending weight , and on the other the heat generated by internal friction in a liquid in which that work was consumed in overcoming resistance .
While much may often be done towards discovering the laws of nature by merely qualitative experiments , the final testing of theories which we may have been led to form involves almost always accurate quantitative determinations .
Joule as an experimentalist was accurate in quantitative determinations , and his final number for the mechanical equivalent of heat is accepted as a fundamental constant in thermodynamics .
On account of the great importance of Joule 's labours , both directly , in the advancement of science , and indirectly , through the knowledge thus acquired , in enabling improvements to be made in the practical application of science for industrial purposes , it has been suef ?
esfe(l that it might be desirable to raise some public memorial to him , and the Council has appointed a Committee to consider the question .
Only yesterday our aged Fellow Martin Tupper passed away , who was the author of works which attained a very wide circulation .
I have referred , and that very briefly , to some only of the Fellows whom we have lost during the past year , but fuller details both of them , of other Fellows whom we have lost , and of our recently deceased foreign members will be found in the obituary notices which appear from time to time in the Proceedings , according as they are received from the Fellows who have kindly undertaken to draw them up .
Of those who last year were on our list of Foreign Members , we have since lost one who was truly a veteran in science .
More than three years have elapsed since the celebration of the centenary of the birth of M. Chevreul , and two more recurrences of his birthday came round before he was called away .
He will be known for his researches on the contrast of colours .
But his great work was that by which he cleared up the constitution of the fixed oils and fats , and established the theory of saponification .
Few scientific men still surviving were even born when this important research was commenced\#151 ; a research in the course of which he laid the foundation of the method now universally followed in the study of organic compounds , by showing that an ultimate analysis by itself alone is quite insufficient , and that it is necessary to study the substances obtained by the action of reagents on that primarily presented for investigation .
Our late Foreign Member Franz Cornelius Donders stood in the first 1889 .
] President 's A ddress .
rank among ike men of science of our day .
He was educated as an army surgeon ; but the bent of bis mind led him to scientific investigation , and he became one of the most eminent of physiologists as well as the most distinguished ophthalmologist of his day .
He contributed powerfully to the advance , not only of ophthalmology , but also of general physiological science ; for on whatever physiological subject he touched he left his mark , bringing as he did to bear on it an acute and original mind , thoroughly trained in physical and chemical principles , and a knowledge of the advances made by the foremost among his scientific contemporaries .
There is one whose name , though he was not a Fellow , I cannot pass by in silence on the present occasion .
I refer to Thomas Jodrell Phillips Jodrell , who died early in September , in his eighty-second year .
About the time of the publication of the reports of the Duke of Devonshire 's Commission , the subject of the endowment of research was much talked of , and Mr. Jodrell placed the sum of \#163 ; 6,000 in the hands of the Society for the purpose of making an experiment to see how far the progress of science might be promoted by enabling persons to engage in research who might not otherwise be in a condition to do so .
But before any scheme for the purpose was matured , the Government Grant for the promotion of scientific research was started , under the administration of Lord John Russell , then Prime Minister .
This rendered it superfluous to carry out Mr. Jodrell 's original intention , but he still left the money in the hands of the Society , directing that , subject to any appropriation of the money that he might make , with the approval of the Royal Society , during his lifetime , the capital should immediately upon his death be incorporated with the Donation Fund , and that in the meantime the income thereof should be received by the Royal Society .
Of the capital , \#163 ; 1,000 was several years ago assigned to a fund for the reduction of the annual payments to be made by future Fellows , and the remaining \#163 ; 5,000 has now of course been added to the Wollaston Donation Fund .
By the Fee Reduction Fund the annual payment of ordinary Fellows elected subsequently to the time of the change was made \#163 ; 3 instead of \#163 ; 4 , and the entrance fee abolished .
As to the Donation Fund , a very wide discretion was , by the terms of the original foundation , left in the hands of the Council as to the way in which they should employ it in the interest of science .
Since the Croonian Foundation for lectures was put on its present footing , it has been made the means of securing for us the advantage of a lecture delivered before the Society by distinguished foreign men of science .
In the present year our Foreign Member M. Pasteur was invited to deliver the lecture .
Unfortunately the state of Tiis health would not allow him to deliver it himself , but at one time'he hoped 454 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , that he would have been able to be present at its delivery .
It was ultimately arranged that his fellow labourer at the Pasteur Institute , Dr. Roux , should deliver the Croonian Lecture in his stead ; and several of the Fellows have heard his lucid account , first of the discoveries of M. Pasteur in relation to diseases brought about by microscopic organisms , and then further researches of his own in the same field .
In addressing the Fellows at the anniversary last year , I mentioned that Commandant Desforges had kindly offered to compare that portion of Sir George Schuckburgh 's scale , with reference to which the length of the seconds pendulum had been determined by Kater and Sabine , with the French standard metre ; and as the ratio of this to the English standai*d yard was accurately known , the length of the pendulum , as determined by these accurate observers , would thus for the first time be brought into relation with the English yard by direct comparison with accurately compared measures of length .
The comparison was shortly afterwards executed , and the scale , which of course was very carefully packed for its journey to Paris and back , has long since been replaced in the apartments of the Society .
This highly desirable comparison occupied but a few days in its execution ; which affords one example of the scientific advantages derivable , under an international agreement , from the establishment of the Bureau des Poids et Mesures .
Our own country , which for some years held aloof from the Convention , forming the sole exception to the general agreement among nations of importance , joined it some years ago ; and we thus have the privilege of availing ourselves as occasion may arise of the appliances at the office in Paris for such comparisons of measures of length or weight .
The services of Mr. Arthur Soper , as a special assistant , have been retained during the past session , with advantage to the library .
He has completed the much-needed shelf catalogue , and the rearrangement of the books where necessary .
In the course of this work the volumes of a purely literary character have been collected together , and a selection of the most valuable have been preserved in a properly protected case .
Of the remainder about 150 volumes ( in addition to those reported last year ) have been presented to various public libraries , and a slip catalogue of the volumes which are retained , containing about 1,700 entries , has been prepared .
The manuscripts ( other than the originals of ordinary papers read at the meetings ) which have accrued to the Society since the publication of Mr. Halliwell 's Catalogue have been collected from various parts of the building into the Archives Room , with the object of preparing a complete catalogue of the manuscripts at present in the possession of the Society .
President 's Address .
1889 .
] Since the last anniversary twenty-four memoirs have been published in the ' Philosophical Transactions , ' containing a total of 753 pages and 33 plates .
Of the ' Proceedings ' twelve numbers have been issued , containing 1062 pages and 6 plates .
Dr. R. von Lendenfeld 's ' Monograph of the Horny Sponges , ' mentioned in my last anniversary address , has also been issued during the year in a quarto volume of 940 pages of text and 51 plates .
The Pellows are aware that for a great many years the Royal Society has devoted a part of its funds to the collection , preparation for the press , and correction of the proofs of a Catalogue of Scientific Papers .
We have endeavoured to make the work as complete as possible , and to include scientific serials in all languages .
The first part , covering the period 1800 to 1863 , is printed in six thick quarto volumes , of which the last appeared in 1872 .
The decade 1864\#151 ; 1873 occupies two more volumes , of which the second was published in 1879 .
This work , in the preparation of which the Royal Society has spent a large sum , is for the benefit of the whole civilized world , and the sale of it could not be expected nearly to cover the cost of printing , paper , and binding .
On a representation to this effect being made to Government , when the first part was ready for the press , the Lords of the Treasury consented that it should be printed at the public expense , the proceeds of the sale of the work , after reserving a certain number of copies for presentation , being repaid to the Treasury .
In consideration of the large outlay involved in the preparation , those Fellows of the Society who wished to purchase the work could do so at about two-thirds of the cost to the general public .
A similar application to the Treasury with reference to the decade 1864-1873 met with a similar response , and we proceeded , as I mentioned at the anniversary last year , with the preparation of the manuscript for the next decade , 1874-1883 , which was then nearly ready .
On making application towards the end of last year to the Treasury for the printing of this decade , our request was not acceded to .
While declining , however , to continue any farther the printing of this great work , the sum of \#163 ; 1,000 was put in the Estimates , and has since been voted by Parliament , to assist us in the publication , and the copies of the work still remaining unsold have been handed over to us .
This has enabled us to conclude negotiations with Messrs. Clay and the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press for the printing of the decade last mentioned , and at the same time to make some provision towards the future continuation of the work , without , as it may be hoped , encroaching to a greater extent than hitherto on our own resources .
The utility of the work would obviously be much increased if it could be furnished with some sort of key enabling persons to find what had been written on particular subjects .
I am not without 456 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , hopes that this very desirable object may yet be accomplished , notwithstanding the magnitude of any such undertaking .
Within the last year the Council of the " Royal Society has accepted a duty in connexion with scientific agriculture , of which it will be interesting to the Fellows to be informed .
It is well known that for the last fifty years , or thereabouts , Sir John Lawes has carried out on his estate at Rothamsted an elaborate and most persevering series of experiments on the conditions which influence the growth and yield of crops of various kinds , the effect of manures of different kinds , the result of taking the same crop , year after year , from off the same land without supplying to it any manure , \amp ; c. Long as these experiments have , already been continued , there are questions , particularly as regards the capabilities of the sub-soil , which require for their satisfactory answers that similar experiments should be continued on the same land for a still longer period .
In respect of such questions , the investigator of the science of agriculture is in a position resembling that in which the astronomer is often placed , in having to make observations , the full interest of which it must be left to posterity to enjoy .
To prevent the interruption of these experiments , which it would take a life-time to repeat on fresh ground , and at the same time to provide for the carrying out of researches generally bearing on the science of agriculture , Sir John Lawes has created a trust , securing to the trustees a capital sum of \#163 ; 100,000 , and leasing to them for ninety-nine years , at a peppercorn rent , certain lands in his demesne on which the experiments have hitherto been carried on , together with his laboratory .
The trust is intended to be for original research , not for the instruction of students .
The general direction of the experiments and researches to be carried on is vested in a committee of management consisting of nine persons , of whom four are to be appointed by the President and Council of the Royal Society .
The trustees named in the deed were Sir John Lubbock , Dr. Wells , and our treasurer , Dr. Evans .
One of these is now no more .
Lord Walsingham has been appointed a trustee in place of the late Dr. Wells .
The Copley Medal for the year has been awarded to Dr. Salmon for his various papers on subjects of pure mathematics , and for the valuable mathematical treatises of which he is the author .
Dr. Salmon 's published papers are all valuable .
Among others may be mentioned his researches on the classification of curves of double curvature , and on the condition for equal roots of an equation ; the very important theorem of the constant anharmonic ratio of the four tangents of a cubic curve ; his researches on the theory of reciprocal surfaces ; his paper on quaternary cubics .
But any notice of his contributions to the advancement of pure mathematics would be incoinPresident 's Address .
plete which did not specially mention his invaluable text-books on conic sections , higher plane curves , solid geometry , and the modern algebra\#151 ; works which not only give a comprehensive view of the subjects to which they relate , but contain a great deal of original matter .
Of the Royal Medals , it is the usual though not invariable practice to award one for mathematics or physics , including chemistry , and one for some one or more of the biological sciences .
No distinction is , however , made between the two medals in point of order of precedence , and I will , therefore , take the names of the medallists in alphabetical order .
The Council have awarded one of the Royal Medals this year to Dr. Walter Holbrook Gaskell for his researches in cardiac physiology , and his important discoveries in the anatomy and physiology of the sympathetic nervous system .
In his memoir , " On the Rhythm of the Heart of the Frog " ( Croonian Lecture , ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1882 ) , and in a subsequent memoir , " On the Innervation of the Heart of the Tortoise " ( ' Journ. of Physiol. , ' vol. 4 ) , Dr. Gaskell very largely advanced our knowledge of the physiology of the heart-beat , more especially as relates to the sequence of the beats of the several parts , the nature of the inhibitory action of the vagus nerve , and the relations of tonicity and conducting power to rhythmical contraction .
These memoirs , however , lacked completeness on account of their not taking into full consideration the action of the cardiac augmentor or accelerator fibres , the existence of which had been previously indicated in the case of mammals , and suspected in the case of the frog and allied animals .
By a striking experiment ( ' Journ. of Physiol. , ' vol. 5 ) Dr. Gaskell subsequently gave the first clear demonstration of the presence in the frog of cardiac augmentor fibres ; also he gave a clear account of the nature of the action of these fibres , and the relations of that action to the action of the vagus fibres .
Revising his previous work by the help of the light thus gained , Dr. Gaskell was enabled to give the first really consistent and satisfactory account of the nature of the heart-beat , of the modifications of beat due to extrinsic nerves , and of the parts played by muscular and nervous elements respectively .
Important as was this work on the heart , Dr. Gaskell 's subsequent work " On the Structure , Functions , and Distribution of the Nerves which govern the Vascular and Visceral Systems " ( 'Journ .
of Physiol. , ' vol. / ) has a far higher importance and significance .
In spite of the knowledge which during the past thirty or forty years has been gained concerning vaso-motor nerves and the nerves governing the movements of the viscera , physiologists had up to the time of the appearance of Dr. Gaskell 's memoir failed to obtain a clear conception 458 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , of the nature and relations of the so-called sympathetic nervous system .
By his researches , in which the several methods of gross anatomical investigation , minute histological examination , and experimental inquiry were , in a striking manner , made to assist each other , Dr. Gaskell , by tracing out the course and determining the nature of vaso-eonstrictor and vaso-dilator fibres , and comparing them with the cardiac augmentor and inhibitory fibres , and with the fibres governing the visceral muscles , has already reduced to order what previously was to a large extent confusion , and has opened up what promises to be the way to a complete understanding of the whole subject .
The results arrived at , besides their great physiological importance , on the one hand promise to be of great assistance in practical medicine , and on the other are eminently suggestive from a purely morphological point of view .
The other Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Thomas Edward Thorpe for his researches on fluorine compounds , and his determination of the atomic weights of titanium and gold .
Professor Thomas Edward Thorpe 's experimental work has secured for him a place in the first rank of living experimentalists .
His researches , which are not confined to one department of chemical science , but extend over many branches , are all distinguished , both by accuracy and originality of treatment .
As examples of the high character of his investigations those of the determinations of the atomic weights of titanium and gold may be specially cited as permanently settling the value of two most important chemical constants ; whilst his researches on the fluorine compounds , including the discovery of thiophosphoryl fluoride , a body capable of existing undecomposed in the state of gas , and his latest work on the Vapour-density of Hydrofluoric Acid , do not fall short of the highest examples of classical chemical investigation .
The Davy Medal has been awarded to Dr. W. H. Perkin for his researches on magnetic rotation in relation to chemical constitution .
Dr. Perkin is well known as the originator of what is now a great industry , that of the coal-tar colours , by his preparation and application to tinctorial purposes of a colouring matter which had previously merely been noticed as affording a chemical test for the presence of aniline .
This , however , is now a long time ago , and it is for more recent work , the interest of which is purely scientific , that the medal has been awarded to him .
Dr. Perkin first showed , in 1884 , that a definite relationship exists between the chemical constitution of substances and their power of rotating the plane of polarisation of light when under magnetic influence ; and he pointed out how the " molecular coefficient of magnetic rotation " or " molecular rotatory power " might be deduced .
President 's Address .
1889 .
] In 1884 he presented to the Chemical Society a lengthy paper describing his method and the results obtained for a very large number of paraffinoid hydrocarbons and haloid and oxygenated derivatives thereof ; from these he deduced " constants , " which he has since shown to be applicable in calculating the magnetic rotatory power of paraffinoid compounds generally .
From time to time he has published further instalments of his work , and only quite recently has described the results obtained on examining nitrogen compounds , which exhibit many most interesting peculiarities .
The results are of special value on account of the exceptional care devoted to the preparation of pure substances , and the guarantee which Dr. Perkin 's reputation affords , that everything possible has been done to secure accuracy ; and also because the substances chosen are for the most part typical substances , or belong to series in which a simple relationship exists .
The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Officers were then read , and Sir W. Aitken and Professor H. G. Seeley having been , with the consent of the Society , nominated Scrutators , the votes of the Fellows present were taken , and the following were declared duly elected as Council and Officers for the ensuing year:\#151 ; President.\#151 ; Sir George Gabriel Stokes , Bart. , M.A. , D.C.L. , LL.
