The LORD KELVIN , D.C.L. , LL. D. , President , in the Chair .
His Royal Highness the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Grotha ( elected March 16 , 1882 ) was admitted into the Society .
A List of the Presents received was laid on the table , and thanks \#166 ; ordered for them .
The following Papers were read :\#151 ; I. " On the new Gas obtained from Uraninite .
Fourth Note .
" By J. Norman Lookyer , C.B. , F.R.S. Received May 28 , 1895 .
Continued experiments on the gases obtained by heating the minerals broggerite and euxenite in vacuo have revealed the presence in the spectrum of an important line in the infra-red .
By comparisons with the solar spectrum in the first order grating spectrum , the wavelength of the line has been approximately determined as 7065 .
There \#166 ; can be little doubt , from the observations which have been made , that this new line is coincident with a chromospheric line which occurs in Young 's list , having a frequency of 100 , of which the wave-length on , Rowland 's scale is stated to be 7065'5 .
It follows therefore that , besides the hydrogen lines , all three chromospheric lines in Young 's list which have a frequency of 100 have now been recorded in the spectra of the new gas or gases Dbtained from minerals by the distillation method .
These are as follows:\#151 ; 7065-5 5875-98 4471-8 The wave-lengths of the lines are in Rowland 's scale , as given in Schemer 's " Astronomical Spectroscopy."* In a partial revision of his chromospheric list , Professor Young gives the corona line 5316 79 as also having a frequency of 100 in the chromosphere , but , up to the present , this line has not been observed in the laboratory .
