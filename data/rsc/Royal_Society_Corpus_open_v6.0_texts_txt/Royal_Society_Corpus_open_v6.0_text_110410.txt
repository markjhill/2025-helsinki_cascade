A paper was also read , entitled , i( Some remarks in reply to Dr. Daubeny 's Note on the Air disengaged from the Sea over the site of the recent Volcano in the Mediterranean/ ' By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. Assistant Inspector of Army Hospitals .
Respecting the air in question , which Dr. Davy had found to con ?
sist of about 80 per cent. of azote and 10 oxygen , he had remarked that two views might be taken of its origin ; the one , that it was of volcanic source ; the other , that it was derived from the sea water , and merely disengaged by the heat of the volcano .
Dr. Davy , rejecting the former of these views , had adopted the latter , for reasons , the validity of which was controverted byDr .
Daubeny ; and the purpose of the present paper is to answer the objections urged against them , and to bring additional evidence in support of his opinion .
