solved into the sum , or the difference , of two other powers of the same degree : " or , as it may still more generally be expressed , * ' If the exponents of three powers be multiplied by the same number , provided that number be greater than 2 , neither the sum , nor the difference , of any two of the resulting quantities can ever be equal to the third quantity .
" It was resolved unanimously , ?
" That the thanks of this Society be given to their Secretary John George Children , Esq. , for the zeal and ability which he has uniformly displayed , and the many valuable services he has rendered , in promoting its objects/ '
