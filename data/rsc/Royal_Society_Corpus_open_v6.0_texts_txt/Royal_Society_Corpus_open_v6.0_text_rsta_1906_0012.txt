Fifth and Sixth Catalogues of the Comparative Brightness of the Stars\#151 ; in Continuation of those Printed in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society ' for 1796-99 .
By Dr. Herschel , .
, F.R.S. Prepared for Press from the Original MS .
Records Col. J. Herschel , R.E. , F.R.S. Received July 24 , \#151 ; Read December 7 , 1905 .
In the 86th , 87th , and 89th volumes of the ' Philosophical Transactions* of the Royal Society'\#151 ; for 1796 , 1797 , and 1799\#151 ; there appeared a series of four papers by Sir William ( then Dr. ) Herschel containing the description and results of observations made by him of the " Comparative Lustres of Stars " visible to the naked eye in northern latitudes .
They were arranged in six " Catalogues , " of which four were actually published , as above .
Apparently two more were to have followed , containing the remaining constellations .
The annexed Tables show the distribution of the constellations among the six Catalogues .
It is not known what prevented the completion of the design at the time .
Drafts of the intended Fifth and Sixth Catalogues exist among Sir William 's papers , prepared , as the previous four had been , by Miss Caroline Herschel , by abstraction from the body of his observations of various kinds , entitled " Abstract of Sweeps and Reviews .
" Circumstances which it is unnecessary to detail have now led to the revision ( and correction where called for ) of these drafts and to their publication in the following pages , in the same form as those in the earlier volumes .
To save reference to the latter , the following extract will explain the symbols used to denote relative brightness .
These are more fully described and illustrated in the pages immediately preceding those from which the extract is made , viz. , pp. 187-9 of vol. 86 .
" Introductory Remarks and Explanations of the Arrangement and Characters " used in the following Catalogue .
" This Catalogue contains nine constellations , which are arranged in alphabetical " order .
I have called the present collection the first catalogue .
The rest of the ( 398 .
) 2.3.06 " constellations , which are pretty far advanced , will be given in successive small " catalogues as soon as time will permit to complete them .
" Each page is divided into four columns , the first of which gives the number of " the stars in the British catalogue of Mr. Flamsteed , as they stand arranged in the " edition of 1725 .
" The second column contains the letters which have been affixed to the stars .
" The third column gives the magnitude assigned to the stars by Flamsteed in the " British catalogue ; and " The fourth contains my determination of the comparative brightness of each star , " by a reference to proper standards .
" All numbers used in the fourth column refer to the stars of the same constellation " in which they occur , except when they are marked by the name of some other " constellation ; and in that case the alteration so introduced extends only to the " single number which is marked , and which then refers to the constellation affixed " to the number .
" The numbers at the head of the notes , which will be found at the end of the " catalogue , refer to the stars in the same constellation to which the notes belong .

B.\#151 ; A long dash between two notes or remarks under the same number indicates that they are disconnected , and occur at an interval of time\#151 ; of days or months even\#151 ; in the course of the " reviews .

8 Is not in the place where it is marked in Atlas : the BA should be + to make it agree with a star that is thereabout , or \#151 ; to make it agree with another .
Either of them will be 7 8.----The star following 7 and 8 , observed by Flamsteed , p. 286 , is in its place , but is much less than 6m .
I should call it 8m .
9 Has no time in Flamsteed 's observation .
It seems to be placed in Atlas considerably too late , so as perhaps to require a correction \#151 ; 10 ' in time .
13 Does not exist.---13 does not exist .
My double star VI , 35 , is 9 Aurigse .
17 The time in Flamsteed 's observation is marked " but I find that my viewing instrument cannot , for want of other near stars , determine whether it is properly placed in the Atlas and catalogue .
27 Does not exist .
Flamsteed never observed it.----------27 28 There is an observation by Flamsteed , p. 286 , on a star S. of 28 , but it does not exist , nor 27.--27 is wanting .
A star observed by Flamsteed , p. 286 , is not in the place where it should be .
27 was never observed by Flamsteed .
32 Is the same with 30 Aurigse.-----The stars 32 33 34 , as I have called them , Oct. 30 , are small stars nearly in a line , but I doubt whether my 32 is Flamsteed 's star .
The Atlas does not give it as it is in the heavens.---The star taken for 32 Cam .
is a small star between 33 and 30 Aurigse , not given in any catalogue .
35 Has no time , but seems to be very properly placed in Atlas and catalogue .
39 My instrument will not determine its place .
It is without time in Flamsteed 's observation .
42 A star observed by Flamsteed , p. 288 , who calls it 4m , preceding 42 and 43 is in its place .
45 and 46 By Flamsteed 's observations should have their PD reversed , but in the heavens they seem to stand as they are placed in Atlas and catalogue .
49 I cannot determine the time of 49 , which Flamsteed 's observations have : : 52 54 58 \#151 ; 52 - 54 but I am not quite sure of 52 and 54 .
There are so many small stars , that it is not possible without fixed instruments to ascertain them positively.---54 in Flamsteed 's observations by strias ( screws ) requires PD \#151 ; 2 ' , but it is not possible to ascertain its place positively .
COMPARATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE STARS .
Notes to Hydra .
8 There is but one star , which if it be 31 Monocerotis , then 8 is not there .
Flamsteed never observed it .
36 Is not in the place where it is marked in Atlas .
The time in Flamsteed 's observations is marked : : 43 Is hardly visible in my small telescope.---1 Crateris \#151 ; 43 .
Dec. 15 , 1795 , it is 43 Hydrge .
1 Crateris , but now ( Jan. 26 , 1797 ) it is 1 Crateris - - 43 Hydra .
I suppose 43 to be changeable .
Notes to Hydra et Crater .
1 See note to 43 Hydra , above .
22 I cannot see 22 in the place where Flamsteed has given it , but 1 ' above is a star which I suppose is it ; calling that , therefore , 22 , it is 23 .
22 .
Notes to Leo minor .
12 Near 12 is a star observed by Flamsteed , p. 438 .
12 wants a correction + in RA .
17 Requires \#151 ; 10 ' in PD. 22 Is not to be seen .
23 \#151 ; , 24 - 22 .
There is a star pointed out by 23 and 24 which may be 22 , but then its situation is faulty about 30 ' , being too far from 28 .
32 The star north of 32 observed by Flamsteed , p. 220 , is in the place .
41 54 54 , Leonis , and the star in Leo minor 's tail-end , 41 Leo minor , are in succession of magnitude .
49 Is a very small star , and a much larger between 49 and 60 Leonis major is not down in catalogue and Atlas .
Notes to Pisces .
1 Which has the time " circiter"in Flamsteed seems to be placed in Atlas and in the catalogue a little later than it should be ; perhaps 5 ' or 6 ' of space .
40 ; 39 A larger star than either is 1 ' 4 ' towards a Androm .
If this was mistaken for 39 perhaps it might give rise to the supposition of the loss of 40.----40 is not lost .
48 Has no time .
In the heavens it seems to be nearly in the place where the catalogue gives it.--48 - , 49 .
The observation 48 .
49 , Jan. 1 , 1796 , is probably owing to a mistake of the star , as there is one nearly equal to 48 near it which is not in Flamsteed 's catalogue nor Atlas .
50 52 56 Either 50 or 52 is wanting .
By 46 it is 52 that is wanting ; 56 is wanting .
[ Note by W. H. : " As it appears by Index that 50 and 55 have no observations , put 52 and 56 for them .
" ] 59 Flamsteed has no observation of 59 , but there is a star in the place where the catalogue gives it .
DR. HERSCHEL'S FIFTH CATALOGUE OF THE 70 Does not exist.---70 is a very small star .
Flamsteed observed it , p. 406 .
71 Is so small that it may , perhaps , not be Flamsteed 's star , but there is no .other .
72 A star between 72 and 78 , observed by Flamsteed , pp. 149 , 180 , is in its place .
It is = 72 nearly .
104 Is 8 ' lower than 1 Arietis ( which does not exist ) is marked ; perhaps it was by mistake placed 8 ' more north and called 1 Arietis .
108 Does not exist , or is invisible.-There is a large star lj ' from 6 Arietis and 2f from 107 , not in Atlas.---108 does not exist .
109 is just 3 ' south of it and is , perhaps , the same .
On p. 332 of Flamsteed 's observations the number is cast up 3 ' wrong , which has produced 108 Pise .
The observation belongs to 109 .
Notes to Sagittarius .
I Flamsteed has no observation of 1 , but there is a star exactly in the place where 1 is marked in the Atlas .
8 Does not exist .
There is a small star at rectangles to 17 15 13 towards the place where 8 is marked in the Atlas , but it is much too near 13 to be 8 .
II Does not exist .
12 The RA of 12 requires a correction of about 1 ' minus , for in the place where 12 is marked in Atlas is no star , but 1 ' before there is one which answers to it .
14 The star observed by Flamsteed , p. 171 , is in its place ; it is 1^ ' S. of 14 .
18 I see many small stars north of 19 , but cannot see 18 south of it.----18 is not in the place assigned by Flamsteed 's catalogue , but about 1 ' more in RA is a star which is probably the one intended .
It was observed by Flamsteed , p. 115 .
23 24 The star between 25 and 26 north of them observed by Flamsteed , p. 374 , is in its place .
23 does not exist .
There is a star that answers pretty well to 23 .
It is a little farther from 25 than it is laid down in Atlas .
24 should be nearer to 25 than in Atlas .
The observation of Flamsteed , p. 532 , gives it right .
53 Is double , and I cannot say which is Flamsteed 's star .
Notes to Ursa minor .
1 a appears uncommonly bright.-----The pole star seems to be decreased , or / 3 is increased .
The place of the moon may possibly influence appearances----a , / 3 The night is not favourable.--Very clear , a - ( 3 .
2 Is not as in Atlas , or rather it exists not.----Flamsteed observed a star , pp. 213 , 214 , 215 , which has been misplaced and called 2 Ursa minor .
It should be 2 ' further from 1 , and it is in the place where it was observed .
4 By Flamsteed 's observation the RA of 4 should be \#151 ; 3 ' 50 ' in time ; but without a fixed instrument I cannot perceive that 4 is misplaced , being so near the pole .
8 Either exists not , or is at least not in the place marked in Atlas.----8 is COMPARATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE STARS .
misplaced in Atlas : there are two small stars about 1 ' from 7 towards 15 : one of them is probably 8 .
They are equal , 12.8.8 .
10 14 There is a larger star than either 10 or 14 , between but following these two , which is not in Flamsteed .
12 Appears two small for 7m .
It is 8 or 9m .
Flamsteed has no observation of 12 .
14 Has no time in Flamsteed 's observation , but it seems to be placed very justly in the Atlas .
15 Requires PD \#151 ; 10 ' .
16 19 There is a large star between 16 and 19 not in Flamsteed .
The mistake of Sept. 14 , 1795 , is owing to the large above-mentioned star .
18 There are seven stars about the place of 18.---Flamsteed has no observation of 18 .
19 .
20 Sept. 14 , 1795 , I suppose this to he a mistake of the star .
24 Requires + 10 ' or in RA .
f Notes to V Vulpecula in Atlas is laid down so confusedly and erroneously that it is impossible to ascertain the stars without a fixed instrument .
2 Is misplaced .
It requires a correction of J ' minus in RA and 30 ' + in PD. 3 The observation of Sept. 17 , 1795 , 6-3,3 Cygni does not agree with this 3 \#151 ; 3 Cygni p.e. , of this date , Nov. 3 , 1795].----Nov .
15 , 1795 , 3 \#151 ; 3 Cygni .
7 Requires a correction , \#151 ; near J ' in RA .
11 10 \#151 ; 11 , but 11 is very small and Flamsteed has no observation of it , I suppose therefore that this is not the star which is given in Atlas and catalogue.-11 is forgot in Atlas .
13 9 \#151 ; 10 , 13 , Sept. L7 , 1795 , but 13 is further from 10 and nearer to 14 than it is marked in Atlas .
12 Is placed too far north in Atlas\#151 ; at least 15 ' by 12 Sagittse.---Large star in the breast near 14-9 .
13 The expression 10 , 13 , Sept. 17 , 1795 , cannot be right ; it is 13----10.----Dec .
4 , 1796 , I have my doubts about the expression 10 , 13 used Sept. 17 , 1795 .
I could hardly mistake the star 10 as [ ?
and ] there is none in the neighbourhood that exceeds 13 .
14 A large star in Atlas preceding 14 is not in the heavens , nor do I know how it comes into the Atlas , as Flamsteed has it nowhere .
This constellation must be reviewed again , when it is higher .
16 A considerable star near 16 .
24 25 A star larger than either , north of 24 , observed by Flamsteed , p. 64 , is in ts place .
31 32 Are contrary in magnitude to what they are in Atlas .

11 There are two stars about the place of 11 nearly alike in brightness .
13 Is 37 Comae Berenices .
19 A considerable star sp 19 is omitted : much larger than 18 .
22 Does not exist .
It was never observed by Flamsteed .
25 Is misplaced : the PD should be +10 ' .
It is not in the place where the catalogue has it , but is 10 ' more south .
25-8 A star observed by Flamsteed , p. 228 , is in its place about f ' or 1 ' north of this 25 , and a little preceding it is # , 14 .
A star observed by Flamsteed , p. 225 , from 64 Ursae towards 54 Ursae is in its place .
It is 1 7 * Notes to Coma Berenices .
5 December 27 , 1786 .
I looked for 5 Comae , but could not find it .
19 April 19 , 1797 .
19 does not exist .
Flamsteed never observed it .
29 Is the same with 36 Yirginis .
34 Does not exist , nor did Flamsteed observe it .
35 39 A star between 35 and 39 observed by Flamsteed , p. 165 , is in its place .
It is 39 = , # 41 A star near 41 observed by Flamsteed , p. 165 , is in its place .
A star south following 41 observed by Flamsteed , p. 165 , is in its place .
It is 41-# 42 A star south of 42 observed by Flamsteed , p. 164 , is in its place .
Calling it in general * it will be 38 , * Notes to Libra .
1 Does not exist : there is a star of a considerable magnitude near 50 Hydrae , but the place does not agree with 1--1 is not in the place where it is marked in Atlas , but there is a star which Flamsteed observed , p. 166 , which is probably 1 .
It is BA\#151 ; 30 ' and PD+ 2 ' and is in its place .
I shall call it 1 and it is 50 Hydrae - , 1 2 There are two about the place of 2 , but I suppose the largest , and nearest to 98 Yirginis , to be Flamsteed 's star .
It agrees best with the place .
23 Is not in the place where Atlas gives it , nor did Flamsteed observe it there .
He has a star , p. 531 , which is 1 ' 26 ' more in BA .
This is probably 23 , and it is 23 , 14 and is in its place .
27 Does not seem larger than 9 , at least not very decidedly , and so as to be denoted 27 , 9 , but 9 has a small star near it , not visible to the naked eye , which increases its lustre ; but in my glass it is evident that 27 is a little brighter than 9 .
37 North of 37 is a star nearly as large as 37 , but 37 is a very little larger in the finder.---Flamsteed 's star observed , p. 45 , north of 37 is in its place 37 - * COMPARATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE STARS .
Note to Piscis austrinus .
September 22 , 1795 .
This constellation , on account of its low situation , can be of no use for comparative magnitudes .
The opportunities of observing it must be so scarce that no discoveries of changes can be made in it .
I can see no other star with the naked eye but those I have equated [ viz. , 24 and 18 .
The observations of other stars of this constellation were made two years later.\#151 ; J. H. ] .
Notes to 16 Should be about 3 or 4 minutes nearer to 15 .
Flamsteed 's observation , p. 197 , leaves the ZD doubtful .
21 Is of a very brilliant ruddy light.---Is of a pale garnet colour : it seems to be the most coloured of all the large stars .
Its low situation probably contributes to it .
25 Either does not exist or is misplaced .
There is a star about 4 ' from 23 and 2f ' from 22 , which may be the star if misplaced .
In that case the RA of 25 should be \#151 ; 1 ' and it will be 22 = 7 25 .
Several stars of Serpentarius are so small that 25 may exist .
26 Being low it may be larger than 14 , for I make no allowance in my observations .
Notes to Serpens .
17 There are two of 17 but little different in brightness .
I have taken the brightest of them .
33 Does not exist .
Flamsteed never observed it .
42 Does not exist .
The place where it should be , according to the catalogue , cannot be mistaken .
Flamsteed never observed it .
50 Librse not far from it is in its place .
6 ( 63 ) = l Aquihe and less than \ Aquike .
64 Is the largest of two .
Notes to Serpentarius ( ) .
3 ( v)is misplaced in Atlas 1 ' .
It should be about +1 ' in RA .
A star f ' north of it , observed by Flamsteed , pp. 442 , 443 , is in its place .
6 Does not exist .
Flamsteed never observed it .
13 3 ' np 13 is a star not marked in Flamsteed = 20 .
26 28 26 has another near it larger than 28 .
30 Seems not to be rightly placed .
38 31 Scorpii is 38 .
46 A larger star than 46 is just by , but not marked in Atlas.--------46 does not exist .
DR. HERSCHEL'S SIXTH CATALOGUE OF THE 48 Does not exist .
Flamsteed never observed either of them .
57 A large star np 57 observed by Flamstbed , p. 442 , is in its place .
It is 57 * 59 Does not exist .
Flamsteed never observed it .
60 I suspect 27 Herculis to be changeable , for it is now 60 .
27 Here , or even 27 Here , 60 .
There is great difference in the weather .
72 Is much too large for 6m .
Notes to Ursa major .
20 There is a very small star about the place of 20 , which I can hardly take for one of Flamsteed 's .
It is 16 \#151 ; , 20.------20 does not exist in the place where it is marked in the Atlas .
There is no star but of the 9th mag .
within a degree of the place .
21 I think does not exist .
There is a star not far from the place where the Atlas has it , but it is much too small.--21 does not exist .
I cannot mistake the place .
34 The star south of 34 observed by Flamsteed , p. 439 , is in the place .
35 Is not as laid down in Atlas .
50 a ( Oct. 25 , 1795 ) Appears unusually large 8h\lt ; 20m\ When I saw it at 6h ' I thought so immediately .
I suspect it to be changeable , or rather am pretty sure it is so .
It is as large as / 3 Ursse minoris , but that is so much higher that no fair comparison can be made between them .
Oct. 26 , 1795 .
50 is not so bright as last night .
Oct. 28 , 1795 .
It is much less than it was Oct. 26 .
The place of the moon may possibly influence appearances .
Nov. 28 , 1795 .
It would not be proper to compare a Urs .
maj .
with " and rj , as they are much lower , but a seems to be remarkably bright .
75 Has no time in Flamsteed 's observations and is misplaced in Atlas .
It is but very little following 74 , being almost in the same It A with it .
76 There are two of 76 , at a distance of nearly f ' from each other .
77 June 25 , 1796 , 77 is very bright .
July 21 , 1796 , 77 is decreased .
78 Is missing ; at least is not as marked in Atlas.----78 has no time .
In the observation of Flamsteed in the Atlas , it is placed about 20 ' of a degree too far East .
82 Is missing .
86 The place of 86 is not right in Atlas by many minutes , perhaps 15 ' .
Notes to Virgo .
18 Is lost.--18 does not exist , or is reduced to 9m at least.-18 does not exist .
19 Is lost ; or , as there are 4 or 5 stars about its place , if it is among them , it is at least reduced to the 10th mag.-----19 exists not , or is less than 9m .
There are 3 or 4 stars near the place , but extremely small.-19 does not exist , or is at least 9m or COMPARATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE STARS .
10m.-----19 exists not , but there is a star sp 20 about the same distance as 19 is marked np .
22 Is in its place and 7m.--22 23 are both either 7 or 7.8 mag.-----22 does not exist .
The observation 31 ,22 , April 9 , 1796 , can not be right .
I mistook very probably a star sf 32 and 31 instead of np , as there is such a one.---22 and 23 do not exist .
Flamsteed has no observation of them .
There is a pretty considerable star near the place of 22.------23 is not to be seen .
There is no star that can be taken for it.---23 does not exist .
There is no star that can be taken for it .
24 is lost .
There is no small star to represent it.-24 does not exist .
There is no star that can be taken for it.--24 does not exist .
Flamsteed has no observation of it .
25 By Flamsteed 's observations requires \#151 ; 19 ' in It A and by the heavens it does the same .
42 Does not exist .
There is no star nearer than 1 ' of any size to the place of 42 given in Atlas .
Flamsteed never observed this star .
The star estimated April 9 , 1796 , 27 -- 42 is one of these small stars nearest the place , which is rather larger than 2 or 3 others thereabout .
45 I cannot see 45 .
There is no star so large as 10 or 11m near the place of 45 .
------45 does not exist .
Flamsteed never observed it .
52 Does not exist .
There is a very small star not far from the place .
Flamsteed has no observation of 52 .
58 The PD of 58 should be +11'.---------58 by Flamsteed 's observations requires + 11 ' in PD and by the heavens it does the same .
56 58 They are very small stars .
58 is double in my finder .
There are two other stars situated like 56 and 58 in Atlas , which were probably taken for them , May 2 , 1796 , when they were estimated 58 .
56 .
Not knowing then that 58 wants a correction of PD+ 11 ' , occasioned the mistake .
61 There seems to be a change in the brightness of 61 since last night .
67 Is of a sparkling bluish white colour : a beautiful star .
71 A star following 71 observed by Flamsteed , p. 194 , 478 O'c ] is in its place * .
71 59 , # .
71 .
77 .
81 .
88 The three last are very small stars .
About the place of 88 there are two nearly equal .
I cannot determine which is Flamsteed s star .
83 The BA of 83 should be +22 ' by Flamsteed 's observations , and it requires the same by the heavens .
91 Does not exist .
99 The star nf 99 observed by Flamsteed , p. 41 , is in its place .
It is 108 - - * 101 Is misplaced in the British Catalogue : it should be +1 in PD. I hen it is 20 Bootis - , 101 .
