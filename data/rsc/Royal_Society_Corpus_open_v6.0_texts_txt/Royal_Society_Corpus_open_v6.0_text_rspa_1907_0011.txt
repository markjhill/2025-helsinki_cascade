13 A Comparison of Values of the Magnetic , deduced from the British Magnetic Survey of 1891 , with Recent Observation .
By William Ellis , F.R.S. ( Received October 30 , \#151 ; Read December 6 , 1906 .
) In the preparation of maps showing lines of equal magnetic declination for commercial use from the data given in the last great Magnetic Survey of the British Isles* it has of late years become apparent , by comparison with the observations made at the several British Magnetic Observatories of Greenwich , Kew , Stonyhurst , Falmouth , and Yalentia , that , owing to decrease in value of the annual variation , the lines , as brought forward from the survey , are now carried too far to the west , that is to say , they give a value of declination that is too small , the discordance being apparently greater towards the west than on the eastern side .
I have thus thought that it would be desirable to examine this question further , not only for declination , but also for horizontal force and dip , comparing the survey values as brought forward to the epoch 1906-0 by use of the annual rates of change which obtained when it was made with the results of recent observation at the places mentioned .
It will be interesting , in the first instance , to ascertain in what degree the annual variation of the several elements may have changed in recent times .
This is shown in Table I , which gives the mean annual variation of each Table I.\#151 ; Annual Variation of Magnetic Elements in Three Successive Periods .

element at Greenwich , Kew , and Stony hurst in three successive periods , the values in the last period being those appearing in Table II , adding thereto* corresponding information from Table XIY of the magnetic survey .
Bemarking that the survey values appear to have been deduced mainly from a consideration of the period 1886 to 1891 , the epochs of the first and second survey , without knowledge of what might happen after 1891 , the survey values appear to be generally well in accord with other observations-We see , however , what has followed in declination : a rapid continuous numerical decrease in magnitude of the annual variation at all three stations .
But in horizontal force there is definite increase of value in the second period at all stations , with drop of value in the third period to something less than the values of the first period .
In dip there is marked numerical increase of value in the second period at Kew and Stonyhurst , with reversion in the third period to values more in accord with those of the first period .
At Greenwich there is only a small increase in the second period , with a considerable increase in the third period , an increase that would appear to be real , although opposed to what occurred at Kew and Stonyhurst , since the yearly value at Greenwich depends on five or six observations each of two needles in every month , the difference between the resulting means of the two needles in 1901 , 1902 , 1903 , and 1904 being only 0'T , 0''0 , 0''3 , and 0''2respectively .
Of that in 1905 I have no information .
Extracting now from the various official publications* the mean yearly values of declination , horizontal force , and dip for the years 1901 to 1905 , values which apply to the middle of each year , the mean of these five values is taken for each element at each place , thus giving values that apply to the epoch 1903'5 as appearing in Column ( 2 ) of Table II .
The difference between the first and last of the yearly values ( 1901 and 1905 ) , divided in each case by four , is taken as the annual variation , !
excepting for horizontal force at Stonyhurst and Falmouth , and dip at Stonyhurst , which , on account of some little irregularity in the progression of the yearly values , were treated graphically , extending the series a little backward , so producing values for the period 1901 to 1905 that were sufficiently satisfactory .
The resulting annual variations are given in Column ( 3 ) .
In Column ( 4 ) the observed values * ' Resuits of the Magnetical and Meteorological Observations made at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich ' .

' t The determination of annual variation from observations made at a particular hour of the day ( instead of from mean values ) , as at Stonyhurst and Valentia , is not strictly accurate , but is abundantly so for the purposes of this paper .
1906 .
] Values of the Magnetic , of Column ( 2 ) are reduced to the epoch 1906'0 by the annual variations of Column ( 3 ) .
The values are mean values .
To secure this , however , as the observations of declination , horizontal force , and dip at Stonyhurst were made at 16 h. , 10 h. , and 12 h. respectively ( civil time counting from midnight ) , and at Yalentia at 10 h. , 12 h. , and 13 h. respectively , small corrections* ' to reduce to mean values became necessary , as shown in Table II .
The Greenwich values of dip *also were made on the average from 13 h. to 14 h. , and the Falmouth observations in 1901 , 1902 , and 1903 at 15 h. , but no corrections for diurnal range were in these cases necessary .
It becomes of interest here to note that the Greenwich values of declination include all days , excepting those of great magnetic disturbance , whilst the Ivew and Falmouth declinations include only the five selected quiet days in each month , and further to inquire whether the declinations found by these two methods show any difference .
The declinations at Greenwich were therefore calculated for the years 1903 and 1904 , including only the five quiet days in each month , with the following result : As regards the difference between the separate monthly values in the 24 months of the two years , on three occasions there was no difference , on five occasions a difference of 0'l , on eleven occasions O'^ , on two occasions 0'*3 , and 0r,4 , 0'*5 , and 0'*6 on one occasion each only .
In horizontal force the result would be presumably similar .
Coming now to the survey values , Column ( 5 ) of Table II contains the-value of each element , at each place , for 189F0 from Table XXIV of the Magnetic Survey , reduced to the epoch 1906'0 by means of the annual variations of Table XIY .
But as survey values for Greenwich for 1891'0 do not appear in Table XXIY , they have been calculated from Tables XX , XXI , and XXII , and similarly brought forward to 1906-0 by the survey variations .
To these values , by application of the local deviation ( difference between the observed and survey values for 18910 in Table XX .
IV ) , the concluded survey values for 1896'0 are found , the difference between which and the observed values for the same epoch ( Column ( 4 ) ) showing the discordance of the survey value .

The horizontal force is in metrical measure .
The survey values for declination , brought up to the present time , thus give a westerly declination that is too small as compared with observation , the difference being greatest on the western side , and the dip , similarly brought up , gives a value that is too great , with little difference in amount at the various places .
The survey values of horizontal force are in much closer agreement with observation .
The discordance in horizontal force is expressed in metrical measure , but in order to show the relative magnitude of the discordances in the other elements of declination and dip , these have been converted also into metrical 1906 .

The discordances thus pointed out have no concern with the important deductions and conclusions regarding the magnetic condition of the-British Isles , so fully discussed in the survey volume , but simply indicate that the secular variations of Table XIV of the survey have undergone-change since the time when the survey was made , especially in the case of magnetic declination and dip .
The secular changes there tabulated were-primarily put together for the necessary purpose of reducing the observations-on which the survey was based to a mean epoch , and were not intended for application to future years without being checked .
As the authors of the survey pointed out , the continuous records available at the various magnetic observatories , combined with further magnetic observations , taken from time to time , at a limited number of selected stations distributed over the area covered by the survey , may give sufficient information , the local deviations being thus known , for rectification of the mean lines of equal values of the several magnetic elements .
