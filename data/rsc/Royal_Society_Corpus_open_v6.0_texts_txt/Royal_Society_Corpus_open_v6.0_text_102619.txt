a A B a A C B D b DD Part of a Letter from Mr. Llwid to Dr. Tancred Robinson , F. R. S. concerning a Figured Stone found in Wales ; with a Note on it , by Hans Sloane , M.D. I Here send you the Representation of a LimestoneMarble , we have lately Discovered in this Country , when Polished .
We have Plenty of it ; but few pieces exceed Six , Nine , or Twelve Inches Diameter ; for it is only a sort of Alcyonium , incorporated in several small blocks of the Lime-stone ; whereof the first Figure represents a piece polished Perpendicularly , and the other Horizontally .
I would entreat you to Discourse some Stone-Cutter , and to advise me what Uses it might seem proper for , &amp;c. It is ( to me ) more Beautiful than the Florentine Marble , but much more hard and substantial .
I should be glad of a Line or two about it .
