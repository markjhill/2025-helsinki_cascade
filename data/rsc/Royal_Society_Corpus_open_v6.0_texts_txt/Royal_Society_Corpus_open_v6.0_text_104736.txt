BESIDES the Shock .
which happened here about 6 in the Evening on the 18th Instant , as has been mentioned in the public Prints from many neighbouring Places , there was another , which was felt by some betwixt 3 and 4 o ' Clock next Morning : But whether this latter was as extensive as the former , I cannot yet learn .

1750 .
In the Evening Shock , a Gentleman of my Acquaintance was sitting alone in his Parlour by the Fire with the Doors shut ; the Spaniel-Dog , which lay as it were asleep before him , was so terrified at the unusual Motion , that he ran round the Room in the greatest Fright and Confusion , as endeavouring to find a Way of Escape .
