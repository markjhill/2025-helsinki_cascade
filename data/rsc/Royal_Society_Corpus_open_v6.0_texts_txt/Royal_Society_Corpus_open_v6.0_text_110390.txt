A paper was read , entitled , " On a new property of the Arcs of the Equilateral Hyperbola .
" By Henry Fox Talbot , Esq. , M.P. , F.R.S. By an analytical process , the author arrives at the following theorem , namely , if three abscissse of an equilateral hyperbola be materially dependent by reason of two assumed equations , which are symmetrical with respect to these three abscissae , the sum of the arcs subtended by them is equal to three quarters of the product of the same abscissae , or only differs therefrom by a constant quantity .
In order to satisfy himself of the correctness of this theorem , the author calculated various numerical examples , which entirely confirmed it .
This simple result is essentially a relation between three arcs of the equilateral hyperbola , and is by no means reducible to a relation between two ?
and therefore is not reducible to the celebrated theorem of Fagnani , concerning the difference of two arcs of an ellipse or hyperbola , nor to any other known property of the curve .
The reading of Mr. Faraday 's Sixth Series of Experimental Researches in Electricity was commenced .
