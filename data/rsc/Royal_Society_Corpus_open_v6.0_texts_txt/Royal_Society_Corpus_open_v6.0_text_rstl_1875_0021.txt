639 S I. Introduction .
This communication , the result of an inquiry having originally reference to the bearing of the subject on certain geological questions , was commenced more than twenty years ago , but abandoned for a time , partly owing to the pressure of other engagements , and partly waiting more accurate information of the range of life at depths* .
The great impulse given to these questions by the more recent expeditions of the 4 Lightning ' * A few of the geological questions were , however , noticed , and some of the early deep-sea temperature-observations given , in the author 's Anniversary Address to the Geological Society of February 1871 , Quart .

and * Porcupine , ' culminating in that of the ' Challenger , ' has not only again directed attention to the subject of deep-sea temperatures , but has led to such improved methods of observation , that it may now seem late to bring forward the less accurate experiments of former observers .
It might therefore seem almost a work of supererogation , now that the subject in connexion with these later voyages has been so ably and zealously taken up by my friend Dr. Carpenter , to introduce these more variable older elements into the discussion .
Still the older observations , though restricted to comparatively limited depths , have a wide range ; and in the case of the Arctic voyages they were obtained under conditions of so much difficulty and danger , that it may be long before similar experiments are repeated ; while many of the original opinions evidently deserve great consideration .
It was , moreover , always my intention to complete the task I had begun when time and opportunity offered ; and as Dr. Carpenter 's work commences with the observations made by him on board the 'Lightning ' in 1868 , it may not be out of place to have a record of all that was done in temperature-soundings* up to that time , even as supplementary to the more exact work of later voyages .
I may also notice that , notwithstanding the superiority of the more recent observations and the inaccuracy of many of the older ones , there are a certain number of the latter which were made with great care , and which may vie with recent experiments in exactness ; while with respect to the others , the errors are such as may in most cases be computed and allowed for ; or merely taking the old observations as they are , the comparative temperatures recorded at corresponding depths with the same or similar instruments have their own special value .
The older observations are also so scattered through various narratives of voyages and in scientific periodicals , that no one can , without much difficulty of search , form an idea of their number and interest , or of the progress which the subject had made at the hands of the eminent men who had from time to time engaged in the inquiry on the Continent .
I purpose , therefore , to show the state of the question at the time of the ' Lightning ' expedition .
For all that has been done since , I would refer to the exhaustive papers of Dr. Carpenter*)* .
In former voyages the temperatures are variously noted in degrees of Reaumur , * The few old observations of life at depths will not now require notice .

589 Fahrenheit , and Centigrade , and the depths are recorded in feet , fathoms , the 4 old French foot , ' 'toise'* , 'brasse , ' 'metre , ' and the ' yaden , ' while the longitude is sometimes that of Greenwich , at others that of Paris .
I have reduced these various measures to a common scale , adopting for temperatures that of Fahrenheit ; for length , the English foot ; and for longitude , the meridian of Greenwich .
As in these reductions some errors may have crept in , references are given to all the original readings .
In the Lists of Observations ( pp. 639-70 ) the degrees of temperature at depths stand as they are recorded by the several observers , without the correction adopted for the Sections .
The place of each observation is laid down on a recent Admiralty Chart of the world ( Plate 65 ) , in accordance with the longitude and latitude given by each observer , without any attempt at correction , which , in some of the early observations , may possibly be necessary .
The observations thus reduced are tabulated in three groups .
Table I. gives the deep-sea temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere from the Equator to the Polar Circle , and in the same way Table II .
gives those in the Southern Hemisphere .
The observations in inland seas are given in a separate Table , No. III .
A list of temperature-soundings , made up to date , was given by Peron in 1816 .
It was limited to 4 of his own , and to 16 of Forster 's and Irving 's f. In 1832 D'Urville J gave a greatly extended list , embracing as many as 421 observations , which he arranged according to zones of depth ; and in 1837 GehlerS published a list of 226 observations arranged according to latitude .
These , I believe , constitute all the general lists that have been published .
The number of observations recorded in the present Tables amount to 1356 .
In the following pages I have given:\#151 ; first , a notice of the many voyages on which soundings for deep-sea temperatures were taken , with an account , when possible , of the mode in which the observations were made ; secondly , a summary of the opinions founded on these data ; and thirdly , a statement of the results obtained and of the conclusions to be formed thereon .
Besides the error due to pressure , which , as so many of the older soundings were made at small depths , is frequently unimportant , there is that arising from the angle of the line from the vertical caused by currents , and another due to the tension of the rope by strain and wet , which is sometimes not inconsiderable .
I have , however , in drawing the sections , given the depths without correction for these causes , so as to place all the observations on the same footing , as it is but rarely , although there are exceptions , that these particular sources of error were noticed or mentioned || .

|| The older deep-sea soundings have been found to be liable to serious error , arising from the difficulty in actual fixing the depth of sounding ; but in these Tables there are few of that depth to involve this particular error ; still some of the deeper ones must be looked upon with doubt .
4x2 Owing to the want of a reliable self-registering thermometer , three plans were resorted to by the earlier observers to ascertain the temperature of the sea at depths below the surface .
The first and more common plan was to bring up water from a determined depth in sufficient quantity and with sufficient speed to prevent any material change of temperature , and then to try it with an ordinary thermometer , although sometimes the thermometer was suspended in and descended with the water-bucket .
In the second place , the thermometer was surrounded with a non-conducting substance , and left down a length of time sufficient to acquire the temperature of the surrounding medium and then brought rapidly to the surface .
In the third place , the temperature was taken by means of mud or silt brought up from the bottom .
On a few occasions metallic thermometers have been tried , but not with satisfactory results .
These several plans continued in use from time to time up to a comparatively late period , until gradually superseded by self-registering thermometers .
As the error due to pressure in the use of the latter instrument has now been determined with sufficient accuracy , most of the older observations can readily be subjected to correction .
Such correction has been applied to all the observations that have been used in constructing the Sections , Plates 66-68 ; but , as in the Tables themselves the original readings are given without correction , in order to obtain in any case , with a few exceptions named , an approximately true reading , the correction given at p. 612 must be applied .
Where , from the use of proper precautions , the original readings are presumed to be correct , they are distinguished by being placed between brackets in the Sections .
S II .
Historical Narrative of Deep-sea , 1749-1868 .
In this chapter I have enumerated in chronological order the various voyages on which I have found any record of deep-sea temperatures\#151 ; stating generally the course gone over , the number of observations made , the depths attained , the methods employed .
At the end the correction for the errors attendant on these methods is determined .
The particulars of the observations taken on each voyage will be found in the Tables by reference to Column VIII .
, under which is given the name of the officer in command , or of the scientific observer accompanying the expedition .
The conclusions formed by them on these data are reserved to the next chapter .
It was about the middle of the last century that the subject of deep-sea temperatures first began to attract attention .
In 1749 Captain Ellis , on the occasion of a voyage to the north-west coast of Africa , made two experiments at depths of 3900 and 5346 feet in lat. 25 ' 13 ' N.* , with an instrument devised by Dr. Hales , and described by him in a paper to the Royal Society* !
* .
It consisted of a bucket about the size of an ordinary pail , with valves at top and bottom , which remained open as the apparatus descended , and closed as it ascended .
He obtained in both cases readings of 53 ' ; and he rightly attributed this uniformity to the greater depth of water through which , in the deeper experiment , the instrument had to be hauled , and which caused a larger gain of heat .

No further attempts of the kind seem to have been made until 1772 , when Cook* went , with Forster f as naturalist , on his firstwoyage round the world .
They each separately record three experiments made , at depths of 600 feet , between the equator and 64 ' South latitude , and they both recognized the decrease , within certain latitudes , of the temperature with depth .
From some unexplained cause , the experiments were soon discontinued .
No mention is made either in Cook 's or Forster 's narrative of the instruments used , except that the latter alludes ( p. 45 ) to the use of thermometers , while Peron speaks ( p. 318 ) of Forster 's " cylindre a double soupape ; " so it may be presumed that he used Hale 's apparatus with an ordinary thermometer enclosed in it .
The apparatus was left at the bottom from 15 to 30 minutes .
In 1773 , on the occasion of Captain Phipps 's $ voyage to Spitzbergen , he was furnished by the Royal Society with instructions how " to direct his inquiries .
" Sailing past Shetland and the Faroe Islands , to the west and north coasts of Spitzbergen , he reached 80 ' 48 " N. latitude .
Dr. Irving , who accompanied the expedition , made nine observations at depths varying from 192 to 4098 feet , and extending from the German Ocean to the north of Spitzbergen .
They first of all used thermometers contrived by Lord Charles Cavendish S in 1757 .
They were on the principle of overflow thermometers , which registered the temperature by subtracting from a column of mercury of given length the portion which passed over into an attached receiving bulb , and comparing the instrument before and after with a standard thermometer ; but , owing to its delicacy , difficulties of manipulation , and errors by compression , this instrument was soon abandoned .
Irving then devised a water-bottle with a coating of wool 3 inches thick , and shutting inside with a cone of lead when at the bottom .
The temperature was taken when brought to the surface .
For moderate depths the results , which are recorded in the Tables , seem to have been tolerably correct .
Those obtained with Cavendish 's thermometei ' are , on the contrary , so discordant || that I have not included * Voyage toAvards the South Pole , 1772-1775 .

them in the Tables .
The general conclusion Phipps and Irving drew was that , except in Arctic seas , the temperature decreased with the depth .
In 1780 Saussure made the two first observations on the temperature of the Mediterranean*\#151 ; one off Genoa at a depth of 944 feet , and the other off Nice at a depth of 1918 feet .
Both the thermometers marked 55'*8 , or , allowing his correction , about 55'*5 , a singularly close approach to the more recent observations of Aim and others .
Saussure used a spirit-thermometer of Reaumur 's with a large ball , which he surrounded with a mixture of wax , resin , and oil 3 inches thick ; and the whole was then placed in an iron-wire cage .
In both cases he sunk the thermometers at 7 o'clock in the evening , and left them down until 7 in the morning , so that they might acquire precisely the temperature of the surrounding water .
The one sunk 1918 feet deep took twenty-four minutes to haul in , and he inferred that this would give the true temperature within a fraction ( one fifth ) of a degree .
The thermometer was specially made and graduated for the experiment ; and he had previously ascertained that after lowering it to a temperature of 2'*3 R. , and arranging so that by constant moving it traversed 1000 feet of water at 14 ' R. in ten minutes ' time , the instrument had only risen one tenth of a degree , or to 20,4 .
In 1800-4 a voyage of circumnavigation was undertaken by command of the Emperor Napoleon .
Monsieur F.Peron.f ' accompanied it as naturalist and physicist ; but , owing to the indifference of the officers and ill will of the men , he was unable to make more than 4 uncertain experiments , all in the tropical seas , and at depths only of from 320 to 2270 feet , the lowest temperature recorded being 450,5 in lat. 4'N .
M. Peron , not satisfied with former methods , employed a mercurial Reaumur 's thermometer , placed in a glass cylinder , with cotton-wool to protect it .
This was enclosed in a wooden cylinder sufficiently large to allow of a packing between the two of powdered charcoal , and then put in a tin case , which was wrapped round with oil-cloth .
The value of the results to be obtained by such protected instruments necessarily depends , as in the case of Saus-sure 's experiments , upon leaving the thermometer down for some hours ; but in one case only was M. Peron allowed to leave his apparatus down 1 hour 50 minutes , and once he had to haul it up after five minutes ' submergence .
PHron refers to and tabulates the experiments of his predecessors , and remarks on the same law of the temperature decreasing from the surface downwards .
In 1803 the 4 Neva ' sailed on a voyage of circumnavigation , under the command of Captain Krusenstern .
Touching at Falmouth , he passed round Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands , Kamtschatka , Japan , and back by the Cape of Good Hope .
Krusenstern took out with him an apparatus made in St. Petersburg on the model of Hales 's ; but this was abandoned for Six 's self-registering thermometer , which , although invented in 1782 , was now for the first time employed at sea .
Some thirty experiments were made by * Voyages dans les Alps .

him and Dr. Horner in the tropical regions of the Pacific* and the Sea of Okhotsh .
We have no description of his water-bucket , and are therefore without means of judging of the exact value of the results .
The more numerous experiments made , on the other hand , by Dr. Horner f with Six 's thermometer admit of correction .
A subject of so much interest did not escape the attention of Scoresby ; and he gives a Table of the twenty-four observations made by him in the seas around Spitzbergen , during his several voyages to the Arctic Ocean between 1810 and 1822 , at depths varying from 78 to 4566 feetj .
He made use of an apparatus ( no doubt based on that of Hales ) consisting " of a cask capable of holding 10 gallons of water , composed of 2 inches of fir plank , as being a bad conductor of heat .
" Each end of the cask was furnished with a valve ; these were connected with a wire so as to move simultaneously .
They opened in descending and closed in ascending .
The cask was allowed to remain down half an hour , and was hauled up briskly .
A common thermometer was then used to ascertain the temperature of the water so brought up .
This machine soon , however , got out of order , and he had one cast in brass , 14 inches in length by 5^ inches in diameter , which he called a marine diver .
This he employed in all his experiments on and after the 1st May , 1811 .
A Six 's thermometer was enclosed , which could be read off through two glass sides in the " diver " on coming to the surface .
The weight of the machine was 23 lbs. He recognized in these seas a uniform though slight increase of temperature from the surface to the greatest depth he attained , the temperature at the surface being generally 28 ' to 29 ' , and increasing in descending to 36 ' and even 38 ' ( uncorrected ) .
In a subsequent voyage he gives , however , an experiment made 7 ' or 8 ' further south , and off the coast of Greenland , in which the reverse held good ; the surface-temperature being 34 ' , and at a depth of 678 feet 29 ' S. Objections have been raised to Scoresby 's experiments , on the ground that they do not accord with those of Martins and Bravais , which were made with more exact modern instruments .
But these observers themselves accept Scoresby 's observations as true , subject to small corrections .
The differences between them are , in fact , more apparent than real , and arise chiefly from the circumstance that their observations were made in the months of July and August , when the temperature of the air averaged from 35 ' to 45 ' , and that of the surface-water from 38 ' to 42 ' , whereas Scoresby experimented in April and May , when these had temperatures respectively of 20 ' to 34 ' and of 28 ' to 30 ' , so that the relative differences between the surface and the deep waters are necessarily very different in the two cases .
In the experiments at depths below 2000 feet there is little discordance after applying the corrections employed by Martins and Bravais .
The latter , however , took no depth exceeding 2854 feet , while Scoresby gives * * * S * Voyage round the World in the years 1803-6 .

two exceeding 4000 feet ; and these were made at some distance from those of the French observers , who experimented chiefly between Norway and lat. 76 ' N. , whereas Scoeesby 's observations were mostly north of that latitude , and in the sea west of Spitz-bergen as far as 80 ' north .
It is easy to determine the depth at which , in inland seas like the Mediterranean , the effect of the diurnal variation of temperature ceases , but it is a much more difficult problem in Arctic seas .
Exposed to the low temperatures of an Arctic climate , the surface-waters may continue to sink until their temperature is reduced to 25'*4 , the point at which they attain their maximum of density .
This , however , can only happen in a state of perfect calm or with waters of unusual saltness , as sea-water of the usual specific gravity freezes under ordinary conditions at 270,4 F. , though it has been shown that in a state of perfect rest it may be reduced to 20 ' , or even lower before freezing .
Under these conditions , and with the complicated action of warm currents from the south and of cold currents from the north , we must expect to find considerable variation in the temperature of the Arctic Ocean , down , at all events , to the depths hitherto reached of 4600 feet .
Judging from the conditions prevailing in the Antarctic seas and the sea of Baffin Bay , it seems probable that more uniform readings will be obtained at greater depths , and that the anomalous readings in the upper strata are caused by the warmer waters which flow in from the south tending to take at and near the surface the temperature of the air at different seasons , while the deeper part of this mass of warm water remains unaffected ; and in the deeper channels there may be , flowing from the north , the more permanent body of cold water produced by the winter refrigeration of the polar seas of still higher latitudes .
Subject to the corrections for the causes before named , Scoeesey 's experiments command confidence .
The effect of the corrections will be to reduce his readings where Six 's thermometer was used , while where the water-bucket alone was used a small addition may be generally needed .
In the mean time ( 1815-18 ) another Russian voyage of circumnavigation* , under the command of Otto vox Kotzebue , was undertaken for scientific purposes .
One hundred and sixteen carefully conducted experiments ( often taken from day to day ) were made in both the great oceans and amongst the islands of the Eastern Archipelago .
These observations , many of them serial , taken at depths of from 24 to 2448 feet , were tabulated in the order of date .
On this voyage Kotzebue used English-made ( Jones ) Six 's thermometers .
They were protected by a wooden case closed with " wire grating , " but not in any other way , and they were fastened on the sounding-line about 6 feet above the weight .
Kotzebue considered that " seven or eight minutes suffice to give it the temperature of the surrounding water , and a quick or a slow pulling up has no effect on the observation " ( vol. i. p. 89 ) .

595 In 1816 Captain Wauchope made two observations in the Atlantic , a few degrees north and south of the equator , at depths of 2880 and 6060 feet , and records temperatures at those depths of 51 ' and 42 ' * .
The apparatus he used consisted of 44 a series of cases , one within the other , having valves opening up so as to allow the water to pass through in descending , but which closed in hauling the instrument up .
The thermometer was enclosed in a glass tube in the centre of it .
" Elsewhere he mentions that the cases were J- of an inch apart , except the outer one , which was ^ an inch , and that one was filled with tallow .
This was enclosed in a case of wood 1 inch thick .
The machine was 2 feet high by 10 inches in diameter .
The time it took to haul up was from twenty minutes to one hour and twenty minutes .
After all , as Six 's thermometer was used , the correction to be applied is rather that due to pressure than to the change of medium .
In measuring the depth , Captain Wauchope allowed for the angle of the rope from the vertical .
In 1817 , on the occasion of the voyage of the 'Alceste ' to China , a few experiments were made by Clarke ABELf in the shallow waters of the Yellow Sea .
No particulars of the methods he adopted are given .
In 1818 attention was again directed in this country to the Arctic seas , and the 4 Isabella ' and 4 Alexander ' were despatched to Baffin Bay , under the command of Ross J and Parry ; and the 4 Dorothea ' and 4 Trent ' to Spitzbergen , under Buchan and Franklin S. As many as 72 valuable observations on deep-sea temperatures and soundings were made by the several commanders , assisted by Sir Edward Sabine , who accompanied Ross , and by Beechey and Fisher , who accompanied Franklin .
Some of these are recorded in the narratives of the several voyages , and the others are given by Dr. Marcet in his well-known paper 44 On the Specific Gravity and Temperature of Sea Waters " published in 18191| .
Sir John Ross adopted the plan of taking the temperature of a mass of mud or silt brought up from the bottom .
For this purpose he contrived what he called a deep-sea clamm .
It consisted of 44 a cast iron parallellogram " 18 inches high by 6 inches wide on the outside ; inside 5 x 4 in .
It weighed 1 cwt .
, and would bring up about 6 lbs. of mud .
By this means , a bottom-temperature generally of 29'-5 , and in one case , at the depth of 6000 feet , as low as 28'*75 , was determined in Baffin Bay .
This degree of cold was generally corroborated by a Six 's thermometer , both instruments apparently giving the same or nearly the same reading .

remarkable low temperature of 250,75 F. was recorded , at a depth of 4080 feet in Davis Straits , by Sir John Ross and Sir Edward Sabine* .
Buchan and Franklin employed , on the suggestion of Mr. Fisher , a leaden box with two valves , which remained open in descending , and were closed in the ascent .
No other particulars are given , but there is every probability that it was constructed on the model of those of Hales and Scoresby .
Their observations , with one or two exceptions , are , allowing for the difference of season ( June and July ) , in tolerable agreement with those of Scoresby ; but they seem less carefully made , and to require , I suspect , a larger correction .
In 1819-20 Parry went out in command of the 4 Hecla ' and 4 Griper 'f , and penetrated the Arctic seas of North America as far as 113 ' W. long .
He took several deep-sea temperatures on board the c Hecla , ' whilst Sir E. Sabine , on board the 4 Griper , ' made another series of observations .
Mr. Fisher , who published an account J of the voyage , also notes some of those on board the 4 Hecla .
' About this time Sir Humphry Davy suggested another contrivance for bringing up water from depths , which seems to have been used occasionally by Ross and Parry ; but the observations with it are not specified .
On the occasion of Parry 's voyage in 1819 , Dr. Marcet contrived his water-bottle , which Parry appears to have occasionally employed , especially in 1821-23 ( p. xvi ) , 44 in consequence of the failure of the thermometer when exposed to sudden changes , " although elsewhere he says ( p. xiii ) that the temperature was taken , unless otherwise noticed , by Six 's thermometer .
Owing to the very small size ( half a pint ) of Davy 's and Marcet 's water-bottles , and their being of metal , they were valueless for temperature-experiments S , although useful for obtaining small samples of deep-sea water ; and they were consequently , with this exception , but little used for the former purpose .
In Parry 's second voyage of 1821-231| he records a series of twenty-three experiments made in one of the inland seas of Arctic America , at depths of from 600 to 1200 feet .
These show a temperature of from 29 ' to 31'*7 on the surface , and a like temperature , * * * S * On reference to Sir E. Sabine he informs me , from a note made at the time , that on bringing up the thermometer the index marked 25| ' , and that never having known it lower than 28 ' , he was very careful in examining the instrument ; that both he and Captain Ross were on the spot , and that Captain Ross remarked , in drawing it out of the tin case , which was full of water , that the mercury was close up to the index .
It fell instantly and rapidly ; hut Sir Edward had the same belief , that when he first looked it was close up to the index .

or one only 0'-5 less , at the bottom .
As , however , there is little doubt that all these observations in Lyons Inlet were made with Marcet 's bottle , no reliance is to be placed on them* .
In his third and last voyage of 1827f , Parky made as many as forty-five observations in the seas west and north of Spitzbergen , but none exceeded 700 feet in depth .
With few exceptions , they show a lower reading than those of Scoresby .
On this occasion he reverted to the use of Six 's thermometers .
From Parry 's observing on his first voyage that his soundings were made with " Six 's self-registering thermometer confined in iron cases " J , and again , on his second voyage , " that he took out eight Six thermometers with iron cases " S , I was led , in consequence of the low readings , to think that these cases might have been used for protection against pressure ; but Sir Edward Sabine , who was with Eoss in 1818 and with Parry in 1819 , being in the latter expedition on board Captain Clavering 's ship , the 'Griper , ' informs me that all the observations were there made in concert between him and Captain Clavering , and that he had with him " half a dozen thermometers on Six 's construction , made expressly for him by the elder Jones , each of which fitted into ( and was retained by an apparatus at top and bottom ) a tinned iron cylinder pierced with holes in the top and bottom , through which the sea-water percolated freely ... ... ... ... ... The holes in the top and bottom of the cylinder were rather less in diameter than a seven-shilling piece , admitting a free current .
A weight attached to the rope at some little distance below the thermometer , caused the line to run out freely , and prevented the occurrence of 'kinks'"|| .
It is therefore to be presumed that the iron cases referred to by Parry were merely to guard the instruments against accident , and not against pressure ; and on comparing the observations made by him on board the ' Hecla , ' often on the same day and nearly on the same spot , with those of Sir Edward Sabine in the ' Griper , ' I find them in such close agreement as to satisfy me that such was doubtlessly the case .
At the same time * Of the 23 readings recorded , ten give precisely the same temperature at depths of 600 to 1200 feet as was found on the surface , while the others in no instance show a difference of more than 1 ' , and generally of not more than 0''5 ; whereas an inland sea in those latitudes might he expected to show extremely low temperatures at depths .

|| Sir Edward Sabine thus describes the mode of proceeding in making the temperature-soundings:\#151 ; " The cylinder , having the thermometer enclosed , was attached to the sounding-line , and was dropped into the sea from the extremity of a spar run out frt\gt ; m the side of the ship , the line to which it was attached passing round a pulley near the end of the spar .
In a similar way the cylinder when coming up from the bottom was waited for by a boat near the end of the spar , the cylinder released , and conveyed carefully by hand in an upright position to Capt. Claveeing or myself at the gangway ( or by ourselves ) , by whom the degree recorded by the index was immediately noted .
The record by the thermometer was then written down on the spot antecedently to any discussion or comment , the record being made either by Capt. Clavering or myself .
The spar from the end of which the thermometer case was dropped into the sea was always several feet distant from the side of the ship .
" 4 l 2 there is reason to believe that thermometers of stronger make than usual , and so better adapted to resist pressure , were used by Ross and Parry in their voyages of 1818-19* .
The usual correction , therefore , cannot be applied to their observations of that date .
Little or none may be needed .
In 1822 Sir Edward Sabine made an observation on the temperature of the Caribbean Sea at a depth of 6000 feet ( the actual length of rope was 7380 feet , but of this 1380 feet were allowed for slack and drift ) , and a reading of 45'*5 F. was obtained*)* .
On another occasion on this voyage , Sir Edward used a solid iron case to protect the thermometer against pressure , but it did not prove sufficiently close to exclude water .
In 1823\#151 ; 26 Kotzebue commanded another voyage of circumnavigation $ , and on this occasion he was accompanied by Emil , yon Lenz , who subsequently published several important memoirs on the deep-sea temperatures and on the specific gravity of seawater taken on this occasion S. His observations are remarkable from their being made at greater depths and their recording lower temperatures than any others made up to that time , or , in fact , until long subsequently , in tropical seas .
One observation , in the Pacific , 21'T4 north latitude , indicated at a depth of 5835 feet , by his corrected reading , a temperature of 360,4 F. , and another , 6476 feet deep , in the Atlantic , 32'*20 north latitude , gave 35''8 F. Although only fifteen observations were made , they were mostly at considerable depths , and they were all taken with various precautions and subjected to careful corrections || .
On his first voyage Kotzebue experienced so much trouble with the self-registering thermometer , owing to the mercury passing over the index and to the shifting of the index from jolts or shaking , that on this second voyage Lenz reverted to Hales 's mode of taking deep-sea temperatures , using an improved apparatus arranged by Parrot , the Russian Academician % The apparatus , which he termed a bathometer , was 16 inches high by 11 inches in diameter , and held 27*49 kil .
( six gallons ) of water .
It had valves at top and bottom opening upwards , and connected by a rod , to which was attached a mercurial thermometer made specially to bear pressure , with a ball 5 lines thick .
The apparatus was covered over with four alternating layers of sheet iron and canvas , saturated with a mixture of boiling tallow and wax , and the whole enveloped in a cloth painted over several times .
It was calculated to bear a pressure of 3000 toises ( 19,150 feet ) , and the practice was to leave it at the bottom 15 minutes .

found to leak slightly ; but it was considered that the expansion of the water in coming to the surface would compensate for this loss .
This instrument was placed in water at 67 ' F. ( 19'*4 C. ) until it acquired its temperature .
It was then replaced with other water at 32 ' .
Left in it for two hours , the temperature of the water in the bathometer fell to 52'*7 , showing a difference , in that time , of 14'*3 , which difference Lenz further estimated would have amounted only to 7 ' had the apparatus passed through water ranging from 32 ' to 67 ' , instead of being exposed to a constant temperature of 32 ' .
Taking this as the rate of refrigeration at given temperatures and in given time , Lenz then employed Biot 's formula for ascertaining the gain or loss of heat of a body placed in a medium possessing a higher or lower temperature than itself , as the basis for calculating the correction required in each particular observation .
Corrections were also made for the depths , by allowing on the one hand for the angle of the rope from the vertical , and on the other for the gain in length by tension under water* .
Lenz gives a Table of his observations as originally taken , and again repeats the Table with the corrected temperatures and depths .
These two are combined in the following Table , in which it is shown that , even with uncorrected readings , Lenz obtained on three occasions a temperature below 4 ' C. , while six corrected readings indicate a temperature below 3 ' Cent. , or of from 36 ' to 37 ' Fahr. Date .

In 1825 an important expedition* , under the command of Captain Beechey , was despatched by the Government round Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean and Behring Strait .
Aided by Mr. Collie , the Surgeon , a large and valuable series of meteorological observations were made , including ninety-seven single and serial experiments on deep-sea temperatures in the North and South Atlantic and North and South Pacific , ranging from lat. 56 ' S. to 70 ' N. , and at depths from 30 to 5124 feet .
These were arranged in Tables according to latitude for each ocean .
No very low temperatures are recorded , but the decrease with the depth is persistent , Six 's thermometers were used , but no particulars are given of how they were used f. The great voyage of Admiral FitzRoy from 1826 to 1836 , productive as it was of such valuable results in other branches of science , added little to our knowledge of deep-sea physics .
Only two sets of observations , both serial , were made in the Indian Ocean at depths of from 30 to 2500 feetj .
Six 's thermometers are mentioned , but without any other particulars .
In 1826-29 also another important surveying and exploring expedition S proceeded from France under the command of Captain Dumont D'Urville , aided by a staff of scientific officers .
He was instructed by Arago to pay particular attention to deep-sea soundings and temperatures , and informed of the precautions essential in making such observations .
D'Urville proceeded from Toulon through the Straits of Gibraltar to Teneriffe , across the Indian Ocean to Australia , New Zealand , the Eastern Archipelago , and back by the Mauritius , the Cape , and Ascension , making observations in all the seas he traversed , at depths varying from 50 to 6160 feet , and to the number altogether of 66 , the lowest temperature recorded being 40 ' .
These he tabulated according to zones of depth ; and he incorporated also in his Tables the experiments of all preceding observers , beginning with Cook and Forster .
D'Urville concluded from his observations that in the open ocean the temperature at and below 3198 feet ( 600 brasses ) nearly constant between 39 ' and 41'\#151 ; that it might be perhaps 40 ' Fahr. He also supposed that a belt of this uniform temperature existed between the latitudes of 40 ' and 60 ' .
D'Urville was evidently led to this hypothesis of a zone of uniform temperature from assuming the greatest density of sea-water to be , as with fresh water , between 39 ' and 40 ' .
His observations in the Mediterranean confirmed those of Saussure , viz. that the waters of that sea , below the depth of 1000 feet , had a uniform temperature of about 55 ' .
In 1828 Graah made a few observations in the North Atlantic || , but no particulars are given of the instruments he used .

Berard , in 1831-32* , made another series of observations in the Mediterranean , and ascertained that the temperature of about 55 ' , noted by Saussure and D'Urville at depths of from 1000 to 3000 , prevailed to the depth of 6400 feet .
I cannot ascertain precisely when protection against pressure on the thermometer was first used .
Parrot and LENzf made experiments on the effects of compression on thermometers in 1832 , and found that in ordinary instruments they were excessive ; but this did not apply to Six 's self-registering thermometer , which from its form of construction offers much greater resistance to compression .
It seems to me , however , that some form of protection must have been adopted by the French several years earlier .
It is true that D'Urville merely says that he was provided with two of Bunten 's instruments , and makes no mention of the mode in which they were used ; but on comparing his observations in the Mediterranean , where the bathymetrical isotherms are at nearly constant levels , I find his results in such close agreement with those of Aim , obtained with protected instruments , and so free from variation dependent on depth alone , that I can only conclude that D'Urville 's thermometers were likewise protected .
In the same way I infer that Berard also used similar instruments J. Thus their respective readings give :\#166 ; \#151 ; 1826 .

1148 ft. 54'-6 Fahr. For this reason I think it not improbable that the ocean observations of D'Urville were made with the same precautions , and need little or no correction .
In 1839 Captain WauchopeS recorded two more experiments made by him in 1836 in tropical regions at depths of 180U and 3918 feet , showing respectively temperatures of 52 ' and 43 ' .
He also surmised that at a certain depth there might be a uniform temperature of about 40 ' in all seas .
But the most remarkable voyage || of the period was that of Captain Abel Du Petit-Thouabs between 1836 and 1839 .
This expedition sailed from Breast in December 1836 , touched at Teneriffe , Bio Janeiro , sailed round Cape Horn along the South-American coast , thence to the Sandwich Islands , and back by New Zealand , Bourbon , and the Cape .
Fifty-nine observations were made ; but eleven failed owing to accidents with * Bkrai:i ) s observations are taken from AimL 's paper quoted further on .

the instruments , and twenty gave wrong readings owing to the great pressure forcing water into the cylinder .
Amongst the successful observations , two at a depth of 6600 feet in the Pacific , and of 6000 feet off the Cape , recorded temperatures of 36'*1 and 37''4 ; a third in the North Atlantic , lat. 40,23 and 6406 feet deep , gave 37'*8 F. ; while another , at a depth of 12,271 feet near the equator in the Pacific ( on which occasion the cylinder was crushed by the pressure and the instrument broken , and the index jammed and fixed ) , gave a reading of 340,8 or 35'Fahr .
This was the first voyage in which precautions against pressure were systematically and professedly taken ; instruments of special construction were provided .
The form adopted was Six 's thermometer , modified by Bunten , of Paris .
They were enclosed in strong brass cylinders * to protect them from pressure , and they were always left down for half an hour .
After the return of the expedition the thermometers were tried with a standard instrument , and found to have a reading only to of a degree Cent , higher than on starting .
It was found , however , that the cylinder would not bear a pressure of more than about 12,000 feet ; and that at all depths it was occasionally filled with water .
In these latter cases Du Petit-Thouars used a correction of which we shall speak presently , and gives the corrected with the uncorrected reading .
Corrections were also made for the angle the rope took with the vertical .
There is therefore every reason to suppose that the deep-sea temperatures obtained on this voyage may be accepted as perfectly reliable .
The ' Bonite , ' under the command of Captain Vaillantf , was also despatched from France in 1836 to the Indian Ocean , Chinese seas , and the Pacific .
Sixteen observations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are recorded at depths of from 244 to 8838 feet .
The ' Bonite ' was likewise provided with Bunten 's thermometers .
They were wrapped in wool and placed in a glass tube , which again was enclosed in a copper cylinder closed by a screw at each end , and left down 18 to 20 minutes .
In the first deep sounding ( 700 brasses ) recorded the cylinder is stated to have come up full of water .
This throws doubt on all the subsequent experiments ; and as no reference at all is made to the state of the cylinder in the other soundings , and the readings are more concordant with the " full cylinder " ones of Du Petit-Thouars , I think a correction should be applied to all his deeper observations .
A large number of surface-temperatures were taken , and it was remarked again that in the Pacific the sea is more frequently warmer than the air , except under the equator .
Another voyage J of research was undertaken by France in 1838 to the Arctic seas , * Du Petit-Thouars gives no particulars of the construction of his instruments ; hut Arago , in his report of the results obtained on this voyage , speaks of the " thermometrographe de M. Bunten enferme dans un etui eylindrique en laiton de 33*4 mill , de diametre interieur et de 15*6 mill , d'epaisseur , " which I presume refers to Du Petit-Thouars 's instruments.\#151 ; Comptes Rendus , 1840 , vol. xi .

and a series of twenty-three interesting experiments were made by MM .
Martins* and Bravais between the North Cape and Spitzbergen , and off the west coast of that island , in depths of from 200 to 2460 feet .
The principle of overflow differential thermometers had been revived by WALFERDiNf in 1836\#151 ; a maximum one for the purpose of taking the higher temperatures of deep wells and mines , and a minimum one for deep-sea soundings .
These instruments were free from the inconveniences of Cavendish 's , were of easy manipulation , and could bear jerks without affecting the registering column of mercury .
To protect them against pressure they were enclosed in a tube of glass , of thickness proportional to the pressure to which it would be exposed , and hermetically sealed at both ends .
M. Walferdin claimed for these thermometers greater accuracy and certainty than the ordinary self-registering thermometers J. These thermometers , termed " thermometres a deversement , " were used by Martins and Bravais on their voyage to Spitzbergen , in conjunction with Six 's thermometers ( thermometrographes ) modified by Bunten , of Paris .
The former were enclosed in glass tubes exhausted as much as possible , and the latter in copper tubes , evidently not strong enough , as they " almost always came up full of water .
" To ensure accuracy , they employed in all these observations two instruments of each sort , and in some cases as many as four , and took the mean of each set .
When sunk to the bottom they were raised 1 metre from it , and left there for an hour .
Sometimes the thermometrographs were not protected ; and in that case , or when the tubes were full of water , a correction was applied , of which we shall speak further on .
A correction was also used for the angle of the rope with the vertical .
M. Martins states that he had much more confidence in Walferdin 's thermometers than in Bunten 's .
I find , however , that , taking the 18 observations made with sets of the former , the average variation for each set amounted to 0'-45 Cent. , or , averaging the variation of each of the 52 instruments employed , to 0'T6 C. , while the 10 observations with 23 instruments of the latter give respectively 0'T8 C. and 0o,08 C. ; but M. Martins shows that while the mean of the differences is 0'*19 C. at depths not exceeding 131 metres , it is reduced to 0O-06 C. at depths of 640 to 870 metres .
The readings , on the whole , of Walferdin 's instruments are very slightly lower than those of Bunten 's ; as they were more relied on by the observers , I have given them in the Tables in preference to the others .
But notwithstanding the successful use of Walferdin 's instruments on this voyage , * Voyage de ' La Recherche/ Geogr .

The latter were affected both from water getting into the case and from lowering of the index by shaking .
In another case , two of his instruments both registered 23'*5 C. , and two thermometrographs 23'*45 and 23o-50 , while another of the latter had its index displaced by the shaking of the line.\#151 ; Ibid. vol. ix .

In 1838 a few observations were made in the Indian Ocean by the Rev. J. H. Pratt\#177 ; .
*T*# An American expedition made the round of the world in 1839\#151 ; 42 under the command of Captain Wilkes , who gives twenty-eight S deep-sea temperatures at depths of from 60 to 5100 feet in the South Pacific and Southern Oceans , in one case recording a temperature of 27'*5 at a depth of 1420 feet in the latter sea .
The subject was afterwards || further discussed by Captain Wilkes in a separate paper , in which he expressed an opinion that there existed a zone of the uniform mean temperature of 390,5 Fahr. It would appear that Six 's thermometers without protection were used .
In the same year ( 1839 ) a very important expedition was despatched from this country to the Antarctic seas under the command of Captain Sir James C. Ross .
A special code of instructions was drawn up by a Committee of the Royal Society .
Numerous results of great value were obtained , especially those relating to the soundings and seabed of the Antarctic Ocean .
As many as 161 deep-sea temperature-observations are recorded , chiefly in the Southern and Antarctic Oceans , with a few in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans % They vary in depth from 12 to 7200 feet ; some of the soundings were much deeper .
These temperature-soundings claim particular notice in consequence of the undue weight which has been attached to them .
In starting Sir James Ross took with him a supply of Six 's thermometers ; but he gives no description of how they were used , or what precautions were adopted ** .
The observations also are not tabulated , but are scattered through the work without plan or order ; and it is at times difficult to fix on their exact position , date , \amp ; c. It would appear that , owing to want of protection and the great depths at which they were used , all the instruments he took with him from England were broken by the time he reached the Southern Ocean .

** Dr. Hooker , who accompanied the expedition , informs me that no precautions were taken against pressure , hut that to prevent breakage " the thermometers were enclosed in a copper cylinder .
Sometimes two thermometers were placed at different points of the same line ( say 500 and 1000 fathoms ) , at others the line was drawn up and sunk again to a greater or less depth .
The first fathoms of the line were spun yarn , the next of 3 plies of the same , the rest whole line .
" It was hauled in by the whole ship 's company .
Dr. Hooker also says " that the average length of time , speaking entirely from memory , during which the thermometers were left at the depths reached was a quarter of an hour .
" MR. J. PRESTWICH ON SUBMARINE TEMPERATURES .
He then wrote to England for stronger registering thermometers , which were sent to him in Australia , but of which he gives no particulars further than stating that they were stronger .
Before receiving these , he apparently renewed his observations with instruments obtained in Australia .
Consequently it is probable that each of these sets of instruments were of different construction , and may require a different correction\#151 ; those used during the first part of the voyage a larger correction than those used during the latter period .
In the absence of sufficient information this cannot be attempted ; and the general formula given further on has been applied to the correction of all his observations I have had occasion to use in the construction of the sections .
With regard to the observations themselves , they may be also sometimes open to objection in consequence of the great difficulties under which they were so constantly taken .
The severe cold , the inclemency of the weather , and the tediousness of the operation are all elements of possible error to be taken into account .
The one cause may have led at times to the shifting of the index , and the other to some want of accuracy in the reading ; for I cannot conceive it possible for any set of thermometers to have recorded , in the innumerable cases mentioned , the same one and uniform temperature of 39'*5 at and beyond a certain depth .
Even supposing a uniform temperature of that exact degree did exist at certain determined depths , it is in the highest degree improbable that any instruments would give the exact same record .
There is not only the risk of shifting of the index , but there is the certainty that the ordinary imperfection and variation of the instruments would most certainly prevent it .
With the greatest care and with standard instruments especially selected , MM .
Martins and Bravais , out of ten sets of observations each made with two , three , or four thermometers , only give one instance in which the readings of two of them agree .
In the other cases they differ from 0'T to 1 ' Fahr. Nevertheless , apart from this point , and supposing them to be approximately correct , the observations of Sir James Boss are , from their number , depth , and position , very valuable , and , subject to correction , they furnish fairly available results , although , from the cause before mentioned , it may not be certain whether the correction applied gives the true reading in all cases within one , two degrees , or in some cases possibly more .
Owing also to this use of unprotected instruments Boss came to the same conclusion as D'Urville with respect to the existence of a zone of a uniform surface-temperature in given latitudes , and likewise with respect to the persistence of the same uniform temperature of 39'*5 Fahr. at given depths in the great oceans .
In this opinion he seems to have been biased , similarly with his predecessors , by the belief that the density of sea-water was , like that of fresh wrater , greatest at that temperature .
In 1840-44 M. Aim made a series of important observations on the temperature of the air and sea between Marseilles and Algiers* .
The experiments , which were carried on for a series of years , proved that the diurnal variations of temperature in the Medi- * " Memoir\#169 ; sir la temperature de la Mediterranee , " Annals de Chimie et de Physique , 1845 , 3me se'r .

terranean ceased at a depth of 60 feet , and the annual variations at a depth of from 1150 to 1300 feet .
At this point Amiss found a uniform temperature of 54'*7 , and was of opinion , from the observations of Berard , that no increase took place at greater depths .
This degree he showed to be the average of the mean temperature between Toulon and Algiers , of the months of January , February , and March .
In order to determine whether the decrease of temperature was gradual , or whether the instrument passed through warmer strata , Aim also used a thermometer which was let down upright and reversed at the bottom of the soundings .
This he termed a " thermometre a retournement .
" Besides these , AiMfi employed the ordinary selfregistering thermometer with an enlargement in one part of the tube to remedy the inconvenience of the quicksilver passing over the index .
These several instruments were enclosed in copper cylinders strong enough to resist the pressure to which they were subjected .
For moderate depths he preferred a glass tube hermetically sealed In 1845 Captain ( now Admiral ) Spratt made 15 observations f from the surface to a depth of 1260 feet , in the Grecian archipelago , and obtained results in perfect accordance with those of Saussure and Aim in the Western Mediterranean .
He afterwards made a more extended series of observations ( 34 in all ) and to greater depths ( 7440 feet ) in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean from Malta to Egypt J. Admiral Spratt at first used Six 's thermometer ; but finding that the index often moved , he resorted , in shallow seas of the archipelago , to the plan of taking the temperature of the mud brought up from the bottom by means of a sound formed of iron tubing .
This plan , Admiral Spratt considered , gave more reliable results than the other .
In every case in Forbes 's VII.th zone , or between 1080 and 1200 feet , the mud indicated a temperature of 55'*5 ; and he concluded that there was no reason to suppose the temperature to be lower than 55 ' at any depth under 1800 feet .
In the deeper waters he reverted to the use of Six 's thermometer .
Captain ( now Admiral Sir Edward ) Belcher gives a series of eight observations he made in mid-Atlantic when crossing the equator in 1843 , at depths of from 1800 to 6000 feetS .
Sir Edward informs me that a much larger number were made , but that they were not published at the time and have been unfortunately lost , with the exception of the few others recorded by Sir James Ross|| .
Sir Edward Belcher also mentions that he had a water-bottle of great strength , with two enclosed thermometers specially made by Carey , and that these instruments " were tested continuously between 1835 and 1846 , and never found to vary from each other or from the standard which I [ Sir E. B. j now possess , and which belonged to the Old Board of Longitude .

They were made to go inside the water-bottle , and not subjected to jerks of the line , which we found often moved the indices " * .
In 1845-51 Captain Kellett , in his voyagef to the Pacific and Behring Strait , made 38 observations to depths of 3000 feet , several of them serial , some in mid-Atlantic , others in the Pacific , ranging from near the Equator to Behring Straits , and seven in the Arctic Ocean beyond .
Six 's thermometers without protection were used .
Lieutenant ( afterwards Commander ) Dayman , who served on the surveying-ship 6 Rattlesnake , ' made a series of one hundred and ten observations in the Atlantic , Indian , and Southern Oceans , at depths generally of from 1000 to 2000 feet J. While the readings given by other observers who used unprotected self-registering thermometers agree fairly well among themselves , those recorded by Dayman are much higher in proportion .
But as he gives no particulars of his instruments , or of the mode in which they were used , it is not possible to say how the difference arises or what the error may be ; it seems uniformly too high by 1 ' or 2 ' .
There are also anomalies in the lists , which leads me to suppose that the readings of the lesser and greater depths have sometimes been transposed .
The readings , however , have a certain independent value inter se as furnishing comparative temperatures at corresponding depths .
Sir A. Armstrong S , who was with Captain McClure on his memorable voyage along the coast of Arctic America , records three observations made on the voyage out round Cape Horn , and three in the Arctic Ocean after passing Behring Strait .
No mention is made of the thermometers , except that they were Six 's " self-registering .
" In the series|| of " Reports " to the Government of the United States much valuable information is given with respect to the temperature of the seas off the North-American coast , and especially of the Gulf-stream at various depths .
As the original observations are , however , not recorded , but only the diagrams founded on them , I am unable , with two or three exceptions , to give any tabulated details , and must refer to the " Reports " themselves for fuller information .

Captain Maury has given* incidentally a few deep-sea temperatures made by the U. S/ Coast Survey ( Dunsterville , Brooke , and Rodgers ) during the few years previous to the publication of his work ; but it is a subject which he does not treat so fully as other points of ocean physics .
It is not stated what instruments were employed .
On the voyage of H.M.S. 4Cyclops ' in 1857 , forty-one important observations were made by Captain Pullen in the North and South Atlantic , Indian Ocean , and Red Sea , at depths of from 2400 to about 16,000 feetf .
It was on this voyage that the first regular precautions against pressure were taken in this country .
Captain Pullen was furnished , by order of the late Admiral FitzRoy , with some instruments constructed purposely for deep-sea observations , the object of which was explained in the following memorandum , communicated to me by Captain Pullen :\#151 ; " In Six 's self-registering thermometer , the long bulb , filled with spirits of wine , is so delicate , that under a great pressure of ocean it is more or less compressed , and drives the spirit against the mercury , which is thus acted on not only by temperature , but by the mechanical pressure of sea-water .
" With a view to obviate this failing , Messrs. Negretti and Zambra undertook to make a case for a weak bulb , which should transmit temperature , but resist pressure .
" Accordingly a tube of thick glass is sealed outside of the delicate bulb , between which and the casing is a space all round , which is nearly filled with mercury .
" The small space not so filled is a vacuum , into which the mercury can be expanded , or forced , by heat or mechanical compression , without doing injury to , or even compressing , the inner and much more delicate bulb .
" This provision is meant to guard against possible compression of even the outer glass , strong as it is .
" One may ask , Why not strengthen the inner tube , the bulb , at once , so as to be equal in power of resistance to the outer casing % Mr. Glaisher and the makers say no ; the bulb will yield a little , on account of its length , be it even as strong as the outer case .

" With these instruments Captain Pullen made a series of observations , and was the first in this country to confirm the .
observations of the continental observers that so low a temperature as 35 ' existed in the depths of intertropical seas .
In reply to my inquiries , Captain Pullen informs me that , after comparing the deep-sea thermometers with standards kept on deck and setting the indices , " they were placed in copper cylinders , * The Physical Geography of the Sea .

with a valve at each end both opening upwards , so that on going down a column of water passed through .
On arriving at the depth , and you commence hauling in , these valves close , thus cutting off a portion of water at that depth , which was brought up and tested for density and its then temperature .
Indices read off both from maximum and minimum scale and noted .
But I have often found that the maximum index shifted , showing a different reading from what it stood at when started .
Now whether this would affect the minimum side is a question .
" Captain Pullen thinks not .
But there are inequalities in some cases so apparent that they can hardly be accounted for , except by a shifting of the index .
In one instance , in fact , while the thermometer at 7890 feet indicated 41'* , the index , owing to rough weather , had shifted to 67 ' at a depth of 11760 feet .
Captain Pullen speaks also of some of the instruments being more regular in their indications than others .
After , however , eliminating those readings , which are evidently too high ( marked with a 1 in Tables ) , the value of the other observations remains unaffected .
The Austrian Expedition of the 'Novara ' in 1857-60 f , under the command of Admiral Yon Wullerstorf , made an extraordinary number of daily meteorological observations , from which it is difficult to extract the few scattered notices respecting the temperature at depths .
Although they amount to 33 in number , they are mostly at depths under 1000 feet , and none exceed 1500 feet .
They embrace eleven observations in the Mediterranean to depths of not more than 760 feet .
It was apparently on this occasion that the water-bucket was last used .
All that is said on the subject is that " for these observations a wooden cylinder furnished with valves was generally employed ; but an English apparatus has also frequently been made use of , which consists of a similarly constructed copper cylinder , with an easily affected maximum and minimum thermometer , so that by it water was not only brought up from a depth , but also the highest and lowest temperatures of the layers of water through which the sounding was made were ascertained .
" No other particulars are given , and no mention is made in the several observations of which instrument was used .
Wul-lerstorf 's observations , as I read them , differ so greatly from those of other observers , that I can only attribute it to some undetected source of error .
The readings seem much too high and out of proportion with the others ; but still they have a certain value in their comparative temperatures .
In 1859 Captain KundsonJ made four temperature-soundings between Iceland and Greenland , at depths of 1200 to 1800 feet ; and in 1861 Dr. Ed. LenzS records a * In two other cases also the bottom-temperature is recorded as higher than those at lesser depths .

series of observations made in the North and South Atlantic , at a uniform depth of 360 feet , the importance of which consists in showing , as Horner and Kotzebue had previously done , that near the equator the water at and beneath the surface is colder than a few degrees further north and south .
Six 's self-registering thermometers were used .
No protection mentioned .
Dr. Wallich* gives , in 1862 , one temperature-observation at a depth of 600 feet , on the well-known occasion of the deep-sea soundings between England and America .
Between 1860 and 1868 the several other expeditions undertaken to obtain deep-sea soundings in different parts of the world for telegraphic purposes afforded favourable opportunities for temperature-observations .
Such were those obtained in 1868 by Capt. Shorthand *[* between Bombay and Aden , which are recorded in a series of means .
They extend in one case to the depth of 13,020 feet , and give a reading of 33'*5 , and in another , more westward , to 7800 feet , with a reading of 36 ' .
These readings have , I presume , been corrected from the original observations .
Again , in 1868 Commander Chimmo J made a series of observations on the American side of the North Atlantic , at depths extending to 12,000 feet , and recording temperatures of 42 ' .
It is merely stated that the experiments were made with " new and delicate thermometers , " which were without protection , and the readings are uncorrected .
In August 1868 the ' Lightning ' sailed on the first of that series of deep-sea researches which , conducted under the combined superintendence of Dr. Carpenter and Professor Wyville Thomson , with the addition afterwards of Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys , and followed up systematically in subsequent voyages , have already yielded such valuable and important information on the natural history and physics of the depths of the sea .
Regarding the relative merits of the several methods employed by the early observers , a few words may be said .
The water-bucket , when properly constructed , of sufficient size , and when well handled , was not badly contrived to determine the temperature at moderate depths .
It was free from the errors of pressure and index to which thermometers are liable .
The errors depend upon the size of the apparatus , the proper closing of the valves , the rapidity of hauling in , and the difference of temperature between the bottom- and surface-waters .
When the latter is not great the error can be but small ; and such is the case in those Arctic seas where it has been chiefly used .
As so considerable a number of observations were made with this apparatus by Scoresby and Franklin , it might be desirable to determine by experiment the amount of correction required to adjust the error of this particular apparatus .
In the case of Lenz 's bathometer , he made a series of experiments to determine * The North-Atlantic Sea-Bed , 1862 , p. 145 .

the corrections necessary for his several observations .
He showed that a variety of considerations have to be taken into account with Hales 's water-bucket or any similar apparatus , and that the scale of corrections must vary with the latitude and the depth .
Thus in lat. 21 ' 14 ' N. , with a surface-temperature of 790,5 F. and at a depth of 2635 feet , his corrections amounted to 4 ' F. , while in lat. 45 ' 53 ' , with a surface-temperature of 58'*3 and at a depth of 2524 feet , they amounted only to 0'*6 F. , and , again , for the lesser depths of 898 and 1252 feet in the same latitude respectively to 0'*4 F. and to 0o,6 F. The same corrections cannot , however , be applied to the observations of Ellis , Cooej Forster , Irving , Scoresby , Franklin , and Wauchope ; for in the case of the first three and of Franklin the apparatus was not protected by any other non-conducting substances ; in the case of Wauchope 's and Scoresby 's later experiments the correction must be applied to the enclosed Six thermometer ; and in Irving 's the small size o* the apparatus , although protected , * necessitates a larger correction .
It is , nevertheless , satisfactory to note , from the regular decrease in the value of the corrections from the equator to the pole , that in the higher latitudes , where Hales 's apparatus has been most used , the special corrections needed for that apparatus diminish to their minimum , and are so small that probably 0o,5 to 1 ' would cover all the errors of observation made by the foregoing explorers .
The main error for correction is that due to pressure in those instances where a Six 's thermometer has been used in conjunction with Hales 's apparatus .
The second plan , that of sinking an ordinary thermometer , protected and surrounded by some substances which are bad conductors , has been but little used , as it requires so much time .
Independently of this , and for moderate depths , it is trustworthy and useful , and some of the results , as those of Saussure , may be accepted as closely accurate .
The third plan , that of taking the temperature of mud or silt brought up from the bottom , has the advantage that it secures the possession of a body having the exact bottom-temperature ; but it has the disadvantage of small bulk , and therefore of being more influenced by the temperature of the water through which it has to pass .
For moderate depths , however , the error can only be small .
The first and last of these methods , whatever their inconveniences , had but one main source of error\#151 ; causing a gain where the surface-temperature is higher , and a loss where lower , than that at depths .
Only in one instance , however , was the necessary correction accurately estimated .
But with the introduction of the self-registering thermometer two sources of error ( the one occasional and uncertain in amount , arising from shifting of the indices ; and the other fixed and definite , resulting from pressure ) were introduced .
Owing also to the want of standard instruments , the observations made on the several voyages have had in themselves different degrees of value , dependent on the care with which the instruments were made , and on the precautions with which they were used .
As such precautions were , it is evident , usually enforced , and Admiralty instruments were generally used , a considerable uniformity of result has been nevertheless maintained ; and the readings on the different voyages agree sufficiently well amongst themselves to allow , with reasonable success , of the application of the same correction to all , excepting those of Dayman , and perhaps one or two others , which require larger corrections , and Wullerstorf 's , which are uncertain .
With these few exceptions , and admitting slight qualifications for each particular case , the larger number of the early observations may , subject to a correction for pressure , be accepted as approximately accurate .
The need of this correction for pressure was , as I have before observed , noted so early as 1823 ; but it was not until the voyage of 'La Venus ' that the necessary precautions wTere professedly taken against it , and that experiments were made to estimate its amount .
Such estimates were then made by Du Petit-Thouars in tropical seas , subsequently by Martins and Bravais in arctic seas , and afterwards by Aim in an inland sea .
The results of the several calculations are as follows:\#151 ; -Du Petit-Thouars made experiments with a protected and an unprotected thermometer at a depth of 1000 brasses or 1620 metres , which is equal to a pressure of 162 atmospheres , and he was led to adopt a coefficient of 0O-01 Cent , per atmosphere as the measure of correction needed for unprotected thermometers .
This gives 1 ' C. per 100 atmospheres , or of 1'*8 F. per 3200 feet , or 1 ' Faiir .
= 1780 feet .
Cii .
Martins concluded from his experiments , which were on a more limited depth , that a coefficient of 0'*13 Cent , per 100 metres , or of lO-30 C. per 1000 metres* ( equal to 20,3 Fahr. per 3280 feet , or 1 ' for every 1426 feet ) , was required .
Aim , again , from experiments in the Mediterranean with his special thermometro-graphs , came to the same conclusion as Du Petit-Tiiouars , viz. that for the pressure of every 100 atmospheres the instrument required a correction of about 1 ' Cent. These conclusions agree very closely with the more recent researches of Dr. Carpenter and the late Dr. Miller .
The latter showedf that under a pressure of tons ( or 374 atmospheres ) per square inch , Six 's unprotected self-registering thermometers of three different constructions gave readings from 7'*5 to 10 ' Fahr. too high .
Excluding the effects of the small amount of heat evolved from the water by compression ( or some undetermined cause ) , which was found equal to 0'*9 , the mean error of the three was 80,6 F. \#151 ; 0o,9 = 7'*7 ; and , taking the pressure of one ton as equivalent to a depth of 800 fathoms , this would be equal to a rise of 1 ' F. for every 1560 feet .
But in those experiments one instrument ( Six 's , with a spherical bulb ) gave a variation of 2 ' in excess of the one with cylindrical bulb and of the Admiralty instrument .
Now , as the two latter are of the forms almost always used , and Bunten 's instruments had also a cylindrical bulb , it is a question whether the one with spherical bulb should not be excluded .
In that case the reading of the other two gives a mean of 8'F .
\#151 ; 0o,9=7'T as the error for pressure of 2\ tons , or equal to 1 ' Fahr. for every 1690 feet .
It is true that considerable variation was found to exist in the effects of pressure on * M. Martins took the differences between each of the protected and unprotected " thermometrographes , " and these he diminished in each case by 0'*1 , \#151 ; " quantite cgale a la poussee de rindex .

some other instruments ; but with the care taken in the construction of our best thermometers , and of those of Bunten , which were generally employed , the chances of greater variation than that here indicated are reduced to a minimum* .
The foregoing estimates show that with good instruments the effect of pressure equals an increase of about 1 ' F. for every 1400 to 1800 feet of depth ; and in adopting a coefficient of 1 ' F. for every 1700 feet as the necessary correction of all the observations in the Tables , excepting those made with protected instruments or corrected by the original observer , and excepting also those before named as requiring larger corrections in consequence of using unfit or unsuitable instruments or instruments of a different class , I feel that I am below rather than above the true measure of allowance .
S III .
Summary of the preceding Observations .
Although the early observers noted the decrease of temperature with the increase of depth , it was not until 1828-26 that Lenz proved that this decrease held good to the greater depths of temperate and tropical seas , and that the water at depths in the open oceans was but little above the zero of Centigrade .
The substitution of the self-registering thermometer for the older methods led for a time , owing to the neglected error of pressure , to a retrograde course ; for the voyages of Beechey , Kellett , and others which followed between 1826 and 1836 , while they added largely to the number of observations at greater depths , gave , in so doing , increased importance to the error , from the circumstance that the pressure on the instrument not only counterbalanced the effect of the greater cold at increased depths , but often gave readings ( uncorrected ) somewhat higher at those depths than at lesser ones .
From this cause , and from inattention to the different properties of sea- and fresh water , an erroneous conclusion was drawn from observations otherwise valuable , which for a time greatly retarded the progress of ocean physics .
The first to fall into this error was D'Urville , who , misled by the coincidence of temperature obtained by him in some of his deepest soundings , and of the nearly like minimum temperature ( 4 ' to 5 ' C. ) so frequently recorded ( with his unprotected thermometers ) by Beechey and others at greater depths , concluded , in ignorance apparently of Lenz 's observations , that this uniformity of temperature was the result of a general * With respect to these variations , Dr. Carpenter , after speaking of the results obtained on the ' Porcupine expedition with the Miller-Casella instrument , observes:\#151 ; " With these results , obtained with thermometers upon which complete reliance can be placed , those obtained last year with the best ordinary thermometers are found to be in close accordance , when the proper correction for pressure is applied to them .
" He then instances two cases in which experiments were made on both expeditions at nearly the same places and in nearly similar depths .
In one case , at a depth of 550 fathoms , the difference exceeded the estimate by about 1 ' , in the other , at a depth of 550 fathoms , it amounted to 2'"2 F. , or was " exactly equivalent to the correction for pressure at that depth in the unprotected thermometers .
" Dr. Carpenter concludes :\#151 ; " This very near accordance gave us , of course , a feeling of great satisfaction in our last year 's work ; and it fully justified our conclusion that , whatever might be the pressure-correction required by the instruments then employed , it would not affect the differences obtained at nearly approximating depths .

) 4 n 2 law dependent on the maximum density of water , which he supposed to be alike in fresh and salt water ; and he consequently assumed that a temperature of about 40,4 C. ( 40'F .
) prevailed below a certain depth in open seas* , and that in both hemispheres there was in certain latitudes a zone from the surface downwards of like uniform temperature f. On the other hand , we have seen that in 1836-39 Du Petit-Thouars fully confirmed the observations of Denz , that a temperature of from 35 ' to 37 ' existed at depths in both the great oceans .
Arago , in commenting on these results , testifies to their accuracy and importance , and remarks that " the observations collected by the 4Venus ' will occupy a distinguished place , on account of their number and exactness , and of the great depths at which they were taken .
" He also observes that , low as some of the readings are , yet all errors must be positive , and that they place on reliable grounds the great fact of the prevalence of the same low temperatures at depths in the Pacific as well as in the Atlantic , and in the equatorial regions of both oceans ; and he especially dwells on the circumstance that they tend effectually to disprove the hypothesis which had been advanced , that at great depths there existed a uniform and common temperature of 40 ' F. $ It appears , nevertheless , that so little was known of what had already been done and written , that Sir James Ross fell into the very same errors as D'Urville had made thirteen years , before .
Unfortunately in this case his conclusions were accepted without examination by distinguished writers in two popular works on Physical Geography , and obtained a currency for which it is difficult to account S. Although Sir James Ross 's experiments were in themselves valuable , they required both detail and corroboration , and his conclusions were evidently based on an assumption for which there was no warrant .
And yet , while his important and positive facts as to the persistence of life to great depths failed to receive the attention they deserved , his physical fallacies were received almost without a question .
As with his predecessor , D'Urville , Sir James found in his more numerous and deeper observations that the unprotected thermometer commonly marked a temperature of and about 39 ' to 40 ' ; and taking the maximum density of fresh water to be 39'*5 , he applied the same reasoning to the open seas as had already been applied to freshwater lakes , and assumed , exactly as D'Urville had done , that a uniform temperature of about 39'*5 prevailed at depths varying with the latitude , and that a belt of water of that temperature , extending from the surface downwards , encircles the globe between the 50th and 60th degrees of south latitude , or , as he more definitely fixes it , in a mean latitude of about 56 ' 267 S. || * Voyage , p. 62 .

Wilkes , who also explored the Antarctic seas in 1838-42 , took the same view , and for the same reasons as D'Urville , Wauchope , and Ross , of the existence of a deep-sea and of a belt of water of the uniform temperature of 39'*5 F. Commenting on the general results of this great American expedition , Biot discusses* the question of deep-sea temperatures .
He remarks that serial observations should in all cases be made , " that the instruments ought to be protected against pressure by surroundings of great strength and resistance , " and that they should be left a considerable time at the bottom .
Comparing the observations of Boss with those of Du Petit-Thouars , Scoresby , Parry , and Martins , he shows their want of agreement .
He says that the experiments of Ross depend entirely on his instruments , " of which he had no means of knowing and judging ( aucun moyen while he knew those of Du Petit-Thouars and Martins to have been prepared with every care .
For Boss , he remarks , " the uniformity of temperature at the bottom of the sea is a necessity ; " and he trusts that some steps may be taken to verify his observations , for between them and those of other observers there is , he remarks , " a complete incompatibility .
" With respect to the freezing-point and point of greatest density of sea-water , these properties were first more particularly investigated by Dr. Marcet in his well-known paper on the subject published in 1819f .
Dr. Marcet ascertained that he could lower the temperature of sea-water ( at D027 sp. gr. ) to 27 ' , and even , when in large vessels and kept perfectly still , to 18 ' or 19 ' F. , before freezing , but that when it froze it always rose to 28 ' ; and he states that his experiments " uniformly led him to the conclusion that the law of greatest specific density at 40 ' did not apply to sea-water , but that , on the where the mean temperature of the sea obtains throughout its entire depth , forming a boundary , or kind of neutral ground , between the two great thermic basins of the oceans .
To the north of this circle the sea has become warmer than its mean temperature , by reason of the sun 's heat which it has absorbed , elevating its temperature at various depths in different latitudes .
So that the line of mean temperature of 39'-5 in latitude 45 ' S. has descended to the depth of 600 fathoms ; and at the equatorial and tropical regions this mark of the limit of the sun 's influence is found at the depth of about 1200 fathoms , beneath which the ocean maintains its unvarying mean temperature of 39'-5 , whilst that of the surface is about 78 ' .
" So likewise , to the south of the circle of mean temperature , we find that , in the absence of an equal solar supply , the radiation of the heat of the ocean into space occasions the sea to be of a colder temperature as we advance to the south ; and near the 70th degree of latitude we find the line of mean temperature has descended to the depth of 750 fathoms , beneath which again , to the greatest depths , the temperature of 39'-5 obtains , whilst that of the surface is 30 ' .
" The experiments which our limited time and means admitted of our making serve to show that the mean temperature of the ocean at present is about 39'-5 , or 7^ degrees above the freezing-point of pure water , and as nearly as possible the point of its greatest density .
But it would be indispensable that this temperature should be ascertained to the tenth part of a degree ; and as we now know where we may send any number of thermometers down to the greatest fathomable depths without an alteration of temperature , even to that small amount , this desideratum might be very easily obtained .

contrary , sea-water gradually increased in weight down to the freezing-point , until it actually congealed .
" Other experiments led him to fix this point of greatest density at 22 ' F. Eeman* in 1828 fixed the maximum density of sea-water of 1*027 specific gravity at 25 ' F. , and found likewise that it did not reach its maximum before congelation .
Still more conclusive were the more elaborate experiments of Despretz'j* in 1837 .
Taking distilled water at a temperature of 20 ' C. and sea-water of the specific gravity of 1*027 at 20 ' C. , he successfully determined the following important points Cent. Pahr .
o o Maximum density of fresh water ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .+ 4 =39*2 , , sea-water ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \#151 ; 3*67 = 25*4 Point of congelation of sea-water ... ... ... ... ... ... \#151 ; 2*55=27*4 Temperature of sea-water during congelation . . .
\#151 ; 1*88 = 28*6 He also showed that the freezing-point and the point of maximum density were proportionate to the quantity of saline matter in the water , and that both therefore varied with the degree of salinity of the sea .
The effects of pressure and the properties of fresh and salt water were therefore perfectly well understood previous to the date of Ross 's voyage .
How , then , the unsupported opinion of one who , though a most able and enterprising navigator , had not any pretensions to an exact knowledge of physical science could have been accepted by scientific writers of so much eminence is a singular fact .
I can only account for it by the circumstance that the subject had not been made in this country one of special investigation , and therefore the results'of Ross 's work had not been questioned by any competent special authority .
In fact they had never been discussed .
The observations of Lenz , Hue Petit-Thouars , and others , combined with the researches of physicists , had sufficiently established the law of the decrease of temperature with the depth to 2 ' to 3 ' above the zero of Centigrade in the temperate and tropical zones of both the great oceans ; and their conclusions could hardly be considered as seriously affected by the unsupported though ingenious hypothesis of D'Urville and Ross .
Lenz had obtained , by means of his bathometer , with corrections for change of medium , the low readings given at p. 599 ; and subsequently Du Petit-Thouars by means of protected thermometers had obtained directly , without correction J , amongst a number of others at lesser depths , the following deep-sea temperatures:\#151 ; * " Nouvelles Becherclies sir le maximum de densite de l'eau salee , " Ann ales de Chimie , xxxviii .

On the other hand , in the Arctic seas , the observations of Scoresby and of Martins and Bravais showed that the temperature of the upper strata , down to a depth of 200 to 300 feet , varies greatly with the season , ranging from 8 to 10 degrees above to 3 or 4 degrees under 32 ' F. , and that with increasing depth a more uniform higher temperature prevailed .
Scoresby , whose experiments were conducted further northward and westward , found this latter temperature to be generally 3 ' or 4 ' above the freezing-point of fresh water , or 7 ' to 8 ' above that ' of sea-water .

The deepest temperature sounding was in 73 ' 36 ' N. and 20 ' 53 ' E. , in which instance Walferdin 's thermometer registered at 2854 feet 32'-2 F. , and Six 's thermometer , corrected for pressure , gave 31'*6 .
This latter is the only recorded instance in the open sea where his reading was below zero of Centigrade .
His most northern observations , viz. in 76 ' 13'N .
and 12 ' 48 ' E. , at 1296 feet , and another in the same place in 2103 feet , gave respectively 330,4 and 32'*3 ; while one of Scoresby 's , in 79 ' N. and 5 ' 40'E .

, at 1380 feet , not far from Martins 's position , gives , without allowance for pressure ( for in this case Six 's thermometer does not appear to have been used ) , a temperature of 33'*3 .
Martins , however , states that on approaching the land in Magdalena Bay , instead of a submarine temperature above zero , he found that in depths of from 110 to 136 metres the temperature of the water was always below zero ; that these bottom-waters there had , in fact , a temperature of \#151 ; 10,75 C. to \#151 ; 1'*91 C. ( 28'*6 F. ) , that of the surface being 0'T to 1'*2 Cent.* The results obtained in another section of the North Atlantic are very different and of much interest .
The observations in Davis Strait and Baffin Bay by John Ross and Sabine indicate that , after passing the point where the diurnal and annual variation cease , there is a gradual decrease of the temperature with the depth to a point approaching in places to that of the maximum density of sea-water .
Even taking the readings without correctionf , they show:\#151 ; From 1000 to 2000 feet , a temperature of ... ... ... ... ..32 to 29#5 Fahr. " 2000 to 3000 " " 30 to 29 " 3000 to 4000 " " 29 Fahr. " 5000 to 6000 " " 28f " Besides these , Parry noted , in 68'*29 N. lat. and 63'*43 W. long .

In the Antarctic seas the observations of Cook , James Ross , and Wilkes show that the temperature from the surface down to 600 or 1000 feet varies from 28 ' to 32 ' .

Still they are available after correction for pressure ; and the readings then indicate thermal conditions very similar to those which obtain in Arctic seas .

39 37-5 The conditions , therefore , prevailing in the open Arctic and Antarctic seas are apparently closely analogous , \#151 ; the temperature at a distance from land increasing with the depth until it rises to 35 ' to 36 ' F. at 2000 to 3000 feet , below which it seems to remain nearly stationary at about the same temperature ; while closer to the land and at less depths it falls nearer to the freezing-point of sea-water ( see note , , p. 635 ) .
The temperatures at depths in inland seas were found at an early period to be very different to those of open seas ; and it is singular that the very first observations made in the Mediterranean by Saussure in 1780 , of 55'*8 F. at 944 feet , and 55'*5 at 1918 feet , remain substantially correct to the present day .
It was , however , D'Urville 's more extended observations in 1826 that made better known the fact that the temperature decreased from the surface down to 200 brasses ( 1066 feet ) , below which it remained constant at about 13 ' C. , or between 54 ' and 55 ' F. Still his greatest depth did not exceed 3189 feet ; but B\#163 ; rard in 1831 extended the observations to a depth of 6377 feet , and still found the same degree of temperature .
Aim further showed , from a series of soundings made during 1840-44 in the western basin of the Mediterranean , between Marseilles and Algiers , that the diurnal variation of temperature ceases to be sensible at 16 to 18 metres , and the annual variation at 300 to 400 metres .

The marked agreement between the observations of Berard in 1831\#151 ; 32 and those of the 'Porcupine ' expedition in 1870 , leads me to suppose that the latter may be the influencing cause .
D'Urville 's observations , which were made further north in the western Mediterranean than those of Berard , agree more closely with those of Aim .

59J 58*5 Admiral Spratt concluded that " the minimum temperature of their ( Eastern Mediterranean , Grecian archipelago , Sea of Marmora , and Black Sea ) deeper parts correspond nearly with the mean annual temperature above them .
" This apparent discrepancy between Amfi and Admiral Spratt evidently arises from the circumstance that the one bases his conclusion on observations made with protected and the other with unprotected thermometers , which gave too high a reading .
Subject to correction the results are closely concordant , and both give approximately the mean sub-winter temperature .
The observations of Aim and others thus proved that in this great inland sea the influence of the variations of temperature at the surface ceases at a depth of from 1000 to 1200 feet , and that below that line a uniform temperature of from 54 ' to 55'*5 prevails in the western basin , and one possibly 0o,5 to 1 ' higher in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean .
Some deep temperature-observations have also been made in two other nearly closed seas\#151 ; the Red Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk , \#151 ; the latter by Dr. Horner in 1803 , and the former by Captain Pullen , with his protected thermometers , in 1858 .
The mean winter temperature of the air in the Red Sea may be a little under 70 ' Fahr. The following observations are not serial , but were taken at intervals in various parts of that sea ( see Table III .

Such is a summary of the results obtained between the years 1749 and 1868 .
From time to time they had been commented on by some of the most eminent physicists of the time , and the cause of the low temperatures prevailing in the depths of tropical seas discussed .
Humboldt , so far back as 1812 , and again in his subsequent works* , contended that " the existence of those cold layers in low latitudes proves the existence of an undercurrent flowing from the poles to the equator .
" In support of this hypothesis , he showed how it explained the fact , first noticed by Franklin and Williams'f , that the water on shoals in the Atlantic was many degrees lower than that surrounding them , from the circumstance that the deeper cold water , flowing and rising over them , displaced the warmer surface-waters J. These observations were afterwards confirmed by Hue Petit-Thouars , Vaillant , and others .
He was further of opinion that " in the narrower seas , as well as in the tropical seas which cover the cold waters from Arctic regions , all the mass of water is in a state of movement .
" Humboldt also contested the conclusions of those who considered that the ocean is salter under the equator than at a distance from it , and showed that while in lat. 0 ' to 14 ' the specific gravity was 1*0272 , it was 1*0282 in lat. 15 ' to 18 ' , and 1*0278 in lat. 30 ' to 40 ' .
Nor did he fail to note S that the equatorial zone is not the hottest water zone ; but that two hotter zones lie a few degrees N. and S. of it .
Humboldt subsequently || thus summarized the question as it then stood:\#151 ; " As fresh and salt water do not attain the maximum of their density at the same degree of temperature , and as the saltness of the sea lowers the thermometrical degree corresponding to this point , we can understand how the water drawn from great depths of the sea during the voyages of Kotzebue and Du Petit-Thouars could have been found to have only the temperature of 37 ' and 36'*5 .
This icy temperature of sea-water , which is likewise manifested at the depths of tropical seas , first led to a study of the lower polar currents , which move from both poles towards the equator .
Without these submarine currents the tropical seas at those depths could only have a temperature equal to the local maximum of cold possessed by the falling particles of water at the radiating and cooled surface of the tropical sea .
In the Mediterranean the cause of the absence of such a refrigeration of the lower strata is ingeniously explained by Arago , * * * S * ' Voyage ' : Eelation Historique ( Paris 1814 ) , vol. i. p. 73 .

X He instances , for example , a case noticed by himself on the " Signal Bank " off Ferroll , where he found the water to have a temperature of from 540,5 to 56 ' F. , while the water immediately around was from 59 ' to 59'-6 F. S Ann. Chim .

on the assumption that the entrance of the deeper polar currents into the Straits of Gibraltar , where the water at the surface flows in from the Atlantic Ocean from west to east , is hindered by the submarine counter-currents , which move from east to west , from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic ... ... ... ... ... ... .The zones at which occur the maxima of the oceanic temperature and of the density ( the saline contents ) of its waters do not correspond with the equator .
The two maxima are separated from one another , and the waters of the highest temperature appear to form two nearly parallel lines north and south of the geographical equator .
Lenz , in his voyage of circumnavigation , found in the Pacific the maxima of density in 22 ' north and 17 ' south latitude , whilst its minimum was situated a few degrees to the south of the equator .
In the region of calms the solar heat can exercise but little influence on evaporation , because the stratum of air impregnated with saline aqueous vapour , which rests on the surface of the sea , remains still and unchanged .
" Similar views were adopted by D'Aubuisson in 1819* .
The whole subject of Oceanic circulation was again discussed from a fresh point of view by D'Urville f in his account of the results of his voyage of 1826 .
After arguing ( p. 62 ) that in open seas the temperature at and below 600 brasses ( 3198 feet ) is nearly constant between 4 ' C. and 5 ' C. , and that perhaps it may be 4'*4 C. ( 40 ' F. ) , he significantly remarks that in the zone 10 ' on each side of the equator some particular cause seems to occasion in the water " up to 100 brasses a more sudden and rapid cooling than would have been expected .
" He afterwards ( p. 64 ) proceeds to say that the mass of the equatorial waters , slowly diminished by evaporation , may give rise to a slow and continuous ascensional movement of the lower colder waters , and these so displaced make room for other waters coming from the polar regions , so that " it is rather a transport , nearly in mass and very slow , of the deep waters of high latitudes towards the equator .
" The point of departure he considered to be between 40 ' and 60 ' lat. ; and he inferred that the deep cold waters ( at 40 ' ) are there directed periodically in two " insensible currents , " the one towards the equator and the other towards the pole .
AragoJ in 1838 , reporting to the French Institute on a scientific expedition then in course of preparation to the coast of Africa , thus expresses his opinion:\#151 ; " La temperature des couches inferieures de l'ocean , entre les tropiques , est de 22 ' a 25 ' centigrades au-dessous du plus bas point auquel les navigateurs aient observe le thermometre a la surface .
Ainsi , cette couch si froide du fond n'est point alimentee par la precipitation des couches superficielles .

44 La consequence est importante .
Les experiences faites au milieu de la Mediterranee , la fortifient .
Cette mer interieure no pourrait recevoir les courants froids , prove-nant des regions polaires , que par la pass si resserree de Gibraltar ; eh bien !
dans la Mediterranee , la temperature des couches profondes n'est jamais aussi faible , toutes les autres circonstances restant pareilles , qu'en plein ocean ; on peut meme aj outer que nulle part cette temperature du fond de la Mer Mediterranee no parait devoir desCendre au dessous de la temperature moyenne du lieu .
Si cette derniere circonstance vient a se confirmer , il en resultera qu'aucune party du flux glacial venant des poles no franchit seuil du detroit de Gibraltar .
44 Lorsque M. le Capitaine D'Urville partit , il y a quelques annees , pour sa premiere campagne de 4 l'Astrolabe , ' j'eus la pensee qu'il pourrait etre utile de rechercher si les phenomenes de l'ocean , quant a la temperature des couches profondes , se presenteraient dans tout leur purete des qu'on se trouverait a du detroit .
L'Academie voulut bien accueillir mon voeu .
Sir sa recommandation express , quelques observations de la nature .de celles que je desirais , furent faites a peu de distance de .
Eh bien !
else donnerent precisement ce qu'on aurait trouve dans la Mediterranee .
" Ce fait curieux semble se preter a deux explications diflerentes .
On peut supposer que le courant polaire se trouve completement refoule par un courant sous-marin dirige de la Mediterranee verse l'ocean , et dont l'existence est appuyee sir divers evenements de mer. On peut supposer aussi que la saillie si forte de la cote meridionale du , no permet pas au flux d'eau froide venant du nord , de s'inflechir jusqu'a angle droit pour aller atteindre les regions voisines de l'embouchure du Guadalquivir .
" Again* , in reporting on the observations of the 4 Venus , ' Arago saw no other explanation of the low deep-sea temperatures recorded in tropical seas , but 44 the existence of submarine currents carrying to the equator the bottom-water of the icy seas .
" It is , however , to Lenz ( who had , in his previous papers of 1831 and others , concluded that the temperature of the ocean decreases with the depth , rapidly at first and then gradually , until a point of about 36 ' F. was reached , when it became insensible ) that we are indebted for a more special review and discussion of all the facts known up to 1845 f. Speaking of the earlier observations made on the temperature of the sea at great depths , he observes:\#151 ; 44 The greater number of these observations , with the exception of those made by myself , were taken with thermometrographs , and especially with Six 's thermometers .
It is , however , to be observed that all instruments of this kind are liable to a source of error which hitherto investigators have not borne in mind , viz. the compression of the vessel or the bulb which contains the thermometrical substance ( spirits of wine ) , particularly by the enormous pressure in depths of several thousand feet .
I was witness of a series of experiments on the action of strong pressure on a thermometer-bulb , which Parrot undertook in order to ascertain the influence of * Comptes Eendus , 1840 , vol. xi .

It is there mentioned that a pressure of 100 atmospheres caused the thermometer to rise about 20'*5 , without the temperature having altered in the least , as was shown by a second thermometer which was protected from pressure by a brass cylinder .
" Lenz proceeds to remark that it necessarily follows that thermometrographs ( although in such instruments the effect would be much less owing to their form of construction ) exposed in the sea to pressures of 100 to 200 atmospheres must give too high a reading , and that the circumstance of the indications in so many deep soundings remaining uniform , or sometimes increasing with the depth , proves the influence of compression .
Reviewing the data furnished by different observers and by himself , and assigning to them , if not an actual , at all events a relative and comparative value for corresponding depths , Lenz notices the circumstance that they all point to the existence of a belt of water at and near the equator cooler than at a short distance to the north and south of it ; and in illustration of this he takes the consecutive series of observations at nearly the same depths made by Kotzebue in 1815-1818 , at short distances apart over a great length of the Atlantic ; and he gives a Table , of which the following is an abstract:\#151 ; Zones of latitude .

4 P Lenz then proceeds to observe:\#151 ; " The form of the submarine isothermal line which I have drawn leads us of itself , on the first glance , to an explanation of this striking phenomenon .
" The mass of water in the tropics , warmer down to a certain depth from the sun 's heat , cannot maintain its equilibrium with the colder waters of the middle and higher latitudes : a flow of the warmer water from the equator to the poles must necessarily take place on the surface ; and this surface-flow must be supplied at the equator by a flow of colder water from high latitudes , which at first would flow in an almost horizontal direction , but which under the equator must rise from below to the surface .
In this manner , in the northern hemisphere , a great vertical circulation takes place in the ocean , which has its direction above from the equator to the pole , and below from the pole to the equator .
Since these flows or currents moving in opposite directions are distinguished by their different temperatures , we obtain in the submarine isotherm an indication of the direction of the lower portion of this flow .
A corresponding flow , but moving in the opposite direction , takes place in the southern hemisphere ; so that in a zone surrounding the equator where both are united , the water flows almost in the direction from below up to the surface ; and thus one meets with cold water in much shallower depths than in those two zones north and south which lie immediately adjoining , and which , in fact , is shown by the observations .
" It is not my intention to enter here upon the question , how the original direction of this current to the surface becomes greatly altered by the diminution of the speed of rotation and by the influence of the wind , so that the water first arrived at the polar regions by considerably circuitous ways , or how the lower portion of the current was drawn westward by the entrance of bodies of water into latitudes of greater speed of rotation ; in any case the last influence will be very much diminished by the opposition of the west bank of the ocean , in comparison with the corresponding diversion or drawing away which the air-currents undergo .
It is sufficient for me to have furnished in the figure of the submarine isothermal line proof of the current from the pole to the equator in the depth of the ocean .
It would be highly desirable that future navigators should enlarge our knowledge on this point , by a larger number of observations with one and the same instrument , or with corrected instruments , which could be accomplished with very little trouble and in a very short time .
If they would be satisfied with letting down the thermometrographs at always one and the same depth of some 100 fathoms , this observation would be made in fifteen minutes ; and in any case , by a frequent repetition of it , results would be arrived at , especially in latitudes ranging from 40 ' N. to 40 ' S. , which would be far more instructive for physical geography than the observations hitherto made , where one proceeded or reasoned more on the determination of the diminution of the temperature than upon compared determinations of different places .
" From a current underneath of colder waters from the poles to the equator , some important conclusions arise , viz.:\#151 ; MR. J. PRESTW1CH ON SUBMARINE TEMPERATURES .
" 1 .
The diminution ( pointed out ) of temperature everywhere up to latitude 60 ' with the increase of depth , in direct opposition to the conditions observed on dry land .
" 2 .
My numerous determinations of the salinity of the ocean have shown that the maximum of the salinity does not occur at the equator , but invariably some degrees north and south from it ( in the Atlantic at 23 ' N. and 17 ' S. ) .
I have endeavoured to explain this condition from the greater evaporation in these latitudes , which is comprehensible from the cooperation of the trade-wind , in opposition to the region of calms at the equator ( see Mem. de l'Acad .
Sc. Math. Ph. et Not .
t. i. p. 507 ) .
According to the above , I do not , however , doubt that also the slight salinity of the uprising polar water in the region of calms contributes materially to this condition .
" 3 .
It is a point which has been determined by Humboldt , John Davy , and others , that the water of the ocean is colder at the surface over shallows than at some distance from them over very great depths .
This phenomenon , the explanation of which hitherto has not been found to be satisfactory ( Gehler 's New Lexicon , t. vi .
3 .
p. 1687 ) , is a simple consequence of the current of colder water at depths from the pole to the equator ; for if this runs against any obstruction , such as a shallow would present , it will rise along it as upon an inclined plane , and approach nearer the surface , and in this manner the surface will be cooled down .
" A little later Pouillet* , who does not , however , seem to have been aware of Lenz 's researches , remarks " It seems certain that there is in general a surface-current carrying towards the polar seas the warm water of the tropics , and a lower current bringing back from the poles the cold water of the polar regions ; but these currents are modified in their direction and intensity by a number of causes which depend on the depth of the sea-basins , their configuration , and the influence of winds and tides .
" I have already referred to Biot 's criticism of Ross 's work .
Reasoning afterwards on the different temperatures shown to exist throughout all seas , and on the impossibility , in consequence , of any portion of it being in a state of rest , he observes f:\#151 ; " The existence and the initial direction of these constant currents presupposes three things : first , a permanent cause of movement which forces the polar waters towards the equator ; secondly , a constant exterior afflux supplying the great polar streams at the origin and along their course ; and lastly , some exhausting cause or outflow , preventing the final accumulation of their products " ( p. 79 ) .
Biot , however , in consequence , apparently , of the doubts he felt respecting the accuracy of temperature observations at depths , owing to the anomalous results of Ross 's , hesitates to admit " the inference that the bottom of the sea was occupied by a layer of cold water proceeding from the poles and which is unceasingly renewed " ( p. 71 ) , and attaches more weight as a cause of this circulation to the inequality of mean pressure of the atmosphere in different latitudes .

Phys. Math. v. 1847 ) ; viz. that at the equator , or rather in the region of calms , one finds a notably more rapid diminution of temperature at increased depth than even in the tropic or subtropical zone .
We also see here that at 4 ' N. lat. the temperature at 60 fathoms decreases from 21 ' R. to 12 ' R. , but at 28 ' ( 321 ) lat. only to 14'*8 ; and it is first at 36 ' lat. in this depth that one finds nearly the same temperature as at the equator , viz. 12'*6 Reaumur .
In the Southern Atlantic Ocean , the conditions of temperature at depths appear to approximate more nearly to the equator than in the Northern , possibly in consequence of the northern inclination of the region of calms .
" S Y. General Conclusions .
It is evident that the old observations ( all before 1868 ) have very different degrees of value .
In laying down the lines of Section of the Bathymetrical Isotherms on the Admiralty " Track Chart " of the world , I have selected those observations which appear the most reliable , and which at the same time offer the most continuous series over the greatest number of parallels of latitude , such as the observations of Kotzebue in the North and South Atlantic , and those of Dayman $ in the South Atlantic and * " Meteorologische Beobachtungen auf dem Atlantischen und Grossen Oceane in den Jahren 1847-49 angestent von dem Dr. Ed.

Indian Oceans , subject to , as the correction for pressure , the deduction of 1 ' Fahr. for every 1700 feet of depth .
As the 'Challenger ' expedition will supply ample data regarding the deeper temperature-soundings in the intertropical seas , the scarcity of them in the earlier voyages is of less importance .
Those , on the contrary , collected on the many Arctic and Antarctic voyages under circumstances of so much difficulty , and which bear in so essential a manner upon the intermediate areas , are fortunately much more complete .
The lines of Section have therefore been so selected as to embrace the chief observations of the several explorers in both the Arctic and the Antarctic seas .
For this purpose tw'o lines traverse respectively the length of the Atlantic and of the Pacific , and two others are run through the Indian and Southern Oceans .
Section No. 1 first traverses the North Atlantic from the top of Baffin Bay to the equator in long .
20 ' W. , and shows the low submarine temperatures prevailing in the higher latitudes on that side of the Atlantic .
The bathymetrical isotherm of 35 ' F. seems on this line not to extend beyond lat. 63 ' N. Soundings have been made in Davis Strait and Baffin Bay between lat. 60 ' and 77 ' N. to the depth of 6000 feet , and everywhere the temperature decreases with the depth down to 29 ' and 28 ' , or even 27 ' , and in one instance so low a degree as 250,75 F. has been recorded .
The isotherms of 40 ' , 50 ' , and 60 ' F. in the western area of the Atlantic have likewise a less northward extension than in the eastern area traversed by Section No. 2 ; while that of 70 ' F. , which is affected by the Gulf-stream , extends further north .
Section No. 2 , which commences in the seas around Spitzbergen , exhibits , to depths within the annual influence , a temperature as low , if not lower , than in No. 1 , while below that the temperature , on the contrary , down to the depths hitherto tried ( not quite 5000 feet ) increases with the depth .
Owing to the great diurnal variations of temperature at the surface or to currents , the fluctuations in the upper strata are frequent and rapid .
From 1000 down to 3000 feet the temperature is more uniform at 33 ' to 34 ' , and reaches , at 4500 to 4600 feet* , 34 ' to 35'F .
or possibly 36 ' .
Off the coast of Greenland the one experiment of Scoresby shows a decrease of temperature to the full depth tried , viz. to 280,5 ( corr .
) at 708 feet .
From the Spitzbergen seas , the bathymetrical isotherm of 35 ' F. gradually falls until the latitude of about 50 ' N. is reached , when its depth is twice what it is in lat. 76 ' to 80 ' .
About lat. 40 ' N. it appears to have attained its maximum depth of about 11,000 feet , at which it remains to lat. 30 ' , from about which point it again rises gradually , lying in lat. 12 ' at a depth of about 8000 feet , and reaching probably still nearer the surface at the equator j* .
The isotherm of 40 ' F. , which , in this north-eastern part of the Atlantic , extends as far as lat. 72 ' to 73 ' north , reaches its maximum depth of about 6000 to 7000 feet between lat. 50 ' to 30 ' N. , and rises to between 3000 * Scoresby 's deepest sounding was in 76 ' 30 ' N. , 4 ' 48 ' W. , 7200 feet , no bottom .
t The depths of these isotherms in the Atlantic will no doubt require correction ; hut this will not affect their relative position and general bearing .
and 4000 feet near the equator .
Of these two and other lower isotherms in temperate and tropical seas the older observations afford , however , very few data , and we need say little .
We wait for those of the * Challenger .
' Of the bathymetrical isotherms of 50 ' , 60 ' , 70 ' , and 80 ' F. , the data are more ample .
They seem respectively to set in about lat. 60 ' , 50 ' , 25 ' , and 12 ' N. , and the first two to attain their greatest depths between lat. 40 ' and 20'\#151 ; the isotherm of 50 ' F. falling to 3000 feet , and that of 60 ' F. to 1200 feet .
They then rise , and from lat. 12 ' N. to the equator , the isotherm of 50 ' F. comes within 1000 to 1200 feet of the surface , and that of 60 ' F. from 300 to 400 feet .
In the South Atlantic , on the line of section No. 1 , which now crosses over to the eastern area of the South Atlantic , the bathymetrical isotherms seem to be prolonged southward more nearly on the same level that they have near the equator\#151 ; the isotherm of 50 ' lying at from 1000 to 1400 feet , between lat. 7 ' and 40 ' S. , and that of 60 ' F. at 500 or 600 feet .
In the western area ( sect. No. 2 ) the isotherms of 50 ' , 60 ' , and 70 ' F. are much more irregular , sinking in lat. 10 ' to 20 ' to about 3000 , 1800 , and 500 feet , and then rising and ending , as in the other line of section , in about lat. 40 ' and 45 ' S. But while , on the whole , the higher isotherms range rather further south in the western than in the eastern area , the isotherm of 35 ' F. is in both prolonged further south , on a nearly uniform level of from 7000 to 8000 feet , between lat , 20 ' and 65 ' .
The Pacific Sections ( Nos. 3 \amp ; 4 ) exhibit a much lesser number of observations , but still sufficient to draw some general conclusions .
Starting in one .
case in the Arctic Sea north of Behring Strait , and in the other in the sea south of Behring Strait , one line of section ( No. 3 ) passes through the Eastern Pacific to the equator in long .
120 ' W. , and the other ( No. 4 ) through the Western Pacific to the equator in long .
180 ' W. North of Behring Strait the sea is so shallow that the observations barely pass beyond the limits of diurnal variations .
The width and depth ( 180 feet ) of that strait itself are also so small that the intercommunication through it between the polar seas and the North Pacific can have little or no effect on the thermal condition of the latter ; nevertheless it may be a question whether the submarine isotherm of 60 ' F. in that ocean extends beyond the lat. of 40 ' to 45 ' N. , and the isotherm of 50 ' F. beyond about lat. 55 ' N. , being about 5 ' less in either case of their northern range in the eastern area of the North Atlantic ; while the isotherm of 35 ' F. disappears , as in the western division of the Atlantic , between lat. 60 ' to 70 ' N. , instead of having the more indefinite northward range it has in the open North Atlantic .
These isotherms also , instead of the remarkable rise which they present near the equator in the North Atlantic , exhibit in the North Pacific a gradual decline to the equator , where , judging from the few data we have at our disposal , they seem to lie\#151 ; that of 60 ' F. at 800 to 1000 feet , of 50 ' F. at 2000 to 2500 feet , of 40 ' F. at 4000 to 5000 feet , of 35 ' F. at 7000 to 8000 feet respectively , and pass the equatorial zone without rise or apparent change of level .
On the other hand , in the South Pacific the conditions are much more like those of MB .

the South Atlantic .
In the Eastern division ( section No. 3 ) the isotherms of 60 ' F. and 50 ' F. are on a nearly uniform level from the equator to about 35 ' to 45 ' S. lat. , and extending apparently not quite so far southward as in the Atlantic .
In the Western division of the Pacific ( section No. 4 ) the several isotherms seem to lie rather deeper , and the isotherms of 60 ' and 50 ' F. to extend some degrees further south .
But we again have , as in the South Atlantic , the same expansion of the isotherms of 40 ' and 35 ' F. as they range southward , the latter having in lat. 65 ' S. a depth of 6000 to 7000 feet ; from this point it rises rapidly , or is displaced by colder waters , as it approaches the Antarctic continent .
Section No. 5 , which crosses the Indian and Southern Oceans from 20 ' N. to 40 ' S. , exhibits conditions analogous to those which obtain in the Pacific , though the isotherms of 40 ' and 35 ' appear to lie deeper , viz. at depths of about 9000 to 12,000 feet at the equator .
They are then prolonged nearly on the same level to about 12 ' north , and thence to rise as they approach the head of the Arabian Gulf , where they are lost in the heated surface-waters .
In the other direction the three higher isotherms on this line of section maintain a more nearly uniform relative depth of about 200 , 500 , and 1500 feet , -\#151 ; that of 80 ' F. terminating in about lat. 20 ' S. , that of 70 ' F. in lat. 30 ' S. , and that of 60 ' F. in lat. 39 ' S. At this point the isotherm of 50 ' F. lies at a depth of about 1500 feet , that of 40 ' F. at 4000 to 5000 feet , and that of 35 ' F. may be at about 7000 to 8000 feet .
In this section we have no data south of 40 ' S. lat. Section No. 6 traverses the Southern Ocean more to the eastward .
We there still find the higher isotherms terminating in nearly the same parallels of latitude ; but we can follow the lines of 40 ' F. and 35 ' F. further south\#151 ; the former at a depth of about 4000 feet in lat. 53 ' S. and becoming lost in about lat. 65 ' S. , and the latter rising and disappearing in about lat. 70 ' S. South of this is a zone in which the temperature of the sea to the depths ( 1800 feet ) yet tried is 30 ' and 33 ' F. ( corr .
) .
In the preceding observations the position of the bathymetrical isotherms can only be taken as an approximation to the truth , though they are , there is reason to hope , relatively correct .
The deeper isotherms have possibly too high a degree , and the upper ones , it must be borne in mind , are , in different meridians , subject to the action of many causes that may produce aberration , such as displacement by the action of surface-currents , which will vary according to their depth ; while another manifest cause , affecting more especially the lower isotherms , arises from the inequalities of the sea-bed , whereby the lower cold strata are deflected and driven nearer to the surface\#151 ; an effect not only due to submarine banks and some islands , but caused also by continental shores , as on parts of the southern coasts of Africa and of South America* .
Independently , however , of these local variations , certain general conditions have been clearly established by the researches we have had occasion to review , \#151 ; such as the presence of a stratum of water at and below 35 ' extending from the Arctic and * When this takes place the temperature of the sea at or near the surface will be found to become lower on approaching the shore , against which the colder undercurrent rises .
Their existence may thus be proved .
Antarctic seas to the equator , and which no doubt has justly been attributed to deep undercurrents carrying the waters of the poles to tropical regions , and the probable rise of these polar waters to the surface in the equatorial zone of the Atlantic .
The source of those glacial waters in the North Atlantic lies , probably , in the Arctic Ocean ; and the question arises as to the channels by which they travel southward .
The comparatively high temperature of 34 ' to 36 ' at depths in the seas around Spitzbergen shows that , although a deep body of cold water may move down the east coast of Greenland , the channels of the comparatively shallow sea between Norway and Spitzbergen are entirely , and of the deeper sea between Spitzbergen and Greenland in great part , occupied by a body of warmer water from the south ( for without renewal the degree of heat could not be maintained ) .
On the other hand , the constant low temperature at depths in Baffin Bay , and the southward drifting of the large low-sunk icebergs , show that that sea and Davis Strait afford a passage to a deep glacial current derived from the Arctic seas of North America .
Issuing from these comparatively narrow channels this body of cold water unites with that passing down the east coast of Greenland , and flows southwards , over the great depths of the Atlantic , apparently to the equator .
In the South Atlantic , on the contrary , the channel of the deep-seated glacial water is coextensive with the wide expanse open to the Antarctic seas , so that an unbroken undercurrent of such waters may occupy the one broad bed of that ocean .
These two great undercurrents of the Atlantic , flowing respectively from the north and the south poles towards the equator , must eventually meet ; and , judging from the rise of the bathymetrical isotherms and the low temperature of the sea immediately beneath the heated surface-waters in the equatorial regions , it is probable , as suggested by Lenz , that the meeting is there , and that it is that which in part determines , in conjunction with the excessive evaporation , the surging-up of the polar waters , though other causes presently to be referred to may assist .
In whatever way effected , the waters which thus rise to the surface in the equatorial zone necessarily tend to disperse and escape into other areas , whether by a slow movement in mass , or by more rapid currents in shallower and more definite channels , or by both causes combined .
The course of these deep Arctic and Antarctic undercurrents or streams in the Atlantic may be influenced by another cause ; viz. by the west to east trend of the South-American continent from the Caribbean Sea to Cape St. Roque , and by that from east to west of the African continent along the coast of Guijiea\#151 ; projections which both contract the width of the Atlantic , and present barriers which may help to deflect sideways and upwards , on the one ( American ) side the southward flow of the Arctic waters , and .
on the other ( African ) side the northward flow of the Antarctic waters , in a manner analogous to that which takes place on shoals and islands .
It is not my intention to enter upon the discussion of the course and magnitude o the Gulf-stream ; but I would suggest whether or not the initial start of that great current , together with the others which originate or acquire new power at the equator , such as the Guinea , the South Equatorial , and the Brazilian currents , may not be cradled MR. J. PRESTWICII ON SUBMARINE TEMPERATURES .
G35 by this surging-up of Arctic and Antarctic waters at or near the equator ; while other portions of those great bodies of water are deflected back and imperceptibly return the one to the north polar and the other to the south polar seas\#151 ; in masses unaffected by the more active shallow drifts and currents sweeping over their surface , and whose course is influenced by trade-winds and the earth 's rotation ; for while the cold waters are found so comparatively near the surface in the equatorial regions , the presence , at depths , in both the polar seas , of bodies of water having a temperature far above not only that of the winter but the annual temperature of those latitudes , is equally well proved .
Thus although the mean annual temperature of Spitzbergen does not exceed 18 ' F. ( and Dove estimates* the normal mean temperature of latitudes 803 to 90 ' at 4''5 F. ) , we find that in the seas surrounding that island there is a submarine temperature of 34 ' to 35 ' , if not rather higher .
In the same way in the Antarctic regions and in latitude 60 ' to 70 ' we there also find a submarine temperature nearly as highf .
Thus there is a rise of from 6 ' to 8 ' Fahk .
in descending from the surface to depths of 3000 feet to 4000 feet in the open polar seas , whereas in like depths in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic there is a fall of not less than 40 ' F. , extending at greater depths to about 50 ' F. There is every reason to believe that the open seas of the north polar regions are due , as suggested by Maury and others , to the influence of warm southern waters , though this is not , as supposed by those authors , owing to the action of the Gulf-stream J , but to the surging-up of these deeper warm strata ; and in the same way the open sea found by Cook , Weddell , Foss , and others , after passing the first barrier of ice in the south polar seas , may be due to a similar cause .
The great body of water at 32 ' to 35 ' or 36 ' F. extending to the depth of 4000 to 5000 feet or more , and passing by Spitzbergen , must ultimately be displaced and deflected by the colder and denser waters between 32 ' and 25''4 of the polar regions , and rise to the surface ; and as the influx is constant , an equilibrium can only be maintained by an efflux as great to other areas .
By Behring Strait , owing to its narrowness and shallowness , comparatively none passes ; but the surface-currents through Smith Sound , and the more intricate channels amongst the islands of the North-American coast and so down Baffin Bay , and that down the east coast of Greenland , originate doubtlessly with these effluent waters .
The temperature-soundings to depths of 1000 feet in Baffin Bay are in accordance with this view ; for after passing the stratum affected by the diurnal variations , the water to about that depth , although there is no surface-current from the south , has generally a temperature of from 30 ' to 34 ' , while that at greater depths sinks at places to a point very closely The mean summer temperature of Spitzbergen , according to Dove , is 340,5 E. t If , as we have reason to think , the observations of Sir James Ross should require a larger correction than others , then the isotherms in the Antarctic and Southern Oceans will have to be raised , and the isotherm of 35 ' will be replaced by one of 33 ' or 32 ' F. 5 At the same time there cannot , I think , be any doubt of the influence of the Gulf-stream , as a shallow current , on the seas and northern shores of the British Islands and Norway .
approaching to the freezing-point or to that of the maximum density of ordinary sea-water .
Moving in the same direction as the great body of colder water which it overlies , the warmer surface-water has a greater velocity than it , and moves over it as a surface-current\#151 ; the causes which effect its impulsion being of a more energetic character than those which originate during the colder months of the year with the descent of the dense waters and their slow outward propulsion in a deep undercurrent .
In the Pacific Ocean the great breadth of open sea , and the almost entire exclusion of the waters of the north polar seas , have produced conditions very different from those which obtain in the Atlantic .
The temperature-soundings are too few to lead to any certain conclusion ; but , so far as they go , they seem to show that there is no uprising of cold undercurrents at the equator .
The observations referred to by Lenz are so scattered and at such small depths , that they may have been affected by the action of the great cold current which passes northward up the west coast of South America , and is deflected westward at the equator , and by various other surface-currents .
In any case , the remarkable rise of the bathymetrical isotherms in the North Pacific , which cannot be accounted for by any current passing through Behring Strait , leads me to infer that the Antarctic waters pass under the whole length of the Pacific , and are thrown up by the barrier presented at its northern extremity by the American and Asiatic coasts .
Some of the great currents of the North Pacific may owe their origin to , while others seem to be strengthened by , these distantly derived waters .
Nor is it easy to account in any other way for the rise of the isotherms of 35 ' and 40 ' F. at the head of the Arabian Sea after traversing the deep bed of the Indian Ocean .
The high temperature of the surface-waters , however , prevents the effects being so apparent in the upper strata of that sea .
Again , the causes which influence the great currents of the North-Indian Ocean appear to correspond with the area of surging-up , as they approach the Asiatic continent , of the south-polar undercurrents .
The cause of these phenomena in both hemispheres is , in all probability , connected with the intense cold of the polar regions , \#151 ; the mean annual difference of from 70 ' to 80 ' F. between the polar and the intertropical regions forming a permanent disturbing cause , owing to the alteration of density to which the affluent , waters are unceasingly subjected* .
It is a cause , also , which , from the variation in the density of the surface-water in winter and summer , must materially influence the operation of the currents generally , both at the Arctic and Antarctic regions , during the different seasons of the year , increasing the outflow from the polar seas in the cold months , and the influx in the warmer , whence the outflowing current through Behring Strait in the winter or spring , and the inflowing current in the summer .
For the same reason we should expect to find the general circulation more active in the one season than in the other .
But the discussion of these interesting questions is not our object .
In no way are the effects of the remarkable interchange between- the polar and equatorial waters in the great oceans more conspicuous than in the comparison of the * According to Dove the mean temperature of the equator is 79'*8 and of the pole 2'*2 .
ME .

thermal conditions of those oceans with those of inland seas\#151 ; the one so dependent on local climatal influences , and the other subject to influences so distant ; for whereas it is the winter cold of the latitude which regulates the one , it is the cold of the polar winters which affects the other .
Thus the temperature of from 54 ' to 55 ' F. at depths in the Mediterranean below the influence of the annual variations is that of the sub-winter months of that area , as that of 70 ' is for the Red Sea .
But the most striking case is the sea of Okhotsk , where , in the parallel of Great Britain , but with a winter-cold under 20 ' , or possibly under 15 ' F. , we have a nearly enclosed sea , of which the submarine temperature at 200 to 700 feet in the month of August is under 29 ' F. , or nearly 2 ' below zero of Centigrade , the surface-temperature being 47 ' F. These questions have necessarily a very important bearing on many geological problems , especially those connected with climates and the distribution of species .
For example , it is probable that the increased severity of the climate noticed within the historical period on the east coast of Greenland may arise from that elevation of the land which is shown , by the presence of raised beaches and marine remains at heights of from 50 to 300 feet or more on the north-western coast of Greenland* and amongst the islands of the Northern-American archipelago beyond Baffin Bay , to have taken place at a comparatively recent period ; for this , by lessening the width and depth of the many small straits opening into Baffin Bay , has thrown a larger volume of the polar waters into the other channels , as that between Greenland and Spitzbergen , and has thus had the effect of increasing and strengthening the ice-bearing current from the north which passes down the east coast of Greenland .
The amelioration of climate towards the close of the Quaternary period may also have been locally greatly influenced by the elevation of the land and shallowing of the seas around Britain and Norway , by which any flow over this area of the deep polar currents has been diverted .
The cognate questions also connected with the southward range of an Arctic fauna or the northward range of a tropical fauna , and , to compare the water with the land , the insular-like character of the fauna of inland seas ( all so liable to changes with any alteration in the direction and volume of those deep and obscure f undercurrents to which we have been referring , or by their ingress into seas before closed ) , are of the highest importance in the consideration whether of the later or of the older geolo .
gical phenomena of the globe .
They are , however , beyond the immediate range of this paper , which I submit as a starting-point for further research .
To conclude , the observations recorded in these pages , after subjecting the readings to the necessary corrections , show:\#151 ; 1-\#151 ; That a stratum of water at and under 35 ' F. extends beneath the Atlantic from the Arctic to the Antarctic seasj ; and , as it traverses all the parallels of latitude * There is the same evidence of recent elevation on the coasts of Behring Strait .
f Using the word in contradistinction to " conspicuous " surface-currents , such as the Gulf-stream , the effects of which arc well known , and have so often been reasoned upon in connexion with geological phenomena .
4 This has now been more fully established by the recent expeditions of the Porcupine ' and ' Challenger .
irrespective of the surface i^othermals , it must have an origin dependent not on local influences , but on others at a distance\#151 ; such , in fact , as accord only with polar influences .
b. That in the North Atlantic the two channels through which the deep-seated cold polar waters pass southward are Baffin Bay and the sea near the east coast of Greenland ; while the shallower seas immediately west of Spitzbergen , and between that island and Norway , are occupied to their entire depth by warmer waters flowing northward , from equatorial regions , towards the pole .
2 .
That in the North Atlantic the isotherm of 35 ' extends further in the polar seas than in the South Atlantic ; but in both its rise is masked by the extreme climatal variations and by surface-currents .
3 .
\#151 ; a. That in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic the deep-seated north and south polar waters , either owing to their meeting , or from impinging against projecting continental coasts , or from irregularities in the sea-bed , or from the several causes combined , are deflected and surge up at the surface , as shown by the rise of the bathymetrical isotherms .
b. That the main portions of the upper strata of these surging waters flow slowly en mass from this equatorial zone towards the poles\#151 ; such bodies of water moving independently of the drifts and surface-currents by which they are traversed and channelled .
4 .
\#151 ; a. That in the Pacific there is a similar deep stratum of cold water at and under 35 ' , extending from the Antarctic Ocean to Behring Sea without rising , as in the Atlantic , at the equator .
b. That in the North Pacific the submarine temperature is as low as or lower than in the open North Atlantic in the same latitudes .
c. Consequently , as the body of cold water in the North Pacific cannot be of north polar origin ( comparatively none passing through Behring Strait ) , there is reason to believe that the south polar waters traverse the whole length of the Pacific , and rise against the coasts bounding that ocean on the north .
5 .
That in the same way the Southern and Indian Oceans are underlaid by the cold waters proceeding from the Antarctic seas , which surge upwards as they approach the Asiatic coast .
6 .
That there the surging-up of polar waters in the great oceans , and of tropical waters in Arctic and Antarctic seas , is intimately connected with some of the great surface-currents which originate , or acquire additional force , in equatorial and polar seas , although the ultimate course of these currents may be influenced and determined by the action of the prevailing winds and by the movement of rotation of the earth .
7 .
That the temperature at depths in inland seas is governed by local causes , and tends in each case to assimilate to ( or as near as the physical properties of water will allow ) that of the mean winter or sub-winter temperature of the place .

99 99 492 28-6 2Q 26 7 Note.\#151 ; The observations where it is said that Marcet 's water-bottle has been used are not reliable .
There is an ambiguity in the few remarks in Wullerstorf 's 'Voyage of the Novara ' " On the Temperature and Density of Sea-water at Depths , " which perhaps should exclude those observations also .
The irregularity of the readings would seem to indicate that the temperature is rather that at time of taking the specific gravity than that at time of emersion of the apparatus .
Some may be about right , others much wrong .

Explanation op Sections .
PLATES 66 , 67 , \amp ; 68 .
The position of the section ?
will be found on the Map , and the initials attached to the numbers have the same reference on both .
In the absence of observations in the direct line of section some of those at a short distance on either side are included .
The vertical lines indicate the position and depth of the temperature-soundings , and the figures in italics connected with them give the temperature at the surface and at depths in degrees of Fahrenheit .
The other figures on the top line mark the degrees of latitude .
The stronger figures in italics relate to the probable position of the bathymetrical isotherms generally .
The separate numbers at depths indicate the depth in feet to which soundings have been made in any latitude , the sign + showing that no bottom has been reached .
All the observations used in the Sections have been subjected to correction for pressure , as adopted p. 612 , viz. by making a deduction of 1 ' Fahr. for every 1700 feet of depth , exclusive of the observations of Lenz , Du Petit-Thouars ( such of them as are given in parentheses in the Tables ) , Martins , Pullen ( in part ) , and those of Boss , Parry , and Sabine of 1818-19 , which are taken , for reasons before given , as recorded by the original observers .
It is possible that in some instances ( as , for example , James Ross ) a larger correction might be necessary , and that in the Antarctic seas the isotherm of 35 ' F. should be replaced by one of 33 ' or 32'* ; but this will not much affect the correction for the more numerous observations at lesser depths .
All the depths are given , for the sake of uniformity , without correction for angle of rope , as that could only possibly be known in but few cases .
The importance , however , of a correction for this also will be evident by reference to the large allowances which Du Petit-Thouars f has often thought it necessary to make in his soundings , the corrected readings being given between parentheses .
Only in 21 cases does he record " the angle of the line from the vertical " as 0 ; in the other 38 cases he found it to vary from 10 ' to 67 ' ; and he estimated the difference caused by the latter extreme case as equal to a reduction of the observed depth of 5872 feet to a corrected depth of 2296 feet .
The want of information on this point is one reason for taking , as we have done , a minimum correction for pressure .
Where the observations are sufficiently numerous the bathymetrical isotherms are laid down in continuous lines .
The dotted lines indicate the probable prolongation of the isotherms , on the supposition that there are no disturbing causes ; but it must be borne in mind that the isotherms ( the lower ones especially ) are liable to rise with every * Should some of the observations of the * Challenger ' be found to correspond in position with any of those recorded in these pages , they will furnish a measure whereby to correct these or those of other observers .
t See also the corrected depths of Lenz ( anti , p. , 599 ) and of Wauchope , 1816 , and Sabine , 1822 ( Tables ) .
important irregularity ( banks , shoals , \amp ; c. ) in the bed of the ocean , and the upper isotherms may be variously deflected by surface-drifts and currents .
It is probable that in some of these Sections ( as , for example , in the North Pacific , Sect. 4 , and in the South Atlantic , Sects .
1 \amp ; 2 ) the irregularities of curvature may be exaggerated , owing to the want of uniformity in the instruments used by the different observers , and by the necessity of using a general correction for all .
Very little was known before 1868 of the deep bed of the Atlantic .
The few indications of the ocean-bed given in the sections are taken from notices in the several voyages above recorded and from Maury .
In the higher north latitudes we have the soundings of Ross , Kane , Scoresby , and Martins .
In section No. 2 the greater depths of Scoresby are in the sea west of Spitzbergen , and the lesser ones of Martins between Spitzbergen and Norway , which accounts for the break in continuity of depth .
The position of the bathymetrical isotherms and the indications of the sea-bed are confined strictly to observations anterior to 1868 .
