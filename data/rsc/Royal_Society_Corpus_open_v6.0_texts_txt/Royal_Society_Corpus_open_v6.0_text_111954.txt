( Abstract .
) One of the first efforts toward the formation of the calculus of functions is due to Laplace , whose solution of the functional equation of the first order , by means of two equations in finite differences , is well known .
Functional equations were afterwards treated systematically by Mr. Babbage ; his memoirs were published in the Transactions of this Society , and there is some account of them in Professor Boole 's Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences .
A very important functional equation was solved by Poisson in his memoirs on Electricity ; which suggested to me the investigations I have now the honour to lay before the Society .
I have commenced by discussing the linear functional equation of the first order with constant coefficients , where the subjects of the unknown functions are rational functions of the independent variable , and have shown how the solution of such equations may in a variety of cases be effected by series , or by definite integrals .
I have then considered functional equations with constant coefficients of the higher orders , and have proved that they may be solved by methods similar to those used for equations of the first order .
I have next proceeded with the solution of functional equations with variable coefficients .
In connexion with functional equations , I have considered equations involving definite integrals , and containing an unknown function under the integral sign ; the methods employed for their resolution depend chiefly upon the sollltion of functional equations , as effected in this paper .
The calculus of functions has now for a long time engaged the attention of analysts ; and I hope that the present investigations will be found to have extended its power and resources .
