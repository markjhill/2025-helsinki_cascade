" On the Changes of Temperature produced by the Rarefaction and Condensation of Air .
" By James Prescott Joule , Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. In order to estimate with greater accuracy than has hitherto been done the quantities of heat evolved or absorbed during the condensation or rarefaction of atmospheric air , the author contrived an apparatus where both the condensing pump and the receiver were immersed in a large quantity of water , the changes in the temperature of which were ascertained by a thermometer of extreme sensibility .
By comparing the amount of force expended in condensing air in the receiver with the quantity of heat evolved , after deducting that which was the effect of friction , it was found that a mechanical force , capable of raising 823 pounds to the height of one foot , must be applied in the condensation of air , in order to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree of Fahrenheit 's scale .
In another experiment , when air condensed in one vessel was allowed to pass into another vessel from which the air had been exhausted , both vessels being immersed in a large receiver full of water , no change of temperature took place , no mechanical power having been developed .
The author considers these results as strongly corroborating the dynamical theory of the nature of heat , in opposition to that which ascribes to it materiality ; but he reserves the further discussion of this question to a future communication , which he hopes soon to present to the Royal Society .
