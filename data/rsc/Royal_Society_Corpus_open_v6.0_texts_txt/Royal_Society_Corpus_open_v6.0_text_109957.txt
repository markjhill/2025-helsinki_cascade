A Sketch of an Analysis and Notation applicable to the Estimation of the Value of Life Contingencies .
By Benjamin Gompertz , Esq. F.R.S. Read June 29 , 1820 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1820 , p. 214 .
] Mr. Gompertz begins by establishing a system of notation intended to avoid unnecessary repetitions and circumlocution , and proceeds to .
apply his abbreviated expressions to a more accurate determination of the value of a number of joint lives , according to any given tables of mortality , than can be obtained by the common approximations .
He afterwards investigates the probabilities of the survivorship of two persons of different ages , who were known only to be living at one time and dead at another , which , within certain limits , are supposed to be equal : and he inquires into the conditions of mortality that would be requisite in order that this proposition should be accurately true .
He then applies his method to the problems which have been solved by Mr. Morgan in the Philosophical Transactions , and copied by Mr. Bailey in his work on Assurances , relating to some complicated contingencies and survivorships on different suppositions respecting the decrement of life , employing various integrations , summations , and approximations in this elaborate inquiry , but without obtaining any results which it is possible to specify in an abstract , as giving a general idea of the nature of his improvements , without entering into forms of expression directed almost as much to the eye as to the understanding .
