) ( Abstract .
) In this memoir are described the results of a complete investigation of the crystals of the potassium , rubidium , caesium , and ammonium salts of the iron group of double selenates of the monoclinic series has at length attended the author 's prolonged attempts to prepare ferrous selenate , .and especially potassium ferrous selenate , as described in the preceding communication .
The outstanding result is to confirm in every particular the conclusions drawn from the previous study of three other groups of double selenates ( those containing zinc , magnesium , and nickel , as the M-metals ) , and of the complete set of eight groups of the double sulphates of this grand series .
The general law of progression of the crystallographic properties , with the atomic weight and atomic number of the interchangeable dominating alkali metals which form the group , is obeyed absolutely rigidly by the iron group .
The change in the principal ( monoclinic axial ) angle , the mean of the changes in all the 38 different angles measured , and the maximum change of interfacial angle , are all directly proportional to the change in atomic weight or number , to a degree of precision which is remarkable .
The change in the dimensions of the structural unit cell of the space-lattice , as indicated by the molecular volumes and topic axial ratios , and the principal measure of the optical refractive power , the molecular refraction , are all properties which show progression with acceleration , with the increase of atomic weight or number .
Crystal Elements.\#151 ; The direct progression of the axial angle / 3 will be clearly seen from the following Table , which also shows the axial ratios and the fact that those of the rubidium salt are intermediate , corresponding to the intermediate position of rubidium between potassium and caesium as regards both atomic weight and atomic number .
For the atomic weight ( 84-9 ) and atomic number ( 37 ) of rubidium are the mean of the corresponding potassium and caesium constants , | ( 38'9 4- 13T9 ) = 85'4 , and It has been rendered possible by the success which 1(19 + 55 ) = 37 .

JIabit.\#151 ; The three characteristic habits for the potassium , rubidium , and caesium salts of any group of the whole series , especially marked in the progression in the relative sizes of the faces of c{001 } and ^{Oll } , are clearly displayed by the three alkali metallic salts of the iron group , while the ammonium salt shows every gradation of variety between the limits shown by the outer members of the series , the potassium and caesium salts .
Interfacial Angles.\#151 ; The interfacial angles of the rubidium salt are intermediate in magnitude between those of the potassium and caesium salts .
When all the changes in the 38 angles measured are summed and the mean taken , it is found that the average change of angle for the replacement of potassium by caesium is exactly twice as great as that for the replacement of potassium by rubidium , corresponding exactly to the double change of atomic weight and atomic number .
The maximum change of angle also follows the same rule .
The values for the replacement of potassium by ammonium are the same as those for the caesium interchange .
These values are set out in the Table which follows , and the relations of the atomic weights and numbers follow the Table .

When potassium is replaced by rubidium , there is an increase of volume of 9-9 units , and , when rubidium is replaced by caesium , of 12*9 units .
The progress is thus an accelerating one .
When potassium is replaced by the ammonium radicle NH4 , the increase in volume is exactly 10 units , only 1 per cent , different from the increase caused by introducing rubidium in place of potassium .
This subject of the isostructure and congruency of the ammonium and rubidium salts of any group was specially dealt with in the author 's memoir on " X-Ray Analysis and Topic Axes of the Alkali Sulphates , and their Bearing on the Theory of Valency Volumes " * ; the further instance now presented by the iron group of double selenates is so much more evidence in substantiation of the view there expressed that the theory is untenable .
For it was shown that , if it were founded on fact , in the case of .the simple rhombic sulphates , the volume of the space-lattice unit cell of the ammonium salt would be double that of the rubidium salt ( 24 valency volumes as against 12 ) , whereas the volumes were proved to be almost absolutely identical , as in the case of the double salts now described .
The Optical Ellipsoid.\#151 ; The ellipsoid representing the optical properties has its ft axis identical in direction with the crystal symmetry axis b , and it rotates on this axis when one alkali metal is replaced by another so that the a axis , one of the two rectangular axes a and 7 which lie in the symmetry plane , is inclined to the vertical crystal axis c at the following angles:\#151 ; * * Roy .

21 4 The position of the ellipsoid for the rubidium salt is thus intermediate between the positions for the potassium and caesium salts , and the rotation is an accelerating one with the atomic weight and number .
Optic Axial Angles.\#151 ; These have been measured for six wave-lengths of light .
The true angles within the crystal 2Va for the three metallic salts progress almost exactly in direct proportion to the change of atomic weight and number , and the value for the ammonium salt is somewhat higher than that for the rubidium salt .
These facts may be illustrated by the values for the potassium , rubidium , ammonium , and caesium salts for sodium light , which are , respectively , 64 ' 18 ' , 73 ' 32 " , 77 ' 44 " , and 82 ' 47 ' .
Refractive Indices and Double Refraction.\#151 ; The refractive indices have been determined for seven wave-ledgths , and show also a progression with atomic weight and number of the alkali metal .
The mean index for sodium light , 1/ 3 ( a-f-yS+7 ) , for the potassium , rubidium , ammonium , and caesium salts respectively is:\#151 ; 1*5207 , 1*5220 , 1*5292 , and 1*5357 .
The double refraction ( difference between ct and 7 indices ) for the four salts is :\#151 ; 0*0250 , 0*0195 , 0*0165 , and 0*0108 , the progression with atomic weight being here a very clear one , the diminution being at an accelerating rate .
It is also the cause of the difference of the refractive indices for the potassium and rubidium salts not being more than is shown , for the effect of the progression of the indices , which is well marked in the case of the a values , is counteracted and slightly reversed in the 7 values by the opposite kind of progression ( a diminution ) of the double refraction ; when the caesium salt is reached , however , the progress of all three of the indices , a , j3 , and 7 , has become clearly apparent in spite of the effect of the double refraction change .
The ammonium salt stands between the rubidium and caesium salts with respect to both properties .
Molecular Optical Constants.\#151 ; These have been calculated both for the Lorenz and for the Gladstone and Dale formulae .
The molecular refraction is the most important of all the optical constants , and the Gladstone values are given below .
The Lorenz values indicate precisely the same facta The true progression with atomic weight and atomic number is very clearly shown by these values for the molecular refraction , the rubidium salt standing intermediate between the potassium and caesium salts , and in a position somewhat eloser to the former salt , so that the progression is VOL. xciv.\#151 ; a. 2 F 366 Monoclinic Double Selenates of the Iron Group .

The ammonium salt possesses almost the same molecular refractive power as the rubidium salt , the value being only very slightly higher , a fact doubtless connected with the interesting volume result , that the ammonium and rubidium salts are almost precisely iso-structural .
Concluding Remarks .
The key to the interesting crystallographic progression , which has been so strikingly confirmed by the results for this iron group of double selenates , has recently been afforded by the brilliant discovery of Moseley , that the atomic sequence number is the expression of the complexity of the atom , and is itself a fundamental constant , a direct measure of the positive electric charge on the atomic nucleus and of the number of negative electrons clustered around it in electrical equilibrium to form the atom .
Atoms so vigorous and dominating as those of the alkali metallic family group of maximum electro-positive character , differing regularly by the number of electrons corresponding to two whole horizontal rows of elements in the Periodic Table , must naturally exhibit a pronounced and similarly regular progressive influence on the structure and physical constants of the crystals of a series of salts in which these elements are the interchangeable constituents .
The discovery of Moseley thus renders the results of the author 's work over many years , so long without logical explanation , now clearly intelligible and explicable , and indeed only what could be expected from the progressive effect on the crystals of the operation of Moseley 's law on the atoms composing them ,
