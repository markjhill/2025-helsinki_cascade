11 Note upon Sodium Antimonyl Tartrate .

Sodium antimonyl tartrate was described in 1842 by Dumas and Piria , * who gave it the constitution C8H8OioNaO , Sb203H20 , -}- but did not state liow they had prepared it .
Clarke and Evansj obtained a compound of the composition 3Na2C4H406 + 2Sb(0H)3 + 3H20 , in 1883 , by saturating tartaric acid with antimony trioxide and neutralising the solution with sodium carbonate .
The first compound does not seem to have been prepared again since 1842 .
Sodium antimonyl tartrate was prepared according to the methods usually given for preparing tartar emetic , by boiling a solution of acid sodium tartrate ( 13 grammes ) with a little more than the calculated quantity ( 10 grammes ) of antimony trioxide until the latter had almost completely passed into solution .
On filtering and concentrating the solution to a small volume no crystallisation occurred , but on adding a little alcohol the whole became solid .
This was then dissolved in about twice its volume of hot water , and alcohol was added until precipitation commenced , when , on cooling , the sodium antimonyl tartrate crystallised out .
This compound at the ordinary temperature dries very slowly and has a moist appearance , but when dried vacuo over sulphuric acid it becomes anhydrous and loses 2\ molecules of water of crystallisation , resembling sodium tartrarsenite in this respect .
The substance is very easily soluble in water and its solution reacts faintly acid to litmus .

The Influence of Increased Barometric Pressure on Man .
No. 4.\#151 ; The Relation of Age and Body Weight to Decompression Effects .
By Leonard Hill , F.R.S. , and M. Greenwood , Jun. , M.R.C.S. ( Received October 1 , \#151 ; Read December 5 , 1907 .
) Statistics of caissons and diving works tend to suggest that the percentage number of men affected injuriously by exposure to compressed air increases with age .
Pol and Watelle ( 1 ) record that men between 18 and 26 stood the work best , and that of the 25 men dismissed for illness from the works under their inspection , 19 were over 40 years old , 5 over 30 , and 1 over 28 years .
Catsaras(2 ) investigated 62 instances of paralysis among sponge divers , and we find that , of these , 33 were over 30 years old , 17 over 25 , 11 over 20 , and 1 over 19 .
These men dived about 140 feet , spent about 10 minutes below , and were decompressed in about one minute .
Evidently this variation might depend on\#151 ; ( i ) the actual age difference ; ( ii ) on an increase in mean body weight with age ; ( iii ) on a combination of ( i ) and ( ii ) ; ( iv ) it might be purely random .
We cannot absolutely exclude ( iv ) in the instance of caisson works unless we know the total number of men at each age employed , figures which do not seem to be available .
Snell ( 3 ) gives the following table ( Table I ) of his observations , made at the Blackwall Tunnel works .
Unfortunately , column 2 gives not the total number employed , but only those who submitted themselves to medical inspection , which was not , at first , compulsory .
