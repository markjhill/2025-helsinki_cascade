132 Mr. J. A. Phillips on the Composition and [ Jan. 30 tuning within the reach of ordinary musicians ; for this purpose the theory and practice are reduced to their simplest forms .
A notation is described , adapted to use with ordinary written music by which the notes to be performed are clearly distinguished .
The design of a key-board is described , by which any system of tuning , except the ordinary equal temperament , can be controlled , if only the fifths of the system be all equal .
The design is on a symmetrical principle , so that all passages and combinations of notes are performed with the same handling , in whatever key they occur .
The theory of the construction of scales is then developed , and a diagram is given , from which the characteristics of any required system can be ascertained by inspection .
An account is then given of the application of such systems to the new key-board , and particularly of an harmonium which has been constructed and contains at present the division of the octave into fifty-three equal intervals in a complete form .
Buies for tuning are given .
Finally , the application of the system of fifty-three to the violin is discussed .
t Throughout the work of former labourers in the same field is reviewed : the obligations of the writer are due to Helmholtz , the late General T. Perronet Thompson , F.R.S. , and others .

" On the Composition and Origin of the Waters of a Salt Spring in Huel Seton Mine , with a Chemical and Microscopical examination of certain Rocks in its vicinity/ '* IIy J. Arthur Phillips , Mem. Inst. C.E. Communicated hy Professor Ramsay , F.R.S. Received December 12 , 1872 .
( Abstract .
) Huel Seton Copper-Mine is situated about one mile north-east of the town of Camborne , Cornwall , and is distant from the sea , on the north coast , a little more than three miles .
The workings of Huel Seton are entirely in " killas , " or clay-slate , and the saline waters issue at the rate of 50 gallons per minute , and at a temperature of 92 ' F. , from the eastern fore breast of the 160-fathom level .
This has intersected a fault , or cross course , which may be traced in a noitherly direction to the sea .
The temperature of the level from the end of which the water issues , like that of the water itself , is 92 ' F. The following results , in grammes per litre and grains per gallon , were obtained by analysis .

[ Jan. 9 , A consideration of the various phenomena connected with the occurrence of this and other apparently similar springs which have at different times been discovered in the district , would seem to lead to the inference that they all have some more or less direct communication with the sea , and that they are either the result of infiltration of sea-water through faults , or are true and independent sources which , before being tapped below the sea-level , had found their way to the ocean through faults or channels .
The following would appear , in the present state of our knowledge , a not improbable explanation of the origin of the Huel Seton spring .
The cross course is believed to extend through both granite and clay-slate to the sea .
Prom the close contact of its surfaces , the presence of clay , and from other causes , this fault may be supposed not to be uniformly permeable by water , which can only follow a circuitous passage .
In this way it penetrates to depths where reactions take place , which , although not entirely in accordance with the results of daily experience in our laboratories , can , after the investigations of M. Daubree , M. de Senarmont , and others , be readily understood .
By the action of sea-wciter on silicates of calcium , silicates of sodium and chloride of calcium may be produced .
The sulphate of sodium of the seawater will be decomposed by this chloride of calcium , with the production of sulphate of calcium and chloride of sodium .
The decomposition of clayey matter by common salt may produce chloride of aluminium and silicates of sodium , while the magnesium of the chloride of magnesium may be replaced by calcium ; lastly , a portion of the potassium in the sea-water appears to have been replaced by the lithium of the granite .

obtained by addition of constituents , is doubtless in a great measure due to the^partial decomposition of aluminium and magnesium chlorides at the temperature ( 180 ' C. ) at which the drying of the residue was effected .
