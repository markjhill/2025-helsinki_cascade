Corrections applied to the Great Meridional Arc , extending from latitude 8§ 9 ' 38",39 , to latitude 18§ 3 ' 23",64 , to reduce it to the Parliamentary Standard .

I HAVE recently received from Captain KATER a printed paper from the Philosophical Transactions for 1821 , giving an account of his experiments in examining and comparing the different standard scales .
I have read with great attention and satisfaction the whole of his results , and am glad to find that the Commissioners for considering the subject of weights and measures , have adopted Mr. BIRD'S scale of 1760 , as by that means there is now a universal standard of comparison , which applies to the French metre , and to all the measures used on the Continent .
From Captain KATER'S results it appears , that my standard scale requires a multiplier of - , oooo18 to make it agree with the above.scale of Mr. BIRD ; and that RAMSDEN'S bar , used in the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain , requires the multiplier +,00007 .
That is to say , with respect to a measurement on the meridian , the degree depending on my brass scale must be multiplied by , oooo18 and the product subtracted from the measure given by the scale , to reduce it to what it would have been , had it been measured by what is now the parliamentary standardr ; and the degree depending on RAMSDEN'S bar , must be multiplied by , oooo7 , and the product added to the measure given by the bar , to reduce it to the standard measure .
Now the arc which I have measured depends on both these standards , as I had a new chain sent out by Mr. BERGE in 1802 , which was laid off from RAMSDEN'S bar at the temperature of 52 " ; and this chain has never been used as a measuring chain , but as a standard chain with which to compare the other , till after the base near Gooty was measured , when the irregularity in the wear of the measuring chain was first discovered ; for then the brass standard scale was had recourse to , and a correction applied , to the base ; and the triangles computed back to Yerracondah , one of the meridional stations about -half way between the base near Bangalore and that near Gooty : and this is the correction alluded to in page 487 in the second part of the Philosophical Transactions for 818.8 It thence follows , that the meridional distance from Yerracondah to Daumergidda depends on the brass standard scale ; and that the meridional distance from Yerracondah to Punnae , near Cape Comorin , depends on the standard chaizi .
I shall now proceed to givethe different sections of the , arc , correcting them by the above factors as I go along .
From Namthabad back to Yerracondah , by the Feet .
base , as measured in 18x .
429120,6 S. The same distance by the corrected base , is 429134,3 s. Hence , from Namthabad to Yerracondah , depending on the standard scale , is 429134,3 s. From Yerracondah to Dodagoontah , depending Qn .

on the standard chain , is 727334 , s. These three being corrected by their respective factors , we shall have the meridional distance from Namthabad to Yerracondah 429126,6 s. From Yerracondah to Dodagoontah 332685,6 s. From Dodagoontah to Putchapolliam 727385,5 s. From Namthabad to Putchapolliam 1489197,7 s. or Fathoms 248199,6 s. Now the celestial arc between Namthabad and Putchapolliam is 40 6'i 1 " ,28 4 ?

ing on the standard chain , is 171516,75 s. Which , corrected by its multiplier , is 171528,76 s. And the celestial arc , is 205o'0 o",54=20,83626 Hence '7'528,6 = 60477,09 , fathoms , the degree due to 9§ 34'44 " the middle point .
Then from Namthabad to Daumergidda , depending on the standard scale , is 178904,7 Which , corrected by its multiplier , is.78901,48 The celestial arc is 20571'23'= 20,95648 .
Hence 189=0.648= 60511,65 fathoms , the degree due to 16§ 4 ' 42 " the middle point .
From which we have the degrees as follows : G , , , Fathoms .

Then computing from Eq. 3 , page 498 , in the Philosophical Transactions for 18 8 , 2d .

From which the following Table has been computed ; and it appears from this table , that the first degree in latitude 9034 ' 44 " by the measurement is 0,67 fathoms in defect ; and that the degree in latitude 16 ?

The celestial arc has been determined by seven stars , but there are many now out of my reach , which I observed in the beginning .
It may be satisfactory to the mathematicians in Europe to know , that I am now advancing through Hindoostan ; and , from what I can learn from the different public authorities , I do not apprehend any difficulty .
They are all inviting in their letters , and all seem desirous that I should go through their respective districts .
If my present arc be continued direct , it will pass through Bopaul , and near Seronje , where I shall have again to observe the stars and measure a base ; and if Scindiah 's country be in a quiet state , my meridian will pass near Gualior , his capital ; and my sixth section will terminate near Agra , on the Jumna .
I have made up my mind to execute all this if I live , and continue to have that flow of health and spirits which have hitherto attended me .
The results of such an extensive measurement must be interesting to scientific men ; and I shall exert my endeavours in doing justice to the work , and in giving a faithful account of the operations .
