Further Experiments with a new Register-Pyrometer for Measuring the Expansion of Solids .
By J. FREDERICK DANIELL , Esq. F.R.S. Professor of Chemistry in King 's College , London .
Read June 16 , 1831 .
IN my former communication on a new Register-Pyrometer , which has been honoured with a place in the Philosophical Transactions for 1830 , I stated that I hoped , at some future period , to be able to lay before the Society the results of some experiments upon the dilatation of metals to their melting points ; and I now purpose to redeem this pledge .
My previous observations upon the subject of expansion , were directed chiefly to the object of establishing what degree of confidence might be reposed in the instrument as a measure of temperature ; and I was able , I trust , to exhibit such an accordance between the measures which it had afforded and those of the best experimenters , long previously obtained with various metals to the boiling point of water , as fully to establish its sufficient accuracy .
The comparison however which I most relied upon , was with the experiments of MM .
DULONG and PETIT , upon the expansion of platinum and iron to the high temperature of 5720 FAHR. ; and as this is a point of fundamental importance , I shall still further strengthen it by a comparison with the results obtained by the same distinguished philosophers with copper , the only other solid metal to which they extended their inquiries .
Previously to this , I trust it may not be thought tedious , if I briefly relate the results of some trials for obtaining registers of uniform composition , which might preclude the necessity of determining the rate of expansion in each individual instance .
Exp. 23 .
For this I had recourse to WEDGWOOD'S ware , of which I obtained some bars carefully constructed and highly baked for the purpose .
The expansion of these I found precisely equal to that of platinum ; so that when the register was immersed in boiling mercury , the index was found not to have moved .
When a bar of iron was substituted for that of platinum , the arc measured was 1§ 7 ' .
With black-lead the same expansion gave a measure of 2§ 49 ' , from which if we deduct the expansion of platinum in black-lead .
1 45 the remainder ... ... . .
14 is sufficiently near to confirm the result .

My next trial was with registers of black-lead of various and known mixtures of plumbago and Stourbridge clay .
Four fifths proportion of the former to one fifth of the latter produced a composition which was too tender for the purpose ; but a mixture in the proportion of three fourths to one fourth formed a ware of a fine , even texture ; whose expansion was very equal , and not exceeding the least of those which I had formerly tried .
Three different registers of this composition afforded me the following measures of the expansion of a platinum bar to the boiling point of mercury .
1§ 45 ' 1 42 1 38 To which I may add a fourth , which gave for the expansion of an iron bar to the same point an arc of 2§ 42 ' , which is equivalent to 10 40 ' for a platinuin bar .
For all common purposes , therefore , the mean expansion of 1§ 42 ' might have been adopted without any serious error in the final results .
In investigations , however , which require the utmost precision , I still think it advisable to fix the expansion of each register by experiment .
EXP. 25 .
A bar of copper was adjusted in one of the registers and exposed , in the manner formerly described , to boiling mercury ; the arc measured on the scale was 4 10 ' , equivalent to an expansion of.03633 .
Let us now compare this result with the determination of MM .
DULONG and PETIT , as we formerly did the expansions of platinum and iron .

When we take into consideration the great difference in the total expansion of these three metals , as well as the differences in their several rates of increase 445 with the increasing temperature , such an accordance appears to me to be perfectly decisive of the accuracy of the pyrometer .
It will be unnecessary for me to trouble the Society with the details of the experiments by which I determined the expansion of several other metals to the boiling point of mercury ; it will be sufficient to state the results in a tabular form .
I thought that it would add much to the interest of the determnination of the total expansion to the fusing points , to determine previously the expansion of each to the points of boiling water and boiling mercury ; that any alteration in the rates of expansion between these points might be detected .
I must , however , make a few observations upon the general method which I adopted to insure an accurate determination of the former .
ExP .

Judging from the action of the pyrometer at lower heats , I expected that the index would continue to be thrust forward by the progressive expansion of any bar of metal , till its cohesion gave way and it assumed the fluid form ; and consequently that a register would be obtained of its maximum dilatation : but the difficulty consisted in applying the heat so equally that one part should not melt before another .
The arrangement which I finally adopted to secure this purpose , and which was found to answer perfectly , was as follows .
In the laboratory of the Royal Institution there is an excellent wind-furnace , from which proceeds a lateral horizontal flue , along which a flame may be drawn with any required degree of force .
Into this flue open two muffle-holes , which give a complete view and command of the interior .
From the equality of the draught , regulated by a register , the whole of this chamber may be kept at a low red , or an intense white , heat , by a proper management of the fuel in the body of the furnace .
The registers of the pyrometer were prepared for the experiment by drilling three holes on their under sides , communicating with the cavities in which the bars were placed ; one at each extremity , and one in the centre .
This was done for the purpose of allowing a vent for the melted metal , and to afford some criterion of the equality of the heat , by the time at which the metal ran from the different apertures .
When the bar was properly adjusted in the register , it was carefully placed in the hot air-chamber , in a horizontal position , supported at each end by a small piece of brick , at a proper distance from the 446 body of the fuel , accordingly as a greater or less degree of heat was required .
The muffle-holes were then closed with their stoppers ; all but a narrow slit , through which the progress of the heating and the flow of the metal could be observed .
The equality of the heat could be very accurately ascertained by the uniform colour of the register as it became red ; and any irregularity could easily be corrected by advancing one or other end more towards the fuel .
In this manner I succeeded in obtaining very satisfactory results ; except in the case of gold ; and this metal requiring for its fusion rather more heat than I could at the time command in the air-chamber , I laid the register upon the fuel in the body of the furnace , and it thus became only partially melted , and half the bar remained in the solid state .
The amount of the expansion indicated is therefore evidently deficient , and must be discarded from the table .
A similar accident happened once with brass ; but this I have been able to rectify by subsequent trials .
I shall now arrange the results of my experiments in two tables : the first showing , in arcs of the scale , the expansion of pure metals from 620 F. to 2120 , 662Q F. , and their respective melting points ; and the second exhibiting the expansion of certain alloys to the same points .
The bars were in all cases of the same length of 6.5 inches , TABLE XIII .

Having ascertained for each the expansion due to certain definite increments of temperature , and the utmost expansion which they undergo to their fusing points , it is clear that , had their expansion been equal for equal increments , we might have determined the true temperature of their melting points from these data .
As it is , even , knowing something of the limits of error introduced into such a calculation by the increased rate of expansion at the upper part of the scale , and the direction in which it ought to affect the result , we may draw some important inferences with regard to the correctness of the determinations derived from other means .
The following Table exhibits the results of such a calculation , compared with the melting points previously determined .

Now by these results , the accuracy of the pyrometer may , again , be placed beyond doubt , in a manner which was perfectly unforeseen at the time of instituting the experiments .
In the first place we have two metals , tin and lead , whose melting points being within the temperature of boiling mercury , have been accurately determined by the common thermometer .
Upon calculating the same points from their several expansions to boiling water , measured by the pyrometer , upon the supposition that they maintain the same rate to their points of fusion , the temperature of the first comes out 290 , and of the second 58 ?
, higher : that is to say , the rate of expansion of these two metals increases with the increase of temperature , as has been found to be the case with platinum , iron and copper , by the experiments of MM .
DULONG and PETIT .
It is worthy of remark , that this increased rate in tin is equivalent to 29 ?
in about 200 ?
, and in lead to 580 in about 400 ?
, above the boiling point of water .
These results therefore indicate a very close agreement between the thermometer and pyrometer .
2ndly .
The melting point of the next metal , zinc , is one of those which has been determined by immersion of the pyrometer into it , when it was in the act of fusion .
Its temperature , so determined , falls short of the same point , calculated from the expansion supposed equal , by 75 ? .
This again indicates an expansion increasing at nearly the same rate ( 75 ?
in 560 ?
) , as in the preceding instances of tin and lead .
I pass over at present the result obtained by calculating from the expansion to the boiling point of mercury , as it presents an anomaly upon which I shall presently make some observations .
3rdly .
The melting point of silver , determined in the same way by immersion , differs from that calculated from expansion in the same direction ; and the difference ( 286 ?
in 1660 ?
) is nearly in the same proportion .
The calculation from the rate of expansion to the boiling point of mercury comes much nearer to the melting point directly determined , and only differs from it 176 ?
: proving that the rate of expansion increases with the increasing temperature .
4thly .
A similar comparison instituted with copper presents us with a rate of expansion increasing much more rapidly than in the preceding instances ; so that the melting point , calculated from the expansion to boiling water , differs from the true melting point no less than 1266 ? .
Taking the rate of expansion to boiling imercury , the difference is reduced to 370 ? .
And here again I may 3M2 449 refer to the experiments of MM .
DULONG and PETIT in confirmation of the result ; for they found that the temperature indicated by the expansion of a rod of copper was 50 ?
FAHR , higher than the true temperature at 572 ?
FAHR. 5thly .
The interesting nature of the results which I obtained with iron , and the peculiar difficulties in arranging the experiments from which they were derived , will , I trust , excuse my entering more into their details than I have thought necessary in the preceding instances .
I have already given the expansion of wrought iron to the temperatures of boiling water and boiling mercury , and shown that the measures obtained with the pyrometer agree essentially with those determined by very different means by MM .
DULONG and PETIT .
I have also proved that the melting points of gold and silver , determined by the expansion of the same bar of iron , agreed very closely with the same points determined by the expansion of platinum .
I was extremely anxious to complete this series of experiments by measuring the expansion of iron to its melting point .
For this purpose I had a small bar of iron cast from the best gray iron , and afterwards cleaned of all oxide and reduced to the size of the other bars employed by filing .
Upon measuring its expansion to the temperatures of boiling water and boiling mercury , I found the arcs upon the scale respectively 0§ 29 ' and 2§ 25 ' ; and this being considerably less than what I had obtained with the bar of wrought iron , I repeated the experiment with the latter in the same register that I had employed for the former , and obtained the measures of 0§ 35 ' and 2§ 44'-nearly agreeing with the previous determination : so that there can be no doubt that cast iron expands less than wrought iron , though the rate of increase for the higher temperature appears to be the same in both .
I now arranged the two bars in two registers ; and having strongly heated the fulrnace and filled the air-chamber itself with coke , I cleared out a space in which they could be placed , without coming in contact with the fuel on each side of them .
Their two ends rested on pieces of fire-brick ; the wrought iron was placed lowest , and , the thickness of the register , in advance of the cast iron ; which was placed about two inches higher .
The apertures were now all closed , and the draught increased to the utmost .
At the expiration of a quarter of an hour the register with the cast iron was removed with a pair of tongs ; and the metal upon lifting it , immediately flowed out at the two end 450 uf SOLIDS .
holes .
The register , with the wrought iron was then taken out .
The bar of the latter was found perfect , without any signs of oxidation or fusion .
The arc measured of the cast iron was.9 .
9 47 ' The arc of the wrought iron ... . .
7 56 ' I had some reason to think that the register , with the wrought iron bar , had not been exposed so fully to the heat as that with the cast iron : for , although placed slightly in advance of the latter towards the body of the furnace , it was not raised so high from the floor of the flue , which prlobably had a cooling influence ; and as the flame was drawn upwards , it must have struck with greater force upon the higher register .
I therefore replaced the wrought-iron bar in the register , and put it exactly in the position previously occupied by the cast iron ; it was then covered with charcoal , and the fire urged to the utmost .
At the expiration of twenty minutes it was removed : the bar was found uninjured , with a white metallic lustre , except over the apertures , where it was blue , and perfectly free from oxide .
The arc now , however , measured 11§ 16 ' .
Now from these experiments there are four ways of approximately determining the temperature of melting cast iron .
1st .
By taking the expansion of cast iron to its melting point , and calculating from the expansion for 150 ?
to the boiling point of water , upon the supposition that the same rate is maintained , and adding the initial temperature of 60 ?
, we obtain 3096 ? .
2ndly .
By calculating from the expansion of the same bar for 600 ?
to the boiling point of mercury , supposed equal , we obtain 2489 ? .
3rdly .
By assuming the expansion of a bar of wrought iron , at the point of melting cast iron , and calculating from the expansion of the same bar for 150 ?
to the boiling point of water , we obtain 2957 ? .
4thly .
By calculating from the expansion of the same bar for 600 ?
to the boiling point of mercury , supposed equal , we obtain 2533 ? .
It is remarkable that the mean of these four determinations is 2768 ?
; for it will be remembered that the corrected temperature , which I deduced from the expansion of a platinum bar plunged into melting cast iron , was 2786 ? .
It may be observed , that in both cast iron and wrought iron , the calculation from the rate of expansion to the boiling point of water gives a temperature higher than the true ; and that , in both , the calculation from the point of boiling mercury affords a result lower than the true .
This might afford some grounds for conjecturing that , although the rate of expansion evidently increases beyond the temperature of boiling water , it does not continue to increase to the end ; but there is another inference from the fact , which I am rather inclined to adopt .
In calculating the temperature of melting cast iron , from the expansion of the platinum bar , I applied a correction , upon the supposition that the same rate of increase of expansion which was exhibited by platinum between the boiling points of water and mercury continued to the higher degrees ; whereas there is great reason to suppose that the rate must be an increasing one ; and , although this might not sensibly affect the final result of the comparatively low temperature of melting silver , the calculation of the temperature of melting iron , which is more than one third higher , would be sensibly affected by it .
I think it therefore extremely probable that the true temperature of melting cast iron is below 2786 ? .
The consistency of these results will , I trust , remove any doubts as to the competency of the pyrometer to determine fixed and comparable points of very high temperatures , and induce those connected with arts and manufactures to introduce its use , for the purpose of ascertaining many questions of the highest interest , both to practical and theoretical science .
The experiments just detailed upon bars of wrought iron remove even the only trifling objection which could be brought against its general use ; namely , the expense of a platinum bar : for it is quite proved that a bar of wrought iron is sufficient for every practical purpose , and it affords the important additional advantage of a much more open scale .
I proceed now to remark that zinc , as well as iron , appears by the Tables to present an exception to the law of an increasing rate of expansion with increasing temperature ; the expansion for the 600 ?
to boiling mercury not being so much as four times that for the 150 ?
to boiling water .
I cannot , however , from some peculiar circumstances attending the experiment , place entire confidence in the result .
When , after boiling in mercury , the register was opened , the vapour was found to have gained admittance , and to have acted upon the zinc .
It was firmly fixed in the cavity , and was not removed without considerable difficulty and piecemeal .
At its upper end , the bar was 452 reduced almost to a point , and was very considerably thickened at its lowei end , and moulded to the bottom of the register , as if it had been partially fused .
It was hard and brittle .
The vapour of the mercury had probably combined with it at some temperature below the boiling point ; the amalgam so formed had flowed down to the bottom of the bar , and the mercury was afterwards expelled by the boiling temperature .
I may here observe , as not unworthy of attention , that in no instance have I seen a metal acted upon by the vapour of mercury at its full boiling temperature ; -even gold , which has so strong an affinity for it , comes out of it with its yellow colour perfectly unstained ; but when the mercury is in the fluid form at the same temperature , the gold is immediately dissolved by it .
Under these circumstances there certainly may exist some doubt whether the full amount of expansion in zinc to the boiling point of mercury was properly registered .
On the other hand , in confirmation of the result so recorded , it may be seen , in Table XIV .
of the expansion of the alloys , that a composition of half copper and half zinc presents the same anomaly ; the expansion for the 600 ?
to boiling mercury is not quite four times that of the 150 ?
to boiling water .
In the alloy of three fourths copper to one fourth zinc , the rate of expansion increases in a small degree ; and in common brass , where the proportion of zinc is still less , it increases still more rapidly .
My purpose in instituting these experiments upon the alloys , was to observe the relation which might exist between the expansions of the pure metals and those of their mixtures : and the better to illustrate any such , I made alloys of copper with known multiple proportions of zinc and tin .
I shall here present , in a tabularform , the temperatures of their melting points , as derived from their expansions to the boiling points of water and mercury ; as , although I am not able to compare them with results directly obtained by immersion , we can judge , by comparison with the similar calculation of the pure metals , within what limits any error is probably confined .

507 I have not included in the foregoing Table the alloy of half copper and half tin , but have exhibited its expansion to the boiling point of mercury in Table XIV .
This mixture was very hard and brittle , and resembled the speculum metal of reflecting telescopes .
After it had been exposed to boiling mercury , it appeared as if it had undergone partial fusion ; it was set fast in the cavity of the register , and had thickened towards the lower extremity .
I am inclined to think that it had nearly attained its melting point , but it was broken in removing it ; and I had not an opportunity of trying any further experiment with it .
With regard to these alloys , the experiments are not numerous enough to enable us to deduce with precision the general laws by which their expansions and points of fusion are governed ; but enough is discernible to show that the subject is well worthy of further investigation .
It appears 1st .
That the expansion of the compounds is not the mean of the expansions of the simple metals of which they are composed , but bears some proportion to their relative quantities .
Thus we may observe that the expansion of brass increases with the quantity of zinc which it contains , as does bronze or bellmetal with the quantity of tin .
2ndly .
That the expansion of brass is in an increasing ratio to the increase of temperature till the quantity of zinc amounts to one ialf , when it seems to assume a decreasing rate , as we have reason to suppose is the case with pure zinc .
On this account the melting points both of this mixture and zinc appear 454 to be higher when derived from their expansions to the boiling point of mercury , than when calculated from their expansions to the boiling points of water .
With this exception , there is great reason to suppose that the melting points of the alloys , from the higher rate of expansion , cannot be very far removed from the true temperatures .
3rdly .
That the melting point of copper is reduced by an admixture of one fourth of zinc to nearly the average which results from the proportions of the two ingredients ; but by an admixture of an equal quantity of tin it is reduced in a much greater proportion .
The temperature derived from the average with zinc would be 1690 ?
, and the corresponding temperature in the Table is 1750 ? .
The temperature derived from the average with tin would be 1607 ?
, but the corresponding temperature is only 1446 ? .
4thly .
That a similar power in tin to depress the melting point of another metal is exhibited in pewter ; in which we may observe that a mixture of one fifth of tin with lead reduces the melting point actually below that of either of the pure metals ; and we may recall to recollection the fact , that an alloy of eight parts of bismuth , whose fusing point is 476 0 ; five of lead , whose fusing point is 612 ?
; and three of tin , whose fusing point is 442 ?
, -liquefies at 212 ? .
I shall here subjoin a Table , in the usual form , of the progressive linear dilatation by heat of such solids as I have measured with the pyrometer to the boiling point of water , the boiling point of mercury , and their respective melting points , where they have been ascertained .
I have added to their apparent expansions by the register the corresponding expansion of the blacklead ; upon the assumption that the latter continues at an equal rate to temperatures above 662 ?
; in which it is not probable , from the preceding observations , that there is any error of material importance .

The regularity of these several expansions is very striking .
As long as the metal retains the solid form , the dilatation proceeds according to a fixed law , without any sudden starts or changes ; till assuming the form of a liquid it doubtless is subject to a different mode of action .
I shall conclude these observations with the results of some experiments which I made to determine , if possible , the cause of the singular change of texture in platinum , when intensely heated in the black-lead registers , which I described in my former paper .
Upon showing the bar so changed to those who were best acquainted with the working of this metal , they universally ascribed it to the action of sulphur : but nobody could explain to me why this action should require such a very intense heat ; as up to the temperature of melting cast iron , to which it had several times been exposed , no change took place ; but the bar remained perfectly soft and malleable .
In DE FERUSSAc 's Bulletin for November 1830 , there is an abstract of my paper on the Pyrometer , which the Editor concludes with the observation , that " 'unfortunately I enclosed in the crucible which contained the register 456 and the bar of platinum some pieces of iron , without being aware of the fact , which is known to all the workmen who manufacture platinum , that the mere presence of iron is enough to communicate brittleness to that metal .
" Upon inquiry amongst workmen in this country I cannot find that such a property has ever been observed in the course of their experience ; and when I consider that the bar in the cavity of the register was perfectly preserved from contact with the iron nails ; and moreover , that it had actually been plunged into melted , iron without any change of properties ; I cannot suppose that the alteration depended in any way upon this circumstance .
To resolve these doubts I took 116 grains of the brittle platinum , which had been ground without difficulty to a fine powder in a steel mortar , and boiled them in nitro-muriatic acid till I had effected a complete solution ; -a little of this solution produced a scarcely perceptible cloudiness in a solution of muriate of baryta .
This I have reason to think was owing to a slight impurity in the acids employed ; I infer therefore that there was no sulphur in the metal .
I proceeded to evaporate the solution ; which towards the end of the process assumed a gelatinous appearance .
When in this state , I poured alcohol upon it ; and as the acid still remained in excess , a violent reaction took place with extrication of nitrous gas .
I then evaporated to dryness and continued the heat ; till the salt of platinum kindled spontaneously , and finally was left in a spongy state .
This was again digested in nitro-muriatic acid , and the solution carefully evaporated to dryness .
The muriate of platinum was then dissolved in water , and a sandy residue remained ; which , when well washed and heated to redness , was of a grayish-white colour , and had all the properties of silica : it weighed 3.5 grains .
There can therefore , I think , be little doubt that at the hight temperature to which it was exposed , platinum took up as much as 3 per cent of silica ; or , more probably , a quantity of its base equivalent to that quantity of the earth , to which it owed all its change of character and properties .
A temperature considerably above that of melting cast iron appears to be necessary to this combination ; which is analogous in many respects to the absorption of carbon by iron in the process of making steel by cementation .
