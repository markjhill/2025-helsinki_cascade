" Some Observations on the Amount of Light reflected and transmitted by certain kinds of Glass .

( Abstract .
) The experiments were commenced in order to determine the amount of light lost by transmission through glass .
Plates of the same kind of glass , but of different thickness , were taken , and the amount of light they transmitted determined , and from these values the percentage amounts reflected and obstructed calculated .
The amount reflected from the first surface was also determined directly by measuring the relative intensities of the illumination produced by two argand flames , when the light from both fell directly on the photometric surfaces , and when the light from one fell directly whilst that from the other reached the photometer after reflection from the surface of the glass .
Experiments were also made to ascertain whether repolishing altered in any way the reflective power of the glass ; and the polarising angles of the glass before and after repolishing were also determined .
Conclusions .
It seems probable that the amount of light reflected by freshly polished glass varies with the way in which it has been polished , and that , if a perfect surface could be obtained without altering the refractive index of the surface-layer , then the amount would be accurately given by Fresnel 's formula , but that usually the amount differs from that given by the formula , being sometimes greater and sometimes less .

[ Dec. 6 , The formation of a film of lower refractive index on the glass would account for the defect in the reflected light ; but to account for the excess , it seems necessary to assume that the polishing has increased the optical density of the surface-layer , and the changes produced in the amount of light transmitted and in the angle of polarisation support this view .
After being polished , the surface of flint glass seems to alter somewhat readily , the amount of the reflected light decreasing , and the amount of the transmitted increasing , whilst with crown glass the change , if any , proceeds very slowly .
There is no evidence to show to what particular cause these changes are due .
The values of the transmission coefficients for light of mean refrangibility for the two particular kinds of glass are given , and show that for 1 cm .
the loss by obstruction amounts to 2'62 per cent , wiih the crown glass and 115 per cent , with the flint glass .
