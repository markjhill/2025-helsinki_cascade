181 The Spectrum of the Lighter Constituents of the Air .
By Herbert Edmeston Watson , B.Sc. ( LoncL ) .
( Communicated by Sir William Ramsay , F.R.S. Received June 23 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1908 .
) In 1900 , Professors Living and Dewar published a paper on " The Lighter Constituents of Air , " * and gave a table of wave-lengths for nearly 300 lines .
Some of these were shown to be produced by hydrogen , helium , and neon , but the greater number were of unknown origin .
A few years later the spectrum of pure neon was published by Baly , + and it was shown that many of Living and Dewar 's lines were due to that gas , but at the same time 162 lines remained which , in the opinion of that observer , did not belong to neon .
With the view of throwing some light on the matter , and ascertaining more definitely whether there was a constituent of the air of lower atomic weight than helium , CoatesJ fractionated a large quantity of air , but could find no constituents other than hydrogen , helium , and neon on examining the lightest fractions with a small prism spectroscope .
In order , however , to make quite sure of this point , Sir William Ramsay requested me to photograph the spectrum with the Rowland grating at University College , and the results of this work form the material of the present communication .
The main object of the research , namely , definite proof of the existence of a new gas , has been unsuccessful , as was to be expected from the preliminary work , but incidentally it has been shown that the neon spectrum is considerably more complicated than was formerly supposed , and a number of new lines have been measured .
Experimental .
The method of fractionation of the gas has already been fully described by Coats , S but it may be as well briefly to recapitulate it .
About 73,000 'litres , of air were continually circulated through the liquefying apparatus at University College until greatly reduced in volume by the condensation of the least volatile portions .
The residue was then condensed in portions of about 80 litres in a glass bulb immersed in liquid air boiling * 'Roy .

The Spectrum of the [ June 23 , under reduced pressure .
Light fractions were boiled off , and the process repeated several times until the volume was reduced to 4700 c.c. The portion of this gas which was not absorbed by charcoal at \#151 ; 190 ' C. was separated into several fractions .
Fraction 1 was pumped off charcoal at \#151 ; 205 ' C. , and fraction 2 at \#151 ; 190 ' C. These were the two fractions examined spectroscopically .
It is worthy of note that analysis showed neither of them to contain any appreciable quantity of hydrogen , this gas only boiling off at a higher temperature .
The form of vacuum tube used was one in which the capillary portion was viewed end on through a quartz plate cemented on with sealing wax .
The electrodes wTere situated in side tubes , so that the spectrum of the gas surrounding them was not photographed as in the experiments of Liveing and Dewar .
They were made of stout aluminium wire , and mounted as described by Baly.* Baly 's methods of filling the tubes and adjusting the pressure in them were also adopted , except with regard to removing the last traces of hydrogen from the electrodes , this gas being present in small quantities in the gas to be examined .
The Rowland grating used has a focal length of 10 feet , and is ruled with 14,438 lines to the inch .
When finally adjusted , it was found that the centres of lines of different orders upon the same plate were not in the same horizontal line , and consequently it was easy to distinguish lines of different orders .
This displacement was slight , and does not appear to have affected the relation between wave-lengths measured in different orders .
The spectra obtained were remarkably free from ghosts , and , in fact , when first set up , the grating was supposed to be perfect in this respect .
I have found , however , that on prolonged exposure all the very intense lines are accompanied by four ghosts , the outer pair being some distance from the true line .
They were recognised by the property of symmetry about the principal line , and were in several cases used to determine the true position of the latter .
If one ghost were masked by another line , the position of the corresponding ghost was calculated by means of the fact that the distance from the principal line is proportional to the wave-length .
It is hoped that by this means all spurious lines have been removed from the table of wave-lengths .
The whole spectrum was photographed in the first order , but lines of wave-length less than 4100 were measured in the second order as well .
The plates used were Wratten and Wainwright 's " Panchromatic , " the sensitiveness of which is practically equal for all portions of the spectrum below 7000 .
For the red region the " spectrum " plates of the same firm * Loc .

were used , these being sensitive to at least 7900 .
I am greatly indebted to Dr. Mees for personally making them for me .
It was found preferable to make exposures during the night , as there was less vibration and the temperature remained more constant .
The second condition was very important , since it was found possible to obtain first-class plates only when the temperature variation was less than 1 ' ; but the grating being situated in the basement , the variation during one night seldom exceeded 3 ' , and was usually much less .
All the plates were taken between the temperatures 11 ' and 18 ' C. Exposures of about 16 hours were given , this comparatively long time being necessary to show many faint lines which exist in the spectrum .
The very strong lines in the orange region were photographed with tubes which had partially run down , in order to avoid over-exposure .
In all cases a weak current from an induction coil without a Leyden jar was used , so as to prolong the life of the tubes as much as possible .
After each exposure an iron spectrum was photographed below that of the gas , the slit being screened so that the points of the longer lines in the two spectra just met .
As the relative positions of the principal neon lines and standard iron lines had been already determined by Baly , it was considered unnecessary to repeat this work .
The wave-lengths of iron lines given by Kayser and Bunge* were , however , used to eliminate errors , according to the method described by Baly , f with the exception that the correction applied to the wave-length of a gas line differed from the value deduced from the correction curve by a small number which was constant for any one plate , and of such a magnitude as to make the corrected wave-lengths agree as nearly as possible with Baly 's .
This procedure is necessary , because the gas and iron spectra were photographed through different portions of the slit and consequently were apt to suffer a slight relative displacement .
The error in the wave-lengths given is difficult to estimate .
All the plates were measured at least twice , and the readings in nearly every case o agreed within 0*001 cm .
, a distance corresponding to 0*05 Angstrom unit .
Usually the agreement was much better .
The wave-lengths , as determined from different plates , agreed in general within 0*04 A.U. , but those of the very strong and very wreak lines sometimes differed by as much as 0*1 A.U. , and in such cases they were remeasured .
Any values which differed much from those given by Baly were also carefully revised .
In the red part of the spectrum , and the region from 5000 to 4000 , a number of plates were taken , and it is hoped that the error in the wave-lengths is not greater than * 'Brit .

Spectrum of the [ June 23 , 0 03 A.U. This also applies to lines of shorter wave-length than 4000 , as they were measured in two orders .
Baly has measured nearly all the lines in the remainder of the spectrum , and his results are probably the more accurate since they were deduced from photographs in the second order .
The hydrogen , helium , and mercury lines which were found in the spectrum afforded a means of checking the absolute wave-lengths , and the agreement was found to be good throughout .
The Constituents of the Gas .
As before mentioned , two fractions of gas were examined , one pumped off charcoal at a temperature of \#151 ; 205 ' C. and the other at \#151 ; 190 ' C. After a complete series of photographs of each fraction had been taken the gases were sparked for a considerable time with oxygen , and the latter removed by means of phosphorus .
This procedure had no effect on the spectrum beyond removing the hydrogen lines , and moreover the two fractions appear to be identical as regards their constituents , the only difference being in the relative intensities of some of the lines .
The spectrum consisted entirely of bright lines , and no trace of nitrogen or carbon compounds could be detected .
Three of the brightest mercury lines were obtained from freshly filled tubes , but were only just visible .
The small quantity of hydrogen present in the gas before sparking was a source of considerable difficulty since there appears to be at present no reliable table of the vrave-lengths of the secondary hydrogen spectrum .
Ames* has published a list of lines obtained from a vacuum tube of hydrogen , and about half these appeared on my plates .
No trace of the weaker lines was to be seen , and hence it appeared unlikely that any other hydrogen lines would be present .
There were , however , several faint lines on my plates which appeared only occasionally , and these were all found in a list given by Frostf of lines which appeared in a helium tube after running for some time .
The region of the spectrum embraced is only from 4723\#151 ; 4358 , but from comparison with Hasselberg 's original secondary hydrogen spectrum } it is concluded that these lines are due to hydrogen .
The number of them is 90 , of which only nine are given by Ames .
It appears , therefore , that there is a spectrum of hydrogen which is seen only under exceptional circumstances , one of the most favourable of which is the presence of a monatomic gas .
A further investigation of this point is in progress .
Owing to the limited range of Frost 's values it is possible that a * ' Phil. Mag. , ' vol. 30 , p. 33 , 1890 .

185 few hydrogen lines have not been removed from the table of wave-lengths , but their number is not likely to be great because the relative intensities of nearly all the lines given were constant on different plates taken with different tubes .
All the helium lines given by Rung and Paschen , * except the very weakest , were seen and measured , but the helium spectrum was not nearly as strong as that of the neon .
In some cases the former was very faint indeed owing to the selective absorption of the helium by the electrodes , and on one plate no trace of the line 5875-8 was to be seen .
The lines at 6678 and 3447 , however , were very bright on the same plate , and it must be concluded that these are two neon lines almost coincident with the helium lines .
The line at 3447 is , moreover , given by Baly as a strong line , though in his tubes the helium was always allowed to run out before a photograph was taken .
There appears to be"a similar pair at 4713 , though I was unable to obtain a plate on which the neon line alone was present .
The wavelengths of the lines concerned are :\#151 ; He ... ... ... . .
6678-37 4713-25 3447-73 He ... ... ... . .
6678-50 4713-51 3447*83 and no reason can be at present assigned to their close proximity .
Argon was present in minute traces , even after the exhaustive fractionation the gas had undergone ; it is not surprising , therefore , to find that Baly 's gas also contained argon , and several lines given by him are due to this substance .
All that have been found are given in the tables , and have not been eliminated as have the lines due to gases previously mentioned .
The question which now arises is : What is the origin of the remaining lines ?
Their number is 321 , of which only 115 are given by Baly , and 132 by Living and Dewar , and it might well be supposed that some of them are due to elements as yet unknown .
Accordingly their wave-lengths were carefully compared with those of the chief nebular lines as measured by Wright , f and the coronal lines given by Lockyer.^ There was not the slightest indication of the existence of any of these lines in my spectrum .
Marshall Watts , in a list of auroral lines , S assigns some to neon , but the wave-lengths given are not sufficiently accurate to enable definite conclusions to be drawn .

Mr. H. E. Watson .
The Sp of the [ June 23 , of the sun was examined .
A certain number of approximate coincidences were observed , and are noted in the table of wave-lengths , but it is highly probable that they are merely accidental , for the lines in question are remarkable neither for their intensity nor their character .
This being so , another explanation was looked for .
It will be observed that all the lines not given by Baly are of comparatively low intensity , and occur largely in the ultra-violet , and hence it is quite probable that they are really neon lines which were not previously obtained owing to insufficient exposure .
Baly 's photographs were all in the second order , which for the particular grating used is not nearly as bright as the first , and , moreover , his vacuum tube had a thin glass end which would naturally obliterate much of the ultra-violet light .
To confirm this supposition a different sample of neon and helium containing considerably more helium than the former one was photographed .
The lines ascribed to neon were all seen , and were identical in intensity with those formerly obtained , so that it appears very unlikely that any gases other than helium and neon were present in either sample .
There is , of course , the possibility that a gas very similar to neon in physical properties exists , but the periodic table renders this unlikely , and it is to be expected that a gas with lower atomic weight than helium would resemble this gas substance rather than neon , with the result that its spectrum would be relatively stronger in the second sample examined .
It may consequently be stated fairly conclusively that the spectrum of a new gas has not been photographed , but this is by no means synonymous with saying that such a gas does not exist .
There are at least three reasons for this .
Firstly , it was remarked by Coates that the fractions of air distilled from charcoal at \#151 ; 190 ' C. contained hardly any hydrogen , this gas boiling off only at a higher temperature .
Consequently , it is possible that another gas might behave similarly , and if this were the case its spectrum would probably be masked by that of the nitrogen in the later fractions .
Secondly , as already mentioned , the helium in the gas was absorbed by the electrodes more readily than the neon , and a third gas might he absorbed almost at once before its spectrum could be photographed .
Thirdly , it has been observed by Cameron and Bamsay* that helium is absorbed by glass and silica even in the cold , and it is therefore just possible that a monatomic gas of very low atomic weight might pass through these substances with ease , and if this be so it seems unlikely that a lighter constituent of air will ever be isolated .
It still remains to make a few remarks about the tables of Baly , and Liveing and Dewar .
Baly makes no mention of the strong line 6334 , * 'Chem .

although it is assigned to neon by Living and Dewar .
I have been unable to find the reference for this , but it seems likely that the omission is due to a clerical error .
The same author also gives several lines not in my list .
Some of these I have identified as argon lines , some as ghosts , and a few as belonging to a different order , but the most careful search has failed to reveal any trace of the rest .
The origin of many of Living and Dewar 's lines is by no means clear .
Since these observers liquefied only about 200 litres of air , less than a three-hundredth part of the amount treated by Coats , it does not seem at all likely that they can have obtaiued any gas which was unnoticed by the latter .
Their gas , however , contained considerable quantities of hydrogen , and though it is stated that the hydrogen lines wTere not usually visible when photographs were taken , owing to the passage of this gas to the positive pole , yet it may have happened that there was hydrogen round the negative pole as well , but that this yielded a hitherto unrecognised spectrum .
If this be not admissible , it must be supposed that the negative pole has some peculiar influence upon the gas in its immediate neighbourhood which complicates the spectrum considerably .
The following tables show the wave-lengths obtained , those of Baly , and Living and Dewar being added for the sake of comparison .
The intensities are given in the usual way , with 10 as maximum , although this method of representing them is wholly inadequate , and in fact misleading .
Many lines of apparently the same intensity differ greatly in reality , and the strongest lines are many hundred times as intense as the weakest .
0 represents a line which can just be measured with a low-power microscope .
A few weaker lines could be seen with a small lens , but could not be measured , and are omitted .
Anything noticeable about a particular line is placed in the column headed " Remarks .
" In conclusion , I should like to tender my warmest thanks to Sir William Ramsay for the great interest he has taken in this work , for personally sparking down and repurifying the gases , and for frequently undertaking the laborious process of remaking and refilling the vacuum tubes .
Also to Mr. Baly for advice with regard to the use of the grating , and to Mr. Coats for some help in the earlier part of the work .
Note added July 28.\#151 ; Since going to press , the hydrogen spectrum has been completely photographed .
Only one hydrogen line was found in the table of wave-lengths , and this has now been removed .
