) Introduction .
In previous papers* the morphology and action on animals of this strain t of trypanosome were described .
In this a short account of its development in Glossina morsitans is given , in order to compare it with the development of the Human strain of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland.f It is to be regretted that more material is not available , but , scanty as it is , there is enough to show that this strain develops in the alimentary tract and salivary glands of G. morsitans in the same way as the Trypanosoma brucei and gambiefise group .
The Commission aimed at having five positive experiments in every series of transmission experiments , but in this case failed .
The failure was principally due to the difficulty of procuring laboratory-bred flies , and also to the fact that this strain of trypanosome does not readily develop in G. morsitans .
The Development of the Naturally Infected Dog Strain in G. MORSITANS .
Eleven experiments were made with laboratory-bred flies .
Two were positive and nine negative .
Three hundred and seventy-six Hies were used and fourteen were found infected\#151 ; 3'7 per cent. This small percentage is partly due to the fact that in some of the experiments few or none of the flies wTere dissected .
There is the same discrepancy to be noted here as in T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 .
In some of the experiments not a single infected fly was found , whereas in Experiment 2018a there were seven in a cageful of 36 .

Experiment 2067 was a successful experiment , as all the animals the flies fed on became infected with the exception of the guinea-pig , and it will be remembered that the guinea-pig was found to be refractory to this strain .
Experiment 2394 also infected a dog , but as none of the flies were dissected none were found infected .
From these two experiments it would appear that a period of from 24 to Sir D. Bruce and others .
Trypanosome 58 days may elapse before the cycle of development of the Naturally Infected Dog strain is complete in G. mand the fly becomes infective .

This experiment was carefully carried out from beginning to end , and yet only one fly was found with invasion of the salivary glands .
This one fly seems to have done all the mischief , infecting one after the other a dog , monkey , antelope , and finally another monkey .
There is some doubt about this last monkey , as the fly died 50 days after its first infective feed , and the monkey had only come into use the day before .
This particular fly , however , is reported not to have fed on that day , no fresh blood having been found in its intestine .
It may be that it attempted to feed and so infected the monkey , but was unable to draw blood .
If this fly did not infect the last monkey , it is difficult to explain its infection , as all the remaining flies were dissected on the 54th day and all found to be negative .
In Experiment 2394 none of the flies were dissected .

218 Trypanosome causing Disease Man in From an examination of these Tables it will be admitted , in spite of the paucity of the material , that the Naturally Infected Dog strain belongs to the same group as T. gcimbiense and T.brucei in regard to its mode of development in G. morsitans .
Tiie Type of Trypanosome found in the Infected Flies .
A number of drawings of the developmental forms of the Naturally Infected Dog strain of trypanosome was made from the alimentary tract and salivary glands of the infected tsetse flies .
In the intestine the same type of trypanosome was found which has already been described and figured in previous papers.* In the only infected fly which showed a development in the salivary glands , the trypanosomes were described in the living unstained preparations as being exceedingly numerous , small and active .
In the stained preparations the trypanosomes were seen to be typical " blood forms " and absolutely identical to those figured in the development of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasalandf and also in that of T. brucei , Zululand , 1913.\#163 ; It is therefore unnecessary to figure them again .
Conclusion .
The trypanosome of the Naturally Infected Dog strain belongs to the same group as T. gambiense and T. brucei vel rhodesiense , the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland , and is probably merely a weak strain of the latter species .
