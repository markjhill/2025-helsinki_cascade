]\gt ; Conclusion .
Between 700 mm. and 100 mm. pressure hydrogen appears to diffuse palladium heated to about 10 C. to 30 C. at a rate proportional to the pressure of the gas , though the rate curve appears to consist of two portions .
It is shown that by assuming the pressure-time curve to consist of two exponentiaIs of different slope , the experimental values can be reproduced with considerable accuracy , certainly with an accuracy which leaves no question as to the proportionality of the rate to the , not to the square root or any other power of the pressure .
As in the case of the rate of solution of hydrogen at constant pressure by palladium foil where discontinuous curves are obtained , the two exponentiaIs of different slope are accounted for by metallic allotropes .
At pressures lower than 100 mm. the rate of diffusion becomes more and more slow , and is not apparently related to any simple function of the pressure . .
