" On the formation or secretion of Alkaline and Earthy Bodies by Animals .
" By Robert Rigg , Esq. , F.R.S. From the results of a comparison made by the author of the weight of the ashes obtained from a quantity of bread , equal to that which was the sole food of two mice during thirty-eight days , with the weight of the ashes of their excretions during the same period , it appeared that the latter exceeded the former in the proportion of 1334 to 934 .
The amount of soluble salts was also found to be greater in the latter than in the former .
From these data , the author infers that both alkaline and earthy bodies are formed out of their elements by the animal systeml , and found in their excretions .
