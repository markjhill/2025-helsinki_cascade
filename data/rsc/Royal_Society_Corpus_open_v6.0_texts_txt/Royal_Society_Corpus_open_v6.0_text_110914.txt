" On the Comet of 1844-45 .
" By John Collingwood Hail , Esq. Communicated by Charles Terry , Esq. , F.R.S. The author gives a series of observations , accompanied by a diagram , made by him at Auckland , in New Zealand , on the comet of 1844-45 , which there appeared on the 20th of December 1844 and disappeared on the 30th of January following , having been visible forty-two days .
Its most remarkable feature was , that during its greatest brilliancy , the nucleus was not surrounded by the nebulous matter , but was situated at the very extremity of the head , and at times even appeared quite detached .
