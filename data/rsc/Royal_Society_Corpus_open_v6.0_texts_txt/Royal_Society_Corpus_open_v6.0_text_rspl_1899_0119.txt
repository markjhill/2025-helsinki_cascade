I would not be thought to impugn the importance of the study of such organic phenomena in connection with emotional mental states .
The only respect in which the here given observations affect the position of affairs is , that they , I think , render it necessary to attribute to these elements of emotion another significance than that imputed by the authorities quoted in my opening paragraph .
The picturesque incisiveness of all that comes from Professor James 's pen , renders the more persuasive any argument that it pursues .
His suggestive chapters led to the above attempt at examination of his theory , an examination the incompleteness of which I wish to unreservedly acknowledge .
The expenses of this investigation have been in part met by a grant given by the Research Committee of the British Medical Association .

** On the Brightness of the Corona of April 16 , 1893 .
Preliminary Note .

The visual brightness of the corona was measured at the total eclipses of August 29 , 1886 , and April 16 , 1893 , by Professor T. E. Thorpe , using a method arranged by Sir W. Abney ( 'Phil .
Trans. , A , 1889 , p. 363 , .
and 1896 , p. 433 ) .
Soon after the first of these eclipses , Sir W. Abney devised a method of measuring the brightness photographically , by exposing a portion of the plate , which was not exposed to the sky , to a standard light passed through a row of small square screens of varying and known thickness .
The result is a series of " standard squares " on the plate , which show the density of deposit due to standard lights of known values ; and by comparing the density of the coronal image we find the brightness of the corona in terms of these standard lights .
These squares were first put on the coronal photographs by English observers at the eclipse of December , 1889 , and have been systematically used by them since .
The 1889 photographs have not yet been measured .
Some measures of the 1893 photographs were made by me in Sir W. Abney 's laboratory at South Kensington , in July , * * Grundriss d. Psychologies yoL 1 , 3te Auflage , Leipzig , 1893 .

1894 ; but the standard squares had not received a sufficiently long exposure and additional experiments were required .
These were carried out by Sir W. Abney during the year ; but causes which need not here be dwelt on ( chiefly the desire to make further measures which other work has hitherto prevented but which are now being made ) have delayed the publication of the results far too long : and , while still reserving the details for a more complete account , I publish one or two general results which may be useful to others in preparing for the forthcoming eclipse .
Three plates were measured , taken by Serg .
Kearney , at Fundium .
He was provided with a " double-tube , " which took photographs of two sizes , the diameters of the moon 's image being 0-6 inch and 1*5 inches respectively .

250 The plates measured were those numbered 3a ( large scale ) , 3 and 5 ( small scale ) , of which the first was measured rather elaborately along four radii extending due N. , S. , E. , W , from the limb respectively , and the reference table or curve of standard lights was constructed for this plate .
The following table shows the actual measures , each number being deduced from the mean of three sector readings by application of the curve of standard lights .
The unit of the table is the effect caused by an amyl acetate lamp shining on the plate from a distance of 9 feet for 1 second .
The numbers represent powers of 2 , giving the intensities in terms of this unit .
Thus 7 *7 means 27'7 , or 208 times the unit .
The distances from the limb are in terms of a cardboard scale , and it was found by measurement of the moon 's diameter that 100 div. = 15'-6 = solar radius nearly .
Hence 10 div. may be regarded as 04 solar radius .

The intensity of the light is clearly determinable within an error of 0T or 0*2 , i.e. , of 2'1 or 2 , which are ratios of 1'07 and 1T5 respectively .
( 2 ) The intensity falls off in nearly the same manner in all four directions .
[ It may be remarked that 1893 was near a sun-spot maximum , and the corona of the kind approximating to symmetry all round the limb.^ ] Such differences as there are do not aiise from the excentric position of the sun behind the moon ; for the photograph was taken after the middle of totality , when the moon would have advanced towards the east , and hence the western radius should be brighter than the eastern at the same distance from moon 's limb ; whereas the contrary is the case .
Also there is a marked difference between the N. and S. radii .
VOL. LXVI .
2 11 Prof. H. H. Turner .
( 3 ) The falling off in intensity is very rapid at first .
At one radius from the limb it has fallen to one-twentieth , at two radii to one-hundredth .
( 4 ) As regards the absolute intensity , it will be more convenient to refer the brightness to the more familiar unit of the moon 's brightness .
It is a fair assumption to take the total brightness of the moon as 0*02 candle at one foot ; or ( since an amyl adetate lamp = 0-8 candle ) to 0-02 x 81 -f 0*8 of the units ( amyl acetate lamp at 9 feet ) adopted in the intensity scale : that is , to 2*025 of such units .
Now if the moon were to shine for 50 seconds ( the exposure of the photograph ) instead of 1 , we must multiply this number by 50 ; and if further it shines on the plate through a 4-inch object glass , so that the light falling on this 4-inch circle is collected into an image of 1 *5 inches diameter , the brightness of any point of this patch would represent 2*025 x 50 x ( 4/ 1 *5)2 = 720 units = 29'5 units .
Thus if we subtract 9*5 from all the numbers in Table I , we shall get numbers fairly expressing the coronal brightness in terms of that of the moon , in powers of 2 as before .
( 5 ) The results from the other photographs need not be given ( in this preliminary note ) in detail : they confirm those already given remarkably well ; and show that the diminution of light is very gradual indeed after 45 minutes from the limb .
They also seem to show that the readings near the edges of the plate in 3a are too low by about 1*0 ; which is due to the fact that the magnifier is too small to take in the whole object gla'ss at the edges of the field .
( 6 ) We can now give the comparison of visual and photographic observations .
The results from plates 3 and 5 are preferred to those of 3a far from the limb , for the reason stated in the last paragraph , and for measures near the limb , results obtained from special measures with a plain glass reflector .
In 'Phil .
Trans. , 'A , vol. 180 ( 1889 ) , pp. 380\#151 ; 1 , Abney and Thorpe give their visual readings for the 1886 eclipse in terms of a Siemens ' unit , and remark that the moon would have given an image equal to 1*2 candles or.1*4 Siemens ' units on the same scale .
Hence we must divide their figures by 1*4 to get results comparable with the above ; and the same must be done for the 1893 eclipse , the numbers for which are given in ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1896 ( A ) , p. 433 .
We thus get the following table of comparative results , replacing now the powers of 2 by ordinary decimals :\#151 ; On the Brightness of the Corona of April 16 , 1893 .

It would be interesting to have this 'Comparison made .
For the region where we have a comparison , it appears that the light falls off photographically more rapidly than visually .
This is in accordance with experience , the faint extensions having been seen more easily than photographed .
As regards the central portions , we have some indirect information ; for the total brightness of the 1893 corona was found to be equivalent to 0-026 Siemens ' unit at one foot or 0*022 candle , rather more than the value assumed above for the moon .
Integrating numerically for the part in the annulus extending from " .6 radii to 2-6 radii , we find that this portion is equal to 0-20 moon photographically and 0'25 moon visually .
This leaves about 0*75 moon ( visual ) for the part within this distance ( i.e. , from the limb to 0*6 radius ) , while photographically the value got from the curve is only 0-44 moon .
It seems as though the corona were altogether brighter visually than photographically , in the ratio of about 3 to 2 ; but this conclusion needs confirmation .
An attempt has been made ( in the column " calculated " of the above table ) to represent the brightness by a formula .
The American photographs of 1878 suggested that the coronal light varied inversely .as the square of the distance from the sun 's limb .
Abney and Thorpe find that this law does not hold ; but the photographic observations can be made to obey the law approximately .
The calculated numbers are obtained from the formula 0-05 l(d + 0T8)2 , 408 On the Brightness of the Corona of April 16 , 1893 .
where dis the distance from moon 's limb given in first column .
The distance is thus measured from a point 0T8 = 2'-7 within the circle on the photograph taken as the moon 's limb .
This is well within the sun 's limb , though near it .
It needjiot cause much surprise that the calculated numbers close to the limb exceed the observed ; for the corona close to the limb was obscured during part of the exposure by the advancing moon .
Further examination of these points is required .

The researches of M. Henri Becquerei have shown that compounds of uranium possess the property now called " radio-activity ; that |is , rays emitted by them affect a sensitive photographic plate through bodies usually considered opaque to light ; they discharge .an electrometer when brought near it ; and they are deflected by a magnet .
These rays are now called " Becquerei rays , or " uranic rays .
