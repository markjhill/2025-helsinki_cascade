" On the Comparative Osteological Forms in the Adult European Male and Female of the Human Species .
" By Walter Adam , M.D. , Fellow of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh .
With a view to the future investigation of the osteological developement of the human race , the author gives , in the present paper , the results of a great number of measurements , which he has very carefully made , of the dimensions of the different bones composing the adult human skeleton .
The male bones examined were those in the collection of Dr. Monro ; the female bones were furnished by Dr. Hamilton .
The author was anxious to fix on some one dimension in the skeleton which might be taken as the standard of all the measurements : and finding that no bone of the trunk or limbs pos ?
sessed the requisite characters for that purpose , he sought for it in the cranium ; and the result of an extensive series of observations led him to adopt as the standard of measure the distance between the prolongations of the zygomatic ridges , immediately over the meatus auditorius externus , as being that dimension which was less liable to variation than any other of the human cranium .
This line he denominates the auricular transverse ; and , adopting a scale of which the unit is the 14th part of this line , being generally about the third of an inch , he states at length , in multiples of this unit , the dimensions , in different directions , of almost every bone in the skeleton ; noting more especially the differences that occur in those of the two sexes .
Of these measurements , which are given in much detail , and in many instances arranged in a tabular form , it is impossible to give any abridgement .
The conclusion hc deduces from his inquiry is , that every bone in the body exhibits certain modifications , according to the sex of the individual .
