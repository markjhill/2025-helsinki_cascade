( Abstract .
) A resume of the greater part of this paper has already appeared in the 'Proceedings ' for January 29 , June 18 , and November 26 , 1857 .
The author has since examined the expansion by heat of wood cut across the grain , which , as well as that cut in the direction of the fibre , he finds to be increased by tension and decreased by moisture .
When a sufficient quantity of water has been absorbed the expansibility by heat ceases , and wood is contracted in each direction by rise of temperature .
Nevertheless , when wood , saturated with water , is weighed in water of different temperatures , the result shows cubical expansion of the substance of the wood by heat .
The inference drawn by the author from these facts is , that the contraction of the dimensions of wet wood is owing to the action of heat in diminishing the force of capillary attraction , and that thus the walls of the minute cells and tubes of the woody structure are partially relieved from a force which thrusts them asunder , a small quantity of water exuding at the same time .
In the case of wet wood which contracts by heat , he finds , in accordance with Professor Thomson 's formula , that a rise of temperature is produced by the application of tension .
In conformity with the deductions of the same philosopher , the author has also been able to detect experimentally the minute quantity of heat absorbed , in bending or twisting an elastic spring , arising from the diminution of the elastic force of metals with a rise of temperature .
