236 Mr. C. F. Varley on the Discharge of Electricity [ Jan. 12 , of bromine vapour , a portion of its fluorine being expelled and a portion corroding the platinum and forming an insoluble compound of fluoride of platinum and bromide of silver .
In carbon boats at the same temperature the whole of the silver-salt was converted into bromide , the boat being corroded and the fluorine escaping in chemical union with the carbon .
The action of bromine on an aqueous solution of argentic fluoride was similar to the action of chlorine .
A solution of argentic fluoride yielded copious precipitates hoth with hydrobromic and bromic acids .
Under the influence of a temperature of 200 ' to 600 ' Fahr. in closed platinum vessels , iodine very slowly and incompletely decomposes argentic fluoride without corroding the vessels , and produces a feeble compound of argentic iodide , fluorine , and iodine , from which the two latter substances are expelled at a red heat .
At a red heat in platinum vessels , iodine produces argentic iodide , and in the presence of free argentic fluoride corrodes the vessels in consequence of formation of platinic fluoride ; iodine and fluorine pass away together during the reaction .
In vessels of carbon at the same temperature argentic iodide is formed , the vessels are corroded , and a gaseous compound of fluorine and carbon is produced .
By treating an aqueous solution of argentic fluoride with iodine , similar results are produced as with bromine and chlorine ; a similar solution yields copious precipitates both with hydriodic and iodic acids .
A mode of analysis of iodine is also fully described in the paper .
A known weight of iodine was dissolved in absolute alcohol , a strong solution of argentic nitrate of known strength added to it , in portions at a time , with stirring until the colour of iodine exactly disappeared .
The mixture was evaporated , the free nitric acid expelled by careful heat , and the residue weighed .
The residue was then heated to fusion , to convert the iodate of silver into iodide , and again weighed .
Two experiments of this kind yielded accurate results , and the process was easy and expeditious .

" Some Experiments on the Discharge of Electricity through Rarefied Media and the Atmosphere .
" By Cromwell Fleet-wood Varley .
Communicated by Prof. Stokes^ Sec. R.S. Received October 5 , 1870 .
After the labours of Mr. Gassiot , one approaches this subject with diffidence , lest he should appear to be attempting to appropriate the glory which so justly belongs to that gentleman and to Professor Grove .
The nature of the action inside the tube is at present involved in considerable mystery , but some light is thrown upon the subject by the following experiments .
Before describing them , however , the author wishes to observe that he has seen Mr. Gassiot 's last paper* and finds that , so tar as regulating the strength of the current is concerned , he has been proceeding in a similar manner to the author .

The tube principally used in these experiments is shown full size in photograph No. 1 ( PI .

) ; it contains two aluminium wire rings , the one -5%inch in diameter , the other -foinch , and separated -fo inch : the tube was 15 inch in diameter , inches in length ; it was one of Geissler 's manufacture , was very well exhausted , and professed to contain hydrogen .
A U-shaped glass tube containing glycerine and water was placed in circuit .
Two aluminium wires inserted in this tube gave a ready means of reducing or augmenting the resistance at pleasure .
Glycerine affords an easy means of producing very great resistances .
The battery used in this experiment was a Daniell 's battery , each cell having a resistance of from 50 to 100 ohms .
The resistance of the glycerine-and-water tube was between 2 and 3 megohms ; this latter resistance was made large , in order that the resistance of the tube and battery might be neglected without entailing error .
The following laws were found to govern the passage of the current:\#151 ; 1st , each tube requires a certain potential to leap across ; 2nd , a passage for the current having been once established , a lower potential is sufficient to continue the current ; 3rd , if the minimum potential , which will maintain a current through the tube , be P , and the power be varied to P-f 1 , P + 2 , \amp ; c. to P+w , the current will vary in strength , as 1 , 2 , \amp ; c. n. Tables I. \amp ; II .
( p. 242 ) illustrate this ; there is a little irregularity in the figures due to the irregularity of the battery , although it was recharged for the occasion .
It thus appears that a certain amount of power is necessary to spring across the vacuum ; after that it behaves as an ordinary conductor , excluding that portion of the battery whose potential is P , and which is used to balance the opposition of the tube .
In these experiments P was 304 cells .
The tube in question could not be persuaded to allow a current of less than 323 cells to pass ; but when once the current had established a channel , on lowering the potential by short circuiting portions of the battery , so as not to break the circuit , the current would flow when the battery was reduced to 308 cells .
By , however , passing a current from 600 cells , in the manner shown in PI .
III .
fig. 1 , through the second tube , filled with pure glycerine , and offering several thousand megohms resistance , an extremely feeble current , too weak to affect the galvanometer , kept a channel open by its passage ; with this arrangement the figures in Table II .
were obtained , which are more regular at the commencement , and a power of P -j-1 would pass across the tube .
The positive pole alone was observed to be luminous when the current was very minute , and the negative only was luminous when the current was strong .
The following experiments were tried , and the results , which have been photographed , accompany this .
A current was passed through the U tube and the vacuum ; the U tube contained pure glycerine , and had a very large resistance , which was gra238 Mr. C. F. Varley on the Discharge of Electricity [ Jan. 12 , dually reduced .
At the commencement it was more than 10,000 megohms ; the upper or small ring was positive , the lower ring was negative .
The power was so reduced that the faintest possible light only was visible ; in this case the positive wire alone was luminous , whether it were the large or small ring that was positive .
No. 2 ( PI .
II .
) is a photograph of this .
The light was so feeble that , though the experiment was conducted in a perfectly dark room , we were sometimes unaware whether the current was passing or not .
An exposure of thirty minutes ' duration left , as will be seen , a very good photographic record of what was taking place ; this means of viewing light too feeble for the eye may receive other applications .
The resistance was then reduced , when the light became much more brilliant , \#151 ; a tongue of light projected from the positive pole towards the negative , the latter being still almost completely obscure .
The light around the positive pole was to all of our eyes white , while the projecting flame was a bright brick-red .
This bright brick-red , however , possessed great photographic power , as will be seen by photograph No. 3 .
The negative wire at this stage began to show signs of luminosity .
As the power was increased , the flame became detached from the positive pole , as shown in photograph 4 .
On still further increasing the power , the positive pole ceased to be luminous , as in photograph 5 ; and on still further increasing the power , by removing the U tube altogether , the phenomena presented themselves which are shown in photograph 6 , in which the light surrounded the negative wire .
The photograph shows a white flattened hour-glass , apparently detached from the wire ; to the eye , however , the wire appeared to be surrounded by a bright blue envelope | inch in diameter , which did not possess sufficient photographic power to leave a record of itself , while the red portion did so : this photograph was exposed only ten seconds to the light .
A large condenser was now attached to the battery , and discharged through the tube ( the condenser had a capacity of 27 microfarads ) ; this was equivalent to a momentary contact with a battery of little or no resistance .
The flash was exceedingly brilliant to the eye : it could be heard outside the tube with a sharp click ; the eye , however , was so dazzled as not to be able to see its shape .
Photographs 7 a and 7 b show that the light was confined entirely to the positive pole ; thus , then , as the power is increased from nothing upwards , the first pole to become luminous is the positive ; secondly , the two poles become luminous ; thirdly , the negative pole alone is luminous ; and fourthly , with an instantaneous discharge , the positive pole only is luminous .
The eye and the collodion-plate do not , however , tell the same tale in photograph 6 .
When the resistance in the U tube was greatly reduced , and a galvanometer ( not very sensitive ) was inserted , so that the chief resistance in circuit was that of the exhausted tube , as the potential was augmented cell Varlev w VT Wesley ii th 1871.1 through Rarefied Media , fyc .
by cell , the changes took place abruptly and suddenly .
For example , .
when the power was so low that the positive pole only was visible , the current was feeble , and kept augmenting in power as cell after cell was added on .
Suddenly the luminous red flame ( phot .
3 ) made its appearance , and the galvanometer showed that the current had suddenly augmented three or four times in power .
As the power was again further increased cell by cell , the current again steadily augmented in proportion , until the luminous tongue suddenly disappeared , and the appearance in 6 was shown , the galvanometer showing a still further sudden increase in the current .
The phenomena shown in 4 and 5 can only be obtained by inserting a large resistance .
Nature of the luminous cloud.\#151 ; Plucker has shown that when such an exhausted tube , with a current through it , is placed between the poles of an electro-magnet , a luminous arch is produced , which arch follows the course of the magnetic rays .
( See photograph 8 , in which the negative pole was a small ring .
Photograph 9 shows the arch when the large ring was negative .
) As the electro-magnet is magnetized , the tube , which before was full of aluminous cloud , is seen gradually to change ; the magnet gathers up this diffused cloud , and builds up the arch shown in 8 and 9 .
Inasmuch as the electricity was passing in a continuous current from the battery , from wire to wire , it is evident the light is projected right and left into those parts of the tube where there is no electric current flowing .
To endeavour to ascertain the nature of this arch , a tube ( PI .
III .
fig. 2 ) was constructed .
A piece of talc , bent into the form U , had a fibre of silk stretched across it ; on this fibre of silk was cemented a thin strip of talc , 1 inch in length , ^ inch broad , weighing about -[V of a grain .
The tube was sealed up and exhausted ; carbonic acid and potash were used to get a high vacuum .
When the magnet was not magnetized , the passage of the current from wire to wire did not affect the piece of talc .
When the magnet was charged , and the luminous arch was made to play upon the lower portion of the talc , it repelled it , no matter which way the electric current was passing .
When the tube was shifted over the poles of the magnet so as to project the luminous arch against the upper part of the talc , the upper end of the talc was repelled in all instances ; the arch , when projected against the lower part of the talc , being near the magnet , was more concentrated , and the angle of deviation of the talc was as much as 20 ' .
When the upper part of the arch , which was much more diffused , was thrown upon the upper part of the talc , it was repelled about 5 ' .
This experiment , in the author 's opinion , indicates that this arch is composed of attenuated particles of matter projected from the negative pole by electricity in all directions , but that the magnet controls their course ; and 240 Mr. C. F. Varley on the Discharge of Electricity [ Jan. 12 , these particles seem to be thrown by momentum on each side of the negative pole , beyond the limit of the electric current .
This arch requires time for its formation , for when a charged condenser is discharged through the tube no arch is produced .
The arch from the negative pole is a hollow cylinder ; the little talc tell-tale against which the arch was projected cut out the light , and a corresponding dark space existed throughout the remainder of the course of the arch .
There was on the talc , at the spot where the arch struck it , a little bright luminous cloud , as though the attenuated luminous vapour were condensed by this material obstruction .
Great care had been taken not to let the arch strike the single filament of silk which suspended the talc .
Having demonstrated that the talc was repelled as described , the arch was allowed to play against the silk fibre , which the author expected would have been instantly burnt ; such , however , was not the case .
Even when a powerful induction-coil replaced the battery , the fibre remained unhurt .
Comparison of the above Phenomena with Discharges between the Poles of a Holtz 's Machine in air .
In the first part of this paper four different kinds of discharges were described in vacuo .
With a " Holtz 's " machine , which will give 11-inch sparks in the air , four well-marked different kinds of discharge have been obtained in the air ; one of which , the author thinks , will explain the curious and rare phenomenon known as " ball lightning .
" In the experiments hereafter referred to , the condensers were in all cases attached to the " Holtz 's " machine .
The first discharge is the long 11-inch zigzag spark or lightning-flash ; the second is the well-known " brush , " which is best obtained by connecting the negative pole of the " Holtz 's " machine to the earth ; the third kind of discharge is a hissing red flame , i inch in length ; playing about the negative pole , the positive pole being scarcely luminous at all , and if luminous , at one or two points only ; the fourth or most remarkable phenomenon is best obtained in the following manner ( it should be understood that the brass balls on each of the poles are about an inch in diameter ) :\#151 ; Tie to the negative pole a small thin strip or filament of wood , 3 inches in length , and bent so as to project on each side of the negative pole , and a little beyond it towards the positive .
On rotating the machine , two bright spots are seen upon the positive pole .
If the positive pole be made to rotate upon its axis , the luminous spots do not rotate with it ; if , however , the negative pole , with its filament of wood , be rotated , the spots on the positive pole obey it , and rotate also .
The insertion of a non-conductor , such as a strip of glass , in front of the projecting wooden end , obliterates the luminous spot on the positive pole .
When the author first discovered this , he , seeing apparently pieces of dirt on the positive pole , wiped it clean with a silk handkerchief , but there 1871 .

they remained in spite of all wiping ; he then examined the negative pole , and discovered a minute speck of dirt corresponding to the luminous spots on the positive pole .
When the filament of wood is removed from the negative pole , there is sometimes a luminosity or glow over a large portion of the surface of the positive ball .
If in this state three or four little pieces of wax , or even a drop or two of water , be placed upon the negative pole , corresponding non-luminous spots will be found upon the positive pole , which rotate with the former , but do not with the latter .
It is therefore evident that there are lines of force existing between the two poles , and by these means one is able to telegraph from the negative to the positive pole to a distance of 8 inches through the air , without any other conductor than that which the electrical machine has constructed for itself across the non-conducting gas .
The foregoing seems to the author to give a possible explanation of ** ball-lightning .
" If it be possible for there to be a negatively electrified cloud sufficiently charged to produce a flash from the earth to the cloud , a point in the cloud would correspond to the wood projection on the negative conductor : if such a cloud exist , a luminous spot would be seen moving about the surface of the earth , corresponding to the moving point of cloud over it , and thus present phenomena similar to those described by the privileged few who have witnessed this extraordinary natural phenomenon .
The following experiment shows that , prior to the passage of the electric spark , a channel is prepared for this spark to pass .
The positive and negative balls of the machine were separated to a distance of 6 or 7 inches , and a common candle-flame was placed midway between them .
On rotating the machine , the flame was drawn out on each side just prior to the passage of the spark , as shown in the accompanying sketch ( PI .
III .
fig. 3 ) .
Sometimes it extended to a width of 5 or 6 inches ; this took place every time the spark passed .
It is well known that the duration of this spark is less than the iWooo part of a second ; the flame occupied the g or -jJg part of a second in flying out to make the conducting channel through which the discharge went .
The author has been informed more than once , by captains of vessels , that when men have been struck by lightning a burn has been left upon the skin of the same shape as the object from which the discharge flew .
In one instance he was informed that some brass numbers attached to the rigging , from which the discharge passed to the sailor , were imprinted upon his skin .
It is now seen that this is perfectly possible if the discharge be a negative one\#151 ; that is , if the man be+to the brass number .
