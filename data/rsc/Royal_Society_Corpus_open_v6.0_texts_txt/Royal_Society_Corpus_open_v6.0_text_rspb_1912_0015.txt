Note on Astrosclera willeyana Lister .

) As the result of an investigation of 47 specimens of Astrosclera willeyana dredged by me off Christmas Island , Indian Ocean , I have found that this organism is a Siliceous Ectyonine Sponge with a supplementary skeleton of aragonite .
The sponge owes its unique character to the fact of its being associated with a degenerate Floridean Alga .
Sponge cells capture and envelop the algal tetraspores and carpospores and secrete around them concentric layers of aragonite .
The spherules so formed are in many respects comparable with the cyst-pearls of Mollusca .
Just as certain Ectyonine sponges make supplementary skeletons out of foreign particles of sand , Foraminifera , etc. , so Astrosclera builds a similar kind of skeleton out of the spherules .
The alga probably comes under the Ceramiales Oltm .
, and appears to belong to a new genus and species , of which a provisional diagnosis is given below:\#151 ; Bhododiplobia* n. gen .

A fully illustrated account of the very remarkable life-history of Astrosehra-Rhododiplobia will shortly be published , which , I trust , will furnish clear proof as to the accuracy of the statements here made .
The two organisms have become , in all reasonable probability , indispensable to each other and inseparable .
The sponge embryos , before they have left the parent , are associated with plants bearing carpogonia antheridia or stichidia , and even the youngest sponges , barely visible to the naked eye , have solid well-built skeletal walls composed of aragonite spherules each with an algal spore in its centre .
I consider that the association has become one of true symbiosis , and is not merely an instance of parasitism of the alga on the sponge , or vice versa .
