In 1875 , Tar chan off and Puelma* stated , " Si l'on excite longtemps un des pneumogastriques du chien avec des courants forts jusqu'a epuiser completement son action sir le coeur , ce qui se manifest par le retour de ses battements et si l'on pass Vexcitation de Vautre , on n'obtient plus d'arret du cceur , et meme on n'observe au-cune alteration de son activite : et pourtant le nerf excite en dernier lieu n'est alors , on le con9oit , nullement epuise .
" From this experiment they concluded , " que chacun des pneumogastriques met en jeu tout l'appareil moderateur situe dans les parois du cceur ; et qu'une fois cet appareil epuise par I'excitation d'un pneumogastrique , il no peut etre mis en activite par l'excitation de l'autre .
" In 1876 , Tarchanofff published observations on the frog , in which he states that the behaviour of the frog 's heart to vagus-stimulation is quite different , in respect of the mutual influence of the two nerves , from the behaviour of the heart of dogs or rabbits : " J'ai vu alors que si l'on attend pour exciter le second pneumogastrique que le premier ait ete 6puise par l'excitation , l'arret du cceur s'obtient de la fa9on la plus net ; " and he concludes " Que chez les mammi-feres les deux nerfs aboutissent a un appareil moderateur commun , tandis que chez la grenouille chaque nerf aboutit a un appareil independant .
" Between the publication of Tarchanoff and Puelma 's note and the publication of Tarchanoff 's later observations on the frog , the authors of this paper undertook to check Tarchanoff and Puelma 's statement respecting mammals , and to extend the method of experiment to frogs .
In the case of mammals , dogs and rabbits were used .
They were rendered insensible by chloroform or ether , or subcutaneous injections of hydrochlorate of morphia .
Their vagi were exposed in the neck and divided ; and the peripheral ends loosely tied by ligatures .
Arrangements were made to rapidly shunt an induced , interrupted current from a Du Bois-Reymond 's induction coil , from one vagus into the other , the peripheral ends of the nerves being laid over fine platinum electrodes for the purpose .
In all the experiments save one a Daniell cell was used to induce the currents .
A cannula was placed in the femoral artery ( in one case in the carotid artery ) and connected with a kymograph , which wrote upon a moving sheet of paper .
In the case of frogs , the brain , and sometimes the spinal cord , were destroyed by pithing ; a stout glass rod was thrust down the gullet ; * Jean Tarchanoff et G- .

[ Feb. 14 the vagi were exposed and placed each on a pair of fine platinum electrodes ; and preparations were made for shnnting an interrupted current , by means of a commutator , from one nerve into the other , just as in the case of mammals .
Sometimes the heart was watched directly and notes made .
At other times care was taken to register the heart 's rate , the lapse of time and the moments of stimulation .
The heart 's rate was indicated by means of Marey 's du coeur* the time by an electromagnet and Ludwig 's UnterbrecTmngsuhr , and the moments of stimulation by a marking key , each holding a pointed lever against a smoked revolving cylinder .
The general result of the experiments made by the authors of this paper , is the following : In all the animals hitherto examined ( viz. , dogs , rabbits and frogs ) , if one vagus be stimulated powerfully so as at first to arrest , the heart , and if after the heart has recommenced to contract , the current be at once shunted to the other vagus , arrest again occurs : in some cases , however , on again reversing to the vagus first stimulated , no effect is produced .
This result maybe formulated as follows : Stimulation of one vagus never annuls , or even prejudices , the inhibiting powers of the other vagus , unless when the inhibiting apparatus has been recently under stimulation for some time .
It would therefore seem that Tarchanoff , in asserting the mutual prejudicial action of vagus-stimulations in mammals , and denying it in frogs , has missed one half of the truth in the case of the former , and the other half in the case of the latter .
In illustration of their statement of results of experiments , the authors append a reduced kymographic tracing of a dog .
The a.m'mq.l was a young terrier , and the experiment was made in the manner above described .
The arterial cannula leading to the kymograph was introduced into the femoral artery .
The upper line is the tracing of the kymograph , the middle line is the line of no pressure , and the lower line is divided into intervals of five seconds .
The tracing reads from left to right .

It seems to the authors that the generally accepted theory of the connection of the vagus nerves with a common intermediate apparatus is fully competent to cover the facts established by A. B. Meyer , Tarchanoff and Puelma , and themselves .
Each vagus abuts against a common nervous apparatus , through which every inhibitory stimulus must pass to reach the cardiac muscle* It is only necessary to suppose\#151 ; and the supposition , as it will be shown , is not gratuitous\#151 ; that the exhaustibility of the vagi is far greater than that of the common mechanism they lead to , in order to gain a consistent view of the facts .
When one vagus is stimulated with a strong current , the heart , after a. longer or shorter period of diastolic rest , gradually escapes from the inhibitory influence of the stimulus .
This escape must not be supposed to be due to the gradual exhaustion of the whole inhibiting apparatus , but merely to that of the vagus which is stimulated .
The heart escapes , not because its guard is enfeebled , but because the warrant for detention miscarries .
On shunting the current into the other vagus , the intermediate apparatus is at once roused and the heart stopped .
So much greater are the enduring powers of the intermediate apparatus that , even in the mammal , where , presumedly , they are more easily exhausted than in the frog , the intermediate apparatus seems capable of tiring out relay after relay of reinvigorated vagi .
Indeed , it would appear to be next to impossible , by the most careful and judicious alternate stimulation of the vagi , to cause exhaustion of the intermediate apparatus ; for , after stimulating the vagi alternately a few times , the interval during which each vagus can hold the heart in check becomes too brief for the recovery of the resting vagus .
Nevertheless , when this stage has been reached , it is always possible ( in the frog ) at once to stop the heart by applying an induced , interrupted current to the sinus venosus , even if the current so applied be weaker than that passing previously through the vagus nerves .
But , although the authors believe that the intermediate apparatus can , in health , easily wear out the organised attacks of the vagi , particularly in the case of frogs , yet they think it not improbable that , in conditions unfavourable to the restorative processes , the intermediate apparatus may occasionally succumb to successive vagus-stimulations , especially in the case of mammals .
They are , however , convinced that the latter alternative very rarely occurs .
The assumption of such enormous powers of endurance for the intermediate mechanism is not gratuitous .
As long ago as 1869 , A. B. Meyer* pointed out that the heart of the frog could be inhibited # A. B. Meyer , loc. cit. 1878.1 On Intercepting Germinal Matter of the Air .
for hours by carefully applying interrupted currents to the sinus venotms ; and although the authors of this paper , in repeating the experiment , have sometimes failed to inhibit indefinitely\#151 ; as did also Meyer\#151 ; they have always found it possible to stop the heart for very long intervals by stimulating the sinus venosus ; even with weaker currents than had just before sufficed to exhaust simultaneously the inhibiting powers of both vagi .

" On Schulze 's Mode of Intercepting the Germinal Matter of the Air .
" By John Tyndall , F.R.S. , Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Institution .
Received December 17 , 1877 .
In " Poggendorf 's Annalen " for 1886 , Franz Schulze described an experiment which has attained considerable celebrity .
He placed in a flask a mixture of vegetable and animal matters and water ; through the cork of the flask two glass tubes passed air-tight , each being bent at a right angle above the cork .
He boiled the infusion ; and while steam issued from the two glass tubes , he attached to each of them a group of Liebig 's bulbs , one group being filled with solution of caustic potash , and the other with concentrated sulphuric acid .
Applying his mouth on the potash side , he sucked air daily through the sulphuric acid into the flask .
But , though the process was continued from the end of May till the beginning of August , no life appeared .
In this experiment , the germs diffused in the atmosphere are supposed to have been destroyed by the sulphuric acid , and doubtless this was the case .
Other experimenters , however , in repeating the experiment of Schulze , have failed to obtain his results .
The experiments of Dr. Hughes Bennett are a case in point , to which I might add certain failures of my own .
Schulze 's success is , perhaps , in part to be ascribed to the purity of the air in which he worked ; possibly , also , to extreme care in drawing the air into his flask ; or , it may be , that the peculiar disposition of his experiment favoured him .
Within the flask , as shown by his diagram , both his glass tubes terminated immediately under the cork , so that the air , entering by the one tube , was immediately sucked into the other , thus failing to mix completely with the general air of the flask .
At a very moderate rate of transfer , I found , in 1869 , that germs could pass unscathed through caustic potash and sulphuric acid in succession .
To render the experiment secure , the air-bubbles must pass so slowly through the sulphuric acid , that the floating matter , up to the very core of every bubble , must come into contact with the surrounding liquid .
It must , of course , touch the acid before it can be destroyed .
