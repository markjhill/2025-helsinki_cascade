( Received January 29 , \#151 ; Read February 8 , 1912 .
) In a recent paper by Glazebrook , Bousfield , and Smith* some doubt has been cast on the accuracy of my absolute measurements of the specific heat of water by the continuous-flow calorimeter .
It is stated that an error of as much as 6 parts in 10,000 might have occurred in the superheating of the oil-stirred platinum-silver resistances from which the values of the electric heating current were obtained .
On the other hand , it is also stated that this error might have been as small as 2*5 parts in 10,000 .
It was with some surprise that I read this statement , inasmuch as the authors could not have been aware of the rapidity of oil circulation which I used .
It has been shown by Osborne Reynolds and others that the heat loss from a surface immersed in a liquid moving in turbulent motion is directly proportional to the velocity of How .
The degree of superheating of a wire immersed in oil will depend then directly on the rate of circulation .
Fully realising this fact , the resistances which I used were designed by Prof. Callendar and myself to be immersed in oil which could be circulated with great rapidity .
These resistances are described in our papers , f where the illustration shows approximately to scale the relative sizes of the stirrer and resistances .
The paddle was rotated at a high speed by a powerful water motor , and the oil was thrown down with such force that a considerable depression was made in the surface .
The oil , thrown sideways , passed up around the bare wires , which wTere wound loosely on the mica frames .
I do not know by what standard Glazebrook , Bousfield , and Smith decide what is " normal stirring " or " very vigorous stirring,1 " but it was evident to me at once that I must have had much more rapid circulation than anything used by these authors .
In testing the accuracy of my experiments special attention was taken of possible superheating , and tests of stirring were made at the time .
The good agreement of the various determinations of the specific heat , made with such different values for the heating current and flow of water , make * 'Roy .

Superheating in Continuous-flow Calorimetry .
331 it evident that no large superheating error could have existed without being detected .
In spite of this , however , I have thought it worth while to test my resistances for superheating again .
I have accordingly made up a platinum-silver resistance out of wire 0*06 cm .
in diameter , rolled into a Hat ribbon about 2*5 mm. wide and 0*0075 cm .
in thickness .
Four ribbons of this thin metal strip were taken , connected in parallel on an ebonite frame , and immersed in an oil bath with stirrer , the mounting being similar to the specific heat resistances .
These ribbon strips were each approximately 150 cm .
long .
Hence the total cooling surface in contact with the oil was 75 sq .
cm .
per strip , giving a total of 300 sq .
cm .
and a resistance of approximately 1 ohm .
The old mica resistances consisted of two 1-ohm coils in parallel .
For this comparison one coil ( No. 2 ) was disconnected and No. 1 connected in series with the ribbon-strip resistance .
Each of the old coils was made of four wires 100 cm .
long and 0*04 cm .
in diameter .
Hence each wire had a cooling surface of 12*56 sq .
cm .
or a total surface of 50 sq .
cm .
fora resistance of 1 ohm .
Thus it will be seen that the ribbon coil has six times as much cooling surface as coil No. 1 .
The oil in both boxes was circulated at the same speed from the same water motor , and this circulation was the same as that employed during the specific heat measurements .
A steady heating current was passed through the coils and the temperature of the oil maintained steady in both boxes by means of coils of tube through which cold tap water was flowing .
The drops of potential across the coils were compared on our Kelvin-Varley slide potentiometer .
Both readings came very nearly at the same part of the slide .
The errors of this potentiometer have recently been redetermined for me by Mr. A. N. Shaw , M.Sc .
, for his work on the absolute measurements of the Weston cell , and the constancy of the instrument is a matter of great interest and satisfaction.* The galvanometer used was the Broca type , from the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company , with 1000-ohm coils , and gave a sensitiveness from 17 to 40 divisions of scale to one division of the vernier slide .
The comparison could , therefore , be made withi an accuracy of one or two parts in 100,000 with all the heating currents .
The following table gives the value of the ribbon coil calculated by assuming the correctness of coil No. 1 for all heating currents .
The resistance of coil No. 1 was obtained by reference to the resistance temperature chart which was obtained with great care for the specific heat experiments .
* The results of this comparison will be published later .

The calculations made by Glazebrook , Bousfield , and Smith for my coils were for the maximum current used , which was 8 amperes divided between the two .
This gives 4 amperes for each coil , or 1 ampere for each wire conductor .
Since the ribbon resistances have a cooling surface six times as great as the standard we should expect a difference between the two coils of 5 parts in 10,000 were the Teddington method of stirring followed , while according to the Hendon stirring this should have been 2 parts in 10,000 for a heating current of 4 amperes .
With the method of stirring we used the actual difference is seen to be not over 1 part in 10,000 for a development of heat twice as great .
Taking the probable value for a current of 4 amperes the difference is only 5 parts in 100,000 .
Quite apart from the close agreement of the individual observations of the specific heat of water for widely different heating currents , these comparisons justify me in concluding that the error due to superheating in my platinum-silver resistances is certainly not more and probably less than 1 part in 10,000 , and therefore beyond the limits of error of the method of continuous calorimetry .
