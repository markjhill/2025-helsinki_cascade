" On the Connexion between the Winds of the St. Lawrence and the Movements of the Barometer .
" By William Kelly , M.D. , Surgeon R.N. , attached to the Naval Surveying Party on the River St. Lawrence .
Communicated by Captain Beaufort , R.N. , F.R.S. The author adduces a great number of observations which are in opposition to the generally received opinion , that the mercury in the barometer has always a tendency to fall when the wind is strong .
During a period of fifteen years passed in the Gulf and River St. Lawrence , he found that the barometer as frequently rises as falls under the prevalence of a strong wind ; and that the winds often blow with greater force with a rising than with a falling barometer .
He gives a circumstantial account of the progress and course of various gales which fell under his observation during that period , and from which he infers the existence of a steady connexion between the prevailing winds of this region and the movements of the barometer , and enters into an inquiry into the mode in which that instrument is affected by them .
The extensive valley of the St. Lawrence is bounded at its lower part , for a distance of nearly 500 miles , by ranges of hills , rising on each side to a considerable elevation .
Within this space , the ordinary winds follow the course of the river ; and in almost every instance when they approach from windward , the barometer rises with them ; and when , on the other hand , the wind approaches from leeward , the barometer not only falls before the arrival of the wind , but continues to fall until it has subsided .
An appendix is subjoined containing extracts from the tabular register of the barometer and winds at various points in the valley of the River St. Lawrence , during the years 183+ and 1835 , accompanied by remarks on different points deserving notice in particular cases .
