On the Clark Cell as a Standard of Electro-motive Force .
By Lord Rayleigh , Received Jan. 7 , \#151 ; Read Jan. 21 , 1886 .
S 39 .
The importance of a convenient standard of electro-motive force is now fully recognised .
It gives the most available means of measuring currents , especially of large amount , and has been used for this purpose by several experimenters .
I may refer to my investigation on the Constant of Magnetic Rotation of Light in Bisulphide of Carbon , * in which the currents were all measured by reference to a Clark cell , whose value was originally obtained by absolute measurements and verified at intervals by the silver voltameter .
Clark cells are exceedingly convenient in use , and would doubtless be generally employed , could confidence be felt in their permanence , and in the equality of cells set up by different persons from the same recipe .
To these questions I have given much attention ; and the result of a large experience is very favourable to the trustworthiness of the cells , if reasonable precautions be observed in charging them .
I believe that any one who takes the trouble to set up three or four cells and compares them occasionally , will be in possession of a standard of E.M.F. which he may trust to about ToootL part .
The present memoir is to be regarded as supplementary to that on the Electrochemical Equivalent of Silver , and on the Absolute Electro-motive Force of Clark Cells , f and the paragraphs are numbered accordingly .
The total number of cells experimented upon is large .
Of my own construction there have been about 60 of the ordinary kind ( with solid zincs ) , and about 30 of the H-pattern ( S 28 ) with zinc amalgam .
In addition to these some 40 cells made by others have been compared , with very interesting results to be given later .
Before entering into details it may be convenient to summarise the principal sources of error .
The E.M.F. may be too high , ( 1 ) because the paste is acid , ( 2 ) because the paste is not saturated with zinc sulphate .
The first fault tends to cure itself , and is rarely found after the cells are a month old .
The second is the origin of the more serious discrepancies that have been met with in commercial cells .
If the E.M.F. is too low , the cause may be , ( 1 ) that the cell has become dry , in which case the drop will probably be progressive , ( 2 ) the solution is swy\gt ; er-sat mated with zinc sulphate , ( 3 ) the mercury is impure .

Believing that these cells are capable of affording standards of a high degree of precision , and that they ought to be in general use , I have gone into considerable detail as to the procedure which may be adopted .
This may give the impression that the preparation is troublesome , but in reality the method that I propose is much simpler than those hitherto employed and thought to be necessary .
To show how easy it is to set up these cells , I may refer to two large ones , contained in glass cylinders of about 4 inches diameter , and provided with wooden covers by which the electrodes are carried .
Enough common mercury was poured in to cover the bottom contact being made with it by means of a platinum wire sealed in a glass tube .
The jar was then filled to a height of about 4 inches with saturated solution of commercial zinc sulphate with which some mercurous sulphate had been rubbed , up in a mortar .
The zinc electrode was cut from ordinary sheet metal , and was suspended horizontally near the top of the liquid by a projecting tail .
After the first few weeks these large cells have never deviated from the standard by much more than xooo\gt ; and have been found very convenient for certain purposes on account of their comparatively small resistance .
They have also been used for preliminary comparisons with cells whose value was unknown , in which case there was danger of more current passing than is desirable to allow through delicate standards .
S 40 .
The method followed for making the recent comparisons is the same in substance as that described in S 28 .
The use of a high resistance galvanometer gave a greater facility of reading , a change of too ( To the E.M.F. under measurement giving a motion of the spot of light which could be seen without a telescope from across the room .
The accompanying table ( XIII .
) gives the values of most of the older cells in continuation of that contained in the note to S 30 ( p. 459 ) .
Cells ( 4 ) , ( 8 ) , ( 9 ) were , I think , left at Cambridge ; ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) were observed at intervals during 1885 , but the E.M.F. was found to fall .
When about three parts per thousand too low , they were removed for examination , and found to be dry .
The water had exuded , or evaporated , through cracks in the paraffin wax .
The cells of the H-pattern , H6 , H13 were broken in a manner to be presently explained .
On the other hand some new cells of the H-pattern , a , b , . . .
are included .
They are those referred to in the previous paper as having been fitted up by Mr. Threlfall , and are more than a year old .
The agreement exhibited in Table XIII .
is very remarkable .
In many cases the cells may be depended on not to vary relatively more than 2 or 3 parts in 10,000 , notwithstanding considerable changes of temperature .
It is , indeed , doubtful whether even the whole of the small variations recorded are real .
1 0 .
influences the E.M* F. about 8 parts in 10,000 , and differences of temperature of two or three-tenths of a degree may well have occurred , since the cells were variously mounted , and no particular precautions were taken beyond the avoidance of readings at times when the temperature of the room ( immediately under the roof ) was changing rapidly .

S 41 .
In cells of the ordinary type the principal source of weakness is imperfect sealing at the top , due to cracks in the paraffin wax .
As pointed out by Dr. Alder Wright , * a better result is obtained if the whole cell be imbedded in a large mass of wax than when* ( as in my cells ) the wax is applied merely inside the tube , above the cork sustaining the zinc .
During the last year I have replaced paraffin by marine glue , which , so far as can be judged at present , may be relied upon to effect a complete seal .
The procedure will be described presently more in detail .
The cause of failure in the H-cells is of a different nature .
Many of the earlier cells had been found to break in the amalgam leg , and the trouble was attributed to a hardening and expansion of the contents ( S 29 ) .
Such a hardening had , in fact , been observed in one or two cases .
More recent experience , however , has proved that the cause must be looked for elsewhere , several cells having failed in which no trace of solid amalgam was to be found .
Nevertheless the amalgam is the cause of the trouble , for out of a large number of breakages one has occurred in the leg containing pure mercury .
It would appear that some alloying takes place with the platinum wire in contact with the amalgam , and that this gradually extends itself with fatal results to the part of the platinum sealed into the glass , from which place the cracks are always observed to radiate .
It is hoped that a cure will be found in a plan , adopted for some recent cells , of melting in a little cement ( marine glue has been used ) so as to protect from the amalgam the part of the platinum which lies nearest to the glass ; but it is too soon to speak with certainty .
S 42 .
The H-form lends itself to hermetical sealing , and at one time I anticipated advantage from this course .
There is , however , such a large amount of spare liquid that there is no likelihood of trouble from desiccation , even if the corks allow a little evaporation .
Indeed , by withdrawing the corks a fresh supply of liquid could be introduced at any time .
It happened on one occasion that an H-cell to which a large excess of salt had been added , was so far crusted up next the metallic surfaces that it began to show signs of failing E.M.E. , much as if it were going dry .
The mass was so compact that no impression could be made upon it with a glass rod ; but it was bored through with a steel reamer , when the E.M.F. at once recovered its normal value .
In such cases the accessibility is advantageous , especially for purposes of experiment .
It is well , however , to avoid such a large excess of salt as was present in this case .
By alternate melting and crystallisation as the temperature rises and falls , there is a tendency to aggregation , of which the cell above referred to affords an extreme example .
In the construction of cells with solid zinc electrodes , I have fallen back upon a simplified pattern\#151 ; nothing more in fact than a small tube with a platinum wire sealed through its closed end .
See figure .
* Phil. Mag. , July , 1883 , p. 32 .
A STANDARD OF ELECTRO-MOTIVE FORCE .
The only objection to this form is that the cells cannot , without precaution , be supported from underneath .
Most of mine are held at the centre by a spring ( cut from sheet metal ) against a piece of board mounted on its edge .
In this case the copper electrodes are secured in sealing-wax to the wooden stand .
For single cells , when portability is desired and convenience of immersion in water or ice , it is a good plan to enclose the whole in a rather long and narrow test-tube .
A little cotton wool supports the cell and prevents it from shaking about laterally .
The gutta-percha covered leads pass through a piece of cork inserted near the top of the test-tube , and a little marine glue poured over the cork makes all tight .
In order to give mechanical support to the platinum wire , which is liable to break where it passes through the glass , the external application of sealing-wax is recommended\#151 ; a precaution applicable also to the H-cells .

In charging the cells the first step is to pour in sufficient pure ^ mercury to cover the platinum effectively .
The paste ( of which more presently ) is next introduced , with the aid of a small funnel , care being taken not to soil the sides above the proper level .
The zincs , cut from rods of pure zinc , as supplied by Hopkins and Williams , and not recast , are soldered to copper wires and cleaned in the lathe .
Just before use they are dipped in dilute sulphuric acid , washed in distilled water , and dried with a clean cloth or filter paper .
Each zinc is mounted in a short piece of cork fitting the tube ( but not too tightly ) , and nicked in order to allow of the passage of air .
The cork is pushed gradually down until its lower face is almost in contact * Except when the contrary is stated , mercury distilled in vacuo has been used for Clabk cells .
There is , I believe , a difficulty in purchasing mercury thus treated ; but every physical laboratory should be provided with an apparatus for this purpose .
That employed by me was distilled at Cambridge in an apparatus set up by Mr. W. N. Shaw .
with the paste .
The object is to leave but little air , and at the same time to avoid squeezing up the paste between the cork and the glass .
The whole is now made tight by pouring marine glue over the cork high enough to cover the zinc and soldering , and leave only the wire projecting .
The tube should rise high enough to receive the glue , and thus secure a good adhesion .
The marine glue is melted over the gas flame in a small pot or basin , and stirred , until uniform , with a small stick .
It should be fluid enough to pour by its own weight .
If necessary , a little benzole may be added , but the cement should be pretty hard when cold .
In the operation of pouring in the marine glue the glass is heated by the glue sufficiently for adhesion ; but this heat does not extend appreciably below the cork .
Neither in this , nor any other stage of the process of charging , is heat applied to the paste .
S 44 .
The earlier cells , prepared with paste , which was doubtless strongly acid , frequently gave irregular results for several weeks .
Extreme cases are afforded by 15 and 16 , which are shown by Table VIII .
of the former paper to have been at first more than 2 per cent , too strong .
Moreover , as appears from the continuation of this table in the notes ( p. 459 ) , it took nearly two months for these cells to settle down to their normal values .
The cause of irregularity is to be sought rather at the mercury than at the zinc ( or amalgam ) electrode .
In order to examine this question , H-cells were charged with pure mercury and paste in both legs , and filled up as usual with saturated zinc sulphate solution .
There should , of course , have been no E.M.F. ; but the value of one of the cells was '0041 Clark , and remained tolerably constant for several days .
By stirring with a glass rod , the E.M.F. could be either increased or diminished .
After some weeks the cells had come sensibly to zero , and would bear stirring ( in one or both legs ) without much disturbance .
To another cell , which still showed irregularity , zinc carbonate was added .
The E.M.F. was much reduced , and in a few days was scarcely sensible even on stirring .
When the paste is neutralised in the first instance with zinc carbonate , the irregularities are much reduced .
Two cells thus prepared had an E.M.F. less than *0001 Clark , and were scarcely affected by stirring .
On Jan. 27 , 1885 , a piece of zinc wire was poked through the paste , so as momentarily to touch the mercury in one leg of one of these cells .
A large E.M.F. was thus developed , which remained operative for half-an-hour or more ; but on Jan. 28 the E.M.F. was only *0003 Clark , and on Jan. 31 *0002 Clark .
It is clear that the mercurous sulphate has the property of freeing the mercury from the smallest contamination with zinc .
S 45 .
In consequence of these observations more recent cells have been prepared with neutralised paste .
This course has the advantage that the cells attain their normal values in a few days , sometimes within one day , of charging .
So far as I can judge , however , there is no difference in the ultimate value whether the paste be acid ^ A STANDARD OP ELECTRO-MOTIVE FORCE .
787 or neutral .
In the former case the cell probably neutralises itself by dissolution of zinc , a certain amount of gas being liberated .
It is convenient to keep a stock bottle of saturated solution of zinc sulphate .
This may be prepared in a flask by mixing distilled water with about twice its weight of crystals .
A little carbonate of zinc is added to neutralise free acid , and solution is effected with the aid of gentle heat .
If time can be afforded , it is a good plan to let the solution stand , as a good deal of iron is usually deposited , even when " pure " zinc sulphate is used .
The solution may then be filtered in a warm place into the stock bottle .
When it is intended to charge H-cells , or prepare paste , the bottle should be exposed to a gentle warmth for a few hours , and the solution should be drawn with a pipette from near the crystals at the bottom of the bottle .
Otherwise there is no security that the liquid used will be saturated .
To prepare paste we may rub up together in a mortar 150 grms. mercurous sulphate ( as purchased ) , 5 grms. zinc carbonate , and as much of the saturated zinc sulphate solution as is required to make a thick paste.* Carbonic anhydride is liberated , and must be allowed a sufficient time to separate .
I have found it convenient to leave the paste in the mortar for two or three days , rubbing it up at intervals with additions of zinc sulphate solution until the gas has escaped .
By the addition of a small crystal , and by evaporation , we have security that the paste is saturated , and will remain so , notwithstanding such moderate elevation of temperature as the cells are expected to bear .
The paste may then be transferred to a tightly-corked bottle , and , so far as my experience extends , will remain available for many months at least .
Before pouring , the bottle of paste should be well shaken up .
The performance of the newer cells has been satisfactory ( one irregularity will be mentioned later ) , and the substitution of marine glue for paraffin wax promises a longer life .
A large number of observations have been recorded , but it does not appear necessary to give them here in detail .
S 46 .
I have been anxious to compare with my cells some prepared by others , and have to thank many physicists for the opportunity of doing so .
Dr. Alder Wright was good enough to send me several of his cells , with which comparisons of especial value have been made .
I shall have occasion to remark more at length upon the results obtained with these cells , and for the moment will only say that the difference between them and mine is under x^oo^ Part- Cells prepared by Mr. Threlfall ( not those previously mentioned ) , by Dr. Fleming , and by Prof. G. Forbes also agreed well .
Dr. Fleming 's cells , of which six remained in my hands , were at first irregular , and even now show somewhat larger variations than the best cells are liable to .
The cause is , I believe , to be found in insufficient purity of mercury , as is suggested by * It is usually found that on neutralisation the mercurous sulphate turns yellow , so that the paste presents ultimately somewhat the appearance of mustard .
I do not know whether the change of colour is normal , or is to he attributed to impurity .
the appearance of the metallic surface .
When the mercury is quite pure , the surface is as bright as in a thermometer bulb .
I have instituted special experiments in order to ascertain the effects of impure mercury .
On two occasions three cells have been charged alike in all respects , except ' that in the first vacuum-distilled mercury was employed , in the second ordinary mercury , and in the third mercury purposely contaminated with tin-foil ( probably containing also lead ) .
The results were not very distinct ; but they indicate that impurity in .the mercury is apt to depress the E.M.F. ( e.g. by -J per cent. ) , and especially to make it irregular .
I am disposed to attach great importance to purity of mercury , and believe it to be more essential than purity of zinc , * although I should not recommend the use of common zinc when the purer metal can be obtained so easily .
Other cells have been prepared with mercury to which a little silver and copper ( filings from a silver coin ) were added .
After the first week or two the E.M.F. of these cells was normal ( to within ToJoo'th part ) .
It is probable that metals more oxidisable than mercury are removed from it by the paste , as certainly happens in the case of zinc .
S 47 .
It has been abundantly proved by v. Helmholtz , Alder Wright and other workers , that the E.M.F. of Clark 's , Daniell 's , and similar cells , rises as the zinc sulphate solution is diluted .
In some such cells to be discussed presently ( 39 , 40 ) , the E.M.F. is about 1^ per cent , higher than for a normal Clark .
Dr. Hopkinson , some of whose cells have been compared with mine , writes that he is pretty clear that the worst irregularities of Clark 's cells are due to the zinc sulphate not being saturated .
A cell 2 per cent , in excess could be made right by simply introducing crystals of ZnSO^ .
It is evident that sufficient care has not been taken in this respect in the preparation of cells sold to the public .
S 48 .
In this matter of saturation there is another danger to be encountered , to which my attention was first drawn in connexion with some cells prepared with great care by Mr. Mortimer Evans , and left in my charge by Sir W. Thomson .
Of these , two were in practical agreement with mine ; but the other eight , though in close agreement with one another , were too low ( according to my standard ) by rather more than four parts per thousand .
And this state of things persisted without the smallest change for two or three months , during which tests were applied at intervals .
Being anxious to examine a phenomenon to which my experience had afforded no parallel , I opened carefully one of the abnormal cells ( T2 ) to the extent of withdrawing the zinc .
My idea was that possibly the zinc solution was supersaturated , in which case the E.M.F. might be expected to be too low .
Attached to the zinc , however , were found what appeared to be crystals of sulphate ; but in order to be on the safe side , a few particles from the stock bottle were added to the cell , and the zinc was replaced .
After the lapse of a few hours the E.M.F. was tested , and was found to be normal , as it has remained ever since .
* Of ten cells , prepared at the same time as a set to be used in series , five were made with pure zmO and five with common sheet zinc .
No difference in the performance can be detected .
A STANDARD OF ELECTRO-MOTIVE FORCE .
There was now little doubt but that the solution had been supersaturated , in the sense with which we are concerned .
The presence of crystals is no evidence to the contrary , unless it can be proved that the crystals were those of the , hcptahydrated salt .
At this stage I wrote to Mr. M Evans to inquire whether there was anything in the history of the cells that would account for the separation into two classes , and I was informed that all the cells had been prepared originally in the same manner .
The mercury was twice distilled in vacuo , and in other respects the greatest care had been taken .
When , however , the cells came to be tested , it was found that owing to contraction all but two were wanting in proper contact between the mercury and platinum , and that this contact could only be restored by remelting over a water-bath the whole of the paraffin wax in which the cells were imbedded .
It was by this operation , no doubt , that the solution became supersaturated .
The agreement with mine of the two cells which were not heated ( one of them ( Ts ) is referred to later ) is very satisfactory as showing that the great precautions exercised by Mr. Evans lead to the same E.M.F. as I have obtained with far less trouble .
I may add that a second abnormal cell ( T8 ) moved to equality with my standards on being opened .
: S 49 .
With a view to the better understanding of this matter I made myself acquainted with the beautiful researches of M. Gernez # upon supersaturation , conducted principally with solutions of sulphate and of acetate of soda ; and have performed parallel experiments upon sulphate of zinc .
A very strong solution of this salt prepared hot , and sealed up in a glass tube , will sometimes cool without any deposit .
More often it .
throws down an abnormal ( lower ) hydrate .
If in this condition the tube be heated pretty rapidly in boiling water , some of the salt dehydrates further to a powder ( presumably mono-hydrated ) ; if it be allowed to cool again the inferior crystalline hydrate reforms .
However long the solution stands cold over this hydrate , it is still supersaturated as regards the normal hydrate , the minutest addition of which causes the supernatant liquid to become almost solid , with needles penetrating it in all directions .
The experiment has been repeated many times with less strong solutions standing in open test-tubes , charged and preserved with the simple precautions indicated by M. Gernez .
It is evident that " supersaturation " is a term without definite meaning until further explained .
Gernez has shown that a solution may be supersaturated with respect to one or both of two different hydrates , i.e , will crystallise similarly on contact with the smallest fragment , and not supersaturated ( it all with respect to the anhydrous salt , the addition of which causes no effect .
De CopPETt has proved that the so-called supersaturated solution may be disposed to take up a further portion of anhydrous salt ; as may , indeed , be inferred from previously known facts , since * * " Annals de l'ecole nonnale , " t. iii .
, 1866 , p. 163 ; t. v. , 1876 , ' p. 1 .
t C.R. LXXIII .
, p. 1324 , 1871 .
See also Nicor , , Phil. Mag. , June , 1885 .
in general the anhydrous salt must tend either to leave or to enter the solution , and the former alternative is excluded by the observed behaviour on first contact .
S 50 .
In view of the above facts we can hardly doubt that a Clark cell , heated nearly to the temperature of boiling water and then cooled , would be likely to become supersaturated ; but I thought it would be satisfactory actually to try the experiment .
A normal cell of my own preparation and containing an excess of undissolved salt , was maintained for several hours at an elevated temperature , and tested after cooling .
A temperature of 38 ' C. did not permanently alter the cell ; neither did a temperature of 49 ' , nor one of 60 ' .
But after an exposure to about 80 ' a permanent change set in .
Immediately after cooling the value in terms of the standards was *9914 , but after one day 's standing it settled to '9943 , close to which value it has since remained .
It appears from the above that the cell probably requires to be heated sufficiently to decompose the normal hydrate , and not merely to bring all the immersed salt into solution .
In the latter case there may well be solid particles within reach , which re-determine normal crystallisation on cooling .
A second experiment was tried with an old cell ( of Table XIII .
) which contained a large excess of undissolved salt .
This was of the H-pattern , which lends itself more conveniently to observation and experiment .
On November 13 the cell was heated for several hours nearly to 100 ' C. After cooling a solid mass of crystals was to be seen over the metals in both legs , and it might have been supposed that the operation had been unsuccessful .
On November 16 , however , the E.M.F. was found to have changed ( from about 1*0005 ) to *9949 , at which value it remained until November 25 .
On that day , at 5h p.m. the corks were drawn .
At 6h no effect had been produced , and a fragment of the normal hydrate was dropped into each leg .
At 6h 45m new crystals had formed , and the E.M.F. had risen to *9996 .
A few hours later the E.M.F. was 1*0000 , at which value it has since remained within 2 or 3 parts in 10,000 .
It was remarked that the crystalline deposit on contact with the normal hydrate was much less in amount than had been met with in experimental tubes with simple zinc sulphate .
The explanation is probably that during the heating no complete diffusion of the salt was effected , so that after cooling supersaturation was limited to the lower layers .
Both metals being at the bottom in this form of cell , the E.M.F. is independent of the condition of the upper parts .
It is worthy of note that all the " supersaturated " cells which I have tested are about 5 parts per 1000 too low .
That they should give a definite E.M.F. is to be expected whenever the lower hydrate is formed .
For the solution in contact with the lower hydrate is just as definite in composition as when it is in contact with the normal hydrate .
It is , however , possible to have " supersaturated solutions without formation of the lower hydrate , and then the E.M.F. would be indefinite .
Thi deficiency may certainly be less than the 5 parts per 1000 , and may probably be .
more in certain cases .
J S 51 .
In view of the possibility of error from under and over-saturation , the lea er A STANDARD OF ELECTRO-MOTIVE FORCE .
may be inclined to ask whether it would not be better to prescribe a dilute solution for standard cells , as is conveniently done for standard Daniell 's .
One advantage attending this construction is ( as will presently appear ) a lower temperature coefficient .
Again , we should be inclined to expect a more definite dependence upon temperature .
In order to bring a saturated cell to its normal condition after warming ( for example ) , it is necessary not merely that the whole of the contents should acquire the new temperature , but also that sufficient time should be allowed for diffusion .
If the solution in contact with the zinc be weaker than corresponds to saturation at the altered temperature , the full loss of E.M.F. will not be experienced .
In this respect the H-cells , in which the excess of salt rests upon the metals , would seem to have an advantage .
But I cannot say that in practice I have met with the defect due to imperfect diffusion .
Cells which have stood at 10 ' or 12 ' seem to acquire their new values after an hour or two 's immersion in ice .
The argument weighs , however , in favour of small cells , through which diffusion of temperature and matter can take place quickly .
Such experience as I have had of cells prepared with dilute solutions , would not lead me to prefer them , even were there no difficulty in , or necessity for , a standardising .
In the case of clear solutions , such as are used for Daniell 's , the specific gravity is a convenient test of strength ; but I do not see how a standard unsaturated paste could be accurately prepared without a good deal of trouble .
Another objection to dilute solutions is the progressive alteration of E.M.F. , due to evaporation , which must take place whenever the sealing is at all imperfect .
* In truth , there is no real difficulty in avoiding both under and over-saturation , if the experimenter will bear in mind the known properties of the materials with which he is dealing .
The grosser errors , arising from the first cause , can only occur as the result of carelessness .
As to the latter , it may be that supersaturation has sometimes entered as a consequence of excessive precautions against the admission of air .
It cannot occur in the presence of the minutest .fragment of the normal hydrate .
Opinions may perhaps differ upon this point , but I am myself disposed to condemn the use of heat in charging the cells .
If hot paste be brought into contact with hot mercury , and then closed hermetically , there must be some risk of supersaturation .
S 52 .
The next question which I propose to consider is that of the temperature-coefficients of Clark cells .
My observations on cell No. 1 at Cambridge , S 36 , gave for the proportional fall of E.M.F. per degree Centigrade in the neighbourhood of 15 ' the number *00082 , so that at t ' C. we might take E= 1*435(1 \#151 ; *00082(2\#151 ; 15 ) } .
This number is in agreement with that found by Helmholtz for saturated cells , but it differs seriously from the number ( *00041 ) given by Alder Wright !

saturated cells .
These discrepancies have naturally led to the conclusion that the temperature-variations of Clark cells are uncertain , and Dr. Fleming has insisted upon the advantage in this respect possessed by the Dantell !
* If indeed it were a matter of chance whether the temperature-coefficient of a Clark were *0008 , or '0004 , the utility of these cells as standards for delicate work would be seriously impaired .
A glance , however , at Table XIII.+ will show that such uncertainty need not exist .
The results of March 2 and June 4 correspond to a difference of 19 ' F. , or about 11 ' C. , so that if one cell had the coefficient *0008 , and another the coefficient *0004 , the change of temperature would separate them to the extent of 44 parts in 10,000 , whereas the greatest change observed ( perhaps not due to this cause at all ) is but 5 parts .
Many observations on recent cells , made in ordinary course , point in the same direction .
In one or two cases there has been an apparent rise at temperatures above 65 ' F. , indicating a drop in the temperature-coefficient relatively to that of No. 1 .
I have attributed this to an insufficient excess of undissolved salt in cells prepared when the weather was cold , the result of course being a failure of saturation at high temperatures , attended ( as will presently appear ) by a fall of temperature-coefficient .
Being desirous of clearing up , as far as possible , any questions connected with the practical use of these cells as standards , I determined to supplement the former observations with special experiments at somewhat extreme temperatures , which should include as great a variety of constructions as possible .
Most of the cells were so mounted that they could not well be tried at temperatures differing from that of the surrounding air , and I had to content myself with varying the temperature of the room by opening windows and burning gas .
Care was taken that no great variation occurred within two or three hours of the comparisons .
Under these circumstances tests were made of ( 1 ) , ( 10 ) ( Table XIII .
) ; Tx ( one of the abnormal cells of Mr. M. Evans ' ) , T3 ( a normal cell of the same batch ) ; W31 , W59 , W63\#151 ; three cells by Dr. Alder Wright ; M183 , a cell sold by Messrs. Clark and Muirhead , \#151 ; at temperatures from 47 ' F. to 69 ' F. These cells were all supposed to be saturated .
There were also two prepared purposely with diluted paste\#151 ; ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) .
Besides these , two saturated cells of my own construction mounted in test tubes , which could be immersed in water or ice , were tested from 32 ' F. to 67^ ' F. In order to obtain an absolute result we must have command of a standard independent of temperature-variations .
At Cambridge I employed for this purpose a cell kept constantly in ice .
The present observations were rather protracted , and I preferred to rely upon two cells ( 35 ) , ( 38 ) , mounted in test tubes and imbedded with a thermometer in a mass of sand , itself situated in an underground recess .
The variations of temperature were here very small and readily determined , so that there * On the " Use of Daniell 's Cell as a Standard of Electro-motive Force , Phil. Mag. , Aug. , 1,85 .

was no practical uncertainty on this account .
The variation of the two cells relatively to one another was less than Too66 during the whole month of observation .

From the results in Table XIV .
, reduced to No. 1 as standard , the reader will see that there is no distinct difference of coefficient .
It is interesting to note that Tx ( which there is every reason to consider supersaturated ) keeps its distance from No. 1 .
When I first thought of supersaturation , I regarded this agreement of temperature-coefficient as an argument on the other side , not at that time recognising the probable occurrence of the lower hydrate .
But what will still more arrest attention is the agreement of Dr. Alder Wright 's cells with No. 1 .
There are same irregularities , possibly dependent upon imperfect penetration of temperature through the masses of paraffin in which the cells are imbedded ; but there is no distinct evidence of a lower coefficient , and certainly no such difference as that between *0008 per degree Cent , and '0004 .
The same may be said of M183 , which I received from Dr. Alder Wright .
S 53 .
The absolute variations with temperature of ( l ) , ( 10 ) , ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) are shown in Table XV .
, in which all the electro-motive forces are expressed in terms of ( 38 ) at 51 ' F. , a small correction being introduced to allow for the 1 ' or 2 ' , by which the actual temperature of ( 38 ) , ( 35 ) , may have differed from 51 ' .
The coefficients for ( 1 ) and ( 10 ) are almost identical .
The observed values for ( 1 ) agree pretty well with the formula .9970{1 \#151 ; '000425^\#151 ; 57 ) } , as will be seen from the adjoining column calculated therefrom .
This is in Fahrenheit degrees .
The corresponding formula in Centigrade degrees is *9970(1 \#151 ; '000765(2 \#151 ; 13'9 ) } .
It appears , therefore , that the temperature-coefficient for these cells , including those of Dr. Alder Wright , is '00077 , and that the observed values are utterly irreconcilable with such a coefficient as *0004 .

.9922 .9924 67* 99 7 .9925 .9924 For ( 39 ) and ( 40 ) , prepared with unsaturated solution , the temperature-coefficient is exactly the half o"f that for the saturated cells .
Reckoned in Fahrenheit degrees , it is *00021 , or in Centigrade degrees *00038 .
The agreement with this value is shown by the column calculated from the formula 1*0134(1 \#151 ; *000212(^ \#151 ; 57 ) } .
A STANDARD OF ELECTRO-MOTIVE FORCE .
The coefficient *00038 is so close to that given by Alder Wright , viz. , *00041 , that one cannot help suspecting that the cells used by him for this purpose may have been unsaturated , or possibly supersaturated ( without deposit of lower hydrate ) .
Over the above range of temperature a linear expression represents the E.M.F. sufficiently well .
When , however , the values recorded for ( 36 ) , and ( 37 ) for temperatures from 32 F. to 67^ F. were plotted , a distinct curvature was apparent indicating a lower coefficient at the lower temperatures .
Table XVI .
exhibits the observed values , and ( for comparison with them ) numbers calculated from quadratic expressions .
For ( 37 ) the expression is *9985{1 \#151 ; *00037(2 \#151 ; 52i ) \#151 ; *0000025(* \#151 ; 52i)2 } .
the equivalent of which in Centigrade degrees is *9985 { 1 \#151 ; 000666(2\#151 ; 11*4 ) \#151 ; *0000081(2\#151 ; 11*4)2 } .
According to this , the change for one degree Cent , is the following linear function of temperature *0006744*'0000162(\#163 ; \#151 ; 11*4 ) ; so that the temperature-coefficient ranges from *000489 at 0 ' C. to *000813 at 20 ' C. At 15 ' C. it would be *00073 .
For the other cell ( 36 ) the observed values of E.M.F. are pretty well represented by *9991 { 1 \#151 ; *00042(2 \#151 ; 53 ) \#151 ; *0000028(2 \#151 ; 53)2 } , from which are deduced the numbers in the column headed ''calculated .
" In Centigrade degrees this becomes *9991 { 1 \#151 ; *000756(2\#151 ; 11*6 ) \#151 ; *0000091(2\#151 ; 11 *6)2 } ; giving for the temperature-coefficient at 2 ' Cent. .000765+ *000018(2\#151 ; 11*6 ) .
At 15 ' the value from this formula is *00083 .
It would seem that these two cells have temperature-coefficients which differ sensibly .
But this way of presenting the matter is apt to give an exaggerated impression .
The difference in the coefficients indicates a separation of electromotive forces at the rate of y o o o o 'my per degree Cent. , so that the whole relative change for ordinary indoor variations would not exceed t q00 of the whole .
It will be seen from Tables XIV .
, XV .
that , through a more limited range of temperature , a large number of various cells are satisfactorily represented by the coefficient ( intermediate between those just found ) *00077 ; and I believe that the adoption of this number* for cells with saturated solutions can lead to no appreciable error in ordinary use .
For * It should be mentioned that ( loc. cit. ) Dr. Fleming found for a Clark cell the coefficient '00082 at 15 ' C. 79$ LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE CLARK CELL AS very special purposes it will , no doubt , be desirable to protect standard cells from the larger temperature-variations , which is very easily done by keeping them in a cellar , from which well-insulated wires will convey the E.M.F. to any desired point .
As to the absolute magnitude of the variations of E.M.F. with temperature , it may be worth while to recall that they are about the double of those experienced by German silver resistances .
S 54 .
A good many special experiments have been tried with cells variously constructed , in order to elucidate as far as possible the behaviour of Clark 's .
Two of these , labelled H ( 1 , \#163 ; ) , H ( 1 , \#163 ; ) , were referred to in a short communication to the British Association at Montreal , * and have been observed at intervals since , with results which are , I think , of interest .
In these cells , the legs representing the zincs were charged with a strongt but fluid amalgam of zinc and mercury ; so that if the other legs had been charged with pure mercury and paste of mercurous sulphate , an ordinary Clark would have resulted .
This , however , was not done .
No paste at all was used , and in place of pure mercury a dilute amalgam was substituted\#151 ; in H ( 1 , one obtained by diluting the strong amalgam with its own volume of pure mercury , and in H ( 1 , \#163 ; ) one containing one volume of strong amalgam to three volumes of pure mercury .
/ The cells were filled up , as usual , with zinc sulphate solution .
The electromotive forces , expressed as fractions of No. 1 , are recorded in the adjoining table ( XVII .
) .
It is clear that the E.M.F. rises rapidly with temperature\#151 ; something like 30 per cent , for 15 ' F. The large amount of this variation , and the fact of its taking place in the opposite direction to that followed by Clark 's , are very remarkable .

..V .0037 .0089 It would appear that , apart from changes of temperature , the cells have retained their E.M.F. tolerably constant for more than a year and a half\#151 ; a result which could * B. A. Rep. , 1884 , p. 651 .
t As to what is to be regarded as strong , more facts will presently be given .
A STANDARD OF ELECTRO-MOTIYE FORCE .
scarcely have been expected , in view of the very small quantities of zinc which they contain .
If we diminish still further the proportion of zinc in the weaker amalgam , the E.M.F. increases ; until , if we omit the zinc altogether , the E.M.F. may reach *8 or *9 Clark .
In this case , however , the E.M.F. is very unsteady .
On Feb. 18 , 1885 , a cell ( F ) of the H-pattern was charged with pure mercury in one leg , and in the other with an amalgam containing one milligram of zinc dissolved in 30 grams of mercury .
No paste being used , the cell was filled up with saturated zinc sulphate solution .
Under these conditions the E.M.F. was unsteady\#151 ; about *7 .
On Feb. 23 some paste was added to the leg containing pure mercury , on which the E.M.F. became steady at *939 Clark , even when the amalgam was stirred with a glass rod .
On Feb. 28 , E.M.F. = '935 ; on March 2 , *931 ; on March 6 , *920 ; on April 12 , *068 ; and on Dec. 2 , *0003 .
Another cell ( G ) charged with pure mercury and paste in one leg had no zinc added to the pure mercury in the other leg , except such as it received by the passage for 3m of the current from two large Clarks , in whose circuit 1000 ohms of wire-resistance was also included Under these circumstances , the deposited zinc should have been about yq mg .
The resulting E.M.F. was *923 , falling off from day to day , as in the case of ( F ) .
Nine months afterwards the value was *0003 .
From these and other experiments it appeared that an astonishingly minute proportion of zinc in the amalgam was sufficient to give the cell most of the force of a Clark .
I had contemplated examining in greater detail the electromotive character of weak amalgams of known composition , when my attention was called by Prof. Ayrton to an interesting investigation by Messrs. Hockin and Taylor , * covering the same ground .
In their cells zinc was opposed to the various amalgams ; so that the circumstances were really the same as in the case of H ( 1 , ^ ) , H ( 1 , ^ ) , above discussed , the strong amalgam being equivalent to zinc .
A few of their numbers may here be quoted .
When the zinc was opposed to pure mercury , E.M.F. = 1*186 volt .
( According to my experience this should have been uncertain .
) The mercury being replaced by amalgams , the E.M.F. observed were as follows:\#151 ; Zinc 1 part , mercury 23,600,000 parts Volts . . . .

" Mercury alloyed with any number of metals takes the place in the scale of E.M.F. of the most electro-positive metal it may contain , if the amount of the electro-positive metal present is not less than about toooooo in weight of the mercury .
" S 55 .
In order to obtain any stability of E.M.F. in these cells , it seems to be necessary that the mercury should either be alloyed with a sensible , though perhaps relatively very small , portion of zinc , or else protected with mercurous sulphate .
With pure mercury without paste not only is the E.M.F. variable from hour to hour , but it can scarcely be said to be definite even at a particular time\#151 ; that is , it may be altered by the passage of a very small quantity of electricity , such as should have no effect whatever upon a properly constituted cell .
Sometimes when the galvanometer contact was made , a throw of the needle was observed , not followed by any corresponding permanent deflection , the cell in fact behaving like a charged condenser .
In the absence of paste a very small addition of zinc to mercury gives it a definite and tolerably permanent character .
If , however , there be any mercurous sulphate , even though originally in another leg of an H-cell , the mercury is gradually repurified .
To this cause is to be attributed the gradual fall to zero of the E.M.F. of the cells ( F ) and ( G ) above considered .
Indeed , the whole tendency of these observations is to suggest that the action of the mercurous sulphate may be secondary , rather than primary ; so that if zinc could be opposed to really pure mercury , no mercurous sulphate would be needed in a Clark cell .
It may be , however , that in that case a minute quantity of mercurous sulphate would form itself spontaneously .
In such cells as H ( 1 , 2 ) we are compelled to suppose that the chemical origin of the E.M.F. is the tendency of zinc and mercury to combine , or rather the tendency of two different amalgams to equalise themselves .
There is here a close parallelism to the electromotive forces due to affinity of saline solutions of different strengths , manifested , for example , when an electrode of zinc is in contact with a strong solution of zinc sulphate , and the second similar electrode is in contact with a weak solution .
Before quitting this subject , I may mention observations on what was practically a Clark cell , although prepared without zinc and without paste .
On March 7 , 1885 , an H-cell ( J ) was charged with pure mercury in both legs , and filled up with zinc sulphate solution .
A current from an external source of about ^oU amphre was then passed through it for 3^ hours .

It will be seen that a tolerable approximation to a Clark was obtained by this simple process .
Zinc is thrown down upon the mercury in one leg , and mercury dissolved in the other by the passage of the current .

The comparisons recorded in Table XIII .
furnish abundant proof that there has been no special change in the E.M.F. of No. 1 , but do not of themselves exclude the possibility of a general movement of the cells in one direction as the result of age , by which the relative values of cells of nearly the same date might remain unaffected .
Comparisons with younger cells , indeed , go a long way towards negativing this supposition ; but considering that all the older cells had undergone a journey ( from Cambridge to Terling ) , I thought that a re-determination of the absolute E.M.F. , by means of silver , would be a valuable confirmation of their constancy .
With the assistance of Mrs. Sedgwick , two such silver determinations were effected in August , 1885 , as described in S 38 .
Reduced to 15 ' , the E.M.F. of No. 1 was found on August 15 to be 1*4541 B.A. volts , and on August 19 , 1*4533 , giving as a mean 1*4537 B.A. volts .
The value found from absolute measurements in the autumn of 1883 , and the spring of 1884 , was 1*4542 ( S 36 ) .
That given ( note to S 37 ) as the result of two experiments in Nov. , 1884 , is 1*4534 ; but a slight error has been discovered in the reductions leading to the latter number .
By an oversight the factor 1*00041 , necessary to correct for the slight heating of the resistance by the passage of the current ( S 33 ) , was omitted , the effect of which omission is an under-estimate of the difference of potentials at the terminals of the resistance traversed by a known current , and consequently of the E.M.F. of the cell under test .
This correction being introduced , the numbers will stand thus :\#151 ; Table XVIII .

1-4542 Nov. 1884 1-4540 Aug. 1885 1-4537 The slight fall in these numbers has little significance ; and we may regard the E.M.F. of No. 1 as having remained constant to within about 2~ofro for nearly two years .
I believe that the E.M.F. of cells constructed with reasonable precautions , especially as to saturation , will rarely differ at ordinary temperatures by more than ttmTo Parf from 1*454(1 \#151 ; *00077(\#163 ; \#151 ; 15 ) } B.A. volts , or ( the B.A. unit of resistance being taken equal to *9867 ohm ) 1*435(1 \#151 ; *00077(2 \#151 ; 15 ) } true volts .

In Table X. , S 32 , are given some comparisons with No. 1 Clark of a standard Daniell with equi-dense solutions of Raoult 's pattern .
As a mean at 16 ' C. , Daniell =*7703 Clark=1T046 true volt .
I have never succeeded in obtaining really good results with Daniells of any construction , variations in the conditions of the copper * rapidly altering the E.M.F. by two or three thousandths .
The mean of a rather large number of comparisons in August , 1885 , gives about *7715 Clark at 16 ' , and this number was confirmed by further observations in December , 1885 .
The sp. gr. of the solutions was 1*101 ; the zinc was amalgamated , and the copper was freshly-coated electrolytically .
The effect of variations in the condition of the metals and of the solutions are discussed by Alder Wright and by Fleming .
Some observations have also been made with apparatus and solutions lent me by Dr. Fleming , and arranged nearly according to the description published by him.t The variations observed with this form of Daniell were smaller than with Raoult 's , perhaps in consequence of the better protection of the copper solution from the atmosphere .
J The mean value for 16 ' was about *7674 Clark= 1*1004 volt , in pretty good agreement with the value found by Dr. Fleming himself .
In correcting for the effect of a small variation of temperature , I have allowed only for the variations of the Clark , assuming that of the Daniell to be insensible .

] * It seems not unlikely that the greater part of the uncertainty of ordinary Daniell s might be go rid of by substitution of silver for copper .
Silver , however , is not sufficiently soluble .
have not made experiments in this direction , believing that the mercury of the Clark cell is better s + Phil. Mag. , August , 1885 .
J In my experience the copper found its way to the zinc more readily than one would have exp The amalgamated zinc became coated with a furry deposit , which struck a blue colour on solution in nitric acid and supersaturation with ammonia .
In using Raoult 's cells I have endeavoured to ho copper in check by placing a loose strip of zinc in the connecting Y-tube .
