Whereas Loekyer* in his most recent paper " On the Chemical Classification of the Stars " ( April , 1899 ) , regards the so-called " Crucian " stars , as at a higher temperature than the " Rigelian " and " Cygnian , " and indeed he regards Bellatrix " as a type of the hottest stars , exception being made of \#163 ; Puppis .
" Of the other lines recorded by Eder and Valentaf as due to silicon , 3905'4 , 3862*5 and 3855*7 are present both in the spectra of the dissociated glass and in the high temperature spectrum of silicon obtained from the silicon tetrafluoride tube .
They are enhanced lines in the latter case , occurring together with Lockyer 's enhanced lines in the absence of the three new silicon lines , but they lie outside the region measured by Scheiner in aCygni , Sirius , and Rigel .
In the Harvard " Spectra of Bright Stars " J the two latter lines are however , specially noted in Bigel as 3863*2 and 3856*2 as " conspicuously strong in the ultra-violet , " whilst all three are recorded ( 3905*6 , 3863*2 , 3856*2 ) in stars of Groops YI to VIII ( Harvard ) , comprising a , Cygni , Sirius , and Rigel .
They would thus appear in these stars to accompany the enhanced silicon lines , specially noted by Lockyer , viz. 4128*6 and 4131*4 .
The lines 3834*4 and 3836*7 recorded by Eder and Valenta are not present in any of the photographs of silicon spectra , and may possibly be due to impurities .
The lines 3795*9 and 3791*1 recorded by Eder and Valenta are present in all the silicon photographs , but do not become enhanced at high temperatures .
There is , however , a third line , approximately X 3807 , not recorded by them , but which appears in all the photographs of silicon spectra .
It is stronger than 3795*9 and 3791*1 , and does not become enhanced with high temperature .
All three lines accompany the three new silicon lines in e Canis Majoris .

On the Electrical Resistivity of Electrolytic Nickel .
51 as required in a state of such chemical purity , and brought so easily into similar physical conditions as to annealing and density , that determinations made by different observers of their resistivity or specific electrical resistance are nearly identical .
Matthiessen 's long-accepted value* for the mass resistivity of copper in the form of hard-drawn wire , viz. , 0*14493 standard ohm per metre-gramme , was substantially confirmed by the more recent work of Mr. T. C. Fitzpatrick . !
Even the purest electrolytic copper now obtainable in an annealed condition does not show an electric conductivity more than 3 per cent , greater than that of a similar character prepared thirty-five years ago by Matthiessen .
In a research carried out in the years 1892 and 1893 by the author in conjunction with Professor Dewar , careful redeterminations were made of the volume-resistivity at 0 ' C. of all ordinary metals , taken for the most part in an annealed condition and in a state of great chemical purity .
The values so obtained for the electrical volume-resistivity of silver , copper , gold , aluminium , zinc , platinum , tin , lead , magnesium , and iron agreed fairly well with the values given by Matthiessen , and quoted in most of the treatises on electricity .
The resistivity of cadmium , as given by us was , however , considerably larger than that usually stated , although our sample of cadmium was very carefully prepared .
In the case of nickel , the purest nickel we were able to obtain was that prepared from nickel-carbonyl .
Dr. Ludwig Mond , F.K..S .
, vras so kind as to furnish us with two tubes of this nickel .
It was foimd , however , to be too brittle to draw into wire , and the operation of melting it would have most certainly introduced impurities .
Accordingly , the nickel tube was cut up in the lathe into a spiral , and a resistance coil formed with it which could be used for taking the resistivity ratios at different temperatures , but which was not sufficiently uniform in dimensions to permit its volume-resistivity to be calculated .
Hence , in our published results , we took the volume-resistivity of this nickel at 0 ' C. to be 12,320 C.G.S. units , which is the value given by Everett , said to be derived from Matthiessen 's experiments , and simply calculated the resistivity at other temperatures from the experiments given by our own observations with the Mond nickel .
About a year ago , however , Mr. J. W. Swan , F.R.S. , sent me a sample of nickel wire which he had prepared electrolytically from a hot solution of very carefully purified nickelous chloride .
The electrolytic metal was annealed by heating in an atmosphere of hydrogen , after having been drawn into wire through a die .
The nickel wire so prepared and annealed is as soft as a silver wire .

The nickel wire was then soldered to thick copper leading-in wires , and wound on a frame of a kind suitable for immersion in liquid air .
A description of this particular kind of resistance coil , which has proved itself to be exceedingly suitable for low temperature work , was given in a paper describing the result of numerous observations on the resistivity of metals at low temperatures , published by Professor Dewar and the present author in 1893.* A coil having been thus constructed , its resistance was taken , at various temperatures in a bath of paraffin oil , and the results are as shown in the table below .

at the same time by means of a platinum thermometer ( P , ) used in previous researches .
The conversion of the platinum temperatures into centigrade temperatures was effected by means of a table drawn up Mr. J. Hamilton Dickson* for this thermometer .
The measurements of the resistance at low temperatures ( \#151 ; 78'2 ' and -182-5 ' ) was obtained by measuring the coil in liquid air and melting CO2 at the Royal Institution Laboratories , by kind permission of Professor Dewar .
The total resistance of the nickel calculated from the above observations is set out in the form of a curve ( fig. 1 ) , having resistance as ordinates and temperature as abscissae .
The curves are given both for temperature in centigrade degrees and temperature in platinum degrees .
The curve shows that the resistance is falling steadily downwards to a zero value as the absolute zero of temperature is approached .
In fig. 2 the portion of the curve between 0 ' C. and 100 ' C. is shown m an enlarged scale .
In fig. 3 the volume-resistivity is set out in terms of temperature .
The results show that the volume-resistivity or resistance per centimetre-cube of this electrolytic nickel at 0 ' C. is 6935 C.G.S. units .
The average temperature coefficient between 0 ' C. and 100 ' C. is 0-00618 .
The above observations indicate that this electrolytic nickel , as prepared by Mr. Swan , has an exceedingly different and much lower resistivity than that employed for test by Matthiessen thirty-five years ago .
The value of the mean temperature-coefficient of the nickel used in the experiments of Fleming and Dewar in 1893 , and prepared by Dr. Ludwig Mond , was 0*00622f between 0 ' C. and 100 ' C. It is clear therefore that some extraordinary electrical difference exists between nickel as it can now be produced electrolytically and nickel as it was produced by Matthiessen for his experiments .
It would be interesting to ascertain if any specimen of nickel known to have been used by Matthiessen for his experiments still exists , and if so , to discover the nature of the impurity ( if impurity was present ) , or at least the physical difference , which caused his nickel to have nearly double the electrical resistivity of that which can now be produced .
I desire to record my thanks to Mr. J. E. Petavel and to Mr. A. Blok for assistance in these experiments .

Note added December 6 , 1899.\#151 ; Since writing the above short paper , I have discovered in a paper by Messrs. A. Matthiessen and C. Vogt* a reference to the sample of nickel with which the present accepted figure for its resistivity was evidently obtained .
This paper is entitled " On the influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting Power of Iron and Thallium , " and its title would not lead a reader to look in it for a reference to the resistivity of nickel .
Messrs. Matthiessen and Vogt therein state that samples of supposed chemically pure nickel and cobalt wires prepared by M. Deville were given to them by M. Wohler .
They measured the resistivity of these samples , but they state that their electrical behaviour gave them reason to believe that this nickel and cobalt were not pure .
They give the electrical conductivity of the nickel as 13*11 at 0 ' C. taking hard drawn silver at 0 ' C. as 100 .
Hence if hard drawn silver has a volume resistivity of 1620 C.G.S units at 0 C. , it follows that Matthiessen and Vogt 's value for the resistivity of their sample of nickel would be 12,357 C.G.S. units at * ' Phil. Trans. Roy .

I have been unable to discover , however , that they ever carried out their intention .
At any rate , the number which they give for the electrical volume resistivity of this nickel of the purity of which they evidently had suspicions , has been accepted for the last thirty-six years as the true value .

) This research was undertaken in order to confirm if possible the observations of Sanfelice , Roncali , and others , on the presence of organisms of the order Blastomycetes in carcinomata , and to study the morphology of the same .
The observations have been arranged under four headings :\#151 ; 1 .

Isolation by Culture.\#151 ; The tumours examined were carcinomata of the breast and uterus ; incisions were made with a sterilised knife and scrapings from the edges of these inseminated on to media .
Many kinds of media were tried , but a result was obtained only on glucose agar .
Wort agar and wort bouillon were subsequently used for subcultures ; on both the organism grows readily aerobically at 37 ' C. Sub-cultures on neutral gelatine appear as pale yellow slow-growing colonies without liquefaction of the medium .
On neutral agar the colonies have a more marked yellow tinge ; they do not appear until * The numerical values o\#163 ; the specific resistance of nickel given in various tables by different authors are not quite identical , and yet all so far found are stated to be derived from Matthiessen 's experiments .

Landolt and Bornstein give one value equivalent to 12,757 at 0 ' C. from the ratio of conductivity of nickel to that of mercury , and another equivalent to 12,014 at 0 ' C. , derived from the ratio of the conductivities of hard drawn silver to that of nickel .
