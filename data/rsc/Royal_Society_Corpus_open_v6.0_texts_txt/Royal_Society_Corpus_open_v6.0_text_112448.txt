( Abstract .
) This survey was undertaken by the Rev. W. Sidgreaves and myself in connexion with the Observatory at Stonyhurst College .
The instruments employed were those in constant use for the monthly observations of the magnetic elements at this observatory , i. e. Barrow 's dip-circle , No. 33 , a unifilar by Jones , and Frodsham 's chronometer , No. 3148 .
A portable altazimuth and an aneroid barometer were kindly placed at our disposal by the late Mr. Cooke .
A complete set of observations of the dip , declination , and horizontal intensity were taken at the following stations:-Paris , Laval , Breast , Vannes , Angers , Poitiers , Bordeaux , Abbadia ( near Hendaye ) , Loyola , Bayonne , Pau , Toulouse , Perigueux , Bourges , Paris ( a second time ) , and Amiens .
The chronometer was compared on every possible occasion , and its rate was found to be nearly always 2s per day .
The dip was observed according to the description of the observation given by the President of the Royal Society in the ' Manual of Scientific Inquiry .
' The method of vibrations and deflections was invariably adopted for determining the horizontal component of the intensity .
For the declination it was deemed most convenient to find the azimuth of a fixed mark by observing transits of the sun with Cooke 's altazimuth , and then to measure the azimuthal angle between the magnet and the fixed mark with Jones 's unifilar .
Dr. Lloyd 's method , by reflection , was made .
use of only at Breast .
The results of these observations , reduced to the epoch January 1st , 1869 , ore contained in the following Table : Paris ... ... ... ... Laval ... ... ... ... . .

Maps of the isodynamic , isoclinal , and isogonic lines of the epoch , September 1st , 1868 , are drawn from the following data , Paris being chosen as the central station for reasons given in thepaper : For the isoclinals the direction is N. 73§ 25 ' 10 " E. to S. 730 25 ' 10 " W. , the distance between the lines being 44-25 geographical miles for a change of 30 ' of dip .
The direction for the isogonics is N. 20§ 31 ' 16 " E. to S. 20§ 31 ' 16 " W. , and the distance only slightly greater than for the isoclinals , i. e. 44*35 geographical miles for 30 ' of angle .
The isodynamics lie in the direction N. 70§ 34 ' 13 " E. to S. 70§ 34 ' 13 " W. , the distance in this case being 115 geographical miles for a change of 01 in the intensity .
For the lines of equal horizontal force the direction is N. 74§ 19 ' 30 " E. to S. 74§ 19 ' 30 " W. , and 72 geographical miles the distance separating lines where the horizontal intensity differs by 0 1 .
An attempt has been made to apply a correction for the magnetic disturbances at the times of observation by means of the magnetograms obtained at Stonyhurst Observatory during the Survey ; but these corrections have not been taken into account in forming the equations of condition from which the final results have been obtained .
The probable error of any single observation of the dip , declination , total force , and horizontal component are found to be respectively 3'`13 ; 0 ' 95 ; 0-0144 ; and 0-0067 .
