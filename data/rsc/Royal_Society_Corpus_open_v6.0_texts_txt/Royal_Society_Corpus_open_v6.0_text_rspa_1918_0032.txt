) A question of great interest in connection with the solar spectrum is that of the origin of the thousands of unidentified faint lines which were photographed and catalogued by Rowland .
Some of these lines may possibly be identical with faint lines in metallic spectra which have not yet been completely tabulated , but in view of the presence of bands of cyanogen , carbon , and hydrocarbon , the possibility of the correspondence of most of them with band spectra of other substances should not be overlooked .
As a contribution to this inquiry , the present investigation was undertaken primarily in order to determine whether Group P in the ultra-violet region of the solar spectrum might not be mainly due to the presence of ammonia in the absorbing atmosphere of the sun .
Ammonia was already known to give a remarkable band in this region , having its greatest intensity near X 3360 , but existing records of the component lines were inadequate for comparison with the solar tables .
Photographs were accordingly taken with instruments of various dispersions , ranging up to that of the third order of a 10 feet concave grating , a copper arc in an atmosphere of ammonia being employed as the source in the latter case .
In view of the unusual appearance of the band , an attempt has also been made to elucidate the chief features of its structure .
The chief ammonia band consists of a bright central maximum about X3360 , a secondary maximum about X3371 , and a number of lines , which are arranged in groups of three , extending to a considerable distance in both directions .
The lines composing the two maxima are very closely crowded together and have been found to be arranged in series of ordinary type .
The components of the groups of three are widely separated near the central maxima , but the intervals rapidly diminish and there is final coalescence at X 3450 towards the red , and at X 3287 towards the violet , where the lines fade out .
The groups of three , however , are not symmetrical with respect to the central maxima , and they show marked peculiarities , so that they are very imperfectly represented by the formulae usually employed for band spectra .
The comparison with the solar spectrum is considerably complicated by The Ultra-Violet Band of Ammonia in the Solar Spectrum .

The most convincing proof of the presence of ammonia in the sun is perhaps afforded by the strongest parts of the central maximum , as indicated by the following extract from a table which is given in the paper :\#151 ; Ammonia .

j It will be seen that there is a complete correspondence of the solar and laboratory spectra as regards these two clusters , except that the line 3360*44 in the sun may be slightly reinforced by a line which Rowland attributes to nickel , though it is not given as such by Exner and Haschek .
The agreement is emphasised by the occurrence of patches of continuous background ( dark in the sun ) which are identical in the two spectra .
The coincidences in the case of the central maximum , as a whole , are scarcely less striking , and it is clear that the solar Group P is largely due to ammonia .
There is also a sufficiently consistent representation of the groups of three , and of the lines composing the secondary maximum of the ammonia band .
Of the 260 band-lines of ammonia in the region X 3450 to X 3286 , there are 140 which correspond with previously unidentified faint lines of the solar spectrum .
About 100 of the remaining lines are obscured by lines for which metallic origins have been found , or fall upon lines which are too strong in the sun to be assigned solely to ammonia , and the few which fail to appear in the sun are all of low intensity .
