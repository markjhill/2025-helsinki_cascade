] The following are the principal differences pointed out by Sir Everard Home as characterizing the Manatee of the West Indies from that species of the Dugong , lately described to the Society , from Sumatra .
It differs externally in the shape of the tail , in having neither tusks nor nails , and also in the form of its snout .
The teeth differ in number ; and though the general form of the skeleton is similar , there are fewer vertebrne .
The stomach differs in the shape of the solid glandular part , and of the lateral pouches , but both animals feed upon fuci .
The formss of the teeth , however , in these two species are totally different , which shows , says the author , how inefficient a mode of classing animals is furnished by the appearance of the teeth .
