stitute a factor , which cannot fail to have an important bearing in all general questions , such as the growth of the cell wall , the conduction of food , the ascent of water , the process of fertilisation , the penetration of fungi into their host , the process of secretion , and the transmission of the impulses which determine growth and movement of plant organs .
Concerning certain of these problems , I should like to make a few concluding remarks .
As to the passage of water from the root hair to the vessel , the presence of connecting threads in the cells of root tissue makes it possible to imagine that the ordinary laws of osmosis may be profoundly modified , and that the filaments which establish protoplasmic continuity may conduct stimuli , leading , for instance , to a difference in reaction of the proximal and distal halves of any given cell .
Similarly , it is conceivable that a definite polarity is established , which helps to determine the direction of the flow .
As to the larger question of lapid water movement , although this is neither the time nor the place to enter into theory , yet I cannot refrain from remark-ing that it is not impossible that the threads , doubtless present in large quantities in dead vessels , may , if they suffer mucilaginous change , have some bearing on the question , by assisting to sustain the water at any given level or attracting water in the immediate environment .
In any case , I am strongly of opinion that the part played by mucilage and the force of hydration have not as yet received sufficient attention .
As to movements generally , I am still unable to accept Pfeffer 's view ' of the subsidiary part played by the protoplasm in connexion with turgidity , * and I am still of opinion that the ectoplasm is the master factor which determines the condition of the cell .
The present research demonstrates among other things that there are fixed points in the ectoplasm , and this may have some bearing on the possibility of establishing the periodic or sudden contractions and dilatations which I believe are associated with turgescence , and of Avhich such a phenomenon as the effusion of water from the cells of a stimulated Mimosa pulvinus is but an abnormal instance .

113 a lower value for hydrogen , and have consequently diminished the number expressing the ratio of the viscosity of hydrogen to that of air .
In 1876 I found the ratio to be 0'508 .
In 1877 I reduced this ratio to 0462 .
Last year , with improved apparatus , I obtained the ratio 0458 , and 1 have now got it as low as 04439 " ( p. 425 ) .
The difficulty was attributed to moisture .
Thus ( p. 422 ) : " After working at the subject for more than a year , it was discovered that the discrepancy arose from a trace of water obstinately held by the hydrogen\#151 ; an impurity which behaved as I explain farther on in the case of air and water vapour .
" When occupied in 1888 with the density of hydrogen , I thought that viscosity might serve as a useful test of purity , and I set up an apparatus somewhat on the lines of Sir W. Crookes .
A light mirror , 18 mm. in diameter , was hung by a fine fibre ( of quartz I believe ) about 60 cm .
long .
A small attached magnet gave the means of starting the vibrations whose subsidence was to be observed .
The viscosity chamber was of glass , and carried tubes sealed to it above and below .
The window , through which the light passed to and fto , was of thick plate glass cemented to a ground face .
This arrangement has great optical advantages , and though unsuitable for experiments involving high exhaustions , appeared to be satisfactory for the purpose in hand , viz. , the comparison of various samples of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure .
The Toppler pump , as well as the gas generating apparatus and purifying tubes , were connected by sealing .
But I was not able to establish any sensible differences among the various samples of hydrogen experimented upon at that time .
In view of the importance of the question , I have lately resumed these experiments .
If hydrogen , carefully prepared and desiccated in the ordinary way , is liable to possess a viscosity of 10 per cent , in excess , a similar uncertainty in less degree may affect the density .
I must confess that I was sceptical as to the large effect attributed to water vapour in gas which had passed over phosphoric anhydride .
Sir W. Crookes himself described an experiment ( p. 428 ) from which it appeared that a residue of water vapour in his apparatus indicated the viscosity due to hydrogen , and , without deciding between them , he offered two alternative explanations .
Either the viscosity of water vapour is really the same as that of hydrogen , or under the action of the falling mercury in the Sprengel pump decomposition occurred with absorption of oxygen , so that the residual gas was actually hydrogen .
It does not appear that the latter explanation can be accepted , at any rate as regards the earlier stages of the exhaustion , when a rapid current of aqueous vapour must set in the direction of the pump ; but if we adopt the former , how comes it that small traces of water vapour have so much effect upon the viscosity of hydrogen ?
I\#153 ; Lord Rayleigh .
It is a fact , as was found many years ago by Kundt and Warbur^* ( and as I have confirmed ) , that the viscosity of aqueous vapours but little greater than that of hydrogen .
The numbers ( relatively to air ) given by them are 0*5256 and 0'488 .
It is difficult to believe that small traces of a foreign gas having a 6 per cent , greater viscosity could produce an effect reaching to 10 per cent. In the recent experiments the hydrogen was prepared from amalgamated zinc and sulphuric acid in a closed generator constituting in fact a Smee cell , and it could be liberated at any desired rate by closing the circuit externally through a wire resistance .
The generating vessel was so arranged as to admit of exhaustion , and the materials did not need to be removed during the whole course of the experiments .
The gas entered the viscosity chamber from below , and could be made to pass out above through the upper tube ( which served also to contain the fibre ) into the pump head of the Toppler .
By suitable taps the viscosity chamber could be isolated , when observations were to be commenced .
The vibrations were started by a kind of galvanometer coil in connection ( through a key ) with a Leclanche cell .
As a sample set of observations the following relating to hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and at 58 ' 1\ , which had been purified by passage over fragments of sulphur and solid soda ( without phosphoric anhydride ) , may be given :\#151 ; Observations on June 7 , 1897 .

115 gives the actual arcs of vibration , the fourth their ( common ) logarithms , and the fifth the differences of these , which should be constant .
The mean logarithmic decrement can be obtained from the first and last arcs only , but the intermediate values are useful as a check .
The time of ( complete ) vibration was determined occasionally .
It was constant , whether hydrogen or air occupied the chamber , at 26'2 seconds .
The observations extended themselves over two months , and it would be tedious to give the results in any detail .
One of the points to which I attached importance was a comparison between liydrogeu as it issued from the generator without any desiccation whatever and hydrogen carefully dried by passage through a long tube packed with phosphoric anhydride .
The difference proved itself to be comparatively trifling .
For the wet hydrogen there were obtained on May 10 , 11 , such log .

The dried hydrogen , on the other hand , gave 0'0588 , 0'0586 , 0-0584 , 0'0590 on various repetitions with renewed supplies of gas , or as a mean 0'0587 , about 1 per cent , smaller than for the wet hydrogen .
It appeared that the dry hydrogen might stand for several days in the viscosity chamber without alteration of logarithmic decrement .
It should be mentioned that the apparatus was set up underground , and that the changes of temperature were usually small enough to be disregarded .
In the next experiments the phosphoric tube was replaced by others containing sulphur ( with the view of removing mercury ' vapour ) and solid soda .
Numbers were obtained on different days such as 0'0591 , O0586 , O0588 , 00587 , mean 0'0588 , showing that the desiccation by soda was practically as efficient as that by phosphoric anhydride .
\#171 ; At this stage the apparatus was rearranged .
As shown by observations upon air ( at 10 cm .
residual pressure ) , the logarithmic decrements were increased , probably owing to a slight displacement of the mirror relatively to the containing walls of the chamber .
The sulphur and soda tubes were retained , but with the addition of one of hard glass containing turnings of magnesium .
Before the magnesium was heated the mean number for hydrogen ( always at atmospheric pressure ) was 0'0600 .
The heating of the magnesium to redness , which it was supposed might remove residual water , had the effect of increasing the viscosity of the gas , especially at first.* After a few operations the logarithmic decrement from gas which had passed over the hot magnesium seemed to settle itself at O'OOOG .
When the magnesium was allowed to remain cold , fresh fillings gave again 00602 , 0'0601 , 0'0598 , mean 0'0600 .

long and closely packed with fresh material .
The viscosity appeared to be slightly increased , but hardly more than would be accounted for by an accidental rise of temperature .
The mean uncorrected number may be taken as 0-0603 .
The evidence from these experiments tends to show that residual moisture is without appreciable influence upon the viscosity of hydrogen ; so much so that , were there no other evidence , this conclusion would appear to me to be sufficiently established .
It remains barely possible that the best desiccation to which I could attain was still inadequate , and that absolutely dry hydrogen would exhibit a less viscosity .
It must be admitted that an apparatus containing cemented joints and greased stop-cocks is in some respects at a disadvantage .
Moreover , it should be noticed that the ratio 0'0600 : 0-1120 , viz. 0'536 , for the viscosities of hydrogen and air is decidedly higher than that ( 0*500 ) deduced by Sir G. Stokes from Crookes 's observations .
According to the theory of the former , a fair comparison may be made by taking , as above , the logarithmic decrements for hydrogen at atmospheric pressure , and for air at a pressure of 10 cm .
of mercury .
I may mention that moderate rarefactions , down say to a residual pressure of 5 cm .
, had no influence on the logarithmic decrement observed with hydrogen .
I am not able to explain the discrepancy in the ratios thus exhibited .
A viscous quality in the suspension , leading to a subsidence of vibrations independent of the gaseous atmosphere , would tend to diminish the apparent differences between various kinds of gas , but I can hardly regard this cause as operative in my experiments .
For actual comparisons of widely differing viscosities I should prefer an apparatus designed on Maxwell 's principle , in which the gas subjected to shearing should form a comparatively thin layer bounded on one side by a moving plane and on the other by a fixed plane .
