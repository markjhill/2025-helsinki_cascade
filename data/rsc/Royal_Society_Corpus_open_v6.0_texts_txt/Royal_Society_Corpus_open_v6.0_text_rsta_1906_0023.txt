of my ' Besearches on Explosives ' I gave the results of a very extensive series of experiments , the completion of which necessarily occupied a very long time , and the particular explosives with which I experimented were those with which artillerists in this country were familiar , and with which a considerable number of experiments had been made .
These explosives were ( 1 ) the cordite of the service known as Mark I ; ( 2 ) the modified cordite known as M.D. ; and ( 3 ) the nitrocellulose known as Bottweil B. B. The experiments made by myself extended , for all the above explosives , from densities of 0'05 to 0'45 or ( L50 , and pressures of from 2'75 tons per sq .
inch ( 419 atmospheres ) to pressures of 60 tons per sq .
inch ( 9145 atmospheres ) , and although the transformation on ignition varied both with regard to the particular explosive employed and for each explosive as regards the density at which it was fired , yet when the observations were represented by curves drawn through or near the observed points there was a pretty close resemblance in the form of the curves , not only in respect to the variations in the quantities of the gases generated at the varied densities , but also with regard to the units of heat developed and the volumes of gas produced .
Certain anomalies , chiefly with reference to the temperature of explosion at different densities , having appeared , I was anxious to make experiments with other * Small alterations are required in some of the figures given at the higher densities , owing to experiments which have been carried out at a density of CL 50 since the paper was prepared .

These results I consider quite satisfactory , but the comparison with Explosive IV .
was even closer .
In Experiment 1598 a charge of Explosive IV .

The two analyses are practically identical.* When explosives are fired in a gun , the chamber in which the charge is placed is , of course , full of air , and in my experiments the charges were similarly treated .
With the view , however , of testing the difference due to the presence of air , I fired three charges of cordite all at a density of 0-05 ( this density of course including the largest percentage of air ) , the three experiments being , first , with air ; second , air exhausted ; third , with an atmosphere of nitrogen .
The analysis gave the following results :\#151 ; * These results have been further confirmed by several other duplicate experiments .

After correcting in the former the other constituents for this difference , it will be noted from the last column that the experiment in nitrogen yielded slightly more carbon monoxide and slightly less hydrogen than did the charge fired in the exhausted vessel .
The C02 and CH4 are practically identical in the two experiments .
It may be interesting to compare the foregoing results with the analysis of the gases taken from the chamber of a 9*2-inch gun fired with a charge of 103 lbs. ( 46*71 kilos ) , giving a muzzle velocity of 2,600 f/ s. ( 792*5 m/ s. ) , and a pressure of 16*1 tons per sq .
inch ( 2453 atmospheres ) .
As soon as possible after firing the muzzle of the gun was closed and the breech opened .
An exhausted gas tube held in a special holder was introduced to the far end of the chamber , and one of its stop-cocks momentarily opened .
The analysis gave the following composition of the gases after deducting air : \#151 ; Round 1 .

The samples for the first two rounds were taken so soon as the breech was opened , the last two after a dummy shot was rammed home .
The composition of the gas after deducting the air is similar to that obtained by firing cordite at low densities in a closed vessel .
It follows that atmospheric combustion had not taken place to any extent .
SIR ANDREW NOBLE : RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES .
Although for the elucidation of the laws which govern the transformation of the explosives when fired I have taken the densities named , I must point out that the requirements of the artillerist are confined to much narrower limits , the density , of course , varying considerably with the particular explosive used .
In modern guns , for example , the chamber density varies from about 0*310 to nearly 0*500 , a good deal of the variation being due to the nature of the explosive used .
It is hardly necessary to point out to artillerists that the chamber density is not the density which is responsible for the pressure developed in the gun .
The difference , which is frequently very considerable , is due to the time taken by the explosive to burn , and this depends upon the nature , form , and dimensions of the explosive , the expansion suffered by the nascent gases and the heat lost , due to work done upon the projectile and by communication of heat to the gun , and under these circumstances the pressure developed would , with full charges if compared with close vessel pressures , represent densities approximately between 0*17 and 0*23 .
The tables which are given in my late communication* to the Royal Society gave , for each particular density , the actual result observed .
In the present paper the observations have been corrected by drawing curves to represent as nearly as possible the whole of the results , the actual observations , which are also given , showing in each case the departure from the curve .
See Plates 10 , 11 , and 12 .
If reference be made to the tables , or to the plates just mentioned , it will be observed how wide are the differences , not only in the absolute volumes of the several gases , but in the variations with reference to the densities at which they were fired .
Thus , for example , comparing Explosives III .
and Y. ( Norwegian 165 and Italian ballistites , see Plate 10 ) , while in the former the carbon monoxide commences at the density 0*05 with a percentage volume of 38*5 , falling at a density of 0*45 to 22 per cent. , the carbon dioxide commences with 13*3 per cent. , rising rapidly to 31 per cent. In the latter explosive the CO commences at 20*5 per cent , and falls slowly to 15 per cent. , while the C02 commences a little over 26 per cent. , rising also comparatively slowly to nearly 34 per cent. I may remark in passing that the Italian ballistite is the only explosive with which I have experimented , where , at low densities , the volume of C02 is greater than that of CO. But there are in these two explosives other remarkable differences .
Ihus , in the Italian ballistite , at a density of 0*05 , the volume of methane , CH4 , is a mere trace , about 0*02 per cent. , but it remains very much lower than is the case with any other explosive , being only 1*9 per cent , at the density of 0*45 .
With the Norwegian , on the other hand , the CH4 , although the volume at commencement is only 0*4 per cent. , is , at 0*45 density , 11 per cent. Again , as might be expected from the large quantity of CH4 found , in the case of * ' Phil. Trans./ A , vol. 205 , pp. 221 to 223 .
VOL. CCVI.\#151 ; A. the Norwegian ballistite , the volume of hydrogen falls from over 20 per cent , to about 9 per cent. , in the Italian the H rises from about 8 per cent , to about 10 per cent. , falling slightly at higher densities .
In both explosives the N is practically constant at about 12 per cent , and 16 per cent , respectively , but there is a very great difference as regards the H20 .
In the Norwegian the H20 is constant at 14 per cent. , there being no greater difference than might be expected from errors of observation , while in the Italian the H20 , which commences at density 0*05 with a volume of 29 per cent. , falls at a density of 0*45 to about 24*5 per cent. No other explosive approaches the Italian ballistite in respect to the large volume of aqueous vapour formed , especially at low densities .
As regards the other explosives , the differences , although not so pronounced as those I have just quoted , are still remarkable .
Thus , comparing Cordite Mark I and Norwegian 167 ( see Plate 11 ) , in the cordite the volume of C02 commences at 21 per cent. , rising to 31|- per cent , at d \#151 ; 0*45 , while CO , commencing at 26|- per cent. , falls to 16j per cent. , the two gases being of equal volume at a density of 0*19 .
In the case of Norwegian 167 , the C02 commences at 15J per cent. , rising to 31 per cent. , while the CO , commencing at 35|- per cent. , rapidly falls to 21 per cent. , the two gases being equal in volume at a density of about 0*34 .
H20 and N may , in both explosives , , be regarded as nearly constant , H20 being with the first at a volume of about 21 per cent. , with the latter at a volume of about 15^ per cent. , N at volumes of approximately 15*3 per cent , and 13 per cent. CH4 rises from a trace in I. and IY .
explosives to 5*5 per cent , in the case of cordite and to 9 per cent , in the case of the Norwegian , while the H falls from nearly 16 per cent , to 10*5 per cent , in I. and from 19 per cent , to 9*5 per cent , in the case of IY .
With respect , however , to Explosives II .
and YI .
( M.D. and nitrocellulose ) there is , in the transformation , a remarkable similarity .
In both explosives ( see Plate 12 ) the C02 rises from about 15 per cent , to about 29^ per cent. , while the CO falls from about 35 per cent , to between 21 and 22 per cent. , equal volumes being at the densities of about 0*32 and 0*36 respectively .
In both the marsh gas rises from a trace to about 9 per cent. , while the hydrogen falls from about 20 per cent , to about 11 per cent. In both the H20 and N are nearly constant , the H20 being about 17 per cent , in each , while the N is about 12-| per cent , with M.D. , and about 11|- with nitrocellulose .
In the tables are given the cubic centimetres per gramme of the permanent and total gases , and in Plate 13 are drawn curves representing for the six explosives the observations of these total volumes .
It will be noted that in the case of the nitrocellulose and Norwegian ballistite 165 there is , with increasing density , a very considerable decrease in volume , but with the Italian ballistite throughout the range of the experiments there is hardly any change .
The curves in this plate , it will be observed , are concave to the axis of abscissae .
SIR ANDREW NOBLE : RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES .
In the tables are shown the units of heat both for the water fluid and the water gaseous , and in Plate 14 are drawn curves of thg units of heat , water gaseous , for the whole of the six explosives .
The Italian ballistite develops more heat than any of the other explosives , being a little higher than Mark I cordite .
This is , of course , objectionable as regards erosion , but recently , when in Italy , I was informed that this heat had been greatly reduced by the incorporation of 12j per cent , of carbon .
I had already made some experiments with percentages of carbon , introduced as suggested by Lord Rayleigh .
The curves in this instance are all convex to the axis of abscissae , and it is interesting to note that where the volume of gas per gramme is large the units of heat are low , and that where the volumes of gas are rapidly decreasing the curves representing the amount of heat developed show a rapid increase .
Thus , with the new explosives , the point to which I so often drew attention in the case of the great variety of the old gunpowders with which I experimented is confirmed , namely that , with an explosive , if ever a large volume of gas is formed the heat developed will be low , if a small volume be generated the heat developed will be high .
Coming now to the relation existing between the density of the charge and the pressure developed by the explosion , I have had some difficulty in regard to the abnormal pressures obtained with some explosives at high densities , but it must be remembered that the pressures to which I refer are very far above those with which artillerists are concerned , and do not materially affect the conditions of service of the propellants used in this or other countries .
If reference be made to the tables , or preferably Plate 19 , it will be observed that , up to densities of 0*45 , the Explosives I. , II .
, and VI .
are perfectly regular ; there are no abnormal pressures in any of the three , and the curves fairly represent the observations .
In the case of cordite , which has a considerably higher potential energy than the other two , I have , without any abnormal pressure , gone to densities of 0'5 and 0'55 , representing pressures of 53 and 60 tons per sq .
inch ( 8078 and 9145 atmospheres ) , but when M.D. and nitrocellulose were fired at the density of 0*5 , the pressure of M.D. rose to 57 tons per sq .
inch ( 8688 atmospheres ) instead of the normal pressure , which should he about 49 tons per sq .
inch ( 7469 atmospheres ) , and the pressure of the nitrocellulose rose to 56 tons per sq .
inch ( 8535 atmospheres ) instead of to what should have been the normal , about 47 tons per sq .
inch ( 7164 atmospheres ) .
Referring again to the same plate , on which are also drawn curves representing the relation of pressure to density of Explosives III .
, IV .
, and V. , it will be seen that , while the Italian ballistite follows approximately , up to a density of 0*45 , the same law as rules in Explosives I. , II .
, and VI .
, the two Norwegian ballistites show an abnormal , though small , increase in pressure when the density exceeds 0'3 , Norwegian 167 , for example , gradually approaches the cordite pressure , and at the density of 0'45 apparently equals it .
The point now to be considered is : Are these slight increments of pressure in the Norwegian ballistites , and the much more abnormal increments in Explosives II .
and YI .
at densities of 0'5 , real , or are they due either to partial detonation or to wave action on the crusher gauge during explosion ?
Supposing there to be no detonation or violent motion of the gases , the pressure on the walls of the explosive cylinder should be dependent , in a vessel impervious to heat , solely on the quantity of gas produced and on the amount of heat generated by the explosion .
I have , therefore , calculated for the whole of the explosives the value of the products ( volume of gas multiplied by units of heat water gaseous ) and the results are shown in Plate 15 .
It will be observed that the curves , which are very nearly straight lines , practically confirm the pressure curves of Explosives I. , II .
, Y. and YI .
, and they equally show that the abnormal pressures of II .
and YI .
at densities of 0'5 are not confirmed .
To test this latter point further , I repeated the experiments with M.D. and R.R. at the density of 0'5 , so arranging the lighting of the charge that the rush of the nascent gases should not impinge directly on the crusher gauge .
At the same time , to be certain that the transformation was the same , the usual course of analysing the products of explosion was followed .
I give the results of R.R. as an illustration .
It will be seen that the pressure indicated by the gauge was in this experiment normal , and , the transformation being the same , it follows that the high pressure obtained in the first experiment was due to wave action .

I may point out also that the curves appear to show that the pressures determined at the very low densities are too small , although it is true this might have been SIR ANDREW NOBLE : RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES .
predicted .
At low densities the small charge burns much more slowly , has a large percentage of air to heat up , and , from the slow burning , parts with a much greater percentage of heat to the walls of the explosion vessel .
The extraordinary rapidity with which the gases part with their heat may be appreciated if 1 mention that a charge of 32 grammes , giving rise to a pressure of close upon 8 tons ( 1219 atmospheres ) , parts with half of its heat to the walls of the explosion vessel in little more than half a second .
Since , with the Norwegian ballistites , there is a slight departure from previous experience , and from the pressures indicated by multiplying the volume of gas by the heat generated for densities higher than 0'3 , I have shown for these explosives both the curves derived from the actual observations and that which would result if the pressure were determined from the data to which I have referred .
The next point we have to consider is : The data being as is shown in the tables and graphically in the plates , what temperature are we to assign to that generated by the explosion ?
With the view of studying the question I resorted to two methods : ( i. ) Knowing with very considerable accuracy the units of heat ( water gaseous ) generated by the explosion , and having determined approximately the specific heat of the gases , the temperature of explosion should be given by the equation t_ gramme units of heat specific heat ( ii .
) Knowing also with considerable accuracy the pressure at any given density , and knowing the pressure p0 when the volume of gas generated is reduced to the temperature of 0 ' G. and a pressure of 760 millims. of mercury , the temperature is given by the equation , = P-Po 0-00367xp0 ( 2 ) .
With reference to equation ( 1 ) , the specific heat of C02 is a very important factor in this determination , and the recent researches of Messrs. Holborn and Austin upon the specific heat of gases at constant pressure at high temperatures having apparently shown that the specific heats given by Mallard and Le Chatelier for temperatures above 100 ' C. are considerably too high , I have taken the figures given by these physicists , which , I may observe , up to temperatures of 800 ' 0 .
are confirmed by Langen .
The equation given by Holborn and Austin for the specific heat of C03 at constant pressure is Specific heat = 0'2028 +0-000,128,40-0-000,000,0502 , 0 being the temperature .
The correctness of this equation for temperatures up to 800 ' C. has been proved , and assuming that the same equation holds up to 1300 ' C. , the specific heats for each 100 degrees are given below .

The temperature would , however , probably require to be considerably higher at the pressures we are considering .
The specific heats given are , as I have said , those for constant pressure , and to obtain those at constant volume it is ' necessary to divide by the constant Jc connecting the specific heats of gases and vapours at constant pressure and constant volume .
I give below the values I have used ( l ) of the specific heats at constant pressure\#151 ; these are taken either from Holborn and Austin 's paper , or from Landolt* Mendeleef , 'Principles of Chemistry/ vol. 1 , p. 381 ; also Deville , 'Comptes Rendus/ vol , 56 , p. 729 ; and Berthelot , ' Comptes Rendus/ vol. 68 , p. 1035 .

For the sake of clearness , the temperatures obtained from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are graphically shown on Plates 16 , 17 , and 18 .
Beginning with equation ( 1)\#151 ; the Italian ballistite , which shows the highest temperature , commences at the density of 0*05 with 4943 ' G , this temperature hardly varying at all till the density of 0'25 is reached , when it slowly but regularly increases to about 5000 ' C. at d = 0*45 .
Cordite Mark I , commencing at 4742 ' C. with a very slight fall , is practically constant up to 0*30 , after which it rises somewhat rapidly to a temperature of 4921 ' C. at 0'45 and to 5060 C. at d = 0*50 .
M.D. , commencing with 3814 ' C. with a slight fall , reaches the same temperature at d = 0'22 , after which it rises rapidly to about 4455 ' C. at \#151 ; 0*45 .
Norwegian ballistite 167 begins about 3748 ' C. , and , with a very slight fall , regains the same temperature at d = 0*2 , after which it reaches 4298 C. at 0*45 and 4437 ' C. at d = 0*50 .
Norwegian ballistite 165 has a temperature 350 ' C. lower between densities 0 05 and 0*15 , and , after the latter density , rises rapidly to 4177 C. at = 0 45 and to 4325 ' C. at d = 0*5 .
The nitrocellulose B.R , commencing at 3213 ' C. , rises steadily , but not very rapidly , to 3861 ' C. at d \#151 ; 0*45 and to 3977 ' C. at 0*5 .
When , however , we come to the temperatures given by equation ( 2 ) , we are met with some very remarkable differences , which are shown by the tables , but which are more readily appreciated if reference be made to Plates 16 , 17 , and 18 , m which the explosives are arranged in descending order of the temperatures dev eloped .
It will be observed that at the higher densities and pressures there is generally a very tolerable accordance in the temperatures obtained from the two formulae , but as the density and pressure diminish the divergence becomes , in all cases , considerable , but very greatly more with the explosives which develop very high temperatures and which give rise to large percentages of carbonic anhydride .
The only construction I am able to put upon the tolerably close approximation of temperature given by the two formulae at high densities and pressures , and the wide differences which exist in some of the explosives at low densities , is that , as I think it reasonable to expect , at high densities dissociation of the carbonic anhydride is prevented by the very high pressure , and that the great difference between , for instance , Italian ballistite and nitrocellulose It .
It .
at , say , the density of OT , is due , firstly , to the difference of the temperature at which the nascent gases are generated , and , secondly , to the proportion of C02 which is subject to dissociation .
Formula ( 1 ) gives for Italian ballistite at d OT a temperature of nearly 5000 ' C. , and for this explosive the temperature given by units of heat/ by specific heat is nearly constant , while the percentage of C02 is 3 8'2 .
The same formula gives for the nitrocellulose at the same density a temperature of formation of 3200 ' C. , while the percentage of C02 is only 19*45 .
I have pointed out that , under atmospheric pressure , the dissociation of C02 commences at about 1300 ' C. , and the very much higher temperatures of formation of the gases of the Italian ballistite , combined with its double percentage of C02 , appear to me to be sufficient to explain the results obtained with this explosive .
If reference be made to Plate 16 , it will be seen that while at the density of 0*1 there is , with Italian ballistite , a difference of about 1800 ' C. between the two formulae , there is with the nitrocellulose a difference only of under 800 ' C. The theory I venture to submit is as follows :\#151 ; .
The nascent gases are generated at temperatures approximately as given by equation ( 1 ) and by the red curves in Plates 16 , 17 , and 18 .
Under the low densities and pressures at the very high temperatures with which we are concerned , the C02 and possibly some H20 are partially dissociated , giving rise to the fall in temperature exhibited by the results obtained from equation ( 2 ) at low densities .
At high densities , as already pointed out , the two equations give , in some cases , accordant results , in all cases tolerable agreement ; it therefore appears to me to be reasonable to suppose that the facts I have recorded are due to partial dissociation at low densities and pressures , which dissociation is prevented by the very high pressures ruling at densities of 0*40 , 0*45 , and 0*50 .
As no free oxygen is ever found in the analysis , in cooling down any free oxygen due to dissociation must have combined and the heat lost by dissociation regained .
The re-combination must , however , be very gradual , as no discontinuity is observed in the cooling curves .
A certain amount of confirmation is given to the view I have taken by the fact SIR ANDREW NOBLE : RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES .
that if the explosives be arranged according to the amount of heat generated , derived from equation ( 1 ) , regard being also had to the amount of C02 found , it will be found that the differences between the two formulae decrease approximately as the factors to which I have referred decrease , as is shown in the following table :_ ( 1 ) Explosives .
( 2 ) Temperature of formation derived from equation ( 1 ) .
Density = O'05 .
( 3 ) Percentage of C02 .
m ( 4 ) Temperature reduced by dissociation derived from equation ( 2 ) .

( 5 ) Difference of temperature .

3213 17-95 2260 953 The differences given in column ( 5 ) of the above table represent , for the very low density of 0*05 , the differences which I suppose to be due chiefly to dissociation , but partly to the communication of heat to the explosion vessel\#151 ; hut these differences are very considerably less if the mean density giving rise to the maximum pressure in the bores of guns is taken .
Thus with Italian ballistite the difference between the two formulae is approximately 1210 ' C. ; with cordite Mark I , 860 ' C. ; with M.D. , 560 ' C. ; with Norwegian 167 , 600 ' C. ; with Norwegian 165 , 510 ' C. ; and with nitrocellulose RR , 480 ' .
At the density of 0*45 the differences between the two formulae are as follows :\#151 ; Italian ballistite difference ' C. 150 , Cordite Mark 1 55 200 , 55 320 , Norwegian ballistite 167 55 250 , Norwegian ballistite 165 55 130 , Nitrocellulose 55 180 .
It will be observed , both from the above figures and the curves , that with the Italian ballistite alone at the density 0*45 is the temperature derived from equation ( 2 ) lower than that derived from equation ( 1 ) .
With all the other explosives the temperatures derived from equation ( 2 ) are the higher .
4 he differences , however , are not great , being generally under 5 per cent. , that is about 200 C. In the case of experiments carried on , both at pressures and temperatures very greatly above the limits at which physicists ordinarily experiment , I can hardly hope VOL. CCVI.\#151 ; A. 3 O that the methods I have employed , and the conclusions at which I have arrived , will escape criticism .
The results of the experiments given in the tables and plates may , however , be taken as very approximately correct , and the repeat experiments I have made show that there is great constancy in the transformation which takes place on explosion at any given density .
I conclude by expressing my obligation to Dr. Sodeau and Mr. Hutchinson for their assistance in carrying out the various experiments , in the analysis , and in the laborious , but necessary calculations .
Note.\#151 ; In the case of the Norwegian ballistites , the pressures at densities above 0*3 have been corrected to accord with the values obtained from the volume of the gas generated , multiplied by the units of heat determined .
