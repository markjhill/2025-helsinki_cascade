" On the Hyssop of Scripture .
" By J. F. Royle , M.D. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. Many attempts have at different times been made , by various authors , to identify the plant which , in our authorized version of the Scriptures , is translated Hyssop .
The author enters at large into the history of the speculations of former writers on this subject ; and after an elaborate investigation , is led to the conclusion that this plant is the Capparis spinosa of Linnaeus , or Caper plant , a shrub abundantly met with in the south of Europe , where it appears to be indigenous , and also generally on the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean , as well as in Lower Egypt and in Syria .
