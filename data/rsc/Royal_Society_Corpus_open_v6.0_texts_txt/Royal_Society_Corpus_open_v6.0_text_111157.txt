" 3By Edward Joseph Lowe , Esq. , F.R.A.S. Communicated by Marshall Hall , M.D. , F.R.S. Received May 3 , 1851 .
The object of the author in this comimunication is to connect the series ofthermometrical observations made by the late MatthewNeedham , Esq. , at Lenton House , at the distance of only 200 yards from the observatory of Highfield House , with those made by himself from 184$2 to the present time at the latter place .
He procured Mr. Needham 's observations from the Committee of the Bromley House Li &lt; brary , Nottingham , and also the instrument with whibch they were made , and which , upon comparison with his own standard , Was found by Mr. Glaisher to be correct .
Mr. Needham 's observations were registered at 8 A.M. and 11 M , , and to the monthly means of these records corrections have been applied to convert them into mean monthly values .
Those made by the author were registered at 9 A.iM .
and 9 r.M. , and these , together with the highest and lowest readings of self-registering thermometers , have been subjected to the same process .
The following tables deduced from the observations are given in the paper:1 .
The mean temperature of each month at Highfield House from 1810 to 1850 .
From this table are deduced the mean temperature of each month from all the observations , viz* January 36 ?
-2 ; February 38 ?

The highest and lowest monthly mean temperature in every year , from 1810 to 1850 , with the amount of difference of temo perature .
o'rom this table it appears that the coldest month in the year has occurred in January 22 times ; in February 10 times ; in March once ; and in December 8 times , The hottest month in the year has occurred in June 5 times ; in July 26 times ; in August 12 times ; and in September once .
The coldest month in the whole period occurred in January 1814 , the mean temperature being 5260 ?
8 .
The hottest month during the whole period occurred in July 1847 , the mean temperature being 68 ?
'8 .
The means of all the differences between the hottest and coldest month in every year is 27 ?
'2 : the least difference occurred in 1828 , viz. 21 ?
03 ; the greatest difference in 1814 , viz. 35 ?
'0 .
3 .
The excess of the monthly mean temperature in every year , above the temperature of the month from all the years .
The means of the numbers in each column of this table , taken without regard to sign , gives the variability of the temperature in spring 2 ?
01 ; in summer 1 ?
'7 ; in autumn.2'O ; in winter 3S0O .
The greatest difference in the monthly means in spring is 11 ?
.9 ; in summer 12 ?
'5 ; in autumn 13 ?
'9 ; in winter 18 ?
'3 .
The coldest year in this series was 1814 , when the mean annual temperature was only 45 ?
00 : the hottest year was 1846 , the mean annual temperature being 51 ' ?
4 .
4 .
The mean temperature in every month in successive groups of 10 years , and for the whole year .
5 .
The mean temperature in quarterly periods in successive groups of 10 years .
From this it is stated that the mean temperature of the 1st quarter is 39 ?
'5 ; of the 2nd , 53 ?
'3 ; of the 3rd , 59 ?
'3 ; of the 4th , 44 ?
'0 .
6 .
The mean temperature in spring , summer , autumn and winter , in successive groups of 10 years .
From this it is concluded that the mean temperature of spriig is 47 ?
08 ; of summer 600 ?
0 ; of autumn 49 ?
09 ; of winter 38 ?
1 Cold springs occurred in 1810 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 117 , $7 , 38 , , 42 , 45 , 49 and 50 ; and the mean of the temperatures of these springs is 450 ?
5 .
The coldest spring was that of 1837 , the mean temperature being only 4303 , : Hot springs occurred in 1811 , 15 , 19 , 22 , 23 , 27 , 28 , 30 , 31 and 41 ; and the mean of the temperatures of these springs is 50 ?
'4 : the hottest spring was that of 1841 , the mean temperature being as high as 51 -4 .
Cold summers occurred in 1816 , 17 , 2 , : 21 , , 41,43 and 49 ; and the mean of the temperatures of these summers is 580 ?

The coldest summer was that of 1816 , the mean temperature being , only 57o03 .
Hot summers occurred in the years 118 , 24 , 26 , 31 , 46 and 47 ; and the mean of the tetmperatures of these summers is 64 ?
