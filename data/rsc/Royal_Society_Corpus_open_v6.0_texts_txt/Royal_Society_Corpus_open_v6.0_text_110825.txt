" A statement of Experiments showing that Carbon and Ni ?
trogen are compound bodies , and are made by Plants during their growth .
" By Robert Rigg , Esq. , F.R.S. The author , finding that sprigs of succulent plants , such as iniiit , placed in a bottle containing perfectly pure water , and having no communication with the atmosphere except through the medium of water , or mercury and water , in a few weeks grow to more than double their size , with a proportionate increase of weight of all the chemical elements which enter into their composition , is thence disposed to infer that all plants make carbon and nitrogen ; and that the quantity made by any plant varies with the circumstances in which it is placed .
