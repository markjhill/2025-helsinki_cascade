Gladstone Tribe on [ Mar. 14 evidence now deduced as to a connexion o.f some sort between the behavior of sun-spots and the positions of the planets Venus and Mercury .
\ye think , however , it must be allowed , that the investigation is one of interest and importance , and we trust that arrangements may be made for the systematic continuance of solar observations in such localities as will ensure to us a daily picture of the sun 's disk .
The influence of blank days in diminishing the value of a series of sun .
observations is very manifest .
We have been able to record the behaviour across the sun 's disk of 421 groups of Carrington 's series out of a total number of 885 groups , and we have been able to record the same behaviour for 373 out of 544 groups observed at Kew .
Thus , out of a total of 1429 groups , we have only been able to record the behaviour of 794 .
Nor are the records which we have obtained so perfect as we could wish , on account of blank days , which make interpolations necessary .
It is therefore of much importance for the future of such researches as the present , that there should be several observing-stations so placed that we may reckon on having at least a daily picture of the sun 's disk .
It will be easily seen that such observations are very different from experiments , which may be multiplied ad libitum ; for in this case Nature gives us in a year or in ten years a certain amount of information , and no more , while it depends upon ourselves to make a good use of the information which she affords .
It is already universally acknowledged that we ought to make the best possible use of the few precious moments of a total eclipse ; but such observations must necessarily be incomplete unless they are followed up by the equally important , if more laborious , task of recording the sun 's surface from day to day .

aTlie Decomposition of Water by Zinc in conjunction with a more Negative Metal .
" By J. H. Gladstone , Ph. D. , F.B.S. , and Alfred Tribe , F.C.S. Deceived February 8 , 1872 .
Pure zinc is incapable of decomposing pure wrater , even at 100 ' C. , but at a considerably higher temperature it is known to combine with its oxygen .
Davy exposed pure water for two days to the action of a pile of silver and zinc plates , separated only by pasteboard , without obtaining any hydrogen ; Buff , however , has shown that a very minute trace of gas can be formed at the ordinary temperature by a pair of zinc and platinum plates .
During a series of experiments , of which we have already published an instalment , it occurred to us to ascertain whether by bringing the two metals closer together , and so increasing the electrical tension of the liquid , we could effect the same combination of zinc with oxygen at the ordinary temperature which takes place without the second metal at a very high 1872 .

7*7 12*3 The first action , therefore , was about five times as great as in the case of the copper , and it diminished more rapidly , doubtless through the zinc becoming more quickly protected by oxide .
Lest it might be contended that the free oxygen , usually present in distilled water , had been the means of starting this action , the experiment was repeated with water as free from oxygen as could be obtained by boil-ing .
One metre of the same zinc-foil , covered with copper , was employed , and the result was nearly as before , 40 cub. centims. of gas being obtained the first day at the mean temperature of 9 ' C. This arrangement was taken advantage of to examine the effect of a high temperature .
Without removing the delivery-tube , the contents of the flask were heated to near 100 ' C. , when 123* 5 cub. centims. of hydrogen were given off in ten minutes .
The apparatus was allowed to cool , with the mouth of the tube under water , when the production of gas became small again , and after two days it was again heated nearly to the boiling-point , when it gave off 93*4 cub , centims. in ten minutes ; after another period of two days it gave 64*1 cub , centims. and after three days more 132*1 cub. centims. in the first thirty minutes , 108*4 in the second thirty minutes , 94*3 in the third , and 89*9 in the fourth .
Iron and lead , under similar circumstances , also decomposed pure water , and the action of magnesium w*as greatly increased by conjunction with copper .
The effect of the more negative metal was the same as would have been produced by an increase of heat .
In a practical point of view this experiment may serve as a ready means of preparing pure hydrogen ; in a theoretical point of view , its interest seems to lie in the fact that the dissociation of a binary compound by means of two metals may take place at infinitesimally short distances , when it would not take place where the layer of liquid is enough to offer lesistanee to the current , and also in the correlation between this force and heat* .

smooth , the other rough with electrolytically-deposited copper ; these Ivvere separated from thin plates of zinc merely by pieces of muslin , and the metals were folded over at each end and hammered together .
Each couple was placed in water , and for some days very minute bubbles of gas formed , r but only at the junction of the metals , and about equally in each case .
As might be expected , this zinc in conjunction with copper is capable \ 0f decomposing other liquids than water .
Chloroform yields readily to its i power , and iodide of ethyl , which Prof. Frankland decomposed by zinc only at a great heat , is split up rapidly at the ordinary temperature .

Received March 6 , 1872 .
About twelve years have elapsed since I submitted to the Royal Society , partly in conjunction with M. Cahours , a series of papers* on the remarkable group of phosphorus compounds , the existence of which was first pointed out by M. Paul Thenard as far back as 1846 .
These researches were devoted to the investigation of the tertiary and quartary derivatives of phosphoretted hydrogen , exclusively accessible by the methods then at our disposal .
The study of the primary and secondary phosphines , the examination of which promised even more noteworthy results than that of the bodies then investigated , still remained to be achieved .
New tasks of life have since that time presented themselves , and I have not been able to devote myself as much to research as in former days .
Nevertheless , numerous attempts were made to procure the primary and i secondary phosphines , which were clearly indicated by theory and partly I even by M. Thenard 's early observations .
For along time , however , these experiments proved unsuccessful , and it was only in the course of last summer that I at last discovered an easy method for their production .
I may now fairly hope to complete an inquiry , the first part of which the Royal Society have done me the honour of inserting in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' -ft still some time will be required for surveying a field which appears to expand as one advances in its investigation , and I therefore beg leave to present to the Society the results of my observations in the measure as they are obtained , even before the whole investigation be terminated .
