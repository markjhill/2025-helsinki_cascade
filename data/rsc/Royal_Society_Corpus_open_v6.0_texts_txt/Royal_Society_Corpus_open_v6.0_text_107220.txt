Extract of a Letter from the Rev. John Brinkley , D. D. F. R. S. Andrew 's Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin , to the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne , D. D. R. S. Astronomer Royal , on the annual Parallax of o Lyrre .
Read April 12 , 18to .
I HAVE now had sufficient experience of my eight feet circle , to be highly satisfied with it , and have arrived at one conclusion , that it is of importance in astronomy .
My observations on a Lyrae for the purpose of discovering an annual parallax now amount to 47 in number , viz. 22 near opposition , and 25 near conjunction , and the mean of these gives a result of 2 , " 52 as the parallax of the annual orbit for that star , and I have no doubt that it exceeds 2 " .
My observations of different circumpolar stars , and of the same star in different states of the thermometer , seem to require a small alteration in the numbers of Dr. BRADLEY'S formula for refraction .
The formlla so altered is beight of barom .
SOQ Refraction = 56 , " 9 X tang .

By means cf this formula , the observations of circumpolar stars considerably distant , give the same co-latitude to a great degree of exactness .
