These Addresses were unanimously adopted by the Society .
The following letter was read from G. G. Anson , Esq. , addressed to the President , enclosing a specimen of a deposit with which nine acres of land near Exeter , belonging to Lord Radnor , had been covered after the subsidence of a flood , and which was sent by H.R.H. Prince Albert , F.R.S. : ?
" Buckingham Palace , June 8 , 1840 .
" My dear Lord , " His Royal Highness Prince Albert has commanded me to forward to you the enclosed specimen , which has been sent up to His Royal Highness from Lord Radnor 's place near Exeter , where nine acres of land were covered with this curious substance after a flood had subsided .
His Royal Highness thinks it very probable that the subject may already have been brought before the Royal Society , but in case it should not have been , he sends the accompanying packet .
It is said that a good deal of it has been applied to the purpose of making waistcoats for poor people .
" Believe me , " My dear Lord , " Yours very faithfully , " G. G. Anson .
" The Marquis of Northampton , President of the Royal Society .
