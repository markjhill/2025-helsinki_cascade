178 A Search for Possible New Members of the Inactive Series of Gases .
By Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. ( Received June 22 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1908 .
) The gases of the inactive series are five in number , if the emanations from radium , thorium , and actinium be excluded .
Beginning with helium , of atomic weight 4 , neon follows , with atomic weight 20 ; then argon 40 , krypton 82 , and xenon 128 .
It is conceivable that a gas lighter than helium might be found ; an attempt was made by Mr. J. E. Coats , working in my laboratory in 1906 , to isolate such a gas , but without success.* The residues " 14 " and " 15 , " consisting of helium and neon , have now been exhaustively investigated by Mr. Watson.f There are gaps in the periodic table for two , or possibly three , gases of the inactive series of atomic weight higher than that of xenon .
Owing to the kindness of M. Georges Claude , M. Helbronner , and the directors of the " Societe Air Liquid , " all the heavier portions of gas remaining after the fractional distillation of no less than 120 tons of air were delivered here from their works at Boulogne , near Paris .
The investigation was carried out almost entirely by Prolessor Moore , to whom the account which follows is due.| .
As will be seen , no positive result has been obtained ; but it is rendered exceedingly unlikely that any stable gas of the inert series with atomic weight higher than that of xenon exists in the atmosphere .
It is possible to go further ; it may be stated with certainty that if such heavier gases exist they must he found in the atmosphere .
From the known gradation of properties in passing from helium to xenon , it is certain that the missing elements must also be gases ; and it is almost equally certain that they would form no compounds .
The methods of separation of these gases , though laborious , are simple ; it is not possible to overlook them , or to fail to recognise them spectroscopically , if present .
Hence it follows that , if they are not found in the atmosphere , they either do not exist at all or they are so unstable that they decompose or " disintegrate " during the processes of separation .
Now , three gases are known which do " disintegrate " very rapidly , and which are as inactive as those of the argon group ; these are the emanations * See ' Proceedings , ' A , vol. 78 , p. 479 .

from radium , thorium , and actinium .
While the half-life period of the first is 3-8 days , that of the second is 54 seconds , and of the third 4 ?
seconds .
Attempts to determine the molecular weights of the emanations of radium and thorium have been made by P. Curie and Danne ; by Kutherford and Miss Brooks ; by Bumstead and Wheeler ; and by Makower .
Curie and Danne* obtained the number 176 ; Bumstead and Wheeler , f 180 ; Makower 's first experiment gave 170 ; and Butherford and Miss Brooks arrived at a similar number , for the radium emanation .
As all the inactive gases are monatomic , it is to be presumed that the emanations resemble them in this respect ; hence the molecular weight is identical with the atomic weight .
The atomic weight of radium emanation may therefore be accepted as about 175 .
The molecular weight of thorium emanation has also been attempted by Makower , j but without very definite results ; all that can be said is that it does not greatly differ from that of the radium emanation .
It will conduce to clearness to reproduce a portion of the periodic table , giving the atomic weights of elements near the argon group:\#151 ; I. II .

It is reasonable to suppose that the instability increases with rise of atomic weight ; and the close approach of the atomic weight 172 to the results of the attempts to determine it experimentally lends additional probability to the order chosen .

There is , however , another view which should be stated .
It is this : it is remarkable that not one single element in Column VI has been detected .
The natural conclusion is that owing to some unknown cause the elements in this column are peculiarly unstable .
This would lead to the possibility that actinium emanation , the least stable of the three , should be placed in this column .
Eecent experiments by P. B. Perkins , * made with the accumulated experience of Messrs. Boltwood and Bumstead , render it not improbable that previous diffusion experiments have underestimated the molecular weight of radium emanation , and that its molecular and atomic weight should somewhat exceed that of mercury .
If this be 200 , then the radium emanation would fall in Column VII , with atomic weight 216 ; and the atomic weight of 260 would be ascribed to the emanation from thorium .
This , however , raises the interesting question which , however , cannot be discussed here , whether an element like thorium , of atomic weight 232 , can yield a " product " of higher atomic weight , 260 .
It must however , be pointed out that no experiment of the nature of that detailed in Professor Moore 's paper can be regarded as final ; it is always open to say that had 1000 tons of air been worked up for rare gases , a stable gas heavier than xenon might have been found .
But I think that the balance of probability is in the direction indicated .
