) In a former paper* we expressed doubt whether the methods employed by Dr. Maurice Nicloux and other French observers for accurately determining the percentage of chloroform in the blood of anaesthetised animals were capable of yielding such satisfactory results as those obtained by Nicloux when known quantities of chloroform were added to blood vitro ; on the ground that the mixing of blood and chloroform vitro is an essentially different process from that which takes place during the physiological process of inhalation , since it has been shown that , during anaesthesia , chloroform associates itself particularly with the red corpuscles .
In order to test the validity of our criticism , and to enable the results obtained by the French observers to be correlated with our own , and also to gain an idea as to how far the method employed by Nicloux is capable of giving reliable results in the case of tissues to which our method may not be readily applicable , we have made a series of parallel estimations by the two methods on the blood of anaesthetised animals .
In our experiments with the method of Nicloux , we followed closely the procedure which he has detailed^ , and we take this opportunity to express our indebtedness to Dr. Nicloux for his kindness in supplying us with the distillation-apparatus which he uses , and in giving us a demonstration of his method .
As Nicloux points out , J the chief difficulty in his method consists in determining exactly the end-point of the reaction which occurs in titrating with silver hitrate , using potassium chromate as an t indicator .
While taking every care to hit the end-point as closely as possible , we uniformly slightly over-stepped rather than under-stepped the mark .
In carrying out the method , we found it necessary to use caustic soda made * ' Roy .

I. Analyses of Chloroform by the Carius and by the Nicloux Method ( Dumas* Deaction ) .
The chloroform used in these experiments was kindly distilled for us by Dr. J. Wade of Guy 's Hospital .
It had a boiling-point of 61T4'\#151 ; 61'15 ' C. at 760 mm. and a specific gravity T5088 15'/ 15 ' .
The results of the analyses are given in Table I and Table II .

Determination of Chloroform in the Arterial Blood of Ancesthetised Animals by our Method and that of Nicloux ( Reaction ) .
The experiments were conducted on cats .
The animals were anaesthetised by ether , and the necessary operations for introducing cannulae into the trachea and carotid artery were performed .
The tracheal cannula was fitted to a Chauveau 's valve and chloroform administered by a Woulffs bottle .
Samples of blood were taken before the administration of chloroform , and at some selected period in the course of the anaesthesia a measured quantity of blood ( 20 to 30 c.c. ) was withdrawn , and this was divided up into various proportions for analysis by the two methods .
For the purpose of the Nicloux estimations some samples were allowed to clot before estimation , * some were treated with sodium oxalate to prevent clotting , others with hirudin , and others were defibrinated by shaking with mercury .
In the case of blood withdrawn at the asphyxial point it is , in the case of cats , very difficult to weigh any sample before clotting takes place , since this occurs with great rapidity .

Experiments in whichk the Blood was allowed to clot before treatment with acidified Alcohol .
Varying weights of blood were taken on which to carry out duplicate experiments .
During distillation , the clotted blood was found to become detached as a disc of leathery consistence , about the size and thickness of * Dr. Nicloux has kindly informed us , by letter , of a detail that we did not gather from his paper , viz. , that in his observations the blood is withdrawn with a syringe and immediately mixed with alcohol so that it does not clot en mass .

In the last series of experiments the cat was treated with hirudin in such proportion as to render the blood incoagulable for some minutes .
" We find that this is an excellent substance for checking the tendency to clotting , which is so liable to occur in cats at the moment of asphyxia .

1 .
The method of chloroform determination , based on Dumas ' reaction , though not possessing a very high degree of precision as an exact chemical method , as is apparent from a comparison of Tables I and II , is sufficiently accurate for most practical purposes and , as used by Dr. Nicloux , is a simple and rapid method , and one capable of giving satisfactory results for the estimation of small quantities of chloroform in air and in simple solution in such liquids as urine , etc. 2 .
In the case of the blood of anaesthetised animals , if the blood for analysis is allowed to clot before admixture with acid alcohol , the results by Nicloux ' method are uniformly too low .
An inspection of Tables III and V will show that results concordant amongst themselves are obtained when sensibly equal quantities of blood are taken , but , as might be expected , the figures decrease the larger the amount of blood used .
In cases where smaller amounts of blood are taken and , consequently , the amounts of chloroform dealt with are very small , the results are often near the truth ; but this , we think , is largely due to the inherent difficulty in the method as regards the determination of the end-point .
3 .
In cases where the clotting of blood was prevented by oxalate , the results more nearly approach those given by the methods we have previously adopted , but still are somewhat lower .
If we take the results given in Table Y , the average percentage of chloroform indicated by our method is 0'0319 , and by that of Nicloux in the case of oxalated blood is 0*0259 .
In our method we are satisfied that the average maximum error is not more than 5 per cent. , generally considerably less .
We find the difference between the results given by our method and that of Nicloux ' method averages 19 per cent. 4 .
In the single experiment quoted with hirudin , the figures by the two methods are remarkably concordant .

5 .
On account of the variable and low results obtained with clotted blood , it may be inferred that the method of Nicloux may give low results when applied to organs or tissues which do not disintegrate when boiled with acid alcohol .
We take this opportunity of stating that the expenses of the foregoing work were defrayed out of a grant made by the Royal Society .

( Received February 27 , \#151 ; Read February 28 , 1907 .
) In a previous paper of this series* it has been shown that the production of prussic acid by the seeds or beans ( " Lima beans " ) of Phaseolus lunatus is due to the interaction of a cyanogenetic glucoside , phaseolunatin , with an enzyme , both these substances being proved to exist in the seeds .
Phaseolunatin was proved to have the composition and constitution of a dextrose ether of acetonecyanohydrin , but it was not then obtained in sufficient quantity to ascertain precisely the structure of the dextrose residue in the glucoside .
Recently , however , !
large supplies of " Java beans " ( the beans produced by Phaseolus lunatus grown in Java ) have been imported into this country , and we are indebted to Dr. Bernard Dyer for a small consignment of these beans , which has constituted the raw material from which the considerable quantities of phaseolunatin required in the course of the present investigation have been prepared .
Since the publication of our previous paper , it has been asserted by Kohn-Abrest } that these " Java beans " contain not one , but several cyanogenetic glucosides , and that none of these yield acetone on hydrolysis by hot dilute mineral acids or by the glucosidolytic enzymes present in the beans .
We have considered it necessary , therefore , to examine carefully the glucosidic product obtained from " Java beans " by the process originally used by usS in the investigation of the beans of Phaseolus lunatus obtained from Mauritius and we have been unable to detect the presence of any other cyanogenetic glucoside in Java beans except phaseolunatin , identical in all * Dunstan and Henry , 4 Roy .
