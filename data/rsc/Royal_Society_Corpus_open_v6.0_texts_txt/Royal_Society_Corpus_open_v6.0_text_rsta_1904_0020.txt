Introduction .
The following work was undertaken with a view to obtaining data for the tentative application of Van der Waals ' equation to concentrated solutions .
It is evidently probable that if the ordinary gas equation be applicable to dilute solutions , then that of Van der Waals ' , or one of an analogous form , should apply to concentrated solutions\#151 ; that is , to solutions having large osmotic pressures .
Saturated solutions were taken for investigation because they presumably have the greatest osmotic pressures , and also because there is reason to believe that , in concentrated solutions at a given temperature , the greater the concentration the less the relative dissociation .
For the purpose in view , measurements of volume , pressure and temperature are required .
Volume .
This term of the equation is deducible from observations of the density of a saturated solution and of the solubility of the salt at varying temperatures .
In Part I. , I give the densities and solubilities obtained , together with a description of the methods and apparatus used .
Pressure .
I am at present engaged , with the collaboration of Mr. E. G. Hartley , in testing a method of directly observing large osmotic pressures .
Should the method fail , I propose to determine the vapour pressures of the saturated solutions at different temperatures and from these calculate the corresponding osmotic pressures .
The observations and details will be given in Part IT .

The temperatures at which the densities , solubilities and osmotic pressures were determined are given with those quantities respectively .
Part III .
will be devoted to the application of the results to theory .
The selection of the particular salts whose solutions were examined was governed by the following considerations :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) Fairly soluble salts should be used , so that differences between the ordinary phenomena of dilute and those appertaining to concentrated solutions may be the more marked ; ( 2 .
) They should have as wide a range of molecular weights as possible , so as to bring into prominence any effect the interacting masses may have on the space occupied by the molecules ; ( 3 .
) For the purpose of comparing members of the same family of elements the salts should be isomorphous , the presumption being that isomorphous salts give similarly constructed molecules in solution .
PART I. ( A ) .
Determination of the Constants .
The densities were obtained by the following method : An approximately saturated solution was kept in contact with crystals of the salt at a definite temperature by means of a thermostat , and continuously stirred .
When a sufficient length of time had elapsed , a pyknometer , whose capacity was known , was immersed in the solution and filled to a mark , then washed and dried by means of pure alcohol , and weighed against a counterpoise which had been similarly washed and dried .
The solubilities Were determined by washing the contents of the pyknometers into platinum crucibles and weighing them after evaporating to dryness .
It was found in the course of the work that , in the case of very soluble salts , this method was not satisfactory , because a crust of salt formed on top of the solution in the platinum crucible , and the accumulation of steam under it , on finding its way out , carried particles of solution with it .
Glass bulbs , represented in fig. 1 and made of Jena glass , were therefore substituted for the platinum crucibles and the solution evaporated to dryness in them .
This was effected by passing a current of dry air through the tubes while they were being heated to 110'-170 ' in an air oven , the air current and the PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF SATUKATED SOLUTIONS .
heating being continued until the bulbs had attained a constant weight .
The air current was obtained by means of a Fleuss pump .
The same filling of a pyknometer gave , therefore , both the density and the solubility .
As a check on the latter , the contents of a pyknometer were occasionally analysed .
m.m. Pyknometers .
At first Sprengel pyknometers of various shapes and sizes were tried , but were found to be unsatisfactory .
This was because it was almost impossible to prevent the solution from crystallizing in the capillary during the time the level of the liquid was [ T ?
being adjusted to the mark .
The following was the form finally adopted and found quite satisfactory .
A pear-shaped bulb , of about 5 cub. centims. capacity , terminating above in a stem composed of a graduated capillary 120 millims. long , and below in a finer capillary , bent as in fig. 2 , was used for salts of medium solubility .
For somewhat insoluble salts a similar pyknometer , but of about 11 cub. , centims. capacity , was found to be more suitable , while for very soluble salts , such as sodium sulphate , which have great differences in solubility at different temperatures , it was necessary to have similar pyknometers made of thicker glass , so that when the crystals formed and practically filled the whole of the bulb , the latter would withstand the pressure .
It was also found necessary to make the capillaries of a larger internal diameter , so as to be able to fill quickly .
And the shape of the lower capillary ( see fig. 3 ) was altered and its end fitted with a glass cap to prevent the solution from " creeping " out when on the balance .
The stem was also fitted with a cap to prevent evaporation .
Determination of the Capacities of the Pyknometers .
Before determining the capacities , the pyknometers were heated rapidly and repeatedly to 200 ' C. , being allowed to cool to the temperature of the room between each heating ; by this means it was hoped that the gradual shrinking in volume would be accelerated .
The graduated capillaries were then calibrated by the usual method of running a thread of mercury along the bore , measuring its length , and then weighing it .
The capacities were found by weighing the pyknometers filled with water at 0 ' C. and at 90 ' C. respectively ; the volume occupied by the water was taken to be that given in Landolt and Bornstein 's tables for water which is air-free .
The difference between the capacities thus determined gave the expansion from 0 ' C. to 90 ' C. , and for intermediate temperatures it was assumed to be proportional to the temperature interval ; this assumption was tested with one of the pyknometers , and it was found that the resulting difference was within the experimental errors .
With the 11 cub. centim. pyknometers , however , it was deemed advisable to examine the error more closely , and for this purpose the capacities were determined at five approximately equal intervals of temperature between 0 ' C. and 90 ' C. The numbers obtained were plotted against the corresponding temperatures , and a bent-ruler curve passed through the points ; the capacities for intermediate temperatures were taken from it .
The maximum difference between this curve and a line joining the penultimate observations represented a difference of '0015 cub. centim. This is a quantity which is barely greater than the experimental errors , as will be seen from the following numbers obtained with one of the pyknometers :\#151 ; Tempe- rature .

As the table used for the expansion of water gives numbers derived from air-free water , and as the pyknometers had been filled with water which had not been freed from dissolved air , it was thought possible that an error had been introduced in this way ; a pyknometer was therefore filled , in a vacuum , with water which had been boiled in that vacuum for three-quarters of an hour ; it was then withdrawn and brought , to a constant temperature in the thermostat and weighed in the usual manner .
The results of three observations carried out thus did not differ from those obtained with ordinary water by more than the latter differed among themselves .
Taking into consideration that the solutions themselves are not air-free , it was considered unnecessary to pursue the matter any further .
* This observation was one made with air-free water .
PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF SATURATED SOLUTIONS .
In weighing the pyknometers care was always taken that they should be slung on the balance in such a way that the end of the lower capillary was at a higher level than the level of the liquid in the stem ; this , as a rule , was sufficient to prevent any loss of weight by evaporation , but such observations as did show a loss were rejected .
Stirring .
The stirring was obtained by means of a small platinum rod , fitted with a two-bladed screw , suspended vertically in the solution , and rotated by a cord and a small electric motor .
The speed of rotation could be varied from 2 to 20 revolutions per second .
During the last two years of the course of this work the separate motors were replaced by a shafting driven by an electric motor ; pulleys of various sizes were fixed on it and driving cords taken to the stirrers as required .
This shafting also worked the Fleuss pump mentioned above .
Constant Temperatures .
At 0 ' C. the beaker containing the solution was surrounded by ice and water .
At 15 ' C. it was placed in a copper vessel , in which was suspended a thermostat , and through which a current of cold water passed .

From 30 ' C. to 90 ' C. the solution was placed in a platinum beaker of 300 cub. centims. capacity which formed part of a D Arsonval thermostat .
The platinum beaker ( see fig. 4 ) , having a flange welded on to it three-VOL .
CCIII.---A .
2 C quarters of an inch from the top , was passed through the top plate of the thermostat and soldered in position .
The body of the thermostat was of copper and held about three litres of water , and the expansion and contraction of this was enough to actuate the flexible diaphragm ( the iron plate of the receiver of a telephone ) sufficiently to keep the temperature of the thermostat constant to about 0''2 C. ; that is to say , that for 2 or 3 hours before taking an observation , the temperature in the beaker would only show , at the utmost , a change of 0'*05 C. , but in the course of 24 hours after setting the temperature of the thermostat , and consequently that of the solution , might slowly rise or slowly fall to the extent mentioned , and then remain constant to 0o,05 C. Means employed for Determining the Point of Saturation .
After numerous experiments the following general method was found to be the most satisfactory .
The thermostat was set at 90 ' C. , and water , together with a quantity of salt more than necessary to saturate it , placed in the platinum beaker , and the mixture stirred very rapidly until it was thought that saturation had been attained ; an observation of the density was then made , and the stirring continued for a further period of 2 or 3 hours , and then another density determination made .
If the two observations agreed within the experimental errors , it was considered that saturation had been practically reached ; if the two observations did not agree , the stirring was continued and the density taken at intervals until it became constant .
The temperature of the thermostat was then lowered 2 degrees , and after stirring 2 or 3 hours the density again taken , The mean of this and of the constant density previously mentioned was considered to be the density of a saturated solution at the mean of the respective temperatures .
The temperature of the thermostat was then lowered to the next point of observation , and after 2 or 3 hours ' stirring the density was taken ; water was then added to the solution and the stirring continued until the density , taken at intervals of from 4 to 12 hours , was constant\#151 ; the mean of the first and the last observations , which usually differed by an amount slightly greater than the experimental errors , was taken as giving the true density .
The process was then repeated for the other temperatures .
It should be noted that whether working with supersaturated or an unsaturated solution , the liquid is always stirred in contact with a large excess of solid salt .
In the case of salts whose solubilities decrease with an increase of temperature , the process is reversed ; with Na2S04 , for example , which has a maximum solubility at 32''5 C. , the thermostat was set at 33 ' C. , and stirring continued until constant density was obtained ; the temperature was then raised 1 ' C. and the density again determined , and the mean of this and of the constant density above mentioned was taken as the true density of a solution saturated at the mean of the respective temperatures .
The temperature of the thermostat was then raised to the next point of observation , the density taken , boiling water added and a constant density PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF SATURATED SOLUTIONS .
obtained , the numbers being " meaned " as before .
The process was then continued for the next higher temperature , and so on .
The object of adding boiling water is to make sure that the solution is unsaturated , for if cold water were added the temperature of the solution would fall , and if the rate of attaining saturation be greater than the rate at which the solution comes back to the constant temperature , you get a solution supersaturated with respect to that temperature .
It will therefore be seen that the method adopted resolves itself into this : at any given temperature , two observations of density and solubility are taken ; one is obtained by stirring a supersaturated solution in contact with the solid salt , the other by stirring an unsaturated solution in contact with an excess of salt\#151 ; and the true density or solubility is considered to be the mean of the two observations .
In the earlier part of this work it was found that , in many cases , a very long time elapsed before the densities obtained , when starting with an unsaturated solution , approached sufficiently closely to that derived by starting with a supersaturated one\#151 ; this was partially remedied by increasing the speed of stirring from 2 to 20 revolutions per second\#151 ; hut even then there was generally a difference in the two densities of some few units in the 4th decimal place .
The cause of this discrepancy was eventually traced to the fact that a considerable length of time was also required for the point of saturation to be attained by a supersaturated solution , even when stirred in contact with its salt .
It was owing to this that some 300 density and solubility determinations had to be discarded\#151 ; for preliminary observations had shown that concordant results could be obtained by merely covering the top of the beaker with a glass perforated for the stirrer to pass through , and removing the plate while the pyknometer was being filled .
At the higher temperatures the removal of the plate caused a fall in the temperature of the solution and a consequent supersaturation .
This , however , was not suspected ( because when the results were plotted the curve was regular ) until I was dealing with very soluble salts , which , on the removal of the plate , tended to form crusts of salt on the surface of the solution .
The difficulty was overcome by closing the beaker by an india-rubber stopper , which was perforated for the stirrer , the thermometer , and the pyknometer .
The latter was closed at the upper end by a tap attached by rubber tubing .
The tap served two purposes : it was kept closed on immersing the pyknometer , so that no liquid could enter during the time that the pyknometer was attaining the temperature of the solution , and it was closed after filling the pyknometer , so that no liquid could flow back during the withdrawal of the rubber stopper .
As an extreme example of the necessity of giving an unsaturated solution plenty of time to attain saturation , and also as showing the importance of having a sufficiency of salt in contact with the solution , I extract the following numbers from my notebook .
An unsaturated solution of thallium alum , together with a quantity of the salt , was placed in the beaker , which was at the constant temperature of 61'*0 C. This was stirred for 12 hours at the rate of 10 to 20 revolutions per second ; at the 2 c 2 end of this period the density was found to be 1*2539 ( temperature 61o,00 C. ) .
Having reason to believe , from previous work , that saturation had been reached , the temperature of the thermostat was lowered 1 ' C. and the solution stirred for another 3 hours ; its density was then 1*2546 ( temperature 59''85 C. ) .
The next day it was 1'2555 ( temperature 59'*90 C. ) .
" " " 1*2572 ( " 60''00 C. ) .
" " " 1-2591 ( " 60'*00 G ) .
Between each observation about 10 hours ' continuous stirring was given to the solution , and all the time there had been about 5 cub. centims. of solid salt in contact with the solution ; another 20 cub. centims. of salt was then added , and the stirring continued for 12 hours , with a resulting density 1*2810 ( temperature 60'*00 C. ) .
And a further 12 hours gave 1*2813 ( temperature 60*00 C. ) .
On the other hand , the following shows the reverse phenomenon , i.e. , that a considerable time must elapse before a supersaturated solution attains its true point of saturation .
A solution of Na2S04 , saturated at 60 ' C. , was heated to the constant temperature of 75 ' C. ( it must be remembered that Na2S04 .
is more soluble at 60 ' C. than at 75 ' C. ) and stirred at the rate of 13 revolutions per second in contact with the anhydrous salt for 3|r hours ; the density of the solution was found to be 1*2738 ( temperature 75'*00 C. ) .
The next day , after 12 hours ' stirring , the density was 1*2729 ( temperature 75'*00 C. ) ; 20 cub. centims. of boiling water was then added ( if cold water had been added , as before explained , the solution would have become supersaturated ) , and after 12 hours ' stirring its density was 1*2727 ( temperature 75'*00 G ) .
Where it was suspected that the solutions , when at the higher temperatures , might decompose non-reversibly , the observations for the lower temperatures were first recorded , in the manner already outlined , and those for the higher temperatures were obtained by heating to the constant temperature required and stirring the solution until the density was constant ; the temperature was then lowered by 1 or 2 degrees , and after a sufficient length of time the density again determined ; the mean of this last observation , and of the constant density first obtained , was considered to be the density of a solution saturated at the mean of the corresponding temperatures .
The following are the important points to be observed in obtaining a saturated solution :\#151 ; ( 1 ) A sufficiency of solid salt should always be in contact with the solution ; ( 2 ) A thorough stirring should be continuously kept up ; ( 3 ) A sufficient length of time should be allowed to elapse before taking the required observation .
This last condition seems to depend on the nature of the salt , the speed of stirring , and on the temperature .
1 had hoped to have been able to determine both the rate of attainment of saturation , and the time at which it is attained , by observing the change in the electric conductivity of the solution while it is becoming saturated , and I have made a few somewhat unsatisfactory experiments on the method , but hope to be able to return to it shortly .
Measurement of Temperature .
Thermometers whose graduations were sufficiently open to allow of an estimation to 0''01 C. were used .
They were standardized at Kew , and the rise of the zero point was determined after an interval of 18 months .
The rise of the zero point was assumed to be proportional to the elapsed time , and all observations are corrected on that assumption .
Corrections were also applied for the emergent column by suspending an auxiliary thermometer half way up the exposed stem and calculating in the usual manner ; in no case did this correction amount to more than 0o,37 C. The temperatures given in the tables are corrected to the hydrogen scale of the Bureau International at Paris .
Experimental Errors .
On page 192 I have already given an example of the results obtained in determining the capacities , and it will be seen that the largest difference between any two observations at the same temperature is '0012 cub. centim. , which is roughly '01 per cent. To give an idea of the order of accuracy of the observations of density and solubility , the actual figures obtained with NaCl are appended below .
NaCl was selected because the differences between the two sets of densities are fairly typical , while , on account of the small change in the solubility of the salt , those between the solubilities , besides being typical , show the experimental errors without the necessity of correcting for small changes of temperature .

In solubilities , however , the largest difference is '06 at 75 ' C. , and this corresponds to an error of 0*16 per cent. This large difference in the two percentage errors is remarkable , and I have not yet been able to account for it\#151 ; it is manifested in most of the salts hitherto worked with .
A fact which may possibly throw light on the subject is noticeable in the above table , and is one which most of the salts also show , namely , that the solubilities obtained when starting with an unsaturated solution , tend to be slightly less than those obtained when starting with a supersaturated one , and this although the corresponding densities are practically identical .
I hope to investigate the matter while determining the electric conductivities of these solutions .

The Densities and Solubilities at the Boiling-point .
Attempts were made to determine these in a Beckmann apparatus , but without success\#151 ; the difficulty of keeping a constant temperature being too great\#151 ; so recourse was had to a method first suggested by , I believe , Buchanan .
In the apparatus shown in fig. 5 , the outer glass tube A contains water , and the inner tube B the salt and solution ; by boiling the water vigorously and closing the side tube C , steam , passing through the tube D , is forced to bubble rapidly through the solution ( D is graduated in centimetres so that the level of the solution may be estimated while the pyknometer is in the solution ) .
The steam , if passed rapidly enough through the solution , stirs it thoroughly , and the temperature rises up to the boiling-point of the saturated solution and remains constant at this point as long as there is enough undissolved salt left .
The constancy of the temperature therefore indicates that saturation is attained .
Determination of the Density .
When it is seen that the steam is passing freely through the solution , an india-rubber plug , through which the thermometer and pyknometer pass , and which is also PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF SATURATED SOLUTIONS .
perforated to allow the steam to escape , is inserted into the top of the inner tube .
When the temperature becomes constant , the pyknometer , with the tap closed and with the end of the lower capillary covered by a filter , is forced through the stopper , so that the bulb and capillary are completely immersed ; when the temperature is again constant , the tap is opened and the pyknometer quickly filled by gentle suction , and the tap closed .
The filter is then removed from the end of the capillary , the level of the solution in the stem is read , and both thermometer and pyknometer are taken out of the solution by the withdrawal of the rubber stopper ; the pyknometer is then washed , dried , and weighed in the usual manner .
It was found advisable to use the pyknometers described on p. 191 and shown in fig. 3 , not only on account of the pressure set up when the salt crystallized out , but because they could be more quickly filled , and therefore less condensed steam formed in the stem ; a further reason for using these pyknometers was that the larger bore of the stem and lower capillary enabled them to be emptied with less difficulty .
Determination of the Solubility .
When the pyknometer had been weighed , its contents were emptied into a beaker , and the solution washed into a Jena glass bulb ( described on p. 190 and shown in fig. 1 ) , and evaporated to dryness as before .
Great difficulty was experienced in emptying the pyknometers when filled with the solutions of rubidium nitrate , thallium nitrate , or caesium alum , and the only way of doing so was by alternate heating and cooling when completely immersed in nearly boiling water\#151 ; the operation taking in some cases as long as 6 hours .
It is interesting to note that on testing the boiled saturated solutions of the nitrates of sodium and rubidium for nitrites by means of fuchsine , the conversion of a small quantity of the nitrate into the nitrite was distinctly indicated .
) Modification of Apparatus Necessary to Meet the Case of Extremely Soluble Salts .
In the case of the nitrates of rubidium and thallium , which are extremely soluble at the boiling-point , the apparatus described on the foregoing page was found to be unsuitable , because a constant temperature could not be maintained for a sufficient length of time to allow the pyknometer to be filled .
Two things are essential for maintaining the solutions at their boiling-points : that thorough stirring should take place , and that there should be a sufficiency of undissolved salt left in contact with the solution ; with extremely soluble salts the larger quantity of steam necessary for thorough stirring dissolves so much salt that by the time this stirring is attained the solution is nearly clear , and shortly after , all the salt is dissolved and the temperature begins to fall .
A modification of the method was adopted in which steam , generated in a boiler A ( see fig. 6 ) , is forced through a tube B and delivered at the bottom of the large test-tube C , which contains the solution .
The test-tube is immersed in an oil bath D Thermometiers .

| 3 Pyknometer Solution maintained at a temperature close to that of the boiling-point of the saturated solution , the oil in the bath being vigorously stirred by a stirrer driven from the main laboratory shafting .
When the temperature of the oil bath was below the boiling-point , salt dissolved ; when above , salt was thrown out of solution .
By carePHYSICAL CONSTANTS OP SATURATED SOLUTIONS .
fully adjusting the temperature of the oil bath , two densities could be obtained , one while the temperature of the solution was close to the boiling-point , but slowly rising , and the other when it was above the boiling-point , but close to it and slowly falling .
The former gave the density of a slightly unsaturated solution , and the latter that of a slightly supersaturated solution when referred to a solution saturated at its boiling-point .
The mean of these two observations was considered to he the density of the solution saturated at the boiling-point\#151 ; and similarly with the resulting solubilities .
The results obtained at the boiling-point were found not to be as concordant as those at the other temperatures ; doubtless the greater part of this is due to the exceptional difficulties of the experiments .
The following are some of the sources of error .
It was impossible to prevent the condensation of steam in the stem of the pyknometer , and it was therefore necessary to estimate the length of each drop , and add this length to the reading of the level in the stem .
There was also an error introduced by the fact that , for the purpose of reading its level , the solution had to he sucked into the cold part of the stem which projected through the indiarubber stopper ; on reaching this colder part , salt immediately crystallises out ; the total volume thus changes , and the observed level is not that which the solution would otherwise have attained .
The maximum error possible from this cause was calculated for the case of rubidium nitrate , and was found to be such as to give an error in the density of 0'1 per cent. Another and a much more important source of error was that the reduction of pressure on the surface of the solution in the pyknometer , unavoidable when filling by suction , very often caused steam bubbles to form .
As it was essential to fill whilst a large excess of undissolved salt was still being stirred by the steam , the solution surrounding the pyknometer was often semi-opaque , and consequently it might happen that part of the space inside the pyknometer was occupied by an unseen steam bubble , and might thus be an unobserved source of error .
Numerous fillings had to be rejected on this account , the steam bubbles showing themselves on the withdrawal of the pyknometer from the solution .
The numbers tabulated below are those derived from fillings in which there were no observed steam bubbles .
Determination of the Temperature .
As mentioned above , the boiling-point of the saturated solution was considered to he the constant temperature which the solution and salt reached when steam was rapidly bubbled through them ; this temperature was indicated by mercury thermometers , and is given in the table of results .
They are , however , uncorrected for emergent column , because it was found to he practically impossible to apply a satisfactory correction .
It is hoped that , later on , when determining the osmotic pressures , * these boiling-points will be accurately ascertained by means of platinum .
* These experiments are in progress , hut not complete .

In the expectation of this the total pressures under which each solution was boiling when its density was taken was noted , and is given in the table .
This total pressure is made up of the barometric pressure , together with the pressure due to the height of the boiling liquid .
To ascertain the elfect of the latter , observations were made on the boiling-point of water of varying depths , and through which steam was being rapidly blown .
The results showed that the boiling-point was increased by an amount equal to that which a pressure equal to half the depth of the liquid would create ; this , of course , was what was to be anticipated , provided the stirring was thorough .
It was assumed that a similar result would hold for the solutions , and the total pressures given are those calculated on this basis .

The alkali chlorides were obtained from Messrs. Merck , and were sold as the purest they made ; the thallous chloride came from Messrs. Kahlbaum , and was also sold as pure .
The solutions of the potassium and sodium salts did not require filtering , and were tested for purity by an analysis of their chlorine contents .
The sodium salt giving 60'58 per cent , ( calculated 60*59 per cent. ) and the potassium 47*60 per cent , ( calculated 47*54 per cent. ) .
The rubidium chloride was tested spectroscopically for the presence of potassium and csesium by first locating the chief lines of these metals by observation of their spectra on the graduated circle of the spectroscope , and then exploring the rubidium spectrum for them .
No definite evidence of impurities was obtained .
An analysis of the chlorine content gave 29*34 per cent , ( calculated 29*32 per cent. ) .
From the appearance of the csesium chloride it was thought necessary to filter the solution and recrystallise several times ; the mother liquor of the first recrystallisation was distinctly yellow , that of the second faintly so , while the third was colourless .
A spectroscopic examination , similar to that mentioned above for the rubidium salt , revealed , it was thought , a trace of rubidium .
An analysis of the chlorine content gave 21*13 per cent , ( calculated 21*06 per cent. ) .
The thallous chloride was found to he free from lead , and an analysis of the thallium content gave 85*40 per cent , ( calculated 85*21 per cent. ) .
Owing to the insoluble nature of this salt , the solubility determination cannot he relied on to as great a degree of accuracy as in the other determinations .
The Sulphates .
The alkali sulphates came from Messrs. Merck , and were sold as their purest ; the thallium salt came from Messrs. Kahlbaum .
Neither the sodium nor the potassium salts required recrystallising , nor did their solutions require filtering ; analyses of their sulphuric acid contents gave for the sodium salt 67'37 per cent , ( calculated 67'57 percent .
) and for the potassium 55*20 per cent , ( calculated 55*12 per cent. ) .
Not having purchased enough of the rubidium salt , the balance was made good by treating pure rubidium carbonate ( also purchased from Messrs. Merck ) with pure sulphuric acid in just sufficient quantity to neutralise the solution , and then crystallising out .
The two quantities of salt were then added together and recrystallised , and the crystals examined spectroscopically , in the manner before stated , for potassium and caesium , but with no definite indication of either .
An analysis of the sulphuric acid content gave 36*05 per cent , ( calculated 35*99 per cent. ) .
The caesium sulphate was recrystallised three times , and the spectroscopic examination gave no definite indication of either potassium or rubidium .
An analysis of the sulphate content gave 26*62 per cent , ( calculated 26*55 per cent. ) .
The thallium sulphate was recrystallised three times and found to be free from lead .
An analysis of the thallium content gave 80*96 per cent , ( calculated 80*95 per cent. ) .
The Nitrates .
All the salts were Messrs. Merck 's purest , except the thallium salt , which came from Kahlbaum .
The alkali nitrates were all recrystallised two or three times , and were examined spectroscopically and found to be free from impurities .
The thallium nitrate , however , was found to contain some lead ; it was freed from this by repeated recrystallisation .
An analysis of the thallium content gave 76*89 per cent , ( calculated 76*69 per cent. ) .
On account of the difficulty of obtaining accurate analyses of the alkali nitrates they were not analysed , but after the first recrystallisation a series of densities and a corresponding series of solubilities at different temperatures were obtained , and these series were compared with similar series obtained from the solution of the crystals of the next recrystallisation .
The two differed by no more than the experimental errors .
During the evaporation to dryness in the Jena glass bulbs for the purpose of determining the solubilities , it was found that a trace of nitrate almost invariably came over with the condensed water , and those observations in which more than a brace came over were rejected .
It was also noticed that , except in the case of caesium nitrate , the dried salt remaining in the bulbs contained a trace of nitrites .
The quantities in both cases were so small that it was not considered necessary to apply any corrections to the resulting solubility .
PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF SATURATED SOLUTIONS .
The Alums .
The potassium alum purchased as pure from Messrs. Merck was found to contain a small quantity of both iron and ammonium , and repeated recrystallisation did not purify it .
Pure aluminium and pure potassium sulphates were therefore purchased , and the pure alum made from these .
An analysis of the sulphuric acid content of this salt , when recrystallised , gave 40'33 per cent , ( calculated 40'49 per cent. ) .
The remainder of the alums , purchased as pure from Messrs. Merck , were recrystallised several times , and the spectroscopic examination showed no impurities .
Analyses gave , for the rubidium salt , 36'69 per cent. SO ( calculation being 36'89 per cent. ) , and , for the caesium salt , 33'67 per cent. SO ( calculation being 33'80 per cent. ) .
The thallium alum was analysed by determining the thallous sulphate content , giving 39'29 per cent. , the calculated value being 39'43 per cent. It will be noticed that the tables of results give no values for potassium alum above 60 ' C. , for the rubidium alum above 70 ' C. , and for thallium alum above 60 ' C.\#151 ; this is because it was found that the prolonged heating at 68 ' C. , at 80 ' C. , and at 75 ' C. respectively decomposed the solutions , and a white insoluble precipitate was formed .
The caesium alum , however , could be heated to the boiling-point without decomposition .
The solubilities of the potassium and rubidium alums could not be determined to so close a degree of accuracy as that of the other salts , for it was almost impossible to dry the contents of the pyknometers to a constant weight , without decomposing the salt .
The method finally adopted was to evaporate to partial dryness in the Jena glass bulbs at 115 ' C. , then raise the temperature of the oven gradually to 175 ' C. ( dry air passing the while ) , and , when all perceptible moisture had been driven off , to heat the bulb gently with a naked flame , care being taken not to heat to a temperature high enough for the glass to give a sodium flame .
With caesium alum a constant weight was obtained by keeping the oven at 130 ' C. to 140 ' C. The Observed Densities and Solubilities .
In the following tables the numbers in each column are obtained as follows:\#151 ; Column I. gives the temperatures to which the observation recorded in the remaining columns refer .
These temperatures are corrected for emergent column , and are , as before stated , the mean temperature corresponding to the meaned density and the meaned solubility .
Column II .
gives the density of the saturated solution , obtained as already stated .
It summarizes over 600 observations , excluding the 300 mentioned on p. 195 .
THE EARL OF BERKELEY ON SOME Column III .
gives the corresponding solubilities in parts of anhydrous salt dissolved by 100 parts of water , and is also a summary of some 450 observations exclusive of the above mentioned 300 .
Column IV .
gives the number of gram-molecules of salt in I litre of solution saturated at the temperature recorded in column I. The numbers are obtained by dividing the weight of salt found in the litre by the molecular weight of that salt .
Column V. gives the number of gram-molecules of water in the litre .
The numbers are derived by dividing the weight of the water in I litre of saturated solution by the molecular weight of water .
Throughout this work the atomic weights used are those based on hydrogen as unity and oxygen as equal to 15'88 .
Column VI .
gives a measure of the concentration\#151 ; it is the ratio of the number of salt molecules to the sum of salt and water molecules in the same volume of solution .
