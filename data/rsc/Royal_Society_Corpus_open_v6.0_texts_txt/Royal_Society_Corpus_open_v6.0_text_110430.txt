R.S. The author observes , that the magnitude of the terms of the fourth order in the disturbing function , relating to the inclinations , in the theory of the secular inequalities of the planets , does not admit of being estimated ct priori ; and consequently the amount of error which may arise from neglecting them cannot be appreciated .
The object of the present investigation is to ascertain the analytical expressions of these terms ; and the method adopted for this purpose is derived from principles already explained by the author in a for ?
mer paper .
He has bestowed great pains in putting these expres ?
sions into the simplest form of which they are susceptible ; and has finally succeeded , after much labour of reduction , in obtaining expressions of remarkable simplicity .
He exemplifies their application by the calculation , on this method , of one of the terms given by Professor Airy as requisite for the determination of the inequality of Venus ; and arrives , by this shorter process , at the same result .
The same method , he remarks , is , with certain modifications , applicable to the developement of the disturbing function in terms of the true longitude .
