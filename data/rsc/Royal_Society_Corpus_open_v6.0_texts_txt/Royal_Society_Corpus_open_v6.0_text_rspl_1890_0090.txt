] In a paper read before the Royal Society on June 16 , 1881 , Professor G. H. Darwin stated : " It is difficult to conceive any mode in which an elastic solid can ruptnre except by shearing , and hence it appears that the greatest shearing stress is a proper measure of the tendency to break " ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1882 , p. 99 ) .
In this paper , I have recorded the results of some experiments made with a view to throwing light on the question raised by Professor Darwin .
The experiments were conducted in the mechanical laboratory at the Royal Indian Engineering College , Cooper 's Hill , the machine used being a hundred-ton single lever , hydraulic testing machine by Messrs. Buckton \amp ; Co. , of Leeds .
This machine is fully described in Unwin 's ' Testing of Materials of Construction , ' p. 133 .
All tension experiments were performed on circular specimens fitted with a screw thread at each end , on to which were screwed steel nuts resting in spherical seatings to ensure directness of pull .
The shearing experiments were conducted on specimens screwed throughout their entire length into three steel blocks , and tested in double shear , i.e\gt ; , the two outside blocks were pulled in the opposite direction to the inside block\#151 ; perpendicularly to the axis of the specimen , and the bar sheared in two places at once .
The idea of rupture necessarily implies an overcoming of resistance .
If the power* of steel to resist rupture under tension were a constant quantity , the conception of rupture would be simple , for we should only have to increase the stress up to the required amount , \#174 ; ud the bar would break ; but the resistance to rupture appears to e a function of the amount of flow that has taken place ( see experi-uients described in Table II ) .
If we take two axes , OX , OX , to represent respectively the elongation per unit of length , and the stress per unit of area of transverse section of elongated bar , we obtain the Prof. Cams-Wilson .
true stress strain curve OC for the steel of which the bar is composed ( fig. 3 ) .
We may refer to the same axes the curve AB showing the increase in the resistance to rupture with elongation per unit of length\#151 ; and when AB cuts the curve OC the bar must break , i.e. , when the stress per unit of area of transverse section becomes greater than the breaking stress corresponding to that degree of elongation .
If the two curves do not meet , the bar will continue to draw out\#151 ; as is the case with lead .
The method that is ordinarily adopted for estimating the tensile The Rupture of Steel by Longitudinal Stress .
245 strength of a metal , viz. , by dividing the maximum load by the original area , is a purely conventional method , and does not represent any real stress whatever ; it simply shows what load would be sustained by a given section before it broke , and though it is no doubt a useful figure for engineers to know , it does not tell us anything about the actual stress at fracture ; this can only be arrived at by dividing the load on the specimen at the point of rupture by the contracted area measured after the specimen has broken .
In this paper , the breaking stress will always be measured in this way , and will be referred to as the " true tensile strength " of the metal .
This is what M. Considere in his * L'Emploi du Fer et de l'Acier ' ( Paris , Dunod , 1885 ) calls " resistance de striction .
" It is well known that when a bar is subjected to tension\#151 ; the stress not being uniformly distributed , as , for instance , when the pull is not ( central\#151 ; the mean stress borne by the bar at rupture is less than it would be if the stress had been uniformly distributed .
It is stated in Thomson and Tait 's 'Natural Philosophy , ' Part II , p. 258 , that " a solid of any elastic substance , isotropic or seolotropic ... ... experiences infinite stress and strain in the neighbourhood of a re-entrant edge or angle , when influenced by any distribution of force , exclusive of surface tractions infinitely near the angles or edges in question .
" Three steel bars , numbered 829 , 830 , and 831 , were taken and cut m three pieces ; one piece was tested plain , and the second piece with a \/ -groove turned on it ( see fig. 1 ) .
The tool cutting the V-groove was made with its cutting edges at about 90 ' , and the : point as fine as possible .
The results are .given in Table I. It is clear that the V-groove is very prejudicial .
For the same reason a f V-groove with a rounded angle must be prejudicial , though not to such !
^ e^ent , since the distribution of stress is more uniform .
Specimen I o. 34 was cut in three pieces and tested , one plain and one with a ' groove of the same shape as Nos. 829 , 830 , 831 , but with the point * otthe cutting tool just rounded off .
The strength of the grooved 1 , fr 18 now \#174 ; 95 of the plain .
Similarly , with specimens 822 and 50 , ; grooved pieces have strengths of 84 and 89 respectively .
These I riments show that the mean stress at rupture diminishes as the I n| !

Fig. 1 shows the dimensions of the V"groove adopted in all cases , except in 822 Nos. 834 50 S , where the comer was just rounded off by the cutting tool .
Fig. 2 shows dimension of the U-groove .
It will be seen that in every case the ( J -grooved specimen is stronger than the plain , the average superiority being 16 per cent. The effect of the |J -groove by itself in producing non-uniformity of stress\#151 ; as in the \/ -groove\#151 ; would tend to make the U-grooved bar break at a lower stress than the plain bar , where the stress must be very nearly uniformly distributed , but , in spite of this prejudicial action , the U -grooved bar is the stronger .
This phenomenon is quite distinct from that mentioned by many writers , who have pointed out that a grooved specimen is stronger j than a plain specimen of the same material\#151 ; the stresses being I reckoned in the conventional manner , viz. , maximum load divided by original area ( cf. Unwin , * Testing of Materials of Construction , ' p. 82 , and Burr , * Elasticity and Resistance of Materials of Engineering , ' p. 230 ) .
The reason of this is that the so-called tensile strength depends on the amount of drawing out before local contraction begins , and since in a plain bar the general contraction of area may be considerable , the actual load on the specimen , at the maximum , is much smaller than on a bar of the same metal in which the drawing out is suppressed \#151 ; owing to the groove .
In the experiments quoted above , I have discounted altogether the contraction of area , and considered only the actual stress on the section at rupture .
It is possible that in some cases the metal at the groove is strongeI The Rupture of Steel by Longitudinal Stress .
than at any other point in the bar ; ; this would tell in its favour against a plain bar which is free to break at the weakest spot .
The steel on " which these experiments were conducted was very homogeneous , and the variation of strength within a short distance on the same bar would not be more than 4 or 5 per cent. , so this would scarcely account for the phenomena .
On the other hand , a grooved specimen is at a disadvantage when compared with a plain specimen for four reasons :\#151 ; ( i ) The stress is much more unevenly distributed over the least section in the grooved bar than in the plain .
( ii ) If the pull is not exactly parallel to the axis of the bar , bending stresses are induced , which are very prejudicial in the grooved bar , whereas their effect is largely neutralised in the plain bar by the ready flow of the metal.* ( iii ) The load at rupture can be observed with accuracy in testing the grooved bar , for it breaks off short , and the required load is also the maximum load .
In testing the plain bar , however , in consequence of the very rapid contraction of area immediately before rupture , the load has to be reduced , in order to keep the lever horizontal ; sometimes the load cannot be run back quick enough , and the bar may break while the lever is resting on the bottom stop , so that too high a load may be observed as the load of rupture ; this would tend to give a higher breaking stress in the plain bar than was actually the case.* ( iv ) The grooved bar has a crystalline fracture .
The plain bar has a silky fracture .
Experiments will be quoted later on to show t at the ultimate resistance to rupture is less , the more crystalline is the steel at the moment of rupture .
Careful measurements have been made of the test piece No. 831 v e others being very similar ) , to ascertain the least area of all Panes passing through any point in the narrowest section at 45 ' to o axis ( i ) in the grooved bar , ( ii ) in the plain bar ; the section of s T6 ^aties hs shown at ab in fig. 4 ; the diameter at the narrowest tbi 10U WaS 8ame in both specimens .
The ratio of the area of Igg p an i*1 the grooved bar to that in the plain was found to be to ^ C planes similar to those shown in the figures , equally inclined ax 8\gt ; and if the area of any one of these planes in the grooved If - now ' rupture is an overcoming of a resistance to shearing , the 183161 i ' be stronger than the plain in the ratio of p ' other things being the same in both bars , oil ji 6 resistance to shearing , at rnnture .

bar is 183/ 100 of any one in the plain , the resistances of all the planes " will be in the same ratio.* In this specimen ( N"o .
831 ) , the ratio of the true breaking stressc is actually 120 : 100 .
But there are four causes tending to reduc the strength of the grooved specimen , as has been shown above , viz. e ^ non-uniformity of stress , the possibility of a pull not perfectl longitudinal , the danger of observing too high a load on the plai specimen , and , lastly , the crystalline nature of the steel at fracture i : the grooved specimen .
* This assumes that the shearing stress is uniform over both of these obliqu p anes ; the probability of this supposition is discussed in a paper on " The Distri bution of Flow in a Strained Elastic Solid , " published in the 'Philosophic* Magazine , ' for June , 1890 .
The Rapture of Steel by Longitudinal Stress .
249 All these causes tend to reduce the superiority of the grooved bar ; the effect of the non-uniformity of stress is , no doubt , the greatest ; in fact , as has been shown , if the groove is of V-s^aPe\gt ; this causes the plain bar to be the strongest , so that it is quite conceivable that the non-uniformity of stress in the U -grooved bar , with other causes mentioned , might reduce the strength from 180 : 100 to 120 : 100 of the plain bar .
The following are the experiments referred to , in order to prove that the ultimate resistance of steel to shearing diminishes inversely with the drawing out:\#151 ; Six pieces of the same steel bar were taken and drawn out under tension to varying percentages of their length ; they were then prepared as shearing specimens , as explained above , and tested in double shear , with the following results :\#151 ; \#166 ; Table II .

Taking the contraction of area as a measure of the flow , No. 831 specimen contracted 50 per cent , on the plain bar and 28T per cent , on the -grooved bar , so that the former would be at an advantage , compared with the latter , in this respect .
It appears , then , that the load that can be borne by a given section of steel without rupture can be increased by thickening the bar above and below the section in question , though , if the angle of the groove be too acute , the reverse is the effect .
But the prejudicial action of a groove , owing to non-uniformity of stress produced , is the 8ame in a JJ- or \/ -groove , and differs only in amount , so that the U-groove , by itself , could not strengthen the bar , but must weaken yet in spite of this , the JJ -grooved bar is stronger than the plain The increase of strength , then , must be due to the added Material ; but in no way could such added material strengthen such a action , and enable it to stand a greater load , if rupture is produced ^ a certain intensity of tensile stress ; we cannot diminish the mean 8 ress on the section by thickening the bar above and below ; on the e 2 Prof. Carus-Wilson .
contrary , we increase the stress over part of the section , and it is the maximum stress that we have to reckon with , for the bar will begin breaking there and tear across .
There is no doubt that the added material increases the resistance to shearing , and I am , therefore , led to the conclusion that it is this increased resistance to shearing that causes the increase in strength ; in other woi'ds , by adding material above and below the section , the shearing stress for elements lying in the section is certainly reduced , and , at the same time , the strength is certainly increased , the conclusion drawn being that the true measure of the tendency to break is the greatest shearing stress .
The fact that longitudinal tension is equivalent to a uniform dilating tension and a shearing stress , and that by the means above described we can diminish the latter , without altering the former , and thereby strengthen the bar , are strong reasons for supposing that Professor Darwin 's statement is correct , and that it is the shearing stress produced by longitudinal stress that causes rupture .
If it be true that the rupture of a steel bar under tension is determined by the greatest shearing stress , we should expect to find that a definite relation existed between the ultimate resistance to , direct shearing and the same to direct tension .
Much has been written about the relation of these two resistances , | but the conclusions drawn are very misleading , since the tensile strength considered has been that calculated in the conventional manner , which has , as has been shown , no real significance and is no real stress .
By a well known theorem , the greatest shearing stress is equal to j~ one-half the longitudinal stress ; we should then expect to find that one-half the true tensile stress at rupture was equal to the stress at f ' rupture in a shearing experiment on a piece of the same steel .
If the steel be soft , it will contract locally before breaking ; hence the greatest shearing stress will be less than half the longitudinal k stress in the ratio of the sections of a cylindrical and contracted bar , ' cut by planes parallel to do and ab ( fig. 5 ) respectively , the two bars f 's having the same cross section at coo ; in other words , in the ratio of | a/ 2 ( area across coo ) to ( area across aob ) , where boe = 45 ' .
If this ^ ratio be called 0 , and the true tensile stress at rupture be the I shearing stress at rupture in a shearing experiment should be equal to ^pd .
Table III gives the resuls of some experiments made to investigate this question .
The tensile and shearing experiments were made respectively on pieces of steel cut from the same bar ; the former were ; made on circular specimens screwed at each end , and resting on nuts bearing on spherical seatings ; the shearing specimens were screwed The Rupture of Steel hy Longitudinal Stress .

tension experiment ; the 5th gives half the true tensile stress ; the 6th gives the values of 0 , deduced by measurement in each case ; the 7th gives *2 'pO ; the 8th gives wgj the area of the specimen in the shearing experiment ; and the 9th column gives the intensity of shearing stress at rupture in the shearing experiment .
It will he seen that in every case \fd is very nearly equal to s , the shearing stress at rupture in a tensile experiment is very nearly equal to the ultimate resistance to shearing in a pure shearing experiment . !
There are , however , two points to be considered before accepting the result of these experiments .
The distribution of stress over the section of rupture in the tension experiment has been assumed constant , whereas it is not actually so .
I find , by actual measurement , that the area of a plane section at 45 ' to the axis passing through the centre of the narrowed section hears to the area of a parallel plane passing through a point on the circumference , the ratio of 100 to 108 , in a bar which has contracted 50 per cent. , so that the shearing stress is rather greater at the centre , and hence the value of -|p , given above , is too small by about 4 per cent. On the other hand , it has been pointed out to me by Professor Darwin that the distribution of stress in the shearing experiment is probably not uniform , being greater in the neighbourhood of the application of the stress .
Experiments were made with two pieces of Lowmoor iron , cut off the same bar , and prepared as shearing specimens in the ordinary way , and tested in double shear , one with an area to be sheared of twice 1-039 square inch , and the other of twice 0-322 square inch .
The result was as follows : Large section , shearing stress at rupture\#151 ; ( i ) 18"7 .
, ( ii ) 18"9 ; mean , 18*8 tons per Square inch .
Small section , stress at rupture\#151 ; ( i ) 20 " 1 , ( ii ) 20"6 ; mean 20*35 .
Giving the latter as 8"2 per cent , stronger than the former .
The smaller the section the more uniform will be the stress , and with the small section employed in the experiments quoted in Table III the stress is probably nearly uniform .
It would seem , then , that the possible errors due to the unequal distribution of stress in the tensile and shearing experiments would nearly balance one another , and that we may regard these results as tending to confirm the theory that the greatest shearing stress is the proper measure of the tendency to break.* * I have made experiments of a similar kind on cast iron .
G-reat care was taken in casting to secure uniformity , by casting the bars upright and cutting off the spongy top ; they were cast with two heads which were turned to fit spherical seating8 .
The shearing specimens were cut off bars from the same .
cast .
The bars in tension were 10 inches long between the shoulders , and turned throughout their length* The Rupture of Steel by Longitudinal Stress .
253 It will now be necessary to enquire how far the appearance of the fracture of a steel bar affords evidence of its having broken by b^In a bar of circular section and uniform thickness throughout its length , every plane at 45 ' to the axis opposes an equal resistance to the"tangential stress caused by direct tension .
Hence , there is no one plane or planes along which the ba ?
would be more ready to break by shearing than along any other plane , provided that the material was of uniform strength throughout .
If , however , the bar be gradually thinned at a certain point , this will no longer be the case ; it has been shown on p. 252 , that the area of a plane at 45 ' to the axis passing through the centre of the narrowed section is less than the area of a plane passing through any other point in that section ; hence , there will be a surface formed by a complete cone of 45 ' , with apex at the centre of the narrowed section , which will oppose a less resistance to rupture by shearing than any other similar cone with apex at any other point .
This cone is shown in section in fig. 6 at gof\#151 ; aob .
We should then expect to find rupture result in a fracture formed by a cone and crater , or , since there is nothing to determine along which part of the cone rupture will take place , we may expect to find the cone irregularly broken up , part on one end , and part on the other .
This narrowing of girth at one point always accompanies the rupture of soft steel , and we invariably find such a cone and crater ; figs. 5 and 6 , Plate 2 , and 6 and 7 , Plate 3 , are good examples .
[ Note.\#151 ; The rupture of cast iron in compression by shearing is of course well known .
Pig .
2 , Plate 2 , shows the cone of shearing very well .
] In flat bars of soft steel , this shearing action is still more marked .
Here the surface of the least resistance is a plane at 45 ' to the axis and making 90 ' with the thin side of the bar ; it is evident that in a bar whose width is considerable compared with its thickness , and which has suffered considerable local contraction , this plane has the least area of all planes at 45 ' to the axis passing through any point in Tension ...

The result is , that in flat bars of soft steel the fracture is almost invariably as shown in figs. 4 and 5 , Plate 3 .
Pig .
8 , Plate 3 , shows a flat bar of soft steel just about to rupture by shearing along a plane JL the width of the bar \#151 ; resulting no doubt from an accidental weakness in that direction .
| In the cases considered above , the steel has been of sufficiently uniform quality to allow of the fracture taking place over a surface of least resistance to shearing ; but , unless this condition be fulfilled , the form of the fracture will be quite different .

Pig .
1 , Plate 2 , shows a steel bar where the apex of the cone is at the circumference , owing to the presence of a weak spot there .
Every fracture is caused by the presence of a more or less well defined weak spot ; the stress is greatest at this spot , and the material tends to tear in a plane JL the axis passing through this spot .
This tearing action can be observed by drilling a small hole in a steel plate , and straining it .
The plate pinches in near the hole , and gives way first on each side of the hole , and then tears right across .
The experiment may be stopped before the tear has reached the sides .
When the steel is hard , this tearing continues in the plane ia Proc. Roy .

255 which it commenced , i.e. , perpendicular to the axis ; hut when the steel is soft , the plane of the tear gradually tilts over and coincides with the surface of least resistance to shearing , i.e , , becomes inclined at 45 ' to the axis .
Now , at rupture , an originally soft bar is harder in the centre of the narrowed section than at the circumference , where the drawing out has been less ; hence , fracture commences at the centre perpendicular to the axis , and tears outwards until it reaches the softer material , when it will continue along a surface of least resistance to shearing , i.e. , along a surface formed by the intersection of two cones .
Hence , we find the fracture of a soft steel bar consisting of a crater with a more or less extended base ; see figs. 5 and 6 , Plate 2 , and 6 and 7 , Plate 3 .
The harder the steel , at the outset , the broader will be the base of the crater , until , in very hard steels , there is only a rim or crown left round the edge ; and in the hardest steels all trace of the surface of least resistance to shearing disappears .
[ Note.\#151 ; I have employed the term " hard " in the sense usually understood , i.e. , where the " hardness " is measured by the value of the limit of elastic resistance .
