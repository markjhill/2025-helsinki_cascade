232 Results of Monthly Observations of [ Jan. 27 the middle of well-marked series , their different amplitudes and periods , could not be explained except by the supposition that the solar action was not continuous , but only by fits periodic .
The author was induced to believe lately that these differences in the oscillations were due to conjoint actions of the sun and moon ; he accordingly deduced the mean variations corresponding to three periods of 26 , 29*5 , and 27*3 days , the times of rotation of the sun derived from the magnetic observations , and of the moon 's synodical and tropical revolutions respectively .
He finds that the combinations of these three series of variations represent with considerable accuracy all the variations of the daily mean horizontal force of the earth 's magnetism during each year ; so that the sun 's rotation and the different positions of the moon relatively to the sun and the plane of the equator ( or of the ecliptic ) are found to produce all the differences in the amplitude and time , as well as the apparent disappearance of the oscillation .
Cases of considerable and sudden diminution of the earth 's magnetic fdrce which happened in the years 1844 and 1845 are next examined ; and it is shown that these changes occur at intervals of 26 days , or multiples of 26 days ; in one instance there are five successive recurrences at the exact interval of 26 days .
As this period is that of the sun 's rotation relatively to the earth , it appears to follow that the earth has some action on the sun , or ( more probably ) on some ray-like emanation from the sun , which causes these changes in the earth 's magnetism .
It is found also that these sudden variations occur more frequently when the moon is at a considerable distance from the equator and the ecliptic ; it would thus appear that our satellite has also an action on the cause of the great terrestrial magnetic disturbances .

" Results of the Monthly Observations of Magnetic Dip , Horizontal Force , and Declination made at the Kew Observatory from April 1869 to March 1875 inclusive .
" By the Kew Committee .
Received November 25 , 1875 .
This paper , containing the result of six years ' magnetic observations at the Kew Observatory , follows as the third of a series of publications , the first of which was a communication to the Royal Society by General Sir E. Sabine , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1863 , page 273 , which consisted of a discussion of certain selected magnetic disturbances , a general discussion of declinational changes as recorded by the magnetographs , and a discussion of the absolute determination of Dip and Horizontal Force at the Observatory , for the six years April 1857 to March 1863 inclusive .

233 igs of the Royal Society , ' contributed by Dr. Balfour Stewart , the aperintendent of the Observatory ; it contained the results of the lonthly observations of Dip and Horizontal Force for the next series of x years , viz. from April 1863 to May 1869 .
There is now presented a further series of six years ' observations of )ip and Horizontal Force , from April 1869 to March 1875 inclusive , jgether with observations of absolute declination for the same period .
The instruments employed in the determinations are the same as those escribed by Sir E. Sabine in the Philosophical Transactions , 1863 , age 296 , no change worth noticing having been made in either instruments or magnets .
As in the case of the six years discussed by Dr. Stewart , only those lips have been considered which have been made with the two needles 7os .
1 and 2 of circle Barrow No. 33 ; of these the general practice has even to observe both needles on two successive days in the middle of the lonth , giving the mean of the four observations as the mean for the aonth .
The values of the constants-employed in the reduction of the observa-ions of vibration and deflection have been redetermined , and found to slosely correspond with those found by Mr. Welsh , which are given in he paper quoted above .
Two observations of vibration and two of deflection , at two distances , lave been made each month , the mean result being taken as the force for ; he month .
The Declination observations have been made in the Magnetic Observatory with the Kew 9-inch unifilar and a reversible collimator magnet ME , the instrument being directed after each reading to the reference-marks on the obelisk erected a quarter of a mile to the north of the Observatory as a meridian mark for the transit instrument .
The azimuth of this mark , as viewed from the declinometer , was care-Eully determined by Mr. Welsh in 1857 , and has since been verified both by Mr. Chambers and Mr. Whipple .
After each observation of the magnet it is removed and replaced by a torsion-plummet of equal weight , the position of which is observed when it has come to perfect rest a few hours after the observation .
Should any torsion be found to have been introduced into the thread , a suitable correction is applied to the observation .
Observations have been made at noon on two consecutive days in each month , the mean of which is inserted in the Table .
Dip .
In Table I. we have a record of the observed values of dip made with circle 33 Barrow , each observation being the mean of two made with each of the two needles belonging to that circle .

[ Jaili 27 The mean annual secular change observed , 8 ' 5"-72 declination diminishing , is larger than that determined by Sir E.

The semiannual inequality is also largely increased , being now 81 '*80 , whereas between 1857 and 1862 it was only 58"*85 ; possibly part of this difference may , however , be due to the fact of the observations now under notice having only been made at isolated periods , whilst the latter result was obtained from the hourly readings of the magnetograph recording the declination continuously .

" Contributions to the Minute Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland of the Dog .
" By E. Cresswell Baber , M.D. Loud .
Communicated by Dr. Klein , E.R.S. Received December 9 , 1875 .
( Abstract .
) The minute structure of the thyroid gland generally , and of its lymphatics in particular , are subjects still but imperfectly understood .
With the view of elucidating the latter , the following research was made on the thyroid gland of the dog .
The research was carried out under the direction of Dr. Klein .
On injecting the lymphatics of this organ with Berlin blue , by the method of puncture , they present the following characters :\#151 ; Traversing the gland , chiefly in a longitudinal direction , are large lymphatic vessels provided with valves .
In direct connexion with these , and permeating the gland in all directions , is a dense mesh work of lymphatic tubes and spaces .
The smaller lymphatic tubes run between individual gland-vesicles , the larger between groups of the same .
They accommodate themselves accurately to the intervals left between the vesicles , and where the intervals are larger they expand into irregularly shaped lymphatic spaces .
They present no appearance of terminating in blind extremities as stated by some authors .
Injections with nitrate of silver show the lymphatic vessels , tubes , and spaces to be all lined with a continuous layer of endothelial plates .
During this investigation it became necessary to study more carefully the interalveolar tissues .
This led to the discovery in them of a tissue which does not appear to have yet been described .
This tissue , which is designated by the author by the name of " consists of large rounded cells , each provided with an oval nucleus , found either singly or in groups amongst the epithelial cells .
