There is some dispute as to whom belongs the credit of introducing this plant into the Mascarene Islands .
By some M. de Heine , a captain of infantry , is allowed the honour .
He , during his sojourn in Mauritius , having tried ineffectually to obtain seeds from Erance , on his return to the mother country sent some seed to p5re Andre at Pamplemousses in Mauritius , who successfully grew it .
Others consider that Eusee Aublet , author of the Elora of Erench Guiana , introduced it about 1760 .
I have no record of its introduction into Rodriguez , but it now grows very abundantly in some of the rivers .

This Mascarene plant in Bodriguez is found growing only on the limestone plains of upraised coral reef , and as these only occur at the east and west ends of the island , there only is the plant found .
The wood is hard and fine , but brittle , very durable , and is used in making " pirogues .
" Like many others on the island , this tree is heterophyllous .
The leaves in young plants and on adventitious shoots of old trees are small , ovate acute , in .
long , about ^ in .
across , with very short petiole , and the margin spinose dentate .
The leaves in the adult , on the other hand , are obovate or elliptical , with a cuneate base , and quite obtuse , sometimes even retuse , about 2 in .
long and an inch broad , with a distinct petiole .
Lamarck , Diet .

I follow Baker in reducing to one species the several forms of this endemic Mascarene genus , and of these forms theceformalone occurs in Bodriguez , though not very abundantly .
It is heterophyllous .
The specimens of this tree , however , which I gathered do not exhibit the heterophylly in such a marked degree as do some specimens ( in herb .
Kew ) of the tree from Mauritius , where the young leaves are distinctly pinnatifid , thence they pass through stages of greater or less den-tations up to the adult form .

It is interesting to read in Leguat 's account of his sojourn in Bodriguez ( p. 64 ) " that he did not find in this island any plant , tree , shrub , or herb , which grows " naturally in any part of Europe , that was known to us , except Purslain , which " is small and green .
There 's plenty of it in some places of the valleys , and that " which we sowed , having brought some of the seed from the Cape , came up exactly cc like the Purslain of the Island ; " and he records how , when a green caterpillar appeared after a hurricane and destroyed the greater part of their crops , the Purslain was untouched .

This endemic Mascarene plant is not abundant on the island .
It is remarkable from the variation in form of its leaves .
On the youngest trees I met with , the leaves were rounded at the base , deeply trifid , the lobes being linear acuminate .
In older specimens the lobation of the leaf gradually disappears , and we have ovate acute leaves .
Finally , by a gradual transition of forms , we reach the leaves of mature plants , which are obovate , obtuse or deeply emarginate , and cuneate at the base .
The venation also becomes more distinct in the adult leaves , and they are quintuplinerved .
A hybrid from this plant , the male being H. , Linn. , is figured , Bot. Mag. t. 2891 , from Mauritius , and it seems to possess the variable foliage of one parent ; its flowers , though similar to , are much larger than those of j Kibiscusliliiflorus .

Vaur or Var. Everywhere along the shores .
Of this plant there are two distinct varieties on the island which are recognised by the inhabitants .
Of these ( A. ) Var blanc is the more scarce , at least I met with it less frequently .
It forms a tree about 25 to 30 feet high , but I am informed also in some places forms a thicket , though I did not meet with it in such condition .
The wood is very hard , is heavy and close grained , and makes a good timber , though difficult to work from its hardness .
The bark of the trunk and large branches is thick , quite smooth , and does not split or crack .
The bast layers are light-coloured , and make a capital cordage , which is greatly used , as cattle will not gnaw or eat it .
The leaves are pilose at the junction of the lamina and petiole , and the veins are puberulous .
The calyx lobes are eglandulose .
( B. ) Var rouge.\#151 ; This seemed to me the commonest variety , and forms dense tickets , and I do not recollect seeing it as a large tree .
The wood is soft , porous , and very light , comparatively useless for carpentry , and only fit for burning .
The bark is not so thick as in Var , is rough , cracking , and splitting after the manner of that of an Oak .
The bast layers have a reddish tinge , and do not make so good a cordage as those of Var T T blanc .
The leaves are less coriaceous than those of Var blanc , and rather velutinous than pilose .
The epicalyx seems more deeply cleft , and each lobe of the calyx has a linear median dorsal gland which is very conspicuous .
The forms are very easily distinguished at first sight by the bark .
In no instance did I find any trace of heteromorphism in the leaves .
This is interesting in connexion with an observation made in the Saharunpore gardens by Bell in 1863 ( Trans. Bot. Soc. Edin .
vii .
565 ) , and again by King in 1868 ( Journ. Linn. Soc. xv .
101 ) on Hibiscus ( Paritium ) tricusp , Cav .
A lateral branch of this tree curving downwards " entered the soil , and re-appearing about 2 feet from its point of entrance , gave rise to a large leafy bush .
" The leaves of this sport , unlike the parent , were not trifid , but like those of H. ( ) tiliaceus ; and in addition to some other peculiarities , the calyx segments had each " a large oblong gland full of a viscid secretion on the back .
" It must therefore approach the Var rouge of Rodriguez .
Thiselton Dyer , in a note appended to King 's remarks , suggests that H. tricuspis , which is a South Sea Island plant , may be a local form derived from H. tiliaceus , and this I think is not at all improbable .
It is , however , curious that in an island where heterophylly is so marked a character in many of the trees , no trace of it is observable in this species , although a heterophyllous variety is noted by Masters in Oliv .

Both species of Gossypium are widely distributed over the island ; G. barbadense is found most abundantly on lie Pierrot , a small coral islet near the edge of the reef on the south side , covering it almost entirely to the exclusion of other plants .
I believe it was introduced from an American ship , which was wrecked some years ago on the reef .
The cotton produced is of very good quality , but the inhabitants are too lazy to pick it clean and make use of it .

Bois pipe .
Is met with in the upper parts of the valleys .
The wood is heavy , and as the popular name implies is used for making pipes .
The leaves are hetermorphic .
The adult leaves frequently are more cordate and less crenate than in the type , but all are densely ferrugineo-tomentose beneath .
In young trees the leaves are lanceolate and taper to the base , and the under surface is pale green and glabrous , not in the least tomentose .
Cavanilles l.c. says of the species Eolia sunt certe diversa , " but this he applies only to the amount of lobation ; and then , again , he says , " tomento rufescente , in junioribus albicante .
" His specimens were derived from Mauritius , so that in that island the species apparently varies in the same manner as in Bodriguez .
This species is endemic in the Mascarene islands .

This is the most frequently met with of all the trees in the island , and many specimens , where far removed from dwellings , have attained a large size .
The leaves are heteromorphic .
The young ones are linear and acute , about 8 in .
long by } in .
broad , with no petiole , or an exceedingly short one , the midrib and veins being of a bright red colour , and the margins faintly undulate .
Erom this we trace a succession of forms to the most mature , which are obovate or elliptico-oblong , obtuse or retuse , 3 to 3J in .
long by an inch or more broad , and with a distinct petiole J to J in .
long , the midrib and veins usually green and the margins distinctly crenate .
The inhabitants distinguish two varieties of this tree .
One they call " rouge " the other " blanc " according as the wood of the tree is red or not red , and the " Mane " is the harder wood of the two .
But it is impossible to recognise these varieties .
The wood of the young plant is usually reddish , and as the plant grows the new wood tends to become paler , until in mature trees the new wood may be hardly red , or it may have a distinct red tinge .
And so it happens that in every tree of this species the wood in some part of the diameter of the trunk has a reddish or pink colour .
The wood is tough , and is used , more than any other tree , in carpentry and for making " pirogues .
" I think this must be the tree to which Leguat refers when he says , e\#163 ; The Tree bore a fruit something like an olive , and the parrots " loved the nuts of it mightily .
" Erom this tree exudes an enormous quantity of gum in the form of tears , which soon harden and form large masses in crevices of the stem or on the ground around .

In the valley of the Bivi5re Palmiste and at the top of the valley of the Bivi\amp ; re Mouruc .
This is a rare tree 20-30 ft. high , and I found it only in the two localities mentioned .
I have followed Baker in describing it as a species of ; but its five-symmetrical flowers and crenated disk are marked points of difference from the description of that genus .
Of the many points of agreement I specially would note the mode of attachment of the ovule to the placenta , which is very peculiar .
It answers much more closely the description of , an imperfectly known monotypic Cape genus ; the male flowers of which are alone described in Bentliam and Hooker 's Genera Plantarum ( see also Harv .
and Sond .
PI .
Cap. I. 525 ) , but of the female flowers I have seen a MS .
description at Kew .
Unfortunately the male flowers of my plant are unknown ; but the female flowers correspond so closely with the description that I should have been inclined rather to place it in this genus had Baker not previously described it as Sclerocarya ; and as our information regarding the genera is imperfect I prefer to leave it so .
May not this species bring Sclerocarya and Harpephyllum into one genus ?
It seems to me to point in that direction , but with such fragmentary material as we possess it is impossible to decide .

Many forms of this tree occur on the island .
The inhabitants told me that the seed of the Mango in Bodriguez never contains a small grub which is always , or nearly always , present in the Mango in Mauritius .
The trees not being in fruit during my stay I had no opportunity of verifying the statement .
But supposing it true , it seems to point to the probable absence from Bodriguez of some insect which is present in Mauritius and visits the Mango flower .
May this have anything to do with the fertilisation of the Mango ?
I may mention in this connexion that a great number of Mango trees which flowered most profusely showed no signs of producing fruit .

The rind was green and the inside red ; \lt ; \#163 ; they are very refreshing , and never do any hurt , no more than the others " ordinary melons ) : they are so full of water that one may easily go without drink " when they are eaten ; sometimes they were so big that all eight of us could " hardly eat up one of them .
These several kinds of melons grew without taking " pains about them , as I have said already , and produced fruit in great abundance .
f\lt ; When we mingled a little ashes with the earth in the place where they were sown " it made 'em grow and fructify extraordinarily , and the fruit was more than " ordinarily delicate .

This is one of the prettiest and most interesting plants from Rodriguez , belonging , as it does , to a genus hitherto unknown in the Mascarene Islands , though abundantly represented in Africa .
It is one of the few relics of the old Rlora of the island , and is only found in most unfrequented spots at the heads of the valleys .
It is heterophyllous as is represented in the plate .
I am inclined to think there are two species on the island , one of which in the adult has elliptical leaves or leaves IS .

rounded at both ends , and the other with leaves narrowing to both ends ; but my specimens are not sufficient to determine the point , and where we find , as we do in this flora , such variations in individual characters amongst so many species , we must allow a very wide range of specific variation .
The parts of this plant are not put to any use by the natives , and indeed it is so scarce many of them are unaware of its existence .
The wood is hard and white .

This small tree or shrub is very common on the island , and exhibits a very marked heterophylly ; the leaves or young plants and on adventitious shoots being very minute , oval , and rigid , but not spiny .
In the adult they become almost orbicular and lose much of their rigidity .
This is one form of what I have referred to in my introductory remarks as the first type of heterophylly .
To illustrate this a figure of the plant is given , but the heterophylly is not so clearly marked in the plate as I could wish for .
This variation accounts for the multiplication of species in this genus .

So that we have in Fernelia a Mascarene endemic monotypic genus .
Some confusion as to the popular name of this tree has arisen , and it is often referred to as Bois de ronde .
This is the name of rodriguesiana , Balf .

, a Composite plant .
But the name Bois de ronde is often erroneously given to Carissa Xylopieron , Pet. Th. , an Apocynaceous plant , of which the leaves , and specially the young leaves , are very like those of Fernelia buxifolia , Lam .
, and hence the name Bois de ronde has been sometimes associated with F. buxifolia , Lam .
The wood is hard , but not used for any special purpose .

This is a small heterophyllous tree or shrub about 15-25 ft. high , of very erect habit , the young leaves being narrow and linear and acute , becoming in the adult broader and more obtuse and usually shorter .
It is very abundant and bats feed greatly on its fruit , hence its common name .
I have had considerable difficulty in determining to what genus to refer this plant , and its position in the genus Fyrostriamust only be regarded at present as provisional , as my specimens are imperfect , I have no flowers .
With Fyrostria it agrees in most points ; the fruit is , however , fewer-celled than is common in that genus .
The embryo of the Rodriguez plant is slightly curved , and has an inferior radicle .
Of Fyrostria the embryo is at present unknown , but the genus is located amongst the Fanguerice , Bentli .
et Hook .
Gen. Plant , ii .
22 , a group characterised by a superior radicle .
An important result then of the confirmation of this plant as a Fyrostria will be the removal of that genus from its present position to one in the tribe Ixorece , where the radicle is inferior when it would come near and Coffea .
With Myonima the plant has many points of resemblance , more especially with a species , M. heterophylla , Boj .
Hort. Maur .
169 , but it differs therefrom in its axillary clustered inflorescence , not terminal panicles .
With Coffea also it has certain resemblances , but there are sufficient characters to keep it out of that genus .
Baker refers it doubtfully to Flectronbut it is impossible to put it there , as in that genus the radicle is superior .

This small tree grows commonly along with Balf .
fil .
in secluded parts of the island , and is not common .
I am unable to refer it to any known genus , and have taken it as the type of a new one .
Its nearest affinity is with Fyrostria , but it is distinguished by the sessile anthers , which are included or sub-included ; the style , which is thick and is deeply 4-cleft ; but the most prominent feature is the large bracts , which form a complete involucre to the flowers .
These bracts are clothed at the base within by many short conical adpressed processes , which may represent abortive flowers .
The embryo in the single immature fruit obtained is unfortunately too decayed to determine its relations .
This tree is heterophyllous .
The leaves of young plants being linear pass through a gradation of forms to the adult type , which in many cases is almost orbicular .

It is difficult therefore to be certain of the genus , , but the 2-celled ovary , with a solitary basilar erect ovule in each loculus , places it distinctly in the tribe Fsychotrice , and it seems to fall most naturally into the genus Fsychotria .

It differs from most species of Fsiaclia in Mauritius in being velutino-pubescent , not glutinous , and resembles many of the Bourbon species , originally described as species of Conyza , but now referred to Fsiadia .

But Bentham and Hooker , Gen. Plant , l.c. , place Sarcantliemum under Fsiadia , remarking " planta Mascarensis a nobis non visa ex charactere dato a Fsiadia non differt nisi " corollis basi crassis ampliatis .
" The specimens brought now from Rodriguez admit of a full examination of the plant , with the result that it is confirmed as a species of Fsiadia , although it differs slightly from that genus in the corolla , and also in the fimbrilliferous centre of the receptacle .

BAILEY BALFOUR , This interesting little plant grows only on the coralline limestone , and there in no great abundance .
The young leaves are undivided and gradually become pinna tifid as they get older .
This is hardly to be considered a form of heteropliylly comparable to what is so common in many of the plants from the island .
The genus Abrotanella , to which it is referred , originally founded by Cassini for a species A. emarginata , brought by Gaudichand from the Falkland Islands , nowr contains about nine species , and these are all Australian , New Zealand , or Antarctic forms .
The Rodriguez plant , while it closely resembles the other species of the genus , its nearest ally apparently being A. ( Ceratella ) Hook , fil .
El .
Antarct .
i. 25 , a species from CampheH 's islands , possesses a very remarkable peculiarity in the ovary and fruit .
The apex of the ovary and of the young fruit is prolonged into a beak , which coils on itself upon the top of the ovary , making usually one complete turn , and to its extremity is jointed the corolla tube .
In the mature fruit this beak becomes straightened out into a long process .
The genus is unknown in the other Mascarene islands .

This plant is common on the island , hut under two forms .
When growing near the sea the leaves and stems usually become more succulent and fleshy than they are when the plant grows inland .
The species was founded by He Candolle on specimens from Mauritius in the herbarium of the Museum at Paris .
The type specimens I could not find for comparison , nor did I find named specimens of iS .
, Poir .
, and S. Pers .
There are , however , specimens unnamed , both in the general herbarium and in Jussieu 's herbarium from Mauritius and Bourbon , collected by Commerson , which are identifiable with the descriptions of the above-mentioned species , S. linearis , HO .
, S. Lingua , Poir .
, and S. salicif , Pers .
, and wdiicli are manifestly mere insular variations of one species , to which the Bodriguez plant may also be referred .
There is also a specimen at Paris from Bourbon , collected by Abbe Pourret and named in MS .
S. borbonicus , which is clearly this plant ; and a specimen of Commerson 's from Madagascar is probably the same .
I have no hesitation in uniting the four species in one .
Baker , l.c. , from want of sufficient information as to S. linearis , BC .
, describes the Rodriguez plant as S. Boutoni .
The species is exclusively Mascarene .

In a letter to me at Rodriguez Mr. Horne mentioned that a collector in 1864 brought to Mauritius a yellow flowered Achillea from Rodriguez , but I do not know it .

This Mascarene tree is remarkably heterophyllous .
The young leaves are small , about J-J in .
long , spinose dentate on the margins , and with the apex obtuse or slightly retuse ; also the branchlets bear a number of interpetiolar spines , one between each pair of leaves .
In the adult the leaves are 1-2 in .
long by f-1 in .
broad , with entire recurved margins and the apex deeply emarginate or obtuse , and there are no spines or rarely on the branchlets .
Between these two forms all stages are found .
This belongs to the first type of heterophylly referred to in my introductory remarks , and is well represented in the plate .
The tree is very common on the island .
The wood is very hard and dense , quite like boxwood , and is much used for making netting needles and such like articles .
Y Y 2 The wood is not unlike that of the Bois de ronde ( .

but the heart wood is of a much brighter yellow .
The plant is abundant still on the island , but formerly existed in enormous quantity , for the limestone plains are in many places strewn with dead branches and stems of it mixed with those of Bois de ronde .

This plant resembles the foregoing species in almost every point save in the flower , and therein it differs in the corona .
In place of the sinuose-dentate cyathi-form outer corona , characteristic of Sarcost , and well seen in S. , R. Br .
, the outer corona consists of 5 scales , distinct except at the very base , each tridentate , the central tooth being largest .
These are connected with the inner corona scales , which are twice as long as the outer scales , but shorter than the gynostegium , whereas in S. viminale , R. Br .
, the inner scales are thrice the length of the outer , and are longer than the gynostegium .
This is a very important difference in this family .
But on examining a large series of flowers , I discovered one in which there was an arrangement of the corona exactly half-way between the two forms I have described .
The cyatliiform outer corona of S. , R. Br .
, was divided about half-way down into five tridentate lobes , and the relations of length between outer and inner scales was intermediate .
This then connects the two forms .
It is then a question , have we to deal with two or one species ?
I rather incline to the former view , that there are two distinct species , for we find certain other minute differences between them , and at Rodriguez I was led to suspect there might he two species , from a certain difference in facies of the plant in different situations .
However we consider them , the character of the genus must he slightly emended .
Should they turn out to he one species , we have here a species varying beyond the generic limits .
Acting on the opinion expressed , I have described a new species of Sarcostemma .

Bois cabri .
A small endemic fairly abundant tree exhibiting an extreme form of heterophyily well represented in the plate .
It is very closely allied to the Mauritian and Bourbon species , C. heterophyllum , B. Bi\ , but its larger pinnatipartite leaves on the young plant and relative size of the parts of the flower sufficiently distinguish them .
This small tree is easily recognised by its disagreeable odour , which has occasioned its popular name .
The wood is very white and close-grained , but is not put to great use , save for burning , probably on account of the odour .
I have no doubt this is the tree to which Leguat refers when he says , " There is a tree we call the \#171 ; Nasty tree because it stunk .
It is the best wood of all for carpenter 's use , but \#171 ; it was of no service to for us it stinks so , that it makes all the places about \#171 ; it smell of it , and the smell is very offensive .
" Some have thought he refers to the Bois puant ( Foetidia mauritiana , Lam .
) , but the odour of that tree though exceedingly objectionable is only apparent when the sun shines upon it , and is evanescent , and not at all like the persistent odour which the Bois cabri emits .

The fruit of this tree is said to be edible .
I have followed Baker , 1 .
c. , regarding this plant and the preceding .
My specimens are not sufficient to allow of a very satisfactory determination .
Leguat speaks of " a wonderful tree whose branches are so round and so thick " it is impossible for the sunbeams to penetrate through it .
Some of these trees " are so big that two or three hundred people may stand under them and be sheltered " from the sun or the weather .
The vast extent of it is occasioned thus .
Some " of the great branches naturally tend downwards , and reaching the ground , take " root and become new trunks themselves which make a sort of little forest .
" He refers evidently to a species of Ficu , and gives a figure of it , but I do not know to what species , certainly neither of those above mentioned , for he describes it more particularly :\#151 ; " The Rodrigo Kastas ( for I sought to keep the Indian name at least in the Indies ) bear leaves as broad as one 's hand , pretty thick and somewhat like that of a lilacli or heart in shape , they are softer than satin to touch .
Their flower is white and smells well .
Their fruit is red and round , and as big as a black damask plum .
Their skin is hard and within it is a thin seed , a little like that of a fig. The fruit is not prejudicial to health , but it is insipid .
The bats commonly feed on it , and multitudes of them nest in the tufted branches of the tree .
" I found no species which would answer this description , which if accurate indicates a species formerly extant , now extinct , or at least of which all the large individuals are destroyed , only young and inconspicuous ones left .
Mr. Horne showed me in the Botanic Gardens at Pamplemousses , Mauritius , a third species of Ficus which lie said Mr. Duncan got from Bodriguez , but I do not know what this is .

Latanier .
Pound in every part of the island .
Perhaps no plant on the island is put to more uses than the Latanier .
The wood is very hard and durable , of a rich mottled black appearance , and used for building huts , though now this is interdicted as the trees are becoming more scarce .
The leaves are chiefly used for thatching huts and are also made into baskets .
The fibres of the petiole form a very excellent material for cordage and the reticulum is also put to various uses .
Male and female trees exist in about equal numbers .
This is the Latania aurea of horticulturists , and has been known in Europe for some years .
The original description of the plant in 111 .
Fort .
l.c. errs in the description of the pyrense , which are represented as inverted , the apex being described as the base and vice versa .
Leguat speaks of this tree as the " plantane , " and thus quaintly describes it , \#151 ; " The plantane is a sort of palm tree , and the arborists place it in the same class .
Our plantanes have a straight trunk , which seems to be formed of large rings at an equal distance .
They have no such prickly scales as I have talked of in the palm tree .
At the top of the trunk is a cabbage , very like to that of the palm tree .
At the foot of this cabbage instead of palm boughs are broad leaves , with stalks about six or seven foot long ; these leaves are strong and thick , and like a fan when it is open ; the sticks of which come a little out of the circumference , and are pointed at the end .
Some of these leaves are eight foot diameter , insomuch that they served to make rare coverings for our cabins .
We cut 'em out into little pieces , and made hats and umbrello 's of them .
The stalk is four inches broad , an inch thick , and a little roundish at the sides ; at the bottom where it joy ns to the tree , it widens and grows like a flat shell which sticks to the trunk , and in part embraces it .
This wide and hollow plate is sometimes above a foot diameter , and of the thickness of a crown piece .
We made use of it for dishes , plates , and sawcers .
The first rind of the stalk served us instead of ropes , and the fibres of the second made good thread to sow with .
One might have wove stuffs with it , had it been prepared .
" We cou 'd not perceive any difference in the taste , or in any other qualities of the palm tree or plantane .
This liquor is whitish like white whey , and so sweet , that no other sweetness , if I may judge of it , can compare to it : the newer it is , the more agreeable .
In three or fuor days it begins to turn sour , and in seven or eight , it is as sharp as the strongest vinegar , without changing its colour .
" The dates of the plantane are bigger than those of the palm tree .
Having abundance of better things to feed on , fish and flesh , fruits , \amp ; c. , we left the dates for the turtles and other birds , particularly the , of which we shall hereafter make mention , cc About the cabbage of the plantane , near the bottom of it , and between the stalks of its broad leaves , is a sort of cotton of a limon colour , which all thro IS .

A palm spread over the whole island , hut never occurring on the coralline limestone .
It is of a very striking appearance by reason of the bulging which takes place in the stem towards the middle , the stem on both sides of the swelling decreasing in size .
If the tree be lofty , there may be a second ventricosity .
But the tree seems rarely to attain an altitude above 20-25 feet .
The external hard part of the stem is very thin , not more than an inch thick , and within it is a soft succulent mass of cellular tissue and fibro~vascular bundles .
The juice from this tree is said by the inhabitants not only to be unwholesome , hut even poisonous , causing , if taken in small quantities , severe emesis .
The leaves have an exceedingly plumose appearance , and with their yellow stripe beneath are very picturesque .
The parts of the tree are put to no use .
Syophorbe , to which the species belongs , is a Mascarene genus represented by only three species .

This palm is very abundant in Bodriguez , growing freely both on the volcanic soil and on the coralline limestone .
It has for many years been cultivated in the gardens of Europe as Areca aurea .
The genus Areca has long been a receptacle for many species of doubtful affinity , but " VVendland has recently revised the genus and removed therefrom many of its hitherto contained species .
As a result of his revision the genus is unrepresented in the Mascarene islands .
Some Mascarene species are referred , as already noted , to Hyophorbe ; two others , Areca , Bory , and A. crinita , Bory , constitute the endemic Mascarene genus , and the old Areca , Bory , is the type of a new genus , Dictyosperma .
This is a very variable plant , and by reason of this several garden names have been given to its forms under cultivation .
Thus we have Dictyosperma furfur aceum , D. , and D. aureum .
These are , however , all varieties of the one palm , Dictyosperma , " Wendl .
, and the last mentioned is that form which occurs in Bodriguez .
Leguat mentions only one species of \lt ; c palm tree " in Bodriguez , and it is difficult to determine whether he refers to or Dictyosperma .
lie thus describes it.\#151 ; " Our palm trees are commonly 30-40 ft. high , their trunk is straight and without leaves , but it is covered with a sort of prickly scales , whose prickles stand out a little .
Some have a smoother bark than others .
On the top of the trunks grow those boughs of palm , of which no man ever saw a lively picture .
These boughs form a great knot and fall down all about it in plumes .
Below these boughs , or rathei IS .
BAILEY BALFOUR .
below the trunk from which they grow , are produced long bunches , each fruit or grain as big as a hen 's egg , and of the same shape , known by the name of dates .
" In the center of this great knot , and at the summit of the trunk , is what we call the cabbidge .
One cannot see it , being hidden by the boughs that rise a little all about it .
This summit consists of tender leaves which closely embrace each other , join together , and form a mass something like that of a cabbage lattice , or common cabbage ; it is about two foot high if the tree is large , and of the same bigness with the trunk .
The large outside leaves of this mass are white , soft , pliable , and as strong as buff , which it resembles .
They will serve also for linen , satin , for napkins , table-cloths , and any thing what you please .
The membrana , or inside leaves , are tender and brittle , like the heart of a lattice .
They are good to eat raw , and taste like a filberd ; but we made a.n admirable ragout of them when we fricasi 'd them with the fat and liver of a turtle .
We put them also in our soops .
" We come now to the liquor , or rather the nectar of the Isle of Rodrigo .
It is called palm-wine all over the Indies .
There are two ways of drawing out the juice .
We make a hole in the trunk of the tree at about a man 's height , as big as one 's two fists .
We presently put a pot or other vessel there to receive the delicious liquor , which runs out fast enough , otherwise we dig the cabbage , and make a little cistern at its head .
We need only go twice or thrice a day and draw this rare wine at the fountain head , and we may be abundantly supplied with it .
The wine of the trunk , and that of the cabbage , are in my opinion of an equal goodness .
But those who would be good husbands of their trees ( for as for us we were lavish enough of them ) , the first way is the best , because after the cabbage has yielded its liquor for about a month , it withers , and the tree decays and dies .
It is the same thing if you tear off the cabbage , when its head and brain are gone it dies almost suddenly .
" Whereas if you only pierce its side the tree do 's not die , provided the wound is not too deep ; but the liquor will not run out at that hole above four days .
The wounded tree must afterward have time to recover .
I do not know what is done elsewhere , but I can tell by experience what I have said here , we having made trial of it daily for two years together .
The bark of this tree is very hard , it is an inch thick , porous and tender in the inside .
If one make the hole on the side of the trunk too wide , there is reason to fear 'twill weaken the tree there , and that then the next hurricane will break it .
" " The fruit or grain as big as a hen 's egg " makes it difficult to refer his palm to either Hyophorbe or Dietyosperma , and points rather to the Latanier .
And then the trunk " covered with a sort of prickly scales whose prickles stand out a little , " does not agree well with either , and least with But then he says afterwards , " The bark of this tree is very hard , it is an inch thick , porous and " tender in the inside , " which more nearly corresponds with Hyophorbe than with Dictyosperma .
But , on the other hand , the inhabitants say the juice of Verschaffelti , Cli .
Lem .
, is poisonous , whilst Leguat and his companions seem to have used it much .
It is then a difficult matter to decide , but if we discard the statement as to the size of the fruit , I think we may most safely consider that Leguat failed to diagnose two species of Palm tree , and in his description includes both species .
And as pointing in this direction I think we may take his remark " Some have a smoother bark than others ; " for the bark of Hyophorbe .
felti , Ch. Lem .
is much smoother than that of Dictyosperma , Wendl .
Cocos nucifera , Linn. A few trees of this occur in the compound of the Government House at Port Matliurin , and one or two trees are found on the south side of the island .
The introduction of this plant was on this wise as described by Leguat:\#151 ; " The sea " having thrown us up some Cocos which began to bud , we planted some of that " fruit some months after our arrival , and when we left the place , the trees were " four foot high .

Vacoa cale rouge , V. cale blanc , Y. sac , V. poteau , Y. parasol , V. male .
It is a very variable tree , and the popular names indicate this .
It occurs very abundantly everywhere on the island from the seashore to the highest points .
And according to its situation , its habit and appearance vary .
Thus when on sites exposed to the wind it has a stunted habit .
The branches are few , thick , and short , and the leaves are also short and are erect .
In such situations it is known as the Vacoa cale .
The inhabitants make a distinction between two varieties of this according as the head , peduncle , and united parts of the drupes are red , or are greenish yellow or yellow .
The former they style rouge the latter blanc .
The first of the characters on which they base their varieties by the colour of the head and peduncle is worthless , and the difference in colour of the bases of the drupes is found in all the forms of the species , but is not sufficient to characterise varieties .
If the tree grows in suitable soil , and iq a sheltered position where it has room to develop its branches properly , then it forms a dense and compact dome and the branches may droop downwards , so far as almost to conceal the stem , and is then known as Vacoa 'parasol .
When in any situation the tree develops a trunk of good size , and is allowed to grow until the wood is hard and firm to the centre , and is capable of being used as a post for a house , then the tree is called V. poteau .
The name V. sac is given to the young plants when the leaves are long and broad , and may be made into bags or sacs .
V. male is of course the male tree , known by the inhabitants as not bearing fruit .
It is not only in habit that the tree varies , but few plants exhibit such an amount of variation in the fruit and it well deserves its specific designation .
It is impossible here to enter into a consideration of these which will form the subject of a separate memoir .
This species belongs to the TItilis group of the species of JPandanus .
It has a close affinity with P. utilis , but is sufficiently distinguished in habit and in fruit .
3b 2 Leguat gives a curious description of the Screw pines of Rodriguez as follows:_______ " Among the great number and variety of trees in this island planted by nature , there is one which is wonderful and worthy our particular observation for its " beauty , bigness , roundness , and the rare symmetry of its exact branches , the ends " of which are very much tufted , and its leaves so great and thick that they fall " down almost to the ground all about it , so that come which way you will at this " tree , you can perceive but a small part of its trunk , and that at the bottom of it , " and sometimes you can see nothing at all of it .
It being as one may imagine , all " shady in the middle ; the branches are within-side like dry poles , which seem to " be the work of a carpenter , and set there to bear up the plumes or branches which " are quite about it , and thus make a sort of cage or tent of the tree .
It is true , the " greatest beauty of this tent , is in its charming outside , though the coolness and " shelter of the inside have also their charms : it was unhappy that its fruit was not " good to eat .
Those of us who had the curiosity to eat it , found it sour , and knew " by experience that was all the hurt that was in it .
It had the smell of a very " fine quince .
It is a sort of a grape , the seeds of which are close and altogether ; " it looked at a distance like the fruit of the ananas , for which reason we used to " call these trees Ananas , tlio ' there 's a great difference between the two plants : " as for me I vras calling it the pavilion or tent .
The leaves are of an admirable " green , and the stalks of them are so short , that one wou 'd think they grew imme- " diately to the wood .
The greatest are four or five inches broad , sharp at the end , " and about five inches long .
They form a great bunch , and here and there one " may see the grapes , which are of divers colours , according as they are more or less " ripe .
I have often taken pleasure to survey these natural palaces , and was " equally ravished with its largeness and singular beauty .

Yacoa cbevron .
A small and very graceful tree , usually growing in clusters and forming frequently a very regular dome .
It is confined to the higher parts of the island and the upper parts of valleys .
Though nearly allied to , it is easily distinguished from the foregoing by its arching narrow delicate leaves , and its few large druped fruits .
It is also a very much smaller plant .
But certain trees on the island seem to possess characters intermediate between these two species and may be hybrids .
This is , however , a difficult matter to settle .
Its local name is derived from its common use as a rafter for huts , for which its close-grained and hard wood when mature well fits it .
These are the only two species I found on the island , but Sir Henry Barkly lias sent home figures of two ( and of one a specimen ) other species from the island .
These are P. utilis , Bory , and P. odoratissimus , Linn. f. His figures and specimen of the former are most distinctly those of P. utilis , Bory , but whilst 1 do not dispute the fact that this plant may have existed or may exist on the island , I may notice that Sir Henry Barkly 's drawing and specimen are of a tree grown in the Botanic Garden in Mauritius from seeds which Mr. Duncan is said to have brought from Bodriguez .
I think this takes away considerably from the value of the observation , especially as the trees Mr. Horne pointed out to me as from Bodriguez are growing closely surrounded by Mauritius ones .
At the same time I may remark that in the young state , before many branches have been given off , P. utilis , Bory , and P. heterocarpus , Balf .
fil .
, are so much alike as to be almost undistinguishable , and I may have in that way missed P. utilis , Bory , in Bodriguez .
As to P. odoratissimus , Linn , f. , I can only say I never saw it , and it must be very scarce , if there at all ; and it seems to me very strange that such a very marked form should be unknown by the inhabitants , especially as several of them were employed by Mr. Jenner , the magistrate of the island , at the request of Sir Henry Barkly , to collect Pandani for him .
Mr. Horne showed me trees of this in the Botanic Gardens at Mauritius , said to have grown from seeds brought from Bodriguez by Mr. Duncan , and as this may have been the source of Sir IT .
Barkly 's figures the same objection may be urged as in the case of P. utilis , Bory .
It seems to me very strange that no mention is made by Sir H. Barkly of P. Balf .
fil .
, from Bodriguez , which is very abundant , whilst P. utilis , Bory , and P. odor atissimus , Linn. f. must be very scarce , if there .
Bojer in his Hortus Mauritianus says of P. muricatus , Pet. Thouars , that it grows naturally at Rodriguez .
I believe Bojer visited Rodriguez , and he ought to have known the Pandani , but he says nothing about P. heterocarpus , Balf .
fil .
or P. Balf .
fil .
, which are so common on the island .
He appends to his notice of P. , Pet. Thouars , that some trunks are to be found at Grand Port .
To recognise a species of Pandanus by leaves , fruit , and stem is in many cases difficult enough , but to discriminate species by stems only is very fallacious , if not impossible .
I am convinced the species does not now exist on the island ; and , indeed , Petit Thouars only recorded it from Madagascar .
In the Botanic Gardens in Mauritius a species was shown me by Mr. Horne which he supposed might be P. , Pet. Thouars , but this is merely a form of P. utilis , Bory , with drupes much divided at the apex .

, a plant of which the leaves have a reddish and dried appearance was found .
Other specimens of a pale green and fresher look were obtained in the valley PJviere Grande des Bamboux ( Cascade ) .

c. considers the plants from both localities one species as above described .
Professor MacNab informs me that he believes the two forms belong to different species , and he thus describes them :\#151 ; Eorm 1 .
Growing on coralline limestone .
Large leaves ovate , rather obtuse , twit l'ng3 two broad , margin serrated , midrib central , base ivide , lower side rounded not produced , upper side produced not so short , denticulate auricle ; small leaves two l'ngs two broad , contracted below , widest above middle , then narrowed into an acute point , margin of leaf denticulate , base with lower side produced into a long denticulate auricle , inner margin with a very minute auricle .
Eorm 2 .
Growing in moist localities in valley Eiviere Grande des Bamhoux ( Cascade ) .
Large leaves elongate , widest in middle , narrowed towards each end , apex rather blunt yet pointed , Tiiiycr long , twtct broad , upper side erf with rounded outline , lower side nearly straight and less serrated , vein nearer lower than upper margin , base auricled , upper auricle long curved and almost lower ciliate and denticulate ; small leaves long and Titw broad , contracted below , widest above middle , then narrowed into an acute point , margin denticulate , base 3 c with outer margin produced into a large denticulate auricle , inner margin with a very minute auricle .

Professor MacNab says of this plant , " the form of the large leaves " is like 8 .
concmna , Spring .
, but the expression ' foliis rigidis longe biauriculatis ' \#171 ; \#171 ; can hardly apply , the leaves being soft , thin , and with very small auricles .
Then " the small leaves are much more oblique , and by no means * aristato-mucronatis .
' " The species comes near one I have from Kew Gardens cultivated as 8 .
concinna , " but locality unknown to me .

There are specimens of a Nephrodium ( ) grown by Lady Barkly at Beduit , which is said to have come originally from Bodriguez , in the Herbarium at the Botanic Gardens , Mauritius .
I do not know what species , and I did not gather it .
In a letter to me at Bodriguez , Mr. Horne mentions that in 1864 a collector brought from Bodriguez Nephrolepis splendens , but there must be some mistake as to the name , as there is no such species .
IAndsaya acutifolia , Besv .
