[ Nov. 27 , Between the first and second group Lecoq de Boisbaudran gives a line which was not noticed by us in the arc .
In the second group the two middle lines are very close , and Lecoq de Boisbaudran gives only their mean wave-length .
Measuring the distances of the middle from the extreme lines of the group , the wavelengths of this quartet are 5355 , 5338 , 5334*5 , 5319 .
These are all about of equal brightness , but we have not seen the third ( 5334*5 ) reversed .
The third group consists of the lines 5112 , 5098 , 5095 , 5081 .
Of these the second is not given by Lecoq de Boisbaudran , and only the first has been seen by us reversed .
Three lines given by Lecoq de Boisbaudran between the third and fourth groups are not seen in the arc , or at least are not nearly so conspicuous as the groups here described .
The fourth group consists of lines for which we find the wavelengths about 4964 , 4956,4950 , 4942 .
Of these the first and last only are given by Lecoq de Boisbaudran as 4963 and 4936 .
The fifth group has lines of which we find the wave-lengths about 4870 , 4863 , 4856 , 4850 .
The sixth group has lines of about the wave-lengths 4808 , 4803 , 4796 , 4788 .
The seventh group is too faint and diffuse to be distinctly resolved .
The wave-length of the least refrangible edge is about 4759 .
None of these last three groups are seen by Lecoq de Boisbaudran , and they are too diffuse for exact measurement ; on the other hand , he gives several other lines which are not noticed by us in the arc .
As in the case of sodium the repetition of these quartets of lines at decreasing intervals with decreasing brightness and sharpness as they proceed from the less to the more refrangible , gives the impression of a series of harmonics ; but the wave-lengths do not seem to be in a simple harmonic progression , though simple harmonic relations may be found between some of the groups .

Received November 18 , 1879 .
The experiments of which the results are here given were all made in the Chemical Laboratory of the Royal Institution , with the powerful electric current from the Siemens dynamo-electric machine .
Limestone crucibles similar to those before employed were in all cases used , but the opening through which the arc was observed was in general placed 1879 .

403- horizontally , so that the axis of the collimator of the spectroscope was directed immediately on to the arc without the intervention of a mirror , and a small vertical opening was made for the introduction of the substances under observation , and was closed when not in use by a piece of lime .
With sodium carbonate the green pair wave-lengths 4983,4982 were reversed , showing dark lines in the middle of the bright ones , the less-refrangible of the two giving the stronger dark line .
The sodium line given by Lecoq de Boisbaudran at wave-length 4670 showed as a diffuse blue band with a pair of fine dark lines in it , of which the-stronger and more lasting was the less refrangible .
The diffuse blue-band resolved itself into two diffuse lines as the sodium carbonate evaporated , and the measurement of their positions in comparison with a conspicuous titanium line , which lies between them , and was made to show at the same time by introducing a fragment of titanic oxide into the crucible , gave for this sodium pair the wave-lengths 4667 , 4664. .
The orange pair , wave-lengths 6160 , 6154 , were also seen reversed in like manner , but we failed to detect any difference in the strength or continuance of the dark lines in this case .
These reversals of sodium lines were many times observed , and we noticed that the reversals of the other pairs continued after that of the red pair had ceased to be visible , that next after the disappearance of the dark lines in the red pair those in the diffuse blue pair ceased to be visible , then the dark lines in the green pair , and then those in the yellowish-green ( 5687 , 5681 ) .
In some cases when a large quantity of sodium carbonate was put into the crucible a curious double reversal occurred .
In the middle of an enormous dark expansion of D a bright yellow band appeared , which in turn had a narrower dark band , or a pair of dark lines , in its middle .
A similar double reversal of the lithium blue line occurred so far as to I show a bright line in the middle of the dark one .
Of the two violet lines of potassium we observed that the more refrangible remained ' reversed longer than the other .
In addition to the reversals of calcium lines before observed by us , jr we have noticed the reversal of all the more conspicuous calcium lines * of the Gr group , viz. , those wave-lengths\#151 ; 4282,4289,4298 , 4397 , 4318 , I besides 4302 before noted , also that of4379 , and all three lines of a triplet I 4585,4581,4578 .
The finer lines , wave-lengths 4434*3,4454*5 , slightly less refrangible than the strong lines 4434 , 4454 , were reversed , but - only when one of the poles was a bar of iron , instead of carbon .
The h strong lines just mentioned were expanded so as to cover their neigh-1 hours , and all four lines were seen black against the bright back-H ground in the positions and of the same .relative strengths as when 1 bright .
When strontium chloride was put into the crucible the lines with I the following wave-lengths , besides those before noted , were observed 404 Profs .

[ Nov. 27 , reversed\#151 ; 4305 , 4865 , 4892 , 5223 , 5225 , 5228 , 5480 , 5503 , 5522 , and momentarily only , 5155 , 5238 , 5256 .
Besides these , many dark hands were observed in the less refrangible part of the spectrum , of which three , with wave-lengths 5920 , 6035 , 6060 , appear to he identical with bright bands ascribed to strontia , and one , with wave-length 6597 , is identical with a bright line given by strontium chloride .
Manganese , introduced as sulphate , gave with facility the violet triplet , 4029 , 4032 , 4033 as dark lines on the continuous background .
The bright blue lines of manganese were not , however , reversed until some metallic magnesium was introduced .
This brought out the reversal of the lines , wave-lengths 4753,4783 , and 4823 , the last being the most easily reversed of the three .
Lead introduced in the metallic state gave a reversal of the violet line , wave-length 4058 , which Cornu had previously seen reversed , but this reversal was far better seen , becoming a wide black band , when the lead was introduced as an alloy with zinc .
Probably the lead vapour was not so rapidly oxidised when mixed with zinc , and a thicker , if less dense , stratum interposed between the arc and the spectroscope .
When lead ferrocyanide was used , not only the line above mentioned was reversed , but also much less strongly , a line near it , wave-length 4062 .
With zinc , only the less refrangible two of the three blue lines , wave-lengths 4810 , 4721 , were seen reversed .
The very bright lines , wave-lengths 4924 , 4911 , seen in the spark between zinc poles , were not seen by us at all in the arc , resembling in this respect the magnesium line , wave-length 4481 , and the cadmium lines , wave-lengths \#166 ; 5377 , 5336 .
When cadmium was put into the crucible the lines , wave-length 5085 , 4799 , and 4677 , were reversed , not the line , wave-length 4415 .
With a large dose of cadmium the red line , wave-length 6438 , was once seen reversed for an instant only .
With silver , besides the reversals before observed by us , the line , wave-length 4053 , showed a dark line in the middle of its expansion as noticed by Mr. Lockyer , but we could see no reversal of the line , wave-length 4208 .
Instead of the reversal of this line we observed that a second bright line came out close to it , rather diffuse , and about midway between the line 4208 and the calcium line 4215 .
By measuring the intervals and interpolating , we deduced 4211'3 for the wavelength of this silver line , which we could see , though it was fainter , in the less powerful current of a De Meritens ' machine .
This second line coming out near the other silver line gave the appearance of a reversal in the middle of a diffuse line , but besides the measurements made with a micrometer we assured ourselves of the fact of there being two lines by watching the fading of the second line as the silver \lt ; evaporated .
The use of an alloy of zinc With silver did not alter 1879.1 On the Reversal of the Lines of Metallic Vapours .
405the appearance of these two lines , or bring out a reversal of either of them .
We failed to see any line of silver either bright or reversed with wave-length about 4240 , as mentioned by Cornu , whether the silver were used pure or alloyed with zinc or with lead .
With the carbons arranged vertically as shown in our last communication on this subject , p. 472 ( vol. xxviii ) , and the light viewed through the perforated carbon , silver gave a channelled spectrum as described by Lockyer and Roberts .
As this channelled spectrum was not seen with silver in any other arrangement of our crucibles , we are led to attribute it to a comparatively cool condition of the silver vapour ascending the .
carbon tube , a condition of near approach to a state of liquefaction .
Having observed that lines frequently came out with mixtures which were not visible when the separate ingredients were used , we tried a few amalgams .
None of these showed any reversals of the-mercury lines .
But an amalgam of bismuth gave readily the reversal of the bismuth line , wave-length 4722 , and with more difficulty that of the line , wave-length 4119 .
Antimony did not appear to give any lines , or none easily distinguishable , in the arc .
With copper we observed the reversal of two lines only , wavelength 5105 , 5153 .
Iron introduced as metal , or as chloride , in the usual way , gave us no reversal ; with an iron rod used as positive pole instead of one of the carbons , we succeeded in getting the reversal of one line , wavelength 4045 , which expanded and showed a fine dark line in its middle ; bat by passing an iron wire into the arc through the positive carbon , which was perforated in the manner described in our last communication on this subject ( p. 472 ) , for the introduction of gases into the arc , and pushing in the wire slowly as the end burned away , we succeeded in reversing several of the brightest of the iron lines .
The three violet lines , wave-lengths 4045 , 4063 , 4071 , were the first to be reversed .
They all expanded before showing reversal , and the order of reversal was that of refrangibility .
Besides these the lines , wavelengths 4957 , 4920 ( the stronger and less refrangible of a pair ) , 4404 , 4383 , 4325 , 5040 , 4307 ( G ) were reversed .
These last two lines could not be certainly distinguished from calcium lines , as the last is almost if not quite coincident with a calcium line , and the other is too close to a calcium line to be distinguished without more exact measurement than the time during which it could be observed would allow , but we judged from their relative intensity that they were the iron lines .
The line , wave-length 4415 , was not seen reversed when the other bright lines near it were reversed .
Nickel , whether put into the crucible in the old way , or fed into the arc in small fragments filling a platinum tube which was passed | through a perforated carbon pole , gave no definite reversal of any of Anniversary Meeting .
[ Dec. 1 , its lines ; nor did cobalt , even when a bar of cobalt was used as the positive pole .
Tin , palladium , and platinum gave no reversals .
It is worthy of remark in regard to the difficulty of obtaining substances chemically pure , that we found that carbon poles which had been for some hours ignited in a current of chlorine and further intensely heated in the arc , while chlorine was passed through perforations down their axes , still showed in the arc , of course without any crucible being employed , a multitude of lines , amongst which the so-called carbon lines and those of calcium and iron were conspicuous .
