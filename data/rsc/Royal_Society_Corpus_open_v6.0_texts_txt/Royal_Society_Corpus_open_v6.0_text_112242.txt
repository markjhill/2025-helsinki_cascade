" On the Nerves of the Liver , Biliary Ducts , and Gallbladder .
" By ROBERT LEE , M.D. , F.R.S. Received August 18 , 1862 .
( Abstract .
) After adverting to the deficiency of existing knowledge respecting the distribution and arrangement of the nerves of the liver , the author states that he has recently made dissections which " prove that all the arteries which ramify throughout the substance of the liver , even the most minute , are accompanied with nerves , on which 246 there are enlargements resembling ganglia , and that the hepatic ducts and gall-bladder are largely supplied with these gangliform plexuses of nerves , which all arise from the semilunar ganglion and solar plexus .
" In a Postscript , received October 4 , 1862 , the author adds , that from an elaborate dissection which he has made since the date of the paper , " it is demonstrated " 1 .
That the nerves of the liver take their origin from ganglia situated around the root of the hepatic artery , which are intimately connected with , or actually form a part of , the semilunar ganglion of the great sympathetic .
" 2 .
That the hepatic nerves , thus originating , proceed to the liver along with the hepatic artery , hepatic veins , the vena portee , and the hepatic ducts .
" 3 .
That the hepatic nerves , on reaching the liver , send numerous branches to the different lobes , along with the ramifications of the hepatic artery to every part of the organ , and that plexuses of nerves accompany the most minute branches of the arteries .
" 4 .
That the hepatic and cystic ducts are surrounded with plexuses of ganglia and nerves , and that nerves accompany the arteries of the gall-bladder throughout their distribution .
" 5I .
That besides these nerves , accompanying the trunk and branches of the hepatic artery and surrounding the cystic and hepatic ducts , there is a great system of ganglionic nerves distributed to the walls of the vena portee .
