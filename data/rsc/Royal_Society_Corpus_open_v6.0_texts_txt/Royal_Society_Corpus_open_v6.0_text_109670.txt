] Mr. Goldingham 's observations are prefaced by a short account of the instruments employed , and some general remarks upon the circumstances necessary to be attended to , in drawing inferences from them .
Two telescopes were employed , both made by Dollond , of 31 feet focal length , with a magnifying power between 70 and 80 ; and the time observed by a good clock , with gridiron pendulum , was deduced from the transit of the sun nearest to the eclipse , and verified by the next preceding or following transit .
The longitude of the place of observation is given , as determined from numerous observations of various kinds , that it may be compared with that deduced from each eclipse by means of the time given in the ephemeris .
In noting each observation , the state of the weatheL is attended to , the altitude of the planet , the relative situation of the planet and moon , with any other circumstances of twilight or haze that were likely to cause any incorrectness in the observation .
To obviate the uncertainty that will always attend the results of such observations , from different states of weather , difference of telescopes , and imperfection of vision in different observers , Mr. Goldingham recommends not to draw any inference from comparison of corresponding immersions alone , without attending to the difference of corresponding emersions also , by which all sources of error will be in a great degree corrected .
