Literature.\#151 ; 1 .
In 1697 Camerarius described , amongst hexagonal plates of hoar frost , some slightly depressed in the middle .
2 .
In 1874 Krenner described and illustrated hollow hexagonal ice crystals found in the ice cave of Dobschau .
His remarks on their formation and attachment are , however , quite at Variance with our observations .
3 .
In 1889 Assmann described and illustrated the forms of hoar frost ; but his illustrations only show flat fronds growing in one dimension .
VII .
Conclusions.\#151 ; 1 .
Water , when changing direct from the gaseous into the solid state , is highly crystalline .
2 .
The tendency to crystallisation is so strong that in those cases where the area of supply is limited by a wall or other heterogeneous surface , skeleton crystals\#151 ; hexagonal " hoppers " \#151 ; are formed , growing away from that wall , even under circumstances of excessively slow growth .
3 .
Calmness of air seems to be an essential condition for their formation .
4 .
The natural example of crystallisation of water limited to certain directions is given in hoar frost , showing a very marked tendency to form hexagonal hoppers .
5 .
From our observations , there can be no doubt as to the identity of the ice crystals of Surtshellir , of the refrigerating chambers and ships in Liverpool , and of the cooling cellars of the Berlin breweries , with natural hoar frost .
