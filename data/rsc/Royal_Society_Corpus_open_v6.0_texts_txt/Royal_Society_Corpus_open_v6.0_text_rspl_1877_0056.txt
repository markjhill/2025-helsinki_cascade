( Abstract .
) When a solution containing silver and potassium nitrates , in equiva-ent proportions , is evaporated , the potassium nitrate separates out , un-ombined with silver nitrate .
If , however , the ratio of silver nitrate to \gt ; otassium nitrate be increased beyond a certain limit ( which has been letermined ) , then a true double salt having the composition AgN03KN03 :rystallizes out .
The same salt can also be formed from a solution that ivould not yield it under ordinary circumstances , by either adding nitric icid or by increasing the temperature of the solution , both these alterations tending in the same direction , viz. to decrease the amount of silver nitrate as compared to that of potassium nitrate which can exist in solution .
Further it is shown , with regard to these two salts , that if an intimate mixture of them be treated with an amount of water insufficient to dissolve the whole of either constituent , still the composition of the solution found will vary with the composition of the mixture used .
This arises from the two salts uniting in solution to form the double salt , and ultimately the amount of double salt that can remain in solution depending on the excess of silver nitrate present , which , from its greater solubility , can displace the double salt from solution .
The residue in this case , from its crystalline form , can be identified as double salts .
With sodium nitrate a corresponding double salt does not form .
In this case , on evaporating the solution it is the silver nitrate , not the * .
The experiments here described were shown in the Mathematical and Physical Section of the British Association at the meeting held at Glasgow , in September 1876 , and further in the temporary collection prepared in the Helvingrove Museum at Glasgow , for that meeting of the Association .
As they were arranged expressly for testing and illustrating the theoretical views contained in a paper previously submitted to the Royal Society , the present brief account of them is offered here to the Society 88 a sequel to that previous paper .

[ June 21 , sodium nitrate , which is the first to separate out , notwithstanding its being by far the more soluble salt of the two .
The solution obtained bj treatment of the two salts with insufficient water does not vary in composition , as is the case with the potassium salt , and this is known to be a strong confirmation of the statement of the non-existence of a double salt of silver and sodium .
With ammonium nitrate a double salt is formed corresponding to the potassium salt .
In this case , owing to the similar degree of solubility oi both constituents , it forms on the evaporation of a solution containing the salts in the proportion of single equivalents .
On treatment of the salts with insufficient water for solution the same thing happens as with the potassium salts .
With lithium nitrate no double salt could be formed ; but on the evaporation of a solution having the two salts in equivalent proportions , it is the very soluble silver nitrate which is the first to separate out .
Again , the composition of the solution obtained by treating different amounts of the dry salts with insufficient water to dissolve them gives in all cases a liquid of constant composition .
With lead nitrate no double salt was formed .
On evaporation , in this case , it is the least soluble , the lead nitrate , which is the first to separate out .
When two salts are together in solution , in some cases the more soluble , in others the less soluble , will be the first to separate out on evaporation ; this action appears to depend on the affinity of the salt fcr water\#151 ; its hygroscopic character , not its solubility .
The distinctive character of the double salt is confirmed by its crystalline form , which is similar in the two cases of the potassium- and the ammonium-silver salt .

Crystals of potassium nitrate , containing less silver nitrate than the , uble salt , gave angles according somewhat closely with those of ordi-ry nitre ; but the crystals did not give very good reflections .
The results obtained by Rose with sodium nitrate containing silver trate were confirmed so far as the crystals permitted of measurement .
Crystals of strontium nitrate containing silver nitrate gave excellent iasurements , according with those of a eubo-octahedron .
