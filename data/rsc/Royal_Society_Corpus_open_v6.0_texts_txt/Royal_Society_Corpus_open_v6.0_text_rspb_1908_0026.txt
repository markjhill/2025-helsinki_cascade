283 Introduction .
Although a special formative power has been assigned to glycogen ever since the widespread distribution of this substance in the growing tissues of embryos became known , no systematic quantitative investigations into the glycogenic changes of the embryo have yet been made .
The histological observations of Maximow* and of Chipmanf on the placenta of the rabbit showed that glycogen appears in the walls of the maternal placenta at about the 8th day of pregnancy , and increases in amount until a maximum is reached at the 12\#151 ; 16th day .
After mid-term the glycogen diminishes , and completely disappears at the end of gestation from that part of the maternal placenta which is next to the foetal part of the placenta .
In the foetal placenta no glycogen could be demonstrated histologically .
In Ruminants , conditions differ entirely from the rabbit .
Bernard himself , in investigations extending over several years , failed to find glycogen in the * Maximow , ' Zeitschrift fiir Mikroskopische Anatomy , ' vol. 51 , 1898 , p. 68 .

Glycogenic Changes [ Jan. 1 , placentae of sheep and cows .
He did , however , find it in the flattened or papilliform bodies with which the umbilical cord and the internal surface of the amnion are covered , the quantity increasing up to mid-term and then decreasing .
Lately Jenkinson* has again investigated sheep 's placentae histologically and found glycogen in the uterine epithelium and trophoblast of the extracotyledonary region ; there was none apparently in the maternal cotyledons and none in the villi .
The time of origin of the glycogenic function of the liver has long been a subject of controversy .
While Bernardf and Barfurthj concluded from their investigations that the liver first functioned as a glycogen-secreting organ about the middle of intra-uterine life , PfliigerS proved by means of his more reliable method that small quantities of glycogen are present in the liver at much earlier stages .
According to this author , the foetal liver shows the same behaviour with regard to its glycogenic function as the adult liver , and since his material was obtained from the slaughter-house , he ascribed the small amount of glycogen found in the foetal liver to the imperfect feeding of the mother animals before they are slaughtered .
The recent work of Lubarsch , || Gierke,1F Adamoff , ** and especially the detailed chemical investigation of Mendel and Leavenworth , ff have proved that foetal tissues are not so rich in glycogen as adult tissues , as was believed formerly .
While the earlier observers concluded from their observations that glycogen was an essential constituent of tissues in which a rapid cell formation and cell development take place , the later authors deny that there is any relation between the energy of growth of embryonic tissues and their glycogen metabolism .
The present investigation is an attempt to throw light on the part played by glycogen in the development of the foetus by means of a systematic investigation on the glycogenic changes in an age-series of foetal animals .
Methods .
For this investigation rabbits were used .
The animals were kept in the laboratory , and the date of insemination was noted in each case .

] in the Placenta and Foetus of the Pregnant Rabbit .
265 it was possible to obtain an accurate and almost complete age-series from the 14th day to the end of pregnancy .
As a rule , the material for such investigations is obtained from the slaughter-house , and the age of a foetus is determined by its size or by its weight .
Under normal conditions this is a perfectly reliable method , and material can be obtained much more easily in this way ; but it does not take into account the possible occurrence of conditions in which the foetuses have an abnormally low weight or an abnormally small size .
It will be seen that we have met such conditions , and that they have given us interesting and suggestive results , which could not have been obtained otherwise .
The material on which our observations were made is given in the following table .

Number of foetuses 5 8 8 6 5 4 8 6 7 5 3 6 9 For the estimation of glycogen , Pfliiger 's method* was used , and the special precautions recommended by him for the analysis of small organs were carefully attended to.f The maternal and foetal parts of the placenta , which admit of fairly accurate mechanical separation in the rabbit , were analysed separately .
In the foetus the glycogen was determined in the liver and in the rest of the body respectively .
The method of procedure was as follows Immediately after death the abdomen of the pregnant animal was opened and the whole uterus removed .
Each sac was opened along its convex border and the foetus extracted .
Then the foetal placenta was gently pulled asunder from the maternal and the membranes were carefully cut away from it .
Finally the maternal placenta was cut away from the uterine wall with scissors , a method which included the zone of separation with its glycogen-containing cells in the part for analysis .
In the later stages of pregnancy , the maternal placenta was detached from the uterus , and the two parts of the placenta had then to be separated from each other .
In the rabbit there is no intergrowth between maternal and foetal tissues , but the mechanical separation is not quite perfect , some of the maternal peninsulse that extend down between the foetal columns being left attached to the foetal placenta .
All the maternal placentae were then weighed and afterwards placed together in a 100-c.c .
flask , to which a heated solution of caustic potash ( 60 per cent. ) was * Pfliiger , ' Pfliiger 's Archiv , ' vol. 93 , 1903 , p. 163 .

Glycogenic Changes [ Jan. 1 , added\#151 ; 1 c.c. of the alkali for each gramme of tissue\#151 ; and kept in a boiling water bath for some hours .
The same was done with the foetal placentae .
The average weights of these two tissues per foetus may be seen in Tables II and III .
Then the foetal livers were excised , care being taken not to include any of the intestine , and to empty the gall-bladder , which was always distended with a viscid greenish-yellow fluid .
The livers and the remainder of the foetal bodies were weighed , and each set placed in a stoppered flask of known capacity and treated like the maternal placentae .
Each tissue was liquefied by the strong alkali , except the foetal bones .
The rest of the process was .carried out in every respect as Pfliiger recommends .
The results are set down in tabular form in Tables II to Y. As the number of placentae and foetuses varied , it was necessary for purposes of comparison to calculate the results per placenta and foetus in each case .
It may be pointed out that the amount of glycogen given in these tables does not represent the total amount of glycogen actually obtained in each analysis .
This can be found by multiplying the amount given for each case with the number of foetuses for that day given in Table I. A. Glycogen of Placenta .
For a better understanding of the results , it is necessary to give a brief account of the anatomical plan of the rabbit 's placenta with its glycogen areas according to Chipman .
In the maternal placenta , three parts can be recognised\#166 ; :\#151 ; ( 1 ) That next the uterine muscle which represents the plane of separation of the placenta at the end of gestation ; ( 2 ) An intermediate part , the region of the uterine sinuses ; and ( 3 ) A part which extends up as a series of peninsulse between the foetal columns .
These columns are analogous to the villi of the human placenta , and are described by Chipman as ectodermic tubules with a plasmodial covering .
Glycogen Areas.\#151 ; In the maternal placenta , the glycogen is always contained in decidual cells , and three glycogen areas can be distinguished .
( A ) At the zone of separation .
A definite quantity of glycogen is still present in this part at the end of gestation .
( B ) In the region of the uterine sinuses lying in the multinucleate decidual cells surrounding them .
Here there is probably no glycogen left at the end of pregnancy .
( C ) In the peninsular projections .
This is the part most intimately associated with the foetal tubules , and , indeed , these projections are entirely covered by foetal ectoderm .
1908 .
] in the Placenta and Foetus of the Pregnant Rabbit .
267 When the two parts of the placenta are pulled apart , the delicate peninsulse are left attached to the foetal placenta .
In the latter no glycogen was observed by Chipman at any period of pregnancy .
Hence the glycogen obtained from the foetal placenta is not , as might appear at first sight , actually in the foetal tissue , but really belongs to the maternal placenta , and forms that part most intimately related to the foetus .
By analysing the two parts of the placenta obtained by mechanical separation , information is gained on the changes in the glycogen of two different parts of the maternal placenta .
The bulk of the maternal placenta contains the glycogen of the zone of separation ( A ) and of the region of the uterine sinuses ( B ) .
This part of the glycogen may be called for convenience the " distal glycogen .
" The glycogen in the peninsular projections ( C ) , which are left attached to the foetal placenta after mechanical separation , may be called " proximal glycogen .
" It is estimated by analysing the foetal placenta , as no glycogen can be demonstrated histologically in the foetal placenta itself .
It is possible that a small part of the glycogen extracted from the foetal placentae in this way may actually belong to the cells of the foetal tissue , as the villi , like the early foetal liver , may possess a small quantity of glycogen not demonstrable histologically .
The colour reaction with iodine was tested in several cases , because it has been found that the tint is violet-red with glycogen obtained from foetal tissues instead of the usual reddish-brown .
In no case was there any difference from the colour obtained with maternal glycogen .
Hence most of the carbohydrate extracted from the foetal placenta was probably maternal .
We shall see later that very small quantities of glycogen may be present even when histological methods fail to reveal it , but in any case the amount could not be large enough to affect materially the results obtained .
The results obtained from the analysis of parts A and B of the maternal placenta are given in Table II .
The maternal placenta has , in every case , a considerable percentage of distal glycogen , and one that is in the earlier stages quite comparable with the percentage obtained in a healthy adult rabbit 's liver .
It rises from the 14th to the 18th day .
From the 18th to the 22nd day it remains fairly constant ; then there is a continuous decrease each day until the end of gestation .
Even at the 29th day there is an appreciable amount of glycogen , which , as histological examination shows , is almost entirely situated at the zone of separation of the placental lobes , and is probably not destined for the foetus .
The most obvious phenomenon in the decidual cells of the rabbit is the presence of glycogen at a time when the foetal liver cells store only the 268 Drs. Lochhead and Cramer .

But in the last week of pregnancy the liver carries out this function for the foetus , while the placental glycogen gradually diminishes , and simultaneously with this the decidual tissue degenerates and is absorbed .
It is this connection between the healthiness of the decidual cells and their store of glycogen , on the one hand , and their degeneration after the glycogen store has been absorbed by the syncytium , on the other , which leads us to suppose that they have a definite function to fulfil during pregnancy , and do not merely exist , as is usually stated , as pabulum to be absorbed by the syncytium .
A remarkable feature of the results is the absence of individual variations .
The changes in the " proximal glycogen " are tabulated in Table III , which gives the results of the analyses of the foetal placentae with the peninsulse of the maternal placenta attached .
It is obvious that in this case no information is obtained by expressing the " proximal glycogen " belonging to the maternal placenta in terms of percentage of the foetal tissue , which is mainly foetal in origin and the weight of which may , in fact , be taken as indicating the weight of the foetal placenta .
It is worthy of note that the weight of the foetal placenta does not show a decrease in the last week of pregnancy like that seen in the maternal placenta .
The variations in the proximal glycogen follow approximately those observed in the distal glycogen .
On the 29th day there is no glycogen remaining in this part of the placenta .

Glycogenic Changes [ Jan. 1 , In every case glycogen was present , though in the earlier stages the amounts were extremely small .
Thus , at the 18th day no quantitative estimation was attempted , but the iodine reaction was positive , and the extract , after inversion with acid , reduced a small amount of Fehling 's solution .
Up to the 21st or 22nd day the amounts present were too small for accurate quantitative estimation , but the results are in all cases approximate .
It is interesting to note that glycogen cannot be demonstrated histochemically in the foetal liver before the 22nd day , and the percentage then is about 0T .
Up to the 24th day the amount of glycogen is very small , and a comparison with Table V shows that the percentage is below that of the remainder of the foetal body .
Pfhiger also obtained very small amounts in the liver of early foetuses , and sometimes had to be content with the qualitative demonstration of glycogen by the iodine reaction , even in organs weighing a considerable number of grammes .
At the same time he found the foetal muscles to possess appreciable amounts , and he seeks to explain this anomaly by the imperfect feeding of the mother animals ( sheep ) for some days before they are slaughtered .
The same objection might also be urged against some analyses we made of early foetal livers of sheep which showed only traces of glycogen .
But such an objection is inadmissible for our series of foetal rabbits , in which the pregnant animals were kept on full diet up to the time of death .
We must conclude , therefore , that during the earlier stages of development the liver contains only traces of glycogen , and has not yet taken up its glycogenic function .
After the 24th day the analyses show different results .
At the 25th day the percentage of glycogen rises , for the first time , above that of the remainder of the foetal body , and on each subsequent day there is a well-marked increase , till at the 29th day we find almost half of the total foetal glycogen stored in the liver .
Hence , though glycogen is present as early as the 18th day at least , a marked change takes place in the foetal liver about the beginning of the last week of pregnancy .
It is only then that the liver takes up its glycogenic function .
This fact accounts for the conflicting results which have been obtained by various authors from isolated observations on the glycogen content of foetal livers.* The results in no case reached the percentages obtained in maternal livers , which varied between 4T and 7'4 per cent. , while the highest figure obtained in a foetal liver was 3'4 per cent. An exceptionally low result was obtained in the case of the animal killed on the 26th day .
This animal , however , j was in an abnormal state ; one foetus was dead and the others were smaller * See Demant , ' Zeitschrift flir Physiolog .

271 than usual .
The weight and glycogen percentage of the maternal placentae were about normal , but the foetal placentae were small ; the foetal livers weighed much less than might have been expected , and the glycogen percentages of foetal bodies and foetal livers were both low .
The animal killed on the 29th day of pregnancy also gave results slightly below the normal .
C. Relationship of Placental to Foetal Liver Glycogen .
The relationship between the glycogen percentage of the placenta and foetal liver is shown in graphic form in fig. 1 .

The ordinate gives the glycogen percentage .
The glycogenic changes in the placenta are represented by the black line , those in the foetal .liver by the dotted line .
placental glycogen was taken , i.e. , the sum of the amounts found in the maternal and foetal parts of the placenta , and its percentage value was calculated from the weight of the maternal placenta .
The figure shows how closely the decrease of the percentage in the one organ is related to the increase of the percentage in the other .
This relation is so striking that one 272 Drs. Lochhead and Cramer .
Glycogenic Changes [ Jan. 1 , is led to conclude that the placenta carries out in the earlier stages of pregnancy the glycogenic function for the foetus which is fulfilled later by the foetal liver .

0-37 0-37 0*23 0-34 0-44 0-27 The great increase in the total amount of glycogen per foetus is , of course , to be expected along with the great increase in weight as pregnancy advances .
The percentage amount is also higher in the last week of pregnancy than in the period immediately preceding , but the variation is only slight .
The results agree with the work of other investigators in showing that embryonic tissues are not particularly rich in glycogen .
Relation of Foetal Growth to Glycogen Percentage.\#151 ; Fig. 2 represents graphically the increase in foetal weight and the increase in the percentage of the total foetal glycogen from the 18th day to the end of gestation , as calculated .
from Tables IY and Y. As is to be expected , the curve of the foetal growth rises as pregnancy advances .
Corresponding to this we have a general rise , not only in the total amount of glycogen , but also in the glycogen percentage of the foetus .
In the two exceptional cases where the foetal weight was lower than that of the preceding day there was also a decrease , not only in the absolute amount of glycogen , but also in the percentage , .e .
, the glycogen was decreased out of proportion .

The ordinates of the upper curve represent the glycogen percentage of the foetal organism from 0'20 to 0'60 per cent. The ordinates of the lower curve represent the weight of the foetus in grammes from 0 to 30 grammes .
The dotted lines indicate the two abnormal cases referred to in the text .
There is , therefore , a distinct parallelism between the growth of the foetus and the percentage amount of glycogen which it Contains .
As we have to deal here with an organism in which the life and growth of each single cell is not autonomous , but is dependent upon the metabolism of the whole , such a relation does not necessarily imply , as has been commonly held , that the quickly growing cells themselves are especially rich in glycogen .
Indeed , this is , as we have seen , not the case .
But if , instead of considering a single cell , we look at the foetal organism as a whole , a distinct interdependence between the growth of the foetus and the glycogen present in the organism becomes apparent .
Attempts were made , by variations in diet and by injection of phloridzin , to alter the glycogen percentage of the placenta , in order to find out if a .
corresponding change could be produced thereby in the foetus .
Effect of Variation in Diet.\#151 ; The results of the feeding experiments on the 274 Drs. Lochhead and Cramer .
Glycogenic Changes [ Jan. 1 , placenta , both maternal and foetal , are given in Table VI .
Rabbit A was fed on a diet rich in carbohydrates for 24 hours before it was killed .
Six others were fed on a similar diet from the beginning of pregnancy , but results were only obtained in three ( Rabbits B , C , and D ) , as the remaining three aborted about mid-term .
In addition , in these experiments the liver glycogen of the mother animals was also determined .
Burlando* has recently stated that in dogs the liver glycogen increases markedly during pregnancy ; but this is not borne out here .
The percentages are no higher than those commonly found after such a diet in non-pregnant animals .
With each the control from the normal series is given .
The results show a remarkable correspondence with those obtained on ordinary feeding .
There is no increase in the placental store of glycogen as the result of a diet rich in carbohydrate .
The amount of glycogen present in the placenta appears to be independent of the conditions of diet and regulated entirely by the needs of the foetus , a fact which is of importance in the development of the embryo .
Nor has feeding with an excess of carbohydrates any effect on the date at which the foetal liver assumes its glycogenic function or on the amount stored in the later stages .
The glycogen percentage of the rest of the foetal bodies and the weight of the foetus were also not affected by the variation of diet .
The results obtained in this series corroborate those of the more complete age-series examined under normal conditions .
The constancy in the amount of glycogen deposited in the placenta and in the foetal tissues at the various periods of foetal life contrasts markedly with the fluctuations in the glycogen store of the adult liver , both in the normal and , as our figures show , in the pregnant animal , and demonstrates again the autonomy of the glycogen metabolism of the foetus .
E. Effect of Injections of Phloridzin .
In order to induce experimentally a diminution of the glycogen store , and in this way to study further the relation which we have found to exist between glycogen and the growth of the foetus , two pregnant animals were treated with phloridzin for a prolonged period .
The treatment had a very marked effect , because the substance probably passed through the placenta and exerted its action directly on the foetus , and not only mediately through the maternal organism .
0 6 gramme of phloridzin was injected daily into the mother animals from the 8th day of gestation , the time when , according to Chipman , glycogen * Burlando , ' Archiv .

277 first appears in the maternal placenta .
In the first experiment the rabbit ( Rabbit E ) was killed when 21 days pregnant , and in the second ( Rabbit E ) when 27 days pregnant .
The maternal liver , the placenta , and the foetal liver and foetal bodies were analysed .
The results , which are given in Table YII along with the control from the normal series , show very clearly that the placenta does not give up its store of glycogen readily to the maternal organism when the hepatic reserve runs low .
The placenta guards its glycogen deposit so much more jealously than the liver that it appears as if the cells of the placenta had a greater affinity for glycogen than those of the liver .
The weight of the placenta is not very much affected in the case of the animal killed on the 21st day of gestation .
The differences which are found between the maternal and foetal parts respectively of the phloridzin animal and the control animal compensate each other , and may perhaps be due to the crudity of the mechanical separation .
If the weight of the foetal and maternal parts are added together , there is practically no difference , the figures being 3*2 for Rabbit E and 3*24 for the control animal .
The placentae of the animal killed on the 27th day of gestation , which show a distinct diminution in their glycogen store , have been affected also in their growth .
Although the weight of the maternal part is slightly higher , the weight of the foetal part is so low that , even if the total weight of the placenta is taken , a marked diminution is evident .
The placenta of Rabbit F weighs 3'2 grammes , that of the control animal 4T3 grammes .
The glycogen of the foetal livers was estimated only in the second animal , as the first animal was killed at a stage when only traces of glycogen were likely to be present in the foetal liver .
In the animal killed at the 27th day of gestation the weight and glycogen percentage were distinctly lower than in the control animal from the normal series .
But the foetal liver still contained a much higher percentage of glycogen than the maternal liver ( 0T1 per cent. ) .
The glycogen of the rest of the foetal bodies was found to be reduced .
At the same time the foetal weight was decreased in both cases .
The animal killed on the 21st day of pregnancy shows a diminution of the glycogen store of the foetus , while the placenta has yet retained its full share .
A much more profound effect , however , has been produced in the animal killed on the 27th day .
Here both the deposit in the placenta and that in the foetus have been markedly diminished .
Associated with these changes there is in both animals a retardation of growth , which again is more pronounced in the animal where the loss of glycogen has been greatest .
It should be noted , too , that the retardation of growth is confined to the foetal 278 Drs. Lochhead and Cramer .

279 tissues .
In the case of Rabbit F , the maternal part of the placenta is not diminished in weight , although its glycogen store has been greatly reduced , while the foetal part of the placenta , which normally is free from glycogen , is greatly reduced in weight .
The results obtained by treatment with phloridzin confirm the conclusions which we have drawn from our observations on spontaneous cases of retarded growth .
They show that the growth of the foetus is dependent upon glycogen in such a way that the glycogen is not actually present in the growing cell , but that the foetus draws upon a deposit which is laid down at first in the maternal part of the placenta and is transferred in the last week of pregnancy to the liver of the foetus .
F. The Glycogen-splitting Ferment of the Placenta .
Glycerine extracts , both of the maternal and of the foetal part of the rabbit 's placenta , were found to have a powerful hydrolytic action on glycogen .
This action was destroyed by heating the extracts .
Extracts of sheep 's placentae showed , even on qualitative examination , a very much less marked glycogen-splitting power .
The activity of the ferment was measured quantitatively by determining the amount of sugar split off after incubating a mixture of measured quantities of the glycerine extract and of a solution of glycogen , purified by repeated precipitation with alcohol .
Toluol was added .
After 24 hours the glycogen was precipitated by alcohol and the amount of sugar estimated in the filtrate by Allihn 's method .
In order to account for the sugar of the blood present in the glycerine extracts , control experiments were made with the heated extract .
In these controls only very small and almost constant quantities of cuprous oxides were found , the figures ranging from 0*001\#151 ; 0*004 gramme .
These figures were subtracted from the results obtained in the digests , and in this way a measure of the activity of the ferment was obtained .
The results obtained for the placenta of the rabbit are given in the following table:\#151 ; Glycogen-splitting Ferment in Placenta of Rabbit .

It is a very interesting fact that this difference is reflected also in the glycogen content of the placentae of these animals .
The maternal and foetal cotyledons of the placenta of the sheep were examined for glycogen in several cases .
The material was obtained from the slaughter-house and extracted within half an hour after death .
By extraction with hot acidulated water we failed to find any glycogen .
Experiments with Pfluger 's method of extraction with strong alkali , however , showed that the foetal cotyledons of the sheep 's placenta contain glycogen in traces to the amount of about 0*01 per cent. The glycogenic changes in the sheep 's placenta must therefore be very insignificant , and correspondingly we find a weak glycogen-splitting ferment in this case .
In the rabbit , on the other hand , where large quantities of glycogen are dealt with by *the placenta in a short time , we find a powerful ferment present in the placenta .
The glycogen of the maternal placenta of the rabbit , which , as we have seen , is made use of by the embryo , must necessarily pass through the foetal part of the placenta .
This part contains such small traces of glycogen , if any at all , that they cannot be detected by microchemical methods .
We must assume , then , that the plasmodium absorbs glycogen not as such , but in an altered form .
At the same time we find that the foetal part of the placenta secretes a strong glycogen-splitting ferment , more powerful even than that of the maternal part .
In view of these facts , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in the placenta the ferment is active during life .
If we assume that it is found only after death , we would meet with the further difficulty , that a tissue\#151 ; the foetal part of the rabbit 's placenta\#151 ; which contains no glycogen during life should suddenly develop a glycogen-splitting enzyme after death .
1908.1 in the Placenta and Foetus of the Pregnant Rabbit .
281 The objection that the glycogen-splitting power of the placenta is due to the presence of blood , which is known to have a diastatic action , is negatived by our results .
The extracts of the placenta contained as much blood in Ruminants as in rabbits , yet the diastatic power of the placenta of the former was almost negligible compared with that of the latter .
We wish to point out specially that the glycogen-splitting enzyme is an enzyme secreted by the cells .
It is the only enzyme which we have been able to demonstrate in glycerine extracts of the placenta , although a large number of experiments were made to test for the presence of tryptic , peptic , ereptic , and lipolytic enzymes in these extracts .
All these experiments gave negative results .
That such ferments are present within the cells of the placenta as intracellular enzymes , and that their presence can be demonstrated by using more severe methods than extraction with glycerine , we do not doubt .
But such ferments , with the sphere of their activity limited to the cell itself , are present in the cells of many if not of all organs , so that their presence in the placenta would not throw much light on the function of this organ .
On the Fate and Function in the Foetal Organism of Glycogen absorbed from the Placenta .
Whatever the source of the placental glycogen may be , its presence cannot be due to the accident of the anatomical site of the rabbit 's placenta , which , -although identical in position with that of the cow and sheep , is distinguished by its power of forming and storing glycogen .
We cannot but recognise ' a definite function of the cells of the rabbit 's placenta of depositing a store of carbohydrate for the foetus .
There can be little doubt that the placental glycogen is absorbed by the plasmodium .
It is situated , as we have seen , in decidual cells which are intimately related to the ectodermic tubules , and are , indeed , in Chipmari 's words , " swallowed " by them , so that the glycogen contained in them must also be absorbed into the foetal structures .
The quantitative relationship which we have proved to exist between the decrease in the placental glycogen and the increase in the foetal glycogen affords strong - direct evidence in support of the view that the placental glycogen forms a store for the foetus .
A specific function appears to arise in the foetal liver in the last week of gestation .
If the hepatic store of glycogen were due to the favourable* anatomical position of the foetal liver , we should expect to find the glycogen contents of the liver to be above that of the rest of the body ' during the whole period of gestation .
We have seen , however , that up to the 24th day 282 Drs. Lochhead and Cramer .
Glycogenic Changes [ Jan. 1 , the function of storing glycogen for the foetus has not yet been acquired by the liver and is , in the meantime , fulfilled by the placenta.* The glycogen metabolism of the placenta and the foetus differs in some essential points from that of the adult organism .
In the latter case the glycogen deposited in the tissues represents a store dependent upon external conditions and showing irregular fluctuations .
The placenta and the foetus , on the contrary , are characterised by the absence of individual variations in the amount of glycogen they contain at a given period of gestation .
The glycogen metabolism of these organs shows a regular succession of changes which proceed almost regardless of external conditions , and which are independent to a great extent even of the glycogen metabolism of the mother .
, These facts point to the conclusion that in the development of the foetus glycogen fulfils a definite function and is not merely an accessory source of nutritive energy as it is in the adult organism .
Part of the glycogen which is absorbed from the placenta may be accounted for by the intense carbohydrate metabolism , which , according to Bohr'sf experiments on the gaseous metabolism , proceeds in the foetal rabbit .
Bohr 's results are not in agreement with those of Cohnheim and Zuntz .
J But since the latter \#166 ; observers worked with sheep , which , in view of our observations , may have a different metabolism of pregnancy , and since Bohr 's figures show that his method entailed very little interference with the foetus , his observations may be taken as representing the normal condition in rabbits .
The glycogen which is thus catabolised furnishes thereby the energy necessary for the formation of new tissues , the " Entwicklungsarbeit " of Tangl .
S The question arises whether glycogen performs also anabolic functions in \#166 ; the development of the foetus .
The absence of glycogen from some of the growing foetal tissues , and the fact that the tissues where it is present do not contain even as much as the adult ones , leave little doubt that a definite formative power cannot be attributed to glycogen as such .
On the other hand , the scarcity of glycogen * In order to account for the behaviour of the hepatic glycogen during development on purely anatomical grounds it would be necessary to assume that at the beginning of the last week of pregnancy the vascular supply of the liver undergoes a complete change , so that after that date the foetal liver is freely supplied with blood from the placenta , while before that date very little blood from the placenta reaches the liver .
We are not aware , however , that such a relation between vascular changes and the storing of glycogen can be established .

283 in embryonic tissues does not necessarily justify the conclusion that glycogen does not take part in the building up of the tissues .
It is well known that embryonic tissues are rich in mucin , which contains a large amount of a carbohydrate group in its molecule .
Although glycogen as such has no formative power , it may yield one of the " Bausteine " for the building up of the main protein body of foetal tissues .
In this connection it is interesting to consider the conditions in the hen 's egg , which must necessarily contain in itself the material of which the embryo is built up .
In the egg , carbohydrate as such , in the form of either glycogen or glucose , is almost absent .
At the same time all the protein substances of the white of egg are distinguished by containing a large amount of glucosamine in their molecule .
In the egg , therefore , the carbohydrate group has already entered into the protein molecule , and correspondingly there is a scarcity of free carbohydrate .
Summary .
In an age-series of pregnant rabbits from the 14th day of gestation to the end of pregnancy , quantitative estimations were made of the glycogen present in the placenta , in the liver of the foetus , and in the rest of the foetal body .
The mechanical separation of the placenta into the maternal and the foetal part made it possible to determine the amount of glycogen in the peninsulse of the maternal placenta , which are most intimately associated with the foetal placenta , apart from the glycogen in the rest of the maternal placenta .
A marked feature of the results is the absence of individual variations in the glycogen contents of the various organs .
Instead , there is an orderly sequence of changes , which allows of a graphical expression .
Glycerine extracts of both the maternal and the foetal parts of the rabbit 's placenta contain an active glycogen-splitting enzyme .
No evidence was obtained for the presence in these extracts of a proteolytic or lipolytic enzyme .
Comparative observations on the placenta of the sheep show that the paucity of glycogen in the placenta of this animal is associated with the presence of a very weak glycogen-splitting enzyme in the glycerine extracts from this organ .
The glycogen store of the rabbit 's placenta is not increased by feeding the mother animals on a diet rich in carbohydrates .
Nor has such a diet any effect in increasing the hepatic glycogen reserve of the foetus either in the earlier or in the later stages of pregnancy .
On the other hand , the placenta does not give up readily its store of glycogen to the mother organism when the hepatic reserve of the mother is exhausted by conditions such as injections of phloridzin .
Neither during gestation nor at birth does the 284 Glycogenic Changes in the , etc. , of the Rabbit .
percentage of glycogen in the foetal organs reach the average amount found in adult tissues .
There is a distinct parallelism between the growth of the foetus and the percentage amount of glycogen which it contains .
In two cases where growth had been spontaneously arrested , the percentage amount of glycogen in the foetal organs was diminished out of proportion to the diminution in weight .
A similar condition could be reproduced experimentally by repeated injections of phloridzin .
The interpretation of these results has led to conclusions which may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; The placenta of the rabbit has the function of depositing glycogen as a store of carbohydrates for the needs of the foetus .
The glycogen is absorbed from the maternal placenta in the form of a simpler carbohydrate .
This transformation takes place in the placenta and is brought about by the action of an enzyme secreted by the placenta .
In the earlier stages of intra-uterine life the foetal liver is devoid of the power of storing glycogen , which it does not acquire until the last week of gestation .
Before that date the placenta vicariously fulfils the hepatic 1 function as far as glycogen is concerned .
The glycogen metabolism of the placenta and the foetus is independent of that of the mother , and appears to be governed by conditions different in many respects from those which regulate the glycogen metabolism in the adult animal .
There is a distinct relation between the glycogen metabolism and the growth of the foetus .
Since the growing tissues of the foetus are not distinguished by an abundance of glycogen , a definite formative power cannot be attributed to glycogen qud glycogen .
The function of glycogen in the \#166 ; development of the foetal rabbit is probably to furnish material , on the one hand , for the intense carbohydrate metabolism that proceeds in the foetus ; and , on the other hand , for the building up of the protoplasm of foetal tissues .
The expenses pf this investigation were defrayed by grants from the Moray Bund of the University of Edinburgh .
