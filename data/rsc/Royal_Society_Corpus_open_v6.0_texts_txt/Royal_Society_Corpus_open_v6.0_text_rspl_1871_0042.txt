[ Feb. 22 , tact with a given surface is considered more in detail ; and it is shown how in general such a quadric degenerates into the tangent plane taken twice .
To this there is apparently an exceptional case , the condition for which is given and reduced to a comparatively simple form ; but I must admit to having so left it , in the hope of giving a fuller discussion of it on a future occasion .
' 1 The subject of three-pointic superficial contact was considered by Dupin , * Developpements de Geometric,5 p. 12 5 and , as I have learnt since the memoir was written , a general theorem connecting superficial contact and contact along various branches of the curve of intersection of two surfaces ( substantially the same as that given in the text ) was enunciated by M. Moutard* .
In a corollary to this theorem , M. Moutard states that through every point of a surface there can be drawn twenty-seven conics , having six-pointic contact with the surface .
This number is perhaps open to question ; and I have even reason to think , from considerations stated to me by Mr. Clifford , that the number ten given in my memoir above quoted may be capable of reduction by unity to nine .
But this question refers to the subject of that earlier memoir rather than to this .

" On a New Hygrometer .
" By Wildman Whitehouse , Esq. Communicated by Sir W. Thomson , F.R.S. Received January 6 , 1872 .
The use of Mason 's wet-bulb thermometer as a means of hygrometric measurement , though it be admitted to be the most practically useful , and indeed the only recording instrument for the purpose , has yet this serious inconvenience , not to say defect , viz. that its indications either cease or are valueless at temperatures below 32 ' F. In a conversation which the writer had with the Director of the Meteorological Office some months ago , the question arose whether any thing could be suggested to remedy this inconvenience .
It was obviously inadmissible to substitute any other fluid for , or to make any addition to , the water employed for the wet bulb , as then it would cease to he a test for the purely hygrometric capacity of the air .
It became therefore necessary to fall back in another direction , and to find some hygrometric body which should readily and rapidly absorb moisture from the air , and at the same time afford some means of measuring and re* cording the amount of such absorption .
Fused chloride of zinc or of calcium seemed promising as very active agents , absorbing rapidly on their surface , and allowing the readiest possible escape of the fluid hydrate for measurement ; yet no means presented itself either of accurately measuring , regulating , or maintaining the exact extent of surface exposed for absorption ; nor could the substance itself be * Poncelet , ' Applications d'Analyse k la G6om6trie , ' 1864 , tom .

easily renewed when required , nor , indeed , could either of these substances be regarded as wholly free from the interference of frost , as the moisture absorbed from the atmosphere at a temperature much below freezing-point may remain frozen on the surface , and become incapable of continuous measurement .
It seemed essential to the accuracy and practical utility of any instrument designed for this purpose :\#151 ; 1st .
That a fixed and invariable extent of surface should at all times be exposed for absorption of moisture ; 2nd .
That the apparatus should be simple , inexpensive , and not inconvenient in use ; 3rd .
That the hygrometric substance should be continuously and steadily renewable ; and above all , if it were possible , 4th .
That the measurement should be effected thermometrically .
No solid hygrometric substance seemed capable of meeting these requirements ; but all the conditions seemed likely to be fulfilled by the use of concentrated sulphuric acid .
This would admit of being spread in an exquisitely fine film over the surface of the bulb of a thermometer by means of a glass capillary siphon , of which one end should rest on the upper part of the bulb , while the other end dipped into a reservoir of the acid .
A continuous supply could be maintained for any required length of time by suitable arrangements .
The absorption of moisture would necessarily be attended by a rise in temperature , and this would be proportioned to the amount of hygrometric moisture absorbed ; while the hydrated acid , having fulfilled its office , would fall in drops from the bulb into any tube or reservoir placed for the purpose .
An instrument has been constructed by the writer to test this principle , which has , by the courtesy of the Director of the Meteorological Office , been under observation for some weeks .
It consists essentially of three thermometers of similar construction , and used as a " wet bulb , " a " dry bulb , " and an ** acid bulb , " respectively , placed side by side on a suitable frame , and read together for comparison .
The experience already gained in the use of this instrument has shown that , with a reservoir of proper construction , the supply of acid may be made I continuous for any required length of time , and that , from the very slight variations of flow which occur in its action , the supply to the thermometer will be sensibly equable .
The length of the siphon , and the size of the capillary bore , together with the difference of level between the surface of the fluid in the trough of the reservoir and the point of delivery on the bulb , will determine the rate of supply of the acid .
I It is clear that either a too rapid and continuous stream of acid at the emperature of the air , or a too scanty supply , would diminish the readings ; 1 .
*s found that practically there may be a pretty wide range of variaI ion in the supply of acid , within which no essential change in the sensibi-| 11 y of the instrument is noticed .
18.2 Mr. W. Whitehouse on a New Hygrometer .
[ Feb. For a bulb having one square inch of surface one drop per minute j , sufficient , though the time may range from 40 to 100 seconds without in .
convenience , the time being noted as the hydrated acid , after having fulfilled its office , falls drop by drop from the bulb . .
The quantity of acid required at this rate is about 3 fluid ozs .
per diem , or one imperial pint per week , which is procurable of uniform density , sufficiently pure and free from lead , at a cost of about 2%d .
The temperature of the acid in the reservoir is of course that of the surrounding air ; the elevation of temperature shown by the acid-bulb thermometer is due to , and seems to be strictly a measure of , the amount of moisture absorbed by the film of acid spread on the surface of the bulb , say one square inch , continuously supplied iu its concentrated state , and as constantly passing off hydrated .
, s While , therefore , this instrument is , like Mason s , intended to measure the amount of hygrometric moisture in the air , and to do so thermome-trically , it yet is , in its principle and in its operation , essentially of an opposite character .
.8 The ordinary wet-bulb thermometer is at the zero of its scale in an atmosphere of perfect saturation , and its action depends upon the amount of sensible heat absorbed and rendered latent by evaporation of the water from its surface .
\#166 ; M The acid-bulb thermometer is at its zero in a perfectly dry atmosphere , and its action depends upon the amount of latent heat rendered sensible by the condensation of vapour into water on the surface of the bulb , and by the combination of this water with the concentrated acid .
It would appear that an hygrometer on this principle is entirely free from the action of frost ; while its sensibility is so great as to be at first almost embarrassing .
This may , however , be easily regulated and toned down , if necessary , ?
any required range by the dilution of the acid with glycerine , a fluid which is also of itself hygrometric , though its thermal effects are far less marked than those of sulphuric acid .
\#166 ; The following series of observations , made hourly and otherwise , at intervals during the past few weeks , at the Meteorological Office , by the kindness of the Director , will suffice to show approximately the relations of the " acid " and the " wet bulb " respectively . .
They have been chiefly actual out-door observations , and have extend# over a considerable range of temperature and atmospheric variations .
^ It will require a most careful series of observations to elicit all the points noteworthy in the new instrument , and to determine the relative values0 the wet and acid-bulb readings , noting the behaviour of each at every pa of the scale , from absolute dryness to saturation , and at temperatuai ranging from 75 ' or 80 ' down to 0 ' .
jH This will be necessary before the instrument can aspire to take its plac " among the recognized standards of meteorological science ; but in w \#166 ; # I I i872 .
