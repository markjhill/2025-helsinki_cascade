" On the Viscous Theory of Glacier Motion .
" By James D. Forbes , Esq. , F.R.S. &amp;c. Part II .
" An attempt to establish by observation the Plasticity of Glacier Ice .
" The first two sections of the present memoir are occupied with a critical examination of the theory advanced by De Saussure to account for the progressive motion of glaciers , which he considered as formed of masses of rigid and inflexible ice , and with the further explanations of that theory given by Ramaud , Bischoff , Agassiz , and Studer .
The author , on the other hand , regarding these masses as possessing a considerable degree of plasticity , explains on that supposition the phenomena they present ; and , in the third section of the paper , he relates a series of experiments which he carried on in the Mer de Glace , near Chamouni , in the summer of 1844 , , with a view to determine by direct measurement the relative motion of different parts of the glacier .
This he accomplished by selecting a spot on the western side of the Mer de Glace , between Trelaporte and I'Angle , where the ice was compact and free from fissures , and erecting on the surface a row of posts at short distances from one another , in a line transverse to the general direction of the moving mass .
He was thus enabled to discover by trigonometrical observations the movements of different points in this line ; and he ascertained that they advanced more and more rapidly in proportion as they were distant from the sides of the glacier ; and that when not under the influence of neighbouring crevasses , these motions were gradual and uninterrupted ; as was shown by the lines carried through the posts forming , after the lapse of a few days , a continuous curve , of which the convexity was turned towards the lower end of the glacier .
