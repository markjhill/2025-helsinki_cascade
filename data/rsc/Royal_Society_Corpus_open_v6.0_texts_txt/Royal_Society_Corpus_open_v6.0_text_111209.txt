I 1848 the author first attempted to dissolve calc l iina solution of nitrate of potah , by placing them at the sambe timbetween the ' electrodes of a galvanic battery ; an effect was produced on the uric a'cid at theniegative pole , but ' no very decided : resultwas obtained .
The experiments were resumed during the last summiimer .
The ' results with uric acid ' calculi may be tus are and .

Hence oxalate of lime calculi can be only very slowly dissolved in a solution of nitrate of potash , which acts far more energetically on uric acid calculi .
The action is at least four times greater on uric acid calculi .
Oxalates with urates , and oxalates with phosphates , were found to be far more rapidly acted on than oxalate of lime alone .
Phosphatic calculi were then taken .
A piece of hard phosphate of lime gave Iuration of Strength and temperaPower of Experiments .

However , only from half a grain to two grains of oxalate of lime can be removed by the same means in the same time .
Still , if the stone consists of oxalate with urate , from one to two grains may be dissolved in an hour ; and if it consists of oxalate with phosphate , from four and a half to five and a half grains can be taken away in that time .
These results may be obtained with calculi which have been long removed from the bladder , and have been dried at 212 ? .
MM .
Prevost and Dumas in 1823 proposed to treat calculi by the galvanic pile .
By means of the mechanical action of the mixed gases evolved by decomposing water , they found that phosphatic calculi might be disintegrated .
The chemical action of the substances evolved by galvanic action on the surface of calculi was not determined by them .
