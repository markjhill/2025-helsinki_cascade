64 Analysis of Tidal Records for Brisbane for the Year 1908 .
By F. J. Selby , M.A. ( Communicated by Dr. R. T. Glazebrook , F.R.S. Received October 20 , \#151 ; Read November 23 , 1911 .
) ( From the National Physical Laboratory .
) The National Physical Laboratory has recently carried out an analysis of tidal records for Brisbane ( lat. 27 ' 20 ' S. , long .
153 ' 10 ' E. ) for the year 1908 , and in view of the importance of all such figures to those investigating tidal theory it has been thought desirable to publish the results .
The records analysed are for the complete year 1908 , obtained from a recording tide gauge at the Pile Lighthouse in Moreton Bay on the outer edge of the bar of Brisbane Biver , and were furnished by Mr. E. A. Cullen , Engineer to the Harbours and Bivers Department , Brisbane .
The scale is 1*644 inches to the foot .
Mr. Cullen states that " as the effect of freshwater discharge of the river is absolutely negligible , save during the somewhat rare floods , the data may be considered as observed at an open coast station/ ' He further remarks on the regularity of the tides , and states , with reference to previous predictions , in which eight harmonic components have been employed , that an error of more than 3 inches in height is unusual .
In the records as furnished a smooth curve had been drawn over the pencil trace obtained from the tide gauge , greatly facilitating the work of measuring the heights , and the actual trace was , in general , no longer visible .
It is necessary to remark that in several instances errors had been made in drawing the smooth curve ; as is usual , a number of days were recorded on one sheet , and the draughtsman sometimes passed from the trace for one day to that for the succeeding day , 24 hours later .
It is believed , however , that all such errors have been detected and the correct interpretation adopted .
The method of analysis employed is that due to Sir G. H. Darwin and explained in the paper " On an Apparatus for Facilitating the Beduction of Tidal Observations."* Sir G. H. Darwin 's tidal abacus as there described was used , with the guide sheets and computation forms prepared by him .
These , however , do not include forms for the tides 2 N , MN , MK , 2 MK .
These tides are included on the India Office tide-predicting machine at * ' Poy .

65 the National Physical Laboratory , and hence , though they are of no great importance , it was thought worth while to analyse for them .
Guide sheets and computation forms for these four components were accordingly prepared .
Sir G. H. Darwin 's computation forms include some components which are not represented on the tide-predicter .
In the table of the harmonic constants appended ( Table I ) these components are given in the second column to distinguish them from the 24 components included on the machine and used in the predictions .
The values of H and k for the various components are given in Table I. The notation is that usually employed , as given by Sir G. H. Darwin in the paper referred to above , and in the British Association Report for 1883 of the Committee for the Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observations.* A curve was run off on the tide-predicter for the year 1908 for comparison with the observations analysed .
The agreement of the actual and predicted curves appeared to be approximately of the same order of accuracy as that usually obtained in the Indian predictions , and the result was therefore considered satisfactory .

Height of mean sea level for the year 1908 above datum = 3*383 feet .
The datum employed is the mean height of low water of spring tides .
It is desirable to compare the above results with those for other Australian ports .
Sydney is the nearest port for which data are available , and is situated on the same line of coast .
The data for Sydney and for some other Australian ports are given in Rollin A. Harris ' ' Manual of Tides , ' Part IYa , and in the tide tables for 1912 issued by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey , and for Fremantle in Sir G. Darwin 's collection in the ' Eoy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 39 , 1885 .
The values given for Sydney are somewhat different in the first two publications ; it is , however , not clear that they refer to analyses of different periods , since the record corresponding to the second set of values was available when Part IVAof Rollin Harris ' Manual was published .
They are derived from one year 's observations of high and low waters ( 1888 ) .
The principal quantities necessary for comparison of the results for Brisbane and Sydney are given in Table II .
Both sets of values for Sydney are reproduced:\#151 ; Table II .

The age of the tide for Brisbane = 18*3 ' h-1*016 ' = 18 hours .
This differs considerably from the mean value of 36 hours given by Sir G. H. Darwin* ( the value for Bombay is 33 hours ) , but agrees well with the value for Sydney .
The agreement as regards the age of the parallactic inequality and of the diurnal inequality is also sufficiently close .
The ratio S2/ M2 for Brisbane is below the theoretical value , but K2/ S2 and Pi/ Ki are in accordance with theory .
The diurnal tides are " inverted .
" My thanks are due to Mr. W. H. Brookes , who carried out the greater part of the computations and also checked the final reductions .
The Laboratory is also indebted to the Brisbane authorities for permission to publish the results of the analysis .
