) The following experiments resulted from an observation that after stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle on one side that muscle was heavier by about 20 mgrm .
than the muscle of the opposite side .
Series 1.\#151 ; To ascertain whether the above phenomenon was of constant occurrence eleven experiments were performed in this series , together with four control experiments .
Method.\#151 ; The frogs were pithed , the brain and spinal cord both being destroyed .
Electrodes were attached to the tendo Achillis and under the nerve as it entered the muscle .
Care was taken to avoid haemorrhage as much as possible , but we were not always successful in this .
The preparation was stimulated by single induction shocks at the rate of 40 per minute for 15 minutes .
The muscles from the two legs were then dissected out and weighed , usually within 15 minutes of the end of the period of stimulation .
The right and left legs were used indiscriminately .
The following results were obtained :\#151 ; Weight of muscle .

Inspection of the muscle made it clear that those in which we obtained a considerable gain in weight were as a rule muscles in which the circulation was good , whilst in some of the others the circulation was obviously deficient ; we therefore determined to modify our technique by killing the frogs in a different way .
Series 2.\#151 ; The brain , in front of the medulla , was destroyed by means of a special instrument for this purpose , the medulla and the upper part of the spinal cord were left uninjured , but the lower portion of the cord was pithed in order to prevent the possibility of contractions being induced reflexly in the unstimulated gastrocnemius .
The circulation was clearly much more satisfactory in this series , the respiration in most cases being well maintained and the frogs appearing to recover rapidly from the shock .

Series 3.\#151 ; The comparison of these results with the controls left no doubt in our minds that the stimulated muscles really did gain in weight .
In order to test the matter in another way we determined the specific gravities of the stimulated and unstimulated muscles by weighing them in Einger 's solution .
Our argument was that if the muscles merely differed accidentally in size , their specific gravities would be the same .
Even if the difference in size was due to a greater amount of blood in the stimulated muscle , the specific gravities would be much the same on account of the relatively high specific gravity of blood .
If , on the other hand , the difference in weight was due to the stimulated muscles taking up water from the blood as an osmotic phenomenon , the heavier muscles should have the lower specific gravity .

To these we may add some data from muscles which were tested at longer intervals of time after stimulation .

The two sciatic nerves were dissected out in the thigh and were cut , one was ligatured and stimulated .
This technique appeared very satisfactory , the dissection of the nerves entailing less bleeding than the pithing of the lower part of the cord .

Fletcher* observed a phenomenon which is * ' Journ. Physiol. , ' vol. 30 , p. 414 ( 1904 ) .

Pulmonary probably the same when he discovered that fatigued frog 's muscle swells up when placed in water , to a much greater extent than resting muscle .
He observed also that sufficient exposure to an atmosphere of oxygen restores to the muscle in a marked degree the osmotic character of resting muscle .
It might , therefore , have been supposed that a vigorous circulation of blood through the muscle would have prevented the swelling which we have observed .
The fact , however , appears to be that muscle is capable of outrunning its oxygen supply with great ease , and this is probably especially true of frog 's muscle , in which the opportunities afforded for the acquisition of oxygen are much smaller than in the case of mammalian muscle .
In comparing our result with that of Fletcher , it must be borne in mind that his phenomenon was probably a purely osmotic one ; ours may involve , or may not , also some change in the permeability of the vessel walls .
The Effect of the Depth of Pulmonary Ventilation on the Oxygen in the Venous Blood of Man .

) We have sought to gain evidence as to whether the arterial blood is saturated with oxygen during its passage through the lungs when the breathing is shallow and the subject lying at rest .
Incidentally we have made some observations on :\#151 ; ( 1 ) The effect of work .
( 2 ) The local application of heat or cold on the gases in the venous blood .
As means have not been devised for obtaining safely samples of normal arterial blood from man , we have been obliged to content ourselves with samples of venous blood collected from the veins of the arm .
The samples have been collected for us with strict aseptic precautions by Dr. James McIntosh , and in some cases by Dr. Paul Fildes .
Their daily practice in collecting blood , samples from patients has made our colleagues skilful in the technique of this small operation .
We owe them our best thanks for their help .
Neither ligature nor compression was applied to the arm .
The needle of the syringe was passed straight into the vein ; the arm of the subject rested upon the couch and remained covered with the sleeve until the moment of
