Nearly all measurements of ionisation have been made with vessels enough to reflect a large proportion of the rays which fall on the walls , and the connection between the ionisation in the thick copper vessels used abov .
and velocity is shown in Tables III and IV , which correspond respectively the two sets of results given in Tables I and II .
The values given in Table are shown graphically in fig. 3 .
