The first cardio-arterial interval varies inversely as the square root of the pulse-rate .
2 .
The conjugate cardio-arterial interval varies inversely as the square root of the pulse-rate .
3 .
The second cardio-arterial interval varies very little with different pulse-rates , but is slightly longer in slower pulses .
4 .
The depth of the notch in the first arterial interval of the sphygmo-graph trace occurs at the moment of closure of the aortic valve .
5 .
There is no definite indication in the sphygmograph trace of the moment at which the arterial systole commences .

** On the Thermo-electric Action of Metals and Liquids .
" By George Gore , F.R.S. .
Received January 13 , 1871 .
It is well known that the degree of rapidity with which a metal immersed in an acid , alkaline , or saline liquid is corroded varies considerably with the temperature , and that the speed of corrosion usually increases with the heat ; also a few experiments have been published ( Gmelin 's * Handbook of Chemistry , ' vol. i. p. 3/ 5 ) showing that changes of electrical state occur in metals under such circumstances ; but a further examination of the relations of the temperature and chemical change to the electrical state has not , that I am aware , yet been made .
^ In an investigation on the development of electric currents by unequally heated metals in liquids ( Phil. Mag. 1857 , vol. xiii .
p. 1 ) , I found that hot X871 .
] Action of Metals and Liquids .
platinum was electro-negative to cold platinum in liquids of acid reaction , and positive to it in alkaline ones , provided iu all cases chemical action was completely or sufficiently excluded .
In the present experiments I have endeavoured to ascertain what electrical changes are produced in cases where chemical action more freely occurs , and I have therefore employed not platinum plates , but plates composed of a metal ( copper ) which is more easily corroded .
To effect the object I had in view , I used the apparatus shown in section in fig. 1 , and in perspective , with its wooden support , in fig. 2 .
Fig. 1 .
A and B , fig. 1 , are two open thin glass dishes , 6S inches diameter , and 11 inch deep , with open necks .
The dishes are joined together , watertight , by a bent glass tube , C , about l inch in diameter ; and the whole arrangement is securely fixed upon a wooden frame or stand , so that it may be at once placed in an exactly horizontal position , or inverted to pour out its contents .
D and E are two dishes of sheet copper of moderate thickness , made from contiguous portions of a sheet of metal to ensure electrical homogeneity in the experiments .
Wires of similar metals are attached to the dishes for the purpose of connexion with a galvanometer .
A galvanometer , containing about 180 turns of moderately fine copper wire , is sufficiently sensitive for the experiments .
The outside of the metal dishes must be made perfectly clean and bright immediately before each experiment .
In using the apparatus it is first set exactly horizontal , and a known and measured volume of the clear liquid to be examined , at the temperature of the atmosphere and sufficient to fill it to the line F F , is poured in ; the metal dishes are then steadily placed in the glass vessels and connected with the galvanometer , taking care that no air-bubbles remain beneath them .
326 Mr. G. Gore on the Thermo-electric [ Feb. 23 , As soon as the galvanometer-needles have settled at zero , one of the dishes is quickly filled with boiling water , and the directions and amounts of the temporary and permanent deflections noted .
The following are Tables of results obtained with various liquids , the solutions being diluted in each case to a specified measure by addition of distilled water .
Those of the experiments in which 20 ounces of liquid was used , were nearly all of them made with an apparatus in which the connecting-tube C was of somewhat less diameter ; and the deflections obtained by that apparatus were less in extent than those obtained with the " new apparatus , " because in the latter the conduction-resistance was somewhat less .
The values of the deflections given in the Tables are in all cases those of the temporary ones ; and the liquid used for diluting the solutions was in all cases water .

Eight different solutions , varying in strength from 50 to 3200 grains in 20 ounces by measure of the solution , were tried ; but very feeble currents were obtained , and the plates were not tarnished .
Crystallized Citric Acid .
The hot plate was negative .
With a series of seven solutions , varying in strength from 50 to 3200 grains in 20 ounces of liquid , more feeble results , even , than those with tartaric acid were obtained , and the plates were not tarnished .
Probably , with this substance and^with others where the resulting currents were very feeble , more distinct effects would be obtained by employing a galvanometer of much greater electrical resistance .
Several experiments similar to those already described were made with the apparatus shown in fig. 3 .
The apparatus consists of a glass beaker containing the liquid , and two platinum electrodes\#151 ; A being a disk of platinum rivetted to a platinum wire enclosed by a glass tube , B , and C a platinum crucible ( for receiving the boiling water ) with a platinum wire rivetted to it .
Experiment 1\#151 ; With a solution of 100 grains of citric acid in 2 ounces of distilled water , the hot platinum cup was negative , the value of the temporary deflection being *0007 .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; With 100 grains of tartaric acid in 2 ounces of water , the hot cup was negative , value of deflection *0001 .

Experiment 3.\#151 ; With 100 grains of racemic acid in 2 ounces of water the hot cup was negative , value of deflection *00005 .
The negative condition excited in the hot platinum cup in the solutions of citric and tartaric acid agrees with the results obtained with copper in those liquids .

I have already shown ( Phil. Mag. 1857 , vol.xiii .
p. l ) that the currents obtained with platinum electrodes are not due to the influence of atmospheric air upon the liquid and metal at their line of mutual contact ; for , in the experiments there recorded , atmospheric air was entirely excluded , and the liquids were previously well boiled .
To test the influence of size of the cold electrode , I took a platinum dish , A ( see fig. 4 ) , 5 inches wide and l\#163 ; inch deep , in a glass vessel of the annexed form , B , closed at its lower end by a cork , and containing in its neck two platinum electrodes , one consisting of a wire , C , arid the other of a sheet 2 inches long and 2 inches wide in the form of a cylinder , D , With a cold mixture composed of 3-| ounces of water and \ of an ounce by measure of strong sulphuric acid , and the sheet of platinum as the lower electrode , on pouring boiling water into the dish a deflection of the value of *0064 was obtained , the cold electrode being positive ; but with the wire as the lower electrode no perceptible deflection occurred .
These results were obtained repeatedly .
The electric currents are therefore largely dependent upon the size of the cold electrode .
General Results .
The chief fact brought out conspicuously by these experiments with copper dishes is , that in many cases an increase of chemical action produced by heat , instead of making the hot metal electro-positive , makes it considerably negative .
The results show that hot copper was positive to cold copper in the following liquids:\#151 ; hydrochloric , hydrocyanic , boracic , and tribasic or ortho-phosphoric acids ; chloride of copper ( weak solution ) ; chloride of cobalt ; chloride of manganese ; chromic acid ; chloride of chromium ; sulphate of zinc ( weak solution ) ; sulphate of magnesia ; chloride of calcium ; .
nitrate and chloride of strontium ; chloride of barium ; nitrate of sodium ( strong solution ) ; chloride , iodide , carbonate , and biborate of sodium ; sulphate Mr. G. Gore on the Thermo-electric [ Feb. 23 , of sodium ( strong solution ) ; tribasic phosphate of sodium ; nitrate , chloride , and chlorate of potassium ; bromide of potassium ( strong solution ) ; iodide of potassium ( strong solution ) ; carbonate , acid carbonate , and bichromate of potassium ; aqueous ammonia ; chloride of ammonium ; cyanide and ferrocyanide of potassium ; acetate of zinc ; and acetate of sodium .
And negative in the following ones:\#151 ; nitric , chloric , hydrobromic , hydro-fluosilicic , and sulphuric acids ; ferrous sulphate ; chloride of copper ( strong solution ) ; sulphate of copper ; sulphate of zinc ( strong solution ) ; nitrate and iodide of sodium ( weak solutions ) ; bromide and iodide of potassium ( weak solutions ) ; iodate of potassium ; chrome alum ; nitrate of ammonium ; oxalic , acetic , tartaric , and citric acids .
The number of liquids in which hot copper was positive was thirty-six , and of those in which it was negative was twenty .
In several instances where the hot metal was negative with a weak solution , it became positive with a strong one\#151 ; for instance , with sulphate of zinc , nitrate , iodide , and sulphate of sodium , bromide and iodide of potassium ; but with chloride of copper the reverse occurred .
These results may be connected with the fact that in weak neutral solutions the chemical action is generally the most feeble , and therefore interferes the least with the direct influence of the heat in producing electric currents .
The influence of free hydrochloric , hydrocyanic , boracic , orthophosphoric , and chromic acids was to make the hot copper positive ; whilst that of nitric , chloric , hydrobromic , hydrofluosilicie , sulphuric , and some of the organic acids was to make it negative .
In consequence , probably , of the small amount of interference by chemical action in solutions of oxalic , acetic , tartaric , and citric acids , the direct influence of the heat made the copper negative\#151 ; similar to its influence on platinum in all acid liquids which do not attack that metal .
The nature of the acid in a salt appears to exert much more influence than that of the base on the direction of the current ; for instance , in nearly all chlorides , including those of a considerable variety of bases , hot copper was positive , probably because copper is more readily attacked by acids than by bases .
In all decidedly alkaline liquids the hot copper was positive ; this is similar to the behaviour of platinum in such solutions , and is probably due to the same cause , viz. the direct influence of the heat , as well as to chemical action .
The results also show that the quantity of the current obtained with any given liquid generally increases with the number of molecules of the substance contained in the solution ; in some cases , however , as with sulphuric acid , carbonate of potassium , chloride of ammonium , and acetate of zinc , there was a limit to this increase ; and beyond that limit the quantity of .
the current decreased up to the point of saturation of the liquid .
In the great majority of cases the value of the deflection increased much more rapidly than the strength of the solution , particularly with solutions 1871 .
] Action of Metals and Liquids .
of sulphate of magnesia , and also of hydrochloric acid and of chloride of sodium , probably because two causes operated , viz. increased strength of solution and diminished conduction-resistance ; in a very few cases , however , the opposite result took place , as with solutions of chloride and nitrate of strontium .
Inversions of the direction of the deflection by difference of strength of the liquid occurred with solutions of chloride of copper , sulphate of zinc , nitrate , iodide , and sulphate of sodium , bromide and iodide of potassium .
Irregularities of the amount of deflection were very apt to take place with liquids which gave strong deflections , or which acted much upon the copper plates ( for instance , nitric acid ) , especially if bubbles of air remained under the plates , or the dishes were wetted on their side above the liquid by the solution .
In certain acid liquids , viz. nitric , chloric , hydrobromic , hydrofluosilicic , and sulphuric acids , the hot copper was strongly negative ( notwithstanding the chemical action upon it was distinct , and in some cases even strong ) ; this is similar to the electrical behaviour of platinum in such liquids , and may be attributed either to the more direct influence of the heat alone ( such as occurs with platinum plates ) , or to a different influence of the chemical action produced by the heat .
Both these causes probably operate in such cases .
It is probable that in all cases where the hot copper was positive in liquids of strongly acid reaction , the positive condition was dije to chemical action alone .
With some liquids , especially with solutions of hydrocyanic , boracic , acetic , tartaric , and citric acids , the deflections were very feeble , and the chemical action on the plates not perceptible ; whilst with others , such as nitric and chloric acids , solutions of the chlorides of strontium , sodium , potassium , and ammonium , and of carbonate , acid carbonate , and cyanide of potassium , the deflections were considerable , and the chemical action distinct , and in some cases strong .
In none of the liquids ( except hydrobromic and chromic acids ) did the hot plate appear to be less stained or corroded than the cold one ; probably in all cases it was the most corroded , although in some cases the corrosion was not perceptible .
The amount of deflection was not always proportionate to the amount of chemical action ; for instance , with solutions of chloride of copper and iodate of potassium there was considerable corrosion , but only feeble currents , probably because the plates became covered with a badly conducting film , whilst with hydrochloric acid , chloride of cobalt , chloride of manganese , and nitrate of potassium the reverse occurred .
I consider the currents in all these experiments of difference of temperature to be due either , 1st , to the direct influence of heat , the effect of which is to make the hot copper negative in acid liquids and positive in alkaline ones ( see Phil. Mag. 1857 , vol. xiii .
p. 1 ) ; 2nd , to chemical action , which sometimes overpowers the direct influence of heat and reverses the effect ; Mr. G. Gore on the Thermo-electric [ Feb. 23 , or , 3rd , to both these influences combined .
The more ultimate cause , however , of the phenomena in these cases must be sought for in the molecular movements produced by heat in the metals and liquids .
The currents obtained with copper plates were no doubt influenced in their amounts ( if not also in their direction ) by the oxidizing action of the air upon the liquid and metal at their line of mutual contact ; for we know that metals in contact with liquids oxidize much more quickly if oxygen has access to their wet surfaces .
And the currents were also influenced by the action of unequal temperature upon this air-contact line ; for we know that wet metals oxidize still more rapidly if heat is applied .
Influence of line of contact of liquid and metal with the air .
That the length of line of contact of the liquid and copper with the air is capable of producing electric currents was shown by the following experiments:\#151 ; ' ' Two strips of sheet copper of the annexed form , fig. 5 , f inch wide , and Fig. 5 .
Fig. 6 .
12 inches long in the longest limb , were cut from contiguous parts of a sheet of copper , and , after being perfectly cleaned , were , coiled into the shape represented by the annexed sketch , fig. 6 .
They were then placed in a flat-bottomed porcelain dish and connected with the galvanometer , one of the spirals being supported at about | inch higher than the other by means of a triangle of glass rod .
The liquid to be examined was then poured into the dish until it just ( and completely ) covered the lower spiral , and the direction and amount of the permanent deflection noted .
The positions of the spirals were then reversed and the electrical effects again Experiment 1.\#151 ; With a liquid composed of 100 grains of cyanide of potassium dissolved in 12 ounces of water , whichever of the spirals was only partly submerged and therefore had the longest air-line , was strongly electro-negative to the wholly submerged one .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; With a mixture of one measure of strong nitric acid ana ten measures of water , deflections of somewhat less amount , but in precisely similar directions to those of experiment l , took place .
Experiment 3.\#151 ; With dilute hydrobromic acid the directions of tne deflections were also similar , but still less in amount .
Experiment 4.\#151 ; With a half-saturated solution of borax very feeble de1871.1 Action of Metals and flections , agreeing in direction with those of the other experiments , were obtained .
These results show the necessity ( which I have already mentioned ) of excluding air-bubbles from beneath the copper dishes , and of not wetting the sides of the dishes by the liquid above the level of their immersion .
To ascertain the influence of difference of temperature of the -air-contact line I soldered two strips of perfectly similar sheet copper , each 12 inches long and \ inch wide , in the form of circular hoops 4 inches in diameter upon the bottoms of two tin cups , and ground the edges of the strips perfectly level , and soldered copper wires to them for connecting with the galvanometer .
Two glass triangles were now put into the apparatus , fig. 1 , one in each dish , to support the cups , and a mixture of one measure of nitric acid and 12 measures of distilled water poured in until it just touched the edges all round of the perfectly horizontal copper rims resting on the triangles .
After the needles of the galvanometer had settled at zero , about ten ounces of boiling water was poured into one of the cups ; a temporary deflection of the value *0560 , and a permanent one of value *0759 , were produced , the hot metal being negative .
The direction of the current in this experiment agrees with that obtained with the same mixture and the copper dishes ; and the result indicates that a large proportion of the quantity of the current obtained with copper dishes in dilute nitric acid was due to the action of the air-contact line .
The influence of the air-line is largely chemical .
" A piece of copper wire wholly submerged in the acid [ dilute sulphuric ] so as to entirely exclude any portion of it coming into contact with the air , has remained for many months without imparting the slightest tinge to the liquid .
" " But on suffering the liquid to evaporate so as to bring the upper end of the metal near to its surface , the instant the slightest portion becomes exposed chemical action immediately begins .
" " Two equal portions of wire were similarly placed in acid , only that one was fully exposed to the atmosphere in an open tube , while the other was placed in a phial , the acid occupying half its height , and was kept closely corked for several weeks\#151 ; after which the fully exposed metal had lost in weight two-fifths more than the one which had been excluded from contact with fresh portions of air , showing that contact with the atmosphere in bulk is necessary to the fullest action"* .
Experiments with Liquids of unequal strength .
To throw some light upon the questions , \#151 ; 1st , Is the quantity of the current simply a result of the difference of number of molecules of liquid which touch the hot plate compared with those which touch the cold plate ?
and , 2nd , What amount of difference of strength of a liquid is equal to the amount of difference of temperature employed ?
\#151 ; I brought the two * " On the Theory of the Voltaic Pile , " Bridgman , Phil. Mag. Nov. 1869 .
Mr. G. Gore on the Thermo-electric [ Feb. 23 , copper dishes into contact with liquids of unequal strength instead of unequal temperature .
The tube C ( fig. 1 ) was filled with the stronger mixture and closed at its end in the dish A by an india-rubber bung , and the dish B filled to the line F with the same mixture ; the dish A was then filled with the weaker mixture up to the same level and the bung slowly withdrawn .
The two copper dishes , previously connected with the galvanometer , were next simultaneously immersed in the mixtures and the effect noted .
The following are the results obtained by this method :\#151 ; Nitric Acid .
Experiment l.\#151 ; In A , 1 volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes .
In B , 1 volume diluted to 40 .
Copper in A was positive temporarily , value *0270 ; and permanently , value *0198 .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; In A , 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes .
In B , 1 volume of acid diluted to 20 volumes .
The copper plate in A was first positive temporarily , value of deflection *0064 ; and then that in B permanently , value '2850 .
Experiment 3.\#151 ; In A , 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes .
In B , 1 volume diluted to 10 volumes .
Copper plate in B was positive temporarily , value *4863 ; and permanently , value *0819 .
Hydrochloric Acid .
Experiment 1.\#151 ; In A , 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes .
In B , 1 volume diluted to 20 volumes .
The copper in B was positive temporarily , value '9608 ; and permanently , value *1087 .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; In A , 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes .
In B , 1 volume diluted to 26 66 volumes .
The copper in B was positive temporarily , value '3479 ; and permanently , value *0702 .
Chloric Acid .
In A , 1 volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes .
In B , 1 volume diluted to 40 volumes .
The copper in B was positive temporarily , value *0036 ; and permanently , value *0009 .
Sulphuric Acid .
In A , 1 volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes .
In B , 1 volume diluted to 40 volumes .
The copper in B was positive temporarily , value '0467 ; and permanently , value '0330 .
On examining these results , it will be perceived , 1st , that only in one half the number of the experiments did increased strength of liquid produce electrical currents similar in direction to those produced by increased temperature ; and therefore the heat does not act simply by causing a greater number of molecules of each individual substance to touch the hot plate ; and , 2nd , that only in one of the experiments was the copper in the weaker liquid both temporarily and permanently positive to that in the 34r 1871 .
] Action of Metals and .
stronger ; whilst in five of the experiments the copper in the stronger liquid was temporarily and permanently positive to that in the weaker .
Increase of strength of the liquid therefore made the copper positive in five cases out of six .
In the fourth experiment with hydrochloric acid with difference of temperature , and in the second one with difference of strength , the mixture in each case consisting of 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes with water , an increase of temperature from 16 ' to about 98 ' C. produced a deflection of the value *2854 , whilst an increase of strength to 1 volume in 26*66 gave a deflection in the same direction of the value *3479 .
An increase of temperature of about 82 ' C. was not quite equal in electrical effect to an increase of 50 per cent , in the number of molecules of the acid which touched the plates .
In the third experiment with chloric acid with difference of temperature , and in the single one made with difference of strength , the mixture in each instance consisting of 1 volume of the acid diluted to 80 volumes with water , an increase of temperature of about 82 ' C. produced an electrical effect of *0040 ; whilst an increase of 100 per cent , in the number of molecules of the acid which touched the plates produced an opposite electrical effect of *0036 .
In the third experiment with sulphuric acid with difference of temperature , and in the single one made with difference of strength , each being with a mixture of 1 measure of acid in 80 of water , an increase of temperature of about 82 ' C. caused an electrical effect of *0418 , and an increase of 100 per cent , in the number of molecules of acid which touched the plates caused an opposite electrical effect of *0467 .
A liquid thermo-electric battery .
Acting upon the general results thus obtained in this subject , I constructed a liquid thermo-electric battery consisting of twelve glass tubes , Fig. 7 .
t of an inch in diameter and 10 inches long , closed at one end ( and containing a platinum wire hermetically sealed in that end ) , and bent to the Fig. 8 .
Mr. G. Gore on the Thermo-electric [ Feb. 23 , form shown in fig. 7 , each tube being filled with a conducting liquid , and its outer end closed by a cork , in which was fixed a second platinum wire to dip into the liquid .
Fig. 8 represents the apparatus ; A A is a wooden stand supporting a tin box , B. The box is water-tight , and has in its lower surface a long semicircular cavity ( shown by dotted lines ) to receive the upper ends of the twelve tubes .
To the back of the box is fixed a short cylinder of tin , C , closed at its outer end .
When the apparatus is in action , the box is filled with hot water , and the water kept boiling by means of a lamp placed beneath the tube C. The twelve tubes were kept in position by divisions of wood fixed to the back of the stand , as shown in the figure .
The tubes 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 were filled with a previously boiled and cooled mixture of 5 of an ounce of sulphuric acid , and 19 ounces of distilled water ; and the others , viz. 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 , with a similarly prepared solution of 110 grains of hydrate of potassium dissolved in 19 ounces of distilled water .
The platinum wires were connected , in the order shown in the sketch , by means of small binding-screws not represented in the figure .
On connecting the terminals with a galvanometer containing about 180 turns of moderately coarse copper wire , and applying heat to the upper electrodes and ends of tubes by means of the boiling water , no deflection of the needles took place ; but on substituting a Thomson s reflecting galvanometer , which offered a resistance of 30407 B.A. units ( =77872*327 miles of copper wire of an inch thick ) , a deflection of 40 degrees was readily ob- tained , the hot platinum wire in the dilute acid being negative , and that in the alkali positive , as shown by the direction of the arrows in the sketch .
From these results it is evident the quantity of the electric current produced was exceedingly small , and its intensity considerable .
By employing electrodes of larger surface , such as spirals of platinum wire and more concentrated liquids , the quantity of the current would be very largely increased .

Fig. 9 represents a simpler arrangement of this apparatus , in which only 1871 .

one kind of liquid , either acid or alkaline , is employed .
The electrodes in this arrangement must be disposed in the order represented by the figure .
Influence of Friction .
To ascertain if the friction of one of the electrodes against the liquid had similar effects to those produced by the direct application of heat , I employed the apparatus shown in fig. 10 .
The sketch does not require explanation .
Fig. 10 .
Experiment 1.\#151 ; By immersing two stout copper wires vertically in an acidulated solution of cupric sulphate and rotating one of them at a speed of about 5000 revolutions per minute , the rotating wire became electropositive .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; With a saturated solution of borax , the rotating wire was positive .
Experiment 3.\#151 ; With a solution of cyanide of potassium , the rotating wire was negative .
Experiment 4.\#151 ; With stout platinum wires in an acidulated solution of cupric sulphate , the rotating wire became negative .
Experiment 5.\#151 ; With platinum wires in a solution composed of 200 grains of carbonate of potassium in 40 ounces of distilled water , the rotating wire was faintly positive , and similarly in a very dilute solution .
Experiment 6.\#151 ; With two platinum disks one above the other in a strong solution of carbonate of potassium , revolving the upper disk at a speed of about 5000 revolutions per minute made it electro-positive .
Experiment 7.\#151 ; With an acidulated solution of cupric sulphate , the revolving disk became feebly negative .
On comparing these results with those obtained by unequal temperature , we find that the directions of the currents in the two classes of cases were reverse with copper in solutions of acidulated cupric sulphate and cyanide of potassium , and similar in a solution of borax ; and with platinum in solutions of acidulated cupric sulphate or carbonate of potassium the in344 Mr. G. Gore on the Thermo-electric [ Feb. 23 , fluence of friction and of increased temperature upon the direction of the currents were the same .
The molecular movements , therefore , produced by friction are not in all cases similar to those produced by heat .
Influence of Magne-optic rotating-power of the Liquids .
Being desirous of determining whether the thermo-electric properties of liquids were dependent on the molecular structure by virtue of which liquids under the influence of magnetism polarize light circularly , I made the following apparatus and experiment : \#151 ; A and B ( fig. 11 ) are two straight glass tubes , about | inch in diameter and 10 inches long , with two similar ( but bent ) tubes , C and D , attached to their free ends by india-rubber tubing .
The sloping ends of the straight tubes are ground flat , and are joined together securely at their edges by melted shellac , with a thin and projecting sheet of platinum between them to separate the liquids .
E and F are two strong electro-helices wound upon stout tubes of soft iron which enclose the glass tubes .
Ihe apparatus is secured upon a board in an inclined position with the sloping ends of the tubes uppermost ; and the two helices are held together at their upper ends by an india-rubber band , G. I filled one of the tubes with a clear and strong solution of perchloride of iron ( of negative magne-optic rotatory power , see Yerdet , Phil. Mag. , June 1858 ) , and the other with a similar solution of chloride of nickel ( of positive magne-optic rotatory power ) , and connected the liquids in the bent tubes with a galvanometer 16 feet distant by means of the platinum wires H and I. I now excited the helices in various ways by means of 12 strong Grove s cells ; no current was induced in the liquid .
I next heated the junction of the tubes gradually ; the solution of iron became thermo-electro-positive , and a steady but feeble deflection of the needles took place ; and during the continuance of this current I again excited the helices in various ways as before ; again no electrical effects were produced .
The results of this experiment strongly support the conclusion that the thermo-electric properties of liquids are not dependent upon the magne-optic polarizing power of the liquids , nor upon the properties of their mass . .
" On examining the thermo-electric properties of the solution chloride with platinum plates in the apparatus described in the Philosophical Magazine , ' 1857 , vol. xiii .
p. 1 , the hot platinum was strong y negative , value of temporary deflection *8475 .
With the nickel^solution similarly examined , the hot plate was also ^gative vahie of deflecit o .0409 .
These results agree with that obtained with the two tubes in th last experiment , the more positive condition of the iron solution than that of the nickel one determining the direction of the curren m experiment .

] General Conclusion.\#151 ; The electric currents produced by the direct influence of unequal temperature or friction of platinum or copper electrodes , in conducting liquids which do not act chemically upon those metals , have their origin in temporary changes of cohesion of the layers of metal and liquid which are in immediate and mutual contact , and may be considered a very delicate test of the kind and amount of temporary molecular movements produced by those causes .
