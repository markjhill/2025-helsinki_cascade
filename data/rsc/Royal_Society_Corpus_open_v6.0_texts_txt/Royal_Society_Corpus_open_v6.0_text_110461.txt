A paper was read , entitled , " An Account of the Water of the Well Zem-zem , with a qualitative analysis of the same by Professor Faraday " ; in a letter from John Davidson , Esq. , to the Secretaries , and communicated by them .
The author having , during his stay at Jedda , the port of Mecca , succeeded in procuring about three quarts of the water from the well of Zem-zem , to which the Mahomedans ascribe a sacred character and extraordinary virtues 3 and wishing to preserve this water for the purposes of analysis , had the can in which it was contained carefully sealed 3 but , unfortunately , on its arrival in the London Docks , the can , notwithstanding the directions written on it , was opened , and the gas with which it was highly cbarged , and by which it held in solution a very large quantity of iron and other matters , was allowed to escape .
The precipitate thrown down , in consequence of the loss of this gas , was found , by Professor Faraday , to consist of carbonate of protoxide of iron in the enormous proportion of 1008 grains to the imperial pint of water .
The clear fluid was neutral , and contained much muriate , and a little sulphate , but no carbonate 3 together with a little lime , potash , and soda .
There was also found an alkaline nitrate in considerable quantity ; this Mr. Faraday conjectures to have been saltpetre , which had been added to the water by the priests .
The reading of a paper was commenced , entitled , " Observations on the Theory of Respiration .
" By William Stevens , M.D. , D.C.L. , Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Copenhagen , and of Surgeons of London .
