475 the line wave-length 5535 readily reversed , while that with wavelength 5518 is less easily reversed ; the line wave-length 4933 is comparatively easily reversed , whereas that with wave-length 4899 has not been reversed by ns .
On the other hand , the line wave-length 4553 has been reversed , but not the line wave-length 4524 .
In the case of strontium , the lines wave-length 4831 and 4812 have been reversed , but not the line wave-length 4784 , and the two lines wavelength 4741 and 4721 remain both unreversed .
In the group of five lines of calcium , wave-length 4318 to 4282 , it is only the middle line wave-length 4302 which has been reversed .
Of the potassium groups of lines wave-length 5831 and 5782 , 5802 , 5782 are reversed , the line wave-length 5811 has not been reversed , and of the others the line wave-length 5802 is the first to appear reversed .
It is worthy of remark that the first of these lines is faint and the last is the brightest of the group .
The group wave-length 5355 , 5336 , 5319 have been all reversed , but the last of the three ( 5319 ) was the most difficult to reverse : it is also the feeblest of the group .
In the more refrangible group , wave-length 5112 , 5095 , 5081 , the least refrangible is the only one reversed .
Making a general summation of our results respecting the alkaline earth metals , potassium , and sodium , and having regard only to the most characteristic rays , which for barium we reckon as 21 , for strontium 34 , for calcium 37 , for potassium 31 , and for sodium 12 , the reversals in our experiments number respectively 6 , 10 , 11 , 13 , and 4 .
That is in the case of the alkaline earth metals about one-third , and these chiefly in the more refrangible third of the visible spectrum , the characteristic rays remaining unreversed in the more refrangible part of the spectrum being respectively 2 , 5 , and 4 .
In the case of potassium we reversed two in the upper third , all the rest in the least refrangible third .
These experiments relate to mixtures of salts of these metals combined with the action of reducing agents .
In a future communication we will contract these results with those of the isolated metals , calcium , strontium , and barium .

In the preliminary catalogue of the bright lines in the spectrum of the chromosphere published by Young in 1861 , he calls special attention to the lines numbered 1 and 82 in the catalogue , remarking that " they are very persistently present , though faint , and can be distinctly seen in the spectroscope to belong to the chromosphere , as supb , not being due , like most of the other lines , to the exceptional elevation 476 On the unknown Chromospheric Substance of Young .
[ Apr. 3 , of matter to heights where it does not properly belong .
It would seem very probable that both these lines are due to the same substance which causes the D3 line .
" Again , in a letter to " Nature , " June , 1872 , Young says , " I confess I am sorry that the spectrum of iron shows a bright line coincident with 1474 ( K ) ; for , all things considered , I cannot think that iron vapour has anything to do with this line in the spectrum of the corona , and the coincidence has only served to mislead .
But there are in the spectrum many cases of lines belonging to the spectra of different metals coinciding , if not absolutely , yet so closely , that no existing spectroscope can separate them , and I am disposed to believe that the close coincidence is not accidental , but probably points to some physical relationship , some similarity of molecular constitution perhaps , between the metals concerned . . . .
So , in the case of the green coronal matter , is it not likely that though not iron it may turn out to bear some important relation to that metal ?
" In 1876 he proves that the coronal line 1474 is not actually coincident with the line of iron .
In the catalogue of bright lines observed by Young at Sherman in the Rocky Mountains , to which we have directed special attention in one of our previous communications , it appears that the above-mentioned lines 1 and 82 , along with D3 , were as persistently present as hydrogen , the only other line approaching them in frequency of occurrence being the green coronal line 1474 of Kirchhoff , which was present on 90 occasions out of 100 .
It has occurred to us that these four lines may belong to the same substance- An analogy in the ratio of the wave-lengths of certain groups of lines occurring in different metals has been already pointed out by Stoney , Mascart , Salet , Boisbaudran , and Cornu ; and without any special reductions , or claims to an exact ratio in whole numbers , the following analogies are worthy of note :\#151 ; Hydrogen .

477 The ratio of the wave-lengths of F to G of hydrogen ( ( 2 ) to ( 3 ) in the table above ) is nearly identical with the ratio of D3 to the coronal green line ( ( 2 ) to ( 3 ) in table above ) .
This near coincidence in the ratios of certain lines of hydrogen , lithinm , and magnesium , substances belonging to the same type , combined with a similar ratio in the wave-lengths of the nearly equally persistent lines of the chromosphere , greatly strengthens the probability of the assumption that these lines belong to one substance .
The fact that the two less refrangible rays have no representative in the Fraunhofer lines , is by no means opposed to their belonging to one substance , since we know that aluminium behaves in a similar way in the atmosphere of the sun ; and in the total eclipse of 1875 the hydrogen line h was not visible in the chromosphere , that is , we suppose , was on the limit between brightness and reversal ; and during the late eclipse the two most refrangible rays of hydrogen were not detected from the same cause .
Until our knowledge of the order of reversibility of lines belonging to different types of metals has been extended , it would be rash to infer the group of metals to which it belongs , or its probable molecular weight .

( Abstract .
) This paper is a continuation of one " On the Illumination of Lines of Molecular Pressure , and the Trajectory of Molecules , " which was read before the Royal Society on the 5th of December last .
The author has further examined the action of the molecular rays electrically projected from the negative pole in very highly exhausted tubes , and finds that the green phosphorescence of the glass ( by means of which the presence of the molecular rays is manifested ) does not take place close to the negative pole .
Within the* dark space there is absolutely no phosphorescence ; at very high exhaustions the luminous boundary of the dark space disappears , and now the phosphorescence extends all over the sensitive surface .
Assuming that the phosphorescence is due either directly or indirectly to the impact of the molecules on the phosphorescent surface , it is reasonable to suppose that a certain velocity is required to produce the effect .
The author adduces arguments to show that within the dark space , at a moderate exhaustion , the velocity does not accumulate to a sufficient extent to produce phosphorescence , but at higher exhaustions the mean free path is long enough to allow the molecules to get up sufficient speed VOL.
