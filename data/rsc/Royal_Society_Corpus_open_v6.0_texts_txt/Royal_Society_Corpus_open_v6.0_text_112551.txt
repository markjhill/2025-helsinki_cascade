" A Third Memoir on Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls .

Received May 30 , 1868 .
( Abstract .
) The present Memoir is supplementary to my " Second Memoir on Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls , " Phil. Trans. vol. cliv .
( 1864 ) pp. 559-577 , and relates also to the theory of skew surfaces of the fourth order , or quartic scrolls .
It was pointed out to me by Herr Schwarz , in a letter dated Ilalle , June 1 , 1867 , that in the enumeration contained in my Second Memoir I have given only a particular case of the quartic scrolls , which have a directrix skew cubic ; viz. my eighth species , S ( 1 , 32 ) , where there is also a directrix line .
And this led me to observe that I had in like manner mentioned only a particular case of the quartic scrolls with a triple directrix line ; viz. my third species , S ( 13 , 1 , 4 ) , where there is also a simple directrix line .
The omitted species , say , ninth species , S ( 13 ) , with a triple directrix line , and tenth species , S ( 32 ) , with a directrix skew cubic , are considered in the present lemoir ; and in reference to them I develope a theory of the reciprocal relations of these scrolls , which has some very interesting analytical features .
The paragraphs of the present Memoir are numbered consecutively with those of my Second Memoir above referred to .
