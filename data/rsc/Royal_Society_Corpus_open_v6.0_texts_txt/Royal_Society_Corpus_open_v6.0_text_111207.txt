; " An Experimental Inquiry undertaken with the view of ascertaining whether any signs of Current Electricity are manifested in Plants during vegetation .
" By H F. Baxter , Esq. Communicated by Thomas Bell , Esq. , Sec. R.S. &amp;c. .Received August 9 , 1852 .
In the present communication the author has related the experimental results that , he has , arrived at , and which tend to : show that electric currents exist in the leaves and in the roots or spongioles of plants .
Becquerel and Wartmann have already proved that electric currents may be obtained in different parts of vegetables , but ; the object ; of the paper is to point out the connection of : the : currents in the above-named organs with the vital or organic changes which take place in them .
In consequence of the secondary actions which occur at the electrodes some difficulty is experienced in ascertaining the true or normal result in the roots .
Combining however the facts obtained by means of the galvanometer with analogical evidence , the author considers that they tend to establish the conclusion , that , during the changes which , occur in the leaves and in the roots of plants , current electricity is manifested .
