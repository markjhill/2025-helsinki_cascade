A Further Account of Fossil Bones discovered in Caverns enclosed in the Lime-stone Rocks at Plymotuth .
By Joseph Whidbey , Esq. In a Letter addressed to Sir Everard Home , Bart. V.P.R.S. Read February 8 , 1821 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1821 , p. 133 .
] These bones were found not far from those previously described by Mr. Whidbey , and in a similar situation ; the cavern being entirely enclosed in the surrounding rock , and without the smallest appearance of any communlication ever having existed with the surface .
There were no stalactites in this cavern , as there generally is in those which contain no bones , and it was perfectly dry and free from rubbish .
From a note annexed to this letter by Sir Everard Home , the bones alluded to appear to be the grinder of the upper jaw of the singlehorned rhinoceros .
Two grinders , two tusks , and portions of two tibiae of the brown or black bear ; and portions of bones of an animal of the deer kind .
These specimens are deposited in the Museum of the College of Surgeons .
