By Lieut. Colonel Sabine , R.A. , F.R.S. This portion of the series consists of observations made on board Her Majesty 's ships Erebus and Terror , from June 1841 to August 1842 , in the Antarctic Expedition under the command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross , R.N. , F.R.S. It comprises the result of the operations conducted during the second year of the expedition , when it proceeded early in July 1841 , from Hobarton to Sydney , and thence to the Bay of Islands in New Zealand , remaining there till November , and reaching , in February 1842 , in latitude 78 ?
, the icy barrier which had stopped their progress in the preceding year .
Quitting the antarctic circle in March , and keeping nearly in the 60th parallel , they crossed the whole breadth of the Southern Pacific Ocean to the Falkland Islands , where they arrived in April 1842 .
On a general review of the magnetic declination in the southern nemisphere , the phenomena are found to present the same obvious and decided features of a duplicate system as those of the northern .
Particular attention is given to those lines traversed by the ship 's course where the needle attains its maximum declination , whether easterly or westerly , as affording valuable data for the estimation of secular variations .
The results obtained by the present expedition confirm the conclusion deducible from those of previous navigators ; namely , that the spaces in the Southern Pacific , distinguished by certain magnetic characters , undergo a movement of translation , of which the general direction is from east to west ; a direction which is the opposite to that in which a similar change takes place in the corresponding regions of the northern hemisphere ; namely , in the Siberian quarter , where the secular movement is from west to east .
