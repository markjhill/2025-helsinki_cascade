The metals obtained , chromium and manganese , are probably purer than those prepared by any of the methods used hitherto.* This supposition is supported by the sharp nature of their melting points , a feature which has not been observed with samples prepared by other methods .

Discontinuous Fluid Motion Past a Curved Boundary .

) Although many writers have devoted their attention to the problem of the motion of a fluid past a curved boundary , no method so simple , yet so effective , as that developed for the case of a plane barrier by Kirchhoff and others , and since elaborated by Mitchell , f Love , f Bryan and Jones , f etc. , has been discovered for the more general case .
Within the past few years a group of mathematicians in Italy and in France , in particular Levi-Civita , Cisotti , and Villat , * and J. Gr .
Leathern in this country , have published notable advances on this subject .
In aeronautics alone recent developments have shown the practical necessity for an effective discussion of the case where the plane is cambered .
In this paper I propose to show how two-dimensional problems of the motion of a curved surface through a fluid , or the efflux of fluid through an orifice in a vessel of any shape , may be solved , how to find the form of the free stream-line , and how the components of resistance may be calculated * The purest samples examined by Burgess and Waltenberg contained 97-98 per cent , manganese and 98-99 per cent , chromium , and melted at 1255 ' and 1520 ' respectively .

from the solution obtained .
It will be assumed that the fluid is of vanishingly small viscosity , that the motion is two-dimensional and steady , and that the surface in its motion gives rise to a free stream-line , along which the pressure , and therefore the velocity , is constant , extraneous forces such as gravity being neglected .
Problems in which the surfaces are planes have been solved by a series of conformal transformations , and a similar process will be adopted here .
The following functions and notation will be employed:\#151 ; z = x + iy , where x and y are the co-ordinates of any point in the plane of the problem ; w = cf ) -f- iyfr , where ( f\gt ; = const , and yfr = const , correspond to the equipotential and stream lines respectively , \#163 ; 1 = log ( dz/ dw ) = log q~l ( cos 0 + i sin 6 ) = log q~l + i0 , where q is the velocity , and 6 gives the direction of motion at any point .
Along the free stream-lines and surface ( see fig. 1 ) , EACODBE , it is evident the following facts are known :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Along AE and BE , q = constant = V. ( 2 ) AE and BE are ultimately parallel with the direction of the velocity at infinity I , supposed here to be horizontal .
( 3 ) The form of the surface BDCA is given , i.e. , the value of 6 at every point is known .
( 4 ) The stream-line divides at O , and therefore q \#151 ; 0 .

287 All our knowledge of the problem is comprised in these four headings , and .
knowing these , the problem must be determinate .
Consider what the figures in the w- and fi-planes become , corresponding to our problem .
IOAE and IOBE are really the same stream-line , say ^ = +0 and yfr = \#151 ; 0 , and we will for the moment suppose that at O \lt ; f\gt ; = 0 .
The w-plane then assumes the form given in fig. 2 .
Suppose w expressed in terms of another variable t , , such that along EAO and EBO t ranges from 0 to + co and 0 to \#151 ; oo respectively .

this expression we have to transform the region of the problem in the w-plane to the upper half of a new \#163 ; -plane , and this will be facilitated by making use in the first place of an intermediate ^_1-plane .
By means of the Schwarzian transformation , we obtain at once = *2/ D + E , and , since vr1 \#151 ; 0 when t = 0 , w = D/ t2 .
D will be at once determinate if we know another pair of corresponding values of t and w. If on the other hand the problem is that of the flow of liquid through an orifice or between two surfaces , each infinite in one direction only , the figure in the w-plane will consist of two lines parallel to the real axis , and the corresponding transformation is evidently w = D | y = D log t + E. Mr. H. Levy .
Since all the circumstances of the problem will be known , or at least easily derivable , once we have discovered the relation between z and w , and therefore between z and t , it is obvious from ( 1 ) that the question will , in the same sense , be solved if we express 12 in terms of t , for then | dw en = j* ^ en dt .
Success or failure therefore depends on the possibility of determining the transformation to change the region in the 12-plane into the upper half of the \#163 ; -plane .
\#163 ; l-plane\#151 ; 12 = log ( f1 + id. Lines parallel to the real axis correspond to boundaries along which 6 is constant , that is to say , to straight lines in the 2-plane , while lines parallel to the imaginary axis are such that the velocity is constant .
AE and BE ( fig. 1 ) , therefore , representing stream-lines of constant velocity , will correspond to portions of lines parallel to the 6 axis .
Along BO and AO , both 9 and \lt ; / vary , and the corresponding boundary in this plane will be curved , while to 0 , the point at which the velocity is zero , will correspond the point at infinity .

In order that the problem may be one of the type we desire , the impact of a fluid against a finite continuous surface , 12 must be such that ( fig. 3 ) :\#151 ; ( 1 ) A finite portion AB must be straight , otherwise there would be no free surface , and the problem would be that of the impact of fluid against an infinite surface .

289 there is an angle 7 at this point on the surface , then CO and DO must ultimately be a distance 7 apart .
If the surface AB in the 2-plane is concave to the impinging fluid , A and P\gt ; are farther from the real axis in the O-plane than the asymptotes of CO and DO , while if OA is concave and OB convex to the fluid , A is farther off and B nearer to the real axis than CO and DO respectively .
If CO and DO in the O-plane are straight lines , AC and BD being the only curves in the figure , the problem is that of the impact of fluid against a plane surface with the ends rounded off .
The problem to transform such an area as that above described to the upper half of the +plane , as I shall presently show , yields to an artifice about to be developed .
O = F(\#163 ; ) , the formula of transformation to the \#163 ; -plane , may also be regarded as the equation to the curve traced out by the extremity of the vector O when the freedom variable t ranges over all real values between the two infinities .
The point O being thus the extremity of a vector , the point 0 + D ' will be obtained from 12 and 12 ' by adding them according to the vector law for the same value of t. Should 12 and 12 ' both trace out lines parallel to the real or the imaginary axis , 12 + 12 ' will likewise trace out a line parallel to the same axis , for the real parts or the imaginary parts , as the case may be , of 12 , 12 ' , and therefore of 12 + 12 ' , will be constant .
If O = F ( t ) and O ' = G ( t ) then represent two curves in the 12-plane , transforming the areas bounded by these curves to the upper half of the \#163 ; -plane , then 12 !
= F ( 0 + G(0 will represent the curve obtained by adding vectorially the points 12 and 12 ' obtained from the same value of t , and this new function will transform this new curve to the upper half of the \#163 ; -plane .
It should now be obvious that if 12 and 12 ' both have the essentials of the boundary OCABDO as set out on p. 288 , the resulting curve 12i = 12 +12 ' will have these same character- , istics ; and generally if 121 } 02 , ... , On each represents such a formula of transformation , 12 = A1D1 +A2Q2+ ... ... + An12w will also represent such a formula when A3 , Aa , ... , An are all real constants .
It is especially to be remarked that all the functions O involved must include in the curve they each represent in the 12-plane a part of a finite straight portion parallel to the imaginary axis for the same range of values of t. It is not necessary that these functions be limited to a finite number , provided always the constants Ai , A2 , ... , are so selected as to keep part of the curve 0 = 5 AnOn in the finite region of the plane .
Mr. H. Levy .
For the sake of clarity we shall illustrate with the case of two functions Hi and Xl2 representing two regions in the H-plane , rectangles with corners at t = \#177 ; 1 , at A and B , and t \#151 ; at F and G respectively ( fig. 4 ) , where a \gt ; 1 , and suppose F ' and G ' correspond to t = a and t \#151 ; \#151 ; a on the rectangle OABO .
Combining these rectangles vectorially for the range \#151 ; 1 , the resultant curve will have a straight-line boundary parallel to AB .
From t = +1 to t = + a the boundary will be rounded off , and from t \#151 ; a to t = + co , and t = \#151 ; a to t =\#166 ; \#151 ; -go , the boundary simply consists of two straight lines parallel to the real axis .
The lower diagram ( fig. 4 ) gives the resultant curve , a rectangle with the t=*a t \#151 ; \gt ; +oo t = -a t - oo Fig.4 corners rounded off .
By referring to fig. 3 it will be at once seen that this is the type of curve we are seeking .
To this we may now add , by the same method , another rectangle and obtain another curve of the required type , and we may repeat the process as often as we please , always provided in so doing the horizontal parallels and the vertical do not move off to an infinite distance .
It is moreover evident that the values of t at which the curve at the rounded corner begins and ends are the greatest and the least values of t " at corresponding corners of the series of superposed rectangles .
It is quite unnecessary , although it has been done in the illustration for the sake of Discontinuous Fluid Motion Past a Curved Boundary .
291 simplicity , to place the two rectangles symmetrically above the real axis , but any position in the plane would be sufficient so long as their infinite sides are parallel to that axis .
If the values of t are symmetrically distributed round each of the rectangles , the resulting boundary in the fl-plane will be a symmetrical figure , and will therefore represent a symmetrical surface , while if t*he rectangles have a common value of t for one of the angles the surface will be a plane with a curved end .
Should one of the rectangles include for the straight vertical portion , say , an infinite range for t , the resulting curve in the fl-plane will have a horizontal asymptote and therefore represents a surface no portion of which is straight .
Analytically these considerations are expressible in the following manner .
By means of the Schwarzian transformation applied to the case of the rectangle under discussion with corners at t = a and t = \#151 ; a respectively it is at once seen that fli = A | ( ft \#151 ; a ?
} = : ^ cosh-1 ( t/ a)-\- A\ .
The exact specification of the rectangle in the fl-plane would determine A and A ' uniquely , A evidently as a real quantity and A ' complex , but as it is intended to sum up a number of such A 's , and as we are only concerned with the exact specification of the final curve obtained , it would be pointless for us to attempt to insert these values .
It is sufficient to note that A and A ' are real and complex respectively .
Summing n such rectangles vectorially , A = 2 flw = 2 { An cosh-1 ( t/ dri ) + A'n } i .i = 2 Anlog{\#163 ; + v/ ( \#163 ; 2\#151 ; an2 ) } + logp \#151 ; where p and a are real constants and where we will suppose \lt ; * !

To the extent that these equations are practically only soluble approximately , the solution we have found for our problem is not really complete but more adaptable for constructing cases , which may , however , be made to approximate closely to the type of problem requiring solution .
Any number of cases may , of course , be quite simply constructed by giving values to Ax , ... , A " , au ... , a " , and from the above equations obtaining 0h ... , 0n and a.

As we have seen , for a problem of this type w = ci , t = b , and w = \#151 ; ci , t= \#151 ; b , are corresponding values of w and t. Suppose BC turns through an angle r/ 6 , so that at 0,9= \#151 ; $.71- .

There is an obvious extension to the whole of this discussion .
When considering the vectorial addition of the rectangles there was no limitation on the number so added provided the figure ultimately obtained was situated on the finite part of the plane .
In the limit , therefore , if we suppose an infinite number of rectangles superposed , the values of t at whose corners range from t = a\ to t = a2j the A 's may be considered as functions of a , and the final value of II will be given by r\lt ; h ft = A ( a ) cosh l(t/ a)da + B , J \lt ; 12 where A ( a ) is an arbitrary function of a , except in so far as it must be n chosen to satisfy the condition equivalent to %An = 2 a/ 7r , viz. , , ra2 )a , J A ( a ) da = 2a/ 7r , or ft = 2a .

This will evidently represent , for any A , a surface curved from t = a\ to t \#151 ; a2 impinged upon by a fluid in the direction of its axis of symmetry , the angle on the surface at the point at which the fluid divides being 2 a. If one of the limits , a\ say , is infinite there is no straight portion in the surface at all .

and , as before , we may calculate the values of the lengths of the various plane and curved portions in terms of the constants .
By suitable adjustments of these constants we may arrange to have the plane and curved parts of desired lengths and the angle at what we please .
One of the most important cases practically is where / 3 = tt \#151 ; x , so that A + B = 1 , and the problem is that of the impact against a plane surface with one bend .
And , generally , by superposing n such rectangles with a common corner t = a , the other corners corresponding to bh b2 , ... , bn , we obtain fl = SB i .J y/ { { t\#151 ; a)(t\#151 ; bn ) } 2 B " cosh-1 \#151 ; + g ) + const , j Oft CL and , by suitably choosing the constants involved , we may , just as in the symmetrical case , make the surface fit as closely as we please to that of a given one of the type here under discussion .
If a and f3 have the same meaning as in the previous cases If , now , we suppose the number of superposed rectangles to become infinite , and t = \amp ; i , t == b2 , to be the values of t corresponding to the largest and smallest values of t at the corners , rt = fV)co\#187 ; h-\gt ; " * with the condition that P*B(\amp ; )d\amp ; = ( \#171 ; + / S)/ ir .
Jft , If one of the limits become infinite there will correspond a boundary made up of one plane portion meeting a curved portion at an angle \#171 ; + yQ , so that n ( a + / 3)/ 7r .

where B is now quite arbitrary , and to every such function B there will correspond a surface of the type considered .
The method adopted in the discussion of these two special types of boundary will now have made obvious the course to be adopted when the boundary does not necessarily conform to one of these types , but is composed of a plane portion as large or as small as we please , with curved ends of continuously varying curvature .
The method of superposition of rectangles will enable us to build up the expressions required , provided always the sides parallel to the imaginary axis of all the rectangles have a range of t in common .
If t = a\ , t = bi , correspond to the corners of one of the rectangles , and t = + oo to the point at infinity , then ll = AlJ Ai cosha/ { { t \#151 ; ai ) ( t \#151 ; bi ) } Hence , superposing mn of these rectangles , 21\#151 ; ( ax \#151 ; \amp ; i ) a\\#151 ; b\ f const .

It would serve no purpose to go through the calculation in the general case , which is similar to those already discussed , and no new features are developed which have not already been brought out .
The same condition , S An \#151 ; m \#151 ; 1 f3 -j- \amp ; IT 7 applies in this case as in the others , the same meaning being attached to ( ol and / 3 .
In particular if both m and n become infinite , that is to say if we superpose an infinite number of such rectangles , H = J J da db A ( a , b ) cosh-1 ^ a^'b^9 r\#171 ; i rPi where A ( a , b ) da db = ( \lt ; x + / 3)/ tt , J oli * bj and the limits a\ and b\ may become infinite , in which case there will be no plafte portion at all .
And generally if the point at infinity in the fl-plane corresponds to a i Discontinuous Fluid Motion Past a Curved Boundary .
303 finite instead of an infinite value of tie as has so far been supposed , the corresponding value for Hi takes the form Hi = A cosh"1 \#151 ; , t + c giving H == 2 Art v cosh-1 , and a corresponding integral expression .
One further important point remains to be considered .
Will the method here outlined of superposing rectangles enable us to build up any surface , or will only certain classes of such surfaces be formed no matter how many and in what manner such rectangles are combined ?
It has already been shown that the constants involved in the expressions obtained by properly choosing the number of terms are just of sufficient number to enable us to construct as the surface one having given inclinations at a given number of points of given distances apart measured along the surface .
It is obvious that by taking these points of sufficient number and sufficiently close together we can theoretically make the surface we have constructed differ by as little as we please at any point from an arbitrary surface , and it will always be possible , by the method here developed , to find the required expression for fl. But this is equivalent to saying that by the superposition of , if necessary , an infinite number of rectangles our formula gives the solution for any arbitrary surface .
Calculation of the Resistance .
The method above described expresses H and w in terms of t , or for certain ranges of that variable 0 = 0(t ) , q = q(t ) , = If p and q are the pressure and velocity on the upstream side of the surface , and p0 and Y the corresponding expressions for the dead-water region , then P-2\gt ; o = y(V2-q2 ) .
The horizontal component of the thrust is then T* = | ( p\#151 ; po)ds sin 6 = %j ( V2\#151 ; sin 6 .
q~Y d(f\gt ; , and the vertical component Tie = | ( p\#151 ; Po)dscos 0 = ip | ( V2\#151 ; g^cos 6 .
g-1 d\lt ; j\gt ; , and every term under both integral signs is expressible in terms of t. 304 Discontinuous Fluid Motion Past a Curved Boundary .
