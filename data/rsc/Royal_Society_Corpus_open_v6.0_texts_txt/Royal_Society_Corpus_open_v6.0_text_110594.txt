tion .
" By A. Bell , Esq. Communicated by the Rev. W. Whewell , M.A. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. This paper , which is altogether analytical , contains several new theorems in rotatory motion , respecting the effect of the centrifugal force arising from a rotation about any axis , in producing rotation about another , inclined at any angle to the former ; and also a new , and comparatively concise , demonstration of the equations of the motion of rotation of a solid body , its centre of gravity being fixed , and the body being acted on by any forces .
