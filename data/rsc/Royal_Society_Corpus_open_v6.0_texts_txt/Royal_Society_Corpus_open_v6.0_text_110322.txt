" A Physiological Inquiry into the Uses of the Thymus Gland , " by John Tuson , Esq. Communicated by J. C. Carpue , Esq. F.R.S. The author is of opinion that the thymus gland is intended for two purposes : the one to serve as a receptacle of blood for supplying the chasm in the circulation occasioned by the great quantity sent to the lungs as soon as the function of respiration commences : the other to serve as a receptacle of osseous matter preparatory to the extensive ossification which is carried on in the early periods of growth .
