" By E. FRANKLAND , F.R.S. , Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution and in the Royal School of Mines .
Received June 11 , 1868 .
In a former communication to the Royal Society* I described some researches on the effect of a diminution of pressure on some of the phenomena of combustion , and deduced therefrom the law that the diminution in illuminating-power is directly proportional to the diminution in atmospheric pressure .
Further experiments , made more than a year ago , on the nature of the luminous agent in a coal-gas flame % , led me to doubt the correctness of the commonly received theory first propounded by Sir Ilumphry Davy$ , that the light of a gas-flame and of luminous flames in general is due to
