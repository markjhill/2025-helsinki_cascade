A Band Spectrum attributed to Carbon Monosulphide .
127 regarded as the basis of other atomic weights , would point to it as the best single element from which to deduce the value of The value of its doublet separation can be determined with extreme accuracy , to one or two units in the sixth significant figure .
But , unfortunately , the deduction of A from this is subject to an uncertainty which quite upsets that degree of accuracy .
The most probable value is , however , very close to that obtained by the final discussion .
The uncertainty is due to a doubt as to the real relations of lines usually assigned to the S , D , and P series in Ag , and it is hoped to clear this up by a further consideration of the spectrum .
It is then shown how the laws indicated in the foregoing discussion enable the doublet and the satellite differences for Au , and the limits of the series to be determined .
The value of A for Sc is considered in Appendix I. In Appendix II , the wave-lengths of the D and F lines treated of , together with short historical notes , are given .

] The experiments described in the present paper were made in connection with the investigation of sulphur spectra developed by the nitrogen afterglow , in continuation of previous observations by Profs .
Strutt and Fowler.* A result of considerable interest is the detection of a series of ultra-violet bands which appear to be characteristic of a compound of sulphur and carbon .
This band system extends from A. 2436-2837 approximately .
It is , however , quite distinct from that developed , in the same region , by carbon disulphide in the.afterglow , which is described in the paper to which the reference is given .
Further photographs were taken , and it was found that the two sets of bands had nothing whatever in common .
Confirmation of Prof. Strutt 's work on the chemical actions taking place between carbon disulphide and the active nitrogen was obtained .

Mr. L. C. Martin .
A Band brown one of polymerised carbon monosulphide , the latter only in the presence of a stray discharge .
Sulphur in the Carbon Arc. The new bands were first observed in an attempt to obtain the spectrum of sulphur in the carbon arc .
After some failures , successful results wTere obtained by using a hollow carbon , well charged with sulphur , as the upper pole , which was made positive .
In these circumstances a steady flow of melted sulphur into the arc was maintained .
In addition to overpoweringly strong bands of carbon and cyanogen , and faint bands recognised as belonging to sulphur , several of the photographs showed a fairly well developed system of bands in the region 2500-2700 of which no previous record could be found .
Like the sulphur bands , the new bands were degraded towards the less refrangible side .
Attempts to brighten the spectrum by surrounding the arc with sulphur vapour from a test-tube in which sulphur was boiled by a bunsen burner increased the intensity of this set of bands , but brought out a good many reversed sulphur bands in the region 2800 to red .
The band system 2500-2700 betrayed no tendency to reversal .
It therefore seemed probable that these bands were not due to sulphur itself , but to some compound produced in the arc .
Sulphur Vacuum Tube .
As a check on the previous result , experiments were made on the electric discharge through sulphur vapour .
Salet 's apparatus* is very suitable for the visible region of the spectrum , but fails for short wave-lengths , since it is generally constructed of glass , and would be difficult to make of silica glass .
An arrangement was accordingly devised ( fig. 1 ) with a quartz window ( Q ) .
The sulphur could be melted in side tube ( A ) by means of gentle heating with a bunsen burner .
The electrodes ( B ) were of aluminium , led into the discharge tube by quill tubing within the wider side tubes , and cemented in with sealing wax .
With apparatus of the dimensions shown , it was found that the quartz window was hardly at all clouded during the 15 minutes necessary for exposure .
The tube was first exhausted with a pump and the vacuum was subsequently maintained by means of charcoal cooled with liquid air ( see JD , fig. 1 ) .
The discharge , as described by Salet , is of a blue colour , and is luminous enough , even in the fairly wide tube , to require only a short exposure .
In the first experiments , with a less perfect form of apparatus , giving an * G. Salet , 'Analyse Spectrale , ' p. 220 .
Spectrum attributed to Carbon Monosulphide .
129 insufficient supply of sulphur vapour , the characteristic sulphur bands were accompanied by bands of nitrogen and the lines of carbon and mercury at 2478 , 2536 , respectively .
The new system of bands in the region 2500-2700 was also faintly present .
When the more perfect apparatus was employed , however , nitrogen , carbon , and mercury were eliminated and the new bands were also absent ; the SO C.m.Fig .

spectrum then only extended as far as 2829 into the ultra-violet and showed nothing but the broad , double-headed sulphur bands degraded towards the red .
It is clear that these bands 2500-2700 are not given by the discharge through pure sulphur vapour ; also that they are only developed to any strength when the carbon line 2478 is present .
They have nothing whatever to do with the ordinary spectra of carbon or nitrogen .
Discharge in Carbon Disulphide .
The spectrum of the electric discharge through the vapour of carbon disulphide was next photographed .
A similar apparatus to the previous one was used , the carbon disulphide being contained in a bulb , and the flow of the vapour was regulated by a tap .
The vapour was led into the tube at C ( fig. 1 ) .
As in the previous case it was easy to maintain a good vacuum by means of charcoal and liquid air , especially as in this case the action of the discharge tends to decompose the vapour and lower the pressure still further .
The discharge from a 10-inch coil immediately gave a heavy dark brown deposit on the walls of the tube , doubtless being a mixture of sulphur and polymerised carbon monosulphide as described by Dewar and others .
This deposit extended to the liquid-air tube .
It was found that by lengthening the discharge tube slightly , the quartz window could be kept free from deposit .
Mr. L. C. Martin .
A Band The spectrum was found to be very complicated .
In the first place it reproduces that of the sulphur vacuum tube perfectly , band for band , and it seems probable that this is due to free sulphur , one of the immediate products of the discharge .
Corresponding in intensity to the sulphur bands is a remarkable band system extending from X 2436-2837 , the brightest of the bands being identical with those previously shown by sulphur in the carbon arc .
Discharge in Disulphur Dichloride .
It was thought desirable to test whether or not these bands were due to sulphur in a different molecular condition from ordinary sulphur vapour , and for this purpose an unstable and volatile sulphur compound was necessary ; such a compound is disulphur dichloride .
An apparatus similar to that adopted for the carbon disulphide discharge was used , and was kept exhausted by means of cooled charcoal .
The defect in this apparatus was that the bulb containing the disulphur dichloride was connected to the discharge tube by means of a short piece of thick red rubber tubing such as is used for vacuum tube work .
The discharge produced a blue glow as in the two previous cases and a deposit was immediately formed on the walls of the tube , found on after examination to consist of sulphur and a higher chloride .
The spectrum of the discharge contained the usual sulphur bands and faint indications of the new bands .
The carbon line 2478 was present and the impurity was found to be due to the action of the disulphur dichloride on the rubber connection .
To make certain of this another tube was constructed and the bulb sealed on ; it could be filled with the liquid by a fine bent tube on removing the tap stopper .
On taking a photograph with an even longer exposure than before , the carbon line and the new bands were found to be eliminated , the sulphur spectrum only being left in its entirety .
Description and Wave-lengths of the New Bands .
As already explained , when fully developed , the new spectrum consists of a number of bands degraded to the less refrangible side .
With the spectrograph employed , giving a dispersion of about 10 A.U. to the millimetre in this region , a few of the bands were just resolved into their component lines .
Like the sulphur bands they appear fairly evenly spaced and double headed , and like those of the carbon arc they form groups in which successive heads diminish in intensity , although in the opposite direction to the carbon bands , which are degraded towards the violet .
The group with its head at 2579 is worthy of special mention .
Its Spectrum attributed to Carbon Monosulphide .
131 appearance varies greatly under different conditions , and it appears to be the best developed of all the bands only when the whole system is weak .
It is the strongest in the carbon arc spectrum of sulphur , and in cases where sulphur vapour is contaminated with carbon in the vacuum tube .
In the carbon disulphide discharge , however , where the whole of the bands are strongly shown , it is not so bright relatively , and is evidently superposed on another group with a fairly strong band near 2573 .
In this case the head at 2665 is the brightest of the system .
The wave-lengths of the bands were determined as accurately as possible by means of an iron comparison spectrum in the usual way .
Except in the extreme ultra-violet , where the resolving power is high , the heads of the bands were very diffuse and indistinct , and consequently very difficult to measure .
As the second-frequency differences are small it has not been at present found possible to give a Deslandre 's frequency formula for the band system .

General Conclusions .
Sir J. Dewar and Dr. H. 0 .
Jones describe an experiment in which the volatile condensable compound produced by the action of the silent electric discharge on the vapour of carbon disulphide is condensed in a U-tube cooled by liquid air .
When the tube is removed from the Dewar vessel violent polymerisation occurs , and a flash is produced .
The spectrum of this flash is described as containing scattered bands from 2480 to 3620 , the sulphur bands between 3840 and 3920 , and indications of cyanogen and hydrocarbons .
It is probable that , apart from impurities , this spectrum is a reproduction of that produced by the discharge through carbon disulphide vapour , and contains the ordinary sulphur spectrum , together with the bands from 2436 to 2837 described in this paper .
The action of the discharge is to break up the vapour into free sulphur and carbon monosulphide .
Polymerisation of this monosulphide oocurs almost immediately and forms the dark deposit , but during this action the electric discharge , or the influence of great heat , or both as in the electric arc , produces the band system .
The different groups vary in their relative development with the conditions of experiment ; it is possible that they are due to successive compounds produced during the transition from the disulphide into the monosulphide and its polymers .
The author 's best thanks are due to Prof. Fowler , F.R.S. , for constant interest during the progress of the experiments , and valuable help during the preparation of the paper .
