VII .
Observations of the Aurora Borealis made in England by Andr .
Celsius , F. R. S. and Secr. R S. of Upsal in Sweden .
SEP T. 13 , 1735 , in the Town of Woodford , six Miles to the North East of London , at 11 1/ 2 h. at Night , there appeared a bright Band , almost parallel to the Horizon ; and its Middle was judged to be under n of the Great Bear .
At Times another Light shot along the Great Bear ; but almost constantly covered the Stars ~ and ~ .
Octob. 4 , in King-street , Bloomsbury , h~~ At 9 22 0 p. m. A Ray or Streamof Light appeared under the Polar Star perpendicular to the Horizon .
9 24 13 That Ray disappeared .
9 27 6 Two perpendicular Rays shot forth five or six Degrees from the North towards the East .
9 28 30 A whitish Ray again exactly under the Polar Star .
9 30 0 That Ray moved Westward .
9 31 0 It was seen under n of the Great Bear .
9 31 27 It entirely disappeared .
9 36 8A Ray ascending perpendicularly by the Polar Star , and ~ and ~ of the Great Bear .
9 40 0 The Ray seemed to move gradually under ~ of the Great Bear .
h~~ At 9 44 0 No more Rays appeared .
But whether there were any Remains of Light near the Horizon , or in the West , I could not see , upon account of the neighbouring Houses .
Octob. 11 , in London .
h~ At 10 37 p. m. There were two bright Rays under ~ and ~ of the Great Bear .
10 39 A Ray between ~ of the Great Bear and the Polar Star .
10 39 1/ 2 A Ray in Form of a Pyramid above n of the Great Bear .
These Rays had not any Motion parallel to the Horizon ; but they 10 43 entirely disappeared .
Jan. 11 , 173 5/ 6 in London .
At 10 .
0 .
p. m. An indifferently bright Arch , pale towards the Edges , appeared 16 Degrees high : One of the Ends of which descended Eastward under n of the Great Bear : And lucid Streaks appeared now and then over this Arch. 11 13 Under this Arch was another very bright Tract parallel to it , five Degrees above the Horizon ; in which Tract there were Rays , that shot from West towards the East .
11 15 This Arch was very saint .
h~ The first Arch became brighter , At 11 17 and the lower Arch was almost blended with the upper , and broken in the middle .
11 20 The whole Arch was beset with faint Rays .
11 21 One of the Rays under the Polar Star .
11 27 No Arch , nor Rays , but bright Tracts dispersed here and there .
11 36 The Light reached up to the Polar Star , and somewhat higher .
11 44 A lucid Ray under the Polar Star .
12 11 The Sky was overcast with Clouds , except one lucid Streak , which appeared three or four Degrees to the East of the North .
February 16 , in Clare-Hall , Cambridge , At a Quarter past Eight in the Evening , the Moon shining very bright , there appeared two perpendicular Streams betweenthe great and little Bear April 3 , in London , h~ At 8 46 I observed a lucid Arch one Degree broad , which extended along the Northern Crown , the Cingulum Bootis , the Coma Berenices , the lesser Lion and Cancer , as far as the smaller Dog .
h~~ At 8 49 36 .
This Arch quite disappeared : But at the same time , I saw another broader and brighter Arch under Cassiopea , seven or eight Degrees high .
In the Observations of October 4th , and in the last , I am certain as to the Time of the Clock : So that if it has happened that others have observed the same Phenomenon , the Longitudes of Places may be determined by them with greater Exactness than by the Satellites of Jupiter , which I take to be the principalUse that may be made of theseObservations , especially in making Maps of the Northern Countries , where these Lights more frequently occur .
