In the early part of August , 1890 , the photographic work of the normal solar spectrum which I had undertaken had been carried as far as great A , or the limit of visibility in the red , and to X 8350 , or beyond z , in the invisible regions .
During the two previous months of continuously dull weather , while classifying and comparing results , I was interested , on making a close examination of the head portion of the A line , to find the symmetrical construction , the rhythmical grouping , the harmonic order of sequence , and other characteristics of the B line repeated here in every detail .
These two bands , together with alpha , are composed of a number of doublets or pairs , which approach each other on the more refrangible side with uninterrupted regularity , finally crossing , and at the limiting edges of all three bands the three last pairs overlap each other .
The differences of wave-length between the components of pairs increase in the same order .
These and other properties , which will be referred to , are still more obvious in the trains or flutings .
From its holding an intermediate rank in each of its distinguishing characters I was induced to adopt B as a typical group in a geometrical representation , and to investigate the subject by means of rectangular co-ordinates .
Before a complete analysis could be made out , a micrometer had to be completed .
This consisted of a platform , serving as a plate holder , which was made to travel on runners between parallel ways by means of a screw of such a pitch as to move the negative from one division of the scale to the next , for one revolution of the divided plate on the screw head , this latter being divided into 100 parts .
On and over the platform , a microscope is mounted with slide motions at right angles to each other ; an index of glass fibre and reflector complete the apparatus .
* Over 1000 measurements of nearly 200 lines have been made , 100 of which belong to great A. In the analysis the axis of x is assumed to occupy a position coincident with , or parallel to , the scale of 1/ 1010 m. units , and the positions of the various lines are set off on this scale ( see fig. 1 ) for of Oxygen Absorption Lines in the Solar Spectrum .
201 ' Fig. 1 .
sa-Siss 8 8i saa S sis ss the group , which is divided into four series .
Ordinates are then drawn in the position occupied by each line .
The axis of y is divided into a number of equal parts , 1 , 2 , 3 , n. Lines parallel to the axis of x , drawn from each of these divisions , intersect the respective oi'dinates .
The continuous curve passing through the points of intersection is found to possess all the properties of a parabola .
Three points at least are selected to determine the position of the vertex and value of latus rectum .
The distance from the origin along y is also found for an ordinate to the first line of a series .

On Geometrical Construction Now , from the equation to the parabola y2 = pz , the formula \ = V + --------is derived , where V = the wave-length in 1/ 1010 m. units of a point in the spectrum coinciding with the vertex of the curve ; p , the latus rectum ; n , any number of units , reckoning from the origin ; c , a constant .
In practice a representation more suitable for lantern projection being desirable , two units are taken on y for each line of the series ; the equation then becomes \ = Y H--------j-- , where L = 4 and c has twice its former value .
The computed places in the tables are derived from the equation in the latter form ; the maximum want of agreement between these and the observed positions not exceeding ( for and B ) 0 015 tenth-metre .
In the case of A the agreement is not quite so close , the maximum difference being about 0'05 tenth-metre .
It might be supposed that the greater difference arose from uncertainties of observation , caused by the greater haziness and breadth of the lines composing the A group ; but it so happens that each component is in itself so much of a double as to show a bright rift in the centre , which facilitates the centralisation in some degree .
The differences referred to are attributable to the fact that the curve for any series in A , B , or x is not rigorously parabolic , but one which cuts the parabola in three points , similar to the curve of sines , cutting a straight line and terminating in the same phase as at the origin .
This difference is so extremely minute in B ( and in x still less ) that it would require a representation more than 10 feet square , or a good sized lantern screen , to show two separate tracings at a point of maximum divergence , assuming the tracings to have but a breadth of l/ 100th of an inch .
Following the stronger doublets in the fluting or train of A on the less refrangible side , is a secondary train of thinner , sharply defined , doublets , which , with a solar altitude of about 10 ' , may be traced on the photographic prints to about the 12th position .
This series , which was not previously known to exist , conforms to the same formula , and in the table of wave-lengths is denominated the " Secondary Train of A. " This secondary train follows in the wake of the right component of the primary series .
In the head , however , similar secondary groups follow in the wake of both right and left components , overlapping and interlacing each other in such a manner that their resolution into series can only be arrived at by deductive processes ; the difficulty is increased by the fact that a large number of positions are occupied by the dense lines of the main band .
These two series will be referred to as " Sub-groups " in the head of Oxygen Absorption Lines the Solar Spectrum .
203 of A. They are , with two or three exceptions , given in a fragmentary state .
At the same time , there is nothing to prevent their hypothetical positions being carried further , except that the greater density of the principal series precludes the possibility of obtaining any check in regard to their conformity .
Generally , a couple of numbers of the head bands are common to two separate series ; this arises from their complexity being suggested by the nature of the analysis , and , as a matter of fact , some of these have been observed as doubles by Professor Rowland , of Baltimore .
In all cases of this kind a greater density is observable on the prints , and is doubtless the cause of the extra density of 7608*83 , which belongs to two sub-groups ; the line 76L0*10 is known to be a double , but cannot with safety be measured as such .
Owing to their incompleteness , the elements of the curves for the sub-groups in head of A have not been made out , but a glance at their second differences is sufficient to establish their agreement with the preceding form , since an interval is equal to l)d " , where d ' and d " are first and second differences , and n any interval from the commencement of the series .
Note \#151 ; Since writing the above I find that Mr. Johnstone Stony has written a note which was published with a paper by Dr. Huggins on the spectrum of hydrogen , in which he refers to the conditions under which members of a harmonic series might fall near to , but not on , a curve .
