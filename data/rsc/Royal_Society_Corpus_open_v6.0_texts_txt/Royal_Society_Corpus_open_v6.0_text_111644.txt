" Hereditary Transmission of an Epileptiform Affection accidentally produced .

It is well known that the number of facts which seem to prove that an accidentally produced affection may be transmitted by parents to their offspring is still small , and that serious objections have been raised against most , if not all , the facts of this kind .
The following observations seem to show peremptorily that , at least in one species of animals , this kind of transmission may occur .
I have shown that certain injuries to the spinal cord , in Guineapigs and other Mammals , are followed , after a few weeks , by a convulsive disease , very much like epilepsy .
For several years it has been frequently observed that the young of a number of those epileptic animals , which I kept in my laboratory , were at times attacked with epileptiform convuilsions .
For many months I have made regular observations on this curious subject , and I have ascertained , by careful watching , that six young guinea-pigs which had frequent attacks of convulsions , were the offspring of one male and two female guinea-pigs rendered epileptic in consequence of an injury to the spinal cord .
This observation derives its importance chiefly from the fact that , if epilepsy is an affection which naturally exists among guinea-pigs , it must be very rare , as I have never seen it except in the progeny of individuals operated upon and rendered epileptic ; and yet the number of healthy guinea-pigs that I have kept for months is really immense .
It seems therefore that we can conclude , from these observations , that epilepsy , or ai affection which very much resembles it , may be transmitted from parents to offspring , eveni when it has been accidentally produced in one of the parents , -at least in one species of animals .
