I. " On Calorescence .
" By JOHN TYNDALL , F.R.S. Received October 20 , 1865 .
( Abstract .
) The paper is divided into ten short sections .
In the 1st the experiments of Sir William Herschel and of Prof. Miiller on the sun 's radiation are described .
In the 2nd are given a series of measurements which show the distribution of heat in the spectrum of the electric light .
In the 3rd section is described a mode of filtering the composite radiation of an intensely luminous source so as to detach the luminous from the non-luminous portion of the emission .
The ratio of the visible to the invisible radiation determined in this way is compared and found coincident with the results of prismatic analysis .
The eminent fitness of a combination of iodine and bisulphide of carbon as a ray-filter is illustrated , and in the 4th section experiments with other substances are described ; various effects obtained in the earlier experiments on the invisible rays being mentioned .
In the 5th section the absolutely invisible character of the radiation is established ; it is also proved that no extra-violet rays are to be found at the obscure focus .
Numerous experiments on combustion produced by invisible rays are also described in the 5th section .
The 6th section deals with the subject of calorescence , or the conversion of obscure radiant heat into light .
In section 7 various modes of experimenting are described by which the danger incident to the use of so inflammable a body as the bisulphide of carbon may be avoided .
In the 8th section are described experiments on the invisible radiation of the lime-light and of the sun .
In the 9th section the effect obtained by exposing papers of different colours at the dark focus are mentioned ; while the 10th and concluding section , deals with the calorescence obtainable from rays transmitted by glasses of various kinds .
