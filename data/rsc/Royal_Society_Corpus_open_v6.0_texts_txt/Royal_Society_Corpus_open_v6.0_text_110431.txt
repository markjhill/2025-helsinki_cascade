A paper was also read , entitled " Note on the Astronomical Refractions .
" By James Ivory , Esq. , K.H. , M.A. , F.R.S. The object of this communication is to show how far the author has been successful in establishing the true theory of astronomical refractions , in his paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1823 , by comparing the results of that theory with the best and most recent observations ; namely , those recorded in the " Fundamenta Astronomiae " of Bessel , and the " Tabulae Regiomontanre " of the same author .
This comparison is made by taking the first and second differences of the series of the logarithms of the refrac ?
tions in each table ; from which it results that these differences , derived from the numbers in Bessel 's tables , are very irregular ; but that their mean very nearly coincides with that of the numbers given in the tables of the author .
