) Recent work has shown that the phagocytosis of micro-organisms is a complex phenomenon , involving at least two factors , viz. : ( 1 ) the sensitisation of the micro-organism by the opsonin of the blood serum , and ( 2 ) the phagocytic !
act of the polymorphonuclear leucocyte .
The latter function has been known for many years to be markedly influenced by temperature .
It appeared desirable , however , to ascertain whether , by the modern quantitative methods employed in opsonic work , some definite relationship could be found to subsist between degree of temperature and degree of phagocytosis .
In the first set of experiments no attempt was made to separate the respective functions of sensitisation , and amoeboid activity of the leucocyte .
Both actions were allowed to proceed simultaneously .
Consequently , in Series I the leucocytes were put in contact with fresh serum and micro-organisms ( staphylococci ) , and incubated together at different temperatures for the same period of time .
Thereafter the number of cocci taken up per leucocyte was calculated on stained films in the usual way .
The Staphylococcus aureus employed was an old laboratory strain .

There is , in fact , a prolonged latent period .
This was further brought out in the next experiment , where the temperature remained constant ( 18 ' C. ) while the incubation periods varied .

From the results quoted above , it will be apparent that the degree of phagocytosis rises , though in a somewhat irregular fashion , as the temperature rises , but the results are not sufficiently constant to enable one to determine with any accuracy such a value for the temperature-coefficient as would allow one to calculate the amount of phagocytosis at a temperature A when the amount at a temperature B is known .

Q 2 Mr. J. C. G. Ledingham .
[ Nov. 18 , coccal emulsion has probably a great bearing on the rate of fall , especially during the upper temperature ranges ( vide Experiment YI ) .
A fairly constant ratio , however ( 4\#151 ; 5 :1 ) , is found to exist between the degree of phagocytosis at 43 ' C. and that at 18 ' C. We have now to determine whether this increased phagocytosis following rise of temperature is due simply to increased activity on the part of the leucocyte .
In short , what effect has temperature on the rate of combination of the serum with the coccus ?
To settle this point , a second series of experiments was performed .
The cocci were sensitised by contact with serum for a fixed time at a certain temperature .
Thereafter leucocytes were added and incubation performed at different temperatures .
By this method more or less completely sensitised cocci were exposed to the action of the leucocytes .
Series II .
Experiment I.\#151 ; A moderately thick emulsion of cocci in normal saline was added in equal volume to fresh serum , and kept in contact therewith at a temperature of 37 ' C. for 20 minutes in a small test-tube .
One volume of leucocytes was then incorporated with one volume of the shaken up and partially centrifugalised serum-coccal mixture and incubated at different temperatures for 20 minutes .
The result was as follows:\#151 ; Temperature , 37 ' C. Cocci per leucocyte .

The employment of very thin coccal emulsions , however , and the prolongation of the period of combination with the serum , have the effect of equalising the amounts of phagocytosis at high and low temperatures even after low-temperature combination .
Throughout the experiments which illustrate this point , thin coccal emulsions were combined with serum for long periods , and the mixtures required no centrifugalising before use .

Experiment XI.\#151 ; This experiment was designed to show the effect of varying the combination times at the two temperatures 37 ' C. and 18 ' C. Samples for phagocytic purposes were removed from the serum-eoccal mixtures every half hour and exposed to the action of the leucocytes .

] The Influence of Temperature on Phagocytosis .
193 the degree of phagocytosis is independent of the temperature within the range 37 ' C.\#151 ; 18 ' C. Further , when we compare the figures in the two series , those of the right hand series ( combination at 18 ' C. ) decidedly lag behind those of the left hand series ( combination at 37 ' C. ) .
The difference , however , is not nearly so marked as in a previous experiment , where the effects of combination at 37 ' C. and 7 ' C. were compared .
One point is somewhat difficult to explain .
In the case of combination at 18 ' C. it was found in an earlier experiment where thick emulsions were employed that the amount of phagocytosis at 3.8 ' C. fell considerably below that at 37 ' C. In the present experiment , where thin emulsions were employed for combining purposes , these values are equalised .
The reason probably is that , although the rate of combination at 18 ' C. is slower than that at 37 ' C. , prolonged contact of serum with cocci at the lower temperature ( 18 ' C. ) effects a maximum absorption of opsonin by the cocci for that temperature , and , consequently , when phagocytosis takes place , the influence of temperature within the range 37 ' C.\#151 ; 18 ' C. is reduced to a minimum , just as in the case of combination at 37 ' C. In a paper by Bulloch and Atkin ( 1905 ) it is stated that the combination of the opsonin with the micro-organism takes place as readily at 0 ' C. as at 37 ' C. If this were so , it would be difficult to explain many of the experimental results detailed above .
Dean ( 1905 ) , on the contrary , observed that combination at 0 ' C. was much slower than at 37 ' C. The problem was again attacked in the following way :\#151 ; ExperimentXII.\#151 ; Emulsions of dead tubercle bacilli were incorporated with equal volumes of serum at the temperatures of 37 ' C. and 0 ' C. for a period of 30 minutes .
The mixtures were then completely centrifugalised and the opsonic contents of the supernatant fluids towards fresh tubercle bacilli compared , fresh normal serum , in corresponding dilution , being employed as .

7*1 These were the figures obtained after phagocytosis for 15 minutes .
When phagocytosis was prolonged to 30 minutes the corresponding values obtained were 1*6 , 11*3 and 10'9 .
The supernatant fluid , after combination at 37 ' C. , had therefore been exhausted of its available opsonin after 15 minutes , whereas in the case of the second supernatant fluid ( combination at 0'C .
) , the prolongation of the incubation period from 15 minutes to 30 minutes had the effect of more than doubling the phagocytic intake .
Further , these fluids were tested against a fresh emulsion of staphylococci , when the following figures were obtained :\#151 ; 0*9 , 3*2 , and 4*0 ( control serum ) .
After combination at 37 ' C. , therefore , the serum had lost nearly all its contents of tubercular and staphylococcal opsonins , whereas , after absorption at 0 ' C. little loss had occurred .
It may be noted that incidentally the result tells against the specificity of the opsonin of normal serum .
There can be no doubt that absorption at 37 ' C. removes from a serum far more opsonin in the same time than absorption at 0 ' C. does .
An attempt was made to test the degree of sensitisation of the centrifugalised bacilli after combination at 37 ' C. and 0 ' C. respectively .
The supernatant fluids were removed and replaced by saline ( twice repeated ) .
When leucocytes were added to saline emulsions of the deposited bacilli , made up to the same volume and incubated at 37 ' CL , little difference was found in the numbers taken up in the two cases .
The technique is difficult and further experiments may have to be performed in this connexion , but if the phenomenon is constant it would show that at 37 ' C. the bacilli absorb more opsonin than is necessary for efficient sensitisation , while at 0 ' C. the bacilli remove just sufficient opsonin to prepare them for phagocytosis .
Nummary and Conclusions .
t. When serum , cocci , and leucocytes are mixed directly and incubated at different temperatures , the number of cocci taken up increases more or less regularly with the temperature .
By this method it has been shown that the phagocytic intake at 18 ' C. is only about one-fourth to one-fifth of that at 37 ' C. 1907 .

195 2 .
This fall , at least within the temperature range 37 ' 0.\#151 ; 18 ' C. , is due to the diminished rate of combination of the serum with the coccus as the temperature falls .
3 .
When cocci which have previously been exposed to the action of serum , either at 37 ' C. or at 18 ' C. , are put in contact with leucocytes , the intake is practically the same whether the phagocytosis takes place at 37 ' C. or at 18 ' C. The number taken up , however , after combination at 18 ' C. and more especially at 7 ' CM falls very short of the number taken up after combination at 37 ' C. 4 .
Experimental results , detailed above , lead one to assume that prolonged contact of a serum with cocci at a low temperature ( 18 ' C. or 7 ' C. ) leads to a maximum absorption of opsonin by the cocci ( corresponding to that temperature ) , so that the subsequent phagocytosis is identical whether it takes place at 37 ' C. or at 18 ' C. 5 .
Provided that cocci loaded with opsonin up to a certain maximum are presented to the leucocyte , the phagocytic energy of the latter is independent of the temperature within a wide range .
6 .
From the appearances on stained films it would seem that sensitised micro-organisms exposed to the action of leucocytes at very low temperatures tend to congregate near the periphery of the leucocytes , although little or no phagocytosis may take place .
Hence , within a suitable temperature range , it may be presumed that the inclusion of sensitised micro-organisms by the leucocyte is a surface tension effect taking place between the coccus and the protoplasmic wall , amoeboid energy playing only a subordinate part in the process .
