] Having shown that if the pressure of the atmosphere be represented either by the square , or by the cube of the square root of the density , the astronomical refraction may be attained in a finite equation ; and having adverted to Mr. Ivory 's computation of the refraction with the assistance of converging series , and several transformations from an equation which expresses the pressure in terms of the density and of its square , Dr. Young proceeds to observe , that if we substitute for the simple density the cube of its square root , we shall represent the constitution of the most important part of the atmosphere with equal accuracy , although this expression supposes the total height somewhat smaller than the truth ; and that we shall thus obtain a direct equation for the refraction , which agrees very nearly with Mr. Ivory 's table , and still more accurately with that in the Nautical Almanac , and with the French tables .
At the horizon the refraction is equal to 33 ' 49"15 , which is only 1"-5 less than the quantity assigned by the French tables and in the Nautical Almanac ; while Mr. Ivory makes it 34 ' 17 " 5 .
Again , for the altitude 50 44f 21 " , we obtain 8 ' 49".5 for the refraction ; while the Nautical Almanac gives us 8 ' 53 " , and Mr. Ivory 's table 8 ' 49 ' 6 .
The author , however , observes that there is no reason for proceeding to compute a new table by this formula , since the method employed for that in the Nautical Almanac is in all common cases more compendious ; and even if it were desired to represent Mr. Ivory 's table by the approximation there employed , we might obtain the same results , with an error scarcely exceeding a single second , from an equation of the same form .
