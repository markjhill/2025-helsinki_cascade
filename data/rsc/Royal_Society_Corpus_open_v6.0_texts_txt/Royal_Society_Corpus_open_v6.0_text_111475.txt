( Abstract .
) The consideration of the surface in question was suggested to me some years ago by Professor Stokes ; but it is proper to remark , that the curve which is the envelope of lines through the points of an ellipse at right angles to the radius vectors through the centre occurs incidentally in Tortolini 's memoir " Sulle relazione , " &amp; c , , Tortolini , vol. vi .
pp. 433 to 466 ( 1855 ) , see p. 461 , where the equation is found to be { 4(a4+ 64a2)-3(a22+ 2y2 ) }3 ={ 9a2(2b2-a2)x2 +9 62(2a22)y24 ( a+ 2)(2a'-b2 ) ( 2(26 a2 ) ) 2 , an equation which is obtained by equating to zero the discriminant of a quartic function .
Tortolini remarks that this equation was first obtained by him in 1846 in the 'Raccolta Scientifica di Roma , ' and he notices that the curve is known under the name of Talbot 's curve .
According to my method , the equation of the curve is obtained by equating to zero the discriminant of a cubic function , and the equation of the surface is obtained by equating to zero the discriminant of a quartic function .
The paper contains a preparatory discussion of the curve , and the surface is then discussed in a similar manner , viz. by means of the equations x=X 2-2(x + +Z ) , y=Y 21(X2+ + Z2 ) , Z=Z 2- , ( X2+Y2+Z2 ) } , which determine the coordinates x , y , z of a point on the surface in terms of X , Y , Z , the coordinates of a point on the ellipsoid .
The surface , which is one of the tenth order , is found to have nodal conics in each of the principal planes , and also a cuspidal curve .
The case more particularly considered is that for which a2 &gt; 262 , 62 &gt; 2c2 , and a2+c2 362 , and the memoir contains a figure showing the form of the surface for the case in question .
The equation of the surface is obtained by the elimination of X , Y , Z between the above-mentioned X2 Y2 Z2 equations and the equation 2++2 1 , as already remarked .
This is reduced to the determination of the discriminant of a quartic function , and the equation of the surface is thus obtained under the form I3-27J2=-0 , where I and J are given functions of the coordinates .
