] Bright Carbon Fluting s in Spectra of Celestial .
39 and the tables which I have given show that nebulae , bright-line stars , stars with mixed flutings , and the aurora have spectra closely resembling those of comets , and are therefore probably also meteoritic phenomena .

" The Presence of Bright Carbon Flutings in the Spectra of Celestial Bodies .
" By J. Norman Lookyer , F.R.S. Received November 23 , 1889 .
One of the chief conclusions arrived at in my former papers was that not only the nebulae but many of the so-called stars are really sparse groups of meteorites , the latter only differing from the former by the fact that they are more condensed .
I also pointed out that if this conclusion were correct the spectra of both these classes of bodies should approximate to those of comets , in which carbon radiation is one of the chief features , while their meteoritic nature is generally accepted .
Since those papers were written a further inquiry has been made , both by looking through the records of past observations , and by additional observations at Kensington and Westgate , with a view of gaining more information as to the presence or absence of bright carbon flutings in the spectra of nebulae and stars .
Certain results have already been obtained which I think sufficiently interesting to communicate to the Society .
Before these observations were made , I suggested that some of Vogel 's observations might be interpreted to signify bright carbon , but there was then a little doubt as to the existence of the bright flutings in the stellar spectra , as their presence was only suggested in some cases by slight rises in the light curves .
The following is a list of the bodies which contain either one or both of the carbon flutings near 517 and 468\#151 ; 474 , the latter being a group of flutings , which , as I have before shown , * sometimes has its point of maximum brightness shifted from 474 to 468 .
The fluting near 564 has been omitted from the table , as it is generally masked , either by continuous spectrum or by the superposition of the fluting of manganese near 558 .
The wave-lengths given are as measured by the various observers stated .
The spectrum of the aurora is added for the sake of completeness .
It will be seen from the table that the record of the presence of carbon is unbroken from a planetary nebula through stars with bright lines to those resembling a Herculis , i.e. , entirely through Groups I and II of my classification .

Magnetisation of Cohalt .
I should add that Mr. Fowler has glimpsed a line less refrangible than that at 500 in the spectrum of the ring nebula in Lyra .
If this should turn out to be the carbon fluting at 517 , it would seem that in that nebula we may have a state of condensation between those represented by the nebula ?
of Orion and _A.ndrom.eda , the carbon replacing the X 500 fluting of magnesium in the nebulae , as apparently happens in comets on their approach to perihelion .

" On the Effects of Pressure on the Magnetisation of Cobalt .
" By C. Chree , M.A. , Fellow of King 's College , Cambridge .
Communicated by Prof. J. J. Thomson , F.R.S. Received November 22 , 1889 .
( Abstract .
) It has long been known , from the classic researches of Dr. Joule , that a rod of iron free from stress increases in length when magnetised in a comparatively weak field .
When , however , the strength of the field is continually raised , it has been found by Mr. Shelford Bidwell that the rod ceases to increase in length , and then shortens , so that in a sufficiently strong field the length becomes less than it was originally .
It has also been found by Villari , Sir W. Thomson , and others that when a rod of iron is exposed to successive loadings and unloadings of a given weight in a magnetic field , there appears a corresponding cyclic change of magnetisation .
In this cyclic change the maximum magnetisation occurs when the load is " on , " or when the load is " off , " according as the field is weaker or stronger than a certain critical field depending on the load , called by Sir W. Thomson the Villari critical field .
Cobalt has been found by Mr. Shelford Bidwell to shorten when magnetised in weak fields , but to lengthen in very strong fields .
The field in which it ceases to shorten is very much higher than the field in which iron ceases to lengthen .
Also in weak fields Sir W. Thomson has found the magnetisation of a cobalt rod under cyclic applications of tension to be least when the tension is " on .
