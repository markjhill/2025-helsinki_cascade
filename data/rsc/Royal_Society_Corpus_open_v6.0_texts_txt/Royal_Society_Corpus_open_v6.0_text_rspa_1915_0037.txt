Experiments in whiob inixtures ok metbane with less than its own volume ok oxygen were exploded in steel bombs at initial pressures ok between 8 and 32 atinosplieres liavs given results in barmon^ withi the " b^drox^la-tion " tbeor^ ok b^drooarbon oombustion put korward some ^ears ago b^ Lrok .

lbs induenos ok various seoondar^ reaetions upon the produots ok the primary oxidation whilst the gases are eooling down akter the attainment ok maximum pressure is diseussed in the light ok the experimental results .
Results ok experiments upon an e^uimoleoular mixture ok etliane and oxygen , wliose bebaviour is eruoial in respeot ok the dikkerent views ok b^drooarbon oombustion advaneed in reeent vears , have again oondrmed rbe li^droxvlation tlieor^ .
^notber seetion ok the paper deals with an experimental determination ok tbs relative akkinities ok metlians , b^drogen , and oarbon monoxide kor oxygen in dames .
It is sliown ( 1 ) that the akdnit^ ok metbane is at least twenty times as great as that ok b^drogen , and ( 2 ) that wlren mixtures corresponding to 6H44 O24-LVH2 are kirsd under liigli initial pressures , in wliioli the partial pressures ok metbane and oxygen are bept oonstant and M on^ varied , the distribution ok oxygen between the metbane and b^drogen varies with a ?
, a eireumstanee whieb means that b^drogen is burnt to steam in dames as the result ok tbs trimoleeular ebange 2H2-I- O2 \#151 ; 282O , and not ( as some have supposed ) tbrougb b^drogen peroxide .
Ibe akdnit^ ok oarbon monoxide is sbown to bo oomparable with that ok b^drogen kor oxygen in dames .
Experiments are also desoribed in whiob mixtures ^k etb^lene , oxygen , and b^drogen , oorresponding to 62H4 d-O2 d-MD2 , Deesnr-x-srtron .

were exploded at bigb initial pressures ; r'-r^s- ' \#171 ; /r\#171 ; it was kound possible to increase \#171 ; up to 8 without causing an^ deposition ok carbon on explosion .
Ike tbeoretical bearing ok the results is kull^ discussed .
Mis dual section ok the paper describes expsriinents in which the whole pressure curves , up to and kar beyond the attainment ok maximum pressure , were recorded when mixtures corresponding to ( 1 ) 2Hz-l-0s 4-41^2 .
( 2 ) 200-p O2-l-41^2 , and ( 3 ) 684-K O2 4-4X2 , are exploded under initial pressure ok about 50 atmospberes .
It is sbown that tbs rates ok attainment ok maximum pressure in eacb case have no direct relation to tbs order ok albnities ok the various gases kor oxygen .

) It is well known that the gases liberated during certain chemical actions carr^ cbarges ok electricity , Ibus Davoisier and Daplace kound that the b^drogen liberated krom the action ok b^drocbloric acid upon iron is cbarged positively .
Idore recently Dnrigbt(l ) bas noted the same ekkect , and lownsend ( 2 ) bas sbown that the gases liberated during electrolysis are also cbarged .
In a previous paper ( 3 ) evidence bas been brougbt korward to sbow that tbs decomposition ok organic matter gives rise to electrical eKeels which are ok tbs same nature as tboss produced b^ the action ok acids upon metals .
It seemed tberekore an interesting point to investigate whetber tbs OO2 escaping krom the kermentation ok a saccbarine solution migbt carr^ an electric ebargs and be ionised .
1o determine this point a sSries ok experiments were carried out b^ tbs employment ok a gold leak electroscope and a Dolesalek electrometer .
Ibe metbod adopted was to suspend a metal plats with rolled edge a kew centimetres above the surkace ok glucose undergoing kermentation tbrougb the action ok ^east , the metal plate being connected with the electroscope or electrometer , and tbs whole suitably screened in a box lined with tinkoil .
Headings were tbsn taken in the ordinary manner , von .
