Determination of the Optical Constants of Crystallized Substances .
( First and Second Series .
) By ALBERT SChIRAUP ( Vienna ) .
In the two hitherto published series of these investigations , the data concerning the refractive and dispersive powers of twenty crystallized substances are communicated .
Being persuaded that crystallo-physics , more than any other branch of physical science , is founded on quantitative calculation of absolute exactitude , I contrived to obtain first incontestable facts connected with the hitherto somewhat neglected phenomena of dispersion and refraction .
Nearly 1000 substances have been crystallographically investigated , and about 200 have been made the object of optical researches ; many of them , however , have remained unknown as to their dispersive andL reflective powers , which , representing the quantitative and qualitative action of any substance on the propagation of light , are of absolute necessity for the construction of any sound theory .
It becomes every day a greater necessity to obtain , within these extensive dominions of human knowledge , a certain number of general views , subservient to the explanation and systematic arrangement of a great number of isolated facts , as only a small portion of the present investigation has led to the establishment of general laws .
The great problem of crystallo-physics proposed for solution may be expressed by the question , WThat is the causal connexion between chemical constitution and morphological and optical properties ?
The phenomena of isomorphism , discovered by Prof. Mitscherlich , have indeed thrown considerable light on the mutual relation of chemical constitution and morphological properties ; yet little , if anything , has been done to arrive at the solution of the problem in its general form .
As latterly several doubts have been expressed as to the possible existence of such a connexion , the purpose of my investigations shall be not only ( as expressed in their title ) to fill up deficiencies in the knowledge of facts , but also to propose several explanations indicating the real existence of such a connexion , and the necessity of making it an object of earnest research .
In the following paragraphs I intend only to mention some theorems whose solution is already achieved .
Another series of my investigations , to be published subsequently , is to afford general demonstrations and applications of consequences in strict connexion with duly stated facts .
The most important of the theorems , as far as they may be simply enunciated , are§ 1 .
The calculation , graphic representation , and derivation of all the crystallographical and physical properties of the rhlombohedral system are possible if three rectangular axes are assumed ; the axis c coinciding with the principal rhombohedral axis , and the axes a and b with the diagonals of the prism of 600 .
§ 2 .
The following indices represent consequently the characteristic equations for the symmetrical crystallographic systems : Rectangular Axes .
Tesseral a:b : c1 : : 1 Pyramidal 1:1 : Rhombohedral = / 3 : 1 Prismatic h : 1:1 .
§ 3 .
The optical axes of elasticity , coinciding with the diagonal of the prism of 60 ?
, are nearly equal to each other , and ( a and 3 being axes of elasticity and a and b crystallographical axes ) if limit is supposed to be = / 3 , then a=/ 3 .
§ 4 .
Whenever a prism of 60 ?
is extant in the prismatic system , the first median line ( " bissectrice de l'angle aigu " ) is perpendicular to its diagonal* .
§ 5 .
Whenever a number of prisms of 60 ?
are extant ( 110 , 011 , 1 01 ) , the first median line stands perpendicular to the diagonals of one of these prisms , and simultaneously to the plane of cleavage .
§ 6 .
The first median line is generally perpendicular to the diagonal of prisms , whose limit may be expressed by simpler proportions , as 1 : 2:/ 3 : / 5:V7 .
§ 7 .
The dispersion of the optical axes in the prismatic system is dependent on the magnitude of the crystallographical axis , with whiech the middle axis of elasticity is coincident .
( A ) If the crystallographical axes ( d2 , ^ being a crystallographical axis , with which coincides the second medizan line dp , with this the medial axis of elasticity being coincident ) are to each other as limit of the square roots of odd numbers , then for d3 &gt; d2mn is p &gt; v , d3 &lt; dCm is p &lt; v. ( B ) If the same axes are to each other as the square roots of even numbers to the odd , then the law of dispersion becomes the reverse of what it was under the first supposition ( A ) .
§ 8 .
Hemnimorphous substances are dependent on the opposite law as to the dispersion of their optic axes .
§ 9 .
Vhenever , according to Cauchy , the index of refraction p/ =A-+ v ( A being the coefficient of refraction and B the coeffiient of dispersion ) , the relation betwee-n density D of the substances and the coefficients A and B is expressed by the following formula 2A dAMdD , xlin aD =0 D Olim D =0 'DJ i= D -.DdB= 2NDdD , im D=o lillr D=O M and N remaining invariable quantities for every elementary substance .
If M is made to signify specific power of refraction , and N specific power of disper'sion , their values may be found out by means of the following equations-A2 -B -^-=M , D--N .
§ 10 .
The consequence from § 9 is , that the density of the ether may be set in proportion to the density of the substances* .
11 .
Not the elasticity , but rather the density is subject to variation ( Fresnel 's theory ) .
§ 12 .
The consequence of § 9 is , that the proagation of iight iay be equally conceived as being independent of the luminous ether , and only in dependence on the substantial molecules .
§ 13 .
If Fresnel 's formula is derived from the principle of conserA2-1 vation of vis viva , and -Dis substituted , a formula similar to Cauchy 's in structure is thus obtained .
§ 14 .
In consequence of § 9 , it appears possible to calculate the density in the three dimensions of any crystal , and to bring this new monment in connexion with the rest of the physical properties .
§ 15 .
The densities being proportional to the masses , and these to the distance r of the molecules , the coefficient of dispersion must be subject to the general law of gravitation , and it would be admissible to write Ba --N .
It must be remarked that , in consequence of the more or less relative mobility of the molecules , N must have a different value for different substances .
§ 16 .
The elementary substances , according to Boedecker 's theory , not entering into mutual combination with the same density and correlation of atoms as they possess in the state of liberty , it may be admitted that they are probably compelled to form double molecules , or semi-molecules .
In the second case of combination the specific power of refraction would be the double , in the first only the half of what it was in the elementary substance , when still chemically free .
§ 17 .
The indices of 'efraction of chemical combinations and mixtures may be calculated on the supposition enounced in § 16 .
Absolute exactitude may be obtained for any extensive groups , of which some members , and consequently the law of their chemical combination , are known .
The general law here is-Substances with nearly equal powers of refraction may combine without alteration in them .
If these powers are very different , and far distant from each other , they tend to become homogeneous , so that the greater power of refraction is halved , and the lesser is doubled ( see § 16 ) .
§ 18 .
The coefficient of dispersion of combined substancest seems also to be derivable from the principles stated in §§ 9 and 16 ; as B being dependent on d2 , must change proportionally to the square of molecular condensation ( see § 16 ) .
§ 19 .
In consequence of § 9 , the lines of Fraunhofer ( although the constancy of the lengths of undulation , to which they answer , remains unaltered ) , when refracting substances are condensed , must advance their centre toward the violet end , in analogy to the phenomena of absorption , observed by Weiss ( Poggendorff 's ' Annalen , ' 1861 ) .
For this reason absorption must depend on the length of the undulation .
* Evidence is afforded by Dulong 's , Dale 's , and Gladstone 's determinations , also by all other , especially organic , combinations , on account of the simplicity of their formulae ; also by Deville 's , Grailich 's , Handl 's , and Weiss 's determinations con .
cerning mixed substances .
t Our knowledge of the coefficients of dispersion proper to chemical elements being still very defective , it is impossible to bring this proposition to full evidence .
Sulphuret of carbon may serve for demonstration , and similar inferences may be deduced from investigations concerning mixtures .
These propositions , and some others of similar nature which I succeeded in deriving , incomplete as they still may be in many respects , prove at all events that , even in this department of human knowledge , theoretical points of departure exist from which , by progressive investigation , the real connexion of facts may possibly be traced .
My next purpose is to coordinate as much as possible whatever is at present known of facts , bringing them under general points of view as materials for a future scientific theory .
I intend to publish by and by these investigations as completely as possible , in constant connexion with the phenomena which they are suited to explain , never leaving the secure foundation of experimental research .
Here I intend only to offer a brief abstract of the facts obtained through the first two series of investigations , published in the 'Proceedings ' of the Vienna Imperial Academy ( vols .

These investigations took place in the Imperial Physical Institute of Vienna , and could only be effectually accomplished through the liberal and kind assistance I received from the Director of the Institute , from the Director of the Imperial Museum of Mineralogy , and from the Superintendent of the Chemical Laboratory of the Imperial Geological Institute In these results are comprised the exponent of refraction , the calculated axial angle , the aperture of the cone of internal conical refraction , the measure of the apparent axial angle , and crystallographical investigations .
For brevity 's sake I will only communicate the exponent of refraction for Fraunhofer 's lines B and H , and the most important among the crystallographical determinations .
