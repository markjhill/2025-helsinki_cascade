( Communicated by W. Bateson , F.R.S. Received May 7 , \#151 ; Read November 14 , 1907 .
) The following notes on the inheritance of eye-colour in man are based on material examined by the writer in the village of Burbage , Leicestershire .
During the past three years , 139 pairs of parents and 683 of their offspring have been examined , with the following results:\#151 ; Eye-colour in man depends almost wholly on the colour of the iris .
The colour of the iris varies considerably in different families and often in different individuals of the same family .
This variability is due partly to the presence or absence of different pigments on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the iris , and partly , in all probability , to actual differences in the structure of the iris .
In the Report of the Anthropometric Committee of the British Association for 1880 , the following statement concerning the nature of eye-colour in man is given by Mr. Charles Roberts ( pp. 134 to 136):\#151 ; " The iris , on which the colour of the eye depends , is a thin membranous structure , composed of unstriped muscular fibres , nerves , and blood-vessels , held together by a delicate network of fibrous tissue .
On the inner surface of this membrane there is a layer of dark purple pigment called the uvea . . .
and in brown eyes there is an additional layer of yellow ( and , perhaps , brown-red ) pigment on its outer surface also , and in some instances there is a deposit of pigment amongst the fibrous structures .
In the albino where the pigment is entirely absent from both surfaces of the iris , the bright red blood is seen through the semi-transparent fibrous tissues of a fink colour ; and in blue eyes , where the outer layer of pigment is wanting , the various shades are due to the dark inner layer of pigment\#151 ; the \#151 ; showing through fibrous structures of different densities or degrees of opacity .
" The eyes of new-born infants . . .
are dark blue , in consequence of the greater delicacy and transparency of the fibrous portion of the iris ; and as these tissues become thickened by use , and by advancing age , the lighter shades of blue and , finally , grey are produced , the grey , indeed , being chiefly due to the colour of the fibrous tissues themselves .
In grey eyes , moreover , we see the first appearance of the superficial layer of yellow pigment in the Mr. C. C. Hurst .
[ May 7 , .
form of isolated patches situated around the margin of the pupil , or in rays running across the iris .
" In the various shades of green eyes the yellow pigment is more uniformly diffused over the surface of the iris , and the green colour is due to the blending of the superficial yellow pigment with the blue and grey of the deeper structures .
In the hazel and brown eyes the and the fibrous tissues are hidden by increasing deposits of yellow and brown pigment on the anterior surface of the iris , and when this is very dense , black eyes are the result .
" The above statement agrees well with my own observations , though I would add that the presence of the superficial layer of yellow pigment , when only slightly developed , is to be seen in blue eyes as well as in grey eyes .
No albinos were met with in the material examined by me , and my observations , therefore , relate to pigmented eyes only .
It has generally been supposed that the various types of eye-colours grade into each other without sensible breaks of continuity .
A critical examination , however , shows that there is a distinct discontinuity between:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The eyes in which two kinds of pigments are present ; the one , yellow-brown in colour , deposited on the outer or anterior surface of the iris ; the other , blue-black in colour , deposited on the inner or posterior surface of the iris .
Such eyes I propose to call duplex .
( 2 ) The eyes in which the posterior pigment alone is present in the iris , the anterior pigment being absent .
Such eyes may be called simplex .
The application of popular names to these types is uncertain and quite unreliable ; but , in general , eyes that would be called brown belong to the duplex type , while many of the blues and some of the greys belong to the simplex type .
( 1 ) The Duplex Type .
To the duplex type belong the various shades of eyes with both anterior and posterior pigments .
In my observations , three distinct patterns of duplex eyes were found , viz.:\#151 ; ( a , ) The self-coloured duplex , in which the anterior pigment is distributed over the whole front of the iris , practically obscuring the posterior pigment as in ordinary brown eyes .
( b ) The ringed duplex , in which the anterior pigment is confined to a ringed area round the pupil , leaving the ground colour of posterior pigment clearly exposed round the periphery of the iris .
( c ) The spotted duplex , in which the anterior pigment is broken up into distinct blotches or spots irregularly scattered over the posterior pigment which forms the ground colour .
1907 .
] On the Inheritance of Eye-colour in Man .
Self-coloured duplex eyes vary in shade , presenting different grades of anterior pigmentation .
In the darker brown shades the anterior pigment is more densely deposited than in the lighter green shades , the green effect being produced by a thin layer\#151 ; or in some cases merely a fine irroration\#151 ; of yellow pigment above the blue posterior layer .
Binged duplex eyes similarly vary in shade , presenting different grades of anterior pigmentation .
In my experience , the distribution of anterior pigment is always denser immediately round the pupil , both in self-coloured and ringed duplex eyes .
Eyes with a ring of anterior pigment round the periphery of the iris , but without anterior pigment round the pupil , were not found in my observations .
Spotted duplex eyes also present different grades of anterior pigmentation .
The pigmented areas also vary in size and number in different individuals and in the two eyes of the same individual .
Low-grade forms of the ringed duplex pattern are apparently numerous : under ordinary observation these might no doubt pass as blue or grey simplex eyes , the small pigmented ring so blending with the dark pupil as to be unrecognised at a short distance .
Similarly , low-grade forms of the spotted duplex pattern would also pass as blue or grey simplex eyes at a short distance .
In both cases , however , a closer inspection reveals their true nature .
In carrying out my observations , I found that about half of the eyes , which appeared to be simplex when viewed in the ordinary wray , were really duplex when closely examined in a good light .
Eyes presenting grades of anterior pigmentation so 1owt that they can be mistaken for simplices have not occurred in my experience , and if such eyes do occur , they must be extremely rare in the population which I have studied .
In duplex eyes the anterior pigment is visible soon after birth , so that quite young infants are included in my observations .
That anterior pigmentation tends to increase with age in young children is evident from the results of my observations during three years , though to what extent is not yet clear , owung to the limited period of observation .
( 2 ) The Simplex Type .
To the simplex type belong the various shades of eyes with posterior pigment only , the anterior pigment being quite absent , as in all clear blue and clear grey eyes .
The darker shades of blue are apparently due to the greater delicacy and .transparency of the fibrous tissues of the iris through which the posterior VOL. LXXX.\#151 ; B. H Mr. C. C. Hurst .
[ May 7 , pigment is seen , while the lighter shades of blue and the coarser greys seem to be due to the greater coarseness and opacity of the same tissues .
These structural differences appear to be continuous , a series of intermediate blue-greys linking up the finer blues with the coarser greys .
A further complication arises from the fact that , in most cases , the finer tissues of the iris become coarser with age , and young children with dark blue eyes may mature into adults with light blue , blue-grey , or grey eyes .
I have found striking illustrations of this in large families , where a whole series of shades from blue to grey were seen , the younger children being blue and the older ones grey .
Consequently , no attempt has been made to distinguish between the many shades of clear blue and clear grey eyes , but all eyes with posterior pigment only are classed as simplex .
Finally , the clear blue and clear grey simplex eyes , with no trace of anterior pigment , must be carefully distinguished from the numerous low-grade duplex eyes , previously noted , which are often called " blue or " grey .
" Heredity of the Duplex and Simplex Types .
All families with less than two children are omitted , and families of two were not taken freely .
At first , the largest families available were selected , , but afterwards it seemed desirable to study collaterals , consequently some small families are included .
Out of the 139 families observed , 20 were simplex matings , 50 were duplex matings , and 69 were duplex-simplex matings .
Simplex Matings .
The 20 matings of simplex females with simplex males produced 101 offspring , all of the simplex type .
Table I gives the numbers found in each family .

] On the Inheritance of Eye-colour in .
With regard to the heredity of the duplex and simplex types , the above tables show that:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Simplex parents mated together give all simplex offspring .
( 2 ) Duplex parents mated together give either all duplex offspring , or ( b ) duplex and simplex offspring in the proportion of about 3:1 .
( 3 ) Duplex parents mated with simplex parents give either ( a ) all duplex offspring , or ( b ) duplex and simplex offspring in the proportion of about 1:1 .
It is evident , therefore , that the simplex type , in heredity , behaves as a Mendelian recessive to the duplex type , which is dominant .
We have already seen that the duplex type differs from the simplex type by the presence of anterior pigment in the iris .
The unit-characters concerned in the heredity of the duplex and simplex types of eyes are , therefore , presence ( duplex ) and absence ( simplex ) of anterior pigment in the iris , presence being dominant over absence , which is recessive .
The duplex parents in Tables II ( \amp ; ) and III ( b ) are all obviously heterozygous , carrying the simplex character in a recessive state .
The duplex parents in Tables II ( a ) and III ( a ) may be either homozygous or heterozygous .
The duplex parents in Table III ( a ) with large families are almost certainly homozygous , but in those with small families the numbers of offspring are insufficient to test adequately the gametic constitution of the duplex parents .
Similarly in the case of the large families in Table II ( a ) , one of the duplex parents is almost certainly homozygous , while the other parent may be either homozygous or heterozygous .
In the small families the numbers of offspring are again too small to test adequately the gametic constitution of the duplex parents .
In proof of this we have the fact that in Table III ( a ) each of the three duplex parents of families 53 D. A. , 125 E. R. , and 209 J. H. is known to have a simplex parent and consequently must be heterozygous , though none of them has yet produced simplex offspring .
Similarly in Table II ( a ) both duplex parents of family 13 J. C. are known to have a simplex parent , though they have not yet produced any simplex offspring .
As might be expected in a mixed population , some of the simplex parents observed are known to have been extracted from a duplex parent , or to have had duplex brethren .
For instance , in Table I , at least one of the simplex parents of families 15 A. F. , 97 H. C. , 231 W. K. , 255 J. H. , and 257 \lt ; T. C. is known to have a duplex parent , while of the families 31 D. N. and 243 J. F. one parent at least has duplex brethren .
In accordance with the Mendelian principles , the extracted simplex type Mr. C. C. Hurst .
[ May breeds true to the simplex character without reversion to its duplex ancestors .
In view of recent Mendelian experiments with plants and animals , it did not seem impossible that some simplex individuals at least might be carrying factors which on meeting , in the process of fertilisation , with other complementary factors , might give rise to reversions of the duplex type , but , so far , no such cases have been found .
For the present , therefore , while remembering such a possibility , we must take it that the duplex and simplex types of eye-colour in man constitute a simple Mendelian case of presence and absence of a certain pigment .
With regard to the different patterns of duplex eyes and their various shades , my facts , so far , do not enable me to determine positively their genetic relations .
The chief difficulty is due to the fact that the anterior pigment present in children tends to increase with age , though to what extent , or to what age , is not yet known , owing to the limited period of observation .
In the few families observed , with all adult offspring , the evidence suggests that the ringed pattern is recessive to the self-coloured pattern , which is dominant ; but with regard to the genetic relations of the spotted pattern to the ringed and self-coloured patterns there is practically no evidence available .
Previous Work .
Large numbers of records of eye-colours have been compiled and discussed by anthropologists and biometricians at home and abroad .
In most cases , however , the data relate to certain sections of the population , such as school children and conscripts , not analysed or grouped according to their families .
So far , I have found only two memoirs which approach the question of the inheritance of eye-colour in man by a comparison of parents with their offspring .
The first is that of Alphonse de Candolle.* ' De Candolle , with the assistance of some 28 experienced observers , collected a number of records of the inheritance of eye-colours in Switzerland , Germany , and Sweden .
De Candolle made two classes of eye-colours , " brown " and " blue , " omitting all doubtful shades .
The " brown " class included " black , " " brown , " " yellow-brown , " and " green-brown .
" The " blue " class included " blue , " " blue-grey , " " grey , " " green-blue , " and " green-grey .
" Comparing de Candolle 's classes and shades with mine , it is evident that all the " brown " class belong to the duplex type with anterior pigment , but that only part of the " blue " class belong to the simplex type , without anterior pigment .

] On the Inheritance of E Man .
The second memoir is that of Mr. Francis Gal ton.* * * S Mr. Galton collected a number of records of family eye-colours in the British Isles , among the " Records of Family Faculties " \#151 ; known as the R.F.F. data .
These family records were obtained through the offer of prizes to the public.f From the family records sent in , Mr. Galton made three classes of eye-colours , " light , " " hazel , " and " dark .
" The " light " class included the shades recorded as " light blue , " " blue , " " dark blue , " " grey , " and " blue-green .
" The " hazel " class included " dark grey " and " hazel .
" The " dark " class included " black , " " very dark brown , " " dark brown , " " brown , " and " light brown .
" Comparing the shades of colour sent in to Mr. Galton by his correspondents with mine , it is evident that all of Mr. Galton 's " dark " class belong to the duplex type with anterior pigment .
With regard to the " hazel " class , part of these would probably represent my ringed duplex pattern , while the remainder might belong either to the duplex or simplex type , according to the interpretations of the colours by different observers .
Mr. Galton apparently regards " dark grey " and " hazel " as bicolour eyes , * which would make them practically equivalent to my ringed duplex eyes .
In view , however , of my experience with popular descriptions of eye-colours , it is highly probable that many of Mr. Galton 's correspondents would record certain forms of self-coloured duplex eyes as " hazel , " and certain forms of " simplex " eyes as " dark grey .
" Mr. Galton 's " light " class would apparently consist partly of the simplex type without anterior pigment , and partly of the low-grade forms of the duplex type with some anterior pigment .
In the nature of the circumstances in which the E.F.F. data were recorded , it cannot , of course , be expected that the observations were critical in regard to the presence or absence of anterior pigment in the iris .
On the whole , therefore , it does not seem possible to express either de Candolle 's or Mr. Galton 's classes and shades of eye-colours in terms of duplex and simplex pigmentation .
It was on Mr. Galton 's R.F.F. data that Professor Karl Pearson based his memoir " ( )n the Inheritance of Eye-colour in Man , " S and afterwards concluded that nothing corresponding to Mendel 's principles appeared in the characters for eye-colour in man.|| * " Family Likeness in Eye-colour , " 'Roy .

96 On the Inheritance of Eye-colour in Mari .
Summary .
An examination of the eye-colours of a number of parents and their offspring in a Leicestershire village shows that there are at least two discontinuous types of iris in man:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The duplex type , with both anterior and posterior pigments , as in ordinary brown eyes .
( 2 ) The simplex type , with posterior pigment only , the anterior pigment being absent , as in clear blue eyes .
In heredity the simplex type behaves as a Mendelian recessive to the duplex type , which is dominant .
The unit characters concerned are evidently presence ( duplex ) and absence ( simplex ) of anterior pigment on a basis of posterior pigment , presence being dominant .
The duplex and simplex types can be distinguished at any age .
Various pigmental and structural changes take place in the iris during childhood and youth , the extent of which is not yet known .
Few families with living parents and offspring , all adult , are to be found in one village .
Consequently , it has not yet been possible to determine the genetic relations between the various shades of the duplex type .
Note.\#151 ; I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. W. Bateson for some valuable criticisms and suggestions in regard to the preparation of this paper , and also to Mr. B. C. Punnett , who came down and examined a number of the simplex eyes recorded above .
( Note added 11 th , 1908 .
) Since the above paper was presented , an article on " Heredity of Eye-colour in Man " has appearedfin ' Science , ' 1907 , vol. 26 , pp. 589\#151 ; 592 ( dated 1st November ) , in which Professor C. P\gt ; .
Davenport independently arrives at similar conclusions , pointing out the Mendelian inheritance of eye-colour in man .
