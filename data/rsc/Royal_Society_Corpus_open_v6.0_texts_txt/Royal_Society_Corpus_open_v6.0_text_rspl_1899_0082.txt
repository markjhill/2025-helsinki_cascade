" The Piscian Stars .
" By Sir Norman Lockyer , K.C.B. , F.B.S. Beceived November 20 , \#151 ; Bead December 14 , 1899 .
Introductory .
In the Bakerian Lecture for 1888* I briefly considered the relation j of the stars having spectra with predominant carbon absorption ( for which I have recently suggested the name to the various pther types of celestial bodies .
Shortly afterwards I began the discussion of the observations which had been made by Duner in the case of these stars .
Those relating to Group II ( now named Antarian ) , another group studied by Duner , were fully dealt with in the Bakerian Lecture , but after all the available information as to the former had been brought together , I found that notwithstanding the admirable data which Duner had put on record , there were some points on which further information was desirable .
In the Antarian stars we had evidence as to the lines present in company with the various flutings , but in the Piscian stars even the presence or absence of lines was somewhat uncertain .
The publication of this investigation was therefore postponed to see what light could be thrown upon the subject by further observations .
At various times , as the work permitted , such observations have been attempted , and the results , so far as they went , did not disturb the classification at which I had already arrived .
Still , the information thus gained was less complete than desired .
The photographic work which has quite recently been done on these stars by Dr. McClean and Professor Hale has now furnished the additional information required , and it is therefore unnecessary to delay the publication of the memoir , some ten years old , which in the main points stands as it was written .
Historical Statement .
Secchi was the first to recognise stars with spectra of the type under discussion during his spectroscopic survey made in 1866 and 1867 .
They constituted his fourth type .
All the stars of the group are of small magnitude , and of a deep red colour .
He was inclined to believe that a radiation spectrum was in question , but pointed out that there was a relation between the flutings of carbon and the dark bands seen in the spectra of the stars .
He says :\#151 ; " Quelques-unes des rays noires , et les plus importantes , coincident a tres-peu pres avec celles du troisieme type ; cependant le spectre , dans son ensemble , se pr^sente * 'Roy .

The Piscian Stars .
com me un spectre direct appartenant a un corps gazeux , plutbt que comme un spectre d'absorption .
Si on Je considere comme un spectre d'absorption on trouve qu'il present le caractere des composes du carbone , tels qu'on les obtient en produisant un serie d'etincelles electriques dans un melange de vapeur de benzine et d'air atmo-spherique et dans Fare voltaique entres les charbons."* Secchi also states !
that bright lines are occasionally seen in the spectra of stars of this type , and in a diagram of the spectrum of 152 Schjellerup he indicates no less than six bright lines .
Duner in 1884 catalogued fifty-five stars of this group , and recorded the details of their spectra , so far as he was able to observe them .
J Referring to Secchi 's work , Duner says:\#151 ; " Secchi s'est beaucoup occupe de ces spectres , mais il y a de tres graves erreurs dans ce qu'il dit sir l'apparence qu'ils offrent et sir leur nature .
D'abord il prononce a plusieurs occasions dans sa ' Memoria seconda ' et dans son ouvrage * Le Soleil ' que le rouge leur manque presque absolument .
Pour ma part , je l'ai trouve tres vif dans tous , seulement un peu pale en com-paraison avec la sous-zone jaune excessivement brillante .
Puis Secchi parle des rays vives qui termineraient , du c6te du violet , les zones brillantes .
Mais ni dans la zone verte ni dans la bleu je n'ai vu la moindre chose qui put expliquer un tel enonce , et je sais que M. Vogel n'a pas ete plus heureux .
Quant aux deux rays brillantes que Secchi dit avoir vu dans le jaune , else se rapportent selon tout probability a la sous-zone jaune , laquelle , comme je viens de le dire , est divisee en deux par un band etroite .
Secchi s'est plus tard persuade , par des mesures , que les deux rays jaunes n'ontpas la meme position que celles du sodium ; mais il est neanmoins difficile de comprendre comment il a pu croire que cette zone , quarante fois plus large que la distance entre Dx et D2 , fftt les rays du sodium .
Au rest il parait dispose a admettre que tout le spectre est un spectre direct emis par un gaz incandescent .
Pour moi , il est tout a fait incontestable que e'est un spectre d'absorption , tout aussi bien que celui des etoiles de la Class Ilia , et M. Vogel a deja , il y a quelques annees , emis un pareille opinion , et il l'a repetee tout recemment."S In 1865 Zollner pointed out that spectra might enable us to determine the relative ages of celestial bodies , and suggested that the yellow and red light of certain stars were indications of a reduction of temperature .
|| There is now no doubt that stars with fluted spectra , whether of Group II ( Antarian ) or Group VI ( Piscian ) , are cooler than stars like the sun and a Lyrae , which have line spectra .

important difference between the two groups , as I pointed out in the Bakerian Lecture .
In the Antarian stars we have to deal with condensing swarms of meteorite 'll in which the temperature is increasing , whereas in the Piscian stars we have an advanced stage in the cooling of masses of meteoritic vapours .
In the case of Antarian stars we have mixed radiation and absorption flutings , and I suggested a way in which the stars of the group might be divided into fifteen distinct species , representing successive stages in condensation .
We have now to consider a similar classification of the Piscian stars , of which I stated in the Bakerian Lecture ( p. 26):\#151 ; " The species of which it will ultimately be composed are already apparently shadowed forth in the map which accompanies Dun^r 's volume , and they will evidently be subsequently differentiated by the gradual addition of other absorptions to that of carbon , while at the same time the absorption of carbon gets less and less distinct .
" In considering the stars of this group , it is most important to bear in mind that there are indications of carbon absorption in the spectrum of the sun .
I first obtained evidence of the existence of carbon vapour in the solar atmosphere in 1874 , and in 1878 I communicated a paper to the Koyal Society on that subject.* Angstrom had already shown that the true carbon lines were not reversed in the solar spectrum , but I demonstrated by photographic comparisons that there was a perfect correspondence between the individual members of the brightest part of the fluting in the ultra violet ( commencing at A 3883*55 ) , and a series of fine dark lines in the solar spectrum .
I pointed out that this carbon vapour existed in a more complicated molecular condition ( as is evidenced by the flutings ) than the metallic vapours in the sun 's , atmosphere . !
There can therefore be no doubt that in the sun carbon absorption is just commencing , and that , as I stated in a former paper , !
" the indications of carbon will go on increasing in intensity slowly , until a stage is reached when , owing to reduction of temperature of the most effective absorbing layer , the chief absorption will be that of carbon\#151 ; a stage in which we now find the stars of Class III6 of Yogel 's classification .

The Piscian Stars .
General Characteristics of the Spectra .
The main features of the spectra are three broad dark fiutings , which fade off to the violet end of the spectrum .
These , as is now well known , coincide with the three principal bands in the spectrum of high temperature* * * S carbon .
The wave-lengths of the bands , and Duner s numbers , are as follows:\#151 ; No. of band .
i Duner 's mean A. - Vogel 's mean A.f Hot carbon ( Angstrom ) .
6 563-3 563-1 563 -3 9 516 '3 515 -9 516 -4 10 472 *7 472-9 473 -6 The greatest discrepancy is in the case of band 10 , and this is easily explained when we consider the variation of the position of the maximum intensity of the band to which I have previously drawn attention . !
At different temperatures the position of the brightest part of the band changes , and in Angstrom 's measure of the carbon fluting this was not taken into account .
In addition to these principal bands , Duner mapped seven secondary bands .
In the Bakerian Lecture , I stated that " there is evidence that some of the absorption is produced by substances which remain in the atmosphere during the next stage , that of Group VII ( dark bodies ) .
This probability is based upon the fact that some of the bands are apparently coincident with bands in the telluric spectrum as mapped by Brewster , Angstrom , Smyth , and others."S * As in former papers , the term " high temperature , " as used here , is only relative , and refers to the spectrum of carbon which is seen in the electric arc , Bunsen burner , or vacuum tube under certain conditions .
The spectrum of carbon at a still higher temperature consists of lines .

S Note ( added1899 ; .\#151 ; Although my subdivision of the group into species , ma:le ten years ago , is based in part upon the secondary bands , it is not materially affected by the new information as to the nature of these bands , since , as cooling goes on , low temperature metallic lines would become more prominent relatively , just as we might have expected the secondary bands to become stronger on the supposition that they had the same origin as the telluric bands .

Specific differences in the Spectra .
In considering the question of variations of spectra with temperature in these stars , the importance of taking differences of magnitude into account must not be lost sight of .
A general examination of Duner 's observations indicates that there are two marked differences in the spectra of the different stars .
( 1 ) Some of them give secondary bands , whilst in others they are absent .
( 2 ) Some of them have longer continuous spectra than others , as indicated by the number of " zones " visible .
If the continuous spectrum extends far enough towards the violet , the three dark flutings of carbon will divide the spectrum into four bright zones .
If it does not extend beyond the most refrangible of the flutings ( A47 3 ) only three zones will be visible , and the continuous spectrum will appear to end sharply at wave-length 473 .
In one case it does not extend beyond the fluting at A517 , and then only two zones are visible .
These differences might evidently depend upon differences of magnitude of the stars concerned , but a detailed examination of the observations shows that some of the differences do not depend upon brightness .
If we consider the visibility of the secondary bands according to Duner , we have the following result : \#151 ; No , of band .
Wave-length .
Magnitude of stars in which it is seen .
Magnitude of stars in which it is not seen .
i 656-0 5 -4\#151 ; 6 -2 6-0\#151 ; 9-5 2 621 o 5-4\#151 ; 8-1 6-0\#151 ; 9-5 3 604-8 5 -4\#151 ; 8 -1 6-0-9 -5 4 589 -8 5 4\#151 ; 8-5 6-6-95 5 576-0 5-4-8-1 7-5-9 5 7 551-0 5-4\#151 ; 6-5 6 0\#151 ; 9 -5 8 528-3 5-4\#151 ; 7-0 6 -0\#151 ; 9 *5 t This table shows that the visibility of the secondary bands is not altogether dependent upon the magnitudes of the stars observed .
Thus the bands 2 and 3 are seen in some of the stars of the group as low as magnitude 8T , whilst they are absent from some of the stars of the sixth magnitude .
If we consider the question of the length of the continuous spectrum , we have the following result , the maximum number of zones referring to the longest continuous spectrum :\#171 ; \#151 ; The Piscian Stars .
Number of zones .
which they are seen .
5 -5\#151 ; 8 -2 6 -0\#151 ; 9 -5 8 *0\#151 ; 9 *0 Here , again , the visibility of the zones does not depend altogether Up0n the magnitude .
There are stars as bright as the sixth magnitude which only give three zones , whilst some as low as 8-2 give four .
Duner refers to this difference as follows:\#151 ; " Puis l'intensite de la luraiere des zones brillantes peut varier considerablement chez les etoiles de la meme grandeur .
Dans les etoiles d'un rouge fonce , la zone ultra-bleue est extremement faible en comparison avec la meme zone dans les etoiles rouge jaune ; et chez les etoiles faibles , cette zone est tout-a-fait invisible , et meme la zone bleue est tres difficile a voir si else sont tres rouge."* Another important difference is the variation in the intensity of the citron band of carbon ( band 6 ) as compared with the other bands .
Duner also refers to this point ( p. 10 ) as follows " Mais aussi la band principal a la longueur d'onde 563 est d'une opacite tres variee .
Chez certaines etoiles , elle est presque aussi foncee que les deux autres bands principales ; mais dans certains spectres elle est assez faible , et semble , probablement a cause de cela , etre beaucoup moins large que les bands aux longueurs d'onde 5i6 et 473 .
Celles-ci , et surtout la premiere d'entre else , sont toujours tres fortes et tres larges , et forment le caraetere le plus prononce de ces spectres .
A discussion of the observations shows that this variation is independent of the magnitudes of the stars .
Thus we find that the band is dark in some stars with magnitudes varying from 5*4 to 8'0 .
It is interesting to note that this band , as I have shown , is also the one most subject to variations in the spectra of comets.t It thus appears that there are distinct differences in the spectra , quite independent of the difficulties in recording the details .
It will be clear that the stars with the longest spectra , characterised by four " zones , " must be placed above those with shorter spectrq on the temperature curve .
As none of the stars , however , show more than four zones and only one less than three , this alone does not discriminate sufficiently between the different species , and we have therefore to look to the variations in the carbon flutings and secondary bands for finer sub-division .

In the last stages of all , before final extinction , the stars will be so feeble that the details of their spectra cannot be recorded ; so that the expected phenomena , on following out continuity of changes , cannot be checked by direct observation .
The sequence of changes which we should expect to occur would be :\#151 ; ( 1 ) The gradual darkening of the carbon flutings and subsequent paling as the continuous spectrum becomes weaker .
( 2 ) The gradual fading out of those solar lines which do not persist as low as flame temperature .
( 3 ) The gradual increase in the intensity of absorption lines or bands representative of low temperature .

The remaining stars of the group observed by Duner are not described with sufficient detail to enable them to be included in the foregoing classification .
The Piscian Stars .
The variations from one species to another are shown in the accompanying map ( p. 136 ) , which also indicates the connection with stars of the group which precedes it , and suggests a later Species 8 , not yet I identified by observation .
Owing to the difficulties attending the observations , the actual I appearances of the secondary bands are not quite so regular as is I shown in ' the map .
The Colours of the Piscian Stars .
The classification arrived at was next tested by reference to the colour phenomena .
Dun4r employs two methods of indicating the colours of the stars , which he has specially observed\#151 ; first , by means of initial letters , and second , by means of numbers , such that 10 = blood red .
Thus : Rj = rouge jaune .
Rrj = rouge jaune fonce .
Rrrj = presque rouge absolve .
The numbers show a fair agreement with the letters employed , if we omit one Rrj star , which is given the number 9'3 .
The following table compares the colour numbers corresponding to the initial letters:\#151 ; Initial letters .

successive species , which is exactly what we should expect if these species truly represent the effect of gradual cooling . .
Variability of Piseian Stars .
Of the fifty-five stars in Dundr 's list , ten exhibit fluctuations in brilliancy .
On the whole the light changes are not so great as in the stars of Group II , and the periods tend to greater length .
As to the cause of variability , the increase of light at maximum may be due , as I suggested in 1890 , * to the light added by bodies of a cometary character when tjiey reach periastron , the increase of luminosity being produced by tidal action , as in the case of comets in our own solar system .
If there be any truth in this idea , it seems probable that the added light of the comet at maximum , which would give a spectrum consisting of bright carbon flutings , would produce a paling of the carbon absorption flutings .
As in the variables of the Antarian group , which are uncondensed swarms , and where , on the meteoritic hypothesis , the increased light at maximum is produced by the collision of a revolving swarm at periastron , irregularity is a natural consequence of the revolution of more than one secondary body .
Addendum .
Recent Observations .
The Kensington observations were made chiefly during 1894 and 1895 , with special reference to the lines involved .
The stars selected for observation were 132 Schjellerup , 152 Schjellerup , 115 Schjellerup , and 19 Piscium .
The 3-foot reflector was used .
In addition to the carbon bands , numerous lines were seen without much difficulty , but only the more prominent ones could be satisfactorily measured .
Among the lines recorded in 132 Schj .
were H/ 3 , the E line of iron at 5269 , and a group of lines near A. 5380 .
In 115 Schjellerup additional lines were measured near 5005 , 5762 , and 5429 , and the presence of H/ 8 was again determined by comparison with a hydrogen vacuum tube .
In 19 Piscium numerous lines were observed , among them being D and F. No suspicion of bright lines was entertained during these observations .
Attempts to photograph the spectra were not sufficiently successful to help matters .
In 1898 , Dr. McClean published photographs of the spectra of 19 Piscium and 152 Schjellerup , t showing that these stars have a line spectrum similar to a Tauri , in addition to the well-marked bands * ' Nature , ' vol. 42 , pp. 419 , 548 .

of carbon .
This was the information wanted , but more recently Professor Hale has published photographs of the spectra of 280 Schi 273 Schj .
( 19 Piscium ) , 132 Schj .
( U Hydrse ) , and 152 Schj .
, taken with the aid of the Yerke 's telescope at Chicago , and showing a wealth of fine detail.* The dark line spectrum is very marked , and the details of the carbon bands themselves are clearly revealed .
Besides these , there are certain bright places in the spectrum which Professor Hale has been led to believe are true bright lines , and he mentions that Professor Keeler has arrived at the same conclusion as a result of his observations with the Lick refractor .
Dun^r appears to have continued his observations of this group of stars after his removal from Lund to Upsala , and he states that with the Upsala refractor he was able to see more detail , and could detect without difficulty bright lines in the spectra of various stars of the group.f The Question of Bright Lines .
As I have already pointed out , Professors Hale , Keeler , and Duner consider that there are bright lines in some of these spectra , but I must confess that the published photographs do not convince me upon this point .
In the plate which accompanies Professor Hale 's paper of April , 1899 , | the spectra of four stars are shown , namely , 280 Schj .
, 273 Schj .
, 132 Schj .
, and 152 Schj .
A study of these photographs shows that the supposed bright lines are involved in the carbon absorption bands in the yellow green , and occur where there is reduced absorption , on the less refrangible sides of the dark flutings .
This at once led me to suppose that they could not be real bright lines , but simply places in the continuous spectrum where there is least absorption .
These supposed bright lines are most marked in 152 Schj .
, and there is no suggestion of them in 280 Schj .
, while I think few would be disposed to suggest their presence in 273 Schj .
and 132 Schj .
without having 152 Schj .
as a guide .
Nevertheless , in these intermediate stars there are certainly bright places corresponding in position with the " bright lines " in 152 Schj .
, the principal one being at A 5592 .
So far as appearances go , the greater apparent intensity of the bright line in 152 Schj .
appears to be due to the introduction of a strong absorption line on the less refrangible side .
In another paperS Professor Hale reproduces photographs of 152 Schj .
in which the contrast has been increased by photographic means , so that the whole spectrum appears to consist of bright lines , rather than dark ones .

The Piscian Stars .
In favour of the real existence of bright lines , Professor Hale points out that the contrast between the line and the continuous spectrum increased rather than diminished when dispersion was increased , and that there was no decrease in contrast as the slit was widened .
The .
question , however , is so complicated by the presence of the carbon fluting and other absorptions , that I shall not follow Professor Hale in his definite conclusions as to bright lines upon these grounds .
Before we can admit the certain presence of bright lines in 152 Schi .
, we must consider whether similar appearances occur in other stars where bright lines have not been previously suspected .
As a matter of fact , in the photographic spectra of Tauri , fi Andromedse , and aOrionis , which I published in 1893 , * the spectra might , so far as mere appearance goes , be regarded as containing both bright and dark lines , some of the bright spaces between obvious dark lines being very conspicuous ; the same remark applies in a less degree to the spectrum of Arcturus which I published at the same time .
But we find a complete explanation of these spectra if we regard them as consisting of dark lines , whereas if we take the bright spaces we cannot match them at all .
We do not hesitate in these cases to treat the spectra as consisting of dark lines only , the apparent bright lines being simply spaces between dark ones .
I find that practically in all dark line spectra where the lines are from some cause or other thick , the intervals between them are apt to appear as bright lines , and this brightness can readily be intensified by purely photographic processes .
I have accordingly thought it unnecessary to modify the division into species on account of the supposed presence in some of them of bright lines .
If the presence of bright lines be eventually established , may they not indicate that we are observing the effects of volcanic gases floating over a " photosphere " which has attained the consistency of lava ?
Bearing on the Meteor Hypothesis .
The photographs taken by McClean and Hale have now sufficiently shown that there is much in common between the line spectra of the Antarian and Piscian stars .
This indicates that there is a practical equality of mean temperature in the reversing layers of the two groups , but we find a very great difference in the conditions as to carbon ; while carbon is undoubtedly absorbing in the Piscian stars , it is certainly not absorbing in the Antarian , and there is in fact strong evidence that it is radiating , t We cannot imagine different kinds of stars of the same temperature as representing the .same stage in any evolutionary scheme , so that the * ' Phil.

Prof. Karl Pearson .
separation of the two groups which I suggested in 1887 is fully justified by the recent work to which I have referred .
By putting the two groups on the same level of temperature , but on opposite sides of the temperature curve , as in the evolutionary order forming part of the meteoritic hypothesis , the differences are fully explained .
It will be seen that this work carries us a step beyond that with which I have recently been engaged in connection with the hotter stars .
General Conclusions .
( 1 ) The undoubted presence of dark carbon flutings in the solar spectrum , including that near b , and of solar lines in the Piscian stars , indicates that the Piscian stars are next in order of development to the Arcturian stars .
( 2 ) The stars observed by Dun^r may be divided into seven species , beginning with the hottest and ending with the coolest stars .
( 3 ) The reported presence of bright lines in the Piscian stars must be received , with caution , as similar evidence of bright lines might be adduced in the case of other classes of stars in which the spectrum is fully explained by dark lines alone .
( 4 ) The redness of the stars increases as we pass from the earlier to the later species of the group .
( 5 ) The variability in this group is less marked than in the Anta-rian stars , and may perhaps be accounted for by the revolution of secondary bodies of the nature of comets round the stars themselves .
( 6 ) The place on the temperature curve assigned to these stars on the meteoritic hypothesis is fully confirmed by the more detailed inquiry , and the hypothesis is thereby strengthened .
I am indebted to Mr. Fowler for assistance in the determination of the species and the construction of the map ten years ago , and for additional assistance in discussing the recent work .
I have also to express my thanks to Mr. Shackleton for a detailed examination of the recent photographs .
