] After adverting to the circumstances upon which the generally adopted opinion is founded , that the tides meet between Dungeness Point and Rye Harbour , Captain Anderson describes the peculiarity of the Channel at that point , and its very sudden contraction between Dungeness and Cape D'Alpree , and between the South Foreland and Calais Point ; so that the western tide meets with a resistance to its course at Dungeness and Cape D'Alpr6e ; where , from the passage being insufficient to discharge the water brought from the westward , it must accumulate until it deepens and widens the Chan 11+ nel , so as to become adequate to the discharge of the water .
The peculiarities of the rise and fall of the tides at adjacent places , is referred by the aiuthor principally to the accumulation that takes place in these basins .
That the tides do not meet at Dungeness in a line across the Channel , is further proved by the absence of that violent concussion of water which in such a case would ensue ; the fact being , that the formation of the coast by gradually altering the course of the tide between the South Foreland and buoy of the Nor , from E.N.E. to W.N.W. within the stream of the Goodwin Sands , occasions a gentle blending of the waters , so that there is only a strong eddy about the Kentish Knock , and a foamy rippling where they meet and proceed onwards together .
