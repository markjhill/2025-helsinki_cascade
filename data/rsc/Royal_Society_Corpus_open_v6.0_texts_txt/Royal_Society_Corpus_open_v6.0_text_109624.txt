Account of a Discovery of native Minium .
In a Letter from James Smithson , Esq. F.R.S. to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , K.B. P.R.S. Read April 24 , 1806 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1806 , p. 267 .
] The minium here described by Mr. Smithson was found disseminated in a compact carbonate of zinc .
Its general appearance was pulverulent ; but when a lens was used , it showed , in some places , a flaky and crystalline texture .
Its colour was the same as that of factitious minium : when gently heated by the blowpipe it became more obscure , but returned , upon cooling , to its original colour .
By a stronger heat it melted into litharge ; and , upon charcoal , was reduced to lead .
In dilute nitric acid it assumed a coffee-colour ; and on the addition of a little sugar , this brown calx was dissolved , producing a colourless solution .
Upon being put into muriatic acid , with a little leaf-gold , the gold was soon entirely dissolved .
When it was enclosed in a small bottle with muriatic acid , and a small piece of turnsole paper was fixed to the cork , the paper in a short time entirely lost its blue colour , and became white .
Even a slip of common blue paper , whose colouring matter is indigo , when placed in the above situation , underwent the same change .
This native minium , Mr. Smithson says , seems to be produced by the decay of galena , which he suspects to be itself a secondary production , arising from the metallization of white carbonate of lead by hepatic gas .
This , our author says , appears evident in a specimen which he means to send to Mr. Greville .
In one part of this specimen there is a cluster of large crystals ; one of which , upon being broken , was found to be converted into minium , to a considerable thickness , while its centre was still galena .
Mr. Smithson does not say where this native minium was found ; but his letter is dated from Cassell in Hesse .
