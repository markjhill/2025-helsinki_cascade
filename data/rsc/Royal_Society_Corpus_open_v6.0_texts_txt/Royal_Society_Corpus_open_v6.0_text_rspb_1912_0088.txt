) In earlier papers of this series we have shown that cholesterol is never excreted in the normal faeces of herbivorous animals such as horses , cattle , sheep , and rabbits .
In the case of carnivora such as dogs and cats , provided the body weight remains constant , the cholesterol excreted in the faeces can be all accounted for by that naturally ingested with the food .
Klein in his experiments also arrived at a similar conclusion .
Evidence was also brought forward which rendered probable the view that , in herbivora , at any rate , cholesterol is a substance which is strictly conserved in the animal economy , that when the destruction of the red blood corpuscles and possibly other cells takes place in the liver , their cholesterol is excreted in the bile , and that the cholesterol of the bile is re-absorbed in the intestine along with the bile salts , finding its way into the blood stream to be used in cell anabolism ; \#171 ; further , that any waste of cholesterol might be made up from that taken in with the food .
This latter process would be limited in herbivorous animals by the fact that their normal food does not contain cholesterol , but isomeric substances such as phytosterol , which have to be converted into cholesterol before utilisation , and in carnivorous animals by the partial , or even complete , change of cholesterol into coprosterol which takes place under certain dietetic conditions .
In man , under normal conditions , cholesterol is never excreted as such in the faeces , but always in the form of coprosterol .
It seemed therefore desirable to estimate the amounts of coprosterol found in the faeces of man under various dietetic conditions .
The opportunity of making such investigations was very kindly afforded us by Dr. R. H. A. Plimmer , who handed over to us the dried faeces collected during a series of experiments carried out in the Physiological Institute , University College , London , and published in the 'Journal of Physiology , ' August 26 , 1909 , under the title of " A Metabolism Experiment , with Special Reference to the Origin of Uric Acid , " by R. H. Aders Plimmer , Maxwell Dick , and Charles C. Lieb .
The subject of the experiment was a healthy man , aged 39 .

Origin and [ Sept. 3 , diets selected were chosen so that each yielded 110 grm. protein , 240 grm. carbohydrate , and 100 grm. fat per diem .
The carbohydrate and* fat constituents consisted of potato and butter , and the protein constituents of ( 1 ) beefsteak , ( 2 ) egg-white , or ( 3 ) herring-roe .
The experiment was commenced with an ordinary mixed diet for one week .
After this the beefsteak diet was administered , and this was followed by the egg-white .
After one week the subject unfortunately suffered from an attack of influenza , so that the experiment had to be discontinued for about 10 days , though analysis of urine was continued except for a period of four days .
The egg-white diet was then taken for a period of 35 days .
The herring-roe diet concluded the experiment , but this diet was taken only for three days owing to its bad effect on the patient .
The fgeces in this last period were not kept separate , but included with those obtained during the 35 days of egg-white diet .
For further details as to the experiment the reader is referred to the original paper .
Cholesterol Contents of Various Diets .
The cholesterol content of the constituents of the various diets was determined by the digitonin method in the usual manner .

500 grm. Potato ... ... ... ... ... . .
800 " Butter ... ... ... ... ... . .
100 " Sugar ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
80 " Meat , according to our own observations and those of others , may be taken as containing not less than 0-0685 per cent , of cholesterol\#151 ; free and combined .
Butter , according to Magnus-Levy , contains 0-19 per cent. A sample of " best dairy butter " obtained from Harrods ' Stores was found , by the digitonin method , to contain 01744 per cent , of cholesterol\#151 ; free and combined .
The total cholesterol ingested in Diet I would , therefore , be at least 0-3425 + 0-1744 = 0'5169 grm. per diem .

The total cholesterol ingested was , therefore , 0-227 grm. per diem .

The total cholesterol ingested was , therefore , 2'975 + 0-227 = 3-202 grm. per diem .
Treatment of the Fceces .
The faeces were supplied to us in a dry , finely powdered condition .
Those from each series were thoroughly extracted with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus , and the fatty matter in the ethereal solution saponified with sodium ethylate .
After separating the soap , the ethereal solution was thoroughly washed with water and evaporated to dryness .
From the residues it was found possible to isolate a quantity of pure coprosterol by fractional crystallisation from alcohol .
The mother-liquors were evaporated to dryness , and the residual coprosterol benzoated by means of benzoyl chloride in pyridine solution .
The faeces from Series I , III , and IY , containing an excessive amount of oily impurity , rendered the isolation of pure coprosterol benzoate so difficult that the residues were further treated with digitonin , and in this way an amount of digitonin coprosteride was obtained .
In order to be certain that the compound so formed was none other than the coprosteride , we recovered the coprosterol in combination by means of the xylene method .
Results of Analysis .
Series I.\#151 ; In this series the subject was fed on an ordinary mixed diet for seven days .
Five stools were passed , and yielded 167'7 grm. of dry material .
The patient 's weight was practically constant , varying from day to day from 75'8 to 76-2 kgrrn.\#151 ; average 75'99 .
The faeces yielded on extraction 6-7445 grm. of unsaponifiable matter , from which 41669 grm. of coprosterol were obtained .
This would correspond to a yield of 0 595 grm. per day .
This daily output corresponds very closely to that found in the cases of one of us and another colleague on liberal diet from observations extending over a year .
Faeces from a public latrine , however , yielded a smaller quantity .
Series II.\#151 ; The subject was then fed for seven days on Diet I. His average weight was 75-3 kgrm .
, and varied on six of the days as follows : 76 , 75'3 , 75'3 , 75 , 75 , 75'6 .
Four stools were passed , corresponding to * * Messrs. Ellis and Gardner .

Sories III .
Then followed seven days on Diet II .
During this period the patient was sickening for an attack of influenza .
His weight varied as follows : 75 , 74-6 , 74*2 , 74-3 , 74*3 , 74*2\#151 ; average 74-4 kgrm .
The average loss in weight from the average of the previous period was thus 900 grm. , or an actual loss during the week of 800 grm. Three stools were passed , containing 118 grm. of solid matter .
This yielded 3'9605 grm. unsaponifiable matter , from which were obtained 2-6505 grm. of coprosterol .
The balance sheet works out as follows:\#151 ; Total cholesterol ingested ... .

0-1519 If we reckon the loss in weight as due to fat and protein tissues the loss of cholesterol in this way would be from 045 to 0-8 grm. , which would largely account for the excess excreted over intake .
Series IV.\#151 ; During the next five days the patient suffered from influenza .
Two meals of Diet II were taken and 35 grm. of dry faeces were obtained .
The weights of the patient were as follows :\#151 ; 74-2 , 72-6 , 73-2 , average 73-3 .
The faeces excreted during the first four days yielded 1*7638 grm. of unsaponifiable matter , from which 1-3109 grm. of coprosterol was obtained .

, so that about 1 grm. of cholesterol might be accounted for in this manner , and the excess of output over intake explained .
Series V.\#151 ; During recovery from illness the patient was fed for six days on an ordinary mixed diet , after which the experiment was continued .
He was fed for 33 days on Diet II , with addition of various salts , for one day on 100 grm. egg-white and 250 grm. boiled-out meat , for another day on 250 grm. of boiled-out meat , and for three days on a total of 400 grm. egg-white + 1250 grm. herring-roe .

17 The daily weights of the patient showed a steady decrease during this long period\#151 ; from 73*8 to 70*7 kgrm.\#151 ; a total loss of 3T kgrm .
The total weight of dry fasces passed during the period was 665 grm. This yielded 202195 grm. of unsaponifiable matter , from which 14*7324 grm. of coprosterol were obtained .

0*3877 Ditto intake per diem ... ... 0*393 Excess of intake over output per diem , 0*0053 .
The loss in weight during this experiment amounts to about 82 grm. per diem .
This is considerably less than the loss in Series III and IY , which is about 114 grm. and 250 grm. per diem respectively ; there must , therefore , have been an absorption of cholesterol going on in the intestines during the period .
Conclusion .
It would appear from these experiments that in man , as in the case of other animals , the excretion of cholesterol in the faeces can be accounted for by that taken in with the food , provided that the body weight remains constant .
If , however , a rapid loss in weight takes place , as in illness , the output of cholesterol exceeds the intake .
Further work will , however , be necessary before this view can be regarded as fully established .
Note on the Sterol Contents of Babbit Faeces.\#151 ; In Part VIII of this series of papers we described an experiment in wdiich we succeeded in isolating cholesterol by the digitonin method from the faeces of a rabbit which had been fed on extracted bran , but into the peritoneal cavity of which olive oil had been injected .
The animal in question had lost nearly a third of its weight during the experiment .
In consequence of this result it was thought desirable to submit the faeces of rabbits fed on extracted bran , but which were not losing weight , to a more careful examination .
For this purpose four rabbits were fed for about ten days on bran which had previously been roughly extracted with ether .
The animals remained during the experiment perfectly constant in weight .
About 1200 grm. of air-dried faeces were obtained .
These faeces were extracted with ether and treated in the manner already described , and yielded about 3 grm. of unsaponifiable matter in the form of a stiff oil .
This oil was dissolved in alcohol and mixed with excess of digitonin in alcoholic solution .
The precipitate was filtered and washed with ether to get rid of oily matter , and repeatedly boiled out with methyl alcohol , in which it proved very insoluble .
The oily matter separated from the compound did not give any sterol colour reaction in VOL. lxxxvi.\#151 ; b. c 18 Origin and Destiny of Cholesterol in the Animal Organism .
chloroform solution with acetic anhydride and sulphuric acid .
The digitonin precipitate , which the above treatment had not freed from traces of some fluorescent colouring matter , was finely powdered and decomposed by heating in xylene vapour .
The clear xylene solution on evaporation gave a yellow , crystalline , oily solid .
This was purified by repeated crystallisation from dilute alcohol , from which it separated when pure in microscopic hexagonal plates .
It melted at 136'-137 ' C. and gave the usual sterol colour tests .
The acetate , made in the usual manner with sodium acetate and acetic anhydride , crystallised from alcohol in glistening leaves .
It was less soluble in alcohol than the original substance .
It melted at 135'-136 ' C. , but if heated very slowly , at about 130 ' C. , the benzoate , made by the action of benzoyl chloride in pyridin solution , crystallised readily from strong alcohol , in which it was sparingly soluble .
It melted at 142 ' C. to a clear liquid , which on cooling gave at the moment of solidification a brilliant green play of colours , gradually changing to brown .
This substance was one of the phytosterols of the bran , which had not been eliminated in the rough extraction with ether .
The same substance was obtained by Doree and Gardner from horse dung .
No trace of cholesterol was discovered .
This bears out our previous conclusion that cholesterol is not found in the normal faeces of herbivorous animals .
