Consideration of various Points of Analysis .
By John F. W. Herschel , Esq. F.R.S. Read May 19 , 1814 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1814 , p. 440 .
] This paper is divided into four sections , the first of which treats of the calculus of generative functions , and relates solely to characteristic notation , and to the method of separating the symbols of operation from those of quantity .
The second relates to logarithmic transcendants , with a variety of remarkable results deduced from them .
The third relates to functional equations .
The fourth to differential equations of the first degree .
But the whole of this paper was of a nature not adapted for public reading .
