, " Report of the general process adopted in Graduating and Comparing the Standard Meteorological Instruments for the Kew Observatory .
" By Mr. John Welsh .
Communicated by Col. Sabine on the part of the Committee of Recommendations of the Government Grant .
Received May 6 , 1852 .
In offering to the Committee a short statement of the progress made at the Kew Observatory in the construction and verification of thermometers , I shall first describe generally the method pursued in the graduation of standard instruments .
The plan of operations hitherto adopted has been that proposed by M. Regnault , and consists essentially of the following steps:1st .
Calibration of the tube : 2nd .
Graduation of the scale : and 3rd .
The determination of the scale coefficients .
1 .
Calibration.-A tube having been selected as being tolerably free from all visible defects , a short column of mercury , generally less than one inch in length , is introduced .
The tube is then attached to the frame of Perreaux 's dividing-engine , and by means of flexible tubing is put in connection at both ends with india-rubber bags , the pressure upon which can be regulated by means of screws .
The mercury is then brought to the part of the tube where the graduation is proposed to commence .
The cutting-frame of the engine carries also a small microscope with cross wires in its focus ; on turning the dividing-screw , the microscope-wire is brought to coincide with the first end of the mercury , and the screw is then turned forward until the wire reaches the second end ; the length of the column is thus given in revolutions of the screw .
By means of the india-rubber bags , the mercury is made to move along the tube until the first end coincides again with the microscope-wire ; the length of the column is again measured , and the mercury again moved forward ; the same process being repeated until the column has been measured for each length of itself through the whole extent of the proposed scale .
Permanent marks are made on the glass at the points of commencement and ending of the calibration .
If the progress of the numbers shows any considerable irregularity in the tube , and as a verification of the first set of measures , it is well to repeat the calibration , commencing in this case at a point one-half the length of the column in advance of the original starting-point .
A series of measures interpolated from the two sets may then be adopted .
Some experience is necessary in order to bring with facility the end of the mercury exactly to the wire of the microscope ; but when care is taken to use very pure mercury and clean tubes , the operation can generally , after a little trouble , be accomplished with much accuracy .
M. Regnault , I believe , recommends that the motion of the mercury should be regulated by the breath , a drying substance being interposed to prevent moisture entering the tube .
This method was employed for some of the first instruments made at Kew , but was abandoned in favour of the elastic bags .
2 .
Graduation.-The measured lengths of the column of mercury in its successive steps along the tube correspond to equal volumes .
Assuming that the calibre of the tube does not vary throughout the small length of the calibrating column , if we divide the spaces occupied successively by the mercury into an equal number of parts , it is evident that the divisions will represent the same capacity , although they may be of very different lengths .
Before making the tube into a thermometer , the divisions of the scale may be verified by introducing a longer column of mercury , and examining whether the column occupies an equal number of divisions in different parts of the scale .
If there should be any irregularity , a table of corrections may readily be formed .
It will generally be found , however , that if the operations have been performed with care , and the tube is not very faulty , no correction will be necessary .
The divisions are cut with a fine needle-point upon a coating of engravers ' varnish , and afterwards etched with fluoric acid .
The required dimensions of the bulb may be found approximately by weighing a measured length of the mercurial column , and from the known expansion of mercury and its specific gravity computing the capacity of the bulb .
3 .
Determination of the scale coefficient.-The thermometer having been filled with mercury , we have an instrument the divisions of whose scale represent equal increments of the volume of the fluid , but are entirely of an arbitrary value .
If now we determine the points of the scale at which the mercury stands in freezing and boiling water , we can immediately convert the arbitrary scale-readings into degrees of the ordinary scales of temperature .
If a be the scalereading for the freezing-point , and b that for the boiling-point , the temperature by Fahrenheit 's scale corresponding to any reading n=(-a ) 180 +32 .
The freezing-point is determined by placing the thermometer in finely-pounded ice , from which the water is drained off as it melts .
The boiling-point is ascertained by the form of apparatus employed by M. Regnault ; the temperature observed is that of steam , whose elasticity is the same as that of the atmosphere .
A small siphon water-gauge communicating with the interior of the vessel gives notice to the observer when the ebullition is being carried on too rapidly .
The steam is generated from distilled water .
The height of the barometer is observed at the time of the experiment , and the correction to a uniform height of 30 inches ( reduced to 32 ?
) is found from Regnault 's table .
In determining the fixed points , the stems of the thermometers are kept vertical ; if the subsequent comparisons with other instruments are made in the same position , no error will arise from the expansion of the bulb caused by the pressure of the column of mercury .
If , however , the thermometers are intended to be used in any other than a vertical position , it becomes necessary to determine the fixed points also in a horizontal position .
In accordance with the plan here sketched , fifteen thermometers have been completed with arbitrary scales .
About thirty more tubes have been calibrated , and the bulbs attached and filled , but the scales not yet divided .
The principal object in graduating the tube with an arbitrary scale is the convenience it affords of testing the divisions before it is converted into a thermometer .
It is now proposed to divide the scale at once into Fahrenheit degrees after the thermometer has been made , and to test the accuracy of the divisions afterwards by detaching a portion of the mercurial column and making it move along the tube .
If the scale should not then be found correct , a table of its errors can be formed and furnished with the instrument , or the thermometer rejected .
The scales of these thirty thermometers have not yet been proceeded with , as it is desirable , before doing so , to allow the freezing-point to have attained a permanent position .
A few divisions have been cut on the tubes near the freezing-point , and the reading with referenice to this short arbitrary scale taken from time to time in melting ice .
The period elapsed since the construction of the thermometers has been too short to afford as yet much information as to the probable constancy of the freezing-points .
They have , however , already shown generally a tendency to rise , in some cases to the extent of nearly 0 ?
'3 Fahr. , but in most of them it does not yet exceed 0 ?
'1 or 0 ?
'2 .
Another peculiarity in connection with the freezing-point has shown itself in almost all the thermometers yet tried .
After a thermometer has been exposed for some weeks to the ordinary temperature of the air , if its freezing-point be ascertained , and it be then suddenly exposed for a short time to the temperature of boilingwater , andaain immediately placed in ice , it'-is fdund that the latrdeter determination of the freezing-point wil be lower than the -former by a very appreciable amount , generally between i0 ? ?
1 'and 0 ?
'2 Fahr. The freezing-point does not recover its previous p-osition for some time , probably two or three weeks .
' This peculiar ; displacement of the freezing-point has been found to:take place also in the case of a standard by Triought6n and Simms ' belonging to the Royal Society .
The freezing-point of this:instrument , before being raised to the temperature of boiling water , was 32-25 , afterwards it had fallen to 32'15 .
This displacement of the freezing-point:'has been remarked by Mr. Sheepshanks in the course of his experiments on standard thermometers* .
From the experiments now in progress , it is to be hoped that , after a time , some approximation may be made to the laws of these perplexing phenomena .
The apparatus employed for comparing the indications of different thermometers , consists of a cylindrical glass vase 15 inches deep and 81 inches in diameter , -a stand for supporting the thermometers under comparison , and a means of agitating the water in such away as completely to assimilate the temperiture throughoutL the vessel .
The stand for the thermometer is a vertical rod , supported by a small tripod resting on the bottom .
of the vase .
The thermometers are suspended from hooks sliding on this rod , and adjustable to any height ; they are arranged , with their : bulbs at the *same height in a circle 3 inches diameter round the rod , and kept fixed with sufficient firmness below by being strapped with -elastic bands against a projecting six-rayed frame attached to , the supporting rod .
Six thermometers of almost any form and length can thus be compared at once .
The agitator is a flat ring of tinned iron , about'2 inches broad , fitting easily within the vase , and connected by four light rods with a similar ring at top , which serves as a handle .
A packing of india-rubber is placed on the outer rim of the plunger to prevent jarring against the glass .
The flat tin ring is cut half across at several places , and the corners bent in various ways , so that when moved upwards and downwards the water is driven in all directions .
The dimensions of the agitator are so arranged , that no part of it can possibly touch the thermometers when in operation .
The vase , containing water , the stand with thermometers , and the agitator , are mounted upon a wooden revolving stand .
The depth of water in the vase is always sufficient to include the whole of the column of mercury , the scales being observed through the water .
In taking the observations , the observer , after agitating the water briskly for some time , turns the revolving stand till each thermometer is brought successively opposite to his eye , reading off the scales as quickly as possible to an assistant , who writes down the numbers .
Proceeding in this way , I find that six thermometers can be read off and recorded easily in 20 seconds .
It is of course desirable to make more than one set of readings for each temperature ; and in order to avoid as much as possible the changes which may occur during the reading off , it is well to reverse the order of observing the instruments , that is , to read them alternately in the order one to six , and six to one .
The following table contains the results of comparisons of six thermometers , and will show the accuracy which may be obtained by the method of comparison just described ; it will also exhibit the accordance in the indications of instruments graduated according to Regnault 's process .
Each result is the mean of.six comparisons .
No optical assistance was used in reading off the scales .
The freezing-points of all the instruments were determined on the same day , after the comparisons were made .

" Fastre No. 231 ( Regnault ) " is a standard by Fastr6 of Paris , also graduated on the stem with an arbitrary scale according to Regnault 's process .
This instrument was examined and approved by M. Regnault ; the determination by him of the scale coefficient agreed closely with that afterwards made at Kew .
The bulb is cylindrical , about 1 inch long and inch diameter .

" Newman ( Makerstoun ) " is the instrument which was supplied to the Makerstoun Observatory as a standard , and to whose indications the results of the temperature observations made there since 1841 have been ( ' corrected .
" It was , at my suggestion , sent to Kew by Sir Thomas Brisbane for comparison with our standards .
" Troughton and Simms ( Royal Society ) " is a standard belonging to the Royal Society .
As its scale extends to above 212 , its boiling-point was examined in the same apparatus employed for the Kew standards , its brass scale remaining attached to the tube .
It was found to read 212 ?
'7 when the barometer:reduced to 32 ?
, stood at 30'136 inches .
The errors of a thermometer which has been already carefully examinedbetween 32 ?
and about 100 ?
, may be obtained with considerable accuracy for temperatures below 32 ?
, without using a freezing mixture , by the following process .
Detach from the column of mercury a portion which will occupy about.40 or 50 degrees of the scale : bring this column within the known part of the scale .
Let a , b be the readings at the upper and lower ends respectively ; a , / 3 the index errors at these points as determined by comparison with a standard .
Move the column until its lower end coincides with some degree below 32 ?
, the upper end being within the compared portion of the scale .
Let c , d be the scale-readings for the upper and lower ends in the new position , y being the scale error corresponding to c. The error of the scale at d will then be d-{- , { -- ) } .
The true length of the detached column may be obtained with increased accuracy by taking a mean of several measures within the known part of the scale .
This method was adopted for " Newman ( Makerstoun ) " and " Troughton and Simms ( Royal Society ) , " and the following errors obtained : Newman ( Makerstoun ) .
