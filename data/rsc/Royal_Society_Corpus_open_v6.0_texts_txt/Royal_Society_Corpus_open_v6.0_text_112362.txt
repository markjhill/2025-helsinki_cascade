( Abstract .
) In accordance with the instructions he had received from the Managing Directors of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company , Captain Murray made all observations that were possible of the eclipse of the 18th August ; but the high northern latitude of the ship 's ( ' Ellora ' ) position at the time precluded the possibility of observing any remarkable phenomenon , the obscuration of the sun being comparatively slight .
