A paper was read , " On recrossed Vision ; being the Description of a distinct Tribe of ocular Phenomena , supplementary to a Rationale of the Laws of cerebral Vision , recently published .
" By John Fearn , Esq. Communicated by Captain John Grover , F.R.S. The phenomena described in this paper , and which the author designates those of recrossed vision , are cases in which objects placed between and very near the eye , such as the two sides of the nose , appear on opposite sides of the sphere of vision : the object on the right side of the nose being seen to the left by the right eye , and that which is on the left of the nose being seen to the right by the left eye .
These and other phenomena illustrative of the well-known law by which we estimate the position of objects with relation to the eye to be in a line drawn from its image in the retina through the centre of the eye , are considered by the author as requiring further explanation .
Not satisfied with the theory of Berkeley , that the mind is guided by the perceptions received from the sense of touch , in interpreting the signs furnished us by the sight , the author proposes to explain these phenomena by an hypothesis of his own , which he states in the following words .
" Over and above the gift of two external or cranial eyes , man has been by his adorable Creator endowed with an internal cerebral organ , which performs the office of a third eye , by being the common recipient of impressions propagated either from one , or both of the external eyes ; and the mind , in her chamber of percipience , steers with regard to external objects by the same principle on which the mariner steers by his compass .
Thus the two cranial eyes are analogous , in principle and situation , to two magnetic compasses placed upon a ship 's deck ; while the third , or cerebral eye , corresponds to another compass placed in the cabin below ; and the mind , situated like the captainmariner in his cabin , knows , from consulting the cerebral eye , on what point of direction the body is steering ; although the mind no more perceives either any external object , nor yet any image in the cranial eye , than the mariner perceives ( even in the vulgar sense of the word perceiving ) the far-off land , or haven , towards which he is surely making his way .
