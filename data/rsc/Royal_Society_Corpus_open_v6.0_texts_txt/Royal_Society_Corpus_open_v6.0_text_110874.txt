" On a case of Superficial Colour presented by a Homogeneous Liquid internally colourless .
" By Sir John Frederick William Herschel , Bart. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. The author observed that a solution of sulphate of quinine in tartaric acid , largely diluted , although perfectly transparent and colourless when held between the eye and the light , or a white object , yet exhibits in certain aspects , and under certain incidences of the light , an extremely vivid and beautifuil celestial blue colour , apparently resulting from the action of the strata which the light first penetrates on entering the liquid ; and which , if not strictly superficial , at least exert their peculiar power of analysing the incident rays , and dispersing those producing the observed tint , only through a very small depth within the medium .
The thinnest film of the liquid seems quite as effective in producing this superficial colour as a considerable thickness .
