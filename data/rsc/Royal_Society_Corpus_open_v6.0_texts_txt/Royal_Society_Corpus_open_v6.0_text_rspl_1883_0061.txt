( Abstract .
) This paper contains an account of experiments made with the view of determining the solubility of salts in water at temperatures above the boiling point of water .
They were originally undertaken with the object of further investigating the anomalies presented by sulphate of soda , but the method adopted was afterwards applied to many other metallic salts , and the paper presents an account of determinations so made , together with a discussion of the theoretical bearing of the results .
The main conclusion arrived at is that solubility is directly related to fusibility .
Of the salts operated upon some habitually crystallise with water of crystallisation , others habitually in the anhydrous state .
When the latter are written down in the order of their melting points , beginning with the most fusible , it is observed that increase of solubility consequent upon a given rise of temperature above 100 ' C. , is greatest in the most fusible , least in the least fusible , and all the cases observed follow this rule in regular order .
If the results are represented graphically , taking for abscissae the degrees of temperature and for ordinates the quantity of salt dissolved in 100 parts of water , it is at once seen that the higher the melting point the more nearly do the curves so constructed approach a straight line .
The relation is illustrated by the case of the chloride , bromide , and iodide of potassium , the solubilities of which at all observed temperatures follow the order of the melting points .
Also in comparing together two such salts as chlorate and chloride of potassium , the solubilities and melting points of which are as follows , the curves cutting each other at 100 ' :\#151 ; Melting point .

Thereafter the solubility diminishes till the temperature of 120 ' is reached .
From 120 ' to 140 ' we find the change if any is inappreciable , but at 160 ' a notable increase of solubility is observed , which is still further increased at 180 ' and at 230 ' , the highest temperature reached .

( Abstract .
) This paper contains an account of some experiments which have been made during the last two years in the Cavendish Laboratory , -Cambridge .
These experiments were made to determine " v " by comparing the electrostatic and electromagnetic measures of the capacity of a condenser .
The condenser consisted of two cylinders fitted with guard-ring pieces .
The electrostatic measure of the capacity was calculated from the dimensions of this condenser .
The electromagnetic measure of the capacity was determined by a very slight modification of the method given in S 775 of Maxwell 's " Electricity and Magnetism .
" In this method the condenser has to be repeatedly charged and discharged by a commutator , and a very elaborate commutator would be required to work the guard-ring part of the condenser ; for this reason the capacity of the guard-ring condenser was experimentally compared with the capacity of another condenser without a guard-ring , the capacity of the latter being altered until the capacities of the two condensers were equal .
The electromagnetic measure of the capacity of the condenser without a guard-xing was then determined by Maxwell 's method .
