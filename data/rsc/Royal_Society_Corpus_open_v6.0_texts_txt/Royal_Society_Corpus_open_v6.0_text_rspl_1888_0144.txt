by sending a cnrrent through it ; for this purpose a layer of sul-phnric acid was placed between the primary and secondary coils of such thickness that it almost but not quite stopped the sparks in the latter ; a current of about 2 amperes , which was reversed about 500 times a second , was then sent through the sulphuric acid , but the passage of the current did not seem to produce any effect whatever upon the sparks in the secondary .
I conclude , therefore that the resistance of an electrolyte is not affected by the passage of a current .
X wish to express my thanks to my assistant , Mr. E. Everett , for the zeal and skill he has displayed in these experiments .
[ Note added February 15,1889.\#151 ; I have recently tried the efEect of a very high vacuum in stopping the sparks .
The primary circuit con-sisted of two straight wires with spheres fastened to one end of each ; these wires were connected with the poles of an induction coil , and the sparks passed between the spheres .
The secondary consisted of two similar wires , with smaller balls at the ends , the distance between the balls being very small .
The length of the wires of the secondary was altered until it was in resonance with the primary .
The secondary was placed in a hollow cylinder formed of two coaxial glass tubes , sealed on to a mercury pump , by means of which a very high vacuum was obtained in the space between them , which surrounded the secondary .
This vacuum , however , did not produce the slightest effect on the sparks .

In consequence of a paper which has appeared in the last number of the ' Zeitschrift fur Hygiene , ' by Dr. Carl Frankel , entitled " Ueber die Eimwirkumg der Kohlensaure auf die Lebensthatigkeit der Mikro-organismen , " 1 have been led to publish the results of some preliminary experiments on the same subject which I made in the spring of 1886 , but which , owing to my attention being at that time devoted to investigations in other directions , I was obliged to put on one side .
Although the methods which I adopted in my experiments are essentially different from those which Frankel has employed , yet the results , so far as they can be compared with his , are on the whole concordant*
