A paper was read , entitled ' ?
'Account of an Improvement in the Machine for producing Engravings of Medals , Busts , &amp;c. directly from the Objects themselves , in which the Distortions hitherto attending such Representations are entirely obviated .
" By Mr. Bate .
Communicated by J. G. Children , Esq. Sec. R.S. Some printed representations of medals having been received from America , about fifteen months ago , evidently effected by some process of ruling , Mr. Bate , jun .
constructed an instrument for accomplishing the same object $ but the results , both of the American method and of the one invented by Mr. Bate , were attended with a degree of distortion .
This the author has ingeniously obviated , by giving an inclination of 45 degrees to the plane in which the tracing-line is moved over the surface of the object of which a representation is to be given .
