IN accordance with instructions received from the Honourable the Court of Directors of the East India Company , and at the recommendation of the Royal Society , I commenced , in the month of January 1846 , the Magnetic Survey of the Eastern Archipelago .
As , in the prosecution of this work , I was left entirely to my own discretion , I may be permitted to state , that the principal object of the Survey appeared to me to consist in determining the position of certain magnetic lines which were included within the space I had to traverse ; such , for instance , as the line of no dip , and of the maximum horizontal component of the force ; from these , to determine the line of minimum intensity ; and finally , the line of no variation and its direction .
The determination of these lines I considered to be the principal object ; but in addition , I was anxious to take hourly observations of the elements of the earth 's magnetism , in order to ascertain whether the changes of declination and of magnetic intensity were uniformly similar over so large an area .
The fixed stations for this latter purpose were sixteen in number , and the time employed at each station varied from a few days to several months .
The fixed stations were spread over an area of 28 ?
of latitude and of 45 ?
of longitude , viz. from 16 ?
latitude north to 12 ?
latitude south , and from 80 ?
to 1250 longitude east .
With reference to the line of no dip , which in this part of the globe coincides very nearly with the line of minimum intensity , I may state , that of the sixteen stations , nine were to the south , three to the north , and four in its immediate vicinity .
With reference to geographical position , four were in the islands adjacent to Singapore ; one in Borneo ; one in the island of Java ; two in Sumatra ; one in the island of Mindanao ; one in Celebes ; one at the Cocos or Keeling Islands , which was the most southern station to which I could venture ; one at Penang , and one in its immediate vicinity ; one at Nicobar , in the bay of Bengal ; one at Moulmein , which was my most northern ; and , finally , one at Madras , which was my most western station .
The Survey is however incomplete , as it would have been desirable to extend it considerably more to the eastward , in order to lay down with greater certainty the continuation , of the line of no dip and of the line of minimum intensity ; and likewise I should have wished to proceed more to the northward , to asceirtain with greater exactitude , at what distance north of the line of minimum intensity , the magnetic declination changes those perliods of extrerne easterly and extreme westerly variation , by which it is characterized in the southern magnetic hemisphere .
In January 1846 1 started from Singapore , and after visiting some islands in the vicinity , which I was enabled to do through the kindness of Colonel BUTTERWORTH , C.B. , the Governor of the Straits , I proceeded , in May 1846 , to Borneo , where I remained some time with myfriend Sir JAMES BROOKE , K.C.B. , and making Sarawak my head-quarters , I took observations at several of the Dutch settlements on the western coast .
From Borneo I proceeded to Java , where I passed ten months , and went on to Sumatra in August 1847 ; but from severe illness brought on through over-exertion in the magnetic survey of part of that island , I was forced to return to Singapore for medical advice in February 1848 .
At Singapore I remained for some weeks ; during which time I was able to take a considerable number of observations of dip and of horizontal intensity ; and early in April 1848 I again left Singapore , and visited successively , Pulo Labooan , Sambooanga in the island of Mindanao , and Keemah in the Celebes .
From Keernah I proceeded to the Keeling or Cocos Islands , and from the Cocos returned to Batavia , whence I was on the point of proceeding to the eastward and to New Guinea ; when I received instructions which induced me to return to Madras , in consequence of having unfortunately very much exceeded the time allotted to me ; and thus an end was put to the Survey , which the liberal patronage of the Court of Directors of the East India Company had enabled nie to undertake , and which I had hoped to render complete .
I returned to Singapore at the close of the year 1848 ; and here let me gratefully acknowledge , the kind and hospitable treatment I received everywhere from the Dutch authorities .
No restrictions were placed on my movements ; I was allowed to proceed wherever I chose , and I rejoice at the opportunity thus afforded me of recording my sense of their uniform liberality ; nor can I omit mentioning my obligations to His Excellency Baron ROCHUSSEN , the GovernorGeneral of the Dutch Possessions in the East ; to His Excellency General VAN DER WEYCK , the Commander-in-Chief in Java , and to Captain SMITZ , the Hydrographer , who rendered me very great service in his superintendence of the magnetic observatory during my occasional absence from Batavia .
Quitting Singapore for the last time , I stopped at Penang on my way to Nicobar Island , which I was anxious to visit from its being in the immediate vicinity of the line of no dip and of minimum intensity .
I then visited Moulmein , and from Moulmein proceeded to Madras , which I reached in June 1849 , from which time till the month of October I was employed there in taking a complete set of absolute determinations , and of hourly magnetic observations , in which latter duty I received the kind aid of Captain JACOB , the Hononlable East India Company 's Astronomer .
Madras was my last station , and I there concluded the Survey .
Having then to reduce and bring into shape an enormous mass of work , it occurred to me that the difficulties I should encounter in publishing in India a system of observation , combining the details of a fixed observatory with those of a magnetic survey , would be very great .
I therefore applied for furlough , and came to England for the sole purpose of publishing my observations , after reducing them into as condensed a form as was consistent with perspicuity .
Since my arrival in England I have been in constant communication with Colonel to whose zealous superintendence and advice I am indebted , on almost every point connected with the reduction of the observations : I have likewise to express my obligations to Dr. LLOYD for his advice and for many acts of kindness ; from their joint Report on the Magnetic Isoclinal and Isodynamic Lines in the British Islands , I have laid down , in a manner similar to the method there adopted , the different magnetic lines on the Chart of the Eastern Seas ; while to the " Magnetical Instrucations for the use of Portable Instruments , drawn up by Captain RIDDELL , R.A. , I am indebted for the abstracts and forms in which the different instruments are registered .
I do not therefore pretend to any originality in my plan ; and the only merit I lay claim to is , that these observations , 'taken under many difficulties , were made with the earnest desire to do credit to the Royal Society , who recommended the Survey , and to the East India Company , whose munificence enabled me to undertake it .
The Survey consisting ; first , of the observation of the differential changes of magnetic and meteorological phenomena at sixteen stations ; secondly , of absolute determinations of dip , intensity , and variation in Java , Sumatra , Borneo and other islands of the Archipelago ; thirdly , of magnetic and meteorological observations at sea , -it will perhaps be best to treat of each separately , and I shall therefore commence with the observatories .
The following Table contains the names of the different stations at which observatories were established , conrmmencing with the most northerly .
The first colunln contains the stations ; the second and third , the latitudes and longitudes ; the fourth and fifth , the materials with which the observatories were constructed ; the sixth , the nature of the soil ; the seventh , the number of days of observation ; the eighth , the eh hyear and month ; and the ninth , the place of observation .

Observatories , Position of the Instruments , 8sc .
As all the observatories were constructed upon the same principle , it will not be necessary to give the positions and adjustments of the instruments at more than two of the stations ; the details of the rest being precisely of a similar nature ; for this purpose the position of the instruments , their adjustments and the dimensions of the observatories on Direction Island , Cocos ; and at Batavia , are given .
Observatory on Direction Island , Cocos or Keeling Islands .
The observations at the Cocos or Keeling Islands were made on Direction Island , with the usual magnetic and meteorological instruments .
The soil on Direction Island consists of a few inches of vegetable soil , and of several feet in depth of fragments of coral .
The observatory tent was pitched in the midst of a thick plantation of cocoa-nut trees about 8 feetabove the level of low-water mark , and about 50 yards from the sea .
Dimensions of the tent 19X 13 feet .
Tent consisted of aic i ; i !
double lining of canvas , and the walls of cocoa-nut leaves .

The magnetic instruments were placed at the four corners as remote from one another as the dimensions of the tent would permit .
The Standard Thermometer was attached to one of the poles of the tent .
The Baroi meter fixed to a detached post firmly imbedded in the ^ t ground .
The Dry and Wet-Bulb Thermometers were placed on a small table , 5 feet above the ground .
Observatory at Batavia .
The dimensions of this building were 42X 28 feet , and almost wholly constructed of bamboo ; the walls were 12 feet in height , composed of thick bamboo matting , and the roof was thatched with leaves of the Neepa palm .
The soil was a very stiff clay , and the spot selected was in the midst of extensive rice-fields .

Times of Observation .
Having during the greater part of the Survey but one assistant , I limited the observations to nineteen hours daily , viz. hourly observations from 3 A.M. to 9 P.M. To this arrangement there are exceptions ; as at Sarawak and during the first four months at Batavia , when I had three assistants ; and then observations were taken hourly during the twenty-four hours .
By astronomical time , therefore , the observations generally commenced at fifteen hours , and terminated at nine hours .
Order in which the Instruments will be noticed .
The instruments will be noticed in the following order:-The Declinometers , the Bifilar , the Dry and Wet-Bulb Thermometers , the Barometer , the Standard Thermometer , and the Maximum and Minimum Thermometers .
Declinometers .
There were never less than two declinometers observed at the same station , and subsequently , when JONEs 's declinometer was received , all three were put in adjust2 2 inent and observed .
At Pulo Peesang , Carimon , Pulo Booaya , Sarawak , Batavia , Poolo Bay , Padang and Sambooanga , Nos. I. and II .
were employed ; at Moulmein , Nos. II .
and III .
; at Keemah , the Cocos , Pulo Dinding , Penang , Nicobar , and Madras , Nos. I. II .
and III .
; and at Singapore , in November and December 18483 , not only were the three above-mentioned observed , but two in addition , viz. No. IV .
, a small cylindrical magnet 3 inches in length , in use for deflection in a separate building , and No. V. , the large 15-inch bar in the observatory .
Declinometer No. I-Declinometer No. I. is the Portable Declination Magnetometer described in Captain RIDDELL'S work on Magnetic Instruments ; the magnet is a solid cylinder 3 inches in length and suspended by a filament of untwisted silk ; the former enclosed in a copper box , the latter in a glass tube .
A scale being fixed above the telescope and reflected by a mirror attached to the stirrup in which the magnet is placed , the changes in the position of the magnet are shown by the mirror reflecting different portions of the ivory scale , and are read off by the telescope attached to the instrument .
The mirror is immediately below the magnet and parallel to its longer axis ; the scale faced the east , and increasing readings denote a movement of the north pole east .
The ratio of the torsion force to the magnetic directive force , H or the value of p , varied from '000207 to '000278 .
The value of one scale division in arc value is 'd=3437'75 X= 1'00 , where l=o-th of an inch=-01 and r= 17'19 inches .
Declinometer No. II.-Declinometer No. II .
is the Induction Inclinometer described at page 12 of RIDDELL'S work .
The magnet is of the same length as No. I. , but hollow .
The adjustments are precisely similar .
The mirror is parallel to and immediately below the longer axis of the magnet .
The value of one scale division is exactly the same as for No. I. , viz. 1 ' of arc .
The coefficient of torsion varied from -000139 to '00025 , and is therefore not worth taking into account , except for large angles of deflection .
Declinometer No. III.-.Deinometer No. III .
, or JONES'S Declinometer , is precisely similar in principle to the two others ; the magnet being a solid cylinder 3 inches in length .
The mirror , instead of being parallel to the longer axis of the magnet , is at right angles tdoit , so that the scale , instead of facing the east , being to the south of the magnet , faced the north .
Increasing scale readings denote a movement of the north pole east .
The value of one scale division is 1"0036 ; the coefficient of torsion '00031 .
Contents of Abstracts of Table A. referring to the Declinometers .
In the abstracts of Table A. are given , from page i to page xi inclusive , the oscillation , or more properly the variation of the declination* at the different stations in the Eastern Archipelago ; pages ii and iii contain the mean oscillation of the declination , the range extending from the most westerly declination assumed as zero , to the most eastern position of the magnet .
As increasing readings denote a movement of the north pole of the magnet eastward , the lowest number will of course be the most western position or zero , the highest number being the most eastern position .
As these tables contain the mean oscillation for several months , the oscillations at those stations where observations have been taken for more than one month are given in pages iv to vii inclusive .
In addition to the three Portable Declinometers , No. IV .
, a small 3-inch cylinder used as the deflected magnet in the determination of the absolute horlizontal intensity , and No. V. , the 15-inch observatory bar , were observed at Singapore .
The oscillations of these two instruments are given at pages iv and v , reduced to minutes of angular space , and the mean results are included in the Table of Declinometer No. III .
at pages ii and iii .
It occurred to me constantly whilst at the observatory to note , that not only did the larlge magnet differ from the smaller magnets in its time of changing , but the range or oscillation was not the same ; the time of change differed but slightly it is true ; but it was not identically the same* .
I determined therefore to use on the Survey never less than two magnets ; one a solid , the other a hollow cylinder , for the changes of declination ; and on my return to Singapore in 1848 , I took nearly simultaneous observations of as many declination magnets as could be observed together .
On inspection of the Tables of the mean oscillation of the declination at pages ii and iii , I was struck with the dissimilarity of the times of occurrence of minimum westerly declination at the different survey stations ; and as the observations were taken at all seasons of the year , it appeared to be exceedingly desirable to have some fixed observatory to refer to , to ascertain what changes might be due to geographical position and what changes to the time of the year .
I have , therefore , at pages viii , ix , x and xi , given the mean hourly oscillation of the magnetic declination at the Singapore Observatory , for each season being the mean of three years ; the mean of each of the months ; and finally , the mean of each of the three years , showing the founded with the angle a , or the angle which the magnetic meridian forms with the true meridian , and which is usually called the variation of the needle ; but to prevent mistakes , for the angle a , the term magnetic declination has been substituted , in accordance with the method now generally adopted .
remarkable similarity of one year with another .
As the sole object in giving these Singapore tables , was to determine the times of extreme easterly and westerly declination in the southern magnetic emisphespere near the line of minimum intensity , the results of the Singapore Observatory magnet are not in this instance given in minutes of arc , but in scale divisions ; one scale division being equal to 40"t7 of arc .
Table A.--Pages xii to xlvii contain the results of the declinometers at the sixteen stations in theArcipelago .
The staions are give roceeding from the most north ms rern to the most southern : the observations themselves are omitted .
At the top of every double page is printed the name of the station , with its latitude and longitude ; the mean astronomical time at the station ; and th value of one o scale division in minutes of arc , multiplied by the coefficient of torsion or 1+V ; the value of which is so trifling as not to affect the small diurnal changes of the magnet ; and the zero of the month , which is the scale division of the magnet at that hour at which the absolute determination of the magnetic declination was made , usually at 9 A.M. The results of each instrument are contained in five lines ; the first , the sums of the scale readings the second , the means ; the third e the diurnal changes , from the mean of the meanonth * ; the fourth , the range or oscillation of the needle , from its minimum or most western position ; and the fifth , the diurnal declination .
Curves .
The curves of the declinometer are given in Plates IV .
, V. and VI .
Part 1 of Plate IV .
contains the curves of the deelinometer at those stations where observations were made during the spring and summer ; Part 2 of Plate IV .
and Part I of Plate V. the winter curves ; Part 2 of Plate V. the equinoctial curves .
The two Plates are drawn to a scale of 1 ' of arc to 0*35 of an inch , and Plate VI .
contains the Singapore curves , which are drawn on a scale of 0-68 of arc ( the value of one scale division ) to 0m35 of an inch .
In the three Plates the zero line is the line of the magnet 's most westerly position .
The curve rising denotes a movement of the north pole of the magnet eastward .
The curves themselves show , by the description of dotting , to which season they belong .
As the station curves have to be compared separately with Singapore , it will be preferable to consider first the principal changes of the Singapore curves shown in Plate VI .
In Part 1 of Plate VI .
, which gives the mean curve of each month for three years , it appears that the minimum or westerly declination occurs at Singapore in December at 19 hours ; in January at 20 ; in February at 21 ; in March ( equinoctial monthl ) a slight retrogression to 20 ; in April at 21 ; in May at 23 ; in June at 21 in July and August at 23 ; in September at 22 ; in October at 21 ; and in November at 20 hours .
If the seasons are projected in curves as in Part 2 of Plate VI .
, we find in winter the minimum at 20 hours ; in spring at 21 hours ; in summer at 23 hours , and in autumn back to 21 hours ; agreeing in this with the spring curve , but differing very materially as regards the progression of the needle eastward in the afternoon ; autumn and winter agreeing in this latter respect , and also spring and summer .
The oscillation of the curve exhibits a much greater range during the winter months* ; the autumn curve is next in extent of range and in the afternoon preserves a certain degree of parallelism with the winter curve ; and both these curves have the afternoon maximum more decidedly expressed , and have also a higher maximum than in the morning .
The reverse of this is the case with the spring and summer curves .
The mean curves of the three years exhibit a wonderful uniformity and almost total resemblance .
There are two most decided maxima at 18 and at 3 or 4 hours , and one minimum at 21 .
There are besides two other minima at 10 and at 17 hours more faintly expressed .
If we turn to the seasons , we find only one strongly defined maximum and minimum or a single progression in winter ; in spring two strongly expressed maxima and one minimum ; in summer and in autumn two maxima and two minima ; and as these maxima and minima occur at different periods , the mean annual curve thus blends the leading characteristics of all , and presents accordingly a double , if not a triple progression .
On an inspection of the Plates , and on comparing them with the Singapore curves , we find that in Part 1 of Plate IV .
the Moulmein April curve resembles no single curve in any one month at Singapore .
The curve is that described by Declinometer No. III .
; thqre are two minima at 17 and 1 , and two maxima at 20 and 5 hours .
Moulmein is about 8 ?
north of the line of minimum intensity .
T'he next two in Part 1 of Plate IV .
are the Sambooanga May curves of Declinometers Nos. I. and II .
; comparing them with the same period at Singapore , we observe a certain degree of similarity , the morning maximum being at the same hour , the minimum being one hour later ; the curves of the two declinometers differ slightly with each other : Sambooanga is on the line of minimum intensity .
The next curves are those of Batavia during the spring months ; their resemblance to the spring curve of Singapore given in Part 2 of Plate VI .
is very striking ; the morning and afternoon maxima and the morning minimum being at the same hours at both places : Batavia is 14 ?
south of the line of minimum intensity .
The next curves in Part 1 of Plate IV .
are the Sarawak summer curves ; there is a considerable resemblance to the curves at the same period at Singapore , the morning minimum being one hour later ; the position of Sarawak is exactly the same as Singapore relatively to its position south of the line of minimum intensity .
The last three curves of Plate I. are the Keemah curves of the latter end of June or cornmencement of July ; their morning maximum and minimum at 19 hours , and at noon , correspond with the same periods at Singapore .
At the top of Part 2 of Plate IV .
containing the winter stations , the curves of the five declinometers are drawn to the same scale , viz. 1 ' of arc to 0'35 of an inch : there may be seen from these curves , the extreme difference likely to occur amongst instruments observed nearly simultaneously ; whilst these curves are similar , they are not identically the same ; the observations were not taken at the same instant , but one after the other in the order of the declinometers* .
The curves of Pulo Peesang in the same Plate , are similar to the Singapore February curve .
The Carimon and Booaya curves are similar to one another , but the maximum in the afternoon is earlier than the corresponding maximum at Singapore .
Part 1 of Plate V. is the continuation of the winter curves ; the curves of the three declinometers at all the stations of Nicobar , Penang , Pulo Dinding , Batavia and Padang , agree well with the same winter period at Singapore .
In Part 1 of Plate V. , at the hours of 6 and 7 , there is observable in some instances a want of uniformity in the progression of the curve ; in some instances no difference is perceptible , in others a minimum .
On referring to Plate V. we find there is a minimum at Singapore in January , exactly similar to the minima shown in some of the curves of Part 1 of Plate V. , and at the same hours .
In Part 2 of Plate V. are given the curves of the stations where the instruments were observed during the equinoctial months , both in spring and in autumn .
The Madras curve , when compared with the Singapore curve , has its morning maximum and minimum at 20 hours and at noon ; at Singapore at 18 and at 22 hours , two hours earlier .
Madras is near the line of minimum intensity .
The observations at Bencoolen were taken for a few days at the end of August and at the commencement of Septemrber , it is therefore difficult to say to which month they belong ; they agree well with the Singapore August curve .
The next curves in the Plate are those of Batavia in March ; they are exactly similar to the Singapore curve in March .
The Cocos curves taken in September agree well with the Singapore September curve ; the form of the mnorning curve is identical , and the time of the afternoon maximum ; but they differ in the afternoon maximum at the Cocos , having a greater range than the morning maximum ; the progression of the magnet westward being subsequently more rapid till between the hours of six and seven , when there is the same faint minimum expressed as in the January curve at Singapore .
Noting therefore those curves which are in accordance or differing but slightly from the Singapore curves during similar periods , we find only two which differ materially from the Singapore curves at similar periods of the year ; one of the stations , Moulmein , being considerably to the north of the line of minimum intensity , the other , Madras ( not differing so much ) , in its immediate vicinity .
Sambooanga and Nicobar are indeed likewise close upon the line of no dip or minimum intensity , yet they agree generally with the Singapore curves .
It is to be observed , that as we proceed north and approach the line of minimum intensity , the similarity to the Singapore curves becomes more faint ; this may be seen on inspection of the Plates , where the most southerly stations , the Padang , Batavia and Cocos curves , agree exceedingly well with those at Singapore at similar periods* .
Bfilar Magnetometer .
The bifilar magnetometer is described at page 11 of RIDDELL'S work ; the apparatus is not very dissimilar to the unifilar ; it consists of a tripod base with a fixed circular plate 5 inches in diameter , graduated so as to be read off by verniers to single minutes , carrying an upper revolving plate and two projecting arms for supporting the reading telescope and counterpoise weight ; the magnet and bifilar suspension are enclosed , the former in a copper box , the latter in a suspension tube , 10 inches in length , carrying a circular plate , torsion circle and right and left hand screw-cylinder at its upper extremity , and the circle divided so as to be read off by verniers to 5 ' : the magnet is suspended by two portions of the same thread , and is maintained by a rotation of the upper extremities in a position at right angles to the magnetic meridian .
The principal adjustments are the following , for the purpose of bringingthe magnet , when suspended by the double thread , into a position at right angles to the magnetic meridian:-1st .
To bring the line of detorsion of the threads to coincide with the magnetic meridian .
This is effected by suspending the magnet by a single filament of untwisted silk ; the telescope is turned until the centre division of the scale is on the wire ; the instrument is clamped ; the magnet is then introduced carefully with its bifilar suspension ; the vernier of the torsion circle is turned until the centre division is again on the vertical wire of the telescope , and the plane of detorsion is in the magnetic meridian .
The telescope which is fixed to the instrument is then turned 90 ?
in azimuth ; the vernier of the torsion circle is turned in the same direction through an angle ( v ) equal to 60 ? .
The centre division of the scale is brought on the vertical wire by increasing or diminishing the interval of the threads ; which is effected by turning the milled head of the screw-cylinder .
The telescope is then turned back 90 ?
; the torsion circle being turned back through the angle v ; if the adjustment has been made correctly , the line of detorsion is again in the magnetic meridian ; the accuracy of the adjustment is tested by turning the telescope 1800 in azimuth , so as to reverse the direction of the magnet , or bring its north end to the south .
The telescope is again turned 90 ?
at right angles to the magnetic meridian , so that increasing readings denote a decrease of force ; the vernier of the torsion circle is turned till the central division of the scale is ag , ain on the vertical wire .
The magnet is then perpendicular to the magnetic meridian , and the instrument is in adjustment .
Thus much was necessary for understanding the following adjustments ; those at the Cocos and at Batavia only are given ; the adjustments at the rest of the stations being precisely similar , since the same angle of torsion v=60 ?
was selected for every station .
Adjustment of the Bzfilar at Batavia .

The variations of the horizontal intensity are obtained by multiplying the differences of the scale readings , or of their mean values ( corrected for changes of temperature ) by a constant coefficient k-=a.cot v where a is the value of one scale division in terms of radius ; as the horizontal circle by means of verniers read off to single minutes , I ascertained the value of a directly .

Coeffcient of Temperature.-Determination of the Value of q. The value of q was determined directly at all the principal stations by heat being gradually applied to the box at the time the instrument was in adjustment ; by adopting this method before sunrise , the thermometer being at the lowest temperature , and the changes of force very trifling , I could ascertain at once the changes in the readings of the scale corresponding to the changes of the thermometer , and from thence the coefficient of temperature in terms of the force ; a piece of cotton steeped in spirits of wine , ignited and applied carefully to the bottom of the box , gradually raised the interior temperature as indicated by the enclosed thermometer .
The following are the results at the commencement of August 1847 at Batavia ; the results of the experiments at that station and at the Cocos are alone given , the results at all the other stations being precisely similar .

As these results are strictly in accordance with similar observations made at other stations , viz. at Sarawak , Padang , &amp;c. , I have not had the least hesitation in assuming the value of q equivalent to one scale division : increasing scale readings denote an increase of temperature or decrease of force .
Oscillation or Variation of the Bjfilar .
From page xlviii to Iv inclusive , are given the oscillation , or more properly , the range of the horizontal intensity , given in detail in Table B ; first , the mean oscillation of the horizontal intensity at all the stations comprised in the Survey ; and at those stations where observations have been taken for more than a month , as at Batavia , Sarawak , and Padang , the mean oscillation has been found from the monthly oscillations .
At pages 1 and li are given the comparison of the observatory with the portable bifilar ; but these are in scale divisions , and their values in terms of the force are different .
The maximum range in the one case is 5'91X'000240=-0014 , and in the other case 8'23 X '000197='0016 of the force ; and the mean range is , of the .
portable bifilar , 2'48 X *000240000595 , and of the observatory bifilar 2'87 X'000197 -'000565 of the force* .
Singapore a Station for Comparison .
In order to have a fixed station where the hours of maxima and minima and extreme range may be known , the oscillation of the observatory bifilar is given in scale divisions at pages lii and liii for each of the seasons , for each of the months , and finally , the mean of each year .
Table B. From page Ivi to lxxxv are contained the results of the bifilar at each of the sixteen stations in the Archipelago ; the stations are given from the most northern proceeding to the most southern , the observations themselves being omitted .
At the top of each page is printed the name of the station and the astronomical time ; then follow the coefficients , the value of one scale division , and the value of q ( the change of magnetic moment of the magnet for 10 of temperature in terms of the force ) ; X the value of the absolute horizontal intensity ; the zero of the month , which is the mean of the month uncorrected ; and the standard temperature , to which the mean of the month is corrected .
The results of the bifilar at each station are given in horizontal columns : the first contains the sums of the scale readings ; the second the means ; the third the temperature correction to the lowest mean reading of the thermometer ; and as increasing scale readings denote a decrease of force , the corrections will be all subtractive ; the fourth contains the corrected means ; the fifth contains the variation of the force in scale readings , the highest scale reading being the minimum of force and considered as 0 ; and the sixth contains these scale divisions in terms of the force , one scale division being =-0002402 of the force .
The last vertical column , or -- , is retained , since it is the difference between the zero and the mean value of the daily means corrected to 80 ? .
Immediately below this table is given the mean results of the thermometer , the bulb of which is inserted in the copper box containing the bifilar magnet ; the first column includes the sums ; the second the means ; and the third column the differences from the lowest mean temperature .
Curves .
Part 1 of Plate VII .
contains the curves of the Bifilar at the Singapore Observatory for each month of the year in scale divisions , each scale division being -000197 of the force drawn to 0'35 of an inch .
Part 2 of Plate VII .
is drawn to the same scale , and contains the mean of the four seasons , the mean of each year , and the general mean of the three years .
The general march of these curves is exceedingly simple , having but one single progression , ; the maximum occurs at either 22 or 23 hours , the autumn and winter curves having generally their maximum at the former , the spring and summer curves at the latter hour .
The minimum occurs at 10 or 11 hours , the minimum in autumn and in winter being likewise one hour earlier than the minimum in spring and summer ; the extreme range in spring and autumn being greater than in summer and in winter .
Plate VIII .
contains the curves at the stations where the portable bifilar was observed ; three stations having been omitted , as the curves of these instruments observed but for a few days would cause some confusion by crowding the Plate : there appears to be exactly the same similarity observable between these and the Singapore curves to which they are referred , the maximum occulrring sometimes as late as noon ; but the curves at the winter stations , as at Singapore during the same period , being distinguished by the intensity reaching its maximum earlier by one hour than in spring .
The curves in Parts 1 and 2 of Plate VIII .
are both drawn to the same scale , viz. one scale division ( ='000240 of force ) to 0*29 of an inch .
The curve rising denotes an increase of force .
The curves of the bifilar showing the changes of horizontal intensity , appear to partake , every one , of the same character as the horizontal intensity at Singapore .
Table C.-Dry and IYet Bulb .
The dry and wet bulb instrument was made by CARY ; it was small but accurate , and was in use throughout the Survey ; but the wet-bulb thermometer was broken in crossing from Moulmein to Madras , and at the latter station another thermometer was substituted in lieu of it .
Explanation of Table C. The results of the dry and wet-bulb thermometers are contained in Table C , from page Ixxxvi to cvii inclusive .
The mean variation or range of the dry thermometer is given in the General Table at pages lxxxvi and Ixxxvii .
At pages Ixxxviii and lxxxix are given the mean variation of the wet thermometer .
At pages xc and xci are given the mean variation of the tension and vapour , and at pages xciv and xcv the mean degree of humidity of the air at the different stations .
The Tables containing only the mean results of the ; observations commence at pages xcvi and xcvii .
The dry and wet-bulb thermometers at each station are given in succession .
In the first line of each set is given the mean of the number of days observed , in the second line the diurnal variation ; then follows the mean of the wet-bulb thermometer , the diurnal variation , and lastly , the tension or elastic force of vapour in inches of mercury .
The formula for the tension of vapour at the dew-point is f , __flf df 11=f 88 , where d is the difference between the dry and wet bulb , and f/ the tension of vapour at the temperature of the wet bulb .
The value off ' is given in Table V. of the Report of the Committee of Physics and Meteorology of the Royal Society .
The quantity of humidity in the air is found by dividing the tension of vapour at the temperature of the dew-point by the tension of vapour at the temperature of the air , and the result gives the number of proportional parts of in humidity the atmosphere ; and it is by this method that the Table at pages xciv and xcv is constructed .
The Tables of the dry and wet bulb are concluded at pages cvi and cvii .
Curves .
The curves corresponding to these Tables are laid down in Plate IX .
; but the standard thermometer for the dry bulb is substituted .
The curves are drawn to a scale of 10 ?
of temperature to 0*35 of an inch .
Remarks .
The curve of the dry thermometer consists but of a single progression , the minimum being usually at 6 A.M. , the maximum at noon .
The curve of the wet thermometer consists likewisebut of a single progression , its maximum and minimum occurring at the above times ; the diurnal variation of the tension of vapour at pages xc and xci at the different Survey stations is very irregular ; the curve usually consists of but a single progression , and is very similar to the wet bulb .
The minimum is usually at 6 A.M. , the maximum being at noon ; the greatest range extending from 01 to 0'26 of an inch of the barometer .
The irregularity occasionally indicated may be owing to the shortness of the period during which the instrument was observed .
At those places where the dry and wet bulb were observed for more than a month the curve is regular .
Throughout the Archipelago the minimum of tension of vapour usually occurs at 6 A.M. , the maximum being at noon ; a remarkable exception to this takes place at Madras , where the minimum is observed at noon ; it appears to be explicable from the circumstance of the remarkable dryness of the air at Madras in August and September compared with that of the Archipelago generally ; the dry thermometer at Madras ranges 15 ?
'5 during the day from 6 A.M. to noon , or 1 P.M. ; at which time it is at its maximum , as also the difference between the dry and the wet bulb .
After 1 P.M. the dry thermometer gradually falls , and the difference between the dry and wet bulb diminishes , whilst the wet-bulb thermometer is still rising , veryslowly , till 3 P.M. ; consequently the tension of vapour increases so that the minimum elastic force occurs at noon , and the maximum some time in the afternoon .
The mean elastic force of the tension of vapour varies from 0*8 to 09 of an inch of the mercurial column .
The range of the humidity in the atmosphere , given at pages xciv and xcv , shows a single progression only , the minimum being at noon , the maximum early in the morning ; in some instances the air is saturated with moisture at 6 A.M. At Moulmein and at Madras , where the air was driest , and just previous to the N.E. monsoon at the latter and the S.W. monsoon at the former place , the mean quantity of humidity varied from 66 to 68 parts , complete saturation being 100 ; in the space included in the Survey the air is always loaded with mosunli , re , and it is a tolerable approximation to the truth to state , that throughout the Archipelago the minimum quantity of humidity is 0175 , the maximum 0'85 , and the mean quantity 0'80 ; complete saturation being =1-0 .
The following Table contains the stations , their latitudes and longitudes ; the mean for measuring approximately the degree of humidity in the atmosphere ; and Colonel SYKES , F.R.S. , has mooted the question in a very interesting paper on the Meteorology of India , which has been lately published in the Philosophical Transactions : oneot of e sources of error supposed to be peculiar to this instrument , although easily remedied if discovered , is the too close proximity of the wet bulb to the dry bulb , the consequent depression of the latter , the difference of the two thermometers or the value of d consequently diminishing , and the resulting tension of vapour greater than it ought to be .
I do not know the exact distance that the two bulbs were apart in CARY'S little instrument ; at most 2 to 21 inches , and both fixed to one stem .
The following are the results of a comparison between the Standard Thermometer and Dry-Bulb Thermometer at all the stations ; and it will be seen , on inspection of the following Table , how very slight are the differences between the two thermometers* .

At the principal stations the large Standard Barometer was in use ; but at some the Portable Barometer was observed , from the greater trouble and risk attending the carriage of the Standard .
The Standard was used at the following places:-at the Cocos , at Batavia , at Padangj at Singapore , at Keemab , at Sarawak , and at Sambooanga The Standard Barometer was made by NEWMAN ; diameter of the tube 0"532 ; the correction to be applied for capillary action-'003 " .
The zero-point consists of a fine conical point brought to touch the surface of the mercury ; this is an adjustment which we are instructed to make at each observation ; but throughout the Survey the conical point or zero-point , being once accurately adjusted , was never subsequently touched ; the capacity of the cistern is so much greater than that of the tube , that the variation of the barometer in the Tropics being not more than -i5th of an inch , the level of the cistern would be but little affected thereby .
The internal diameter of the cistern is about 4 inches ; the relative areas of the tube and cistern are as 0 25 to 16 , or as 1 to 64 ; and as the barometric column varies to the extent of ---th of an inch , the cistern would be affected to -10th of an inch , and the quicksilver therefore would rise above or sink below the mean position Tl--oth of an inch ; a space which a very accurate observer might be able to detect between the conical point and a very bright surface , but not with the quicksilver in the barometer now in question , as the surface was covered with a thick film , and the glass cistern was somewhat dingy ; for this reason , after one adjustment very carefully made at noon , this being about the ime of the meanthe zero point of the abarometer was not further touched during the whole series of observations ; and I never could detect at the hour of maximum and minimum , viz. at 9 or 10 A.M. , and at 3 or 4 P.M. , any difference in the relative position of the conical point to the surface of the mercury , and therefore no correction has been applied to the neutral point determined at noon .
The Standard Barometer was by no means tight , and therefore imperfectly portable : when moving from one place to another , the quicksilver was constantly escaping by the wooden collar at its junction with the tulbe ; this loss was supplied with fresh mercury , strained through leather and poured into the cistern ; and as no air could ever be detected in the tube , the instrument was perfectly serviceable throughout the whole of the Survey .
The leakage at the collar was by no means peculiar to this barometer , as I have discovered it in others by the same maker .
The Portable Barometer , made by CARY , was in use at a few stations during the Survey ; I had filled it very carefully at Singapore ; in the comparisons made with it and the Singapore Standard Barometer , it was generally a little lower ; but as it had not exactly the same range , the correction would not be constant , and therefore no correction has been applied .
The diameter of the tube , which dimension I obtained from Mr. CARY , is between 0'27 and 0'28 of an inch ; the correction to be applied for capillary action= +0"'023 ; the scale is marked on brass to the twentieth of an inch , and can be read off by a vernier to the thousandth of an inch , being similar in this respect to the Standard Barometer .
The gauge-point or zero-point is a slit in the iron cistern at its upper surface ; the quicksilver , being pressed up by means of a screw applied to the leathern bottom of the cistern , is raised till the light is no longer seen through the slit , and the level of the quicksilver in the cistern is then at that point from .
which the scale is laid off ; there is therefore no correction for neutral point : this instrument was well made and well finished , and has yielded at all times exceedingly satisfactory results .
Explanation of the Table D. The observations made with the barometer are contained in Table D. from page cviii .
to cxxi inclusive .
At pages cviii and cix are given the mean variation or oscillation of the barometer ; at pages ex and cxi the mean variation of the gaseous pressure or dry column of air .
From page cxiv to cxxi inclusive , are contained the mean results of the barometer at each station : each set contains in the first line the mean of the barometer uncorrected ; then the barometer corrected to 32 ?
; and thirdly , the gaseous pressure which is deduced by subtracting from the barometric column the tension of vapour .
Curves .
The curves of the barometer corrected to 32 ?
, are contained in Plate X. The curves are drawn to a scale of 01 of an inch of barometric pressure to 0a30 of an inch linear measure : the curve rises with the increase of pressure .
Plate XI .
contains the curves of the variation of gaseous pressiure drawn to the same scale , viz. -01 of an inch of barometric pressure to 0 30 of an inch linear lmeasure : the curve rises with increase of pressure .
Remarks .
The barometric curve has a double progression , a principal maximum and minimum at 9 A.M. , and at 3 and 4 P.M. ; and a secondary maximum and minimum at 10 P.M. and 4 A.M. The intervals between the successive maxima and minima are nearly equal , and the degree of parallelism between all the curves is very striking ; the range or variation appears to be nearly similar , and the hours of maxima and minima are identical ; one exception occurs at Madras , the maximum taking place at the same time , but the minimum at 5 P.M. , two hours later than the minimum generally ' throughout the Archipelago .
The variation of the gaseous pressure is given in Plate XI .
; it appears to have , like the barometric curve , a double progression , but the principal maximum and minimum occur earlier ; the A.M. minimum is more faintly expressed , with an interval of three or four hours only between the morning minimum and the morning maximum .
The curve is likewise more irregular than the barometric , and the range is greater ; only a few of the curves are given , to prevent confusion from over-crowding , and those places have been selected where observations have been taken for upwards of a month .
The following^ Table contains , by Dr. LLOYD'S method of equal intervals , the means of the barometer uncorrected , the barometer corrected to 32 ?
, and the mean of the gaseous pressure ; each mean being the result of three sets at equidistant hours , viz. 3 , 4 , 5 A.M. ; 11 A.M. , noon , 1 P.M. ; 7 , 8 .
and 9 P.M. The mean throughout the Archipelago , of the barometer corrected , is 29*80 to 29'90 English inches ; the range or variation being a little more than a tenth of an inch .
The mean of the gaseous pressure is about 29 inches ; the variation being nearly double that of the , barometric pressure , and amounting to about two-tenths of an inch .

Standard Thermometer .
This instrument , made by NEWMAN , was used in the observatory at Singapore till the end of the year 1845 , and I then took it with me on the Survey .
The scale is marked off to half-degrees , each degree being 0-11 of an inch , so that the thermometer is read off easily to tenths .
In marking off the scale , an error has been committed in omitting one degree from 90 ?
to 95 ?
, so that 95 ?
is only 94 ?
; the divisions of the scale are all equal , and therefore the mistake occurring in the numbering only , one degree has always been deducted from the observed reading of the thermometer when it stood at 95 ?
or above that temperature .
The standard thermometer was usually attached to the pole of the tent , or else to the back of the post to which the standard barometer was fixed .
Explanation of Table E. The results of the observations with the Standard Thermometer are contained in Table E. , from page cxxii to cxxix inclusive .
At pages cxxii and cxxiii are given the diurnal variation of the Standard Thermometer .
The remainder of Table E. contains the mean results of the Standard Thermometer ; each set contains , in two lines , the nean hourly readings and the diurnal variation of the Standard Thermometer .
Curves .
The curves of the Standard Thermometer have already been noticed in speaking of the dry bulb .
Remarks .
There is but one maximum and one minimum in the twenty-four hours , viz , .
at 2 and at 18 hours .
The oscillation or range varies , but the smallest is at Singapore , where the standard thermometer was placed inside the observatory , but exposed to a current of air passing through the building .
'he range was greatest at Moulmein and at Padang ; but as at these observatories the observations were taken under canvas only , the direct influence of the sun 's rays was very great .
At Moulmein the temperature of the observatory was so hot as to be nearly unbearable , although the thermometer only reached 1050 : at the commencement of the Introduction I gave a short statement of the materials with which each observatory was constructed , that , in recording the height of the thermometer , the circumstances under which it was observed should be taken into consideration : the difficulty in tropical climates of ascertaining correctly the temperature of the air is very great ; the most difficult points to be determined appear to be ; the size of the building , the height of the roof and the nature of the materials of which it is composed , in order that the thermometer shall give only the temperature of the air , and not in addition that of the building in which it is placed .
If the building is small , if the roof is low and of good conducting materials , such as slates or tiles , the thermometer is too high by day , and probably too low at night ; the only condition appears to be a lofty room , of large size , well-ventilated , and double-roofed with non-conducting materials .
The observatories at Sarawak , Singapore and Batavia were excellent in this respect : at all other stations the thermometer was not sufficiently screened from the above liabilities to error , and therefore the daily curve at some of the stations is too high , whilst the mean temperature is nearly correct .
Solar and Terrestrial Radiation Thermometers .
In addition to these thermometrical observations , there was likewise in use , at the conclusion of the Survey , a Solar Radiation Thermometer , the bulb of which was tinged of a dark purple colour , although not absolutely black .
This instrument was placed on a table outside the tents and freely exposed to the sun .
After the instruments in the tent were observed , the solar radiation thermometer was read off hourly , , from 7 A.M. to 4 or 5 P.M. , and the maximum of the day recorded , with the time at which it was observed , being generally 11 A.M. , noon , or 1 P.M. The minimum self-registering thermometer was placed on a table outside the tent at night , and the minimum temperature shown by the index read off at 7 A.M. The subjoined Table contains the maximum solar radiation , and the mean at each station ; the minimum and the mean of the self-registering thermometer exposed at night ; and lastly , the mean of the standard thermometer , by dividing by the number of observations , and likewise by Dr. LLOYD 's method of equal intervals , each result being the mean of three sets , at 3 , 4 , 5 A.M. ; 11 A.M. , noon , 1 P.M. ; and 8 , 9 , 10 P.M.

27 19 105-5 99-5 722 74-9 79-2 79-2 0.0 Survey , and Instruments employed .
The observations connected with the Survey relate to absolute determination , such as latitude , longitude , dip , horizontal intensity , and variation or magnetic declination , and this is the order in which the subject will be treated ; but previously , it may be as well to state in a few words , how the Survey on land was conducted .
On my arrival at a station I had my small tent pitched , for the reception of the magnetic instruments ; this was generally put up the evening of my arrival ; and the next morning at daybreak I commenced observing .
The instruments in use were a 6-inch dip circle , a portable declinometer for magnetic declination and intensity , an altituide and azimuth instrument , made by ROBINSON , and sent out on the first establishment of the observatories , and a chronometer ( 824 ) , ARNOLD and DENT , which had been so long in use , that it was not to be trusted for a fixed rate .
The first instrument set up was the portable declinometer ; this instrument was tedious to adjust , in consequence of the suspension thread , to support the collimator magnet , being stronger than there was occasion for so as to obviate the necessity of frequent renewal ; the stirrup with the brass weight attached to the suspension thread , was allowed to swing for more than a couple of houts ; the opportunity was taken during the interval of determining the dip with four needles .
At 8A.M .
the dip observations being completed , the stirrup of the portable declinometer , by frequent small twists of the torsion circle having been brought to rest in the magnetic meridian , was finally in adjustment .
The brass weight for taking the torsion out of the threads was removed , and the collimator magnet placed in the stirrup .
The altitude and azimuth instrument was adjusted in rear of the collimator magnet , and in the direction of its axis , but always to the south of it , at a distance of about 4 feet .
By 9 A.M. , this instrument being also in adjustment , the copper damper was placed carefully in the oaken box containing the collimator magnet , by which the latter in a few minutes was brought to rest .
During this short interval three or five altitudes of the sun were taken with the sextant and artificial horizon , and the corresponding times with the chronometer .
At 91 A.M. , the collimator magnet being at rest , altitudes of the sun were observed with the altitude and azimuth for magnetic declination or variation ; these being finished , observations for horizontal intensity , both of deflection and vibration , were proceeded with and generally finished at 11 1 A.M. At noon circumrmeridional altitudes of the sun were observed for latitude , and in the afternoon , if fine , equal altitudes were taken to confirm the morning sights .
The tent was then taken down , the instruments packed up , and generally sent off in the 1 evening , if practicable , to the next station .

Latitude .
The observations for latitude were usually taken , if the weather permitted , a few minutes both before and after noon : the instrument being previouisly in adjustment , the altitudes and times corresponding were taken immediately before or at noon , three times with the vertical circle direct , and three times at or immediately after noon with the vertical circle reversed ; the latitude was found from these altitudes reduced to the meridian .
A Table of the Latitudes at the Cocos or Keeling Islands is subjoined , merely as a specimen of the working of the instrulnent ; it is necessary to state , that in the observations for latitude by taking altitudes of the sun , the error of collimation was corrected by the reversal of the telescope on its axis ; but in finding the latitude from altitudes of the stars , the instrument was clamped in the meridian , the altitude of the star taken as it passed the centre wire , and a correction applied for the error of collimation .

Longitudes .
The longitudes were found chiefly from sights ; but I am afraid they are not much to be depended upon , in consequence of the rate of the chronometer frequently changing ; the following is the method I adopted , at any two places far apart , where I was able to determine the rate .
I took the mean rate and applied it to the observations for longitude at the intermediate stations .
At some of the principal points , where I remained for a considerable time , I was able to obtain sights of moon-culminating stars for longitude , as well as lunar distances ; the longitudes obtained from moonculminating stars with the altitude and azimuth instrument , were necessarily very rough , but they served as a check upon the chronometer .

, very nearly .
I consider it my duty , however unsatisfactory may be the observations , to publish one set in detail , as their value , small or large , may thus be inferred ; although but little could be expected from a small altitude and azimuth on an ordinary table stand , as a substitute for a transit instrument , it was better to depend upon these observations than upon the chronometer , which had been long in use , and which yielded such rates , on successive days at the Cocos , as the following:+7 '7 , +9s'1 , +-11s , 4+ g'8 , +7S'8 , +6s'7 , +6s'7 , +Ss'4 , + 8s9 , +-8-7 , +8S9 +9 , +9S'l , +-9-5 , 12s.2 , +10.-4 , +9s9 , t-8s'6 , +86+8'-9 ; the mean rate being +8Ssl9 ; of course no dependence could be placed upon such rates as these for the longitude .
Dip or Inclination of the Needle .
The Dip Observations are contained in Table F. , from page cxxx to cxxxix inclusive .
On commencing the Surlvey in 1846 I was not fturnished with a dip cilcle ; a Fox 's dip circle had been stolen from the observatory at the latter end of 1845 , and three dip circles had been sent , in 1844 , to England to Mr. BARROW , but they had not then reachled Singapore , having been detained at Bombay through some mistake .
In March 1846 I received a dip circle with four needles from Mr. TAYLOR , the then astronomer at Madras : the needles were very inferior ; one of them , A1 L , having a difference of 24 ?
reading on the reversal of the poles : the observations with this needle should perhaps have been omitted .
The correction to be applied to A1L was 28 ' , with only half the value assigned to it , which has been given to each of the other needles , and each recorded observation with the Madras circle is the mean of fortyeight readings .
With the Madras dip circle I took observations at Singapore , in Borneo , at Batavia , and the western portion of the island of Java ; these observations are included in pages cxxx and part of cxxxi .
On my return to Batavia at the latter end of the year , I found the three dip circles , which , having been thoroughly repaired , had been sent out by Mr. BARROW ; the observations are contained in pages cxxxii and cxxxiii* .
Before commencing the survey of part of Sumatra , I determined to make use of needles with their poles unchanged , and to apply a correction , if necessary , for the true dip , as the large magnets for reversing the poles were often brought in dangerous proximity to the small cylindrical magnets used on the Survey .
Having determined the true dip at Padang with nine needles , I fixed upon Dip Circle No. 1 with three needles , A 1 , A1L and A2 L , by first combining A 1 , A1 L , and subsequently A1L with A2 L. The mean result gave me as a correction. .

This series of three needles with poles unchanged and correction +8 ' 9 , terminates at Natal in Sumatra .
On my return to Singapore in February 1848 , a long series of observations was taken , to determine by direct means the difference in the inclination A.M. and P.M. , the former being taken with four needles at 10 and 11 A.M. , the hours of maximum horizontal intensity , and the latter at 4 P.M. , the hour of minimum horizontal intensity ; the poles of the needles employed were changed at the commencement or the termination of each day 's observation , so that the A.M. and P.M. observations were taken with the needles under the same magnetic condition ; two days consequently were necessary for the determination of the true dip .
From the mean result at page cxxxiv , there is a difference of 0'`8 increase in the afternoon , whilst the probable error of the mean value of each set is the same , viz. +0'"4 .
At the Cocos or Keeling Islands , the poles of the needles of Box No. 1 being unchanged , the correction to be applied to the three needles was as follows:-for A 1 , --3'0 ; for A1 L , --60 ; and for A2 L , -3'0 ; equal value in determining the mean has however been given to these needles , as double the number of readings have been taken .
At Pulo Dinding the poles of the needles of Dip Circle No. 1 were again changed , when it appeared that for A 1 , poles direct and poles reversed were nearly the same ; for A1 L , the correction to be applied to poles direct was 16'-3 , and for A2 L , the correction to be applied was-2a'0 ; and these have been the corrections mrade use of at page cxxxv for Dip Circle No. 1 at Singapore .
Inclination or Dip at Sea .
The observations at sea were made with a Fox 's Dip Circle ; the separate observations are not given , as they would occupy too much space ; but the mean results are contained in a General Table at page cxxxvii , where the observations at sea have been corrected for the direction of the ship 's head , for index correction ( the poles being unchanged ) , and corrected with the whole of the dip observations to a mean epoch , viz. January 1 , 1848 .
The details of swinging the ship , of finding the index correction , are not included in this report , but one example is given of swinging the Schooner at Keemah .

There were in all thirteen observations : from north to east , three ; east to south , three ; south to west , three ; and west to north , four .

+25'3 This instrument Colonel SABINE , R.A. had the kindness to send out to re , and I used it whenever an opportunity offered , but the Schooner was so small that it was difficult to take observations of inclination when there was any sea on .
The needle B. was never removed from the box , and advantage was taken at every station of applying to the dip a fresh index correction .
Fox 's Dip Circle , sent out overland , was very roughly handled on its way out , so that the circle was no longer concentric to the axis of the needle .
The observations were taken on a gymbal stand , the dip circle being leveled as accurately as possible , and twenty readings taken with the face of the circle to the east , and the same number with the face of the circle to the west .
The inclinations at sea contained in the General Table , are the means of several groups of observations ; for the dip being observed whenever it was calm , three or even five observations were taken repeatedly during the day when the weather permitted .
General Table , and Reduction of Observations to one common Epoch .
The General Table of Inclination on shore and at sea is given at pages cxxxvii , cxxxviii and cxxxix .
The whole of the observations are reduced to one common epoch , viz. the 1st of January , 1848 .
At the Singapore Observatory observations were taken at two different periods , and with great care .
At the commencement of 1848 the dip was -12 ? ?
56',8 At the commencement of 1849 the dip was -120 59'14 The difference nearly , of one year ... -2"6 These are valuable chiefly from the superior character of the instruments and dipping-needles .

-24 ' 02 " being 2*7 per annum increase , or 0"22 per mensem .
This rate of 0'22 per inensern is assumed as the correction to be added to observations taken prior to January 1848 to correct them to that epoch , and subtracted from observations taken subsequent to that date .
This change at Madras is I believe strictly in accordance with the observations of Captain LUDLOW of the Madras Engineers , the talented director of the magnetic establishment at that station .
As the south end of the needle dips at Singapore and the north end at Madras , and the inclination is increasing at both stations , there must be at some intermediate spot a point of contrary flexure .
The mnethod of observing on shore after the reception of the three new dip circles was never altered with those needles whose poles were changed ; the circle being always in the magnetic meridian ; two sets of readings were taken in each position of the need , the usual eigh positions being bserved for the edcorrection of instrumental error as follows : viz. needle direct and ireversed for the non-coincidence of the magnetic axis with the axis of form ; the circle east and the circle west for the correction of the zero of the vertical limb , and the same four positions with the poles changed to correct the error arising from the centre of gravity not coinciding exactly with the axle of the needle .
With a view of ascertaining the value of the observations of the inclination , I drew up the following Table of the probable error of a single determination , and of the probable error of the mean value of the inclination at some of the principal points of the Eastern Archipelago .
The first column contains the year and month ; the second , the name of the station ; the third , the number of needles ; the fourth , the number of dip circles observed ; the fifth , the number of observations ; the sixth , the mean value of the dip ; the seventh , the probable error of a single determination ; and the eighth , the probable error of the mean value .

The horizontal intensity was determined from four declinometers , viz. the small Observatory Declinometer at Singapore ; the Induction or No. II ; JONES'S or No. III ; and the Portable Declinometer .
The Observatory Declinometer with apparatus , consisted of a small gun-metal box , in which was suspended a needle 3 inches in length with mirror attached : two deflecting bars at right angles to the box , were marked off to 0'05 of a foot .
A telescope and scale detached from the instrument , and put on a separate pillar , completed the apparatus , which was placed in a building near the magnetic observatory .

----I L J the ivory scale was always made use of instead of the horizontal limb of the instrunent ; and the advantage gained by this was rapidity of observation .
JONES'S , or No. III Declinometer , was received at the termination of the Survey ; it was liable to derangement from the difficulty of clamping the limb securely ; in other respects the instrument was a very great improvement upon No. II .
Declinometer ; the ivory scale had a greater range ; the deflecting bar at right angles to the instrument was a strong brass scale , supporting a moveable stirrup on its upper edge , on which the deflecting magnet was placed , so that it could be moved backwards and forwards by sliding the stirrup along the scale : the great advantage of this arrangement consisted in the deflecting rmagnet never being touched , nor affected by the heat of the hand .
Six deflecting needles were used with the three declino , meters , D 5 , D 6 , A 7 , A 8 , A9 and A 10 .
D6 was lost at Padang in Sumatra .
The Portable or No. IV .
Declinometer , was used both for variation and for horizontal intensity ; so that after altitudes of the sun and the magnetic axis of the collitnator magnet had been observed , the instrument became available for observations of deflection and vibration ; C 15 a collitnator magnet , being suspended , and C7 the deflecting needle .
The angles of deflection were read off on the glass scale of the suspended magnet , the divisions of which were very coarsely cut .
Explanation of Table G. The observations are contained in Table G. from page cxl to page cliii .
The results are given in eleven columns .
The first contains the date ; the second , the station ; the third and fourth , the suspended and deflecting magnets ; the fifth and sixth , the distances at which the magnets were placed , with the corresponding angles of deflection ; the seventh , the observed time of 300 vibrations ; the eighth , the Declinometer ; O standing for the Observatory , I for the Induction , J for JONES'S , and P for the Portable Declinometer ; the ninth and tenth , the values of m and X , m being the moment of free magnetism of the deflecting bar , and X the horizontal component of the earth 's magnetic force ; and the eleventh , the mean value of X. Mode of Observation in determining the Horizontal Component of the Force .
The position of the deflected magnet was read off without the deflecting magnet , both at the commencement and at the end of the observations , and the change which had occurred in the declination in the interval was thus shown without the necessity of a subsidiary instrument .
The change of declination observed was spread over the observations , on the supposition that it had been uniform .
The deflecting magnet was placed on the brass scale to the west of the declinometer , and moved successively to four or eight distances , with the marked end of the needle to the west and to the east .
The needle was then placed to the east of the deflected magnet , and a similar operation performed .
This concluded the experiments of deflection .
To determine the time of one vibration , 360 were observed , and care was taken that the vibrations of the deflecting needle should be limited to an exceedingly small arc .
Formule for the Determination of m and X. Deflection.-The value ofX is found for each distance by the formula m11 x=r3 tan a.p 1+2 where P= -r r,5 tan a , -rar5 tan a where P r15 tan at-rS tan are and r , being two distances at which the deflecting magnet is placed , a and a , the corresponding angles of deflection .
Vibration.-From the experiments of vibration , X r2k where X is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , k the moment of inertia of the magnet and stirrup , T the time of one vibration .
To obtain the value of k , a cylindrical brass weight is attached at each end of the magnet , T2 and k=k , rT2__T ; i where k , is the moment of inertia of the magnet and attached weights , T the time of vibration with the magnet and stirrup only , T ' the time with the weights attached , and k , = ( 2+r2 ) ; in which I_the interval between the points of suspension of the weights , r the radius of the brass cylinders , and 2p their weight .
Determination of the Coefficients .
In finding the values of m and X , it is necessary to determine certain constants ; such as ( 1 ) the value of one division of the scale of the suspended magnet ; ( 2 ) the coefficient of temperature of the deflecting magnet ; ( 3 ) its moment of inertia ; ( 4 ) the value of P. ( 1 .
) Value of one division of the scale .
In the Singapore Observatory Declinometer , the value of one scale division was determined by the formula a'-X 3437'747 : the results alone are given .

) ValueofP r2r , Stana , -r2r5tan a.-The value of P was determined for each " 4)Yl P-rj tan a , --r5 tan a needle , from the mean of many angles of deflection at the same distances .
The following are the results of the mean value of P for the different magnets and the four declinoneters .
March , 1846 , at Singapore , the value of P for D5 and D 6 , determined by the Observatory Declinometer , was -'00309 .
June , 1846 , at Sarawak , by the Induction Inclinometer , The value of P for D5 was +'00320 D6 +-00169 A6 -'024157 A7 -'007276 A8 -'00726 A9 -'00335 A 10 -'00335 C7 --00361 June , 1848 , at Sambooanga , in the island of Mindanao , by No. III .

-'00930 A9 was. .
-01059 A 10 was. .
-00932 and by the Observatory Declinometer the value of P for A8 was -'00751 .
Remarks.-TLhe observations of deflection are exceedingly numerous , and it is to be regretted that some of the time expended on them was not bestowed on the more complete determination of the coefficients ; but , as the angles of deflection were exceedingly small , it was deemed advisable to multiply observations for the value ofX as much as practicable .
The needle was not always vibrated on the same day on which the experiments of deflection were observed , yet care was taken that it should be vibrated at the same time at which the deflection was observed ; and in low latitudes , subject to trifling disturbances , there is a greater change in a few hours on the same day , than there will be after the lapse of some time at the same hours ; thus there would be a much greater difference in the time of vibration of a needle at 11 A.M. and 5 P.M. on the same daty , than if it were vibrated at 11 A.M. on different days .

I II II Il Table H. Table H , at pages cliv and clv , contains the absolute determinations of Total Force , and of the Horizontal Component , of Inclination and of Variation .
Explanation of Table H.-The first five columns require no explanation .
The sixth column contains the horizontal intensity deduced from observations made with the four declinometers ; the values of the horizontal intensity given by the portable declinometer , are less than those found by means of the other three declinometers ; this has arisen from the shrinking of the oak deflecting bat of the portable declinomreter , by which the values of r , r ' , &amp;c. , the distances of the deflecting from the suspended magnet , are less than they should be , consequently the angles of deflection are greater than they ought to be ; X is therefore greater and X less than its true value ; but this shrinking must have happened before the Survey ; for the ratio of the trlue horizontal intensity deduced from the three declinometers , to the horizontal intensity found by means of the portable declinometer , is constant .
As the instrument was left at Madras , I have no means of measuring the true values of r , r ' , &amp;c. but if four stations be taken , Singapore at the commencement , Batavia and the Cocos during the Survey , and Madras at its termination , we find the comparison to be as follows .

10 42 The eleventh colunn contains the altitudes of the stations above the sea level .
Unfortunately , during the survey of Java , I had no barometer with me .
Table I. Table I contains the observations made at sea ; the inclination determined by Fox 's Dip Circle have already been noticed .
The meteorological observations , consisting of the temperature of the air and of the sea , were taken when practicable , at 15 , 18 , and 21 hours , at noon , and at 3 , 6 , and 9 P.M. The observations of the temperature of the sea were made in the following manner:- the thermometer was placed in a bucket of sea-water , allowed to stand for a few minutes whilst the other instruments were observed , and the thermometer was read off whilst its bulb was still immersed .
The Table contained at pages clvi and clvii requires no explanation .
On the Direction of the Isoclinal and Isodynamic Lines , and the Lines of Equal Variation or Magnetic Declination .
On the Isoclinal Lines.-The observations of dip or inclination have been combined for the position of the isoclinal lines , their mean direction , and their mean distance apart ; they have been formed into four different groups .
1st Group.-Singapore , Borneo , and Java , afford forty stations ; and if we call 3 the dip at the central position , u the angle which the isoclinal line passing through the central position makes with the meridian , and ra constant coefficient , which determines the rate of increase in a direction perpendicular to the isoclinal line ; and we put r cos u=x r sin u-y , we may make equations of condition of the following form : ax-+by= -- ' , where a and b are coordinates of distance in longitude and latitude of the several stations from the mean , expressed in geographical miles ; Y ' the inclination at these several stations , and 6 the mean dip .
Then from this group we obtain , the results alone being given , At a mean latitude .

The axes of coordinates are throughout assumed positive when taken to the north and west ; so that as we proceed to the north , the dip increases at the rate of 1'940 pelpendicular to the isoclinal line which forms an angle of N. 86 ?

4th Group .
In the fourth group are contained the principal stations in the Magnetic Survey , extending from the 80th to the 125th degree of east longitude , and from 16-1 ?

From the resulting equations we obtainAt a mean latitude .

57 ' W. to S. 60 ? ?
57 ' E. with the meridian , and the horizontal intensity on a line perpendicular to this increases at the rate of '0005855 the geographical mile .
Lines of Total Intensity .
The total intensity has been determined by the formula h=fcos 8 , h or f= -c =h sec , where h is the horizontal intensity , S the dip , f the total intensity ; eighty equations of condition of the following form , ax+by=f-f ' , have been combined by the method of least squares , so as to assume the form of the two following equations:a2x+aby=a(f-f ' ) abx+b2y=b(f-f ' ) , a and b being the coordinates of distance in longitude and latitude from the mean station for any station , and f ' its intensity ; f the mean total intensity =8'745 .
Then by adding together the equations of condition for each station , we obtain the following:r==--001073 , u= 85 ? ?
36 ' , at a mean latitude of 3 ?
05 ' S. and a mean longitude of 106 ? ?
47 ' E. The angle which the line of equal total intensity forms with the meridian is N. 850 36 ' W. to S. 85 ? ?
36 ' E. , and increases southerly at the rate of 001073 the geographical mile .
The line of least intensity in that part of the Archipelago over which I have carried the Survey , agrees nearly with the line of no dip .
On looking over the list of stations , we find Sambooanga , Nicobar , and Madras , with the least total inten sity .
Sambooanga and Nicobar are about forty miles north of the line of no dip .
The angle which the line of least intensity makes with the meridian is nearly a right angle .
Lines of Variation .
The first attempt which I made to determine the lines of equal variation was unsatisfactory .
From 120 equations of condition combined by the method of least squares , I obtained results quite at variance with the actual fact .
I then broke up the observations into three groups , one to the extreme west , comprising the observations taken in Sumatra , one in the centre comprising the observations taken in Java , and the third group to the east .
The results thus obtained are more satisfactory , for the line of equal variation in the longitudes and latitudes over which the Survey extended is a straight line for a very short distance only .

The lines have been laid down on the charts nearly in accordance with the foregoing results .
The line of equal inclination forms an angle of 86 ? ?
40 ' with the meridian , and changes in a direction perpendicular to it at the rate of 1'970 the geographical mile .
The line of equal horizontal intensity forms an angle of nearly 65 ?
with the meridian .
For the position of the central line of maximum horizontal intensity , I have taken stations north and south of this line having the same horizontal intensity , and have divided the distance e between them and in laying don the e ate of decrease of the horizontal intensity I have fixed upon the Java group , which has the greatest number of stations , as decreasing at the rate given me by the equations of condition ; but since the horizontal intensity at the Cocos shows a much more rapid decrease when at some distance from the line of maximum horizontal intensity , I have gradually increased the rate of progression to the Cocos , and decreased it in the same proportion northwards from Java to the line of maximum horizontal intensity .
The lines of total intensity are laid down in strict conformity with the resulting equations of condition .
The direction of the linesisi between 850 and 86 , and proceeds at the rate of 001073 the geographical mile .
There is much less difficulty in laying down the total intensity lines than the lines of horizontal intensity ; for the former , and the rate of progression in a direction normal to them , are functions of the dip and htorizontal intensity ; and since the dip hages very rapidl , whilst the orizontal intensity is nearly stationary in the immediate vicinity of the maximum horizontal intensity , it follows , first , that the line of minimum total intensity will coincide nearly with the line of no dip ; and secondly , that its rate of progression , or the value of r , will be as uniform and as constant as the lines of dip , for it has been shown that over the space of 28 of latitude over which this Survey extends , the dip changes at the rate of nearly two miles for every mile of latitude .
In laying down the lines of variation , I have been guided partly by the equations of condition , but to be directed by these alone would lead to very unsatisfactory results .
I have , in the Java group and in the Eastern group , conformed to the results of the equations of condition combined by the method of least squares , whilst in the western group I have simply connected together by lines the stations having the same variation .
Explanation of Plates XII .
and XIII .
Plate XII .
contains the isoclinal lines or lines of equal magnetic dip and lines of equal magnetic declination , as well as the central lines of minimum total intensity and of maximum horizontal intensity .
Plate XIII .
contains the isodynamic lines or lines of equal horizontal intensity and of equal total intensity ; and in addition , the line of no magnetic declination and the line of no dip .
