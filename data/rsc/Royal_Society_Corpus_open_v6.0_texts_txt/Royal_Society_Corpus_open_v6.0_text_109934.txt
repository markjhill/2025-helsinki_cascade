] With his previously acquired knowledge respecting the formation of the ova of quadrupeds in Corpora lutea , Sir Everard proceeds to inquire into that of the Opossum tribe , the ova of which are not formed in the same manner , but make two distinct gradations between the quadruped and Ornithorhynchus paradoxus , which last approaches so near to the bird , as to complete the link of gradation between the quadruped and bird in their mode of generation .
Sir Everard first describes the formation of the ova in the Kangaroo , which , when expelled from the Corpus luteum , receive a yolk in the Fallopian tube , and afterwards the albumen in the uterus .
The foetus , when expelled from the uterus into the marsupium , attaches itself to the nipple , as described in the 85th and 100th volume of the Philosophical Transactions .
In the Kola and Wombat , and great and small Opossum , instead of Corpora lutea there are yolk bags imbedded in the substance of the ovarium ; and there are two uteri , with a Fallopian tube to each , the ovum in each uterus being separately impregnated in its own cavity .
The mode of formation of the ova in the Ornithorhynchi , forms the intermediate link between the Opossum and bird .
The yolk bags are imbedded in the ovaria ; and instead of a regular uterus , each Fallopian tube swells out into a cavity , in which the ova are impregnated .
