" On an Air-Engine .
" By James Prescott Joule , F.R.S. &amp;c. Received May 13 , 1851 .
The air-engine described in this paper consists of a pump by which air is compressed into a heated receiver ; and a cylinder , through which the air passes again into the atmosphere .
The difference between the work evolved by the cylinder and that absorbed by the pump , constitutes the work evolved by the engine on the whole .
Two tables are given ; the first of which contains the pressure , temperature and work absorbed , for various stages of the compression of a given volume of air .
The second table gives the theoretical duty of the air-engine described , worked at various pressures and temperatures .
The temperature recommended to be adopted in practice is as little below the red heat as possible , which would involve the consumption of only about one-third the amount of fuel consumed by the best steam-engines at present constructed .
