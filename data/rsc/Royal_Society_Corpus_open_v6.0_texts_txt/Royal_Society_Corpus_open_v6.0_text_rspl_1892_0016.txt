( From the Physiological Institute , Leipzig .
) In 1880 , Kufferath* pointed out that when both the ducti thoracici\#151 ; right and left\#151 ; and the ductus choledochus are ligatured icterus does not appear .
From his having only kept the dogs experimented upon alive from 1 to 2^ hours , I was induced to test the value of the statement by a series of experiments on animals kept alive for much longer periods .
The following are the results obtained , conducted under the guidance of Professor Ludwig , to whom my best thanks are due for the valuable assistance he gave me .
The health of the animals experimented upon , I found , was not disturbed by ligaturing the thoracic duct , if , after being kept fasting a few days , they were carefully fed upon a fat-free diet and not only so , but that they might live for weeks and months and even increase in weight .
Nor did the additional ligaturing of the common bile duct prove dangerous if done a few days previous to the application of the ligature to the thoracic duct , and the dogs fed on food containing only small quantities of proteids .
On the other hand , when both the thoracic and bile ducts were ligatured at the same time , the animals frequently died a few days after the operation , in consequence of rupture of the common bile duct and the escape of bile into the peritoneal cavity inducing fatal peritonitis .
The experiments were conducted as follows :\#151 ; After being operated upon , each dog was kept separately in a place suitably arranged for collecting its urine , which was daily examined for bile pigment by Gmelin 's test , and for bile acid ( after being treated according to Hoppe Seyler 's method ) by von Udranszky 's test .
After the death of the animal the .
bile in the gall bladder was analysed .
The portal blood-vessels were injected , and , although the bile capillaries were greatly distended , all attempts made to inject them proved unsuccessful .
In order to ascertain if the thoracic duct had been properly ligatured it was carefully examined , and then injected with Berlin blue , so as to find out if it had opened up any collateral lymphatics , through which its lymph could find access to the general circulation .
Of eighteen dogs thus experimented upon , two having died from * Kufferath , " Ueber die Abwesenheit der G-allensaure im Blute nach dem Ver-scbluss des G-allen- und des Milchbrustganees " ( Du Bois-Reymond 's ' Archiv f. Physiol , '1880 , p. 92 .

28 Icterus in Occluded Ductus 1892 .
] By careful post-mortem examination it was ascertained that in every case in which bile appeared in the urine , after ligaturing the thoracic duct , the bile had reached the general circulation by the development of collateral lymphatic vessels .
These were found to leave the thoracic duct at a point under the first rib and proceed from thence to join the right innominate vein .
The only other occasions on which bile was found in the urine , after ligature of the thoracic duct , were in those cases where rupture of the bile duct occurred , and allowed its contents to escape into the peritoneal cavity .
In every case examined , not only was bile pigment , but also bile acid , found in the lymph of the dilated thoracic duct .
Tiedemann and Gmelin , * Fleischl , f and Kunkelj : had already pointed out that when the ductus choledochus is ligatured and the lymph collected from the thoracic duct it is rich both in bile pigment and bile acid , whereas the blood remains entirely free from bile .
The analyses of the bile taken from the gall-bladders of the dogs in which a communication between the thoracic ducts and the right innominate vein had been established by the development of collateral lymphatic vessels , thereby permitting bile to reach the general circulation , showed that , in these instances , the bile neither contained an increased quantity of soluble substances nor of taurocholate of soda , but merely an excessive amount of mucin .
1 be following table contains the results obtained from the analyses of bile taken from the gall bladders of four of the dogs operated upon , ami of two other healthy dogs .
The amount of taurocholate of soda was calculated from the quantity of sulphur found in an absolute alcohol extract of the dried residue left after the removal of mucin , and other substances soluble in ether ( cholesterin , fat , and lecithin ) .

* I 2 Presents .
[ Mar. 31 , days after ligaturing the duets ( Experiments 1 , 2 , 5 , \amp ; c. ) , the hile ducts were found so greatly increased in size that on making a section of the liver , even the so-called bile capillaries could be seen by the naked eye without the aid of injection .
In all cases where the blood vessels were filled with injection , and the liver hardened in a solution of bichromate of potassium , free spaces were found between the blood capillaries and the liver cells .
These appeared to be the perivascular lymph spaces of MacGillavry* and Budge.f The enlarge-ment of the perivascular lymph spaces seem to have taken place at the cost of the liver cells , for not only did the cells themselves appear to be much smaller , but the nuclei of the neighbouring hepatic cells appeared to be closer together than normal .
Three conclusions may apparently be drawn from the results ob-tained from these experiments :\#151 ; Firstly .
That bile existing in the bile ducts can only reach the blood through the intervention of the lymphatics .
Secondly .
Seeing that lymphatics surround the liver blood vessels , one is forced to believe that bile pigment and bile acid cannot pass through the endothelium of the blood capillaries in the liver ; or , perhaps , even throughout the body .
The fact that bile reaches the blood when it has escaped into the peritoneal cavity is no argument against this view .
For in that case it would reach the blood through the lymphatics of the diaphragm .
Thirdly .
After the left thoracic duct has been ligatured for some time , collateral lymphatics are opened up , or developed , leading into the right innominate vein .
