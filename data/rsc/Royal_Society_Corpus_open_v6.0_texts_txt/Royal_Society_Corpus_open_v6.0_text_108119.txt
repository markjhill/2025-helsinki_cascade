Introductory Remarks .
THE former Essay* contained a general method for reducing all the most important problems of dynamics to the study of one characteristic function , one central or radical relation .
It was remarked at the close of that Essay , that many eliminations required by this method in its first conception , might be avoided by a general transformation , introducing the time explicitly into a part S of the whole characteristic function V ; and it is now proposed to fix the attention chiefly on this part S , and to call it the Principal Function .
The properties of this part or function S , which were noticed briefly in the former Essay , are now more fully set forth ; and especially its uses in questions of perturbation , in which it dispenses with many laborious and circuitous processes , and enables us to express accurately the disturbed configuration of a system by the rules of undisturbed motion , if only the initial components of velocities be changed in a suitable manner .
Another manner of extending rigorously to disturbed motion the rules of undisturbed , by the gradual variation of elements , in number double the number of the coordinates or other marks of position of the system , which was first invented by LAGRANGE , and was afterwards improved by POISSON , is considered in this Second Essay under a form perhaps a little more general ; and the general method of calculation which has already been applied to other analogous questions in optics and in dynamics by the author of the present Essay , is now applied to the integration of the equations which determine these elements .
This general method is founded chiefly on a combination of the principles of variations with those of partial differentials , and may furnish , when it shall be matured by the labours of other analysts , a separate branch of algebra , which may be called perhaps the Calculus of Principal Functions ; because , in all the chief applications of algebra to physics , and in a very extensive class of purely mathematical questions , it reduces the determination of many mutually connected fuinctions to the search and study of one principal or central relation .
When applied to the integration of the equations of varying elements , it suggests , as is now shown , the consideration of a certain Function of Elements , which may be variously chosen , and may either be rigorously deterimined , or at least approached to , with an indefinite accuracy , by a corollary of the general method .
And to illustrate all these new general processes , but especially those which are connected with problems of perturbation , they are applied in this Essay to a very simple example , suggested by the motions of projectiles , the parabolic path being treated as the undisturbed .
As a more important example , the problem of determining the motions of a ternary or multiple system , with any laws of attraction or repulsion , and with one predominant mass , which was touched upon in the former Essay , is here resumed in a new way , by forming and integrating the differential equations of a new set of varying elements , entirely distinct in theory ( though little differing in practice ) from the elements conceived by LAGRANGE , and having this advantage , that the differentials of all the new elements for both the disturbed and disturbing masses may be expressed by the coefficients of one disturbing function .
lTransformations of the Differential Equations of Motion of an attracting or Repelling System .
1 .
It is well known to mathematicians , that the differential equations of motion of any system of free points , attracting or repelling one another according to any functions of their distances , and not disturbed by any foreign force , may be comprised in the following formula : .
m ( x x+ y " y " ) U : ... ... .
( 1 .
) the sign of summation 2 extending to all the points of the system ; m being , for any one such point , the constant called its mass , and xyz being its rectangular coordinates ; while x"y " z " are the accelerations , or second differential coefficients taken with respect to the time , and x , y , 6z are any arbitrary infinitesimal variations of those coordinates , and U is a certainforce-function , introduced into dynamics by LAGRANGE , and involving the masses and mutual distances of the several points of the system .
If the number of those points be ?
t , the formula ( 1 .
) may be decomposed into 3n ordinary differential equations of the second order , between the coordinates and the time , U sU a mu mx".= ; my= ... ... .
( 2 .
) -ix ; ii i ; mi -zi and to integrate these differential equations of motion of an attracting or repelling system , or some transformations of these , is the chief and perhaps ultimately the only problem of mathematical dynamics .
2 .
To facilitate and generalize the solution of this problem , it is useful to express previously the 3n rectangular coordinates xy z as functions of 3n other and more general marks of position 1m 2 ... , ; and then the differential equations of motion take this more general form , discovered by LAGRANGE , d 8TT uU dt 6 q , qi~ * ... * .

) the variation of the integral S is therefore S=2 ( , 3v p e),..e.d ... e ... ... .
( 23 .
) ( p and e being still initial values , ) and it decomposes itself into the following 6n expressions , when S is considered as a function of the 6 it quantities i e. , ( involving also the time , ) aS aS 1 21= , ; P2 =a e ; asas 2 , ^ 2 = ; e2 &gt; ... ' ... ... ( B. ) -TSn Sn ; P3n e= nJ which are evidently forms for the sought integrals of the 6n differential equations of motion ( A. ) , containing only one unknown function S. The difficulty of mathematical dynamics is therefore reduced to the search and study of this one function S , which may for that reason be called the PRINCIPAL FUNCTION of motion of a system .
This function S was introduced in the first Essay under the form S =t ( T + U ) dt , the symbols T and U having in this form their recent meanings ; and it is worth observing , that when S is expressed by this definite integral , the conditions for its variation vanishing ( if the final and initial coordinates and the time be given ) are precisely the differential equations of motion ( 3 .
) , under the forms assigned by LAGRANGE .
The variation of this definite integral S has therefore the double property , of giving the differential eqtuations of m[notion for any transformed coordinates when the extreme positionls are iregarded as fxed , and of giving the integrals of those differential equations when the extreme positions are treated as varying .
5 .
Although the ftunction S seems to deserve the name here given it of Principal Function , as serving to express , in what appears the simplest way , the integrals of the equations of motion , and the differential equations themselves ; yet the same analysis conducts to other functions , which also may be used to express the integrals of the same equations .
Thus , if we put Q=j'(Z ?
.~ +H)+ d t , ... ... ... ... Q =J0 + ( 84 +-I ) 1 dt,.**********(24 .
) and take the variation of this integral Q without varying t or dt , we find , by a similar process , Q=--( s'-e p ) ; ... ... ... ... .
( 25 .
) o2 99 so that if we consider Q as a function of the 6n quantities w. p. and of the time , we shall have 6n expressions aQ aQ = + , ei=-p , ... ... . .
( 26 .
) which are other forms for the integrals of the equations of motion ( A. ) , involving the function Q instead of S. We might also employ the integral V =J .
dt= J dd ^ ... ... ... .(27 .
) which was called the Characteristic Function in the former Essay , and of which , when considered as a function of the 6n+1 quantities ; i e. H , the variation is V= ( r-pse ) +t H ... ... ... . .
( 28 .
) And all these functions S , Q , V , are connected in such a way , that the forms and properties of any one may be deduced from those of any other .
Investigation of a Pair of Partial Differential Equations of theJirst Order , which the Principal Function must satisfy .
6 .
In forming the variation ( 23 .
) , or the partial differential coefficients ( B. ) , of the Principal Function S , the variation of the time was omitted ; but it is easy to calcuS late the coefficient corresponding to this variation , since the evident equation dS aS aS d dt 8+ 2t ( 29 .
) dt aH ndt* gives , by ( 20 .
) , and by ( A. ) , ( B. ) , aSaH =t.S 2 .
=H ... .o ... . .
( 30 .
) It is evident also that this coefficient , or the quantity H , is constant , so as not to alter during the motion of the system ; because the differential equations of motion ( A. ) give dH sH dn SH d\ dLl _Ed dt ++ i dJt = ... , ... ( 31 .
) dtdt H+a dt If , therefore , we attend to the equation ( 17 .
) , and observe that the function F is necessarily rational and integer and homogeneous of the second dimension with respect to the quantities wt , we shall perceive that the principal function S must satisfy the two following equations between its partial differential coefficients of the first order , which offer the chief means of discovering its form : aS , / s as as I~+F S , a%,..* n.~- , * -U 3( , 2 Reciprocally , if the form of S be known , the forms of these equations ( C. ) can be deduced from it , by elimination of the quantities e or n between the expressions of its partial differential coefficients ; and thus we can return from the principal function S to the functions F and U , and consequently to the expression -I , and the equations of motion ( A. ) .

( G. ) and if the part 1H and its coefficients be small , they will not differ much from these other differential equations , di _H d_I 8a H1 dtd6 i ' dt = ' ( H. ) so that the rigorous integrals of the latter system will be approximate integrals of the former .
Whenever then , by a proper choice of the predominant term H , , a system of 6n equations such as ( H. ) has been formed and rigorously integrated , giving expressions for the 6n variables 7 mw as functions of the time t , and of their own initial values ei pi , which may be thus denoted : =i a= ( t , eV,. .

( 45 .
) the simpler motion thus defined by the rigorous integrals of ( H. ) may be callled the undisturbed motion .
of the prposed system of n points , and the more complex motion expressed by the rigorous integals of ( G. ) may be called by contrast the disturbed motion of that systenm ; and to pass from the one to the other , may be called a Problem of Perturbation .
9 .
To accomplish this passage , let us observe that the differential equations of undisturbed motion ( H. ) , being of the same form as the original equations ( A. ) , may have their integrals simiilarly expressed , that is , as follows ; Zai = 1i Pi =.n Coimparing the forms ( 44 .
) with the second set of equations ( I. ) for the integrals of undisturbed motion , we find that the following relations between the functions , S8 must be rigorously and identically true : iti , el , e2 3,. .
es , ' ... ( 47 .
) and therefore , by ( K. ) , that the integrals of disturbed motion may be put under the following forms , ni = , i ( te , e2 , SnP 8+ S++ S)( We may therefore calculate rigorously the disturbed variables y , by the rules of undisturbed motion ( 44 .
) , if without altering the time t , or the initial values ei of those variables , which determine the initial configuration , we alter ( in general ) the initial velocities and directions , by adding to the elements Pi the following perturbational terms , AP = , A P2 e2 ' A 3n : ' ... ... ... ( M. ) a remarkable result , which includes the whole theory of perturbation .
We might deduce from it the differential coefficients ti^ , or the connected quantities 8 , which determine the disturbed directions and velocities of motion at any time t ; but a similar reasoning gives at once the general expression , +S t , e , e2 , .

) involve the disturbed coordinates i. only as they enter into the coefficients of this small disturbing function 82 , it is evidently permitted to substitute for these coordinates , at first , their undisturbed values , and then to correct the results by substituting more accurate expressions .
11 .
The function S , of undisturbed motion must satisfy rigorously two partial differential equations of the form ( C. ) , namely , aS1 + FI ( 1 ' *aS5 n. * .

In the same order of approximation , if the variation of the expression ( 44 .

Suppose that the theory of undisturbed motion has given the 6n constants e. pi or any combinations of these , Z , X2 ... nZ .
as functions of the 6n variables zi w , and of the time t , which may be thus denoted : Zi= Xi ( t , 1 , , ' ' s , , ' , 25 , ** *sn5 ) ... ... .

) then , the total differential coefficient of every such element or function zi , taken with respect to the time , ( both as it enters explicitly and implicitly into the expressions ( 54 .
) , ) must vanish in the undisturbed motion ; so that , by the differential equations of such motion ( H. ) , the following general relation must be rigorously and identically true : ~gi\(~a s S1 r s ; " * &lt; H1 ' xt + : X~_ H ... ... . .
( 56 .
) In passing to disturbed motion , if we retain the equation ( 54 .
) as a definition of the quantity zi , that quantity will no longer be constant , but it will continue to satisfy the inverse relations ( 55 .
) , and may be called , by analogy , a varying element of the motion ; and its total differential coefficient , taken with respect to the time , may , by the identical equation ( 56 .

Now it is remarkable that this elimination removes the symbol t also , and leaves the coefficients ai , s expressed as functions of the elements z alone , not explicitly involving the time .
This general theorem of dynamics , which is , perhaps , a little more extensive than the analogous results discovered by LAGRANGE and by POISSON , since it does not limit the disturbing terms in the differential equations of motion to depend on the configuration only , may be investigated in the following way .
15 .
The sign of summation Z in ( C1 .
) , like the same sign in those other analogous equations in which it has already occurred without an index in this Essay , refers not to the expressed indices , such as here i , s , in the quantity to be summned , but to an index which is not expressed , and which may be here called r ; so that if we introduce for greater clearness this variable index and its limits , the expression ( C ' .

The most natural choice of these elements is that which makes them correspond , in undisturbed motion , to the initial quantities ei pi .

I ( 75 .
) But it has been proved that these coefficients as , when expressed as functions of the elements , do not contain the time explicitly ; and the supposition t=0 introduces no relation between those 6n elements z Xi , which still remain independent : the coefficients a , , , therefore , could not acquire the values 1 , 0 , -1 , by the supposition t= 0 , unless they had those values constantly , and independently of that supposition .
The differential equations of the forms ( B ' .
) , may therefore be expressed , for the present system of varying elements , in the following simpler way : d , i _H di_ aH _1 d7t 8 .
; d-tX ; ... ... ... . .

The initial values of the varying elements xi Xi are evidently ej pi , by the definitions ( 72 .
) , and by the identical equations ( 71 .
) ; the problem of integrating rigorously the equations of disturbed motion ( G. ) , between the variables 7i m and the time , or of determining these variables as functions of the time and of their own initial values ei pi , is therefore rigorously transformed into the problem of integrating the equations ( G1 .
) , or of determining the 6n elements xi ?
x as functions of the time and of the same initial values .
The chief advantage of this transformation is , that if the perturbations be small , the new variables ( namely , the elements , ) alter but little : and that , since the new differential equations are of the same form as the old , they may be integrated by a similar method .
Considering , therefore , the definite integral E =Jt ( as a function of the time and of the 6n quantities xi , 2 , ... r , el , e2 , ... 3 , , , , and observing that its variation , taken with respect to the latter quantities , may be shown by a process sinlilar to that of the fourth number of this Essay to be E= _ .
( .

) we find that the rigorous integrals of the differential equations ( G1 .
) may be expressed in the following manner : aE6Ei -= sx Pi ... .(K ' .
) in which there enters only one unknown function of elements E , to the search and study of which single function the problem of perturbation is reduced by this new method .
We might also have put C= ( -f Q. Z ?
2+ H12 ) dt , ... ... ... .(77 .
) and have considered this definite integral C as a function of the time and of the 6n quantities.j pi ; and then we should have found the following other forms for the integrals of the differential equations of varying elements , acc Zi= ++ e - ... ..(Li .
) z ^i And each of these functions of elements , C and E , must satisfy a certain partial differential equation , analogous to the first equation of each pair mentioned in the sixth number of this Essay , and deduced on similar principles .
18 .
Thus , it is evident , by the form of the function E , and by the equations ( K1 .
) , ( G ' .
) , and ( 76 .
) , that the partial differential coefficient of this function , taken with respect to the time , is aE dE aE dx t dt 't dt 2 ; ... ( M. ) and therefore that if we separate this function E into any two parts E1 +E E , ... ... ... ... ... .(N ' .

( 01 .

Our general method in dynamics , though intended chiefly for the study of attracting and repelling systems , is not confined to such , but may be used in all questions to which the law of living forces applies .
And all the analysis of this Essay , but especially the theory of perturbations , may usefully be illustrated by the following analogous reasonings and results respecting the motion of a single point .
Imagine then such a point , having for its three rectangular coordinates xy z , and moving in an orbit determined by three ordinary differential equations of the second order of forms analogous to the equations ( 2 .

If we express , for greater generality or facility , the rectangular coordinates xyz as functions of three other marks of position '1 '22 '23 , T will become a homogeneous function of the second dimension of their first differential coefficients '1l 4'22 '3 taken with respect to the time and if we put , for abridgement , aT AT sT 1~ = 7 , 2= ~2 , ~ =3,. .

We may also put , for abridgement , F ( 1 , 2 , 3a 12 , '22 , '3 ) U ( n '2 , 43 ) = H ; I in which e , e2 e3 PI P2 p3 are the initial values , or values at the time 0 , of 41 a2 '3 mw1 2 3 ; and S is the definite integral S = , ,q( 8H _s=j( +1 +t 3-)dt , ... ... . .

) 8t +F ( , 8 e , 8 , , ee2 , e3 U ( el , e2 , e3 ) .
This iimportant function S , which may be called the principalfunction of the motion , may hence be rigorously expressed under the following form , obtained by reasonings analogous to those of the seventh number of this Essay : s -S +J +U ( 40 ; 2 ) 43)dtF a , - ' F8S _ SI S 8S BS 8S1\1 |n +/ o N1 8(1 X )e i^s 6n3d J S1 being any arbitrary function of the same quantities '1 '12 1s3 el e2 e3 t , so chosen as to vanish with the time .
And if this arbitrary function S1 be chosen so as to be a first approximate value of the principal function S , we may neglect , in a second approximation , the second definite integral in ( 87 .
) .

A first approximation of this kind can be obtained , whenever , by separating the expression H , ( 82 .
) , into a predominant and a smaller part , H1 and H2 , and by neglecting the part H,2 we have changed the differential equations ( 83 .
) to others , namely , d - , a Hi d2 =a H1I dq3 a I1 1 dt = 8 ?

For the principal function of such undisturbed motion , namely , the definite integral S1 =Ij ( 1 l +.2 2+3 -3 8 -aH1 ) d t. .
( 89 .
) considered as a function of 1 r2 e e3 el t , will then be an approximate value for the original function of disturbed motion S , which original function corresponds to the more complex differential equations , Q2 115 and z1 =1 ( t , 1 ) , -29 P3 , 19 , 29 , ,3 ) , 1 a2 = ~2 ( t , l , 2 , 3 ) ' 1 ' 2 , k 3 ) , &gt; ... ...

To determine these six varying elements , we may employ the six following rigorous equations in ordinary differentials of the first order , in which H2 is supposed to have been expressed by ( 103 .
) and ( 104 .
) as a function of the elements and of the time : dx1 ~ H2 die 9a Ha dX a H2 1 dta,1 ' dt % ' dt ( 105 .

Returning now from this simpler motion to the more complex motion first mentioned , and denoting by S2 the disturbing part or function which must be added to S , in order to make up the whole principal function S of that more complex motion ; we have , by applying our general method , the following rigorous expression for this disturbing function , S2 =-_J H2 dt+ { ( s , + ( s\a } t , .
( 134 .
) in which we may , approximately , neglect the second definite integral , and calculate the first by the help of the equations of undisturbed motion .
In this manner we find , approximately , by ( 125 .
) ( 127 .
) , -H2 =(el -+3 P t,2 + ( e2 + P2 t2 }g t2)2 , ( 135 .
) and therefore , by integration , S2 = ---2 { p2 ( e12 + e22 ) + v2 e32 } t -{O2 ( el pl + e2 P2 ) + V2 e3 p3 } t2 1 3i 1 &gt; ( 136 .

Accordingly , if we develope the rigorous integrals of disturbed motion , ( 113 .
) and ( 114 .
) , as far as the squares ( inclusive ) of the small quantities p{ and V , we are conducted to these approximate integrals ; and if we develope the rigorous expression ( 120 .
) for the principal function of such motion , to the same degree of accuracy , we obtain the sum of the two expressions ( 130 .
) and ( 137 .
) .
27 .
To illustrate still further , in the present example , our general method of successive approximation , let S3 denote the small unknown correction of the approximate expression ( 137 .
) , so that we shall now have , rigorously , for the present disturbed motion , S= S12 + S3 ... ... ... ... .
( 142 .
) S1 and S2 being here determined rigorously by ( 130 .
) and ( 137 .

Then , substituting SI + S2 for Si in the general transformation ( 87 .
) , we find , rigorously , in the present question , S3. .

) for R2 123 the coordinates of disturbed motion .
In this manner we obtain the very approximate expression , 4t418f t KS3-t2 1+ el + ; 72 + e2 dt -iJ-t2 n -3 -+ -e3 +g t2 ) dt -= 360 ( 4 12+ 7l el +4 e2 + 42 +72e2+ 4 e2 ) ( 144 , ) V4 13 y4o 5 17 v4 g t7 ' 60 ( 4 32 +73 e3 +4 e32 ) 40 ( +3 + e3 ) 40Ot0 / x6t5 ( 92 + '81 el + el12 +,2 +2 e2 + e2 __ts +2 31 , ,2 ) gt7t( + 3 ) gf+t1 ; 945 3 +16 3e3 '+ e3 J403'20 725760 which is accordingly the sum of the terms of the fourth and sixth dimensions in the development of the rigorous expression ( 120 .
) , and gives , by our general method , correspondingly approximate expressions for the integrals of disturbed motion , under the forms 8SS8 S3 WI= 8S +,8 + 883 aS , a S2 a S3 P 2= ' +~ ' ... ... ... ... . .

To illustrate by the same example the theory of gradually varying elements , let us establish the following definitions , for the present disturbed motion , a1 = '1 t , 22~n t : 3=1 '03tv tft 2 , ~1 -'1 , ?
'2 Y2 , 3%+g t , and let us call these six quantities z , X2 Z3 xi XA2 3 the varyzinag elements of that motion , by analogy to the six constant quantities el e2 e3 Pl P2 p3 , which may , for the undisturbed motion , be represented in a similar way , namely , by ( 127 .

) P1-1 ) P2=g2 , p3=(3+gIt J Pi = l , 1 P2 w , P3 -= '3 +g t. J We shall then have rigorously , for the six disturbed variables v1 r2 v3 l w32 , expressions of the same forms as in the integrals ( 127 .
) and ( 128 .
) of undisturbed motion , but with variable instead of constant elements , namely , the following : 71 += 1+ i2 t , =3= x3 + X3 tg t2 , WlJ == hl~ W2 == " 25 Z3 -= 3-g t ; and the rigorous determination of the six varying elements z1 X2 X3 XI X3 , as functions of the time and of their own initial values el e2 e3 PI P2 p3 , depends on the integration of the 6 following equations , in ordinary differentials of the first order , of the forms ( 105 .
) : dt=A=2t ( x2 + t ) , dx2 = -2 t ( 2 + t ) , ... ... . .

) which is obtained from ( 125 .
) by substituting for the disturbed coordinates w1 42 83 their values ( 149 .
) , as functions of the varying elements and of the time .
It is not difficult to integrate rigorously this system of equations ( 150 .
) and ( 151 .
) ; and we shall soon have occasion to state their complete and accurate integrals : but we shall continue for a while to treat these rigorous integrals as unknown , that we may take this opportunity to exemplify our general method of indefinite approximation , for all such dynamical questions , founded on the properties of the functions of elements C and E. Of these two functions either may be employed , and we shall use here the function C. 29 .
This function , by ( 109 .
) and ( 152 .
) , may rigorously be expressed as follows : 125 = o2 ( X12 t2 + X2 2_ 2 ) dt Q A2 I ( l rV + -T , { A3 t2)2 }X dj and has therefore the following for a first approximate value , obtained by treating the elements z %2 Z3 1i X2 X3 as constant and equal to their initial values e1 e2 e3 PI Ps P3 , C=2(+ e22 ) + p2 ( pl2 + p22 ) +,232 ( 154 .

The rigorous function C must satisfy , in the present question , by the principles of the eighteenth number , the partial differential equation , aC t{cC a ) 2(ac22 ax{ I ' +F A2 + i2 t}+ 3t -2 g t2 ) ( 158 .

) , C= Cl + C2 , C , being a first approximation , supposed to vanish with the time , then the correction C2 must satisfy rigorously the condition 126 3i I , Accordingly , these rigorous expressions for the 6 varying elements , in the present dynamical question , agree with the results obtained by the ordinary methods of integration from the 6 ordinary differential equations ( 150 .
) and ( 151 .
) , and with those obtained by elimination from the equations ( 113 .
) ( 114 .
) ( 147 .

Remarks on the foregoing Example .
30 .
The example which has occupied us in the last six numbers is not aitogether ideal , but is realised to some extent by the motion of a projectile in a void .
For if we consider the earth as a sphere , of radius R , and suppose the accelerating force of gravity to vary inversely as the square of the distance r from its centre , and to be 1 R2 =g at the surface , this force will be represented generally by and to adapt the differential equations ( 78 .
) to the motion of a projectile in a void , it will be sufficient to make U=g R ) ... ... ... . .
( 173 .
) If we place the origin of rectangular coordinates at the earth 's surface , and suppose the semiaxis of +z to be directed vertically upwards , we shall have r= J(R + z)2 + y2 , ... ... ... .

) and YT-2 g +ss ^+.2 ) U= ---g g ( xi+ ... .
a e. * ( 175 .
) neglecting only those very small terms which have the square of the earth 's radius for a divisor : neglecting therefore such terms , the force-function U in this question is of that form ( 110 .
) on which all the reasonings of the example have been founded ; the small constants p , v , being the real and imaginary quantities / , / -respectively .
We may therefore apply the results of the recent numbers to the motions of projectiles in a void , by substituting these values for the constants , and altering , where necessary , trigonometrical to exponential functions .
But besides the theoretical facility and the little practical importance of researches respecting such projectiles , the results would only be accurate as far as the first negative power ( inclusive ) of the earth 's radius , because the expression ( 110 .
) for the force-function U is only accurate so far ; and therefore the rigorous and approximate investigations of the six preceding numbers , founded on that expression , are offered only as mathematical illustrations of a general method , extending to all problems of dynamics , at least to all those to which the law of living forces applies .

) , between the 6n 6 variables T x ' , y ' , ' , and the time , are forms for the differential equations of internal or relative motion .
We might eliminate the 3 n3 auxiliary variables x ' , y , z ' , betweenr these last equations , and so obtain the following other group of 3n3 equatios of the second order , involving only the relative coordinates and the time , ma+ mn : E IF 1aUI au 1 FU 1 Eu J L &gt; ?

) , omitting , however , for simplicity , the lower accents of the auxiliary variables x ' , y ' , z ' , , because it is easy to prove that these auxiliary variables ( 180 .
) are the components of centrobaric velocity , and because , in investigating the properties of internal or relative motion , we are at liberty to suppose that the centre of gravity of the system is fixed in space , at the origin of xy z. We may also , for simplicity , omit the lower accent of 2 , , understanding that the summations are to fall only on the first n1 masses , and denoting for greater distinctness the nth mass by a separate symbol M ; and then we 132 may comprise the differential equations of relative motion in the following simplified formula , dtH-= .

) .
Second Example : Case of a Ternary or Multiple System with one Predominant Mass ; Equations of the undisturbed motions of the other masses about this , in their several Binary Systems ; Differentials of all their Elements , expressed by the coefficients of one Disturbing Function .

Let us now suppose that the n1 masses m are small in comparison with the nth mass M ; and let us separate the expression ( F2 .
) for H into the two following parts , HI = 2i.i ( 1+ M)(x2 + y2 +1-'2)-M .

Suppressing it accordingly , we are conducted to the following 6n 6 differential equations of the 1st orlder , belonging to a simpler motion , which nay be called the undisturbed : d14 .

) with five other equations analogous , for the five other elements x , , v , v , w , in any one binary system ( n , M ) .

Returning now to the original multiple system , we may retain as definitions the equations ( K2 .
) , but then we can no longer consider the elements x. X. p. u. r. .
of the binary system ( m. , M ) as constant , because this system is now disturbed by the other masses m , ; however , the 6n 6 equations of disturbed relative motion , when put under the forms da H , aH d ' x H1 a H2 da H !

And if we express d7a y ' z ' , and therefore H2 itself , as depending on the time and on these varying elements , we may transform the 6 n6 differential equations of the 1st order , ( M2 .

It is evident that these symbols have the properties , { X , I } _-{ , X } , { XI } = 0 ; ... ... ... ( 184 .
) and it results from the principles of the 15th number , that these combinations { x , } , &amp; c , , when expressed as functions of the elements , do not contain the tiIne explicitly .
There are in general , by ( 184 .
) , only 15 such distinct combinations for each of the n1 binary systems ; but there would thus be , in all , 15 n 15 , if they admitted of no further reductions : however , it results from the principles of the 16th number , that 12 n12 of these combinations may be made to vanish by a suitable choice of the elements .
The following is another way of effecting as great a simplification , at least for that extensive class of cases in which the undisturbed distance between the two points of each binary system ( m , M ) admits of a minimum value .

When the undisturbed distance r of m from M admits of such a minimum q , corresponding to a time r , and satisfying at that time the conditions rOr &gt; 0 e , , ... .
o. o ... ... ( 185 .
) then the integrals of the group ( 12 .
) , or the known rules of the undisturbed motion of m about M , may be presented in the following manner : = { ( iy ^82+( zy')2 +( I ; )2 } = DI+m ( X'2 +y z2 + 2'2)-Mf ( r ) ; =tan .

) and sin ' s , ta n't , being used ( according to Sir JOHN HERSCHEL'S notation ) to express , not the cosecant and cotangent , but the inversefunctions corresponding to sine and cosine , or the arcs which are more commonly called arc ( sin = s ) , arc ( tan = t ) .
dr It must also be observed that the factor , which we have introduced under the signs of integration , is not superfluous , but is designed to be taken as equal to positive or negative unity , according as dr is positive or negative ; that is , according as r is increasing or diminishing , so as to make the element under each integral sign constantly positive .
In general , it appears to be a useful rule , though not always followed by analysts , to employ the real radical symbol J/ R only for positive quantities , unless the negative sign be expressly prefixed ; and then , will denote positive or negative unity , according as r is positive or negative .
The arc given by its sine , in the expression of the element w , is supposed to be so chosen as to increase continually with the time .
35 .
After these remarks on the notation , let us apply the formula ( P2 .
) to calculate the values of the 15 combinations such as { z , X } , of the 6 constants or elements ( Q2 .
) .
Since r== ( 2 + , + .
+.2 ... .
( 187 .
) it is easy to perceive that the six combinations of the 4 first elements are as follows : { , X}= 0 , { z , )p } 0 , { z , v } = 0 , { X)p-0 , { x ) , }= 1 , { P , v } = 0. .
( 188 .
) To form the 4 combinations of these 4 first elenlents with r , we may observe , that this 5th element r , as expressed in ( Q2 .
) , involves explicitly ( besides the time ) the distance r , and the two elements z , fp ; but the combinations already determined show that these two elements may be treated as constant in forming the four combinations now sought ; we need only attend , therefore , to the variation of r , and if we interpret by the rule ( P2 .
) the symbols { z , r } { X , r } { &amp; , r } { v , r } , and attend to the equations ( I2 .
) , we see that dr { , r } = 0 , { ; , r } = 0 , { c , r } = -- ' { v , r } = 0 , ... ( 189 .
) dr -d being the total differential coefficient of r in the undisturbed motion , as determined by the equations ( I2 .
) ; and , therefore , that { z( , }= 0 , , , { v , r } = , ... . .
( 190 .
) and 'r dr dt dr { , }= -r dt= +=t ** in which , if e be any of the first five elements , or the distance r , Iae ae le ae { e , r } =-r ( - ' + -Y+ C a ' ) , { e }= -ez , { e , , z } = 0 , .
( 193 .
) and w_ Ax)\1 ax w dg w 8o a t^ ) 8r = rT^ y^= 1$ ; ... ... ... ( 194 .
) the formula ( 192 .
) may therefore be thus written : ae aee ?
+ tt + &gt; Y+^ ' -^'J^ 7 xl |. .
( 195 .
) + { e , v } + 8x { e , }+ { e , } .
J We easily find , by this formula , that dr aow { %x , } =-1 ; { k , o } = 0 ; { ( , c } = 0 ; { r , o )= dt ... ( 196 .
) and av 8 &lt; O Xco { ,.}.=r ?
.8 4i= - ?
-* ** * ... *. .
*~..(197 .
) The formula ( 195 .
) extends to the combination { r , w } also ; but in calculating this last combination we are to remember that r is given by ( Q2 .
) as a function of x , , r , such that BT dt r. .
= -d ; *. .
* * .
** ( 198 .
) and thus we see , with the help of the combinations ( 196 .
) already determined , that { , =o } = ---= / dr+Jr dr , ... . .
( 199 .
) if we represent for abridgement by 0 , and Q , r the coefficients of dr under the integral signs in ( Q2 .
) , namely , OrVM +v{2pj+2Mf(r)M ?
r^}n J M\/ .M { 2+M _M m x } -i+J culty were not occasioned by the necessity of varying the lower limit q , which depends on those two elements , and by the circumstance that at this lower limit the coefficients 0 , C , become infinite .
However , the relation ( 202 .
) shows that we may express this combination ( { , w } as follows : ^='+ jfrdr j+rdr , ... ... .
( 203 .
) r , being an auxiliary and arbitrary quantity , which cannot really affect the result , but may be made to facilitate the calculation ; or in other words , we may assign to the distance r any arbitrary value , not varying for infinitesimal variations of z , , which may assist in calculating the value of the expression ( 199 .
) .
We may therefore suppose that the increase of distance rq is small , and corresponds to a small positive interval of time t r , during which the distance r and its differential coefficient r ' are constantly increasing ; and then after the first moment s , the quantity , = ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
( 204 .
) will be constantly finite , positive , and decreasing , during the same interval , so that its integral must be greater than if it had constantly its final value ; that is , t-'f =rdr &gt; ( r-q ) ... ... ... .(205 .
) Hence , although @r tends to infinity , yet ( r q ) , r tends to zero , when by diminishing the interval we make r tend to q ; and therefore the following difference rr* M+nMx rM +m nr Kx x\ J lr , drM Jf d , drM= m , \-)O,.rdr , .
( 206 .
) will also tend to 0 , and so will also its partial differential coefficient of the first order , taken with respect to t. We find therefore the following formula for { r , w } , ( remembering that this combination has been shown to be independent of r , ) { fo } r{ ordr + dr .
( 207 .
) the sign implying that the limit is to be taken to which the expression tends r when r tends to q. In this last formula , as in ( 199 .
) , the integralJf Or dr may be considered as a known function of r , q , p , , or simply of r , q , z , if pJ be eliminated by the first , condition ( 186 .
) ; , and since it vanishes independently of X when r= q , it may be thus denoted : f"e , r -=(r , q , ) -p ( q ) , ... ... ... .
( 208 .
) the form of the function p depending on the law of attraction or repulsion .
This integral therefore , when considered as depending on z and p , by depending on z and q , need not be varied with respect to z , in calculating { r , w } by ( 207 .
) , because 138 its partial differential coefficient ( O dr ) , obtained by treating q as constant , vanishes at the limit r= q ; nor need it be varied with respect to q , because , by ( 186 .
) , S +x +M_o= ' .
' ... ... ... ... ... ( 209 .
) it may therefore be treated as constant , and we find at last { , } == o ... ... ... ... ... ... ( 210 .
) the two terms ( 199 .
) or ( 203 .
) both tending to infinity when r tends to q , but always destroying each other .
36 .
Collecting now our results , and presenting for greater clearness each combination under the two forms in which it occurs when the order of the elements is changed , we have , for each binary system , the following thirty expressions : { bX } =O , ( , } ) = 0 , { ( 0 { } =0 , { ( r , } 0 , { ( , } 10 , { , X } = o , { , , { , , r } = 0 , I , , } = , { , , { } =0 ( V , ) } = 0 , ( { r , i } =1 , { r , } I= , { { , } 0 , { }= 0 , { ~ , x ) = o , ( { , A } o , ( { , }0 ) l , ( i , Y } o , ( C , ~ } = o , J ( { } -= 1 , { c , X } = , { , , c } = 0 , { ) } = 0 , { , = } = 0 ; so that the three combinations { d,7 } { S ) , } { X , V } are each equal to positive unity ; the three inverse combinations { V ' , t } Q{X4 ) } { v , } are each equal to negative unity ; and all the others vanish .
The six differential equations of the first order , for the 6 varying elements of any one binary system ( m , M ) , are therefore , by ( 02 .
) , dyp l Hi dr 8l H~d_ _ , -dc _ _ .
dt , dt-8 , m X. .
daa Ha dYr Ha M Ay 5 H2 _ m-dr a , ( S-- ) m dt - , , 7 dt BA'J and , if we still omit the variation of t , they may all be summed up in this form for the variation of H2 , S H2 = .

( T2 .
) which single formula enables us to derive all the 6n6 differential equations of the first order , for all the varying elements of all the binary systems , from the variation or from the partial differential coefficients of a single quantity Hz , expressed as a function of those elements .
T2 139 If we choose to introduce into the expression ( T2 .
) , for S H2 , the variation of the time t , we have only to change 6r to rS t , because , by ( Q2 .
) , St enters only so accompanied ; that is , t enters only under the form ti , in the expressions of i i % 'i y ' ' as functions of the time and of the elements ; we have , therefore , a =H -S^ _ =a _ E.mf &gt; ; ? .

( 211 .
) and since , by ( H2 .
) , ( Q2 .
) , HI= M , .
m * , ( 212 .
) we find finally , d l. ( H2 .
) dt = at ( 2 .
) This remarkable form for the differential of I-I , considered as a varying element , is general for all problems of dynamics .
It may be deduced by the general method from the formulae of the 13th and 14th numbers , which give dHi allg aH l ax , f+ l8x8xr a HI a X6 na H , ax6ni dt ax1\ a a3 aiB a1 n 6\a w 6w s. _+ J i-X , 6 at , 6 E^z 6 xz 6 '1~E , 6 x , ,(213 .

) be treated as constant .
It is also a remarkable corollary of the general principles just referred to , but one not difficult to verify , that the first partial differential coefficient tof any element x , , taken with respect to the time , may be expressed as a function of the elements alone , not involving the time explicitly .
On the essential distinction between the Systems of Varying Elements considered in this Essay and those hitherto employed by mathematicians .
37 .
When we shall have integrated the differential equations of varying elements ( S2 .
) , we can then calculate the varying relative coordinates a4 &amp; , for any binary system ( m , M ) , by the rules of undisturbed motion , as expressed by the equations ( I2 .
) , ( Q2 .
) , or by the following connected formulae : =r ( cos O+ sin(O -v ) sin , ) Xv=r ( sin 0 sin ( d-v ) cos v ) , L ... ... ... ( V2 .
) = xr / 2 AX X2 sin ( 0 -Y ) 140 in which the distance r is determined as a function of the time t and of the elements z , Z , ( , by the 5th equation ( Q2 .
) , and in which / M+ m dr xd r , / g , M r2 r2 V 2pr +2 Mf(r)-N~i x'( q being still the minimum of r , when the orbit is treated as constant , and being still connected with the elements z , ( , by the first equation of condition ( 186 .
) .
In astronomical language , M is the sun , ma planet , M ; t are the heliocentric rectangular coordinates , r is the radius vector , 0 the longitude in the orbit , w the longitude of the perihelion , v of the node , 0w is the true anomaly , 0y the argument of latitude , lp the constant part of the half square of undisturbed heliocentric velocity , diminished in the ratio of the sun 's mass ( M ) to the sum ( M + m ) of masses of sun and planet , ; is the double of the areal velocity diminished in the same ratio , x is the versed sine of the inclination of the orbit , q the perihelion distance , and r the time of perihelion passage .
The law of attraction or repulsion is here left undetermined ; for NEWTON'S law , p , is the sun 's mass divided by the axis major of the orbit taken negatively , and z is the square root of the semiparameter , multiplied by the sun 's mass , and divided by the square root of the sum of the masses of sun and planet .
But the varying ellipse or other orbit , which the foregoing formulae require , differs essentially ( though little ) from that hitherto employed by astronomers : because it gives correctly the heliocentric coordinates , but not the heliocentric components of velocity , without differentiating the elements in the calculation ; and therefore does not touch , but cuts , ( though under a very small angle , ) the actual heliocentric orbit , described under the influence of all the disturbing forces .
38 .
For it results from the foregoing theory , that if we differentiate the expressions ( V2 .
) for the heliocentric coordinates , without differentiating the elements , and then assign to those new varying elements their values as functions of the time , obtained from the equations ( S2 .
) , and deduce the centrobaric components of velocity by the formulae ( I2 .
) , or by the following : _M__ , _M l_MM X'--M+ mY =M+m ' * .
'. .
( 214 .
) then these centrobaric coniponents will be the same functions of the time and of the new varying elements which might be otherwise deduced by elimination from the integrals ( Q2 .
) , and will represent rigorously ( by the extension given in the theory to those last-mentioned integrals ) the components of velocity of the disturbed planet m , relatively to the centre of gravity of the whole solar system .
We chose , as more suitable to the general course of our method , that these centrobaric components of velocity should be the auxiliary variables to be combined with the heliocentric coordinates , and to have their disturbed values rigorously expressed by the formulae 141 of undisturbed motion ; but in making this choice it became necessary to modify these latter formulae , and to determine a varying orbit essentially distinct in theory ( though little differing in practice ) from that conceived so beautifully by LAGRANGE .
The orbit which he imagined was more simply connected with the heliocentric motion of a single planet , since it gave , for such heliocentric motion , the velocity as well as the position ; the orbit which we have chosen is perhaps more closely combined with the conception of a multiple system , moving sibout its common centre of gravity , and influenced in every part by the actions of all the rest .
Whichever orbit shall be hereafter adopted by astronomers , they will remember that both are equally fit to represent the celestial appearances , if the numeric elements of either set be suitably determined by observation , and the elements of the other set of orbits be deduced from these by calculation .
Meantime mathematicians will judge , whether in sacrificing a part of the simplicity of that geometrical conception on which the theories of LAGRANGE and POISSON are founded , a simplicity of another kind has not been introduced , which was wanting in those admirable theories ; by our having succeeded in expressing rigorously the differentials of all our own new varying elements through the coefficients of a single function : whereas it has seemed necessary hitherto to employ one function for the Earth disturbed by Venus , and another function for Venus disturbed by the Earth .
Integration of the Simpljfied Equations , which determine the new varying Elements .
39 .
The simplified differential equations of varying elements , ( S2 .
) , are of the same form as the equations ( A. ) , and may be integrated in a similar manner .
If we put , for abridgement , ( r,7 ) f{+ ( + Z+ Y )H2 d dt,. .
( X2 .
) and interpret similarly the symbols ( p , w , ?
) , &amp;c. , we can easily assign the variations of the following 8 combinations , ( r , % , v ) ( p , 0 , ; ) ( p , z , v ) ( r , % , X ) ( r , , v ) ( P , z , x ) ( r , , k ) ( p. , ) , v ) namely , ( ( , z , v ) = 0 .

m ( o +ro -r +oo -+ +oo ) H1 2 t , so o 1po Po To wo being the initial values of the varying elements XX p. vr w. If , then , we consider , for example , the first of these 8 combinations ( r , x , v ) , as a function of 142 all the 3n3 elements 'i wi i , and of their initial values po , i w , i % , iinvolving also in general the time explicitly , we shall have the following forms for the 6n6 rigorous integrals of the 6 n6 equations ( S2 .
) : i"i -8i ( 8 , , " ) ; M no , i= --Z ( , m , T ) ; o Mi p =o , i , m -ii ) ; m ao , J-- , -nz , i Z.0 P ' , i and in like manner we can deduce forms for the same rigorous integrals , from any one of the eight combinations ( y2 .
) .
The determination of all the varying elements would therefore be fully accomplished , if we could find the complete expression for any one of these 8 combinations .
40 .
A first approximate expression for any one of them can be found from the form under which we have supposed H2 to be put , namely , as a function of the elements and of the time , which may be thus denoted : ~~~~~~~H2 ~~~~= HIt2~~~~ ( 14 1* - ?
n ) ( A3 .
) by changing in this function the varying elements to their initial values , and employing the following approximate integrals of the equations ( S2 .
) , Io lt=H dt , a=oa H2 dt , =+w +o +S=zd t , o dt,. .
( B3 .
) 0z Imo aXmo owB 1 t^B Hdt , 1J0a mo OQ o Ao For if we denote , for example , the first of the 8 combinations ( Y2 .
) by G , so that G= { r , , ... ... ... ... ... ... ( C3 .
) we shall have , as a first approximate value , G1=Jo aa ?
_o 0o 2-H jd t ; .
( D3 .
) and after thus expressing G as a functionof the time , and of the nd initial elements , we can eliminate the initial quantities of the forms T so up , and introduce in their stead the final quantities pw X , so as to obtain an expression for G1 of the kind supposed in ( Z2 .
) , namely , a function of the time t , the varying elements pw X , and their initial values p Wo % .
An approximate expression thus found may be corrected by a process of that kind , which has often been employed in this Essay for other similar purposes .
For the function G , or the combination ( r , , v ) , must satisfy rigorously , by ( Y2 .
) ( A3 .
) , the following partial differential equation : 143 a I1 aG laG1 aG 1 GG ( EG - ?
=t + H2 t , ml- , 0^ A , ' ml81 ' ( E. ) and each of the other analogous functions or combinations ( Y2 .
) must satisfy an analogous equation : if then we change G to G1 + G2 , and neglect the squares and products of the coefficients of the small correction G2 , Gl being a first approximation such as that already found , we are conducted , as a second approximation , on principles already explained , to the following expression for this correction G2 : t aG ia GI Ia GI ia GI 1 ( .
) -G2=-o { = G1 + H2(t mt , I t11 , d ( F31 which may be continually and indefinitely improved by a repetition of the same process of correction .
We may therefore , theoretically , consider the problem as solved ; but it must remain for future consideration , and perhaps for actual trial , to determine which of all these various processes of successive and indefinite approximation , deduced in the present Essay and in the former , as corollaries of one general Method , and as consequences of one central Idea , is best adapted for numeric application , and for the mathematical study of phenomena .
