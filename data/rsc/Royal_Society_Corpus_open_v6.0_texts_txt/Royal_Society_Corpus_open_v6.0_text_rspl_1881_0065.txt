Ciliated epithelial cells are found in the thymus of the dog : this is not the case in quite young animals , but ciliated epithelium can always be demonstrated in the thymus of a dog over thirty months old , and often in those of much younger animals .
In the older dogs the ciliated cells are found lining cysts , and the cysts appeal to increase in size with the age of the animal .
The ciliated epithelial cells take origin from connective tissue corpuscles .
The connective tissue corpuscles forming the network in the medullary poition are in places massed together , forming concentric corpuscles of small size ; in these masses small cavities are formed , and the lining cells are transformed into ciliated cells .
In the thymus of the tortoise small cavities are found lined by columnar epithelium .
The epithelial cells arise from connective tissue corpuscles , the process being essentially the same as that just desci ibed in the dog .
The fluid in the lymphatic vessels leading from the thymus can be obtained by tying the vessels immediately after death .
The lymph thus obtained contains considerably more colourless corpuscles than the lymph of the large lymphatic vessels of the neck .
The blood in the veins passing from the thymus does not appear to differ from the blood of the jugular vein .

( Abstract .
) The experiments ( over 900 in number ) were made on the skull and long bones of sheep , the ribs of oxen , and on the brain and skin of sheep .
Thermo-electric apparatus was employed in the work .
The different tissues were thus prepared :\#151 ; In the case of bone , a fresh piece was ground smooth on one side , and the face of the thermopile accurately fitted to it ; then a thin coating of shellac varnish was applied to the surface of the bone and to the face of the pile , and firm pressure was maintained until the varnish was dry and permanent Dr. J. S. Lombard .
the Propagation of [ Nov. 17 , adhesion between the bone and the pile had taken place .
The whole pile , and the bone , to within a couple of millimetres of its free surface , was then wrapped in thick layers of cotton wool soaked in melted paraffine , these layers extending beyond the upper end of the pile and along the conducting wires for a little distance .
In the cases of brain-tissue and skin , a pasteboard box was taken and filled with melted paraffine .
When the latter had solidified , a hole was cut through the centre of the paraffine of the size of the piece of brain or skin , and the pasteboard bottom corresponding to the hole removed , and its place supplied by a thin copper plate .
The piece of tissue was then inserted in the hole in the paraffine , until it rested on the copper plate , the pile was then passed into the hole and pressed firmly upon the piece of brain or skin , being kept in place by wedges of cotton wool thrust between the sides of the pile and the paraffine walls surrounding it .
The free end of the bone , or the copper plate of the box , * was brought in contact with water of the desired temperature , this temperature being tested by both thermo-electric apparatus and thermometers .
The differences of temperature to which the tissues were subjected ranged from 0o,1136 C. to 0'*1645 C. We have to consider , first , the time required for th sign of the change of temperature to show itself through the pieces of bone , brain , and skin .
The following figures show the times required for 0''l C. to show itself through 7'5 millims. of sheep 's skull , 7'5 millims. of upper surface of sheep 's cerebrum , and 3 millims. of sheep 's scalp respectively .

( Abstract .
) I have endeavoured in this abstract to summarise the results of my recent researches into the minute structure of the brain in the smaller Rodents .
The pig and sheep , which were the subjects of my former memoir , possess a highly developed olfactory apparatus conjoined to a well convoluted cortical surface ; but in the smaller animals now under consideration the surface of the hemispheres is almost perfectly smooth , while the olfactory organ , from its comparative size and complex relationship , has an important part to play in the architecture of the brain .
Animals possessing the latter type of cerebrum have been classed together as the Osmatic Lissencephales , in contradistinction to those which were the subject of my former enquiries , the Osmatic Gyren-cephales .
My researches into the structure of the brain of prominent members of the former group , viz. , the rabbit and rat , may be considered under two heads :\#151 ; ( a. ) The histology of the complete cortical envelope .
