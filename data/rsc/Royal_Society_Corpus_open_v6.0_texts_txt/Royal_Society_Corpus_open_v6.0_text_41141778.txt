Observations on the diurnal variation of the / magnetic needle , at the Whale Fish Islands , Davis9 s Strait .
By Lieutenant Henry Foster , R. N. F. R. S. Jlrevious to leaving England in the spring of 1824 , 1 had determined upon making a series of observations on the daily variation of the magnetic needle , during our stay , at the different places which might be visited by the Expedition .
Accordingly , soon after our arrival at the Whale Fish Islands , for the purpose of transhipping the stores from the Transport which had accompanied us thus far ; the instrument for observing the diurnal variation was landed , and placed on a pedestal in a small octagonal observatory .
The length of the needle was 11 inches , and weighed 120 grains ; it rested on a pivot ; and its direction when the sun was on the magnetic meridian I assumed , for distinction 's sake , the zero of my scale .
The observations were continued for three days only ; and as the brass work of the instrument was afterwards found to be magnetic , the results obtained are , of course , too doubtful to be considered of any great value taken singly ; but as it was these observations which first indicated to me the agency of the sun , in producing the interesting phenomenon of the daily variation , I have thought it right to give them in detail , together with such remarks as occurred to me at this early stage of the enquiry , as preliminary to the more extended and exact observations made at Port Bowen by Captain Parry , the other Officers of the Expedition , and myself , an account of which accompanies this communication to the Royal Society .
