XXII .
Determination of the North Polar Distances and proper motion of thirty fixed Stars .
By John Pond , Esq. Astronomer Royal , F. R. S. Read June 15 , 1815 .
WHEN a standard catalogue of some of the principal fixed stars was laid before the Society in the year i81 3 , I ventured to state as my opinion , that the error of this catalogue depending on the mechanical construction of the instrument , did not probably exceed a quarter of a second .
This opinion has been confirmed by the observations of another year ; the results of which I have now the honour of transmitting to the Society , as it appears that in those stars which I have continued to observe , I have not had occasion to alter the position of any one , above one-tenth of a second .
For this reason I should hardly have thought it necessary to make any farther communication on the subject , had I not wished for an opportunity of adding some valuable deductions respecting the proper motions of these stars .
The comparison of my own catalogue with that of Dr. BRADLEY in the year 1756 , is shown in one of the annexed tables , ( Table II .
) in which the proper motions are given in the last column .
I have also subjoined to my own observations the mean state of the barometer and thermometer , so that the correction may be easily made for any other table of refractions , as well as that of BRADLEY , which I have employed in reducing the Greenwich observations .
Table III .
contains , in addition to the standard catalogue , those stars which have been observed with equal care south of the equator , but from the uncertainty of refraction their positions cannot be so accurately ascertained as those of the former .
In this table , the catalogue has been computed both by BRADLEY'S and the French Tables of Refraction .
