A paper was read , entitled , " On Nobili 's Plate of Colours ; in a Letter from J. P. Gassiot , Esq. , addressed to J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , V.P. and Treasurer R.S. " Communicated by J. W. Lubbock , Esq. The effect produced by the late Signor Nobili , of inducing colours on a steel plate , excited the curiosity of the author , and led him to the invention of the following method of producing similar effects .
Two of Professor Daniell 's large constant cells were exeited with the usual solutions of sulphate of copper and sulphuric acid .
A highly-polished steel plate was placed in a porcelain soup-plate , and a filtered solution of acetate of lead poured upon it .
A piece of card-board , out of which the required figures had been previously cut with a sharp knife , was then placed upon a steel-plate .
Over the card , and resting on it , there was fixed a ring of wood , a quarter of an inch thick , and the inner circumference of which was of the same size as the figure .
A convex copper-plate was made so that its outer edge might rest on the inner part of the wooden ring ; and its centre placed near , but not in actual contact with the card-board .
Connexion was then made by the positive electrode of the battery with the steel-plate ; the negative being placed in the centre of the copper convex plate .
The figure was generally obtained in from 15 to 35 seconds .
If a concave , instead of a convex plate be used , the same colours are obtained as in the former experiment , but in an inverse order .
