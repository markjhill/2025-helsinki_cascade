( Abstract .
) The experiments described in this paper are a continuation of those published at intervals during the last five years in the " Proceedings " in connexion with the anomalous expansion by heat of certain iodides .
Fresh and more accurate determinations of the coefficients of contraction and expansion of iodide of silver are given .
Certain physical and chemical properties of cuprous iodide are detailed , and determinations of its coefficient of expansion by heat .
Five alloys of iodide of silver with cuprous iodide were prepared , , having the following composition and percentage of iodide of silver : Composition .

88-1304 The physical properties of these bodies are described , and their coefficients of contraction and expansion are determined , and the volumes between 0 ' C. and the melting point are deduced therefrom .
A general discussion of the results is afterwards given , in which these alloys are compared with the five chlorobromiodides of silver previously described ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 25 , p. 303 ) , and with the lead-silver iodide alloy , the properties of which were described in the last communication of the author on this subject ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 32 , p. 540 ) .
The following are some of the facts noticed in connexion with the-alloys:\#151 ; 1 .
The specific gravity varies but slightly , viz. , from 5"7302 to 5*6950 , and is little above the mean specific gravity of the constituents .
2 .
The melting points are in all cases much lower , for while the melting point of iodide of silver is 527 ' C. , and of iodide of copper On the Coefficients of Expansion , tyc .
[ Dec. 8 , 601 ' C. , the highest melting point of any one of the alloys is 514 ' C. and the lowest 493 ' C. 3 .
Some of the alloys possess three points of similar density , and some two , at different temperatures .
They are resinous in fracture and transparent in thin layers .
When pulverised they furnish brilliantly yellow powders , unaffected by light .
4 .
When heated in a current of carbonic anhydride they volatilise very slowly .
Heated in dry oxygen iodine is freely evolved , and oxide of copper appears on the surface of the mass .
When heated in dry hydrogen , hydriodic acid is produced , and the metal is reduced .
5 .
The coefficients of expansion of the alloys below the point at which contraction on heating commences , was found to decrease as the percentage of iodide of silver was augmented .
Thus\#151 ; The same fact was observed in the case of the chlorobromiodides of silver .
A curve table shows results .
6 .
While the iodide of silver commences its considerable contraction at 142 ' C. , the five cblorobromiodides of silver , the percentage of iodide of silver in which varies from 26-1692 to 73'9285 , and the lead-silver iodide alloy , the percentage of iodide of silver in which amounts to 33-794 , all commence their contraction at 124 ' C. , that is , 18 C. lower , although the coefficients of expansion of the associated bodies necessarily differ .
Thus it would appear that 124 ' C. is the temperature at which iodide of silver commences its passage from the .crystalline into the amorphous condition , when freed from the attraction of its own molecules , provided no other attraction or influence supervenes 5 while the attraction exerted when it exists unalloyed with any other substance , and when its molecules are hence much nearer to .each other , raises the point of commencement of the change to 142 ' C. 7 .
The probable cause of this is discussed .
8 .
When the same result was looked for in the case of the copper-silver iodide alloys it was not found .
In fact , the presence of the iodide of copper , instead of promoting the assimilation of molecular motion , and lowering the point at which the change from the crystalline into the plastic condition commences , was found to considerably raise it , although the coefficient of expansion of the iodide of copper is lower than that of either chloride or bromide of silver , or of the iodide of lead , which enter into the composition of the other alloys .

Thus while 66-206 per cent , of iodide of lead lowered the point of change 18 ' C. , the presence of 61'7767 per cent , of iodide of copper raised it 142 ' C. 9 .
The possible causes of these results are discussed .
