" On the Physical Constants of Liquid Hydrochloric Acid .
" By Gerrard Ansdell , F.C.S. , Chemical Assistant at the Royal Institution .
Communicated by Professor Dewar , F.R.S. Received January 22 , 1880 .
In a paper read before the Royal Society , on June 18th , 1879 , I described the results of some experiments made with liquid acetylene , obtained by compressing the gas in one of M. Cailletet 's ingenious ' mm Mr. G. Ansdell on the [ Jan. 29 , ' pumps for the liquefaction of gases .
The tensions of the saturated vapour then obtained were so entirely different from M. Cailletet 's results , that it appeared to me to he possibly due to a slight impurity ?
in the gas , probably a trace of mono-bromethylene which always occurs in the red copper compound of acetylene , and is very difficult to completely eliminate .
I therefore prepared a quantity of the silver compound ( which can be obtained entirely free from mono-bromethylene ) by passing acetylene prepared in the same way as formerly , viz. , by the action of alcoholic potash on di-bromethylene , into an ammoniacal solution of nitrate of silver .
On filling several tubes with acetylene generated by the action of hydrochloric acid on this compound , the tensions were found to be exactly the same as those obtained with the acetylene made from the copper compound , thus proving the correctness of the former experiments .
As the Cailletet pump is so well adapted to the examination of gases in their liquid state , and is at the same time so easily managed , it appeared interesting to determine the physical constants of some other gases , and Professor Dewar suggested an examination of the halogen acids , with regard to their physical relations to each other , more especially as we have absolutely no reliable knowledge as to these numbers .
Faraday was the first to liquefy hydrochloric acid gas in 1823 , and he subsequently , in 1848 , made a series of determinations of the vapour tensions of the liquid at different temperatures .
He also liquefied hydrobromic and hydriodic acids , but gives no account of their properties in a liquid state .
Gore ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. xiv ) , examined very carefully the chemical properties of liquid hydrochloric acid , its solvent action , \amp ; c. , but made no determinations of its physical constants .
Hydrochloric acid is the only one I have as yet had time to examine , with the following results :\#151 ; The gas was made by the action of strong sulphuric acid on dry chloride of ammonium , being afterwards freed from sulphuric acid and dried before entering the tubes .
It was found of no advantage to continue the stream of gas for more than six hours , as a constant minimum of air always remained in the tube at the end of this time ( about -j^th of the total volume of the tube ) which it appeared utterly impossible to remove .
The pump was used in the same way as described in my former paper , two iron reservoirs being used , one containing the air manometer , and the other the tube with the gas to be liquefied .
Apart from the mere determination of the vapour tensions , densities , \amp ; c. , the ratio of the volume of saturated vapour to that of the 1880 .
] Physical Constants of Liquid Hydrochloric Acid .
liquid was considered of the highest importance , as from these numbers the latent heat of transformation and other important data can be easily calculated .
For these reasons the gas was examined in rather a different way to the acetylene , the volume to which it had been compressed at the point of liquefaction ( or the volume of the saturated vapour ) at any given temperature being first accurately determined , and then the pressure increased until the condensed liquid entirely filled the upper part of the tube .
The volume of this liquid column was then measured , so that a comparison between the volume of the saturated vapour and the volume of the total condensed liquid was obtained at each temperature .
This fractional volume of the gas at the point of liquefaction was determined by observing when the air manometer ceased to show an increase of pressure on compressing the gas ; the volume of the gas at this point being then measured , and the pressure being then gradually released until the air manometer showed a slight decrease of pressure , \#151 ; the volume of the gas was then again measured at this point , and the mean taken as the point of liquefaction .
The results of the whole series of experiments are recorded in a condensed form in the following table : A. B. C. D. E.

E=ratio of volume of gas to that of the liquid .
F=pressure in atmosphere .
The critical point was found to be 51'*25 0 .
It will be seen from this table , that the volumes of the saturated vapours and liquid gradually approach each other as the temperature nears the critical point , and would undoubtedly become identical , if the experiments could be carried on up to the critical point .
The following curves , the first of which represents the change of volume of the saturated vapour and liquid , in relation to the temperature ; and the second the ratio between these volumes in relation to the temperature ( column E in the table ) show these results in a graphical form .
Curves .
The ratio between the volume of the saturated vapour and the volume of the liquid at different temperatures decreases very regularly until within about three degrees of the critical point , where a singular point in the curve occurs , and the ratio approaches unity with great rapidity .
The volume of the liquid increases very regularly up to a temperature of about 48 ' C. , and at 51 ' C. , or within 0'25 of a degree of the critical point , the distinction between the saturated vapour and the liquid vanishes , as although liquid is plainly seen to condense on the surface of the mercury , on increasing the pressure the line of demarcation immediately disappears , and it is impossible to say whether the tube is filled with the saturated vapour or the liquid itself ; therefore no results could be obtained nearer the critical point than about a fourth of a degree .
Avenarius , in a paper intitled " The Causes which determine the Critical Point " ( " Mem. Acad. Sci. St. Petersbourg , " 1876\#151 ; 77 ) , made a number of experiments on ether , and came to the conclusion that the volumes of the saturated vapour and of the condensed liquid at the critical point were not identical .
He was under the disadvantage of working at a very high temperature , the critical point of ether being 1920,6 C. , which must have been very difficult to keep fixed within half a degree .
My own experiments , which were carried out at a very much lower temperature , and were consequently capable of greater accuracy , on account of the facility with which the temperature could be kept constant to within ^th of a degree , appear to confirm his results , in so far 1880 .

j. *s evidently impossible to measure the relative volume of fluid and gas within less than a fourth of a degree of the critical point , and at this place the volumes are certainly unequal .
This , however , does not disprove their identity as the critical point .
The density of the liquid at different temperatures was determined in the same way as described in my former paper , and gave the following numbers:\#151 ; Temperature .

*619 This liquid has therefore not quite such a high density as liquid carbonic acid , which is 0 95 at 0 ' C. , and is about twice as high as acetylene , which is 0-450 at the same temperature .
It is interesting to note that acetylene is the lightest known fluid substance .
On referring to the density of liquid hydrochloric acid given by other authors , Professors Roscoe and Schorlemmer , in their recent treatise on chemistry , describe it as a colourless liquid having a specific gravity of about 1*27 .
As this valuS is so much higher than that obtained by myself , and as I feel confident of the accuracy of my results , it seems evident that a mistake has in some way arisen , and that the value given by them refers to the density of the gaseous acid with reference to air , and not to the liquefied gas .
Unfortunately Faraday does not seem to have determined its density .
Experiments made to determine the coefficients of compressibility of the fluid at different temperatures were carried on in the same way as formerly detailed .
The following are the chief results :\#151 ; Mean coefficients of compression at different temperatures .

[ Dec. 18 , It is rather more compressible than liquid acetylene , whose mean coefficient at 22'*3 C is '00058 .
