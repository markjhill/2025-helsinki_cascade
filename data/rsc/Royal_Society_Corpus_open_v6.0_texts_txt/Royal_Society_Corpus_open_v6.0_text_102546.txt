Part of a Letter from Mr. Butterfield from Paris , Sept. 7 .
1698 .
to Dr. Martin Lister , Fellow of the College of Physicians and R. S. concerning Magnetical Sand .
I Send you a little of that Black Sand which in Italy they use instead of Dust to their Letters ; it is found Six Miles from Genes near St. Pier d'araine on the SeaShoar .
It hath the Properties of the Loadstone , and I do believe that it is Loadstone or Powder of Loadstone , for it follows the Loadstone ; it sticks to a Knife that is touched with the Loadstone ; it draws a Magnetic Needle ; it doth not ferment with Aqua Fortis , as Iron Dust doth ; it doth not rust with any Acide that can be put to it ; it doth not sparkle in the Flame of a Candle , as Steel-dust doth when it is thrown into the said Flame .
It is commonly found on the Sea-Shoar after great Storms .
