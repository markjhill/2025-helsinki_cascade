) Introduction by Sir Oliver Lodge .
The absence of effective tuning is one of the marked features of wireless telegraphy as at present usually conducted in practice .
In many cases messages are disentangled from a crowd of superposed disturbances , i.e. from other messages , largely by the skill of the receiving telegraphic operator , who , by the exercise of selective attention , manages to interpret and read what is intended for him ; the process being identical with the ordinary human faculty whereby a conversation can be listened to amid general talking and a crowd of other noises at a dinner table .
A certain amount of forbearance is also exercised in certain localities ; and just as it is etiquette to wrait till one conversation across the table is finished before beginning one on your account , so it is with neighbouring wireless operators\#151 ; they wait for each other , and each finishes as quickly as he can .
In fact , it is not very different from the procedure of telephonic operators working through one and the same line , which for a time may be " engaged .
" Tuning is not indeed absent , though usually far less perfect than it might be made .
The systems which work with a closed circuit vibrator , and use sufficient power , can effect a considerable amount of tuning ; so that other wave-lengths can be weakened in comparison with those desired , and so also that the messages received have about them a more or less characteristic note or quality which disentangles them from others , and renders the picking of them out through the necessary selective attention an easier matter than it otherwise would be .
It is indeed extraordinary what the skill of an experienced operator will enable him to read , in spite of the imperfection of the tuning .
For , just as practice enables people to read bad and nearly illegible writing , or to understand very imperfect or ill-heard speech , so it is with the listener at the telephonic receiver to the Morse code signals in wireless telegraphy .
A purely physical instrument , such as a siphon recorder , would fail to give anything like a clear record under such circumstances ; indeed , nothing short of an instrument with the selective power of the human ear could be successfully used in the process of receiving as it is frequently practised to-day .

[ Nov. 20 , But it would appear that the physical elimination of other messages is never perfect ; since , even with the most skilled operator as receiver , there are cases when conversation becomes impossible , owing to the superposition of disturbances from a newly established station ; and then , by International Convention , the station first in the field has the power of calling upon the Government to withhold a licence from the newcomer or disturber of the peace , and to require him to remove or so to moderate his signals that they shall no longer be a source of trouble and confusion .
And of all such stations it is natural that the stations of the Admiralty , and those which may be needed in warfare , shall demand and shall be accorded the precedence , so that they have the power to order away anything which they find deleterious to their free power of conversation with the ships\#151 ; say in the German Ocean or elsewhere .
But it is hardly necessary to point out how dangerous such a condition of things inevitably is .
If in peace time the free power of communication depends only on the ability to order away disturbing elements , what is likely to happen in time of war ?
Will it be possible to order away the disturbances caused by a foe ?
Surely the fact that the physical elimination of such disturbances is known not to have been as yet properly tackled scientifically in the best way that is possible , but has merely been got rid of by legislation , will encourage an enemy to cause purposed disturbance and to make all communication hopeless .
In fact , by dint of continual interruption , to render confusion worse confounded .
And even apart from the exigencies,.of war , it is clearly desirable so to arrange each station that it can speak to the one it wants to speak to without the necessity for overhearing those which are simultaneously speaking in its moderate vicinity .
And to do this not only by the practised skill of an operator but by selective means of a physical kind , so that an automatic receiving instrument such as a siphon recorder could also receive the message intended for it without superposed disturbance from others .
In that case there would be no need to wait till others have finished speaking ; but correspondence could be conducted simultaneously between several pairs of stations\#151 ; not too close together and yet not really far apart .
Now all this can be managed quite easily .
The present trouble is caused by the utilisation of the earth as one terminal of the aerial system , both in sender and receiver .
I do not expect this to be immediately admitted ; but so it is\#151 ; at any rate at land stations .
With the use of the earth as part of the main electric vibrator no perfect tuning is possible .
The most economical and simplest plan is to use the same thing as vibrator and radiator : though at present in many cases they are separated .
If the earth is used as part of Syntonic Wireless Telegraphy .
1908 .
] the radiator , a closed circuit vibrator is necessary ; since by its power it can force the radiator to emit a tuned disturbance , even though one end of it is earthed .
But with an open circuit vibrator alone , the earth must not be used ; for if it is , the succession of waves is damped out , and the waves form so rapidly decadent a series that , though the initial impulse may be strong and able to carry a long way\#151 ; provided it be emitted with great p0wer\#151 ; no reception on a truly syntonic plan based upon the accumulation of a large number of isochronous impulses\#151 ; each alone inoperative\#151 ; from a source of gentle power is possible .
Yet , on the principles laid down by me in 1897 , with a completely self-contained vibrator , consisting of two capacity areas both elevated above the earth as high as may be conveniently possible , accurate tuning is easy enough .
A 5-per-cent , change of frequency\#151 ; indeed less\#151 ; is sufficient to negative all response to other stations , whenever the receiver is purposely so adjusted as to be exactly in tune with one definite frequency and insensitive to all others .
Its sensitiveness under these conditions to the properly attuned wave-length is something surprising , and arouses the astonishment of the hardened operator .
The small induction coils which transmit the signals to each other in the signalling room , by mutual induction from collector to responder , may be separated in some cases more than two feet .
In that case it is manifest that none but the most accurately tuned impulses can be detected .
All others are completely eliminated , however violent they may be .
For the purpose of being called up , the coupling of the inductive connection can easily and quickly be made close again ; and the receiver is then sensitive to all pitches .
But once called up it can , for the purpose of receiving the communication , be instantly , by a movement of the hand , switched over to the less sensitive state , in a state of attunement with that frequency which happens to characterise the speaking station , and to that alone .
The system thus perfected as regards tuning , through the labours of Dr. Alex .
Muirhead and myself and our assistants , is so satisfactory in this respect that I see no reason why I should any longer hesitate to publish a few of the records of observation and experiments made with it , on the ground of a possible but hitherto entirely non-existent pecuniary interest conceivably appertaining thereto ; for they are measurements which cannot be made in a laboratory or without some similar apparatus , and they are worthy of record .
With this introduction I submit the following paper:\#151 ; Sir O. Lodge and Dr. A. Muirhead .
[ Nov. 20 , On the General Principles of Syntonic Wireless Telegraphy .
To obtain telegraphic response between two disconnected stations in a selective manner , so as not to be disturbed by other sending stations in the neighbourhood , it is necessary\#151 ; ( 1 ) That the disturbance emitted consist of a regular or sinuous succession of impulses sufficiently numerous to accumulate their effect ; consequently the emitter must be a fairly free vibrator , with a definite period of its own .
( 2 ) That the receiver be made insufficiently sensitive to respond to a single one or two of such impulses , but sufficiently sensitive to respond to the accumulated effect of a fair number of them .
( 3 ) For this to be possible the receiver also must be capable of fairly free and undamped vibration , so as to preserve and store the impulses as they arrive , till their combined effect attains the needful climax , and excites response .
( 4 ) Nevertheless , excessively long-continued vibration is useless .
In most cases the accumulation of from 20 to 40 swings should be both necessary and sufficient .
For if any large number of swings has to be depended on , say 1000 , it is impossible to preserve the tuning sufficiently accurate to enable them all to help .
For instance , if the tuning were " out " by so little as 1/ 10 per cent. , the last 500 of such a series would be undoing the effect of the first 500 .
( 5 ) In the case of radiated electric waves , the radiating power increases with the openness of circuit of the condenser or other discharged system , being greater from a linear vibrator , and least from one with a closed contour .
On the other hand , the persistence of vibration , or absence of damping , due to radiated energy , is greatest with a closed circuit , and very small with a linear one .
This is because in true waves the electric and magnetic energies must be equal .
In nearly closed circuits the magnetic energy greatly dominates the electrostatic , everywhere except between the plates of the condenser .
In open circuits the electrical lines spread much further , and so by their alternation interact with the magnetic lines to establish the system of advancing waves over a surface more distant from the radiator ; for the radiating power with given wave-length increases rapidly with the extent of the radiating surface.* But of course it has less initial electrostatic energy than a condenser charged to the same potential with plates close together , and therefore of greater capacity .
( 6 ) Accordingly there must be a compromise , and in order that the syntonic radiator may also be the vibrator it must itself be a condenser * Compare Sir G. G. Stokes , " On the Communication of Vibrations to a Gas , " 'PhiL Trans. , ' 1868 .

] consisting of two moderately large capacity areas , separated from each other by a considerable space full of electrostatic lines ; able , therefore , to give a moderate number of free swings\#151 ; such a number as 30\#151 ; after having been set in vibration .
Such an arrangement was depicted in practical form , and the details indicated , by me in 1897 .
The mathematical principles of this and much more were discussed by Dr. Larmor , in 1894 , * as well as by Hertz and Fitzgerald.f ( 7 ) The emitter and receiver should also be elevated some reasonable height above the earth , so that the perturbing and uncertain effect of its capricious and variable conductivity may be eliminated .
Recognition of the evil effect of the earth has become clearer since 1897 ; for although at that time a sound arrangement , of two insulated and elevated capacity areas , was depicted in my first tuning arrangement , it was thought that the earth might in some cases be used as one of those areas , even at syntonic stations .
( 8 ) Experience shows this not to be the case .
We find the influence of the earth\#151 ; such earth , for instance , as we get in Kent\#151 ; wholly deleterious to accurate syntony , and we obtain our good results by disconnecting everything from it , and raising even the lower aerial or capacity area a sufficient distance above the earth 's surface .
The best distance is found to be that at which the resultant capacity of the lower plate , with reference to the upper aerial on the one hand , and to the earth below on the other , is a minimum .
( 9 ) To avoid damping by resistance , ail leads are very thick and composed of a multitude of silk-covered No. 40 wires of high conductivity , made into a cable ; and great care is taken with all joints , since the E.M.F. of the incipient swings at beginning of resonance is very low .
( 10 ) Arc v. Spark.\#151 ; It has sometimes been said recently that tuning can only be maintained by an arc , and that a spark is incapable of being tuned .
A short snappy spark is incapable , but that is not the sort of spark that we employ .
On the contrary , we use a comparatively long-continued flame-like spark , between points rather than knobs ; and we take it in an enclosure , so that the ionised air escapes immediate dissipation , and is for the necessary time practically a conductor .
We also prolong the discharge of the capacity areas by a sufficient amount of the inertia of self-induction .
Under these conditions , if the spark is analysed by a rotating mirror , its image is seen to be spread out into a long beaded band , with ample opportunity for being tuned .
The old snappy spark or whip-crack plan of Hertz , with clean polished knobs , is unsuited to a syntonic station .

[ Nov. 20 , The precision of tuning which can thus be obtained in conjunction with very effective radiating power is remarkable ; the sensitiveness of such a receiver to accumulated impulses is noteworthy ; and the resulting ease and discrimination of selective or syntonic signalling is so marked that the measurements establishing the fact are considered by us worthy of communication to the Royal Society .
Practical Details in connection with Tuning.* Pig .

Fig. 1.\#151 ; Arrangement of Capacity Areas for Fixed Station .
Dr. Muirhead finds that if metallic connection is made between the loops of the cross at these corners the effect falls off greatly .
There must be a surging of the pulse from the centre of the cross to the middle of each of its sides , and so this arrangement , if approximately adjusted to correspond with the wave-length , gives a remarkably powerful result , being very efficient both as sender and as receiver .
The figure only shows a model of the real arrangement , wherein , of course , the posts have to be supported by stays .
" * Fig. 2 is a diagram of the connections .
Here we see the lower capacity area of the aerial connected to a small , adjustable , open , high-conductivity , self-induction spiral I. The upper capacity area can be switched either to the sender on the left or to the receiver on the right .
* Owing to hesitation and delay in sending in this paper , the following details have now been published as an Appendix to a book , 'Signalling without Wires , ' by Lodge , and accordingly they cannot be offered to the Society as new matter ; but they are explanatory .

Taking the receiving side first , we see the primar}^ and secondary of the transformer ; the secondary coil of the latter is in circuit with the adjustable condenser k which shunts the coherer WE , and is likewise in circuit with the recorder coil and a battery giving a fraction of a volt through a potentiometer PT .
Both these accessories are prevented from interfering with the reception of messages by a large condenser K acting as shunt , so as to allow free passage to the impulses , though not to steady currents .
On the left-hand side we have first the spark-gaps\#151 ; several , sometimes five , in series\#151 ; then the sending transformer T , then the safety switch and signalling key , then the inductance coils for tuning this part of the arrangement .
We see also the ammeter , the voltmeter , and the alternator ; and , still further to the left , we see the arrangements for regulating the excitation of its field magnets and speed .

explained below , that the frequency of this alternator is in tune with its circuit , and likewise in tune with the secondary circuit of the sending transformer T connected to the aerial .
But when the spark occurs it short-circuits the aerial through the spark gaps MS , and confers upon it a totally different frequency , enormously more rapid , which is responded to by the distant corresponding aerial switched on to its receiving circuit , every part of which is in tune with that frequency .
The small power required by this arrangement , and the exactness of the tuning and the ease with which undesired messages and disturbances can be eliminated , is surprising and somewhat beautiful .
In order to enable a small-power coil to charge a sufficiently large capacity to bursting point , it is sometimes necessary to accumulate several of its impulses , which , by means of a valve , is readily done .
The kind of valve which we interpolate between coil and aerial in such cases is shown in fig. 3 .
It is exhausted by a special and peculiar process , and it enables the capacity to be readily filled to sparking point several times a second , even by quite a small coil with rapid trembler .
Sir O. Lodge and Dr. A. Muirhead .
[ Nov. 20 , The message to be sent can either be transmitted by hand or it can be punched on tape in the ordinary way and passed through an automatic transmitter .
As receiver , one can use either the telephone or the recorder , but for all accurate purposes the recorder is much the best .
The coherer employed in connection with the recorder is the remarkably sensitive and trustworthy wheel coherer shown in fig. 4 , of which the important part is a steel wheel , kept slightly oiled and dipping into mercury by an adjustable amount .
The recorder clockwork keeps it slowly rotating .
For telephone use , a simpler though less sensitive coherer suffices ; and the one commonly used is a modification of my original single-point-and-plate , immersed in oil , and able to be tilted so that the pressure of the oil shall vary , thus constituting an easy adjustment .
It is depicted in fig. 5 .
We also use an electrolytic coherer , which is highly sensitive but not so suitable for tuning .
In any case , the coherer is arranged as a shunt to a Leyden jar or adjustable air-condenser , whose circuit is closed through self-induction , so that it has a definite frequency period .
The coherer is not affected till the jar overflows , which it does by reason of accumulation of impulses.* An adjustable air-condenser is shown in the diagram of connections , fig. 2 , as a condenser with a slant arrow across it , k. It can be quickly adjusted to give the proper tuning , and then the impulses accumulate , so that the condenser overflows through the coherer .
It is this overflow method which causes the coherer to be very sensitive to the proper tune , and to be insensitive to others .
It represents my old syntonic Leyden jar experiment . !
In fig. 6 the handle of the adjustable condenser is shown on the left-hand side , and in the middle is seen the self-induction which completes its circuit .
This same self-induction is employed as the secondary of a transformer , whose primary is in the circuit of the receiving aerial .
This primary has only a few turns , and is shown on the right-hand side .
When the right tune is attained , there is a great margin of power ; and the primary and secondary can then be separated very considerably , so that everything except mpulses of the right frequency are excluded .
They are often separated a large fraction of a foot .

Statement of the Points to be attended to .
The first point requiring attention is the tuning of the two capacity areas , in series with the secondary of the Ruhmkorff coil , and the exciting them by an alternating dynamo running so as to give the same frequency .
This adjustment has been found a useful one , and in order to make it possible to treat the Ruhmkorff as an independently oscillating circuit , it is necessary to have it specially constructed with a great interspace between the primary and secondary bobbins , so that the secondary bobbin shall be almost free and isolated and have very little capacity when considered as a Leyden jar with the primary as the other coating .
No doubt some effectiveness is removed from the coil by this great separation , which is often as much as an inch between the inducing and the induced bobbin , but there is no loss of " efficiency , " and the diminished effectiveness is more than compensated by the tuning which is thereby rendered possible in the secondary circuit .
Less power is called for in the primary circuit in such a case , since the secondary is then on open circuit , and not , so to speak , short-circuited by its capacity with the primary coil , a capacity which is merely useless and disturbing .
Practically all the capacity which is now inserted in the secondary circuit is the useful and effective capacity of the radiating aerials , so that no more power is consumed than is needed ; and the secondary circuit being free , it can continue oscillating so long as the dynamo potential retains a sufficiently high value , thereby prolonging the spark to a surprising extent , and giving it a very bright and arc-like appearance , as if it consisted of a great number of oscillations in succession .
And the fact that it does so consist of a succession of oscillations is proved by photographing the spark in a revolving mirror or on a rotating plate ; the number of alternations is then seen to be 30 or more semi-oscillations , each recorded on the plate , and after these oscillations there is a long stream , visible to the eye , of greenish coloured light , such as does not much affect a photographic plate , but which may be a continuance of the alternations beyond.* The spark must not , therefore , be treated as a simple snap : it is nothing of the kind ; it is a maintained spark , and it is maintained by connection with the tuned Ruhmkorff , which continues to supply the energy during the whole of the continuance of the sending alternations .
It is not to be supposed that these sending alternations are of the frequency of the Ruhmkorff or of the alternator : they are of a totally different order ; they are the alternations proper to the aerials short-circuited through the spark-gap by the connecting wires , and must be reckoned in fractions of a million per second .
The tuning of the alternator and the Ruhmkorff only enables them to be maintained .
At the same time the maintenance could not be effected unless the lower area were elevated above the ground ; for if it be lowered nearer the ground , the chain of oscillations is diminished ; if it touch the ground , the series is cut very short ; and if it is connected with the ground , nothing is left of it but just a few at the beginning\#151 ; often not more than two or three\#151 ; a sequence which is quite insufficient for anything like proper tuning .
Actual tuning experiments confirm this , for it is found that with the lower aerial on the ground , or even too near the ground , the tuning is imperfect ; in fact , there is barely any tuning at all when there is earth connection .
But as the lower aerial is raised the tuning improves very rapidly , and at the best position becomes extraordinarily sharp , the disturbances , when plotted , rising to a sharp peak , when everything is properly adjusted .
It must be understood that these experiments were conducted on land , not at sea .
* Such photographs , taken at Dr. Muirhead 's station at Elmer 's End , were exhibited to the British Association at Leicester by Mr. Duddell in his Evening Lecture to the Association in 1907 .
Syntonic Wireless , 1908 .
] It is on the top of this peak that a tuned station usually works ; that is to say , the received effect is purposely diminished until the instruments only just respond , or respond with a small margin , so that a slight change of tune would render them entirely insensitive .
Under these conditions they can receive from one similarly tuned station , but from no other ; others are thereby tuned out , unless the tops of their peaks ( if they have any , which a good many have not ) happen to coincide with the tune of the receiving station .
Another precaution that must be taken to keep the tuning sharp\#151 ; that is to say , not to damp out the oscillations at these very high frequencies\#151 ; is to have the conducting wires so composed that they shall offer plenty of surface to the ether .
To this end they must be finely subdivided into insulated strands , because , otherwise , if they were solid conductors , only their exterior surface would take any part in conducting the current , and therefore the resistance would be very high , and the oscillations would be killed .
But by using as conductors a bundle of a very large number of excessively fine insulated copper wires , of high conductivity , sufficient total surface is exposed to give admirable conducting power , even to disturbances of the highest frequency used .
All parts of apparatus used for this purpose , such as receiving transformers and the like , should be made with wire of this kind , and never with a merely solid conductor , of which the sectional interior is useless .
Moreover , since the received E.M.F. is very low , all questionable joints and imperfect contacts must be scrupulously avoided .
Adjustment of Tuning .
As for tuning at the receiving end : it is managed in the first instance by putting between the two capacity areas a self-inductance coil , of a small number of turns , which are adjusted until the response , to the sending station desired , is a maximum .
A small part of this inductance is arranged to be easily variable , and capable of adjustment , but the main part of it ( which , after all , is still not much ) is used as the primary of the receiving transformer .
The number of turns depends on the wave-length desired , but for short waves as few as five turns is sufficient ; and in order to compensate it a coil of a similar number of turns must be inserted in the sending circuit .
But such insertions are of no advantage : they are rather a disadvantage , and are therefore kept as small as may serve to make the transformer efficient .
The number of turns in the secondary of the receiving transformer again depends on the wave-length , but in a special case it consists of 35 turns connected in series with a large capacity or air-condenser , which is capable of continuous adjustment in order to tune this also to the required frequency ; and the coherer is arranged as a shunt or overflow to this capacity , so that as soon as the excited oscillations have reached a certain value , the coherer has to respond .
This is an application of the overflow-method which I described in ' Proc. Boy .
Soc. , ' vol. 50 .
The capacity at which these receiving air-condensers are worked is generally found to be about a few milli-microfarads .
Their external appearance is shown in fig. 6 .
The primary and secondary of the receiving transformer are mounted in such a way that they can be moved to and from each other ; and by this means the disturbance received by the coherer can be minimised till it will only just respond .
That is the arrangement adopted for working on the top of the curve , and thereby getting the benefit of the accuracy of tuning ; which accuracy\#151 ; when all things are so adjusted\#151 ; every part of both sending and receiving circuit being carefully tuned , and the lower area elevated above the ground\#151 ; is exceedingly remarkable .
A difference in wavelength of one-half per cent , on either side is sufficient to throw the tune completely off the top of the curve ; and the response may be stopped even by so small a change as that .
Of course , if we do not want to work with such accurate tuning there is no need Sir O. Lodge and Dr. A. Muirhead .
[ Nov. 20 , to limit oneself to the top of the curve ; it is easy enough to utilise more power , but in that case one might pick up\#151 ; and , as a matter of fact , we do pick up\#151 ; signals from other stations .
By using the whole of the power available in the receiving circuit , we can hear the signals of all the stations round about ; but by diminishing the power until we are working on the top of the curve of some one selected station , we tune out all the others , and listen to that alone .
Even when the others are not tuned to silence a skilful operator with a telephone receiver can pick out the message intended for him , just as a conversation can be carried on in a crowded room ; but the tuning enables much more than that : it is so perfect that a recording instrument can record the one upon tape and completely ignore all the others .
Measurement of Wave-length .
To measure the wave-length , a method based on the sympathetic or resonant Leyden jar is employed ; that is to say , an adjustable air-condenser is put in series with a self-inductance coil , and the coil brought into the neighbourhood of a single turn of wire in the sending circuit , so that it shall be operated upon inductively and thrown into oscillation when it is tuned to the right frequency .
The tuning is done by moving the plates of the air-condenser , with an index pointing to a graduated scale , until the response of this sympathetic or subordinate closed circuit is a maximum .
The method is an application by Prof. Braun of my syntonic Leyden jar experiment .
In the older form of the experiment the existence of this maximum resonance was shown by actual overflow in the form of a spark , or in some cases by the use of a coherer ; but the simplest metrical method of observing it is to intercalate in its circuit some simple measuring instrument , such as a hot-wire ammeter , of which there are many suitable kinds .
The indications of this instrument easily enable the maximum position to be found , and by a calibration scale the wave-length is at once read off on the adjustable condenser .
The maximum reading on the hot-wire instrument also serves to indicate in a comparative manner the amount of energy being sent into the aerials .
Measurement of the Capacity of the Aerials .
' The capacity can be measured in straightforward manner by the Wheatstone bridge method , two arms of the bridge being resistances , the other two arms being the aerials on the one hand and an adjustable air-condenser on the other .
By means of a secohmmeter the system can be charged , insulated , and discharged some 30 or 40 times a second\#151 ; a suitable galvanometer being placed in the bridge wire , and the air-condenser adjusted until its reading is zero .
At Elmer 's End and at Downe the aerials can be changed so as to enclose either an area represented by 3 or an area represented by 4 .
The ratio df the linear dimensions therefore , in the two cases would be as 3 to y/ 4 ; that is , 3 = 0'866 .
The observed capacities measured in the above way were approximately as 6 to 7 , which is equal to the ratio O'86 .
But one cannot say that it is exactly 6 to 7 , because it varies with different elevations to some slight extent .
One pair of readings made it 6'4 to 7'3 , which gives rather a greater ratio than the linear dimensions\#151 ; as , indeed , is quite right .
P Effect of the Earth on Capacity .
Measured in this way , the capacity of the upper aerial , when the lower is lying on the ground , we will call 12 .
If the lower is thoroughly connected with the ground , the effect is usually just the same , tested in this fashion , though at very high frequency it is certain that merely lying on the ground does not make fully efficient connection .
1908 .
] Syntonic Wireless Telegraphy .
On insulating and raising the lower aerial 3 feet , which is about the least feasible when sag is allowed fox ' , the capacity of the system falls to 8 .
On l'aising the lower aerial 9 feet , the capacity falls , say , to 7'4 , which as an illusti'ation we may take as the minimum ; for if it be raised to 16 feet , the capacity begins to increase again , owing to its commencing proximity with the upper aerial .
Thus , if raised too high , the capacity is increased for one reason ; if depressed too low , it is great for another reason ; an intervening position gives minimum capacity , and this is the position at which the sending is found to be best .
Measurement of Energy at the Receiving End .
For the purpose of measuring the received energy , a Duddell radio-micrometer is employed , consisting of a dead-beat instrument on a stone pillar , after the fashion of Boys ' radio-micrometer .
The instrument has a single loop of wii'e , in a strong magnetic field , carrying a thermal junction which is actuated by the hot air rising from a very fine short wire .
This short fine wire is included in the receiving circuit\#151 ; that is , between the upper and lower capacity areas\#151 ; an adjustable self-inductance box being also inserted for the purpose of lengthening the wave as required , or an adjustable capacity being inserted if it is found necessary to shorten the wave .
The received signals heat the fine wire and produce a steady deflection on the scale , which is then l'ead ; the self-inductance plug is then shifted and another reading taken , and so on until the maximum is found .
This is the tuned position .
The sharpness of tuning is recorded by plotting the l'eadings over a fair range .
In the case of imperfect tuning , such as is experienced when the lower area is too near the earth , the value of the deflection , though it does l'ise to a low maximum , is not very different for a small distance on either side ; although if the peg is moved several holes the deflection can fall off to something like half its value .
When earth connection is actually made there is hardly any particular maximum or tuned position .
But when the lower aerial is insulated and sufficiently elevated , the curve runs up into a high peak at one particular position of the plug , and the smallest shift on either side brings the value down enormously .
That , of course , is exactly the characteristic of sharp tuning ; and having found the top of the curve in this way , which is very quickly done , the receiving inductive connection can be so weakened as only to allow the coherer to respond to something very near the maximum distui'bance .
For under those conditions it will respond to ixo other station thereby eliminating unwished-for disturbances .
But if at any time it is desired to receive from other stations , or , indeed , from all stations round about\#151 ; or , say , from stray ships\#151 ; then the inductive connection can be closed up again , so as to make the receiving instrument sensitive and capable of responding , not only to the maximum , but to any disturbance , no matter how much out of tune it may be .
This , for instance , is the condition in which a coast station would usxially be kept , and it would only be sci'ewed up to pi'eci3e tuning when it was desired to speak to one particular station without interference from any other .
Some few of the numbers thus obtained are recorded and plotted further on .
It must be understood that when these energy measurements were going on , telegraphic operations were suspended .
These measurements are not necessary in practice : they were made for scientific purposes .
It is quite easy to arrange a series of frequencies or wave-lengths corresponding to a series of different stations , any one of which can be spoken to at pleasure by pegging in a plug in the appropriate place .
Sir O. Lodge and Dr. A. Muirhead .
[ Nov. 20 , Perfection o Timing .
In this way it was possible to receive at Hythe from Elmer 's End , while a much more powerful and nearer station at Dover was making a disturbance which was entirely eliminated .
It is easy to hear the ships in the Channel , but it is also easy to tune everything out and listen to the desired station alone .
A 5-per-cent , change can be , and in actual practice is , made to throw a given station out and throw a neighbouring one in .
There is no difficulty in contracting to work as close as that .
With changes of that order of magnitude , several neighbouring sending stations can be made to send to several neighbouring receiving stations without interference .
That is to say , " diplex " telegraphy is possible , though at present not " duplex .
" The accuracy of tuning on the Lodge-Muirhead system is such that messages are sent between Burma and the Andaman Islands\#151 ; a distance of about 300 miles\#151 ; with less than a horse-power .
The power we use is small , but the radiation is so strong from an open circuit radiator that in places I fear we perturb the Admiralty .
We can tune them out quite easily , but we are informed that our radiation cannot be tuned out , their idea appearing to be that it is too strong .
I suspect , however , that the real fact is that their use of a sea or earth connection prevents their collector from being adequately tuned .
Our radiation is of one perfectly definite wave-length , and of that alone .
Effect of the Earth .
If the earth were a perfect conductor , it would presumably act like a mirror , preventing the waves spreading in that direction , and thereby doubling the intensity of any radiator above it ; except that in certain places there would be liable to be interference bands , where the difference between source and image was equal to half a wave-length .
Such interference , however , chiefly occurs in the case of those long trains of waves appropriate for tuning .
For single pulses\#151 ; that is to say , the snaps needed for untuned signalling\#151 ; the effect of a perfectly conducting earth would probably be good , and in so far as the sea is a moderately good conductor , connection with the sea may be advantageous for such signalling ; but for tuned relation between stations it is becoming clear that even the sea is not a good enough conductor , and the land is certainly much too bad , so that , instead of prolonging the oscillations , its resistance wipes them out and kills them .
It is far better to ignore the earth and work independently of it , both at the sending and receiving end , taking care to keep everything insulated .
We thereby gain the advantage of being independent of fluctuations in the quality of the soil , in respect both of permanent geological quality and of variable heat and moisture , and we also get far better tuning .
On the train of waves which is passing between distant stations , the earth probably has no particular influence , except by reason of its irregularities and obstructions ; but over great distances it is possible that they may be reflected advantageously in the good conducting upper regions of the atmosphere .
\#166 ; * But with extremely great distances Mr. Marconi has chiefly dealt .
My object has been to perfect the tuning for moderate distances .

Deflexions of the micro-ampere meter , or hot-wire instrument , are plotted vertically .
Variations of wave-length , in terms of studs of the inductance box , are plotted horizontally .
0 corresponds to a wave-length of 440 metres .
The curves are numbered in the order in which they were taken .
The last curve ( No. 5 ) , it will be noted , is shifted to the right , but that is entirely accounted for by the fact recorded in the set of Elmer 's End ( not Down ) readings ( see first list of measurements recorded , p. 241 ) .

[ Nov. 20 , increased by nearly 1 per cent. Hence the apparent defect is really a corroboration of the correctness of the measurement ; for this change was not known by the observer at Downe , except from the fact that he received that same slightly increased wave-length .
Improved Plottings of the Measurements .
But the plotting of the curves by stud readings is imperfect : they should be plotted accurately to wave-lengths as explained below ; and in fig. 8 they are so plotted .
The real precision of tuning , and the occurrence of the maximum at a definite wave-length , in all cases between 441 or 442 metres\#151 ; except the last case which is 444 for a reason explained\#151 ; come out here much more prominently .
Otherwise fig. 8 represents the same facts as fig. 7 .

[ Nov. 20 , almost entirely all tuning lias disappeared , having been destroyed by earth connection .
Another set was taken with the lower aerial raised only 3 feet , and instantly the sensitiveness is vastly increased ; the same power produces an enormous result at the proper tune , and the measurements show that the curve of received energy for different wave-lengths rises to a high peak at one definite place .
On raising the lower area rather too high , to 15 feet , the peak is a little lower , because the radiating power is diminished by the closing up of the capacity areas , but the tuning is even sharper .
During this series , Elmer 's End was sending with 475 watts , 5 x 3/ 16 inch sparks , wave-length 440 metres , in each case .
Diagram 11 shows the energy received at Down on March 7 , with the lower aerial in different positions:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Thoroughly earth connected ; ( 2 ) lying on the ground , but not otherwise connected ; ( 3 ) elevated to a height of 6 feet .
It is to be understood that the upper aerial continued at the same height throughout .
Elmer 's End was sending with 400 watts , 5x| inch gaps , wave-length 440 metres .
On this day the recording ammeter was purposely reduced in sensitiveness .
The immense improvement of a capacity area even slightly raised from the ground ( a few feet only ) is in this as well as in the preceding diagram conspicuous .
And the difference between lying on the ground and good earth connection is also noticeable ; and though both conditions are very bad , the latter is the worse .
To give an idea of the absolute quantities involved , a calibration of the energy receiving instrument , carried ^out later , shows that a deflexion of 400 divisions meant 3 milliamperes : the relation between the readings on the hot-wire instrument and the corresponding received current being plotted in the diagram .
Fig. 12 represents this calibration of the instrument used to measure the received energy , and shows how well the Duddell hot-wire micro-ampere-meter answered the purpose .
Received Fraction of Emitted .
In a certain case the current received at Down was 4'6 milliamperes , and the resistance of the hot wire which indicated it was 20 ohms .
This means , for the time , a power of 21 microwatts .
The nominal power at the Elmer 's End station was 400 watts ; but of course this was emitted intermittently , and the actual power at the instant of sending must be quite otherwise estimated .
A very rough guess makes the factor of efficiency 10-9 , for this cross-country distance of 7 miles .

Measurements of Capacities at Different Heights .
Another set of measurements of some interest records the effect on the capacity of varying the height of the lower aerial from 0 to 18 feet .
These are plotted in fig. 13 , the upper aerial being at masthead all the time .
It will be seen that there is a shallow minimum at the height of 9 feet , and that is the height at which it is usually adjusted for most efficient sending .

the ground .
This minimum occurs at different heights at different stations , in correspondence with the sizes of the aerials ; and the heights of the upper aerials were also different .
At Elmer 's End the minimum occurs at about 12 feet up ; at Hythe , 20 feet ; at Down , 6 feet .
And in each of the three cases it was found by actual experiment that the station radiated and received most powerfully when the lower capacity was raised to these heights .
Effect of Varying Height of Upper Aerial .
The placing of the lower aerial in or about the best position is an important matter in practice .
The elevation of the upper aerial is merely a matter of convenience and expense .
But it seemed desirable to ascertain how the radiating power was affected by varying the height of the upper capacity area , keeping the lower one constant ; and accordingly the measurements plotted in fig. 14 were made .
For this purpose the height of the upper aerial was the quantity modified in this set of observations , the charge being made at both stations so as to make the two stations correspond with the best tuning position .
It is to be understood that with each height of the sending aerial a complete set of Sir O. Lodge and Dr. A. Muirhead .
[ Nov. 20 , readings was taken at the receiving station , so as to get the sharpness of tuning depicted , as well as the best power received .
It was , of course , some trouble to change the height of the upper aerial , and it would never Fig. 14 .

It will be observed that the tuning becomes less sharp as the upper capacity area is lowered ; and of course the received energy decreases fast as the lowering continues .
As these experiments are not likely to be repeated , the plotting of another set of observations is likewise given in fig. 15 .
And in fig. 16 the maximum energy received at Down , when tuning was best , is plotted against the height of upper capacity area as abscissae .

[ Nov. 20 , In this case , therefore , the receiver is virtually responding to different stations , each with its own wave-length ; and by referring to fig. 18 it will be seen how readily it could pick out one station and listen only to that , especially by working at the top of the curve\#151 ; at the position of least sensitiveness , with the induction coupling very loose .

the two right-hand curves\#151 ; which are the closest together\#151 ; the wave-length has changed from 392 to 405 ; that is to say a little over 3 per cent. ; but it would be practicable to tune out either of these stations and listen to the other alone .
In fig. 19 the converse is shown .
That is to say , the sender has a fixed aerial , and the size of that at the receiving station is modified ; thereby making it correspond to different stations , each tuned up merely by plugging in or out induction in the shed\#151 ; a very quick operation .
To find whether the received energy depends more on the linear or on the superficial dimensions of the receiving aerials , the observations were plotted as in fig. 20\#151 ; curve 1 is in terms of area and curve 2 in terms of length\#151 ; and it is seen that the received energy depends on a mean between the length and the area\#151 ; as would be expected .
The measurements plotted in fig. 21 represent a large amount of work .

Sir O. Lodge and Dr. A. Muirhead .
[ Nov. 20 , Each curve represents a series of measurements taken between a couple of stations with the lower capacity area of each adjusted to different but corresponding heights , sagging being prevented by a support in the middle as well as at the corners .
In these experiments the aerial was reduced in size to three-quarters what it had been , to see if that reduced the sensitiveness importantly ; but it made very little difference .
The stations were not readjusted each time to a constant wave-length , as in fig. 7 or 8 , and no self-induction was inserted at Elmer 's End , but it was allowed to emit the natural wave-length pertaining to the aerial .
After each adjustment of the lower aerial , therefore , it emitted radiation of a different wave-length , so as to constitute virtually a slightly different station .
The wave-lengths are plotted as abscissae .
A series of measurements was taken in each case at the sending end , so as to include the best wave-length and to observe the tuning .
The tuning in every case is quite good , and the lower area was not put into contact with the ground in this series , because it had become abundantly and constantly clear that tuning was thereby practically destroyed , no special wave-length being emitted from an earthed radiator or received by an earthed collector much more readily than any other .
Besides , the sensitiveness in such cases was reduced to a very insignificant value .
One object of the series was to verify which height of the lower aerial gave the best effect at a land station , and to ascertain whether the best height was really at the position of minimum capacity as had appeared likely .
To this end the sum of the capacities of the aerials at the two stations was plotted , and is shown in curve No. 2 of fig. 22 .
Only it is plotted in an inverted position , corresponding to the inverted capacity values on the right-hand side of the diagram , so that the minimum capacity comes at the top of the curve instead of at the bottom .
And above it is plotted curve No. 1 , the maximum values of the received energy in the different cases of fig. 21 , in accordance with numbers on the left-hand side of fig. 22 ; the abscissae in 22 being the heights of the lower capacity area\#151 ; the upper one being kept constant .
It will be observed that the maximum received energy does really correspond fairly with the minimum capacity : that is to say , with the position in which the earth interferes as little as possible , while yet the radiator and collector are not so close together as to begin to be inefficient .
A great number of other measurements have been made , but they are all confirmatory of what is shown in the above selection , and it is thought unnecessary to publish more than the above sample of the work .

) Postscript.\#151 ; It is hoped to submit a communication on some theoretical considerations at a later stage .
Added February , 1909.\#151 ; From the above paper an account of the most striking experiment to illustrate the facility and perfection of tuning on this system , when insulated capacity areas are employed without any earth connection , was omitted .
The experiment was made on May 14 , 1907 , and may be thus briefly described :\#151 ; At the two stations , Down and Elmer 's End respectively , the upper capacity area of each aerial ( fig. 1 ) was bisected diagonally , the two triangular halves being insulated from each other , and each connected to its own independent sending or receiving arrangement .
The lower aerial was not bisected , but was doubled ; an additional insulated area being placed a few feet below the ordinary one .
By this means each station was practically doubled , and the two halves at each station corresponded to a different wave-length .
Two automatic senders at Elmer 's End were then set to work simultaneously , one to transmit the word " Liverpool " many times in succession , the other the word " Steamships " continuously in the same way .
Two independent receivers at the Down station\#151 ; one of them a siphon recorder and one a telephone , though both might easily have been automatic recorders\#151 ; each of them inductively connected with one half of the aerial there , now received simultaneously , one of them a succession of 254 Sir O. Lodge and Dr. A. Muirhead .
[ Nov. 20 , " Liverpool , " the other a succession of " Steamships , " without the slightest confusion or interference or overlapping of any kind .
In other words , diplex telegraphy ( as distinct from duplex ) was found quite easy on this system of tuning which was specified by one of us in 1897 .
Added March 8 , 1909.\#151 ; Another experiment more recently tried is the following:\#151 ; Two stations were arranged at Downe , 1200 feet apart , either of which could speak with great ease to Elmer 's End , and was strong enough to speak to a station 30 miles away .
One of the Downe stations was then switched on to " receiving , " and both Elmer 's End and the other station at Downe were set speaking to it .
The wave-length of one was 300 metres , of the other , 660 metres , so as to compare Civil with Admiralty conditions .
By the mere motion of a handle the frequency of the receiving station could be altered at will so as to correspond either with the neighbouring sending station 1200 feet off , or with the distant sending station seven miles off , \#151 ; which distance might , however , have been increased immensely without any difficulty .
A few trees intervened between the neighbouring stations .
Under these circumstances , when properly adjusted , each station could be ?
heard separately ; that is to say , messages could be received first from one tuned-in station , and then from the other , without any disturbance from the station tuned-out ; although both stations were sending all the time strongly and simultaneously .
The ease and large margin with which selection could be achieved shows that the two neighbouring stations could have been put still nearer , while still retaining the power of complete tuning-out .
Received March 25 , 1909.\#151 ; Further experiments in the same direction were conducted as follows :\#151 ; The two stations at Downe , 400 yards apart , were re-arranged so that there were no trees between , only a few low hedges ; thus making the test manifestly more severe .
A given power was then employed for sending at one of these neighbouring stations , and the same power at the distant Elmer 's End Station , while the other neighbouring station was arranged for receiving from either of these two at pleasure .
Experiment was now directed to determining the conditions under which the neighbouring station could be completely cut out , while still the distant one could be clearly heard .
In other words , to determine the separation between the primary and secondary of the inductive connection ( fig. 6 ) which eliminated all disturbance from the neighbouring station adjusted to ordinary commercial wave-length , while it permitted perfect signals to be received on the siphon recorder from the tuned station of longer , or more nearly Naval , wave-length .
Case 1.\#151 ; Elmer 's End sending with a wave-length of 580 metres .
Neighbouring Downe sending with a wave-length of 300 metres .
The receiving Downe station was attuned so as to cover a range of wave-length about 580 metres on the average , but extending more than 20 metres above and below .
Under these conditions it was possible completely to cut out the local station on a coupling of 3| inches , that is with 3^ inches Syntonic Wireless Telegraphy .

] separating primary and secondary coil of the inductive connection .
Whereas from Elmer 's End perfect signals could be obtained without disturbance on any coupling between 3\#163 ; and 7 inches .
Indeed as the exact pitch was reached at the receiving adjustment , the signals received boomed out , as it were , very strongly .
Case 2.\#151 ; The Elmer 's End wave-length was shortened to 510 metres : the local Down station remaining at 300 metres : and again a series of readings was taken at the receiving Down station adjusted to an average of 510 metres wave-length .
The coupling separation which now just managed to cut out the local station was 4 inches .
Anything above 4 inches gave perfect signals from Elmer 's End , and no disturbance .
Case 3.\#151 ; On shortening the distant wave-length still more , so as to make it 450 metres , the neighbouring station could not be completely cut out without at the same time introducing a trace of superposed disturbance iuto the messages received from the distant station .
Case 4.\#151 ; The difference of wave-length between the two stations was now therefore again slightly increased : the Elmer 's End wave-length being adjusted to 480 metres , with the local station still remaining at 300 .
In this case perfect and strong signals could be received from Elmer 's End again , but the separation of the inductive connection had to be as much as 6 inches in order completely to cut out the local signals from the neighbouring station .
It follows , therefore , that when two powerful stations are so excessively near each other as they were in this case ( in adjoining fields ) , a distant signal can be heard with perfect clearness , i.e. , without any trace of disturbance , only when its wave-length is more than half as great again as the neighbouring station ; but that undisturbed signalling is much more easy when it approaches double that magnitude ; or , of course , when the neighbouring stations are not quite so close together .
In no case was any trace of harmonic detected ; e.g. , when a station was sending 300 metres , and the neighbouring receiving station was attuned to 600 metres , it did not necessarily feel any disturbance .
The waves emitted and received by these radiators appear to be practically pure .
Summary .
1 .
Perfection of tuning can be attained in spark telegraphy when the radiator and receiver are both persistent vibrators which can be accurately tuned together .
2 .
These vibrators consist each of a pair of insulated capacity areas , well raised above the earth .
The effect of the earth , in so far as it is allowed to act , is to damp out vibrations and so to spoil tuning .
3 .
To prove this , the received energy was measured at a distant station by a Duddell hot-wire meter ; and a series of measurements was taken with the lower capacity at different heights above the earth , and also when connected with the earth .
4 .
Directly land-earth connection is made , tuning of the radiator and collector is nearly gone , for they no longer have any persistent free vibration period .
Samples of a large number of measurements are recorded in the paper .

On the Influence of their State in [ Mar. 9 , extreme ; small power is sufficient , and the inductive connection of the collector to the receiving instrument may be separated by a surprising interval without stopping communication .
6 .
Two sending instruments can work at once on the same aerial bisected electrically , and at the distant station two receiving instruments can receive independently and simultaneously from the corresponding halves of an aerial there .
7 .
Under these non-earthed conditions every other station , even near and powerful ones , can be tuned out and their disturbance eliminated .
8 .
The importance of the possession of power thus to hold conversation in the midst of disturbance , without being affected by it , and the naval danger of being without such power , are emphasised .
On the Influence of their State in Solution on the Absorption Spectra of Dissolved Dyes .

( Lond. ) , late 1851 Exhibition Scholar .
( Communicated by Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received March 9 , \#151 ; Read March 18 , 1909 .
) In a previous investigation of the absorption spectra and sensitising properties of some 'isocyanine dyes , * the influence of the solvent was examined and it was found that the absorption maximum was shifted toward the red as the refractive index of the solvent increased .
This is in accordance with Kundt 's law .
The absorption in water , however , differs markedly from that in organic solvents .
In the latter the spectrum consists of a prominent band in the orange and a half-shade nearer the blue.f In water this half-shade has become a separate band comparable in intensity with the orange .
Absorption curves in alcohol and water are shown .
It is convenient to term the band near the red the ^-(organic ) band , the one nearer the blue the a-(water ) band .
It appeared desirable to investigate this difference further .
