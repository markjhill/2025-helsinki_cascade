) It has often been pointed out that whenever a lightning discharge occurs between a cloud and the earth , or between two charged clouds , it must give rise to a violent disturbance of the local electrical field , which will spread outwards as an electric wave from the region of the discharge .
A lightning discharge may be aperiodic or oscillatory ; accordingly a solitary wave or a train of waves , as the case may be , travels in all directions from the centre of discharge till its energy is dissipated by divergence into space or by the absorption of the atmosphere , and thus the disturbance may reach great distances .
In wireless telegraphy these vagrant waves are a source of great trouble to the telegraph operator .
Being often very intense pulses or trains they frequently set the receiving autenna , whatever its natural period may be , into more violent vibration than do the signals being listened for , and not infrequently they compel the complete suspension of traffic .
By those engaged in wireless telegraphy , all these and similar disturbances are called , variously , " atmospherics , " " strays , " " statics , " or " X 's .
" When the usual telephonic method of receiving the Morse dots and dashes is employed , the strays are heard in the telephone as sharp clicks , as rattling noises , or as prolonged grinding or fizzing sounds .
There is no doubt that some of these noises are due to other causes than vagrant waves .
For example , it is well VOL. LXXXV.\#151 ; A. L Dr. W. H. Eccles and Mr. H. M. Airey .
[ Feb. 10 , known that wind-driven hail , snow , or rain , produce in an earthed antenna transient currents that can affect the resonant circuits and the telephone of the receiving apparatus , and other very local causes are conceivable .
But the travelling waves mentioned above , it has sometimes been surmised , form a considerable proportion of the strays heard on any occasion .
It is the purpose of the observations described below to settle whether the proportion of strays due to vagrant waves of distant origin is indeed of importance .
If it is , then the general properties of these waves , the limits of distance through which they can travel , and their meteorological significance ( if any ) , all seem worthy of investigation .
The particular point we are here enquiring into does not seem to have been investigated'before .
The sum total of the work published on the whole subject is very small , and no investigations specially directed towards the discrimination of the various causes are known to us .
The study of these natural electric waves was begun by Popoff shortly before the rise of practical wireless telegraphy .
In 1895 Popoff* * * S made use of a long vertical conductor ( such as a lightning rod ) in combination with a coherer in order to follow the motions of lightning storms through the atmosphere .
A filings coherer was used and was automatically tapped back after registering the effect of each lightning stroke .
In 1898 Boggio Leraf improved on Popoff 's apparatus as regards sensitiveness , and arranged that feeble and strong disturbances should be recorded separately .
His experiments with this apparatus in 1899 showed that the approach of electrical storms was heralded by frequent operation of the apparatus several hours in advance of their arrival in the locality of the observing station .
These results were confirmed by TominasinaJ in 1900 , using his carbon autocoherer .
In 1901 FenyiS showed that the thunderstorms occurring within a radius of 100 kilometres of his station at Kaloska , Hungary , were all recorded by his coherers .
Finally , Turpain , || in 1903 , made a long series of observations that proved the possibility of utilising these radio-telegraph apparatus and methods in the forecasting of thunder weather for hours and even days in advance .
We may remark at this point that the occurrence of numerous strays at a particular station is not necessarily followed by a thunderstorm in the locality\#151 ; the storm may pass wide of the station .
As a fact there are few days at any wireless telegraph station without its * Popoff , 'Journal of Russian Physico-Chemical Soc. , ' 1895 , vols .

1911.1 Note on the Electrical Wav 147 burden of strays .
Whether these are due to very distant lightning strokes , or to extra-terrestrial causes , is a problem as yet unsolved , and is indeed one of the points to whose elucidation our own observations are tending .
The plan of attack adopted by us in these preliminary experiments was as follows:\#151 ; One of us in London , and the other in Newcastle , arranged receiving apparatus just as for the telephonic reception of wireless telegraph signals .
Then we listened , at times agreed upon , to the strays that happened to he audible .
We recorded the principal atmospherics by an agreed system of pencil marks on paper which was ruled so that 6 inches represented a minute , each stray being recorded in its proper position on the paper by aid of the seconds hand of a watch .
The period of recording was about half an hour , and was usually arranged so as to terminate or begin at or uear a time when a regularly working long-distance transmitting station , such as Poldhu , Norddeich , or the Eiffel Tower , started or finished its signals .
The time signals from the two last-named stations proved exceedingly useful .
In this manner a fairly perfect time correlation was established between the records made by the two observers .
The observers exchanged " carbon " copies of their records , and made independent comparisons of them .

obtained on a day when there were many loud strays ; fig. 2 shows records of a less crowded day .
It should be explained that the height of the mark above the datum line represents the intensity of the sound in the telephone as judged by the ear of the observer .
The record may be described as a rough endeavour to chronicle graphically the strength of the strays as ordinates with the time as abscissae .
A comparison of the records shows that many of the marks made by the two observers coincide in time and , besides , bear a strong likeness to one another .
Other marks , again , bear great likeness , but are recorded as belonging to slightly different instants of time .
This last remark gives point to the principal weakness of the method , namely , that large errors may be Dr. W. H. Eccles and Mr. H. M. Airey .
[ Feb. 10 , made by each of the observers in deciding quickly the exact point of the axis of time at which to make the mark representing a stray .
In consequence , reasonable allowance must be made for these personal equations in counting the number of coincidences .
Table I is a summary of our results .
This table gives the total number of strays recorded in London ( M ) , the total number in the same time at Newcastle ( N ) , and the number of coincidences ( Ci ) between marks that possess a decided similarity .

bears to the smaller of the two numbers M or N. The figures in brackets show in metres the wave-lengths to which the receiving apparatus was tuned at each station .
From these latter figures it will be seen that both the antenna and its associated resonant circuit at one station were normally tuned to the same wave-length as the two circuits at the other station , but sometimes the antenna and resonant circuit at one station were , tuned to a wavelength different from those at the other station , and on a lieu occasions the antenna and resonant circuit at one and the same station had different wave-lengths .
Broadly speaking these differences in the adjustments ot the receiving apparatus had little perceptible effect on the number of coincidences afterwards found in the records , which indicates that the vagrant waves come in very short trains or as solitary waves .

] Note on the Electrical Waves , 149 To meet a possible objection to the above method of analysing the records , we give in Table II the results of analysing in a manner which purposely takes no cognisance of the fact that strong resemblances exist between individual strays .
Let T be the duration of the record at both stations in seconds , and suppose that M/ T and N/ T are small compared with unity , then the chance of one of the M marks falling within a time L/ 2 on either side of any assigned mark is LN/ T. This being true of every one of the M marks , provided that the time L rarely includes two of the M or of the 1ST marks , the probable number of coincidences in a random distribution of marks is therefore LMN/ T , a " coincidence " being defined as the occurrence of two marks with a time L/ 2 or less between them .
Now , if any of these coincidences are due to the operation of the same cause , as , for example , a distant lightning flash , these ought to be excluded from the application of the above formula .
Let their number be X. Let the number of observed coincidences be C. Then the chance coincidences are C \#151 ; X. But the random marks are M \#151 ; X and N \#151 ; X respectively ; and by the above formula the chance coincidences are in number L(M \#151 ; X ) ( X \#151 ; X)/ T. Equating this to C \#151 ; X , we get the quadratic equation , X3+{T\#151 ; ( M + N ) }X\#151 ; ( CT-MN ) = 0 .
This has a positive root , which is the probable number of atmospherics due to the same lightning stroke or discharge .
The number thus obtained is offered merely as a rough estimate ; the assumptions on which the formula is obtained are , of course , not strictly fulfilled .
In Table II , the results of applying the formula are set out .
There are columns headed C and X that did not appear in Table I. The latitude L Table II .

allowed in counting coincidences was 1 second .
It will be seen that almost the same conclusions are reached by this method of analysis as by the method of counting only strays wdiose graphs display some resemblance .
All the above observations , excepting those of July 26 , in Table I , were made during the half hour between 12.30 midnight and 1 a.m. ; those of the date named were made between 10.30 and 11 a.m. From a large number of forenoon observations , such as those of July 26 , we concluded that it was best to work at night .
This fact may be in some part due to the " strays " produced , possibly , by electric trains and trams or other local users of large currents .
Neglecting these daytime observations , the conclusion to be drawn from the above tables of results is that between 60 and 80 per cent , of the atmospherics audible at Newcastle and London , about 270 miles apart , are due to the same cause .
This cause is probably a discharge of atmospheric electricity at places whose distances from the stations are possibly of the order of several hundreds of miles .
We consider that these preliminary experiments are sufficiently encouraging to justify our extending the work by adopting automatic recording apparatus and by enlisting the aid of other wireless telegraph stations .
The Newcastle observations were made partly at the Armstrong College and partly at Cullercoats .
We take this opportunity of thanking the authorities of the Amalgamated Radio-Telegraph Company for permitting us to use their Cullercoats station for the purpose of the experiments described in this communication .
