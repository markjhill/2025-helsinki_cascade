" Considerationsphysiques sir le passage Nord-ouest ; " by the same .
Communicated bythe Right Hon. the Earl of Minto , G.C.B. F.R.S. The author of this memoir , considering that the practicability of a North-west Arctic passage must depend on the mean summer at ?
mospheric temperature of the most northern point of the continent of America being above that at which the congelation of sea water takes place , applies himself to the determination of these temperatures .
The results of his calculations are given in a table , exhibiting the extreme and the mean temperatures of the atmosphere for each of the summer months , from May to September , at all degrees of latitude , from 60 ?
to 80 ?
inclusive .
According to this table , the temperature of zero , which is about the freezing point of sea water , prevails , at 60 ?
of latitude , on the 10th of May ; at 61 ?
lat. on the 20th of May ; atG3 ?
, on the 1st of June ; at 65 ?
, on the 10th of June ; at 67 ?
, on the 20th of June ; and at 71 ?
, during the whole of the months of July and August .
The author concludes that navigators can reach , without danger of being obstructed by ice , the latitude of 71 ?
during these latter months : and that since the American continent does not pro ?
bably extend beyond 70 ?
north latitude a passage to the North-west is then open .
He recommends , however , that instead of attempting it by the dangerous navigation of the polar sea , a coasting voyage between the continent and the numerous islands which exist in that ocean should be undertaken ; or , what he thinks still more promising of success , an expedition by land for exploring the country intervening between the Copperrnine River and Hudson 's Bay .
