" By John V. Thompson , Esq. , F.L.S. , Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals .
Communicated by Sir James Macgrigor , Bart. , F.R.S. The author states that the Pentacrinus Europceus , which is fixed by its stem to other bodies , and consequently deprived of the power of locomotion , is produced from the ova of the Comatula , and becomes in asubsequent stage of its evolution detached , assuming the form of this genus of Asterida , and capable of moving freely in the ocean ; at one time crawling amongst submarine plants , at others floating to and fro , or swimming in a manner similar to Medusa .
