The Breitenbach Meteorite .
The Siderolite of Breitenbach was acquired for the British Museum in the year 1863 .
It was found ( in 1861 ) at Breitenbach in Bohemia , at a spot not very far distant from the Saxon frontier , or indeed from Kittersgriin , in Saxony , a place in which a very fine mass , that bears a close resemblance to the Siderolite of Breitenbach , was almost contemporaneously found .
A little way to the west of the centre of the line joining Bit-tersgriin and Breitenbach lies Steinbach , a village in the environs of Johanngeorgenstadt , near Schwartzenberg ; and here in 1751 was also found a mixed meteoric mass in which , as in the two already mentioned , iron , sponge-like in its structure , encloses siliceous minerals that do not present a familiar aspect .
The three meteorites are , in fact , so similar to one another and so dissimilar to any others in European collections , that there can be little doubt they belonged originally to the same meteoric fall .
Stromeyer* in the year 1825 examined a siderolite in which he found as much as 61*88 per cent , of silica .
This remarkable result , together with the numbers of his analysis , he interpreted as indicating the presence of a magnesian trisilicate , probably meaning thereby a sesquisilicate ( magnesium epideutosilicate ) .
The specimen which he analyzed he described as coming from Grimma , in Saxony .
This specimen was , in fact , a portion of a mass preserved in the collection of the Duke of Gotha , and doubtless believed by Stromeyer to be a portion of a stone which was known to have fallen in the middle of the sixteenth century in a wood near Naunhof in the neighbourhood of Grimma .
CHLADNT'j ' , however , held this view to be untenable , grounding his opinion on the completeness of the meteorite preserved at Gotha , both as regards its form and its crust , while he adds that the Naunhof mass must have been far too great to allowof its being transported , and , indeed , that it had never been rediscovered .
It is in every way probable that the material Stromeyer really had to work upon was from a Saxon locality , and in fact a specimen from a fall , to wThich the Bittersgriin and Breitenbach siderolites belong .
Breithaupt J believes the fall in question to have been the " " which occurred at Whitsuntide , 1164 , in Saxony , when a mass of iron fell in the town of Meissen S. An inspection of a polished surface of either of these masses reveals the iron in patches of irregular form , which exhibit the characteristic crystalline structure of meteoric irons * Poos .

when etched .
The interspaces are partly filled by meteoric pyrites ( troilite ) in small patches , recognizable by its pinchbeck brown colour , the rest of the surface being occupied by a greenish and greyish-brown crystalline magma .
It is of the ingredients of the last-mentioned portion of the meteorite that I shall first speak .
On treating the whole mass with mercuric chloride at 100 ' for some hours the iron and the troilite are dissolved , and the magma before alluded to remains unattacked .
But it has now lost its compound structure , and is found to consist of three substances:\#151 ; 1 , highly crystalline , bright green , or else greenish-yellow grains ; 2 , rusty brown , sometimes nearly black , sometimes also nearly colourless grains of a mineral that presents crystalline features , but on which definite crystalline planes are of great rarity ; and 3 , crystalline grains of chromite .
The first of these three minerals proved to be a ferriferous enstatite , or bronzite , the second is a mineral to which I do not at present assign a name , for it corresponds in all respects , except its crystalline form , with the tridymite of Professor Vom Bath .
In respect of their forms , however , it is difficult to suppose that the two minerals are identical .
XIII .
Bronzite of the Breitenbach My friend Professor Von Lang measured crystals of the bronzite of the Breitenbach meteorite at the British Museum so long ago as 1863 , and during last year he published his results * , \#151 ; results that were mineralogically important as affording for the first time satisfactory and complete data for the crystallography of a rhombic mineral with the formula of an enstatite .
This investigation was made exceptionally difficult by the very partially developed or merohedral character of the crystals on which Professor Yon Lang had to experiment .
A similar difficulty attended the crystallography of the silica of this meteorite .
I need only recapitulate of Dr. Yon Lang 's results the elements and some of the important angles of the crystal .
Elements:\#151 ; a : b : c=0*89568 : 0*84960:1 , which give the following angles by calculation:\#151 ; 110.010 = 44 8 101.100 = 41 11 011.010 = 40 16 The mineral often presents itself in little spherules , invariably green in their tint and crystalline in their structure , as revealed by their optical characters , and sometimes , but very rarely , carrying here and there a crystal face .
In fact the faces thus presenting themselves seem to do so almost fortuitously , and on the grains , which present a nearer approach to a true crystalline superficies , the faces that are developed exhibit very little of the symmetrical correspondence with other faces , or of the prevalence of those of any special forms , such as is ordinarily met with in crystals .
The specific gravity of this mineral is 3*238 , that of the silicates in the Steinbach siderolite , as determined by Stromeyer , having been 3*276 , and as estimated by Rumler 3*23 .
The hardness is 6 .

MINERAL CONSTITUENTS OF METEORITES .
The blackened aspect of some of the bronzite was due to a mere superficial coating of iron oxide , arising doubtless from the oxidation of a portion of the nickeliferous iron .
It was invariably found that this film was easily removed by hydrogen chloride , leaving the bronzite of a bright green colour , and that the action of the acid on the mineral extended no further .
Two analyses of this mineral were made , the one by the hydrogen fluoride method of distillation* , the other by fusion with mixed alkaline carbonates , and the results were as ioiiow:\#151 ; I. II .

Silica crystallized in the Rhombic Sys , as a Constituent of the Breitenbach Siderolite .
It has already been stated that the second mineral associated with the bronzite in this meteorite is free silica , possessing the lighter specific gravity presented by quartz after fusion , and crystallized in forms that belong to the orthorhombic system .
To this mineral , which is distinct in its system and forms from the tridymite of Vom Rath , I propose to give the name Asmanite A'sman , being the Sanscrit term ( corresponding to the Greek aK/ xw ) for the thunderbolt of Indra .
In bulk it forms about one-third of the mass of mixed siliceous minerals .
The grains of this mineral are found mixed with those of the bronzite after the iron , the troilite , and the chromite have been removed .
They are very minute and much rounded , and , though entirely crystalline , they very rarely indeed present faces that offer any chance for a result with the goniometer ; indeed out of the several thousand of these little grains comprised in some two grammes that were isolated of the mineral , it was only possible to find with a lens about a dozen specimens with sufficiently distinct crystallographic features ; and of these only four or five proved to be available for examination and comparison .
In several , however , the optic axes were plainly to be distinguished when properly examined with a Norrenberg 's polarizing microscope ; and by this means the angles given by planes belonging to zones otherwise too incomplete for a reliable result were brought into comparison on different crystals .
Fortunately one minute crystal was met with in which the consecutive planes in half of the zone [ 10 0 , 0 01 ] were complete enough to give reliable data for two of the parametral ratios , while the planes of the form ( 110 .
) in the zone TO 0 1 , 010 ] were all present , and one of them sufficiently brilliant to give an image by reflection .
This crystal , designated by the letter C in the subjoined Table ( p. 363 ) , enabled me to make use with confidence of the approximate measurements obtained on the other crystals , and the more so as in the polariscope it was easy to recognize in the normal to the plane 10 0 the first mean line of the optic axes .
* Philosophical Transactions , 1870 , p. 189 .
3 d 2 The rounded character which this mineral , in common with its companion mineral the bronzite , presents , suggests at the first view the idea that the sudden and intense heating which the mass must have undergone in its rapid course through the atmosphere may have fused , or at least softened , *the surfaces of the two minerals .
The rapid conduction of this heat into the interior of the meteorite , to which ordinary stone aerolites present much resistance by reason of the non-conducting character of their material , would in the case of a siderolite , where the iron forms a sponge-like and continuous mass , be greatly facilitated by the conductive character of the metal .
This view is encouraged by the extraordinary brittleness of the surfaces of some of the larger rounded specimens , which often , with the most careful handling , will fly into fragments , an outer crust which formed the rounded parts splitting away from a sort of inner core .
This inner portion is found to be far less brittle , and sometimes presents an irregular crystalline surface with one tolerably good cleavage-plane , parallel to the plane 0 01 , and others extremely irregular , but following approximately the directions of the planes of the form ( 11 0 ) , sometimes associated with the plane 10 0 , the edges of which , however , are still often rounded .
And yet it seems difficult to reconcile this explanation of the rounded forms and curiously merohedral character of the faces of these minerals , but especially of the bronzite , with the crystalline integrity of the entire grains to which the polarizing microscope bears evidence .
The bronzite , indeed , will sometimes be seen in the form of little spherules like fused drops with no faces at all , or at times with but one or two .
The silica has usually a more barrelled aspect , the octaid planes in particular being almost invariably , and those in the zone [ 0 01 , 10 0 ] being too usually , curved from this cause .
But both exhibit birefrin-gent characters , and the orientation of these accords with the symmetry of the crystals .
The crystallographic elements of the silica under notice are as follow:\#151 ; The parametral ratios are a : b : c=l-7437 : 1-0000 : 3-3120 .
The angles , as calculated from these data and as found on seven different crystals , are given in the following Table , in which the different letters serve to designate the different crystals .
The majority of these angles were measured by repeatedly observing the direc- OOl tion of maximum illumination of the planes by the telescope of the goniometer , converted by a lens in front of the object-glass into a microscope .
MINERAL CONSTITUENTS OF METEORITES .
The measurements thus obtained are necessarily therefore only approximative .
The faces 10 0 , 0 0 1,1 0 1 on the crystals A , C , and F gave images by reflection , and in the case of the crystal C the face 110 gave also a fairly good image .
The crystallographic elements were determined from the last-named crystal .

In fact the faces of the form ( 11 0 ) , though parallel to what appears to be a somewhat difficult cleavage , never present a good even reflecting surface , being generally more or less conchoidal when cleavage-surfaces , and dull when natural faces .
The cleavage-plane 0 01 has a vitreous lustre ; the lustre on the planes of the forms 10 0 and 101 , as also of the rounded surface in the zone with them , is usually of a resinous character , strongly recalling that of opal .
It has already been observed that the faces of the octaid forms are almost invariably rounded .
Fair approximate measurements , however , of three of the faces in the zone [ 001,110 ] on the crystal C were obtained ; and one octaid plane on that crystal , repeated in two octants , gave measurements that accord fairly with the somewhat complex symbol 5 4 8 .
This face , though not giving a reflected image , is the best octaid plane upon the crystal .
That the mineral belongs to the rhombic and not to a uniaxal system is emphatically evidenced , independently of these measurements , by its optical characters , as shown in its very distinct and widely separated optic axes .
As has been said , the first mean line is the normal of the face 10 0 , that to face 0 0 1 is the second mean line .
The first mean line is parallel to the axis of least optical elasticity , so that the crystal is positive in its optical character .
The apparent angle , as measured in air , of the optic axes was approximately determined as 107 ' to 107 ' 30 ' .
The axes for the red rays are slightly more dispersed than those for the blue .
The crystalline grains which constitute this ingredient of the meteorite , when first obtained , are of a rusty brown and sometimes even black colour ; treatment for a short time with dilute hydrogen chloride , however , entirely removes this iron stain and leaves the granules in a state of colourless purity , in which state they are readily distinguished from the grains of the accompanying bronzite .
The specific gravity of the mineral gave the number 2'245 .
Its hardness is 5*5 .
Two analyses were made by different methods , and the results are given below .
I. 0*3114 substance , distilled with pure hydrogen fluoride , gave 1*1136 gramme of potassium fluosilicate , 0*0035 gramme iron oxide , 0*0018 calcium oxide , and 0*0132 gramme magnesium phosphate .

0*79 100*00 Besides the distinct cleavage parallel to the plane 001 already alluded to , and the other , less distinct , parallel to the planes of the form ( 101 ) , there seem also to be divisional planes or , rather , surfaces along which the crystals break up with the greatest facility ; even drying them on blotting-paper proving often sufficient to destroy the integrity of specimens that might otherwise seem to promise good results to the goniometer .
Partsch* , in his description of the Vienna Collection of Meteorites , identifies as a specimen of the Steinbach siderolite a fragment with a label , " Native iron , jagged and hackly , with quartz in grains and a yellow fluor-spar " , zdhnicht gewachsenes JEisen mit kornichtem Quarz und gelblichtem BREiTHAUPTf , in his paper describing the Rittersgriin Siderolite , makes its chief silicate to be peridot .
It is doubtless bronzite .
In addition to troilite and schreibersite , he records the presence of " another mineral the composition of which is not yet determined .
" It should be mentioned that , with a view to test the relative solvent action of alkaline carbonates on quartz and the meteoric silica , weighed portions of each were digested with a ten per cent , solution of sodium carbonate for ten hours at 100 ' C. under precisely similar conditions .
Of the quartz 7*843 per cent , had dissolved , of the Breitenbach silica 9*437 per cent. XV .
Iron of the Breitenbach .
Of the other minerals forming the mass of this meteorite , namely troilite , some little schreibersite , chromite , present only in minute quantities , a crystal of which , however , was measured and gave angles corresponding to a regular octahedron , and , finally , the nickeliferous iron , which forms the sort of sponge-like skeleton that unites the whole , the last alone demands detailed investigation .
Two analyses , the former by the lead process , the latter by the barium method , gave the following results:\#151 ; I. II .

Some small amount of the above iron will have been present as troilite , which dissolved with the nickeliferous iron in the mercuric chloride .
Copper occurs in the Breitenbach iron , but only as a trace .
RubeJ , who analyzed the Rittersgriin iron , found iron 87*31 , nickel 9*63 , and cobalt 0*58 per cent. The material appears not to have been entirely free from silicate .

XVI.- The ShalJca Aerolite .
In the year 1860 the Ritter von Haidinger* first gave an account of the very remarkable meteorite that fell at Shalka , in Bancoorah , Bengal , on the 30th of November , 1850 .
The ash-like dark grey substance which forms the mass of this meteorite was described by the illustrious Viennese authority as a new silicate , to which he gave the name of Pid-dingtonite .
He was , in fact , led to do this in consequence of an analysis of the mineral by K. von Hauer , which yielded oxygen ratios corresponding to " a compound of bisilicate and trisilicate of iron and magnesium .
" This assumed sesquisilicate , however , which has haunted the mineralogy of meteorites under the names of Chladnite , Shepardite , and , subsequently , of Piddingtonite , was surmised by Gustav RosEf to be in this case a mixture of more than one silicate , while in the similar instance of the Bishopsville meteorite Dr. Lawrence Smith J had already proved the supposed Chladnite to have been no other than an augitic mineral , in fact one with the composition and characters of enstatite .
The mineral , however , which forms the mass of Shalka does not seem to be so easily disposed of ; for Professor Ram-melsberg S has recently published an analysis of the mineral or minerals under discussion , and asserts the Shalka meteorite to contain something like 12 per cent , of olivine of the composition 2Fe2 Si 04-t-3Mg2 Si 041| , the remainder being bronzite .
This meteorite had been examined some time back in the British Museum Laboratory with a very different result , and the discrepancies between this result and those as well of Rammelsberg as of Von Hauer induced me to have the analysis confirmed by further investigation .
The conclusion , however , to which these experiments have led still leave the discrepancy where it was .
In fact the selection out of the debris of the meteorite of the different ingredient minerals , or what seemed to be such , had at first led to the belief that it might indeed consist , first , of a grey silicate ; secondly , a more mottled grey and possibly mingled mineral ; and thirdly , chromite , which is present in considerable quantity , and often in very perfect crystals .
An analysis , however , of the mixed silicates gave a result so nearly in accordance with that of a definite enstatite , that the view seemed hardly tenable .
Furthermore , the analysis of the mottled variety gave as its result that this mineral is no other than bronzite .
The analysis of a very small amount of the debris of the meteorite gave the following numbers:\#151 ; Silicic acid . . . .
45-37 Oxygen .
24-197 Iron protoxide . . . .
19-06 4-236 Calcium oxide . . . .

MINERAL CONSTITUENTS OF METEORITES .
Two analyses of the mottled variety of silicate furnished the results given below .
I. Oxygen .

0-502 0-143 Magnesium oxide . .
24-266 9-706 24-085 9-63 Chromite . .
0*643 100-105 99-802 These numbers correspond with the formula ( Mgj Fe^)Si 03 , which is identical with the bronzite of the Manegaum meteorite* .
In fact the olivine found by Rammelsberg does not exist in the sample of the meteorite analyzed at the British Museum .
This is probably due to the portions of the meteorite examined in his laboratory and mine being from different parts of the mass .
To check these determinations , a portion of the mottled variety was submitted to the action of acid in the cold , and subsequent treatment with alkali to remove the liberated silicic acid .
The results now given show this action to have been confined to that of a solvent .
I. By treatment with a mixture of one part of strong hydrogen chloride and two of water for sixty-six hours in the cold , and subsequently with soda , there were removed the following percentages of Oxygen .
Silicic acid .
1-507 0-804 Iron protoxide . .
0-974 0-216 Magnesium oxide . .
1-058 0-423 3-539 II .
A corresponding treatment of another portion with a mixture of one part of strong hydrogen sulphate and two of water , for 240 hours , gave the numbers:\#151 ; Oxygen .
Silicic acid . .
3-900 2-08 Iron oxide . .
1-799 0-399 Magnesium oxide . .
1-877 0-75 7-576 The slight excess of iron found in both cases was doubtless the result of a little unseparated meteoric iron .
It certainly would not justify my assigning any appreciable portion of the silica to the constitution of an olivinous ingredient of the meteorite .
In recording the results detailed in the analyses here given , I have to express my obligations to Dr. Walter Flight , Assistant in my Department at the British Museum , for his skilful and zealous cooperation .
