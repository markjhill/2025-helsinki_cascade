An Account of a large Stone voided through the Urinary Passage , by a Woman .
Communicated by Dr. Richard Beard , F. R. S. Physician at Worcester .
Worcester , Jan. 29 , 1726/ 7 SIR , AMidst the variety of Observations , that have been made on the extraordinary Powers of Nature , that which follows may deserve a place .
A poor Woman in the Parish of Fladbury in this County , aged 63 , about 3 Years ago , was afflicted with the usual Symptoms of a Stone in the Kidneys and afterwards in the Bladder .
The Fits of Pain occasioned by it increased as its Bulk did ; till she was so emaciated by 'em , that her Case was judged desperate .
Finding relief ( towards the end of last Summer ) by a plentiful use of Mallow-Tea , she persisted in it for a while ; when on a sudden , in the presence of some Women she perceived an uncommon weight and force within which assisting with all the Strength and Breath she had left , a Stone came away with a Noise that very much surprised the whole Company , and with less Pain and Effusion of Blood then , or Soreness afterwards , than might have been expected .
She is since easy and in health and feels no other Inconvenience now , but that unavoidable one , an Incontinentia Urinae .
