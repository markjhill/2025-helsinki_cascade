TIIE scientific treatment of question may be said date f the researches of Count RUMFORD who , at the end of the eigh century , devised the first apparatus by which explosive pressures could be estimated with some degree of approximation .
During the past century the natural fascination subject , mport of the problems involved , attracted many of the ablest s:cientific ni .
Several ave made the study of explosions the object of their life work .
In the short space available , an adequate historical epitome is )rtunately impossible .
A mere enumeration of the names with which we shall ost frequently have to deal must therefore suffice .

The piston , Fig. 1 .
Explosion gauge .
( Maximum pressure indicator .
) The gauge consists of a double-headed piston , .
The smaller head is exposed to the pressure of the explosion , which is counterbalanced by a fixed gaseous pressure acting on the larger head P. The ratio of the two areas ( and therefore of the two pressures when in balance ) is fifty to one in the case of the gauge illustrated in this drawing .
The lift of the piston is limited to about one hundredth of an inoh , the distance of the stop being adjusted by means of a fine screw .
The piston on lifting closes an electric circuit and works an indicator .
is the stuffing box through which the stop passes , the cover of the cylinder in which the piston works ; it is held down by the nut N. is the gas inlet by means of which the space is connected to a source of supply of gas under pressure and to a gauge .
is the plug through which the electric connection to the insulated cbpioee H is made .
To prevent back pressure , which might arise through leakage past either of the leathers , the space X is connected with the atmosphere by means of the vent V. on lifting , closes an electric circuit and works an indicator .
To ensure rapid action , the travel of the piston is limited to about a hundredth of an inch .
Two such instruments were constructed .
The first , to 100 atmospheres , had a ratio of 4 to 1 ; in the second ( shown in fig. 1 ) , intended for nse up to 1000 atmospheres , the ratio of the areas of the two sides of the pietm wrs 50 to 1 .

In practice , however , the travel of the moving parts cannot be indefinitely decreased , for the deflections must remain of such dimensions as to be accurately measurable .
The following diagram illustrates the application of the principles we have just established to the construction of a recording instrument ( see fig. 2 ) .

Diagram of recording manometer .
A cylindrical groove is cut half through the walls of the enclosure .
The upper part , , of the cylinder thus obtained represents the piston of our indicator , and the lower portion , , the spring .
Under , the pressure of the explosion the piston will be forced outwards to an amount corresponding with the elastic compression of the material of which the spring is made .
This motion is transmitted to the exterior by the rod R. The lever , supporting the mirror , rests on the fulcrum at 3 ; is kept against the knife-edge 2 of by the tension of the wire W. The wire is of considerable length , and is stretched almost to its limit of elasticity .
The lever can , therefore , follow the small advance of the rod without greatly diminishing the tension of the wire W. The mirror focuses a point source of light on to a rapidly levolving cylinder , thus recording on a magnified scale : the motion of the piston P. It is not impossible that an indicator of this type would work in practice , but the deflection of the mirror , and , therefore , the scale of the records obtained , would be much too small .

Owing to the high speed required , the chronograph used for this work had to be specially designed .
It is unnecessary to go into all the details of its construction .
The ordinary methods were used to measure the velocity of the rotating drum and to ensure the constancy of speed during the course of an experiment .
When measuring the rise of pressure during an explosion , alinear speed of between 100 and 1000 centims. per second was used .
For measuring the fall of pressure during the cooling of the products of combustion the driving mechanism could be geared down to give a linear speed of 5 or 10 centims. per second .
The drum of the chronograph can be easily detached and taken to the dark room , where the photographic film is wound on ; it is then placed in a light-tight box .
As explained in connection with fig. 4 , this b.ox is so arranged that the drum can be Fig. 4 .
Chronograph camera .
The drum is shown fixed on the axle A of the chronograph .
To remove the drum without exposing the film which is wound round it to the light , the camera is first moved a little to the right , causing the ring on the camera to fit into the groove of the drum .
The brass tube is next forced into the groove ; its cover , , can then be removed and the nut unscrewed .
The camera , with the drum firmly held in it , can now be detached from the chronograph ( by sliding it to the right ) and taken to the dark room , where the film is developed and replaced by a fresh one .
fixed on to the axle of the chronograph in the full daylight without fogging the film .
The box surrounding the revolving drum is pierced with a long and very narrow slit ; this , in turn , is covered by a shutter , which is lifted immediately before the explosive is fired and closed again a second later , after the photograph has been taken .
Thanks to the above arrangement it is not necessary for the room in which the experiments are carried out to be absolutely dark .

The cavity was cut out of a solid block of rolled steel through an opening only inches diameter , a clever piece of engineering , for which I am indebted to Messrs. and Co. Exceptional care was also taken to give the inner a smooth polished surface .
The internal volume of the cavity was by weighing the mercury required to fill it .
From these determinations the diameter of the sphere is centims. The volume is , therefore , 556 cub. centims. and the internal surke 327 sq .

The cylindrical enclosule , shown in fig. 6 , is also made of mild steel .
The dimensions are : external diameter centims. ; internal diameter centims. ; length of bore centims. It has , therelore , a capacity of 550 cub. centims. and an internal surface of 709 sq .

The various apertures are identical to those of the spherical enclosure and the gauges and other fittings can , therefore , serve for either apparatus .
This cylinder has been used up to 2000 atmospheres and would doubtless be safe at a considerably higher pressure .
Firing Plug .
The design of the firing plug is clearly shown in fig. 7 .
Standard Gauges .
A vast number of measurements of statical pressure had to be made during the course of the work , more especially for the part dealing with gases .
For this purpose the connections were arranged so that the gauges could be easily interchanged , each one being used for the range over which it was most sensitive .
To determine the initial pressure and composition of the gaseous mixtures , two independent sets of observations were always taken .
The pressure was first roughly adjusted to the desired amount by means of direct-reading Bourdon gauges , then accurately measured by a standard gauge .
A series of mercury columns were used for the lower pressures and manometers of the Cailletet type for the higher pressures .

Valve and connecting cone .
The numerous valves required during the research were all substantially of the type shown in this figure , though varying considerably in external sbape according to the use for which they were intended .
The design was used for the valves serving to regulate the initial pressure and composition of the mixture in the experiments on gaseous explosives .
The apparatus is fixed firmly t.o the working bench by screws ( not shown in figure ) passing through the four corners of the metal block .
Into this cylinder the copper tube is soldered for a distance of about three-quarters of an inch .
These cone joints are superior to the lead washer joints , inasmuch as they are easily made or disconnected , last indefinitely , and remain gas-tight under all pressures .
PART ExPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION 0F THE EXPLOSIVE PROPERTIES 0F CORDITE .
* The maximum pressure developed by explosives can be measured with considerable accuracy by means of the crusher gauge , which was devised some thirty-five years ago by Sir ANDREW NOBLE .
The classical work since carried out by this investigator is too well known to need a mention here .
Attention may , however , be drawn to one of the more recent papers , in which NOBLE publishes the cooling curves of cordite and describes the instrument by which they were obtained .
The apparatus is in principle not unlike an ordinary steam engine indicator , but the spring is initially compressed by an amount corresponding to nearly the full pressure of the explosion , and is automatically released when this pressure has been reached .
By this ingenious contrivance the violent oscillations of the spring , which would be set up by the explosion itself , are avoided , and a clear record of the rate of fall of pressure is inscribed .
* The explosive used in the course of this was , by order of the Secretary of State for War , as representing the service cordite of the year 1902 .
Samples of three different sizes were included in the issue , the nominal sizes being 60/ 17 , 20/ 17 and $2 .

It is necessary to point out that such a method may not inffequently lead to most serious errors .
Finally , it is generally understood that , in connection with this subject , numerous experiments have been carried out at Woolwich under the direction of Major HOLDEN , but no results have as yet been published .
Experinoental Work .
A preliminary question to be decided , before starting the series of experiments , referred to the method of ignition .
The usual practice is to fire the charge of cordite by means of a small quantity of fine powder , which is ignited either by a percussion cap , or by a metallic wire which is brought to incandescence by an electric current .
Some records were taken in this way , but it was soon foumd that alterations in the amount and disposition of this firing charge , though leaving the actual maximum pressure almost unaflected , caused some variation in the shape of pressure curve ( see fig. 9 ) .
When a relatively small quantity of the igniting charge is used in an Time in seconds .

Effect of the of Cordite .
The velocity of the explosion depends primordially on the diameter of the cordite , but is modified to some extent by the distribution , the method of firing , and more especially by the gravimetric density .
Fig. 11 shows the rise of pressure for three Time in seconds .

The three tests were made der the same condition and in the same enclosure .
Fig. 12 relates to a similar experiment carried out at a higher pressure .
Lastly , in fig. 13 , the time required for the complete combustion of cordite of various is plotted for three distinct gravimetric densities .
The relation between the time occupied by the explosion and diweter of the cordite , as shown in this figure , is praoticdl.y a , the lines 9JneSOJd XWIn uo 9AISO[dX9 omWIp o pur spuoi ) 9JnSS9Jd ff SuIAtOqs Sld SmI , L IdXff s ( INV NO towards the zero of time and diameter .
We may , therefore , conclude that the combustion of finely divided cordite is nearly instantaneous .
Under such the result of an explosion would be very destructive , and it is possible that some abnormal effects which have on certain occasions bee .
observed may be due to the pulverisation of the explosive at any early stage of the combustion .
However rapid an explosion may be , it remains , in principle , very distinct from a detonation .
In an explosion the combustion is propagated from layer to layer without discontinuity .
In a detonation the chemical reaction is instantaneous and simultaneous throughout the.entire mass .
The determining cause is , in this case , compression wave of sufficient intensity to raise the material to its temperature of ignition .
Let us take for the sake of illustration a numerical example , although the values employed can only be rough estimations , and suppose a sphere of cordite 1 centim. in diameter under a gravimetric density of .
If this were ignited in the ordinary way , the combustion would travel towards the centre of the sphere at an average rate of 8 centims. per second and the maximum pressure would therefore be reached in second .
If , on the other hand , the material were to detonate , the detonation wave would travel through the mass at a speed of something like 800,000 centims. per second , the total time occupied would be one hundred thousand times less .
In an explosion we have usually to deal with pressures which may be considered as statical as far as their action is concerned ; in a detonation with a dynamical pressure or impact .
The impact of the products of combustion travelling with enormous velocity may correspond in effect to an instantaneous preSsure five or ten times greater than the normal pressure calculated ffom the composition of the explosive and its heat of reaction .
A typical case of this kind occurred when working with a compressed mixture of coal gas and oxygen .
The total pressure of the explosion should have been or 5 tons per square inch .
The mixture , however , detonated , and the solid steel piston of the recorder , though encased in a steel cylinder over 2 inches thick , was expanded outwards like the head of a rivet .
It is not easy to exactly the .
statical pressure required to produce a corresponding effect , but it cannot be less than 25 tons per square inch .
To return now to the work on cordite , the results obtained with one of the smallest diameters in use are. .
shown in fig. 14 .
It will be seen that , though the time occupied by the combustion is small , amounting to less than of a second , the shape of the *ABLE found that the rate of detonation of a train of mite or about 608,000 centims. per second .

This speed may be taken as proportional to the pressure .
The formula ( where 8 is speed in centimetres per second , the instantaneous pressure in tons per square inch , and an empirical constant equal to about ) may be of use where not possible to make a direct experimental determination .
The maximum pressure ( P ) developed by a given charge is usually well known , and by aid of the above formula the curve of rise of pressure can therefore be obtained The radius of the cordite for successive intervals of pressure \amp ; c. ) is first computed , and the time required to burn through the corresponding distance at the average pressure is then determine In calculating the radius , the volume of the unburnt explosive must , of course , be taken into account , and this renders the work somewhat tedious .
The formula does not take into account the fact that under experimental conditions some time elapses while the flame is spreading before the normal rate of combustion is set up .
The zero of the calculated curve is , therefore , shifted somewhat to the right , and a sharper slope given to the initial stage .
It may with some truth be argued that the error occurring at a very low pressure would not affect the results as applied to the calculation and experimental curves being in agreement by the time the motion of the shot commenoes .
It is hoped , however , that the day is not far distant when we shall be able to obtain an indicator card from a gun with the same ease as we now indicate other heat engines ; approximate ] ations such as the above will then cease to be of practical value .
We have explained above the system used for firing the charge .
When the key is pressed , the atmosphere of oxyhydrogen , with which the enclosure has been filled , explodes and the cordite is surrounded by a sheet of flame .
The time at which this takes place is recorded by a slight tremor of the gauge .
The charge does not ignite at once , though the explosive is surrounded by an intensely hot flame , a quite appreciable time is required for its surface to rise to the temperature of ignition .
The ignition begins at the ends of each stick or at other parts , where , for instance owing to a blister , the conductivity has been reduced .
The last parts to be attacked are those which were in contact with the walls of the enclosure or with some other portion of the charge .
These circumstances , together with a slow rate of combustion which is characteristic of cordite under very low pressures , account for the gentle slope of the first part of each curve .
* In the appended tables and curves , time is counted from the instant the cordito as marked by the first permanent rise of pressure .
A stick of cordite may under ordinary conditions be passed comparatively slowly through flame of a Bunsen burner without igniting .

In previous papers*I have pointed out how the rate of transmission of heat in a gas varies with the pressure .
In the case of air , for instance , the law was verified up to C. and 170 atmospheres .
At this pressure already air transmits heat at the same rate as a substance having twenty times the conductivity of air at atmospheric pressure .

With a gravimetric density of the amount of heat to be absorbed per unit surface of our cylindrical enclosure is some hundred times as large as that which would be absorbed by the cylinder of an ordinary gas engine .
In the case of artillery of large calibre the inner surface of the steel probably attains a temperature close to its melting-point and the correspondingly plastic material yields easily under the combined friction and chemical action of any escaping gas .
In the case of small arms , the temperature being limited by the relatively small volume and therefore small thermal capacity of the gaseous mass , practically no erosion takes place .
To return now to the experimental work .
In the following table the time required for the pressure to fall to three quarters , one half , one quarter of its maximum value is given for a number of distinct experiments , whereas the cooling curves for three different diameters of cordite at gravimetric densities of and will be found plotted in fig. 16 .
It is noticeable that after the first tenth of a second the curves taken under similar conditions , but for various sizes of explosive , lie closely together , showing that the diameter has no material effect on the subsequent rate of cooling .
When we refer , however , to the table , we see that the times required to reach a given fraction of the maximum are different for different diameters .
This apparent discrepancy is explained by the fact that the total quantity of heat absorbed is primordially a function of time .
When the combustion is very rapid , the maximum pressure is reached while the walls of the enclosure are still cold and the percentage fall of pressure per unit time is high .
With a slow-burning cordite the surface of the enclosure becomes considerably heated during the combustion of the explosive , and after the maximum the percentage fall of pressure is correspondingly lower .
Briefly stated , at any fixed interval of time after ignition the total heat absorbed by the enclosure , and , therefore , the temperature of its inner surface , will be nearly the same for all diameters of the explosive .
In consequence , the rate of cooling as measured by the rate of change of pressure at any stated time is unaffected by the speed of combustion .
The rate of cooling for a given volume of the enclosure does not vary , as is usually assumed , in proportion to the surface , but nearly as the , square of the surface .
It will be noticed that the cooling in the cylinder is about four times as rapid as in the sphere , whereas the ratio of the two surfaces is as to 1 .
In such massive enclosures .
the heat generated by the explosion is at first entirely absorbed by the inner layers of the steel walls .
It does not travel to he outside until some time after the explosion is over .
A decrease in the surface has , therefore , a double effect .
The heat to be absorbed per unit area and th6 average thickness of metal through which this heat must be transmitted are both increased .

The present work was not taken up with a view to specially investigating the above subject , which has already been fully treated by .
It is , however , of interest to compare the results with the much more complete set published by this investigator .
To minimise the effect of the rapid rate of cooling , which , as we have just seen , is inherent to small enclosures , we must select for comparison the values obtained when using cordite of relatively small diameter .
The pressures obtained with cordite of inch and inch diameter are shown in fig. 17 , marked in on the curve representing NOBLE'S results , and are , as will be seen , in close agleement with it .

Variation of maximum pressure with the gravimetric density of the charge .
The curve is traced out from the values given by Sir ANDREW NOBLE the points marked on it refer to the results incidentally obtained in the course of the present work .
Though the pressure and temperature are exceptionally high , there is no reason for supposing that the products of combustion depart considerably from the law which governs the pressure of gases at ordinary temperatures .
This law may be written In the present case , where the temperature is very high and constant , we may put , and for a first approximation neglect cohesion of the gas .

Taking these circumstances into account , the agreement between the theoretical and experimental values may be considered satisfactory .
Distribution of the Explosive .
In a long narror vessel a certain amount of vibration almost invariably occurs during the combustion of the explosives .
If the explosive is concentrated in one part only of the enclosure , the effect is increased and the pressure rises by sharp steps , as shown in fig. 18 .
With some powders the sudden increments of pressure become Fig. 18 .
Diagram showing the type of vibration set up at the commencement of an explosion when the charge placed in a long enclosure is not uniformly distributed .
The successive sharp increments of pressure correspond with successive impacts of the wave .
dangerously large and an abnormally high maximum is reached in one or two steps .
This phenomenon seems to be the transition between an explosion and a detonation .
That it is difficult , in fact almost impossible , to detonate cordite has long been ecognised as one of its principal advantages .
Nevertheless , signs of abnormal explosion were visible whenever the charge was crowded together in one part of the enclosure .
A fairly typical case is shown in fig. 4 , Plate 21 , a similar effect being recorded in many other cases , notably , and ( Tables XI .
, XII .
, XIIr The experiments in this direction had to be confined to pressures of about 1000 atmospheres .
From these tests it seems probable that by working under similar conditions , but with a higher gravimetric density , cordite would give results not unlike those obtained by VIEILLE* in the case of ' ' B.F.\ldquo ; and other powders .
See " " Etude des Pressions 'Annales des Poudres ' vol. IIL .
pp. VIEILLE , in the course of this , obtained instantaneous pressures amounting to three times the normal value .
Using a method of calculation similal to that given below , he showed that the speed of propagation of the smaller disturbance is in fair agreement with the speed of sound in the medium .

Carrying out this operation we find .
The value of the ratio of the specific heats , , is somewhat uncertain .
For the mixture of gases resulting from the explosion , may be taken as or , according as the specific heats are considered constant or variable with temperature .
The following table gives the velocity of sound , calculated according to each of the above hypotheses:\mdash ; VELOCITY of Sound in the Gases Produced by the Combustion of Cordite at the Maximum Pressure of the Explosion , measured in Metres per Second .
The limiting value for low densities , which should correspond with the speed of the wave at the commencement of the explosion , works out at 1170 or 1108 .
Although , strictly speaking , the above theory applies only to very small disturbances , the calculated velocities are in fair agreement with the measurements given on The oscillations referred to in the preceding paragraph are superimposed on the curve of pressure without directly altering its general shape .
Within the limits of the present experiments the wave action , consequent on the uneven distribution of the charge , by increasing the thermal loss slightly lowers the maximum pressure .
rate of combustion is , also , somewhat altered ; usually it is acceierated .
These effects will be best understood by reference to figs. 14 , 19 , and 20 , in which the mean values of the pressure are plotted in terms of the time .

It would doubtless be very desirable to extend the research to higher pressures and carry out , on similar lines , a comparative study of other explosives .
Treated , however , in this general way the subject is too vast to be dealt with single-handed , and the writer can but express a hope that others more competent and better equipped will be found willing to take up the work .
