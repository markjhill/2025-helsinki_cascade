Account of a monstrous Lamb .
In a Letter from Mr. Anthony Carlisle to the Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. K.B. P.R.S. Read January 29 , 1801 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1801 , p. 139 .
] The head of this animal , or rather foetus , for it was not born alive , was disproportionately small , and had no resemblance to the natural form except in the external ears , which were contiguous , and placed on the front part of the head .
Between them was an opening , which proved to be the common passage to both the oesophagus and the trachea .
All the organs which are usually found on the face were here wanting ; there being neither eyes , nose , nor any of the apparatus belonging to the mouth : the cranium was formed into a hard bone , bearing a near resemblance to the head of a tortoise , and about the size of a plover 's egg .
On dissecting this singular production , it was found that the whole cerebrum and all its nerves were wanting .
It is hence inferred that the formation and growth of animals in the uterus are independent of any influence from those parts of the brain which properly belong to sensation .
The author regrets that this animal did not live to show the phwenomena of volition directed to its limbs and other parts , without that intelligence from the organs of the senses which regulate the actions of perfect animals .
A careful observance of such circumstances , he thinks , might lead to discoveries of the greatest importance in that part of physiology which is still enveloped in much obscurity .
