Kerigan , R.N. Communicated by Admiral Sir Edward Codrington , F.R.S. The author has recourse to the moon 's right ascension as an element for determining the true meridian of the place of observation : his method being an extension of that given byhimin the first volume of his " Mathematical and General Navigation Tables .
" He gives examples of the application of this method , and considers that with the aid of a chronometer showing the approximate mean time at Greenwich , the longitude of any given place may be determined , either at sea or on land , within very narrow limits of error , and with much greater practical convenience than by the ordinary method of lunar distances .
