) The presence of nickel , as shown by the examination of soot , is not positive evidence that the dust from the clouds comes from other than a terrestrial source .
( 2 ) The dust which fell on the 16th and 17th of November , 1897 , with its regularity in composition and its similarity to meteorites , being magnetic , also its comparative freedom from extraneous matter , exhibits properties which are quite in favour of its cosmic origin .
Moreover , its composition is totally unlike that of volcanic dust and flue dust from various chemical and metallurgical works .
This dust for the most part fell on a perfectly calm fine night , and there was no rain for twenty-four hours or more afterwards .
We beg to draw attention once more to the very wide distribution of gallium in minute proportions ; it occurs in all aluminous minerals , flue dust of very different kinds , soot and atmospheric dust , also in a great variety of iron ores .
Bauxite contains it in larger proportion than any other mineral , but the quantity even in this substance is very small .
We have hopes of finding it concentrated in some mineral , as thallium , caesium , germanium , and indium are .
Indium and thallium , the other members of the same group of elements , are found in blende and pyrites , and accordingly we might expect gallium to occur in a concentrated state in a sulphide , arsenide , or similar compound .
Judging , however , from its analogy with aluminium , there does not seem to be much probability of this .

The interesting account by Mr. Lunt* of his identification of three lines of silicon , corresponding with three unknown lines in the spectra of certain fixed stars , contains the following remarks:\#151 ; " It is a curious fact that Hartley and Adeney , and Eder and Valenta , who alone give us any extended list of lines due to silicon , appear not to have examined the spectrum of this element in the region of the three rays here considered .
Their published wavelengths show only lines in the extreme ultra-violet , and the majority of them are quite outside the region which can be examined by the McClean star spectroscope .
" There is an inaccuracy here , and a similar mistake as to authorship occurs in the paper of Eder and Valenta .
Silicon was not one of the sixteen elements whose spark spectra were investigated by Hartley * ' Roy .

" On Line Spectra of Boron and Silicon , " by me , gives descriptions and wave-lengths of lines characteristic of these elements which were observed in solutions of borates and silicates.^ Having some of the spectra photographed in 1883 , I find upon examination of the plates that they were closely investigated at that time .
They show no trace of any line of silicon less refrangible than 288T0 ( Angstrom 's unit ) .
There is a line at the less refrangible extremity of the spectrum which , to judge from its position , is yellow or yellowish-green in colour ; but it certainly does not belong to silicon , because solutions of a silicate , and of hydrofluosilicic acid containing 1 per cent. , OT per cent. , OOl per cent. , and OOOl per cent , of silicon , show this line to be stronger in the spectrum given by OOl per cent , than in any other of the photographs .
It has every appearance of and no doubt is the well-known pair of sodium lines with a mean wave-length of 5893 .
A concentrated solution of sodium silicate gave no stronger indication of this line , and only a feeble representation of the strongest sodium line 3301 .
This may be accounted for by the remarkable fact referred to in the original paper , that the lines of the metal in borates and silicates seem to be suppressed when the spectra of boron and silicon appear with greatest intensity , but if the quantity of the borate or silicate in the solution is diminished , the sodium lines gain in strength .
There is , however , a line near a very strong air line seen in the spectrum of a 1 per cent , solution .
It continues to increase in length and intensity in other spectra as the proportion of silica diminishes ; otherwise it would not be noticeable because it is extremely short , feeble , and enveloped in air lines when photographed from a 1 per cent , solution .
A solution equivalent to O'OOl per cent , of silicon yields a spectrum in which this line is about one-fourth of the length of the air lines , and of the seven carbon lines in other parts of the spectrum .
It is in fact the least refrangible carbon line from the graphite electrodes 42(56'3 ( Hartley and Adeney ) , and is visible and of normal strength and length on photograph No. 10 in the 'Journal of the Chemical Society , ' vol. 41 , p. 90 , 1882 .
It is one of those lines which is occasionally absent from the carbon spectrum , and it is somewhat * 4 Phil. Trans. , ' 1884 , Part 1 , p. 63 .

111 lengthened when the electrodes are wet.* It is doubtless a carbon line , for Deslandresf gives its wave-length as 4267 ( Rowland 's unit ) , and he used carbon purified in Moissan 's electric furnace .
The least refrangible of the silicon lines on my plates is at wave-length 288T0 , and it corresponds with a line in the arc spectrum 288IT ( Living and Dewar ) .
There is a group of air lines } 4446*02 , 4432*58 , 4425*90 , 4415*51 , and 4413*60 , then come 4628*95 and 4674*2 , but there is no trace of any silicon lines between 4573 and 4553 where Mr. Lunt found three .
Mr. Lunt used a powerfully disruptive discharge , and that apparently is sufficient to account for the difference in the spectrum which he obtained .
I have always employed very simple apparatus , but it happens that when investigating the coefficient of extinction of the various rays of silicon a second series of experiments was made with a more powerful coil and jar .
It was found that when all the lines had become very short , and the weaker lines had nearly disappeared , they could be reproduced to a great extent from the same solution by increasing the capacity of the Leyden jar or condenser , but as only extremely dilute solutions of silicates were used , the lines obtained by Mr. Lunt from the solid silicates did not appear .

Some Additional group as they are seen when a 1 per cent , solution and graphite electrodes are used , and of two isolated lines which are less refrangible ; with them are compared the lines photographed from other more dilute solutions .
The sodium line 3301 appears as a long line in the 1 per cent , solution and becomes shorter as the quantity of substance is reduced .
Observations were carried as far as a solution containing 0'000001 per cent , of silicon , the two strongest lines being still visible , hut as the photographs of these more dilute solutions have been damaged by being kept so long a time in the atmosphere of the chemical laboratory , they are not now available for similar measurements .
As the sodium lines are suppressed when the silicon lines are strong , the two carbon lines are also reduced very much in length and strength .
This is very easily observed on account of the close proximity of the silicon lines , the wave-lengths of the two carbon lines being 2508T and 2511*6 ( Hartley and Adene}^ ) .
In the more dilute solution , these lines are observed to be lengthened until they become of the normal dimensions of 20/ 100ths of an inch .
It thus appears more than probable that the suppression of the sodium does not result from any chemical action within the spark discharge , such as might be supposed to occur if the sodium were dissociated from the compound , and being in contact with a silicate were to liberate silicon , or to combine with silicon directly , and in presence of water give rise to the formation of silicon hydride .
The suppression of much of the sodium spectrum , and the shortening and weakening of the carbon lines , is more likely to be a purely physical phenomenon than the result of any chemical reaction in the spark .

( Abstract .
) The paper contains notes on two examples from Greece and four from Sicily\#151 ; of these , three are of the nature of amplification and correction , and three are fresh cases .
