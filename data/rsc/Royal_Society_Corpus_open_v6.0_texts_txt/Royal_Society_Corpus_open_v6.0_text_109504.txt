Account of a Peculiarity in the Distribution of the Arteries sent to the Limbs of slow-moving Animals ; together with some other similar Facts .
In a Letter from Mr. Anthony Carlisle , Surgeon , to John Symmons , Esq. F.R.S. Read Jan. 9 , 1800 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1800 , p. 98 .
] This peculiarity was first observed in the axillary arteries and in the iliacs of the Lemur tardigradus , which at their entrance into the upper and lower limbs were found to be suddenly divided into a considerable number of equal-sized cylinders , which occasionally anastomosed with each other , and were regularly distributed on the muscles ; whilst the arteries proceeding to the other parts of the body divided in the usual arborescent form .
Upon prosecuting this inquiry , it was found that the Bradypus tridactylus , and in some measure also the didactylus , has a similar distribution of these arteries .
This peculiar disposition of the arteries in the limbs of these slowmoving quadrupeds , it is thought cannot but retard the velocity of the blood passing into the muscles of the limbs .
Whence the well known sluggishness of the animals , to whom this configuration seems as yet peculiar , will perhaps be ultimately accounted for .
Something similar has been observed in the carotid artery of the lion , which it is thought may be subservient to the long continued exertion of the muscles of his jaws , in holding .
a powerful animal for a length of time ; and lastly , it is conjectured that the ruminating animals have a somewhat similar aplexus of arteries in the neck , which operates in retarding the velocity of the fluids in those parts .
