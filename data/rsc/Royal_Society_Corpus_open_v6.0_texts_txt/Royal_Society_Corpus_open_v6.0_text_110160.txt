On the Effects produced upon the Air Cells of the Lungs when the Pulmonary Circulation is too much increased .

] In examining the air cells of the lungs of a hare that had been coursed , the author found the superficial large cells filled with colourless coagulable lymph , forming white specks , and the smaller , more interior ones filled with coagula of red blood .
No such appearance was seen in the lungs of hares , snared or shot .
A run of fifteen minutes with greyhounds so exhausts the hare , that it is frequently known to die from over exertion before the dogs are able to reach it .
To examine the state of the lungs , in which the white specks were seen , they were injected with mercury through the bronchize , and then immersed in rectified spirits to prevent them from collapsing , and in this state examined microscopically and drawn .
by Mr. Bauer .
The drawings accompany the paper .
The white specks appear to be portions of coagulable lymph , separated from the circulating blood in consequence of its disturbed state , and the author considers them as giving great insight into the nature of that destructive disease called tubercles in the lungs ; and in support of this idea quotes Dr. Baillie 's description , and refers to his plates of them in his Morbid Anatomy .
