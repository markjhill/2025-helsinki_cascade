) BEFORE entering on the investigation which forms the object of this communication , it will be necessary to recall to recollection some general properties of the differences of the powers of the natural numbers , or of the numbers comprised in the general expression A " 0 " , which I have elsewhere demonstrated , as well as to establish certain preliminary theorems by the aid of those properties , which will be useftll in the progress of the inquiry .
I shall employ throughout the separation of the symbols of operation from those of quantity , as respects A and 0 , in the manner followed in my paper " On the Development of Exponential Functions , " published in the Philosophical Transactions , vol. cvi .
p. 25 ( 1816 ) , and further extended in its application in my " Collection of Exarnples of the Applications of the Calculus of Finite Differences , " appended to the translation of LACROIX 's Differential and Integral Calculus in 1820* , to which paper and collection the reader is referred for the demonstration of the fundamental properties in question .

( 12 .
) ( 6 .
) Furthermore , it will be necessary to recall in what follows , the notation and conventions of 'circulating functions , ' as explained in my paper on that subject , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818 , vol. cviii .
p. 144 .
Denoting by sx the sum of the xth powers of the sth roots of unity divided by s , or the function s(+ &amp; +P +r+ &amp;c. ) , where a , y , , &amp;c. are those roots , any function of the form A..s-+B,.s-+ ... .Nx.s_- , S+ will circulate in its successive values as x increases by units from 0 : being expressed by Ax when x is a multiple of s ; by BI , when x1 is such a multiple , and so on .
If AZ , B. , &amp;c. be simply constant , the function may be termed a periodic one , since it assumes in periodic and constantly recurring succession the values A , B , C ... .N , A , B , &amp;c. ad infnitum .
If s be a specified number , as 2 , 3 , &amp;c. , we shall not the less use the notations 23 , 3t , &amp;c. to express the respective quantities 2(.x+P ) , ( a ( Ma+Pl+r ) , &amp;c. , where a , ( 3 , &amp;c. are the corresponding roots of unity .
And we shall accordingly have the following general relations , in which P , and Q , denote any circulating functions , such that Px=a,.s+b,.s._- , -+c,.s_-2+ &amp;c. . .
, Q , = A,.s , + B.sx_ + Cs_,2+ &amp;c. f(P .
, Q , ) =J(a , , A , ) .
s+f/ ( b , B. s , _ , + &amp;c. , of which , particular cases are f(P , ) =f(a , ).s +J(b).s_ , .
+f(c).s_2 + &amp;c. P=:=a.s+b.sx-+c'.s- , -2+ &amp;c. QJ_= Q.:as.s+ Q7sx_1 + Q.ss_2 ?
a &amp;c. .
P , Q =a,.A,.s+t.Bx,.sh_-l+ &amp;c. .
( 7 .
) As special relations to which we shall refer , we have ... .

&amp;c. , and consequently f{P .
, Q )=f/ { a. , A)}.m , +f{b , , B)}m_ , + &amp;c. ... .
For example , ( a.2+ b. 2 , _ , )(A.3 , +B.3- , _+ C.3_-2 ) =aA.6 , +bB.6 , _ , +aC.61_2+6A.6_,3+aB.6_-4+bC.6_5 , .
( 11 .
) The readiest way in practice and the surest way to avoid mistakes , which in complex cases are very likely to occur , is to proceed by a much easier process , as in the following example .
Suppose we would express the product of the three periodic functions P , =2 , +2.2_- , , Qv=3 , +2.3_,1+3.3_,2 R--=4 , + ?
2.4._-1+3.4x_2+4.4_3 , the product of 2 , 3 , 4 divided by the greatest common measure of 2 and 4 is 12 , which will therefore be the period of the product .
Write then the several coefficients in order as follows : for P , 1,2 ; 1 , 2 ; 1 , 2 ; 1 , 2 ; 21 , 2 ; &amp;c. Q , 1,2 , 3 ; 1 2 , 3 ; 1 , 2 , 3 ; 1 , 2 , 3 ; &amp;c. R. 1,2 , 3 , 4 ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; &amp;c. 1 , 8 , 9 , 8 , 2 , 12 , 3 , 16 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 24 , and we shall have for the product 12x+ 8.12 , _ +9 .
12x2+-8 .
12 , _3+-2.12_4+ ... ... .
24.12_i , .
If the signs of the coefficients , or any of them , differ , they must be of course annexed to each , and the proper sign affixed to each product .
( 12 .
) If we denote by s the integer part of the quotient of any number x divided by another s , then , universally , xx x-1 5-S-+ ==.s , +s -+ ... -sX_ , +i ; ... .
( 23 .
) =s-s0 .
+ .
-+2.s2 2+ ... .s-1.x._+i and therefore the remainder , in the same division , is expressed by x x-s.-=O.s +l.s , _1+2.s_2+ ... -..s-1._ , + ... ... ( 24 .
) ( 13 .
) If , again , we would express the integer part of the quotient in the division of by a second integer division t , we have , putting y for SY -t'-0.+.Yt.t+ ... * t =-s--{0.+ I* +* **I('5-)S-s+l } -{o ? .
t+l.l+- ... ... ( t-1).ty-t+ } ; . .
( 25 .
) and so on as far as we please .
( 14 .
) The periodic function O. tie +l.ty-+ &amp;c. depends implicitly on x , because y is dependent on x. Its value however ( as well as that of any other implicit periodical function ) is very easily obtained by following out the process explained in ( art .
11 ) .
Suppose , for example , we had the more general periodic function of y , qY=a .
tie + b. tie _-+ ... .h .
tie _t+l .
Then we may write down the successive values of x , y , qy in order thus : x 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ( s- ) ; 8 , s+l , ... .
( 2s-1 ) ; 2s , ... ... ; ts , , .
y 00,0 , ... 0 ; 1 , 1 , ... .
2 ... . .
; t qy a , a. .
a , a , ... a ; c , .
, ... .
; , ... ... , ... Thus we see that qy is a periodical function of x , having for its period st instead of either s or t separately , the first s coefficients being all alike and each =a , the next s all alike and each =b , and so on ; or q , =a{(st ) , + ... +(st)_-S+IS } +b{(t)-S..+ ... ... ( t)X-2s , + ... . .
+h(st)Xt+s+ ... .
( St ) , } , + } .
( 26 .
) ( 15 .
) Hence we are enabled to express the value of explicitly as a periodic funct tion of x ; for by equation ( 25 .
) , if we put st=n , nt -'{ .

But by equation ( 21 .
) we have s~ =n+ -n_ +n-2S+ ... n~_s+s S , -l =.-n_-l -s_-l~+_ *-* ... *.-ns+s-l ) &amp;c. ; and by the equation ( 26 .
) of the foregoing article , ty= , x-s , +n , -s-1 + ... .
, * These relations premised , let it be required to express the sum of x terms of the series p(a+b)+{(a+2b)+ ... ... p(a+xb)=S , .
Developing the several terms , we find S , =p(a)({l -+ +l ... x terms } b -+.P ( a ) ( 1+2+3+ ... ..x } b6 +b t(a){l2+22+32+ ... .2 &amp;c. Substituting then for the series of powers of 1 , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. their values as given by equation ( 11 .
) , and separating the symbols of operation from that of quantity , we get 1S( xr-(1 +b )V-( .
0 S.= ( .
P(a ) -a-p'(a ) . ?
i.0 '- &amp;c. 0 2( .
p(a-b.O ) .
( 28 .
) ( 17 .
) If we use in like manner equation ( 12 .
) , it gives S ( --(l+A)(l++A)-lcp(aa+{b.0)-=(1 +a^)~ , ( a { .b{a b b0). .
( 29 .
) by employing the transformation of equation ( 3 .
) , in which x= , f(O ) =p(a+b.O ) .
Hence also , if S=-p(a)+p(a+b)+ ... .
; ( a+--1.b ) , we find in like manner AS !
p(a+b .
) ... ... ... . .
( 30 .
) ( 18 .
) Let it next be required to find the sum of the series S , =(p(a+b)+p(a+2b)+ ... .+(a+yb ) to y terms , where y== the integer part of the quotient of an independent index S number x , divided by any given number s. By equation ( 28 .
) we have sy_l-(1 a ) -y SP(a--b.O ) .
Now since x x-1 x-s+ 1 y=s s-_+ S---s~-1 + ... ..S=-O.sx+ I s+ 1).s .

1 If we put P=--s ; of=.s+l , s_+ &amp;c. } we get by equation ( 9 .
) , AS =-(-k^ ( a-b.A)+0 l(+ p(a-pb-b.0 ) .
Now the first portion of this , sincep= - , is explicit in terms of x , but the other requires further development , for which we must have recourse to equation ( 16 .
) , putting Q , = ( 1 + A ) and P=q==s ( 0.s+ 1.s_ , + &amp;c. ) , where we find 12 ( 1 + A)q=-(1 + A ) ?
.s+ ( I + A).s + ( 1 +A).s_2+ &amp; c^ But we also have by equation ( 18 .
) , 1= s+ s_ , + s_+ &amp;c. Therefore , subtracting and dividing by A , and applying each ternm of operation to the term n(a-pb-b.O ) of quantity , 1-L~~~ 2 1-_)q 1-1+ 2A ( a_~ + -p s_ c(a-pb --b .
0 ) I.---o s(1+a _-(I +a)~ =O.S+(a(a--pb-b.O).s_ A ( a-pb-b.O).s_++ &amp;c. .
( 31 .
) ( 19 .
) The expression for Sy in the last article is general and entirely independent of any particular values assigned to x , a , b , s , the only relation established being that expressed by the equation y= = .
Suppose therefore that in a certain proposed case we should have a=x+-s-1 ; b= -s ; and therefore pb=x ; a-pb=s-l , and the expression for the sum of the series becomes S( ) p(x+s--l+s.O ) 1 .

( 32 .
) in which expression the first member or non-periodical part is an explicit function of x and s , and the periodical part has all its coefficients independent on x and functions of s alone .
( 20 .
) The periodical part of Sy is however susceptible of another form , better adapted for numerical calculation , into which it may be thrown by making p=q= in equation ( 9 .
) , when it becomes 21 1()= , ( o)=-(1 +a f(o)+ 1 , ( f+o in which , forf(0 ) writing 9(s-1 +s.O ) , it becomes a^ ( s-l+s.O0)= ( s+s.0)+P(s+s.0 ) Similarly , 1--( ] +a ) " l-cl ?

Supposing , then , for brevity , we denote the combination by and tat e put , l'(s)-=(s-1 ) ; ,2(s)-=(s)+(s ) ; , ( s)-=(.sI)+(s)+ ?
( s+l ) ; &amp;c. , then we shall have , finally , S,1=(1a ) +s-i +s.O +O.s , +sO_ , V ( s+O.s ) +s _-2.VX 2(S+O .

) =X+Y , where X represents the non-periodical part , a function of x , and Y the periodical , whose coefficients are constant .
( 21 .
) For the actual evaluation of these functions , all we have to do is to develope the operative characteristic in powers of A , and the attached functions in powers of 0 , and to apply them term by term to each other .
As regards the function X , we find , by so doing , 1{x X= 1[ S~X ( x + s ) ( x + s ) +{(x+s)(+2s ) ?

) As regards s , in every part of the following investigation it will be regarded as a mere given integer number , so that the coefficients in s will come to be calculated in absolute numbers and need give no further concern .
It is otherwise with those in x , which mix themselves up with the x contained in p(x+s1 ) and its differential coefficients in a way requiring special examination , as functions of an independent variable .
Let us therefore consider the term multiplied by d ) p(x+s1 ) in the development of p(x+s1-s.0 ) .
This term will be expressed in ARBOGAST'S notation by s , .
On 1.2 ... ..D ( +s-1 ) and the corresponding term in X will be S. D ( +s-1-(1 + A)-S0 1 ... n Dn(X+-l ) An The development of this in factorials x , x+s , x+2s , &amp;c. , and functions p ' , p ' 11 , &amp;c. , is accomplished in equation ( 35 .
) , but if we would effect it in powers of x we must proceed as follows : Suppose e=2'7182818 , &amp;c. Then we have 1 -(1 + A)-is o l1-el0 ) A=A0x log( + A)0 x { log(1 A)}2 x { log ( 1 + ) -1,.s ยง 1.2.s'2 A+ 1.2.3 " a But by equation ( 5 .

This is in fact no other than EULER'S expression for the sum of the series 1-+2f'+3'+ &amp;c. to a given number of terms represented by s , only that in the case here under consideration may be any fraction , while EULER'S demonstration of the series in question is essentially confined to -= a positive integer .

( 41 .
) ( 26 .
) We shall now proceed to the more immediate object of this paper , viz. the expression of the number of ways in which a given number x is susceptible of partition , the number of parts being given .
Let s be the number of parts into which x is to be divided , and let SII(x ) represent the number of s-partitions of which it is susceptible .
It is evident then that if s=1 there is but one possible , so that in all cases '11(x)-1 .
If s=2 , the partitions stand thus : 1 , x-1 ; 2 , x-2 ; 3 , x-3 ; ... whose number is - .
Therefore we have xxI " n(x)= -- .
22 xIf s=3 , the partitions so grouped as that none shall be twice repeated , will stand as follows:1 , 1 , x2 2 , 2 , x4 33 , , x--6 , &amp;c. 1 , 2 , x-3 2,3 , x-5 &amp;c. 1 , 3 , x-4 &amp;c. &amp;c. The first column will consist of all the possible bipartitions of x1 , each associated with 1 , and their number is therefore 2I(x--1 ) .
The second will consist of the bipartitions of x-2 , exclusive of ( 1 , x-3 ) , each associated with 2 .
Their number therefore will be identical with the total number of bipartitions of x-4 , because , so far as the number of cases is concerned , it matters not whether we consider x-4 as parted into ( 1 , x5 ) , ( 2 , x-6 ) , &amp;c. , or x-2 as parted into ( 2 , x.-4 ) , ( 3 , x-5 ) , &amp;c. , the reason of which will be obvious on trying any particular case .
The number of terms therefore in the second column will be 21i(x-4 ) .
In like manner that in the third will be 2IH(x-7 ) , the bipartitions of x-3 beginning with ( 3 , x-6 ) , being identical in number with those of x--7 , beginning with ( 1 , x-8 ) , and so on .
Thus we have '3((x)=21(X 1 +2T(X-4 ) +2(x7)+ &amp;c. Next , with respect to the number of terms to which the right-hand member of this equation is to be continued : it will be that of the columns , which will continue without repetition so long as the number x-2m in the first combination ( m , m , x-2m ) of any one of them shall be not less than m , or so long as x-3m shall not be negative .
xx I-Hence we must have m= = , since the next greater value of mn , viz. m==+zl , will give 33 the tripartition ( + 1 , 3I1 , x-2 --2 ) .
Now x cannot exceed 3.3 by more than x 2 , so that x-2=--2 cannot exceed 3 and must therefore be less than x +1 .
Hence 3 3 ' 3 we conclude that the number of tripartitions is derived from that of bipartitions by the equation 3'1(x)=2Ir(x1)+2FI(x--4)+ ... 21(x7 ) ... to3 terms .
3 ( 27 .
) Applying a simiilar reasoning to the higher cases , we shall find as follows:s s-1 s--1 s--1 X H(x ) = l(x- ) + I(x--l ) + I-2s-1 ) ... ..terrms ; ... .
( 42 .
) sa relation which , with many others of greater generality , has also been arrived at by Mr. WARBURTON .
( 28 .
) Suppose now we set out from the equation '(x)= 1 , and proceed to derive from this value those of 2'1(x ) , 3'(x ) , &amp;c. in succession .
It will be apparent from the course of the foregoing investigations , and from the nature of circulating functions , that the general expression for 1I(x ) must consist of two portions , the one non-periodical , a function of x , and which may be represented by p(x ) , the other periodical or circulating , which we may denote by Q , , so that we shall have in general to consider the s-1 following form of l(x ) , s--1 Il(x ) = @(Z)+ Q , , s from which to derive the value of I1(x ) .
When we substitute this in the general expression ( equation 42 .
) , we get ( -s 1 ) ... . .
( y tems ) f1(x)--(x-l)q-(x--s1 ) ... ... ( y terms ) +Q1+Q+ ... . .
*(y terms ) , x where y= N. Now with respect to the first portion of this , if p(x ) in any one case be sa rational integral function of x , it will be so in all subsequent cases , as is evident s from the course of the preceding investigations .
This part of 1I(x ) then has been already dealt with , and its complete expression is X+Y of equations ( 34 .
35 .
) , or ( 38 .
39 .
) .
We have therefore now only to consider the remaining portions , which we shall call Z , viz. Z=Q_-l+Q-__.+ ... y terms , Q , may represent any circulating function .
Suppose it to be such that Q--1=%o(X).m +m l(x).n _-1+ ... . .
Xm-1(X ) .
, ,+ , and let any term of this , as Xi(x)m^(which for brevity we will write simply X(x).m , , putting z=x-i ) , be separately considered .
Let R be the portion of Z which originates from this term .
Then R=-(x).m+-(x--s).m_+ , X(x2s).m , _ ... .(y terms ) .
Let ts=n be the first multiple of s , which is also a multiple of m. Then after t terms the value of mi , m , , &amp;c. will recur , and therefore R resolves itself into t separate series , as follows : R=-m{(.X)+X(x-n)+(x.-2n)+ ... .(Y +1 l)terms } +-m~_S{(x-s)+x(x-n-s ) + ... ... ... .( terms } +n-_(aS(x-2s)(r+(x-n-2s ) + ... .

' The whole assemblage of such terms , giving z all its values , from x to x-m+ 1 , therefore will constitute a circulating function explicit in x , and which we shall denote by Z ' .
As regards R " , since s and t are given numerically , it constitutes a periodic function with constant coefficients , to obtain which we have only to consider that , supposing any one of the exponents p-+qx to be represented by a.n , +h._.n-+c.n -2+ &amp;c. , we shall have by equation ( 16 .
) , 1-(1 + A ) *x+V'~ I -(I + x)a 1-(I + )b A.n , nI+ &amp; C. ( 31 .

Xm-1 +Mi-ml so that if we should meet with such expressions as Xn , %Xm+I ' &amp;c. , they are to be taken as equivalent to , oX %,1 &amp;c. , a mode of regarding a series of arbitrary constants occurring in a certain order which will tend greatly to simplify and add clearness to what follows .
Now we have , generally xi being constant , -(l + )h --~ A -h.Xi .
Consequently , the terms R ' and R " of R , corresponding to Xi in the same way as R ' and R " in general to % , will become Rt{M+m _+ ** * ... .m-ts+s}.n %i R'I --{m , +m_S ... ..me_ }.p~.Xz -m-s{n+^t ?

Now because m and s have v for a common measure , and that n=-ts is the first multiple of s , which is also a multiple of m , it follows that n=-.m , being an irteger .

) To apply the foregoing formulae to the expression of particular cases as 23412 II(x ) , n(1x ) , H(x ) , &amp;c. , we begin with H(x)= .

) The periodic function 0.60 , + ... .
&amp;c. may be somewhat simplified by resolving it into the sum of three others , having respectively 10 , 20 and 30 for their periods .
For on inspecting its coefficients , we find that the differences of any two , distant from each other by 30 , are alternately +360 and -360 .
Now if we suppose , generally , any such function as a0 .
60-+a,.60x , + &amp;c. to be made up of the sum of three others , po .
30 , +pl.30_ , + &amp;c. q0.20 , +q,.20 , _-+ &amp;c. ro.10Ox+r , .

Among the sixty coefficients therefore which this assurnption places at our disposal , twenty remain arbitrary , and may be put =0 .
Suppose , for example , qi-=- , pi+20=0 , which give pi=ai a+0 , pi+io= ( aai+30 ) + ( ai+10 -a+20 ) qi+ lai+0 -ai , rii+20 .

) The problem , " In how many ways can a given number be constructed , " is reduced by the author of a short but interesting paper in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal , iv .
p. 87* , to the integration of the equations of differences ux , Y=U , -y , u +y and ux , y-uX_y y=x- , Y which last equation corresponds to the case where it is required to find in how many ways x can be composed of numbers none greater and not all less than y. The analogy of this problem with that here treated is obvious , the function ur , y being in effect y identical with that which in the above notation would be expressed by fl(x ) , y corresponding to our s. Accordingly , as far as y=4 , to which limit only the inquiry is there extended , the results are identical ( the mode of expression excepted ) with those of our equations ( 49 .
) , ( 50 .
) , ( 51.)t .
The method there pursued ( by the successive integration of equations of differences ) would of course continue to afford similar results , but without some systematic processes of notation , transformation and reduction , such as those delivered in the foregoing pages , would speedily become too complicated to be followed out , though the sort of form which would ultimately be assumed by the result seems to have been clearly apprehended .
Observing that in the cases of y=2 , 3 , 4 , the results express in fact the nearest integers to certain rational fractions , such as X2 t3 3X2 X3 + 32 -9 12 in the case ofy=3 , 2 ( x even ) and c ( x odd ) when y=4 , it is suggested that " probably this simple species of description might be continued .
" This , on examination of the value above given , when y or s=5 , appears to be the case , but for higher values it will be necessary to enlarge the terms of the description , so as to take in circulating fiinctions of higher orders , and with more complicated coefficients .
To make this apparent , suppose s=6 .
Then , without going into the whole calculation ( which however would not be materially more complicated than for s=5 , and would lead , as in that case , to a final period of 60 , only not reducible to the sum of lower periods ) , it is easy to see , that besides a non-periodic portion of 5 dimensions in x , and a periodic one with 60 constant coefficients , there will also be a circulating portion of the form a,.6 , +t,.6x , +-b ... ..6t whose coefficients may rise to the second dimension in x. In fact , if we execute the calculation of this portion by the foregoing processes , we find for the values of the coefficients 45002+ 15750x 3209x --a=e:-0 ; b-- , a-i172800 ; C--72800 With regard to the constant coefficients of the periodic portion , it is easy to see , from the manner of their formation , that they must all fall very far short , in numerical magnitude , of the half of 172800 , so that the whole effect of this periodical part does , in effect , go to adjust the final value to the nearest integer of the rational fraction arising from the assemblage of all the terms in ix , and a similar reasoning will apply in all cases .
( 42 .
) The number of partitions of which a given number x is susceptible , admitting 0 into them as a component part , is the sum of the number of I-partitions , bipartitions , tripartitions ... up to s-partitions .
It may therefore be found , by adding together all the values of H(x ) , from s= to s=s inclusive .
But it may also be obtained by formulae in all respects similar to those above demonstrated ; for if we take HTs(x ) to represent this species of partition , we have , if s=l , Ill(x ) =1 as before .
For s=2 the partitions stand 0 , x ; 1 , x-1 ; 2 , --2 ; ... ( + l)terms , that is , ( x)= II , ( ) i(x-2)+ ... ( +l ) terms .
Similarly , nI3()=I1(x)+12(x-3)+ ... ( + l)terms , and so on to ncs)=n._i(a)+ n _( s-+ ... .(j+l-1 ) terms , of which the formulae of ( 30 .
) and ( 31 .
) , duly applied , give the value !
