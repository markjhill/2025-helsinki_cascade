53 7 On the Measurement of the Atmospheric Electric Potential Gradient and the Earth-air Current .
By C. T. R Wilson , F.R.S. ( Received March 4 , \#151 ; Read March 19 , 1908 .
) In previous papers* I have described a method of measuring the charge upon and current through a conductor exposed to the earth 's electrical field and maintained at zero potential .
The present paper contains an account of a series of such measurements , taken primarily with the object of testing the method , and , in particular , of gaining some evidence as to whether it is legitimate to deduce from the " dissipation factor , " found for the exposed " test-plate " of the apparatus , the current from the atmosphere into each square centimetre of the ground when the potential gradient is known .
With the object of gaining information on this question , alternate measurements were made with the apparatus in its ordinary condition , and with its test-plate covered with turf .
It was thought that if the ratio of the current to the charge on the exposed surface were found to be the same in the two cases , it might with some confidence be assumed that the same ratio would hold for the current and charge per unit area of the ground .
As will be seen later , the ratio of the current to the charge remained within the limits of experimental error unaltered when the test-plate was covered with turf .
The charge on an exposed earth-connected conductor , always maintained in the same position relative to the ground and other objects , may be taken as proportional to the charge per square centimetre of the neighbouring level ground , or to the potential gradient .
Experiments were therefore mad e to determine the factor by which the charge on the test-plate had to be multiplied to give the charge per square centimetre of the ground .
This having been done , the measurements made with the test-plate require merely to be multiplied by the appropriate factor to give the charge per square centimetre of the ground , and also the current entering each square centimetre of the ground .
The observations were carried out on the farm of Hundleshope , about three miles from Peebles and about 25 miles south of Edinburgh.-]* From September , 1906 , till April , 1907 , inclusive , the place of observation was on a nearly * 'Cambridge Phil. Proc. , ' vol. 13 , pp. 184 and 364 , 1905\#151 ; 6 .
f I take this opportunity of acknowledging my indebtedness to Mr. Brownlee , of Hundleshope , for his kindness in affording me every facility in carrying out these observations .

On Measurement of [ Mar. 4 level field in the bottom of a valley , about one mile wide , lying between hills rising on the north to 1314 feet ( Cade-muir ) , and on the south to 2248 feet ( Hundleshope Heights ) , the bottom of the valley being about 700 feet above sea level .
The later measurements were taken a few hundred yards to the south of this point , just within the mouth of a smaller tributary valley , also flat-bottomed , in which the grass was kept short by sheep .
Apparatus and Method .
The apparatus only differed in dimensions and in minor details from that described in the previous papers already referred to.* The electrometer used is a gold leaf instrument of a type suitable for the measurement of potentials only differing slightly from zero ; the essential feature of the instrument being that the gold leaf hangs within an inner case , maintained at a suitable constant potential by means of a quartz Leyden jar .
Supported by an upward prolongation of the vertical metal rod which carries the gold leaf is a horizontal blackened brass disc , the " test-plate , " 7 cm .
in diameter ; it is provided with an earth-connected guard ring ( external diameter = 17 cm .
) , from which it is separated by an annular air gap 2\ mm. wide .
A cylindrical cover rests upon the guard ring , and shields the test-plate , except when it is to be exposed to the influence of the earth 's electrical field .
If the conducting system which includes the gold leaf and test-plate is momentarily earthed , and the cover is then removed ( the apparatus being freely exposed in the open air ) , the gold leaf will be displaced , its potential being raised if the electrical field is in the normal direction of fine weather .
The potential is at once brought back to zero by means of a " compensator " ; the reading of the compensator when the reduction to zero potential is effected serves to measure the charge now held on the upper surface of the test-plate .
The charge measured is what would exist on the upper surface of the test-plate if it were earth-connected .
If the exposure be continued for a short time , the compensator being adjusted as may be necessary to keep the test-plate at zero potential , and the cover heathen replaced , the charge which has entered the test-plate from the atmosphere in a known time may be determined , the current from the ( atmosphere into the test-plate when exposed under the same conditions as an earth-connected body .
The compensator actually used had the form of a cylindrical condenser , of which the inner conductor was a metal rod connected to the gold leaf system , * The apparatus was made by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company .
1908 .
] Atmospheric Electric Potential Gradient , etc. the outer conductor being a brass tube , maintained during any series of observations at a constant negative potential by means of a quartz Leyden jar , and capable of sliding parallel to its length to give a variable capacity .
The capacity of the conducting system , which included the gold leaf and its supporting rod , the compensator rod and the test-plate , was measured according to the method described in the previous paper.* Under standard conditions , i.e. , with the cover over the test-plate and the compensator tube drawn out to its zero position , it amounted to 15'2 cm .
The calibration of the compensator was also carried out by the method described in the same paper .
It was found to be an improvement to have the central rod of the compensator somewhat longer than in the instrument there described ; by this means the calibration curve was made to approximate very closely to a straight line throughout its length , i.e. , the displacement of the compensator tube required to bring the potential of the gold leaf system to zero is very nearly proportional to the charge to be measured .
The displacement of the gold leaf per volt amounted to 2 divisions of the eye-piece micrometer of the reading microscope over the range of deflections used .
The electrometer , with its test-plate and guard ring , rested , during the open-air observations , on the top of the wooden box in which the instrument was kept when not in use , the height of the test-plate and guard ring-above the ground being then 70 cm .
The observer reclined on the ground , and , having his eye at the microscope and his hand on the compensator , always occupied the same position relative to the apparatus .
In making a series of observations , the following was the usual order of operations .
The cover was placed on the guard plate , the compensator was pushed through a definite number of scale-divisions from its zero or standard position , the gold leaf system was then momentarily earthed and the compensator drawn back to its zero position ; the gold leaf deflection was then read .
The charge corresponding to this deflection is known from the sensitiveness of the electrometer ( the deviation per volt ) , and the capacity of the gold leaf system under standard conditions , and it requires for its neutralisation a known displacement of the compensator\#151 ; from zero to the position which it occupied when the gold leaf system was earthed .
The charge corresponding to any other displacement of the compensator is then known from the calibration curve .
This test only required to be performed two or three times in the course of a day 's observations on account of the high insulation of the quartz Leyden jar which maintained the potential of the sliding tube of the compensator .

540 Mr. C. T. R. Wilson .
On Measurement of the [ Mar. 4 The gold leaf system was again momentarily earthed ( the compensator being in its zero position ) , and at a definite instant , as indicated by a watch hung from the support of the microscope , the cover was removed .
The compensator was at once pushed in to bring the gold leaf ( deflected on removing the cover ) back to its zero position .
The compensator reading was noted ; this gives the charge on the upper surface of the exposed test-plate when earth-connected .
The exposure was continued for a definite number of minutes ( generally from two to five ) , the compensator being moved as might be required to keep the gold leaf system at zero potential .
When the desired time of exposure was completed , the cover was replaced and the compensator drawn out to its zero position .
The gold leaf reading was now taken , the gold leaf system being then earthed and the new zero reading taken .
The difference between the last two readings , the sensitiveness of the electrometer and the capacity of the gold leaf system being known , gives the charge which has entered the test-plate from the atmosphere during the exposure .
Finally the cover was again removed and a second reading of the charge on the test-plate obtained as before .
An exactly similar set of readings was made with a circular piece of turf , held in a shallow tinplate box above which it projected for two or three centimetres , resting on the test-plate .
The capacity of the gold leaf system , with the turf on the test-plate and the cover over it , was determined by comparing the deflection of the gold leaf , initially at its zero position , which was produced by drawing out the compensator to its standard position from a given initial position , with that produced by the same operation in the absence of the turf .
The potential differences , corresponding to the same charge for the gold leaf system with and without the turf on the test-plate , were thus compared .
This determination of the capacity having been made , the other operations which have been described for the test-plate enabled the charge upon and current through the turf to be measured .
The same piece of turf was generally used throughout a day 's observations .
The charge on the turf was generally about three times that on the test-plate alone .
Results .
( 1 ) Comparison of the Dissipation from Different Exposed Surf aces .
The dissipation factor is expressed as the percentage of the charge on an earth-connected exposed body which is neutralised per minute .
I give first the results of some comparisons which were made of the dissipation from the test-plate and from a cylindrical metal cylinder resting on the test1908 .

The cylinder was a tinplate box 5 cm .

The charge on the box when exposed to the earth 's field and at zero potential was found to be about 2'3 times that on the test-plate under the same conditions .
Under dissipation are given the means of the dissipation factors for each day .

In the following table are given the results of a series of comparative measurements of the dissipation , made alternately with the ordinary test-plate of the instrument and with a piece of turf , placed in a shallow tinplate tray , resting on the test-plate ; the test-plate was completely covered by the turf .
The dissipation factor is calculated by finding the ratio of the charge gained by the exposed conductor per minute to the mean of the charges on the conductor at the beginning and end of the exposure , the potential of the system being maintained at zero throughout .
The dissipation factors given for each day are the means of all the observations of this comparison series taken on that day ; the number of the comparisons made is given , as well as the mean charge on the exposed test-plate during these observations .
This series gives practically the same mean value for the dissipation from both test-plate and turf , and there is , on the whole , pretty good agreement for the individual days .
There is , however , a rather serious discrepancy on August 30 , when the mean dissipation from the turf is considerably in excess of that from the test-plate .
Both the intensity of the electric field and the dissipation were , however , very variable on that day , and the difference is probably accidental .
There is no evidence of any tendency for 542 Mr. C. T. R. Wilson .
On Measurement of the [ Mar. 4 a difference to show itself on calm days with bright sunshine , when any specific photo-electric effect in the case of either the turf or the test-plate might have been expected to make itself manifest .
Days of bright sunshine were not , as a matter of fact , days of unusually high dissipation .

The charge on the turf was always about three times as large as that on the exposed test-plate ; it is , moreover , concentrated on the tips of the projecting grass blades ; the conditions are , therefore , very different in the two cases . .
The agreement is sufficiently good to afford strong grounds for assuming a definite dissipation- factor depending on the condition of the atmosphere .
Further comparisons for very weak fields are , however , desirable .
It is , perhaps , of interest to add the results of the individual comparisons for one day .
I give those of September 10 , 1907 , a calm day with cloudless sky but some haze , most of which was dissipated in the early afternoon .
The electrical field was unusually steady .

The results contained in the foregoing tables afford fairly strong grounds for assuming , for a given place of observation , that the fraction of the charge per unit area of the ground which is neutralised per minute is the same as that found for the test-plate of the apparatus .
It seemed desirable , therefore , to determine the factor by which the charge on the exposed earth-connected test-plate has to be multiplied to give the charge per square centimetre of the ground in the immediate neighbourhood , sufficiently far away , however , to be unaffected by the presence of the observer and apparatus .
The same factor , if the dissipation factor be assumed to be the same for the ground as for the test-plate of the instrument , will serve to deduce the current per square centimetre of the ground from that through the test-plate , which is directly observed .
For the purpose of determining this reduction factor , a large test-plate , which could be placed with its upper surface very little raised above the surface of the ground , was made ; it was provided with a guard plate .
The test-plate and guard plate were of wood , which was found to conduct sufficiently well for the purpose ; the test-plate was 12 inches square , the guard plate was also square , the sides being 24 inches in length .
The gap between them was \ inch wide .
The guard plate and test-plate formed the roof of a shallow box , the total height from the upper surface of the roof to the under surface of the base being 2 inches , and the space between them 544 Mr. C. T. R. Wilson .
On t Measurement of the [ Mar. 4 , being 1 inch .
The test-plate rested on three feet embedded in sulphur plugs filling cylindrical holes bored half-way through from its under side .
A wooden cover , 17 inches square inside , rested on the guard plate , there being a space of 2 inches between the test-plate and the roof of the cover .
A V-shaped notch was cut in one side of the cover to allow the passage of a wire between the test-plate and the electrometer .
The wire was attached to the lower surface of the wooden test-plate , efficient contact being ensured by means of a sheet of tinfoil gummed over the wire and the surrounding wood .
The wire led from the large wooden test-plate to a terminal which could be fixed on the upper surface of the ordinary test-plate of the instrument .
In the actual experiments the horizontal distance between the centres of the two test-plates was about 90 inches , the vertical height of the small test-plate being in these , as in all the measurements , about 28 inches above the ground .
Alternate measurements were made of : ( 1 ) the charge on the small test-plate , on removing its cover and bringing to zero potential by means of the compensator , and ( 2 ) of that on the large test-plate , the same method of removing its cover and bringing the potential of the system to zero by the compensator being used .
In making the measurement of charge on the large plate , the terminal attached to the connecting wire was placed on the small test-plate ( the other end of the wire being permanently attached to the large test-plate ) , the gold leaf system , with test-plates and connecting wire , was momentarily earthed , and the large cover removed to a distance , the compensator being then adjusted to bring the gold leaf to its zero reading and the cover at once replaced .
The compensator reading required to give zero potential was then read again ; if the operations were sufficiently quickly gone through and the electrical field wTas not too variable , the last reading was generally zero , the time of exposure being short enough to prevent any appreciable gain of charge from the atmosphere .
Since the small test-plate and the connecting wire were exposed even when the large test-plate was covered , any change of field during the time required for an observation to be completed was troublesome .
It was found convenient to have an assistant to remove the cover and to replace it according to signal , as the time required for an observation was thereby shortened .
On removing the cover the assistant retired to a distance of several yards , at which distance it was found by trial that he was without effect on the field at the large test-plate .
The presence of the electrometer and observer wrere also without any marked effect on the charge on the large test-plate .
To test this point it would be sufficient to place conductors of similar size and shape at an equal distance on the other side of the large test-plate and observe wffiether any effect was produced on removing them to a distance or replacing them .
An approximation to a test of this kind was 1908 .
] Atmospheric Electric Potential , etc. 545 effected by stationing the assistant at the point referred to and looking for any displacement of the gold leaf as a consequence of his rising from a lying to a sitting posture .
No such displacement could be observed .
It was necessary to make a large number of comparisons of the charges on the large and small test-plates when exposed to the electric field of the earth and brought to zero potential , on account of variations in the potential gradient .
The mean of 12 such comparisons , made on March 29 , gave 5*65 for the ratio of the charge on the large plate to that on the small test-plate .
The observations on this day were carried out without assistance , and the time taken to complete an observation with the large plate was generally long enough to cause a measurable charge to be gained by the plate , which was detected on replacing the cover .
On April 1 , a longer series of observations was made with the help of an assistant , and in 13 of the comparisons of charge no appreciable charge was gained by the large test-plate .
The mean of the ratios of the charges on the test-plates given by these 13 comparisons was 5*60 .
The mean of 10 other comparisons of the same ratio , in which a correction had to be made for the charge gained by the large test-plate , amounted to 5*66 .
The value of the ratio obtained from the observations to which no correction had to be applied ( 5*60 ) is the one used in the calculation of the reduction factor .
The effective area of the small test-plate ( obtained by adding half the area of the gap to that of the test-plate ) is 41*3 sq .
cm .
, that of the large test-plate , obtained in the same way , 968 sq .
cm .
, the ratio of the areas being 23*4 .
This gives for the ratio of the surface density of the electrification on the small test-plate to that on the large , 4*2 .
The density on the large test-plate , 12 inches square , at a height of 2 inches above the surface of the ground , and surrounded by a guard plate making up the flat surface exposed to an area four times that of the test-plate , has been taken as not differing appreciably from that on the general surface of the ground .
The ground was not sufficiently flat , nor the grass sufficiently short , to make it appear worth while to attempt to determine the correction to be applied .
The mean density of the electrification upon the exposed test-plate when at zero potential has been taken as being 4*2 times that upon the surface of the ground .
In the table which follows are given the charge and current per square centimetre of the ground in electrostatic units , deduced from the corresponding quantities for the test-plate , by multiplying by the appropriate factor .
The charge and current per square centimetre of the ground are also given in coulombs and amperes , the potential gradient deduced from the charge being also given in volts per metre .
In each case the values given are the means for the day over the range of time named in the first column .

] Atmospheric Electric Potential , etc. 547 The results given in the above table may be divided into three groups according to the type of weather on the different days .
The following days were calm , with practically cloudless sky and bright sunshine , with a certain amount of haze : September 29 , 1906 , April 18 , September 9 , 10 , and 28 , 1907 .
The atmosphere was very clear , with a considerable amount of cumulus about , on January 10 , April 6 , July 5 , August 30 , and September 7 , 1907 .
The sky was almost completely overcast on October 1 , 1906 , January 8 and 14 , July 3 , September 13 , and October 1 , 1907 .
The dissipation factor was least ( mean = 6*6 per cent , per minute ) for the cloudless , calm days , greatest ( mean = 11*2 per cent , per minute ) for the days with cumulus and clear atmosphere , the overcast days giving an intermediate value ( mean = 8*05 per cent , per minute ) .
It is remarkable how nearly the mean value found for the current per square centimetre of the ground ( 2*2 xlO-16 ampere ) agrees with that deduced by Gerdien* ( 2*4 x 10~16 ampere ) from the results of measurements of conductivity and potential gradient .
The agreement is no doubt to some extent accidental ; a systematic series of regular observations extending over a considerable period would be required before a trustworthy mean value of the current could be obtained .
