A paper was read , entitled , " On the Laws of Individual Tides at Southampton and at Ipswich .
" By G. B. Airy , Esq. , M.A. , F.R.S. , Astronomer Royal .
The author gives the results of his own personal observations of the tides at Southampton and at Ipswich , in both of which places they present some remarkable peculiarities .
In conducting these inquiries he obtained , through the favour of Colonel Colby , R.E. , and Lieut. Yelland , R.E. , the able assistance of non-commissioned officers and privates of the corps of Royal Sappers and Miners .
He explains in detail the nature of his observations , and the method he pursued in constructing tables of mean results ; and deduces from them the conclusion , that the peculiarities in the tides which are the object of his investigation are not dependent on any variations in the state of the atmosphere , but are probably connected with the laws which regulate the course of waves proceeding along canals .
