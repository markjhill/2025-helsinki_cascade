\amp ; Y.P.R.S. Received April 8 , 1874 .
The results of combining two or more colours of the spectrum have been studied by Helmholtz , Clerk Maxwell , Lord Rayleigh , and others ; and the combinations have been effected sometimes by causing two spectra at right angles to one another to overlap , and sometimes by bringing images of various parts of a spectrum simultaneously upon the retina .
Latterly also W. v. Bezold has successfully applied the method of binocular combination to the same problem ( Poggendorff , Jubelband , p. 585 ) .
Some effects , approximating more or less to these , may be produced by chromatic polarization .
Complementary Colours.\#151 ; First as regards complementary colours .
If we use a Nicol 's prism , N , as polarized , a plate of quartz , Q , cut perpendicularly to the axis , and a double-image prism , P , as analyzer , we shall , as is well known , obtain two images whose colours are complementary .
If we analyze these images with a prism , we shall find , when the quartz is of suitable thickness , that each spectrum contains a dark band , indicating the extinction of a certain narrow portion of its length ; these bands wall simultaneously shift their position when the Nicol N is turned round .
Now , since the colours remaining in each spectrum are complementary to those in the other , and the portion of the spectrum extinguished in each is complementary to that which remains , it follows that the portion extinguished in one spectrum is complementary to that extinguished in the other ; and in order to determine what portion of the spectrum is complementary , the portion suppressed by a band in any position we please , we have only to turn the Nicol N until the band in one spectrum occupies the position in question , and then to observe the position of the band in the other spectrum .
The combinations considered in former experiments are those of simple colours ; the present combinations are those of mixed tints , viz. of the parts of the spectrum suppressed in the bands .
But the mixture consists of a prevailing colour , corresponding to the centre of the band , together with a slight admixture of the spectral colours immediately adjacent to it on each side .
The following results , given by Helmholtz , may be approximately verified:\#151 ; Complementary Colours .
Red , Green-blue ; Orange , Cyanic blue ; Yellow , Indigo-blue .
Yellow-green , Violet .
When in one spectrum the band enters the green , in the other a band will be seen on the outer margin of the red and a second at the opposite 1874 .

355 end of the violet\#151 ; showing that to the green there does not correspond one complementary colour , but a mixture of violet and red , i. e. a reddish purple .
Combination of two Colours.\#151 ; Next as to the combination of two parts of the spectrum , or of the tints which represent those parts .
If , in addition to the apparatus described above , we use a second quartz plate , Q , and a second doable-image prism , Pl ?
we shall form four images , say 00 , O , EO , EE ; and if A , A ' be the complementary tints extinguished by the first combination QP alone , and B , B ' those extinguished by the second Q\gt ; Px alone , then it will be found that the following pairs of tints are extinguished in the various images:\#151 ; Image .
Tints extinguished .
00 B , A , O B ' , A ' , EO B\ A , EE B , A ' .
It is to be noticed that in the image O E the combination Qx P , has extinguished the tint B ' instead of B , because the vibrations in the image E were perpendicular to those in the image O formed by the combination QP .
A similar remark applies to the image EE .
The total number of tints which can be produced by this double combination Q P , Q1 Px is as follows : 4 single images , 6 overlaps of two , 4 overlaps of three , 1 overlap of four .
Total . .
15 Collateral Combinations.\#151 ; The tints extinguished in the overlap O O+EO will be B , A , B ' , A ; but since B and B ' are complementary , their suppression will not affect the resulting tint except as to intensity , and the overlap will be effectively deprived of A alone ; in other words , it will be of the same tint as the image O would be if the combination Qi Px were removed .
Similarly the overlap O +EE will be deprived effectually of A ' alone ; in other words , it will be of the same tint as E , if Qj Pt were removed .
If therefore the Nicol N be turned round , these two overlaps will behave in respect of colour exactly as did the images O and E when QP was alone used .
We may , in fact , form a Table thus :\#151 ; Image .
Colours extinguished .
OO + EO B + A+B ' + A=B + B'+A=A * O +EE B ' + A ' + B+A ' = B + B ' + A'=A ' .
And since the tints B , B ' have disappeared from each of these formulae , it follows that the second analyzer P may be turned round in any direction without altering the tints of the overlaps in question .
[ May 21 , Mr. W. Spottiswoode on In like manner we may form the Table OO+EE B + A + B + A ' = B + A+A'=B OE+EO B ' +A ' + B'+A =B ' + A +A'=B ' .
Hence if the Nicol N be turned round , these overlaps will retain their tints ; while if the analyzer Px be turned , their tints will vary , although always remaining complementary to one another .
There remains the other pair of overlaps , viz.:\#151 ; OO + OE B+A+B'+A ' EO+EE B'+A+B+A ' .
Each of these is deprived of the pair of complementaries A , A ' , B , B ' , * and therefore each , as it -would seem , ought to appear white of low illumination , i. e. grey .
This effect , however , is partially masked by the fact that the dark bands are not sharply defined like the Fraunhofer lines , but have a core of minimum or zero illumination , and are shaded off gradually on either side until at a short distance from the core the colours appear in their full intensity .
Suppose , for instance , that B ' and A ' were bright tints , the tint resulting from their suppression would be bright ; on the other hand , the complementary tints A and B would be generally dim , and the image B+A bright , and the overlap B + A + B ' + A ' would have as its predominating tint that of B+A ; and similarly in other cases .
There are two cases worth.remarking in detail , viz. , first , that in which B\#151 ; A ' , B'\#151 ; A , t. e. when the same tints are extinguished by the combination Q P and by Qx Pr This may be verified by either using two similar quartz plates Ql Qx , or by so turning the prism Pt that the combination Qx Px used alone shall give the same complementary tints as Q P when used alone .
In this case the images have for their formulas the following :\#151 ; 00 OEO EO EE A+A ' A+A ' 2A 2A ' ; in other words , O 0 and E 0 will show similar tints , and E 0 , E E complementary .
A similar result will ensue if B=A , B ' = A ' .
Again , even when neither of the foregoing conditions are fulfilled , we may still , owing to the breadth of the interference-bands , have such an effect produced that sensibly to the eye B+A=B'+A ' ; and in that case B ' + A=B + A\#151 ; A ' + A *=B + A ' + 2A-2A ' , which imply that the images 0 0 and O E may have the same tint , but that E 0 and E E need not on that account be complementary .
They will differ in tint in this , that EE , having lost the same tints as EO , will have lost also the tint A , and will have received besides the addition of two measures of the tint A ' .

Effect of Combinations of two Colours.\#151 ; A similar train of reasoning might be applied to the triple overlaps .
But the main interest of these parts of the figure consists in this , that each of the triple overlaps is complementary to the fourth single image , since the recombination of all four must reproduce white light : hence the tint of each triple overlap is the same to the eye as the mixture of the two tints suppressed in the remaining image ; and since by suitably turning the Nicol N or the prism P , , or both , we can give any required position to the two bands of extinction , we have the means of exhibiting to the eye the result of the mixture of the tints due to any two bands at pleasure .
Effect of Combinations of three Colours.\#151 ; A further step may be made in the combination of colours by using a third quartz , Q2 , and a third double-image prism , P2 , which will give rise to eight images ; and if C O ' be the complementaries extinguished by the combination Q2 P2 , the formulae for the eight images may be thus written :\#151 ; 000 0 0 E 0 E 0 OEE E 0 0 EOE EEO EEE C +B +A .

[ May 21 , The most interesting features of the figure consist in this , that the subjoined pairs are complementary to one another , viz.:\#151 ; OOO EOE C+B+A C'+B ' + A ' EOO OOE C ' + B + A C + B ' + A ' EEO OEE C + B'+A C ' + B +A ' EEE OEO C -f B + A ' C ' + B ' + A And if the prisms P , PT , P2 are so arranged that the separations due to them respectively are directed parallel to the sides of an equilateral triangle , the images will be disposed thus :\#151 ; OEO OOO EEO EOO O EE OOE EEE EOE The complementary pairs can then be read off , two horizontally and two vertically , by taking alternate pairs , one in each of the two vertical , and two in the one horizontal row ; and each image will then represent the mixture of the three tints suppressed in the complementary image .
Low-tint Colours.\#151 ; A slight modification of the arrangement above described furnishes an illustration of the conclusions stated by Helmholtz , viz. that the low-tint colours ( couleurs degradees ) , such as russet , brown , olive-green , peacock-blue , \amp ; c. , are the result of relatively low illumination .
He mentioned that he obtained these effects by diminishing the intensity of the light in the colours to be examined , and by , at the same time , maintaining a brilliantly illuminated patch in an adjoining part of the field of view .
If therefore we use the combination N , Q , P , Pf ( i. e. if we remove the second quartz plate ) , we can , by turning the prism P round , diminish to any required extent the intensity of the light in one pair of the complementary images , and at the same time increase that in the other pair .
This is equivalent to the conditions of Helmholtz 's experiments ; and the tints in question will be found to be produced .
