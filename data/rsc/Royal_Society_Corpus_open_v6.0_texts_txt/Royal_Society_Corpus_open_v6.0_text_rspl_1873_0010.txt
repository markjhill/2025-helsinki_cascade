" On certain Discrepancies in the published numerical value ofTJv " By William Shanks , Houghton-le-Spring , Durham .
Communicated by Prof. G. G. Stokes , R.S. Received October 13 , 1873 .
The author 's attention has been recently drawn , by Mr. John Morgan , of Bishopbriggs , Glasgow , to two cases of discrepancy in the author 's published value .
of x , and to the misprint of a figure in the value of tan"1 ^ ( one of the arcs employed in determining x ) , as given in the author 's paper of April 1873 .
These two discrepancies in the value of x , which will be described presently , did not appear in the paper presented by the late William Rutherford in 1853 , wherein the author 's extension to 530 decimals was correctly given .
The source of the two cases of error was easily discovered , on referring to the author 's manuscript of 1852 ; for it was there found that the 461st and 462nd decimals in the value of tan-1 \#163 ; were , in the process of careful revision previous to publication , altered from 88 to 96 ; and this alteration required the addition of 128 in the corresponding place of the value of x. This addition was rightly made in the value sent to Mr. Rutherford , and given , as above stated , in his paper .
It should seem that the author unfortunately did not take a copy ( for his own use ) of what he forwarded to Mr. Rutherford .
At all events , from some strange cause or accident ( perhaps from being overworked ) the addition of 128 was very soon afterwards made at the 513th , 514th , and 515th , instead of at the 460th , 461st , and 462nd decimal places .
Hence arose the double error , which remained , strange to say , undetected for upwards of twenty years !
This mistake , however , from its , in no wise affects the accuracy of the other figures .
It is sufficient merely to state that the 75th decimal , before alluded to , in the value of tan-1 ^ should be 8 and not 7 ; but it may be well to give the entire value of x anew:\#151 ; .

" On Double Refraction in a Viscous Fluid in motion .
" By J. Clerk Maxwell , M.A. , Professor of Experimental Physics in the University of Cambridge .
Received October 31,1873 .
According to Poisson 's * theory of the internal friction of fluids , a viscous fluid behaves as an elastic solid would do if it were periodically liquefied for an instant and solidified again , so that at each fresh start it becomes for the moment like an elastic solid free from strain .
The state of strain of certain transparent bodies may be investigated by means of their action on polarized light .
This action was observed by Brewster , and was shown by Fresnel to be an instance of double refraction .
In 1866 I made some attempts to ascertain whether the state of strain in a viscous fluid in motion could be detected by its action on polarized light .
I had a cylindrical box with a glass bottom .
Within this box a solid cylinder could be made to rotate .
The fluid to be examined was placed in the annular space between this cylinder and the sides of the box .
Polarized light was thrown up through the fluid parallel to the axis , and the inner cylinder was then made to rotate .
I was unable to obtain any result with solution of gum or sirup of sugar , though I observed an effect on polarized light when I compressed some Canada balsam which had become very thick and almost solid in a bottle .
It is easy , however , to observe the effect in Canada balsam , which is so fluid that it very rapidly assumes a level surface after being disturbed .
Put some Canada balsam in a wide-mouthed square bottle ; let light , polarized in a vertical plane , be transmitted through the fluid ; observe the light through a Nicol 's prism , and turn the prism so as to cut off the light ; insert a spatula in the Canada balsam , in a vertical plane passing through the eye .
Whenever the spatula is moved up or down in the fluid , the light reappears on both sides of the spatula ; this continues only so long as the spatula is in motion .
As soon as the motion stops , the light disappears , and that so quickly that .
I have hitherto been unable to determine the rate of relaxation of that state of strain which the light indicates .
If the motion of the spatula in its own plane , instead of being in the plane of polarization , is inclined 45 ' to it , no effect is observed , showing that the axes of strain are inclined 45 ' to the plane of shearing , as indicated by the theory .
I am not aware that this method of rendering visible the state of strain * Journal de l'ficole Polytechnique , tome xiii .
