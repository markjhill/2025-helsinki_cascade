[ Plate 4 .
] The star rj Argus , as is well known , was for a short time almost the brightest star in the heavens .
Between 1677 and 1870 its light fluctuated between magnitude 0 and 6-8 , and , since the latter date has gradually faded from 6f to 7f\#151 ; its magnitude at the present day .
Soon after the McClean telescope was mounted , and by way of testing its performance , a plate was taken , with the object-glass prism of 8^ ' refracting angle in front of the object glass , of the area of the sky surrounding rj Argus .
As this plate showed that rj Argus had a very remarkable bright-line spectrum , an attempt was made to obtain a spectrograph with the slit spectroscope , together with a compaiison spectrum .
Within the past few weeks I have been engaged in measuring some of these experimental spectrograms\#151 ; a work that other occupations had until now prevented me from undertaking .
As the reductions of the measures show that the spectrum of \gt ; } Argus closely resembles that of the Nova Aurigse , it seems to be of considerable interest , in view of the appearance of Anderson 's new star in Perseus , to publish the present results , although in many respects they are not so complete as might otherwise be desirable .
Thus I have no doubt that , by sacrificing the definition near Hy and by a longer focal setting and longer exposure , one could get a considerable extension of the spectrum in both directions with the objective prism , and , with the slit-spectroscope , obtain a good determination of the velocity of the star in the line of sight by a much shorter exposure and with direct comparison of the brightest star-line with H(3 .
These further points may , however , remain for future investigation .
The plate taken with the slit spectroscope is shown in fig. 1 ( Plate 4 ) .
It was exposed as follows :\#151 ; 1899 .

The Spectrum of rj Argus .
Eleven selected iron lines were carefully measured with the Toepfer micrometer .
A least-square solution with Hartmann 's formula gave A of which the residuals ( K ) = 2180*30 -respectively ( C ) 181854*2 n - 128*8971 were Ttesid .

-0*06 -0*10 4957*50 -0*18 In determining the wave-lengths of the lines in the spectrum of g Argus the above formula was not used , as the representation did not seem sufficiently exact nor could the whole spectrum be conveniently measured at once .
The attached table shows the subdivisions of observation and computation .
The above value of A0 was retained in the computations , but %o and C were determined separately for each block .
The means of the micrometer readings are corrected for the carefully determined errors of the screw .
It will be noted that we get for the wave-lengths of the hydrogen lines the following results:\#151 ; Observed .

The wave-lengths given in the separate column are corrected for displacement so as to bring out the wave-lengths of the hydrogen and other lines at their true values .
The wave-lengths of the corresponding bright lines in the spectrum of Nova Aurigae as observed at the Lick Observatory or Potsdam , * are given in the adjoining column , and the agreement is very remarkable .
The photograph with the object-glass prism was taken in 1899 , January 14 , with an exposure of one hour .
The star was trailed to and fro for 0*5 mm. , the guiding being done by a neighbouring star viewed in the guiding telescope .
The original negative is enlarged 5 diameters in the plate sent ( fig. 2 , Plate 4 ) .

2 K The Spectrum of rj Argus .
The wave-lengths given in the object-glass prism table were derived from careful measures which were converted into wave-lengths by Hartmann 's formula and the known wave-length of the hydrogen lines .
The wave-lengths resulting from the object-glass prism are naturally far less reliable than those from the slit spectroscope .
From the very exact agreement between the spectrum of rj Argus and that of the Nova Aurigse , it appears that whatever the causes of the origin of the Nova in Auriga , very similar causes have probably produced the historical changes in the brightness of g Argus .
