) In a paper recently communicated to the Royal Society* the hypothesis was advanced that cholesterol is a substance which is strictly conserved in the animal organism .
As it is difficult to conceive how a body of the constitution of cholesterol can be synthesised in the organism from proteids , carbohydrate or fat , it was suggested that the waste of cholesterol might be made up from the food taken by the animal .
In order to test the correctness of this view we.thought that evidence of fundamental importance might be obtained by comparing the cholesterol content of eggs and newly-hatched chicks , and also by ascertaining whether chicks could be reared and would thrive on food deprived , of its cholesterol or phytosterol .
In this paper we give an account of our estimations of cholesterol in hens ' eggs and newly-hatched chicks .
Method of Estimation.\#151 ; The weighed egg or chick ( including broken shell ) was pounded up in a mortar with sand and sufficient plaster of Paris to cause the whole to set after a time to a dry mass .
This was powdered and extracted in a Soxhlet 's apparatus with ether for about twelve days .
The ethereal solution of the extract was saponified in the cold by means of an alcoholic solution of sodium ethylate .
After standing overnight the precipitated soap was filtered off and thoroughly washed with ether .
The filtrate and washings were repeatedly shaken with water to get rid of alcohol , excess of alkali , traces of soap , etc. , dried with calcium chloride and the ether distilled off .
The residue was dried at 100 ' C. and weighed .
In the case in which single eggs or chicks were analysed , the dry residue , dissolved in 10 c.c. of pyridine , was mixed with about three times its weight of benzoyl chloride also in solution in 10 c.c. of pyridine .
After standing overnight the liquid was poured into water , and the precipitated cholesterol benzoate after drying was boiled with 10 c.c. of absolute alcohol and allowed to stand some hours .
The crystals were filtered off , washed with a little Roy .

In all cases these crystals were colourless , or nearly so , and melted approximately correctly .
The filtrate and washings were separately measured , and corrections , which had been ascertained by previous experiments , made for the solubility of cholesterol benzoate .
When cholesterol benzoate was crystallised from absolute alcohol the mother liquor at 21 ' C. contained 0T2 per cent. When , however , ready formed crystals were shaken for a short time with alcohol at 20 ' C. and filtered , the filtrate was found to contain only 0'04 per cent. When a number of eggs or chicks were analysed together , the unsaponified residue was crystallised from alcohol , and as much pure cholesterol as possible was isolated , melting at 145'\#151 ; 147 ' C. The mother liquors were then evaporated to dryness , benzoylated in a pyridine solution as described above , and the benzoate weighed .
The soaps precipitated on saponification were collected together in two lots , comprising respectively the total amount obtained from all the eggs examined , and the total amount obtained from all the chicks .
These were separately mixed with about twice their weight of salt , water added , and after evaporating to dryness were thoroughly extracted with ether .
In neither case could any appreciable quantity of cholesterol be isolated .
In Table I the analysis of eight eggs is given , and in Table II the analysis of eight chicks .
It is obvious from these figures that no increase in the quantity of cholesterol takes place during the change from ovum to newly-hatched chick , the average percentage of cholesterol in eggs being 0*3827 , and in chicks 0*3693 , or in terms of the weight of the original eggs 0*3172 .
The same result follows , no matter whether we take the figures for crude unsaponifiable matter , or those for pure cholesterol .
At first sight it would appear that a loss of cholesterol occurs , but taking into account the facts that the difference between the average percentage of cholesterol in eggs and chicks ( column \#151 ; 0*066\#151 ; is of much the same order of magnitude as the average deviation from the mean in the two cases , viz. , 0*057 for eggs and 0*075 for chicks .
That individual eggs differ considerably in the loss in weight which takes place during incubation , that there is no reason to suppose that the proportion of yolk to white in different eggs is very constant , and that the method of estimation of cholesterol does not possess a very high degree of accuracy , it would seem probable that no change in the quantity of cholesterol takes place , and that all the cholesterol of the egg is contained in the newly-hatched chick .
In order to obtain a more accurate value for the cholesterol content of eggs and chicks , six eggs and six chicks were analysed together , as the greater the quantity of cholesterol weighed in an analysis the more accurate is the 1909 .

In Tables III and IV the figures thus obtained are compared with the total values for the eight eggs and eight chicks dealt with in Tables I and II .
As in the latter case the eggs used were taken indiscriminately from various farmers , whereas the eggs analysed together were specially selected hatchable eggs obtained from the dealer , we give in another column the total values for the eggs analysed separately after eliminating the abnormally heavy and abnormally light eggs , Nos. 1 , 5 , 11 , and 15 .
The percentages of cholesterol in eggs and chicks calculated from the data obtained by analysing a number of eggs or chicks together are nearer the truth than the averages obtained from the analyses of single eggs or chicks , as in the latter case the errors of the various estimations would be K 2 132 Origin and Destiny of Cholesterol in the Animal Organism .

A comparison of the figures again shows that no gain in cholesterol takes place during the incubation of the chick .
Whether the cholesterol of the egg remains unchanged , or whether some loss occurs , cannot be definitely decided .
Conclusions .
In the differentiation of the ovum into the complex aggregates of cells constituting the chick , no formation of cholesterol takes place .
This is in accordance with our view that cholesterol is not synthesised in the organism .
This work has been carried out with the help of a grant which was made to us by the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society , for which we take this opportunity of expressing our thanks .
