Of the Penetration of a IHemisphere by an indefinite Number of equal and similar Cylinders .
By Thomas Knight , Esq. Communicated by Sir Humphry Davy , LL. D. Sec. R.S. Read March 19 , 1812 , [ Phil. Trans. 1812 , p. 310 .
] The problem which Mr. Knight here undertakes to solve , is to pierce a hemisphere perpendicularly to the plane of its base , with any number of equal and similar cylinders of such kind , that after the removal of these cylinders , the remainder of the hemisphere shall admit of exact cubature ; and when the surface has been thus perforated , the remaining surface shall admit of exact quadrature .
But the solution of this problem , as well as of those contained in the preceding communication , was , of course , suchll as not to admit of being publicly read .
