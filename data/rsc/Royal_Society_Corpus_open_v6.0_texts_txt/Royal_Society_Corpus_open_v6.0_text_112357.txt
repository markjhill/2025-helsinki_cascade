" Communicated by Dr. SHARPEY .
Received October 21 , 1868 .

SIR , -I beg to anticipate a more detailed communication by informing you that , after a number of failures , which made the attempt seem hopeless , I have this morning perfectly succeeded in obtaining and observing part of the spectrum of a solar prominence .
As a result I have established the existence of three bright lines in the following positions : I. Absolutely coincident with C. II .
Nearly coincident with F. III .
Near D. The third line ( the one near D ) is more refrangible than the more refrangible of the two darkest lines by eight or nine degrees of Kirchhoff 's scale .
I cannot speak with exactness , as this part of the spectrum requires remapping .
I have evidence that the prominence was a very fine one .
The instrument employed is the solar spectroscope , the funds for the construction of which were supplied by the Government-Grant Committee .
It is to be regretted that its construction has been so long delayed .
I have &amp;c. , J. NORMAN LOCKYER .
The Secretary of the Royal Society .
