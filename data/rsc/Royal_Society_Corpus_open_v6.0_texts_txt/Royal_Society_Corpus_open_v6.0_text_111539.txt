SIR BENJAMIN C. BRODIE , Bart. , President , in the Chair .
In accordance with notice given at the last Meeting , the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Ripon was proposed for election and immediate ballot .
The ballot having been taken , his Lordship was declared duly elected .
The following communications were read : I. Extract of a Letter from Professor LAMONT to Major-General SABINE , Treas .
and V.P.R.S. , dated Munich , Dec. 19 , 1858 .
Coummunicated by Professor W. H. MILLER , For .
Sec. R.S. " My magnetic observations in France , Spain , and Portugal are now published , and a copy for you is on the way .
The observations of last summer are under the press .
They comprehend about thirty stations in the North of Germany , Belgium , Holland , and Delnmark .
Next year I am going to Italy , and in 1860 I intend to revisit Spain , in order to observe the total eclipse of the sun , and also to make magnetic observations .
" I have found that on the Continent the lines of horizontal intensity move from south-west to north-east , making an angle of about 20 ?
with the meridian , that is , in a direction coinciding with the lines of declination .
The lines of inclination seem to move in the same direction , and the motion of the lines of declination will probably coincide with the lines of horizontal intensity .
Calling + AHl and -Ai the annual changes of horizontal intensity and inclination of a central station ( suppose London ) , the annual changes for a place situated x degrees in latitude to the north , and y degrees in longitude to the west , will beA H0-00018x + 000008y ( absolute measure , French units ) , --Ai +0'21x -0t'09y .
" The new survey of the British Islands will offer an opportunity of testing the correctness of these formulae .
