i Pepys , Esq. R. S. Read June 16th , 1808o 1T HE process of respiration , or breathing , is so intimately connected with our existence in life , that from its first moments , to the final close , sleeping and waking , this necessary action is constantly maintained : nor can it be suspended even for a few minutes without considerable pain and the utmost danger .
This important process has of course excited the curiosity both of ancient and modern philosophers ; among the latter we find the distinguished names of MAYOW , PRIESTLEY , GOODWIN , MENZIES , SPALLANZANI , SCHEELE , LAVOISIER and DAVY , whose successive labours have thrown great light upon this difficult subject , and prepared the way for farther investigation ; but it is impossible to take a review of what has already been done , without perceiving that some important points were by no means satisfactorily settled ; an accurate method of separating the different gasses , and ascertaining their exact proportion in any given mixture , was still a desideratum when many of the experiments were made , and it is only of late years that Eudiometry has attained its present perfection : the quantity of residual gas in the lungs after a forced expiration was a matter in dispute amonog former experimenters , some making It one hundred and nine cubic inches , and others only forty ; M7DCCCV11 .
K k and yet it is of the utmost consequence il all calculations upon the effets produced , especially upon small portions of gas , that the state of the lungs should be accurately determined : ; this constitutes the great difficulty in the investigations .
We therefore commenced our labours by constructing an apparatus , in which we are able to respire from three to four thousand cubic inches of gas , conceiving , that in this quantity , the error arising from the residual gas in the lungs must be so much obviated as to permit the most satisfactory results .
The apparatus consists of three gasometers , two of which are filled with mercury , and one with distilled water .
The water gasometer which belongs to the Royal Institution , is capable of holding four thousand two hundred cubic inches of gas , and each of the mercurial ones three hundred cubic inches : the apparatus was so arranged that the inspirations were all made from the water gasometer , and the expirations into the mercurial gasometers alternately .
Each of the gasometers is furnished with a graduated scale , and they are all made to range with each other , so that the quantity of gas inspired and expired could be immediately and exactly ascertained : to each of the mercurial gasometers a glass tube is fixed , and made to enter a mercurial bath , from which portions of the expired air could at any time be taken for examination .
By the kindness of our friend SILVANUS BEVAN , we are enabled to give an accurate drawing of the apparatus .

The large reservoir or water gasometer is not shown in this drawing , it having been so frequently described in chelnical works .
Manner of conducting the Experiment .
Our first care was , to be certain that all the parts of our apparatus were perfectly air-tight , and this , from the nature of it , was very easily ascertained ; we agreed that the breath .
ing should always be performed by one of us , and the registering , &amp;c. by the other , as each would by that means acquire a greater degree of dexterity in performing his part , and the results would be more uniform .
The water gasometer being filled with common air to a certain mark upon the scale , and the mercurial ones completely empty , the person to breathe , whom we shall uniformly call the operator , was seated upon a stool , with his mouth even with the tube A , , his nose being secured with a steel clip .
He made as complete an expiration as possible int:the-open aair then applying his lips to the tube , and'keeping his left hand constantly on the cock , fig. l , and his right hand onh the cock , fig. G , he opened the conmmunication with the water gasometer , and made an inspiration ; then immediately closing it , he opened with his right hand the cock at .
; and that at b being also opened , he expired into the mercurial gasometer G. i. ; then closing 2 , which cut off all communication with the mercurial gasometer , he opened i , in order to make a fresh inspiration ; then closing it , he again opened 2 , and expired into the mercurial gasometer ; and proceeding in this way , always taking care to shut one cock before the other was opened , the air was made to pass from the fater gasometer , througl the lungs of the operator into the mercurial gasometer , and this with great ease , as the diameters of the tubes were purposely made large .
The scale of the mercurial gasometer was carefully noticed , and when nearly full , the cock 4 underneath was shut off : then , by a signal from the operator , his colleague opened 3 , and the expirations were received in G. 2 .
While this was filling , the number of cubic inches in G , .
1 was registered , a portion saved ihn the mercurial bath , and the rest quickly expelled .
This operation was repeated until the contents of about twelve or thirteen mercurial gasometers were taken off ; the operator always concluding with a strong effort to empty his lungs as completely as possible .
The quantity inspired from the water gasometer was then compared with the quantities expired into the mercurial gasometers , and the difference noted .
The following are the results of the first ten experiments .

1 3580 3543 37 In this last experiment we ascertained that the expired gas contained 8 per cent. of carbonic acid .
The breathing in these cases was as nearly natural as we conceive it possible to be in any apparatus ; the operator was scarcely fatigued , and his pulse not raised more than about one beat in a minute ; the respirations however were deeper and fewer than natural , amounting only to about 58 in elevel minutes , whereas from repeated observations at different and distant times he makes 19 in a minute .
The smallness of the deficiency surprised us very much , as , from the reports of other experimenters we had been prepared to expect a much greater loss .
It might be objected that the air was rarefied by passing through the lungs ; but this was almost immediately counteracted by the mass of quicksilver in the gasometers , which amounted at least to one hundred and fifty pounds ; and we have repeatedly noticed , that air under these circumstances has suffered no perceptible diminution by standing for a considerable time ; in one case , in which air from the lungs was driven into the mercurial gasometers for twenty-seven minutes , the temperature of the quicksilver at the end of the experiment was not raised half a degree:of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer .
The deficiency , in our opinion , principally arises from the difficulty in bringing the lungs precisely to the same state after , as before the experiment ; and it must be recollected that the operator commenced by a forcible expiration into the open air , but finished by a forcible expiration into the mercurial gasometer .
Now , although this gasometer was counterpoised by weights in the scale attached to it , yet we can easily conceive that more resistance might be afforded to the complete evacuation in the latter case than in the former , and consequently the lungs might contain a few inches more after the experiment than before it , which might in some measure account for the deficiency .
In the eleventh experiment , portions of gas were taken off from each of the mercurial gasometers as they were filled , and these portions being afterwards mixed were carefully examined .

30,4 50 11 min. 3460 3437 23 To prevent repetition , we shall here state that all the trials were made in the same manner , and with the same apparatus , namely , the Eudiometer , described in the Society 's Transactions for 1807 , in which one cubic inch is divided into one hundred parts ; and that in almost every instance we made two , and sometimes three experiments on the same gas , and derived fresh confidence from the remarkable coincidence and uniformity of the results .
No precaution was at any time omitted which appeared to us necessary to insure accuracy .
One hundred parts of the expired gas being agitated with lime water in the eudiometer , the lime water became turbid , and 8.5 parts of the gas were absorbed , which were consequently carbonic acid ; the remaining 91.5 parts were treated with the green sulphate of iron , saturated with nitrous gas , as recommended by Professor DAVY , and afterwards with the simple solution of the green sulphate , when 12.5 parts were absorbed , which were consequently oxygen , and the remaining 79 azote .
loo parts of the expired gas therefore consisted of 8.5 carbonic acid .

29 ; 145 So that 292.14 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given off in eleven minutes , or 26.55 cubic inches per minute , which is almost exactly the estimate of Professor DAVY .
In this experiment the operator inspired 3460 cubic inches in eleven minutes , and felt himself in a natural state when he left off .
Then , as he makes usually under common circumstances nineteen respirations in a minute , 346o 0 .
11 x 19= 209 3460 16.5 it follows , that he takes in 6cubic inches at every easy inspiration .
As all the experiments had been hitherto made upon the lungs of one person , we concluded that the next should be performed upon our assistant .

The excess of eleven cubic inches , in this case , no doubt arose from the person not having been in the habit of exhausting his lungs , so that they contained more when he began than when he left off ; his lungs appeared to be of greater capacity than those of the usual operator .
Portions of gas were saved from each of the mercurial gasometers as they were filled , which being mixed together , for the average gave the following results : 0oo parts'o6f tliemixture contaired -8j5 carbonic acid 12.5 oxygen .

1o o : 8.5 : : ; 3311 : 21.43 .
Consequently 81,43 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given off in 5minutes .
hll this experiment we meet with a remarkable fact , viz. that as much carbonic acid gas was given off in 5 , minutes , as in the former experiment in eleven minutes ; so that it appears , whenever atmospheric air is taken into the lungs , it returns charged with about 8 per cent. carbonic acid .
The faster respiration is performed , the more carbonic acid is given off ; and conaseently the more oxygen consumed : in this instance it m:as given off at the rate of fifty-one cubic inches per minute .
Thirteenth Experiment .
We now proceeded to carry on the respiration of common air for a much longer period than usual , and of course on a much larger quantity .
The experiment was made by the same operator who had performed all the others , except the 12th .
: Eleven mercurial gasometers having been filled , taken off , and registered , the operator continued to breathe in the ith until a mark was made by his colleague upon the scale of the water gasometer , and it was again filled with common air to the usual division on the scale .
This occupied but a very short space of time .
The operator , without taking his lips from the tube , then filled twelve more of the mercurial gasometers , which were registered as before , and he continued to breathe in the 12th , until the water gasometer was again replenished ; eleven more were then filled , and portions saved from each : the experiment was completed by a forcible expiration of 166 cubic inches into the lath ; and this last portion being left for an hour and a half was not perceptibly diminished in volume , Cub. inches Barom , Therm.

29,85 68§ 24.37 " 9890 9872 1 The breathing was so nearly natural that the operator was scarcely fatigued , and thought that he could have gone on for a much longer time .
The smallness of the deficiency , notwithstanding the experiments occupied e24minutes , is a striking circumstance , and leads us to suspect still more strongly , that the deficiency principally arises from the impossibility of always bringing the lungs to the same state after forcible expiration .
0oo parts of the mixture of expired gas gave 8 carbonic acid , i oxygen , 79 azote .
lOO Calculation for Carbonic Acid .
100 8 9872 : 789,76 .
So that789,76 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given off in 24 , minutes , which gives thirty-two cubic inches per minute .
But here it must be noticed that the respiration was more rapid than in the 11th experiment , and a larger quantity of carbonic acid given off in the same time .
This agrees with the 1 2th experiment .
We are very much inclined to think that , in ordinary respiration , a great part of the air is returned unaltered , viz. that contained in the fauces , in the trachea , and probably a portion of that in the larger branches of the bronchia .
If this circumstance be not adverted to in experiments upon small quantities of air , the results can never be correct .
There is even a considerable difference in the quality of the first and last portions of a single inspiration .
In some experiments made with a view to this subject , a small quantity of the first portions , given off in a common and natural expiration , was received in a vessel over mercury ; on examination , it only contained 3.5 per cent. carbonic acid ; in other experiments the first portions contain from three to five per cent. ; while the general average appears by the ith , 12th , and i3th experiments , to be about eight .
The operator , after rather more than a natural inspiration , expired o04cubic inches into the mercurial gasometer , making his utmost effbrts to press as much as possible out of the lungs , this contained 9,5 per cent. of arbonic acid .
Here we are to recollect , that these 204 cubic inches contained the first , as well as the last portions ; the first portions have been LI 12 ?

Three hundred cubic inches of atmospheric air were admitted into the mercurial gasometer G. i. ; the other , G. " 2 , was empty .
The nose being properly secured , and the mouth applied to the tube A , as usual , air was drawn from G. , and by half turning the cock , 2 , was expired into G. 2 .
: This was repeated ' until the contents of G. 1 had been made to0 pass through the lunIgs , and transmitted to G. 2 .
The air was then inspired from G. 2 , and expired into G. l , until G. 2 was nearly empty .
This was repeated about eight or ten times during three minutes , until respiration became extremely laborious , and the operator desisted .
The whole 3oo cubic inches must have passed eight or ten times through the lungs ; and we confidently expected , that on examining the air we shoul ad haan unusual proportion of carbonic acid .
But 1oo parts gave only 9.5 carbonic acid 5.5 oxygen 85 .

100 * In this experiment there was obviously no occasion to make allowance for the air contained in the tubes and sockets .
We find its volume to be eighteen cubic inches .
Here was an increase of six parts in oo of something which the tests for oxygen : old not take up , and also a loss of six per cent. oxygen .
This seemed to convince us , that under certain circumstances , as during some peculiar alterationin the vital functions , gaseous oxide of carbon , carburetted hydrogen , or some other gas not absorbable by lime water or the tests for oxygen , might be given off from the lungs , and we accordingly determined to repeat CRUIKSHANK 's experiments with hyperoxygenised muriatic acid gas .
We procured the gas from liyperoxygenised muriate of potash by means of muriatic acid , and mixing it with a known portion of gaseous oxide of carbon in a flint stopper bottle , the mouth of which was immersed in mercury for twentyfour hours , the gaseous oxide of carbon was converted into carbonic acid gas , as was proved by its effects upon lime water , which , when both the gasses are pure , absorbs them entirely after they have remained together for twenty-four hours ; it was plain , therefore , that we had the means of detecting gaseous oxide of carbon , and doubtless carburretted hydrogen , if any should be contained in the expired gas .
From a conviction of the importance of these experiments we were determined to take nothing upon trust .
F5fteenth Experiment .
We repeated the 14th experiment with a little variation .
In this case we employed only one of the mercurial gasometers , into which exactly 300 cubic inches of atmospheric air were admitted .
The operator having made an easy expiration , applied his mouth to the cock at the top of the bell glass , and the time being noted , began to breathe ; in less than a minute he found himself obliged:to take deeper and deeper inspirations ; and at last the efforts of the lungs to take in air became so strong and sudden , that the glass was in some danger of being broken against the side of the gasometer .
A great sense of oppression and suffocation was now felt in the chest , vision became indistinct , and after the second minute his whole attention seemed to be withdrawn frolri surrounding objects and fixed upon the experiment .
He now experienced that buzz in the ears which is noticed in breathing nitrous oxide , and after the third minute had only sufficient recollection to close the cock after an expiration .
This secured the result of the experiment ; but he became so perfectly insensible that , on recovering , he was much surprised at finding his friend and the assistant on the table in the act of supporting him .
It was noticed that he made thirty-five inspirations during the experiment .
We now examined the air which had been so treated .
lo parts contained o1 carbonic acid , 4 oxygen , 86 azote , 100 In this experiment it is remarkable , that the air which had been so often through the lungs , should only have furnished lo per cent. of carbonic acid , while the air which passes them but once contains from 8 to 8.5 .
Here the oxygen had lost 7 from 21 , and the azote had gained 7 upon 79 .
We knew by previous experiment , * that every cubic inch of carbonic acid gas required exactly a cubic inch of oxygen for its formation ; the ten parts of carbonic acid may therefore be reckoned as oxygen , which would make the constitution of f 14 oxygen , the gas after the experiment 86 azote , whereas before the experiment it wasf x oxygen , X79 azote .
Now we did not suppose the residuum of 86 to be all azote , though 79 might be ; therefore seven parts appeared to have been added by this unnatural mode of respiring , and we conjectured the addition might be gaseous oxide of carbon , To ascertain this , we put 40 parts into a flint stopper bottle , and nearly filled it with about loo parts hyperoxygenised muriatic acid , procured as before , and recently prepared ; the stopper being put in , over distilled water , we plunged it in quicksilver , and filled a second bottle in the same way , as a comparative experiment .
We next procured some pure azote , by absorbing the oxygen from a portion of atmospheric air by the saturated green sulphate and simple green sulphate as usual ; 40 parts of this azote were mixed with the same proportion of the acid gas as in the other experiment , and the whole suffered to stand for forty-eight hours ; at the end of this time the azote was examined , by washing it first in distilled water , and afterwards in the eudiometer with the tests for oxygen ; and there were still exactly 4o parts left ; proving that the hyperoxygenised muriatic acid gas has no action upon azote .
*We then examined the bottles containing the residuum from the air that had been so often respired , and found that it had not experienced the slightest change ; it was therefore plainly 263^ azote ; and on reflection , it occurred to us , that if a certain proportion of oxygen had been absorbed or lost in any way , while the azote remained unaltered , there must be an increased proportion of the latter .
Now we knew exactly both the bulk and the constitution of the air before the experiment ; but it was impossible to know the bulk or volume after the experiment otherwise than by calculation .
The 300 cubic inches of atmospheric air before the experiment contained 21 oxygen , 79 azote in oo parts , making the total quantity of oxygen 63 cubic inches , azote 237 30o Now if the lungs be capable of fixing permanently any azote from the atmosphere , it appears by our experiments that the quantity must be very minute , seeing that in the itth , 12th , and 13th experiment , it did not disturb the roportion of azote , as shown by the eudiometer ; we shall therefore in the present instance assume the volume of azote after the experiment at 237 cubic inches , as before .
But after the experiment , every loo parts consisteed ci 86 parts azote , and 14 oxygen , either in the form of carbonic acid , or free .
86 : : : 237 : 38.58 Therefore the total quantity of oxygen left after the experiment would have been 38.58 cubic inches .
Then 237 azote + 38.58 oxygen 275.58 ; the quantity of gas after respiration would therefore have been 275.58 cubic inches .
oo 275.58 = the loss of oxygen , or 24.42 cubic inches .
It iappears , theforel 9 that -,4 , ubiinches of xygenahd been absorbed by , the.system under the circumstances of thi experiment .
Reviewing the 14th experiment , it appears that the gas after rxespiration contained 85 per cent , azote , and 15 per cent. oxygen , either in the state of carbonic acid , or free , State of the Air before the Experiment .
Soo = 237 azote +63 oxygen .
After the Experiment .
85 : 15 : : 237 : 41.82 .
The total quantity of oxygen after the experiment appears to be 41.82 cubic inches .
Then 237 azote + 41.82 oxygen = 278.82 .
The total volume after the experiment appears to be 278.82 cubic inches .
30oo --278.82 21.18 .
The loss of oxygen in this case was 2 1,18 cubic inches .
We are disposed to consider the 1 lth as a standard experiment relative to carbonic acid gas , because the quantity of air respired in a given time is pretty near the average of the first ten experiments ; and because it very nearly agrees with the statement of Professor DAVY .
In this experiment 29 , cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were given off in eleven minutes ; the barometer was 30.4 , the thermometer 50 ?
, the volume being calculated at the mean , viz. barometer 30 , thermometer 6o ?
, will be 302 cubic inches given off in eleven minutes , or 39534 cubic inches in twenty-four hours , supposing the production to be uniform during all that period and as loo cubic inches of carbonic acid gas weigh 47.26 grains , 10oo : 47.6 : : 39534 : 18683.76 ; the weight of the carbonic acid gas amounts to 18683.76 grains ; and estimating the carbon in it at 28 parts in 1oo , according to LAVOISIER , or 28.60 , as calculated in the experiments on diamond , recorded in the Society 's Transactions .
10 oo 28.60 : : 18683.76 : 5363.55 grains ; it will follow that 5363.55 grs. or above 1i oz. troy of solid carbon , are emitted by the lungs in the course of twenty-four hours ; and that 39534 cubic inches of oxygen gas are consumed in the same time .
But when we consider that in respiration perfectly natural , a much smaller quantity of air can come in contact with those parts of the lungs calculated to act upon it , the proportion of carbonic acid gas given off in natural respiration , ought probably to stand considerably lower than in the above estimate ; but at all events it will be very considerable .
Sixteenth Experiment .
Having made so many experiments upon atmospheric air , we now proceeded to ascertain the effects produced upon oxygen gas by the process of respiration .
The water gasometer was filled with oxygen gas made from the hyperoxygenised muriate of potash by heat , care having been taken to clear all the tubes , &amp;c. as much as possible of common air , by forcing a quantity of oxygen gas through them .
One hundred parts from the water gasometer being treated with the usual tests in the Eudiometer , a residuum of only 2.5 was left ; so that 97.5 per cent. were pure oxygen , and the rest azoteo The register of the water apparatus being noticed , and the operator having prepared himself as usual by a forced expiration , began to respire ; his pulse was 72 ; and at the end of 9 minutes and twenty seconds , the experiment was concluded by a forced expiration , when the pulse was raised to 88 .

100o : 11 : i93 : 351.28 , consequently , 351.23 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were formed in 9'.2o " , or 37.64 cubic inches in a minute .
Here its plain that a greater quantity of carbonic acid was formed from oxygen than frtm common air , in the same time , and hence we infer , that one use of azote is to regulate the quantity of oxygen , which shall be taken .

The total quantity of azote in the gas inspired , was therefore 81.50 cubic inches .
The quantity of gas expired was 3193 cubic inches , and of this every 1oo parts contained six of azote .
0oo : 6 : : 3193 : 191.58 .
The total quantity of azote in the gas expired , was therefore 191.58 cubic inches , but the total quantity of azote before respiration was only 84i.5o , 191.5881 .
50 =1i1o.o8 ; therefore 1lo.o8 cubic inches were added by the process .
of respiration , beside what little remained in the lungs after the experiment .
Calculation for Oxygen .
The 3260 cubic inches of gas inspired contained 81,.:o azote .
3260 81.50 = 3178.50 , and consequently the pure oxygen was 3178,50 cubic inches .
The 3193 cubic inches of gas expired , contained 83 per cent. of free oxygen , and 11 per cent. in carbonic acid gas , making ; together 94 .
100 : 94 : 3193 : 3001.42 .

177 , o8 .
It appears , at first sight , that 177.o8 cubic inches of oxygenl were missing , but great part of this may be accounted for , by adverting to the state of the lungs after the experiment .
The addition of 11o.o8 cubic inches of azote , we consider asa arising from that portion still retained in the lungs , notwithstanding the forced expiration at the beginning of the experiment , and considering that in the 14th and i5th experiment , where the same air was repeatedly breathed , the proportion of azote was in the one case 85 , and in the other 86 per cent. It seems fair to presume , that the residual air contained in the lungs after a forced expiration may amount in ioo parts , to not more than 16 oxygen and 84 azote : any one who reflects upon the structure of the lungs , and the minute ramifications of the extremities of the bronchial vessels ; and when he also considers that those parts of the lungs with which the air comes in contact , if spread out , would present a surface equal to that of the superficies of the whole body ; and lastly , that this viscus is so exceedingly spongy and porous , that when once inflated , it is ever afterimpossible by ordinary mechanical means to expel the air completely , he will easily perceive , not only that a large portion of air must remain for a considerable time in contact with : the internal surface of the lungs , where it is liable to lose a portion of its oxygen , but also that the residual quantity of air in the lungs , after the most violent attempts at expiration , may be .
very considerable .
It is to this circumstance that we .
attribute the excess of azote in .
the experiments upon oxygen , and pretty deep inspirations of this gas having been made during 9q'2o " , the iazote must have been in great measure displaced .
Admitting then that the air contained in the lungs , before the experiment , consisted of 16 oxygen , 84 azote , and at the conclusion of the experiment of 94 oxygen , 6 azote , then we have Ls4 azote at the begiinng , 100 110= 84X 6 or , 84x.o6x =.78x I oc1 10I x= -78 or 141 cubic inches ; ,78 Therefore upon this calulation it appears that 141 cubic inches of gas remained in the lungs after a forcible attempt at expiration ; then the state of the lungs before the experiment must have been 1 18.44 azote , e2.56 oxygenm 141 .
And after the experiment , 132.54 oxygen , 8.46 azote .

67.10 The deficiency noticed in the experiment was 67 , supposing that the lungs were brought to the same state after as before the experiment ; but granting that this was not the case , and that at the close of the experiment the state of the lungs was 141 + 67 = 208 , still our approximation will come within four or five cubic inches , for the azote contained in the sixtyseven missing would be only about four cubic inches .
We are aware that the temperature of the lungs being 97 , while that of the gas was 53 ?
, the 141 cubic inches would occupy a space equal to 154 cubic inches ; but this residual quantity must be greater or less according to the exertion made , and also , probably according to the state of the muscular fibre at the time. .
Seventeenth Experiment .
The water gasometer was filled to the usual mark upon the scale , with oxygen gas , prepared from about g oz. troy , of hyperoxygenised muriate of potash , as in the former experiment ; the gas being examined was found to contain as before , 2.5 azote , and 97.5 oxygen , in oo parts .
The apparatus being found air tight , and all the tubes , &amp;c. ccleared of atmospheric air by passing oxygen through them , the operator prepared himself for the experiment ; but it must lbe noticed that he had been rather fatigued during five hours previous to respiring , and had not taken any refreshment ; the weather was very warm ; his pulse 86 ; heat under the tongue 98A ; he felt no uncomfortable sensation during the process , but experienced a gentle glow and universal perspiration , breathing all the time with great ease , his pulse after the experiment was lo2 , and the heat under the tongue 990 .

We then examined a mixture of No. 2 and 3 .
100 parts contained 10.5 carbonic acid , o10 azote , 79.5 oxygen , o00 here the quantity of azote was diminishing , and the ratio of carbonic acid increasing , so that it appears necessary for the lungs to be cleared of azote , before the increased proportion of carbonic acid can take place .

100 Here the proportion of azote was only 3 per cent. more than what existed previously in the gas , and hence we may conclude , that even seven minutes and a half was not a sufficient time to remove the azote from the extremities of the bronchia .

191.36 263.10 The azote expired , beside what might be contained in the lungs , at the close of the experiment , was therefore 263.10t cubic inches .
Here it is plain , that the operator , at the beginning of this experiment , had not brought his lungs to the same state as in the preceding ; or that in consequence of fatigue , and want of refreshment for several hours , the proportion of azote in the lungs might be greater .
Every 1oo parts of oxygen , before it was inspired , contained.5 azote .

From 263.10 Deduct 8d.50 the original azote , 177.60 will be left for the increase of azote .
Then supposing as before , that the quality of the air in the lungs , before the experiment was 84 per cent. azote , 16 oxygen , and after the experiment 5.5 per cent. azote , 94.5 oxygen , as found in the last gasometer , we take 84azote at the beginning , 100 5.5x azote at the end ; Nn __4 _1 77.6o _ 84X 100 1776 100:77.6o 10 o or.84 x.-055 x =.785x , 177.6o x =.778-0 or 226 cubic inches..785 Hence it appears , that previous to the experiment , the lungs contained in this instance 226 cubic inches , and if we suppose them to be in the same state after , as before the experiment , the quality of the gas in each case will be as follows : Contents of the Lungs before the Experiment .

The observed deficiency in this experiment was 58 .
The deficiency in this case , and in the former experiment with oxygen , though comparatively small , when contrasted with the quantity of gas respired , is larger than the average with atmospheric air ; it seems probable , therefore , that a portion may be detained in the system .
It must be remembered that what we call residual gas , is not only that contained in the substance of the Iings , and in its appendages , but also that contained in the fauces and mouth .

In this recital of experiments , which have occupied a considerable portion of time , and attention , we have endeavoured to give a plain statement of facts , from which every one may draw conclusions for himself ; we shall here , however , take the liberty of briefly recapitulating the principal of those facts , and submitting what seems to us the most obvious inferences .
1 .
It appears that the quantity of carbonic acid gas emitted is exactly equal , bulk for bulk , to the oxygen consumed , and therefore there is no reason to conjecture that any water is formed by a union of oxygen and hydrogen in the ltngs .
2 .
Atmospheric air once entering the lungs , returns charged with from 8 to 8.5 per cent. carbonic acid gas , and -when the contacts are repeated almost as frequently as possible , only o1 per cent , is emitted .
The 12th and 3th experiments prove , that when the inspirations and expirations are more rapid than usual , a larger quantity of carbonic acid is emitted in a given time , but the proportion is nearly the same , or about 8 per cent. The proportions of carbonic acid gas , in the first and last portions of a deep inspiration , differ as widely as from 3.5 to 9.5 per cent. 3 .
Considering the 11th as a standard experiment , it appears that a middle sized man , aged about thirty-eight years , and whose pulse is seventy on an average , gives oiF 3o,0 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas from his lungs in eleven minutes , and supposing the production uniform for twenty-four hours , the total quantity in that period would be 39534 cubic inches weighing 18683 grains ; the carbon , in which is 5363 grains , or rather more than 1 oz. troy , the oxygen consumed in the same time will be equal in volume to the carbonic acid gas , but it is evident , that the quantity of carbonic acid gas , emitted in a given time , must depend very much upon the circumstances under which respiration is performed ; and here it may be proper to notice that all the experiments were made between breakfast and dinner .
4 .
When respiration is attended with distressing circumstances , as in the 14th and 15th experiments , there is reason to conclude that a portion of oxygen is absorbed ; and in the last of these experiments , we may remark , that as the oxygen decreases in quantity , perception gradually ceases , and we may suppose that life would be completely extinguished on the total abstraction of oxygen .
5 .
A larger proportion of carbonic acid gas is formed by the human subject from oxygen , than from atmospheric air .
6 .
An easy , natural inspiration , is from 16 to 17 cubic inches in the subject of these experiments , who makes about 19 in a minute ; this , however , will vary in different individuals , and perhaps we ought to estimate the quantity of carbonic acid gas , given off in perfectly natural respiration , at somewhat less , and most likely at considerably less , than in the statement above , when we consider that in short inspirations the quantity of air which has reached no farther than the fauces , trachea , &amp;c. bears a much larger proportion to the whole mass respired , than when the inspirations are deep .
7 .
No hydrogen , nor any other gas , appears to be evolved during the process of respiration .
8 .
The general average of the deficiency in the total amount of common air inspired , appears to be very small , amounting only to about 6 parts in 1 oo , and we are inclined to attribute it in great measure to the difficulty in exhausting the lungs as completely after an experiment as before it ; the first expiration being made into the open air , the last into the apparatus .
9 .
The experiments upon oxygen gas prove that the quantity of air remaining in the lungs and its appendages is very considerable , and that , without a reference to this circumstance , all experiments upon small quantities of gas are liable to inaccuracy .
Other important conclusions might perhaps be drawn from the facts related in this paper , but having already trespassed largely upon the time of the Society , we shall abstain from any farther remarks , until we bring forward a new series of experiments .
