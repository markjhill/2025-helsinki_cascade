On the Barometrical Variation as afected by the Moon 's Declination .
By LUKE HOWARD , Esq. , F.R.S. Received January 16 , -Read June 19 , 1845 .
THESE calculations were begun with the year 1815 , and continued to 1832 : the present paper continues them to 1841 .
The method used to bring out the averages may be thus described .
Beginning as nearly as may be at the winter solstice , the days of a solar year are classed in what may be termed weeks of declination , mostly of seven days each , the middle day of each week corresponding , -1 , with the moon 's position coming north from the equator ; 2 , with her position in full north declination ; 3 , with her position returning to south over the equator ; 4 , with her full south declination .
The average , or mean height of the barometer , in each of these classes , is presumed to express the relative power , or effect , of the position to which it belongs ; when divested of the much larger amount of variation due to the effect of a northerly or southerly current , of the variable pressure of the aqueous atmosphere , of the temperature of the season , the deposition of rain , &amp;c. Mixed with these , the weekly averages offer a mass of results sufficiently discordant ; but the discrepancy vanishes when those under each class are avercaged upon the solar year ; the other movements now balancing and neutralising each other .
The present series of averages extends then from December 20 , 1832 , where the former ends , to December 23 , 1841 .
It corresponds nearly with the latter or cold half of the cycle of anrnual temperatures , which I have already laid before the public .
And it being probable that a close connexion exists between the pressure and the temperature of the atmosphere of these latitudes , in its variations , my taking these limits may facilitate to students a carefll comparison of the two , throughout a cycle .
In my paper of March 1841 , the mean height of the barometer for each of the four positions came out , by averages upon eighteen years ending with 1832 , as follows , viz. Moon coming north over equator .
29'8724 in .
Moon in north declination ... 29'8608 in .
Moon going over equator , south ... 29'8450 in .
Moon in south declination ... . .
29'8261 in .
Hence it was inferred that the barometrical mean is depressed in these latitudes by the moon 's position in south declination : and that which appeared upon the aggregate of years , was found to hold also in the several nine-years ' averages of which it consisted .
The depression was stated to be gradual , proceeding through the three changes to the south place ; but upon the planet 's quitting her south position to return north , a sudden elevation of the mean , effected in a single week of declination , indicated the return of the pressure ( as far as regarded this influence ) to its former limit .
The results of the present examination differ somewhat in the proportions of pressure shown ; the chief cause being , as I apprehend , the different latitude in which a part of the observations took place .
In 1828 , near the middle of the year , having given up my house on Tottenham-green , I removed the barometer-clock to the Villa , Ackworth , Yorkshire , in latitude 53ยง 391 north , and still on the east side of the island .
Here I obtained for some time the yearly circle of the variation : but coming subsequently to spend the winter in the south , from my absence joined with other causes , the clock for several months in the year stood still .
I had presented a good barometer to the Friends ' Institution at Ackworth , where a good meteorological register is kept at my instance ; and from this the maxima and minima , wanting in the series by the clock , have been taken .
Thus circumstanced , and the instrument standing , from the above date , on considerably higher ground , and 2 ?
more to the north , the averages from 1824 to 1832 come out as follows , viz. moon coming north 29*8505 in .
; in north declination 29'8257 in , ; going south 29'8076 in .
; in south declination 29'8058 in .
Here we have still the depression to the place of south declination ; but with a check , amounting almost to the doing of it away , in the concluding position .
Let us , however , see further .
On the solar years , from 1833 to 1841 , observed wholly at Ackworth , the averages are , Moon coming north ... .
29'7127 in .
Moon in north declination. .
29i6946 in .
Moon going south ... ... 29'6969 in .
Moon in south declination. .
29'7115 in .
The former variation , presenting a gradualdecline of gravity to the moon 's south place , is here replaced by one altogether differenlt ; the loss of gravity by the north declination continues into the following week , and is restored ( very nearly ) in the fourth week ; the moon yet full south .
Had this discrepancy resulted from less perfect observation merely , it ought to have affected each position alike , and to have made the calculations useless ; but we have here even more of symmetry than before .
There must be something then in the more northern latitude , affecting partially the mixed average 1824 to 1832 , and more completely the northen average 1833 to 1841 ; which is commended , with all deference , to the study and consideration of our mathematical and astronomical Fellows .
442 In my former paper , I exhibited likewise a set of averages upon the whole solar year , from 1815 to 1832 , in which the yearly mean pressure increases to the middle of a cycle of eighteen years , and then decreases with great regularity to its former amount .
I have inserted here a similar calculation , but with an opposite result ; which shows the pressure decreasing from year to year , and then recovering in some measure its former level : but this , for reasons already given , comes out less regular and symmetrical than the other .
I have no doubt that , when we shall have prosecuted further the comparison of the yearly mean pressures with the temperatures , there will be found a contrast between the two halves of a cycle as evident as that I have shown to exist in those of the cycle of temperature .
In the long average , 1815 to 1841 , we have , -- , a half cycle cold ; 2 , a half cycle warm ; 3 , a half cycle cold ; the result of which must needs show a preponderance of the effect of cold .
But let the temperatures balance , as in the cycle 1815-32 , we have then-1 , coming north 29-8310 in .
; 2 , north 29-8260 in .
; 3 , going south 29-8171 in .
; 4 , south 29'8056 in .
Again , in the balanced cycle 1824-41 , we have for the four respectively , -l , coming north 29-7816 in .
; 2 , north 29*7601 in .
; 3 , going south 29-7522 in .
; 4 , south 29'7586 in .
The results of this last average are subject in some degree to the effect of a more northerly site .
Without presuming to determine even that latitude has such an effect in a space of less than three degrees , I have thought it right to place these data in the hands of the Fellows , that future students may have the opportunity ( now that we have begun to distinguish between the various causes affecting the gravity of the atmosphere ) of comparing ( with much trouble saved ) the actual differences which obtain in it , under different positions of the planet ; and of analysing , with the help of the register whence they are derived , a great mass of observations tending to throw light on the nascent science of meteorology .
I have to acknowledge , in concluding this paper , my obligations to my young friend CORNELIUS HANBURY , who made for me the preliminary calculations upon the register with much care , and , I am satisfied , with the required accuracy .
