) By the cultivation of bacteria in the presence of certain substances , for the most part toxic in character , it is possible to obtain strains in which the fermentative powers differ considerably from those of the parent organisms .
As an example may be taken a variety of B. coli communis ( Escherich ) which was produced by the growth of that organism on agar containing sodium chloroacetate ( see Penfold , 1911 ) .
This strain differed from the parent strain in that it now decomposed glucose with the production of acid but not of gas .
This result pointed to two possibilities ; firstly the decomposition of glucose by the selected strain might be brought about by a set of ferments , which acted very differently from those of the normal strain responsible for the decomposition of the same substance , or secondly the primary cleavage products of glucose might be the same both from the original and the selected strain , and the difference between the action of the two might depend upon some secondary process , as for example the decomposition of formic acid , through which , as Pakes and Jollyman ( 1901 ) and Harden ( 1901 ) have shown , the carbon dioxide and hydrogen most probably arise .
It is obviously of great biological importance to know wThether the changes brought about by growth on sodium chloroacetate result in any profound modification in the carbohydrate metabolism of the organism .
It was , at the outset , considered most probable that those enzymes which were responsible for the cleavage of the glucose molecule into its primary products would be less likely to be lost than those which brought about the secondary changes .
It was hoped , therefore , that by a comparison of the products formed from glucose and mannitol by the normal organism with those produced from the same substances by the artificially modified strains it would be possible to determinejhow many different enzymes were concerned in the process .
If a number of products are formed by one enzyme the ratio which they bear to one another should not be altered by the process of selection , or conversely if on selection the ratio between any two substances is found to alter it may be taken as evidence that these two substances are not produced Decomposition of Glucose and Mannitol by B. coli communis .
473 by one enzyme , unless these two substances can replace one another to a certain extent owing to secondary reactions .
Isolation of the Organism .
B. coli communis ( Escherich ) was chosen for this work since the first observations made by Penfold ( 1911 ) on the disappearance of the gas-producing power by growth in the presence of sodium chloroacetate were made with this organism .
It was found , however , that very many strains of B. coli communis could be isolated , showing not only differences in degree ( which need not be considered here ) , but also of kind .
The organisms were isolated from human faeces in the ordinary way .
A broth culture was made and from this bile salt cane-sugar neutral red agar plates were inoculated ; after incubation for one or two days at 37 ' , a number of white colonies ( cane-sugar non-fermenters ) were removed to tubes containing lactose peptone water coloured with litmus , and provided with Durham gas tubes .
Those tubes which on incubation produced acid and gas ( lactose fermenters ) were used to inoculate a series of tubes containing dulcitol peptone water .
By these three operations organisms were obtained which according to MacConkey ( 1905 ) belonged to the B. coli communis ( Escherich ) group .
The general characteristics of the four varieties which were found will be seen by reference to Table I. Table I.\#151 ; Characters of Strains of B. coli communis occurring together in Normal Eseces .

All the above strains were Gram negative , did not liquefy gelatin and did not give the Yoges and Proskauer reaction .
Very many examinations were made of the motility in from 3 to 10 hours ' cultures .
The most striking difference is t^iat between the rapidly motile No. 1 and the practically non-motile No. 2 .
These were chosen , therefore , for further study , since it seemed possible that the motile organism might differ considerably in its metabolism from that which was slightly motile .

Decomposition of The consideration of this relationship is , however , not one of the objects of the present communication .
It is important to note that the difference in motility between strain No. 1 and No. 2 is not merely one of degree but rather one of kind .
It is , as a matter of fact , rather difficult to decide whether No. 2 is really motile at all , and only after concentrating the attention on one bacillus and observing its position from time to time in relation to an adjacent organism is it possible to decide that it really does exhibit a motion of translation .
The strain was examined very many times in cultures from 3 to 12 hours ' growth and at later periods , but no increase in the motility of this strain was ever observed .
With* the strain No. 1 the appearance is entirely different ; in cultures of any age from 3 to 24 hours , rapid motility is readily observed .
In cultures less than 9 or 10 hours ' old the bacilli may be seen travelling with such rapidity that it is almost impossible to follow the course of any one particular bacillus .
In young cultures ( 3 to 7 hours ) the bacilli may be readily seen in long threads , in which the bacilli have not had time to separate .
No such threads were obtained with strain No. 2 .
The highly motile typical B. coli communis ( Escherich ) will be referred to as No. Cl , and the feebly motile strain as No. CF .
Artificial Selection of Non-gas-producing Strains by Growth of B. coli communir ( Escherich ) on Agar containing Sodium Ghloroacetate .
The technique of the chloroacetate method of selection has been described by Penfold ( 1911 ) and has been closely followed here .
It has been found , however , that there is very considerable variation in the power of resistance to sodium chloroacetate , and also in the appearance of the chloroacetate agar plates inoculated with various strains of B. coli ( Escherich ) .
The nature of the changes brought about by growth in the presence of sodium chloroacetate will be discussed in a separate communication , and it must suffice to say here that the changes do not merely consist in the simple disappearance of the power to produce gas from glucose , but are , rather , of such a nature as to affect , to a greater or less extent , most of the enzymatic functions of the cell .
Some of the selected organisms are grown anaerobically only with great difficulty , and hence their chemical products cannot be readily investigated .
Other strains show the property of spontaneously agglutinating and cannot , therefore , be very well shown to be derived from the original organism .
In this work , only those selected strains which , by means of the agglutination test , could be demonstrated as related to the original organisms , have been employed for the examination of the decomposition products from glucose Glucose and Mannitol by B. coli communis .
475 and mannitol .
Two varieties of selected organisms have been used\#151 ; the one ( Cl selected ) produced from the typical B. coli ( Escherich ) No. Cl , like the organism of Harden and Penfold ( 1912 ) , produced acid and no gas from glucose , while it still produced gas from mannitol , and also retained the power of decomposing formates in the presence of glucose ( see Grey , 1914 ) .
The other ( CF selected ) , obtained from the organism CF , now gave acid but no gas , either from glucose or from mannitol , and was also unable to decompose formates even in the presence of glucose .
This second selected organism might perhaps be regarded as representing a further stage of selection than the first , but I have not found it possible so far to obtain from Cl a strain comparable to CF ( selected ) .
The Relationship between the Normal and the Artificially Selected Strains as established by the Agglutination Reaction .
The artificially selected strains ( when made into an emulsion by the addition of normal saline to an agar growth ) were found in many cases to agglutinate spontaneously .
The freshly selected strain was therefore first plated out on plain agar and agar slopes made from several individual colonies .
By this means it was found possible to obtain strains which did and strains which did not agglutinate spontaneously .
The latter were then treated with rabbit serum containing the specific agglutinins for the normal strains Cl and CF , and it was found that the serum obtained by inoculating a rabbit with normal Cl agglutinated normal Cl and the artificially selected Table II.\#151 ; Demonstration of the Belation between the Normal and Artificial Selected Strains ( obtained by the Chloroacetate Method ) by means of the Agglutination Test .

Analytical Technique .
' The methods of analysis described by Harden ( 1901 ) have been for the most part closely followed ; certain slight modifications , however , have been introduced , which may be described here .
Volatile Acids.\#151 ; In the steam distillate which is used for the determination of formic and acetic acid , the formic acid has been determined by the formation of mercurous chloride , and the acetic acid obtained by subtracting the amount of formic acid so found from the total acids determined previously by titration of the whole distillate with alkali , using phenolphthalein as indicator .
Two errors are introduced here due to the presence of small amounts of carbonic acid and lactic acid in the distillate .
The carbonic acid has , therefore , been estimated by barium hydroxide and the lactic acid by Ryffel 's method .
This estimation of lactic acid in the distillate becomes of importance when the amount of acetic acid is small .
The distillation to obtain the volatile acids was carried out in two stages .
The first fraction was obtained without admitting steam , measured about 400 c.c. , and contained the alcohol and part of the volatile acid .
This fraction was titrated with standard baryta solution .
A slight excess of baryta was then added , and the solution distilled with a fractionating column in order to remove the alcohol .
The residual fluid now contained a granular precipitate of barium carbonate , which was removed by rapid filtration and titrated at the boiling point with N/ 10 H2SO4 .
The barium hydroxide corresponding to the barium carbonate was deducted from that required to neutralise the first distillate .
In this way an accurate correction may be made for the carbon dioxide dissolved in the distillate .
After removal of the first 400 c.c. steam was admitted , and the distillation continued until 100 c.c. of the distillate required only OT-O'2 c.c. of normal alkali for neutralisation .
The total steam distillate usually measured about 2500 c.c. The distillate was neutralised with potash , united with the first fraction , and the whole evaporated to dryness .
The residue was dissolved in 100 c.c. of water , and an aliquot portion used for the determination of * The agglutinating sera were kindly prepared for me by Dr. J. A. Arkwright of this Institute , to whom my best thanks are due .
Glucose and Mannitol by B. coli communis .
formic acid , another portion being used for lactic acid by Ryffel 's method ( 1909 ) .
The extent of the correction for carbonic acid and lactic acid in the distillate of volatile acids may be seen from the figures quoted in the table on p. 478 .
Collection of the Gas .
The carbon dioxide and hydrogen evolved were in some experiments collected in the apparatus of Harden , Thompson , and Young ( 1910 ) ; in other cases a simplified form of this apparatus was employed , which is here figured .
The object of this modified form of apparatus is to dispense with all taps and to reduce the number of glass joints .
The present form of apparatus has but one glass junction , and has also the advantage that when evacuated it can be sealed by allowing mercury to rise in the inner capillary tube through which the air has been pumped out of the flask .
The arrangement for maintaining the pressure in the fermentation flask constant ( by adjusting the level of the surface of the mercury in the reservoir automatically ) is also of a simpler type .
The flask A is evacuated by means of the capillary tube , which passes up through the tube B in which mercury rises as the air is removed .
The tube from the fermentation flask in the incubator is attached to I ) by a rubber junction .
The gas in the fermentation flask is evolved under atmospheric pressure , this equalisation of the pressure in the flask with that of the atmosphere being effected by means of the S-shaped syphon ( s ) , which is filled with mercury and automatically adjusts the level of the surface of the mercury in the mercury reservoir .
By plunging the rubber tube c beneath mercury and opening the clip K mercury may be allowed to rise in the capillary tube , and thus the flask A becomes completely sealed from the atmosphere .
The neck of the flask A may be plunged beneath wax .

Decomposition of Discussion of Results .
The most significant fact in connection with these results is that whereas in their action on glucose , the artificially selected strains of B. coli communis have been considerably modified , in their action on mannitol the only important change is the non-decomposition in the one case , and only partial decomposition in the other case , of formic acid into carbon dioxide and hydrogen .
The results with mannitol present greater uniformity than those with glucose , and may be conveniently considered first .
It will be seen that the ratio ( alcohol + acetic acid)/ 2 : formic acid* is practically constant and almost equal to unity .
Thus 2-55 2 x 1-37 = 0-93 ; 2-6 2 x 1-23 = 1-05 ; 2-85 2 x 1-64 = 0-87 ; 2-53 2 x 1-27 = 1-00 .
This relationship also holds good for the earlier analyses of Harden ( 1901 ) , and points to two conclusions\#151 ; ( 1 ) Alcohol and acetic acid are probably derived from an intermediate substance common to them both , and they may therefore , to a certain extent , replace one another .
( 2 ) This intermediate substance from which alcohol and acetic acid are produced is itself formed in constant ratio to formic acid .
Lactic acid might be regarded as being formed directly from mannitol by the action of a special enzyme , but this could only occur if ( ) hydrogen were evolved in excess of carbon dioxide , or ( alcohol and formic acid were produced by the same enzyme which produced lactic acid , as , for example , in accordance with the equation C6Hi40\#171 ; = C3H603+C2H5OH + HCOOH .
But if such a change as is represented by this equation were effected in one ' step by a single enzyme then , since the proportion of lactic acid actually produced is only one-third of that demanded by this equation ( see Table IV ) , it would follow that there must be another origin for alcohol and formic acid .
The following hypothetical schemes are put forward to represent the decomposition of mannitol and glucose :\#151 ; Mannitol , C6H1406 .

Intermediate substance B. Alcohol , C2H60 .
Acetic acid , C2H402 .
The intermediate substance A is unknown , but is postulated to account for the formation of lactic acid in such a way that the enzyme which produces lactic acid from glucose may also produce lactic acid from mannitol .
The substance is probably related to pyruvic aldehyde .
The intermediate substance B from which it is suggested that alcohol and acetic acid are derived is probably acetaldehyde .
This view is supported by the evidence that acetaldehyde may be detected among the products of decomposition of glucose by B. coli communis ( Grey , 1913 ) .
Two molecules of acetaldehyde might undergo the Cannizzaro reaction ( Parnas , 1910 ) with the production of alcohol and acetic acid , thus If this were the main change in the case of glucose , it would account for the production of alcohol and acetic acid in approximately equimolecular proportions .
Again , acetaldehyde might be reduced to alcohol as postulated by Kostytscheff ( 1912 ) for alcoholic fermentation by yeast or directly oxidised .
In the case of mannitol this reduction might be of great importance .
It is represented by the dotted lines in the scheme .
And since , in this case the whole , or nearly the whole , of the hydrogen formed , along with the intermediate substance A , would be available for this purpose , the result would be the production of alcohol in large excess over that of acetic acid , which is actually observed .
While , however , the decomposition of mannitol and glucose may thus be represented as occurring along the same general lines , it is clear that some essential difference must exist between the mechanisms of the two reactions , or they would not be so differently affected by the process of selection on chloroacetate agar .
The simplest supposition is that this difference affects the production of formic acid and intermediate substance B , for artificially selected organisms produce these substances from glucose in greatly diminished amount , whereas from mannitol their production is not seriously altered .
While the exact nature of the difference in the two mechanisms must still 2CH3CHO + H20 = CH3COOH + CH3CH2OH .
482 Mr. E. C. Grey .
Decomposition of be a matter of conjecture , it may with some probability be supposed that it is connected with the presence in the products from mannitol of hydrogen available for reduction .
It must be remembered that the two hydrogen atoms possessed by mannitol in excess of those present in glucose are only .capable of reducing half the possible amount of B which could be produced from one molecule of mannitol .
Hence , even if half the mannitol were converted into lactic acid , these extra hydrogen atoms could be completely taken up by B. As a matter of fact not more than one-quarter of the mannitol appears as lactic acid , so that a considerable part of B is reduced to alcohol and the remainder probably undergoes the same change as in glucose , forming equimolecular proportions of alcohol and acetic acid .
It must be noted that from the above considerations one would expect that the production of acetic acid from mannitol by the selected organism would be somewhat less than by the normal .
In my figures , however , this is not demonstrated to be the case , but it must be remembered that the amount of acetic acid produced by the selected organism does not exceed that produced from glucose .
In the absence of more experimental results , however , it would be premature to discuss other possible origins of acetic acid .
In the scheme for the decomposition of mannitol the production of the .excess of alcohol , as compared to the case of glucose , is represented as occurring through the agency of this extra hydrogen .
In the case of glucose , on the other hand , alcohol can only be produced if there be simultaneously the formation of some oxidation product , or in other words the hydrogen would have to be supplied by a reductase .
It should be remembered that the aldehydomutase of Cannizzaro which brings about the conversion in this case of two molecules of acetaldehyde into acetic acid and ethyl alcohol is in reality also a reductase , the acceptor for the oxygen being the same as the substance reduced .
The essential difference between the two changes would then reside in the necessity for the co-operation of a reductase in the decomposition of glucose which would not be required to the same extent for that of mannitol .
In all other respects after the preliminary decomposition of the original molecule the two actions would then require exactly the same enzymes .
Considered dynamically , the reaction by which the intermediate substance A changes into formic acid and substance B occurs more rapidly with mannitol than with glucose , so that in the final products less lactic acid is formed in the case of mannitol than in the case of glucose .
This acceleration of the reaction in the case of mannitol by which intermediate substance A yields ultimately formic acid and alcohol as chief Glucose and Mannitol by B. coli communis .
483 products , may be due to the reduction of substance B to alcohol whereby it is removed from the sphere of the decomposition of A. If , then , the reductase were to be diminished as the result of selection on chloroacetate agar , the removal of B from the sphere of decomposition of A would be slower .
The decomposition of A into more of B and formic acid would therefore be specifically hindered , and as a result the production of lactic acid relatively increased .
This is what is actually observed .
On the other hand the decomposition of mannitol would be unaffected , as is also found to be the case .
The view that the artificially selected strain produced by growth on chloroacetate agar is deficient in some reducing mechanism is further supported by the fact that many of these strains show diminished power of growing anaerobically .
Moreover it might be expected that this method of selection would lead to the survival of a strain deficient in reductase , for a strain with a highly developed reducing mechanism would probably convert monochloracetic acid to acetic acid with the liberation of hydrochloric acid , which would certainly not be of advantage to the organism .
Such a process might therefore lead to the survival of the strain in which the reducing , mechanism was poorly developed .
Summary and Condusions .
Two artificially selected strains of B. communis obtained by growth of normal B. coli communis ( Escherich ) on agar containing sodium chloroacetate have been examined quantitatively as regards their action on glucose and mannitol .
In both cases the selected strains produced from glucose , , lactic acid in relatively greater , and alcohol , acetic and formic acid in relatively less , proportion than did the original strains from which they were derived , whereas from mannitol there was no diminution in the production of alcohol , acetic , and formic acid .
Erom these results it is inferred that the artificially selected strains have not lost the enzymes which bring about the final reaction in the production of alcohol and acetic acid , but that the process of artificial selection has led to an absence or diminution of the reducing mechanism of the cell so that some intermediate substance , from which formic acid and the precursor of alcohol and acetic acid are derived , cannot be readily decomposed .
In conclusion I wish to express my thanks to Prof. Harden , F.R.S. , in whose laboratory this work has been done .

On the Genetics of Tetraploid Plants in Primula sinensis .
