( Abstract .
) The subject of this paper is an entire lower jaw of the large extinct marsupial which the author from previous fragmentary fossils concluded to be part of a carnivorous beast of the size of a lion , the probable prey of which had been the larger herbivorous marsupials , also now extinct .
Every additional character in the subject of the present paper confirms the fitness of the genus named Thylacoleo .
