The research was carried out in the Physiological Institute at Leipzig .
The immediate object was to determine the function of nerves which are to be seen on the surface of the ventricles of the hearts of mammals .
It was important to know their functions on the following grounds : \#151 ; mm ATLANTIC FAEROE CHAN* WYV1LLE THOMSON RIDGE from Soundings obtained , in H.M.S. TRITON , Au.g .

] On the Innervation of the Mammalian Heart .
In the frog , stimulation of the sinus produces stillstand of the heart .
The inhibitory fibres have at any rate here a provisional ending .
On the other hand the result of stimulation of the ventricle may be .egarded as a form of acceleration .
In the dog , the vagus and accelerans nerves act on different nechanisms ( Baxt ) .
Having regard to these facts the possibility of the ventricle nerves oeing accelerator presented itself .
To know the function of these nerves was not only interesting , oer se , but also as forming an appropriate introduction to the nearer nvestigation of the nervous mechanism of the mammalian heart .
The following observations on the accelerans will be first recorded :\#151 ; Hitherto in the dog , the experiments on the accelerans nerve have been carried out almost exclusively with that of the right side .
It was more convenient in the present case to work with the left nerve ( Ansa Yieusseni ) .
The author has observed that in many cases stimulation of the left accelerans is without any influence on the rhythm of the heart ; and that this was not due to accident , such as lowering of the temperature , was shown by the control stimulation of the right accelerans .
This fact is- not without importance for the remainder of the research , as will be seen .
Minimal electrical stimulation of the* vagus overcomes completely the action of the accelerans , but the accelerans overcomes the normal slight tonic action of the vagus ( Baxt). .
In an experiment of the author there existed , sowing to stimulation of the medulla , a most powerful tonic vagus action .
Thus\#151 ; Average of pulse beats before division of vagi ... .
8 " " after " " ... 18 Yet stimulation of the accelerans overcame this and produced marked quickening .
If during the stimulation of the accelerans a vei'y small cardiac branch of vagus ( in the thorax ) were stimulated , it exerted its inhibitory influence , , and overcame the accelerans , though it did not depress the pulse to the same degree that the tonic vagus action did .
With our present knowledge , this experiment points to a difference between the stimulation of a nerve from its centre , and the electrical stimulation of its trunk .
The ventricular nerves are very numerous , but require in the dog the use of special methods , in order to be seen well ; the author recommends strong carbolic acid for this purpose .
These nerves form at any rate the greater part of the nervous connexion between the auricle and ventricle .
They cannot be adequately stimulated after they have passed on to the ventricle , since the stimulus affects the heart itself too .
This is moi'e particularly the case for electrical stimulation .
As q Z 228 On the Innervation of the Mammalian Heart .
[ May l(j is well known , very slight stimulation with a Faradaic currei destroys the activity of the ventricle by bringing about a peculiar coi dition of fibrillar contractions .
The author 's procedure was as follows : The ventricular nerves pas on to the ventricle at definite points of the auricular ventricuU boundary , where they are collected into larger trunks .
He hs observed that division of these trunks has no influence on the rhythi of the heart , nor does it in any way impair the action of the vagus c aecelerans nerve .
These ventricular nerves are therefore not essenth to any of these processes .
The ventricular nerves are the continuation of certain definit cardiac nerves , which can be isolated in the thorax at a distance froi the heart .
When these cardiac nerves are stimulated , some of tb ventricular nerves must be stimulated too .
In particular , the majorit of the nerves on the posterior surface of the heart , are derived from trunk which arises either from the left vagus ganglion , or from som| part of the Ansa Vieusseni .
This nerve usually runs quite isolate : ] to the heart .
The result of stimulation of the peripheral end of th.il nerve are as follows : \#151 ; Out of 14 experiments , it exerted in 4 a vagus action , without an ?
acceleration ; in 2 an acceleratory action without any inhibitory ; it 8 it had no influence on the rhythm .
The nerve sometimes gives of obvious branches to the auricle ; in some of the cases where n influence on the rhythm was produced , these had been cut awaj Particular attention was given to this nerve , because it is easy t isolate , and because it eertainly contains fibres which go on to thi ventricle .
The author also stimulated the other cardiac branches , which an in obvious connexion with the ventricular nerves .
Sometimes the* produced inhibition , sometimes acceleration , but also in this case th : division of the trunks which continue these nerves on to the ventriclf did not produce any change in the result of their stimulation .
Th : author from the above observations concludes that the ventricula nerves have no direct influence on the rhythm of the heart .
Stimulation of the central end of those cardiac nerves , which art continued on to the ventricle , is followed by marked reflex phenomena and this fact , in conjunction with the negative result just recorded leads the author to regard the ventricular nerves as being chieflj sensory , or more exactly , centripetal .
The reflex phenomena are , rise and fall of blood pressure , slowifif and quickening of the pulse .
On placing a small piece of blottiB| paper soaked in acetic acid on to the surface of the ventricle in th* rabbit , a rise of blood pressure was observed ; the acetic acid wa moderately strong ; a second application to the same part had iw effect .
On tearing through the nerve trunks from which the v0H\gt ; j\lt ; 883 .

The fact that sensory nerves go to the heart was hown long ago by Ludwig and Cyon 's discovery of the depressor ierve in the rabbit .
In the dog a large nerve ( or two smaller ) runs from the left vagus mnglion and sometimes from the trunk , and ends chiefly between the .oats of the aorta , giving occasionally a branch to the Artena Pulmonalis .
The peripheral stimulation of this nerve is without fleet .
The central stimulation produces slowing ot the heart and all of blood pressure ; sometimes the slowing is followed by acceleia-\gt ; ion .
The nerve is very sensitive to mechanical stimulation .
The extent and importance of the centripetal nerves which come from the heart and great vessels , is clearly shown in the author 's experiments .
Whether the ventricular nerves are solely centripetal or not has not been fully determined .
It is rendered probable by the author 's experiments , that both vagus and accelerans act on mechanisms in the auricles .
In some cases the author has observed changes of blood pressure follow stimulation of the peripheral ends of nerves going direct to the heart , either without any change in the beat , or without a corresponding change .
But his observations on this point are too few to draw definite conclusions .
The mercurial manometer was used .
The dogs were narcotized with opium , and then the brain divided through the pons , the object being to render the subsequent steps of opening the thorax painless , and still to preserve reflex actions .

In a communication to the Royal Society ( published in the " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 32 , 1881 ) on the " Functional Relations of the Motor Roots of the Brachial and Lumbo-Sacral Plexuses , " my colleague , Professor Gerald Yeo , and myself gave an account of the results of electrical stimulation of the several motor roots of the brachial and crural plexuses in the monkey .
We there described the muscular actions of the upper extremity as resulting from stimulation of the first dorsal up to the fourth cervical nerve .
