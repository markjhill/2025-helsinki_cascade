The time of an alternation is , however , quite insufficient to produce any such effect on the water-pipe earth , and , in consequence , the net result is a passage of negative electricity to earth through the cables , and of the corresponding positive quantity to earth by the water-pipes .
The maximum effect that has been observed so far amounts to an apparent E.M.F. slightly exceeding 10 volts , with the eleven circuits connected to one machine , but it appears that a greater effect would be produced by still further increasing the length of mains in connection .

" The Effect of Mechanical Stress and of Magnetisation on the Physical Properties of Alloys of Iron and Nickel and of Manganese Steel .
" By Herbert Tomlinson , B.A. , F.R.S. Received May 7 , 1894 .
( Abstract .
) The author has examined the principal physical properties of three alloys of nickel with iron and of the non-magnetic manganese steel of Mr. Hadfield , together with the effects of mechanical stress and magnetisation on these properties .
The three nickel-iron alloys contain 22 , 25 , and 30 per cent , of nickel , and are designated Specimens D , E , and E respectively ; they are in the form of thin wires , and similar specimens have been previously tested by Dr. John Hopkinson for the effect of change of temperature on their magnetic properties.* Specimen F practically loses its magnetic susceptibility at a temperature below 100 ' C. , but regains it again on cooling to the temperature of the room .
Specimens D and E are magnetic in the hard-drawn condition , but become non-magnetic when heated above 600 ' C. They do not , however , like Specimen F , regain their magnetic susceptibility when cooled to the ordinary temperature of the room , but can be made to do so , either by the process of wire-drawing , or by cooling them a few degrees below 0 ' C. Tables I and ll contain the values of the principal physical constants of the three nickel-iron alloys , of Hadfield 's non-magnetic manganese steel , and of nickel and iron .
The former of these two tables relates to the substances in the hard-drawn condition in which they were received by the author , and the latter to the same substances after annealing , so that by a comparison of the two tables , the effects of the permanent strain resulting from wire-drawing may be seen .
These effects are in some instances of the same nature for the nickel-iron alloys as for nickel and iron .
Thus the density of all the specimens is diminished by * ' Roy .

The , Effect of Mechanical [ May 31 , wire-drawing , the simple rigidity is also diminished , and the internal molecular friction , as inferred from the logarithmic decrement of arc of torsionally oscillating wires , is considerably increased .
On the contrary , whilst the specific resistance of iron , nickel , and manganese steel is increased by wire-drawing , that of the iron-nickel alloys is largely diminished .
Again , whilst wire-drawing largely decreases the magnetic permeability of iron , nickel , and iron alloyed with 30 per cent , of nickel , it makes the alloys containing 22 and 25 per cent , of nickel to considerably appreciate in permeability , and , in fact , in a great measure transforms them from the almost non-magnetic to the magnetic condition .
Dr. John Hopkinson has shown that a similar result can be obtained by cooling the alloys several degrees below 0 ' C. The magnetic properties of manganese steel cannot , however , be restored by the process of wire-drawing .
As regards the physical properties themselves , apart from the effects of stress or strain on these properties , all the nickel-iron alloys here examined have considerably less longitudinal and torsional elasticity than the pure metals nickel and iron ; they also have considerably less internal friction .
This last is very conspicuously the case with the alloys containing 25 per cent , nickel , which in the annealed non-magnetic condition has an internal molecular friction less than one-fourth of that of iron or nickel .
For magnetising forces extending from 08 to 2 C.G.S. units , the alloy containing 30 per cent , of nickel is possessed of much greater magnetic permeability than iron , but for large forces the iron is superior .
The other two nickel-iron alloys are , when in the annealed condition , almost as non-magnetic as Hadfield 's manganese steel .
The temporary effects of longitudinal mechanical traction and magnetic stress on some of the physical properties are exhibited in Table III .
It will be noticed that longitudinal traction produces on both the specific resistance and the thermo-electric height of the alloys of nickel with iron , an effect which is intermediate to that produced on the pure metals nickel and iron .
The magnetising forces employed ranged for the most part between 40 and 80 C.G.S. units , and the results obtained refer only to the elastic effects of the force , which effects are approximately proportional to the force itself .
These elastic effects are much greater in proportion to the change of magnetic induction than are the residual effects .
The change of both specific resistance and thermo-electric height produced by a C.G.S. unit of magnetic stress , is in all cases enormously greater than that produced by a C.G.S. unit of mechanical stress .
The effects of mechanical stress on the magnetic permeability of all the different iron-nickel alloys are fully exhibited in this paper .
Speaking roughly , they lie between the corresponding effects for the pure metals iron and nickel .
