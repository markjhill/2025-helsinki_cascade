) ( Abstract .
) The recent work of Elster and Geitel , Ebert and others , has added three new factors to the data for the study of atmospheric electricity , namely :\#151 ; The rate at which the permanent charge on the surface of the earth is being dissipated into the atmosphere , the state of ionization of the air , and the amount of radio-active emanation in the lower regions of the atmosphere .
These three factors have been carefully studied in the temperate zone .
With the idea of extending our knowledge of them into the Arctic regions , I was granted permission by the Commissioners of the 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to undertake a year 's work in the Lapp village of Karasjok ( 69 ' 17 ' N. ; 25 ' 35 ' E. ; 129 metres above sea level , and about 200 miles south of the North Cape ) , The work undertaken consisted of the following:\#151 ; 1 .
By means of a Benndorf self-registering electrometer to obtain daily curves of the potential gradient , and from these to calculate the yearly and daily variation .
2 .
To make systematic observations of the dissipation by means of Elster and Geitel 's instrument .
3 .
To make corresponding measurements of the ionization with Ebert 's apparatus .
4 .
To measure the amount of radio-active emanation in the atmosphere .
5 .
To investigate , as far as possible , the influence of the aurora on the electrical conditions of the atmosphere .
The chief results obtained are , shortly , as shown in Table I ( p. 161 ) .
In the table the following units are used:\#151 ; The Potential Gradient is expressed in volts/ metres as observed over a level plain .
The Dissipation is expressed as the percentage of charge lost by a charged body in one minute when freely exposed to the air .
The dissipation of a positive charge is represented by a+ , and that of a negative by a_ , the ratio a_/ a+ being written q. The Ionization is given in terms of the number of electro-static units of free ions , of one sign , in a cubic metre of air .
The symbol I+ is used to On Atmospheric Electricity in High Latitudes .
161 represent the positive ionization , I_ the negative ionization , and r the ratio I+/ I-* It will be seen that the yearly course of the potential gradient in Karasjok is in accordance with the general rule for the Northern Hemisphere : rising rapidly from October to February , when it reaches a maximum , then falling Table I.\#151 ; Yearly Variations .

The course of the dissipation is exactly opposite to that of the potential gradient , the curve representing the two being almost mirror images of one another .
The yearly course of the ionization consists of a nearly linear six months'fall , from the beginning of September to the end of February , followed by a similar six months ' rise , from March to the end of August .
Daily Variations .
The daily course of the potential gradient for the whole year consists of a single period having a minimum about 5 A.M. , and a maximum about 9 p.m. Observations of the dissipation and ionization were made three times a day : morning from 8 to 9 A.M. ; midday from 12 to 1 ; evening from 6 to 7 p.m. Irom the observations , the following facts as to the daily variation can be found .
Dissipation.\#151 ; During the winter and spring the morning observations Mr. G. C. Simpson .
[ Feb. 17 , show a slightly higher dissipation than the midday , while , on the contrary , during the summer and autumn , the midday values are the higher .
For the whole year the dissipation is slightly higher at midday than earlier in the morning , while the evening observations show the lowest dissipation of the three .
The value of the ratio r for nine months shows a daily period , being lower at midday than at either the morning or evening observations .

There is practically no difference between the midday and morning ionization .
The daily period of the ratio q is a steady rise from the morning to the evening ; in this respect the ionization does not correspond with the dissipation .
Interrelation of the Ionization , Dissipation , and Potential Gradient .
Both the dissipation and ionization greatly influence the potential gradient .
Low values of ionization and dissipation are accompanied by high values of the potential gradient , and vice versd .
As the potential gradient rises both the ratios q and r become greater .
For any given wind strength , the observations show that the dissipation , as measured by Elster and Geitel 's instrument , is a linear function of the ionization .
Relation between the Meteorological and Condition of the Atmosphere .
Wind.\#151 ; As is to be expected , the dissipation increases greatly with the wind strength .
The ratio q shows a steady decrease as the wind strength increases .
Temperature.\#151 ; Both the ionization and dissipation become much less as 1905 .
] On A tmospheric Electricity High Latitudes .
the temperature goes down .
With temperatures between 10 ' and 15 ' C. , the dissipation is 4-95 per cent , and the ionization 044 ; while with temperature below \#151 ; 20 ' C. , these become 0-83 per cent , and 047 respectively .
As is to be expected from the relation already described between potential gradient , dissipation , and ionization , the potential gradient increases as the temperature falls .
Relative Humidity.\#151 ; With rising relative humidity , the dissipation falls rapidly , and the ratio of negative to positive dissipation ( ) increases .
When the whole year is taken into account , the same result is found for the ionization ; but for the winter and summer six months , taken separately , the effect of the humidity of the air on the ionization is not apparent .
The Aurora and the Electrical Conditions of the Atmosphere .
No relation whatever could be detected between the aurora and the electrical conditions of the atmosphere .
The most careful watching of the electrometer needle revealed no variation of the potential gradient with variations of the aurora .
Radio-A ctivity .
Measurements of the radio-activity were made by Elster and Geitel 's method , * and their arbitrary unit used in expressing the results .
Observations were made at four different times of the day\#151 ; viz. , from 3 to 5 A.M. , from 10 to 12 A.M. , from 3 to 5 P.M. , and from 8.30 to 10.30 p.m. During the year 420 observations were made in Karasjok and 78 in Hammerfest .
A most distinct yearly course of the radio-activity was found , the maximum falling in mid-winter and the minimum in mid-summer .

164 On Atmospheric Electricity in High Latitudes .
There is a distinct connection between the radio-activity and the meteorological condition of the atmosphere .
The radio-activity increases as the temperature falls , rises as the relative humidity rises , decreases with increasing wind strength , and is greater with a falling than a rising barometer .
All these facts support Elster and Geitel 's theory that the source of the radio-active emanation in the atmosphere is the soil of the ground .
Those meteorological conditions which prevent the air immediately above the ground from ascending tend to increase the radioactivity ; on the contrary , all those conditions which cause a rapid circulation of the air greatly reduce the radio-activity when measured in the lower atmosphere .
As stated above , measurements of the radio-activity were also made in Hammerfest .
The observations extended over four weeks .
The mean values were found to be considerably lower than at Karasjok .
The most important result of the Hammerfest measurements was the great difference in the radioactivity of the air from the sea and that from the land , as shown in the following table:\#151 ; Table Y.\#151 ; Eadio-activity and Wind Direction in Hammerfest .
