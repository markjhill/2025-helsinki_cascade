We have lately shown* the dextrorotatory character of the nucleo-proteids of the pancreas , thymus , and suprarenal gland .
We have , in the course of our investigations , shown that the " nucleins " possess a stronger rotation than the " nucleoproteids " properly so called , and from which they are derived , and in the researches which we have planned , and which naturally are suggested by our previous work , the first step .appeared to us to be to determine the optical activity of the nucleic acids corresponding to the nucleoproteids investigated by us .
In the present paper we shall confine our attention to the optical activity of thymus-nucleic acid , prepared by the method of Kossel and Neumann . !
We adhered closely to the method recommended by these chemists , which furnishes with great ease a colourless product , yielding \#166 ; colourless and perfectly transparent solutions admirably adapted for polarimetric observations .
From G kilogrammes of trimmed thymus Kossel and Neumann obtained 120 grammes of pure nucleic acid .
From 600 grammes of the gland we obtained 9-5 grammes , though no special pains were taken to work even in an approximately quantitative manner .
Our purified product , like that of Kossel and Neumann , was free from proteid and barium .

An amount of nucleic acid weighing l'l09 grammes was suspended in water and dissolved by the cautious addition of dilute solution of ammonia in small quantities , so that when solution had been effected the reaction of the solution towards litmus was neutral , The volume of the solution was made up to 100 c.c. and it was then examined polari metrically .

10 c.c. of the solution used in the last experiment were further diluted with 10 c.c. of distilled water and the resulting solution was examined .
W = 1T09 grammes ; V = 400 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a = +0 ' 52 ' .

The above observations indicate that solutions of the nucleic acid of the thymus are powerfully dextro-rotatory , but that the specific rotation of neutral solutions does not vary appreciably with dilution , the variations in the results of the three sets of observations recorded above falling within the probable limits of error .
Similar results had already been obtained with solutions of the nucleoproteid of the pancreas , although the limits of dilution in that case were not so great as in the present instance .
On the Influence of the Reaction of the Solution on the Optical Activity of the Nucleic Acid of the Thymus Gland .
The observations about to be referred to indicate a very remarkable influence exerted by the reaction of the solution on the optical activity of the nucleic acid under discussion .
The rotation is notably influenced by the acidity of the solution ; it reaches a maximum at a certain degree of acidity and then decreases .
On the other hand , the addition of ammonia in sufficient proportion will render a solution of thymus-nucleic acid optically inactive , though neutralisation of the acid will restore its pristine activity .
It is to be noted , however , that there is no abrupt change around the neutral point , a statement which is illustrated by the fact that two solutions of equal concentration may be prepared which are undistinguishable in so far as their optical rotation is concerned , one of which is faintly , though distinctly , acid to litmus , while the other is alkaline .

25 c.c. of the original neutral solution of nucleic acid employed in the first set of experiments were made decidedly acid by the addition of a trace of 20 per cent , acetic acid .
The change of volume was so small as to be negligible .
The solution was then subjected to polari- .
metric examination with the following results:\#151 ; W = T109 grammes ; V = 100 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a = + 3 ' 30 ' .

25 c.c. of the original solution were correspondingly made distinctly alkaline with ammonia and polarimetrically examined :\#151 ; W * 1*109 grammes ; Y = 100 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a = + 3 ' 31 ' .

The two above sets of experiments show that determinations of the optical activity of thymus-nucleic acid may be made in a neutral or quasi-neutral fluid , without fear of variation caused by inaccuracy in observing the point of exact neutrality .
The following experiments , however , demonstrate that the rotation is markedly changed by the addition to a neutral solution of thy mo-nucleic acid either of a considerable amount of acetic acid or of ammonia .

20 c.c. of the original solution were treated with one-tenth of a c.c. of 20 per cent , acetic acid and the solution was polarimetrically examined : W = 1*109 grammes ; V = 100*5 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a = +3 ' 33 ' .
[ a]D = +160'*4 .
7 .
10 c.c. of the solution used in 6 were treated with 0*3 c.c. of 20 per cent , acetic acid and polarimetrically examined : W = 1*109 grammes ; V = 101*5 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a = + 3 ' 36 ' .
[ aD ] = +164'*7 .
Up to this point we observe an increase in the specific rotation of the nucleic acid .
If , however , as in the two following experiments , the amount of acetic acid is increased , the optical rotation undergoes diminution .

10 c.c. of the original solution were treated with 1 c.c. of 20 per cent , acetic acid and then polarimetrically examined : W = 1*109 grammes ; Y = 110 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a = +2 ' 29 ' .
[ a]D = +123 ' .
The remarkable influence of solution of ammonia is illustrated by the following observations :\#151 ; 9 .
20 c.c. of the solution which had been used in observation 5 were treated with 0*5 c.c. of 10 per cent , solution of ammonia and polarimetrically examined : W = 1*109 grammes ; Y = 102*5 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a= + 2 ' 40 ' .

The solution used in experiment 9 was treated with an equal volume of 10 per cent , ammonia and the resulting solution examined : W = 1*109 grammes ; V = 205 c.c. ; L = 200 mm. ; a = +0 ' 35 ' .

The solution used in experiment 10 was further diluted with an equal volume of 10 per cent , ammonia , when the solution was found to he optically inactive .
Our observations have shown us , as has been mentioned at an earlier part of this paper , that the diminution or abolition of optical activity which is induced by alkalies in solutions of thymo-nucleic acid are not permanent , the addition of acid restoring the primitive optical condition .
Biilow has shown* that the optical rotation of proteids varies with changes in the reaction of their solutions , and Frammf studied especially the alteration brought about in the specific rotation of gelatine by the addition of acids or alkalies .
The alterations observed by Framm , however , were probably due to fundamental chemical changes brought about by the acid or alkali on the proteid .
This reasoning cannot , however , be applied to the case of the nucleic acid of the thymus gland , seeing that the addition of acid to an alkaline solution restores the optical activity .
At the suggestion of one of us ( A. G. ) , Dr. Thomas B. OsborneJ has determined the optical activity of the nucleic acid which he separated from the wheat embryo , and to which he applied the name of tritico-nucleic acid .
Dr. OsborneS has found that this nucleic acid is dextrorotatory , though the degree of rotation is considerably influenced by the concentration of the solution .
A solution containing 4 per cent , of tritico-nucleic acid possessed a specific rotation \#163 ; a]i)= + 73 ' .
