A Memorandum , addressed to the Royal Society , November 28th , 1840 , by Martin Barry , M.D. , F.R.S. , L. &amp; Ed. , was read .
Dr. Barry , in reference to the memorandum of Mr. Wharton Jones , claiming for himself the contemporaneous discovery of the germinal spot in the mammiferous ovum , states that , after having bestowed considerable pains to ascertain who was the original observer of a structure which has proved to be of great importance , he had men ?
tioned incidentally in his paper the result of his inquiry , namely , that the merit of the discovery was due to Professor Rudolph Wagner ; but observes that the inquiry may be resumed by all who will take the trouble to examine the works , both in German and English , on this subject ; and that he will ever be open to conviction , and ready to declare his change of opinion , on the production of sufficient evidence .
