Preliminary Note .
" By Captain Sir A. Noble , K.C.B. , F.R.S. , M.I.C.E. , \amp ; c. Received June 13 , 1894 .
The researches on which I , in conjunction with Sir P. Abel , have been engaged for very many years , have had their scope so altered and extended by the rapid advances which have been made in the science of explosives , that we have been unable to lay before the Society the results of the many hundreds of experiments under varied conditions which I have carried out .
We are desirous also of clearing up some difficulties which have presented themselves with certain modern explosives when dealing with high densities and pressures , but the necessary investigations have occupied so much time that I am induced to lay a few of our results before the Society , trusting , however , that before long we may be able to submit a more complete memoir .
A portion of our researches includes investigations into the transformation and ballistic properties of powders varying greatly in composition , but of which potassium nitrate is the chief constituent .
In this preliminary note I propose to refer to powders of this description chiefly for purposes of comparison , and shall devote my attention principally to gun-cotton and to those modern explosives of which gun-cotton forms a principal ingredient .
In determining the transformation experienced during explosion , the same arrangements for firing the explosive and collecting the gases were followed as are described in our earlier researches , * and the gases themselves were , after being sealed , analysed either under the personal superintendence of Sir E. Abel , or of Professor Dewar , * ' Phil. Trans. , ' toI .

[ June 2 ] , and to Professor Dewar 's advice and assistance I am indebted I can hardly say to what extent .
The heat developed by explosion , and the quantity of permanent gases generated were also determined as described in our researches but the amount of water formed plays so important a part in the transformation that special means were adopted in order to obtain this product with exactness .
The arrangement employed was as follows :\#151 ; After explosion the gases formed were allowed to escape through two U-tubes filled with pumice stone and concentrated sulphuric acid ; when the gases had all escaped the explosion cylinder was opened , and the water deposited at the bottom of the cylinder was collected in a sponge , placed in a closed glass vessel and weighed .
The cylinder was then nearly closed and heated , and a measured quantity of air was , by means of an aspirator , drawn slowly through the U-tubes till the cylinder was perfectly dry .
This was easily !
ascertained by observing when moisture was no longer deposited on a cooled glass tube through which the air passed .
The U-tubes were then carefully weighed , the amount of moisture absorbed determined , and added to the quantity of water directly !
collected .
The aqueous vapour in the air employed for drying was , i for each experiment , determined and deducted from the gross amount .
Numerous experiments were made to ascertain the relation of the tension of the various explosives employed , to the gravimetric density of the charge when fired in a close vessel , but I do not propose here to pursue this part of our enquiry , both because the subject is too large to be treated of in a preliminary note and because approximate values have already been published* for several of the explosives with which we have experimented .
With certain explosives , the possibility or probability of detona- 1 tion was very carefully investigated .
In some cases the explosive i was merely placed in the explosion vessel in close proximity to a charge of mercuric fulminate by which it was fired , but I found that | the most satisfactory method of experiment was to place the charge : to be experimented with in a small shell packed as tightlyas possible , ' the shell then being placed in a large explosion vessel and fired by 5 means of mercuric fulminate .
The tension in the small shell at the 1 moment of fracture and the tension in the large explosion vessel were in each experiment , carefully measured .
It may be desirable here to explain that I do not consider the presence of a high pressure with any explosive as necessarily denoting detonation .
With both cordite and gun-cotton I have developed enormous pressures , close upon 100 tons per square inch ( about * Noble , * Internal Ballistics , ' 1892 , p. 33 ; ' Soc. Proc. , ' rol .

207 15 000 atmospheres ) , but the former explosive I have not succeeded in detonating , while gun-cotton can be detonated with the utmost ease .
It is obvious that if we suppose a small charge fired in a vessel impervious to heat , the rapidity or slowness of combustion will make no difference in the developed pressure , and that pressure will be the highest of which the explosive is capable , regard being of course had to the density of the charge .
I say a small charge , because , if a large charge were in question and explosion took place \#166 ; with extreme rapidity , the nascent gases may give rise to such whirlwinds of pressure , if I may use the term , that any means we may have of registering the tension will show pressures very much higher than would be registered were the gases , at the same temperature , in a state of quiescence .
I have had innumerable proofs of this action , but it is evident that in a very small charge the nascent gases will have much less energy than in the case of a large charge occupying a considerable space .
The great increase in the magnitude of the charges fired from modern guns has rendered the question of erosion one of great importance .
Few , who have not had actual experience , have any idea how rapidly with very large charges the surface of the bore is removed .
Great attention has therefore been paid to this point , both in regard to the erosive power of different explosives and in regard to the capacity of different materials ( chiefly different natures of steel ) to resist the erosive action .
% The method I adopted for this purpose consisted in allowing large charges to escape through a small vent .
The amount of the metal removed by the passage of the products of explosion , which amount was determined by calibration , was taken as a measure of the erosive power of the explosive .
Experiments have also been made to determine the rate at which the products of explosion part with their heat to the surrounding envelope , the products of explosion being altogether confined .
I shall only briefly allude to these experiments , as , although highly interesting , they have not been carried far enough to entitle me to speak with confidence as to final conclusions .
, Turning now to ballistic results .
The energies which the new explosives are capable of developing , and the high pressures at which the resulting gases are discharged from the muzzle of the gun , render length of bore of increased importance .
With the object of ascertaining with more precision the advantages to be gained by length , the firm to which I belong has experimented with a 6-inch gun of 100 calibres in length .
In the particular experiments to which I refer , the velocity and energy generated has not only been measured at the muzzle , but the velocity and the pressure producing this velocity have been obtained for every point of the bore , consequently 208 Capt. Sir A. Noble .
[ June 21 , the loss of velocity and energy due to any particular shortening of the bore can be at once deduced .
s These results have been obtained by measuring the velocities every round at sixteen points in the bore and at the muzzle .
These data enable a velocity curve to be laid down , while from this curve the corresponding pressure curve can be calculated .
The maximum chamber pressure obtained by these means is corroborated by simultaneous observations taken with crusher gauges , and the internal ballistics of various explosives have thus been completely de-termined .
Commencing with gun-cotton , with which a very large number of analyses , were made , with the view of determining whether there was any material difference in the decomposition dependent upon the pressure under which it was exploded , two descriptions were employed : one in the form of hank or strand , and the other in the form of compressed pellets .
Both natures were approximately of the same composition , of Waltham Abbey manufacture , containing in a dried sample about 4-4 per cent , of soluble cotton and 95'6 per cent , of insoluble .
As used , it contained about 2'25 per cent , of moisture .
The following were the results of the analyses of the permanent gases .
They are placed in five series , viz.:\#151 ; First .
Analyses showing the decomposition of the strand or hank gun-cotton .
Second .
Analyses showing the decomposition of pellet gun-cotton .
In both these series the analyses are arranged in the order of the ascending pressures under which the decomposition took place .
Third and fourth .
Examples of the decomposition of strand and pellet gun-cotton when exploded by means of mercuric fulminate ; and , fifth , a series showing the decomposition experienced by pellet gun-cotton saturated with from 25 to 30 per cent , of water , and detonated by means of a primer of dry gun-cotton and mercuric fulminate .
I leave these results for discussion in the memoir which Sir F. Abel and I hope before long to submit , and will only remark that , in Tables I and II , the same peculiarity we have before remarked upon in reference to gunpowder , is again exhibited ; I mean the marked manner in which the carbonic anhydride increases with the pressure .
It will be noted that in Table I the volumes of carbonic anhydride and carbonic oxide are nearly exactly reversed ; again , considering that the composition of the pellet and strand gun-cotton is practically the same , the distinct difference between the proportions of these products in the two series is sufficiently remarkable .
It not improbably is connected with the rapidity of combustion of the two samples .
Another striking peculiarity is the manner in which the C02 is increased ( as exhibited in Table V ) when saturated pellet cotton is detonated .

I have found it most convenient to explode the charges , the permanent gases from which were to be measured , under a pressure of about 10 tons per square inch ( 1,524 atmospheres ) , and , under these circumstances , the average of several very accordant determinations gave , at 0 ' C. and 760 mm. of mercury , 689 c.c. per gram of strand gun-cotton and 725 c.c. per gram of pellet gun-cotton .
# Tlic pressures given are those due to the gravimetric density of the charge .
Researches on Explosives .
At the temperature of explosion the whole of the water formed is in the gaseous state .
It is therefore necessary , in order to obtain the total gaseous volume , to add to the above volumes of permanent gases the equivalent volume of aqueous vapour at the temperature and pressure stated .
Now the quantity of water formed by the explosion of 129*6 grams of gun-cotton was found to be 16*985 grams ; hence 1 gram of gun-cotton generated 0*1311 gram of water , equivalent to 162*6 c.c. of aqueous vapour , and the total volume of gaseous matter at the temperature and pressure stated is for strand gun-cotton 852*2 c.c. per gram , for pellet 887*6 c.c. The heat measured reached , with strand gun-cotton , 1068 gram-units water fluid , or 988 gram-units water gaseous , while with pellet gun-cotton these figures were 1037 or 957 gram-units respectively .
Pellet gun-cotton made at Stowmarket generated / 38 c.c. of permanent gas and 994 units of heat per gram , while dinitro-cellulose containing 12*8 per cent , of nitrogen generated 748 c.c. of gas and 977 units of heat , the water in both cases being fluid .
Gun-cotton , both pellet and strand , I have detonated by means of mercuric fulminate with ease and certainty .
The effect of employing this means of ignition in a close vessel is very striking , and the indications of intense heat are much more apparent than when the charge is fired in the ordinary way .
This effect is probably partly due to an actual higher temperature , caused by the greater rapidity of combustion .
I allude elsewhere to the extreme rapidity with which the gases part with their heat , but this higher heat is , I think , clearly indicated by the surfaces of the internal crusher gauges becoming covered with innumerable small cracks and by thin laminae occasionally flaking off exposed surfaces ; but perhaps the most striking proof of the violence of this detonation is showTn by its action on a cast-iron shell fired as I have described ; where no detonation takes place the shell is broken into fragments of various sizes , such as are familiar to all acquainted with the bursting of shell ; but when detonation , with gun-cotton , for example , takes place , the whole shell is reduced to very minute fragments , and , what is more remarkable , two-thirds of the total weight are generally in the form of small peas and of the finest dust .
The ease with which gun-cotton can be detonated renders it unsuitable for use as a propulsive agent unless this property be in some way neutralised .
I have , therefore , made but few experiments in this direction , and shall not further allude to them in this note , as more suitable explosives , explosives also of which gun-cotton is a principal component , have been elaborated , and these not only possess to the full the high ballistic properties of gun-cotton , but are more or less free from the tendency to detonate , which , however useful it may be 212 Capt. Sir A. Noble .
[ June 21 , in other directions , is a fatal objection to the employment of guncotton for propelling purposes .
Turning now to cordite ; cordite consists , as is well known , of nitro-glycerine and gun-cotton as its main ingredients .
As now made it contains 37 per cent , of gun-cotton ( trinitro-cellulose with a small proportion of soluble gun-cotton ) , 58 percent , of nitro-glycerine and 5 per cent , of a hydrocarbon known as vaselin .
On account of the importance of this explosive , I have made numerous experiments , both with large and small charges , to determine the relation of the tension to the density of the charge .
Up to densities of 055 the relation may be considered to be very approximately determined ; above that density , although many determinations have been made , these determinations have shown such wide variations that they cannot , until certain discrepancies are explained , be assumed as at all accurate .
The average results of some of the analyses of the permanent gases are given below :\#151 ; The first four analyses were made from experiments with the earlier samples of cordite when tannin formed an ingredient of cordite .
They are not , therefore , strictly comparable with the later analyses .
There appears also to be a difference in the transformation , slight but decided , which the same cordite experiences , dependent upon the diameter of the cord , and this difference is shown at once in the analyses , in the volume of permanent gases , in the heat developed , and , I think , in the amount of aqueous vapour formed .
The following are some of the analyses :\#151 ; VI .

In the whole of these analyses the water formed by the explosion smelt strongly of ammonia .
The quantity of permanent gases measured , under the same conditions as in the case of gun-cotton , was found to be\#151 ; For the earlier cordite , 655 vols .

cordite ; or , stating the resnlt per gram , these figures are respectively equivalent to 0'1563 gram , or 194 c.c. aqueous vapour , and to 01553 gram , or 192'5 c.c. per gram of cordite .
Hence the total gaseous products generated by the explosion of cordite amount per gram to 886 c.c. for the 0'255-in .
cordite , and to 890'5 c.c. for the 0'048-in .
cordite , the volumes being , of course , taken at 0 ' C. and 760 mm. atmospheric pressure .
The heat generated was found to before the earlier cordite , 1214 gram-units water fluid ; for the service 0'255-in .
cordite , 1284 gram-units water fluid or 1189 units water gaseous ; for the service 0'048-in .
cordite , 1272 units water fluid or 1178 units water gaseous .
' From my very numerous experiments on erosion I have arrived at the conclusion that the principal factors determining its amount are : ( 1 ) the actual temperature of the products of combustion , ( 2 ) the motion of these products .
But little erosive effect is produced , even by the most erosive powders , in close vessels , or in those portions of the chambers of guns where the motion of the gas is feeble or nil ; but the case is widely different where there is rapid motion of the gases at high densities .
It is not difficult absolutely to retain without leakage the products of explosions at very high pressures , but if there be any appreciable escape before the gases are cooled they instantly cut a way for themselves with astonishing rapidity , totally destroying the surfaces over or through which they pass .
Among all the explosives with which I have experimented I have found that where the heat developed is low the erosive effect is also low .
With ordinary powders , the most erosive with which I am acquainted is that which , on account of other properties , is used for the battering charges of heavy guns : I refer to brown prismatic powder .
The erosive effect of cordite , if considered in relation to the energy generated by the two explosives , is very slightly greater than that of | brown prismatic , but very much higher effects can , if it be so desired , be obtained with cordite , and , if the highest energy be demanded , the erosion will be proportionally greater .
There is , however , one curious and satisfactory peculiarity connected with erosion by cordite .
Erosion produced by ordinary gunpowder has the most singular effect on the metal of the gun , eating out large holes and forming long rough grooves , resembling a ploughed field in miniature , and these grooves have , moreover , the unpleasant habit of being very apt to develop into cracks ; but with cordite , so far as my experience goes , the erosion is of a very different character .
The eddy holes and long grooves are absent , and the erosion appears to consist in a simple washing away of the surface of the steel barrel .
Cordite does not detonate ; at least , although I have made far more experiments on detonation with this explosive than with any other , 214 Capt. Sir A Noble .
f June 21 , I have never succeeded in detonating it .
With an explosive like cordite , capable of developing enormous pressures , it is , of course easy , if the cordite be finely comminuted , to develop very high tensions , but , as I have already explained , a high pressure does not necessarily imply detonation .
The rapidity with which cordite gases lose their temperature , and consequently their pressure , by communication of their heat to their surrounding envelope is very striking .
Exploding a charge of about If lbs. of cordite in a close vessel at a tension of a little over 6 tons on the square inch , or say 1000 atmospheres , I have found that the pressure of 6 tons per square inch was again reached in 0'07 sec. after explosion , of 5 tons in 0171 sec. , of 4 tons in 0731 sec. , of 3 tons in 1764 secs .
, of 2 tons in 3'523 secs .
, and of 1 ton in 7'08 secs .
The loss of pressure after 1 ton per square inch was reached was , of course , slow , but the figures I have given were closely approximated to in two subsequent experiments .
With ordinary gunpowder the reduction of pressure was very much slower , as was to be expected , on account of the charge being much larger ; on account , also , of the temperature of explosion being much lower .
These experiments are now being continued with larger charges and higher pressures .
It only remains to give particulars as to ballistics , that is as to the velocities and energies realisable by cordite in the bore of a gun , but these will be most conveniently given with similar details regarding other explosives with which I have experimented .
The ballistite I have used has , like the cordite , been changed in composition since the commencement of my experiments .
The sample I used for my earlier experiments was nearly exactly composed of 50 per cent , of dinitro-cellulose ( collodion cotton ) and 50 per cent , of nitro-glycerine .
The cubes were coated with graphite , and the nitro-cellulose was wholly soluble in ether alcohol .
The second sample was nominally composed of 60 per cent , of nitro-cellulose and 40 per cent , of nitro-glycerine .

215 One gram of this ballistite gives rise to 610 c.c. of permanent gases , and to 0-1588 gram of aqueons vapour corresponding to 197 c.c. at 0 ' C and 760 mm. Hence the total volume of gas is 807 c.c. , and the heat generated by the explosion is 1,365 gram-units ( water fluid ) , 1,269 gram-units ( water gaseous ) .
Although I have not made nearly so many experiments on detonation with ballistite as with cordite , those I have made with the earlier samples ( 50 per cent , gun-cotton and 50 per cent , nitroglycerine ) neither detonated , nor did they show any tendency to detonate , but the case is different with respect to a sample of ballistite consisting of 60 per cent , gun-cotton and 40 per cent , nitroglycerine .
This sample , 012-in .

The erosive action of ballistite is , as might perhaps be anticipated from the higher heat developed , greater than with cordite , but the remarks made with respect to the action of cordite apply also to ballistite .
The French B.N. powder consists of nitro-cellulose partially gelatinised and mixed with tannin , with barium and potassium nitrates .

These permanent gases occupied at the usual temperature and pressure a volume of 616 c.c. ; the aqueous vapour formed occupied in addition 206 c.c. , so that the total gaseous volume was 822 c.c. The heat generated was 1,003 gram-units ( water fluid ) or 902 gram-units ( water gaseous ) ; the ballistics obtained with this powder are given along with those furnished by other explosives .

[ June 21 , of comparing the velocities and energies developed by the new explosives is by the aid of diagrams .
Accordingly , in Fig. 1 , I show the velocities of seven different explosives from the commencement of motion to the muzzle of the gun ; the position of the points at which the velocity is determined are shown , and on the lowest and highest curves the observed velocities are marked where it is possible to do so without confusing the diagram .
Lines are drawn to indicate the velocities that are obtained with the lengths of 40 , 50 , 75 , and 100 calibres .
Fig. 2 shows the pressures by which the velocities of Fig. 1 were obtained .
The areas of these curves represent the energies l'ealised , and the lines intersecting the curves indicate the pressures at which the gases are discharged from the muzzle for lengths of 40 , 50 , 75 , and 100 calibres respectively .
The chamber pressures indicated by crusher gauges are also shown in Fig. 2 , and it will be observed that the two modes of determining the maximum pressure are in general in close accordance .
It will further be observed that with the slow-burning powders the chronoscopic maximum pressures are somewhat , though not greatly higher , than are those indicated by the crusher gauges .
This observation is not new.* It was noted in the long series of experiments with black powders carried on by the Committee of Explosives .
The result is widely different where an explosive powder or a quickly-burning powder , such as R.L.G. , giving rise to wave-pressure is employed ; the crusher gauge in such casest gives considerably and frequently very greatly higher pressures , and this peculiarity is illustrated in the curve from R.L.G. in Fig. 2 .
It is , perhaps , hardly necessary to point out that the results given in Fig. 1 have to be considered in relation to the facts disclosed in Fig. 2 .
Thus it will be noted that the velocities and energies realised by 22 lb. of 0'35-in .
cordite and 20 lb. of 0'3-in .
cordite are practically the same , but reference to Fig. 2 shows that with the 0'3-in .
cordite this velocity and energy has been obtained at the cost of nearly 30 per cent , higher maximum pressure .
A similar remark may be made in regard to the French B.N. powder if compared with the ballistite .
Its velocity and energy are obtained at a high cost of maximum pressure , and it is interesting to note how the velocity curve of B.N. , which for the first four feet of motion shows a velocity higher than that of any other explosive , successively crosses other curves , and gives at the muzzle a velocity of 500 f.s. under that of cordite .

] Measurement of Colour produced by Contrast .
Figs. 1 and 2 are summarised in the annexed table , which shows for each nature of explosive the advantage in velocity and energy to be gained by correspondingly lengthening the gun .
Fig. 3 is an interesting illustration of a point to which I have elsewhere adverted .
Cordite and ballistite leave no deposit in the bore .
Round 1 with R.L.G. was fired with a clean bore .
The difference in velocity between round 1 with a clean bore and rounds 2 and 3 with powder deposit in the chase is very clearly marked , and it will be noted that in this instance the effect of the foul bore is only distinctly shown when the length exceeds 40 calibres .
From 40 calibres onwrards the loss of velocity due to a bore encrusted with deposit is very distinctly shown .

" Measurement of Colour produced by Contrast .
By Captain W. de W. Abney .
C.B. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. Received June 5 , 1894 .
No definite measurements , as far as I am aware , have been made of the change in colour produced by contrast , except in a small work of my own in which results were given in terms of colour mixtures , and earlier by a brief reference in a work by Rood , in which the change produced was endeavoured to be matched by means of rotating disks .
The method of registering any colour in terms of some definite wave-length of light , together with white light ( see 4 Proceedings Royal Society , ' vol. 49 ) renders the registration of any colour readily effected , and by applying it to the contrast colours , very fair results have been obtained , which cannot be very far from the truth .
It is usually stated that the contrast colour produced on a white surface by an adjacent colour is the complementary colour , of course largely diluted with wdiite light .
I should like to point out that in the first place we have to know what a complementary colour is , and in the second what the added white light may be .
As a matter of fact the kind of white light employed has to be defined before it can he stated what the complementary to any colour may be .
11 , for instance , we wish to define what the complementary of orange maybe , we must know what is the nature of the white light before we can give the complementary .
Suppose we take the white of daylight , or of the electric light , we know that to make a white of this character we must add a certain quantity of blue of a certain wave length to the orange .
When it is produced under these circumstances , the blue is the complementary to the orange .
Suppose , however , we wish to know the complementary to the orange , in what is called the wrhite light of the amyl acetate lamp , or of a candle , we are at once met by a difficulty .
