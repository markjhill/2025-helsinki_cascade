Observationsfor ascertaining the length of the Pendulum at Madras in the East Indies , latitude 1 ยง 4 ' 9",1 N. with the conclusions drawn from the same .
By JOHN GOLDINGHAM , Esq. F.R. S. Read January 31 , 1822 .
1 HE object of the enquiry in this paper has been considered at all times one of interest and importance , and is particularly so at present , when investigations have been completed in Europe , by order of some of the governments there ; such as , with reference to their accuracy , had never before been made in any quarter of the globe , so far as comes within my recollection .
I had seen the details of Captain KATER'S experiments in the Philosophical Transactions , and he also did me the favour to send me out a copy of his Paper .
The simplicity and accuracy of the apparatus induced me to write to that Gentleman , requesting he would have the goodness to order a similar one to be sent to me .
This request he not only most readily complied with , but made the experiments requisite for enabling me to draw the conclusions ; and thence to form the comparison with the results obtained in Europe .
The apparatus arrived in March , and I immediately set about fixing it ; which , notwithstanding the little solid assistance to be obtained in an operation of this nature from workmen in this country , I was enabled to effect in a most satisfactory manner ; and I am led to hope , these observations will not be deemed unworthy the attention of the learned in Europe .
The clock used in these experiments has a gridiron pendulum , the motion being given by a spring ; the maker 's name is HASWELL , and the works are of the best description : it was fixed to the north wall of the Observatory , which is of solid masonry two feet in thickness : the rate was ascertained by comparisons with the transit clock each day , at the commencement and conclusion of the experiments : the transit of the noon before the comparison , and that after , were used in finding this rate ; so that four results were obtained from the two comparisons : the transit clock , which is an excellent time keeper , was regulated by transits of the sun and stars ; the weather fortunately having been clear , both at noon and at night , during the time the experiments were making .
The first operation performed was that of making the weight of the clock pendulum black , and fixing the disc on the centre .
This having been done , five blocks of seasoned teak-wood , each 4 inches in diameter and 7 in length , were prepared ; the place above the clock for the frame , which was to support the pendulum , was then marked .
This I did with great care and precaution : intersecting lines were drawn upon the wall to show the exact position of the centres of the blocks and of the screws for fastening the frame ; holes 4 inches in diameter and 1o in depth , ( it being necessary to let the outer part of the blocks 'I inches within the surface of the wall , to bring the pendulum sufficiently near the clock case ) were then made in the wall , and the blocks , coated with tar to preserve them from the white ants , were let in and firmly secured .
The outer surfaces of the whole , which had previously been made smooth and level , being in one plane .
The frame , its two parts being firmly screwed together , was then placed , levelled by means of a spirit level , and fixed to the blocks in the firmest manner : the frame enclosing the agates was next put up , levelled , and screwed in its place , the Y 's elevated , and the pendulum hung ; the knife edges were then lowered upon the agates ; when I had the satisfaction to find , from the precautions which I had taken , that the pendulum was most correctly in its place .
In this distant part of the globe , there is an anxiety in handling and fixing any new apparatus which is not felt in England , where the maker of it is ready to give assistance , as well as to repair any damage that may chance to have been done : here , little or no assistance can be obtained ; and if the use of any part of the apparatus should be mistaken , and the part forced into a wrong place , the injury may be fatal to the experiments , as it cannot be repaired here ; it therefore affords no small gratification when an instrument is firmly secured , uninjured , in its proper position .
The pendulum is precisely the same , in all its parts , as that used by Captain KATER at the different stations of the Trigonometrical Survey of England , and which he has fully described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819 .
Any farther description therefore of its construction , will here be unnecessary .
The next operation was to fix the arc for measuring the vibrations .
The clock-case was of handsome mahogany enriched with projecting mouldings , with the door in front of plate glass .
The mouldings kept the pendulum at too great a distance from the part of the case where the arc could otherwise have been fastened , and it became necessary to have a support in front of the case .
I therefore had a solid stand of teak wood made , similar to that for supporting the telescope , the inner part cut out to the form of the mouldings of the clock-case , so that it fitted perfectly close to it in this position it was screwed to the floor ; the ends for the supports of the arc were then let in , and secured to the top of the stand , and the arc fixed in its proper place , with reference to the extreme point of the pendulum .
The floor outside of this apparatus was then separated from the part of the floor which supported it , to prevent any shake by per .
sons moving about within the building .
The small telescope containing the diaphragm was now fixed upon its stand , and screwed to the floor at the proper distance from the pendulum : this was about 9q feet .
The telescope , and every other part of the apparatus , have been so fully described by Captain KATER in the paper published in the Philosophical Transactions , that I feel it unnecessary to be more particular here.* While making the holes in the wall above the clock for the insertion of the blocks for supporting the frame , a great deal of dust would necessarily fall upon the clock-case ; every part of the case where dust could penetrate was therefore filled up with wax , and several folds of cloth were afterwards secured over the whole of the case , so that it was hardly possible that any dust could penetrate to the works of the clock .
After the frame was fixed , the cloth and wax were removed , and fresh oil applied to the works .
The drawing [ P1 .
XIV ] shows the inside of a part of the Observatory , the pendulum up , and the adjustment of the diaphragm making , preparatory to commencing the observations .
The clock was then set in motion .
This was on the s2d of March , and the observations commenced two days afterwards .
The following is the mode pursued in making the observations .
The pendulum was lifted up from the Y 's by myself and an assistant , and the knife edges wiped with a cloth saturated with oil .
The pendulum was then replaced , and the Y 's lowered , so that the knife edges rested upon the agates .
The telescope was then adjusted ( care being taken that the O on the arc of vibration coincided with the point of the slip ) , so that the edges of the slip were exactly embraced by the edges of the diaphragm .
The height of the barometer , of the thermometer fixed near the middle of the pendulum , and that of the hygroneter , were taken and registered .
The point of the slip at the end of the pendulum was then brought and kept by the hand to about ?
1,3 upon the arc ; and an instant before the pendulum of the clock was at its highest point on the same side , the hand was withdrawn , and the pendulum thereby allowed to vibrate freely .
I stationed the head Bramin assistant* to take down the time , and the youngest Bramin assistant to count the clock , which he does with the greatest correctness .
Having placed myself at the telescope , I found there was a sensible portion of time , more or less , as the arc of vibration was greater or smaller , between the disappearance of the disc behind the slip , and its reappearance ; I therefore noticed the seconds , and parts of a second , when the disc disappeared , and also the instant when it again appeared , both which the Bramin put down ; the mean of these I took as the true time of the coincidence , and registered it accordingly .
These times I found could be accurately noted ; and it is probable the mean of the two observations is generally correct to less than half a second .
In this manner the times of the coincidences were observed .
The thermometer often varying a good deal in a short time , I thought it right to take its height three times , at the third observation of each set , as well as the first and fifth .
The barometer was observed at the end of each set , as well as at the beginning ; and also the hygrometer , as mentioned above , at the beginning of the observations , and likewise at the end of those of each day ; being desirous of seeing how much the atmosphere had changed in dryness , as well as in heat and weight ; not that this was material , but it is satisfactory to know what change there actually was in the atmosphere during the time the observations were making .
I now proceed to detail the observations .
Every observation taken is here given .
As although in this as in similar cases , one feels better pleased with some observations than with others , yet I do not recollect more than two of these observations , which I felt dissatisfied with at the time , and that not in a sufficient degree to induce me to think of rejecting them .
The results , I trust , will prove how unnecessary it would have been to have rejected any of the observations .
The correction for the arc of vibration was ascertained by multiplying the square of the mean arc by 1,6385 .
The correction for temperature was found as follows : the mean of the thermometer at the beginning and middle of the observations was taken , and that of the middle and end ; which gave five heights , one for each observation ; the mean of the first and second , of the second and third , and so on in succession was taken , which gave four mean heights ; the difference between each of these and 70 was multiplied by o,4s3 , the part of a vibration due to each degree of the thermometer , as furnished by Captain KATER , and the required correction was obtained .
The rate of the clock was found as before mentioned .
The following shows the daily rate of the transit clock , in the interval during which the observations were taken ; and furnishes a satisfactory example of the good performance of this standard for finding the rate of the other clock .

In this series , besides comparisons for the rate of the clock used in the experiments , with the transit clock at the time of making the experiments , transits of stars were taken with this clock for the purpose .
The result of this series , however , seems to prove , that every necessary precaution had been used in the first , the difference of the two being only 0 , o6 of a vibration in 24 hours.* The following are the Observations of the Second Series .

The country is flat ; the nearest elevation being St. Thomas 's Mount , which is 9950 yards , or 5,654 miles off , and rises but little above the ordinary level.* There is a range of low hills a short distance beyond St. Thomas 's Mount ; and the Pulicat Mountains , which are of considerable elevation , are 39 miles off .
The soil about Madras is composed of sand and blue mud , and this to as great depths as the wells have been sunk .
I do not recollect any rock having been found .
I have therefore used 0,66 as a multiplier to 0,095 , the correction for 27 feet , which gives o , o6 to be added to the number of beats in e4 hours .
The last correction required was for the buoyancy of the atmosphere .
Having no information relative to the specific gravity of the pendulum , I was obliged to determine it in the best way the limited means in this country afforded .
This was done with a balance at a dispensary , and with the aid of Mr. BRUCE , the proprietor of the establishment .
The Madras water drawn from wells in the Black town here , and conducted into the cisterns in the fort , is considered among the purest in the world .
This was boiled , and strained into a tin trough prepared for the purpose ; the pendulum also was securely and properly slung by means of brass wire , with the assistance of Mr. GORDON , jeweller , of this place .
The water was at the same temperature with the atmosphere , and the experiments were made with every care .
It may be unnecessary to detail them here ; I shall therefore proceed to the result , which was as follows : Thermometer 88 ?
, barometer 3o,064 inches , specific gravity of the pendulum 8 , io85 .
Hence the specific gravity of the pendulum for the mean of the first series of observations , the thermometer being 838,48 , and barometer 8o,121 , was 8,02096 , and the correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere is -+6,2075 vibrations .
For the second series , the thermometer having been 85 ?
, 9 , and barometer 3o,258 in- , ches , this correction is 6e,2o vibrtioions .
These corrections being applied to the number of vibrations before found , will give the true number of vibrations of the pendulum in 24 hours in vacuo at the level of the sea , the thermometer being 70 ?
, and are as follow : By the first series 'of observations , 86172,3755 .
By the second series , 86172,328 , The mean being 86172,352 .
The length of the seconds pendulum in London , ( latitude 51 ?
$1 ' 8",4 N. ) at the temperature of 70 ?
, according to Captain KATER , is 39,14213 inches .
Now , the pendulum of expriment used at Madras , made 86293,4 vibrations in 24 hours in London , latitude as before , and 83 feet above the level of the sea , the mean height of the thermometer being 67 ?
, 6 , of the barometer 29,97 inches ( vide Appendix ) .
The correction for the height above the sea is 0,22 , and that for the buoyancy of the atmosphere 6,566 , both to be added : these corrections being applied , will give 86300,26 for the number of vibrations of the pendulum of experiment in 24 hours in vacuo at the level of the sea , the temperature being 70 ? .
