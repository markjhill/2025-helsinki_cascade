] After describing the geological locality and the external character of the above mineral , and adverting particularly to its oily smell , Mr. Knox proceeds to show , by its chemical analysis , that , exclusive of the constituents of this substance ascertained by Klaproth , it contains a considerable but variable proportion of a peculiar bitumen , separable from it by distillation at high temperatures .
The author also succeeded in detecting some volatile principle in the pitch-stone of Meisser , analysed by Klaproth , as also in that of Arran ; but it exists in them in smaller quantities than in the pitch-stone of Newry .
After having separated the water and bitumen from the mineral by heat , Mr. Knox found that by subjecting the residue to a bright red heat , it assumed not merely the appearance , but the properties of pumice ; and he attributes this appearance to the slow escape of the bituminous matter , producing a vesicular structure .
The author details in this paper the process of analysis which he employed for the separation of the constituent parts of this pitchstone , and adverts to those circumstances in which it appears to differ from the varieties of the mineral previously examined .
