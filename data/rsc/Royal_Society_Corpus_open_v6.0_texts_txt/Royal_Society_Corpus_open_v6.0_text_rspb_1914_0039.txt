] Introduction .
In previous papers* the morphology of this trypanosome and its action on animals were described .
The chief object of this paper is to compare the development of this species of trypanosome with that of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland\#151 ; the T. rhodesiense of Stephens and Fantham .
The development of the latter has already been described . !
It will therefore only be necessary here to present the various data in the form of tables and figures , which can then be compared with similar tables and figures in the previous paper .
The Development of T. brucei , Zululand Strain , 1913 , in G. morsitans .
Seven experiments were made with laboratory-bred flies .
Three of these were positive and four negative .
Two experiments were also made with wild flies , both of which were positive .

Description of a Strain of T. brucei from 527 Three hundred and eight flies were used and 47 infected flies were found\#151 ; 15'3 per cent. It is difficult or impossible to explain the difference in the ratio of infected flies .
Experiment 1857 has only one infected fly in 58 ; Experiment 1988 , 20 in 45 .
There is no record as to whether Cage 1857 was kept in the incubator or not , but it is to be presumed that it was , as was the habit at that date .
From Table III it will be seen that the flies in Experiment 1988 were fed for eight days on an infected dog , monkey , and goat .
It is possible that this had something to do with the high rate of infection , but it is impossible to say with certainty .
The scarcity of laboratory-bred flies made it out of the question to pursue this line of inquiry .
Experiment 2188 has also only one infected fly in 30 , but this is capable of explanation .
Experiments 2188 and 2188a were carried out for the sake of economy with the same cage of flies .
It having become evident ( see Table IY ) that the flies after their first feeding on an infected rat had failed to infect Monkey 2203 , the 20 remaining flies were again fed on an infected guinea-pig , with the result that eight of them became infected .

July 22 2309 50 + 0 34 84 ' F. ( 29 ' C. ) " 26 2313 50 + 5 24 84 ' F. ( 29 ' O. ) In Experiment 2309 none of the flies were dissected , hence no infected flies were found .
In Experiment 2313 , only 21 flies out of 50 were dissected .
These experiments are tabulated here as they give the number of days before the flies became infective , and thus afford data as to the length of time the cycle of development runs in the fly .
Details of the Five Positive Experiments .
The following table gives the principal details in the carrying out of the five positive experiments .
The first three were carried out with laboratory-bred flies , the last two with wild flies .
It would appear from these five experiments that an average period of 21 days elapses before the cycle of development of T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , is complete in G. morsitans and the fly becomes infective .

Three of these had the salivary glands swarming with trypanosomes ; in none was the labial cav ity or hypopharynx found to contain flagellates .
In Experiment 1988 , 20 infected flies were found .
Two had an invasion of the salivary glands .
In one it is noted that a few active trypanosomes were seen in the labial cavity , and in one that a few blood foims wcie seen in the hypopharynx .
In Experiment 2188a , eight infected flies were found , one of which had 530 Sir D. Bruce and others .

\#151 ; In none of the negative experiments was an infection of the salivary glands found .
Nine infected flies were dissected , but not one of these had passed into the infective stage .
No parasites were found in the proboscis at any time .
From a consideration of these tables it will be seen that this strain of T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , belongs to the same group as gambiense and the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland as far as their development in G. palpalis and G. mis concerned .
This development takes place in the intestine of the fly and , after a varying number of days , passes forward into the salivary glands , where the final stage in the cycle is reached\#151 ; the infective or " blood forms .
" In this group the parasites are never found fixed in the labial cavity as in the and vivax groups .
The Type of Trypanosome found in the Infected Flies .
Plate 25 represents the developmental forms of T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , found in the proventriculus and salivary glands of G. morsitans .
A description of the various types found in the different parts of the alimentary tract is not considered necessary , as they are identical with those found in the development of T. gambiense in G. palpalis , which have already been fully described.* Figs. 1 and 2 are two long trypanosomes from the proventriculus .
Figs. 3-6 are the same , but they were extruded on to a cover-glass by * 'Roy .

Strain ofT .
brucei from Zululand .
a living non-infective fly , and probably came through the labial cavity from the proventriculus .
Some of them may possibly have come from the hypopharynx , and in that case they may have been proventricular forms on their way to infect the salivary glands .
Figs. 7-20 are various types found in the salivary glands\#151 ; crithidial , encysted , and immature " blood forms .
" Figs. 21-28 represent the finished product\#151 ; the infective or " blood forms .
" If this plate is compared with that representing the developmental forms of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland* in the proventriculus and salivary glands of G. morsitcins , the extraordinary likeness between the two is at once evident , and is another argument in favour of these two strains being identical .
Conclusions .
1 .
T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , belongs to the same group as T. gambiense as regards its cycle of development in the tsetse fly .
2 .
It has been shown that the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland also belongs to the same group .
3 .
The cycle of development of the Nyasaland and Zululand trypanosomes in G. morsitans is so marvellously alike that it affords another reason for believing in the identity of these two trypanosomes .
