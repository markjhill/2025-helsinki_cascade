240 Determinations of Wave-length from Eclipse Spectra .
In conclusion , I must express my indebtedness to the Director of the Laboratory , Dr. Glazebrook , at whose instigation this work was carried out , to Dr. Chree , Superintendent of the Observatory Department , for much valuable information , and to Mr. W. Hugo , who was responsible for the whole of the observational work of the calibrations and also assisted in the comparisons .

) This paper gives the wave-lengths deduced from measures of a number of photographs of the chromosphere and corona obtained in three eclipse expeditions from the Royal Observatory , Greenwich .
The spectra extend from wave-length 3300 to 5875 .
Nearly all the brighter lines of the chromosphere are identified with practical certainty , the observed wave-length differing in very few cases by 0T tenth-metre from the line with which it is identified .
The identification was principally made by comparison with the spark spectra of Exner and Haschek , Sir Norman Lockyer 's results being used for " enhanced " lines .
For comparison , the intensities of the corresponding lines in the spark , arc , and solar spectra are given , obtained from various published sources .
The wave-lengths and intensities of a number of lines in the spectrum of the higher chromosphere obtained at Sfax in 1905 are also given .
The wave-lengths and intensities of the lines observed in the spectra of the corona at the three eclipses are also given .
The paper is purely descriptive and shows in detail the relation between the chromospheric spectrum and those of the spark and arc , but does not attempt to assign physical causes to the differences and resemblances .
