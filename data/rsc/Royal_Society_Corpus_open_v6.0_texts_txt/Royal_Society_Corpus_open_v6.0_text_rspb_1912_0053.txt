299 Antelojpe as a Reservoir for Trypanosoma gambiense .
By H. L. Duke .
( Communicated by Sir J. R. Bradford , K.C.M.G. , Sec. R.S. Received April 20 , \#151 ; Read June 6 , 1912 .
) In considering the problem of the prolonged infectivity of Glossina palpalis along the shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza , the subject must be approached from three points of view:\#151 ; Firstly .
Some idea of the percentage of infected wild flies must be obtained from time to time , in order to gauge the efficacy of the reservoir .
Secondly .
The wild animals frequenting the lake shore must be examined for T. gambiense .
Thirdly .
The effect of T. gambiense on these animals should be studied in the laboratory .
With regard to the requirements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it has been pointed out in a recent report covering the period from March , 1911 , to January , 1912 , that the percentage of infected flies along the Chagwe coast line is still 0*014 per cent. , i.e. , a very slight diminution from that reported in June , 1909 .
During the interim no natives have been allowed in the neighbourhood of the fly , except those in the employ of the laboratory , who are under constant observation .
On Damba Island in May , 1911 , Carpenter obtained an infection of a monkey with T. gambiense , using 880 wild fly , and two out of four situtunga antelope shot on this island were found to harbour this trypanosome .
For Damba Island , therefore , it would appear that the role of the antelope in keeping up the infectivity of the wild fly is conclusively established .
The conditions on this island are , however , in many ways exceptional , as the fly and antelope are brought into very frequent contact .
Under such conditions it would not be necessary for the antelope to remain infected over a very protracted period of time in order to keep up the infectivity of the fly .
In other words , a single infected antelope let loose on Damba Island would soon infect a large number of Glossince , which would in turn have access to numerous situtunga .
Nothing short of a very rapidly acquired immunity to the disease in the antelope could prevent a relatively large number of fly being infective at any given time .
On the mainland the opportunities for the fly to bite these animals probably occur much less frequently ; and bearing in mind the small percentage of flies capable of carrying T. gambiense , it becomes of great importance to know how long an -antelope can remain infective .
x 2 Dr. H. L. Duke .
Antelope as a [ Apr. 20 , That these animals may remain infective to fly for a period of at least 10 months after their original infection with T. gambiense has already been proved by the study of the antelope in captivity at Mpumu .
The animals during this period remain in excellent health , as may be judged from the fact that two young bushbuck have been born in captivity .
The infectivity of these antelope to laboratory-bred gradually diminished , until in March , 1911 , it appeared probable that the parasites had disappeared from their blood .
Up to this date the evidence of infectivity afforded by the presence of trypanosomes in the laboratory-bred palpalis fed upon the buck , proved sufficiently regular without resorting to blood injection .
This latter method was considered a more searching and final test .
The experiments given in this paper represent the continuation of these investigations from March , 1910 , to January , 1912 .
During this period laboratory-bred G. palpalis were fed upon the antelope , and their blood was also tested by injection into susceptible animals .
The injection test , rendering possible the control of considerable quantities of blood , gradually came to supersede the employment of clean flies .
There is no reason to doubt that an antelope infective to fly will also give a positive result upon inoculation of its blood into a susceptible animal , and vice versd .
The objection to the fly test consists in the small proportion of the laboratory-bred flies used which are capable of harbouring the trypanosome .
The expenditure of time and trouble is also obviously far greater where a box of flies is concerned than the mere injection of a few cubic centimetres of blood .
In several of the more recent experiments the flies were dissected without ever having fed upon a clean susceptible animal , the presence or absence of flagellates being sufficient evidence as to the infectivity of the antelope .
A few preliminary experiments were undertaken to determine whether the animals had acquired any immunity to T. gambiense .
These are included below .
This question has , however , only been superficially dealt with , as the bushbuck selected as most suitable for the experiment became pregnant .

Previous to Experiment 653 a period of nine months had elapsed without a positive result being obtained .
Considerable caution is therefore necessary in pronouncing these antelope negative .
It may be noted here that , as in the case of Monkey 199 inoculated from Reedbuck 2359 , the strain of trypanosomes in Monkey 653 appears peculiarly adapted to development in G. palpalis .
Sufficient time has , however , not yet elapsed to definitely establish this point .

These will be undertaken shortly .
The size of the animal and its resentment of handling make the satisfactory application of the fly test very difficult .
There is , however , every reason to believe that the infected fly of Box 22 must have fed at least once upon this waterbuck , and the animal apparently resisted re-infection .
For some time past it has been suffering from an injured foot , which has prevented more extensive investigations being carried out .

It was desired to ascertain whether any degree of immunity to T. gambiense had been acquired , with a view to further experiments with the serum .
Bushbuck 2328 has , with the exception of the first few months after infection , always proved negative .
As in the case of Waterbuck 2378 , the last evidence of infectivity was obtained some four months after infection , the other bushbuck and reedbuck remaining infective for some considerable time longer .
It appeared therefore very probable that the trypanosome had died out in this particular antelope .

Antelope as a [ Apr. 20 , The following Experiment 195 represents an attempt to influence the course of an infection of T. gambiense in a monkey by treating the latter with the serum of Bushbuck 2328 .

On August 16 to 17,1911 , the monkey was fed upon by positive Experiment 22 .
On August 30 , T. gambiense first appeared in the blood of the monkey , the incubation period being thus 13 to 14 days .
On September 3 , 1911 , the monkey received 2\ c.c. serum of Bushbuck 2328 , without any diminution being observed in the number of trypanosomes .
February , 1912 , Monkey 195 is still alive and apparently in good health .
The interval , however , is not long enough to warrant any criticism as to the effect of the above treatment on the disease , which would , however , appear to be pursuing quite an ordinary course .
The most striking point about this experiment is the long incubation period of the disease in the monkey .
Normally after infection with Box 22 , trypanosomes appeared in the monkey 's blood after an interval of seven days only .
Further experiments with this bushbuck had to be discontinued owing to the animal becoming pregnant .
This bushbuck has apparently successfully resisted the attempt to re-infect it with positive flies in June , 1911 .
Further investigations are essential before a definite opinion can be pronounced as to its immunity .
Experiments will be carried out with a view to re-infection by direct blood injection , and following a negative result , the reaction of the serum will be investigated .
The following experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether the serum of these antelope had acquired any immunising properties .
The animal selected was Reedbuck 2359 , which at the time , June , 1911 , had shown no evidence of infectivity for some seven months .
As may be seen above , this animal was subsequently proved to be infective in July , 1911\#151 ; one month after the experiments were carried out .
( 1 ) Has the serum of Reedbuck 2359 any trypanolytic action on T. gambiense ?
1912.1 Reservoir for Trypanosoma gambiense .
Two tubes A and B were prepared , each containing \#163 ; vol. serum and | vol. citrated T. gambiense-blood .
Tube A contained serum of Beedbuck 2359 ; tube B serum of a bushbuck which had never been infected with T. gambiense .
The tubes were placed for four hours in incubator at 28 ' C. The contents were examined at intervals during this time , but no difference was observed in the motility of the trypanosomes , and no agglutination was seen in either tube .
( 2 ) Has serum of Beedbuck 2359 any protective action against T. gambiense ?
( ?
) On June 15 , 1911 , a white rat received 15 HI serum of reedbuck , and on June 16 , 1911 , 24 hours after , was injected with a small dose of T. gambiense .
The rat died in 25 days .
( ?
) In two tubes A and B were placed respectively vol. of serum of reedbuck and S vol. of citrated T. gablood , and \#163 ; vol. serum of normal bushbuck and f vol. of citrated T. blood .
The tubes were kept at room temperature in the dark .
The contents of the tubes were examined at intervals of 3 , 5^ , and 6| hours , without any differences being noted ; 6| hours after the commencement of the experiment , 6 TH .
of each tube-contents was inoculated into white rats C and D. These rats died in 23 and 21 days respectively .
The T. gambiense employed in the above experiments was a strain derived from wild Lake-shore flies .
It is to be regretted that no control injection of trypanosomes alone was performed , owing to scarcity of rats and my failure at the time to realise the importance of the point .
It will be noticed that the disease in both cases was extraordinarily rapid .
Whether this was due to the trypanosome strain , or to the antelope serum , or to both these factors , cannot at present be decided .
The monkey from which the trypanosome was taken was killed two months after the infection .
Iu a subsequent experiment , in which a white rat was injected with another strain of Lake-shore trypanosomes derived from fly , the disease lasted 54 days .
The various T. garribiense strains at Mpumu all give rise to a fairly protracted disease in rats .
The above facts warrant an enquiry as to the identity of the trypanosomes obtained in monkeys by feeding wild Lake-shore palpalis upon these animals .
The trypanosomes so obtained have always been described by Bruce as T. gambiense , though I am unaware of the nature of the evidence adduced in support of this assertion .
It is , of course , extremely probable , considering the recent epidemic along the Lake-shore and the nature of local cattle diseases , that these trypanosomes found in wild flies and pathogenic to monkeys are T.gambiense .
Nevertheless , the question cannot be summarily Dr. H. L. Duke .
Antelope as a [ Apr. 20 , dismissed , owing to the fact that other species of trypanosomes can produce similar symptoms in these animals .
The point of practical importance to be established is whether these trypanosomes are pathogenic to man , and this is obviously very difficult to prove .
In a recent paper I have discussed the differential diagnosis of trypanosomes recovered from the Lake-shore and T. The recent discovery that T. rhodesiense is susceptible to the action of human serum is of great interest in this connection , since on theoretical grounds alone a trypanosome which succumbed to human serum in vitro and in laboratory animals might well be judged non-pathogenic to man .
In the present instance it must be borne in mind that , although these Lake-shore trypanosomes , whether found in wild flies or in wild antelope , may have been originally derived from human beings during the recent epidemic , it is possible that the prolonged sojourn in other hosts may have materially modified the reactions of the original " Uganda " strain .
Apart from its pathogenicity to man , there is little in the behaviour of T. rhodesiense to suggest close affinity to T. Its recently discovered susceptibility to the action of human serum , together with many of its animal reactions , suggest rather resemblances to brucei .
This latter trypanosome has up to the present time been generally considered to be non-pathogenic to man .
The mere fact , however , that rhodesiense was originally recovered from man is sufficient to account for the controversy which has arisen over the attempt to separate this trypanosome from gambiense .
In the same way with these Lake-shore trypanosomes .
Whatever be the scale of virulence established , the final diagnosis will always depend upon the behaviour of the organism in the human subject .
In reviewing the above experiments it will be seen that these antelope are apparently very slowly losing their infectivity for T. gambiense .
The animals are all in excellent health , and in two out of four cases the most recent evidence has been afforded by positive laboratory-bred pcdpalis .
It would thus seem that the adaptation of T. gambiense in these antelope approaches very nearly the biological ideal , i.e. , a compromise between the trypanosome and its host , whereby , without injuring the latter , the parasite becomes peculiarly well equipped to survive in the insect carrier .
Time alone can show whether this balance between parasite and antelope host can be maintained indefinitely .
Judging from the case of Bushbuck 2371 it is quite reasonable to expect evidence of infectivity to crop up occasionally at long intervals in these laboratory animals .
Surrounded by wild flies in nature such an antelope as 2371 might well prove a far greater danger than would appear from the long intervals occurring between positive experiments 1912 .

in the laboratory .
It is , of course , possible that the trypanosomes may be slowly dying out in the buck , and that a greater or less immunity may be left behind .
But even if this be so , an animal which can remain infective for 22 months may be looked upon as a true reservoir for the virus of sleeping-sickness .
It has only to remain in the neighbourhood of the fly to perpetuate the disease indefinitely among susceptible Lake-shore animals .
The behaviour of the positive flies obtained from Antelope 2371 and 2357 , 13 and 15 months respectively after the original infection , is interesting .
In the first case , the positive fly did not infect the monkey until the 50th day of the experiment ; and in the second instance , a 41-day fly showed no flagellates in either proventriculus or salivary glands .
In all previous experiments with these antelope the flies became infective about the 30th day of the experiment .
An explanation of this curiously slow development of the flagellates in the fly may be that the trypanosomes are present in very small numbers in the peripheral blood of the buck .
A fly would then obtain an extremely small number of trypanosomes at a feed , whereas formerly a considerable number may have been imbibed .
Some support is lent to this suggestion by the prolonged incubation period in Experiment 199 ( Beedbuck 2359 ) , where 18 days elapsed before T. gambiense appeared in the monkey 's blood .
Conclusions .
1 .
That the antelope may remain capable of infecting G. palpalis with T. gambiense for a period of at least 22 months after their original infection with this trypanosome .
2 .
That there is some evidence to show that an antelope which has ceased to be infective for T. gambiense acquires some degree of immunity against re-infection .
