( Abstract .
) The animals of which the retina was examined were the frog , the black and yellow salamander , the edible turtle , the waterand the land-tortoise , the Spanish Gecko , the blindworm , and the common snake .
The method adopted was to examine the retina ( where possible ) immediately after decapitation of the animal , alone and with chemical agents ; and to make sections of the retina hardened in alcohol or in an aqueous solution of chromic acid , staining them with iodine or carmine , and adding glycerine , pure and diluted , to make them transparent .
The following is a summary of the results of the examination .
1 .
The rods and cones consist of two segments , the union of which is marked by a bright transverse line .
2 .
Each segment consists of a membranous sheath and contents .
3 .
The outer segment , or shaft , is a long narrow rectangle ( by inference , a prism or cylinder ) .
It refracts more highly than the inner segment .
Its contents are structureless , and of an albuminous nature .
It is that part which is commonly known as " the rod .
" It is smaller in the cones than in the rods , and in the cones narrows slightly outwards .
4 .
The outer ends of the shafts rest upon the inner surface of the choroid , and their sides are separated by pigmented processes , prolonged from the inner surface of the choroid between them to the line that marks the union of the shaft with the inner segment .
The effect of this is that the shafts are completely insulated , and rays entering one shaft are prevented passing out of it into neighbouring shafts .
5 .
The inner segment of the rods and cones , or body ( the appendage of some microscopists ) , has a generally flask-shaped form , longer and more tapering in the rods , shorter and stouter in the cones .
It is much paler and less conspicuous than the shaft .
It fits in an aperture in the membrana limitans externa .
Its inner end always encloses , or is connected by an intermediate band with an outer granule which lies in or below the level of the membrana limitans externa .
Its outer end , in cones only , contains a spherical bead nearly colourless in the frog and blindworm , brilliantly coloured in the turtle and waterand land-tortoises , and absent from the common snake and Spanish Gecko .
In addition to this bead , where present , and the outer granule , the body contains an albuminous substance which in chromic acid preparations retires as an opaque granular mass towards the outer end of the body .
The inner end of the body is prolonged inwards , in the form of a pale , delicate fibre , which was sometimes followed through the layer of inner granules into the granular layer .
It does not appear to be structurally connected with the inner granules .
It is essentially distinct from Muller 's radial fibres , and bears a considerable resemblance to the axiscylinder of nerve .
That it ever proceeds from the outer granule associated with the rodor cone-body is doubtful , from the consideration ( a ) that where the body is large , and the granule lies within at some distance from its contour , the fibre is seen to leave the inner end of the body distinct from the granule , and ( p ) that the fibre appears to proceed from the outer granule only where the body is small , as in the frog , and where the granule does not lie within the body but is joined to this by a band .
-Ritter 's axial fibres are artificial products .
6 .
The " outer granules " are large , circular , nucleated cells .
Each cell is so intimately associated with a rodor cone-body that it forms an integral part of it .
7 .
The intergranular layer is a web of connective fibre .
It contains nuiclei .
8 .
The inner granules are roundish , in chromic acid preparations polvgonal cells .
They differ from the outer granules by their higher refraction , by the absence of a nucleus , and by receiving a deeper stain from carmine .
They lie in areolae of connective tissue derived from Muller 's radial fibres , and from the intergranular and granular layer .
They are more numerous than the outer granules , and consequently than the rods and cones .
9 .
The granular layer is a very close fibrous web derived in part from Miiller 's radial fibres , and from other fibres proceeding from the connective frame of the layer of inner granules .
It transmits ( a ) the radial fibres , ( / ) fibres proceeding radially outwards from the ganglion-cells and bundles of optic nerve-fibres , and ( y ) fibres passing inwards from the rodand conebodies .
10 .
The ganglion-cells communicate by axis-cylinder-like fibres with the bundles of optic nerve-fibres , and send similar fibres outwards , which have been traced some distance in the granular layer .
11 .
In the frog and Spanish Gecko the author has a few times traced fibres proceeding from the bundles of optic nerve-fibres for some distance in a radial direction in the granular layer .
12 .
Muller 's radial fibres arise by expanded roots at the outer surface of the membrana limitans interna , pass radially through the layers , contributing in their course to the granular layer , to the areolar frame of the layer of inner granules , and end in the intergranular layer and at the inner surface of the membrana limitans externa .
They are a connective and not a nervous tissue , and do not communicate between the basilary element and ganglion-cells .
13 .
The orderly arrangement of the several layers and their elementary parts is maintained by a frame of connective tissue which consists of1 , an unbroken homogeneous membrane bounding the inner surface of the retina , the membrana limitans internia ; 2 , a fenestrated membrane which holds the rods and cone-bodies , the membrana limitans externa , first correctly described by Schultze ; 3 , an intermediate system of the-fibresMuller 's radial fibres-connected with which in the layer of inner granules are certain oblong and fusiform bodies of uncertain nature ; 4 , the intergraniular layer ; 5 , an areolated tissue , open in the layers of outer and ininer granules , and very closely woven in the graniular layer .
14 .
No blood-vessels occur in the reptilianr retina .
