WE have been hitherto engaged in preliminary researches devoted chiefly to the physical nature of the sun , but we now propose to give a first instalment of the measurements made with a view of making the solar photographs taken at Kew the basis of a new determination of the sun 's astronomical elements .
Accordingly the present paper contains the results of measurements of the Kew sun-pictures for 1862 and 1863 , i. e. the heliographical longitudes and latitudes of all spots observed in these two years , together with a full description of the methods pursued in the reductions .
The results of the succeeding years , and their final discussion with reference to the sun 's elements , will be published hereafter .
In addition to those measurements which have reference to the heliographical position of each spot , we have also measured the area of each group on each occasion when it was observed ; and we conceive that in thus giving the position and area of each group we give all the information regarding sun-spots that is capable of accurate numerical expression , at least in the present stage of our knowledge .
leasurements made with the view of determining the fHeliographical Latitude and Longitude of Spots .
2 .
We need not again describe the measuring-apparatus and its various adjustments ; for these have been already described by Mr. DE LA RUE in the Bakerian Lecture for 1862 .
Suffice it to say that , in the photoheliograph by which the sun-pictures are taken , there is at the joint focus of the object-glass and eye-glass a system of two fixed wires , one of which is perpendicular to the other ; and consequently an impression of these wires is produced in every sun-picture which is obtained .
The nature of the measurements made will be better understood by supposing for the moment that this system of wires is in exact adjustment , and that their centre is also the centre of the sun-picture .
Then by means of the measuring-instrument the following elements are measured:(1 ) The diameter of the sun in the picture taken ( in inches ) .
( 2 ) The distance of a spot from the sun 's centre ( in inches ) .
( 3 ) The angle which the line joining the spot and the sun 's centre makes with one of the wires .
Sufficiency of Observational Data afforded by means of Measurements .
3 .
It will now be necessary to show that these observational data are sufficient for the determination of the heliographical position of the sun-spots .
As will be seen from the following general considerations , two elements are required for this purpose , viz. the angular distance of a spot from the centre of the sun , and its angle of position with reference to a fixed line , at the time of the observation .
It is perhaps almost superfluous to remark that our object is to ascertain the heliographical latitude and longitude of spots-that is to say , the angular distance of a spot from the solar equator , and also from a certain meridian of solar longitude , the meridian chosen being that which passes through the vernal equinox , and the degrees being reckoned from west to east .
Let PESW ( fig. 1 ) represent the visible disk of the sun , Fig. 1 .
of which circle T , the earth , is the pole , and let S ' be the P place of a spot ; also let WE denote the plane of the ecliptic , and let P and S be its poles .
In the spherical triangle PT S ' the angle TP S ' is obviously the difference of longitude of the spot S ' and the earth , while the arc PL S ' represents the north polar distance of the spot , and\ gives consequently the latitude .
But in this triangle we have the necessary parts given for finding P S ' and TP S ; s for the side PT =90 ?
, the angle PT S'= 90 ?
+E T S ' is the angle of position of the spot S ' , the side T S ' =the angular distance of the spot from the centre , which is given by the consideration , that measured distance T St the sine of the angular distance= s sdiam .
t sun s semrdiameter Hence we see that the observational data required for our purpose are , as far as the ecliptic is concerned , the measured length of the distance of a spot from the centre , and its angle of position , both of which data are given with the greatest precision by our measuring-instrument applied to the solar photographs .
2 To transform the ecliptical coordinates thus found into the Fig. 2 .
heliographical , let P ( fig. 2 ) be the true pole of the sun , A that of the ecliptic , which is represented by W E , while Q Q ' is the sun 's equator , and N the node .
Then , if S ' be a spot , the pre\ ceding considerations make known to us the sides S ' B and BN in the triangle SI N B , while we really require S ' L and N L , \ which are the true heliographical coordinates .
These , however , are easily deduced when we consider that in the triangle S ' NB cos N S ' = cosS'Bcos B N , cos S'N B cot N S'tan B N , and that in the triangle S ' NL the angle SNL'NB+ I , I being the inclination of the sun 's equator and the plane of the ecliptic ; therefore sin S'L = sin N S ' sinS ' N L , sin NL= tan S'L cot S'N L , which gives the required coordinates .
4 .
The principles of reduction here explained , however , have been considerably modified , and we have throughout followed the elegant and convenient method given by Mr. CARRINGTON in his volume of Sun-Observations .
The method being now adapted to sun-observations by means of photography , we have thought it necessary to give in the following pages a detailed account of it , and here take the opportunity to express our gratitude to Mr. CAIRRINGTON for the advice and instruction which he has kindly given to M. VON BOSE , to whom the first part of the reductions , extending over the year 1862 , was entrusted .
We have also adopted for our calculations the values proposed by Mr. CARRINGTON for the longitude of the sun 's ascending node , and for the angle of inclination of the plane of the solar equator and that of the ecliptic ( vide Mr. CARRINGTON'S Observations , page 244 ) , viz. I=7 ? ?
15 ' , N=73 ? ?
40 ' for 1850-0 .
The auxiliary Tables necessary for the reductions , which are given in Mr. CARRINGTON'S volume , pages 20 to 26 , were consequently recalculated ; but as they can easily be deduced from those published by Mr. CARRINGTON , by those who choose to adopt his elements for the calculation of the position of sun-spots , they are not given here .
Various Steps of the Process of Reduction .
5 .
We thus see that the measurements made are sufficient to determine , in the first place , the ecliptical latitude and longitude of a spot , and , in the second place , by knowing the longitude of the ascending node of the solar equator as well as the inclination of this to the plane of the ecliptic , to transform these ecliptical elements into others having reference to the solar equator instead of the ecliptic .
The first step in all this is to be able to trace on each solar photogram a line which represents the projection of the plane of the ecliptic-or , what is equivalent to this , to ascertain the position-angle with reference to the ecliptic of the wires depicted on the sun-pictures , and which appear as bright lines untouched by the chemical action of the sun 's rays .
If the wires in the photoheliograph could be so placed as to be always inclined at an angle of 45 ?
exactly to a parallel of declination , if the declination of the sun could remain constant-further , if the wires could be made truly vertical to each other , and the picture be taken precisely in the centre of te photoheliograph , then obviously the wire I. ( fig. 3 ) would make an angle of 45 ?
with the true north point of the sun 's disk , wire II .
of 135 ?
, and so on the readings on the circle giving at once the precise angles of position of the wires and of any other line drawn to the centre , reckoning from north through east .
These conditions , however , cannot be fulfilled ; and the following steps are necessary for obtaining the corrections to be applied to the observed readings , in order to deduce the true position-angles .
6 .
To find the true inclination ( p ) of the wire I. ( fig. 3 ) to the line NDC ( which is supposed to be drawn perpendicularly through the sun 's path , and joining its centre and true north point ) , the following method , due to Mr. CARRINGTON , has been adopted .
Fig. 3 .
, , , , , / % " , ,\./ , , " / A plate of ground glass is inserted in the chamber provided in the heliograph for the reception of the prepared plates for the sun-pictures ; and a bright image of the sun , and also of the black shadow which the wires throw upon it , in the form of well-defined lines , is seen on the plate .
The sun is , of course , observed running along it from left to right , the true north limb being the upper one .
In the figure the sun 's centre is supposed to run along the line EW , passing north of the intersection-point of the wires , C. When the centre has arrived at a point S , , such that the length of the perpendicular S , A , is equal to the radius of the disk , a contact of the disk with the wire will take place , the instant of which is observed by a chronometer .
There will be four such contacts , the times of which may be denoted by the letters Al , B , , Aa , B2 .
4 Neglecting the effects of hourly motion and of error of perpendicularity to each other of the wires , we have from the geometry of the figure , if we call R and 3 respectively the sun 's radius and north polar distance , BC S , Al R 2A BS S -15 .

From the results and by interpolation the magnitude of p is deduced for each sun-picture taken .

This , however , is impossible on account of the change in the sun 's declination .
It is clear that such a line , drawn through the centre and perpendicular to the sun 's path , will incline towards the west when the sun 's north polar distance is increasing , and towards the east when it is decreasing .
This deviation must therefore be applied as a correction .
If d be the sun 's hourly increment of declination as given in the Nautical Almanac in seconds of arc , this correction will be ( vide Mr. CARRINGTON'S Observations , page 11 ) d '15 .

The next operation is the rectification of the photograph by means of the wires of the heliograph depicted on it , and the determination of the error of perpendicularity of the wires .
For this purpose it is necessary to determine the position-angles of the wires ; for it is by means of these that we are enabled to find the angles of position of the lines joining the spots with the centre of the sun .
This part of the measurement is very easily accomplished by rotating the larger divided circle of the measuring-instrument on its axis and bringing successively the ends of the wires , commencing with I. , under the centre of the microscope , taking care that the image of the wire on the picture is exactly bisected by one of the wires of the microscope , while the other wire of the latter forms a tangent to the periphery of the sun at the middle of the indentation produced by the wire .
Thus four readings are obtained for the position of the four wire-ends ; and calling these readings in their proper order cc , 3 , y , 8 , it will be easily seen from 6 fig. 4 that they give us the posijion-angles and the error of verFig .

If N represent the true north point of our picture , obviously the angle N CA is the angle A+ ' , which has been determined previously .

Finally , since the true reading of the point A , reckoning from the true north line , ought to be exactly A+w_ while it was found to be 2~-_90o0 it is necessary to apply the quantity ( A++4 ) ( -90 ) with its proper sign , as a correction to every circle-reading , in order to deduce the true angle of position .

are , as seen in the above example , accompanied by the corresponding scale-readings of the sun 's periphery at the wire-ends .
They serve in the present instance chiefly as a control of the tangency of the microscope-wire , but will be of special use hereafter in an investigation on the sun 's diameter , which we have in view for a future occasion .

The necessary corrections to the measurements being thus supplied , each group of spots as it appears on the photograph is then sketched , as represented in the accompanying form , which fills the next two pages , and is an exact representation of that used by us .
The first page serves for entering the measurements necessary for determining the centre of the sun-picture , its radius , and the necessary corrections , derived by the preceding methods ; while the second page contains the sketches of the groups , indicating by attached letters the different members of each group , the positions of which have been determined , and then gives for each of these members all necessary elements of calculation in five columns , viz. in Column 1 , the distance of a spot from the periphery , in terms of the scale .
Column 2 , the distance of a spot from the centre , in terms of the scale ( r ) .
Column 3 , the distance of a spot from the centre , expressed as a fraction of the sun 's radius ( t ) .
Column 4 , the circle-reading corresponding to the position of the spot .
Column 5 , the true angle of position , reckoned from north through east ( east being left side of sun-picture)=P .
Even the smallest spots have in all cases been measured ; and in larger spots , containing several nuclei , the position of each nucleus has been determined .
The point chosen for measurement was always the geometrical centre of the figure of the spot or nucleus , as far as careful estimation could ascertain it .
Proper care has also been taken to 8 bring the centre of the intersecting wires of the microscope to cover the point to be determined , so as to avoid any error arising from the thickness of the wires .
The following form , which gives the complete measurements and data for calculation of two pictures taken on the same day , hardly requires , after the preceding remarks , any further elucidation .

We pass now to the second part of the reduction of the measurements , viz. the calculation of the heliographical positions derived by knowing the observed distance of a spot from the centre of the sun and also its angle of position .
This part of the work may be conveniently divided into the following successive stages .
As already mentioned , we have here entirely followed the method of Mr. CARRINGTON , who by introducing tabulated auxiliary values has condensed the two steps necessary for passing from the ecliptical longitude and latitude to the heliographical into one .
First , if r denote the measured distance of a spot from the centre , Fig. 6 .
It the measured radius of the photogram , and ( R ) the tabular semi\ s diameter of the sun in minutes of arc ; then , in order to express our measured distance in terms of the tabular radius , which required value we may call g ' , we have the proportion r ' : : R : ( R ) '=.(R ) ... ... . .
( 1 ) Now it will readily be seen from fig. 6 that O ' S ' is larger than 0 S , or that the measured distance requires a correction to deduce from OS it the value o-s for finding the true angular distance of a spot from 10 the centre=q .
We have from the figure r Ol SI Ot S ' = O ' B =O ' S =sin O ' S S'= sin ( g+ ' ) , or g+ g'=sin-aR ; hence e=sin- ' - ... ... ( 2 ) To facilitate the application of this correction the following Table has been calculated , which gives the logarithm of ( R ) for every tenth day of the year .

Next , let C ' EC ( fig. 7 ) represent the ecliptic , Q'EQ the Fig. 7 .
celestial equator , and P , P ' the poles of these circles .
Then if S is the position of the sun , ES will be its longitude= 0 , and the angle / S EM=- , the inclination of the ecliptic .
Now , if the angle PS P'= G represents the inclination of two planes c , passing through the line joining the centres of the sun and earth , and the poles of the earth and ecliptic respectively , then in the triangle ES M , right-angled at M , we shall have cos E S=cot SEM cot ES M , or cos O= cot w tan G , whence tan G=tan cos ( ... ... ... .
( 3 ) Similarly , if H be the inclination of two planes passing through the line joining the centres of the sun and earth and the poles of the sun and ecliptic respectively , we should obtain by a corresponding figure tan H=tan I.cos ( D -N ) , ... ... ( 4 ) where I is the inclination of the sun 's equator to the ecliptic , and N the longitude of the ascending node .
Further , let L be the heliographical longitude of the earth , Fig. 8 .
and D its latitude , then it will easily be deduced from figure 8 , in which NC is part of the ecliptic , NM the solar equator , N the ascending node , C the position of the earth , K the pole of the ecliptic , P the pole of the sun , that c2 11 L=NM , D ( negative ) =MC , whence , since MN C-I , N C=180 ?

( 6 ) These four auxiliary angles , viz. G , H , L , D , have been calculated for every degree of the arguments , viz. 0 for G , land ( 0 -N ) for H , L , and D ; and in these Tables , as mentioned in ? ?

Letter denoting the particular spot of the group .
The " heliographical longitude " is derived from the " longitude from node " in the following manner .
Taking that great circle through the sun 's poles , which at the epoch 1854'0 passed through the ascending node as first meridian , and assuming preliminarily 25'38 days as the sun 's period of rotation , this prime meridian will obviously again coincide with the node at the periods 1854*0+25d 38 , 1854-0+2(25d.38 ) , 1854+n(25d 38 ) .
A spot being on the sun at the time 1854'0 , the calculated longitude of which was found to be 0 ?
'0 , would be on the prime meridian ; but the calculated longitude of the 3600 same spot , a day afterwards , would be found to be 25814 ?
11 3"84 ( disregarding for our present purpose all modifying influences ) , this being its " longitude from node .
" To reduce this longitude to the true heliographical , a small table is necessary , showing at a glance the civil dates of the times 1854*0+265d38+25d'38+ ... .
For a sun-picture taken intermediately between two coincidences of the prime meridian with the nodal point , the time since the preceding coincidence is found by subtraction ; and calling this time T , we have obviously T. 360i longitude of prime meridian from node= 2538- ; and if the longitude from node of a spot be=l , its angular distance from the prime meridian , reckoning always from west to east , will be I-I ' , =the " Heliographical Longitude .
" 13 Measurement of the Areas of Sunz-spots .
13 .
The second part of the results of our researches published in this paper , exhibits the amount of spotted surface for every day on which a solar photogram was taken , expressed as a fraction of the visible hemisphere .
The information is given under two heads , viz. the area covered by the penumbra , umbra , and whole of the spots forming one group , and also the same values for all groups , taken together , which were visible on each day , thus enabling us to trace not only the behaviour , as regards increase or decrease , of every group , but also to express numerically the variations in the energy manifested by the sun 's surface from time to time .
WTe had previously published the area-measurements of the whole of Mr. CARRINGTON'S observations , and were induced to devote to his sketches the considerable labour which these measurements require , on account of the excellence and care with which they were executed .
But if , as every one will probably admit , these area-measurements are a more scientific representation of the sun 's activity than the mere numbering of the groups , it must also be conceded that solar photograms are a more trustworthy basis for such measurements than drawings , however carefully the sun 's surface may be delineated .
We shall therefore continue these measurements from year to year , convinced that they will afford materials of very great scientific value .
14 .
The method adopted for measuring the areas is to place a plate of glass engraved with a series of small squares in contact with the spot to be measured , and to note independently how many squares and fractional parts of a square were occupied by the umbra , the penumbra , and the whole spot ; if the number of squares occupied by the whole spot is equal to the sum of those occupied by the umbra and penumbra separately , then the observation is supposed to have been correctly made .
If , in addition to the measurement , we know the angular distance of the spot from the visual centre , we have the elements for ascertaining the area occupied by the spot .
This area we have expressed in millionths of the sun 's hemispherical surface .
It ought perhaps to be noted that we could not place the engraved square absolutely in contact with the collodion side of the picture , for fear of destroying it ; and it was therefore necessary to interpose the thickness of the glass plate betwixt the measuringsquares and the picture .
To obviate an objection to the process which might arise from considering that the engraved lines were not precisely in contact with the object measured , an experiment was made which showed that this difference of distance did not occasion a perceptible error in the determination .
The area of the square which forms the unit of measurement is o,0 of a square inch , the side of each square being 7i inch .
To find the mean radius of the sun-pictures , we took for each month of the year two photograms distant from each other by about a fortnight , and found their respective radii to be of the following lengths , expressed in inches : January 1-958 May 1-904 September 1'920 1-963 1*903 1-922 February 1-969 .
June 1P900 October 1-930 1-959 1-897 1-943 March 1-956 July 1-900 November 1-949 1-947 1-907 1-947 April 1P930 August 1-904 December 1-969 1-927 1P911 1-967 The mean of these gave us 1-9326 as the mean radius , which we adopted in the reduction of the areas measured .
The area of each square unit being -0001 of a square inch , it follows that , if r be the radius of the disk in inches , the area of the visible hemispherical surface will be 27rr , and in our pictures =2 X7rX ( 1*9326)2=-23-46734 ; therefore , at the centre of the visual disk , one of these small squares will represent a proportional area of the whole hemispherical surface , viz. 0001 1 -2346734.234673.4 while at an angular distance a from the visual centre the proportion will be sec oa 234673-4 , From this formula Table I. is calculated .
It gives in the first column the angular distances , in the second the corresponding distances in terms of the radius as unity , and in the following nine columns the number of millionths of the sun 's hemispherical surface covered in each position by 100 , 200 &amp;c. measured squares .
To obtain the required values for a number of squares between 10 and 99 , and between 1 and 9 , it is , of course , only necessary to cut off from the tabular values one or two decimals .
An example will best illustrate the use of the Table .
Let the measurement of a group , situated at a distance from the centre of 0-483 ( radius=1 ) , show that the whole of it covered 963 squares ; then , since 0-483 corresponds to an angular distance of 29 ?
from the centre , we should find opposite to this distance for the area of 900 squares ... ... .
4383 millionths .

for 60. .
292-2 , 300 , , 1461,. .
for 3. .
14-61 consequently for 963 squares .
4690 millionths .
The use of a mean radius of the sun-pictures in the above formula will not sensibly affect the correctness of the yearly amount of spotted surface ; for in our results the daily amount will be somewhat too small during the time of aphelion , and again slightly too great about the perihelion .
' But if for any special purposes the amount of spotted suirface were to be determined with the greatest precision , the actual radius of each 16 picture would , of course , have to be employed in the reductions .
The variation with the radius is as follows : With the smallest radius=1 897 in .

-Distortion arising from optical deficiencies of the Photoheliogaph .
15 .
The question how far the trustworthiness of solar photograms is limited by the effects of distortion , has caused us considerable anxiety .
We have for several years past made various attempts to arrive at a satisfactory solution of this problem , and we have decided that our final discussion of the positional elements of sun-spots for the deduction of the sun 's elements shall be preceded by an exhaustive investigation of the matter .
At !
present we regard our researches and their results as only preliminary ; but , on account of the importance of the subject for Celestial Photography generally , and in order to convince our readers that the subject is engaging our most earnest attention , we give in the following a short account of our latest steps in the matter .
16 .
It is obvious that if an image of some distant terrestrial object , which may be supposed to be of constant dimensions , is received through our photoheliograph on a prepared plate , we shall obtain a negative imprint of the object on a well-defined circular disk , which has been produced on the plate by the action-of the whole diffused light which enters the object-glass .
If the distant object be small , and placed in the axis of the instrument , it will also appear in the centre of the disk which has been produced , while if placed more or less out of the axis , it will also occupy a corresponding position on the photogram .
Now in all positions its dimensions ought to be the same , for we supposed these dimensions to remain constant ; hence it follows that if a relative change takes place in these dimensions , as determined by careful measurements of the same object in different positions , a distortion takes place in that part of the field where a change is observed , This principle has been made use of in the following manner .
The ornamental pinnacle of the Pagoda erected in the Kew Gardens , which is constructed of a number of rings of metal suspended in a horizontal position by vertical chains fastened to the top piece , was photographed by means of the photoheliograph in a series of twenty-five pictures , taken so as to bring its several parts into varying distances from the centre .
The pictures were all taken within a few days , in which no considerable changes could possibly take place in the object itself , and any effect of expansion by changes in the temperature of the air would not sensibly affect the measurements .
The distance of the Pagoda from the Observatory is 4398*24 feet* .
The figure of the pinnacle , as it appears on the pictures , allows us to measure.certain lines , produced photographically by its different parts , in directions which are perpendicular to one another .
On Plate I. , which accompanies this paper , all measurements of those lines which have the same direction are designated W W ' , i. e. along a radius W W ' , while those in a direction perpendicular to the former are designated " along the radius R R ' .
" All measurements were made with the greatest possible care by means of the Kathetometer of the Observatory , which reads to l 0oo of an inch .
17 .
Every line in the preceding figure being thus measured on the average about five times , so as to reduce errors as far as possible , the means of the measurements were taken ; and of those lines for which a sufficient number of measurements existed , so as to trace their behaviour across the field with some degree of certainty , these measurements were represented in the form shown in Plate I. ( A ) , where , however , only six lines are thus shown , although in reality for the behaviour in the direction W W ' ten distinct lines , and for that in the direction R R ' eight lines gave extensive data for our purpose , and therefore eighteen lines were finally employed for our mean results .
The mean radius of the disk produced by the whole light falling upon the plates was found to be 3'267 inches ; and this length was subdivided into seven spaces , giving 0'267 inch to the central portion , and drawing concentric circles at distances of half an inch from each other ; the central portion , having a radius of 0'267 inch , was considered as the centre ; and , from the means of the measurements as above indicated , the behaviour of every line was determined at the centre and at each intersection of these concentric circles with the two radii W W ' , RR ' .
These means are given in the following two Tables , which contain also the behaviour of each separate line , which we have called 1 , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. , each of these numbers representing in fact a different object .

The mean results are graphically represented on Plate I. ( B ) in three curves , which have the distance from the centre for their abscisse , while the mean length of the lines are the ordinates ; both coordinates are given in inches .
The curve W W ' shows the behaviour of all lines measured in one direction , the curve R R ' that of those measured in the direction at right angles to the former , and , finally , M M ' exhibits the mean of both .
The irregularity of the curve RR is partly owing to the circumstance that the number of observations on which it is founded is considerably less than those at our disposal for the curve W W ' ; and it is our intention to repeat the whole investigation under more favourable circumstances .
It is particularly our wish to place the determination on a more correct basis by erecting at a considerable distance from the photoheliograph a suitable scale of equal parts , which when repeatedly photographed in different positions , will in our opinion supply us with very correct constants of distortion .
A similar contrivance would be useful in ascertaining the optical distortion of ordinary photographic lenses .
In the meantime the following two facts may be regarded as established:-lst , that the image of any object photographically depicted is liable to a distortion , which varies at different distances from the centre of the field , and the amount of which may be determined for every instrument by methods similar to that employed by ourselves ; 2nd , that in our case the image of an object is larger when formed near the edge of the field than at the centre , and that the amount of elongation of a unit of length at the centre increases with its distance from the centre .
Taking the most trustworthy of our curves , W W ' , as a preliminary result , we find the following values for the unit at the centre , when it passes to other positions in the field , the latter being given in fractions of the radius : Distance in parts of radius , Corresponding length of central unit .

The present state of this inquiry is not sufficiently far advanced to justify us in applying corrections to the calculated positions of sun-spots on account of the effect of distortion on the angular distances from the centre of the sun .
The point will , however , have our careful attention when finally discussing the positions ; and we hope to be able to give thoroughly satisfactory constants for the effect of displacement by our Photoheliograph .
With regard to the correctness of the calculated areas , it appears from the above that the side of our square unit , being -01 of an inch at the centre , will in consequence of the elongation towards the limb be -0106082 inch at the edge , and the areas measured there will obviously have to be diminished in the ratio of ( -0106082)2 : ( '01)2 , and similarly at other distances , as seen in the following Table , which shows the numerical effect of the elongation on the values which we have assumed in our reduction for the square unit at different distances from the centre .
