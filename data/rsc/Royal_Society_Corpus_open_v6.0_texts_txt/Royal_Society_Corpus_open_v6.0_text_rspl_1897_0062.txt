Yesterday ( June 16 ) I received , from Professor Ames , of Johns Hopkins University , the results of an important investigation which has been carried out under the direction of Professor Rowland and himself .
An elaborate comparison of the thermometers used by Rowland , with certain standards supplied by the International Bureau , has been performed by Mr. W. S. Day .
This comparison has been made under conditions as similar as possible to those prevalent when the thermometers were used by Rowland during his original experiments .
A further most elaborate comparison has also been conducted by Messrs. C. W. Waidner and P. Mallory between a platinum thermometer , previously standardised at Cambridge ( England ) , and Rowland 's thermometers .
The results of these separate investigations may be regarded as in practical agreement .
The conclusions to which this prolonged investigation has led the author 's are so important that I take this opportunity of bringing them before the notice of the Royal Society .
Full details will be given when the respective papers are published in America , but in the meantime the authors have given me permission to communicate their results to this Society .
The following chart is a reduced copy of the one forwarded by Professor Ames .
It will be seen that the alteration in Rowland s values is considerable at certain temperatures .
This is rendered more evident rn the following table .

The point to which I now chiefly wish to direct attention is this the slant of Rowland 's corrected curve is almost exactly similar to that resulting from my own- experiments .
Hence the uncertainties previously existing as to the changes in the capacity for heat of water over the range 10 ' to 25 ' C. are greatly diminished .

This seems to show that Cathode Rays and some analogous Rays .
the difference between the value of the mechanical equivalent found by Rowland , and that found by Griffiths and by Schuster and Gannon , using electrical methods , may not be due to an error in the experiment itself , bat to some error in the electrical standards of resistance or of electromotive force .
" A happy result of this agreement ( arrived at by such devious paths ) concerning the changes in the capacity for heat of water , is that we can now utilise the results recently published by Professor Reynolds regarding the capacity for heat of water over the range 0 ' to 100 ' C. A hurried calculation indicates that if we accept Rowland 's corrected values , the mean thermal unit over the range 0 ' to 100 ' is in close equality with the " thermal unit at 19 ' .

( Abstract .
) 1 .
The size of the cathodic shadow of an object depends upon its own electric state , as already found by Crookes* If it is negatively electrified the shadow expands .
If it is positively electrified the shadow contracts .
The position , as well as the size of a cathodic shadow , may be affected electrostatically ; the rays which cast the shadow being repelled from a neighbouring body if the latter is negatively electrified .
In some cases the contraction of the shadow of a narrow object that is made positively electrical ( anodic ) may go so far that the luminous margins approach and even overlap , giving the appearance of a bright or negative shadow in place of a dark one .
The enlargement of a shadow when the object is made cathodic , and the diminution of the shadow when the object is made anodic , both depend upon the degree of exhaustion of the tube ; and both are augmented up to a certain point by raising the degree of exhaustion .
They are also unequal , the enlargement when the object is made cathodic vastly surpassing the diminution when the object is made anodic , other things remaining equal .
The conclusion is reached that cathode rays are capable of being deflected electrostatically , being apparently strongly repelled from a neighbouring cathodic surface ; and less strongly attracted towards a neighbouring anode .
Incidentally it was observed that two cathode beams from two small disk cathodes can cross through or penetrate one another without interfering with one another .

The electrostatic deflection of cathode rays by an electiitied object is found to be dependent upon the surface of that object as * ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1879 , Part IT , p. 648 .
