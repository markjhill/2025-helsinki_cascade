( Abstract .
) The structure of the egg suggested to the author the idea of its exerting electrical action .
This was confirmed on trial .
Using a delicate galvanometer and a suitable apparatus , on plunging one wire into the white , and the other , insulated , except at the point of contact , into the yolk , the needle was deflected to the extent of 50 ; and on changing the wires , the course of the needle was reversed .
When the white and yolk were taken out of the shell , the yolk immersed in the white , the effects on trial were similar ; but not so when the two were well-mixed ; then no distinct effect was perceptible .
Indications also of chemical action were obtained on substituting for the galvanometer a mixture consisting of water , a little gelatinous starch , and a small quantity of iodide of potassium , especially when rendered very sensitive of change by the addition of a few drops of muriatic acid .
In the instance of newly-laid eggs , the iodine liberated appeared at the pole connected with the white ; on the contrary , in that of eggs which had been kept some time , it appeared at the pole connected with the yolk , answering in both to the copper in a single voltaic combination formed of copper and zinc .
The auithor , after describing the results obtained , declines speculating on them at present , merely remarking , that in the economy of the egg , and the changes to which it is subject , it can hardly be doubted that electro-chemical action must perform an important part , and that in the instance of the ovum generally , i. e. when composed of a white and of a yolk , or of substances in contact , of heterogelneous natures .
