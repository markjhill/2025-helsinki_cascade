A paper was read , " On a new Register Pyrometer for measuring the Expansion of Solids .
" Part II .
By J. F. Daniell , Esq. F.R.S. , Professor of Chemistry in King 's College , London .
In this paper , which is a sequel to that published in the Philoso ?
phical Transactions for 1830 , the author prosecutes the series of experiments he had commenced on the dilatation of the metals : pursuing the comparison between the results of the experiments of Dulong and Petit , with those given by his own instrument .
He finds a striking accordance between them in the case of copper , as he had already done with respect to iron and platina .
He gives the result of some trials which he made with a view to obtain registers of uniform composition , so as to preclude the necessity of determining the rate of expansion in each individual instance .
The results of his experiments on the dilatation of the metals are given in tables ; the first showing in arcs of the scales the expansions of four metals from 62 ?
to 212 ?
, and thence to 662 ?
of Fahrenheit ; and their respective melting points : and the second , exhibiting the ex ?
pansion of certain alloys to the same points .
The experiments on the melting point of cast iron give a mean of 2768 ?
, and present a remarkable coincidence with the corrected temperature deduced from the expansion of a platina bar , plunged into melted cast iron , which was 2786 ?
; thus affording a conclusive proof of the accuracy of the pyrometer , and of its competency to determine fixed and comparable points of very high temperature .
The author accordingly thinks himself warranted in recommending the introduction of the instrument extensively in all arts and manufactures , where it is an object to regulate high temperatures , and where it is calcu ?
lated to determine many questions of the highest importance both to practical and theoretical science .
