Experiments to ascertain the Correction for Variations of Temperature , within the limits of the natural temperature of the Climate of the South of England , of the Invariable Pendulum recently employed by British observers .

HAVING obtained the rate of the invariable pendulum , No. 12 , in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich at the temperature of 63 ?
.53 in the month of August 1829 , as given in the preceding paper , the pendulum was laid aside until the cold weather of the winter season had set in , when the observations detailed in Table C were made with it , at the mean temperature of 310.15 ; the results of which are exhibited in the following abstract : Greenwich , December 1829 , and January 1830 : Experiments with Pendulum 12 .

85972.86 Comparing this result with 85969.33 vibrations at the temperature of 63 ?
.53 obtained in August 1829 , we have 14.25 vibrations per diem corresponding to 32 ?
.38 of FAHRENHEIT ; which gives a correction of 0.44 of a vibration per diem for each degree of FAHRENHEIT between 300 and 60 .
The experiments which I formerly made with two pendulums similar to the present , in a chamber artificially heated to between 80 ?
and 90 ?
, gave for the correction for each degree of FAHRENHEIT , respectively for the two pendulums , 0.432 and 0.430 , corresponding to that part of the thermometer scale which is included between 45 ?
and 85 ? .
Those results accord well with each other , and are somewhat different from that which is now obtained , and which correspond to the part of the scale comprised between 30 ?
and 600 .
But in the experiments in the chamber artificially heated , the fluctuations of temperature , in spite of every precaution , were considerable , and rendered the determination of the mean temperature more difficult , and probably less exact than in the natural temperatures : hence it would be unsafe to conclude in favour of the inference to which these facts would otherwise lead , that the correction at high temperatures is less than at low temperatures , or that the metal expands a smaller proportion of its length for one degree between 85 ?
and 45 ?
, than for one degree between 600 and 30 ? .
The experiments at Greenwich were made in those extremes of natural temperature afforded by the climate , in which a tolerably uniform temperature is maintained for several days ; a condition requisite in such delicate determinations .
The clock by GRAHAM was going well on both occasions , and its rate was assigned by Mr. TAYLOR from comparisons with the transit clock of the Observatory , with probably as much accuracy as the rates of clocks are ever obtained .
The thermometer is entitled , by its comparison with those of Mr. DANIELL and of M. BESSEL , to be regarded as one of good authority , having , in the absence of a standard thermometer in this country , received the sanction of what must be considered the best existing authorities .
Every precaution was adopted , which the experience I have had in obtaining the rates of pendulums has suggested , for maintaining a uniform temperature in the apartment .
The examination of the partial observations will best show the success of these precautions .
Viewing all these particulars , I regard 0.44 of a vibration per diem for each degree of FAHRENHEIT as a result obtained under circumstances of a very favourable nature , and as not likely to be surpassed in the confidence which may be due to it , until by a better command of artificial temperatures the experiments can be made to include , with tolerable certainty of determination , a greater difference of temperature than is afforded by the natural climate of this country .
As the many invariable pendulums which have been employed of late years by British observers have all been made of the same kind of brass , it is probable that the same correction for temperature will apply equally to all .
When , as in ordinary cases , the differences of temperature between observations designed to be comparative amount only to a few degrees , the probable error which may be incurred by employing the correction 0.44 for each degree as now determined , can only be very inconsiderable : but when the differences of temperature amount to 50 ?
, which is a case of actual experience in pendulum observations , the question of whether 0.43 or 0.44 , for example , be the more correct value , involves an uncertainty in the ultimate result of no less than half a vibration a day .
It seems therefore desirable , for the sake of experiments , which are becoming greatly multiplied , and which are daily increasing in accuracy , that means should be devised of obtaining the rates of pendulums in artificial temperatures , embracing a wider range than the natural temperatures , but capable of being determined with equal accuracy .

The Barometer employed was the standard barometer of the Royal Observatory ; the Thermometer was Captain SABINE'S standard thermometer ; the Arc was distant 60 inches from the point of suspension , and was divided into degrees , each of 0.8 of an inch in length ; the registered arc therefore multiplied by 0.764 , gives degrees of the true arc of vibration .
