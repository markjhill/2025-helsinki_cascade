A small , unicellular , green alga was noticed to be frequently present in sewage , and sewage materials , when these had been kept for some time .
The same alga was also found to have seeded itself in dilute ammoniacal solutions .
This somewhat peculiar habitat seemed to promise that something of interest might repay a study of the physiology of the plant .
On examination , under the microscope , it was found to be an extremely small , unicellular , non-motile alga , with a well-defined chromatophore , which latter contained a distinct pyrenoid .
The general characteristics of the alga pointed to its being closely allied to Chlorella(Beyerinck ) , * and I have provisionally placed it in that genus .
Chlorella vulgaris was originally described by Beyerinck as possessing either no pyrenoid , or an insignificant one ; Chodat , f on the other hand , has described the species as having generally a pyrenoid , and has figured it accordingly .
In a culture of C. vulgaris , obtained from Krai , I have been unable to detect a pyrenoid , and , since the alga here treated of possesses a very conspicuous one in its chloroplast , I have ventured to attach a new specific name , and to call the organism Chlorella pyrenoidosa .
Though in the higher forms , such variation in cytological character between the species of a genus is practically unknown , yet the same difference occurs between different species of Stichococcus , \ of Raphidium , $and of || all genera of unicellular green algse , showing very simple cell structure , and more or less nearly allied to Chlorella .
The peculiar natural habitat of the plant , and its appearance in ammoniacal solutions alluded to above , both pointed to a preference for ammonia in its nutritive fluid .
In fact , in one instance , this alga was found to have grown in a dilute solution of ammonium chloride , and it was thought worth while to make an estimation of the ammonia .
This was done by directly Nesslerising , and it was found that the ammonia had disappeared .
By distilling the solution with alkali , however , the ammonia was obtained in a roughly quantitative yield .

] with especial Reference to its Nitrogenous Metabolism , 459 The algal material also grew exceedingly well when stroked upon the following ammoniacal medium:\#151 ; 2 .
0 grammes NH4C1 , lvO gramme Na-iCOs , 0 .
5 gramme K-2HP04 , 15-0 grammes agar-agar , in 1 litre water .
The growth was , however , contaminated with numerous bacteria .
This evident ready assimilation of ammonia pointed to the possibility of the organism 's playing some part in the " purification " of sewage or further natural " purification " of sewage effluents , and its nitrogenous metabolism was studied with this view .
Mode of Preparation of a Pure Culture , The first step necessary towards a study of the chemical physiology of the alga was the preparation of a pure culture .
As the separation of algae in pure culture is not of very common occurrence , few as yet having been obtained , it may be permissible to describe in detail the method adopted .
The following methods were tried without success .
Sterilisation , as regards bacteria , was attempted by exposure of liquid cultures to sunlight , and hydrogen peroxide was also tried as a means of killing the adhere !
it bacteria , but the alga appeared to be susceptible also .
More purely bacteriological methods were employed , viz.:\#151 ; by stroking in great dilution over the surface of potatoes , and by " pouring " plates of ammonium agar , or ammonium gelatine , and incubating in sunlight , at a low temperature .
All these methods failed for one reason or another , but the organism was finally separated in the following way .
It seemed advisable to employ an ammonium-containing medium , and ammonium agar was therefore selected .
Plates of this medium were poured and allowed to set .
An ammoniacal solution was also made and sterilised , having the following composition : \#151 ; 0 .
5 gramme Na2C03 , 0 .
5 gramme K2HP04 , 0 .
1 gramme NH4C1 , 1 litre tap-water or distilled water .
This solution will in future be alluded to as " solution A. " A few drops were allowed to drop upon the surface of the poured plates , then a small portion of the impure material was added to the first plate , and the whole was brushed over the surface .
The same brush was then used to brush the liquid over the second plate , and so on , to six plates or more , without the addition of fresh algal material , so that a considerable dilution was obtained .
The plates were kept in the light , in as much sunshine as was possible , protected from dust , and in a damp atmosphere .
In seven to fourteen days , green growth was generally visible , and after three or four weeks , definite algse-colonies were to be distinguished among the colonies of bacteria .
In this way pure cultures of Chlorella were obtained from ( 1 ) Material of Ducat Filter Bed ( Hendon ) .
( 2 ) Sludge wash-water ( Leeds ) .
Miss H. Chick .
On a Unicellular Green Alga , [ Feb. 28 , This method may he relied upon to yield pure cultures , for it has since been repeated , and again proved successful .
The following is a fairly comprehensive diagnosis of pyrenoidosa .
Chlorella(Beyerinck)* very minute , unicellular , non-motile , spherical or elliptical green algae ; chromatophore single , parietal , with or without a pyrenoid ; cells isolated , showing no tendency to form colonies ; multiplication by division of the cell-contents to form a number of daughter cells .
C. pyrenoidosa ( sp. n.):\#151 ; cells spherical , 3\#151 ; 5 in diameter , sometimes attaining 11 g ; chromatophore single , parietal mantle-shaped , covering nearly the whole of the cell-wall ; pyrenoid conspicuous and single ( see Plate 8 , fig 3 ) ; reproduction by successive division of the cell-contents to form within the mother cell as many as eight daughter cells , which subsequently become free of the mother cell wall ( see fig. 5 ) .
Physiological characters.\#151 ; Showing a marked preference for ammonia and ammoniacal compounds ( e.g. , urea ) compared with nitrates in its culture fluids ; growth and multiplication largely increased by the addition of glucose to the culture fluids , causing the cells and cell-contents to assume a changed and characteristic appearance .
Chlorella pyrenoidosa resembles C. ( Krugerf ) very closely , both in its physiology and morphology ; it differs , however , in the possession of a pyrenoid .
This pyrenoid with few exceptions is very conspicuous , and can often be stained blue with iodine , being the only part of the cell which shows this staining .
C. pyrenoidosa differs also from C. vulgaris ( Beyerinck ) in many of its physiological properties , as well as by the possession of the well-marked pyrenoid .
Its morphology bears , however , a very close resemblance to that of a green alga isolated and studied by Kossowitseh .
S This alga itself resembled C. vulgaris ( Beyerinck ) and ( Nageli)|| very closely , and Kossowitsch decided to call it " Cystococcus , " in spite of certain small differences which existed .
It has seemed to me the wisest plan to attach the alga , diagnosed above , to the genus Chlorella , and to add a new specific name " pyrenoidosa , " although it resembles the Cystococcus figured and described by Nagel i , and it seems not unlikely that it may be identical with Kossowitsch 's Cystococcus .
C. pyrenoidosa grows exceedingly well , in pure culture , upon nutrient gelatine , nutrient agar or ammonium agar , and also in many liquid media .
In media containing glucose the growth is much # ' Bot. Zeit .

461 stimulated , and this is particularly rapid when grown upon nutrient agar or gelatine to which glucose has been added .
The liquid medium far excellence for studying this organism , is sterilised sewage , in which it preserves its normal form and characteristics .
In solution A , it also grows well , while if to the liquid a small quantity of glucose is added , the growth is much stimulated , and the individuals assume the appearance , described below , characteristic of growth in glucose media .
Accompanying the much more abundant development , the nitrogen assimilation is also increased , as will be seen later .
Glucose-containing media ( fig. 4 ) .
When grown upon media containing glucose , while the general growth is much improved , and the individual cells are also larger in size upon the whole , the green colour of the cell-contents is much paler , and sometimes almost disappears , while the chromatophore is much disorganised .
The contents of the cell appear to be segregated into a variable number of slightly refractile bodies , usually pale greenish-yellow in colour , which are apparently free in the cell .
If when mounted in water under the microscope , a slight pressure is applied to the coverslip , the cell envelope is easily ruptured , and these bodies are liberated , and float freely in the surrounding liquid .
The protoplasm also , in the case of glucose cultures , shows small granules , and the pyrenoid is no longer to be traced , but a certain amount of staining with iodine may be noticed in the granular protoplasm .
These changes closely resemble those noticed respectively by Kruger* in the case of his saccharophilum and Chlorella protothecoides , and by Matruchot and Molliardf in the case of Stichococcus when these algse were grown upon glucose containing media .
The results of growing C. pyrenoidosa upon media containing lactose or saccharose also resembled those of the above authors .
These two sugars appear to possess a far lower nutritive value than does glucose , while the algal cells preserve their normal appearance .
When grown upon ammonium agar , the growth is comparatively slow , the individuals appear larger in size than when grown upon ordinary nutrient agar , their green is darker and the cell-contents are of the normal type .
Quantitative Chemical Experiments .
The evident preference of this organism for ammoniacal culture solutions seemed to be a reason for studying its nitrogen assimilation .
The absorption of ammonia by algse is not a new discovery ; it is well known , from the researches of Letts and Hawthorn , !

On a Unicellular Green Alga , [ Feb. 28 , absorbs ammonia with extreme rapidity , and , consequently , will grow and develop to an extraordinary extent in sewage-polluted water , for such water contains a comparatively large amount of ammonia/ C. pyrenoidosa also absorbs ammonia in a marked degree , and this fact lends practical importance to the study of its nitrogenous metabolism , for it also may have some bearing upon the purification of sewage .
Although the organism is itself very small , and the absolute quantities it tackles also insignificant , yet the results of the following experiments , themselves upon a very small scale , tend to show that if C. pyrenoidosa were growing in great quantities ( .
, in the bed of a river polluted with sewage ) , very important changes might be effected in the composition of the water in which it grew .
The method of pure cultures was adopted in every case , unless otherwise stated .
" Pasteur flasks " were used to contain the cultures ; these were sterilised and then filled with the sterilised culture fluid by means of sterilised pipettes .
One flask was always kept sterile , as a control , while a second was inoculated with Chlorella pyrenoidosa .
The flasks were kept , often for months , in a sunny place , protected from dust , and in a damp atmosphere in order to prevent evaporation .
These Pasteur flasks can be obtained to hold 300 c.c. , and this size , when containing 150 c.c. of fluid , was found to be extremely convenient .
To see if the cultures and controls remained in a sterile condition as regards bacteria , they were tested , from time to time by abstracting a few drops and adding them to tubes of ordinary bouillon .
These tubes were incubated both at the ordinary temperature and at blood heat , and were watched to see if any bacterial growth took place .
The risk of contamination was found to be extremely small , and its occurrence very rare .
The figures in the following tables refer in every case to cultures that were successfully maintained in a state of purity .
It was found , in a few cases , as will be seen in the following tables , that difficulty was experienced in maintaining constant the analysis of the sterile control , when the experiment lasted over a long period .
In these cases it would seem as though the ammonia present suffered a slight volatilisation , but this does not vitiate the analysis of the corresponding cultures , because the changes in the control are , in all cases , insignificant when compared with the changes taking place in the inoculated fluid .
In such cases , it seems a fair procedure to subtract the change in the control from that in the culture , and to consider the difference as due to the activity of the alga .
Methods of Analysis.\#151 ; Samples for analysis were removed from the flasks under examination from time to time by means of sterile pipettes .
These pipettes were always carefully cleaned , plugged , and then sterilised by heating in a hot-air steriliser at 150 ' C. for one hour .
To protect them from any dust they might attract during this 1903 .
] with especial Reference to its Metabolism .
463 operation , their ends were fixed by means of cotton wool in the mouths of test tubes , and the whole wrapped in filter paper , and left so until actually used .
When the samples were removed for analysis , the liquid was at the same time tested for sterility in the way already described .
The culture liquids employed were sterilised sewage and sewage effluents , and also sterilised artificial liquids whose composition was arranged to resemble that of sewage as nearly as possible .
The sewage was usually allowed to stand for several days , then filtered , and afterwards sterilised by successive heatings at 100 ' C. The artificial culture media were the solution , A , referred to above , and also the same solution to which a small amount of glucose has been added ( about 025 per cent. ) .
The methods of analysis were those usually adopted in water and sewage analysis .
In the estimation of the free ammonia a small portion of the liquid to be analysed ( 3 to 10 c.c. ) was diluted with about 500 c.c. ammonia free water and distilled .
Three successive portions of 50 c.c. were distilled off , and the ammonia contained in them estimated by means of adding Nessler 's solution and comparing the yellow tint with that given by definite amounts of standard ammonium chloride solution .
" Albuminoid ammonia " was afterwards estimated by adding a fixed amount of " alkaline permanganate " solution , * distilling as long as ammonia came over in the distillate , and estimating these amounts in the same way .
It is possible that in some cases the quantities of albuminoid ammonia given in the analyses in the following tables may be slightly too low .
For , in certain instances , towards the end of the distillation , the ammonia came over , in the distillate , very slowly and in very small quantities .
It was considered more accurate in these cases to discontinue the analysis when these amounts fell below a certain very small value , since the error in estimating such very small quantities becomes comparatively great .
The presence of nitrates or nitrites was detected by means of diphenylamine - sulphuric acid and metaphenylene-diamine , while quantitative estimations were made by means of the " copper-zinc couple " method in which the nitrogen present as nitrates or nitrites is estimated as ammonia , f To allow for any ammonia that might have been originally present in the solution or introduced as traces during the analysis , a control estimation was always made .
This analysis was carried out in every way like the real one , except that no " couple " was introduced , and the ammonia thus obtained was subtracted from that found in the actual estimation .
The analysis of the cultures of this alga by these methods is by no * ' Volumetric Analysis , ' Sutton , 8th ed. , p. 512 .

On a Unicellular Green Alga , [ Feb. 28 , means easy , for the quantities treated are exceedingly small , the methods of analysis adopted demand a comparatively large margin of experimental error , and the length of time , over which many of the experiments must continue , is also a drawback .
The sterilisation of flasks and pipettes must also introduce a slight error where such small quantities of ammonia are concerned .
The estimation of the albuminoid ammonia is frequently rendered troublesome by the tendency of the liquid to bump while distilling .
It has been found that this difficulty is usually obviated if the ammonia-free water used for dilution is well aerated , and if , from time to time , small quantities of fresh aerated , ammonia-free water are added during the distillation .
The absorption of ammonia , as this alga grows in ammonia-containing culture liquids , is well shown by the results of the analyses in Tables I\#151 ; VII .
At the same time , the amount of albuminoid ammonia present steadily increases , and , on the whole , a fairly even balance is maintained , which can be seen by comparing the quantities of total nitrogen .
The evident preference of Chlorellafor its nitrogen as ammonia , rather than in an oxidised form , is seen from Tables II , III , IV .
In Table III an impure culture of the alga was allowed to grow alongside the pure culture , and it will be seen that similar changes had been taking place in the former , although they were not so well marked .
In .
the case of the pure culture , nearly all the free ammonia was absorbed in six weeks , a considerable amount of albuminoid ammonia was produced , while the nitrates and nitrites appear to have remained free from any attack on the part of the alga .
In the case of the impure culture less free ammonia was absorbed , less albuminoid ammonia formed , and some of the oxidised nitrogen present in the solution had been assimilated .
The presence of a small proportion of glucose ( 0'25 per cent. ) has a very remarkable effect in stimulating the nitrogen assimilation of the plant ( see Tables VI and VII ) .
In these two cases , cultures were started in exactly similar solutions , except that to the one set the above small amount of pure glucose was added .
In this case ( Tables VI b and VII b ) , practically all the free ammonia was absorbed , and largely converted into albuminoid ammonia in an extremely short time , when compared with the cultures grown in the solutions containing no sugar .
The glucose cultures showed evidence of much more growth , and the individual algal ceils were also much paler in colour .
It appeared to be a point of interest whether this albuminoid ammonia , so invariably formed in these cultures of Chlorella dosa , corresponded to nitrogenous substances formed within the plant cell and kept there , or whether such substances were formed , and then 1903 .
] with especial Reference to its Metabolism. .
465 allowed to go free in the liquid .
With the object of settling this point , cultures which had manufactured a good deal of albuminoid ammonia , were subjected to centrifugalisation , and analyses made of the clear solution ( see Tables VI b ( analysis No. 3 ) and V ) .
The clear solution in either case contained no more albuminoid ammonia than the control , proving that the elaborated nitrogenous substances were entirely retained within the cell body .
In two cases , however ( Tables VI b ( analysis No. 4 ) and VII b ) , older cultures were examined .
The word " older " is here used to imply that these cultures had passed through many more cell-generations , judging from the appearance of the growth and the size of deposit present .
In these cases , a considerable amount of albuminoid ammonia was found to exist in the clear liquids .
This seemed to prove that the algal individuals , under certain conditions , yield up to their culture liquid somewhat complicated nitrogenous matters in a soluble form , and a probable explanation would be that they exhibit this phenomenon when the cells are in a dying or dead condition .
This fact assumes a certain significance when it is remembered that the natural habitat of this alga is ammoniacal liquids , hence notably polluted waters .
The actual amount of assimilation and excretion is extremely small , and it would be difficult to assert that the presence and growth of such an alga as was of very great importance in nature .
But the effect of this alga , if present , would probably be to leave the water , in which it has grown , in what would be termed a " more impure " condition .
It is evident from the above experiments that the organism possesses the faculty of converting saline ammonia into albuminoid ammonia , which , under certain conditions , is discharged from the cells into the culture fluid .
" Albuminoid ammonia " is a name given to a certain class of substances on account of facts connected with their analysis ; these substances are quite unstudied , and , in this instance , may be perfectly harmless compounds .
But the presence of albuminoid ammonia to more than a very small degree has always been considered , perhaps without sufficient foundation , to show evidence of dangerous pollution , and hence to be most prejudicial to any water .
The formation and excretion of such compounds by a green alga appears to be a new phenomenon , and is not without especial interest in this connection .
An attempt was made to compare the ' nutritive value for pyrenoidosa of various nitrogenous substances , and with this object a series of nutrient fluids were prepared of the same composition as those used by Kruger* in his experiments with Chlorella protothecohles and Chlorothecium saccharophilum .

On a Unicellular Green Alga , [ Feb. 28 , A stock solution was made having the following composition:_____ Glucose 1-0 per cent. , K2HP04 0-2 per cent. , MgS04 0-04 per cent. , CaCl\gt ; 0-02 per cent. , distilled water 100 c.c.

2 .

Urea .
4 .
Uric acid .
5 .

6 .

Stock solution , without further addition .
Of these solutions , the cultures grown in those containing urea and uric acid were found to flourish exceedingly well , and by far the best , while of the others , the culture in the liquid containing xanthin gave evidence also of being very well nourished .
Uric Acid Culture.\#151 ; An analysis was made of this culture in the ordinary way .
In the case of the control liquid , it was found that no free ammonia was obtained , and comparatively very little of the nitrogen of the uric acid was yielded as albuminoicl ammonia .
It was found , however , that when Chlorellapyrenoidosa had been growing in the liquid , the yield of albuminoid ammonia was much increased , showing that much of the nitrogen of the uric acid had been assimilated by the organism and converted into albuminoid ammonia .
Urea Culture.\#151 ; In the case of the control urea-containing liquid , about 25 per cent , of its nitrogen was yielded , on analysis , as free ammonia .
In the case of the inoculated fluid , about 30 per cent , of this ammonia was found to have disappeared , that is , to have been assimilated .
After addition of alkaline permanganate , distinctly more ammonia was yielded from the liquid in which alga had grown than from the sterile control .
It is difficult to draw very positive quantitative conclusions from the results of the above two experiments , but it seems evident at least that this alga is able to assimilate with very great ease and without any previous decomposition the nitrogen both of urea and uric acid .
The former substance has also been found by other observers* to be a useful source of nitrogen for plants in certain instances .
In the case of Chlorella pyrenoidosa , however , these facts are of special interest , when it is remembered that the plant naturally grows in water that has been contaminated by sewage .

It appears to be generally true that most plants containing chlorophyll prefer the nitrogen of their food in the form of nitrates .
On the other hand , many observers have shown that certain plants can assimilate nitrogen in the form of ammonia , and in fact prefer it .
Of these latter experiments , many were not performed with the precautions necessary to prevent the access of bacteria ( e.g. , nitrifying organisms ) , and hence must be considered inconclusive .
Some , on the contrary , were most carefully carried out with every precaution , and among these may be mentioned those of Kruger , * who showed that his Clilo-rella protothecoides and Chlorotheciumsaccharophilum ( two algae nearly allied to Chlorellapyrenoidosa ) could both assimilate their nitrogen * Zopf 's ' Beitrage z.

475 when offered in the form of ammonium salts , while the latter alone could assimilate nitrate nitrogen .
Artari , * working with the gonidia of two lichens , isolated in pure culture , showed that , after peptone , asparagine and ammonium sulphate were the useful sources of nitrogen for these algae , and other observers !
have made equally careful experiments in the case of some of the higher plants , and have shown that not only simple ammonium salts , but also compound ammonias , such as methylamine , ethylamine , can readily be assimilated .
From a physiological point of view must be included in this second class , for it has been shown , as the result of quantitative as well as qualitative experiments , that this alga prefers its nitrogen to be presented to it in the form of ammonia or ammo-niacal compounds .
Among the latter urea , uric acid , \amp ; c. , rank high in nutritive value .
It would also appear from the foregoing chemical experiments that this ammonia , after being absorbed by the cell , is elaborated into albuminoid ammonia , !
a term used to describe certain nitrogenous bodies of ammoniacal nature , which yield ammonia when boiled with alkaline permanganate of potash ; in fact , almost all the nitrogen assimilated would appear to remain in this comparatively simple form , This nitrogen , for example , is more easy of attack than that contained in uric acid .
These elaborated nitrogenous compounds appear to be retained wholly within the cell body , but under certain conditions , only observed in the case of " older " cultures , they seem to escape from the cell , and can be traced free in the liquid .
The presence of glucose in a culture liquid frees the alga from the necessity it would otherwise experience of manufacturing carbohydrate for itself .
The algal cell , being thus relieved of a certain part of its ordinary work , appears to be enabled to reproduce itself much faster , and its nitrogen assimilation is also much increased , though , owing to the increased multiplication of cells , it would be impossible to say that the nitrogen assimilation per cell was increased .
The chlorophyll body of the cell , at the same time , gives evidence that its function has been interfered with by a most striking change in form and in the amount of chlorophyll .
It is distinctly noteworthy that neither cane-sugar nor lactose can be substituted for glucose in this connection .
The effect of glucose in causing a definite change in the chlorophyll body , and in generally stimulating growth , would not appear to be an isolated fact .
It has been shown by other observers in the case of three green algae ( Chlorotheciiomsaccharophilum , Sticho- eoceus bacillaris ) , upon whose nutrition the effect of glucose was * 'Bull .

[ Feb. 28 ' , studied in pure culturej tlicit there was a marked increase in growth when this carbohydrate was added to their culture medium , though no quantitative experiments were made to measure any difference in assimilation .
The general features of the assimilation of nitrogen , on the other hand , and its subsequent history displayed by Chlorella pyrenoidosa , may be a specialised characteristic of this plant , having reference to its continual occurrence , in nature , in waters which contain a comparatively large amount of ammonia , notably in sewage and sewage-polluted waters .
It is , however , impossible to express a definite opinion upon this point until the nitrogen assimilation of a series of many other plants has been studied in a similar manner .
