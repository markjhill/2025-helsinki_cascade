" Analysis of the Moira Brine Spring near Ashby-de-la-Zouch , Leicestershire , with Researches on the Extraction of Bromine .
" By Andrew Ur , M.D. , F.R.S. The water derived from the spring in question is raised by means of a pump from the coal mines in the neighbourhood of Ashby-de-laZouch , is much used as medicinal baths , and is also administered internally , principally as a remedy for bronchocele and scrofulous tumors .
The result of the analysis made by the author , is that it contains per gallon , grs. Bromide of sodium and magnesium .
8* Chloride of calcium .
851 *2 -magnesium .
16* -sodium .
3700*5 Protoxide of iron , a trace Solid contents .
4575*7 After removing from the water the deliquescent chlorides of lime and magnesia by the addition of carbonate of soda , he transmits through the mother liquor , consisting of chloride and bromide of sodium , a current of chlorine gas , till it communicates the maximum golden tint , and then adds sulphuric sether , which , by agitation , carries with it to the surface the bromine and chlorine , constituting a reddish yellow stratum .
The proportion in which these two elements exist in the evaporated solution may be ascertained with the greatest nicety by the addition of a solution of nitrate of silver ; the method of calculation for this purpose being detailed by the author .
