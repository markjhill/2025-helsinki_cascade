In a memoir on Skew Variation , contributed some time back to the ' Philosophical Transactions , '* I pointed out ( p. 364 ) that we might expect theoretically to occasionally find ( J -shaped distributions of frequency .
I was unable at that time to refer to any case actually known to me except Mr. Francis Galton 's curve of " con-sumptivity .
" The data in that case did not seem to me sufficiently definite to base any elaborate calculations upon them .
Quite recently , in studying Hugo Meyer 's 'Anleitung sir Bearbeitung meteorolo-gischer Beobachtungen fur die Klimatologie , 'Berlin , 1891 , I came across , on S. 108 , the table for the frequency of various degrees of cloudiness for the decade 1876-85 , at Breslau .
Although the method used for determining the extent of cloudiness is not entirely satisfactory , and , as Herr Meyer remarks , the observer must have had some personal bias with regard to the grade 9 , still the observations are so numerous , and so markedly ( J-shaped , that I thought it well worth investigating how far my theory of skew variation would suffice to describe such a novel form of frequency .
The observations are as follows :\#151 ; Degrees of Cloudiness at Breslau , 1876\#151 ; -1885 .
Degree ... ... 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Frequency ... .
751 179 107 69 46 9 21 71 194 117 2089 The total number of days of observation is 3,653 .
Clearly no cloudiness and absolute cloudiness are both maxima while the mean cloudiness will not be very far removed from minimum frequency .
The following data were obtained for the distribution by Miss Alice Lee , by the methods of the memoir referred to above :\#151 ; Mean = 6-8292 / 3X = 0'6112 / j-2= 18-2909 / 32 = 1-7414 H3 = \#151 ; 61-2030 6 + 3/ 3 !
\#151 ; 2/ 32 = 4-3508 = 583-1838 The theoretical curve is thus one of limited range .

Proceeding we found 6 = 0'00699 r O'17958 ml = \#151 ; 0-8774 \#151 ; 4-8109 m2 \#151 ; \#151 ; 0-9430 a2 = 5'1705 The negative values of mx and m2 show us that the theoretical curve has changed from its usual form to a ( J-shaped figure .
The range given is b = ax + a2 = 9-9814 , instead of the actual 10 .
The distance d between mean and mode d2--\#174 ; 1 2'0022 .
Thus the start of the range is 4'8270\#151 ; 4-8109 = 0'016 , instead of 0 , and it runs to 9-998 , instead of 10 .
We conclude accordingly that if the range of possible cloudiness had been quite unknown dpriori , it would have been closely given by theory .
The modal frequency y0 was found to be 50"7505 .
Thus the theoretical equation to the frequency is\#151 ; 50-7505 1 + \#151 ; V 4-8109/ V-0-S774 5-1705/ \ -O'9430 the origin being at 4*8270 .
The modal value now corresponding to a minimum and not to a maximum as usual , the name " mode " ceases to be appropriate.* The observations and the above curve are given in the accompanying diagram , and it will be seen that there is a complete transformation of the usual frequency distribution to fit the altered state of affairs .
With the asymptotic character of the curve , it is impossible to compare ordinates as giving the frequencies between 0 and 1 , and 9 and 10 .
Accordingly the areas of the curve between 0'016 and 0"5 , and between 9"5 and 9"998 were taken as the true measure of the frequencies of the degrees 0 and 10 .
These were obtained by means of the following formulae :\#151 ; Ai \#151 ; ( yob ) x nLni n2n2 w i ' I r 1 \ , \#171 ; a ( n\#187 ; +l ) / \#171 ; !_ ' ' ' 2 ( 3 \#151 ; nx ) \ b , ( Wj + %)ni+"a ' Cb ) 1 L l \#151 ; nx2\#151 ; nx \ 'bj A2 = ( yob ) x n"i w2"2 ^ / ' av\1-n2 1 f 1 | \#171 ; !

( Abstract .
) During their investigations on the nature of the occlusion of gases by finely divided metals , and in particular on the occlusion of hydrogen and oxygen by platinum black , the authors have had occasion to examine the behaviour of palladium to these gases .
The palladium was employed in three states of aggregation , viz. , in the form of ( a ) black , ( b)sponge , and ( c ) foil .
Palladium black , prepared in the same way as platinum black , contains 1'65 per cent , of oxygen , or , taking the density of palladium black as 12'0 , 138 volumes of oxygen .
It differs from platinum black , however , * The diagram on which the percentile curves are roughly drawn also indicates the amount of agreement by a histogram .
