On Myricin .
I HAVE placed the investigation of the Chinese wax between that of the cerotic acid and of the residue of the bees'-wax which remains after that substance has been separated from it .
By the saponification of this Chinese wax we procure , as I have shown , an acid identical with the cerotic acid from bees'-wax , and also the alcohol of this acid , so that the chemical history of these substances is closely connected .
We have moreover in the Chinese wax to deal with a substance found in nature in a state of great purity , the products of the decomposition of which by alkalies and by heat can readily be prepared and examined .
The knowledge of the relation of these products to one another throws great light upon the nature of myricin , which is not a pure substance , and the chemical relations of which are complex .
I have stated that the first extracts of wax with alcohol give with acetate of lead an abundant precipitate in a hot alcoholic solution .
This affords us a ready test of the presence of the cerotic acid .
The wax may be long boiled with alcohol before the whole of the cerotic acid is removed .
If however this process of boiling and decantation be continued , a time will come when the acetate of lead will cease to give any precipitate whatever in the hot alcoholic extract .
The residue after this extraction I speak of as myricin .
It is advisable to continue for two or three times the operation of boiling and decanting , even after the acetate gives no precipitate , the cerotate of lead not being entirely insoluble in the hot solution .
The myricin thus prepaired is a greenish substance of about the consistency of wax , uncrystalline , still possessing a slight smell of wax , and of a melting-point of 64 ?
C. This substance is hardly acted on by dilute potash .
It is however saponified by boiling with strong potash , and more readily by an alcoholic solution of the alkali .
The saponification may also be effected by mielting it with hydrate of potash , as in the case of the Chinese wax .
The products are the same in whichever way the operation be conducted .
If the soap from the saponification of the myricin be treated in the same manner as the similar soap from the Chinese wax* , it also will be found to contain two substances , an acid and another substance which is contained in the ether with which the baryta salt is extracted .
On attempting to purify these substances respectively by crystallization out of alcohol , ether or absolute alcohol , great variations in the melting-point both of the acid and of the basic substance will be observed .
And careful observation shows that these are not , as in the case of the Chinese wax , substances in a state of comparative chemical purity , but are mixtures , both in the case of the acid and of the other matter , of at least two bodies difficultly separable from one another .
It is the separation of these substances which gives a peculiar difficulty to the investigation of the nature of myricin .
Although the acid and basic products of the saponification may thus , as in the case of the Chinese wax , be separated by precipitation of the soap by a baryta salt , in the case of the bees'-wax these substances admit of a simpler method of separation , without which method , so difficult is it to wash perfectly out the batyta salt , that I question whether the substances could be obtained pure .
The soap , in whatever way the saponification may have been effected , and after the alcohol , if any , used for the saponification has been distilled off , is to be dissolved in a large quantity of water , and the boiling solution decomposed by an acid .
The melted mass which results from this operation , after having been irepeatedly boiled out with water , is to be dissolved in a large quantity of hot alcohol .
An abundant precipitate appears in the cold fluid from which the solution is to be filtered , and the precipitate repeatedly redissolved and recrystallized out of alcohol .
The precipitate will at length be found to consist , almost entirely , of the basic portion of this waxy matter .
The alcoholic solution contains the acid .
I shall proceed to give the simplest method by which the pure substances may be obtained , and those experiments which I have made upon their constitution , which I think can leave no doubt upon the mind of the chemist as to the true nature of that matter of which by far the greater portion of the myricin and , indeed , of the wax itself consists .
The first separation of the products of saponification may be made as I have stated , by combining the acid with baryta and washing out the resulting salts with ether ; the basic portion of the products may be obtained as pure by this as by the other method .
Melissin .
If the substance contained in the ethereal solution , with which the baryta salt is washed out , be crystallized out of ether or alcohol , the mnelting-point will be considerably raised , from below 70 ?
C. to above 80 ?
, by repeated crystallization .
The difficulty with which the maelting-point was raised , made it evident that the substances contained in the solution were to be separated only by long crystallization and a carefll attention to the variations of the melting-points .
I made various experiments to discover a satisfactory method of purification .
At length I found that if the ethereal solution be filtered while yet warm , and when only a small portion of matter has crystallized out , a substance remnains on the filter of a melting-point of 85 ?
C. of a satiny lustre , and of highly crystalline appearance .
It is with difficulty that 92 even a small portion of substance can be thus obtained , and it is necessary to use , during the filtration , a hot water apparatus to prevent the precipitation of the whole matter dissolved .
I have never been able to succeed in further raising the meltingpoint of this body , and therefore regard it as pure .
In this condition it crystallizes on cooling from the melted state , and its crystallization is marked by striie parallel to the line of cooling ; it being in all respects , but the melting-point , similar in appearance to cerotin as procured from Chinese wax .
I give this method of preparing this substance as it was the first I adopted , and as it can thus be procured in a high state of purity .
I afterwards however discovered the use of rectified coal naphtha as a solvent for these substances , and by far the best and simplest method of procuring the body is by crystallization out of that solvent , of the precipitate from the alcoholic solution which I have before mentioned , as procured by dissolving in alcohol the wax matter obtained by decomposing by an acid the soap from the myricin .
By alcohol the basic portion of the saponified rnyricin is separated from the acids .
By naphtha the substance of 85 ?
melting-point is separated from another and probably an analogous body , of which I shall speak hereafter .
This substance gave to analysis the following numbers .
The result is the same in whatever way the substance is prepared .

55'01 These analyses lead to the formula C60 { H455 02 ' Cln4.s C60 The products of the distillation of melissin are analogous to those of the distillation of cerotin .
The substance partly distils over unaltered , and is partly , with the loss of water , converted into solid hydrocarbon .
Sulphuric acid also combines with it under the same conditions as with the other wax-alcohol .
Palmitic Acidfrom the Saponification of M1yricin .
Melissin is soluble with such great difficulty , in every solvent suitable for washing out the baryta salt from the wax soa , p , that its sepalation fiorom the acid cannot in this manner be effected .
It may however be separated by simple crystallization .
The alcoholic solution ( p. 278 ) from which the melissin has crystallized out , after having been considerably concentrated and again filtered from any precipitate produced on cooling , contains hardly a trace , if any , of that substance .
The acids are very soluble in alcohol , and it is only on great concentration that they crystallize from that solvent .
The alcohol is to be distilled off to the point of crystallization , and the first portions only of the fat acid selected for the preparation of the pure substance .
The acid is to be boiled with potash , combined with baryta , and washed out with ether .
On decomposing the baryta salt with hydrochloric acid , a fat acid separates , having the appearance of nlargaric or palmitic acid , which latter body is in truth the prin.cipal acid of the wax .
It is however mixed with another acid of a lower meltingpoint , for which reason it is desirable , as I have mentioned , to use in its preparation only the first crystallization of the acid .
From this other body it is separable with the greatest difficulty ; but by long-continued crystallization from ether , an acid may be obtained of the melting-point of 62 ?

Distillation of Myricin .
The discovery of the cerotic acid rendered it evident that in order to obtain the products of distillation of myricin , and especially the acids in a state of purity , it was necessary first to remove that body and to distil only the residue of the wax .
I give the results of this experiment made with myricin .
The first portions of the distillate consist almost entirely of acids , the latter of hydrocarbons .
During the distillation a smell of butyric acid may be perceived .
This however appeared to me to diminish when the boiling of the wax with alcohol had been very long continued .
It is possible to effect nearly a complete separation of the acids and the hydrocarbons by distillation .
It is however not advisable to proceed in this manner , but it is best after boiling the distillate with water to saponify the whole by potash .
The soap may be removed by a syphon from the hydrocarbons which float on the surface .
Palmitic Acidffrom the Distillation of Myricin .
The acid , having been purified in the usual manner by washing out the baryta salt with ether , and the subsequent methods of purification , presents an appearance similar to the acids obtained by saponification .

Thiere are great difficulties in the way of obtaining even a sufficient quantity of this acid for the determination of its formula .
To obtain even a very small portion of it of which the purity may be relied on , it is necessary to operate on a large quantity of the impure acid : for the preparation of this pure myricin is required , free from cerotic acid , which it is not easy to get in any quantity .
These difficulties have prevented me making any further experiments with this acid , the identity of which however with palmitic acid , as obtained by FREMY and STENHOUSE from palm oil , and by STHAMER from Japan wax , is made out .

Melen .
It is well known that one of the principal products of the dry distillation of wax is a solid hydrocarbon .
ETTLING , who first analysed this substance 1l , concluded from its melting-point , analysis , and general appearance , that it was identical with paraffin , a hydrocarbon then recently discovered by REICHENBACH in the products of the dry distillation of wood .
The wax hydrocarbon has therefore borne the name of paraffin .
This substance was supposed , from the analyses of ETTLING and J. GAY-LUssAc , to be isomeric with olefiant gas .
Recently , however , this has been contested by LEWY , who analysed paraffin from various sources , and showed it , as he conceived , to contain a larger amount of hydrogen than had been previously supposed .
In truth the average of his analyses gave , Carbon ... 85'03 Hydrogen ... . .
14'87 99'90 numbers inconsistent with the old idea .
The question however is , whether M. LEWY experimented with a pure chemical substance , for which there is no guarantee .
My own experiments confirm the analyses of ETTLING , and the constitution originally assigned to the substance , to which theoretical considerations also lead .
But I cannot see any reason to believe the wax hydrocarbon to be identical with the paraffin of REICHENBACH .
This name of paraffin has been applied indiscriminately to the whole class of solid hydrocarbons , which have , or have nearly the formula Cm Hm , the identity of which has been taken for granted , in the absence of any true knowledge as to the chemical nature of the substances from the decomposition of which by heat they are produced .
The different melting-points however of these substances point out to us at once a distinction between them .

C. I confess it is difficult for me to conceive what substance in a state approaching to purity LEWY analysed from the wax having the melting-point he has given , since nothing is easier than to raise the melting-point of the paraffin from the wax to 56 ?
C. , although beyond this any change is effected with difficulty .
Cerin alone gives on distillation hardly a trace of this hydrocarbon , while it forms a principal product of the distillation of myricin .
The palmitic acid is separated by saponification , and the general preparation of the substance is the same as in the similar case of the ceroten from Chinese wax , to which substance it is closely analogous .
If the hydrocarbon from the distillation of the pure myricin , the acids having been boiled out with potash , be pressed out in a press between blotting-paper , it will have a melting-point of about 56 ?
C. This can be raised by further crystallization out of ether to 60 ?
C. The analysis of the substance in this condition shows the presence of some body containing oxygen , in addition to the hydrocarbon .

Owing to the numerous operations which are necessary before this hydrocarbon can be procured in a pure state , I have been unable to make further experiments with the pure substance .
The analyses , however , the analogy of this other substance and the mode of its formation , can leave no doubt but that it is the hydrocarbon of the wax-alcohol C60 H60 , to which may be given the name of melen .
The Nature of MlIyricin .
The analogy of the products of the decomposition of myricin by alkalies and by heat , to those of the Chinese wax and of spermaceti under similar circumstances , would lead us to suspect that a similar relation exists between the substances to which these products are due .
If , however , we take the numbers which have been obtained by analysis for this body , those for example of ETTLING* , or those of LEWYt , and attempt from these to reckon out a formula which shall give a rational account of these decompositions , we find a considerable deficiency of carbon .
I give one of LEWY 's analyses , with which other analyses of himself and other chemists are sufficiently accordant+ .

I have stated that the decompositions of the myricin are far from being so simple as those of the Chinese wax , and that in order to obtain either the acid or the wax alcohol , long and repeated crystallizations are necessary .
This at once led me to the suspicion that the so-called myricin was no pure chemical substance , but a mixture of two or more bodies .
-Subsequent experiment confirmed this view .
The residue of the wax , after the cerotic acid has been boiled out by alcohol , -melts at 640 C. It is but very slightly soluble in alcohol .
Pure , ether , however , will dissolve it without much difficulty .
It crystallizes out of this reagent in light feathery crystals .
The precipitate and the residue from the solution , evaporated to dryness , have different melting-points .
I succeeded in this manner in raising the meltingpoint of the precipitate to 71 ?
'5 .
This end may be more readily obtained by adding a small quantity of naphtha to the ether .
The following analyses were made of a substance of 72 ?
, which after repeated crystallizations was precipitated on the filter out of the hot solution , the filter being kept hot by means of a hot water apparatus .
I have not succeeded in raising the melting-point beyond 72 ? .
The substance is now highly crystalline in appearance , which the impure myricin is not , and of about the consistency of wax .
I regard it in this state as pure .

The crystalline appearance marks the purity of the substance , and notwithstanding the slight difference in the hydrogen , I cannot but regard it as the body C92 -192 04 , with the calculated formula of which , as given above , it sufficiently agrees .
I must add that the substance is separable with extreme difficulty .
The next precipitate from the solution forom which the above substance had been separated , had a melting-point half a degree lower , and gave to analysis rather less carbon , namely , C. 81-0 per cent. The greater part of the difficultly saponifiable portion of the wax appears to consist of the substance the analysis of which I have just given , and to which we may confine the name myricin .
We have , however , clearly some other body present accompanying it , the products of the decomposition of which by potash are to be found with both the acid and the wax-alcohol procured by saponification of the impure substance , which , as I have said , render extremely difficult the preparation of these bodies in a pure state .
I shall proceed to give some experiments which throw some true light upon the nature of this substance , although I cannot say that its history is satisfactorily made out .
The solution of ether or naphtlia ( p. 278 ) from which the melissin of 85 ?
has been separated , still contains a large quantity of substance of a similar appearance , but of a melting-point much lower than that of the melissin itself .
Notwithstanding however the differences in the melting-point , analysis shows us but little or .
rather no difference in the constitution of the different portions of this substance .

These analyses do not differ seriously from one another , and give precisely the numbers of the melissin itself ( p. 279 ) .
The numbers however are consistent with various formulae besides that of the melissin .
At 72 ?
the melting-point is extremely constant .
A portion of substance was obtained at this melting-point by repeatedly filtering the ethereal solution from the melissin which first crystallized out of the hot liquid .
A time arrived when there was no difference between the melting-point of the portion which first crystallized out of the hot solution and which was on the filter , and that which afterwards crystallized out of the fluid which had passed through .
The melting-point in both cases was 72 ? .
By heating with lime and potash , as in the case of melissin , this substance of 720 also affords an acid , which after the usual preparation , gives very different numbers to those of the melissic acid .

22-4 100'0 If we compare the numbers of this acid with those of the substance from the oxidation of which it was derived , we shall see that it is impossible to account for the changes in the same simple manner as in other cases of such transformation .
It would not be difficult to reckon out a formula that without great violence should account for it , but it is hardly worth while to do so , since notwithstanding the perfect agreement of the calculated and theoretical numbers , it is impossible to assert with certainty that either it or the body from which it is derived are pure chemical substances .
There is too great a difficulty in the perfect separation of the melissin to lead us to hope that it can absolutely be removed by the method I have given .
I failed in attempting to procure in larger quantities this substance of 72 ? .
The melting-point was very constant at 75 ?
, but on oxidizing a considerable quantity of this substance with limne and potash , acids were procured , which by crystallization were separable in the same manner as the substance from which they were derived , and the purification and perfect separation of which presented the same difficulties .
I obtained in this way an acid having nearly the melting-point of 850 , the meltingpoint of melissic acid , and also an acid with a lower melting-point than 77 ?
, but of which the melting-point was not so absolutely constant as to induce me to investigate it further .
I give however these analyses , since they unquestionably prove the existence of some other body in addition to the melissin , in the products of the saponification of wax , which by oxidation is capable of passing into an acid belonging to the series Cm Hm O4 .
Since it is only a pure body or a mixture of acids of this series which could give rise to the results I have given , and from the great difficulty of separation , the acid in all probability contains a very large number of equivalents of carbon , whether it have precisely the formula I have above given or not .
Mixed with the palmitic acid of 629 , is found another acid of a much lower melting-point , and which presents similar difficulties of separation from the palmitic acid to those of the substance mixed with the melissin from the melissin itself .
This acid is very soluble in alcohol , unctuous to the touch , and of a very low melting-point .
I do not , however , mean to assert that the other wax-alcohol exists in the wax in I !
DCCCXLIX .
P 105 combination with this unctuous acid , the presence of which is very probably due to another source .
This alcohol may possibly , as well as the melissin , be combined with palmitic acid , or it may be in some altogether different form in the wax .
Even after long boiling with alcohol , the myricin has a slight wax smell , and it is possible that this unctuous acid is the product of the action of potash upon the oil which is one of the constituents of the wax , and from which I have in fact procured an acid of this nature .
This oil , or rather grease , which was analysed by LEWY , is a very curious substance .
The other constituents of the wax are , in a pure state , inodorous and crystalline , and to it the wax owes its tenacity and peculiar smell .
I have made some experiments as to its nature , and procured from it also an acid and an unsaponifiable substance ; I will not , however , here enter upon the matter , hoping at some future time to resume its investigation .
I must not omit to mention , with reference to the bees'-wax from Ceylon , of which I spoke in a former paper , and which contained no cerotic acid , that it possesses all the general characters of the other portion of the wax .
Like the impure myricin , it contains more than one substance .
The wax itself has a melting-point of 650 ?
5 .
When digested with ether in the cold , a portion is taken up by the ether , and a residue left of the melting-point of 670 ; and , when dissolved in ether , if the ethereal solution be filtered while warm from the first portions of the precipitate which crystallizes out , a substance may be obtained , of the melting-point of 72 ?
, crystalline in appearance , hardly at all acted on by a solution of potash , but readily saponified by melted potash ; resembling in short in all its properties the pure myricin .
The products of the saponification of the wax itself closely resemble those of the impure myricin , and present similar difficulties of separation .
An acid may be obtained from it having the character of palmitic acid , and I have also procured from this wax the substance melissin , having a melting-point of 84 ? .
The analysis VI .
p. 279 , was made from a preparation from Ceylon wax .
I will sum up the results of this investigation by giving a list of the principal substances of which an account has been given in this and the preceding papers .
This table will exhibit , at one view , their relations to one another , and to the natural substances from the decomposition of which they are derived .

An intervening acid of the series , the acid C44 1144 04 , has lately been discovered by VOLCKER* in the oil of the Guilandina Moringa , and the investigation of the numerous class of vegetable oils and waxes will doubtless afford other bodies of the group .
Notwithstanding the many different properties of these substances , we find their chemical analogies constant , and the mutual relation of the acid , the alcohol and the hydrocarbon , is the same between bodies containing sixty as between those containing only four equivalents of carbon .
Through at least half the series , from thirty to sixty equivalents , the same physical type of fat prevails .
As a fat is doubtless but a soft kind of wax , so may not alcohol be but a very fluid form of fat ?
Alcohol has not yet been solidified , but one cannot help suspecting that when solidified it will appear as a wax or fat .
Direct experiment has shown us that in the body of the bee sugar is converted into wax .
A simple analysis of the two substances showed that the carbon and hydrogen were in the same ratio in both , and that the change could be effected by a simple deoxidation of the sugar .
Of the way in which this change is effected we are ignorant .
The true formula of these wax substances however shows that they belong to the very type of bodies which are the ordinary products of fermentation , and are connected with them by the strongest chemical analogies .
A new mode of fermentation produced butyric acid out of sugar ; might not another kind of fermentation produce wax ?
Until we know the nature of the whole of the ingredients of the wax , it is useless to speculate on the law of such a change .
Although the wax itself is no pure chemical substance , but a mixture of substances differing nearly three per cent. from one another in their amount of carbon , yet the analysis of the whole bees'-wax gives results showing in different specimens which I have examined , no difference of constitution which analysis can reach .
This renders it probable that the action is definite , and that the sugar in all cases loses the same amount of oxygen , although the remaining elements may in different cases be differently grouped .
