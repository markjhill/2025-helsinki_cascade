When the tail has been broken , however , it is reproduced with an investment of scales arranged in a verticillate manner\#151 ; a change which shows how small is the real value of a difference which has been deemed by morphologists to be so important a taxonomic character .
And here I would venture to make another observation bearing upon taxonomy .
The study of the processes of individual development are of course of great importance in determining the nature of the adult animal .
Nevertheless that importance may be exaggerated .
opisthodon is no less a Rana because it is never a Tadpole .
The outcome of the process of development is surely as important as the process itself .
Similarly with respect to the evolution of species , the lines of descent are of the highest interest , but if Professor Cope is right as to the diverse ancestry of the oriental and occidental then surely its importance may be exaggerated also .
The genus Equus is no less one geuus for having arrived at maturity along two distinct routes .
It seems to me probable that various other natural groups , which are commonly regarded , and I think truly regarded , as natural unities , have become one from various sources .
Should this view become generally recognised , , it seems to me that the idea of the tree of life will not serve as a basis of a really satisfactory system of classification .
Certainly no system could be regarded as satisfactory or natural which placed in widely different groups the two kinds of Horse referred to .
... In concluding , I beg leave to repeat my assertion , that all the teeth of the Ornithorhynchus are unlike any known Sauropsidan teeth , while nevertheless the totality of the structure of Monatrem.es , and especially the nature of their mammary gland , lend support to the hypothesis that they have become mammals along a different road from that which the higher Mammalia have travelled , and that they gained their teeth by the way , after they had separated off from the main Reptilian stem .
This difference of origin nevertheless constitutes in my eyes no reason whatever for not regarding Monotremes and higher Mammals as being all true members of the one class Mammalia .
