The experiments described below form part of a research which I began in the summer of 1897 in the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge , but was unable to complete before leaving Cambridge that same year .
The object of this part of the research , which was suggested by Professor J. J. Thomson , was to determine whether evaporation of an unelectrified liquid produces any electrification or not .
The liquid used was fused sodium and the arrangement of apparatus is shown in the accompanying drawing .
The sodium to be fused was held in a. vertical iron cylinder , A ,
