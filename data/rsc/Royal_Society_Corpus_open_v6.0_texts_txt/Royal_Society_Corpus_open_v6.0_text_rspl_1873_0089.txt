At the triple point v = v ' and p =p ' ; and M. Moutier further assumes that \#151 ; = \#151 ; , and therefore obtains by substitution dt dt and as \#151 ; is positive , being derived from formalje which have reference dt to the maximum tension of the vapour , and is negative , it follows that Q , or the latent heat of water , is negative , a result which shows that some of the premises must be false .
The erroneous assumption , however , is not the possibility of the existence of the triple point , but is contained in the equation dp___dp ' dt dt for Professor James Thomson has recently shown ( Proc. Royal Society , Dec. 11 , 1873 ) that M. Regnault 's experiments , on the whole , favour the conclusion , which he draws from theoretical considerations , that dJL = 1*13^j dt dt and if this equation be true , Q = AT j ( v - u ) 1-13\#151 ; ( v - u ' ) | ^ = AT | 0-13v \#151 ; 1*13 ; whence , as at 0 ' 0 .
, v =210-66 , while u and u ' difEer little from 0-001 , it is evident that for a temperature so near zero as that of the triple point , the expression within the brackets must be positive , and Q is , as it should be , positive also .

( Abstract .
) This paper is presented by the author as No. XIV .
of his " Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism , " completing the magnetic survey of the northern hemisphere ( of which No. XIII .
comprised the higher latitudes ) .
It consists of a very brief explanatory introduction , followed by Tables , in which ( as in No. XIII .
) the three magnetic elements are arranged in zones of latitude .
These Tables , which form the body of the work , are accompanied by three maps , presenting the results graphically , in isogonic , isoclinal , and isodynamic lines .
