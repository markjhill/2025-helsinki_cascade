It seems therefore , worth while to the following roposition : ositio ch not itself directly ?
) , bnt function o according to the Law of A itself ) inherited ccording to that Thus if we ] lectual and emotional characters to be ultimately a result of physical conformation , we may be certain that although we know neither the organs of which are a function , nor the nature of that function , still they be inherited according to the same that which holds for physically be the character in a parent , and ] it be an unknown function of the unknown physical organs . .
, or let : . . . . . .
Let denote the deviation from the mean value of the character in some special , and viation from the mean of any organ in the same individual .
if these deviations he small compared with the mean values of the organs considered , we have from above : . . . . . .
, where .
are constants independent of the individual variations .
Let denote a standard deviation , a coefficient of interorganic correlation , a summation with regard to all individuals with character dealt with , and let them be in number .
Then : ; or , where 2 denotes a summation the group organs .
Let denote the character in an individual who is the offspring of the individual of character , and .
the corresponding organs .
Then , if we do not suppose the nature of the function to have changed in a single generation , we have : , .
