Effects of prolonged The efficient cultivation of this field of research depends combination and assistance of an exceptional kind ; but in inKl# instance money must be available , and the members of the Institution deserve my especial gratitude for their handsome do !
tions to the conduct of this research .
Unfortunately its proseJ\amp ; t will demand a further large expenditure .
The handsome contribute !
made by the Goldsmiths Company ought also to be mentioned , very materially helping the progress of the work .
During the whole course of the low temperature work carried f at the Royal Institution , the invaluable aid of Mr. Robert Lem !
has been at my disposal ; and it is not too much to say that but r his engineering skill , manipulative ability , and loyal perseveran M \#163 ; reSfnt successful lssue might have been indefinitely delay ' My thanks are also due to Mr. J.

This implies a deterioration of the iron coi m regard to magnetic hysteresis .
The subject began to receu a en ion m 1894-5 , when some curves showing this increase i hysteresis were published by Mr. G. W. Partridge* The effe\lt ; was first thought to be due to a species of magnetic fatigue , resultin rom repeated reversals of magnetism in the iron , but it was proved b Professor Ewing early in 1895 not to be due to this cause ; + an was further shown by the experiments of Mr. Blathy and Mi or ey o e a direct effect of heat and to occur in transformers as i consequence o the iron being maintained for long periods at a com paratively high temperature .

The published results of Mr. Mordey , + and , later , those of Mr. Parshall , S deal with prolonged heating at temperatures which do not exceed 140 ' G At the suggestion of Professor Ewing , the author has been carrying out , in the laboratory of the Engineering Department of Cambridge niversity , some investigations which deal with a more extended range of temperature .

Heating on the Magnetic Properties of Iron .
259 l ady results have been obtained which appear to be of sufficient .
odty to warrant publication .
he hysteresis of the iron was directly measured by means of Piressor Ewing 's Hysteresis Tester , in which the work spent on a Mpjimen rotating in a magnetic field is observed and is compared u x the work spent in rotating standard specimens.* In these oxeriments the same pair of standards was used throughout for th calibration of the hysteresis tester , The test specimens were I cut from the same sheet of metal and were of soft Swedish msformer plate , having very low initial hysteresis .
They were lift tested in the annealed state and were then heated in small ovns which were kept hot by means of incandescent lamps .
The rnperatures of the ovens were observed in most cases by mercury tlrmometers , but those above 200 ' C. were measured by a Clendar-Griffiths platinum pyrometer .
The specimens were taken ) of the ovens from time to time to he tested , and all the tests ohysteresis were made at atmospheric temperature .
It was not fdnd possible to keep the temperature of each oven very constant , b when the ovens were once hot , the variation of temperature m rarely more than 10 degrees C. in either direction .
To these viations may be ascribed certain irregularities which will be iuarent in the observations , hut the general character of the \#166 ; \#171 ; nges due to prolonged heating is sufficiently clear .
Each specimen insisted of a bundle of seven strips 3 inches long , and about -f inch le , and each strip was annealed separately by heating it to redness i\amp ; Bunsen flame , and allowing it to cool in the air .
As the effects ( .prolonged heating described below were in all cases found to be * npletely removed by reannealing , the same samples could be used cxr and over again , and this was in fact done in most cases .

The effects produced by baking differ widely at different tempera-kes .
Below 40 ' C. the author has found no evidence of any ange .
Between 40 ' C. and about 135 ' C. the hysteresis simply creases with time , at least during the longest time of heating tried ' these experiments .
The increase of hysteresis is relatively rapid 'first , and becomes slower as times goes on .

Effects 1 per cent. The curves have been sketched by joining the obser.i points instead of drawing smooth curves through them , as this av\lt ; confusion of points belonging to different curves .
It was found however that at higher temperatures , from ab 135 ' C. upwards , a maximum value of the hysteresis was attaiii in a comparatively short time , after which continued heating cau l a marked decrease of hysteresis instead of a further increase .
1e initial rise at the higher temperatures is very rapid ; for exam ] the hysteresis doubles in a few hours at a temperature of 160 ' and reaches nearly three times its initial value in a few da Curve 5 of fig. 1 exhibits this case , the data for which are given Table I. After seven days of heating , the hysteresis of this sanij began to decrease , and in fifteen days it had fallen to tin its original value .
A still more notable decrease occurs at higl Fig. 1 .

Mr. S. R. Rogat .
Effects of prolonged It appears that there is a temperature in the neighbourhood ' 180 ' 0 .
, for which the maximum increase of hysteresis is great* With higher temperatures the hysteresis , although rising more rap ' at first , does not reach so high a maximum value and begins to 1 sooner and faster , tending apparently to a lower steady state higher the temperature .
An example of this is shown in curv .
fig. 1 ( temperature 260 ' C. ) , where a fairly low and nearly stay state is reached in the last days of the heating .
In this instance took the iron only about a quarter of an hour to reach its maxim of hysteresis , which was only 91 per cent , higher than the in : value .
Fig. 2 shows the earlier stages of the action for temperatu of 125 ' C. and over .
It will be noticed that the peak at which te hysteresis reaches its maximum in each case comes sooner the high the temperature , and that its height becomes reduced when b temperature is high .
The absolute values of the hysteresis in b experiments to which these curves relate are given in Table II .
It is probable that the attainment of a maximum value follow by a decrease is not confined to temperatures above 135 ' C. , and FiO .

Heating on the Magnetic Properties Iron .

order to exhibit the character of the change in magnetic erty , supplementary experiments were made by the ballistic od , using a ring of soft iron formed by coing up a long strip leet metal .
This was first annealed , and tested in the annealed n. It was then balced by heating at 200 ' C. , and cyclic curves ' determined in the usual way after the ring had become cold , results are stated in Table III , and are shown in the curves of 3 .
Curve 1 shows the initial state ( after annealing ) , where ralue of the hysteresis is 830 ergs per cycle per cubic centimetre t : 4000 ) .
Curve 2 shows the state after nineteen hours of baking !

Curve 3 was taken after further \gt ; ing at the same temperature for four days , by which time the ease of hysteresis is very apparent , its value having diminished 120 ergs .

There is nothing to show that when baked iron is left for # long time it recovers from the condition produced by baking .
f*ul in all cases the iron is restored to its original state of 1'^ hysteresis by reannealing .
Algebraic Functions and A .
267 u conclusion the author wishes to express his thanks to Professor ing for many suggestions as well as for the facilities which jq enabled the experiments to be carried out .
Subsequent to the writing of the above paper , permeability curves i re been taken , for a ring of the same material , by the ballistic , thod , up to a magnetic force of 25 C.G.S. units .
A comparison of ise taken before and after baking shows that the saturation value , the induction is unchanged by prolonged heating , for although the .her part of the curve , as in the case given above , was much \#166 ; ered , the parts of the curves above a force of 15 C.G.S. units are ictically indistinguishable.\#151 ; May15 , 1898 .

( Abstract .
) If u and 2 : are variables connected by an algebraic equation , they e , in general , multiform functions of each other ; the multiformity uii be represented by a Riemann surface , to each point of w ic \gt ; rresponds a pair of values of u and z. , Poincare and Klein have proved that a variable t exists , of which and a are uniform automorphic functions ; the existence-tlieoiem , iwever , does not connect t analytically with u and When the snus ( genre , Geschlecht)of the algebraic relation is zeio oi unity , in be found by known methods ; the automorphic functions required re rational functions , and doubly periodic functions , in the two case espectively .
But no class of automorphic functions with sinq y onnected fundamental polygons lias been known hitherto , which is pplicable to the uniformisation of algebraic functions whose genus i greater than unity . .
, .
The present memoir discusses a new class of groups of projective ubstitutions , such that the functions rational on a Riemann surface f any genus can be expressed as uniform automoiphic functio i group of this class .
These groups are sub-groups of groups gene-ated from substitutions of period two .
Groups are first considere which can be generated by a number of real substitutions op wo , whose double points are not on the real axis , and whose prot uc n a definite order is the identical substitution .
These groups are bund to be discontinuous , and of genus zero .
