( Abstract .
) This number of the Contributions of Terrestrial Magnetism contains the completion of the Mfagnetical Survey of the South Polar Regions , undertaken by I-er Majesty 's Government in 1840-1845 at the joint instance of the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science .
The observations themselves , and their provisional discussion , have already been given in the previous numbers , V. , VI .
, VIII .
, and X. of the Contributions .
The present number contains a general review of 480 [ June 18 , the whole survey , and is accompanied by three maps , which have been prepared , with the permission of the Hydrographer , Captain Richards , R.N. , F.R.S. , under the careful superintendence of the Assistant Hydrographer , Captain Frederick John Evans , R.N. , F.R.S. , one map being allotted to each of the three magnetic elements , viz. the Declination , Inclination , and Intensity of the Magnetic Force .
In these maps the Isogonic , Isoclinal , and Isodynamic lines have been drawn , by the author of the paper , conformably with the observations around the circumference of the globe between the parallel of 30 ?
S. and the South Pole .
The paper also contains Tables , prepared with a view to the revision of the calculations of Gauss 's ' Allgemeine Theory des Erdmagnetismus .
' They give the values of each of the three magnetic elements at the intersections of every fifth degree of latitude between 40 ?
of south latitude and the South Pole , and every tenth degree of longitude between 0 and 360 ? .
