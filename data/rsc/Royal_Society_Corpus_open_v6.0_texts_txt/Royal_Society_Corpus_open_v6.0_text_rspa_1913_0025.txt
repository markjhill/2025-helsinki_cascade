XXYI.\#151 ; The Disturbance of the Equilibrium in Solutions of Fructose by Salts and by Non-electrolytes .
By E. E. Walker , B.Sc. * ( Communicated by Prof. H. E. Armstrong , F.R.S. Received January 1 , \#151 ; Read February 13 , 1913 .
) One of the main objects in view throughout these studies has been to determine the manner in which non-electrolytes influence the course of change in solutions : it has been shown that they affect the rate at which cane sugar is hydrolysed ( XII ) ; also the rate at which urea is formed from ammonic cyanate ( XX ) ; and to judge from the behaviour of methylic acetate as a hydrolyte in comparison with that of cane sugar , it is probable that the degree of " hydration " of acids and salts in solution is lowered by their presence ( XXIII ) .
At Prof. Armstrong 's request , to throw further light on such phenomena , I have ascertained the effect produced by a variety of non-electrolytes on fructose in aqueous solutions .
The further study of this substance was desirable on various grounds , especially on account of the important part it plays in plant metabolism .
It is known to vary in optical activity to a marked extent , the temperature coefficient of an aqueous solution being larger than that observed in the case of any other sugar , viz. [ a]D = 0'*70 per degree Centigrade .
The rotatory power of the sugar in solution is decreased both by heating and by the addition of alcohol but increased by concentration , by salts and by acids ; it appeared therefore to be a specially suitable substance to use , as the course of any change could be followed with the polarimeter .
Little is known at present of the behaviour of fructose towards salts in comparison with that of glucose and cane sugar ; it was desirable , therefore , that it should be studied from the point of view from which these sugars have been considered ( X and XV ) .
Mr. Worley has drawn attention recently to the alteration in the degree of optical inversion which attends the inversion of solutions of cane sugar of different degrees of concentration ( XXII , p. 571 ) and has pointed out that probably an explanation is to be found in changes in the rotatory power of the fructose in presence of the acid .
The further study of fructose appeared to be of importance also in this connexion .
The material used was KahlbaunTs crystalline fructose prepared from inulin .
Except when stated otherwise , all measurements were made in Studies of the Processes Operative in Solutions .

The observations were carried out in mercury green light with the polari-meter and apparatus described in Part XXII .
It is commonly admitted that glucose exists in solution as an equilibrated mixture of the two stereoisomeric forms and it has been supposed that fructose also occurs in corresponding forms.* The change from the one isodynamic form into the other may be pictured as taking place in one or other of two ways ( R = CHVOH ) :\#151 ; C\#151 ; C I I OH EHC 0 / \/ XE 0 / \ HO H C---c + oh3 EHC C \ OH OH OH / \ HO H -OH2 || E EHC C\lt ; \/ xOH 0 / \ HO H C\#151 ; c I I OH EHC C\lt ; \/ XE O / \ HO H -OH2 c\#151 ; c I I EHC C\#151 ; E 0 HO C\#151 ; C + OH2 || E EHC C\lt ; \/ XOH 0 / \ HO H Whether , in the process of interconversion , the intermediate ( ketohydrol or ethenoid ) compound is ever formed in any considerable proportion must be left an open question at present .
Whilst the oxygen atom in the ring system may be pictured as in the plane of the ring in the one form of fructose , it is to be supposed that in the isomeric form , this oxygen atom is deflected out of the plane of the ring : hence it is , Hudson contends , !
that the one form is dextrorotatory , the other kevorotatory .
Presumably the two forms of glucose are similarly related : in point of fact , though both forms are dextrorotatory ( / 3-glucose [ \#171 ; ]d20 ' = +20 ' ) , the / 3-glucosides are all kevorotatory compounds , thus:\#151 ; / 3-methyl-glucoside ... ... ... ... . .

Mr. E. E. Walker .
[ Jan. 1 , To avoid periphrasis , it is proposed to speak provisionally of the one form of fructose as fructodextrose and of the stereoisomeric compound as fructo-Icevose rather than as a- and / 3-fructose .
Assuming that the active compound in a solution is the " oxonium hydrol , " in whatever way they are hydrated , to account for the difference in stability of the two forms , it is almost necessary to suppose that fructolsevose forms a more stable " hydrate " than fructodextrose , as the passage from the former into the latter is promoted by heating .
The fact established by H. T. Brown and S. U. Pickering that the heat of conversion from the ( / 3 ) kevo- into the ( a ) ( ?
) dextro-form is a relatively high negative value may be regarded as strong evidence in favour of this view , * thus:\#151 ; According to Hudson , cane sugar is resolved initially into a-glucose and fructodextrose ( [ a]D = +17 ' ) , that is to say , it is derived from corresponding forms of aldose and ketose .
Both forms of fructose and glucose undergo " mutarotation " at unimolecular rates , though the change takes place much more rapidly in the case of the former , f My own observations confirm those made by Hudson that the large temperature coefficient of fructose is due to a change in the proportions in which the two isodynamic forms are in equilibrium at different temperatures .
The same constant was obtained by following the course of the mutarotation in a solution which had been quickly prepared as in one which had either been cooled , then suddenly heated to 25 ' and brought under observation or had been heated and then quickly cooled to 25 ' before observation ( Table I ) .
Suspecting that the change in rotatory power produced by alcohol is due to a similar cause , a solution of fructose was prepared by dissolving the sugar in the proportion of two molecular proportions to 100 of water ; after a couple of hours , the solution was cooled quickly to 22 ' , then mixed with 35 molecular proportions of ethylic alcohol which had been weighed out separately .
The temperature rose almost to 25 ' ; it was quickly adjusted to 25 ' and the rise in rotatory power followed in the polarimeter .
Subsequently the solution was cooled in the ice chest , then heated rapidly to 25 ' and observations made as before .
The results are given in Table II .
The mean constants are practically identical : whence it follows that the change in rotatory power caused by alcohol is due to the same cause as that Fructose ... . .

From experiments in which alcohol was added in various proportions up to that of 50 molecules to 100 of water , the solution containing half a molecular Mr. E. E. Walker .
[ Jan. 1 , proportion of fructose , it appears that the change in rotatory power is nearly proportional to the amount of alcohol added .
The results obtained with various substances are collected in Table III .
As it has been observed in other cases that the effects produced by nonelectrolytes are not quite proportional to the quantity added , the calculated values given in the fifth column are not to be regarded as strictly comparable but rather as indications of the order of activity of the substances .

It will be noticed that the alcohols of the ethylic series , as well as methylal and paraldehyde , appear to have promoted the formation of fructodextrose ; phenol , cane sugar , fructose itself and sodium and potassium chlorides , so far as alteration in rotatory power is concerned , appear to have the opposite effect .
The question to be considered is whether the apparently opposite effects produced by the two sets of substances are due to the occurrence of opposite changes in the solutions .
* Taking into account observations made in other cases , there is reason to suppose that , as pointed out above , the effect produced by the alcohols is the same as would be produced by heating\#151 ; that is to say , they exercise a dissociating and " dehydrating " effect ; the fact that the activity of the alcohol is greater the higher its molecular weight and the less soluble it is in water is in harmony with this conclusion .
But salts and even cane sugar should also produce a concentrating and dehydrating effect , as they withdraw water from the solution ; it might , 1913 .
] Studies of the Processes Operative in Solutions .
therefore , be expected that the proportion of fructodextrose would be increased , not diminished as it appears to be , in their presence .
The mere concentration of the solution will account only for part of the increase in negative rotatory power ; but in this connexion , the question arises whether the negative increase which attends concentration should be ascribed to an increase in the proportion of fructolaevose present rather than to the formation of an increased proportion of complex molecules of higher negative rotatory power ; in any case , it is scarcely probable that the rotatory powers observed are those produced entirely by substances present in the state of simple molecules .
It is reasonable to suppose that , in the case of the salts examined , the change in rotatory power is in part , it may be in large part , due to the formation of compounds of salt with sugar .
It is well known that such compounds exist and a large body of evidence in favour of the view that even cane sugar will combine with salts in solution was brought forward in Part X of these studies .
The magnitude of the effect produced by potassium chloride in the case of several sugars is as follows , the values given being those observed in solutions containing a single molecular proportion of salt , half a molecular proportion of sugar and 50 of water:\#151 ; Fructose . .
410 ' Lactose ... 0-17 ' Glucose ... 1-33 Melibiose ... 0-31 Cane sugar ... .

0-04 It will be observed that the value is relatively high , not only in the case of fructose but also in that of cane sugar\#151 ; which itself contains a fructose residue , though not one derived from fructolaevose .
Taking into account the observations recorded in Part XY that / 3-methyl-glucoside is a more active compound than the isomeric a-eompound and that in presence of salts its rotatory power suffers the greater change , it is possible that fructokevose would be the more active and the more likely to combine with salts .
It therefore appears not improbable that the dehydrating tendency of the salt may be overcome by the tendency of the salt to combine with the fructose and that in consequence the salt may determine the formation of a larger proportion of fructolsevose .
Acids may be supposed to act similarly ; moreover , the peculiar behaviour of the acid-alcohol , phenol , lends support to such a view .
It was to be expected that this compound would behave like one of the less soluble alcohols of the ethylic series ; such is not the case , however .
It is only logical to extend the explanation here advanced to cane sugar ; it should be mentioned that the value arrived at in the case of this sugar is VOL. LXXXVIII.\#151 ; A. T 252 Studies of the Processes Operative in Solutions . .
based on the assumption that it retains its own specific rotatory power in presence of fructose .
If it be granted that the increase in the rotatory power of fructose on concentration is due to the formation of an increased number of polymerised molecules , it must be admitted to be possible that molecules of fructose can combine with the fructose section in cane sugar and that in this case also fructolaevose may be the more active substance .
It is hoped that it may be possible to throw further light on the problem and to test the explanation now offered provisionally by extending these observations and particularly by studying the behaviour of the methyl-fructosides in comparison with that of fructose .
[ It is obvious that if so delicate a difference as that which distinguishes the two isomeric forms of fructose can determine a difference in their behaviour towards salts\#151 ; and salts can therefore determine the formation of the one form rather than of the other , we are brought face to face with conditions of special interest on biological grounds .
It is to be supposed that the systematic study of such refined cases of chemical change will be of material service in enabling us gradually to interpret mysteries presented by vital phenomena .
The influence of potassium salts in particular on the formation of carbohydrates in plants and the special value of such salts in promoting animal metabolism are cases in point.\#151 ; H. E. A. ]
