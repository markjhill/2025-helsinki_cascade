" Remarks on the Soundings and'Temperatures obtained in the Faeroe Channel during the Summer of 1882 .
" By Staff Commander T. H. Tizard ; R.N. , H.M.S. " Triton .
" Communicated by SiR Frederick Evans , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received April 16 , 1883 .
[ Plates 4-8 : ] Introduction.\#151 ; The exploration of the Faeroe Channel commenced by H.M.S. " Lightning , " in 1868 , , under the direction of Dr. Carpenter , F.R.S. , the late Sir Wyville Thomson , F.R.S. , and Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys , F.R.S. , at the instance off the Royal Society* revealed a remarkable peculiarity , namely , the fact that over one portion of that channel the temperature of the water at the bottom differed 12 ' to 14 ' F. from that obtained at similar depths in the other portion , and further investigation by H.M.S. " Porcupine " in 1869 confirmed the observations previously obtained on board the " Lightning .
" The cause of this phenomenon appears to have been unsuspected at the time , but during the voyage of H.M.S. " Challenger " several such peculiarities were observed , though not to such a marked extent , and a theory was formed that where differences of bottom temperature existed at equal depths in adjoining , areas those areas would probably be found separated by submarine ridges .
Viewing the question on board the " Challenger " from our own observations , combined with those previously obtained in the " Light-ning , ' Porcupine , " and " Shearwater , " and with the advantage of Dr. Carpenter 's conclusions on oceanic circulation published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society " for 1869 , it seemed to us reasonable to supppse that in those areas where the minimum temperature was found constant from a given depth to the bottom over an area contiguous to another where the temperature decreased as the depth increased , those areas must be separated by a submarine ridge , as then the phenomena might be readily explained .
For instance , the condition might arise ( a ) if the minimum temperature was the mean winter temperature of the coldest portion of the separated area , in which case the water at the surface would be flowing in , whilst below it would be flowing out over the submarine ridge , as seems to be the # See " Proc. Roy .

203 mge With the Mediterranean and Red Seas ; or ( 6 ) the minimum tenmerature might be that which exists outside the separated area at Slowest part of the submarine ridge , in which case the water would be flowing in at the bottom over the ridge , and out at the surface , as seems to be the case in the Sulu , Celebes , and Banda Seas .
As the voyage of the " Challenger " was devoted to general oceanic research , it was found impracticable to spend much time over particular localities without lengthening the voyage considerably , and consequently there was no opportunity of testing by actual soundings the correctness or otherwise of this theory .
This seemed to be practically of very little consequence , as in the Faeroe Channel , close to our own shores , the same ; phenomenon existed , and a short time devoted to its further exploration would decide whether a submarine ridge there separated the two areas of different bottom temperatures , as was predicted would be the case in No. 7 of the " Challenger ' reports published by the Admiralty ; for , applying our views to the results obtained in the Faeroe Channel in 1868-69 , we concluded that , as m both areas in that channel the temperatures agreed fairly well to a depth of 200 fathoms , whilst at greater depths a marked difterence existed , we should find a submarine ridge across the channel with from 200 to 250 fathoms-over it , and that as-in the cold as-well as the warm area the temperature at 200 fathoms exceeded the mean annual temperature of the 60th parallel of latitude , the whole body of the water was moving steadily to the north-eastward over the ridge .
The late Sir Wyville Thomson considered the Faeroe Channel as a test question , and consequently represented to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty ( Sir F. J. Evans , R.N. , K.C.B. , F.R.S. ) , in 1880 , e desirability of despatching a small vessel to obtain some soundings and other observations in this locality .
The Hydrographer aving recommended this project to the favourable consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty , their Lordships sanctioned the small hired surveying vessel " Knight Errant ' ( employed on the west coas s of the United Kingdom ) being sent to the Faeroe Channel , and during the month of August , 1880 , a sufficient number of soundings and temperature observations were obtained to show that a submarine ridge existed , though the* actual extent of the ridge was not mined .
A full account of the results obtained in the " Knight Errant was published in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh/ ' session 1881\#151 ; 82 . .
The existence of a submarine ridge having been ascertained , ir Wyville Thomson represented to the Royal Society the advisability of more thoroughly investigating it by a series of cross-sections to determine the slopes on each side , and to ascertain with greater exactness the limit of the cold area and the nature of the bottom on t is ridge .
The Royal Society recommended Sir Wyville 's views to the 204 Staff Commander T. H. Tizardi [ May I# favourable consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Admirals but their Lordships , whilst agreeing that the exploration of the Faero* Channel was very important , were unable to spare a vessel for th purpose during the summer of 1881 , and , unfortunately , before th !
end of that year Sir Wyville , whose health had been undermined by exposure to the vicissitudes of climate during the voyage of the Challenger , succumbed to a severe illness without being able to complete either the report of the voyage of the " Challenger " or the many investigations he had undertaken as bearing more or less on that voyage .
Shortly after the death of Sir Wyville , Mr. John Murray one of the naturalists of the " Challenger " expedition , was selected to succeed him as the editor of the " Challenger " Reports , and , as he had accompanied the " Knight Errant * ' in her cruise to the Faeroe Channel in 1880 , and was also of opinion that the exploration of that channel bore directly on the results of the voyage of the " Challenger , " he again brought before the Royal Society the desirability for further investigating this submarine ridge , and at their instance the Hydrographer , with the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty ' directed H.M.S. " Triton " to carry out this work , and Mr. Murray embarked in that vessel to assist in making the necessary obser- , vations .
^ Equipment.\#151 ; The " Triton " being the surveying vessel newly fitted to take the place of the " Porcupine " on the south and east coasts of the United Kingdom , had every appliance on board necessary for the work , with the exception of dredges , trawls , and dredging line .
Some dredges remaining from the stock returned b/ the " Challenger " were found available , and .
the Royal Society provided the trawls and necessary rope .
All the instruments were of the- pattern used in the Challenger expedition excepting one deep-sea thermometer which was an improvement on the ordinary type in use by Mr. Buchanan .
Narrative.\#151 ; The " Triton " arrived at Stornoway on the 25th July , and between that date and the 4th September , made three trips to the Faeroe Channel , each trip being about ten days ' duration .
Notwithstanding the generally unfavourable condition of the weather experienced , five sectional lines of soundings were obtained across the ridge ( which has been named after the late Sir Wyville Thomson ) , and numerous other soundings between these sectional lines , making a total of 135 soundings , 14 serial temperature soundings , and 17 hauls of the dredge or trawl.* The work of sounding and obtaining temperatures was proceeded with steadily on every occasion when the weather was sufficiently clear to admit of the position of the soundings being ascertained by astronomical observation ; during misty or foggy # See table , plan , and diagrams attached .

After completing the work in the Faeroe Channel the vessel left qfornowav for Oban , and from thence proceeded into the Atlantic limit 100 miles north-west of Ireland , to test some pressure gauges m connexion with the observations of Professor Tait on the thermometers of the " Challenger , " for which purpose Professor Crystal , of the University of Edinburgh , accompanied the ship on this section of the v0 aCre The " Triton " finally returned to Glasgow on the 1/ th September , and then resumed her ordinary surveying work .
^ The Wyville Thomson ridge.\#151 ; The soundings obtained in the Triton , combined with those formerly taken in the " Knight Errant/ ' prove conclusively the existence of a submarine ridge m the Faeroe Channel , extending from the edge of the hank north of Rona Island to the fishing bank to the south-west of the Faeroe Islands .
To the northeast of this ridge , the temperature of the water at depths exceed-W 350 fathoms is under 32 ' F. , whilst to the south-west of it the temperature at similar depths is above 42 ' F. , excepting m one part , where , for a short distance south-west of the deepest part o e ridge a drain of the Arctic water is carried across , and is sufficient to cool the bottom water below 40 ' for a distance of 8 miles from the axis of the ridge .
, .
, .
The general depths over the Wyville Thomson ridge which is 100 miles in length , by 10 in width , are from 250 to 280 fathoms , with here and there shoaler heads .
In one part , however there is a saddle or gap 7 miles wide , where the depths are from 300 to fathoms .
On each side of the ridge the depths increase to 600 fathoms or upwards . .
The indications given by the lead as well as the dredge and trawl , show that the Wyville Thomson ridge consists of stones and gravel , whilst to the north-east of the ridge , in the cold area , the bottom is o a hard blue mud , and to the south-west a softer gray mud .
The ridge seems to he a portion of a chain of hills , mostly submerged , which stretch irregularly from the bank off the north-wes coast of Scotland to the Faeroe Islands , Iceland , and Greenland , tor we know that depths of about 200 fathoms exists between the Faeroe Islands and Iceland , as well as between Iceland and Greenland .
As oceanic soundings become more numerous , doubtless many moi e sue l chains of submarine elevations will be discovered , for there is reason to believe that the floor of the ocean is not so level as is generally supposed .
The absence of mud on the top of the Wyville Thomson ridge may be accounted for by the water flowing over it , washing away all the small particles .
Plans and Diagrams.\#151 ; To show the position and form of the ridge , a series of diagrams and a plan have been constructed .
The plans s io\\ s 206 Staff Commander T. H. Tizard .
[ May all the soundings obtained , as well as the position of the five sectional lines across the ridge , and the line of demarcation between the coli and warm areas , for which purpose the isotherm of 40 ' has bee selected as the best distinctive mark .
The diagrams show the temperature curves , and a profile of each section exhibiting the form of* the ridge , and the distribution of temperature from the surface to the bottom .
The diagrams all appear to point to the same conclusion , thus agreeing with theory , namely , that the water is flowing steadily to the north-east over the ridge .
For instance , in Plate 7 , Section A , it will be seen that the^ curves of temperature begin to diverge rapidly below the depth of 170 fathoms , and by referring to Plate '5 , Section A it will be seen that the least depth over the ridge on this section is 120 fathoms .
In Plate 7 , Section B , it will be seen that the curves taken in the warm area and on the ridge , agree very closely , whilst that taken in the cold area , 10 miles north-east of the shortest cast obtained on this section , 260 fathoms , begins to diverge rapidly at 200 fathoms from the other two curves .
In Plate7 , Section C , curves taken in the warm and cold areas are sensibly the same to the depth of 800 fathoms , and a reference to Plate 5 , Section G , will show that on this section the least depth found on the ridge was 305 fathoms .
In sections B , D , and E , where the least water on the ridge is much the same , the isotherm of 40 ' on each section at a distance of 10 miles from the axis of the ridge , is found at almost precisely the same depth , viz. , 280 fathoms , or the precise depth of the ridge , whereas in Section C , where the depth of the axis of the ridge is 305 fathoms , the isotherm of .
40 ' is found at a depth of 300 fathoms in the cold area , and in Section A , where the depth on the axis of the ridge is 120 fathoms , the isotherm of 40 ' is at a depth of 250 fathoms in the cold area .
The depth then at which the isotherm of 40 ' is found in the cold area depends on the depth over the ridge .
As before mentioned , in the warm area , all the temperatures exceed 40 ' .
The question then arises , if the water is flowing steadily over the Wyville Thomson ridge to the north-east , how is it the water at the bottom in the cold area retains its low temperature ?
This has hitherto been very difficult of explanation , as there was apparently no outlet for it over the ridge , and consequently we might expect that its temperature would be influenced by the mass of heated water above ; for the excess of inflow in the Faeroe Channel might be altogether absorbed by the outflow , Which we 'know is constantly in progress between Iceland and Greenland .
The soundings and temperatures taken this year , however , led to the discovery of a slight outflow of the cold Arctic water over the deepest part of the Wyville Thomson ridge , in the 7-mile gap , which breaks the continuity of the 300 fathom contour-line of soundings .
Here the cold water was 1883 ] Soundings and Temperatures the Faeroe Channel .
207 irom the axis of the ridge , it was of the usual normal temperature of , uWorm .
area in that locality .
This outflow of cold water seems to affect all the bottom tempera- , oa to the westward of Section C ; for , whilst to the eastward of hat section they are from 45 " to 46 " at depths of 500 fathoms , to the westward they L from 42 " to 43 " , that is 3 " lower There is then apparently a regular interchange of the waters across the Wvville Thomson ridge , the Atlantic water flowing north-east into the Arctic basin on the surface , and as far down as the ridge permits , over the greatest portion , whilst over the deepest part of the ridge there is a small outflow of Arctic water into the Atlantic , which although of infinitely less volume than the water moving to e east , vet appears to be sufficient to enable the bottom water of the Arctic basin , immediately adjacent to the ridge , to retain its low temperature .
Were there no other outlet to the Arctic basin it is probable the outflow over the ridge at the bottom would equal the inflow at the surface , but , as before remarked , we know the surface water on the western side of the Arctic basin has a steady flow to the southwards along the coast of Greenland . . .
... The existence of the Wyville -Thomson ridge m the locality predicted , tends to prove the general correctness of the theory formed m the " Challenger , " but farther observations m other localities where the same phenomenon exists , are requisite to determine its absolu e correctness , more especially when we remember that in nearly every instance where the bottom temperatures differ materially m adjoining areas , the minimum rtemperature in one of those areas , the warm , is found at a considerable height from \#171 ; the bottom .
, w ereas m e o area , the cold , the temperature decreases with the depth , the minimum being at the bottom .
In the Faeroe Channel , however , the temperature in the warm area decreases as the depth increases , whilst in the cold area it remains almost constant at 30^ ' F. at depths excee mg 350 fathoms , thus reversing the rule which obtains elsewhere .
or instance , in the Mediterranean the temperature of the sea is constan at 55 ' F. at depths exceeding 100 fathoms , whereas m the Atlantic , the only sea in communication with , the Mediterranean , the tempe ture outside the Straits of Gibraltar decreases as the depth inc In the Red Sea the ..temperature is constant at 70 ' F. , at dept s exceeding 100 fathoms , whereas in the Indian Ocean it decreases with the depth .
In the Sulu Sea the temperature is constant at 50 5 .
at depths exceeding 400 fathoms , whereas in the adjacent seas temperature decreases to 39 ' , and there are also considerable area the Atlantic , as well as the Pacific , where a minimum temperature is reached at a certain depth , whilst in adjoining areas the temperature 208 Staff Commander T. H. Tizard .
' [ May 1W either decreases to the bottom , or a lower temperature is found n+ similar depth These differences , though slight , give reason f * believing that the flow of water from the Antarctic is impeded h submarine ridges .
The Arctic water is apparently quite cut off from the general oceanic circulation , excepting at the surface , and to \#187 ; depth of 200 fathoms .
Tides.\#151 ; When the weather was favourable , and the dredge or trawl was down , we noticed , more especially in the western part of the Faeroe Channel , a regular tidal set , the greatest strength recorded beinsr three-quarters of a mile per hour .
The direction of the tidal stream appeared to vary considerably , and unfortunately our opportunities for observations were few , far , as a rule , the long swell usually experienced entirely masked the tide , the " Triton " being so light , that on almost all occasions when the engines were stopped , even with the trawls down , the normal position was broadside to the swell .
The height of the waves usually experienced was from 9 to 12 feet but waves of 17 feet from trough to summit were not uncommon , and early in September , during a gale , they were recorded as 25 feet from trough to summit .
The highest wave recorded during the voyage of the " Challenger " was 23 feet from trough , to summit .
At all times we noticed that the sea was shorter and heavier on the Wyville Thomson ridge than on either side , and sometimes when crossing it we observed peculiar " smooths , ' " as if oil was floating on the surface , or a spring welling up from the .
bottom .
In these smooths the temperature of the water remained unaltered .
Dredgings and Trawlings.\#151 ; The result of the dredgings and trawl , ings , as well as of the surface dredgings , by the tow net , will be reported on by Mr. John Murray , who accompanied the " Triton " throughout her exploration of the Faeroe Channel .
