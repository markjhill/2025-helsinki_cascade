On the Measurement of Snowdon , by the Thermrometrical Barometer , By the Rev. F. J. H. Wollaston , B.D. F.R.S. Read June 29 , 1820 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1820 , p. 295 .
] After adverting to the statements contained in his former paper upon the use of the above-mentioned instrument , and giving certain tables requisite for determining the necessary corrections arising out of the want of uniformity in the variations of the boiling temperature of water at certain elevations , the author details the means which he resorted to for estimating the height of Snowdon by this instrument , and compares his results with the trigonometrical and barometrical measurement of General Roy .
The height , as obtained by the thermometric barometer , properly corrected from the north end of Carnarvon Quay to the summit , is 3546'25 feet .
General Roy 's trigonometrical measurement gives 3555-4 feet , and barometrically 3548 9 feet .
During this visit to Carnarvon , the author also took the opportunity of ascertaining , by the same means , the height of Moel Elio , also measured by General Roy .
He makes it 2350-55 feet , while General Roy 's trigonometrical measurement gives 2371 feet , and the barometer 2391-8 feet , This discordance , the author thinks , may be referred to the indeterminate form of Moel Elio rendering the point of observation less definite .
Archdeacon Wollaston concludes this paper with a description of some improvements in the construction of this instrument .
