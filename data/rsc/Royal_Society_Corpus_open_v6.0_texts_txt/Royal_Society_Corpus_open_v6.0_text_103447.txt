Observations upon the Tides in the River Thames , by Mr. Henry de Saumarez .
THAT the Use of my Instrument called the * Marine Surveyor may yet farther appear , I shall here give some Experiments I made with it on the River Thames , in order to determine the Strength of the Tides of Flood and Ebb .
Were the same to be done in the Channel , and on the Sea Coast of Great Britain , and marked in our Charts , I am humbly of Opinion , it would be of no small advantage to our Commerce , and of consequence a sufficient Recommendation of the Marine Surveyor , if that alone were the Use of it .
I am induced the rather to be of this Opinion , in regard I am not insensible of the Dangers on the Casquets , in the Race of Alderney , &amp;c. where rapid Tides and Currents have occasioned but too many to mourn the Loss of Friends and Fortunes : As I dwell in the Neighbourhood of these Dangers , I have ( in manifest hazard of my Life ) surveyed and taken correct Draughts not only of them , but of the Islands of Guernsey , Sarck , &amp;c. And as I persuade my self they are as correct , as any Thing that has hitherto appeared of this kind , it is my intent to publish them for the Good of the Public .
