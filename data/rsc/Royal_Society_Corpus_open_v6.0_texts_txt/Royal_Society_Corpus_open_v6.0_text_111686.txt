( Abstract .
) In this paper quaternary cubics are discussed under the canonical form first given by Professor Sylvester , ax ' + by ' + Cz ' +d+ ev ' , where X+-y+z+Z+v=O .
The writer shows how , when quantics are thus expressed with a supernumerary variable , it is possible to form contravariants also expressed with a supernumerary variable , and such that for the variables , either in covariant or contravariant , we may substitute differentials with regard to the variables of the other .
By the help of this principle , covariants , contravariants , and invariants of the cubic are formed with great facility .
It is proved that a quaternary cubic has five fundamental invariants of the degrees respectively 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , as well as an invariant of the degree 100 , whose square can be expressed in terms of the five funidamental invariants .
The discriminant is also expressed in terms of the four first of these invariants .
It is remarked that in the same manner as the theory of ternary cubies is analogous to the theory of binary quartics , so there are many analogies between the theory of quaternary cubics and that of binary quintics .
Four covariants are noticed of the first degree in the variables , by the aid of which expressions for the cnbic can be obtaiined analogous 2N ' to what M. Hermit has called the " four types " of binar ' Y quinitics .
Other covariants of the cubic are discussed , auid in particular a general expression is given for that covariant of the 9th order which geometrically represents a surface passing through the twenlty-sevent right lines on the surface of the third order represented by the cubic .
