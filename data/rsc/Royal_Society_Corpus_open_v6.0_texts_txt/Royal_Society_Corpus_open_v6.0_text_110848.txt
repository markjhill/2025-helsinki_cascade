" On the production of Ozone by Chemical Means .
" By C. F. Shoenbein , Professor of Chemistry at Basle , in a second letter to Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. Communicated by Dr. Faraday .
The author adduces further evidence in support of the opinions he advanced in his former communication relative to the identity of the odoriferous principles which are disengaged during electric discharges in common air , during the electrolysis of water , and during the slow action of phosphorus upon atmospheric air .
This principle , termed Ozone , he regards as being a simple body , and a constituent of azote , which he believes to be a compound of hydrogen and ozone ; and he explains the disengagement of this latter element , which he considers as analogous in its chemical character to chlorine , by the partial decomposition of azote , in consequence of its hydrogen combining with oxygen , in the several processes above-mentioned during which ozone makes its appearance .
