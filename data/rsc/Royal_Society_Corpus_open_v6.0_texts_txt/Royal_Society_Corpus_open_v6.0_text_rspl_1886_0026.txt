" On Radiant Matter Spectroscopy : Note on the Earth Ya .
" By William Crookes , F.R.S. Received February 18 , 1886 .
Among the samarskite earths which concentrate towards the middle of the fractionations there is one ( or a group ) which presents in the radiant matter tube a well marked phosphorescent spectrum differing from those I have already described .
The measurements of the bands and lines are given below:\#151 ; Scale of spectroscope .
X. 1 X2 Remarks .
10-325 ' 6446 2407 Approximate centre of a red band shaded off on the least refrangible side .
10 310 6415 2430 Somewhat sharp edge of the red band .
10-185 6189 2611 Approximate centre of a very faint orange band .
10 -130 6094 2693 A sharp narrow orange-red line .
10 -050 5970 2806 Approximate centre of a narrow bright orange band .
( Between this line and 2693 is a fainter semi-continuous orange band .
) 9-840 5676 3104 Approximate centre of a narrow bright green band .
9 -790 5613 3174 Approximate centre of a narrow green band , not quite so bright as 3104 .
9-690 5495 3312 Approximate centre of a bright green band , wider than the other three green bands .
9-610 5406 3422 Approximate centre of a narrow bright green band .
The earth giving the above spectrum , when sufficiently purified , presents all the characteristics of the earth discovered by Marignac , and provisionally called by him Ya.* Through the kindness of M. de * " Comptes rendus , " xc , p. 899 .

237 Marignac I have been enabled to compare a specimen of Ya of his own preparation with the earth described above .
The two earths agree in their chemical Characteristics , and their phosphorescent spectra are practically identical .
No name has yet been given to this earth , as M. de Marignac appears to be in some doubt whether it is not identical with J. Lawrence Smith 's earth , mosandra.* A specimen of mosandra prepared by J. Lawrence Smith , and sent me by M. de Marignac , gave* a phosphorescent spectrum showing that it was compound , and that yttria was one of its constituents .
