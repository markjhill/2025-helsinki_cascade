On Biologic Regions and Tabulation Areas .

[ Plates 24 , 25 .
] Section I. I have been for some years engaged on a revision of the sedges , a natural order of 3000 species .
I have determined a great number of specimens which have the locality where each was collected satisfactorily fixed , and have noted these localities .
I thus can append to each species a list of all the localities where it is known to me to grow .
Sedges extend over nearly the whole area of the world occupied by flowering plants .
The question arose , which areas for reference will it be most convenient for me to use in recording after each species its geographic distribution .
It is evident that it will be advisable to use for every species the same set of reference areas ; then the results can be easily exhibited on a table , and can be combined by simple addition to give the distribution for the genera , sub-orders , \amp ; c. I commenced experiments in systematizing my habitats ( at the end of each species described ) about 18 months ago ; I have tried many plans and made many maps ; I have experimented on a few genera and tabulated the results in different ways .
I have also looked up the works of others , more especially the 'Geographical Distribution of Animals , ' by Mr. Wallace , and have been led much farther than I anticipated , and in particular to one conclusion that appears to me of importance , As this affects all naturalists , including palaeontologists , I have drawn up the present paper for reading here , rather than at the Linnean Society .
I state shortly this one important conclusion .
Mr. Wallace , and many others since , assumed that the most natural biologic regions would form also the best areas of reference ; my conclusion is that natural biologic regions and sub-regions , as defined by Wallace , are inconvenient , I might say , impracticable , as reference areas for species ; and that generally each improvement in the circumscription of biologic regions results in an increasing complication of their boundary lines , and renders them more impossible to use as the framework on which the distribution of large numbers of species shall be displayed .
There are on the wall ( A ) a copy of Wallace 's map , showing his zoogeographical 3 b 2 1G 11.92 regions ( see Plate 24# ) ; ( B ) the World divided into tabulation areas and sub-areas as employed by me for the reference of each species of sedge ( see Plate 25 ) ; ( C ) and ( D ) a small genus of sedges tabulated ( see pp. 384 and 385 ) with reference to the map ( B ) .
It is found convenient to divide the globe primarily into about 6 regions and 20-30 sub-regions .
The terms regions and sub-regions , used by Wallace , have been lengthily criticised ; I have no time to discuss the propriety of the terms .
They will do very well for me .
The sub-regions must , of course , fit into the regions , or the summation of results is not possible ; and , for the same reason , the boundaries of the sub-regions should be selected so that , as far as possible , the political areas already used for biologic reference in local manuals , \amp ; c. , may , as sub-sub-regions , fit into the sub-regions .
Wallace commences ( vol. 1 , p. 54):\#151 ; " The first essential is a broadly marked and easily remembered set of regions .
" This is quite right ; but it is clear that Wallace had in his mind only one of the functions which he required of his regions , viz. , their use as areas of reference , when he wrote these words .
When it comes to referring the habitats of tens of thousands of specimens to some framework , such framework of tabulation areas must be the simplest possible ; each area must be bounded by a precisely defined line ; nor must it be necessary frequently to have recourse to a large scale map to determine whether a specimen was collected in Region I. or in Region III .
It will be noticed at once that my framework of tabulation areas differs very little from Wallace 's natural zoologic regions .
I have , in fact , reduced the former from the latter , with the minimum of alteration that would enable me to use it for practical reference .
The main difference noticeable at first sight is that I have extended the boundary lines over the sea so as to include the oceanic islands in the adjacent continental areas .
I should observe that I do not mean or propose by this map to divide the sea into tabulation areas ; the subject of marine biologic regions has its own additional difficulty , and I leave it to those competent to deal with it .
But however alike in general aspect are Wallace 's map ( A ) and my map ( B ) , they represent different aims ; Wallace 's map ( A ) represents the World divided into the most natural regions for the Mammalia ; my map ( B ) is intended to represent the World divided into convenient areas of universal reference ; I do not admit that the areas and sub-areas in it are inferior in naturalness to any scheme of regions yet proposed ; but that is not my point .
I have had the advantage of showing this framework map of mine to several most distinguished naturalists ; I believe each of them , without a single exception , in the course of a very short conversation , drifted into some criticism arising solely from his ideas as to natural biologic regions .
Thus , one wanted to throw Greenland into Northern Europe ; another wanted to divide New Guinea into two by a parallel of longitude .
I venture to reiterate that my map ( B ) has been arrived at by continual trials of it as a framework of reference with continual * Plate 24 is a copy of the frontispiece to Mr. Wallace 's " Geographical Distribution of Animals , " reproduced by kind permission of Messrs. Macmillan and Co. AND TABULATION AREAS .
emendations ; and not in order to exhibit the natural distribution of plants or animals , or of any Order of them .
Before going into the various considerations which have influenced me in the preparation of my map ( 3 ) , I will show some of the great difficulties which I met with in first trying to tabulate on Wallace 's map .
I endeavoured to tabulate the Himalayan plants between his Regions I. and III .
; but Wallace 's line is a broad one on a small scale map , and , though I have a particular acquaintance with the geography here , and know the precise spot where the plant was collected , I often cannot tabulate it ; I cannot say as to 1 Himalayan plant specimen in 20 , whether it was collected in Wallace Region I. or in Wallace Region III .
There exists , no doubt , an unusually strongly marked natural line between the high level Himalayan flora with Firs , Oaks , and Blackberries , and the Indo-Malay tropical flora .
I could assume as to many a Himalayan plant that in character it was European , and tabulate it in Region I. accordingly .
Each tabulation of a specimen made in this manner will be illusory ; the thing to be proved is assumed , and we are in a complete circle ; tabulators have , however , sometimes allocated specimens in this way , and such additions only serve to mask the conclusions that could have been drawn from the resulting numbers had they been omitted .
But further , this way of tabulating causes some of the most striking facts of geographic distribution to disappear .
I may have , for instance , a Himalayan pine to tabulate , and , as I do not know exactly which side of Wallace 's line it comes from , I place it in Region I. But it perhaps was a specimen of Pinus longifolia from the tropical zone .
Or I may find a Bengal specimen of the common stag's-horn moss , which we have to go to the mountains of Scotland or of Wales to find ; and , regarding this as an alpine plant , I might refer it \amp ; priori to Region I. , whereas this identical series is abundant in the subtropical zone in Bengal .
This work of tabulating must not be done from a priori assumptions of what the results will be .
Mr. Wallace has not made this error ; his map at the beginning of his book is really the result attained by all his work in the book ; in all this work , before he had made his map , he referred the Mammalia to ordinary geographic areas more or less well-defined , as to France , to India , to Africa south of the Tropic of Cancer , \amp ; c. And in his book , though he starts with this map , he perpetually finds it more convenient to describe the area of a species by reference to ordinary geography rather than to the regions and sub-regions of his own map .
I have taken Wallace 's undefined line between Regions I. and III .
along the Himalaya as a single example to illustrate the difficulties I met in endeavouring to use his map as a reference map for tabulating upon ; it is a primary important line .
But there are many ill-defined tortuous boundary lines on the map ( A ) which are most inconvenient for tabulation .
One such is the boundary between Regions V. and VI .
, a primary important line ; here Wallace prolongs the Nearctic Region V. in a long promontory down the Mexican plateau .
This is quite right as to the distribution both of Mammalia and of plants .
I think I may safely challenge any botanist to tabulate the plants from Mexico in our collections by this boundary ; in proportion as it is natural , so is it difficult to tabulate on .
Mr. Sclater , in 'Journ .
Linn. Soc. , ' vol. 2 , " Zoology , " 1858 ( paper read 1857 ) , p. 30 , discussed before Wallace the question , " What are the most natural primary ontologic divisions of the earth 's surface ?
" Mr. Sclater proposed that each enquirer should work out , from his own subject alone , what he conceived to be the most natural divisions of the earth 's surface , and that these might ultimately be combined so as to arrive at a correct solution of the problem .
Mr. Sclater appears to have meant that each enquirer should use his own system of geography of reference .
It is evident that the combination of results contemplated by Sclater would be hardly possible if the enquirers used different systems , but could be done by a clerk if all the enquirers worked on one framework .
The large tabulations done by Engler and others , the complex maps of geographic botany published , the innumerable systems of regions proposed as the most natural ( down to the last I have seen , that of Professor Moebius , in 'Nature , ' for 3rd December , 1891 , p. 104 ) , utterly defy all attempts at general combination .
To collect even general conclusions from these huge labours in the form in which they have been published , demands not only great toil , but the separating out the facts and retabulating them on one system before the results can be added together , in other words the doing of the work over again .
Mr. Wallace foresaw and unavailingly deprecated the course which his successors would pursue in the matter of biologic regions .
He foresaw that , as his regions were constructed to represent the existing distribution of Mammalia ( so far as then known ) only , the distribution of other vertebrates being only brought in to settle doubtful points , and geologic evidence being excluded , other enquirers would use regions representing more accurately the distribution of their own groups , with complex maps .
In this way , his earnest wish to establish one set of regions as " typical , " i.e. , one map of reference areas , has been completely defeated .
The object of the present paper is to show that what is wanted is to separate absolutely the two purposes of Wallace .
It has proved quite impossible to persuade all zoologists to use as reference areas regions devised to represent the distribution of existing Mammalia .
The botanists , moreover , maintain that , owing to the fixity in the soil of nearly all vascular plants , their enormous numbers , both in species and individuals , and , still more , the large number of specimens in our herbaria of which the habitat is accurately noted , " natural regions " can be better limited from their plants than from the Mammalia .
The tabulations of Engler , Hemsley , and many others , have reached proportions probably not contemplated by Mr. Wallace in 1876 .
It appears to me that such tabulations are antecedent to the construction of biologic regions , and that the difficulties of studying and representing the distribution of life on the globe would be greatly lessened if all naturalists could agree to tabulate AND TABULATION AREAS .
on one geographic framework , at least as far down as the primary areas and sub-areas .
I now venture to put forward a framework which may answer this purpose , and I propose to print a large number of such maps in hopes that they may be largely used .
This framework has the recommendation that it agrees closely with the regions of Sclater and Wallace which have already been largely employed .
I am well aware that every line of it may be criticised .
I wish a framework , either this or some better one prepared by competent naturalists , could be issued by authority .
Section II .
This section explains how I have arrived at the map ( B)\#151 ; tabulation areas and subareas .
I have made trial maps , and then trial tabulations of a genus on them ; and , by making emendations in the map to avoid various difficulties encountered , have finally got to map ( B ) .
I will mention at the outset that the problem of finding convenient tabulation areas alters in character with the size of the areas .
Suppose that I am endeavouring to represent the distribution of a large genus in England .
I may very conveniently tabulate the distribution of each species according to the English counties , sum the results , and draw up a shaded map to exhibit the distribution of the genus at a glance .
The general result will not be seriously interfered with , because the boundary lines of the counties are not natural , but very irregular ; it will be more injured by the great inequality of the areas ; it would be better to take Yorkshire in Hidings .
The good result is attained because ( 1 ) the boundary lines of my fifty-two tabulation areas are definite , shown on accurate maps , and in general use so that I can work without perpetual recourse to large scale maps , and ( 2 ) because collectors employ largely the same areas and ticket their collections accordingly .
The supposed tabulation may for instance show that our genus extends through the six northern counties , Derby , much of Wales and Devonshire , and may give us nearly as distinct a view of its distribution as if we had tabulated on natural regions .
If we actually possessed a map of England divided into the fifty-two most natural regions possible , i.e. , if we had attained the ideal of some writers on biologic regions , these complex regions would be most troublesome to tabulate upon , and the result would differ little from that got much more easily by tabulating on the fifty-two counties .
It would therefore appear that if we were to divide the whole land surface of the globe into small areas , say quadrangles of 2 ' side , no better framework for tabulation could be desired .
And this is so ; but it would require 2000 such small areas .
The finiteness of human strength comes in ; we want , to begin with , the land surface of the globe divided into twenty to thirty sub-areas ; and we want , this is the real underlying motive , these sub-areas so devised as , on our first sorting , to separate out the material as far as possible .
If we take our sub-areas so that one sub-area , say n 13 , contains nothing but what is found in n 14 , or contains all that is found in the sub-areas 14,15 , then we shall expend a great deal of our labour on our first tabulation to little purpose .
In these tabulations of very numerous specimens and species we want our first sorting to divide them , as far as possible , into separate boxes .
If we can attain to this , our first tabulation will exhibit the broader features of the distribution , and will immensely facilitate any subsequent inquiry into the detailed distribution .
Suppose , as an example taking only a moderate area into consideration that , in a tabulation of the plants of Europe , the scale of work would only permit three areas for England and Wales .
If I framed these areas so that they were bounded roughly by lines running N.W. and S.E. , I should get nearly all the plants in each of my three areas ; but , if I bounded roughly my areas by lines running N.E. and S.W. , I should at once discover that a number of the plants of the western and hilly region did not occur in my south-east area .
And , for any subsequent examination in detail , my three boxes would each contain a much smaller number of species to be dealt with than are contained in the whole of England and Wales .
The division of the globe into primary areas and sub-areas involves other difficulties .
If political areas are used they are liable to change .
Thus , during the preparation of the flora of British India , designed by the Secretary of State to include the political area , this area has materially changed ; the plants of Burma and of Quetta , included in the later volumes of the work , were excluded in the earlier ; so that any distribution results deduced mechanically from the whole of that work , must be more or less invalidated ; the labour of going over every volume and correcting or making allowance for these changes of area would be very great , and would require an extraordinary knowledge of the details to do it profitably .
It is on such considerations that naturalists have of late years preferred to work upon permanent boundary lines .
A great river will not do ; as nearly all the plants that grow on one bank may usually be found on the other .
Some naturalists have , therefore , adopted the lines of water-parting ; but I find these little better than the rivers ; in a few cases plants are confined to a particular drainage area , but in most cases not .
A line of water-parting is in many cases , as that of the Bocky Mountains , much more difficult to follow accurately on an ordinary map than a river .
Even on the small scale , with good maps and the ground thoroughly known , I do not find the water-partings satisfactory as dividing lines .
They have been largely used in the county floras of England .
Thus , my own county , Hants , has been divided into the basins of the Test , the Itchen , the Avon , \amp ; c. , taken as the reference areas for the species of plants .
But the basin of the Test extends from the water-parting at Walbury , 1100 feet above sea , to the mud of Southampton Water , and very nearly all the plants that are to be found in the county at all are to be found in this basin ; to tabulate on it as a sub-area of the county leads to nothing .
Still more futile is it to divide North India into the basins of the Ganges , the Brahmapootra , \amp ; c. , as reference AND TABULATION AREAS .
areas .
Whilst the flora of the Ganges basin differs little from that of the Brahmapootra basin , each contains a series extending from the purely Mongolian to the Malayan flora .
I have , in devising the framework shown on map ( B ) , given most weight to the following considerations:\#151 ; 1 .
The areas and sub-areas are , as far as compatible with other requirements , " natural/ ' i.e. , so devised as to ensure , on the primary tabulation , a division , as far as possible , of the material .
2 .
These areas are made , as near as practicable , coincident with the regions of Sclater and Wallace ; because those have been largely adopted , and because they broadly do represent the primary ontologic division of the Earth 's surface .
The sub-areas , also , are near the sub-regions of Wallace , but are less closely coincident .
3 .
The number of areas ( 6 ) , and sub-areas ( 23 ) , is kept nearly as in Wallace .
It is , in many cases , easy to improve the separation by increasing the number of the sub-areas .
I am satisfied , by trials , that 23 is quite a large enough number of columns for the primary tabulation .
I think it might be better to include the Sandwich Isles in Polynesia , rather than to make any additional sub-area .
4 .
All the boundary lines in my map ( B ) , are fixed definitely .
A political line is now sometimes easier to work with than the tropic or parallel 100 ' west longitude .
But when , after a few years , we may have to work with some abandoned political line ( the political boundary on 1st January , 1890 ) , it will be different ; it may be difficult , even twenty-five years hence , to get a map that shows the political boundaries of some countries on 1st January , 1890 .
All my later emendations of map ( B ) , have been in one direction , viz. , the replacing of political lines by parallels of latitude and longitude .
5 .
The boundary lines are made , as far as possible , " easily remembered , " to use Wallace 's words .
I find that I can , with the lines of map ( B ) , carry on tabulation with only a very occasional reference to an atlas .
Section III .
This section defines the boundary lines in map ( B ) , and explains the reasons for some of the more anomalous ; Section II .
will thus be illustrated by some concrete examples .
Area I.\#151 ; Palae arctic a. Sub-area 1.\#151 ; Europa Frigida .
" 2.\#151 ; Mediterranea .
, , 3.\#151 ; Mongolia .
Area I. ( Palaearctica ) is nearly coincident with Wallace 's palaearctic region .
The south boundary in Africa is the Tropic of Cancer , which I have made " absolute ; " 3 c i.e. , I have avoided Wallace 's two loops , which include in his Mediterranean region the isles of Cape Yerde , and a small area of high land in the Sahara .
The straightening the line is a simplification very convenient for tabulation purposes ; moreover , here , as in many other cases , I doubt whether the straight line is less natural than Wallace 's crooked line .
Is it true that the Isles of Cape Verde , lying on 15 ' north latitude , are biologically more closely allied with the Mediterranean region than with the part of Africa lying between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer ?
I keep Arabia in one sub-area , whereas Wallace divides it between two regions , which is inconvenient .
As to naturalness , my line is not natural , but it is less unnatural than Wallace 's .
The boundary line between Areas I. and III .
, i.e. , between Mongolia and Indo-China , is one of the very troublesome points .
I have laid it down so that the political areas of India , China proper , and Japan , on 1st January , 1890 , fall entirely into Area III .
, Indo-China .
This enables me to make the sub-areas 8 , 9 , 10 fit exactly into the main Area III .
, Indo-China , and also to coincide severally with India , China , Japan , as areas already used by naturalists .
This is at least temporarily convenient , as it enables a naturalist readily to make use of existing books in comparisons .
As to naturalness , no boundary can be more unnatural botanically than Wallace 's line , which throws the whole basin of the Yangtsekiang into the palaearctic region , and leaves of China , in the Indo-Chinese region , only the provinces of Fokien , Quantung , and Quangsi .
At the same time , I think all these political lines will give trouble in the future , and , if a committee of competent naturalists were to recommend as the boundary between the Areas I. and III .
, the line 40 ' north latitude , from the Pamir to Japan , I should offer no objection .
Sub-area 1 .
{ Europa Frigida ) takes in all Europe north of 45 ' north latitude , which cuts France and Italy in two .
No line has troubled me more .
The difficulty is this .
If we make our first two sub-areas , as Wallace has done , to be Northern Europe and Mediterranea , we must either divide France or spoil these areas for separation purposes .
If we throw all France into Northern Europe , we shall get-tabulated into our silb-area 1 , all the strictly Mediterranean fauna and flora of the south of France , the tabulation would be hardly worth doing ; it would be preferable to make our sub-areas 1 and 2 into one .
Granting , then , that France is to be divided between ( l ) Europa Frigida , and ( 2 ) Mediterranea , the most natural line would perhaps be to follow the waterparting , and keep the basins of the Garonne and Rhone in Mediterranea .
I might , then , make a list of the Departments which should belong to Mediterranea , but this gives no better result , and is infinitely more trouble to remember than the line of 45 ' north latitude , which took me a year of trials to arrive at .
AND TABULATION AREAS .
Area II .
Ethiopia ; includes all Africa south of the tropic of Cancer , and divides readily into\#151 ; Sub-area 4 .
Africa Tropica Borealis .
5 .
Africa Tropica Australis .
6 .
Caput , i.e. , Extratropical South Africa .
7 .
Mascarenia , i.e. , Madagascar with the allied islands .
I find these the most satisfactory areas that I have devised .
They are no trouble , either to remember or to work with .
The sub-areas 4 and 5 together make up the area of our existing book , Oliver 's ' Flora of Tropical Africasub-area 6 agrees with the area of Harvey and Sonder 's ' Flora Capensissub-area 7 is one accepted by all zoologists and botanists .
I divide tropical Africa into two , because it is advisable to make our primary subheads equivalent ( roughly ) in value , not to commence with a Yorkshire and a Rutland .
The equator is a definite and easily-remembered line , and proves on trial a fairly " natural " one ; i.e. , the boxes 4 and 5 do not , on my tabulations , contain nearly the same things .
Area III .
Indo-China .
I have altered Wallace 's name ( Orient ) for this , because his name is , botanically at least , preoccupied .
By the Orient Region , botanists understand , as in Boissier * Flora Orientalis , ' the main part of Wallace 's Mediterranean Region , and no part of India or Malaya .
To avoid extreme confusion I therefore re-name Area III .
There is no boundary line on map ( B ) which will be probably such a stumbling-block to botanists as the line which I have drawn between Areas III .
and IY .
; it is the " Wallace " line , passing through the Macassar Sea and immediately east of Java , and thus carrying off Celebes and the Moluccas themselves out of Malaya into Polynesia .
There is , I need hardly say , no botanic separation between the Moluccas and Malaya .
But the whole Polynesian tropical flora , even as far as Tahiti , is only an appendage to the Malay flora ; and I found , to my surprise , on some trial tabulations , that the Wallace line is as convenient as any other .
It is a botanic objection to it that it cuts in half the Malay flora comprised in Miquel 's large work , ' Flora Indise Batavae .
' A distinguished naturalist suggested to me that it might be better to bound the Indo-China area by the parallel of 140 ' E. longitude , which would be more natural , and would keep our sub-area n 11 coincident with Miquel 's Malaya .
But , as the Wallace line is zoologically a natural one , and no botanic line can be said to exist anywhere hereabout , I think the botanists ought in this case to give way .
I need add nothing here about the sub-areas of Area III .
, because the boundary line between Areas I. and III .
, already discussed , was devised to save these sub-areas .

Polynesia .
15 .
Sandwich .
Assuming that we have already fixed the boundary between our Areas III .
and IV .
, the only point in the arrangement of the sub-areas that I have much hesitated over is whether the sub-area 15 , Sandwich , might not be better sunk in 14 , Polynesia .
The sub-area 15 , Sandwich , is too small ; on the other hand , it has relations with America which make it inconvenient to include it in the sub-area Polynesia , which includes also the Moluccas .
Another point that may attract notice is the apparently huge extension of the New Zealand sub-area to include Kerguelen and the Crozets .
It must be recollected that the map is on Mercator 's projection ; there is really no very great extension ; the sub-areas 13 and 23 run into one on their southern frontier , exactly as sub-areas 3 and 16 do on their northern frontier .
It may be a question whether Kerguelen should not be tabulated under 23 rather than under 13 , but this would make hardly any difference in the primary tabulations .
Area V. Nearctica .
For the southern limit I have taken the tropic of Cancer .
Wallace 's line is impossible to tabulate upon ; the alternative to the tropic is the political boundary between the United States and Mexico on January 1 , 1890 .
I prefer the tropic .
Sub-area 16 .
Canada .
I take Wallace 's line , i.e. , the political boundary on January 1 , 1890 .
This is rather more natural than taking a parallel of latitude , as the political line runs more south on the east side of the continent than on the west .
Also , if the political boundary should be altered , this boundary being made up of the St. Lawrence on the east , a parallel of latitude on the west , will always be easy to work .
If , however , any competent committee would prefer the parallel of 45 ' or 50 ' north latitude , I could offer no objection .
Sub-area 17 .
United States Orientalis .
18 .
United States Occidentals .
Though parallels of latitude answer well in the Old World , in the New the direction of the great mountain range alters matters .
The United States , like tropical Africa , is so large that it requires dividing into two sub-areas .
Wallace effects this by the Rocky Mountain line of water-parting .
I found this a troublesome line to AND TABULATION AREAS .
work , even with a large and good map ; and , moreover , as far as my plants go , it does not effect a good separation on the primary tabulation .
For a very large number of western plants on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains are also found on their eastern slopes .
On the other hand , the line of 100 ' west longitude sorts off the Eastern United States ' flora well ; in short , I find it both an easier and a more natural boundary than the water-parting .
The fact is that , in the final result , I come very near to Mr. Wallace .
In order that the dividing-lines of my tabulation areas may effect a good sorting of the plants on the primary tabulation , these lines must be made to coincide approximately with the boundaries of natural biologic regions .
If we bound these regions by broadly-marked and easily-remembered limits ( to quote Mr. Wallace 's words ) , his biologic regions become practically my tabulation areas .
But , if the details are filled in to his regions and sub-regions , the boundary lines become too complex to tabulate upon .
Area VI .
Neotropica .
Sub-area 19 .
America Centralis .

Andesia Tropica .

Brasil Borealis .
22 .

I have not been able to subdivide this Area VI .
at all to my satisfaction .
The boundaries I have adopted are ( except that between sub-areas 21 and 22 ) political , and are\#151 ; Sub-area 19 .

Argentina , Uruguay , and extratropical Chili , to Cape Horn .

J being the line 10 ' south latitude .
There is an inherent difficulty in every plan of subdividing Neotropica ; it is intrinsically of one biologic character from the lowlands of Mexico and the West Indies to Bio Janeiro .
The tropical Andes region differs a good deal , as see John Ball and Dr. Guenther .
The main objection I feel to my present arrangement is that the boundaries , being the political boundaries of January 1 , 1890 , are unstable .
I have failed to find any lines of latitude and longitude that are feasible .
If the north boundary of Argentina is drawn about 30 ' south latitude , it would throw half the Argentine flora with the Brazilian ; and if the line be drawn at the tropic , it would throw all Paraguay and South Brazil with Patagonia .
It might be possible to bound Argentina by the tropic on the north , by the meridian 57 ' 30 ' west longitude on the east ; but this would be a complication .
Even greater difficulties will be found in bounding the sub-area 20 , Andesia Tropica , by a line of longitude , or by any slanting line drawn from some one defined point to another .
I have tried the line 70 ' west longitude , but this cuts ofi ' all Bolivia from the adjacent Peru highlands , and works badly .
Andesia Tropica and Argentina , however difficult to define by broadly-marked and easily remembered limits , are at all events natural divisions ; unfortunately the line between the West Indies and Venezuela is entirely artificial ; it is , however , easily remembered .
The line 10 ' south latitude , which I employ to divide Brazil , appears on the other hand fairly natural , but with an increase in our knowledge of Matto Grosso , the great interior of Brazil , it can hardly be hoped to remain so .
At present some difference can be seen between Bio Janeiro with Paraguay , on the one hand , and Venezuela with Guiana on the other .
Section IV .
I add but a few words here on the method of using these areas and sub-areas ; inasmuch as tabulation , on a large or on a small scale , is a process now familiar to every naturalist .
For each species , in the citation of specimens , I arrange the authenticated localities in regular order under the areas and sub-areas from 1 to 23 .
At the end of a genus , the results can be collected on the table by a clerk .
The table ( C ) shown I have thus formed for the genus Kyllinga of thirty-four species .
The asterisks denote that the species is recorded from the sub-area , and the blanks that it is not , according to the usual notation .
The distribution for the areas is got by mere inspection from those of the sub-area ; I have added columns to show at a glance the distribution as between the Old World and the New .
I am , however , employing a slightly different way of tabulating , which gives much improved results at very small extra labour .
In this table ( C ) the asterisk here represents that a single collection of this sub-tropical species has been once made in a hot spring in Kamschatka .
A similar asterisk in the same table is all that records that a species is present in great abundance throughout India .
In table ( D ) the numbers put in place of the asterisks denote the number of specimens actually recorded under each sub-area .
This represents very imperfectly the quantitative distribution of the species ; it might give better final results if these numbers in table ( D ) were cubed before the agglomerative process was commenced ; but the totals shown in ( D ) are at least all well within the mark , and certainly represent the quantitative distribution much better than does table ( C ) .
My clerk can make a table similar to D for each genus in the Order ; he can thence by addition make out similar tables for the sub-Order and the Order .
The true natural regions for each species and genus of sedges can be constructed , and might be represented on a map .
Thus , for this genus , Kyllinga , in a framework AND TABULATION AREAS .
map ( B ) , each sub-area might be shaded a depth proportional to the totals at the foot of each sub-area .
The finding the most natural regions of the globe , so far as sedges are concerned , will be an arithmetical process ; but by inspection and a few trials it can be done approximately , and , indeed , near enough .
For the deficiencies in collections , inequalities in the size of species , and doubts or errors in the determination of the critical plants will introduce wider percentages in the limits of possible error .
Summary .
( 1 ) The preparation of biologic regions presupposes a tabulation of material on some geographic framework .
( 2 ) The use of natural biologic regions to tabulate upon has been found inexpedient , and is absolutely impracticable as , with increasing knowledge , their boundaries become ever more complex , ( 3 ) If naturalists would agree to tabulate on one geographic framework , each might have every liberty in making out his own regions and sub-regions for exhibition of his results ; and yet all the advantages aimed at by Wallace in enforcing the employ of one set of regions might be secured .
( 4 ) I accordingly put forward a framework of areas and sub-areas , adapted for tabulation upon by all non-marine naturalists .
( 5 ) I show the considerations which have guided me in drawing up this framework , which coincides in the main with the zoogeographic map of Wallace .

385 Postscript .
Received June 20 , 1892 .
I have received , from the Secretary of the Society , the following remarks made by a referee of the foregoing paper :\#151 ; " The author is invited to reconsider\#151 ; " ( 1 .
) The exclusion of the Malay Peninsula from sub-area 11 .
Malaya .
" ( 2 .
) The inclusion of the Argentine and Chilian floras under one area .
23 .
Argentina .
" ( 3 .
) The exclusion of Greenland from I. Europa Frigidior .
" ( 4 .
) The division of the Australian sub-area under two areas .
" I gladly reconsider these suggestions as they throw light on some points not explained in sufficient detail in the paper .
I am not sure but that all of them may be improvements on my map .
I have not pretended to provide the best possible system of tabulation areas ; the primary object of my paper is to show that for any large tabulation ( and a very large tabulation is requisite to get valuable results ) , a system of areas and sub-areas " absolutely defined , easily remembered , " is required .
I find also by experience that 23 ( Wallace 's number ) of sub-areas is quite the maximum number that can be worked by human infirmity on the first tabulation of 3000 species .
Instead of increasing this number 23 , we must look to the subsequent tabulation into sub-sub-areas .
I observe that the smaller the sub-area the more easy it is to make it a " natural " one ; my smallest sub-area is 15 , Sandwich , and it is very natural ; but it is the very one that I would select to sacrifice to enable me to subdivide some other .
Mr. W. T. Blanford observed at the reading of the paper that to make the sub-areas natural I must make a great many more .
This is perfectly true ; but my opinion is that the number 23 should not be exceeded for the first tabulation .
No doubt if an author is dealing with a limited group of species , or with a limited portion of the globe , he may use a greater number than 23 sub-areas ; but that is a much simpler problem than the one I am attacking .
I am disposed now to think that the referee 's proposal to subdivide 12 , Australia , into two , by including the Sandwich Islands in Polynesia , would be , perhaps , an improvement on my scheme as it stands .
The sub-division of the Argentine sub-area ( 23 ) into two , would make each of the two far more natural than the present sub-area 23 .
This might be done without increasing the total number of the sub-areas , by throwing the two sub-areas of Brazil , 21 and 22 , into one .
The objection to this is that it would make the sub-areas so very unequal in size and importance .
The Malay Peninsula undoubtedly goes with Sumatra biologically .
I have put AND TABULATION AREAS .
it in my map in British India , merely to make my sub-areas run with Sir J. D. Hooker 's ' Flora of British India .
' To separate , as suggested , the Malay Peninsula , would give sub-area 8 , India Orient .
, a boundary partly political , partly geographic ; nor would doing this materially improve the naturalness of sub-area 8 .
The Malay Peninsula goes well enough with Tenasserim and Lower Burma ; but , if it were excluded , we should still have included in sub-area 8 , first , the Tibetan flora ( from North Sikkim to Baltisthan ) which is Mongolian , or at all events widely different from that of India at 0-1000 feet elevation ; secondly , the Sind Flora which is that of Bossier 's \#163 ; Flora Orientalis , ' i.e. , my sub-area 2 , Mediterranea .
The fact is that it is hopeless to get sub-areas the size of my 23 sub-areas " natural smaller sub-sub-areas may be devised that are far more natural .
Greenland goes more naturally with Iceland than with North Canada , but the difference is not very large ( as it is in the case of the Tibetan flora included in the sub-area of India Orient .
) .
I put Greenland with America ( in Nearctica ) because Wallace did so .
If we stick to the grand division into Old World and New World , I do not think it matters much into which Greenland is thrown .
But this suggestion about Greenland raises a wider question .
The whole area round the Pole down to about 50 ' N.L. would form a very natural sub-area .
But it would be too small ( in number of species ) for my purpose ; and , if it were enlarged by carrying it much lower down , its naturalness would rapidly disappear .
I would not resist any of the improvements suggested by the referee for my consideration ; but I would hold that they must be carried out in detail subject to the following restrictions ( and many other complex considerations ) :\#151 ; 1 .
The total number of sub-areas must not exceed 23 .
2 .
The 23 ( or fewer ) sub-areas must be sub-equal , z.e. , in biologic richness , not necessarily in square miles .
3 .
The boundary of the new sub-area must be accurately defined .
It is not sufficient to say that the Andes flora and fauna require a sub-area to themselves ; the boundary of this sub-area must be stated " to an inch .
