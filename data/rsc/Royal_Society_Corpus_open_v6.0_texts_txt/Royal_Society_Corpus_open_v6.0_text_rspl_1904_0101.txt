Communicated by Professor H. E. Armstrong , E.E.S. Eeceived June 16 , 1904 .
The study of the action of asymmetric hydrolytic agents on the sugars acquires interest from the fact that enzymes , which exhibit ; most remarkable activity as hydrolysts , are apparently all asymmetric in structure .
The only experiments of the kind made hitherto are those by Emil Fischer , * on the action of d- and / -camphoric acids on cane sugar , described in his memoir on the importance to Physiology of Stereochemistry .
No difference was detected ; but as the experiments were made at 90 ' C. in sealed tubes , it was desirable to extend the inquiry and to operate under conditions more nearly comparable with those under which enzymes act .
At Professor Armstrong 's suggestion , the acids selected for the purpose were the two isomeric acids of opposite activity prepared by direct sulphonation of d- and / -camphor by Eeychler 's method .
They are easily prepared and they act quickly , so that their action can be studied at atmospheric temperatures ; moreover , as concentrated solutions can be used , even a small difference in their activity should not escape detection .
The inversion was carried out in a polarimeter tube enclosed in a jacket through which a flow of water was maintained varying in temperature by only \#177 ; 0*05 ' from 20-05 ' C. Beadings of aD were taken at intervals of 15 minutes .
The results obtained are entered in the following tables , in which a is the amount of cane sugar per litre of solution when the first reading was taken and a \#151 ; x the concentration of the solution , at other times t minutes after the first reading .
The strength of the acid in all cases was 0-488 gramme molecule per litre , as determined by titration with alkali .
The concentration of the sugar solution used was 17*1 per cent. ( 0*5 gramme .
molecule ) .
The rate of change was such that the inversion was about half completed at the end of six hours ; the end point was determined in Cases I and II after 48 hours standing at 20 ' C. Although there cannot have been any great difference in the conditions in the different experiments , the results must not all be included in one series , as the temperature regulator was readjusted after the first and after the fourth experiment ; they are therefore to be considered in three sets , viz. : I : II , III , IV : V , VI , VII , VIII .
The first set gave K = 10-02 for the dextro acid and 9-95 for the # 1 Zeits .

185 llsevo acid ; in the second set , the value obtained for the dextro acid 'was 9-87 , that for the lsevo acid being 9'99 .
S Slight variations in the temperature would account for such differences , as the influence of temperature on the rate of change is \#166 ; known to be very great .
But even in these experiments the variations [ observed are small and not such as to suggest any substantial difference between the two acids .
In the last set of observations , fully set forth Kn the table on p. 187 , which there is every reason to regard as satisfactory , there is clearly no evidence of a difference in the activity of the d- and Z-aeids to be noticed .
The results , therefore , not only confirm the conclusion arrived at by iE .
Fischer , but are also in agreement with the observations of Marckwald iand Chwolles , * * * S that methylic d- and Z-tartrates are hydrolysed with .equal readiness by Z-nicotine ( at 17*5 and 40 ' C. ) .
On the other hand , they are in remarkable contrast with the conclusions of Marckwald and McKenzief and of McKenzie J that ethereal salts similarly derived from optically active isomeric compounds are both formed and hydrolysed at different rates .
It is to be noticed , however , that the experiments of these chemists were carried out at relatively high temperatures and that they involved racemisation .
An experiment made with chlorhydric acid and cane sugar under conditions precisely similar to those prevailing in Experiments V\#151 ; VIII , using a solution containing 17'6 per cent. ( 0*5 gramme molecule ) of cane sugar and 0-486 gramme molecule of hydrogen chloride , the value K= 11-18 .
Representing the activity of hydrogen chloride as 100 , that of camphor-/ 3-sulphonic acid is therefore 89*8 , which is a value m accord with that assigned by Ostwald to ethylsulphonic acid , viz. , 91*2 .
In the preliminary stage of the inquiry , a comparison was also made of the action of chlorhydric acid and of eZ-camphor-/ 3-sulphonic acid on milk sugar at 60'-l .
The value obtained for the former was ' K=3'53 .

Although possibly affected by a considerable error , on account of the difficulty attending such observations at high temperatures , these results appear to indicate that the activities of the two acids are by no means the same towards cane sugar and towards milk sugar , being about 100 : 90 in the one case and 100 : 70 in the other .
Sigmondhas already shown* in the case of cane-sugar and maltose , that although sulphuric and oxalic acids have the same relative activity towards both carbohydrates , chlorhydric acid is relatively more active towards maltose : it appears , therefore , that cane sugar is less sensitive to attack by chlorhydric acid than are other sugars .
The point is one which deserves further investigation .
Although the experiments described in this note have given a negative answer to the question considered , it is proposed to extend the inquiry to other acids .
