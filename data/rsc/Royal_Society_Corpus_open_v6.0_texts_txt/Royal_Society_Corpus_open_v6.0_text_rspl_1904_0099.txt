Communicated by Sir J. Burdon Sanderson , Bart. , F.R.S. Received July 26,1904 .
( From the Pathological Laboratory of St. Mary 's Hospital , London , W. ) We propose to consider in this communication ( 1 ) the action exerted upon the tubercle bacillus by normal human blood fluids and the tuberculotropic* substances which come here into consideration ; ( 2 ) the action exerted upon the tubercle bacillus by the blood fluids of those who are the subject of tubercular infection ; ( 3 ) the distribution of tuberculotropic substances in the infected organism ; ( 4 ) the question as to whether these protective substances are present in the blood of the infant at birth ; and ( 5 ) some points in connection with the elaboration in the human organism of tuberculotropic substances in response to inoculations of a tubercle vaccine .

Action on [ July 26 first time overcome by Arloing , who obtained , by the operation of a process of selection , a strain of tubercle which gives a homogeneous growth when the culture is frequently shaken up .
For the homogeneous cultures of Arloing , Koch substituted a homogeneous sus--pension of bacillary fragments obtained by the trituration of ordinary !
tubercle cultures .
Koch made his suspension with physiological salt solution .
The test fluid thus constituted exhibits\#151 ; and this point did not escape the observation of Koch\#151 ; a proneness to spontaneous agglutination , This defect , and it is a defect which may invalidate the results of any test examination , can , as was pointed out by one of us , * be eliminated by employing ifi lieu of the 0'85-per-cent .
NaCl solution , prescribed by Koch , a 0'1-per-cent .
NaCl solution . !
We have in the case of the investigations on agglutination which are embodied in this paper in every case employed this 0'1-per-cent , salt solution both for the dilution of the serum and for the suspension of the tubercle powder .
In some of our more recent experiments we have substituted for the test fluid constituted as above a homogeneous suspension of tubercle bacilli obtained by heating an ordinary tubercle culture to 60 ' C. for an hour , filtering off the bacterial growth , breaking up this last in a mortar with a solution of 0'1-per-cent .
NaCl in 0'5-per-cent , carbolic acid , and finally centrifugalising to remove any bacterial masses which have not been resolved into their elements .
In experiments conducted with either the one or the other of these test fluids agglutination effects are obtained with normal human serum .
Conducting the experiments in throttled capillary tubes by the method described by one of us , $ and taking cognisance of the effect by naked-eye inspection , a complete sedimentation is generally obtained in the 2- and 4-fold dilution and incomplete sedimentation in the 8-fold dilution .
With some normal bloods complete sedimentation is obtained up to the 16-fold dilution .

f The principle which suggested the replacement of the stronger by the weaker salt solution finds application , as one of us ( S. R. D. ) has recently elicited , also in the case of plague cultures .
The spontaneous agglutination which has up to the present been a source of difficulty in measuring the agglutination effect exerted by sera upon plague cultures can be completely avoided by employing a OT-per-cent .

1904 ] the Tubercle Bacillus by Human Blood Fluids , etc. 161 fihagocytic fifffict obt^insd when bacteria are introduced into the blood is dependent upon an action exerted by the blood fluids directly upon Ihe micro-organisms .
| We have investigated this question also in connection with the tubercle bacillus .
In doing so a two-fold technical difficulty confronted L a difficulty associated with the circumstance that the tubercle bacillus is available in ordinary cultures only in the form of agglomerated bacterial masses , and secondly , a difficulty associated with the circumstance that unaltered tubercle bacilli when they have been obtained in homogeneous suspension are agglutinated by the action of both serum and physiological salt solution .
i The first difficulty can be surmounted by breaking up the bacterial masses in a mortar in a OT-per-cent .
NaCl solution , i.e. , in a salt solution diluted up to the point at which it will no longer bring ^together by its agglutinating action tubercle bacilli which have been mechanically separated .
The second difficulty can be surmounted by heating the tubercle Culture to 100 ' C. We subjoin here a series of experiments ( conducted before the procedure last mentioned was thought out ) , with living tubercle bacilli suspended in a 0T-per-cent .
NaCl solution .
It will be seen that the difference between the phagocytic effect obtained with the unheated and the heated serum respectively is sufficiently pronounced to throw altogether into the background the source of disturbance which is associated with the presence of an agglutinating element in the serum .
Preliminary Experiments .
In this series of experiments a homogeneous suspension of living tubercle bacilli 1 was made bg rubbing up a small quantity of a tubercle growth from a glycerine potato culture ' ) in an agate mortar in l-wi-1000 NaCl solution , and then centrifugalising to get rid of the bacterial masses which had not been resolved into their elements .

With cultures which have been exposed to a temperature of 100* C. precisely similar results are obtained , while an advantage is gained in the respect that the count is no longer rendered difficult by the massing together of the bacilli .
All the experiments hereafter subjoined have been carried out with such a culture , i.e. , a culture heated to 100 ' , broken up in l-in-1000 NaCl solution , and centrifugalised until all unresolved clumps had been carried down .
Our next series of experiments was undertaken with a view to determining whether the increased phagocytic effect obtained with the unheated serum is due to an action exerted by the serum directly upon the tubercle bacilli .

It will be manifest that these experiments testify to an opsonic action exerted by the serum directly upon the tubercle bacilli .
The smaller phagocytic effect recorded in each experiment in B as compared with A is at present without explanation .
The experiment next subjoined indicates that it is the potency of the serum rather than the potency of the white corpuscles which determines the amount of phagocytosis .
In this experiment the corpuscles of the tubercular patient 's blood , and the corpuscles of the normal blood respectively were employed in A. ' and A " in combination with their native blood fluid .
In B ' and B " a reciprocal exchange of Mood fluids was made .

It will be seen that the phagocytic effect obtained with the patient 's white corpuscles ( in A ' ) was ( in B ' ) increased more than three-fold in consequence of the replacement of their native serum by that of the control blood .
The phagocytic effect obtained with the white corpuscles of the control blood ( in A " ) was ( in B " ) diminished in an almost corresponding degree ( approximately two and a half times ) , by the replacement of their native serum by that of the patient .
These results are , it may be pointed out , in conformity with those recorded in our previous paper* in connection with the phagocytosis of the staphylococcus pyogenes .
II.\#151 ; Action exerted upon the Tubercle Bacillus by the Blood-fluids of those who are the subject of Tubercular Infection .
The blood fluids of the subjects of a particular bacterial infection may be expected to differ with respect to their content in bacterio-tropic substances from the blood fluids of normal persons .
An increased content in these elements may be expected in the case where there has been active response on the part of the machinery of immunisation to the stimulus of infection ; diminished content ( a ) where that machinery is becoming exhausted , and ( 6 ) where infection is dependent upon a native , or at any rate , antecedent deficiency in protective substances .
Agglutinating effect.\#151 ; We have in no instance found the agglutinating power of the blood of tubercular patients higher than that of certain normal bloods .
Sometimes we have found it notably decreased .
In three cases we have found it altogether absent .
On the average we find that it does not differ sensibly from that of the normal blood .
It would seem to follow\#151 ; and this conclusion is in conformity with that arrived at by others\#151 ; that no indication as to the presence or absence of tubercular infection can be drawn from the measurement of the agglutinating power , unless perhaps in the case where that reaction is found to be quite absent .

Action on [ July 26 , Opsonic effect.\#151 ; The measurement of the opsonic power of the blood fluids discloses very definite differences .
We have not in any of the sub-joined patients recorded at the outset an opsonic power equal to that of our own bloods .
On the contrary there has been in each such case a definite defect of opsonic power .
The results of our observations on this point are embodied in the table below .
Table I.\#151 ; Showing the Opsonic Power of the Blood Fluids in a Series of Tubercular Patients .
The procedure adopted was to mix together in each case the patients serum with a suspension of heated tubercle bacilli and with washed corpuscles derived from a normal person .
In each case the opsonic power of the normal serum employed as a control ( \lt ; derived in practically every case from A. E. or S. R. D. ) was taken as unity .

As indicated above , a diminished content in bacteriotropic substances such as we have here on record may be ascribed either to the # It is interesting to note in connection with this case that the definite diagnosis of tubercular infection , which was based upon the histological structure of a piece of excised tissue , was anticipated in view of the inductions obtained from the phagocytic test recorded above .
The alternative diagnosis of staphylococcus infection was excluded by the fact that the patient was found to possess a normal opsonic index with respect to the staphylococcus .
f The patient gave a typical local and general reaction when inoculated for diagnostic purposes with a test dose of Koch 's old tuberculin .
J The diagnosis was based upon a histological examination of the extirpated ovary .

It will be seen that they are in consonance with the observations ( see pp. 151 153 ) we have made in connection with the distribution of the staphylococcic opsonins in the infected organism , and with the induction that the bacteriotropic pressure is always reduced in the actual foci of infection .

It is interesting to bring into relation with the data of this last observation ( a ) the fact that the opsonic index of this patient 's serum stood to the opsonic index of the control serum employed ( A. E. W. 's ) as 1 *5 :1 j ( b ) the fact that the prognosis , so far as the restriction of the infection to the existing focus of disease , is comparatively favourable in cases of tubercular peritonitis ; and ( c ) the fact that a retrogression of the infection often follows in these cases upon the evacuation of the peritoneal fluid .
1904 .
] the Tubercle Bacillus by Human Blood Fluids , etc. p I The first and second of these facts suggest that a reaction of immunisation may be set up by the absorption of vaccinating elements from the I Lfected peritoneum .
The third fact , and the same applies ( vide Case 1 , ' !
n 152 , of the foregoing paper ) also in connection with the evacuation of Abscesses may , perhaps , find its explanation m the data given above .
r |Tt would be reasonable to expect that the flow of now and active 'lvmnh which would follow upon the evacuation of the stagnant and |(exhausted lymph , would operate in the direction of checking the rt j growth of invading micro-organisms .

The trituration to which the tubercle 1 culture is subjected is employed with the two-fold object of sterilising | the vaccine by a process of comminution , and of obtaining the fine 1 suspension which is desired .
It is doubtful whether the first of these ends can be efficiently secured by any process of trituration .
The homogeneous suspension which is desired can , as was shown above , be obtained by means other t than the comminution of the bacilli by machinery .
( 3 ) The preparation , which is now sold , chiefly for diagnostic uses , under the name of Koch 's old tuberculin.* \gt ; .
This preparation consists , as is well known , of the inspissated filtrate of a tubercle culture which has been grown for a period of weeks upmi glycerinated broth , and which has afterwards been sterilised at 100 O. Pending the working out of a vaccine upon the lines indicated in ( 1 ) , the T.R. tuberculin has been the vaccinating material employed .
In our earlier experiments this preparation was simply diluted wit sterilised salt solution .
_ i , _ In our later experiments we have\#151 ; ;af ter satisfying ourselves t a the vaccinal properties of Koch 's preparation are unaffected by t e | adoption of such precautions\#151 ; in every case heated the T.R. tubercu in ' to 60 ' C. for 1 hour , and have made our dilutions with a sterilised salt solution which had received an addition of 0'25 per cent , lyso .
* The proposition that the old tuberculin may appropriately be denoted vaccine derives its justification , first , from the consideration that the pro onBec cultivation and the prolonged digestion of the culture which is involved in t process of manufacture must be associated with autolysis , and secondly , from the observations made in connection with .
Case 13 of Table I and the last patien in Table III .
, " -R In the former case , the opsonic index of the patient s blood stoo a immediately before the inoculation of 1 millegramme old tuberculin .
It stood at 0*55 18 hours afterwards in the height of the febrile reaction , and at 1 01 3 ays later .
# In the latter case , the opsonic index of the blood stood at 0 67 imme ia e y before the inoculation of 1 millegramme of the old tuberculin .
It stood next day at 0*4 , and 8 days later at 0*76 .

Action on [ July 26 , Principle upon which the Patients were Selected and General Procedure 1 Followed in Connexion with the Inoculations .
We have in our selection of cases been guided by the desire to deal at first only with the most aggravated and seemingly intractable cases of localised tubercular infection , and only with cases which would furnish unambiguous objective evidence of any progress or regress of the infection .
The general procedure followed was to begin in each case after the measurement of the content of the patient 's blood in tuberculo-tropic substances , with very small doses ( generally 1/ 500th milligramme ) of the vaccinating material , and to reinoculate at intervals of 10 days , retesting the blood on each occasion , and in the case of each patient expressing the results in the form of a curve .
In our earlier experiments , before we had elaborated the procedure for measuring the opsonic power of the blood , we were necessarily restricted to a measurement of the agglutinating power .
Data Furnished by the Measurement of the Agglutinating Power in the Case of Patients Undergoing Anti-Tubercle Inoculation .
The method of investigation here in question\#151 ; and we w'ould note that it had before us been employed by Koch in connection with inoculations of his T.R. tuberculin\#151 ; furnishes , it seems to us , indications which have a certain value .
An increase in the agglutinating power of the blood is generally , as in the cases tabulated below , obtained in the course of a successful immunisation .
It is , however , to be noted that the rise in the agglutination curve may occur long subsequent to the achievement of very marked clinical improvement , and further that such clinical improvement may be obtained quite apart from any sensible increase in the agglutinating power of the blood .

Dr. Wright and Capt. Douglas .
Action on [ July 26 , In addition to furnishing indications of successful advance in the direction of immunisation , the measurement of the agglutinating power of the patient 's blood may afford also indications of regress in the direction of increased susceptibility resulting from an overtaxing of the machinery of immunisation .
In exemplification of this we may quote three passages from the history of a patient ( E. S. Tables II and III ) with tubercular infection of the kidney and bladder , whose agglutination curve was followed for nearly 18 months .
The patient in question , who had in association with the inoculations set forth in Table II put on 5 lbs. in weight , received on April 30 , the date on which the record in Table II eloses , 0-025 milligramme on May 5 , 0 05 milligramme , and on May 13 , 0*2 milligramme of T.R. tuberculin .
In association with the first two of these inoculations , the agglutination curve sank away rapidly from 64 to 8 , the patient losing at the same time 3^ lbs. in weight , and suffering from considerable constitutional disturbance .
In association with the third of these inoculations the agglutinins disappeared entirely from the blood .
On a later occasion in the beginning of November , 1903 ; when the general condition of the patient had very markedly improved and when her body weight had increased by 23 lbs. , a similar negative phase effect accompanied by constitutional disturbance was obtained in association with the inoculation of three 1 milligramme doses of the T.R. tuberculin on November *2 , 6 , and 11 respectively .
Here the complete agglutination , which was on the first of these dates obtained in a 32-fold dilution of the serum , was obtained after the inoculations only in an 8-fold dilution .
Again , in the beginning of December when another attempt was made to press the inoculations , the agglutination curve , which had risen again to 32 after the inoculations referred to in the preceding paragraph , declined in consequence of two 1 milligramme inoculations , first to 8 and then to 2 , and the patient 's symptoms were aggravated .
A similar decline of the agglutiiiation curve has come under observation also in other cases in association with the premature increase of the dose of vaccine , and with the shortening of the interval between successive inoculations .
Data furnished by the measurement of the Opsonic Power of the Blood in the case of Patients undergoing Anti-tubercle Inoculations .
Much more valuable than the indications which can be gleaned from the measurement of the agglutinating power of the blood are the indications furnished by a measurement of the opsonic power of the patient 's blood .
While the measurement of the agglutinating power 1904 .
] the Tubercle Bacillus by Human Blood etc. 175 of the blood may fail to furnish indications of an abnormally low resisting power on the part of the untreated patient ; and while it may yield only tardy information of the alterations effected in the blodd fluids by inoculation ; and while it may sometimes altogether fail to distinguish between the patient 's condition before and after successful immunisation ; the measurement of the opsonic power satisfies it would seem all these desiderata .
We have already seen in Table I that it distinguishes* between the tubercular subject and the person with normal resistance .
And we shall see in the table below that it furnishes prompt and clear indication of the negative phase which supervenes upon inoculation , and again of the positive phase which succeeds the negative phase wherever the organism possesses the necessary power of response .
Furthermore the measurement of the opsonic power of the blood distinguishes clearly between the untreated tubercular patient and the patient who has made progress in the direction of immunisation .
This will appear clearly on comparing , in Table III below , the opsonic indices achieved after inoculation with those set forth in Table I. In conclusion we may note , that while we are jointly responsible for the observations set forth in Sections 1 , 3 , and 4 of this paper , the work which is embodied in Sections 2 and 5 has been separately undertaken by one of us .
# It will not , however , invariably do so .
