Part of a Letter from Mr. Micllael Topping , to Mr. Tiberius Cavallo , F. R. Ss Read February i6 , 1792 .
DEAR SIR , M(zdras , l ; eDezlary4 , I78g .
I ENCLOSE YOU all accoullt of a base lilae I have meastlred for a series of triangles I am carrying down the coast of Col^oX mandel .
I have already extellded them to about goo lniles from Madras , and am upon returning back to prosecute the work quite down to Cape Comorila .
the angles are all takell with my Hadley 's sextant , made by STANCLIFFE , by mealls of three ta11 signa]s I 1lave constrtlcted of baluboos , 80 feet laigll , 60 of which I mount upon steps , so as to see ( over all trees , &amp;c. ) very distinctly my two other signals , at the distance of from 8 to 13 luiles .
It is , I believe , the filst time the Hadley was ever made use of for a purpose of such magnitude ; but it is fully equal to it-nay , it does more the SU11'S bearing , or oblique distance , from my signals is also takell by it ; by which , and his azimutll ( computed ) I obtain the allgles made by them with the meridiall ; and by coznbining the whole , the difference Of latitude , and meridional distance of every otle of thenz ill English fatlloms .
This is fotllld so llicely , that a mean of my astronolllical observations for the latitudes , 1lever differs more than a few secollds from those given by the geometrical mensuration .
Ill all the operations I have had no olae to assist meexcept a party of black fellows to carry my flags .
I need nof tell you how many thousand iniles I have travelled to talfe the angles ; Ilor vllat the labour and fatigue of such a work must b-e in this burning climate , where I have frequently had the thermometer at oo60 in my tent .

a Xccount of the SIeasurement Qf a Base Lille upon the Sea Beach , near Porto NONTON on the Coast of Coromandel , ig Mayn 1y88y by Mr. Michael Topping .
As a-necessary fbuncition for the chain of triangles nosr carrying on , I have , for some time past , had Iny thoughts bent towards measuring , with all possible accuracy , a base lineo lthisbase line , could I havechoWs-en its situation , $ hold havebeen determinect as near the middle of the line of coast I am surveying as possible ; but circumstances have llot permitted me to make unrestrained choice-of its place .
0l1 toy arrival a-t Cuddalore , I was told that ?
as I proceecled southsrard , I shoulcl meet with firequent rivers , and otEler water courses , that would certainly obs--truct me in the desigtl I had formed of measuring it on the sea beach , farther soutla ; and , soon after my removal from that place , I:found , witha much satisfaction , that the coast , between : Cudclalore rlver and Porto Novo , wotlld serve my pu:rpose extremely verell .
The iach hereabouts is flat , broad , and remarkably smooth ; the only speciovis objection that can be made to it , is itsnot being straight , but forming a cur6red-line , concave tovards the sea .
This , however , I kncur to be , i-ureality , ofs nobad consequence , since , several right litles of sufficient length might , I perceived , be laleasured UpOll it ; the angles they might interchangeably malie , be taken ; and the whole aftervslards be reduced to one dWirect line by calculation .
These considerations , and an accident that , about the same time , befel one of my signals , and delayed my trigonometrical progress , finally determined no to measure my base at this opportunity ; and I accordingly begall that work by placing two of my large signals , at the distance ( as nearly as I could Judge ) of seven miles asullder , for the terlus or extremities of it .
In traversing the coust between theLsignals , I found that , in order to continue rey operations throughout upon the most advantageotls part of the beach I MUSt di-vide the whole distance into six distinct portions , each portion forming a large angl@ with the next portion to it : and this I immediately did , by placing-five lesser flags , at intervals conveni@nt for that purr pose .
I now began my measurement , in prosecuting whicEl I spared neither pains nor care .
Tlle two rods , of 25 feet eaclly hich I had provided for this use had teen strictly exaluirled while I was at Cuddalore , and their lerlgths ascertairled , as exactly as the conveniences this couAltry affords wtotlld admit ofs They had been left purposely a li-ttile tcro lorlx , as I fouzd it easier to detertnine , and allow br such excess , than to reduce then to sufficient exactness .
In settling their respective lengths , a capital two-feet brass sector by ADAMS was made use of , as a standard : this instrument was llOt only the best au-thority I could procure ; but , being my owm property , would .
&gt; I considered , be ready for an examitlation should al ; opportusnity arise of comparing it , in future with any measure of more acknvwledged creditz The thermometer stood at X70 when the rods were adjusted by it .
7Mbe stands which I had prepared for levelling the rodss were also brollght out ; and it was with much regret that I fiound I could not profit by them , as I had hoped to do , assisted as I was by none but black people , in whotn , I perceived , it would have been impossible , without incurring great loss of time , to have ilupressed a necessary idea of their nature and managetment .
I therefore resolved to dispense with the stands , and to 1ay the rods , erld to end , upon the ground .
1t was in a similar way that the base line for a series of triangles , continued throughout France ) was measured The French rodss which e7ere nearly of the same length and construction with mine , were disposedj in the very salale manner upon the rug ged pavement of a highway near Paris ; so that I have every reasotl to believe the opportullity here afforded me of a peculiarly level and sarldy beacla , to be the best of the two .
The mode of conducting the measllrement was thIS:-Staves were first set up , in a direct line , between the flags ; from every two of these staves a rope was occasionally stretched , as tight as possible , on the groundv and the rods were laid by the side of the ropew The first rod being properly placed , the second was laid nedr its end , and then very carefiully adjusted , so as to touch the ferrule of the other , by a lnan , &gt; tho hal no other employment to engage his attelltion ; and in the performance of this ofEce he was closely watched by myself .
The ferrulesj which were of thick brass , had been rollnded , not only to make the contact more visible , but because the length of each rod was determined , by their having the spherical figure , More easilyG At the placing of every second rod , which was paint ( l white to dlistinguish it ft om the other , I registered its number myself in a book , ruled purposely writh colutulas , each column containing ten ntltnbers : my writer did the same in another book : besides which , an attendarlt , who was -furnished with ten small sticksS gave the Tindal , who also assisted ila keeping the reckoning , one of them every time the white rocl was laid down ; and each tnarl made his separate report to me every teIath number .
By these precautions , almost all possibility of a mis-reckoning was prevented ; and we accordingly found no disagreement throughout .
The whole distance was afterwards re-measured , and gave correctly the same number of rous At the conclusion of each several measurement , that I might krlow exactly where to resume it , a stake , three or four feet long , was driven into the ground , till its head lvecame even with the surface .
0n the top of this stake the but of the last rod was laid ; and a line drawn across it utith a pointed instrument , showed precisely where to re-comluerlce the work .
The heads of these stakes served likewise as fixed marks on whichg at any time , to place the five smaller flags , or the instrument-for taking the requisite angles .
The sum of the six measured lines amounted , by the first trial , to seven bundred double rods , twenty feet szx inches and a half ; and by the second , to seren hundred double rabls , twentytwo feet elezoen inches and a hcllf ; their difference being two feet , four inc1pes and a balf ) by which the second measulement exceeded the first .
The shortest of these measures is made use of , as operations of this nattlre ha^Ze always a terldency to excess , rather than deficiency .
Besides this linear measurement seven esserltial angles were taken-(each angle several times over , for security ) with an excellent theodolite by RAMSDEN .
These were the angles formed , at each extremity of the base , by the nearest intermediate flag , and the relllote sigllal ; and those formed at each intermediate flag , by the nearest flag to it , on each halld .
The nature and purport of all this will be easily understood- , by inspecting the accompanying figures Tab III .

and attending to the following explanation and : DE1M0NST 1 &lt; AT ION e Le-t N and S represent the northern allcl southern signals3 placed at each extremity of the base line J. Let ABCDE represent the pOsitions of the five intermeliate flags , betweetl each of wlascil incltlding the tWQ signals , the six right lines , before luentioneds were measlared At each of these points the angle formed by the flag or signal , on each side of it , vas taken with the theodolite : for instance , at An the angle formed at that point by tI &lt; e rlorthern signal N , and flag B ( 97yo24/ 40 " ) ; at-B , the allgle formed by the flags A and C( 176 ' 23/ ) ; and so on .
At each end of the base line , the angle formed by the nea-rest flag and the distant signal\\rElS also talren ; : e. ge at X , theangle SNA , and at S ) the angle NSE .
These things being prenlised to filled the allgles the oth-er bur lines make with the base linen proceed in the following manner : Produce the line WA to 1( ; also the line BA to H ; and , through the pOillt A , draw FG parallel to NS , the base line .
IXrom the points ABCDE let fall pelpendiculars UpOll the base line , leeting it at OPQR and T The angles SNA , NA1R , GAK , are all equal ; for SNA and NAF are alternate-angles , formed by a right line falling u-two paralleis ( Euclid , 2gth , ost ) : and NAFn GAK , are equal angles , formed by the mutual intersection of two right lines:(Euclid tSthgg lst ) .

or the same reason , the angle NAH is equal to KAB , and HAF to GAB .
Now , the obtuse\#171 ; angle NAB , being known ( from obseraration ) , its supplemelat is equal to BAK mZhich , being subtracted from GAK , leaves the angle GAB require-d ; bymeans of whichs and the hypothenuse AB ; ( given by mensuration ) ) we obtaill the si(le AG o\#163 ; the rightangled triangle GAB , by plane trigonometry ; for as racl .
: cosine LGAB : : side AB : side AG .
Tllis computed side is equal to the opposite sidexOP of the rectangular parallelograln DPAG , which being added to the side NO of the right-angled triangle ONA ( found by the like analogy from the observed angle N ) and the neasured hypvthenuse NA ) gives the dis tance EI9P orl the base lineae Proceeding in like Illanner , Wltll the last found allgles to find the angles of the remailling triangles and thence their respec tive bases , we shall have the sides of the correspon(lilg rect bangles ; the sum ; of iwhich sicles , taken together , M ill be the -true measure of the base line NS .
: Supposing no imperfection in the instrument vitil svhcl the angles have been taken , and no error ( however small ) committed in taking the sis preceding alagles , then the angle XES , obtained by this method , will prove exactly equal to the allgle NSE , which may be had by observation .
Ill the present instarlce their difference amouIlt ; s to no nzore than 2t,5t .
In the exanaple lefore us , the obsersred angles are as followf from which we may easily deduce the lemaitling ones required 55DCC SC IIq P Allgle at No g6 ' 23o " iA 177 24 40 tB 176 23 0C 178 IS Allgle at D 1780 37 , solZ / E 177 20vS6 ss oI With which proceed thus : NAB 177 ' 24t 40 , , Its supplement from gl^res 2 t3tg 20 tS 36 30 tS 1 10 L required at A.

2l Jrl required at DS S7 s It is immaterial at which end of the base line we begin .
In thepresent case , in order to obtain as great precision as possible , the intermediate angles have heela deduced from both ends ; those at A and B , from the observation at N ; and the remaining ones at CD and E , from that at S. Had , however , this precaution been neglected , the error induced , by deriving the four required angles from either primitive , at N or S , would not have a-Sected the true length of the whole base line more than,27 of a footv or not quite so much as three inches and a quarter .
This xuethod of obtaining the measureEof an inaccessible line , where the measured lines every where make small angles M ith it , is a very accurate one ; for though , in oblique triallglesl small angles , from the difficulty of taking atagles per-fectly , are likely to prodtlce considerable errors , in right-angled triangles it is the very reverse ; as in them the smaller the angle taken the more accurate will be the result .

The tablen page 1 loX gieres the results of these obserarations , and the data from which they vere computed .
Nothing need be said of the two preceding tables , which sufficiently explai -thetmselsres .
The last tabIe contains meridional observations of stars for determning the latitude of each respective termination of the base line .
No observations were obtained at the 1lorthern extremity the weaJcIler proving uncommoraly cloudy while I was there ; and only three latitudes were observed at the south end The others were taken at my next southern -station and reducel to 1 ; he terms of the base by the adjacent triangles .
The difference of latitude between that station and the south end of thve base I found loy tneasurement to be 8201 yards , or + ' 't ; and the difference of latitudebetween the terms of the base St 42t .
For considering a portion of the -meridian passIng through either e-nd of the base , as the cosine of an arc , whose radius is 11636yards , andsubtense So28 ' &gt; 3g"weshallfindthe difference of latitude to be o614 yards- ' 42ft .
By a mean of all the astronomical observations , the south end of the base lies in latitude o 3t 22 ' } N ; the north end consequently lies in latitude 1 lo 39/ * , .
