On Bitumen in Stones .

] In this paper Mr. Knox details a series of experiments upon a great variety of mineral products , tending to show in them the frequent existence of bitumen , or some analogous substance ; and he calls the attention of analysts to this subject , as having frequently misled them in respect to the loss obtained by subjecting minerals to heat , which they have too commonly ascribed to the mere evaporation of aqueous matter .
Mr. Knox found bitumen in nearly all the minerals belonging to Werner 's Flotz Trap formation .
He also found it in a few of the substances appertaining to the older rocks ; but in the latter case it was smaller in quantity , and less easily separable .
In conclusion , the author recommends distillation as a process to be resorted to in all analyses of stony substances , with a view of obtaining the liquid bitumen which they may have contained , and also of estimating the proportion of carbon evolved in the state of gas .
The residuum , he observes , should be carefully examined for the remaining carbon .
