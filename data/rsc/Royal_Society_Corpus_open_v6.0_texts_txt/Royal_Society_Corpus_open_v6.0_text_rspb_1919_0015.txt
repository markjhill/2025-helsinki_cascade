Periodic Variations of Conductance of the Palm of the Human Hand .
By A. D. Wallek , M.D. , F.R.S. ( Received June 7 , 1918 .
) Introductory .
The present communication is in continuation of that made to the Royal Society on November 8 of last year .
At an early stage of the enquiry , I noticed that the emotive effect varied considerably in magnitude upon the same subject ( G. de D. ) according as she was rested or fatigued , and that it was usually larger during the day than late in the evening ; also that the electrical resistance was higher during the evening than during the day .
I also noticed on my own hand that the electrical resistance was much higher during the night than during the day , e.g. , 200,000 ohms at 2 a.m. as compared with 30,000 ohms at 2 P.M. , and that the electrical effects on the palm that accompany natural physiological discharges such as coughing , sneezing , and shouting , as well as the natural responses to a pin prick or burn , were remarkably small .
( At such time of depression , however , the electrical effect of yawning continued to be exceptionally distinct .
) VOL. xci.\#151 ; b. c Dr. A. D. Waller .
Later , when I had come to a definite opinion that the emotive effect is to be regarded as being due to diminished resistance ( = increased conductance ) rather than to increased electromotive force , I thought it necessary to take observations of the varying resistance of the palm of the hand at all hours of the day and night for periods sufficiently long to bring out the periodicity that appeared to affect the change under the ordinary conditions of daily life .
Obviously , an acquaintance with the normal variations of magnitude , apart from its intrinsic interest , is the indispensable preface to an exact study of the emotive response .
There is , in point of fact , a general relation between response and resistance that I am not yet able to state with sufficiently complete numerical evidence , but that I hope to deal with on a future occasion .
The particular object of this communication is to give the results of observation of the normal course of conductance values during the 24 hours on the palm of my own hand ( chiefly the left hand ) .
The series of values is tabulated and plotted .
The particular results systematically recorded for the left palm have been occasionally compared with measurements taken on the right palm and on other parts of my own person , as well as upon the palms and other parts of other persons at various times of day .
I find it impossible to avoid reference to theoretical considerations in A temperature curve for the ^i-tiour cycle Table I 10-8)2 8 12 4 8 ,12 4 8 Concerning Emotive Rhenomena .
connection with the possible significance of the results .
They illustrate in my view the close association between nutrition and what we call " emotion .
" This theoretical aspect of the facts will be given in a separate paragraph { infra , p. 27 ) , where reason is offered for placing the special class of emotive effects in the general category of trophic phenomena rather than in the special class of sudo-motor effects .

The ' diurnal periodicity apparent in these Tables is brought out most strikingly by converting them into average values at definite times of day and night .
When plotted , these average values give smoothed curves of the normal rise and fall of conductance during the 24 hours .
These curves have a course that runs approximately parallel with a normal temperature chart , and are therefore to be regarded as an indication of waxing and waning physiological activity .

) Nature of the Emotive Deflection ; its Measurement in Terms of EM .
F. and of Resistance ( ) .
The first question that presents itself in regard to an emotive deflection is whether the increase of current is due to increased electromotive force or to diminished resistance .
I have come to the conclusion that it is due to diminished resistance ( i.e. , increased conductance ) , for the following reasons :\#151 ; 1 .
An emotive deflection of high apparent voltage ( 05 volt and above ) , as shown by a galvanometer , is invisible on a capillary electrometer ( sensitive to 0-0001 volt ) .
2 .
During a persistent emotive deflection of high voltage , a superadded deflection , caused by throwing in an additional calibrating deflection , is augmented in proportion with the augmented conductivity , .
, during a persistent emotive deflection indicating a great diminution of apparent resistance to 20,000 ohms from an original 40,000 ohms ( i.e. , conductance x 2 ) , the deflection caused by a superadded calibrating voltage is doubled .
The emotive change of balance shown by a subject placed in the 4th arm of a Wheatstone bridge can be directly measured and expressed in ohms .
Or it can be measured and expressed in voltage by balancing against a potentiometer E.M.F. Or the emotive deflection can be directly measured and expressed in terms of voltage , by means of a calibrating deflection caused by known voltage .
I find it convenient to use a known fraction of a volt for the purpose of calibration , but to express results of experiment in terms of conductance , viz. , in reciprocal megohms ( y ) .
The original current is supplied by two Leclanchti cells = 2-8 volts .
A calibrating deflection by 02 and by 002 is suitable for low-power and high-power observations respectively , e.g. , the palm of the hand of a given subject in the 4th arm of a bridge is found to have a resistance = 20,000 ohms , i.e. , a conductance = 50 \lt ; y. An emotive deflection on the record is measured to be 25 mm. The calibrating deflection by Dr. A. D. Waller .
02 L is found to be 5 mm. The electromotive value of the emotive response is then +1 L or 1*4 volts .
Its conductance value is 25 7 by direct reading of the deflection or a rise of conductance from 50 to 75 7 ( or reciprocated into terms of resistance = a fall of resistance from 20,000 to 13,333 ohms , i.e. , a fall of 6667 ohms ) .
This fall of resistance can of course be tested by the balancing resistance , but only approximately , because it is a diminishing diminution ; in the present example it would be found between 6500 and 6000 ohms .
Therefore it is preferable to take out directly the conductance values of deflections with a properly calibrated instrument .
S 2 .
Method.\#151 ; By means of a recording galvanometer set up in my dressing room , I took photographic records for short periods ( as a rule two minutes , sometimes longer ) of the conductance of my left palm ( sometimes also of other parts ) at all hours of the day and night as happened to be convenient , and plotted the results during a series of days .
Becords were also taken when possible of other parts , such as the forearm , leg , and foot , for comparison with the palm or skin , which , as stated in my previous communication , is the principal instrument of emotive response .
The hand , galvanometer ( suitably shunted ) , and two Leclanche cells were put up in series , the galvanometer being adjusted by shunt so that a calibrating deflection through a resistance of 20,000 ohms ( = a conductance of 50 7 ) measured on the photographic plate as nearly as possible 50 mm. { i.e. , 17 = 1 mm. multiples and submultiples of this adjustment were taken when required ) .
In the first two series of observations ( Tables I and II ) the electrodes ( zinc discs 10 cm.2 , covered by chamois leather moistened with 06 per cent. NaCl solution ) were fixed to the palm and back of the hand by elastic bands .
For the third series ( Table III ) one electrode was slipped behind the closed lips against the tip of the tongue , and the other fixed to the palm as before , or used as an exploring electrode for other parts against which it was firmly held at the end of an insulating handle by the free hand .
This second or unipolar plan was adopted 'not only as a simplification for the summary comparison of different parts , but also in order to diminish the risk of surface conduction between adjacent electrodes .
I considered that an \#166 ; electrode in the mouth would be equivalent to an electrode applied to the internal surface of the skin , and be of negligible resistance as compared with the resistance of a second area of skin .
In justification of this presumption , I measured the resistance offered by : Concerning Emotive Phenomena .

The mechanical change by which spurious alterations of conductance are most liable to occur , is friction , however slight .
A twist of the exploring electrode gives large effects , and it is easy in this way by graduated torsion for a superficial experimenter to imitate the pattern of many kinds of physiological records .
Torsion applied at regular intervals is scarcely distinguishable from the staircase summation of effects caused by stimulation of muscle or nerve .
Similar photographic records have been made by the friction and torsion of vegetable stems and metallic rods , and given as proof of the life of plants and metals .
In the ordinary course a single galvanometer and recorder are used , and comparisons of different regions of skin are made by successive trials with the same apparatus .
For certain purposes such as , e.g. } observations of the comparative magnitude of emotive responses at different points to the same excitation , and observations of the gradual changes of conductance occurring in different parts , two galvanometers are used , giving two simultaneous records on the same photographic plate .
The resistance of the skin can be measured in the usual way by Wheatstone 's bridge , and for certain purposes this method is more convenient than the arrangement in series .
Both methods necessarily include as the chief factor of resistance the polarisation of the skin , which , in my view , is precisely the factor that alters under the influence of emotive effects .
I take this measurement by a constant current in preference to that of the strict ohmic resistance obtained by means of the Kohlrausch method with alternating currents , because polarisation is the substantial condition under which the emotive effects are manifested .
The ingenious and elegant experiment of Gildemeister , quoted in my first communication , appears Dr. A. D. Waller .
to me as having fully established the fact that emotive excitement causes no alteration of resistance apart from polarisation .
An emotive disturbance of balance shown by the galvanometer on the bridge , might be due to a diminution of the electromotive force of polarisation , or to a diminution of the resistance offered by the septum at which polarisation is effected ; in either of these cases the balance is restored by a diminution of the balancing resistance and the value of the diminution is .
read in ohms .
If a potentiometer is put in series with the subject in the 4th arm of the bridge as shown by the diagram we shall obtain indications that will enable us to decide between the two alternatives\#151 ; electromotive force increased or resistance decreased .
If the former a known E.M.F. from the potentiometer should give the same deflection before and during an emotive change .
If the latter the potentiometer deflection should be increased during the emotive change .
And in point of fact this second alternative is what actually occurs ; whenever I have measured the resistance in ohms before and during emotive excitement , I have found that the-potentiometer deflection was inversely proportional with the resistance .
The following , e.g. , were the scale readings of a particular observation:\#151 ; Balance .

The Question of Sweat .
Differences of resistance of different parts of the skin as well as alterations of resistance of a -given part , are most easily accounted for by attributing them to differences of perspiration .
No doubt this simple explanation is sufficient to account for many of the facts of the case , but it does not meet the whole case .
The skin of the palm of the hand is abundantly provided with sweat glands , and perspires freely , but it has a higher and more variable resistance than that of the skin of any other part of the body .
The skin of the forearm has relatively few sweat glands , and its resistance is lower than that of the skin of the palm .
Atropine which arrests perspiration by paralysing the sudo-motor nerves has , in my experience , no effect whatever upon the emotive response .
Arrest of the circulation of the limb by an Esmarch band does not influence the emotive response .
Immersion of the hand in hot and cold water do not appreciably affect it .
We are forced , Concerning Emotive Phenomena .
27 therefore , to look for a more comprehensive explanation than that of sudo-motor variation .
Admitting , as proved , that the emotive effect consists in a diminution of resistance , we may take the further step of supposing that the diminished resistance is caused by the expansion of ultra-microscopic pores in the membrane between living element and internal medium , and that polarisation at this membrane is diminished .
Or quite simply we may imagine that the expanded pores permit of an increased passage of ions .
On this view , while recognising that a certain association subsists between emotive and secretory events , we are to regard these events when occurring together as the conjoint results of a common cause rather than as successive results of each other ; they are to be regarded as occurring in parallel rather than in series , conjointly sometimes with other evident manifestations of increased physiological activity .
Outflow of water ( and discharge of carbonic acid and liberation of mechanical motion ) are final events of metabolism .
But events in the course of metabolism short of its final consummation give rise to nutritional or trophic changes which have their electrical aspect .
Emotive phenomena in my view belong to such previous and deeper changes , although they may also be manifested in company with the final and obvious events of metabolism in company with muscular movements or with sweat or with flushing , all of which are seen as concomitants of sufficiently intense emotion .
The ordinary visible signs of emotion\#151 ; muscular ( inclusive of vaso-motor , cardiac and intestinal ) , secretory ( inclusive of sweat flow and salivary secretion)\#151 ; are more or less under voluntary control and can to some extent be inhibited .
The emotive effects manifested electrically by the palm of the hand are not under voluntary control and cannot be inhibited .
Suppressed emotions are especially effective in respect of the palmar electrical sign , and this fact constitutes the chief practical value of the sign .
The more perfectly an examinee can control the visible signs of his emotion , the more violently is the galvanometer deflected through the palm of his hand by reason of his suppressed emotion .
The emotive phenomenon belongs to the category of trophic changes ; it is a sudden brief intensification of a slowly fluctuating state of nutrition .
I have become accustomed to designate the brief change alone as " emotive , " and to refer to the prolonged change alone as " trophic .
" I imagine the changes as brought about through what we are accustomed to designate as " trophic " nerve fibres , and find no necessity for invoking the existence of special emotive as distinct from general trophic channels , nor for assigning emotive effects to sudo-motor fibres exclusively , any more than to vasoDr .

motor fibres , or musculo-motor fibres .
The emotive effects are , in my view , essentially trophic ; in its fullest and most intense forms emotive discharge from the central nervous system may occupy any centrifugal nerve to any organ of the body .
Emotion may be manifested by a flow of tears , or an outbreak of sweat , by a frown or gesture , or verbal ejaculation ; if at such time we had the palm of the excited person connected with the galvanometer we should see an emotive deflection , but the latter is not due to the tears or sweat any more than to the muscular movement , and it may be most marked when all these ordinary signs of emotion are absent .
While it is , no doubt , true , that the deflection is due to diminished resistance , and that perspiration causes diminished resistance , it does not follow , logically , that the deflection is due to perspiration , since there are many occasions on which the emotive fall of resistance occurs without augmentation of either sensible or insensible perspiration .
I have utilised in justification of this last statement a test that I devised some years ago for the measurement of insensible perspiration.* A capsule containing a deposit of calcium chloride is left inverted against the palm of the hand for a period of , say , 10 minutes , and shows by its gain of weight the amount of water that has been " insensibly " exhaled and evaporated from the area covered by the capsule .
Thus , e.g. , the insensible perspiration in a room , with a temperature of 20 ' , was found to be for a period of 10 minutes from an area of 20 cm.2 : palm of the hand , 24 mgrm .
H20 ; flexor surface of the forearm , 5 mgrm .
H20 , the greater perspiration was from the skin of higher electrical resistance .
[ Note added , June 30.\#151 ; The statements made in this communication were supported by the following experiments carried out during the meeting ( June 27 ) .
First Experiment.\#151 ; Dr. Waller showed , with one electrode , A , on the palm of his left hand , and the other electrode , B , in his mouth , in series with two Leclanche cells and a galvanometer ( shunted)\#151 ; ( a ) That the conductivity of the palm was at once of a steady maximal value ( approximately 50 7 or 20,000 \amp ; \gt ; ) .
( 5 ) That alterations of contact at B , caused by movements of the tongue in speaking , caused no visible alteration of deflection , signifying that the resistance at B was of negligible value .
