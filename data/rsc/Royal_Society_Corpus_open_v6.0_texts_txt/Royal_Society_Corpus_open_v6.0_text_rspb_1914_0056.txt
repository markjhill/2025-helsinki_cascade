86 Mr. Hainan and Dr. Marshall .
( 6 ) There is no evidence of the existence of a compensatory mechanism-between the testes and the thymus .
The work was carried on at the Field Laboratories , Cambridge .
The operations were done by F. H. A. Marshall ; the weighings and the chief part of the other work by E. T. Hainan .
The expenses were defrayed by a grant made by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries out of funds placed at their disposal by the Development Commission .
Note by G. Udny Yule .
In view of the disagreement with Prof. Paton 's conclusions , Dr. Marshall asked me to investigate the probable errors of some of the comparisons made , with especial reference to the alleged effect of extirpation of the thymus on the growth of the testes .
The problem was not an easy one .
A glance at Prof. Paton 's figures , or at the corresponding data given by Hainan and Marshall , will show how exceedingly variable are the weights of the testes and how much caution must consequently be used before basing any conclusion on a small difference between the average weights for two groups of some 20 to 30 animals .
Considerable differences might be shown even by the averages of groups treated in precisely the same way .
Were the animals adult , the " probable error " of the difference between any two observed averages\#151 ; the amount which it would be as likely as not to exceed owing to mere fluctuations of sampling\#151 ; might be readily obtained in the ordinary way .
But the animals are not adult ; the weight of the testes increases very rapidly with the weight of the animal , and the weights of the different individuals themselves vary greatly , so that the two groups of operated and controls are not strictly comparable as a whole .
What I finally decided to do , therefore , was this : To obtain , by known methods , equations expressing as closely as possible the relation between mean weight of the testes and body-weight , for operated and for normal animals , and to see whether the constants in these equations differed more than could be expected owing to the chances of sampling alone .
As in Prof. Paton 's data the weight of testes did not seem to be a linear function of the body-weight , and it was these data that I first investigated , the logarithm of the testes-weight was substituted for the actual value , and this seemed to give an approximately linear relation , judging from the diagram ( fig. 6 ) .
The two equations , with the probable errors of the constants which I finally obtained from Prof. Paton 's data , including all the 23 normal Relation between the Thymus and the Generative Organs .

) and 24 thymusless animals , were , t being the testes-weight in decigrammes and b the body-weight in grammes :\#151 ; Thymusless ... ... .
log* = ( 0-00489 +0-00043 ) 04069+ 0-1065 , Controls ... ... ... log t = ( 0-00503 + 0-00025 ) 5\#151 ; 0-5193 + 0-0608 .
If the three normals and four thymusless whose body-weights are over 300 grm. be excluded , the results are :\#151 ; Thymusless ... ... .
log* = ( 0-00539 + 0-00051 ) 0-5097 + 01203 , Controls ... ... ... log* = ( 0-00501+0*00030)\amp ; -0-5156 + 0-0815 .
The probable errors must not be regarded as too precise , since they are obtained on the assumption of normal correlation , but they are likely to give a fair guide to the possible magnitude of fluctuations .
That of the coefficient of the body-weight ( the regression of the logarithm of the testes-weight on body-weight ) is the known value * 0-6745 .
Zn/ Qr.f ) , crzx/ n while for the constant term I find the probable error 0-6745 ( " ''(I -r\#187 ; ) \ n cr^n ] Mr. Hainan and Dr. Marshall .
where cr\ and tr2 are the standard deviations of log * and body-weights respectively , r is the correlation between them , n is the number of observations , and x2 is the mean body-weight .
Further , it may be noted that there is a high negative correlation between errors in the regression and in the constant term .
It is clear from the probable errors given that no stress can be laid on the differences observed , which lie well within the range of differences likely to occur owing to fluctuations of sampling alone ; equally unlikely or more unlikely differences might have occurred , I find , even had both groups been normal , once in some seven or eight trials .
Applying the same method to Hainan and Marshall 's data , I find for all the 65 controls and 70 thymusless animals:\#151 ; Thymusless ... ... .
log jf = ( 0-00319 \#177 ; 000020 ) 00384 + 0*0597 , Controls ... ... ... .
log* = ( 0-00367 \#177 ; 0*00015 ) 0-2032 \#177 ; 0*0441 ; and for the 43 controls and 49 thymusless under 300 grra .
, Thymusless ... ... .
log* = ( 0*00210 \#177 ; 0-00069 ) 0-2195 \#177 ; 01775 , Controls ... ... . .
log* = ( 0-00364\#177 ; 0*00057)\amp ; -0-2098 \#177 ; 0-1465 .
The difference between the constant terms in this last case looks large , but the probable errors are also very large , and the difference is less than twice its probable error , viz. , 0*2301 .
Summarising in the same way as before , I find differences as improbable as those observed might have arisen owing to fluctuations of sampling once in some five or six trials .
Hainan and Marshall 's data , it may be noted , do not include any animals under 200 grm. and few^ under 250 grm. and give a low correlation between body-weight and log ( testes-weight ) for the rather narrow available range of the non-adults .
Within the short range of body-weight 250-259 grm. , there are 22 thymusless and 17 controls , and it may be desirable to give a simple comparison for these to emphasise the magnitude of the probable errors .
For controls the mean testes-weight is 0*569 , with standard deviation 0*101 grm. ; for thymusless , mean 0-519 , with standard deviation 0-103 .
The difference , 0*050 , is therefore in the direction indicated by Prof. Paton 's views , but no stress can be laid on it , as it is only 2*25 times the probable error of the difference , viz. , 0*0222 .
Taking Paton 's and Hainan and Marshall 's data as a whole then , it seems impossible to regard any effect of extirpation of the thymus on the growth of the testes as proved ; if there is any such effect it seems clear that it is small .
The data stand in complete contrast with those relating to the effect of castration on the growth of the thymus .
Within the limits of body-weight in Hainan and Marshall 's data , there seems to be little relation between weight of thymus and body-weight , so the means may be compared directly .
I find :\#151 ; Relation between the Thymus and the Generative Organs .
89 21 castrated animals\#151 ; mean thymus weight , 0*557 grin .
; s.d. , 01104 grm. 27 controls\#151 ; mean weight of thymus , 0*331 grm. ; s.d. , 0*0785 grm. The difference is 0*226 grm. , and is 11*8 times the probable error of the difference , viz. , 0*0192 .
In the case of Prof. Paton 's data respecting the effect of simultaneous removal of the thymus and the testes on the rate of growth , the differences observed between operated and control animals seem to point to definite causation .
If his Tables III and IV are pooled together , giving 9 operated animals and 12 controls , the difference between the mean gains in weight ( viz. , 92*2 and 149*2 grm. ) is 4*1 times its probable error .
For Lot 4 of Table V there are only five animals a side , but the results are unusually uniform .
The mean gains in weight are 65 and 120 grm. , and the difference 6*6 times its probable error .
This result seems in direct conflict with Hainan and Marshall 's experiments ; they have pointed out above a possible cause for the divergence .
In the preceding , one or two results in probable errors have been given without proof .
I hope to publish the proof elsewhere shortly .
