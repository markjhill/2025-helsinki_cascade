Of the difference of longitudes found by chronometer , and by correspondent eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter ; with some supplementary information relative to Madras , Bombay , and Canton ; as also the latitude and longitude of Point de Gall and the Friar 's Hood .

Of the difference of longitude found by chronometer , and by corres .
pondent eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter .
IN my former Paper , I mentioned these methods of finding the longitude , after the distance of one point from a first and distant meridian had been correctly established , and at the same time carried both into practice ; the former , in deducing the longitude of Bombay , and the latter , in the operation for the longitude of Calcutta ; and I bring forward the following observations by these methods , to show what may be effected in practice by either , where the instruments are good , and the necessary precautions have been taken .
The observations at Masulipatam were taken by the late Mr. TOPPING , those at the Observatory , by myself .
The telescopes at both places were the same in construction and magnifying power.* Madras Observatory and Masulipatam Flag Staff .

The following information may be deemed supplementary to that given in rmy former paper on the Geographical situation of the three Presidencies , and it is hoped will be found useful to navigators .
At Madras , the Fort Flag Staff is about 1",6 north , and X east of the Church Steeple .
This gives for the latitude of the Flag Staff 1i§ 4'47 " north , and longitude 80§ 19 ' 44 " E. As navigators generally take their departure from the Flag Staff , I have deemed it proper to give its situation , as well as that of the Steeple , given in the former paper .
The tide on the coast about Madras seldom rises more than g feet ; and it is high water on the Syzigies , by my observations , at qh 25m .
The variation of the compass towards the end of 17,92 , on the coast , about a degree to the northward of Madras , was § 3 ' east , by numerous observations .
At Bombay , the time of high water on the Syzigies , at the Dock Head , from several observations which I made , was 11h 32m .
The pilots generally allow 1lh as the time .
The greatest rise of the tide at the Dock Head was i8 feet .
This happened at the springs near the vernal equinox of 179g1 ; and except from particular combinations , it is never known to rise higher : as I was informed , the medium rise of the springs is about 152 feet .
The variation of the compass in the beginning of the year 1791 , by the mean of many observations , I found to be 42 ' 59 " , or 43 ' west .
During the passage from Bombay to Madras , I had an opportunity of ascertaining the latitude and longitude of Point de Gall , and of the Friar 's Hood ; and as the chronometer performed so well , it is to be regretted we did not see other places on the way .
Point de Gall is , however , an important position to have accurately determined , and in the year 1791 , the longitude deduced from different observations varied from 80 1 ' 33o'1 to 80§ 22 ' .
On the 8th of September we saw Point de Gall Flag Staff .
Three bearings of it were taken with the azimuth compass ; one when it was E. 8§ 24 N. ; a second when it was N. 28§ 38 ' E. ; and the third when it was due north .
The time when each bearing was taken was correctly noted ; and a base , measured by the run of the ship , corrected for current , was used for finding the distances , which , at the time the first bearing was taken , was 5,5 miles , and at the time the second was taken 3,7 .
The ship being in the longitude of Point de Gall at the time the third bearing was taken , no distance was necessary .
Altitudes for finding the longitude by the chronometer were observed about half an hour before the first bearing was taken , which was at 5h 45 ' p. m. apparent time .
These altitudes give for the longitude of the ship at 5h 1o ' p.m. , ( by mean of two days observations after my arrival at Madras , and allowing 80§ 19 ' 42 " as the longitude of the Church ) 80§ 9 ' 6 " , the latitude of the ship being at that time 6 ?
0 94 " N. ; the difference of latitude and difference of longitude made by the ship to the times the bearings were taken , being of latitude 9 ' 4 " S. and 4 ' 25 " S. ; of longitude 2 ' 27 " E. 6 ' 6 " E. and 8 ' " E.

Three bearings of the Friar 's Hood were also taken on the loth of September with an azimuth compass : one when we were nearly in the latitude , and another when in the longitude of the Hood .
The same care was taken in finding the distances , &amp;c. ; and the latitude of the Hood was found to be 7§ 29 ' 35 " N. ; longitude 8 1§ 36 ' 3 " E. It will no doubt be concluded , that where so much attention was paid to have the correct bearings and distances , that the meridianal observation for the latitude , and the altitudes for the longitude , were taken with a sextant:-this was the case ; and two sets of the latter were always observed .
About the time the earliest of the observations mentioned in my former paper were taken , three correspondent eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter had been observed at Canton , by Captain HUDDART , and at Calcutta , * which gave the difference of longitude of those places 24§ 54 ' .
