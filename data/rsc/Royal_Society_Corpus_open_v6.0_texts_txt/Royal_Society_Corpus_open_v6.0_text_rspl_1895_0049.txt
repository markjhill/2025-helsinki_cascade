Observations have been made of the gases obtained from the mineral eliasite heated in vacuo , in the manner which I have described in a former paper , * and , in addition to lines of known gases , others have been noted , for which no origins can be traced , at the following wave-lengths :\#151 ; Angstrom .

[ Nov. 21 , The wave-lengths of these lines have been determined by means of a Steinheil spectroscope having four prisms , comparisons being made with adjacent metallic lines , and the positions interpolated by micrometric measurements ; the accuracy may perhaps be taken to be within OT tenth metre .
Other lines have been noted , but they are not included in the list , for the reason that their wave-lengths have not yet been determined with the dispersion stated above .
Of the lines in the foregoing list , six are in all probability coincident with chromospheric lines , as shown in the following table , which also indicates the frequencies and brightnesses of the lines according to Young:\#151 ; Wave-length of Chromospheric Lines .

Lor instance , in the first two specimens of the mineral no trace of D3 was noted , but in the third portion examined , all coming from the same specimen , D3 appeared as a pretty bright line .
Again , as in the case of a previous operation on broggerite , ^ in one experiment with eliasite the products of distillation , collected in four stages , gave different spectra .
These facts seem to indicate that the gas obtained from eliasite is either a compound or a mixture of gases , just as is that obtained from broggerite according to former experiments .
It is also to be remarked that among the lines in the eliasite spectrum , those at 6122*4 and 6065*7 have been recorded in the gases obtained from cleveite , and 6122*4 has also been noted in the gas obtained from gummite .
It seems to be more than probable , therefore , that the lines observed in eliasite indicate a new gas , in some way associated with those given off by cleveite and broggerite , and the fact that D3 is not necessarily present in the spectrum , furnishes an additional argument in favour of the view that the gas obtained from cleveite or broggerite is complex .

] On the Gases obtained from the Mineral Addendum .
Received November 18 .
The results in the foregoing paper depend upon eye observations on the red end of the spectrum .
Since it was communicated to the Society the blue end has been investigated photographically .
Many specimens of eliasite have been distilled , and numerous photographs of the spectra of the gases given off have been taken .
The work has been rendered difficult by the very small quantity of what I believe to be a new gas , and the large quantity of carbonic acid , nitrogen , and hydrogen given off from the mineral .
Attempts have been made to get rid of the known gases , in order to make the lines of the new gas better visible , and then the amount of gas was in most cases very small and at times admixed with argon produced by the sparking .
The photographs have been measured and reduced , and it is probable that the lines , or some of them , which cannot be ascribed to any known gases , may belong to the same gas as that giving the lines observed in the red .
I append a table of some of these lines , which suggest possible coincidences in stellar and solar spectra ; the numbers in brackets indicate the intensities of the lines , 6 being the maximum in the case of \#171 ; Cygni , and 10 the maximum in the case of the eclipse spectrum .

" ( 3 ) In addition to the above lines there are others with which no celestial coincidences have been traced .
Some of the unknown lines at first noted in the red have been observed again in the gases obtained from other specimens ; it is important to note that remarkable variations in the spectra have been observed in passing from one specimen to another .
Although the evidence in favour of a new gas is already very strong , no final verdict can be given until the spectra of all the known gases , including argon , have been photographed at atmospheric pressure and the lines tabulated .
This part of the inquiry is well in hand .
