December 14 , 1843 .
The MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON , President , in the Chair .
A paper was read , entitled , " Researches into the Structure and Development of a newly-discovered Parasitic Animalcule of the Human Skin , the Entozoon folliculorum .
" By Erasmus Wilson , Esq. , Lecturer on Anatomy and Physiology in the Middlesex Hospital .
Communicated by R. B. Todd , M.D. , F.R.S. The animalcules which are the subject of this paper were discovered above a year ago by Dr. Simon , who published a description of their structure in the number of Miiller 's ' Archiv , ' &amp;c. for June 1842 .
This description was found by Mr. Wilson , who devoted to the investigation six months of exclusive labour , to be , in many essential particulars , exceedingly inaccurate and erroneous .
The present paper contains the principal results of the author 's researches on these singular animalcules , which inhabit the sebaceous follicles of the human skin , and feed on the secretions that surround them .
The author enters into minute anatomical details of the structure of the various organs , and more particularly of the apparatus by which the head is retracted within the thorax , of the eyes , of the ova , and the remarkable embryonic forms which are presented in the progress of development of the young animal .
He applies to this animalcule the term entozoon , merely as signifying an inhabitant of the interior of the body , and until a better and more appropriate appellation shall have been assigned to it .
A paper was also in part read , entitled , Miscellaneous Observations on Animal Heat .
" By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. The President announced from the Chair , that Mir .
Charles Richard Weld had been appointed Assistant Secretary .
