" On the Blow-hole of the Porpoise .
" By Francis Sibson , Esq. Communicated by Thomas Bell , Esq. , F.R.S. The external opening of the air-passage of the porpoise is so situated at the upper part of the head as to admit of the animal 's breathing while only a small portion of its head is above the water .
In its descent through the skull , between the cranial and facial bones , the tube is divided by a thin plate of bone into two nasal canals , which form , below this partition , a single muscular tube opening at its lower part into the pharynx by a constricted aperture , through which the larynx projects upwards quite through the pharynx , dividing it into two channels .
A series of pouches , five in number , capable of great dilatation , and provided with a muscular apparatus for retaining or expelling their contents , communicate by large orifices with the nasal canals , and appear to correspond in situation with the antra , frontal sinuses and ethmoid cells .
The author gives a minute anatomical description of these muscles , and an account of their modes of action ; the adjustments of the apparatus being such that the outer passage may be closed or opened above or below the anterior pouches .
When the outer passage is closed , the posterior pouches can be distended and the anterior emptied ; while the converse may be effected when the passage is open .
The use of the pouches appears to be to buoy up the head , so that on the porpoise rising from deep water , the opening for breathing comes first to the surface and admits of the animal 's sleeping in that position , while its whole body remains immersed in the water .
