] IN continuation of our investigations of the thermal properties of pure liquids , we have now determined the vapour-pressures , -densities , and expansion in the liquid and gaseous states , of Propyl Alcohol , and from these results we have calculated the heats of definite alures .
range of temperature is from to , and the range of pressm.e from 5 mms .
to 56,000 mms .
Propyl .\mdash ; A sample of propyl alcohol was procured from KAHLBAUM , of Berlin .
It was dried with barium oxide , and then with small quantities of sodium ; but in this case the results were not neal .
lie so satisfactory as with methyl and ethyl alcohol , propyl alcohol is soluble in water , forming a mixture or " " hydrate which boils constalltly at a lower temperature than the pure alcohol .
It is not completely decomposed by sodium , and can be separated only by repeated fractional distillation .
This hydrate was first described CHANCEL ( ' Comptes Rendus , ' vol. , p. 659 ) , who , observing that ib boiled with perfect constancy , assumed that it possessed a definite composition , and gave it the formula It has more recently been examined by KONOWALOW ( WIEDEMANN'S ' Annalen , ' vol. 14 , 1881 , p. 34 ) , who has determined the vapour-pressures of varying mixtures of propyl alcohol and water at definite temperatures .
KONOWALOW finds that the composition of the mixture , the .
of which exerts the greatest pressure , is the same at different temperatures , but that the mixture contains more alcohol at high temperatures than at low .
From this it has been concluded that the composition of the " " hydrate " " must depend on the pressure under which the liquid is distilled .
We have proved tally that this is the case ( but we reserve a discussion of this interesting substance for a future paper ) , and we give the results of our experiInents in an Addendum to this paper .
After repeated fractionation we succeeded in obtaining a quantity of alcohol which boiled almost constantly at ( the of temperature during distillation being less than ) under a pressure of mms .
This sample was employed for determination of vopour-pressures low temperatures , and for the constants at high temperabures with quantities , and ( see p. 140 ) .
The specific gravity of the alcohol was determined several months later , and a fresh quantity of the alcohol was from the hydrate into which the.greater part of the alcohol had been conyerted .
The hydrate was treated with dry potassium rbonate , when , as described by CHANCEL ( loc. cit. ) , two layers were , the owerl one being an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate , the upper one consisting of the partially hydrated alcohol .
The alcohol was fractionated several times , otsssium carbonate being each time added to the most volatile distillate , until a quantity was ed , boiling from to under a pressure of 752 mms .
For the determinations of yapour-density at high temperatures with quantity , the alcohol was refractionated .
The employed boiled constantly at under a pressure of mms .
Reduced to 760 .
these temperatures would be ( 1 ) ; ( 2 ) The boiling-point of propyl alcohol has been determined by numerous experienters , and the results obtained by several are very concordant ; the most reliable appear to be the following : \mdash ; Obsctver .

of Propyl Alcohol at Definite yolumes .
In our previous papers we have given tables of the volumes of a gram of substance at definite temperatures and pressures .
We have recently shown , however , in two papers read before the Physical Society of London and published in the 'Philosophical Magazine ' ( May and August , 1887 ) , that , when the volume of a stable liquid or gas is kept constant , a very simple relation exists between the pressure and the absolute temperature , which is expressed by the equation where is the pressure , the absolute temperature , and and are constants depending on the substance nd on the volume occupied by a gram of it .
We have , therefore , considered it better to construct lines of equal volume or 'isochors , \ldquo ; and to read te1nperatures and pressures from the isochors , rather than to read the volumes of a gram isobars constructed from the isotherms .
Owing to the directions assumed by the isochors , it is most convenient to give ON EyAPORATION AND DISSOCIATION .
temperatures ( Centigrade ) at definite for volumes below the critical volume , and pressures at definite temperatures for larger volumes .

It is , however , possible to give a few pressures at even volumes and temperatures , and these , and also the pressures in the following table for volumes up to 30 c.cs .

Volumes Critical Volume .
These pressures agree very well with those read directly from the isotherms , except near the condensing point at low temperatures , and to a much smaller extent at high temperatures .
The greatest error is at the lowest pressure at , and amounts to per cent. The approximate critical temperature of propyl alcohol is 26 7 , the approximate critical pressure 38,120 mms .
, and the approximate volume of 1 c.cs .
The first two of these constants must be very nearly correct ; the third cannot be determined with nearly the same accuracy .

ADDENDUM .
( Added February 11 , 1889 .
) The conclusions of KONOWALOW ( loc. cit. ) regarding the nature of the so-called hydrate of propyl alcohol have been fully confirmed .
It found that the compo- sition of the mixture , which boiled constantly under a pressure of mms .
, differed from that obtained under the ordinary atmospheric pressure ; the lower ] pressure , the higher is the percentage of water in the distillate .
The boiling-points of four different samples of the mixture were determined under pressures varying from 746 to 762 mnls .

) , 1.58 AND SSOC I It will be seen that the results by the statical method are uniformly a very little higher th by the dynamical method .
The behaviour of the substance resembles imperfectly purified stable substance more closely than that of a dissociating body .
A considerable number of of vapour-density were made under varying conditions of temperature and pressure .
It was proyed , however , that condensation\mdash ; probably of water\mdash ; took place on the sides of the tube , and the results at the same temperature and sure could be made to vary considerably by the conditions in such a manner as to increase or dimimsh the chance of such conden sation taking place .
The rise of yapour-density at low temperatures or high pressures was in no case greater than could be accounted for by premature condensation of liquid , and the only conclusion to be drawn from the results is that combination of propyl alcohol and water does not take place in the gaseous state .
The contraction on mixing propyl alcohol and water at , in the ratio of per cent. of alcohol to of water , was ascertained by determining the specific grayities of the alcohol and of the mixture , that of water being known .
For 1 .
of the mixture the contraction was c.c. , or per cent. With ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol the contraction is considerably greater .
Ib may be stated , in conclusion , that we have obtained no experimental eyidence of chemical combination between propyl alcohol and water .

of Propyl Alcohol at Definite yolumes .
In our previous papers we have given tables of the volumes of a gram of substance at definite temperatures and pressures .
We have recently shown , however , in two papers read before the Physical Society of London and published in the 'Philosophical Magazine ' ( May and August , 1887 ) , that , when the volume of a stable liquid or gas is kept constant , a very simple relation exists between the pressure and the absolute temperature , which is expressed by the equation where is the pressure , the absolute temperature , and and are constants depending on the substance nd on the volume occupied by a gram of it .
We have , therefore , considered it better to construct lines of equal volume or 'isochors , \ldquo ; and to read te1nperatures and pressures from the isochors , rather than to read the volumes of a gram isobars constructed from the isotherms .
Owing to the directions assumed by the isochors , it is most convenient to give ON EyAPORATION AND DISSOCIATION .

It is , however , possible to give a few pressures at even volumes and temperatures , and these , and also the pressures in the following table for volumes up to 30 c.cs .

Volumes Critical Volume .
These pressures agree very well with those read directly from the isotherms , except near the condensing point at low temperatures , and to a much smaller extent at high temperatures .
The greatest error is at the lowest pressure at , and amounts to per cent. The approximate critical temperature of propyl alcohol is 26 7 , the approximate critical pressure 38,120 mms .
, and the approximate volume of 1 c.cs .
The first two of these constants must be very nearly correct ; the third cannot be determined with nearly the same accuracy .

ADDENDUM .
( Added February 11 , 1889 .
) The conclusions of KONOWALOW ( loc. cit. ) regarding the nature of the so-called hydrate of propyl alcohol have been fully confirmed .
It found that the compo- sition of the mixture , which boiled constantly under a pressure of mms .
, differed from that obtained under the ordinary atmospheric pressure ; the lower ] pressure , the higher is the percentage of water in the distillate .
The boiling-points of four different samples of the mixture were determined under pressures varying from 746 to 762 mnls .
; correct'ed to 760 , the temperatures observed were , and \mdash ; mean The vapour-pressures were determined by both the dynamical and statical methods , with the following results : \mdash ; Jlethod .

) , 1.58 AND SSOC I It will be seen that the results by the statical method are uniformly a very little higher th by the dynamical method .
The behaviour of the substance resembles imperfectly purified stable substance more closely than that of a dissociating body .
A considerable number of of vapour-density were made under varying conditions of temperature and pressure .
It was proyed , however , that condensation\mdash ; probably of water\mdash ; took place on the sides of the tube , and the results at the same temperature and sure could be made to vary considerably by the conditions in such a manner as to increase or dimimsh the chance of such conden sation taking place .
The rise of yapour-density at low temperatures or high pressures was in no case greater than could be accounted for by premature condensation of liquid , and the only conclusion to be drawn from the results is that combination of propyl alcohol and water does not take place in the gaseous state .
The contraction on mixing propyl alcohol and water at , in the ratio of per cent. of alcohol to of water , was ascertained by determining the specific grayities of the alcohol and of the mixture , that of water being known .
For 1 .
of the mixture the contraction was c.c. , or per cent. With ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol the contraction is considerably greater .
Ib may be stated , in conclusion , that we have obtained no experimental eyidence of chemical combination between propyl alcohol and water .
