Bismuth : its Separation from , and its Refining Action upon same during the Process of Separation.\#151 ; In bringing the above subject under notice , it is necessary to allude to some of the facts distinguishing this very interesting metal .
Bismuth , in some of its important characteristics and reactions , resembles lead .
And one of the chief points of resemblance between these metals is their ready oxidation , and their absorption by bone-ashes or wood-ashes whilst so oxydised .
I refer of course , to the process of cupellation .
This ancient and serviceable process , still employed universally for the separation of gold and silver from lead , is equally applicable to bismuth , if associated with these precious metals ; and , like lead , bismuth may be readily employed as a vehicle or means of collecting gold and silver from their ores in reduction processes ; but its comparative cost accounts for its non-employment in this respect .
Commercially speaking , bismuth differs from lead in its greater value , lead being worth at present \#163 ; 13 to \#163 ; 14 per ton , * whilst bismuth realises between \#163 ; 700 and \#163 ; 800 per ton ; this high value being due to its greater rarity and to its limited and special uses .
As is well known , bismuth ores are frequently auriferous ; and one of the points which it is my desire to bring under notice is the effectual separation of the gold from bismuth by a rapid and efficacious process .
Of course , nothing could be easier than to separate these two metals by the ordinary process of cupellation .

[ Feb. 10 , means , is at once rendered available , but with the drawback that not only is there a very considerable loss of bismuth by volatilisation during the cupellation , but the subsequent recovery of the metal , which in the state of oxide has been absorbed by the cupel , is rendered necessary , involving a tedious and troublesome smelting operation , the employment of expensive fluxes , and a further considerable loss of metal .
Bearing in mind the close resemblance of bismuth to lead in its behaviour in the cupellation process , I directed my attention to its separation from gold by means of the addition of a small proportion of zinc\#151 ; a method known as the Parkes process , as employed for the separation of silver from lead .
And this I found successful , the natural separation of these two metals during the process of cooling proving to be similar in both cases .
The operation as carried out by me is as follows :\#151 ; The Bismuth holding the gold is melted at the ordinary temperature , about two per cent , of melted zinc is then added , and the whole brought to a dull red heat .
The alloy is then well stirred , and the temperature gradually lowered .
When at a black heat the slight crust formed on the surface is skimmed off and the metal again treated with a further quantity of zinc at the higher temperature .
The whole of the gold will be found in these skimmings , and the bismuth will be thus freed from it .
The skimmings , consisting of bismuth , gold and zinc , and zinc oxide , I now treat by a process which quickly renders the gold available , and at the same time has the effect of refining the gold from all impurities excepting silver during the actual process of extraction .
This small proportion of bismuth litharge and its charge of gold is fused in a clay crucible with a little borax , and allowed to cool down in the crucible , or it is poured into a mould with the bismuth litharge , which being perfectly liquid , allows the metallic gold to separate by its own gravity , and during its fusion absorbs any base metals associated with it as oxides .
The bismuth , in fact , acts as a refining agent to the gold , which , when cold , is detached from it .
This bismuth slag is broken up , re-fused with a little metallic bismuth , and is so freed from the last trace of gold which is collected by the bismuth , and subsequently extracted .
The bismuth .litharge so freed from gold is then reduced by fusion with carbon to its metallic state .
The quantity of bismuth litharge holding the gold is exceedingly small in proportion to the bulk of metal originally treated , as the figures hereinafter given will show ; but , by this process the bismuth is at once freed from its gold contents with little time , labour , or expense .
I have continuously carried out this method of treatment with the 1887 .

91 most satisfactory results .
It will only be necessary to take the figures of one operation as an illustration .
, " A quantity of 9483 lbs. of bismuth , holding about one per cent , ol impurity , and 12*5 ounces of gold per ton ( equal to 53*5 ounces in the bulk ) , was so treated , and of this nearly 9000 lbs. was imme-diately rendered available for commercial use , the skimmings , which amounted to 658 lbs. ( 7'30 per cent , of the bulk ) , containing the whole These skimmings I oxidised by means of nitric acid , thus obtaining the greater proportion of the bismuth and what little copper there was in solution , from which the bismuth was precipitated by the ordinary method , care being taken to saturate the nitric acid by extracting the greater portion of the bismuth as nitrate , so as to leave a portion of the bismuth as oxide with the gold in order to refine it from the impurities existing as oxides when fused with it .
This residue , collected and dried , was , when dried , fused in clay crucibles , with a small quantity of borax , yielding the full amount of gold shown by assay .
As before stated , in these fusions the metallic gold separates from the bismuth litharges , and descends to the bottom of the crucible by its own gravity .
The liquid and supernatant bismuth litharge floats upon it and breaks away readily when cold , the gold so obtained being associated only with silver , both metals being in fact refined by the action of the bismuth litharge .

Separation of Bismuth from The difficulty surrounding the treatment of bismuth associated with other metals by any rapid or comprehensive process is well known to the metallurgical chemist .
I believe I am correct in stating that hitherto the only process employed for the refining of bismuth on the Continent\#151 ; notably in Saxony , the chief continental source of this metal\#151 ; has been that of chlorination and subsequent precipitation , a process tedious in itself and involving much plant and labour in comparison with the quantities of metal operated upon .
Rapidity of production with a minimum margin of loss , in order to free the metal from its impurities and render it marketable as quickly as possible , being a great desideratum , induced me to turn my attention to its refining by dry processes .
In carrying this out I have found present most of the metals which are easily seized by and become associated with the bismuth itself during the process of reduction from its ores , * such as antimony , arsenic , tellurium , lead , copper , \amp ; c. , \amp ; c. , all of which I have successively and successfully dealt with .
It is not my intention in this paper to describe the processes adopted for the elimination of these several metals , but to confine * See Table of Analyses herewith .

[ Feb. 10 , myself to the separation of lead , the presence of which especially presented at first great difficulties .
As stated above , I have found that I can separate one by one the metals mentioned above , all of which have been associated with crude bismuth which has come under my notice .
In this , success though gradual , has been complete : but I was still confronted by the fact that the lead alloy was retained by the bismuth with a most characteristic persistency which seemed to defy all efforts of separation excepting by tedious wet or acid processes .
The amount of lead existing in the bismuth I operated upon , after freeing it by dry processes from its other impurities , varied from 2 to 10 per cent. Bearing in mind the respective fusing points of lead and bismuth , it occurred to me that , as alloys of bismuth and lead fuse at a temperature considerably lower than that of bismuth itself , separation would possibly take place between the two metals at a certain point of cooling ; I therefore made the following experiment:\#151 ; Taking a quantity of bismuth ( about 10 cwt .
) , holding 11*5 per cent , of lead , and fusing same , I allowed the metal to cool until the major part of it had crystallised , then removing the fluid portion .
The residue showed by assay only 6'35 per cent , of lead , pointing at once to the partial separation I had hoped for .
These crystals again similarly treated showed only 3'75 per cent , of lead .
The operation repeated gave crystals with only 2 per cent , of lead , and a fourth crystallisation brought this down to below 05 per cent. As a matter of possible interest , I subjoin the progressive results during the crystallising operations of several lots up to the point of bulking , and of finally separating every trace of lead:\#151 ; Bismuth holding 14-6 per cent.

By the above it will be seen that the process becomes an exceedingly simple one , large quantities being treated at one time , involving little or no loss , and occupying hours , instead of possibly weeks .
To illustrate the facilities of the separation of lead and bismuth alloys , I give the following figures from metal holding originally five per cent , of lead .
10,675 lbs. produced , in the course of six to seven crystallisations , 9306 lbs. of available bismuth , the residue 1188 lbs. holding 40 per cent , of lead , so that from a quantity of nearly 5 tons of bismuth and lead alloy only about half a ton remained , holding practically the whole of the lead ; the bulk of the bismuth separated by simple crystallisation holding traces only of lead , which , if necessary , could be readily eliminated by further crystallisation .
From these facts it is apparent that the separation of these two metals can be effected by turning to account their relative fusing points .
