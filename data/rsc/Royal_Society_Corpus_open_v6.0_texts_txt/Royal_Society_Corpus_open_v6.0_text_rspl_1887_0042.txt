) The behaviour of iron and steel when subjected to very strong magnetising forces is a matter of considerable practical and very great theoretical interest , especially from its bearing on the molecular theory of magnetisation , which assigns an upper limit to the intensity of magnetism that a piece of iron can acquire , and even suggests that the metal may become diamagnetic under the influence of a sufficiently great force .
All experiments hitherto made , by magnetising iron in the field of an electric solenoid , have shown that the intensity of magnetism |f , as well as the induction |p , is increasing with the highest values actually given to the magnetising force || .
It is scarcely practicable , however , to produce by the direct action of a magnetising solenoid , a field whose force exceeds a few hundreds of C.G.S. units .
To refer to a few recent experiments of this classIn experiments by one of us* on the magnetisation of long wires , the highest value of P applied to iron was about 90 , and this gave an induction of 16,500 in a soft iron wire .

of 240 gave 19,840 for the induction in a bar of mild Whitworth steel , and 18,250 in a bar of wrought iron.* The corresponding values of f are 1563 and 1437 respectively .
Probably the highest magnetisation reached in any experiments of this class already published is that found by Mr. Shelford Bidwellf in his experiments on the tractive force between the halves of a divided ring electro-magnet .
( For a force || of 585 he gives 19,820 as the value of ^ ( calculated from the tractive force ) in a wrought-iron ring .
The corresponding value of | is 1530 .
With cast iron , Dr. Hopkinson found ( in a sample of grey iron ) 10,783 for the induction produced by a force of 240 .
The corresponding value of is 841 .
In the space between the pole-pieces of a strong electro-magnet we have a field of force of much greater intensity than it is practicable to produce by the direct action of the electric current .
This field is not well adapted for experiments whose object is to determine with precision the relation of magnetisation to magnetising force , on account of the distortion which it undergoes when the piece of iron to be magnetised is introduced into it .
It is , however , well suited for experiments whose object is to determine how much magnetism the metal can be forced to take up .
For this purpose it is of course necessary that the cross-section of the test-piece should be much smaller than the area of the pole-piece faces .
In the following experiments the electro-magnet consisted of a pair of vertical limbs 25 cm .
long , with cores 5 cm .
in diameter , joined at the bottom by a horizontal yoke , and furnished on the top with pole-pieces , made of soft hammered scrap iron , in the form of rectangular blocks with plane faces , whose distance from each other could be adjusted at will .
The faces were 5*25 cm .
square .
The magnet was wound with wire large enough to permit a current of about 27 amperes to be used for a short time .
In the earliest experiments the test-piece to be magnetised was a round cylinder of soft iron , with flat ends 0*34 cm .
in diameter and 1*3 cm .
long .
This was covered with an induction coil , consisting of a single layer of fine wire , which extended over the whole length of the piece .
It was placed lengthwise in the centre of the field , with the pole-pieces just touching its ends , and the field magnet was excited .
The test-piece was then suddenly withdrawn , while the transient current produced in the induction coil was measured by a ballistic galvanometer connected to the induction coil by long leading wires , which were twisted together * J. and E. Hopkinson have observed an induction of 20,000 in the oore of a dynamo-armature , under a force estimated at 740 ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1886 ( Part I ) p. 355 ) .

[ Mar. 24 throughout their whole length .
Very few experiments were made with test-pieces of this form , for it was found that they gave by no means an exceptionally high value for the magnetic induction .
This is to be ascribed to the fact that the ends of the cylinder , which were in contact with the pole-pieces , necessarily shared that value of the induction which existed in the part of the pole-piece faces which they touched , and this comparatively low induction in and near the ends of the cylinder neutralised the much higher value in the middle portion .
The induction coil , being wound from end to end of the bar , gave a mean value for the whole length .
To obtain higher values , it was obviously necessary to restrict the measurement of the induction to the middle portion , where the induction was greatest ; and , further , it was desirable to furnish the bar with conical or some form of spreading ends , which would present an easy path for the lines of induction to converge towards the central neck .
Accordingly , test-pieces were turned of the form and dimensions of Sample A , shown in Plate 2 , fig. 1 , where the bobbin is sketched in place between the pole-pieces .
These were wound along the whole length of the narrow central neck with an induction coil consisting of a single layer of No. 36 S.W.Gr .
silk-covered wire .
In Sample A the diameter of the iron neck was 0-923 mm. , and the diameter measured to the middle of the thickness of the wire forming the induction coil was 0'9495 .
Hence there was but little space , outside the section of the iron , enclosed by the coil ; and the small amount of magnetic induction in this non-ferrous space was allowed for by a method to be explained below .
In test-pieces of the form of Sample A the loss of magnetism observed on suddenly withdrawing the piece from its place between the pole-pieces of the field magnet , is less than the whole magnetism by the small but somewhat uncertain quantity of residual magnetism which the piece retains .
To avoid this source of uncertainty another form of test-piece was used , which is shown in fig. 2 , Sample B. Here the bobbin has its conical ends rounded at the base to form portions of a circular cylinder , and the pole-pieces are hollowed to correspond .
The bobbin can now be turned completely round about a central axis at right angles to the paper , so that the direction of its magnetism is reversed , and half the ballistic effect of the reversal measures the magnetic induction .
This method was used in the greater number of the observations .
Again , by merely withdrawing the bobbin from the field , and comparing the effect of this withdrawal with half the effect of reversal , an estimate was arrived at " of the amount of error to which the former experiments were subject on account of residual magnetism .
To determine the intensity of the magnetic field in the space immediately surrounding the narrow neck in which the greatest 1887 .

induction occurred , a small quantity of wire was wound over the first induction coil , to form a distance-piece , and on the top of that a second induction coil was wound , the second coil , like the first , consisting of a single layer of very fine wire .
The space between the two coils was accurately determined .
When the test-piece was reversed or drawn out of the field the operation was in each case performed several times , and two groups of observations were recorded , one giving the induction in the inner coil , and the other the induction in the outer coil ; the difference of course served to determine the field in the space between the coils .
When this field was known it was easy to correct for the induction in the non-ferrous space enclosed by the inner coil .
Three kinds of wrought iron were tested ; soft hammered scrap , Swedish iron , and Lowmoor iron .
The hammered scrap proved less susceptible than the other two , and was not used in the final experiments , which were made with test-pieces of the form of Sample B. Pieces of cast iron were also tested , in forms resembling both A and B. To determine in absolute measure the value of the ballistic effects , a large earth-coil was kept in circuit with the induction coil and galvanometer , and was turned over in either the vertical or horizontal earth-field at the beginning , and again at the end of each group of observations .
To avoid the possibility of error in this important particular , two separate earth-coils of entirely different dimensions were employed , and the galvanometer constant was determined independently by means of both , with results which were in excellent agreement .
The values of the induction stated below are worked out on the basis that the horizontal force in the grounds of University College , Dundee , at a place sufficiently removed from local magnetic influence , is 0'160 in C.G-.S .

This is the highest induction that has been recorded in these experiments .
A similar experiment with a piece of Swedish wrought iron , of the form and dimensions shown in fig. 2 , gave 32,310 for the greatest value of the magnetic force in the ring of space surrounding the iron neck being then 11,250 .
The amount of residual magnetism retained by a Lowmoor sample of this form ( Sample B ) was determined by comparing the effect of withdrawing the test-piece with the effect of reversing it .
The results showed that within the range of magnetic force used in these experiments , namely , from about 4000 to 11,000 C.G.S. units , the residual magnetism is nearly constant .
Its mean value in a number of determinations was\#151 ; For Lowmoor iron , residual induction , = 510 per sq .

These results showed that pieces of the form of Sample B ( fig. 2 ) retained only a small part ( less than 1/ 60 ) of their greatest induction when withdrawn from the field .

In the following experiment a bobbin of annealed Swedish iron , of the size and shape shown in fig. 2 , was tested by withdrawing it from the field .

A bobbin of cast iron of a form resembling Sample A , fig. 1 , was [ 887 .
] On the Magnetisation of Iron in Strong Fields .
207 ilso tested by drawing it out of the field .
The results were in close tgreement with those given above for the other sample .
In fig. 3 the general results for Lowmoor wrought iron ( Sample B ) md cast iron are shown by curves which give the relation ( 1 ) of the nduction within the metal neck to the current in the field magnet '.oils , and ( 2 ) of the induction or magnetic force in the space immediately surrounding the neck to the current in the field magnet .oils .
The full lines are for the Lowmoor forging , and the broken lines are for cast iron .
The field produced by a given current is ( at Its higher values ) rather less strong in the case of cast iron , probably because the larger size of the cast iron neck allowed a greater portion of the whole induction from pole to pole to find its way through the metal .
( Compare Xx for cast iron and for Lowmoor .
) The magnetic force within the metal ( p ) differs from the field in the surrounding space by an amount which cannot be estimated without a knowledge of the distribution of free magnetism on the pole-pieces and conical faces of the bobbin .
It appears probable that with the dimensions of the various parts used in these experiments , the magnetic force within the metal is less , but not very greatly less , than the outside and closely neighbouring field .
In the absence of any exact knowledge of jp , it is interesting to examine the relation of 1 !
to the outside field .
Thus , ( p\#151 ; outside field)/ 47r gives a quantity which is probably not much less than the intensity of magnetism |J .
The values of this quantity for Lowmoor wrought iron , Swedish wrought iron , and cast iron are stated below .
In the case of the Swedish iron the values of ^ \#151 ; given in the previous table for that metal have had 500 added to allow for the residual magnetism .

The curves have the same kind of inflection that a curve of p and S begins to have when the magnetising force is raised sufficiently high * The range through which the permeability of iron may vary is well shown by comparing the values reached here ( probably in the extreme case less than 3 ) with the value 20,000 , which was found by one of us in the case of a soft wire exposed to a very small magnetising force and kept at the same time in a state of mechanical vibration.f The quantity \#151 ; outside field)/ 47ris nearly constant in the Swedish iron , but diminishes with increased induction in the Lowmoor iron and in the cast iron .

9K this would mean that in the two metals last named $ had passed a maximum , and the process of diamagnetisation which the Ampere-Weber molecular theory of magnetism anticipates had set in .
But the uncertainty which attaches to the value of |p prevents this conclusion from being fairly drawn from these experiments .
A slight excess in the mean value of P within the metal neck over the value of p in the space contiguous to the neck would suffice to convert the apparent decrease of | into an increase , with increasing values of S5 .
So far as these results can be said to bear upon the point in question , they rather support the idea that the intensity of magnetism S becomes and remains a sensibly constant quantity when the magnetising force is raised to very high values .
This maximum of J ; appears to exceed 1700 in wrought iron and 1250 in cast iron , and it does not appear likely that any increase of magnetising force will bring the intensity of magnetism in cast iron to a value equal or nearly equal to that which wrought iron is capable of acquiring .
It is scarcely necessary to add that our experiments give no support to the suggestion that there is a maximum of the induction The value of ^ capable of being reached by the method we have employed depends mainly on the scale of the experiments .
Larger field magnets with pole-pieces tapering to a narrow neck should yield values of ^ greatly in excess even of those we have observed .
The experiments will be continued and various qualities of steel will be examined with the following modification in the apparatus:\#151 ; The pole-pieces will themselves be turned , at the ends which face each other , into cones with flat ends , between which the test-piece in the form of a round cylinder will be inserted .
The induction will be measured in the neighbourhood of a medial transverse plane only , and the value of the field outside the iron will be determined in this plane at various distances from the axis .
Since there is no free magnetism in the iron bar in the medial plane , the magnetic force within the metal is continuous with the force in the surrounding space , and a curve showing the relation of the magnetic force at various points outside to the distance from the axis should admit of being produced so as to give a good approximation to the magnetic force within the metal .
If this can be successfully accomplished , the value of the isthmus method of examining the magnetisation of iron will be greatly enhanced .
[ Dr. Hopkinson informs me that he experimented by what we have called the " isthmus " method nearly three years ago , but gave it up from uncertainty about the induction which took place through the coil but not through the iron .
In the present experiments this difficulty has been avoided mainly by using larger bobbins with a single layer of fine wire for induction coil .
I am indebted to Dr. Hopkinson for the suggestion ( soon to be put in pi'actice ) that the " isthmus " VOL. xlii .

In connexion with the values of ^ reached by other observers , Professor J. J. Thomson informs me that in some recent experiments by himself and Mr. H. F. Newall on the effect of cutting a magnet at right angles to the lines of force , an induction of 28,000 was found on one occasion.\#151 ; J. A. E. ] Presents , March 24 , 1887 .
