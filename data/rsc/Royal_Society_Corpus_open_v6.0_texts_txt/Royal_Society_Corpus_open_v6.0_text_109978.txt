] By passing coal tar through a red-hot iron tube , a portion of an aqueous fluid , and of a substance like tar , was obtained ; the latter is black , soluble in ether , and partially in alcohol , of an aromatic odour , and sweetish taste .
It was submitted to slow distillation , and among other products afforded naphthaline , a white concrete substance of an aromatic odour and taste , fusible at 180 ?
, and scarcely soluble in water , but readily so in ether , alcohol , and oils .
Of the various characters of this substance , detailed by the author , its tendency to crystallize appears the most remarkable ; its vapour condenses in rhombic plates , which are sometimnes modified into hexagonal plates , by the incomplete development of the smaller angles of the usual rhomb .
The other substances obtained along with the naphthaline were ammoniacal water , and an oil of a bituminous and aromatic odour , boiling at 2100 , and not congealing at 320 , highly inflammable , and readily soluble in alcohol and ether : there was also produced , during the latter part of the distillation , a yellow farina precipitable from its alcoholic solution by water , and fusible .
Of these four substances , resulting from the distillation of the black liquid obtained by distilling coal tar , Dr. Kidd thinks that the water and the farina are products , and the other mere educts of the operation .
