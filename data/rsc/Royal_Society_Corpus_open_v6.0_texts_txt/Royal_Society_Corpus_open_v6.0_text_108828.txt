On Magnetic Calms and Earth-Currents .
By CHARLES V. WALKER , Esq. , _F.R.Sf , F.R..AS .
Received February 3 , -Read February 13 , 1862 .
I USE the word " calm " in a purely negative sense-not storm .
For many months the earth has shown few marked signs of activity .
Very few notable earth-currents have attracted attention since those of 1861 , January 22 to 26 , referred to in the last paragraph but one of my paper " On Magnetic Storms , &amp;c. , " read February 14 .
I had not proceeded far in the discussion of the results which form the subject of that communication , without discovering that I possessed close at hand , and under my immediate control , the means of verifying the conclusions to which I had arrived as to the general direction of earth-currents ; of extending the observations to periods when the earth is free of signs from extraordinary activity ; and of further pursuing my inquiries .
In sections 3 and 4 of Table XII.t I grouped together a series of observations ; and in fig. 5 of Plate III .
gave a graphic illustration of the same ; and from those data deduced the approximate Direction of Earth-Currents ; and determined the azimuth of the drift to be in turn about N.E. and S.W. I was unable to include many cases in these sections of the Table .
Simultaneous observations including both limiting lines were few ; I was therefore glad to have so ready at hand the means of multiplying and modifying them .
The groups of observations in the Table referred to were made on eight or nine different lines of telegraph , making various angles with the magnetic meridian ; and were bounded on the one hand by the London-Tonbridge line , making an angle with the magnetic meridian of 13 ?
W. , and , on the other hand by the Dover-London line , making an angle of 136 ?
E. , the two lines making with each other an angle of 149 ?
; from which it could be deduced , and was shown , that the direction in which the currents moved was included within an arc of ( 180--149 ?
=)31 ?
; and that this arc was situated midway between the lines in question ( which are those set off on fig. 5 , Plate III .
, and numbered there , as well as in Tables XI .
and XII .
, 23 and 26 respectively ) , extending from 46 ?
to 77 ?
E. of magnetic north , or W. of magnetic south .
The Dover-London telegraph wires pass Tonbridge , where they enter my private office , being attached to a telegraph instrument placed there .
This gives me the immediate command of the Dover-London line , numbered 26-25 in Table XI .
p. 130 , and in figs. 1 and 5 , Plate III .
, and which is one of the limiting or boundary lines .
By cutting off the communication with Dover , that is to say , by connecting the wire with * Philosophical Transactions , 1861 , p. 113 .
t Ibid. 1861 , p. 131 .
the earth on the Dover side of Tonbridge , I obtain the other limiting line , LondonTonbridge , Nos. 23-24 ; or if the wires are connected with the earth on the London side of Tonbridge , I obtain the Dover-Tonbridge line .
This is not given in my Table XI .
, but is very nearly identical with the Ashford-Tonbridge line there given , and numbered 32-31 .
It makes an angle of 118 ?
E. with the magnetic meridian , and therefore falls , as shown in fig. 1 , Plate III .
, intermediate between the other two , and incidentally is very useful in this investigation .
The earth-currents which form the subject of the present communication are not detected by the ordinary telegraph galvanometer .
I have therefore prepared a small horizontal galvanometer .
The coil is 2{inches long , 4 of an inch wide , and 3 of an inch high , and is filled with silk-covered copper wire , one yard of which weighs 5 grains ; it is No. 35 of the Birmingham iron-wire gauge , corresponding to a diameter of 40inch .
It is placed in the magnetic meridian .
The needle is 1 inch in length , and carries a light index projecting from the E. side of the coil .
The range of the index is about 55 ?
on either side of 0 ? .
The whole is covered by a glass shade .
Earth-currents that attract no attention on the telegraph needles , produce on this instrument a deflection of 40 ?
or 50 ? .
It is placed in proper connexion with one of the Dover-London wires , and can be at any instant placed in circuit by merely pressing a spring , and thrown out of circuit by removing the pressure .
Possession is obtained with equal facility of the London-Tonbridge or the Dover-Tonbridge section , by inserting a brass plug in one or other of two holes made in a divided brass disc .
This is all the apparatus required .
It is fixed on a slab within arm 's reach from my chair .
At any moment , when I see by the telegraph needles that the wires are unoccupied by telegrams , I can take the three complete observations in a few seconds .
The word " up " is engraved in face of the N.E. quadrant , and the word D/ " down " in face of the S.E. The arrangement of this miniature observatory will be ____readily understood from the following diagram ( fig. 9 ) .
L is the telegraph wire , entering the office from London ; / D the wire from Dover ; S the contact spring , and s the/ stud on which it rests .
When the spring and stud are in a rW contact , the ordinary telegraph signals pass along them between D and L without being visible on the galvanometer G. The needle n , with its index i , and the circle of the galvanometer G , are given in one-third size ; a and b : i'( _ are the terminals of the galvanometer wire .
When the I spring S is depressed or removed from contact with the stud s , as shown in the diagram , no current can pass between D and L without passing through the galvanometer G. 1 , 2 , and 3 show in one-third size a brass disc divided into three parts , and .
fixed upon a block of mahogany , insulated each from the others .
The middle piece of the disc is connected by a wire with the gasand water-pipes , and is therefore in connexion with the earth E. A brass plug is provided , which fits into the respective holes 1 , 2 , and 3 .
When in the centre hole 1 , this instrument is not in action ; when in the hole 2 , it connects I and 2 together , so that the wire on the a or Dover side of the galvanometer is in direct communication with the earth E , and the galvanometer is in circuit between London and Tonbridge ; when the plug is transferred to the hole 3 , for like reasons the galvanometer is in circuit between Tonbridge and Dover .
Observations on the whole line , or on eitier of the two sections , are readily and rapidly obtained by this arrangement .
The coil of the galvanometer is for convenience so wound , that when it is traversed by a positive current of electricity travelling towards London , or , to use railway language , " up " the line , the index moves in the right quadrant , or toward the word " up " engraved there ; when , on the other hand , it is travelling from London , or " down " the line , the index moves to the left quadrant , or toward the word " down .
" The following is a Table of Observations made during October 1861 .
They are taken in the order of the columns 1 , 2 , and 3 .
The letters u or d are entered against each observation , according as the index moves to the word " up " or " down .
" The time is taken at the end of the third observation .
It is given in " Greenwich Mean Time , " fractions of minutes being rejected ; the local clock error being known by means of the " Time Signals " that come two or three times a day from Greenwich .

314 276 In October there are three cases ( 000 ) , and in November two , in which no deflection of the needle occurred in either of the three observations ; and many individual cases are recorded .
No particular stress is laid on these cases of no action .
They merely indicate that the current , if any , was too small to affect the particular instrument used ; a more delicate instrument might doubtless have given signs .
Of the 276 complete observations , 230 , or five-sixths , are in accordance with the conclusions already arrived at-that the general direction of the drift of earth-currents is approximately N.E. or S.W. And the numbers of each kind come out nearly the same : 115 N.E. u , d , u ; -and 110 S.W. d , u , d. The conditions of this group of results , which for convenience may be called nornal , given graphically in Plate III .
fig. 5 , may be gathered in detail more readily from figs. 10 and 11 .
B~ BN is the magnetic north ; L-D , London-Dover ; TL_-T , London-Tonbridge ; T-D , Tonbridge-Dover .
The respective lines of direction are further shown by the arrow heads , -one semi-barb indicating column 1 ; two , column 2 ; three , column 3 .
The arrow-heads pointing upwards all apply to " up " currents u ; those pointing downwards , to " down " currents d. The dotted portion of the circumference of the circle is the arc of the horizon , within which the resultant is to be found .
The degrees are given reckoned from the north , eastward round the circle .

11 the S.W. nornal , or d , ie , d. From these ables it appears that the prevailang currents , or those of most frequency , are from the N.E. or S.W. ; this as well in calm periods as in periods of magnetic storms. .
In the absence of long-continued and consecutive observations , it is not easy to form an opinion as to whether the N.E. or S.W. currents prevail more or less at one part of the day than at another ; or to what extent , if at all , the directions or alternations are influenced by local meteorological changes or conditions .
In 'Les Archives des Sciences Physiques , ' vol. xi .
pp. 110-136 , is a memoir by Father SECCHI , " On the Connexion of Meteorological Phenomena and Variations of the Intensity of Terrestrial Magnetism , " in which he expresses very strongly his opinion that every rupture of meteorological equilibrium produces a rupture of electrical equilibrium , which can only be re-established by means of a current which discharges itself from place to place , which current cannot fail to act upon the magnetometers .
Here is a wide field for research .
Although I am not engaged in investigating the origin of the currents , I cannot avoid expressing my opinion that the value of existing currents , if not their direction ( I speak locally ) , may be more or less influenced by meteorological changes , especially cloud , sunshine , or temperature .
The currents at calm periods are at best but feeble .
The resistances of the various parts of the telegraph wire through which they pass vary with the varying temperatures , so that it is quite reasonable to expect tht asat , even when no change is taking place in the absolute value of the current travelling in the earth , the needle of the galvanometer may move forward or backward according as sunshine or cloud , heat or cold prevail here or there in the district under examination .
This opinion is salnctioned in some degree by the result of some night observations made on October 28-29 .
My original observations were almost wholly made by day .
On the night in question observations were made every ten minutes from 10.10 P.M. to 6.50 A.M. During this period there was evidently an excess of S.W. currents ; the proportion of n , d , u to d , u , d currents was 1 : 2-7 , whereas the day proportion for the month was 3-7 : 2-7 .
Also fifteen out of the twenty-five d , d , d currents were collected during the night ; in fact there were only ten u , d , u currents in the whole fifty-six night observations .
From 11.40 P.M. to 5.40 A.M. the London-Dover wire collected a continuous down d current , varying more or less in intensity ; from 5.40 to 6.30 A.M. , the current was too feeble to be appreciated ; at 6.40 it was found in the reverse direction u , and was so when the observations were interrupted at 7.47.-These remarks in passing .
There is no consistency in the relations between two derived currents collected at the same time from the same earth-drift of electricity : this may be in great measure due , as I have hinted , to local meteorological interference , if not to the absolute differences of value in the different sections of the drift itself .
I have taken at random , from the October observations , a few cases for illustration : 13u ... .

Being read off on the same instrument , and under circumstances so favourable , they are strictly comparable .
There are no relative values to be traced .
For instance , 13 ?
corresponds with 38 ?
; 18 ?
with 21 ?
and 25 ?
; 15 ?
is coupled with various values--150 , 160 , 20 ?
, 300 , and 35 ?
, and so on .
These illustrations may be extended at pleasure .
Since my original communication to the Royal Society , an " eighth article , " by Professor LooMIs , has appeared in the 'American Journal , ' vol. xxxii .
, November 1861 .
On discussing the results accumulated in America , he infers that all the facts are consistent with the supposition of electric currents moving to and fro on the earth 's surface , the average direction of which , on that continent , is from about N. 45 ?
E. to S. 45 ?
W. , a result remarkably in accordance with the conclusions to which we have arrived by a somewhat different process for the S.E. part of England .
He has also discussed , in quite another way , the magnetic disturbances in Europe ; and he obtains a direction for the electric wave , connected with those disturbances , from N. 28 ?
E. to S. 28 ?
W. over the surface of Europe .
These approximations are noteworthy .
It is plain , however , from Tables XIII .
and XV .
, that currents from time to time flow from some point in the S.E. and in the N.W. quadrants .
These directions may for the present be called abnormal .
In the existing state of our knowledge , it is impossible to say whether they indicate the state of transition between the two normal quadrants .
The cases are few in number .
In October , 26 were recorded ; in November , 16 ; or ` 1-3 of the whole number .
In December also I noticed a few .
Like the normal , they are subdivided into two classes : u , u , u , 11 ; d , d , d , 31 .
The current was constant in the d , d , d direction , with a single interruption , from midnight October 28 to 1.50 A.M. October 29 .
Currents of this kind , as may be seen in Table XIII .
, are as definitely EARTH-iCURRENTS .
marked as the others ; their values are equally large .
They are expressed graphically in figs. 12 and 13 .

The lines of direction are not favourable for arriving at an approximate place for the resultant .
We have to seek it within the large arc of 131 ?
, which includes respectively the whole of the S.E. or N.W. quadrant .
I have the command at Tonbridge of the RamsgateHarbour-Tonbridge line , to which I shall have occasion hereafter to refer .
It corresponds nearly with the Shalford-Red Hill , 34-33 of Table XI .
and Plate III .
fig. 1 ; it makes an angle with the magnetic meridian of 99 ?
, reckoned eastward .
Many observations on this line are given in Table XVI .
column 3 , and in all cases will be found to coincide in direction with those on the Tonbridge-Dover line .
I have therefore been able to lay down this line in figs. 12 and 13 .
It is indicated by the letters RT ' , and by three semibarbs .
It reduces the arc to 1120 , which , however , is still large , and which I cannot further reduce by the means at my command .
Since I wrote the note ( 1861 , July ) which appears in the 'Philosophical Transactions ' for that year , Part I. p. 96 , the Astronomer Royal has laid his proposition for erecting earth-current wires before the Board of Directors of the South-Eastern Railway , which has been referred to me ; and it is needless to say has had my favourable report .
The Directors have entertained the proposition most cordially ; and have approved of the erection of the wires at cost price , and conceded the right of way and maintenance on the payment for each of a nominal sum of a few shillings annually .
The Greenwich-Dartford wire will make an angle of about 60 ?
W. of N. ( magnetic ) , nearly coincident with my Tonbridge-Ashford , or with the Tonbridge-Dover line of the present communication .
The Greenwich-Croydon wire will make an angle of about 47 ?
E. of N. , or not far from the direction of my Ashford-Hastings line .
By combining the wires at Greenwich , the Dartford-Croydon line may be obtained , which is 84 ?
E. of N. , or nearly my Ramsgate-Ashford direction .
Treating these lines in the usual way , we shall have an arc of 36 ?
or 107 ? .
The former will be between N. and N.E. , and out of the range .
The latter , which however is very large , will include the range .
I look forward with great interest to the completion of these wires , in order that we may see the result of uninterrupted observations , which cannot be obtained from our highly occupied telegraph wires .
I purpose erecting these wires as soon as the insulators are made ; which will be constructed with great care , of a double concentric cup of ebonite , with an outer cup of French porcelain .
The ebonite cups will be turned in a lathe before fitting , so as to present a perfectly smooth surface .
They will be placed on the apex of our telegraph poles .
Four exceptional cases presented themselves among the 276 observations .
Their character is given in Table XV .
They are beyond the reach of the system of analysis we have adopted .
Whether the general direction of the current-drift was changing at the moment of observation , and was complete in one part of the district and not so in the other , I cannot , with these very rare and isolated data , pretend to say .
The results are given precisely as read off .
There was no reason to suspect any interferences from artificial currents ; a few more cases may throw more light on this exceptional class .
A few entries will be found in the Table XIII .
as thus : 50 to 150 ; 0 ?
to 100 ; 50 ?
to 5 ?
d , &amp;c. The derived currents in these cases were unstable .
A few of the earlier cases that occurred were questioned , and I was disposed to reject them , the impression being that they were due to interference from strong telegraph currents entering into the observing-wire .
But instances occurred in which there was no reason to suspect interferences , they are therefore placed on record .
We speak of electric currents in this inquiry ; the word conveys the idea of length without width .
The currents in question necessarily and evidently cover large areas , presenting as it were an electric plane .
Passing on from the determination of mere direction , I was able to survey the two sides of the same plane .
By reference to the map ( vol. 159 , Plate II .
) , the RamsgateHarbour-London and the Dover-Tonbridge lines are not many degrees from being parallel .
They are about 20 miles apart ; the former is 67 miles , and the latter 45 miles in length .
I have at Ashford junction a turnplate or switch .
When desiring to make the observations on the Ramsgate-London line , I call Ashford and give the word " branch ; " the reply is " yes " or " no , " according as it is at liberty or not .
If at liberty , the switch is turned , and I have the command of the wire from Ramsgate to London , the telegraph length of which is 97miles ; and then , by placing the plug in the hole 3 of fig. 9 , for reasons already explained , the command is obtained of the Ramsgate-Tonbridge line .
Observations of this kind have been made from time to time ; the results are given in Table XVI .
The letters in this and subsequent Tables have the same references as those in Table XIII .

6.23 A.M. 000 If the value of these derived currents depended simply on the mere distance between the earth-plates or observing-stations , and their bearing each on the other , it is obvious that the values in columns 2 and 3 would be identical , or in this case nearly so .
The London-Tonbridge wire-length is 41 miles ; the Tonbridge-Hastings 33 ; so that the value on the latter length should be a little higher if anything , the resistance being less .
But , with very rare exceptions , the Tonbridge-Hastings values are seen to be greatly below the Tonbridge-London .
The contrast is remarkable .
In some cases the differences are very conspicuous .
I have made a sufficient number of observations , extended 215 over two months , to satisfy myself that the one section is under all circumstances less active in derived currents than the other .
This difference can only be attributed , as already suggested in my former communication ( p. 109 ) , to the different geological conditions of the two sections of country , a difference which may operate in two ways : either the resistance of the section may be relatively great , so that the earth-plates penetrate into a portion of the electric plane that is traversed by a current of low value , and hence the derived current is comparatively low ; or the resistance of the section may be relatively small , so that , although the earth-plate may penetrate into a portion of the electric plane that is traversed by a current of higher value , yet the wire resistance , in contrast with the high conducting power of the earth section , may cause the derived current to have a relatively low value .
The London-Hastings line makes an angle of possibly 70 ?
with the N.E. or S.W. resultant , that is with the u , d , u or the d , u , d currents ; so that even with a good geological section and with a perfect knowledge of the relative resistances of its various parts , it would be no easy matter even to hint at the precise relation between the value of the current and the structure and arrangement of the strata .
Mr. ROBERT HUNT has kindly furnished me with a geological section of the country between London and Hastings drawn by Mr. F. DREW .
Between London and Tonbridge are included , London clay ; Woolwich beds ( sand ) ; chalk ; gault ( clay ) ; lower greensand , sand and a little limestone ; clay ; sand and sandstone ; clay .
Between Tonbridge and Hastings , sand and sandstone ; clay and a little limestone .
There are many faults also between Tonbridge and Hastings .
Column 1 of Table XVII .
contains the values given by the whole length , from London to Hastings .
They differ but little , save in one or two instances , from the TonbridgeHastings values ; and are consequently very low in comparison with the TonbridgeLondon values .
These facts all indicate the very notable influence of local conditions , other than the meteorological variation already noted , over the relative value of the current in different parts of the plane .
It was a matter of considerable importance to determine with certainty whether the currents with which I was dealing were in whole , or only in part , earth-currents ; whether , that is , any portion of the observed deflections of the galvanometer needle were due to electricity collected from the atmosphere by the suspended telegraph wires that were employed in these observations .
To determine this I availed myself of the assistance of Ashford .
After taking observations in the usual way between London and Dover , and between Tonbridge and Dover , I desired the Ashford clerk to detach the wire from his instrument and leave the end insulated .
I thus had a wire of 67 miles connected with the earth at London , or one of 25 miles connected with the earth at Tonbridge , the end in either case being insulated at Ashford .
It was desirable to make a considerable number of observations , at various hours of the day and under all conditions of weather , in order to test this question rigidly .
The results are given in Table XVIII .

3.24 P.M. 5u 10 0 It will be seen that in no single instance was any deflection of the needle obtained when the wire was off at Ashford ; so that we are right in regarding all the currents with which we have been dealing , as far as atmospheric electricity is concerned , as true and proper earth-currents .
Columns I and 2 are the deflections obtained on the London-Dover and TonbridgeDover lines in the usual way .
Column 3 are the 0 ?
resulting from repeating each of the two previous observations with the Ashford wire detached .
I have also made repeated observations on the effect of polarizing the earth-plates by the passage of a powerful current ; and all with the same negative result .
An observation is made , say on the Tonbridge-London line , and the deflection noted .
A powerful current from the ordinary telegraph battery ( a current which it would be imprudent to receive on the observing galvanometer ) is transmitted for a given time , say half a minute , through the Tonbridge-London circuit , in the direction which would have produced the deflection previously observed .
After this the observation is repeated .
No appreciable difference has in any instance been found in the deflection .
The direction remains the same ; and the value unaltered .
So that the currents , as far as the polarizing of the plates is concerned , may be regarded as true and proper earth-currents .
The alterations in direction of the currents and the varying values in either direction indicate that they are in nowise due to the mere electromotive force of the earth-plates employed .
I have mentioned in my former communication ( pp. 94 , 95 ) that the connexion with the earth is very frequently made by means of the fish-jointed rails .
Some misgivings might arise on a first glance as to the influence of this arrangement over the results .
The current collected under such circumstances , however , would be true in direction , but reduced in value .
We need not enter into the discussion of this question from the fact that no such earth-connexion has been required for our present purposes .
To prevent misapprehension , I have thought it better to give a list of the earth-connexion employed at all the stations concerned in this investigation .
London ... ... Gas-pipes ; and a lightning conductor terminating in a wet pit of coke .
Tonbridge ... ... Gasand water-pipes .
Hastings. .
Gasand water-pipes .
Ramsgate Harbour ... Water-pipes .
Dover ... .
Gas-pipes .
I still continue taking observations ; but they are all of the same character as those now placed on record , and merely afford further illustrations of the points that have been discussed .
It would be premature to say that the subject is tolerably exhausted , as far as the means at my command are concerned ; but I do not at this moment see any salient point that is within my reach .
The steady daily and hourly march of these phenomena , and their relation , if any , to the like march of magnetometers , will soon be within the reach of Mr. AIRY ; and we may be well assured that these and the other collateral questions will be ably discussed by him .
The results arrived at in these two communications may be briefly summed up as follows:1st .
That currents of electricity are at all times moving in definite directions in the earth .
2nd .
That their direction is not determined by local causes .
3rd .
That there is no apparent difference , except in degree , between the currents 218 collected in times of great magnetic disturbance , and those collected during the ordinary calm periods .
4th .
That the prevailing directions of earth-currents , or the currents of most frequent occurrence , are approximately N.E. and S.W. respectively .
5th .
That there is no marked difference in frequency , duration , or value , between the N.E. and the S.W. currents .
6th .
That ( at least during calm periods ) there are definite currents of less frequency from some place in the S.E. and N.W. quadrants respectively .
7th .
That the direction of the current in one part of a plane on the earth 's surface ( at least as far as the S.E. district of England is concerned ) coincides with the direction in another part of the plane ; and if the direction changes in one part , it changes in all parts of the plane .
8th .
That the relation in value between currents in a given part of the plane and currents in another given .
part is not constant , but is influenced by local meteorological conditions , and varies from time to time .
9th .
That the value of the current of a given length , moving in a given line of direction , is not necessarily the same as that of a current of the same length on the same line of direction produced , and that their relative value depends on the physical character of the earth interposed between the respective points of observation , and is tolerably constant .
10th .
That the currents which have formed the bases of these investigations are derived currents from true and proper earth-currents , and neither in whole nor in any appreciable part have been collected from the atmosphere , nor are due either in whole or in any appreciable part to polarization imparted to earth-plates by the previous passage of earth-currents or of powerful telegraphic currents ; nor are they due to any electromotive force in the earth-plates themselves .
lth .
That the earth-currents in question ( at least the powerful currents present at all times of great magnetic disturbance ) exercise a direct action upon magnetometers , just as artificial currents confined to a wire exercise a direct action upon a magnet .
