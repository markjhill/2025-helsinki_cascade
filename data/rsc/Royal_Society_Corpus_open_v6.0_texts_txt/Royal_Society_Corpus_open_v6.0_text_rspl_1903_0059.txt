The first two substances are considerably more toxic thanTthe second two ; and for each of the two pairs the first named has shown itself to be somewhat the more toxic .
As regards the excised heart , the effect of all four substances is arrest in diastole ; the effect is in each case counteracted by atropine .

* From the observations described in the preceding communication , it was evident that betaine cannot be distinguished as an inert member of the ptomaine series , at least as regards its action on isolated nerve and on the isolated heart .
This led to an inquiry into the original source of the universal text-book statement that betaine , unlike choline , neurine and muscarine , is non-toxic .
The only experimental evidence to the point consists ( as far as I have yet discovered* ) in a statement by Schultzen , quoted by Scheibler in the 'Berichte der Deutschen Chemisehen Gesellschaft ' for 1870 , vol. 3 , p. 155 , to the following effect:\#151 ; " Mehrere Versuche welche ich mit dem Betain ausstellte , haben ubereinstimmend ergeben dass dasselbe in keiner Weise gif tig wirkt , ja keinerlei wahrnehmbare Wirkungen auf das Befinden eines Thieres * K. Andrlik , A. Velich , and YL StanSk , in a quite recent paper ( " Das Betain in Physiologish-chemischer Bezieliung .

" The experiments to be described below are in direct contradiction of this very clear and positive statement .
In a series of experiments made with a different object in view , viz. , to determine the effect upon isolated nerve of different kinds of sugar , it was noticed more than once that syrups made with ordinary beet-sugar had a faint cadaveric odour reminiscent of the choline and neurine solutions that had just been under investigation , and the suspicion was naturally aroused that the taint of the samples in question might be due to the presence of betaine or of allied alkaloid .
I attempted ( and failed ) to separate betaine from such a sample ; Dr. Plimmer has undertaken the task again with a positive result .
Physiological Data.\#151 ; The action of betaine ( as hydrochloride ) upon isolated nerve and the isolated heart has been described in the previous paper .
All that remained to do in the present connection was to re-try upon warm-blooded animals the effects upon respiration and upon blood pressure the effects of intravenous injections of betaine .

( See continuation on following page .
) It appears from these experiments that betaine ( as hydrochloride injected per venom )acts directly upon the heart ; that commercial betaine ( Merck ) is more powerful than betaine extracted from beet-sugar ( Plimmer ) .
In all instances the mode of death has been by cardiac syncope from which no recovery could be obtained by artificial respiration .
With sublethal doses the characteristic effect was a temporary fall of blood pressure , with a slight augmentation of the respiratory movements .
The difference of action between commercial betaine and betaine from sugar gave rise to several reflections .
Unlike muscarine , of which at least two chemical varieties are known , having quite different physiological actions , betaine is a single well-defined chemical substance that , if pure , should be of constant composition and action .
Analysis of a commercial sample of betaine ( Schuchardt ) by Dr. Plimmer revealed the rather surprising fact that the sample in question contained a large proportion of potassium chloride , quite enough to exercise a direct depressant effect upon the heart s action .
The difference between commercial and laboratory betaine is thus verj probably due to impurity in the former .

Part 2 ( R. H. A. P.).\#151 ; Extraction oj Betaine from Raw Beet-Sugar .
The existence of betaine in the juice of the beet was first demon* seated in 1866 by Scheibler.1 He extracted it from beet-juice as also fr6m beet-molasses in which , by reason of its great solubility , it is present in somewhat large quantities .
Four years later he determined its constitution as being trimethylglycine , and Liebreich2 identified it wjth oxyneurine , which he obtained by the oxidation of choline , or neiurine as he called it .
Choline was shown to exist in the juice of the bejet by Lippmann,3 these two bases ( choline and betaine ) standing to oiie another in the relationship of alcohol to acid ; muscarine , the poison of the toadstool , probably occupies the intermediate position of aljdehyde , as shown by the following formulae yOH N(CH3)3 \)H2\#151 ; cooh Betaine .

The presence of betaine in raw beet-sugar , in which small quantities might reasonably be suspected , has , so far as I have been able to ascertain , not yet been demonstrated , and the object of this investigation has been to determine whether it is present , and if so , in what quantity .
On account of the presence of perhaps only a very small amount of betaine in raw beet-sugar ( the juice of the ripe beet containing only TV per cent. , that of the unripe per cent. ) , two preliminary experiments were made to see if it were possible to extract per cent , of it from sugar to which it had been added ; in the first of these , the sugar was removed as insoluble lead saccharate according to the method patented by Wohl,4 and in the other it was not removed .
In both cases phosphotungstic acid , as used and recommended by Scheibler , was used to precipitate the betaine .
1 .
100 grammes of sugar , to which 0T gramme of betaine hydrochloride was added , were dissolved in 250 cc .
of water , and to this solution , warmed on the water-bath , 150 grammes of lead oxide were gradually added , the mixture being meanwhile well stirred .
The insoluble lead saccharate so formed was then filtered off , and well washed , and the filtrate , treated with sulphuretted hydrogen to remove traces of lead which had gone into solution , was evaporated down to a small volume 1 gm .

On decomposition 0T gramme of betaine hydrochloride , melting at 237 ' C. , Avas obtained .
The original substance melted at 237'\#151 ; 238 ' C. Betaine can thus be quantitatively recovered from sugar to which it has been added .

[ June 12 acid added ; after the same time , however , only a very small quantity of white crystals were precipitated , but on adding a large excess of phosphotungstic acid , and allowing the solution to stand another week white crystal 's were gradually precipitated , which , when washed and dried at 100 ' C. , weighed *0'6 gramme .
These observations show that the presence of sugar slightly hinders the precipitation of betaine by means of phosphotungstic acid , and that in order to precipitate it under these conditions a large excess of the reagent is required .
When working with large quantities of sugar , this method of removing sugar with lead oxide is almost impossible to carry out in the laboratory .
I was led , therefore , to adopt a different method , utilising the ready solubility of betaine in alcohol ; a certain quantity of sugar is also dissolved , but this is insufficient to prevent the precipitation of betaine by phosphotungstic acid , and as the above experiment shows , it can be practically completely precipitated by excess of the re-agent .
1000 grammes of raw beet-sugar were exhaustively extracted in two portions of 500 grammes each , with 2 litres of methylated spirit .
The alcoholic extract so obtained was evaporated down vacuo to a syrup , the syrup dissolved in \#151 ; f litre of water , and to this solution , warmed on the water-bath , 200 c.c. of phosphotungstic acid solution ( 30 per cent. + 5 per cent. H0SO4 ) were added .
A brownish crystalline precipitate was obtained , which was filtered off after it had stood for a week , so as to complete the precipitation , washed with a little water , and dried at 100 ' C ; it weighed 50 grammes .
This precipitate , suspended in water , was then decomposed with excess of baryta , and the filtrate from the insoluble barium phosphotungstate was evaporated down to dryness , after removal from it of excess of baryta by means of carbon dioxide ; the brown residue so obtained was dissolved in alcohol , acidified with hydrochloric acid , and treated with 10 grammes of mercuric chloride dissolved in alcohol ; betaine hydrochloride in combination with mercuric chloride was thus precipitated in white crystalline needles free from the brown colouring matter ; on decomposing it in aqueous solution with sulphuretted hydrogen , and evaporating to dryness , white crystals of betaine hydrochloride were obtained , weighing 2*3 grammes ; recrystallised once from alcohol they were obtained quite pure , and melted at 238'\#151 ; 239 ' C. with decomposition .
( The melting point of betaine hydrochloride obtained by Jahns5 from wormseeds , Artemisia cinct , melted at 227'\#151 ; 228 ' C. , but this is in all probability too low .
A specimen obtained from Merck melted at 237'\#151 ; 238 C. A synthetical specimen from Schuchardt , after separation from it of about 80 per cent , of potassium chloride , melted at 237'\#151 ; 238 ' C. ) Analyses of the substance obtained from raw beet-sugar and dried at 100 ' C. gave the following result:\#151 ; )03 .

For further characterisation , a portion of it was converted into its compound with gold chloride .
E. Fischer6 has recently pointed out that betaine gold chloride , when crystallised from water , melts at about 209 ' C. , and gives , on determination of the gold , values too low to agree with the formula C.- , H ] 2OoNAuCU ; it is only when crystallised from dilute hydrochloric acid that it gives values agreeing with that formula ; he has shown that this compound melts at 245 ' C. ( corr .
250 ' C. ) when quickly heated , but that the melting point often lies 10 ' lower owing to decomposition if the substance is not quickly heated .
The gold chloride compound obtained , when recrystallised from water , melted at about 209'\#151 ; 210 ' C. , and gave the following results on analysis:\#151 ; ( 1 .

Found Au = 43-89 per cent. CsHjsOoNAuCE requires Au = 43-14 per cent. The Physiological Action of Betaine .
[ June 12 , This figure , however , is somewhat high ; it may be accounted for by the fact that a minute quantity of metallic gold was deposited during recrystallisation .
No more betaine was precipitated on adding 200 c.c. of phospho-tungstic acid to the filtrate from the betaine phosphotungstate , the yield of betaine hydrochloride thus being 4'4 grammes from 1 kilo , of sugar .
10 kilogrammes of raw beet-sugar have also been extracted and precipitated with phosphotungstic acid in the same way , and the product obtained was handed to Dr. Waller for physiological investigation .
In order to determine the quantity of betaine in raw beet-sugar more accurately , 100 grammes of the sugar were treated as above described with lead oxide and precipitated with phosphotungstic acid ; 6*3 grammes were thus obtained , and these gave on decomposition 05 gramme of betaine hydrochloride melting at 236'\#151 ; 238 ' C. Conclusion.\#151 ; Betaine in considerable quantity ( 3*75 per 1000 in the sample examined ) is present in raw beet-sugar .
Note.\#151 ; It is perhaps advisable to clearly specify what samples of betaine have actually passed through our hands :\#151 ; No. 1 ( from Merck 's ) has been used in the experiments of the previous paper ( Waller and Sow ton ) and in Experiment 6 of the present paper .
No. 2 , prepared by one of us ( R. H. A. P. ) from " raw beet-sugar , " was used in the experiments of the present paper .
No. 3 ( from Schuchardt ) , containing potassium chloride , has not been used for any physiological tests .
