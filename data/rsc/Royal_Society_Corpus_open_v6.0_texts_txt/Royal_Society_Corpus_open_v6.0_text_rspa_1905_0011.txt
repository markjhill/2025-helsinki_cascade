) Introduction .
In this paper I propose to discuss certain product functions .
I. Functions of which the typical factor is , that is to say .

Functions of which the typical factor is The functions to the first class are substantially the products , which appear in Elliptic Function theory .
Mauy different notations have been used in the discussion of such functions , notably the notations of Jacobi , Weierstrass , Halphen , Tannery , and Molk .
Halphen*discusses the notations used by various w riters , and compares their respective .
In the following work the products will be discussed under a notation to that of the -function .
The function , which will be used is the qimplest function satisfying the diff'erence equation , ( A ) is termed the base , and o ) is termed the parameter of the function .
In case , the function degenerates into gamma function with parameter From a function will be derived . .
It is manifest that when , this function will degenerate into , also that for special values of it will differ from the functions only by an exponential factor of the second degree .
Functions of this nature are discussed by Halphen .
In the discussion of the products with a typical factor functions and to the function and the amma function will be formed , and from these , certain functions denoted , will be derived , satisfying difference equations the parameters , with elliptic function coefficients .

This product is absolutely convergent if By means of the expression we are enabled to write the double product as so that finally we have and a similar equation obtained by transposing .
The transformation carried out in the above work is on the same lines as a transformation given by E. W. Barnes for a function but is simpler owing to the fact that the products are convergent in the above case without necessity arising for the introduction of exponential factors to secure convergence .
