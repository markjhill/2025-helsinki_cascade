The 'Pervenetz ' is an iron-built armour-plated ship of war , constructed for the Russian Government by the Thames Iron and ShipBuilding Company at their works at Blackwall .
2 .
The following are her dimensions : Length ... ... ... ... ... ... . .

The upper and main decks were plated with sheet iron .
4 .
The greater part of the side plating was fixed in England and while the observations recorded in the paper were made , but no part of the end plating was fixed , the plates being taken on board and carried as cargo .
The direction of her head in building was S. 22§ 17t W. magnetic .
5 .
The author was commissioned by the Russian Government to superintend the compass equipment and compass correction of the ship .
He 186 arrived in England a few days before the launch , and immediately undertook the observation of the deviation and the horizontal and vertical force at various selected positions in the ship .
These were the following , viz. five positions on the upper deck , about 4 ft. 6 in .
above the deck , distinguished as b , c , d , e , f , going from stern to bow ; b abaft the mizzenmast , c immediately before the mizzenmast , d before the main-mast , e about the middle of the length , and f before the fore-mast : three on the main deck , g , k , 1 ; g halfway between the mizzen and mainmasts , k below d , and I belowf : two in the hold , near the centre of the ship , m and n ; b being near the place where the neutral plane or rather the surface separating the part of the ship which displayed north magnetism from that which displayed south magnetism intersected the deck , was selected as a place for the standard compass , and a place was prepared for it by making there a false hatchway or compass platform , by replacing an iron beam by a wooden beam , and substituting wood planks for iron plates at that part of the deck .

From the observations , using the notation of the ' Admiralty Manual ' ( which has been translated into Russian by the author for the use of the Imperial Navy ) , by estimating the value of Z and X , and making use of the formula of the Manual , 2nd edit .

These show(1 ) The small deviations on the stocks of the compasses in every position , except near the north end of the ship , where , probably from the armour-plating not being fixed , irregular deviations were to be expected .
2P 187 ( 2 ) The great diminution of horizontal force , especially near the south end .
( 3 ) The very great increase of vertical force near the south end on the upper deck , and the great diminution of the vertical force in descending .
From these we infer that there would be a very large heeling error to windward atf , and a large heeling error to leeward on the main deck .
( 4 ) The very large amount of semicircular deviation , both as regards 3 and ( , the last having a large negative value in consequence of the port-side of the vessel having been to the south in building .
8 .
The best place for the compass is point b , near which the standard compass was afterwards fixed .
9 .
We also see that at the point I the deviations exceed 180 ? .
It is to be observed , however , that from the armour-plating not being fixed , we must not accept this as an instance of what the deviation would be in a completed vessel .
10 .
The 'Pervenetz ' was launched on the 21st of May , and on the same day moved to the Victoria Dccks .
On the way and in the dock the deviations were observed at the point b , and the following values of S , C } , ) were obtained : Q3=+ 639 , -S=--'136 .

Comparing these values with those in Table I. , we see the great changes which the magnetism of the ship had undergone in the Victoria Docks .
15 .
The ship having her head to the east instead of to the west , all the G 's had changed from to + , and having had her head to north instead of south , all the 3 's had diminished .
16 .
From the same cause we see that Z at the stern increases , at the bow diminishes ; at d there is an increase of Z , owing to the machinery under that part of the deck .
17 .
At one point in the main deck Z is negative , showing that the upward vertical force of the ship was greater than the vertical force of the earth .
The great apparent change in H arises from the part of the ship which was south in building , and which consequently attracted the north end of the ship , having been directed to the north , and increasing instead of diminishing the directive force .
18 .
The force of the ship was greatest when the ship was first placed with her head in the new position , and greatly diminished afterwards , as will be seen from the following Table .

50 1752 -038 -7 44 +11 21 -215 ( Z *209 +4504 | +119 to be attributed partly to the want of the transverse armour-plating at the extremities , and to the comparatively small number of bulkheads giving a smaller -e than in the iron-plated ships of the Royal Navy , and partly to the armour-plating of the sides being continued on each side of the compass giving a large --a , and in this respect resembling the effect of the armour-plating in the Royal Oak class of ships in the Royal Navy .
22 .
The large amount of the heeling error in the Main-deck Compass and its direction is remarkable .
23 .
The ' Pervenetz ' sailed for the Baltic on the 8th of August , 1863 .
24 .
The only change in her magnetism on the voyage was an increase in the + , which was no doubt owing to the starboard side being south .
25 .
The principal practical conclusions to be derived from the observations in the ' Pervenetz ' seem to be , ( 1 ) That iron ships should be built head south .
( 2 ) That in whatever direction an iron armour-plated ship is built , she ought to be placed in the opposite direction while plating , so as to reduce the semicircular deviation as much as possible .
This results also from the observations made in the ships of the Royal Navy ; but the plan of plating a ship in the opposite direction to that of building was first practised intentionally , and with the design of reducing the semicircular deviation , in the 'Pervenetz , ' and , as will have been seen , with complete success .
( 3 ) That great and rapid changes take place in the semicircular deviation some time after launching .
( 4 ) The great amount of information both as to the semicircular deviation and the heeling error , which can be obtained by appropriate observations made while the vessel is building .
( 5 ) The importance for this and other purposes , of reducing and recording the deviations of all iron ships , so as to obtain the values of the coefficients , and particularly X and ) , and to be able to estimate them in any new ship of the same class .
( 6 ) The great importance of preparing a proper place for the reception of the Standard Compass in the construction of an iron ship .
