[ Nov. 18 , supposition that the substance is throughout the period of heating coated with a film of water adiathermanous and the external surface of which may be considered as appreciably that of the steam .
The danger then of radiation error , that is , of steam condensing elsewhere than at the surface of the substance , is small .
Condensation , in short , may be considered as taking place by abstraction of the energy of the molecule on impact with the water film .

Communicated by Professor Fitzgerald , F.R.S. Received June 28 , 1886 .
A number of experiments were made on minerals by the method of condensation , using the form of gravimetric calorimeter described in the beginning of the paper on calorimetry ( p. 353 ) .
The condensation of steam being in all cases employed , the values recorded are the mean specific heats between atmospheric temperatures approximating to 12 ' C. , and steam temperature , about 100 ' C. More exactly , the values recorded are the mean calorific capacities for a rise of one degree between the limits tx and \#163 ; 2 , tabulated in each case .
The specimens dealt with were chosen as good samples of the mineral free from visible impurities.* But before detailing the particulars of the experiments a few notes on the discriminative value and physical interest attached to this application of calorimetry may not be amiss.f It seems probable that the neglect of the use of the specific heat constant is to be ascribed to the difficulties besetting its determination .
Certainly if its determination was as easily effected as we effect the determination of the specific gravity of a body , there are on the other hand sufficient reasons to recommend its use as in general of more physical value and interest than the much used specific gravity .
There are cases indeed where specific gravity , as it is possible to obtain it , is misleading , and where specific heat gives at once valuable information on the probable chemical nature of the substance .
Such eases would arise with bodies of loose vesicular or hollow structure .
No misleading variations need be introduced into the thermal constant by mere conditions of volume .
The method of condensation permits of the determination of this constant with very little experimental difficulty .
On the whole * the * I have to thank Professor Sollas for the loan of useful specimens from the Museum of Trinity College .

251 process is involved with no more liability to error than the process of weighing a body in air and in water .
If , however , accuracy \#151 ; greater than 1 per cent.\#151 ; be desired , the operation takes considerably more time , as it is necessary , in securing accurately , to leave thermometer and specimen a sufficient time together in the calorimeter .
The simplicity of the method is perhaps best inferred from the fact that of over 130 experiments on minerals there were but three spoiled\#151 ; due to mishaps ; and it will be seen that the repetition experiments reveal in no case appreciable discrepancy .
That this specific heat constant is very sensitive to the presence of impurities or variations in the chemical nature of the substance cannot be considered a disadvantage .
It is supposable that this might lead occasionally to useful enquiry .
This sensitiveness is shown in the case of tourmaline .
Of three specimens the specific heats were\#151 ; Hemihedral , blacle crystal ... ... . .

0 1 li which in view of the high molecular heat of magnessia and the low molecular heats of the oxides of iron would account for the differences in the experiments .
It will be seen later in the particulars of these experiments that the densities of these crystals also , in a less degree , reveal the difference in composition .
Again attention is suggestively drawn by the thermal constant to the chemical compositions of the first two of theBe three aei'olites from the Museum of Trinity College .

The experiments , in fact , evidently afford strong reasons for believing that the first two aerolites constitute a case of the strange similarity alluded to by Daubree:\#151 ; " II y a des meteorites eloignees au double point de 252 Mr. J. Joly .

It is an important feature that the value of the thermal constant admits of being approximately , sometimes closely , calculated on an assumed chemical composition , and thus can be used in identification where comparative data do not exist or are not at hand .
This fact rests on the experimental basis that the specific heat of the atom is preserved nearly constant through various atomic groupings .
This applies indeed , only so far as the specific heats of the elements have been determined in the solid state ; when the generalisation is applied to molecules containing elements whose specific heats as solids have never been directly determined it ceases to be accurate , and it appears at present as if in each kind of grouping a particular thermal capacity must be assigned to the atom .
Approximate values of these thermal capacities have , however , been calculated by Kopp and others , and thus it is possible in all cases to pronounce for or against an hypothesis as to the nature of a substance , and this not alone in the case of simple salts , but when dealing with the silicates where many different kinds of atoms are present .
In the case of the bisilicate beryl , for example , the most probable formula is 5Be0,2Al203 , H20 , llSi02.t Of these molecules the specific heat of BeO has alone not been directly determined .
We take for the specific heat of Be 0*430 , J and taking the atomic heat of solid oxygen as 4*5\#151 ; the value it affords approximately in compounds having the constitution ROS\#151 ; we assume its sp. h. in the molecule to be 0*281 .
On these assumptions the sp. h. of BeO would be 0*335 .
The atomic weight of Be is taken as 9*1 .
Taking advantage , then , of direct determinations as far as possible , the data are , sp. h. of BeO 0*335 , of A1203 0*198 , j| of H20 0*501 , of Si02 , 0*188.** From these , by an equation similar to Woestyn's\#151 ; ft WS = WjtCjS !

I proceed to quote a case where the identification of a mineral was in this way left to the calorimeter .
The mineral had been assigued a place in a small collection as cryolite , on supposition .
Its sp. h. was found to be 0*2558 .
This at once distinguished it from gypsum\#151 ; sp. h. = 0*278\#151 ; which it resembled in appearance .
As I knew of no experiments on cryolite it was necessary to calculate the constant .
The formula of cryolite\#151 ; 3NaF + AlcjFg\#151 ; includes the sp. hs .
of Na , F , and Al .
Of these F has not been directly determined .
Its probable value was deduced from the sp. h. of fluorspar , which I had found to be 0*2118 .
Ascribing to the calcium in this compound the value 0*170 ( Bunsen ) , the sp. h. of fluorine is deduced as 0*251 , which agrees with Kopp 's result .
The other atoms in cryolite were assumed as follows : to the sodium was assigned Regnault 's value 0*293 , to the aluminium that obtained by myself , 0*223 .
On these assumptions the calculated sp. h. of cryolite is 0*2569 .
The experiment on the hypothetical cryolite affording 0*2558 , the diagnosis was assured .
A test of fusibility now confirmed the result , and subsequently an authentic specimen of cryolite gave 0*2538 .
The calculation may also be effected on the percentage composition .
It is a readier method but , it is remarkable , not so agreeable with the practical result .
Thus in the case of cryolite , Al = 13*21 , F = 53*56 , Na = 32*65 in the mean analysis ( Dana ) , and by the equation S X 100 = w + w2s2 , where w2 , . . .

There is indeed , as might be expected , a connexion apparent between the two , the quantities tending to vary inversely , not only from one substance to another , but in the case of variations in specimens of the same species .
In its physical interest I think calorimetry deserves the attention of mineralogists .
From results which came under notice in the course of the experiments on mineral crystals , I think it will be allowed that questions of interest are raised .
These observations are in one direction only , and I have not had leisure to pursue them with the thoroughness they appear to me to deserve .
Many questions suggest themselves on molecular freedom within the crystal which will need care and preparation to answer , and I now but give in outline an account of observations made , I may say , incidentally .
The crystallographic interest of the thermal capacity is based upon what is apparently an intimate connexion with the amount and kind of freedom possessed by the atoms of the solid .
This is perhaps hardly unexpected .
It is probable that calorific capacity , tending to he reciprocal to the mass of the atom , is more concerned with the intrinsic nature of the atom than with its surroundings .
Still on any hypothesis of a vibratory molecule it is easy to conceive that if the surroundings are such as to hamper its freedom of motion the constraint will be revealed in its specific heat ; that is , if we assume its increase of energy to be kinetic , as in increased amplitude of vibration .
It might be expected then that in the crystal the atom would reveal thermally greater freedom than in the amorphous state .
If , in fact crystalline arrangement be regarded as the result of harmony among molecular vibrations , we would expect for the crystal a specific heat approximating to that of the free molecule , and the more nearly approaching it the more perfectly harmony prevailed in the crystal.* * There are not many experimental 'data for comparing the specific heat of the 1886 .
] On the Specific Heats of Minerals .
It is here assumed that in some way similar to that in which the atom passes into the compound molecule without , in general , sensible change of thermal capacity , the molecule passes into the crystal with only insignificant further change in thermal capacity ; the crystal being regarded in some sense as the chemical combination of the molecule .
Thus we expect the specific heat of the crystal to be lower than that of an amorphous aggregation of its atoms under the constraint of discord .
This agrees with experiment , for it may be stated as true generally that in the crystal the specific heat is lower than in the amorphous state , and that the more perfect and complete the state of crystallisation the lower the observed specific heat .
This , the first fact brought to my notice as experiments multiplied , seems to hold through the nicest indications of crystalline state as facial lustre , degree of translucency , as well as through the more marked indications of cleavage and form , and is probably quite in accord with the well-known fact that rolling , hammering , and such operations as tend to increase the density , diminish the specific heat of metals .
The same would , doubtless , be found to hold in the case of the crystalline polarity conferred on metals by vibration .
I might illustrate the fact by a considerable number of cases where it happened that the specimens dealt with showed differences in crystalline state .
I will only quote a few , referring to the tables for other cases .

The case of opal is , however , uncertain , owing to probable presence of molecule in crystalline freedom with the specific heat of the molecule in gaseous freedom .

[ Nov. 18 , water .
I came on no exceptions .
There is , indeed , a more conspicuous kind of variation shown in the specific heats of minerals not always determinable by external appearances , but this cannot , I think , be classed with the foregoing .
It is , however , difficult at present to draw the line between them .
But so far it seems highly probable that in slight differences of thermal capacity may be recognised a molecular restraint or discord or whatever molecular condition results in opacity , roughness , incompleteness , formlessness .
That other kind of variation to which I allude is of a different order of magnitude , and , I venture to suggest , points to causes of different order .
It suggests the possibility that more than one molecular arrangement may obtain in bodies chemically and crystal lo-graphically , to all appearance , identical .
Bor example , in hexagonal prisms of beryl two very different degrees of molecular freedom would appear to be possible .
Certainly two very different thermal capacities obtain , unexplained by chemical differences or crystallographic form , so far as I can ascertain .
The variation , too , seems in no way connected with the density of the substance , for this may be invariable from one specimen to another , while the difference of specific heat is remarkable .
In many cases this difference of structure , if such it be , is revealed in the behaviour of the substance to light , in the opacity or transparency of the crystal .
So marked is this that specific heats may be at once assigned with certainty to different crystals of known minerals on their opacity or transparency .
In some cases again the substances present no differences whatever in appearance .
The case of beryl stands thus :\#151 ; Sp. h. Sp. gr. |* Transparent , blue , six small crystals ... .

Examination of the twenty analyses collected by Dana.( ' Mineralogy ' ) suggests no explanation on chemical grounds .
The percentages throughout vary in no adequate degree , ascribing to the molecules the thermal values recorded previously in arriving at a result by calculation agreeing with the / 3 specific heat .
I do not think , too , that results independent , as they constantly seem , of density can with probability be ascribed to differences in the amounts of the constituent 1886.1 On the Specific Heats of Minerals .
atoms .
There is more probably some difference in constraint , of a structural kind , afEecting the freedom of the molecules .
Des Cloizeaux is of opinion that the optical examination of emerald , " and above all of beryl , " points to a biaxial constitution.* In recently noting on these same clouded green ^-beryls from our Dublin granite , I had occasion to remark on their optical heterogeneousness.f The extinction of basal sections is not uniform between crossed Nicols ; pale grey cross-hatching is , apparent , and as the mineral is rotated extinguishes capriciously over the field .
In these patches the restoration of illumination is feeble and suggests imperfect coincidence of optic and crystallographic axes .
A still greater variation appears in the sp. h. of corundum from the clouded to the limpid variety , basing the sp. h. of the latter on Regnault 's result on sapphire .
It is remarkable , however , that the variation is in the opposite direction\#151 ; the limpid variety exhibits the higher , the clouded the lower sp. h. Thus :\#151 ; f Corundum ... ... ... ... ... ... 0*197 .

R. This is a variation of 10 per cent , about .
Now the analyses given in Dana 's ' Mineralogy ' of sapphire and corundum , although variable and pointing sometimes perhaps in the direction of the calorimetric result , certainly warrant no such difference , while on the other hand the sp. gr. of the two varieties are invariably opposed to the result being lower in the common variety than in the gem .
It is perhaps remarkable that both these minerals , beryl and corundum , are hexagonal .
A third case occurs in the case of calcite .
I experimented on Iceland spar and on a clouded milk-white rhombohedron , and also on a specimen consisting of an aggregation of dihexagonal prisms .
Adding the observations of others an a and ( 3 variety of calcite is suggested .

Its specific heat has been obtained by ftegnault , Kopp , Neumann , and myself .
The experiments fall into \#171 ; - and / 3-groups , having values identical with those of calcite , and the remarkable fact appears that although the minerals differ in crystalline symmetry and specific gravity , the evidence is in favour of ascribing the same thermal capacities to both .

0*2085 \#151 ; B. Neumann 's result , 0"2018 , probably comes under the a variety .
A coincidence of error adequate to account for this nearly unanimous agreement between the two forms of calcite is improbable .
The inference would appear to be that in both forms the molecules possess nearly equal freedom .
From my own results on transparent crystals of both forms the molecular restraint seems perhaps greater in aragonite .
This is probable , too , from the phenomena attending the heating of aragonite .
The crystals spontaneously break and develope cracks even at the low temperature of the steam ; a phenomenon which , be it observed , probably in some slight degree falsifies the results .
The sp. h. of a specimen of massive rough barites from Glenda-lough , co .
Wicklow , is sufficiently remarkable to justify notice .
In this case the nearly pure nature of the specimen was placed beyond doubt by analysis .

It is certain that the small quantities of impurities present , acting merely by their atomic heats , would not suffice appreciably to alter the sp. h. , and would rather tend to elevate it .

The minerals are iron pyrites ( isometric disulphide of iron ) ; galenite ( isometric sulphide of lead ) ; sphalerite ( isometric sulphide of zinc ) .
The orthorhombic disulphide of iron , marcasite , seems also to fall into the relationship .
The specific heat of pyrites is , according to Regnault , 0*13009 .
Operating on a large bright cube , I obtained the same number exactly , 0*18009 .
Neumann 's result is 0*127 , Kopp 's 0*126 .
The specific heat of galena is given differently by Regnault , Kopp , and Neumann .
The value given by Kopp , 0*0490 , closely agrees with an observation of my own , 0*0492 .
I also obtained 0*0504 and 0*0522 on well crystallised specimens .
The last number is probably a little excessive , as there was just a trace of a white substance\#151 ; the carbonate\#151 ; present .

260 Mr. J. Joly .
[ Nov. 18 , The experiments are so close that any of the recorded values are fairly in the proportion , and some evidently better than the means .
thus if my own results and Neumann 's be alone considered , it will be found that the ratio is almost absolute .
As it stands , on the mean values , the products are as 638 to 640 .
If Neumann 's result for marcasite , 0T33 , be included , we find the more extended proportion\#151 ; ' Pyrites .

126'5 : 130 : 133 : : 491 : 506 : 522 .
But in this the last number is a little excessive , which , as observed , is probably due to impurity .

114 5 : 121-5 : : 1,26*5 : 133 : : 491 : 522 .
If this proportion be examined by products of consequent and antecedent of first term with sum of antecedents and consequents , the products obtained are as 88,938 to 88,909 .
One value only , it will be seen , is omitted from the ratios , that of Neumann , for galena .
It appears to lie outside the proportion , and may either be erroneous or simply indicative of corresponding terms not yet found for the other sulphides .
In conclusion , I would ask in reference to the foregoing remarks , if in the present state of our knowledge there is anything d priori improbable in different molecular arrangements or orientations obtaining under the same crystalline form and affecting to definite extents the thermal freedom of the molecule .
Such differences of arrangement , hardly detectable perhaps by any other means of investigation , might exist unnoticed except when , as possibly occurs in the case of marcasite , prevailing to a degree competent to determine a different symmetry for the aggregate .
Regarding the experiments which follow , I have only now to observe on the precautions observed in effecting them .
The thermometers , certified at Kew , read directly to 0"1 ' C. ; the place of hundredths being obtained by estimation .
The balance used was trustworthy to 0*0005 gram .
To secure accurately indicating the temperature of the substance , thermometer and specimen were left together in the Calorimeter\#151 ; starting at air temperature\#151 ; never less than one and a half hour ; large specimens , X886.J On the Specific Heats of Minerals .
two to three hours ; and the largest were reserved for leaving in all night. .
Specimens presenting at all a porous or loose surface were carefully-dried , often for many days , in an oven , and subsequently preserved over calcium chloride .
Porous or loose substances , not .
of special value , were , for greater surety in drying , broken : into small bits\#151 ; as in the case of the few rock specimens investigated .
To preserve these dry in the calorimeter , while acquiring air temperature , calcium chloride was in some cases placed in the little chamber projecting from the lower part of the sphere .
If counterpoised immediately on being placed in the calorimeter absorption of moisture may evidently be detected , weighed , and its thermal capacity allowed for .
This plan was on a couple of occasions resorted to .
In any cases observed , however , entire neglect of this absorption would have produced but small error .
Supposing errors of the same sign to accumulate through an experiment , I do not think they can have in any case falsified the value of the sp. h. above 04 per cent. This seems probable , too , from the agreement observed on repetition .
Allowance has in all cases been made for the variation of \ with t2 , according to Appendix of last paper .
The effect of the low specific gravity of steam on the apparent weight of condensation has W been allowed for , as\#151 ; =------X 0'62 gram .
With these deductions and Sp. gr. allowance for the precipitation on the carrier and bucket according to range of temperature obtaining , the value of w is deduced as recorded in the tables .
The specific gravities recorded have been reduced to water at 4 ' C. Mr. J. Joly .

( i Note on a paper entitled ' On a New Form of Stereoscope ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 40 , p. 317 ) .
" By A. Stroh .
Communicated by Lord Rayleigh .
Received September 28 , 1886 .
Since the reading of my paper on " A New Form of Stereoscope ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 40 , p. 317 ) my attention has been called to a paper read by Mr. Howard Grubb , F.R.A.S. , at the Royal Dublin Society , 20th January , 1870 .
I find that this paper describes the essential points of the apparatus , and I therefore desire to acknowledge the prior publication by Mr. Grubb .
