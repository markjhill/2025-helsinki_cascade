Account of Magnetic Observations made in the years 1858-61 inclusive , in British Columbia , Washington Territory , and Vancouver Island .
By Captain R. W. HAG , R.A.J Communicated by General SABINE , P.R.S. Received November 4 , -Read November 26 , 1863 .
IN 1858 a Commission was appointed for the purpose of determining and marking the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude from the Pacific to the Rocky Mountains .
At the suggestion of General SABINE , this Commission was provided with a set of portable magnetic instruments adapted for the determination of the three magnetic elements , Dip , Declination , and Total Force .
These instruments were similar in kind to those which had been used on the Magnetic Survey of the United Kingdom .
Before delivery to the Boundary Commission they were examined at the Kew Observatory , and several constants and tables for facilitating the computations were determined and prepared there .
The method of transporting the instruments from place to place , and indeed everything appertaining to the Boundary Commission , was by means of packet mules .
Two boxes ( a very light load for one mule ) contained all the magnetic instruments , which throughout four years of such rough usage retained their original efficiency .
Some of the needles became somewhat rusted ; but I can suggest no alteration in the construction of such instruments , such as would increase their portability .
The declinometer was , I ; think , unsatisfactory as regarded its capability of determining azimuths of the sun : when at an astronomical station , I necessarily had a meridian mark for the transit instrument , and I referred the direction of the magnet to such meridian .
In assembling the results and deducing from them the directions and positions of the lines of equal dip , force , and declination , no notice has been taken of secular change .
The only station at which we have data for judging of the extent of secular change is Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River .
As regards dip , we find there 0J 1830 .
Dip 69 39-7 DOUGLAS .
1839 .
Dip 69 22-2 Sir E. BELCHER .
1860 .
Dip 69 17-4 Present observations .
These figures show an annual diminution of dip of less than 1 ' per annum .
The mean results of the present observations may be assumed to belong to the year 1860 .
The method of assembling the results and determining from them the position and direction of the lines of equal dip , force , and declination , is the same as that adopted in the Survey of the United Kingdom .
It consists in referring all the results to the point of mean longitude and latitude among all the stations , and assuming the differences of longitude and latitude expressed in geographical miles to be plane rectangular coordinates of distance from the origin .
It is also assumed that the three magnetic elements vary uniformly over the whole district surveyed .
Dip .
Table I. gives the individual results at each station , as well as the partial results from the needle when magnetized in opposite directions .
Table II .
shows the mean results , along with the most probable dip at each station computed by the method of minimum squares .
By the method of minimum squares the variation of dip for one mile of longitude x =+0`'272 , and the variation for one mile of latitude y== +0'776 ; from these values we get u=70ยง 42 ' for the angle which an isoclinal line makes with the 1 meridian measured from the north round by west , and or =1216milefor r 2+y 216 mile the distance between isoclinals whose difference of dip is 1 ' .
Column 5 contains the most probable dip at each station ( ' ) , obtained from equations , '=d +ax+by .
The probable error of the computed dip at each station is nearly equal to +5 ' .
Intensity of the Magnetic Force .
The stations where these observations were made are the same as the dip stations .
At ten of them observations of deflection and vibration for the horizontal component were made with the unifilar , and observations by LLOYD'S statical method for variation of the total force ; at the remaining eleven stations the statical method only was employed .
Observations at the first ten stations furnish values of the constant log A , of which a mean value might be adopted for use at the other eleven ; but from an examination of these values of log A , it appears that those belonging to 1861 are generally larger than preceding values , owing , I believe , to the weighted needle having become rusted .
I have therefore adopted the mean of all values of log A previous to 1861 for statical observations up to that period , and the mean of those in 1861 for observations in that year .
The first value is log A=091931 , and that for 1861 is log A=0-92032 .
Table III .
shows the unifilar observations , and the values of X , the horizontal component of the magnetic intensity , derived from them .
Column 12 of this Table contains the dips at the several stations , and column 13 the total force p =X sec 0 .
Panama , the first station in this Table , is not included in the general assemblage of results in Table IV .
, its distance from the other stations being too great .
Table IV .
shows the combination of all observations for force to determine the direction and distance apart of the isodynamic lines .
Column 3 in this Table corresponds to column 13 in Table III .
We find ( x ) the variation in total force for one mile of longitude =+0-000925 , and ( y ) the variation for one mile of latitude =+0-000896 ; r the distance between the isodynamic lines a unit of force apart=776-6 miles , or for a tenth 162 part of a unit= 77T66 miles ; u , the angle which isodynamic lines make with the meridian measured from the north round by west , is 44ยง 6 ' .
Column 11 of Table IV .
contains the most probable value of the total force at each station , and the probable error of one such value is +-0 044 .
Declination .
Table V. is similar in character to Tables II .
and IV .
; by it we find ( x ) the increase of declination for one mile of longitude = +0'*230 , and ( y ) the increase of declination for one mile of latitude = +0 ' 423 ; the distance between lines of equal variation 1 ' apart =2-0756 miles ; therefore , for 1 ?
of difference in the declination , the distance is 124*54 miles ; u , the angle which lines of equal declination make with the meridian measured from the north round by west , is 61ยง 27 ' .
The most probable declinations are shown in column 5 of Table V. , and the probable error of one such result is +27 ' .
The results contained in Tables II .
, IV .
and V. are represented graphicaly in Plate III .
, which exhibits a map of the country surveyed , with the lines of equal inclination , declination , and intensity drawn upon it .
