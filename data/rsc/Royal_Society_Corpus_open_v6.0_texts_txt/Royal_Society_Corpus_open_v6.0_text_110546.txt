" Analysis of the Roots of Equations .
" By the Rev. R. Murphy , M.A. Communicated by John William Lubbock , Esq. , F.R.S. The object of this memoir is to show how the constituent parts of the roots of algebraic equations may be determined by considering the conditions under which they vanish ; and , conversely , to show the signification of each such constituent part .
The following are the propositions on which the author 's investigations are founded .
1 .
In equations of degrees higher than the second , the same con ?
stituent part of the root is found in several places , governed by the same radical sign , but affected with the different corresponding roots of unity as multipliers .
2 .
The root of every equation , of which the coefflcients are rational , contains a rational part ; for the sum of the roots could not otherwise be rational .
This rational part , as such , is insusceptible of change in the different roots of the same equation ; consequently its value is the coefficient of the second term , with a changed sign , divided by the number of roots , or index of the first term .
3 .
The supposed evanescence of any of the other constituent parts , implies that a relation exists between the roots ; and if such a relation be expressed by equating a function of the roots to zero , that constituent part will be the product of all such functions , and a numerical factor .
4 .
The joint evanescence of various constituent parts , implies the coexistencc of various relations between the roots , and that an interpretation may be given to each of the constituent parts , riveting the expression of the root in the memory , and converting the solution of a problem into a condensed enunciation of various theorems .
The author exhibits the application of these principles to equations of various degrees , beginning with quadratic and cubic , and pro ?
ceeding to those involving higher powers .
