[ June 3 , this power of rendering the rice grain diastatic , an effect which has hitherto been attributed only to the germination of the embryo , the question whether the effect is a general one or not , must be left to professed vegetable physiologists .
In conclusion , the pleasant task remains to me of expressing my obligations , and offering my thanks to Hiroyuki Kato , Esq. , President of the University of Tokio , who has rendered my task a comparatively easy one , by the assistance he has given me in various ways .
To Mr. Jihei Kameyama also , the proprietor of the Ttoji manufactory in Yushima , Tokio , I am deeply indebted for the willingness with which I have been allowed to make experiments , and to collect information in his works .
