1 .
An Observation of the Occultation of Mars by the Moon , Oct. 7 .
1736 .
made by Mr. Geo. Graham , F. R. S. in Fleetstreet , London , with a Refracting Telescope of 12 Feet .
October 7th , the first Contact could not be seen for Clouds .
Apparent Time .
H. M. S. At 14 24 44 Mars appeared about half covered , but a distinct View could not be had for flying Clouds .
14 25 21 Mars totally covered , the last Ray of Light being then lost .
15 11 22 The Moon appeared , but Mars was not seen , no Part being yet emerged .
15 15 11 I judged it was quite emerged , but Clouds prevented the Moon 's Limb from being distinctly seen .
2 .
An Observation of an Occultation of Mars by the Moon , in Covent-Garden , 1736 .
by J. Bevis , M. D. BEfore the Eclipse , I took several Differences of Right Ascension and Declination between ~ and ~ Piscium , for ascertaining the true Place of Mars : As also several Differences of Right Ascension and Declination between the Moon and Mars , before and after the Eclipse , which I shall give another Time : Octob. 7 .
P. M. Apparent Time .
H. M. S. 14 24 10 I was surprised to see Mars continue quite round , though hardly , to Appearance , disjoin 'd from the scabrous Edge of the Moon ; but that Instant I thought it began to lose its Figure .
-Clouds .
14 25 26 The Moon shone out bright again , but Mars was entirely vanished .
15 14 46 The Moon being just clear of a Cloud , I saw Mars partly emerged .
15 14 49 He seemed just half out ; then Clouds came on again , so that I saw not the final Contact .
The Moon 's Diameter was 21,157 Parts of the Micrometer and its illuminated Part passed over the horary Thread in 2 Minutes , 3 Seconds .
I am certain of the Time to 2 or 3 Seconds .
