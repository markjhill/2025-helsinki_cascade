( Abstract .
) Mechanical difficulties preclude the study of fossils by serial thin slices , but serial polished surfaces may be obtained at any desired degree of proximity , and these , when the fossil and its matrix offer sufficient optical contrast , serve most of the purposes of thin slices .
They may be photographed under the microscope , so as to furnish a trustworthy and permanent record .
The sections may be used to obtain reconstructions of the fossil in wax .
Several fossils have been successfully studied in this way : such as Pakeospondylus Gunni , Ophiura Egertoni , Lapwortlmra Afiltoni , Monograptus priodon and Palceodiscus ferax .
The sections are obtained at regular intervals , usually of 0 * 025 mm. , by means of an apparatus designed for the purpose by the Eev .

( Abstract .
) This fossil , which has been variously referred to an alliance with Lampreys , Tadpoles , and Lung-fish , has been successfully studied by means of serial sections .
The ventral surface of the head bears four pairs of branchial bars , with the last of which two post-branchial plates , the so-called " post-occipital " plates , are associated ; in front of the branchial bars are two pairs of structures , which are regarded as representing the lower jaw and hyoid ; they are supported by a 1903 .
] Account of Palseospondylus Gunni , 99f suspensory apparatus , which may represent the palato-quadrate and hyo-mandibular elements .
The branchial arches are wholly unlike anything seen in Marsipobranchs , but call to mind the similar structures in the Dipnoi and larval Amphibians .
The dorsal side of the skull shows a large cranial cavity with thin vertical walls , but no-complete roof , a pair of auditory and a pair of nasal capsules .
Tho eye was situated over a structure which resembles a sub-orbital bar , but which is sub-divided into a hyo-mandibular and palato-quadrate element .
At the anterior extremity of the skull are processes which may be compared with the rostal processes of Elasmobranchs .
The vertebrae are cyclo-spondylous , with large neural arches .
The organism was evidently a primitive fish , with some features which are suggestive of Marsipobranchs , some of Elasmobranchs , and .
some of young Dipnoi or larval Amphibians ; after branching off from the Piscine stem , at a point below the origin of the Elasmobranchs , it pursued an independent course of development .
The substance of which the fossil consists is a true coal : Coceosteus is sometimes similarly preserved , and an analysis of the latter , kindly made by Mr. J. E. Marsh , M.A. , yielded the following results :\#151 ; Carbon ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 68*4 Hydrogen ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
4*5 Oxygen ( by difference ) ... ... ... ... 11 * 3 Ash ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

13*6 15*25 100*0 100*00 skeleton of Coccosteus also occurs in a different state of fossilisation : in this the organic matter has disappeared , leaving a-mineral residue , in which the original structure is preserved , and may be recognised as that of bone .
Thus definite proof is afforded of a transformation , previously suspected , by which bone may be converted into coal .
