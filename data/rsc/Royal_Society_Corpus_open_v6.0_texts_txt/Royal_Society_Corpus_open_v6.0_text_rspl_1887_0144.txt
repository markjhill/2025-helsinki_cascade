It is frequently asserted and commonly believed that tidal currents do not exist in the open ocean or in waters remote from land .
Oceanic currents , that is , streams which set more or less constantly in one general direction , are well-known and , from their importance to navigation , have been the objects of much study .
Chief among these may be mentioned the Gulf Stream and the Equatorial Currents in both oceans .
The data on which almost all our information connected with these streams rests are furnished by the logs of ships traversing them .
When the position of the ship is determined from day to day by good astronomical observations on the one hand , and the courses and distances sailed are carefully observed and noted on the other , it is usual , after allowing for known perturbing causes , to ascribe the differences between the positions as ascertained by " observation " and by " dead reckoning " to the effect of a current .
As in the ordinary routine of a sea-going ship , the positions are made up from noon to noon , the strength and direction of the current so deduced is the integral resultant " set " of the previous twenty-four hours .
The direction and strength of the current may have changed in any way during that time , and it would be nearly impossible to detect such changes .
The period of twenty-four hours corresponds closely with that of the tidal wave , consequently in the time elapsing between two successive noons , whatever effect may have been due to a tidal cause will have completely reproduced itself twice over and a very little more .
The resultant current due to the tide during the two complete periods will be nothing , and the only resultant current affecting the day 's reckoning will be that due to the difference beOn Tidal Currents the Ocean .

] tween the solar and lunar day .
' From the nature of the observations the effect due to this would not be easily detected .
It is evident then that the ordinary method of observing oceanic currents is such as completely to cloak any tidal effect which may exist .
The proximate source of energy for the production of tidal currents is the tidal wave .
Storm waves are confined to the surface of the ocean , and break \#166 ; only in comparatively shallow water .
The tidal wave affects the deepest oceans to the bottom .
It might , therefore , be reasonably expected that , in passing over many of even the deeper ridges which traverse the ocean bed , its character as an undulation would be modified with the production of a true tidal current .
We know that in the shallow water surrounding the land and in the bays and inlets which indent its coasts , a portion of the tidal energy is dissipated by " the partial transformation of the wave into currents .
In littoral waters these currents are necessarily exaggerated by the confinement produced by the neighbouring land ; but the presence of a shoal alone , without any dry land in the vicinity , ought to be sufficient to produce well-marked and regular tidal currents .
Considerations of this nature determined me to take the first opportunity which might offer of putting the matter to the test of observation .
Thanks to the hospitable invitation of the India Rubber , Gutta Percha , and Telegraph Works Company , of Silvertown , I had the good fortune to spend the months of October and November , of 1883 , on board the s.s. " Dacia , " one of their excellently equipped cable ships , which , along with the s.s. " International , " was sent out to connect Cadiz with the principal islands of the Canary Group by means of a telegraph cable .
The whole expedition was under the oommand of the Company 's Telegraphic Engineer-in-chief , Mr. Robert Kaye Gray , to whom I am particularly indebted for the facilities which were afforded me in carrying out this and many other investigations , and I beg publicly to tender him my best thanks .
' In the course of the sounding operations carried out with a view of gaining a thorough acquaintance with the depth and nature of the sea bottom , over which it was proposed to lay the cable , many remarkable inequalities were met with .
Perhaps the most striking was one which was called the " Dacia Bank , " after the ship on which it was discovered .
This bank , which occupies a surface of 50 square miles with less than 100 fathoms of water on it , rises rapidly from the prevailing depth of 1800 or 1900 fathoms to within 500 fathoms of the surface , whence the slope is very abrupt and in many places precipitous to within 100 fathoms of the surface .
As the bank lay close to the proposed route of the cable , two days were spent in surveying it carefully .
In order to have a fixed point to refer the soundings to , a 2 c 2 342 Mr. J. Y. Buchanan .
[ Feb. 2 , mark-buoy was anchored in 175 fathoms , just outside the precipitous edge of the bank .
On the afternoon of the 21st October , 1883 , I spent several hours in one of the ship 's boats made fast to this buoy , and during that time I made frequent observations of the rate and direction of the surface current as well as of the general direction of the undei current .
( See Table I. ) It had been observed during the previous day and night that at times the current set strongly to the southward , at other times became nearly slack and even ran to the northward .
While the boat was being lowered and got away the ship drifted very slowly to the northward past the buoy and against a light northerly air blowing at the time .
When the boat was made fast to the buoy the current was found setting to the northward , against the wind and sea , and measures were immediately taken for determining its direction and velocity at frequent intervals .
For this purpose an ordinary life-buoy was attached to the end of a line which was marked at every fifth fathom with a piece of wood , which also served the purpose of keeping the line afloat and of showing whether it was going out straight or not .
Although the wind was only barely perceptible , it was found to retard the life-buoy .
An arrangement of canvas was accordingly weighted and hung down in the axis of the buoy .
This greatly increased its hold on the water and made its movements dependent only on the current .
The direction of the current was observed with a pocket azimuth compass for use on land .
Although there was hardly any wind , there was a considerable swell coming up from the north , but it did not produce any motion sufficiently violent to interfere with the use of the compass .
In order , however , to remove any uncertainty , which might have existed with regard to the correctness of the bearings so observed , I always took a bearing of the sun at the same time , as an index of the trustworthiness of the current observations .
No accurate measurements were made of the under current , but while the surface current was being observed a tow-net lashed to a sounding line was lowered to 35 fathoms for one hour , and to 70 fathoms also for an hour .
The directon taken by the sounding line showed that down to 75 fathoms the direction inclined slightly more to the eastward than the surface current , and its strength seemed to be slightly greater . .

' The observations are too few in number to make it worth while submitting them to analysis , but a little study of them will show that they indicate a current which is the resultant of a constant current and a periodic one .
A constant current running S.E. by E. , combined with a tidal current running 1ST .
N.W. and S.S.E. , the maximum velocity of which , in either direction , is twice that of the permanent current , would give a resultant current agreeing fairly with that observed."* In these circumstances , during a complete tidal interval the water flows along an 3_bke path , and in the twenty-four hours it describes two such figures , and moves on in a zig-zag course .
It is apparent that the integral drift in the twenty-four hours is that due to the constant current alone independently of the tidal current .
The same holds for twelve hours .
Hence , if observations are carried on at frequent and regular intervals for twelve hours , we are able to determine both the constant current and the tidal current superposed on it , and it is to be hoped that when they can be made they will not be neglected by surveying ships and telegraph ships .
Many banks are already known in the Horth Atlantic on which such observations could conveniently be made , and there are probably many more scattered about the ocean , for instance , on the ridge called after the U.S.S. " Dolphin , " which extends along a somewhat crooked line from the Azores to Tristan da Cunha .
It is of course important to have fine weather ; then the boat in which the observations are made * * Edinburgh , Roy .

] should , if possible , be moored with two lines to prevent swaying .
In cable ships large mushroom anchors with heavy chain bridles are in common use .
If one of them is dropped , a ship 's boat may be anchored to it with no more line than is required to reach the bottom , and be in no danger of swaying .
Similar observations should be made also from a boat anchored in very deep water .
No measurements were made of the under current , 'but by sinking a tow-net made fast to a sounding line , it was seen to be running in the same direction as the surface current , and apparently with much the same velocity .
In the channels between the Canary Islands where even on the shallowest ridges the water is over 1000 fathoms in depth , the tidal current reaches to the very bottom , and its scouring action is shown by the nature of the bottom .
To seaward in 1800 to 2000 fathoms the bottom is a fine Glohigerina ooze , which gets coarser and sandier as the water shoals in the channels , till on the summit ridge there is generally no deposit at all , and the bottom is rock or coral coated with black oxide of manganese .
Round the western end of Tenerife the tide runs violently causing rips and over-falls .
Much rocky ground is met with in the North Atlantic in depths of even 1300 and 1400 fathoms , especially on the ridge which extends through the whole length of that ocean .
It is not unlikely that the summit edge of this ridge is swept clean through the greater part of its length , and it must be remembered that the removal of sediment from one part of the ocean bottom means its deposit in greater abundance in others , and especially in hollows in the neighbourhood of the ridge .
Hence a sounding in " ooze or clay " in one position furnishes no argument against the trustworthiness of another sounding in the vicinity and in equally deep water on " rock " or " hard ground .
" Such ridges are great enemies to telegraph cables , for while the tidal currents keep the rock-surface clean , they also tend to give the cable an oscillating or surging motion , which is apt to bridge it in rubbing contact with the rock-surface and so to wear it through .
On the other hand these currents , in sweeping clean the rocky eminences at the bottom of the ocean , prepare a lodging place for deep-sea corals , and bring food to them when settled , thus enabling them to build up their pillar-like banks , a very fine example of which was discovered and surveyed by the " Dacia " on the 12th October , 1883 . .
It lies in lat. 34 ' 57 ' N. , long .
13 ' 57 ' W. , and the shoalest sounding was 435 fathoms .
The surface of the bank was locally very rough , and sloped gradually to the edge in about 550 fathoms , when it terminated in an actual precipice , dropping to 835 fathoms in one place .
The coral on this bank was living and growing in the greatest luxuriance , and many specimens which were brought up showed that the living corals were growing on a mass of dead ones .
There can On Tidal Currents the Ocean .
[ Feb. 2 , therefore be little doubt that in this case we have a submarine bank which is in vigorous growth towards the surface , and which has been in existence long enough to have risen through a height of about 300 fathoms or 1800 feet .
I have little doubt that in a large number of the coral islands of the Pacific , the intermediate platform between the tropical reef-building coral and the volcanic peak , plateau , and ridge , which most probably form the foundation , is formed by these deep-sea corals largely assisted by annelids , especially Serpulee , which secrete calcareous tubes .
The tidal currents assist their growth both by bringing the animals nourishment and by removing light debris which might choke them .

( Abstract .
) In a former communication the authors described simultaneously with Dr. Huggins the strongest portion of the spectrum of water , subsequently they described a second less strong but more refrangible section of the same spectrum .
M. Deslandres has noticed a third still more refrangible section .
The authors now find that the spectrum extends , with diminishing intensity , into the visible region on the one hand , and far into the ultra-violet on the other .
These faint parts of the spectrum they have photographed , using the dispersion of a single calcite prism and a lengthened exposure ; and in the present communication they give a map of the whole extent observed , and a list of wave-lengths of upwards of 780 lines .
