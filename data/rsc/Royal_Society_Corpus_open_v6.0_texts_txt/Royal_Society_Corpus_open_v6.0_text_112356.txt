" Further particulars of the Swedish Arctic Expedition , in a Letter addressed to the President , by Prof. NOltDENSKIOLD .
" Communicated by the President .
Received October 15 , 1868 .
Kobbe Bay , Sept. 16th , 1868 .
SIR , In my last letter from Stockholm I promised to send you , with the returning naturalists , a detailed relation of the first scientific part of the Swedish Arctic Expedition of 1868 ; but unfortunately our last coalship , with which five of our fellow travellers , with the rich geological , zoological , and botanical collections , made during this season in the arctic regions , return to Tromso , and which gives us the last occasion of communicating with Europe , leaves this harbour in some hours , and that makes it impossible for me to keep my promise .
However , a detailed report will immediately be sent to you by one of the returning naturalists , Dr. Malmgren , a member also of the expeditions of 1861 and 1864 .
The remaining part of our expedition will from here go , first , to Seven Island , and then ( perhaps one of the first days of October ) , after having deposited a boat and a depot of provisions on Ross Islet , further northward .
The polar sea was in the end of August quite covered with ice north of 81ยง 9 ' , the highest latitude hitherto reached by our steamer .
But a week later the sea was open to Walden and Table Island , and the 8th of September I could , from one of the highest peaks of Parry Island , discern only traces of ice further northward .
I remain , Sir , respectfully yours , A. I. NOIDENSKIOLD .
