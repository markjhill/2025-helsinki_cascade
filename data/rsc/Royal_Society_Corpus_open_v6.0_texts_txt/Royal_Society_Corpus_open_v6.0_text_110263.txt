A paper was read , entitled an " Account of a new mode of propelling Vessels .
" By Mr. Wm. Hale .
Communicated by Richard Penn , Esq. F.R.S. The author ascribes the want of success which has hitherto attend ?
ed all attempts to propel vessels by a discharge of water from the stem , to the injudicious plan of the apparatus employed , and notto any defect in the principle itself : for he considers that thereaction upon the vessel from which a volume of water is thrown , depends in no degree on the resistance it meets with from the medium into which it is ejected , but simply upon the momentum given to the mass .
The author proposes to accomplish the object of propelling water by means of an instrument having the form of an eccentric curve , resembling the spiral of Archimedes , made to revolve on an axis .
The resistance offered to the water in which it is immersed results from the different distances of the two ends of the spiral propeller from the axis .
This propeller acts in a box having also a somewhat spiral form , and the space between the two ends of the spiral , after descrihing one turn , is open to allow of the exit of the water driven out by the propeller .
The bottom of the box has a circular aperture , of which the radius is equal to the distance of the shorter end of the propeller from the axis .
The water within this circle meets with no resistance until it arrives at the line joining the two extremities of the propeller , when it is immediately acted upon by the eccentric curved surface of the propeller .
