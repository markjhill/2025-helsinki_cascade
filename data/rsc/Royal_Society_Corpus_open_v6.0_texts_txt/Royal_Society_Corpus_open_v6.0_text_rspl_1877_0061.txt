The object of this inquiry was ( 1 ) to determine the relation between ncreased resistance to the passage of an electric current and stretching-force ; ( 2 ) to ascertain how much of the increased resistance in each case is produced by mere increase of length and diminution of section .
In order to determine the increase of resistance from stretching , the wires were each divided into two parts about 14 feet or more in length .
One end of each part was fastened to a stout hook , firmly fixed into a block of wood , the two hooks used being about 8 inches apart , and the block of wood in which they were fixed securely fastened across two strong uprights , which were placed resting against the wall , so that the weights attached to the wires might swing clear of the table on which the uprights were placed .
A loop was made at the other end of each part * See Proe .

Mr. H. Tomlinson on the Increase in Resistance of the wire , and to this the weights were attached by means of strong hooks .
The two parts of the wire were joined at the top , about 2 inches below each hook , by a piece of copper wire , which was securely solderec I on to each part of the wire , so as to connect them ; and toward th\#187 ; i lower extremities of the two parts , about 5 inches above the points o attachment of the weights , two copper wires were soldered so as to con nect the wires with a Wheatstone 's bridge .
The increase of resistance of the wires was measured by means of a sliding scale of platinum wire divided into millimetre divisions , each equal to *00166 ohm .
As tin object was to obtain the temporary and not the permanent increase o resistance ( which permanent increase was found more or less with al I the wires ) , weights slightly heavier than those intended to be used were \lt ; I first put on and taken off .
Afterwards the wire was balanced as nearlj as possible by German-silver wire , without the sliding scale , and thei very exactly with the sliding scale , which was connected with one of two resistance-coils of 100 ohms each , which formed the other two sides o : I the bridge .
The weights used were then carefully put on to the wires and the increase of resistance measured by means of the sliding scale the weights were next taken off again , and the sliding scale used foi balancing once more .
If there was any slight difference , as sometime !
I occurred , between the readings of the sliding scale before the weights I were put on and after they were taken off , the mean of the two readings I was taken .
In order to secure still greater accuracy , as many as eight or ten trials I were frequently made with each particular weight , and the mean of al | the trials taken .
This precaution was necessary , as there were continuai I small variations from slight changes of temperature in the air of the room .
These variations of temperature caused at first great trouble in the case of iron and steel wires , as the slightest difference of temperature was at once shown by the shifting of the light on the scale of the Thomson 's reflecting galvanometer employed .
This instrument was sc delicate that the warmth of the hand placed 6 inches from the wire caused a perceptible shifting of the light .
It was , indeed , partly owing to this difficulty that the observation of the permanent increase from stretching was not attempted .
I have , however , since devised a plan foi getting rid of this alteration from changes of temperature , and I hope to .
be able to make other experiments with wires in which the permanent as well as the temporary increase of resistance will be observed .
Most of ^ the observations of the steel and iron wires were made at first in the evening , with the doors and windows shut , as it was found almost impossible to take very exact observations in the daytime .
The disposition of the wires is shown in the accompanying sketch .
In order to avoid heating the wires by the current , a single Leclanclffi cell was employed , and an increase of resistance = 3 of the whole could easily be measured .

Greatest de parture from the mean about 8-5 pei cent. It will be seen from the last Table that the values of - are as constam 1 as could be expected in the case of wires of the same material , but diffei ' for wires of different materials , being greatest for brass .
The value of Young 's modulus for some of the wires was ascertained in the usual manner with the cathetometer .
The wires were firmlv secured at the top of a staircase , and a mark placed about 3 feet abovt the point of attachment of the weights at the bottom , so that the stretch- -ing of about 21 feet of the wire could be observed and the increase oi a\#174 ; length for different weights observed .
A mark was also made near the top of the wire , in order to examine if there was any yielding of the Id* support to which the upper end of the wire was attached , and for some of the wires a reading was taken both at the top and bottom marks ; but as after several trials there was no apparent yielding , in the last experi- pof ments made the mark only at the bottom was observed ; Weights heavier than those intended to be used were first put on and then taken off again several times ; finally a weight was left on the wire sufficient to keep it perfectly straight .
Then weights were carefully added , the increase of length observed with the cathetometer ; and the weights having been taken off , another reading taken , and if there was any slight difference in the readings before adding the weight and after taking it off , the mean of the two readings was taken .
The results agreed very fairly with each other\#151 ; -how much so may be gathered from the following example ( two trials with each weight were taken):\#151 ; Iron ( No. 2 ) .

The value of Young 's modulus was also ascertained by means of longitudinal vibrations of sound .
The two ends of the wire to be examined were securely soldered into two strong flat iron bars , one of Ik the bars was fastened in a vice , firmly secured , whilst the other bar was held in the hand , and the wire pulled with sufficient force to enable a to the Passage of an Electric Current .
lear note to be got out of the wire by rubbing it longitudinally with a esined glove .
The wire was then clipped in the centre and rubbed again o test the security of the fastenings , as it was found that if the bar in he vice was not well secured the note produced by clipping in the centre tras not the octave of the note given out by the unclipped wire , but if he bar were well fastened a clear and perfect octave could be produced .
The number of longitudinal vibrations was ascertained by means of the iren , generally three or four trials of 3 minutes each being taken .
In his work I was assisted by Mr. Purse ( the assistant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy at King 's College ) , to whom I am much indebted for help in my experiments .
The records of the siren were very good ndeed , in every case there never being a greater difference than fa per sent .
, and in many cases less .
But on experimenting with different lengths of the wires the values of the modulus would vary as much as L or 2 per cent. , so that , though some of the values obtained are recorded , [ have chosen the more reliable ones of the cathetometer for calculating the increase of length of each wire when stretched .
In the following Table the amount of lengthening which a cubic centimetre of each wire experiences for a stretching-force of 1 gramme is given ; these values will be denoted by :\#151 ; Values of\#151 ; obtained from Values of\#151 ; obtained from e observations with the e observations on longicathetometer .

2*203 It would seem that the increase per cent , of resistance for a give : lengthening of a wire is greater in iron than in steel , and much greate in both iron and steel than in brass , but that the increase per cent , o resistance per unit of stretching-force employed is greater in brass thai in iron , and greater in iron than in steel .
The torsional rigidity of the wires was then ascertained , the vibrator used being similar to those used by Sir William Thomson in his experi ments on the rigidity and viscosity of metals ( Proc. of Eoy .
Soc. , Ma 1865 ) , namely , thin cylinders of sheet brass , turned true outside an* inside , supported by a thin , flat , rectangular bar .
The wire to be teste* passed perpendicularly through a hole in the middle of the bar , and wa there firmly soldered .
The cylinder was tied to the horizontal bar b ; light threads , so as to hang with its axis vertical ; the other end of th wire was securely soldered into a stout iron bar , firmly held in a vie attached to a rigid support .
Two experiments with different lengths o wire were made with each wire , the result of each of the two experiments agreeing very closely , as , for instance , we may take as an averag* example Steel No. 3 , in which the torsional rigidities in grammes pe : square centimetre in the two trials were 783*5 x 106 and 782*2 x 106 .
If we assume the wires to be isotropic , we can , from the values of and the rigidity , which latter value will be denoted by r , obtain the rati* of lateral lineal contraction to longitudinal dilatation ; denoting this ratio by \lt ; r , we shall obtain ( Thomson and Tait 's Nat. Phil. p. 521 ) \lt ; r-1 , ant therefore easily deduce the increase of resistance that would follow ii the case of each wire from mere increase of length and diminution oi section , without considering any other alteration of resistance tha ' would result from stretching .
Calling els the increase of resistance tha : would result from mere increase of length and diminution of section , we can prove that to the Passage of an Electric Current .
Again subtracting from the values of \#151 ; those of \#151 ; we shall obtain be residual alteration of resistance produced by the stretching-force .
[ Since making the above experiments I have found that Sir William Thomson has investigated the effects of strain on iron and copper , and tates that he attempted to eliminate the effects of elongation and nar-owing , and had very nearly established , for iron wire at least , that the ugmented resistance due to tension , either temporary or permanent , is i very little more than can be accounted for by the change of form .

In all probability this residual increase is due to the increased distance between the particles of the wire along the line of ^ flow o e current ; and perhaps , if we examined the effect of strain in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the current , there wo a diminution of resistance ; but I have experiments now in hand by which I hope to show the effect of strain in a direction at right angles to that of the current .
In conclusion , I may mention that , in testing or e VOL. XXVI .

[ Nov. 15 , increase of resistance from stretching , when the weights were taken of the wire did not immediately attain the resistance which it ultimateh settled at , but gradually recovered itself in about three minutes .
This effect was very perceptible with the thicker wires , where heaw weights were employed .
I suppose the effect may , at any rate , be partb attributed to the heat which would be generated when the wire recoverec its former volume ; but I am not at all satisfied that the whole of the effee : observed was due to this cause .
The conclusions to be drawn from the experiments are : \#151 ; 1 .
That the temporary increase of resistance of a wire when stretchec in the same direction as the current is exactly proportional to the stretching-force .
2 .
That the increase per cent , of resistance when a cube of each material is stretched by the same weight is greater in iron wire than in stee .
wire , and greater in brass wire than in iron wire ; also that this increase is nearly the same for different specimens of the same material .
3 .
That the increase per cent. , when the material is stretched to the same extent , is much greater in iron and steel wires than in brass wire , and is probably greater in iron wire than in steel wire .
4 .
That there is a residual increase in each case , over and above that which would follow from mere increase of length and diminution of section , that this residual increase is much greater in iron and steel than in brass , and greater in iron than in steel .
