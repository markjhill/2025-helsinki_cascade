V.P.R.S. &amp;c. Received June 17 , 1852 .
This paper has reference to a former communication " On a General Law of Density in Saturated Vapours .
" In the present paper the author states that the formulme that embrace MM .
Dulong and Petit 's four standard mean values of the relative expansion of air , mercury and glass , exhibit the temperature by the air-thermometer in advance of the mercurial thermometer , between 0 ?
and 100 ?
C. The amount of difference increases from 0 ?
to 48 ?
, and then diminishes to 100 ?
; the maximum value being 0 ?
'513 .
Tlle most eminent modern authorities deny the existence of any such difference , or appear tacitly to admtit that it is too small to be observed .
For this reason no correction was made on temperatures below 100 ?
in Chart No. 2 , where indeed it could hardly be perceptible .
Although of little practical importance , this difference , if it exists , cannot safely be neglected in theoretical researches , inasmuch as the value of a degree of the mercurial thermometer must in such case be a variable quantity , differing in the ratio of 23 to 24 from 100 ?
C. to 0 ? .
Having at last obtained satisfactory proof of the existence and amount of the correction between 0 ?
and 100 ?
, he has thought it of sufficient importance to give a detailed account of the method employed to extract the required evidence from M. Regnault 's .
observations on the tension of low pressure steam .
As the law of density , illustrated in Chart No. 2 , has clearly reference to the air-thermometer , if a series of observations were perfectly correct , they must perfectly exhibit this difference-if it really exists -when projected on the chart ; because the divergence from the line that joins the points at 0 ?
and 100 ?
must exactly correspond with the correction required at the intermediate temperatures .
In short , the line of density would appear as a curve slightly concave towards the axis , and if the proper correction were made on the temperatures , that curve would be converted into a straight line .
This view is illustrated by a sketch , in which the curvature is purposely much exaggerated .
In this a straight line is drawn , as the gradient of density , and in which the points range if the temperatures are by the air-thermometer .
This line is inclined to the axis , of temperature , at an angle of which his the cotangent ( see 'Proceedings , ' vol. vi .
p. 98 ) .
At points in it corresponding to temperatures 50 ?
, 60 ?
, 70 ?
, &amp;c. , straight lines are drawn parallel to the axis x ; and at distances in these e qhl to the respective computed differences , straight lines are drawn at right angles to the axis x , and meeting the lines of constant pressure drawn through the corresponding points of the straight line which represents the gradient of density .
The curved line passing through the points of intersection , is that in which the points of density range if laid off to the temperatures by the mercurial thermometer .
The author then states that tht e first attempt was made.by obtaining the value of the constants g and h ( ' Proceedings , ' vol. vi .
p. 98 ) from the observation at 50Q and 100 ?
; then computing the intermediate tensions at 60 ?
, 70 , &amp;c. , and comparing them with observation .

It is remarked that the differences in the first table show a distinct curvature with reference to the chord ; while in the second table the accordance with the straight line is as perfect as could be expected .
With the view of bringing these facts out into higher relief and presenting the deflection to the eye on a scale that should at once be relatively correct and very highly magnified , the author computed six values of h from the observations at 90 ?
and 100 ?
, at 80 ?
and 100 ? .
&amp;c. , without correcting the temperatures , by the formula t , -tl P2_ pI t2 tl These are given in the following table ; they are quantities proportional to the cotangents of the inclination of the chords to the axis of temperature .

The differences in this table are progressively increasing , and their relation to each other is very nearly that of the corresponding differences of the inclination of the chords .
They are:represented by these inclinations in a figure , and , in order.to-render the divergence from a straight line more manifest , the scale taken is 10 ?
angular measure to the unit of difference , the length of the chords corresponding with .
the intervals of temperature below 1.00 .
Joining the extremities of the ehhoxds , a magnified view is obtained , of the curve determined from observations with temperatures uncorrected .
On this the author remarks , that if the temperatures required no correction , the points so determined would lie in a straight line , always %s , t akingIJr , granted the integrityof the law of density and the perfect aeuay of the observation .

is precisely what might be expected to subsist between the empirical and true curve of tension1 .
't intersects that line-and intersection , not contact , is the character of empirical formulae-at 50 ?
, 750 , and 1000 , and at intermediate temperatures diverges from it-to the extent of about:th of adegreea at the':maximum .
ilThus , he states , M IRegnault 's observitions:between 50 ?
and 1000 afford a distinct answer to the inquiry in the affirmative , and dit seems no longer possible to doubt that there is a difference between the mercurial and air-thermometers below 100 ?
; and that its amount does not sensibly differ from the formulae that einbrace MM .

In conclusion the author observes , it might be expected , without reference to theory , that the curve deduced from the uncorrected temperatures should not show , in its continuation above 100 , any abrupt divergence from its regular course ; nevertheless from 100 ?
to 111'74 the direction of the chord showss such a break in the .
lav of continuity , and which there appears no way of accounting for , unless by a fault in the observations above 100 ? .
Their divergence from the law of density is shown in the Chart .
