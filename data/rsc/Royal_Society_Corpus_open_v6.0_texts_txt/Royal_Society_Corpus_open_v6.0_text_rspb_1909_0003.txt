) The object of the research was to determine by experiment on man whether goitre was caused by matter held in suspension in goitre-producing waters ; and to ascertain , as far as possible , the nature of the suspended ingredient which had been surmised to be responsible for the production of the disease .
Thirteen individuals , including myself , were given suspended matter , which had been removed by filtration from goitre-producing water , every morning before the first meal of the day .
I and three others developed enlargements of the thyroid gland .
The experiment was repeated in the case of eight individuals who were given the same suspended matter , which had previously been boiled for 10 minutes ; in no case did any enlargement of the thyroid gland occur .
It is concluded from these results that goitre is due to a living organism of disease present in the water .
The incubation period of experimentally-produced goitre was 13 to 15 days .
It is thought probable that the organism of goitre exists as an intestinal parasite in goitrous individuals , since an intestinal antiseptic appeared to have a marked curative effect .
Experiments were made on monkeys to test the possibility of the spread of the disease by the fseces of infected individuals , with negative results .
Plentiful amoebic infection of the intestine was found in the majority of cases of goitre examined .
It is not known , however , whether amcebse have any relationship to the disease .
The research was carried out in Gilgit ( Kashmir ) , and the results obtained refer only to goitre as it occurs there .
