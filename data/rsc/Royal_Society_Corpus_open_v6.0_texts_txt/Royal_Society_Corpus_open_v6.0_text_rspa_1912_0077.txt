] Functions and their Fourier Series .
In the same connection the following formula will be found of use :\#151 ; ( uv dx log\uvdx^\uv log J uv log f ua dx .
Such inequalities will be found useful , for example , in extending the results on Fourier series contained in my paper on " Successions of Integral and Fourier series .
" S 7 .
We thus obtain , for example , theorems of the following type:\#151 ; If Sn denote the n-th Cesdro partial summation of the Fourier series of a positive function f(x ) , which is such that f ( x ) log/ pc ) is summable , and Tn denote the n-th Cesdro partial summation of the Fourier series of the function f ( x ) log / ( x ) , then ( p ) log ( ) \#151 ; 1 From this also we deduce that , if fn ( ) denote the n-th Cesdro partial summation of the Fourier series of a function f(x ) which is such that | log | f(x ) | is summable , then I \fn ( x ) j log \fn ( p ) | dx has the unique double limit zero , when Je E \#151 ; 0 and n-*oz ; and that fn{F ) log fn 0 ) dx \f(P ) log fip ) dx .
Finally we may remark that from analogous considerations we may establish the truth of the following general theorem on double successions:\#151 ; If fnip ) and gm(x ) denote the Cesdro summations of the first ( 2^+1 ) terms of the Fourier series of two functions f(x ) and g ( x ) , belonging to a pair of complementary classes of summable functions , such as those here considered , then Lt j/ " ( x ) gm ( x ) dx \#151 ; J/ g ( x ) dx .
