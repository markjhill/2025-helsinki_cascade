[ June 21 , That the temperatures observed cannot be absolutely the same ig evident ; for there must be a certain excess of pressure in the neijriJ bourhood of the surface of the solid in order to produce a flow of vapour from it to the surrounding space ; and consequently the evaporating substance must have a higher temperature corresponding to this higher pressure .
Our results , we venture to think , show that with solids , as with liquids , this difference , even when rapid evaporation is taking place , is an extremely minute one .

" Note on the Establishment and First Results of Simultaneous Thermometric and Hygrometric Observations at Heights of 4 and 170 feet , and of Siemens ' Electrical Thermometer at 260 feet above the ground .
" By G. J. Symons , F.R.S. Received June 6 , 1883 .
It is just a century since James Six ( the inventor of the well-known Six 's registering thermometer ) commenced some occasional comparisons of the temperature of the air at the top and bottom of the tower of Canterbury Cathedral .
We do not precisely know the position in which the instruments were placed , and , as thermometer screens had not then been invented , his observations can only be accepted as approximately correct ; but as the work in which they are recorded is rather scarce , it may be well to give an analysis of the results .
The observations were not consecutive , but made at various dates during 1784-92 ; the lower thermometer was 5 feet , and the upper one 220 feet above the ground .
The daily maxima were about 1 ' warmer at the top during all frosty period ; alike at the top and the bottom when the temperature was between 40 ' and 50 ' , and lower at the top by from 3 ' to 5 ' when the temperature was about 50 ' .
The minima gave analogous but more marked differences .
Some very severe frosts occurred while these experiments were in progress , and with bottom temperatures of \#151 ; 2'-5 , +6 ' , and +6 ' *5 respectively , the top temperatures were 15 ' , 17 ' , and 21 ' , .
showing an excess at the top of 170,6 , 11 ' , and 14''5 .
In ordinary weather the excess of the top minima was not so great , but the average excess was 6 ' , and there was not a single night when it was colder at the top than at the bottom .
The author is not aware of any further experiments having been made upon this subject in this couutry until 1861 , when the Rev. R. Main , F.R.S. , Radcliffe Observer , had a record commenced of a Six 's registering thermometer , and dry and wet bulb thermometers placed near the anemometer on the Radcliffe Observatory , Oxford .
These instruments were 106 feet above the ground , and were read ] Thermometric and Hygrome Observations . !
font 9 A.M. in conjunction with other thermometers at 5 feet above ^0 ground .
The readings of these instruments have since that time aeen published in extenso , but the author has seen no discussion of em an\lt ; 3 is not aware whether the thermometers have been verified jj .
not , nor how they are mounted .
In 1868 Mr. James Glaisher , F.R.S. , instituted a series of readings i)f the dry and wet bulb thermometers at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , at the respective heights of 4 feet , 22 feet , and 50 feet tbove the ground .
The observations which are published in extenso L the " Proceedings of the Meteorological Society , " vol. v , p. 29 , extend only from June 25 to August 6\#151 ; a period of six weeks during the hottest part of the year .
The results show that during the day hours the temperature at 4 feet was at times 7 ' and 8 ' higher , and at night 3 ' , 4 ' , and 5 ' lower than at 50 feet above the ground .
The subject was mentioned at the Meteorological Conference at Leipzig in 1872 , and both Messrs. Wild and Scott undertook to have experiments made , with the following results :\#151 ; In 1872-74 Professor H. Wild carried out experiments with thermometers and hygrometers placed at the heights of 6 feet , 52 feet , and 86 feet above the ground on a scaffolding at the Pulkowa Observatory .
( " Repertorium fur Meteorologie , " vol. v. ) During 1873-75 readings of maximum and minimum , and dry and wet bulb thermometers were made on behalf of the Meteorological Office at the Kew Observatory , 10 feet , and on the ornamental Pagoda in the Royal Gardens , Kew , at the respective heights of 22 feet , 69 feet , and 129 feet above the ground .
Mr. R. H. Scott , F.R.S. , in concluding his report on these observations ( " Quarterly Weather Report , " 1876 , Appendix 3 ) , says : " That so far as the evidence adduced in this paper goes , it indicates that , on the average of a considerable series of observations , the influence of height on mean thermometricai and hygrometrical results is not very great , but that on individual occasions very material differences are observed .
Lastly , Mr. G. Dines has recently communicated to the Meteorological Society ( " Quarterly Journal , " vol. viii , p. 189 ) , the results of observations which he has made with thermometers placed 4 feet and 50 feet above the ground at his residence at Hersham , Walton-on-JThames .
These observations , which extended from September , 1876 , to September , 1878 , inclusive , show that on the average the mean 'daily range of temperature at 50 feet was 2''l less than at 4 feet , the mean of the maxima at 50 feet being 10,2 lower , and the mean of the minima 0'*9 higher than at 4 feet .
It will be seen from the above abstract that , up to the end of 1881 , there was no precise information as to the form of the curve of daily temperature at considerable heights above the ground .
It was known that the amplitude of the daily range was materially reduced , but the 312 Mr. G. J. Symons .
[ June 21 amount of the reduction was unknown , and , owing to the absence of hourly readings at night , no data existed for determining the shape of the curve during the night and early morning hours .
The Council of the Meteorological Society have therefore thought it expedient to endeavour to obtain accurate and complete information upon the subject .
The author had been for some years in communication with Mr. E. C. Hackford , verger of the parish church of Boston , Lincolnshire , the tower of which rises , quite free from any obstructions , in a very flat country , to the considerable height of 273 feet .
The site was extremely suitable , and Mr. Hackford was a practised observer ; he having consented to make the observations arrangements were made for obtaining instruments .
The first essential was a thermometer which could be read without climbing to the top of the tower .
This requirement having been brought to the knowledge of Sir W. Siemens , E.R.S. , he very kindly placed at the disposal of the Council one of his electrical thermometers .
The principle of these instruments was fully explained by Sir W. Siemens in the Bakerian Lecture , 1871 , and published in a paper " On the Dependence of Electrical Resistance to Temperature , " printed in vol. iii of the " Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers .
" It is therefore merely necessary to state that the thermometer consists of a spiral of insulated wire coiled round a core of wood , the whole being protected by a brass sheath .
The resistance of the wire increasing with increase of temperature it is only necessary to measure the resistance in order to learn the temperature .
The current is provided by a six-cell Leclanche battery , and a light cable carries the insulated wires up to the thermometer , and connects it with a galvanometer with a roller contact .
The position of the contact maker when the galvanometer is at zero depends upon the resistance in the thermometer , and therefore the position of the contact maker , as shown on a graduated scale , gives the temperature .
On receipt of the thermometer from Messrs. Siemens Brothers ' works , it was at once forwarded to Kew Observatory for verification , and the report was that it worked very satisfactorily , but was somewhat sluggish .
The consent of the vicar ( Canon Blenkin ) to the use of the tower of the church having been obtained , the Assistant Secretary of the Meteorological Society ( Mr. " W. Marriott ) was intrusted with all the arrangements .
He went to Boston at the end of February , 1882 , and erected the following instruments .
( 1 .
) In the churchyard , where there is a good exposure , a Stevenson screen containing dry bulb , wet bulb , maximum and minimum thermometers , all at 4 feet above the ground .
( 2 .
) On the roof of the belfry , in its south-east corner , 4 feet above the roof , and 170 feet above the ground , a precisely similar Stevenson 1883 .
] Thermometric and Hygrometric Observations .
screen with similar thermometers to those at 4 feet .
From this point upwards the tower is quite open , besides which there is free circulation of the air through the large open windows on the four sides of the tower .
( 3 .
) In a box with three of its sides louvre boarded , and of which the height , breadth , and depth are respectively 1 foot 5 inches , gl inches , and 5| inches , the Siemens electrical thermometer and also a standard thermometer for occasional check readings .
The box or " wall screen " faces west-south-west , is attached to one of the northern pinnacles of the tower , and is 260 feet above the ground .
When first put up a board was fastened on the south side of the screen to protect it from the sun 's rays ; as this , however , hardly afforded sufficient protection , an outer screen was placed , over the wall screen in September .
The cable has been brought down the inside of the tower , then through the belfry , and so to the base of the tower inside the church , where the galvanometer is fixed .
The accompanying figure shows the relative situations of the three sets of thermometers .

B = Stevenson 's Screen on Belfry .
C = Stevenson 's Screen in Churchyard .
All the thermometers are read every morning at 9 o'clock ; and simultaneous readings of the electrical thermometer at the summit of the tower and of the dry bulb thermometer in the churchyard , together with the direction and force of the wind , the amount of cloud , weather , \amp ; c. , are also made regularly at 11 a.m. , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 p.m. 314 Mr. ( x. J. Symons .
[ June 21 All the observations have been made by Mr. Hackford in the most careful and satisfactory manner .
Systematic observations commenced with April , 1882 , and the whole of the records have been examined by Mr. Marriott .
As the series is still in operation , and some classes of weather have not yet occurred , it is impossible to give at present final results .
The leading features of the first nine months ' work are , however , of con-siderable interest , and may be thus epitomized:\#151 ; Table I gives the monthly means of the readings of the maximum minimum , and dry bulb thermometers in the churchyard , and on the roof of the belfry , at 9 A.M. , from April to December , 1882 .
From this it will be seen that the mean maximum temperature at 4 feet exceeds that at 170 feet by 1'*9 , while the mean minimum temperature at 4 feet falls below that at 170 feet in almost every month , the mean difference being 0'*4 .
The range of temperature isr therefore , 2'*3 less on the belfry than it is at 4 feet above the ground .
The temperatures at 9 a.m. show that on the average the air at 4 feet is 1'*3 warmer than at 170 feet .

From this it will readily be seen that during the period in question the mean temperature in the churchyard during these day hours is Table II .

[ June 21 considerably warmer than at the top of the tower .
The greatest difference is from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. , after which it begins to get less and less .
On examining the individual readings for each day , two interesting features are clearly brought out , viz. , '(I ) that in fine bright weather the temperature at 4 feet during the day is much higher than on the top of the tower , \#151 ; in summer the difference sometimes reaches 5 ' at 1 p.m. ; and ( 2 ) that in foggy weather the temperature at the top of the tower is always higher than at 4 feet , the upper part of the tower being generally free from fog .
In cloudy and wet weather the temperature is uniformly higher in the churchyard than at the top of the tower .
These observations , however , like nearly all those previously made , refer mostly to the day time ; it was felt of pre-eminent importance that headings should be taken occasionally throughout the night as well as the day .
Hitherto the usual difficulties in obtaining observations requiring night attendance have prevented any considerable number of such records being obtained , but every effort will be made to increase their number , especially when extreme atmospheric conditions prevail .
During last winter there were eight occasions upon which one of the church officials was .
on duty all night , and for those periods we have complete records .
The following are brief descriptions of the weather on each occasion November 11\#151 ; 12 .

The temperatures are given in Table III .
The prevalence of fine clear nights is readily seen by the increased temperature at the upper station ; the pre^pnce of fog is also indicated in a similar manner ; while cloudy skies , rain , and wind prevent radiation , and so on the days and nights of their occurrence the temperature is always highest near the ground .
From the foregoing it seems that the difference between the temperature at 4 feet and 260 feet is chiefly regulated by the amount of cloud , and by the relation of the temperature of the surface of the ground to that of the general body of air passing over it .
If so , it will follow that the mean difference between the temperature at the two heights can only be determined by very numerous observations , 1883 .

As regards hygrometry the data at present obtained relate solely to 9 A.M. and to the heights of 4 and 170 feet respectively .

It is well known that drills and other tools of the same class which are guided by their cutting edges tend to , or at any rate can produce holes which are not circular in section , and further , that if the tool have n equidistant edges , the hole which it produces , if not circular in section , will have w + 1 sides or similar arcs , * but the exact shape .of these holes and the limits to their possible departure from circularity have not as far as I am aware been hitherto examined .
The problem consists in finding all the figures which will circum* These sides are in general very much curved , and in fact are not distinguishable without measurement when n is greater than 3 ; but when 2 the departure from the circular form is often very wide .
A good instance of this may be seen in the holes bored in rock for blasting .
These holes are made by an iron bar with a chiselshaped end , and the section of the holes is a triangle with the corners rounded off .
