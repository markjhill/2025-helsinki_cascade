Although the labour of many physiologists has been directed towards the consideration of Latency , it seemed to us desirable that the subject should receive a little addition in some of its details , and it was with the object of thus filling up deficiencies , and at the same time of studying systematically the effect of some of the agents which modify the time of latency , that we undertook the investigations , the results of which we desire to lay before the Society .
In 1867 Helmholtz and Baxt* published the results of experiments they had instituted touching the speed of conduction in motor nerves as measured by the relative latencies obtained in a nearer and more distant stimulation of a nerve-trunk ( frog ) or of the skin above it , and in publishing their experiments of 1870 they drew attention to the modifying influence of temperature upon such conduction .
Thiis * " Monatsbericht d. Berliner Acad. , " 1867 , s. 228 , and 1870 , s. 184 .
On the Latent Leriodof Muscle Contraction .
they saw the speed decreased to a great , extent when the nerve was laid upon ice , and even slight variations in the room temperature sufficed to produce material changes .
Troitzky* came to the conclusion that conduction is the most rapid in the frog s nerve between 10 and 20 ' 0 .
, and diminishes both by higher and lower temperatures .
The influence of temperature could , however , he , concluded be sulwr .
dinated to a certain extent by increasmg the strength of the ^ThtTpowerful shock is more potent to induce rapid conduction than a weaker one has been upheld by Valentinf and von Wrttrch as well as by Troitzky , but has been denied by Bosentha , l+ and Lautenbach .
S These interesting results would have been stil^ more valuable had accurate corrections been made or e vanai the rapidity of the initial changes taking place m the muscle itself during the latent period , for , as Hermann suggests , changes m the strength of the stimulus may cause these variatmns to be con"An'Instrument , designed by du Bois Reymond the " Frosch-Unterbrecher ''\#151 ; has made the fact apparent that the period of a en energy elapsing between stimulation and obvious contraction also increases if increasing weights , acting as " after-weights e aic in the supported pan suspended from the muscle .
Thus , whilst at lev r-tension\#151 ; at which point the support was fixed\#151 ; the latency may be less than second , under a weight of 200 grms. it may be more than twice as much .
It is evident that whether the muscle be free-weighted " or " after-weighted , " until it has reached a state o counterbalancing tension as regards the weight it is to raise , no elevation from the abscissa can be effected .
The free-weighted muscle is already stretched as regards the greater number of its fibres by a small weight ( 30-40 grms. for gastrocnemius of frog ) , whilst the after-weighted has to attain a similar state of tension before it can commence its true lift .
Variations in latency are then to be expected according to the connexion in which we place the weight an ie muscle .
Place|| and Klunderf remark that if , after a muscle ias been powerfully extended , and while it is returning , by reason ot its elasticity , towards its normal condition , a stimulation be applied , the latency may become as short as the ^\#151 ; too secon(fi ^ reSU which Haidenhain** inclines to attribute to the pernicious effects ot the previous tension .

The instrument which served us for registration of the contraction was a modification of Fick 's pendulum myograph , manufactured by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company .
It was provided with an extensive arc , having movable catch adjustments , so that the velocity of the recording surface could be readily modified .
The primary current was broken by the arm of the swinging pendulum , and if occasion required a second contact , the relation of which to its neighbour could be regulated by a micrometer screw , could be employed in conjunction .
The recording plate could be elevated so as to register a series of some 30\#151 ; 40 -curves , one over the other .
The moist chamber , containing the muscle , \amp ; c. , was placed on a table which could be withdrawn or advanced to meet the plate ( acting like the slide-rest of a lathe ) without altering the relationship of the writing point to the recording surface .
Within the moist chamber , and surrounding the muscle , passed several coils of metal tubing , which could be heated or cooled at pleasure by passing heated or iced water through it from a system of tubes terminating above in double funnels .
The temperature was accurately measured by a Centigrade thermometer placed in the moist chamber , its bulb being equidistant from the muscle and the tubing .
The lever , designed by one of us , was made of two straws separated to the extent of 1^ inch at their union with the axis , and converging at the other end to a pointed strip of platinum foil , which acted as a pen .
The weight of this lever , without the friction of the pen , was about 1 grm. The weight was suspended round the axis of rotation , except in those cases in which it appeared desirable to apply it in the line of traction of the muscle .
Great steadiness , absence of appreciable friction , and elimination of the effect of the " throw up " sustained by a lever weighted anywhere except at its axis , were ensured by this adjustment , and the great lightness of the lever arm .
In view of the fact that the nerve is more rapidly influenced by those agents which we proposed to employ in modifying the manifestations of latency , and also because we desired to look chiefly to the actual effect such agents produced on the changes necessary to the subsequent contraction , rather than to the varying conductivities of the nerve , we chose the curarised muscles ( the gastrocnemius of the frog ) for the bulk of our experiments .
We may mention in this place that we found the variations between the non-curarised and curarised muscles , both stimulated directly and at room temperature ( 17\#151 ; 18 ' C. ) , so slight that they may be disregarded .
Maximal stimulation was- employed in all cases , except where otherwise specified .
Our experiments were performed on temp. , between the 10th January and the middle of April .
Though we have thought well to give frequently the measurement of a series of curves taken from a single muscle , we have done this On the Latent Period of Muscle Contraction .
465 order to show a sample selected from a large number of curves , ancT presenting in a fair degree the peculiarities which custom has taim-ht us to expect from the circumstances of the case .
The first experiments were directed to contrasting the latencies ot contractions obtained by stimulating nerve or muscle The length of nerve attached to the preparation which yielded the following measurements was 12 5 millims. The weighting of the muscle was free , and the weights which were suspended sufficiently ]ong before stimulation to cause a proportionate extension increased from lever weight , i.e. , 1 grm. , up to 100 grins .

If we glance at the other two columns in Table I , we see that this middle part contains the shortest curves exhibiting altitudes midway between those of the extremes .
The fact established by Marey , * that a muscle hindered by the weight applied to it from reaching its maximum of contraction is slower in its relaxation than its less weighted neighbour , accounts for the long low curve under 100 grms. As regards the comparison between the muscle stimulated directly and indirectly , we may state from our results , that which previous consideration had convinced us must be the case , viz.:\#151 ; At ordinary room temperature , the increase of latency bears the same proportion to the increase of free burden in direct as in indirect stimulation .
2 .
It has been alleged that curare increases the latency , and as we desired to use the curarised muscle in certain of our experiments , we made comparative observations with the result of convincing ourselves that as a rule no such prolongation occurs ; but that the course of latency of the curarised and of the non-curarised muscle , stimu# " Du Mouvement dans les Fonctions de la Tie , " 1868 , p. 363 .

lated directly , and under varying burdens but constant room temperature , is strictly parallel .
Upon the influence which curare may exercise upon the curve of contraction , we cannot enter here .

Our result then is that at room temperature , the latency of the curarised and non-curarised muscles directly stimulated is equal fox equal weights .
3 .
What is the relationship as to latency of the free-weighted muscle tensed in proportion to the weight it carries , to the after-weighted muscle , which has only the same slight initial tension under similai weights ?
As this question seemed to us to be an interesting one , we made a few observations , so as to obtain a fair contrast between two muscles placed under these widely differing circumstances .
The after-weighted muscle was supported , so that the weight of 10 grms. just rested upon the catch , from which the contracting muscle raised it .
We give a double column of the resulting differences of the free-weighted and the after-weighted muscles .
The influence of the support seems to increase the earlier latencies , and it is in great measure owing to this effect that the variation is so much greater in the case of the after-weighted than of the fi-ee-weighted muscle .

0T0 99 ... 0T0 99 1-00 T20 The weight of the lever alone ( about 1 grm. ) leaves many of the fibres of the gastrocnemius not tensed , and this condition is closely parallel to a mechanical support of a heavier weight .
If the weight can be lifted without the co-operation of these fibres , the latency is short , but should the addition of only 10 grms. require the tension of many of them , the latency becomes markedly increased .
Thus it is that the greatest differences lie towards the commencement of the scale of weight increment of a free-weighted muscle , and thus that the after-weighted muscle shows such greatly prolonged latencies at the same period .
We conclude therefore\#151 ; That the latency of a muscle with supported weight is greater than with unsupported weight , and that the greatest variation between the two occurs under the lighter weights .
4 .
We have referred at the commencement of this paper to the influence of weight upon latency , and we have shown subsequently that the addition of 100 grms. causes a marked prolongation of this period .
As we desired as far as possible to avoid fatiguing the muscle , we did not carry our weights , as a rule , beyond 100 grms. , though a few observations on fresh muscle weighted with 200 grms. were made in order to see in what manner the further weight acted .
If we examine the prolongation of the latency caused by increasing the weight gradually from lever weight to 100 grms. we find that there is an average increase of about .0063 " .
In glancing over a number of observations and preparing their averages , we found that the greatest influence exercised by any one weight-difference ( of a series of equal increments ) , was that resulting from the suspension of the first 10 grms. from the lever ; this might cause an On the Latent Period of Contraction .
469 average increase of *1625 D.V. The application of the three succeeding 10 grm. weights would have a conjoined effect of '3384 D.V. The middle weights 40\#151 ; 70 grms. , as has been already noticed , have less influence in prolonging the latency , their value would be about .284 D.V , , whilst the last series of these has again a much larger effect , equal together to '354 D.V. ; thus the extremes show greater variations amongst themselves than do the constituents of the intermediate series .

40__70=all bundles active and unwearied .
70\#151 ; 100=strain of some of bundles , commencing weariness .
During the suspension of the second 100 grms. the variation in latency only amounts to about one-half of that which obtains during the first 100 grms. , Latency is then prolonged by increasing the weight , but it does not increase in a definite ratio to the increase of such weight .
5 .
Our attention was next turned to the effect of fatigue upon the muscle in modifying the latency occurring after stimulation .
To induce fatigue we delivered to the muscle a certain number of opening induction shocks\#151 ; -maximal intensity\#151 ; in a given time , or we admitted an interrupted current completely tetanizing the muscle for a specified period .
After the muscle had remained at rest for a short interval a curve was taken , and the comparison of the latency of this curve with that taken before the tetanus or induction shocks had been administered was supposed to represent the effect of the stimulation which had intervened .
A weight of 10 grms. only was applied to the lever during these experiments , so that injury from undue tension of the Drs. G. F. Yeo and T. Cash .
muscle fibres might be avoided .
The temperature of the room was from 17 ' to 18'-5 C. In the case of fatiguing by simple induction shocks , 100 stimulations were delivered ( one every 2 " ) from Ludwig 's clock between the registration of every two stimulations .
The results showed that whether in the case of the curarised muscle or of the healthy muscle stimulated indirectly , the first 5\#151 ; 700 shocks produced but very slight changes , not amounting frequently in all to an increase of over Yo of a double vibration , or \#166 ; 00055 " .
A curious result occurring occasionally after a few hundred stimulations only had been administered was that the latency became actually diminished to a slight extent , namely .00027 " to *00044 ' ' , as if the moderate amount of exertion through which the muscle had passed favoured the more rapid consummation of the changes in the muscle preliminary to contraction .
This diminution was followed by a return through the original to a more rapidly increasing latency .
The prolongation after 900\#151 ; 1,000 contractions is distinct .00132 " to '00222 " , whilst after 1,300\#151 ; 1,500 a rapid prolongation associated with loss of excitability ( as shown by the long shallow curve with greatly retarded relaxation ) is seen .
The following figures illustrate the course of such a case .

We find that the change occurring in the latency is not altogether dissimilar to that of the muscle stimulated by simple induction shocks , that is to say , that the increase during the first 6\#151 ; 8 , 10 " stimulations is not very great ; but that after this point the latency tends to increase rapidly till at the 13th , 15th , 10-second tetanus a much proOn the Latent Period of Muscle Contraction .
471 longed latency with an associated low , long curve , showing great viscosity or slowness of extension , is to be observed .
It differs in this respect , however , that the lengthening of the latency is already well marked after the muscle has been subjected once or twice to the 10 " tetanus It is not unusual after a lengthening of the latency has occurred for it again to diminish , if not to a point below the original , at any rate to one distinctly below some of its predecessors .
This peculiarity does not persist to the point at which the viscosity of the muscle becomes increased and the curve much prolonged , but coexists with a strong contraction followed by complete relaxation , and this point , be it coincidence or not , is worthy of note .
The following figures show the frequent course of such an experiment:\#151 ; Length of Latency in D.V. \#151 ; tsT ?

Fatigue is more rapidly induced by indirect than by direct stimulation .
Fatigue then increases the latency , at first slowly ( 500 induction shocks or 60 " tetanus ) , and then more rapidly till the exhaustion of the muscle ( 1,500 single contractions or 130 " tetanus ) when a much prolonged latency occurs .
Near the commencement of stimulation a temporary diminution of the latency is occasionally to be recognised .
6 .
We have mentioned , at the commencement of this paper , that Helmholtz , Wundt , and others regarded the strength of the shock as playing an important role in modifying the length of latency , and we also pointed out that this view had been opposed by Rosenthal and Lautenbach .
As the question appeared of importance , we directed our attention to it , in the hope that we might be able to contribute something to its elucidation .
* The muscle was apparently contracting slightly when stimulation was delivered .
Drs. G. F. Yeo and T. Cash .
Our method of procedure was to remove the secondary coil of du Bois Reymond 's induction apparatus to a considerable distance from the primary and gradually to approximate it , testing both directions of the current in each instance till distinct contraction producing a legible curve was obtained .
Electrodes were applied to both nerve and mnscle , so that the position of the secondary coil at which direct or indirect stimulation caused contraction might be noted .
A much more closely approximated position of the secondary coil to the primary is necessary for direct stimulation to be effective than for indirect .
One Daniell was employed in the earlier experiments and in the later two Grove 's elements were introduced into the primary circuit .
A contraction first occurred when the secondary coil ( opening shock indirect ) stood at 28 centims. No other mode of stimulation was effective till an approximation of 9 centims. was reached , when an indirect closing shock became operative .
At 6 centims. direct opening shocks produced contraction , but the most powerful direct closing shocks , of which the apparatus and the single element were capable , wrere ineffective .
The contraction here , though maximal for indirect was submaximal for direct stimulation .
The shock was at no point exhausting to the muscle for the altitude and length of the contraction , except in the case of the first , which is distinctly submaximal , remain remarkably constant throughout the experiment .
The total result of the experiment may be expressed in four figures .

" 2-85 " or , in other words , the diminution of latency under this increase of stimulation was only '15 , or the '0008 " , an effect so slight that it may pass almost without notice in ordinary experiments , but is nevertheless of sufficient value in showing that an increase of intensity of stimulation , only carried so far as to produce a continuance of healthy reaction , still modifies the latency to a certain extent .
The temperature of the room , 17''5 C. remained constant during this observation .
In another experiment , two Grove 's cells ( small ) were substituted for the Daniell , and thus a much greater potential was available for stimulating purposes .
The muscle was uncurarised and the stimulation direct .

We have bear abundant proof , that without exerting a strength of stimulation sufficient to destroy contractility , we can reduce the latency through or the -0094 " .
From the time the secondary coil came within 4 centims. of the primary whilst it was pushed " home , " and until it was removed again to 8 centims. from the primary , no curve produced reached the abscissa during the passage of the registering plate : there was an alarming viscosity manifested , and we feared injury to the muscle , but on distancing the induction coil a pretty fair recovery was made , the latencies rapidly lengthening , till at the position in which a value of 375 was first obtained , 3'8 was now recorded , the curve meanwhile , though somewhat ( o . .
) lengthened , approximated to its primal form .
This experiment was repeated again with curarised muscles , and the result obtained coincided with our former experience m the abridgement which the latency undergoes under increase of stimulation .

Our first latency in this chart commences with the secondary coil , 13*5 centims. from the primary , and has a value of 3'4-5 D.Y. , and this we find at 6 and 7 centims. curtailed to 2'2 , the smallest figure recorded .
At this point ( 6 centims. ) the curves which have hitherto been of fairly equal lengths , though of increasing altitude , show a considerable elevation after the active phase of contraction is over , the lever pen failing to reach the abscissa for some time after the plate has passed .
The stimulation is still increased and the muscle remains longer contracted , whilst the curve falls in altitude ; a stage of irritability which lasts till the secondary roll has passed 1*5 centims. , and which is attended with short though varying latencies , passes , and after a sudden and extensive prolongation of the period , the last shock delivered with the coil " home " kills the muscle completely , the last latency being 3'65 D.V. We have here , then , a case in which the violence of the shock at last employed , kills the muscle and death is preluded by a distinct lengthening of latency , so that we cannot ascribe the changes of the earlier part of this series to morbid processes , any more than the shortening of those of the table last considered , though the strength of the shock when the coils were nearly approximated was no doubt very great .
We conclude , then , that the length of the latency is largely influenced by the strength of stimulaOn the Latent Period of Muscle Contraction .
475 tion , and an abridgement of the former of more than the of a second is readily produced by strong stimulation , without inflicting permanent injury upon the muscle .
With stimulation of a much mflder character , more closely related to physiological stimulation , a very slight shortening of the latency may be observed .

When Helmholtz was investigating the speed of motor nerve conductivity , he found that in the case of man this underwent a remarkable change in the summer time , so that its velocity became 60'50 metres per second , or .
fully twice as much as it had been some time previously .
This acceleration he attributed to the elevation in atmospheric temperature occurring at that season , and this conclusion led him to a theory for the different speeds of conductivity in the upper arm when the nerve is sheltered and the lower when it is more superficial .
Troitzky , who investigated conduction in the nerve of the frog , stated that the speed was greatest between 10 ' and 20 ' , and diminished both under lower and higher temperatures .
It will be recollected that our moist chamber was furnished with a coil of tubing , which acted as means of producing heat or cold according to the temperature of the fluid passed through it ; by means of this coil we were able to produce as extensive variations of heat or cold as our subject demanded .
Water cooled by a mixtui'e of chipped ice and salt in the one funnel , and water heated somewhat above the temperature we desired to produce in the other , enabled us by their conjoined use to hit the point we needed with precision .
The attention of one of us was fixed upon the thermometer , and at a sign from him that the mercury stood at the desired level , the pendulum was liberated and the curve registered .
Some experiments were made to ascertain the effect upon exposed nerve of the temperature of the chamber , and with the results of these we will begin this section of our subject .
Our Table ( YI ) shows the effect of a depression of the temperature through 12 ' C. ( from 17 ' to 5 ' ) and of its subsequent elevation through 8 ' ( 17 ' to 25 ' ) or of a total excursion through 20 ' .
The variation of latency accompanying this change is from *026 " ( -5 ' ) to .0127 " ( 25 ' ) , or no less than -0133 " or the TV part of a second .
Having taken a curve at the room temperature ( 17 ' C. ) , we rapidly cooled down the muscle to 5 ' , and then permitting it gradually to regain its normal a curve was taken at each degree ; when 17 ' was reached we began to heat slowly till we had raised the temperature to 25 ' .

The average effect for degree of cold is \#166 ; 00069 " , that of heat '00048 " , and could we take an average of the whole 12 ' through which cooling was carried , the figure would rise to '00077 " , because the addition of eveiy On the Latent Period of Muscle Contraction .
477 degree of cold after 9 ' and 10 ' are reached , produces a more considerable elongation of latency .
If we carry the heating much above this point , we find that there is a sudden accession of excitability of the nerve as manifested by a much elevated and prolonged curve differing also in contour from its predecessors .
This condition increases to a certain point , then diminishes , and the entire death of the nerve ensues .
The first indication of danger occurs at about 27 ' , and death at 30 ' \#151 ; 31 ' .
This muscle , however , may still be quite capable of responding to direct stimulation if the temperature be not further increased , and revives eventually .

Heating from 17 ' , at which the latency is 3*10 to 27 ' , reduces the latency to 2 D.V. , and after this point there is again a slight increase till the death of the nerve at 31 ' occurs .
That there is , however , a marked diminution of the latency from 20 to 27 , is plainly to be seen , as the variation is through '003 " , and this result scarcely coincides with the assumption that conductivity is impaired after 20 ' m the case of the frog .

The curve also is the expression of the actual effect of a certain temperature upon the muscle only instead of being that on both nerve and muscle .
A rise or fall of temperature through a certain number of degrees has a magnified effect on the nerve-muscle preparation compared to what it has on the muscle .

We have before us the result of cooling a curarised muscle down from 19 ' to 7 ' , and then of heating it to 20 ' , and the figures represent fairly the changes in the curve and latency .
The total addition to the latency is *8 of a double vibration , or -0044 " whilst the addition in the length of the curve is 24 D.V. The interesting fact is well demonstrated in this Table that the greater the influence of cooling through a given number of degrees has been upon the latency , the greater is the effect also on the curve , so that whereas between 19 and 1 , t e latency varies the T5D.V .
, and the length of the curve increases only 2 D.V. 's between 9 ' and 7 ' where the latency increases '2 D.V. , the curve lengthens 13 D.V. , but it is necessary to remember that it is exactly at this point 9 \#151 ; 5 ' , that cold has such a power u e ec in prolonging the curve .

The extreme prolongation of the curve at 11 ' and 12 ' is an illustration ot that which we think we have seen many times , though we have not found opportunity to work out the point , viz. , that if after heating a muscle , the temperature be reduced below the normal , the effect of that reduction is greater in prolonging the latency and the curve than it would have been if starting from the normal only .
The converse\#151 ; for heating after cooling\#151 ; appears also to hold good .
If a muscle be heated or cooled to a certain temperature and be maintained at that temperature for a considerable time , does the preparation acclimatize itself , and do latency and curve show a tendency to return towards the normal ?
Our answer is that they do not .
A muscle kept at 20 ' for 25 ' gave a constant latency of 275 D.Y. , whilst the curve varied in value only through '2 D.Y. ; at 2o ' for 15 the latency remained at 1-65 , the length of contraction varying only through 3 D.Y. , the same result obtained on cooling .
We conclude then that cold lengthens and heat shortens the latency , Mr. E. H. Glaisher .
the effect per degree of the former being greater than the latter .
The shortest latency for the heated frog muscle occurs at 29 \#151 ; 305 ' , and closely precedes rigor .
Muscles maintained for a considerable time at a given elevation or depression of temperature , preserve a constant latency .
Up to the present the gastrocnemius of the frog has been the only muscle upon which we have experimented , and our chief object in making this communication is to call attention to the changes in the duration of the latency brought about by varying conditions of stimulation .
We hope to continue our observation by making similar experiments on different muscles of various animals , and in a future paper to enter more fully upon the changes occurring in the other phases of the contraction , for which purpose further use will be made of the tables we have the honour of laying before the Royal Society .
