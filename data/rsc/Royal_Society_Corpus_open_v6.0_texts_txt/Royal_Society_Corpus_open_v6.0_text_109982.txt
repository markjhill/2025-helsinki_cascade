After adverting to the importance of an easy means of effecting the above purpose in analytical inquiries , and to the insufficiency of the usual methods hitherto described , the author proposes the following process .
The solution containing the iron is to be peroxidized by nitric acid , then neutralized while boiling by carbonate of ammonium ; the iron falls , while the other metals , which Mr. Herschel supposes to be manganese , cerium , nickel , and cobalt , remain in solution .
A few precautions are necessary to insure success in this operation ; such as , that the solution must contain no oxide of manganese or cerium , except in their states of protoxide ; and that during the precipitation the solution should be duly diluted and agitated ; and the latter portions of the alkaline solution , carefully added so as to avoid its excess , though slightly surpassing the point of saturation , give rise to no error or inconvenience .
Mr. Herschel concludes this paper with some observations respecting those peculiarities of the peroxide upon which its separation in the above cases depends , and gives some instances of its application to practical analysis .
