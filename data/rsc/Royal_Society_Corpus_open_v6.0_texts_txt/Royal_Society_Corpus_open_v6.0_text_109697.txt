Some Observations on the foregoing Paper of Dr. Henry .
By Humphry Davy , Esq. Mr. Davy , having lately had much occasion to pay particular attention to the electrization of ammonia during his researches on the decomposition of nitrogen , has observed various sources of error that may occur in the process , and may account for the difference between his results and those of Dr. Henry .
The first precaution that is to be taken , is to boil the mercury over which the decomposition is to be effected ; next to prepare the gas in a separate vessel , and thence transfer it to the boiled mercury for electrization ; for unless these precautions are taken , water contained in the mercury becomes the cause of that absorption of ammonia suspected by Dr. Henry , and by thus adding fresh ammonia during the .
process , occasions a fallacious result .
A second error may also be occasioned , when the mercury has not been boiled , by common air adhering to the sides of the tube .
In a late experiment , Mr. Davy obtained from 15 measures of ammonia 27 of permanent gases , consisting of 73 hydrogen and 27 nitrogen , agreeing so nearly with his original results of 74 to 26 , that he conceives either of them to be more near the truth than Dr. Henry 's estimate of 71I and 28 ' .
With respect to Dr. Henry 's attempt to prove the existence of oxygen in ammonia by the formation of water , Mr. Davy does not see much probability of success , as water existing in ammonia may elude any hygrometrical test .
And although in his own electrization of ammonia the platina wires were tarnished , at the same time that the ammoniacal gas seemed to lose weight during decomposition , he does not think the experiment conclusive , with regard to the exist .
ence of oxygen as an ingredient essential to the constitution of amnmonia .
