) The aocompanying chart is a graphic representation of the results of a survey of magnetic declination over a portion of the grounds of the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mauritius , which originated as follows :\#151 ; Absolute determinations of the magnetic elements have been made with instruments of the Kew pattern since the year 1875 , and in the year 1903 it was decided to utilise the 12-inch theodolite for more refined observations of declination .
For this purpose its vertical pillar was removed and a brass one substituted .
Suitable experiments showed that the small steel screws in various parts of the instrument had no sensible effect on the declination magnet when at a distance of 4 feet from the theodolite .
It was considered advisable to mount the new apparatus as near as possible to the old magnetic pavilion , but at a sufficient distance to avoid sensible interaction of the magnets during the observations of dip and horizontal force in the old pavilion .
It was further desirable that the spot selected should command a view of the astronomical mark on Pieter Both , a hill some six miles to the south .
The mark formerly used is only 150 yards to the south of the old pavilion .
A concrete pillar for the theodolite was accordingly erected 90 feet to the south ( magnetic ) of the old declinometer pillar , and a pavilion built over it 12 feet long by 7 feet wide and 10 feet high .
The magnet was mounted on a solid teak table 6 feet to the south of the theodolite , and it was found that at this spot the declination was 10 ' 35 ' ( west ) , or 1 ' 20 ' greater than on the old declinometer pillar 90 feet to northward .
Observations at intermediate points gave the results shown on p. 508 .
On November 4 observations were taken along a line running east-southeast from Station No. 4 , at intervals of from 10 to 30 feet , and on November 7 at intervals of 10 feet in a direction south-south-east from the same station .
When plotted on a chart , however , the results showed that observations at much closer intervals were necessary before accurate isogonic lines could be drawn ; the instrument was therefore made to slide along a plank , to the sides of which wooden runners were attached , serving as guides for a grooved support carrying the instrument .
Holes were drilled in the plank at VOL. lxxvi.\#151 ; a. 2 n 508 Mr. T. F. Claxton .

After observing over each hole in succession the position of the declinometer was again determined when centred over the last hole , and intermediate positions obtained by interpolation .
Care was taken to keep the magnet as nearly as possible at a constant distance ( about 4 feet ) from the ground throughout the survey ; but the observations tend to show that perfect success in this respect was not obtained , and two or three sets near one of the foci were rejected , as the plotted results indicated that the plank was either too high or too low .
Observations at one station gave 12 ' 40 ' ( west ) as the declination at 4 feet from the ground , and 14 ' O ' ( west ) at 2 feet above the ground .
Plotting the position of the plank on a chart , together with the results of the observations as soon as completed , showed where other observations were necessary , and in this manner the various foci were located without unduly multiplying the observations , the intervals being suited to the declination gradient .
At some places it was necessary to observe at the beginning and end of the plank only , while at the first focus discovered the declination was changing so rapidly that the plank was discarded and observations taken at rectangular intervals of 3 inches , on a table ruled and grooved for this purpose .
Thus the survey became extended until sufficient ( 893 ) observations were obtained to construct the accompanying chart .
The labour of observation and reduction was lightened by using a subsidiary theodolite , placed in view of the astronomical mark and at a 1905 .

509 sufficient distance from the declinometer .
The reading on the horizontal circle of the theodolite corresponding to the astronomical meridian was obtained by measuring the distance of the theodolite east or west of the transit instrument , and from observation of the mark , which bears due south from the transit instrument .
It was then only necessary to observe the bearing of the middle of the declinometer with the theodolite , and vice versa , to obtain the reading on the declinometer corresponding to the astronomical meridian .
Three well marked foci were detected , as follows :\#151 ; Focus .

About midway between the old and new piers the isogonic line of 9 ' 30 ' forms a triangle , of about 200 square feet area , towards the centre of which the declination decreases to 9 ' 20 ' .
From the north-west angle of the triangle the declination increases rapidly towards the west , on the south side increases towards the south , and on the east side decreases towards the north-east and increases towards the south-east .
Were this the only " plateau " shown on the map a value between 9 ' 20 ' and 9 ' 30 ' might be assumed as the true declination ; but between 30 and 50 feet to the east-north-east of the old pier the isogonic line of 10 ' forms an ellipse , of about 500 square feet area , over which the declination is nearly constant , except to the north-west of its centre where the declination increases to 10 ' 10 ' .
Another area of relatively shallow gradients is that immediately to the north-west of the old pier , particularly between the isogonic lines of 9 ' 30 ' and 9 ' 45 ' .
It appears , therefore , that the normal declination at the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mauritius , is about 9 ' 45 ' , or 30 ' greater than the value 2 n 2 510 Mr. T. F. Claxton .

In the year 1899 observations of magnetic declination were made at 23 stations in different parts of the island ; the two extreme values , 11 ' 29 ' ( west ) and 7 ' 30 ' ( west ) , were obtained at points separated by only 400 yards , while the mean of the 23 values was 9 ' 25 ' .
The horizontal force was observed at twelve , and the dip at six of these stations .
The mean results were for horizontal force 0-2310 ( C.G.S. unit ) and for dip 55 ' 4 ' ( south ) .
The horizontal force and dip were observed near the two principal foci detected at the observatory , with the following results:\#151 ; 1905 .

Stations E to I lie nearly at right angles to a line joining the positions of maximum and minimum ( declination ) of Focus No. 2 .
It will be seen that from D to G , a distance of 9-7 feet , the dip varies 8 ' 6 ' , the horizontal force 0-0407 ( C.G.S. unit ) , the vertical force 0'0353 ( C.G.S. unit ) , and the total force 0 0043 ( C.G.S. unit ) .
