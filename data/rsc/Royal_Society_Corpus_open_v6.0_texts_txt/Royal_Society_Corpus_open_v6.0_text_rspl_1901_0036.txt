it .
Thus the same alloy , without being melted , can by heating and chilling have all pattern removed , and by reheating , followed by a not very rapid cool , the pattern can be restored .
The constancy in the size of the polygons points to their having been formed at an earlier period in the history of the alloy .
We see from the alcove that the patterns of slowly cooled copper-tin alloys are , at all events until they have been confirmed by the examination of chilled portions , entirely misleading as to the separations that occurred during solidification .
Even the evidence for the existence of the compound Cu3Sn will have to be revised ; although in a somewhat altered form it will probably be found to be satisfactory .
We hope shortly to present to the Royal Society a more complete account of these alloys .
" On the Enhanced Lines in the Spectrum of the Chromosphere .
" By Sir Norman Lockyer , K.C.B. , E.R.S. , and F. E. Baxandall , A.R.C.S. Received March 19 , \#151 ; Read March 28 , 1901 .
In the recently published account* of the spectroscopic results obtained by members of the expedition from the Yerkes Observatory , during the solar eclipse of May 28th , 1900 , although the record of the wave-lengths of the lines photographed on the different eclipse plates is of great value , exception must be taken to the method of assigning origins to the lines .
This question is so important just now that it is desirable to deal with it without delay .
The only origins which Professor Frost appears to accept are those given by Rowland to any moderately strong solar line which agrees in position , either exactly or very nearly , with an eclipse line .
In discussing the eclipse lines he has made specific allusions to the " enhanced " lines of some of the metals , and to their relationship\#151 ; or non-relationship\#151 ; to the eclipse lines .
On p. 347 he says , " These plates give no evidence of any relationship between the bright lines and the 'enhanced ' lines , or lines distinctly more intense in the spark than in the arc spectrum , although Sir Norman Lockyer has attached much significance to a supposed connection between them .
Some of the enhanced lines are present and some are not , or at least were not conspicuous enough for measurement .
" In the paragraph immediately following , he says , " In case of titanium , for which Lockyer gives 48 enhanced lines within our limits , we may summarise the comparison as follows : 17 lines do * Frost , * Ast.-Phys .
Journ. , ' vol. 12 , p. 307 , 1900 .
On the Enhanced Lines in the Spectrum of the Chromosphere .
179 not appear as bright on the eclipse plates ; one pair is doubtful , the remainder occur as quite strong lines of the ordinary dark line spectrum , and hence would be expected to appear in the reversing layer , as they do .
" If a difference of 0'3 tenth metre be allowed between the wavelength of an eclipse line and that of the possibly corresponding metallic line ( and in some cases Professor Frost accepts a difference of 035 or more between his adopted wave-length and Rowland 's solar wavelength ) , the seventeen lines above mentioned dwindle down to ten .
That leaves , then , thirty-eight out of forty-eight of the enhanced lines , or about 80 per cent. , which agree in position within 0'3 tenth-metre with the eclipse lines .
Surely this shows as close a relationship between the enhanced lines of titanium and the eclipse lines , as that between the latter and the stronger of the Fraunhofer lines , for it is stated on p. 345 , " of 171 of Rowland 's lines , 61 per cent , were measured as bright on the plates .
" Nowhere has it been contended that the whole set of enhanced lines belonging to any one metal are represented in the spectrum of any one celestial body ; what has been stated is that the enhanced lines of some of the metals are , in general , of paramount importance in the spectra of some stars ( e.g. , a Cygni ) , specially prominent in others ( e.g. , y Cygni , the spectrum of which , with the exception of the absence of helium lines , very closely resembles that of the chromosphere ) , and are a marked feature of the spectrum of the chromosphere itself .
Professor Frost either has not noticed , or does not point out , that most of the enhanced lines of titanium , as compared with the ordinary lines of that element , are specially prominent , and are amongst the lines of greatest intensity in his list , as shown in the following table .
The first two columns of the table contain respectively the wavelengths and intensities of Rowland 's solar lines ( in the region covered by the eclipse lines ) , which have an intensity of 2 or more , and which have been ascribed to Ti only .
Double assignations , of which Ti forms one , have been omitted , as it is difficult , if not impossible , to determine what proportion of the intensity of the solar line is due to each element .
The third column indicates whether the titanium line at the given wave-length is an enhanced one or not .
The fourth gives the wavelengths , the fifth and sixth the intensities , and the eighth the origins which Professor Frost has adopted for the corresponding eclipse lines , and the seventh the intensities of the lines reduced from the Kensington eclipse photographs .
To make them roughly comparable with Professor Frost 's , these intensities have been multiplied by ten throughout , as 1 is adopted for the weakest lines in the Kensington photographs , whereas he adopts 10 for lines just visible .
if Intensity 2 or greater , ascribed by Rowland to Ti on ] Sir Norman Lockyer and Mr. F. E. Baxandall .

* Jg $ $ On the Enhanced Lines in the Spectrum of the Chromosphere .
183 In the above list of solar-titanium lines there are thirty-three which are not " enhanced " in the spark spectrum .
It will be seen that twenty-three of these\#151 ; or 70 per cent.\#151 ; have no corresponding line ( within 0*3 tenth-metre ) in Professor Frost 's record of eclipse lines .
Of the nine eclipse lines in the table which do agree approximately in position with unenhanced titanium lines , two are with certainty due to other metals , and in another case there is more evidence for an iron origin than one of titanium .
These are indicated in the column for remarks .
The remainder are nearly all lines of insignificant intensity .
Of the twenty " enhanced " lines of titanium which occur in the list , nineteen have corresponding lines in Professor Frost 's eclipse spectra , the remaining one being also possibly represented , but it falls so near the strong Hy line that it might be easily masked .
Not only are they represented in the eclipse spectra , but in nearly every case the corresponding eclipse line is a prominent one , as will be gathered at once from a glance at the tabular list given .
Professor Frost summarily dismisses the significance of the enhanced lines of titanium in the eclipse spectra , because " most of them occur as quite strong lines in the ordinary dark line spectrum , and hence would be expected to appear in the reversing layer , as they do .
" But if he would expect one line of a certain solar intensity , he should expect all lines due to the same element which are of an equal solar intensity , to appear in the eclipse spectra .
Yet another glance at the foregoing table will show that many of the titanium lines strongly represented in the eclipse spectra are of the lowest intensity in the Fraunhofer spectrum , and that if lines of a certain solar intensity be considered , those that are enhanced lines appear in the eclipse spectra , whereas the unenhanced ones do not .
In this comparison no account has been taken of the relative intensities of the lines in the titanium spectrum itself .
Hasselberg has published* a lengthy list of titanium arc lines , and in the region covered by the eclipse spectra records about 250 .
To compare all these with the eclipse lines would take too much time and space , nor is it necessary .
To show the difference in behaviour in the eclipse spectra of the enhanced and the strongest are lines , two separate lists of titanium lines have been made .
The first , which follows immediately , contains all the enhanced lines which occur in Hasselberg 's arc list , and the intensities of Professor Frost 's and the Kensington eclipse lines which correspond within O'3 tenth-metre are also given .

Reference to the above table will show that the " arc " intensities of the enhanced lines vary from 2 to 7 ( maximum intensity adopted is 8 ) , and that nearly throughout Frost records corresponding eclipse lines , the majority of the latter being quite prominent .
The second list consists of the very strongest arc lines ( intensity 7 and 8 ) which are not enhanced in the spark spectrum .
Here again the intensities of the corresponding eclipse lines , if any , are quoted .

In the case of iron , all the well-enhanced lines are represented in the eclipse spectra , hut they are not of quite the same prominence as the titanium enhanced lines .
They are , so far as their intrinsic intensities in the iron arc spectrum are concerned , quite insignificant lines as compared with the majority of other iron lines , hut their importance lies in the fact that they are a class of lines of special behaviour , being relatively stronger in the spark spectrum than in the arc .
In the eclipse spectra they are undoubtedly represented by stronger lines than are the great majority of unenhanced iron lines , however strong the latter may be in the iron arc spectrum itself .
Owing to the great number of iron lines in the solar spectrum , a comparison similar to that given for titanium over the whole region covered by the eclipse lines would necessitate the compilation of a very lengthy list .
But whatever evidence there is either one way or another should be revealed by a comparison over a limited region , so it is proposed to take that between X 4500 and A 4600 , since the proportion of enhanced to unenhanced iron lines is there greatest , and therefore a better opportunity is afforded of a fair comparison of the behaviour of the two classes of lines .
The table given on p. 18 f is arranged in exactly the same way as in the case of titanium , with the exception that there is an additional column showing the intensities in the arc spectrum , as recorded by Kayser and Rung .
It will be seen that the unenhanced lines are here also unrepresented in the eclipse spectra , with the possible exception of three , which are recorded as very weak lines in one of Professor Frost 's spectra , but are missing from the other .
All the enhanced lines , however , although they have the weakest arc intensities , appear in each of the eclipse spectra , and have abnormal intensities compared with those corresponding to the unenhanced lines .
It must be pointed out that onlj four of the nine enhanced iron lines in the part of the spectrum considered appear in the above list , because they are the only ones which are given in Rowland 's origins for solar lines .
At least four out of the remaining five\#151 ; those at AA 4515*51 , 4522*69 , 4556*10 , 4576*51 , probably correspond to the solar lines 4515*51 , 4522*69 ( or possibly 4522*80 ) , 4556*06 , and 4576*51 , to which Rowland has assigned no origin .
The outstanding line at A 4541*40 is doubtfully present iu the solar spectrum .
The first three of these five have corresponding lines in the eclipse record ; the other two have not .
In the Kensington reductions of eclipse spectra there are , however , lines agreeing ( within 0*3 tenth-metre ) with every one of the enhanced lines mentioned .
