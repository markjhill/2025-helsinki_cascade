" Experimental Researches into the Physiology of the Human Voice .
" By John Bishop , Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. The following are the conclusions deduced by the author from the inquiries which form the subject of the present paper .
1 .
The vibrations of the glottis are the fundamental cause of all the tones of the human voice .
2 .
The vibrating length of the glottis depends conjointly on the tension and resistance of the vocal ligaments , and on the pressure of the column of air in the trachea .
3 .
The grave tones vary directly , and the acute tones inversely , as the vibrating length and tension of the vocal ligaments .
4 .
The vocal tube is adjusted to vibrate with the glottis by the combined influence of its variations of length and of tension .
5 .
The elevation of the larynx shortens the vocal tube ; and its depression produces the contrary effect .
The diameter and exten ?
sion of the tube vary reciprocally with the length .
6 .
The falsetto tones are produced by a nodal division of the column of air , together with the vocal tube , into vibrating lengths .
7 .
The pitch of the vocal organs , when in a state of rest , is , in general , the octave of their fundamental note , The paper is illustrated by several drawings .
