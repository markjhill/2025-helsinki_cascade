] On the Currents in the Strait of Gibraltar .
January 18 , 1872 .
GEORGE BIDDELL AIRY , C.B. , President , in the Chair .
Pursuant to notice given at the last Meeting , Mr. Spottiswoode proposed and Admiral Richards seconded the Right Hon. George Joachim Goschen , First Lord of the Admiralty , for election and immediate ballot .
The ballot having been taken , Mr. Goschen was declared duly elected .
The following communication was read:\#151 ; { Investigations of the Currents in the Strait of Gibraltar , made in August 1871 , by Captain G. S. Nares , R.N. , of H.M.S. ' Shearwater/ under Instructions from Admiral Richards , F.R.S. , Hydrographer of the Admiralty .
" Communicated by Admiral Richards .
Received December 28 , 1871 .
In fulfilment of instructions to afford to Dr. Carpenter , F.R.S. , who was attached to the * Shearwater , ' every opportunity to investigate the Gibraltar current , and to " use every effort to set the question at rest , " Captain Nares spent sis days , from August 22nd to the 30th , in examining the currents and taking soundings and observations of temperature in the Strait of Gibraltar .
The details and results , embodied in a report , were delivered to the Admiralty , and , by favour of Admiral Richards , have furnished material for the following summary .
While the observations were being made , east winds , force 0 to 6 , were experienced : they were reported as having also prevailed during the previous fortnight .
The movement of water in the Strait was found to be tidal , affected by a surface-current running into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic .
The ebb-tide , which is a combination of the two streams running in the same direction , sets to the eastward , and at a rate considerably faster than the flood-tide , which is caused by the two streams meeting , and which runs to the westward .
In the Narrows , in the middle of the Strait , the surface-water is affected by tidal influence , but not to so great an extent as the water inshore ; for the east-running current from the Atlantic being here collected into an extremely narrow and strong-running stream , it is only during easterly winds and calms that a decided set to the westward is enabled to manifest itself j during westerly winds the tidal set to the westward is doubtless frequently overpowered by the extra strength of the in-running Atlantic current , and no set to the westward can be expected ; at the same time there must be a considerable diminution of the east-running current during the flood-tide .
In the Narrows the actual distance run by the surface-water towards the 98 Capt.'G .
S. Nares cn the [ Jan. 18 , Atlantic during one flood-tide under the most favourable circumstances , viz. strong continuous east wind ?
, was only two miles , while the easterly set was found to be at hast ten miles during the ebb .
This , however , is the case with the surface-water only ; the bottom stratum is unaffected by the in-running current from the Atlantic and sets east or west according to the tides for equal periods ; and there is no reason to sup. pose that it is interfered with by westerly winds as the upper water undoubtedly is .
On the shallow ridge at the west entrance of the Strait the in-running current from the Atlantic is insufficient to counteract the effect of the west-running flood-tide , and a tidal influence was shown on both the surface-and bottom-water .
It was found that the surface-water moved towards the east during the ebb-tide faster than the bottom-water ; with the flood it set towards the west slower than the bottom-water ; and it ran towards the east faster than it ran towards the west .
The bottom-water ran to the westward with the flood faster than it ran to the eastward with the ebb .
The power exerting itself to produce this excess of west-running water at the bottom is therefore sufficient to annihilate the in-running current which makes itself so easily felt in the water above .
The prevailing set of the surface-current running from the westward into the Mediterranean being met and checked by an advancing tidal wave coming from the eastward , the water is raised and causes the flood-tide ( *.e .
cn the shore ) ; after the wave has passed the water falls , running to the eastward with the prevailing current ; thus the flood or rising tide by the shore in the Strait is produced by the west-running current .
The change of the tidal stream in the bottom stratum corresponds with the time of high and low water at Gibraltar .
With east winds , the surface-current stops running to the east from one to two hours after low water ; it turns to run to the east again at high water .
These observations may be of great practical use to the large number of sailing-vessels engaged in the Mediterranean trade .
Vessels intending to beat out of the Strait to the westward should get under weigh , or sail out from under shelter , at low water ; at half flood long tacks may be made from shore to shore , but shelter must be gained before high water .
The method and apparatus employed in observation of the currents were similar to those with which we have become familiar through the reports of recent deep-sea researches .
The current-drags were made of canvas , hanging 4 feet below two light wooden crossed yards , each 4 feet long , secured in the middle and weighted to 75 lbs. , the weights being attached to the bottom of the canvas .
This was suspended at the requisite depth by a fine line , 0 2 inch in diameter , hanging from one end of an iron buoy , 5| feet long , 1 foot in diameter in the middle , and pointed at each end , each buoy being capable of floating 100 lbs. weight .
Close to the current-drag was a stouter line by which to lift it out of the water , which 1872 .

the light line was incapable of doing .
The line was made very fine , to eliminate as much as possible the error which must always creep in in consequence of the suspending-line passing through currents running in different directions and at different speeds .
In practice it was found that the surface- and bottom-water were rarely moving at the same speed , which was indicated by the buoy from which the current-drag was suspended being pulled through the surface-water .
The movement of the current-drag itself floating in the lower stratum must therefore have been affected to a certain extent corresponding to the force of the upper current pressing against the buoy .
In making a correction for this movement , Captain Nares estimates that the current-drag was itself retarded to an extent equal to half the difference of their speed .
Although the pressure on the buoy carried it away from a position immediately over the current-drag , yet the suspending-line was never more than 5 ' out of the vertical , showing that the current-drag did not vary its depth of flotation to any appreciable extent .
To obtain the surface-drift , a current-drag , lowered 2 feet below the surface , was suspended from a cork sphere , 1 foot in diameter , which , floating with the top just above water , presented as little surface as possible to be acted upon by the wind , and kept the current-drag itself below the wash of the sea .
As these observations were made in August , when the evaporation of the Mediterranean is at its maximum , and the freshwater supply derived from rain and rivers at a minimum , no great increase in the in-running superficial current can be expected during the winter months when these conditions are reversed .
From these remarks we pass to the practical work of observation ; and it may suffice to give in full detail the proceedings of one day only , which will serve to show how the conclusions were arrived at .
On August 22nd , in mid-channel 4 miles S.S.W. of Tarifa , wind east , force 3 , with a smooth sea , about one hour after high water , after sounding in 325 fathoms* a current-drag was lowered 2 feet below the surface , and allowed to drift , the ship keeping station close to it to enable its position to be fixed occasionally by angles between shore objects .
It drifted in 28 minutes E.N.E. 0'8 mile = 1*7 mile an hour .
By observations immediately afterwards the temperature of the water at the surface was found to be 63 ' , and at 200 fathoms below 57 ' .
At 4| hours after high water , a boat was anchored in 330 fathoms .
The surface-current was then running towards the east at an estimated speed of 1*5 knot an hour .
A current-drag was lowered 150 fathoms , but soon after settling down , and before any measurement of the distance run could be obtained , its suspending-line foaled the anchor-line and was carried away , showing that a strong under-current was running to the eastward , which subsequent observations proved was its natural course at this time of tide .
The anchor was then picked up to change its position rather to the westward , where the strait was broader .
100 Capt. G. S. Nares on the [ Jan. 18 , At 2 hours after low water , the density of the bottom-water in 170 fathoms having been ascertained , a boat was anchored midway between Tangier and Cape Plata .
At 3 hours after low water the surface-current was found to be running to the westward one knot an hour by log-line .
A current-drag was then lowered 125 fathoms .
By mast-head angles from the boat at anchor it drifted in ten minutes N. 87 ' W. 450 yards =1'35 mile an hour .
The drag pulling its buoy through the surface-water to the westward indicated that the bottom-water was really moving at an estimated rate of 1*5 milfe an hour .
At 4 and 5 hours after low water , shore positions showed that the surface-water was running S.S.W. 0*4 mile an hour ; and at 5\#163 ; hours it was stationary .
The observations on this day , although not so continuous or complete as those taken subsequently , proved that the bottom-water was affected by tidal influence , running to the westward as the water was rising , and to the eastward as the water fell .
August 23rd.\#151 ; One hour and a half after high water , the weather being calm , with smooth sea , a buoy was anchored in 125 fathoms , with 25 fathoms of light chain and 150 fathoms of No. 2 sounding-line , on the north part of the shallow ridge stretching across the Strait between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar .
The surface-current , and probably the bottom-water also , was running so strongly to the eastward that the buoy sank from the pressure of the water against it and the line .
As it did not show itself again at slack water , it probably collapsed from pressure .
Two buoys were then anchored in the same place with a similar line and chain .
The lower buoy sank below the surface , leaving the second one floating with one foot of the top above water , indicating a strain of nearly 200 lbs. exerted by the pressure of the current on the line and buoys .
At 2^ hours after high water the surface-current was running east 1*25 mile an hour by log-line .
At a depth of 25 fathoms the direction and speed of the under-current were the same .
At 3^ hours after high water , the drag wras lowered to 100 fathoms , when a perceptible retardation of the under-current was observed , the surface-water setting to the east past the boat at an estimated rate of \#163 ; knot an hour .
The drag was then lowered to 119 fathoms , being 6 fathoms from the bottom , and attached to a buoy ; and on being observed half an hour later , or about 5 hours after high water , it was found by mast-head angles to have drifted !
E.N. !
E. 0'09 mile=0'18 mile per hour .
In the mean time the second buoy at anchor floated on its bilge , showing the surface-tide to have slackened and the strain to have lessened to about 110 lbs. , estimated as being equal to \#163 ; a knot .
Soon after the top of the underneath buoy floated one foot out of water , indicating a further decrease of tide .
At low water the bottom current-drag had drifted during the last hour 0 1 mile N.W. by N. The surface-current was running past the buoy to the eastward , and was therefore exercising some influence on the current- Currents in the Strait of Gibraltar .

] Ilrag , preventing it going to the N.W. as fast as it otherwise would .
And C at one hour after low water the drag had drifted W. | N. at a rate of 0*18 I mile an hour , while the surface-current had stopped running , as shown by fithe buoys at anchor .
)| Two hours after lowwater , the drag being placed at a depth of 108 fathoms , ; 10 fathoms above the bottom , immediately ran away with its buoy to the ( westward , and drew it fast through the surface-water against a light west - wind , force 1 ; at the same time the anchored buoys showed a very slight | surface-current running to the S.W. Half ' an hour later the bottom i current-drag had drifted west 0'48 of a mile = 0'96 mile an hour , the current itself at 1 *2 mile an hour .
The surface-current was running to the westward past the anchored buoys at an estimated speed of half a mile an hour .
From this day 's observations it appears that the bottom-water turned to run to the westward a little before , and the surface-stratum at about an hour after low water .
On August 26 , wind east , force 3 , with a considerable swell from the eastward , while making observations on the penetration of light at different depths of water , some current-buoys were anchored in mid-channel south of Europa Point , in 480 fathoms , to indicate the direction of the surface-current .
Half an hour before high water , when the current , if affected by tide alone , should have been running to the westward , it was found to be running towards the east at about half a mile an hour , indicated by the lowest of three buoys floating 2 feet above water .
During the next 2 hours , or until 11 hour after high water , the lowest buoy was out of sight and the second buoy had a slight strain on it , the tide estimated to be running three quarters of a mile an hour .
From 2f to 4 hours after high water the second buoy swimming , with half its depth immersed , indicated a tide of about 1 mile an hour .
The pressure on the buoys now increased sufficiently to sink two of them completely , and the strain proved to be too much for the anchor , which was found to be shifting its position .
At low water the current was running at its greatest speed , estimated to be 3 miles an hour , with no appearance of changing .
August 28.\#151 ; Wind easterly , force 6 , with a slight swell from the eastward .
As the strongest current was expected to be found on the African side of the Narrows , a position was taken up in the deep water from 2 to 3 miles north of Point Ceres .
At 3| hours after low water , when the current should have been running to the westward , a buoy anchored by a fine line ( to diminish the strain as much as possible ) showed it to be running to the eastward at an estimated speed of half a mile an hour , but from 1S hour before high water to high water there was little or no movement of the surface-water .
At high water the surface-current again commenced running to the eastward past the anchored buoys , and soon after the line was observed to have been carried away .
One hour and a half later the current-drag was lowered 225 fathoms , 102 Capt. G.S. Nares on the [ Jan. 18 , when its attached buoy immediately started off , moving towards the east much faster than the surface-current .
Angles taken to positions on shore showed that the drag was moving to the eastward 2*1 miles an hour .
Subsequent observations , made on the south side of the ridge of shallow water between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar , and in the Narrows south of Tarifa , confirmed the foregoing results , and showed that while the surface-current was running east 1 and 2 miles an hour , the bottom-currentwas moving in the same direction from 2*4 to 2* 6 miles .
Somewhat later , the under-current at 50 fathoms and the surface-current were found to have the same rate of speed , namely 3*8 miles an hour .
Differences of rate then took place , but the current maintained its direction and tidal character ; and as the rate of the under-current gradually decreased , there is no reason to suppose that it did not turn to run to the westward at low water .
The quicker movement of the under-current at the early part of the tide may have been due to retardation of the surface-current by a strong breeze from the east .
For all practical purposes the bottom-current below 100 fathoms may be regarded as uniform .
The current was found to turn with the tide , and to vary its rate in accordance with the progress of the ebb or the flow .
In concluding his report , Captain Nares remarks that on the 28th a much stronger east-running bottom current was experienced , which he attributes to the observations on that day being made in the position where the easterly in-set runs strongest ; but it may have been occasioned by a reflux of water into the Mediterranean stronger than usual to replace that blown to the westward during the previous east winds , which the swell denoted had been blowing strongly a day or two before .
For the first two hours of the ebb-tide the bottom-current ran to the eastward faster than the surface-current , the same as observed on the 28th .
The strong west-running under-current of 1*8 mile an hour thus shown to exist in the Narrows where the inflow of the Atlantic stream retards the surface-current most , agrees fairly with the slower movement of 1*2 mile an hour in the broader and shallower part to the westward , where the surface-water is less affected .
In the Narrows the last of the ebb and first of the flood sets across from Tarifa towards Point Ceres , joining the inshore current running to the westward along that shore .
These observations show that the under-current in the narrowest part of the Strait is affected by tidal influence , the same as the water on the shallow ridge to the westward .
But the eddies , which would naturally be expected at this part , in consequence of the funnel-shaped mouth of the Strait , complicate the movements and prevent such exact demonstrations as those found further to the westward , where the current stream runs more steadilyThe Report will shortly be published in full by the Admiralty .
