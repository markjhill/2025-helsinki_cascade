It was shown by Geitel , * and independently by the writer of this naper t that there is a continuous production of ions in air contained L a closed vessel , even when it is not exposed to any known ionising agent The present communication contains the results o measure ments of the relative rates of production of ions under such conditions in air and certain other gases . .

The relative ionisations ( the term " ionisation being used in sense of " rate of production of ions " ) were obtained by a comparison of the " saturation " currents in the various gases .
The apparatus use for this purpose differed only in minor details from that described an figured in a previous paper4 Vmlh The vessel in which the ionisation was measured was a glass bu b 5-5 cm .
in diameter , thinly silvered internally .
The conducting system from which took place the loss of charge to be measured , consisted of brass wire with a narrow strip of gold leaf attached , the wire eing fixed by means of a small bead of sulphur to a brass rod passing through a plug of sealing-wax in the neck of the bulb .
This supporting rod was kept at a constant potential by means of a condenser , con sisting of zinc plates embedded in sulphur .
Electrical connection could be made when required between the leaking system and t supporting rod by means of a strip of watch balance-spring soldered at its upper end to the supporting rod , and with its lower end bent so as to form a bridge over the sulphur bead .
By approaching a magne to the neck of the bulb the free end of the spring could be brought into contact with the upper end of the brass wire carrying the gold leaf .
The position of the gold leaf was read by means of a microscope provided with an eye-piece micrometer-scale .
On the portion of the scale used , one scale division corresponded to 0-31 volt , as tested by means of a Clark cell .
An initial potential of about 90 volts was used in the experiments . . . .
\#166 ; \#166 ; * j To make a determination of the rate of leak , the brass wire and gold leaf were brought to the potential of the supporting rod by making momentary electrical connection by means of the magnetic contact maker .
The time indicated by a watch at the moment of transit ol the gold leaf across the next scale division was then observed ; the moment of transit across a lower scale division about one hour later was also observed .
Contact was then made a second time and the position of the gold leaf again read .
The time taken by the gold leaf to traverse a certain whole number of scale divisions was thus deter-* ' Physik .

mined , and the constancy of the potential of the supporting rod at the same time tested .
The number of scale divisions traversed during the course of a determination of the leak did not in any case exceed ten ; in the case of the smallest rates of leak measured only one scale division was traversed .
As one scale division corresponded to 0-31 volt , the potential of the leaking system never fell more than about 3 Volts below that of the supporting rod .
The potential of the supporting rod did not itself remain absolutely constant , but fell generally from 1 to 2 volts in the hour , unless a small additional charge was given to the condenser during the course of the experiment ; this was done in the case of the smaller leaks .
The correction to be applied for a fall of potential of the support corresponding to a given number of scale divisions was determined by first making contact by means of the magnet , then reducing the potential of the supporting rod sufficiently to move the gold leaf across a whole number of scale divisions , and again making contact and observing the new potential of the supporting rod .
It was found that to make a change of potential in the leaking system corresponding to one scale division ( the charge remaining constant ) a change of potential of the supporting rod corresponding to 5-4 divisions was required ; or the correction to be applied for a fall of potential of the supporting rod corresponding to one scale division amounted to 0-18 of a division .
The error due to want of perfect insulating power in the sulphur bead was certainly very small .
Even when the supporting rod was earthed , so that the difference of potential between the two conducting systems separated by the sulphur was about 90 volts , the movement of the gold leaf , when the apparatus was exhausted , did not exceed one division per hour .
Under the conditions of the actual experiment the difference of potential between the two systems never exceeded 3 volts , and with the apparatus exhausted no leak was observed .
The apparatus for the preparation and drying of the gases was sealed on to the bulb in which the leakage was measured , all joints being made with the blow-pipe .
A mercury pump served to exhaust the apparatus before the introduction of the gases .
The gases were dried by passing them slowly over phosphoric anhydride .
The air was admitted through a cotton-wool filter .
The carbonic acid was prepared by heating sodium bicarbonate .
The hydrogen used in the first experiments was prepared from zinc and sulphuric acid ; in the later experiments the gas thus obtained was absorbed by palladium , from which it was set free by heating .
The sulphur dioxide was obtained from a " siphon " of the liquid substance .
The chloroform vapour was obtained from the commercial .

On the Spontaneous Ionisation of Groses .
281 It will be noticed that except at the higher pressures the leak is proportional to the pressure .
The falling off from this law at the higher pressures might be taken as indicating that the ionisation is due to radiation from the walls of only moderate penetrating power ; it is possible , however , that at the higher pressures a sensible proportion of the ions recombine , so that the current is not a measure of the ionisation .
There can be no doubt that , for the range of pressures for which the leakage is proportional to the pressure , we may consider that the saturation current was attained , and the rate of leak may be taken as a measure of the ionisation .
It is for such pressures that the relative ionisations have been calculated .
They are collected together in the table which follows .

The deviations in the case of the other gases in fact hardly exceed what might be attributed to experimental errors , for variations amounting to as much as 10 per cent , occurred in the determination of the rate of leak for a given gas .
The departure from the law in the case of hydrogen cannot be attributed to experimental error , nor is it due to want of purity of the gas , as is shown by the agreement in the results obtained with the gas prepared by different methods .
The results obtained for the relative ionisation occurring spontaneously in all the gases tried , including hydrogen , show a remarkable similarity to those obtained by Strutt* in the case of the same , gases when under the action of the Becquerel rays , as the following table shows ( p. 282 ) .
It was pointed out by Strutt that the conductivity under the action of the rays is nearly proportional to the density of the gas , hydrogen , however , being an exception .
As will be seen , the results I have obtained for the spontaneous ionisation agree more nearly with those obtained by Strutt for gases exposed to radium radiation than for the same gases under the action of polonium rays .

He found the loss to be the same in air , carbonic acid , and hydrogen .
Warburg , !
in 1872 found the loss in air and carbonic acid to be equal , and in hydrogen about half as great .
They used much larger vessels , and it is probable that in Warburg 's experiments the saturation current was not approached , so that the leakage was not even approximately proportional to the ionisation ; it is perhaps in this way that the discreEelative Conductivity ( Air =1 ) .

In Matteucci 's experiments , however , the leakage was independent of the potential \ he was therefore using potentials high enough to produce the saturation current , and some other explanation is in this case required .
One possible way out of the difficulty would be to suppose that the ionisation is to be explained by a slight radio-activity of the walls , the radiation being of only moderate penetrating power .
In a large vessel all the radiation might be absorbed even by hydrogen , and in that case we should expect to find the same total number of ions produced in a given time whatever gas the vessel contained .
} At the same time the similarity between the results obtained for the relative ionisations of different gases in the small vessel with those of the same gases exposed to the action of radium would be explained ( the ionisation being due to a similar ; cause ) , as also would the departure at the higher pressures from the simple law connecting pressure and rate of leak , which holds for the lower pressures , for at the higher pressures the intensity of the rays might be considerably reduced by absorption before reaching the central portions of the vessel .
Until , however , further experiments have been made it would , I ; think , be premature to conclude that the ionisation is due to radiation from the walls of the vessel .
