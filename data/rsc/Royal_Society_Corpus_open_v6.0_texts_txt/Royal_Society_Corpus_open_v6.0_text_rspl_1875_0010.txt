Magnetic Work.\#151 ; The year has been marked by the recommencement of regular work with the Magnetographs , wMch had been taken down for examination and repair by Mr. Adie , as described in the last Report .
The scale-values having been redetermined , the instruments were set in action on the 1st of January , 1875 , and therewith the second series of continuous photograpMc records of magnetic phenomena was inaugurated .
The montMy observations with the absolute instruments have been continued , as usual , by Mr. G. M. Whipple , who also takes charge of the general magnetic work , in which he has had the assistance of Mr. Cullum and E. Eigg .
The two Sergeants of the Poyal Artillery , ormerly in .
Sir E. Sabine s office at V7oolwich , have been in regular attendance at Kew throughout the year .
The principal constants employed in the computations for the Tables .
Report of the Keiv .
i\#169 ; d in the reduction of the monthly absolute observations which had |en determined by Mr. Welsh have been re-examined .
A memorandum antaining the results of the observations in question for the twelve tenths ending Sept. 30 , 1875 , has been prepared , and is appended to lis Report ; and it is the intention of the Committee to furnish similar ntistics with each of their subsequent Reports .
j A paper embodying the results of absolute determinations for the six i\gt ; ars ending with March 1875 has been prepared and submitted to the iDciety ; it forms a continuation of the similar paper for the pre-bding six years , ending March 1869 , which was submitted by Dr. B. r tewart , and is printed in the ' Proceedings of the Society/ vol. xviii .
1 The Magnetic Reductions for the current year have been kept up nearly b date .
As regards the arrears of work shown in the tabular statement rppended to the Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for 1870-71 , no progress had been made in dealing with any of the elements ( with the exception of the tabulation of the Declination curves ) up o the month of April last , owing to the insufficiency of the regular staff 0 deal with such a mass of materials ; at that period , however , an extra assistant was engaged to undertake the reduction of these arrears .
y ihis means good progress has been made with the first portion of this work , the preparation of the " fair " and " subsidiary " tabulations tor \gt ; ;he years 1871\#151 ; 1873 .
xt -n r\#187 ; .
1 Magnetic data have been supplied to Sir W. Thomson , DC D. , Lh .
Atkinson , Capt. Ettrick Creak , R.N. , Mr. Woodward , and Mr. D. A. Rowland .
_ , The Unifilar and Dip-circle lent to the Rev. S. J. Perry for use at Kerguelen Island on the Transit-of-Venus Expedition , as mentioned in last Report , have been returned by that gentleman .
A Unifilar lent trom Kew , in the year 1869 , to Capt. Elagin , Imperial Russian Navy , was t returned by him in Eebruary of this year , and at his request the con-stants were redetermined and the results forwarded to him .
s I left a Dip-circle at Kew to be repaired .
, \#163 ; , Meteorological Worlc.\#151 ; The several self-recording instruments tor t ) continuous registration respectively of Pressure , Temperature , umi i y , I Wind ( Direction and Velocity ) , and Rain have been maintained m regu a [ operation as usual under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker , assisted by T. i Gunter .
The daily standard eye-observations for the control ot t e ; automatic records have been made regularly .
In addition to the regular work of Kew as one of the se _ rec_01^ " 1 Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological O ce , ^ e c y :\lt ; examining and checking the work of all the seven Observatories ot e I same character has been carried on , in accordance with the method ae-4 scribed in the Report of the British Association for 1869 .
This por ion c of the work has been performed by Messrs. Cullum , Hawkeswor , 1 .Deane .
In the month of August application was made to the Observa- 104 Report of the Kew Committee .
tory by the Meteorological Office for the services of one of the staff to take temporary charge of the Valencia Observatory , owing to the serious illness of the Superintendent of that Station , the Rev. Thomas Kerr , who has since died .
Mr. Cullum at once consented to undertake the duty , and he has remained at Valencia up to the present time .
This change has necessarily weakened the working power of Kew in the special department now under consideration ; and in consequence a certain amount of arrears have accumulated , but these will be ere long cleared off .
The only change as regards the photographic instruments has been the substitution of copper chimneys for the gas-jets for the glass chimneys formerly in use , an alteration which has proved to be beneficial .
The result of a careful comparison of the thermogram tabulations at the several observatories , obtained by the use of the fiducial lines traced on the curves by photography , with the standard readings , has shown that the original glass scales supplied ( the values for which had been determined at Kew in 1868 ) were not in all'instances sufficiently exact , and new scales have accordingly been supplied where requisite .
Electrometer.\#151 ; The Self-recording Electrometer continues in operation .
Some imperfection , of which the cause was not clearly ascertained , interrupted the continuity of the action of the instrument in August ; but this was overcome and the record resumed .
Experiments for obtaining the scale-value have been made by the use of a battery of 100 Bunsen 's cells , Mr. Ellis , Superintendent of the Meteorological and Magnetic Department at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , has visited Kew , by direction of the Astronomer Royal , in order to examine the instrument , in the view of the possible procuring of a similar apparatus for Greenwich .
Photoheliograph.\#151 ; The instrument which , in February 1873 , was transferred to Greenwich for the use of the Astronomer Royal has been reported by him to be ready for immediate return to Kew .
The re-examination of the measurements of the Kew sun-pictures , as noticed in the last Report , has been steadily carried on throughout the year ( at the expense of Mr. De La Rue , D.C.L. ) by Mr. Whipple , assisted by Mr. M'Laughlin , who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose .
The eye-observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , have been made daily by Mr. Foster , when possible , as described in the Report for 1872 , in order , for the present , to maintain the continuity of the Kew record of sun-spots .
Extra Observations.\#151 ; The experiments with a Photometer for measuring the total intensity of daylight , which has been designed by Prof. H. E. Roscoe , Ph. D. , have been continued during the year , as mentioned in last Report .
The original instrument provided by Prof. Roscoe having proved defective , it was replaced by another , which remains on trial .
The observations with Thermometers at different levels on the Pagoda Report of the Kew Committee .
\gt ; jl Kew G-ardens were resumed in November 1874 , after an interval of a lw months , and were continued until March , when the experiments =nere concluded , having lasted over nearly two years .
The results have oteen sent to the Meteorological Office , at the expense of which Department the investigation was conducted .
JSj A commencement has been made of the observation of Solar Radiation f , t Kew ; and Thermometers for that purpose ( " Black bulbs in vacuo , " ) lie different makers ) have been placed in the grounds and read regularly .
[ The Registering Sundial invented by Mr. J. F. Campbell , F.Gr .
S. , i/ which has been in operation for several years at the Office of the Local Government Board , 8 Richmond Terrace , Whitehall , has been trans-lirred to Kew , and is in action at the Observatory .
It consists of a Mass sphere and wooden bowl , and the effect is measured by the amount \gt ; f wood charred by the sun 's action in the course of six months .
Experiments are in progress to obtain a satisfactory daily record of the duration of the sun 's heating-action by a similar method .
Verifications.\#151 ; This department of the Observatory continues to exhibit increased activity , and , in more than one respect , important steps ittave been taken with the view of augmenting its efficiency .
| The following magnetic instruments were verified:\#151 ; 2 Unifilars for the Arctic Expedition .
2 Declinometers for the Arctic Expedition .
2 Barrow 's Dip-circles for the Arctic Expedition .
3 Fox 's Circles for the Arctic Expedition .
1 Fox 's Circle for Staff-Commander Creak .

A double box Sextant , together with a Transit-Theodolite , has been obtained , verified , and forwarded to Major Knight in India .
The apparatus devised by Mr. E. Gfalton for facilitating the verification of Thermometers , which was mentioned in the last Beport , has been erected at Kew , and has been found of great service , especially in the way of affording means of maintaining high temperatures for a considerable length of time .
A number of tubes of exceptional range , for the construction of Standard Thermometers , have been added to those at present in stock .
" With reference to the testing of Anemometers , as mentioned in last Beport , with the hope that the experiments with artificial rotation would be resumed on a future occasion , it has been found that the large expense Report of the Kew .
107 .hich would be entailed to provide a suitable apparatus for use at Kew !
fjould exceed the resources of the Observatory .
These investigations iv therefore not been carried out hitherto , i It has appeared desirable to replace the Cathetometer used in con-i exion with the Standard Barometer by a new instrument ; and accord- !
igly such an apparatus is in process of construction .
As soon as this *oj completed it is intended to institute a comparison between the Stanford Barometers at Kew and Greenwich , the Astronomer Boyal having s aost readily consented to such an operation .
1 Information on meteorological results has been supplied to Mr. G. J. xdymons , the Secretary of the Northern Institute of Mining Engineers , .'dr .
K. J. Marks , and the Editor of the * Illustrated London News .
' L Pendulum Apparatus.\#151 ; In the use made of the Kew pendulum vacuum-Bihamber by Capt. Heaviside , B.E. , in the course of the year 1874 , it was hound that a certain amount of deterioration in the joints had taken j )lace .
These have since been newly , ground and rendered air-tight so as 'o be ready for use .
Mr. 0 .
J. Pierce , of the United States Coast Survey , having made i through the Admiralty an application to the Boyal Society to be liillowed to swing his pendulums at Kew , has at once received permission , and the experiments will be undertaken in the course of the ensuing ; f year .
Two Iron Tripods , which had been formerly used for swinging invariable pendulums , and had remained in store at Kew , were granted by uthe Committee to the Hydrographer for the service of the Arctic Expedition .
They were repaired at the expense of the Admiralty ; and !
while one of them still remains at Kew , the other has been supplied to the Expedition , together with the wooden clock-supports ; at the same r time an Astronomical Clock ( Shelton , No. 35 ) was also supplied to the 1 Hydrographic Office .
Chronometer Testing.\#151 ; It has been under deliberation during the year whether or not it would be advisable to institute at Kew an Office for l the testing and rating of Chronometers , of a similar character to that j conducted at Bidston Observatory by Mr. J. Hartnup .
The President and Council of the British Horological Institute have I expressed themselves favourably to the proposal in a scientific point of i view ; but as yet no decision has been arrived at by the Committee .
Instruction given.\#151 ; Four Officers from the Arctic Expedition attended i at Kew for instruction in the use of Magnetic instruments , and two h others for instruction in the swinging of pendulums and in the use of I the Transit-Instrument .
The final observations of these gentlemen were C recorded for making Kew a base station .
Certain modifications in the j absolute Magnetic instruments , designed by Mr. Whipple for adaptation i for use in high , latitudes , have been effected to the satisfaction of the P Hydrographer .

Ill APPENDIX .
Magnetic Observations made at the Kew Observatory , Lot .
51 ' 28 ' 6 " JV .
Long. Oh lm 15s , l W. , for the year October 1874 to September 1875 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked KCl , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones , the property of the Magnetic Office , directed by General Sir E. Sabine .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3| inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the units in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English values to metric values being O46108 .
The moment of inertia of the magnet with its stirrup was determined in 1858 by the late Mr. Welsh , as were also the coefficients applied in corrections for temperature variations and terrestrial induction .
The value of log 7r2K employed in the reduction is T64457 at temperature 60 ' .
The induction-coefficient p is 0000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' Fahr. is 0-0001194(*0 - 35 ) + 0-000,000,213(*0 - 35)a .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting'tod deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1-0 ft. and 1-3 ft. , are 1*000075 ft. and 1-300097 ft. respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction \#163 ; ) .
\#187 ; -0-00192 .
In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected about Report of the Kew a quarter of a mile north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , was determined by the late Mr. Welsh , and has since been carefully verified .
