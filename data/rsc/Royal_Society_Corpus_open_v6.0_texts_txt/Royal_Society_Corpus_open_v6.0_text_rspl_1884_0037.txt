It has been known for some time , through the researches of Sabine and others , that there is a close connexion between the Inequalities in the state of the sun 's surface as denoted by sun-spot areas and those in terrestrial magnetism as denoted by the diurnal ranges of oscillation of the declination magnet ; and moreover , the observations , of Baxendell , Meldrum , and various other meteorologists have induced ?
us to suspect* that there may likewise be a connexion between solar yinequalities and-those in terrestrial meteorology .
This latter connexion , however , assuming it to exist , is not so well established as* the former\#151 ; at least if we compare together Inequalities of long period .
Attempts have been made to explain this by imagining that for long periods the state of the atmosphere , as regards absorption , may change in such a manner as to diminish or even cloak the effects of solar variation by increasing the absorption when the sun is strongest and diminishing the absorption when the sun is weakest .
On this account it has seemed to us desirable to make a comparison of this kind between short-period Inequalities , since for these the length of period could not so easily be deemed sufficient to produce a great alteration of the above nature in the state of the atmosphere .
The meteorological element which we have selected for comparison with sun-spots has been the diurnal range of atmospheric temperature\#151 ; an element which presents in its variations a very strong analogy to diurnal declination-range .
2 .
There are two ways in which a comparison might be made between solar and terrestrial Inequalities .
We might take each individual valuation in sun-spot areas and find the value of the terrestrial element corresponding in time to the maximum and the minimum of the solar wave .
If we were to perform this operation for every individual solar Inequality and add together the results , we might Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
291 perhaps find that the magnetic declination-range was largest when there were most sun-spots .
If , however , we were to make a similar comparison between sun-spot daily areas , that is to say , the daily aggregate areas occupied by spots including penumbrae , and diurnal temperature-ranges , we might not obtain a decisive result .
For at certain stations such as Toronto , it is suspected ( the verification or disproval of this suspicion being one of the objects of this paper ) that there are two maxima and two minima of temperature-range for one of sun-spots .
This is not a phenomenon unknown in other branches of meteorology , as for instance in barometric pressure , which has two oscillations in one day .
Its effect , however , might be such that , in a comparison made as above , the temperature-range corresponding to a maximum of sun-spots might be equal in value to that corresponding to a minimum , or , in other words , we should get no apparent result , while , however , by some different process , proofs of a real connexion might be obtained .
But if we can get evidences of apparent periodicity in sun-spot fluctuations when dealt with in a particular manner , we have a method which will afford us a definite means of comparison .
And here , as Professor Stokes has pointed out , it is not necessary for our present purpose to discuss the question whether these sun-spot Inequalities have a real or only an apparent periodicity.* All that is needful is to treat the terrestrial phenomena in a similar manner , or in a manner as nearly similar as our observations will allow , and then see whether they likewise exhibit periodicities ( apparent or real ) having virtually the same times as those of the sun-spots\#151 ; the phases of the two sets of phenomena being likewise allied in a constant manner .
It is such a comparison that we have here made , but before describing the results obtained , it will first be necessary to describe the method of analysis which we have adopted .
Method of Analysis .
3 .
Our method is one which enables us to detect the existence of unknown Inequalities having apparent periodicity in a mass of # It is well known that when we discuss a series of figures , we frequently detect peculiarities of some kind , which strike the eye but hare no scientific meaning .
Such peculiarities might occasionally assume the form of apparent periodicities , and there is no reason why they should not manifest themselves when the figures we are discussing represent the progress of some natural phenomenon .
Moreover , in this last case we may sometimes perceive irregular attempts at repetition , such as we observe in volcanic phenomena , to which , however , we are unable to assign any true periodicity .
Now it is imaginable that such appearances as we have indicated above may take place in our list of sun-spot areas without implying the presence of true periodicity ; but whether such marks of periodicity as those records present be real or only apparent , inasmuch as they do occur we should expect them likewise to occur in such terrestrial phenomena as are closely connected with sun-spots .

observations .
A description of this method has already been published in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society , " May 15 , 1879 but in order to render what follows more clear , we shall to some extent reproduce this description .
Imagine , by way .
of illustration , that we have in our possession a long series of temperatures of the earth 's atmosphere at some place in middle latitudes , and that , independently of our astronomical knowledge , we were to make use of these for the purpose of investigating the natural Inequalities of terrestrial temperature .
We should begin by grouping the observations according to various periods taken , say , at small but definite time-intervals from each other .
Now , if our series of observations were sufficiently extensive , and if some one of our various groupings together of this series should correspond to a real Inequality , we should expect it to exhibit 1 a well-defined and prominent fluctuation , whose departure above and below the mean should be of considerable amount .
Suppose , for I instance , that we have 24 places in our series , that is to say , we !
proceed to group our mass of temperature observations in rows of 24 each , and suppose farther that the time-interval between two contiguous members of one row is exactly one hour .
The series would thus represent the mean solar day , and we should , without doubt , obtain from a final summation and average of our rows , a result exhibiting a prominent temperature fluctuation of a well-defined character , which we might measure ( as long as we kept to-24 points ) by simply adding together all the departures of its various points from the mean , whether these points be above or below ; in fine , by obtaining the area of the curve which is the graphical representation of the Inequality above and below the line of abscisses taken to represent the mean of all the points .
4 .
Suppose next that , still keeping to rows of 24 places , we should make the time-interval between two contiguous members of a row somewhat different from One hour , whether greater or less , we should now in either case obtain a result exhibiting , when measured as above , a much smaller Inequality than that given when the interval was exactly one hour ; and it is even possible that if our series of observations were sufficiently extensive we should obtain hardly any traces of an Inequality whatever .
In fine , when each row accurately represented a solar day , the result would be an Inequality of large amount , but when each row represented a period either slightly less or greater than a day , the result would be an Inequality of small amount .
This process as far as we have described it is not new , having been already used by Baxendell and probably by other observers of stellar variability .
In the present instance we should by its means , after bestowing enormous labour in variously grouping in accordance with Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
293 a great number of periods taken at small intervals from eacb other , obtain at length an accurate value of the mean solar day .
5 .
Reflection will , however , convince us that it is possible greatly to abridge this labour .
Let us still keep to our illustration of temperature observations but , since ignorance regarding the length of the day is inconceivable , let us imagine that a staff of observers have strict orders to register the temperature at every exact hour of a mean time clock .
Let us further suppose that the rate of this clock is constant but not quite correct , and that the observations so made extend over a series of years .
It is required by means of these observations to determine the clock-rate .
To do this we might , if we chose , laboriously arrange the whole body of observations in a number of different groups , one group representing 24 hours by the clock , and other groups a little more or a little less .
Amongst these some one grouping would be found to exhibit when the summations were made a maximum amount of fluctuation , and we should naturally imagine that the time-scale of this grouping was the best representative of the mean solar day .
We might , however , obtain the same result with infinitely less labour , and for this purpose we need not make any other fundamental grouping than that which denotes 24 clock hours .
Let us then arrange these observations in yearly series and find the average Inequality for each year .
Now suppose that for the first year the mean maximum diurnal temperature occurred at 2 p.m. clock time , for the second year at 1 p.m. , for the third year at noon , and so on , retiring backwards one hour every year .
We should , of course , conclude that the clock went one hour slow every year , and should thus obtain at once the clock-rate .
And by pushing the second year 's Inequality one place forward , the third year 's two places forward , and so on , adding together the series so placed , and ultimately taking the mean , we should obtain a good value of the true temperature Inequality corresponding to the exact mean solar day .
We have chosen a very obvious instance , but of course the clock error in one year might not be exactly one hour , and it might be necessary to arrange the yearly series in a number of different ways with regard to each other before we obtained the grouping which gave us the maximum Inequality .
But at length this result would be obtained and without the expenditure of more than a moderate amount of labour , and when obtained the time-scale belonging to it would represent the mean solar day .
It is virtually this method which we have employed in our present investigation , and we shall now state what observations , solar and terrestrial , we have at our disposal , and also how we have applied our method to these observations .
294 Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter .
Sun-spot Observations and their Treatment .
6 .
We have begun by taking daily values of sun-spot areas commencing with Schwabe 's observations , which have been reduced by Messrs. De La Rue , Stewart , and Loewy .
These reduced records giving total areas for individual days will be found in an Appendix to the Report of the Solar Physics Committee .
They extend from 1832 , the date when Schwabe appears to have matured his system of observation , to 1853 inclusive .
From 1854 to 1860 inclusive , we have made use of Carrington 's accurate observations ; for 1861 we have had to fall back once more upon Schwabe ; while from 1862 to 186V inclusive we have the Kew series of observations .
These various series form , when put together , one whole series of 36 years .
In many cases , owing to bad weather , there are gaps or blanks between observations which we have filled up by the simplest possible form of interpolation .
These 36 years ' observations , when the blanks have been filled up , give us therefore one long series of more or less trustworthy daily records of the total area of spots on the sun 's visible disk , the unit of measurement being the one-millionth of the sun 's visible hemisphere .
7 .
Let us now in the first place group together these sun-spot observations in rows of 24 days each , dividing the whole body of observations so tabulated into 36 yearly series .
A year will contain generally 15 , but occasionally 16 lines of 24 places each , that is to say , it will consist of 15 , or sometimes 16 , horizontal rows , the number of places in each horizontal row being always 24 .
The sums of each of the 24 vertical columns for each year are now taken .
We have thus for each year a series of 24 sums .
But it is obvious that these sums will be greater in years of maximum than in years of minimum sun-spots , so that to use them as they stand would virtually mean to give great weight to years of maximum as compared with years of minimum sun-spots in our search for Inequalities .
We have endeavoured to overcome this difficulty in the following manner .
If sun-spot observations be put into a graphical form , it will at once be seen that whenever the total sun-spot area is great , the oscillations of this , or ranges of sun-spot Inequalities , are great also , and that these ranges may , as a first approximation at least , be deemed proportional to the general sun-spot activity .
In other words , the oscillations of areas are nearly proportional to the areas .
We have , therefore , taken the above-mentioned 24 numbers for every year , and proportionally altered them so that the sum of the 24 shall for each year be equal to 24,000 .
Each sum for each year should , therefore , be equal to 1000 , provided it be not subject to the influence of some Inequality .
Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
295 If however , there be a 24-day Inequality , some of these values will be larger and others smaller than 1000 , and it is their differences from 1000 that we finally record with plus and minus signs in order to form our yearly series .
It is , however , necessary here to remark that in certain minimum years the observations which exhibit sunspots are sometimes too unfrequent to render the year tabulated as above in rows of 24 a trustworthy representative of the Inequalities we are in search of .
In such cases we have taken in addition half a year on each side of the minimum year , so that we have thus the mean of two years instead of one , the central point of the series being , however , as before , the middle of the minimum year .
This treatment has been applied to the years 1833 , 1844 , 1855 , and 1856 .
The course of procedure described above may , we think , be justified by the following considerations :\#151 ; We are engaged in applying to the sun-spot records a method of analysis unquestionably founded on repetition .
We are , therefore , in as far as our analysis is concerned , trying to find if there is repetition in solar records , that is to say , trying to discover if they are possessed of periodicity , whether appai'ent or real .
Then the question arises how to prevent years of many sun-spots from dominating in our results to the exclusion of years of few spots .
Now it is nearly certain that , assuming a connexion between the state of the sun and variations in terrestrial meteorology , sun-spots are only a celestial symptom of a certain variable state of the s tin 's surface , perhaps of a state of variable power , which is the true cause of terrestrial variability .
That is to say , it is highly probable that spots are not themselves the causes of these terrestrial changes , and it is quite certain that the efficient ( in contradistinction to the apparent spot ) variation in the state of the sun , whatever it be , will not be found to present ranges so great as those presented by sun-spots ; for instance , spots may be entirely absent from the sun 's surface , and yet the sun will cause diurnal variations in magnetism and meteorology of large amount .
An efficient in contradistinction to a sun-spot oscillation of short period ( presuming this to exist ) , may perhaps vary in magnitude from times of maximum to times of minimum sunspots\#151 ; of this we are ignorant\#151 ; all that we know is that the variation in magnitude of this efficient oscillation is doubtless less than that of the sun-spots which indicate it .
The efficient oscillation may possibly be represented by a periodic function of short periodicity having a coefficient which varies from times of maximum to times of minimum sun-spots .
But if so we are at present concerned only with the short period function , and we can see no other way of obtaining this than by assigning what we imagine to be an average value to the coefficient of the indicating sun-spot variation so as to give all years an equal weight .
This is virtually what we have done in our 296 Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter .
treatment of sun-spots as above described , and we have adopted a similar plan with our terrestrial records .
8 .
Thus at length by the means now described we obtain 36 yearly series corresponding to the years from 1832 to 1867 inclusive , each series containing positive and negative quantities whose sums are exactly equal .
Let us represent these as follows:\#151 ; ( 1)33 ( 2)32 ( 3)32 . . .
( 24)33 ( 1)33 ( 2)33 ( 3)33 . . .
( 24)83 ( 1)67 ( 2)67 ( 3)e7 . . .
( 24)67 Now if we allow these terms to stand as above and take the sums of I the various vertical columns , we shall obtain a result denoting ( when divided by 36 ) the final Inequality corresponding to 24 days !
exactly as well as this can be represented by the whole body of observations at our disposal .
Suppose , however , we arrange the horizontal lines in such a manner that ( 24)33 comes under ( 23)32 , and ( 1)34 under ( 24)33 , and so on .
If we then sum up the vertical lines so arranged , the result will now represent an Inequality having a period so much longer than 24 days , that the difference amounts to one day in the course of a year .
This period will easily be found by the following proportion .
If in 365*25 days things advance 1 day , how much will they advance in 24 days ?
The result is =0-0657 , and hence the pieriod of the Inequality in question will be 24"0657 days .
In the above example things have been pushed each year one place backwards , that is to say , from right to left ; had they been pushed one place forwards this would have denoted an Inequality as much less in period than 24 days , as the one we have now considered is greater , in other words , one with a period of 23*9343 days .
So in like manner two or three places backwards each year will denote Inequalities with periods of 24-1314 and 24*1971 days , and two or three places forwards inequalities with periods of 23*8686 and 23*8029 days and so on .
Here the law is sufficiently obvious .
The comparative magnitude of the final Inequality so obtained may be found by simply adding together all its 24 terms without respect of sign , the sum representing the total area ot departure from the mean , which the Inequality would have exhibited had it been put into a graphical form .
9 .
To obtain the proper phase of the Inequality let us arrange our series of individual observations so that the first begins with January 1 , 1832 , and let us suppose , for instance , that we are dealing Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
297 with an Inequality which exceeds the 24-day period by six days in one year .
Our object is to represent this and all other Inequalities with the phase they have in the beginning of 1832 , that is to say , to represent each by a row of 24 figures ( plus and minus ) , the first of which denotes the phase on January 1 , 1832 .
Now , since the particular Inequality in question is larger in period than 24 days , corresponding phases will gradually advance to the right , and hence the j mean phase for 1832 , which is denoted by the true phase for July 1 of that year , will be three ( i.e. , one-half of six ) divisions to the right as regards the phase for January 1 .
Hence it will be necessary , in order to represent this Inequality as it was on January 1 , 1832 , to push the 1832 series three places to the left , and then each successive yearly series six places to the left of the one before it .
The method of setting for a difference representing an exact number of days in each year is thus obvious .
It is equally easy to set for differences representing not only whole days , but also , fractional parts of days .
For instance , let it be required to set for an Inequality greater than 24 days by 3'75 days each year .
Bearing in mind from what we have said that the mean H # 3.75 w of 1832 is \#151 ; \#151 ; days wrong , " we have as follows:\#151 ; Phase has gone Phase has to be pulled Year .

Having thus explained our principle of setting we shall now briefly describe the practice which it has been found most convenient to adopt .
The whole number of yearly series is regarded as being made up of three sets of 12 years each , namely , 1832\#151 ; 43 , 1844-55 , 1856-67 , and Inequalities are obtained representing 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , \amp ; c. , days ' difference plus or minus in 12 years .
Thus 24_39 or simply \#151 ; 39 represents , according to our notation , an Inequality whose period falls short of 24 days by 39 days in 12 years , and so on .
It has not been deemed necessary to make separate and complete settings for each of the small stages indicated above , but only for every third .
Thus , for instance , we should make separate and complete settings for \#151 ; 42 , \#151 ; 39 , \#151 ; 36 , \amp ; c. , obtaining in each case three partial sums of 12 years each , the sum of which would represent the final Inequality .
But with regard to the Inequality \#151 ; 41 we should esteem it sufficiently accurate if the first set of 12 years for \#151 ; 42 be 298 Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter .
kept as it is\#151 ; the second set be pushed to the left of the first one division , and the third to the left of the second one division\#151 ; the sum of the three 12-yearly series so placed being taken to represent \#151 ; 41 .
In like manner for \#151 ; 43 we should push the second 12-yearly series of \#151 ; 42 one division to the right of the first , and the third one division to the right of the second .
The method which we have now described applies both to the Inequalities around 24 days of which we have spoken , and to those around 26 days which we are also about to exhibit .
Here , however , one day m a year means \#166 ; \#166 ; K ^ \#166 ; 365*25 treatment is the same for both .
or *0712 day .
In other respects the Temperature-range Observations and their Treatment .
11 .
We are indebted to the Meteorological Council , the Kew Committee , and to Messrs. Kingston and Carpmael , the late and the present Directors of the Toronto Observatory , for 36 years of the Diurnal Temperature-ranges at Toronto , extending from the beginning of 1844 to the end of 1879 .
We have also obtained 24 years of the Diurnal Temperature-ranges at Kew , extending from 1856 to 1879 , for which we are indebted to the Kew Committee .
These observations have been split up into series of 12 years each , the first two series of Toronto and the last series of Kew being coterminous with solar series , the last series of Toronto and the last of Kew being , however , 12 years later than the last solar series .
It thus appears that a different series of years is represented in each case .
It would , of course , have been better for our purpose if precisely the same series of years had been represented by the three sets of observations ; but as this is not the case we have not scrupled to make the comparison implied in this research between the whole body of observations as they stand , believing that in so doing we shall make the best use of the materials placed at our disposal .
12 .
Here it will be necessary to allude to a method of treatment which we have thought it desirable to apply to the temperature-range observations , but which we have not found it necessary to apply to those of sun-spots .
Having obtained the yearly Inequalities corresponding to 24 days in exactly the manner already described , we have to some extent smoothed or equalised our series of differences .
The primary series ( A ) has been converted into another series ( B ) , also of 24 sums , each sum of ( B ) being the mean of four consecutive sums of ( A ) , and the series ( B ) has been converted by a similar process into a series ( C ) , each sum of which is the mean of four consecutive sums of ( B ) .
It is the series ( 0 ) which is ultimately made use of .
Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
299 The temperature-range Inequalities around 26 days have been dealt with in a similar manner , except that ( B ) is a mean of 3 not 4 sums of ( A ) , and ( C ) a mean of 3 not 4 sums of ( B ) .
Here , too , it is the series ( 0 ) which is ultimately used .
13 .
These smoothed series have then been treated exactly after the manner in which we have treated the sun-spot series , and with them too the first term of each Inequality represents the phase of that Inequality which would have corresponded to January 1 , 1832 , provided the terrestrial records had extended back to that date .
Thus the phases of the celestial and terrestrial Inequalities both start from the same epoch , and are in this respect strictly comparable with one another .
Limits of Accuracy of this Method .
14 .
It is obvious that the method now described can only be com sidered as correct for periods not far removed on either side from that for which the series was originally framed .
Thus in the case of 24 days it is apparent that 12 places pushed backwards every year would imply the same setting as 12 places pushed forwards , and also for 26 days 13 places pushed backwards each year would yield the same result as 13 places pushed forwards ; it will not , therefore , do to extend the method nearly so far .
It is imagined that four days a year on each side will form a legitimate boundary , or , adopting the notation of Art .
10 , that the region between the limits \#151 ; 48 and -{- 48 will not be seriously open to objection .
Considering it , however , desirable that this point should be verified by some kind of actual trial , we have adopted the results deduced from a series of observations of Diurnal Declination-ranges at Kew excluding disturbances ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " May 15 , 1879 ) .
These observations extend from 1858 to 1873 inclusive , forming a series of 16 years , and they have been arranged as follows:\#151 ; a. In yearly series representing 24 days in length , beginning January 1 , 1858 .
y9 .
In yearly series representing 24'25 days in length , beginning January 1 , 1858 .
Both of these series have been treated according to the method described above , and settings have been made at distances denoting half a day in a year , and extended on each side to lengths which are probably beyond the limits of safety .
The magnitudes of the Inequalities represented by the various settings have been obtained by summing up the positive and negative departures , and the results are exhibited graphically in the following diagram in which abscissae represent periods , while the ordinates represent corresponding Inequalities .

It will at once be seen by comparing figs. I and II that they both exhibit very nearly the same positions for maximum Inequalities .
Towards the right , however , there are indications that the limits of safety have been exceeded .
But there seems reason to suppose that we shall be safe within the limits which we have set for ourselves , and which correspond to about a quarter of a day on either side of the normal .
Our next point is to ascertain how far the phase of a prominent Inequality , as , for instance , that near 24 days determined by the one series , agrees with the same as determined by the other .
It will , we think , be seen from the following table , as well as from its graphical representation which accompanies it , that there is a fairly good agreement in phase between the two values of the Inequality so determined .

Results of Comparison of Inequalities around 24 Days .
15 .
Comparison in Length of Period.\#151 ; The comparative magnitudes of the various solar Inequalities , whether apparent or real , are , as we have already explained , estimated by adding together the various yearly results appropriately placed , and then in the final Inequality so obtained by summing up the various departures whether positive or negative .
The result for sun-spots is given in the form of a sum consisting of four or five places .
Of these we may to save space and time dismiss the two right hand figures , that is to say , divide by 100 , while yet retaining a result sufficiently accurate for the purposes of our comparison .
We have made this reduction in the following table not merely for sun-spots , but likewise for temperature-ranges .
It has to be remembered that for sun-spots and Toronto temperature-ranges the results exhibit the sum of 36 years , while for Kew temperature-ranges they only exhibit the sum of 24 years .
The Kew temperature-ranges are esteemed by us to be of subordinate value , partly because they consist of a smaller number of years , and partly because they have only 12 years in common with sun-spots , and they have been here introduced for a reason that will afterwards appear .
Meanwhile in our comparison as to length of period we confine ourselves to sunspots and Toronto temperature-range3 , inasmuch as each of these series embodies 36 years , of which 24 years are common to both .
In the following table we have enclosed in brackets the positions of all sufficiently well-defined maximum Inequalities , whether of sunspots or Toronto temperature-ranges .
We have likewise given a list of the Kew temperature-range Inequalities , but for the reason already mentioned we have not used these for the purpose of comparison , and have not enclosed their maximum points in brackets .
302 Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter .
It will be seen that on the whole the positions of maximum apparent Inequality for sun-spots are near those for Toronto temperature-ranges .
While this likeness cannot be considered as conclusively proving a connexion , it is nevertheless the sort of similarity which might be expected to exist between phenomena physically connected , but containing so many apparent Inequalities , and these so near together that our series of observations is not sufficiently extensive to enable us to eliminate their influence upon each other , or to allow us to ascertain their true positions .

Constancy of Type in the various Inequalities.\#151 ; It will be seen from Table III that as a rule the sun-spot Inequalities contain one maximum and one minimum in 24 days , and that as a rule the Kew temperature-range Inequalities contain likewise one maximum and one minimum , f while , however , the Toronto temperature-range Iu* The numbers in this table represent the aggregate Inequalities for 36 years in the sun-spot and Toronto temperature-range , and for 24 years in the Kew temperature-range , after dividing by 100 .
Thus the SS Inequality for \#151 ; 48 is in reality 9386 , while the TT and KT are 2744 and 6060 .
+ At any rate the Kew Inequalities much more nearly represent a single than a double oscillation .
Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
303 equalities contain distinctly two maxima and two minima .
There are doubtless solitary exceptions where the two former Inequalities exhibit two oscillations , and the latter an approach to a single oscillation only , but these are exceptions , and may we think fairly be supposed to be caused by the presence of some irregularity which we have not been able to eliminate .
We consider this constancy of type to be favourable to the view of a physical connexion between these phenomena .
The argument may , perhaps , be put in this way .
We are not entitled to expect in all cases terrestrial periods of one maximum and one fm'nimnm to correspond with solar periods of one maximum and one minimum , inasmuch as in another instance , namely , that of atmospheric pressure , we have two maxima and two minima more or less distinct for one solar day .
But we are entitled to expect , on the supposition that there is a physical connexion between the phenomena we are investigating , that they should exhibit a constancy of type .
This constancy is , therefore , a thing which we might expect on the supposition of a connexion , but a thing unlikely to occur on the supposition that there is no true connexion between these various Inequalities .
17 .
Comparison in Phase.\#151 ; Not only might we expect on the hypothesis of a physical connexion between them that there should be a constancy of type in these various phenomena , but we are furthermore entitled to look for a definite relation in phase between the corresponding celestial and terrestrial Inequalities .
A comparison in phase seems calculated to afford better evidence of a connexion than a comparison in length of period .
Referring for example to Table II , we find a well-marked maximum Inequality which occurs at +19 for sun-spots , and + 20 for Toronto temperature-ranges .
Had there been no other maximum than this , and had the sums rapidly fallen off on either side of this point , we should naturally have imagined that this nearness was a strong proof of a physical connexion , but there are evidently several apparent Inequalities , and these are somewhat close together .
Thus while there is a certain kind of evidence in the fact that for each sun-spot maximum Inequality we have a Toronto temperature-range Inequality not far distant , yet this evidence is rather derived from the circumstance that for each solar there is a terrestrial maximum than from the circumstance that these occur close together ; for if there be a sufficient number of such couplets they must occur close together .
It thus appears that viewed in this way the evidence of a connexion derived from nearness of period becomes the less striking the greater the number of periods .
The truth is that if there were only a single Inequality in each record a comparatively short series would enable us to detect a connexion , but if there are many Inequalities close 304 : Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter .
together , and if , moreover , not only the years of the series hut also the type of the Inequality be different in the two records , we should require a much longer series before we could so disentangle the influence of Inequalities upon each other as to point by this means unmistakably to a physical connexion .
The case is different , however , in a comparison of phase .
If we are able to show a nearly definite relation in phase between each couplet of these associated phenomena , then the greater the number of such couplets the greater will be the evidence .
Were there only a single Inequality we could have no evidence whatever of this kind , but if there be a good number of Inequalities in each couplet of which there is a constant relation in phase between the two members , the evidence of a connexion becomes very strong , because the likelihood that such a relation should constantly repeat itself without a physical connexion is extremely small .
Again , as a matter of fact , it is much more easy to alter slightly the position of a maximum than it is sensibly to affect the phase of the Inequality .
We have already mentioned in Art .
10 that we have only deemed it necessary to make separate and complete settings for every third of the small stages herein employed .
Now suppose that by such treatment we have a maximum at some point , say , for instance , \#151 ; 86 .
By employing the more laborious method of a complete setting for each small stage we might in some cases shift the position of such a maximum ( if only slightly in excess of its neighbours ) one or even two places , say to \#151 ; 37 or \#151 ; 38 , but we should not by this method of treatment materially alter the phase .
In fine , the comparison by periods is subject to greater uncertainty than the comparison by phases , inasmuch as while the maximum has been displaced by a slight difference of treatment , through two divisions , the phases for \#151 ; 36 , \#151 ; 37 , \#151 ; 38 ' by the old method are practically the same as those by the new .
We have already ( Art .
9 ) sufficiently indicated the method of dealing with an Inequality of one period so as to bring it to represent in phase one of a slightly different period .
In the above instance , therefore , we may imagine the true period of the Inequality to be \#151 ; 36 , or we may with equal propriety imagine it to be \#151 ; 38 ; in either case we shall have the same phase for our Inequality , provided that in the latter we reduce \#151 ; 38 so as to represent in phase the period \#151 ; 36 , or , in fine , bring both to one common period .
It thus becomes manifest what we ought to do .
We ought to reduce in phase the two members of a couplet to the same time-scale and then make our comparison .
It is possible that if the series of years had been precisely the same for the celestial and the terrestrial members of the couplet , and if both had presented only one oscillation in 24 days , we might have found a constancy of phase between Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
305 couplets of similar period even if these might be remote from a position of maximum Inequality .
But as it is we must confine ourselves to positions near some maximum in making our comparisons , and inasmuch as the Toronto temperature-range Inequalities presenting two fluctuations in 24 days are virtually short period Inequalities , we have preferred to take the positions of maximum Inequality from them rather than from the sun-spot records .
Thus , for instance , referring once more to Table II , we find a Toronto maximum at \#151 ; 33 , and a sun-spot maximum at \#151 ; 30 .
We have chosen \#151 ; 33 as our period , and have altered the solar maximum at \#151 ; 30 in phase so as to make it indicate \#151 ; 33 , and so on with other couplets .
Furthermore , in each case we take the mean of three series .
Thus in the instance now recorded we have taken the mean of sun-spots at \#151 ; 29 , \#151 ; 30 , and \#151 ; 31 all reduced to \#151 ; 33 , and have compared with this the mean of Toronto ranges at \#151 ; 34 , \#151 ; 33 , \#151 ; 32 all reduced to \#151 ; 33 likewise , and so on for other couplets .
Finally , in Table III , each series has been reduced so as to represent the sum of 12 years Inequalities , and the sun-spot *series have been equalised in the same way as the terrestrial observations , because in instituting any comparison with respect to magnitude it is desirable that the same treatment should have been applied to both .
In a previous part of our paper ( Art .
15 ) we spoke of a subsidiary service which was to be rendered by the Kew temperature-ranges .
We propose to regard these as terrestrial pointers or indicators by the aid of which we may distinguish the one Toronto maximum from the other .
It will be found that one of the Toronto maxima occurs in date about 8 or 9 days before the single maximum of the corresponding Kew Inequality .
This Toronto maximum , so indicated by a strictly terrestrial method , we have fixed upon as our starting point , and at this point all the Toronto Inequalities in Table ' III are made to begin .
The Toronto Inequalities thus placed are then compared with sun-spot and Kew temperature-range Inequalities of similar period , so arranged that the three members of the same triplet always start on the same day ; in other words , the numbers on the same horizontal line and belonging to the various members of the same triplet denote simultaneous phenomena .
In order to make this comparison it is necessary that the Inequalities compared together should be consistent with their prevalent type ; for instance , the Kew temperature-range Inequality must present a single maximum and minimum sufficiently well at least to admit of serving its office as a pointer .
In like manner the Toronto temperature-range must be a double , and the sun-spot a single Inequality .
We must , therefore , examine the couplets of Table II in order to see 306 Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter .
which of these are fitted to be subjects of comparison .

depart from their type in two , Toronto Inequalities in two , and Kew temperature Inequalities in two cases , leaving five unexceptionable triplets for comparison .
These are given in Table III ( p. 307 ) .
In the preceding table the settings have been arranged by strictly terrestrial considerations .
If , therefore , there is no connexion between terrestrial and solar Inequalities , the sun-spot maxima should he distributed impartially up and down the table without any other than chance grouping together .
Their behaviour is , however , very different from this , these maxima being comparatively closely grouped together about a position nine days later than that of the Toronto temperature-range maxima which begin the table .
The results of this table are exhibited in Diagram I which accompanies this paper .

18 .
The solar Inequalities around 26 days are remarkably large and well defined ; and , without attempting to prejudge the question Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
309 whether they are real or only apparent Inequalities , it may be interesting to exhibit in Table IV ( p. 308 ) the largest solar Inequality with which we have as yet come into contact .
The figures given | represent the sums of twelve yearly Inequalities , the whole 36 years being split into three series of 12 years each .
The amount of repetition will be seen from a comparison of these three series , which are exhibited , first , without any equalisation , and secondly , with the same amount of equalisation which has been applied to the terrestrial Inequalities around 26 days ( Art .
12 ) .
19 .
Comparison in Length of Period.\#151 ; The comparative magnitudes of the various solar Inequalities around 26 days are estimated after the manner already described\#151 ; that is to say , by adding together the various yearly results appropriately placed , and then in the final Inequality so obtained summing up the various ( 26 ) departures , whether positive or negative .
The two right hand figures are dismissed both for celestial and Table V.\#151 ; Apparent Inequalities around 26 Days .
( The numbers in this table represent the aggregate Inequalities for 36 years in the sun-spots and Toronto temperature-ranges , and for 24 years in the Kew temperature-ranges , the whole being divided by 100 .

terrestrial Inequalities as in the previous instance .
The series of years is the same , and the same use is made of the Kew temperature , ranges as in the Inequalities around 24 days .
In the Table Y ( p. 309 ) we have , enclosed in brackets , the positions of all sufficiently well-defined maximum Inequalities , whether of sun-spots or Toronto temperature-ranges .
It will be seen , as in the previous case , that the positions of maximum apparent Inequalities for sun-spots are near those for Toronto temperature-ranges ; and the same remarks are here applicable which have already been made .
20 .
Constancy of Type in the various Inequalities.\#151 ; Here , as in the Inequalities around 24 days , the Toronto temperature-ranges present on the whole two maxima and two minima , the sun-spots one well-defined maximum and minimum ; and the Kew temperature-ranges one maximum and minimum , not so well defined .
21 .
Comparison in Phase.\#151 ; For the purpose of making this com-parison , we proceed to discuss the various couplets of Table Y , taking as before the time-scales in our comparison from the Toronto temperature Inequalities rather than from the sun-spots.* SS\#151 ; 43 , TT_53 .
Toronto temperature-range Inequality not sufficiently near the type ; the others good .
* It will be desirable to exhibit the rejected Inequalities .
They are as follows , being the aggregate for 36 years in TT , and for 24 years in KT :\#151 ; Toronto temperature .

It thus appears that , out of eight cases , the sun-spots do not depart from their type in a single instance , while Toronto temperature-range Inequalities are too irregular to admit of comparison in three , and Kew temperature-range Inequalities in two cases , leaving four unexceptionable cases for comparison .
These are exhibited in Table VI and in Diagram II in a manner exactly similar to that in which the 24-day Inequalities were exhibited in Table III and in Diagram I. Also from Table VI we may draw conclusions exactly similar to those which we drew from Table III , the two tables exhibiting virtually the same behaviour of the various Inequalities .
Concluding Remarks .
22 .
We would remark , in the first place , that there are two possible kinds of periodicity with respect to sun-spots , and that it is not necessary to regard the Inequalities around 24 days and those around 26 days as perfectly similar phenomena .
To illustrate our meaning , let the reader imagine that some one definite hemisphere of the sun is in the habit of periodically losing its brilliancy and then becoming luminous again , while , however , the other hemisphere remains constant in its lustre .
We may imagine that , in the course of time , an inhabitant of the earth would view these phenomena from all possible quarters and in all possible phases , the result of which would be that , on an average , there would be a falling off in light corresponding to the tfmes of extinction , and no falling off corresponding to the times of maximum lustre .
We should , therefore , have what might be termed a solar Inequality of the first kind .
Next , suppose that the sun by rotation carries round this state of things , and thus brings next the earth the peculiar solar meridian which passes through the central point of the darkness .
Sometimes the earth would view this meridian at its blackest and sometimes at its brightest , but , on the whole , it would present an average lustre midway Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Temperature-Ranges .
313 between brightness and blackness .
On the other hand , the meridian on the opposite side of this would pass before the earth always bright .
There would thus be a period representing the synodical period of one solar rotation with respect to the earth , and this might be termed a solar Inequality of the second hind .
There seems some reason , from the observations of Broun and Horn-stein , to think that peculiar districts , if not a peculiar hemisphere , of the sun may be affected by spots in the way we have mentioned , the result of which would be that we should have amongst the Inequalities of sun-spots one representing the synodical period of revolution of the sun with respect to the earth .
Professor Stokes has likewise suggested the desirability of seeing whether there may not be such a period .
Now it seems to us that the proof in favour of such a period would not be invalidated by the occurrence of several periods around 26 days ; inasmuch as observations founded on sun-spots might present the same variety of period , when treated as we have treated them , which they presented when treated in another way by Carrington , who found that the spots in one solar latitude had a different period of rotation from those in another .
It seems , therefore , quite possible that the periods around 26 days may denote the synodical period with respect to the earth of certain spot-producing solar centres not far distant from the equatorial regions , where , according to Carrington and others , the rotation is quickest .
The Inequalities around 24 days have , however , too short a period to admit of the same interpretation being put upon them , inasmuch as they correspond more nearly with the time of rotation of the sun as regards a fixed point in space than with his time of rotation as regards the earth ; and here we come to a fact which is worthy of being recorded , although we cannot pretend to discuss it exhaustively in our present paper .
It is that the Inequalities around 26 days represent with much accuracy what would be the synodic periods with respect to the earth of the Inequalities around 24 days .
In other words , the two sets of Inequalities appear to be related to each other , as if the 24-day series represented in time not merely the period of a variable state of things , but likewise one revolution with regard to a fixed line of space ; while the second or 26-day series represents one revolution of the same phenomenon with respect to the earth regarded as the point of view .
This would seem to indicate , if confirmed by further inquiry , that the Inequalities around 24 days have reference to something without the sun , * inasmuch as we may imagine the maxima and the minima of the 24-day Inequalities to take place when certain districts of the sun come opposite certain fixed positions of space .
* This peculiar correspondence is perhaps best indicated by the Toronto Temperature-range observations which we think may offer the most trustworthy means of 314 Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter .
But while it is not certain that the sun-spot Inequalities around 26 days are phenomena precisely similar to those around 24 days , it would appear that the two sets of solar Inequalities are related to corresponding terrestrial Inequalities as nearly as possible in the same way , any small difference between Tables III and VI being as likely due to insufficient observations as to any physical cause .
We may now bring together the results we have obtained as follows :\#151 ; a. Sun-spot Inequalities around 24 and 26 days , whether apparent or real , seem to correspond closely in period with terrestrial Inequalities as exhibited by the daily temperature-range at Toronto and at Kew .
ft. While the sun-spot and the Kew temperature-range Inequalities present evidence of a single othe corresponding Toronto temperature-range Inequalities present evidence of a double oscillation .
7 .
Setting the Inequalities as we have done , the sun-spot maximum occurs about eight or nine days after one of the Toronto maxima , and the Kew maximum about seven days after the same Toronto maximum .
6 .
The proportional oscillation exhibited by the temperature-range Inequalities is much less than that exhibited by the corresponding solar Inequalities .
It must be borne in mind that the truth of a connexion between celestial and terrestrial phenomena can only be decided by cumulative evidence of various kinds .
What we claim to have here done is to have given reasons for supposing that there is a correspondence in time-scale and a definite relation in type and phase between sun-spot and temperature-range Inequalities , estimating periods with exactness .
If we slightly equalise the Inequalities of Tables II and Y by taking means of three , we obtain the following result : \#151 ; Chief prominences around 24 days .

315 and this so close and consistent , that the result cannot readily be attributed to mere chance .
But if not .
fortuitous , it tends to support the theory which maintains that there is a sensible relation between the state of the sun 's surface as evinced by spots and the meteorology I of the earth .
