] The phenomena which the author here endeavours to explain , he says , were first noticed by Prof. Robinson of Edinburgh , and published by Mr. Benjamin Martin in his Treatise on Iceland Crystal .
It would not be easy to describe the appearances without reference to the figures that accompany the paper .
The peculiar specimens of calcareous spar in which they occur , have been supposed to have fissures , with a disposition to split in the direction of the longer diagonal of the rhomboid .
But the author considers it as an interrupting stratum , since it appears to him not to bear the most remote resemblance to a fissure , but resembles a vein or film uniting the two prismatic portions of a rhomboid .
Neither are the phenomena produced , when two surfaces artificially polished in the direction of the supposed plane are applied to each other ; but they are produced when a thin film of sulphate of lime is interposed as a vein between two such portions of Iceland spar , and the surfaces are closely united by a cement of strong refractive power .
The supposition of such a crystallized vein , serves also to explain the varieties observable in the characters of the phenomena in different instances , which must vary according to the thickness of the vein , and according to the position of its polarizing axis .
The author also describes certain new instruments for exhibiting complementary colours produced by polarized light ; but the descriptions require the aid of his figures to render them intelligible .
