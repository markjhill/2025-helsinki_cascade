27J-Z/ T For practical purposes these equations are really sufficient .
We see firstly that the transformer transforms the potential in the ratio n/ m , and adds to the external resistance of the secondary circuit p a resistance ( w2R/ m2)+r .
This at once gives us the variation of potential caused by varying the number of lamps used .
The phase of the secondary current is exactly opposite to that of the primary .
In designing a transformer it is particularly necessary to take note of equation ( 9 ) , for the assumption is that a is limited so that lx may be neglected .
The greatest value of a is B/ { ( 27r/ T)mA } , and this must not exceed a chosen value .
We observe that B varies as the number of reversals of the primary current per unit of time .
But this first approximation , though enough for practical work , gives no account of what happens when transformers are worked so that the iron is nearly saturated , or how energy is wasted in the iron core by the continual reversal of its magnetism .
The amount of such waste is easily estimated from Ewing 's results when the extreme value of a is known , but it is more instructive to proceed to a second approximation , and see how the magnetic properties of the iron affect the value and phase of x and y. We shall as a second approximation substitute in equations ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) values of x deduced from the value of a furnished by the first approximation in equation ( 9 ) .
In the accompanying diagram Ox represents a , 0 represents a , and Oz the time t. The curves ABCD represent the relations of a and a. EFGr the induction a as a function of the time , and HIK the deduced relation between xand t. We may substitute the values of a obtained Dr. J. Hopkinson .
[ Mar. 10 , Fig. l. from this curve in equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , and so obtain the values of x and yto a higher degree of approximation .
If the values of a were expressed by Fourier 's theorem in terms of the time , we should find that the action of the iron core introduced into the expression for x and y , in addition to a term in cos ( 27rf/ T ) which would occur if a and a , were proportional , terms in sin and terms in sines and cosines of multiples of 27rt/ T. It is through the term in sin ( 2i7rt/ T ) that the loss of energy by hysteresis comes in .
A particular case , in which to stay at a first approximation would be very misleading , is worthy of note .
Let an attempt be made to ascertain the highest possible values of a by using upon a transformer a very large primary current , and measuring the consequent mean square of potential in the secondary circuit by means of an electrometer , by the heating of a conductor , or other such device .
The value of a will be related to the time somewhat as indicated by ABCDEFG in fig. 2 ; for simplicity assume it be as in fig. 3 ; the Fig. 2 .

resulting relations of potential in the secondary and the time will be indicated by the dotted line HIJKOLMNPQ .
The mean square observed will be proportional to ML.v/ LP ; but ML .
LPis proportional to EL , hence the potential observed will vary inversely as .v/ BP , even though the maximum induction remain constant .
If then the maximum induction be deduced on the assumption that the induction is a simple harmonic function of the time , results may readily be obtained vastly in excess of the truth .

" Note on the Theory of the Alternate Current Dynamo .
" By John Hopkinson , M.A. , D.Sc .
, F.R.S. Received February 17 , 1887 .
According to the accepted theory of the alternate current dynamo , the equation of electric current in the armature is yy + Ry = periodic function of t , where 7 is a constant coefficient of self-induction .
This equation is not strictly true , inasmuch as 7 is riot in general constant , * but it is a most useful approximation .
My present purpose is to indicate how the values of 7 and of the periodic function representing the electromotive force can be calculated in a machine of given configuration .
To fix ideas , we will suppose the machine considered to have its magnet cores arranged parallel to the axis of rotation , that the cores are of uniform section , also that the armature bobbins have iron cores , so that we regard all the lines of induction as passing either through an armature coil , or else between adjacent poles entirely outside the armature .
The sketch shows a development of the machine considered .
The iron is supposed to be so arranged that the currents * " On the Theory of Alternating Currents , " ' Telegr .
