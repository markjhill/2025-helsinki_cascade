" Observations on the Teredo navalis and Limnoria terebrans , as at present existing in certain localities of the British Islands .
" By William Thompson , Esq. , Vice-President of the Natural History Society of Belfast .
Communicated by J. G. Children , Esq. Sec. R.S. The opinion which has been advanced , that the Teredo navalis is no longer to be found on the British coast , is shown by the author to be erroneous ; for numerous specimens of that destructive animal , collected from the piles used in the formation of the pier at Portpatrick in Ayrshire , were furnished to him by Captain Frayer , R.N. ( of His Majesty 's Steam-packet Spitfire ) .
Some of these specimens had attained the length of nearly two feet and a half , a magnitude at least equal to , if not exceeding , the largest brought from the Indian seas .
After giving a description of the animal , the author enters into an inquiry into the agency it employs to perforate the timber which it consumes as food , and in which it establishes its habitation .
He ascribes to the action of a solvent , applied by the proboscis , the smooth and rounded termination of its cell , which is afterwards enlarged by the mechanical action of the primary valves .
The author then gives an account of the natural history and operations of another animal , the Limnoria tcrebrans , of Leach , belong ?
ing to the class of Crustacea , whose depredations on timber are no less extensive and formidable than the Teredo .
At Portpatrick it appears that both these animals have combined their forces in the work of destruction , the Teredo consumir.g the interior , and the Limnoria the superficial parts of the wood ; the latter continuing its labours until it comes in contact with the shells of the former , so that the whole mass is speedily deprived of cohesion .
It is stated , on the authorities of Mr. Hyndman and Mr. Stephen , that the Limnoria is al ?
ready committing great ravages in the timber at Donaghadee .
