The following results were obtained at King 's College , Strand , for a specimen of very pure iron .
The experiments were made under the direction of Dr. Hopkinson .
The sample was supplied to him by Sir Frederick Abel , K.C.B. , F.R.S. , to whom it was sent by Colonel Dyer , of the Elswick Works .
It is of almost pure iron , and the substances other than iron are stated to be :\#151 ; Carbon .
Silicon .
Phosphorus .
Sulphur .
Manganese .

0013 01 The method of experiment is the same as that described in Dr. Hopkinson 's paper before this Society on the " Magnetisation of Iron at High Temperatures , " viz. , taking a curve of induction at the* temperature of the atmosphere , and then at increasing temperatures until the critical point is reached .
The temperatures , as in his paper , , are calculated from the resistances of the secondary winding , the increase of resistance per 1 ' C. being assumed to be 000388 of the resistance at 20 ' C. In brackets are also given the temperatures c alculated by Benoit 's formula\#151 ; Resistance at t ' C. = resistance at 0'C .
{ 1 +0'00367tf + 0'000000587f2}.* The dimensions of the iron ring are\#151 ; as in the earlier experiments .
Fig. 1 gives the curve of induction taken at 10O-5 C. compared with the sample of wrought iron of Dr. Hopkinson 's paper , just referred to , taken at 8''5 C. It shows the very high induction developed in the pure specimen for a moderate magnetising force , and also the small amount of hysteresis .
The following are the actual values of induction , B , and magnetising force , H :\#151 ; * Everett 's 'C.G.S .

Fig. 6 shows the rise of permeability in relation to temperature when H = 0-3 , the maximum permeability observed being 11,100 for a magnetising force of 03 , and at a temperature of 855 ' C. ( 857 ' ) .
Fig. 7 contrasts the relation of induction to temperature at a small and a larger magnetising force .
During the heating of the specimen , the critical point , when the iron suddenly became non-magnetic , was reached at 874 ' 0 .
( 875 ' ) , and on cooling it became magnetic at 835 ' C. ( 838 ' ) .
Comparing these results with those obtained with the more ordinary specimens of iron mentioned in Dr. Hopkinson 's paper , we have here 874 ' C. as against 786 ' C. , while in an experiment on some soft iron wire the critical temperature was 880 ' C. , and for hard pianoforte wire it was 838 ' C.
