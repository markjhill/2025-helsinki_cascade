THE PRESIDENT in the Chair .
The Right Hon. Lord Justice Sir Edward Fry , whose certificate I had been suspended as required by .the Statutes , was balloted for and elected a Fellow of the Society , The Presents received were laid on the table , and thanks ordered for them .
The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " Note on a Series of Barometrical Disturbances which passed over Europe between the 27th and the 31st of August , 1883 .
" By Robert H. Scott , F.R.S. , Secretary to the Meteorological Council .
Communicated by desire of the Council .
Received December 4 , 1883 .
Plate 1 .
The occurrence of sudden temporary derangements of atmospheric pressure has been occasionally noticed at all observatories provided with barographs , either mechanical or photographic .
Among the most remarkable of these which have been recorded in these islands have been that of January 16 , 1869 , which appeared at Aberdeen , and to a less extent at Glasgow , and that of January -30 , 1876 , which was noticed chiefly at Armagh and Aberdeen , and was described by me in a note published by the Meteorological Society ( " Quarterly Journal , " vol. iv , p. 73 ) .
In both of these cases the depression of the barometrical column amounted to about 0'1 inch , and the duration of the entire disturbance to about ten minutes .
In both cases the anemometers showed sudden disturbances both in the direction and force of the wind , and on the latter occasion certainly a shower fell .
In 1869 no self-recording rain-gauges existed .
It is evident that both of these disturbances were due to the passage of squalls .
The phenomena which I have now to notice are very .remarkable , inasmuch as they are not accompanied by any traceable disturbance of any other element than pressure , and they appear as clearly at Coimbra and St. Petersburg as at our own observatories .
The broad facts to be recorded are that at the end of August a violent volcanic eruption took place in ..the Straits of Sunda ( in 105 ' Mr. R. H. Scott .
[ Dec. 13 , i east longitude ) .
The continuance of the shocks is given at from 4 p.m. on the 26th to daybreak on the 27th , corresponding to the interval from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on the 26th , Greenwich time ; but they probably continued for a longer period .
No precise statement as to the moment of occurrence of any particular explosion or shock has as yet been printed .
Two letters have been received at the Meteorological Office from the Board of Trade , one from Her Majesty 's Consul at Batavia , and the other an extract from the log of the Dutch steam ship " Governor-General Loudon , " which ship was in Sunda Straits at the time of the eruption , having called at Anjer the day before it took place , and again after the place had been swept by the earthquake sea-wave .
Neither of these accounts contains any precise statement as to time of any particular phenomenon .
The facts which I have to bring to the notice of the Society are the indications of successive disturbances of the barometer occurring also at the end of August , at regular intervals and at every observatory in Europe .
I shall distinguish the four disturbances shown on the engraving by Roman numerals .
Greenwich time is used .
I. At about 11 h. a.m. on the 27th , a sudden increase of pressure , followed by a decrease , appeared at St. Petersburg , and a similar phenomenon was noticed at Valencia Island , and at Coimbra in Portugal , as well as at all the intermediate observatories over Europe from which we have been able to obtain tracings of barograms .
The character of the disturbance was hot strictly identical , for at the western stations the rise of the barometer was more marked than at the eastern .
The general appearance of the barograms at adjacent stations is strikingly similar .
It is , however , difficult to select any peculiarly remarkable phase of the disturbance so as to recognise it and record the time of its occurrence at each observatory .
This movement ( I ) was propagated from east to west at a very high velocity , for the recovery of pressure from the first decrease occurred at St. Petersburg at noon , and at Valencia at 2 h. 25 m. p.m. on the same day , thus taking only two hours and twenty-five minutes to traverse the distance of 1,315 miles between the two observatories .
II .
A somewhat similar disturbance appeared on the 28th , but was propagated from west to east , reaching Valencia at 3h .
20 m. a.m. , and St. Petersburg at 5 h. 15 m. a.m. , and thus requiring only one hour and fifty-five minutes for its passage .
The same uncertainty as to identification of the phase exists in this case as in the preceding .
In all cases , however , the most marked phase of the phenomenon has been noted .

20 m. a.m. on the 29th , and Valencia at 2 h. 28 m. a.m. on the same day , and traversing the distance in two hours and eight minutes .

35 m. p.m. , and occupying only one hour and twenty-five minutes in passage .
Similar disturbances , though of a gradually diminishing intensity , can be traced in most of the barograms , occurring at Valencia at about 3 h. p.m. on the 30th and 2 h. a.m. on the 31st .
After this time the traces of disturbance become less distinctly recognisable .
Some of the oscillations are more marked at some stations than at others ; the-Scotch observatories , in particular , exhibit the later disturbances very distinctly .
The engraving , which has been prepared in the Meteorological Office , and which shows all the records reduced to the same scale and to Greenwich time , exhibits the barograms at the following stations , which are enumerated in order of longitude , going from east to west:\#151 ; St. Petersburg .

Barometrical Disturbances .
143 exhibits considerable similarity to that of the King 's barograph at the Liverpool Observatory , at the Waterloo Docks Pierhead on the 15th of January , 1864 , when the " Lottie Sleigh , " loaded with about twelve tons of gunpowder , blew up .
The ship was lying about three miles from the Observatory .
I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Hartnup for a tracing of this interesting curve .
In this preliminary note I can only say that until copies of the barograms from extra-European stations , such as New Zealand , the Havana , and Calcutta , are received , it is impossible to see whether the phenomena so marked in their occurrence in Europe have manifested themselves elsewhere ; at Toronto they appear to have been recorded .
On that subject I shall hope to lay a future communication before the Society .
II .
Note on the foregoing Paper .
By Lieutenant-General R. Strachey , F.R.S. Received December 12 , 1883 .
The obvious correspondence of the forms and times of occurrence of the barometric disturbances , described in Mr. Scott 's paper , at once suggested that they were due to a common origin , and the great volcanic eruption at Krakatoa in the Straits of Sunda appeared to supply a probable efficient cause .
Any shock of sufficient violence might be expected to produce an atmospheric wave , advancing from the place where it was caused in a circular form round the globe , at first expanding until it had got half round the earth , and then again contracting till it was again concentrated at the antipodes , from which again it would be thrown , back , and so pass backwards and forwards till it was obliterated .
It might also have been expected that such a wave would travel with the velocity of sound , being probably of the same nature as that which causes sound , though the vibrations had not the peculiar character that affects our organs of hearing .
It ha\#174 ; , however , been suggested to me that the wave may rather have had the character of a solitary wave produced in a liquid , the velocity of which in the air would not materially differ from that of sound .
A rough examination of the facts at first made known by the observations recorded in Great Britain indicated that 4here was j strong evidence in support of this view , and that the phenomena would be approximately .explained by the passage round the earth of a series of waves travelling at the rate of about 700 miles an hour in opposite directions from the place where the volcanic eruption occurred .
The records since procured from other places , and the more careful examination of the facts , has quite confirmed this conclusion .
Although we may expect to obtain additional data from other parts
