I. " Oni Supra-annual Cycles of Temperature in the Earth 's Surfacecrust .
" By Prof. C. PIAZZI SMYTH , F.R.S. Received March 4 , 1870 .
( Abstract .
) The author presents and discusses the completely reduced observations , from 1837 to 1869 inclusive , of the four great cartll-thermolmeters sunk into the rock of the Calton H1ill , at the Royal Observatory , IlEdinburlgh , by the late Principal Forbes , pursuant to a vote by the British Association for the Advancement of Science .
Leaving on one side the several natural-philosophy data which have been investigated from smaller portions of the same series of observations both by Principal Forbes and Sir W'Villiam Thomlson , the au-thor applies himself solely to trace the existence of other cycles than the ordinary annual one , in the rise anl fall of the different thermnsometers .
Of such cycles , and of more than one year 's duration , he considers that he has discovered three ; and of these the most marked has a period of 11l years , or practically the same as Schwabe 's numbers for new groups of solar spots .
Several numerical circumstances , however , which the author details , show that the sun-spots cannot be the actual cause of the observed W aes of terrestrial temperature , and he sugSgests what may be , concluding with two examples of the practictal use to which a knowledge of the temperature cycles as observed may at once be turned , no matter to what cosiical origin their existence may be owing .
