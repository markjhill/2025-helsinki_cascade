On the measurement .
of Snowdon , by the Thermometrical Barometer .
By the Rev. F. J. H. WOLLASTON , B.D. F.R.S. Read June 29 , 182o .
THE Royal Society did me the honour to notice in their Transactions , 1817 , p. 183 , the description of a Thermometrical Barometer , by which it was conceived that accessible heights might with convenience be measured ; and may therefore not be uninterested by the account of an actual measurement made with it .
Having occasion last summer to visit Carnarvon , which would afford an opportunity of trying the instrument on the known height of Snowdon , and being aware that in 3550 feet the variations of the boiling temperature were not to be considered uniform , as they might in small elevations , on which alone I had before tried the experiment , I wished to provide myself previously with a table for making the necessary corrections ; and from Dr. URE'S paper , Philosophical Transactions , 1818 , p. 338 , was supplied with data for the calculation .
The law , which he discovers by approximation and lays down , is this : that , the elastic force of the air , or length of the column of mercury in the barometer being supposed go inches when water boils at 212o of Fahrenheit , -30 will be the length of the column 1,23 at 2o2o ; 230X -2 the length at 19g ?
; and so on progressively , adding another increased divisor for every 10 ?
of thermometrical temperature .
For my purpose it was necessary to calculate the variations at smaller intervals than ten degrees , and particularly to obtain those between 212 ?
and o202 , by getting a series of divisors for each degree , instead of the simple divisor of 1,23 for the whole .
By taking the tenth of the logarithm of 1,23 , the uniform divisor appears to be 1 , o01 ; but to make the successive divisors increase at the lower temperatures , as Dr. UR does , suppose them to be taken thus ; 1,02059 1 , o2o68 1,02077 1 , o0o86 1,02095 1,02105 1,021144 1,02123 I,02 132 1,02141 10,21000 The mean of which is 1.o21 .
The logarithms of these divisors , if their differences be equalised by a small change in the last figure , will stand thus : 88501 88892 89282 89673 90063 90454 90844 91234 91625 92105 the sum of these logarithms being 0,902583 , the logarithm of 1,2g nearly .
s96 By the use of these logarithms , the series of barometrical heights corresponding with each degree of Fahrenheit , calculated from o3 inches at 212 ?
, downward to 202 ?
, and carried upward to 214 ?
, will be found in the following Table I. in the fifth column of which the difference of the logarithms of the barometric column , which corresponds by a known law with the number of fathoms of elevation , is multiplied by 6 , to give the feet of elevation which produces the successive depression of the boiling point one degree of Fahrenheit ; and the 6th column gives the total elevation , reckoning from the station where water boils at 212 ?
, to any other station where the boiling temperature is at any degree between 202 ?
and 2t4 ? .
For the differences between each degree , the elevations may be taken with sufficient accuracy by simple proportion .

Cw~~~~~~~~~ : ~ Ink the application of this table to use , it must be adapted to the scale of the particular thermometrical barometer employed .
In my former paper , I observed that a change of 1 ?
Fahrenheit appeared to be produced by 0,589 of the common barometer .
This was deduced from the comparison of my long thermometer of 3,98 inches to every degree with a common barometer .
But having subsequently compared the same thermometer with a mountain barometer by TROUGHTON , where I could ascertain the adjustment for the height of the mercury in the basin , I found that at a mean of 29,5 inches , 0,603 of barometer corrected was equal to i* of Fahrenheit .
This conclusion agrees very closely with the table deduced from Dr. URE'S observations , in which between 21l0 and 2t* , the difference of the mercurial column is 0,605 nearly at the mean height of 29,7 , and would be rather less at 29,5 .
On the scale of the instrument which I have now in use , the half inch is divided into ten parts , and by the Vernier into a hundred ; the inch , therefore , into two -hundred ; and I find by observation , that 1 , ooo of the corrected barometer equals 372 parts on the scale of the thermometrical barometer , or 1,86 inch ; consequently , o,605 barometer or 1 ?
Fahrenheit , = 225 parts on the scale , or 18 inch , which is a sensibility entirely sufficient .
And those ee5 parts being supposed , according to Table I , =531 feet between 2110 and 2e1 , 1oo parts will equal 236 feet at that part of the scale .
Between o22 ?
and o03 ?
, 225 parts 552 feet , and , consequently , ioo parts-= 246 feet nearly ; and so of every other point ; and the following table of heights , corresponding with the scale of my instrument , will be found in the nearest whole numbers , 398 TABLE II .

As the instrument I was about to employ had a scale of only four inches , or 800 parts , and could therefore scarcely I I7i iIIi4i 1E'\,._Et .
measure at its utmost limits 1900 feet , it was necessary , on a height of 3550 feet , to divide the whole measurement into two , or , for greater security , into three lengths , and it became therefore a fair trial of the practical use of the instrument in every respect .
On the 24th of August , having occasion to ride from Carnarvon to Gregory 's New Inn , near Llanberis Lake , at the foot of Snowdon , for the purpose of securing accommodations for my party , I took the instrument in my pocket , having previously boiled it on the ground floor of the Vicar .

The descent from the Vicarage to the north end of Carnarvon quay , was taken by levelling , and found 11,25 feet .
August 27 .
The instrument had been set at Gregory 's at 768 , before the party began to ascend the hill ; but when we came to the place wliere the guide supposed we had ascended half way , it stood at about 3oo , showing that we had not gone far enough to take the whole in two lengths of the scale ; and we therefore proceeded farther , to a point , opposite a pass in the ridge of Snowdon , called Bwlch Cymbrw .
nog , by which the hill is ascended from Nant .
In carrying the instrument incautiously from the former point while cooling , the mercury was drawn into the tube from the cap at the top , and the previous measure from Gregory 's was therefore lost .
I mention this , to show how the measure was afterwards recovered on descending .
At this point which I call H , the half height , the thermometrical barometer was set at 792 , in the manner directed in my former paper ; thermometer 62 ? .
When boiled again on the summit it stood at 86 , thermometer 66 ? .
On descending again to H , it boiled at 785 , thermometer 63 ? .
From this point , my measurement to Gregory 's downward , was to be made for recovering the accidental loss in the ascent ; and for that purpose an operation was to be performed on the instrument , by no means so easy as that for taking a succeeding stage upward ; for the mercury must in this case be expanded out of the tube into the cap over the flame of the lamp , until on boiling , it stands as near as may be requisite to the bottom of the scale .
This was done at H , and the water boiled at 146 , thermometer 63 ? .
On carrying it down to the Inn it stood at 695 , thermometer 65 ? .
The barometer observed at Carnarvon about the time of boiling at H , on ascending , was at 29,91 ; and at the time of boiling there the second time , it stood at 29,88 , where I found it on my return to Carnarvon .
Between Gregory 's and H , the difference 695 -146 -549 , mean thermometer 64 ?
, barometer 29,9 .
Between H and the* summit , the difference ( from the mean of the two observations at H ?
92t75= ) 788,5 86 =8 702,5 , mean thermometer 64 ? .
The mean thermometer being the same in both lengths , they may be calculated together , the total being 549 + 7 ?
02,5 1 e1,5 , thermometer 64 , .
The barometer being at 29,9 , I begin from the corresponding point on Table II , and take out izo5 parts between 50 and I300 -300-I I18 2982 15 3 , 1251,5 parts , giving the approximate height 2985,5 feet .
to this add the correction from Table 1 , 0,0837 X 2985,5 = 250,0 the corrected height from Gregory 's to the summit 3235,5 feet .
from Vicarage to Gregory 's 299,5 from Quay to Vicarage 1 , z25 Total from north end of Quay to summit 3546,25 feet .
General Roy 's measurement trigonometrically makes it 3555,4 feet , and barometrically 3548,9 feet .
During the same visit to Carnarvon , I took the opportunity of trying the instrument on Moel Elio , which stands between that place and Snowdon , and has also been measured by General ROY .
On September 6 , at the Vicarage , the thermometrical barometer stood at 737 , thermometer 59 ?
, barometer 29,8 .
In the blacksmith 's shop at Waen Fawr , at the foot of Moel Elio , water boiled at 550 , thermometer 57 ? .
The instrument was here set to 767 , and carried to the summit , where by the pile of stones it stood at 25 , thermometer 52 ? .

General RoY 's measurement trigonometrically makes it 271 ifeet ; barometrically 2391,8 feet .
The three measurements in this instance , do not agree so well as at Snowdon : wlether this arises in any degree from the different forms of the two mountains , rendering the point of observation less definite in the one case , I will not pretend to say ; Snowdon terminates in a point , Moel Elio has a large bare summit .
To save the trouble of reference to General RoY 's Paper , Philosophical Transactions , 1777 , p. 771 , I give here from that Paper , a part of the Table for correction on account of the expansion of the column of air between two stations at different temperatures , in thousandth parts of an observed height .

The thermometer itself is straight , and carried up the middle of the scale .
The index moves by hand on a square rod on one side of the glass tube , with an adjustment by a screw at the top .
The vernier is applied to the edge of the scale .
I recommend that in making these thermometers , the bulb be blown on a piece of tube of inch bore , or nearly , so that the mercury expanded before boiling may be wholly contained in that tube without requiring an upper bulb ; for if that bulb be made of a size to allow the mercury to separate in it , a globule may lodge in the upper part of it near the fine thread , and be attended with much inconvenience .
To protect the lamp from wind more effectually than was done by the small tent-stand formerly described , I have made the outside case of thin copper , hard soldered , so as to serve as a lanthorn to contain the lamp burning at bottom ; while the boiler , which is made of a drawn tube , with the thermometer , slips down from above , and is also protected from the cold air during the experiment .
The inverted boiler screws as before , over the scale of the thermometer , and packs in the centre of the case for carriage , the bulb of the thermometer going downwards into the chimney of the lamp ; round the chimney in the lower part of the case , is space sufficient for stowing some matches of the oxymuriate of potash , a bottle of sulphuric acid , a wax candle , a tin bottle of water , a pair of scissors for trimming the lamp , a turnscrew and thermometer .
In the upper part is also room for some tow or rag for cleaning , &amp;c. ; and the whole , when packed for use , weighs two pounds .
Still farther to be guarded against wind , if necessary , I carried , as a walkingstick , a rod cut into three , and jointed at top , which belongs to a theodolite as its stand ; and had in my pocket a conical bag of thin cotton , which would cover the whole as a tent , and might be pegged down to the ground if occasion required .
This precaution , though it had been needless/ on Snowdon , was of use on Moel Elio , where I had a very high wind .
The tent has of course an opening on one side , where the instrument , which hangs from a hook in the centre , is accessible .
