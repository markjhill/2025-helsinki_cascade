On the Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis .
477 They note that this inflammatory reaction at times failed to occur , and in this our results agree .
The conclusion at which the observers named arrive is that the subcutaneous tissues of the guinea-pig are peculiarly sensitive to adrenal grafts , which produce in them oedema and haemorrhagic solution .
It is difficult , however , to eliminate here the possibility that the results are due to auto-bacterial infection .
The organs of normal guinea-pigs abound in various forms of bacteria , the growth of which is inhibited under natural conditions .
When necrosis is set up by the adrenal graft or by the injection of an extract , the dead tissues furnish a nidus in which the latent pathogenic micro-organisms may grow .

479 It will be noticed that nine of the above rats lived for over 200 days , and nine others considerably over 100 days .
.Of those which have died only four have had recurrences ( two had one , and two had three recurrences ) ; none of them died with any symptoms of trypanosomiasis , and in none were trypanosomes found after death .
An emulsion of the liver and of the bone-marrow of Nos. 9 , 16 , 17 , 21 , and 25 was injected into other rats with negative results in every case .
Rats treated with equal parts of 1 per cent. Solutions of Sodium Antimonyl Tartrate and Sodium Arsenyl Tartrate .
The five rats living at the date of the last paper have died :\#151 ; No. 1 died on the 199th day after inoculation .
As was anticipated from the earlier experiments , this treatment has no advantages over that with antimony alone .
This was tried in doses up to 7 minims of a 1 per cent , solution .
In this dose it was poisonous to rats , and it did not kill the trypanosomes .
This was given in doses of 5\#151 ; 7 minims of a 5 per cent , solution of atoxyl and of a 1 per cent , solution of sodium antimonyl tartrate .
Three Nagana rats lived respectively .23 , 43 , and 41 days ; they all had recurrences ( the last had five ) and died with living trypanosomes in the blood .
Pushing the drug does not have any good effect ( see next table ) ; the trypanosomes are not driven out more quickly , or more effectually ; recurrences are more common , and inflammatory intestinal lesions were present in nearly every case .
Two rats died with living trypanosomes in the blood : these two had become antimony-proof , as the later doses did not remove the trypanosomes from the blood , nor make any difference in their number .
This strain did not maintain this quality for long , as after the second sub-inoculation from these rats the trypanosomes seemed to have become normal in their behaviour towards antimony .
The strain was lost at this point .

] On the Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis .
481 Mats treated with Antimony ( Metal ) and Sodium Antimonyl Tartrate suspended in a Fatty Medium .
Sodium antimonyl tartrate , when injected in watery solution into man produces very severe pain and inflammation in the neighbourhood of the injection , with more or less local necrosis .
In order to make the use of antimony practicable in the form of injection , a series of experiments was undertaken , using various other media than water for solution or suspension of the antimony salt .
Lanolin , olive oil , and sesamum oil were tried , but the results were not good .
Finally , the medium Colonel Lambkin devised , * consisting of palmitin and antiseptics , which is used very largely for the intramuscular injection of calomel and mercury in syphilis , was tried , with the results which are set forth in the tables below .
One great advantage of these preparations is that they can be used upon man with far less difficulties and after-consequences than the watery solutions , which seem to be impracticable ; this is of importance should antimony be found of use in human trypanosomiasis .
Major Ward , R.A.M.C. , has used both the forms mentioned above on men for other purposes , and he has very kindly placed his notes at our disposal .
In one of his cases four doses of \ grain of sodium antimonyl tartrate , suspended in Colonel Lambkin 's medium , were given intramuscularly into the buttock , the intervals between the doses being 3 , 4 , and 3 days : the doses were then increased to 1 grain , and seven doses of this strength were given , the intervals being 4 , 3 , 2 , 4 , 2 , and 13 days .
In all , this patient had 9 grains of the salt .
Major Ward says that " the injections caused a certain amount of tenderness and discomfort at the seat of injection , " but that is very different to the effects noticed after the injection of the watery solution . . . . .
Major Ward also treated two patients with antimony itself in a state of extremely fine division suspended in Colonel Lambkin 's medium ; they were each given one dose of 1 grain , and 11 days afterwards grain .
This form caused both pain and discomfort , and also a general increase in the size of the buttock , into which the injection was made , but this subsided without suppuration .
This form would appear , however , to be much the more powerful of the two , as the effects obtained from the 1-^ grains of the metal were as good and as lasting as those observed in the case in which 9 grains of sodium antimonyl tartrate were given .
The following tables show the results obtained in rats with sodium antimonyl tartrate and antimony prepared as mentioned above :\#151 ; .

None of the above have died from trypanosomiasis .
In rats the intramuscular injection of even a few minims is difficult , and if any of the material he left under the skin a slough forms , which takes a long time to heal .
It will be noticed that No. 3 had only one dose : the rat lived 113 days and died of pneumonia ; inoculations made from its organs were negative .
No. 13 , which is still living ( 154 days ) , has also had only one dose .
From the following table it will be seen that the administration of the metal itself has a considerable effect on the trypanosomes : it has a distinctly better effect on Surra than upon Nagana , four Surra rats out of 16 being still alive , and four others having lived for a long time .
In none of the Surra rats were trypanosomes found at death , whereas in three of the Nagana rats .they were present .
The metal is much more irritating than the tartrate , but the effect is in most cases more prolonged ; this is probably due to the fact that the absorption of the metal is much slower .
Further , the smaller .doses would appear to be the most efficient .

25 , Experiments in which Antimony and Sodium Antimonyl Tartrate were given before Inoculation , in order to Test their Effects upon the Development of the Disease .
In these experiments the substances were given suspended in Colonel Lambkin 's medium , and it will be noticed that the metal is far more effective in delaying the appearance of the trypanosomes in the blood than is the salt : this is probably due to the slower elimination of the metal .
This method , if the doses were repeated , might be of some practical value in getting animals safely across dangerous tracts of country .
Four Bats were given 5 minims of 5 per cent. Antimony ( metal ) Cream on December 19 .

Rats treated with Lithium Antimonyl Tartrate .
There are differences in the effects produced by the potassium , sodium , and lithium antimonyl tartrates , if given under similar conditions and dosage .
The commercial potassium salt is very impure .
The pure sodium and lithium salts which we have used have been prepared for us by Dr. B. H. Aders Plimmer , of University College .
The sodium salt contains roughly about 2 per cent , more antimony than the potassium salt , and the lithium salt contains about 2 per cent , more antimony than the sodium ; but the doses of the lithium salt have to be much smaller than 1908 .
] On the Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis .
485 the corresponding doses of the sodium salt .
For instance , 0*5 e.c. of a 1 per cent , solution of the lithium salt is fatal to a rat of 125 grammes , and 0'39 c.c. is fatal to a rat of 80 grammes .
When the watery solution is injected intramuscularly , it has not caused necrosis of the tissues in rats , - but subgutaneously it has occasionally done so .
We have found that the best strength of solution for rats is 0*25 per cent. , and of this 0'5 c.c. has been given for a dose .
The following table shows the effects of this dosage .

From the above it will be seen that five out of these 12 rats are alive and well at periods varying from 125 to 134 days .
This salt is much more soluble than either the potassium or sodium compound , which may , perhaps , as well as its greater antimony content , account for its greater effectiveness .
It is , however , more irritating subcutaneously in watery solution .
: : 3 1 Experiments with Antimony upon Dogs .
In order to see what the effects of antimony would be on the larger and !
more important animals when suffering from trypanosomiasis , a series of experiments on dogs has been begun .
The trypanosome used was that of Surra , which kills dogs of about 20 lbs. in weight in approximately 14 days , as this is the trypanosome which is of practical importance with regard to dogs .
Dr. MacConkey , of the Lister Institute , kindly performed some initial experiments for us .
He made some experiments with a 20 per cent. 486 Mr. H. G. Pliminer and Ca'pt , H. P. Bateman .
[ Aug. 25 , suspension of sodium antimony tartrate in Col. Lambkin 's medium , in order to find the minimum lethal dose , and he found that 0'5 c.c. of this 20 per cent , eream per 10 lbs. of body weight was probably about the full dose .
But he also found that , for practical purposes , this 20 per cent , cream was much too strong , as it caused sloughing in every case ; indeed , dogs do not seem to bear these suspensions as well as they do solutions .
Dr. MacConkey kept one dog alive till the 40th day , and one until the 30th , but both had many relapses .
- Profiting by the experience thus gained , we have made further experiments using much smaller doses , with satisfactory results .
But we have found , since trying the lithium antimonyl tartrate that this acts more effectually and with less irritation than the creams , whether of metal or salt .
All the animals tabulated below are in good condition and are gaining in weight .

] On the Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis .
487 Experiments made with Rats treated with Antimony , in order to find out in what Organs the Trypanosomes are latent .
The following initial experiments were made in order to find out where the trypanosomes rest during the period in which the peripheral blood is free from them , after treatment with antimony .
Further experiments are being carried on for the purpose of ascertaining in what forms they are present in the organs of treated animals .
The rats were inoculated with ISTagana , which is less affected by antimony than Surra , and were all treated with four doses of sodium antimony tartrate .
The rats were killed at various intervals , and the organs selected ( the liver and bone-marrow ) were made into an emulsion with a minimum quantity of 0'75 per cent , salt-solution , and injected into other rats in doses of 1 c.c. ; the same dose of blood from the heart was also given .
In the following table the signs + and \#151 ; are used respectively to denote a positive or negative result .

This is borne out by some experiments we have made upon trypanosomiasis in birds , in which cultivations of trypanosomes can often be made from the bone-marrow when they cannot be made either from the organs or the blood .
The doses given to the above rats were rather under those which we should judge to be curative , but in four cases the results were entirely negative .
