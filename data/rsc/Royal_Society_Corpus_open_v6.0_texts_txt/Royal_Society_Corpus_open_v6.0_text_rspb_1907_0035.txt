( Communicated by Dr. C. J. Martin , F.R.S. Received April 23 , \#151 ; Read May 30 , 1907 .
) In a previous communication it was shown that in certain immune sera , e.g. , in anti-staphylococcus , in anti-dysentery , and in anti-typhoid serum , there are present thermostable substances which , by their action , prepare the hotnologous organisms for phagocytosis .
The thermostability in the case of these immune sera could be demonstrated by the use of Wright and Douglas ' method , whereas fn the case of normal serum another method was , as a rule , necessary .
In the case of the serum of the horse , however , it was pointed out that even by Wright and Douglas ' method the increase of phagocytosis , observed by using normal heated serum , was , as compared with salt solution , generally considerable .
In view of certain experimental data and having regard to Ehrlich 's theory , the conclusion was arrived at that the thermostable substances of normal and immune sera were probably identical .
It was further shown that , when submitted to a temperature of 60 ' C. , both immune and normal serum suffered a rapid and sudden diminution in opsonic power .
This change occurs in the first few minutes of heating , after which further loss appears to take place very slowly .
The results obtained suggested that the sensitising action of the serum might be due to the combined action of two substances , the one thermostable , the other thermolabile ; the one of the nature of the " substance sensibilisatrice , " the other of the nature of an alexin .
The present paper is an account of certain experiments carried out with the view of elucidating this point.* * In the course of writing this paper , a communication by Neufeld and Hiine has reached me , in which , in a criticism of my interpretation of these curves , they appear to have overlooked the fact that I had indicated the possibility that the sudden fall may be due to a destruction of complement .
As at the time'of the publication of my previous communication I had no experimental data to support that view , I preferred to leave the matter for further investigation .
What I said was : " Whether free complement may take part in the preparation of the microbe is difficult to determine .
From the experiments detailed in this paper it is certain that it is not a necessary participant in this action .
At the same time it is not improbable that the 400 Mr. G. Dean .
Enquiry into Nature of the [ Apr. 23 , The Influence of the Strength of the Emulsion upon the Number of Organisms taken up by the Leucocytes .
In Table I are shown the results obtained in two experiments carried out in the usual way by mixing one volume of serum , one volume of washed blood corpuscles and one volume of bacterial emulsion , putting the pipettes containing the mixtures in the incubator at 35''5 C. for 15 minutes , after which the preparations for microscopical examination were made .
The number of phagocytosed bacteria were subsequently counted , and the average number per leucocyte taken as the phagocytic index .
As a rule , the number of organisms in 50 to 80 leucocytes were counted , and in many of the experiments the mean of two or three such counts by independent observers was taken .
The emulsion of Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus was employed in different concentrations , full strength , half strength , quarter strength , one-eighth strength , and one-sixteenth strength .

Influence of Dilution of the Serum upon the Number of Organisms TAKEN UP BY THE LEUCOCYTES .
, When in similar experiments different concentrations of the same normal serum are employed , no direct proportionality can be demonstrated to exist between the serum concentration and the number of microbes phagocytosed .
For example , the number of ingested organisms may be as great , or even greater , with the half , quarter , or even the one-eighth concentration , as with the full immune body , when aided by complement , may act more powerfully , and that the sudden fall in the " opsonic " power of both normal and immune serum , on heating , is due to the destruction of the complement .

It will be seen that with the half concentration of serum there is a slight rise in the curve .
This occurs so consistently that it can hardly be .
due to experimental error .
From the quarter concentration onwards a fall is seen in the curve .
It is interesting to note that this square-root proportionality is analogous to what was found by Schutz ( 1885 ) , Volhard ( 1901 ) and others working with albumin-pepsin and fat steapsine , etc. If these data are sufficiently accurate to be relied upon , it means that the phagocytosis is proportional to the square root of the dilution of serum for these concentrations , but that another factor is probably at work to account for the upper part of the curve .
The importance of this question of dilution in relation to the estimation of the amount of sensitising substances in the serum in normal , pathological , and immune conditions is obvious .

] Substance in Serum which influences Phagocytosis .
403 A striking instance may be given here .
One specimen of an anti-staphylococcic horse serum , when diluted 32 times with saline , was found to have lost only 25 per cent* of its sensitising power , whereas the corresponding dilution of a normal serum of the same age had lost 90 per cent. This subject in its various aspects will be dealt with more fully upon a future occasion .
The Influence of the Addition of Fresh Serum upon the Opsonic Power of Heated Immune Serum .
As was pointed out in my previous communication , thermostable immune substance is capable of sensitising the microbes for phagocytosis in the absence of free complement .
MetchnikofFs view , that in such cases the complement may be supplied by the leucocytes , is a possible interpretation , but will not be dealt with in the present paper .
I propose to discuss here the question as to whether the heated immune substance in the presence of * Some misunderstanding ( Wright and Reid , 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , !
1906 ) has arisen in regard to my remarks ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 76 , p. 506 ) on the limitations of Wright and Douglas ' technique .
I would again point out that their method may fail to demonstrate sensitising substances where these are present in considerable amount , and may show no difference between two fluids , notwithstanding that one contains a large amount of sensitising substance , the other only a small amount , or none .
To illustrate this , I may quote some experiments which were carried out with the view of determining the limits of sensitising action in an immune staphylococcic serum .
Dilutions of 1 in 100 of this immune serum , and 1 in 100 normal serum , when tested by the ordinary technique of Wright and Douglas , showed no difference in their action , which was practically nil .
On the other hand , if one mixed a volume of these dilutions with an equal volume of a coccal emulsion , so that the ultimate dilution was 1 in 200 , and placed the mixtures at 35''5 C. for one hour , and , after re-emulsifying both , carried out the ordinary technique , a very marked difference could be determined .
The results obtained with the same sera , at an interval of some months , by three different observers , who endeavoured to adhere to standard conditions as to emulsions , etc. , were as follows :\#151 ; Phagocytic index'of Immune Normal serum .

Enquiry into the Nature of the [ Apr. 23 , fresh serum produces a greater effect than results from the two substances acting independently ; in other words , is the action similar to , or identical with , the action of a bacteriolytic amboceptor and complement ?
At least two methods may be employed in the study of this problem : one , the direct method , of estimating the activity of the bodies when acting separately and in combination ; the other , indirect , by employing something which will throw out of action one of the constituents of a combination , leaving the other unaffected .
The Direct Method .
Experiments with The ordinary technique was employed .
In this experiment 1 volume of leucocytes , 1 volume of coccal emulsion and 1 volume of the serum were employed .

Some other factor must therefore be at work : in this experiment probably a complementing of the immune heated serum by the fresh serum .
Another experiment of the same type may be recorded in which a slightly different technique was employed .

Experiments with the Dysentery Bacillus of Shiga .
In the case of such organisms as the Dysentery bacillus , Typhoid bacillus , , and Cholera vibrio , a difficulty presents itself owing to the occurrence of bacteriolysis .
If the full strength of certain fresh normal sera is employed , , an accurate estimation of the phagocytosis by this method of investigation* may be impossible on account of the fact that many of the bacilli disappear altogether or are visible only as shadow forms both inside and outside the-leucocytes .
These phenomena are still more pronounced when one mixes with such a fresh normal serum a heated immune serum of any potency-The intracorpuscular and extracorpuscular bacteriolysis in such an experiment may be extreme .
By a process of dilution of both the normal and the immune serum it was found possible to overcome this difficulty .
For example , after a number of orientating experiments with dysentery , , cholera , etc. , it was found that if a dilution of 1/ 100 of a particular sample of heated anti-dysenteric serum was employed with a dilution of 1/ 20 or 1/ 30 of fresh serum , marked phagocytosis occurred with slight intracellular but no obvious extracellular bacteriolysis .
When 1 volume of these dilutions is mixed with 1 volume of leucocytes and 1 volume of bacterial emulsion , the ultimate dilutions reached are 1/ 60 or 1/ 90 of the fresh normal serum and 1/ 300 of the heated immune serum .
The procedure carried out in such an experiment is as follows .
Tubes and preparations are made in the usual manner from the following combinations:\#151 ; Average number of bacilli per leucocyte .

Taking into consideration the results obtained in the experiments upon the influence of dilution , we must assume that the mixture containing the higher serum .concentrations should have given a lower count even than 4*2 , whereas , by experiment , a count of 9*6 is obtained .
Another factor , therefore , must be at work in the production of this result , in all probability the complementary of the immune serum by the fresh normal serum .
Experiments with the Typhoid Bacillus and the normal Sera of the Guinea-pig and of the Babbit .
Certain normal sera have been very thoroughly investigated for the presence of amboceptor and complement in connection with bacteriolysis .
It seemed of interest to examine some of these for sensitising and complementing -action from the standpoint of phagocytosis .
If a like relation is proved to exist , it will be at least an indication that the substances which prepare the microbes on the one hand for extracellular bacteriolysis , and on the other hand for phagocytosis , are identical , and that free complement , while an essential factor only in the former process , yet plays in the latter also an important , if secondary , role .
The sera of the rabbit and guinea-pig , which have been investigated by Wechsberg ( 1902 ) and others for amboceptor and complement action in irelation to the bacteriolysis of the typhoid bacillus , offer excellent material for a comparative study of the two processes .
The following experiment , which is a repetition and confirmation of an .experiment of Wechsberg , shows how the matter stands for bacteriolysis in the case of the guinea-pig and of the rabbit .

Employing the opsonin technique , a number of tests was performed with the object of ascertaining how these two sera influenced the bacilli in regard to phagocytosis .

Enquiry into the Nature of the [ Apr. 23 , All were brought to the same volume .
A repetition of Experiments 3 , 4 , and 5 , with a thinner emulsion of the typhoid bacillus , gave the relation 0'9 , 2*0 , and 3*6 .
These experiments show , in the case of the sera of the rabbit and of the guinea-pig in relation to the typhoid bacillus , a marked parallelism between the extra-corpuscular bacteriolytic function and the sensitising or opsonising function by means of which the organisms are prepared for phagocytosis , and that a complementary action takes place in both cases .
The Indirect Method .
These experiments were based on the observations made by Ehrlich , Morgenroth , Bordet , Pfeiffer , and others that the injection of the serum of one species into another gives rise to the elaboration in the blood of the latter of anti-bodies , which may act either on the amboceptor or on the complement .
Anti-complement formation is a common phenomenon , whereas antiamboceptor is of rare occurrence .
The mechanism of the action of such sera has been the subject of much discussion which cannot be touched on here .
In the present paper the term " anti-complement serum " will be used without prejudice , the possibility that such a serum may act on other bodies besides-complement not being overlooked .
In relation to the present subject , it seemed of interest and importance to ascertain the effect produced by an anti-complement serum in experiments of the type of these with which we are dealing .
Whilst these experiments were in progress , Muir ( 1906 ) published results obtained by a similar method \yith which , in the main , the present series are in agreement .
Technique Employed .
The anti-complement serum was prepared by injecting a rabbit on several occasions with human or horse serum which was previously heated to 58 ' to 60 ' C. for half an hour .
The anti-complement serum , after separation , was itself heated to 60 ' C. for 20 minutes .
Varying proportions of this-serum were then added to the homologous fresh serum , or to the mixture of which it was a constituent part .
The tubes containing these were incubated for two hours at 350,5 C. In this way a precipitin reaction was produced .
The supernatant fluid removed from the precipitum was employed , in th\amp ; experiment .
By doing a series of eight or 12 such tests , the most effective combinations of the serum were ascertained .
/ In some of the experiments there was no such preliminary treatment of the fresh serum by the antiserum , this being simply made one of the constituent parts of the mixture of 1907 .

The further carrying out of the experiments was as follows:\#151 ; ( A ) Normal rabbit serum , heated to 60 ' C. for 20 minutes , 10 volumes , + Fresh normal horse serum , 5 volumes , ( At 350,5 C. for two hours .

) The supernatant fluid from each of the above mixtures A , B , C , and D , was subsequently mixed with an equal volume of human leucocytes and staphylococcic emulsion and kept at 37 ' C. for 15 minutes .
When horse serum had been injected into the rabbit to obtain the anticomplement serum , it was found impossible to use horse leucocytes in the experiment , on account of the rapid agglutination of the red cells and entanglement of the leucocytes .
In this case , therefore , human leucocytes were used , and by so doing the possible danger of a certain amount of specific leuco-toxic action was avoided .
The results of seven experiments are detailed in Table V ( p. 410 ) .
It is seen that a great loss in the sensitising power has resulted in Experiment 2 , where the anti-complement serum was used .
The higher .count of Experiment 4 , as compared with Experiment 3 , is probably largely due to the fact that the heated anti-complement serum had a higher sensitising power than the normal rabbit serum employed , the ratio being about 2:1 .
This last observation applies to all the corresponding figures in the table , which summarises the results of seven such experiments , with a varying proportion of anti-complement and normal sera versus fresh horse serum .
On comparing the second and fourth columns of that table , it will be seen that fresh normal serum , after having been acted on by the anti\lt ; 7 complement serum , gives almost the same phagocytic average as is 410 Mr. G. Dean .
Enquiry into the Nature of the [ Apr. 23 , obtained by heated horse serum under the same conditions , a loss has occurred comparable to that produced by heating to 60 ' C. for 20 minutes .

Action of Anti-Complement Serum in Complemented .
The following experiments with staphylococci may be reported in full as the type of such experiments .
The usual opsonic technique was employed , the constituent parts of the mixture introduced into the tubes being as follows ( see table , p. 411 ) .
A comparison of 1 and 4 shows that , by ' the action of anti-complement serum , the phagocytic average has been reduced from 15T to 2-4 .
Similar experiments with the dysentery immune serum of the horse complemented with normal human serum showed , as the result of the action of the anti-complement serum , a reduction in the phagocytic index in one experiment from 7'5 to T3 , in another from 5-9 to T7 .
In this case human anti-complement serum and horse leucocytes were employed .

6-9 1*7 Summary .
1 .
Dilution of fresh unheated serum is not accompanied , so far as the higher concentrations are concerned , by a fall in the sensitising power for certain organisms ( staphylococcus , tubercle bacillus ) .
The diminution in this was found , as a rule , to begin at the quarter concentration .
2 .
So far as the present experiments go , the points corresponding to the l/ 4th , l/ 8th , l/ 16th , and l/ 32nd dilutions of normal human serum lie on a parabola whose equation is y* \#151 ; 4X , i.e. , for these dilutions the phagocytosis is proportional to the square root of the serum concentration .
3 .
The phagocytic index obtained by mixing appropriate dilutions of a heated immune serum with a normal fresh serum is greater than results* from the two substances acting separately .
412 Nature of Substance in Serum which influences 4 .
In the case of certain normal sera ( guinea-pig and rabbit ) previously investigated for amboceptor and complement in relation to the extra--corpuscular bacteriolysis of the typhoid bacillus ( Wechsberg ) , an exact ^parallelism can be demonstrated to exist between that function and opsonisa-tion .
The normal amboceptor can be complemented by fresh serum in ^regard to both functions .
5 .
An " anti-complement " serum , when mixed with a fresh normal serum alone or in a mixture containing heated immune serum , throws out of action .the thermolabile substance , whereas it does not appear to influence the ithermostable substance .
