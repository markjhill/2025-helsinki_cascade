" On the Plasticity of an Ice Crystal .
" By the late J. C. MoConnel , M.A. Communicated by R. T. Glazebrook , F.R.S. Received January 24 , 1891 .
wo yearsvago , in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society , ' was pubis ed an account of some experiments on the plasticity of ice made y r. Kidd and myself .
We proved the oft-repeated statement , that g cier ice is not plastic under tension^ to be erroneous , and showed at any ordinary bar of ice composed of several crystals will yield continuously either to pressure or tension .

[ Mar. 12 , tion would only have corroborated the perfect " brittleness " 0f single crystal .
Since our paper was written , my attention has been called to a passage in Professor James Thomson 's masterly article on " The Lowering of the Melting Point of Ice by Distorting Stress ' ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1849 ) , in which he expresses the opinion that crystals whether of ice or other substances , are not plastic .
If we reject the idea of internal distortion of the crystals , we are driven to the conclusion that the observed plasticity must be due to some action at the interfaces , whereby the crystals alter their shape sufficiently to allow them to alter their relative positions .
As to the nature of the action , various suggestions occurred to me .
James Thomson explained the plasticity of ice at 0 ' C. by supposing the ice to melt at those interfaces where the stress was great , and the liberated water , after flowing to points where the stress was small , to again solidify .
This might be extended to low temperatures by supposing a certain quantity of water to be kept in the liquid state by the pressure of residual impurities .
But the process would be enormously retarded by the constant necessity for the distribution of salt being equalised by diffusion .
Again , it is not clear how a bar of ice during this process would be able to resist a tension considerably greater than the pressure of the atmosphere .
With more probability we may suppose one crystal to grow at the expense of another owing to the stresses and strains on the contiguous parts being different .
Though the stresses were the same , the strains might be different , owing to seolotropic elasticity .
But the elasticities are not likely to be very different in different directions , so for a very small extension of the bar we should expect considerable movement of the interfaces .
There is , however , nothing to prevent the stresses being different .
The tension in any direction parallel to the interface might be greater in one crystal than in the other .
The migration of matter from one crystal to another under less stress would probably in almost all cases be accompanied by yielding to the external force producing the stresses .
But in this case the effect would be very indirect , and again we might look for large movement of the interfaces .
Some such speculations had occupied my mind last autumn , and it was with considerable curiosity that I began experiments in December on the puzzling question of the real cause of the plasticity of ice .
I tooK a bar of ice consisting of half a dozen crystals , made a drawing under the polariscope of the relative position of the interfaces , and then set up the bar with the ends supported and a weight hung from the middle .
After two days , it had bent a good deal , yet , under the polariscope , I could detect no material change in the position of the interfaces .
One crystal , however , had completely changed its appearance .
It now strongly reminded me of a piece of unannealed 1891 .

glass .
There were two centres of colour encircled by irregular rings , and these remained much the same when the two faces through which the light passed were rubbed quite flat and the other crystals cut away .
There could be no doubt that this crystal had suffered something more than mere elastic distortion .
The next experiment was very instructive .
A thin slip of ice , being a single crystal , was subjected to bending stress as before , and left for several hours .
It apparently bent very quickly , for after a few hours it was found crescent shaped , and luckily unbroken , lying at the bottom of the box .
The optic axis was bent , and , though its change of direction was rapid where the bend was sharp , there appeared to be no break in continuity .
On the other hand , the long narrow bubbles , which were originally no doubt parallel to each other and perpendicular to the slip , were still parallel to each other throughout .
In fact , as I noted at the time , the crystal behaved as if it consisted of an infinite number of indefinitely thin sheets of paper , normal to the optic axis , attached to each other by some viscous substance which allowed one to slide over the next with great difficulty .
This comparison proved to be the key to the whole question of the plasticity of a crystal of ice .
Further experiment showed that if a bar of ice consisting of a single crystal with the axis perpendicular to two of the side faces was subjected to bending stress , it would bend freely in the plane of the axis either at or below the freezing point , but not at all in a plane perpendicular to it .
In the bent crystal the optic axis in any part was normal to the bent faces in that part .
But any series of lines drawn in the substance of the ice which were originally parallel to the optic axis and to each other remained parallel to each other , though not , of course , to the optic axis .
This was evidenced by the position of long narrow bubbles which frequently form at right angles to the planes of freezing , and also by the end faces of the bar remaining parallel to each other .
When the optic axis was longitudinal , the bar bent indeed , but not very readily , and the general behaviour was Daor8 obscure .
Still , this case , too , was in satisfactory agreement ^ith the analogy mentioned above .
bet us state this analogy more fully .
The sheets of paper offer no Resistance to bending , but utterly refuse to stretch except , of course , e a\#174 ; tically , Initially they are plane and perpendicular to the optic axis , and , after they have been deformed by bending , the optic axis at any point is still normal to the sheet at that point .
They are of Uniform thickness , whence it easily follows that the directions of the 8Ptic axis in any crystal form a series of straight , though not parallel , Mr. J. C. McConnel .

Detailed Account of the Experiments .
The first two experiments have been sufficiently described already The place of experiment was a north room in the Buol Hotel Davos .
A box without a lid was placed on a wooden table , and across the top of this box were laid two pieces of wood , which served to support the ends of the bar of ice .
From the middle of the bar was suspended a weight with a loop of thick string .
In the bottom of the box , but at the other end , i.e. , about a foot from the ice and 6 inches below it , was placed a registering thermometer of the Six pattern .
Over the whole was put a thick wooden cover .
As there was nothing inside the cover of great capacity for heat , I believe that any variation of the temperature of the ice was nearly simultaneously felt by the thermometer .
This thermometer , which was used throughout , was divided into Fahrenheit degrees ; its correction at freezing-point was tested both before and after the experiments .
The error did not exceed \#163 ; ' F. At 6 ' F. I compared it with a spirit thermometer which had been verified at Kew ; it read F. too high .
These errors are negligible in the present work .
Exp. 3.\#151 ; A bucket of water left in the ice room over night was found in the morning covered with ice about 15 mm. thick , consisting of several crystals .
From this I sawed out a bar and planed it smooth and straight .
The breadth was 10 mm.the depth , 9 mm. The bar contained many long bubbles in a vertical position .
All the middle of it was one crystal with the axis nearly vertical .
The two ends of the bar were composed of many crystals .
A weight of 1'29 kilograms was applied from 11.20 am .
to 8.30 p.m. on December 14 .
During this time the maximum temperature was \#151 ; 2''8 C. ; the minimum , \#151 ; 5''6 0 .
; and the mean , about \#151 ; 3''6 C. The bar had taken the shape of the diagram , fig. 1 , which is copied from a trace Fig. 1 .
made soon after the experiment .
The bends at the points indicated by a and h were more decided in the bar than in the trace .
The exact position of the supports was not noted at the time , but they certainty did not extend right up to the bends at a and 6 .
The fact that the two end pieces are still nearly in line suggests that the end surfaces 1891 .
] On the Plasticity of an Ice Crystal .
of the middle crystal are in the same position as before the bending .
The question immediately suggested itself whether the bend was due to a limited number of layers sliding over each other by finite amounts , or to a true shearing strain .
I examined the surfaces of the bubbles very carefully with a magnifying glass , and could find no trace of projecting edges or " faults , " so I concluded it was a true shear .
My polariscope was the same as was used two years ago.-Light from the white paper A , fig. 2 , was reflected by the three Fig. 2 .
P Ates of glass , B , upwards through the Nicol C , and then the ice was with'U ^ass sfage E , or held in the closed hand .
D was lined 1 black velvet .
This simple apparatus served its purpose excel- .
an(* ^ was seldom that I wished for a more elaborate apparatus f ; 1 convergent light .
The bent bar under this polariscope was 1 to have the optic axis as nearly as I could tell normal to the XLIX .
3 Mr. J. C. McConnel .
[ Mar. j| I bent faces throughout .
If the black centre was near the middle of one half , the sharp bend was crowded with narrow coloured bands which moved slowly along as the bar was tilted , till as each band reached the straight piece beyond the bend it moved rapidly and broadened out .
The movement of the bands across the bend , though slow , was qnite regular , so the direction of the optic axis changed quickly but not per saltum .
Exp. 4.\#151 ; A similar arrangement .
The bar was all one crystal except the parts actually on the supports .
The optic axis was transverse , but horizontal .
Depth , 95 mm. ; breadth , 10 mm. ; supports , 75 mm. apart .
The weight of " 1*29 'kilos , was applied over 42 hours from 4.15 p.m. on TDecember 15 to 10.35 A.m. on December 17 .
The minimum temperature was \#151 ; '70,8 C. , the maximum \#151 ; 1'T C. , the mean about \#151 ; 3''3 C. Decided evaporation had taken place ; the edges of the bar were rounded and the string Which had stuck to the bar was raised on ridges .
The greater part of the bar was mm. deep , 9 mm. broad .
In comparing the traces taken before and after the experiment I could find no bending .
It certainly did not amount to half a millimetre .
The traces were taken by laying the bar on a sheet of paper and followingtthe upper and lower edges with a pencil .
Exp. 5.\#151 ; The same bar , turned so as to put the optic axis vertical , bent rapidly .
Depth 8f mm. , breadth 8\#163 ; mm. Distance between supports 73 mm. The weight of 0*62 kilo .
was applied from 11.10 a.m. to 9.5 p.m. on December 17 .
The minimum'temperature was \#151 ; 4''4 C. , the maximum \#151 ; 1'-7 C. , mean about -\#151 ; 3o-0 .
The depression of the middle measured on the trace was about 4'4 mm. , which had taken place in 10 hours .
Assuming that in Experiment 4 the depression was less then 0'5 mm. , the bending of the bar in the new position must have been at least thirty-seven times as fast .
It is true the depth and breadth were slightly less , but the weight was less than half as great .
The results of \#187 ; Exp.:3 as to bubbles and optic axis were confirmed .
Exp. 6.\#151 ; A'bar with the axis longitudinal .
I obtained a large lump of thick ice from the Davos lake , and from this oiit a bar which appeared to be all one crystal , with the axis longitudinal .
I need not enter on the details of the experiment , especially as the temperature rose above freezing-point .
But at the end the bar had the shape shown in the diagram , Eigs .
3 , 4 .
The dotted line indicates a division between the crystals .
double-headed arrows show the direction of the optic axis in different parts , or at least the projection of that direction on the plane of the paper .
This was determined by making the field of the polariscope as dark as possible , putting the part of the bar in question in the middle 1891 .

329 Fig. 3 .
of the field and then turning it till it looked as dark as possible .
When this is done the axis lies in the principal plane of the instrument .
It will be noticed that in each crystal the direction of the optic axis is almost uniform .
I imagine that the two crystals existed virtually in the bar , but that their optic axes were so nearly parallel that in the polariscope they behaved as one crystal .
The kind of shear that must have taken place in the upper crystal is represented in fig. 4 by a number of layers of finite thickness slipped over one another .
I cannot say definitely that the bending was either slower or faster than in a bar all one crystal with the axis vertical .
The part beyond the dotted line is perhaps due to the intrusion of another crystal completely overlapped by the main crystal , or perhaps to some alteration of the optical qualities due to elastic strain .
Exp. 7.\#151 ; Another bar cut from the same lump was a single crystal s with the axis nearly longitudinal , inclined perhaps at 5 ' to the side of 1 the bar .
Breadth 10-7 , depth 10'5 , distance between supports 84 mm. , weight l-29 kilos .
After six hours , during which time the tempera-* ^ure ^ia , d been between \#151 ; 1''7 and \#151 ; 0o,6 C. , the bar was found lying at the bottom of the box broken into two pieces .
It had bent so much ( that 't must have slipped down between the supports and been broken ; ie fall .
The two parts could be accurately pieced together .
At e dotted line there was a very rapid but not sudden change in the lection of the optic axes .
The shape of the surfaces normal to the i| \#171 ; ptic axes is shown in fig. 5 ( p. 330 ) .
These sliding surfaces must : J ave geometrical property that the normal drawn at any point to *|uy point is also normal to all the surfaces it cuts within the bar .

Mr. J. C. McConnel .
[ Mar , 12 , Fig. 5 .
It will be noticed that the directions of the optic axis in different parts form a series of straight lines .
This is an immediate consequence of the hypothesis of the existence of sliding surfaces , and may be shown in the following way.\#151 ; In the part of the crystal beyond the dotted line , however , this rule does not hold good .
In the original unstrained crystal the optic axis is in the same direction everywhere .
Hence layers perpendicular to it are of equal thickness throughout .
Their subsequent bending and slipping does not affect their uniformity of thickness .
We need only consider one of the principal directions of curvature .
Draw PP ' , QQ ' normal to the surface at P , Q , to meet the next surface at P'Q ' .
On PP ' drop perpendiculars Qn , Q V. All the quantities in small distances are small except the radii of curvature p , p at P and P .
Since the thickness of the layer is uniform , PP ' \#151 ; QQ = w\#187 ; ' .
Thus to the second order of small quantities P = PV .
; Fig. 6 .
But since P nis normal to the curve PQ at P , P = Qns/ 2p = Qw3/ 2/ / to the second order .
Now this would have been the 1891 .

expression for PV if it had been normal to the curve P'Q ' at P ' and Q 'nhad been drawn perpendicular to it , and PP ' is normal to the curve P'Q " at P ' .
Exp. 8.\#151 ; This was an experiment on a bar composed of three crystals designed to investigate the action at the interfaces of crystals .
The bar bent a good deal , but nearly the whole bend occurred in the middle of one of the crystals .
I had cut nicks in the sides of the bar to test for migration of the interfaces within the ice , but found none .
It appears , in fact , that the interfaces do not in any way assist the plasticity , but hinder it by fettering the sliding of the layers in the separate crystals .
Exp. 9.\#151 ; Out ' of some thick ice formed on the surface of the water in a foot-bath I cut a bar which was all one crystal .
When the bar was in position the optic axis was horizontal , and inclined at about 60 ' to the length of the bar .
Breadth , 13 mm. ; depth , 117 mm. ; distance between supports , 38 mm. A weight of P29 kilos , was applied for T.6^ hours from 4.50 p.m. on January 29 to 9.15 a.m. on January 30 , during which time the maximum temperature was \#151 ; 5 ' C. , the minimum \#151 ; 12''7 C. , and the mean about \#151 ; 8''6 C. The depression of the middle was 1*9 mm. A little consideration will show that by the theory of the sliding layers , the upper and lower surfaces of the bar should be bent in such a manner as to still contain straight lines perpendicular to the optic axis .
Some such deformation was observed , but it was not very definite .
I noticed that the numerous bubbles which were originally parallel to the axis were still parallel to the upper and 'lower surfaces in their neighbourhood .
I now set up an arrangement for obtaining more accurate measurements of the rate of bending .
A large square aperture in an iron plate was bridged by a curved iron bar rigidly attached to the plate .
The bar of ice was placed across the aperture .
A loop attached to the curved bar supported a wire lever , of which the long arm served as a pointer on a scale , and the short arm carried a stirrup which embraced the ice .
When the bar bent the stirrup was depressed and the pointer raised about twenty-eight times as much .
This part of the apparatus was placed in a cigar box , at one end of which the pointer projected through a slit , while there was a hole in ihe bottom to allow the string , to which the weight was attached , to pass through .
The Six thermometer was on a level with the ice , and could be read by gently lifting the lid without disturbing any-lmg .
The mirror and scale with which the position of the pointer was read were fastened to the box .
The only part of the stirrup that touched the ice was the flat piece fin at the bottom .
This was slightly roughed and made flat , so Mr. J. C. McConnel .
Fig. 7 .
[ Mar. 12 I that it should not slip off the projection left by the gradual evaporation of the unsheltered surface .
The string carrying the weight was put as close as possible to the stirrup without risk of touching it , and so that the central point of the aperture came somewhere between the two .
Exp. 10.\#151 ; The bar was- taken from ?
the same bath ice as in the last experiment .
It was all one crystal with the axis vertical .
The first attempt was a failure , owing ) I believe , to some snow getting underneath the iron plate , and , by giving way gradually , tilting up the plate .
I had put a good deal of snow inside the cigar box , with the hope of preventing evaporation .
This made the readings erratic and unreliable , so the next day I turned the bar over to give the stirrup a smooth surface to bear upon , and started fresh .
The results are given in the table ( p. 333 ) .
I think the amount of depression may generally be trusted to within 0'01 mm. Several interesting points are brought out in this table .
When | the weight is changed , the alteration in the rate of depression is great out of all proportion , e.g. , the alteration from 0 0058 to 0'410 when the weight is changed from 0'174 to 1'47 per square cm .
During the course of the experiment there was a decided rise in plasticity ; compare the earlier with the later rates under 1'47 per square cm-at similar temperature .
This is corroborated by the increase of speed under 0'85 kilo .
The only exception , viz. , the decrease of speed at first under 41*7 kilos , was due , I believe , to the elastic strains which had been set up in the preliminary bending .
The effect of these elastic strains is shown by the undoubted rise of the middle of the bar when the weight was removed at the end of the experiment .

] On the Plasticity of an Ice Crystal .
Into this matter I enter more fully below .
The indicated rise between 12.59 and 2.3 p.m. is , I feel sure , simply dne to a misreading .
Whenever the weight was altered the apparatus was unavoidably disturbed , so I had to take an entirely fresh reading of the pointer .
Generally this only differed by fractions of a millimetre from the previous reading , but in the case in point it was nearly 6 mm. greater .
The ice showed an inconvenient tendency to slip backwards on the iron plate , thus bringing the end of the pointer forwards till it almost touched the edge of the slit .
The ice had to be pushed forwards three or four times during the experiment .
Of course a fresh reading was taken after each such displacement , so that no error resulted .
This trouble was caused doubtless by the plate not being accurately level .
In subsequent experiments I was more successful in avoiding it .
Exp. 11.\#151 ; I desired to establish with the more delicate system of measurement that the plasticity is inappreciable when the bending stress is applied at right angles to the axis .
I cut a bar , all one crystal , from the bath ice , and planed it so that the upper and lower surfaces were as accurately as possible parallel to the optic axis .
In the polariscope , when the middle of the black croBS was in the middle of the bar , the two faces were equally inclined to the lines of sight .
I then set up the apparatus in the usual way .
The results are seen in the annexed table ( p. 334 ) .
It will be seen that the pointer indicated a rise of the stirrup amounting in the 21-^ hours to 0*29 mm. As was before mentioned , the stirrup was slightly roughed to prevent it from slipping , so at first it would make contact with the bar at only a few points .
Evaporation would help to extend the contact to large surfaces , and admit of a slight movement of the stirrup relatively to the ice .
Thus the experiment was not as satisfactory as could be wished .
It 18 possible that a very slight depression of the bar might be masked oy this efEect of evaporation .
But even supposing that the rate of real depression was twice as great as that of the apparent elevation , T*\#174 ; '* \#174 ; 0943 mm. per hour , it would still be very small compared with | e rates of the next experiment .
I am at any rate entitled to say at within the limits of error of experiment there is only one kind of P asticity in an ice crystal , viz. , that due to the sliding layers at right angles to the optic axis .
It is probable that the same source of error ^as active in other experiments , but in them the efEect would be 1 almost negligible . .
The same bar was turned on its side so that the optic axis was vertical .

] On the Plasticity of an Ice Crystal .
We first notice that the plasticity exists down to \#151 ; 14'*4 .
At this jjj temperature the bending was slow , but this was due in great part to the fact that it came at the beginning , and the bar was as usual .
The y rapid growth of plasticity , independently of the temperature , is shown by the rate of 0'59 mm. per hour at a mean temperature of \#151 ; 50,6 , ' being raised in less than two hours to 1T8 mm. at \#151 ; 6'*1 .
The tendency to recover when the weight is removed is shown three times over in the table .
As might be expected , it soon becomes very slow , and I in that case after twelve hours , when the recovery amounts to O'72 mra .
, it has probably stopped altogether .
In the fall of rate from - T89 at \#151 ; 1'*7 to 1T8 at \#151 ; 6''l and 0*745 at \#151 ; 13 ' , in spite of the natural tendency for the rate to rise , we seem to have a real effect of i temperature .
After 8.38 , the cigar box had to be left open as the pointer ; had almost reached the lid of the box , and so the subsequent temperatures are unreliable .
I imagine that the change from 0*"85 to j 0*745 was due to a fall of temperature .
At the beginning of Exp. 11 the bar measured 14 mm. by 12*3 mm. , which was reduced at the end of Exp. 12 to 13 mm. by 10*8 mm. ; The evaporation had been rather more rapid just at the bend of the \lt ; bar .
This was owing , I believe , to the circulation of air through the hole by which the string passed out .
I measured the total depression on the trace as 2*6 mm. As mea-j sured by the pointer it is 2*45 .
The agreement is as good as could be \#171 ; expected .
| # A Exp. 13.\#151 ; In this experiment I used a thicker bar and tried a variety of weights .
The bar was only just small enough to go into the stirrup .
( See Table IV , next page .
) The stiffness of the bar in the first three hours is surprising .
Exp. 14.\#151 ; In all the experiments hitherto on bars composed of single crystals it happened that the optic axis had been vertical when the ice was formed , so that the planes of freezing coincided with the sliding layers .
I fully believed that this coincidence was merely acci-ental , and what happened in Exp. 8 had confirmed this idea , , but 1 t ought it desirable to have a more direct proof .
So I cut a piece 'nt of a good large crystal in the ice , found on the surface of the water the bucket , in which the optic axis was not vertical .
When e bar was put in position the planes of freezing were vertical and parallel to the length , and the optic axis was normal to the length atl hiclined at about 50 ' to the vertical .
The bar was about 8 mm. quare , and the distance between the supports was 51 mm. nder a weight of 0'62 kilo , in 4 hours 28 minutes at a mean temperature of 4'-4 ( the maximum \#151 ; 1'*4 ) it bent downwards about nutl* There was a large lateral bend , which made the vertical bend very difficult to measure .

freezing , this bar should not have bent at all .
If , however , the sliding layers are necessarily perpendicular to the optic axis , this bar should have been free to bend on the plane of the optic axis , but not in the perpendicular plane .
In the experiment the plane of the total bend contained the optic axis .
Thus the experiment was decisive .
In attempting to discover the manner in which the rate of the molecules sliding over each other depends on the driving force , we are met by the difficulty that the rate of depression depends on at least three other circumstances , the temperature , the previous history of the bar , and the irregularity of the stresses and strains within the bar .
The second is to some extent avoided by only considering the rates observed immediately before and immediately after the change of weight .
The third is probably not very important .
In the following table are collected all the instances which occurred , with the attendant changes of temperature .
The changes of rate are not so great as the square , but greater than the first power of the changes of the applied force .
In the table may be seen the amount of correspondence with the power f. The two most glaring discrepancies are in the second Table V. 1 Change mean temperature .

But these discrepancies may be largely , if not entirely , iby the great change of temperature .
Without elevating a e statement to the rank of a law , we may say that fairly close the em , en^ W^1 observed facts is obtained by supposing that when an ecu^es slide on each other the cube of the friction varies ^ the square of the velocity .
bar f^einPting to pass from the rate at which the centre of a loaded difficult'S coo \#174 ; c^ent of plasticity , we meet with considerable ^atio lCST an\lt ; ^ have to content ourselves with a rough approxi-n ' lij might well be thought that the problem of a rectangular Mr. J. C. McConnel .
[ Mar. 12 , elastic bar , supported at either end and loaded in the middle , had been fully worked out .
But this does not appear to be the case The ordinary elementary treatment makes the gigantic assumption that plane cross-sections of the unbent bar remain plane , and that the lateral contraction or expansion of elementary strips parallel to the ength of the bar under longitudinal pulls or thrusts are the same as in free space .
It does not consider any shearing stresses or strains .
It is true that Rankine ( 'Applied Mechanics , ' p. 338 ) , assuming the results of this method , proceeds to find an expression for the shearing stress .
He makes it proportional to a3 \#151 ; a:3 , where the origin is at the centre of the bar , the axis of is drawn upwards , and 2a is the depth of the bar .
But this expression is inconsistent with the general equations of an elastic solid .
St. Venant 's solution of the bending of a bar , given in Thomson and Tait 's ' Natural Philosophy , ' postulates equal and opposite couples applied at the two ends , so that the bending moment is uniform throughout .
The importance of the absence of this uniformity is not trifling but fundamental , for in our case everything depends on the shears , and in St. Yenant 's solution there are no shears .
I fancy that I see my way to obtaining the complete solution in the form of infinite series .
But , since it ceases to be applicable the moment plastic strains take place , it would only enable us to determine the initial stresses , and this would hardly justify the insertion here of such a long investigation .
The following simple but imperfect treatment must suffice .
Let us first define the coefficient of plasticity .
Take a rectangular element with two faces normal to the optic axis , and let these faces be subjected to a tangential force U per unit of area in opposite directions , parallel to another pair of faces .

Then if the rate of growth of two of the angles , or rate of dim ' nution of the other two be denoted by dx/ dt , the coefficient of P 'lS ticity p may be defind by the equation dX dt pTJ ( D- i On the Plasticity of an Ice Crystal .

c The bar is represented in fig. 9 , with a weight W hanging from j the middle .
The length between the supports is Z , the breadth h , j the depth d. U is the force per unit area which acts on a small j vertical interface in a vertical direction , and when U is positive the f matter to the left of the interface is urged upwards .
The force per | unit area on a horizontal interface in a direction parallel to the length of the bar is necessarily the same , and is also denoted by U. Consider 0 the equilibrium of the part of the bar to the right of any cross 1 section PP ' .
It is urged upwards at the support by a force equal to | ; therefore , if we neglect its weight , the total vertical force on the j ] section PP ' is also |W .
If U be the average of U over the section bdU -|W ... ... ... ... ... ... ( 2 ) .
J ^ cannot be constant over the section , for it necessarily vanishes at jJ the upper and lower surfaces of the bar .
J The average shear over any cross section being the same , except that I the sign suddenly changes at the middle of the bar , it is reasonable to I suppose that the same amount of plastic shearing strain would take j place between the layers perpendicular to the optic axis at every cross sec ion .
This condition makes the bar bend sharply when the weight is applied , and keeps the two halves straight .
In the earlier experiments , W ere the bending was considerable , this form was observed before its | cause had been perceived .
For this form to be assumed without e as ic strain , the plastic strain must be the same , not merely in corre-i sponding points of different cross sections , but also throughout each I g'f8 8ec^on itself , and , in fact , throughout the entire half of the bar .
j n as we nave seen , the shearing stress must vanish at both the J shea^an\lt ; ^ l'wer surfaces .
Doubtless the truth is that the state of .

Probably in these j wu p3,8 ^le alastic strains are very great , and quite different from 1 a are elsewhere .

This gives the coefficient of plasticity in terms of the unsupported length of the bar , the weight per unit area of cross section , and the observed rate of depression .
We have employed equation ( 2 ) , which is strictly applicable only when the bar is straight and horizontal .
But , in the cases to which we have to apply these results , x is so small that the error is negligible .
It was hardly worth while calculating the numerical value of p , especially as it has been shown to depend on the temperature , on the value of U nearly , and also on the previous history of the bar .
But the above investigation will assist any one in estimating , as far as can be done from my experiments , the rate of distortion of an ice crystal in any given case .
In several cases in the experiments , after a heavy weight was removed , a slight gradual unbending of the bar took place .
At first I thought this a mere consequence of the irregular elastic strains on the bar , the parts most severely strained gradually bending back the rest .
But the magnitude of the recovery seems , on closer examination , to put this explanation out of the question , and I have now little doubt that it is a true molecular effect .
In Exp. 12 , after a stress of 1*69 kilos , per sq .
cm .
had been removed , the middle of the bar rose 0 0104 cm .
in four hours .
According to an experiment by Moseley ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1871 ) , Young 's modulus for ice is 92,700 kilos , per sq .
cm .
Hence , if we neglect the effect of the plastic strains in one bar of ice , the elastic depression under 2*5 kilos , should have been 0*00138 cm .
, less than one- j seventh of the recovery observed .
The permanent or plastic strai'\#174 ; | in Moseley 's bar are considerable , so that the deduced valoe ' \lt ; Young s modulus may be too great .

343 of ice , found the value 60,000 .
Reusch ( ' Nature , ' vol. 21 , p. 504 ) , by experimenting on the sonorous vibrations of rectangular plates of ice , found Young 's modulus to be 23,632 kilos , per sq .
cm .
( this last method seems rather dangerous ) .
In attempting to devise an imaginary system of strains sufficiently great to render such a recovery as 0'1 cm .
possible , we are soon brought up by the breaking tension of ice .
Direct experiments by Moseley give this as 7 or 8 kilos , per sq .
cm .
, and Kidd and myself found it in one case to be 8-3 kilos , per sq .
cm .
, but the fact that the bar of ice in Exp. ( 11 ) bore the weight of 2*5 kilos , before any plastic strains had taken place brings it out greater than 15*5 kilos , per sq .
cm .
, and the bar in Exp. ( 13 ) was able to endure an even greater stress .
A similar discrepancy has been noticed in the case of cast iron ( Rankine , 'App .
Mechanics , ' S 297 ) .
Using the latitude given by the uncertain values of the constants to the utmost , I have not been able to devise any system of elastic strains which could possibly make the bar rise 0 01 cm .
, and there is no reason to suppose that the unknown system of strains actually occurring in the experiments would be exceptionally well adapted to such a purpose .
I conclude , then , that we have to deal with a real tendency of the forcibly displaced sliding layers to slide back .
The rate of recovery , rapid at first , soon falls off .
Thus in Exp. ( 10 ) there was a recovery of 0*046 mm. in the first 18 minutes , and only 0*021 in the next 58 .
In Exp. ( 15 ) after 0*014 in the first 11 minutes , and the same in the next 31 , the motion probably came to a standstill after a few hours , practically , if not absolutely .
Thus in Exp. ( 12 ) the bar was left with no weight on for 12 hours , and the recovery \#166 ; was only 0*072 mm. I [ Mr. McConnel died suddenly at Davos while engaged on the fore-going paper , which has been printed from his rough copy with some | few alterations of no great importance .
