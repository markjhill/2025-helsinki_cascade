) ( Abstract .
) A direct current arc from 100-volt mains was formed between copper rods within a pressure cylinder designed by Professor J. E. Petavel , E.R.S. The light passed through a glass window , and , after reflection from two mirrors , was focussed upon the slit of the large Rowland grating spectroscope in the Physical Laboratories of the Manchester University .
The apparatus and method of using it have been described in a previous paper.* The spectrum of the copper arc in air has been photographed in the region X \#151 ; 4000 to X = 4600 A.U. at the following pressures : 5 , 10 , .15 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 100,125 , f 150 , f 203f atmospheres ( excess above 1 atmosphere ) .
I. Broadening .
Within the region XX 4000\#151 ; 4600 :\#151 ; 1 .
All lines are broader under high pressures than under atmospheric pressure .
2 .
The broadening increases with the pressure ; it has not been determined if the increase is continuous and linear with the pressure .
3 .
The broadening of all lines is unsymmetrical , being greater on the red side .
4 .
The amount of broadening is different for different lines .
5 .
Two types of broadening have been observed : some lines at first become faint and hazy , almost resembling bands , and are completely dissipated under higher pressures ( series lines ) ; others , though much broadened , remain well-defined lines ( non-series lines ) .
6 .
No simple relation has been found between the width of a line under pressure and its original intensity .
7 .
The intensity curves of the sharp lines under pressure are steeper towards the violet than are those of the nebulous lines .
The sharp and nebulous lines retain their characteristic " hard " and " soft " appearances throughout .

8 .
The nebulous and sharp non-series lines broaden to about the same extent ; for the well-defined lines , the width may be as great as 12 A.U. aj ; 203 atmospheres.* 9 .
The broadening at first appears to increase more rapidly than the displacement , making measurements at low pressures less accurate than those at high pressures .
II .
Displacement .
Within the region Xk 4000\#151 ; 4600 :\#151 ; I 1 .
Under pressure , the most intense portion of every line is displaced from the position it occupies at a pressure of 1 atmosphere .
2 .
The displacement is in the direction of greater wave-length .
3 .
The displacement is real , and not due to unsymmetrical broadening , i.e. % the line is broadened about a displaced position .
4 .
The displacement of each line is , within the limits of accuracy of the-experiments , continuous and linear with the pressure .
5 .
The rates of increase of the displacement with the pressure are different for different lines .
6 .
The lines belonging to the first and second subordinate series have greater-displacements than the non-series lines .
Their great width precludes accurate measurement .
7 .
The displacements of non-series lines are functions of their wavelengths .
The evidence indicates that they vary with a power of theyatter , .
at least as great as the third and possibly as great as the sixth .
8 .
There is some reason to believe that there are two values for the displacement of a line at one and the same pressure .
9 .
The mean displacement of the non-series lines is 12'2-thousandths of an , A.U. per atmosphere .
The largest displacement measured is a little more than 2 A.U. at 203 atmospheres.* III .
j Rever None of the copper lines within this region showed any signs of reversal under pressure .
IY .
Relative Intensities .
Within the region W 4000\#151 ; 4600:\#151 ; 1 .
Changes in relative intensities of lines occur under pressure .

Those belonging to either the first or second subordinate series vanish at * Added October 19 , 1908 , \#151 ; G. D. The Effect of Pressure upon Arc Spectra .
about 40 atmospheres and do not reappear as the pressure is increased { obliterated lines ) .
3 .
Members of the first sub-series become at low pressures faint and hazy , almost resembling bands , and are at higher pressures dissipated .
There is , however , always a marked cloudiness in the neighbourhood of their original position .
4 .
Members of the second sub-series gradually diminish in intensity without abnormal widening .
No cloudiness is distinguishable near their original position .
5 .
Of the non-series lines , those that are nebulous are strengthened relatively to those that are sharp .
6 .
Lines strengthened under pressure do not correspond with those given .by other workers as " enhanced " lines .
Y. Brightness of the Arc. The brightness of the copper arc increases enormously with the pressure of the surrounding air .
