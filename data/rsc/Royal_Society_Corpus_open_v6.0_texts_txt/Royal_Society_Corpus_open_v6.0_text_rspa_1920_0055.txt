] I. Introduction .
I he rapid progress in recent years in the investigation of arcing voltages and resonance potentials in metallic vapours and in their relation to ceitain spectral series , which for many elements lie in the extreme ultraviolet region of the spectrum , makes it of great importance to obtain as extensive and as accurate as possible a knowledge of the ultra-violet spectra of the elements .
A stimulus has been given to this work by the recent research of Foot , Roguley , and Mohler , * on the ionisation potential of thallium vapour , and by that of Mohler , Foot , and Stinson , f on the ionisation potential of lead vapour .
The series indicated by their values lie * Foot , Roguley , and Mohler , ' Phys. Rev. , ' vol. 13 , January ( 1919 ) .

Arc Sjpectra in vacuo almost entirely in the Schumann region , which can be studied only , with the fluorite spectrograph or the vacuum grating spectrograph .
The present work is a continuation of that already carried out by McLennan , Ainslie , and Fuller* on the vacuum arc spectra of various metals , and includes a study of the vacuum arc spectra of antimony , bismuth , calcium , magnesium , selenium , copper , and silver , and the spark in helium spectra of aluminium , antimony , bismuth , cadmium , calcium , lead , magnesium , thallium , and tin .
The study of these spectra has been successful in that certain additions to our knowledge of the spectra of these elements has been made in every case .
II .
Apparatus .
The spark spectra , and all but one arc spectrum , were taken on the fluorite spectrograph described by McLennan , Ainslie , and Fuller.f The experimental details were the same as they employed .
In all cases the instrument was washed with hydrogen before commencing an exposure , in order to insure a good vacuum and to remove the last traces of air .
It was comparatively easy to obtain the hard X-ray vacuum , as indicated by the green fluorescence of a Geissler discharge tube attached to the spectrograph , using only the oil-sealed mechanical Trimount pumps .
The arc chamber or " lamp " is shown in fig. 1 , and was found to be uniformly regular in operation .
It consisted essentially of a cylindrical brass vessel enclosed in a larger brass one , so that a water cooling system could be used with the more intense arcs .
From the bottom and the side projected two arms through which the electrodes passed , the apertures being made air-tight by means of oil seals and stuffing-boxes .
In this way the electrodes could be advanced or withdrawn without impairing the vacuum .
The leads to the electrodes were insulated from the case by porcelain bushings at the electrode end , and ebonite at the exterior end .
The arc was , through all the experiments , entirely controlled by hand .
The light for the spectrograph was taken out of the side of the arcing chamber at right angles to the plane containing the electrodes , and a window on the opposite side provided for observation of the arc .
With substances having a high melting point , such as copper , calcium , and silver , the metal in rod form was attached directly to the leads .
The metals of lower melting point were placed in hollow steel electrodes , and the arc chamber rotated through 45 ' , so that the melted metal would not run out .
It was found that the steel did not enter into the arc .
The connection f etween the arcing chamber and the spectroscope was made by a conical brass sleeve * McLennan , Ainslie , and Fuller , ' Roy .

97 the actual joint being made air-tight with a covering of thick-walled pure gum rubber tubing .
This was found to give the desired flexibility at this union .

In studying spark spectra it was decided , since a supply* of helium was available , to use that gas as the atmosphere surrounding the spark .
Its transparency to ultra-violet light is well known as a result of Lyman 's work , * and the fact that its spectrum in the region X 2300 A.U. to X1400 A.U. is extremely meagre , made it especially suitable for such work .
The spark chamber used is shown in fig. 2 .
It consisted essentially of a glass bulb with two side tubes and a well-ground glass tap .
Two steel electrodes , having at their tips the metal to be studied , were inserted into the spark chamber through rubber stoppers , which were firmly fitted into the side tubes .
A conical brass fitting , closed with a fluorite window , was waxed on to the large side tube .
It was found that this arrangement provided an airtight chamber and yet allowed ready adjustment of the electrodes when they become too widely separated .
The distance between the spark gap and the fluorite window was about 8 cm .
To fill the bulb with helium it was connected in series with two cocoanut charcoal tubes to the Trimount pumps .
The whole was thoroughly evacuated , the charcoal tubes being heated during the pumping , before the liquid air was applied to them .
In this way an extremely hard vacuum was obtainable in the bulb .
The helium was then permitted to enter through the two * Lyman , { Spectroscopy of the Extreme Ultra-violet .

Arc 'Spectra in vacuo cocoanut charcoal tubes in liquid air until atmospheric pressure was reached .
The tap was then turned off and the apparatus was ready for use .
As the helium available had already been purified to approximately 98 per cent , purity , it is thought that the gas admitted to the bulb must have been of very high purityAs it was found that a Clapp-Eastham transformer generating 10,000 volts was insufficient to give more than a weak spark , other arrangements had to be devised .
A quite satisfactory method was to join the terminals of a 20-inch induction coil to a spark gap in air and to the inside coatings of two Leyden jars .
The outside coatings of these jars were joined to the electrodes of the spark chamber .
In this way a heavy discharge could be obtained when the spark in air was l|-2 inches between spheres of cm .
in diameter .
III .
Method of Determining Wave-lengths .
In calculating the wave-lengths of the lines of the spectra , the method of hyperbolic interpolation by means of a Hartmann dispersion formula was used .
The standard lines employed were obtained from Eder and Valenta 's Atlas , Lyman 's measurement of the aluminium spark , and the measurement of the arc spectra of carbon , tin and lead as found by McLennan , Ainslie , and Fuller .
Schumann plates , prepared by the Adam Hilger Co. , were used throughout in recording the spectra .
The plates were measured with a Toepler comparator , and the average of results from several plates was used Calibration Wave-Lengths .

in each case in the final , calculation .
The three lines used as the basis of the dispersion formula were chosen each time to suit the range of spectrum to be calculated .
In view of the comparatively small dispersion of the spectrograph , and the combined error of the standard lines and the dispersion formula , a greater accuracy than 05 A.U. cannot be claimed for all the measurements , though in the region of shorter wave-lengths where the dispersion is greater the error is possibly as small as 0*3 A.U.

Results .
1 .
Antimony.\#151 ; The most recent work on the antimony arc is that of Takamine and Nitta , * who measured its spectrum as far as X1858'0 A.U. in both arc and spark .
The spectrum has been extended to about X 1450 A.U. In the experiments a fairly steady arc , in vacuo , was obtained by putting chemically pure antimony in steel electrodes , and using a current of from 5-6 amperes at 110 volts .
As shown in Table I , the spectrum contained several fairly strong lines in the region below X 1850 A.U. and extended well down to X 1400 A.U. For convenience in reference the antimony spark spectrum is included in the same Table as the results obtained by Takamine and Nitta and Bloch.f It will be noted that in the region covered by other observers the agreement is fairly good , though all their lines have not been recorded , and for this reason have been omitted from the Table .
2 .
Bismuth.\#151 ; The bismuth arc was obtained by using chemically pure bismuth metal in steel electrodes , a bright intermittent arc being struck with from 5-10 amperes at 200 volts .
In Table II are given the results of the bismuth arc and spark spectra , together with the measurements of the bismuth spark , by MM .
L. et E. Bloch .
} Although in the present work many of their lines are missing , the agreement of those obtained is quite good .
The spectrum has been extended to about X 1435 A.U. 3 .
Calcium.\#151 ; For the calcium arc rod electrodes cut from larger pieces were used , thus obviating the necessity for the steel cups .
With a current of from 10-15 amperes at 200 volts a very brilliant and steady arc was easily produced .
It was found that the calcium metal was not rapidly used up in the arc , and repeated exposures could be taken without replacing the electrodes .
For purposes of comparison , included in Table III are the values * Takamine and Nitta , ' Memoirs of the College of Science , ' Kyoto Imperial University , vol. 2 , No. 2 ( 1917 ) .

Attempts were made to photograph the strontium and barium arc spectra by using the fused chloride in carbon electrodes , but with little success .
The last lines recorded in strontium was the doublet X 2165'99 A.U. and X 2152*91 A.U. , and in barium the doublet X233527 A.U. and X 2304-36 A.U. 4 .
Magnesium.\#151 ; Owing to the noticeable difference between the values obtained for the magnesium in hydrogen by Lyman , * and for the spark in air by Handke , f it seemed of some importance to remeasure the spectrum of this element as given by the arc in vacuo and by the spark in helium .
The results are in close agreement with those of Lyman , with the exception that the line X 1828T A.U. is recorded only in the arc spectrum and not in the spark at all .
Handke does not record this line in the spark , but his other * Lyman , loc. cit. + Handke , loc. cit. i 2 102 Prof. J. C. McLennan and others .

The experimental details were quite simple .
Powdered selenium metal was placed in hollow carbon electrodes in the arc chamber .
When the arc was struck between the carbons the selenium boiled up through it and its spectrum was emitted .
The carbon lines were eliminated by comparison photographs of the carbon arc alone .
The'spectrum was quite rich in lines well spread throughout the range of the spectrograph .
The results are given in the following Table :\#151 ; Table V.\#151 ; Selenium .

There is apparently little similarity between the arc and spark spectra of this element , and for this reason values of the arc spectrum have not been included with the others in Table IX .
The results show that a slight extension of the spark spectrum has been made .

Lead._The spark spectrum of the element does not seem to have been previously measured in the region below X , 1850 A.U. , although the arc spectrum has been measured by several observers .
The present work has .extended the spark spectrum to about X 1555 A.U. For reference the arc measurements of Saunders* are included in Table X , and it will be seen that our values are in good agreement with the corresponding lines in the arc .

Thallium.\#151 ; The spark spectrum of thallium has been measured to X 1814-72 A.U. by Saunders , f but no other observations appear to have been made .
The arc has been recently studied by McLennan , Ainslie , and Fullerj and a considerable extension of the spectrum made .
In the present work it has been found that some similarity exists between the arc and spark spectra in the fluorite region , but in addition to their values we have recorded some five new lines in the region below X 1850 A.U. In Table XI are given the measurements along with those of other observers .

Tin.\#151 ; Although the spark spectrum of tin has already been studied by Handke , S and many lines recorded in the range of spectrum down to X 1700 A.U. , it was thought worth while to make a remeasurement of it under the different conditions of our experiments .
Surprisingly few lines were found on our plates compared with the number given by Handke .
The arc spectrum is much richer in lines than the spark spectrum which seems somewhat unusual .
Our values are a little lower than Handke 's but are in good agreement with the arc lines of McLennan , Ainslie , and Fuller.|| The results are given in Table XII .
