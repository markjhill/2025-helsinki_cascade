A paper was read , entitled " On certain variations of the mean height of the Barometer , mean temperature and depth of Rain , connected with the Lunar Phases , in the cycle of years from 1815 to 1823 .
" By Luke Howard , Esq. , F.R.S. The table given in this paper contains the results of calculations relating to the objects specified in the title ; cast into periods of six , seven , or eight days , so as to bring the day of the lunar phase be ?
longing to it in the middle of the time .
The observations were all made in the neighbourhood of London .
It appears from them that in the period of the last quarter of the moon the barometer is highest , the temperature a little above the mean , and the depth of rain the smallest .
In the period of the new moon , both the barometer and temperature are considerably depressed , and the rain increased in quantity .
The influence of the first quarter shows itself by the further depression of the barometer ; but the temperature rises almost to the point from which it had fallen , and the rain still increases , but not in an equal ratio .
Lastly , the full moon again reduces the temperature ; while the barometer attains its maximum mean height , and the quantity of rain is the greatest .
Thus it appears , that during this lunar cycle , the approach of the last quarter is the signai for the clearing up of the air , and the return of sun ?
shine .
