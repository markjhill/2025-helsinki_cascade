Received December 17 , 1857 , --Read January 14 , 1858 .
THE first part of this paper contained the results of the examination of those hydrocarbons found in the distillate from the Torbane-hill mineral which were remarkable for their resistance to the action of monohydrated nitric and sulphuric acids .
It was shown that , when in a state of purity , they possessed the composition , boiling-point , and density in the fluid and gaseous states , of the radicals of the ethylic class of alcohols .
The present communication enters on the study of a group of substances as distinguished by the mobility , as the former are by the fixity of their hydrogen atoms .
The examination of them has involved more labour than was experienced with their companion hydrocarbons ; and the quantities obtained being necessarily small , even when working on a considerable scale , it has been impossible , at present , to do more than determine their constitution .
The study of their combinations and decompositions is therefore necessarily deferred .
Up to the present time we have been unacquainted with methods for the proximate analysis of complex mixtures such as that under study .
It was necessary , therefore , to devise some plan for the purpose .
The presence of benzole and its homologues was almost a matter of certainty , as they appear to be formed in all processes where coaly or bituminous matters are subjected to destructive distillation .
In order to separate the hydrocarbons , the following method was adopted .
Four ounces of bromine being placed in a large and well-stoppered flask , about eight volumes of water were added .
The naphtha boiling in the fourteenth rectification between 71 ?
and 77 ?
Centigrade , was then added in very small portions , the whole being violently agitated after each addition .
As the bromine , from its superior density , lay at the bottom of the water and the naphtha at the top , it will be seen that combination could not take place until the flask was shaken , at which time they united with a sharp hissing sound and a rise of temperature .
The entire quantity of naphtha was absorbed by the bromine , forming a dense oil , becoming paler and at last colourless as the hydrocarbon increased in quantity .
To ensure a definite product more bromine was used , so as to obtain a red oil , the excess being afterwards removed by agitation with mercury .
During the process some substance is generated , acting powerfully on the eyes and causing a flow of tears ; it is always present in the brominated oil , even when every trace of free bromine is removed .
If the brominated oil be kept for some time in contact with water , it will be found that a third layer will make its appearance beneath the oil ; this will be described hereafter , On the crude bromine compound being separated and distilled , all the benzole and radicals will distil away , leaving the brominated oil , the boiling-point of which is much higher .
We are not acquainted with any process for separating benzole from the radicals in such a manner as to yield the former pure , but by treatment with fuming nitric acid , in the manner described in Part I. , the benzole is transformed into the nitrocompound , from which the propyle may be obtained by distillation on the water-bath .
It was necessary to ascertain whether the nitrocompound obtained by treating with nitric acid the fluid distilling away from the brominated oil , contained any substance ( save nitrobenzole ) capable of .
forming alkaloids by reduction .
On treatment by BECHAMP'S process , it yielded a considerable quantity of base having all the characters of aniline , and distilling at 182 ? .
To confirm this result a portion was dissolved in hydrochloric acid , and to the solution was added about a third of the quantity of bichloride of platinum necessary to precipitate the whole of the base in the state of platinum salt .
The precipitate being filtered off , a fresh quantity of the bichloride was added , and so on until three precipitates were obtained .
They were washed with a mixture of alcohol and ether previous to drying .
I. '5197 gramme of the first precipitate gave -4726 carbonic acid and '1359 water .
II .
'2980 gramme of the first precipitate gave '0972 platinum .
III .
-5196 gramme of the second precipitate gave -4668 carbonic acid and *1359 water .
IV .
'3408 gramme of the second precipitate gave *1112 platinum .
V. -3447 gramme of the third precipitate gave -1128 platinum .

32'6 32'6 32-7 Pt 99'0 33'0 299*5 100'0 It is evident , therefore , that the aniline procured in this manner is almost pure , the only admixture being a small portion of toluidine ; and it may with safety be concluded that benzole is the only hydrocarbon ( distilling away from the brominized oil ) which forms a nitrocompound capable of reduction by protacetate of iron .
If the bromine compound obtained from the naphtha boiling between 71 ?
and 77 ?
be distilled , a thermometer being in the tubulature of the retort , no constant boiling-point will be obtained until a temperature of 123 ?
is reached .
This arises from the tenacity with which the oil retains benzole and the radicals .
It was only after much labour and numerous analyses that this source of difficulty was discovered , and precautions taken to prevent its interfering with the isolation of the hydrocarbons to be presently described .
If the heat be very gradually applied to the retort , ebullition will commence at about 80 ?
, 738 the mercury rapidly rising until 1230 is reached , after which the rise becomes very slow .
When the propyle and benzole have distilled away , and the point of ebullition of the fluid is elevated to 150 ?
or upwards , rapid evolution of hydrobromic acid takes place , accompanied by a vapour acting powerfully on the eyes .
The distillate at this point acquires a fine blue colour .
It being plain from these phenomena that the hyperhalyde produced by the action of bromine could not be prepared in a state fit for analysis , the residue in the retort was mixed with a strong alcoholic solution of potash , in order to obtain a halyde capable of being distilled without decomposition .
On mixing the two fluids there was a great rise of temperature , and a large quantity of bromide of potassium crystallized out .
Sometimes the bromine compound and the alcoholic potash were cohobated together , at others the halyde was prepared by mere digestion of the ingredients and subsequent precipitation of the oil by water ; even cohobation over solid hydrate of potash produced the same result .
The brominated oil thus prepared was colourless , very dense , and had a powerful odour , somewhat resembling iodide of amyle .
Although the hyperhalyde was prepared from a fraction of almost constant boiling-point , and purified carefully by distillation on the oil-bath , all coming over below 130 ?
being rejected , yet the halyde produced from it was not homogeneous , its boiling-point varying from 80 ?
to 150 ? .
MM .
BERTHELOT and DE LUCA have shown in their memoir on iodized propylene the great difficulty of obtaining pure products of this class , owing to the simultaneous formation of other substances , both fixed and volatile ; and it is evident that if such a difficulty is found with that substance , it must exist to a much greater extent with a homologue having so comparatively high an atomic weight as that yielding the compound under consideration .
In order to lessen the sources of error , the bromine compound was fractionated previous to analysis , but , despite every precaution , numerous and perfectly concordant analyses showed the impossibility of obtaining it free from oxygen .
This arose from the mode of preparation .
The formula of the brominated oil was , originally , C12 H " Br , but oxidation had proceeded so far as to make the composition almost agree with the expression C'2 H1 BrO .
The cause of the oxidation of the monobrominated caproylene or hexylene will become apparent from the following experiments .
It has been said that when the hydrocarbons were treated with bromine in presence of water , the fluid separated after a time into three layers , the upper being water containing a small quantity of hydrobromic acid , the middle the brominated oil , and a lower stratum .
The latter , on separation by a tap-funnel , proved to be highly acid and perfectly soluble in water .
It distilled , with very little evolution of acid fumes , at 127 ? .
A piece of paper moistened with it and held near the fire , became jet-black at the spot touched .
Excess of precipitated carbonate of lime was added , and , as soon as effervescence had ceased , the whole was boiled for a few minutes and filtered .
The solution evaporated to dryness yielded a white and highly deliquescent mass , a qualitative analysis of which indicated the presence of bromine and calcium .
A portion was heated to redness , rapidly cooled in a platinum crucible with a well-fitting lid , and the percentage of calcium estimated .

The preceding salt being deliquescent , and consequently not convenient for analysis , I digested a fresh portion of the acid upon carbonate of baryta , the latter being in excess ; the-solution was boiled , filtered and evaporated to dryness on the water-bath .
After two hours ' desiccation at 1000 , it gave on a determination of the barium 43-67 per cent. , corresponding to the formula Ba Br , HO ; requiring 43-53 .
By ignition the percentage of barium was raised to 46*8 .
Ba Br requires 46 16 .
During ignition the salt became grey , but regained its original appearance when moistened with water .
A determination of the per-centage of dry hydrobromic acid in the fluid was next made .

37-2 36-96 The specific gravity of the fluid obtained in this singular manner was 1.320 at 18 ? .
The small quantity of fumes evolved during the distillation points to the existence of a definite hydrate ; H Br+ 15HO would contain 37-5 of hydrobromic acid , a number not far from that found by experiment .
The reason for examining thus minutely the lower layer of liquid , was to trace the nature of the reaction resulting in the production of the oxidized fluid , It is plain that water was decomposed by the excess of bromine ; the oxidation therefore resembled that produced by the halogens generally .
The examination of the bromine compounds was not pursued further because their products of decomposition appeared more interesting .
The results detailed render it evident that the only method of studying satisfactorily the C " Hue group as it existed in the oily fluid would be by means of its derivatives .
It is well known that bodies of this class must , after the action of alcoholic potash , be regarded as bearing the same relation to the negative that the hydriodic ethers do to the positive radicals .
Like them , the halogen compounds , when decomposed by metals , yield hydrocarbons , having , for four volumes of vapour , double the number of atoms of carbon and hydrogen existing in the iodides , bromides , &amp;c. , and these hydrocarbons or radicals , as they are still called , have consequently a higher boiling-point than if the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms remained the same .
Thus propylene , C6 H6 , is a gas , while allyle , the negative radical , C12 H1 ?
, is a fluid boiling at 59 ? .
It was therefore probable that the hydrocarbon , C2 H12 , would , by treatment of the bromine compound with sodium , yield a derivative boiling at about 116 ? .
For the purpose of acting on the bromine compound with sodilum , a small glass retort 7'40 was used , into the tubulature of which a large pipette was fastened by means of a cork .
The neck of the retort was closed .
The pipette being removed and the bromine compound introduced , some freshly-cut fragments of sodium were added .
The pipette being returned to its place , the whole was allowed to remain until the action of the sodium , at first energetic , became sluggish in consequence of a coating of bromide covering the metal .
Gentle heat was then applied , upon which the fluid entered into ebullition , but the vapours condensing in the pipette constantly returned to the retort .
During the reaction the sodium acquired a superb blue colour , reminding us of the phenomena observed by M. Bouis when acting on chloride of capryle with the same metal..The addition of the sodium was continued until no more action occurred , upon which the pipette was removed and the fluid distilled over .
To ensure absence of bromine , it was once more rectified over sodium , but the metal remained perfectly brilliant until the end of the operation , The fluid thus procured was not the only product , for the bromide of potassium in the retort was mixed with greasy and carbonaceous matters .
The hydrocarbon sutbmitted to a fractional distillation , came over at 71 ?
, instead of 116 ?
, as would have been the case if the bromine had reacted with sodium in an analogous manner to iodized propylene .
The following are the analyses of this fluid : I. '1677 gramme yielded '5251 of carbonic acid and '2164 water .
II .
-1703 gramme yielded -5354 carbonic acid and -2178 water .

To determine the value of n , I determined the density of the vapour of the fluid .
The operation was performed in an apparatus permitting the experiment to be made at any desired pressure .
It was originally intended to ascertain the density at several pressures ; the experiment was consequently commenced with an extra column of 205 5 millimetres of mercury , the atmospheric pressure being 759'2 .
The elastic force of the vapour was therefore equal to a column of mercury 964-7 millimetres in height .
On consideration , the idea of making more than one experiment with the vapour of this hydrocarbon was abandoned until its formation had been repeated several times .

=0-0692 X24=1-6608 11-6088 =2-9022 4 The excess is partly due to the extra pressure , but chiefly to the presence of a little C14 H14 .
The fluid procured in this manner is therefore caproylene or hexylene .
Its formation by the process detailed is interesting , because it is an instance of the regeneration of a hydrocarbon by means of a complex decomposition similar to that found by MM .
BERTHELOT and DE LUCA to occur with propylene .
The hexylene is not therefore a mere product of decomposition in the ordinary sense of the term , but is identical in kind with the fluid in the naphtha which yielded the bromine compound .
This is proved by the identity of boiling-point .
The naphtha distilled between 71 ?
and 77 ?
, and the hexylene produced from it boiled at 71 ? .
Hexylene was discovered by FREMYt among the products of the distillation of hydroleic and metoleic acids .
Bouis found that chloride of capryle treated with sodium in the cold yielded capryle , but that if the reaction took place with heat , caprylene resulted .
It appearing probable from this that the products of the action of sodium on the bromine compounds would vary with the temperature , I repeated my experiments with the necessary precautions .
With the view of obtaining the next homologue of hexylene , the fraction boiling between 82 ?
and 88 ?
was selected .
About twelve ounces of bromine were saturated with naphtha in the same manner as before , but , during the treatment of the brominated oil with sodium ( after the action of alcoholic potash ) , all rise of temperature was carefully avoided , the apparatus being constantly covered with cold water .
The decomposition is of course more gradual than when heat is applied , but it is quite as perfect .
" I have been occupied at intervals during the last two years in ascertaining the amount of influence exercised by pressure on vapour volume , and also in endeavouring to improve the processes generally used for determining the densities of vapours .
I hope before long to communicate these results to the Society .
In the meantime some values obtained with propyle are annexed , to give an idea of the extent to which the density is increased by pressure .

From these results it is evident that the products of the action of sodium do not vary with the temperature .
They also fully confirm the statement , made in another part of this paper , to the effect that the hydrocarbons produced by the processes detailed are identical with those existing in the Boghead naphtha .
It will be remembered that the naphtha , from which the bromine compound yielding the heptylene was obtained , boiled between 82 ?
and 88 ?
, and the hydrocarbon produced by the action of sodium on the bromine compound came over between 85 ?
and 99 ? .
The decomposition which the bromine compound undergoes is by no means simple , large quantities of difficultly combustible charcoal separating , with production of small but distinct traces of fatty acids .
Little is known with regard to the true boiling-points of the C " HI series .
Those which have been most examined , and consequently appear best adapted for standards with which to compare the boiling-points of the other homologues , do not agree with 743 each other .
The boiling-point of amylene , according to FRANKLAND , is 350 ; that of octylene was determined by CAHOUBS to be 108 ?
, while Bouis found it 125 ? .

APPENDIX .
Since the reading of the above , I have seen some experiments recently published by LIM1PRCHT on the action of perchloride of phosphorus on cenanthole ? .
He finds the product to be chloride of cenanthylene , C14 H14 Cl2 .
By treatment with sodium ' he obtains cnanthylene ( heptylene ) , boiling at 950 .
By first treating the chloride with alcoholic potash to obtain C14 H1 3Cl , and then with sodium , he expected , as I did , to obtain C"4 H13 , or rather ( for 4 volumes of vapour ) C28 H26 .
The resulting fluid , however , boiled at 950 , and had all the properties of heptylene .
One not very satisfactory analysis agreed better with C4 H'13 than C'4 H1'4 , but he admits that the properties of the hydrocarbon agreed so exactly with cnanthylene , that he could not insist on the accuracy of C4 H'13 as the true formula .
My experiments , by proving the regeneration of cenanthylene by the action of sodium on C4 HI13 Br , show the true nature of M. LIMPRICHT'S result .
M , LIMPRICHT states C14 I13 Cl to be without action on sodium at ordinary temperatures ; this difference between the chlorine and bromine compounds is curious and worthy of examination , " By distillation of hydroleic and metoleic acids .
