GENTLEMEN , -The time has arrived when I must offer for your acceptance a connected report of the employment of the instruments entrusted to me for the special purpose of observing the late solar eclipse .
1 .
Plan of this Report .
In framing this Report I propose in the first place to describe those instruments sufficiently in detail to render unnecessary such explanations as would otherwise be required in the course of my narrative , and then to show the circumstances which preceded their actual employment on that occasion .
2 .
Description of Telescope and clockwork .
The principal instrument is an equatorially mounted telescope , with a lens of 5 inches aperture and 62 inches focal length .
The mounting is adapted to any latitude ( except very low and very high ones ) , the polar axis being a moveable tangent to the circular-arched roof of the chamber containing the clockwork .
The latter , as well as the rest of the instrument , is by Messrs. Cooke and Sons , of York , and is , as I understood from Mr. Cooke , of a somewhat novel description .
I have not examined the mechanism closely , and therefore cannot describe itvery accurately ; but I believe the peculiarity consists in the maintenance of continuous motion in a fan-wheel , regulated by a pendulum time-keeper acted on through a remontoir escapement , whereby the irregularity of the surplus energy of the driving-weight , while it is prevented by the latter from interfering with the time-keeper at all , is modifed in its action on the tube by the former .
The mean rate of motion is 104 [ Nov. 19 , thus uniform ; and though there is very perceptible irregularity in the actual motion , it is not intermittent .
Thus , when the image of a star , for instance , is brought on the slit of the spectrum-apparatus , the spectrum is fitful in appearance , if the slit is perpendicular to the direction of diurnal motion .
The mean motion may be easily regulated as in a pendulum-clock .
The motion is communicated by friction to the first of a series of wheels which terminates in an endless screw working in the circumference of a large toothed arc attached to the hour-axis .
Motion imparted by hand to one of these wheels , grooved and provided for this purpose with an endless cord , is thus communicated directly to the tube without greater strain on the clock than is implied in overcoming the connecting friction .
3 .
Its MIounting .
The declination-axis terminates in a T-shaped head carrying two circular collars , in which the telescope-tube rests .
For convenience in mounting and dismounting , these collars are attached to the T-head by nut and pins , so that they lift off with the tube , while the balance can be adjusted by releasing their grasp of the tube when required .
This is a great convenience in a portable instrument .
The tube can be dismouinted and taken indoors readily without assistance ; and the body of the instrument ( which , besides being far less easily handled , has cost hours of adjustment ) may be left under a suitable waterproof case when no observatory has been constructed .
4 .
Its Stand .
The stand is a strong wooden one , of remarkably firm construction , considering that it is of the three-legged portable kind .
Its upper surface is a stout brass annulus , on which the clock-chamber rests and rotates , if required , for adjustment in azimuth .
Two of the legs have foot-screws for adjusting the level and completing the adjustment for latitude .
5 .
Of the Sectroscope .
The spectroscope intended for use with the above telescope was constructed by Messrs. Simms , on a pattern or design supplied ( I believe ) by Mr. Huggins ; but its construction was too much delayed to allow of a practical examination of all its parts before packing .
It consists of a single flint-glass prism , of refracting angle 60 ?
, contained in a cylindrical brass chamber , from which radiate three tubes in such directions as to fulfil the several purposes of ( 1 ) receiving the light to be analyzed , ( 2 ) delivering it after refraction and separation to the eye , and ( 3 ) admitting external light for reflection to the eye off the second surface of the prism .
The first consists externally of a long connecting tube for insertion into the telescope in place of the ordinary eye-tube , where it is grasped in the focusing-slide .
Internally it carries a smaller tube , carrying at one end a lens , and at the other , at the principal focal distance of the latter , a beautiful piece of workmanship by which a slit is obtained whose sides i2 1868 .
] approach each other equally .
Half the length of this slit may be obscured by the intervention of a right-angled prism , which reflects a side light through it if required .
The converging rays from the object-glass falling on the slit are admitted , while those which do not are stopped .
The former diverging again , as though from a luminous line , emerge from the next lens and fall on the prism as parallel rays , are independently refracted and dispersed in traversing it , and after emergence are again condensed , but not reunited , by the object-glass in the small telescope composing the second of the above-mentioned tubes , and , forming a spectrum in its focus , are viewed as such by an eyepiece .
Mleans of measurement.--The direction of emergence defines the position in the spectrum ; and the difference of direction is measured by the change of direction of the small telescope necessary to receive the several refracted rays directly .
This change of direction is effected and measured by a tangent screw , whose complete revolutions are indicated by the march of a graduated scale ( attached to the telescope-arm ) over a circle marked on the circumference of the divided cylindrical head of the screw .
The position of the centre of motion of the telescope-arms , it should be said , though optically unimportant , is practically within the prism .
By the help of a reading-lens the revolutions , and tenths and hundredths of a revolution , can be easily read off by a very slight movement of the eye from the eyepiece .
New graduated Scale for micrometer measures.-A mistake having occurred in graduating the scale , I substituted one of my own making .
As I was fortunate in this , I may venture to describe how it was effected .
The graduation required was too fine for any ink lines I could make ; I therefore varnished a piece of card , and drew fine lines at the proper intervals on the shellac-coating with a sharp blade ; and applying a little ink , these were instantly rendered visible .
I then cut the card across the lines and glued the scale so formed over the old one with varnish , giving the whole a dash of varnish for the sake of protection .
When dry I was gratified to find the graduation correspond well with the revolutions ; for it was rather a delicate job , and I did not succeed without failures .
6 .
Graduated Scale in the Field of View .
The third tube was intended to present in the field of view of the telescope last described , by external reflection off the second surface of the prisr , an illuminated image of a photographed scale placed at one end of the tube , in the principal focus of a lens at the other .
The tube carries a small moveable mirror outside .
Upon this mirror was intended to be thrown the light of a small lamp , held n position by a bent arm projecting from the prism-chamber .
I am sorry to say that this ingenious contrivance proved , in my hands , more unsatisfactory than perhaps it should have done .
As in not using it I departed from the letter of my instructions , I am in a measure bound to explain my reasons for discarding it .
Reasonsfor discarding it .
In the first place , I never could with any kind of illumination train my eye to read the scale , partly because ( whether from diffraction or irradiation ) the image was never distinct , partly because the figures were illegible .
In the next place the little lamp was capricious ; either it refused to keep alight , or it boiled its own oil and melted off its handles , and ended by burning my fingers !
Thirdly , it was an additional weight at the eye-end of the telescope and involved a counterpoise when not in use , and an additional projection to be avoided in every movement in the dark , -all implying additional distractions and sources of failure .
Lastly , I found I could do very well without it-in the preliminary training which I underwent on examining the nebulae .
At the same time I must confess that I made an oversight in trusting too much to the illuminating power of a hand-lamp , as will be apparent when I come to describe the actual eclipse-observations .
7 .
Smaller Telescopes and Polarizers .
The second instrument supplied was an achromatic refractor of 3 inches aperture mounted with vertical and horizontal axes , the socket of the former being supported on a three-legged wooden stand , afterwards replaced by one of greater stability and more convenient height .
Two cells , containing a double-image prism and quartz plate , and the combination known as Savart 's polariscope , respectively , were supplied for use with this telescope , but without any connecting adaptation .
8 .
Hand Spectroscopes .
The other instruments were hand spectroscopes for direct vision , four in number , which I was directed to distribute according to circumstances , It is needless to describe these instruments , as they are well known ; but I must venture to correct a statement made at a meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society last December , that they have a magnifying-power of 8 or 10 .
I do n't think they can be credited with a higher power than 3 ; and I was never able to recognize any of the peculiar characteristics of nebular or stellar spectra , the recognition of which might have been expected with the higher magnifying-power .
9 .
Arrival in India and communication with Colonel Walker , R.E. Soon after my arrival in India I communicated with Colonel Walker , with the object of receiving his instructions and of ascertaining whether hie had decided on any plan , and , if not , to learn his views with reference to the assistance I might expect from the Survey Establishment .
The choice of a station of observation and the disposal of the instruments were also discussed in the course of correspondence .
10 .
His Reply , and application to the Indian Government .
Colonel Walker 's action in this matter has been most gratifying .
He immediately promised me the assistance of Lieut. W. Maxwell CampbelI , of the Bombay Engineers , one of the executive officers of our Department , at that time engaged with myself and others in measuring a base-line in the neighbourhood of Bangalore , for the polarization-observations or otherwise , as I might arrange with him .
He also placed at my future disposal forth occasion the services of Lieut. Campbell 's assistants , in case such should be required , at the same time presenting to the Indian Government an urgent proposal to give the Royal Society 's expedition both countenance and support .
I enclose a copy of the reply to this proposal , in which it will be observed that the Governor General in Council " cordially approves , " and " sanctions the necessary expenditure , " and pledges the Government " to do everything in its power towards securing fill and accurate observations " on the occasion-a pledge fully redeemed by the ready assent given to more than one other application .
I am accordingly enabled to submit to your Society my present Report unaccompanied by any further appeal to your Treasurer .
11 .
Step-s taken to procure local information as to weather c. The local Governments were also applied to to give effect to the circulation of a series of queries calculated to elicit local information as to probable climate at numerous points situated along the line of shadow .
This was the more necessary , as my position at Bangalore ( in the very centre of the peninsula ) seemed to give a so much greater range of choice .
In this respect also a warm interest was evinced .
I wish I could add that the mass of correspondence which resulted was productive of an equal amount of valuable information .
The practical value was chiefly confined to extracts from rain-registers , the principal question relating to probable cloudiness or otherwise being perhaps necessarily replied to too vaguely to form legitimate grounds for decision , owing in great measure to the fact that August is one of the most uncertain months in the year , in that respect , in southern India .
Rough notion of rain distribution across the peninsula in August.-On the whole , however , it appeared that across the whole width of the peninsula cloudy weather was to be expected at that season ; and there was therefore no choice but what could be based on rainfall .
The annexed diagram represents the impression ( necessarily a vague one ) remaining on my mind after considering the reports .
On the west coast anything up to 25 inches a week has been recorded in August ; on the eastern slopes of the western Ghauts the fall seems both smaller and more regular , 6 to 10 inches being the usual fall in the month of August .
Further inland we come to a tract notorious for its dryness , several places , such as Gokak , Jamkandi , Bejapuir , and others thereabouts , being favoured with occasional showers only .
I attributed this to the descent into a lower and hotter region of the prevailing south-west current , the greater part of whose moisture had been deposited during the disturbance of strata caused by passing over the sudden barrier of the Ghauts .
Beyond this again , eastwards , their is a gradual rise in the amount due in August , until towards the east coast the average fall is again 6 or 8 inches .
12 .
Jamkandi selected .
Jamkandi , the residence of a native chief , was among the first to attract my attention , partly owing to the offers of assistance which were made in the name of the chief ; and this place was eventually selected for the advantages of climate which it appeared to offer .
13 .
Distribution of the Instruments .
Lieut. Campbell , R.E. In the meantime the distribution of the instruments was attended to .
The smaller telescope with polarizing eyepieces was made over to Lieut. Campbell with a copy of the " Instructions , " in the full assurance that he would acquaint himself with the theory and practice necessary to turn them to account .
I annex a copy of his Report , the perusal of which will show that the instrument was in good hands .
It is much to be regretted that he was not permitted to give more practical evidence of the forethought which characterized his prepaA rations .
I am also sorry that he has not given a fullerdescription of the ingenious contrivance which he designed and constructed for the ready application of the analyzers to the eyepiece .
The annexed rough sketch ( from memory ) mayhelp to give a correct idea of the contrivance .
I apprehend that in the event of fair weather he would be able to settle the question of polarity readily , and would have leisure to make use of a hand spectroscope as well .
One of these instruments also was therefore made over to him .
14 .
Captain Itaig , R.E. Colonel Walker had further consented to allow another of our executive officers ( Captain Haig , R.E. ) to leave his regular duties for a time if he wished .
As he was stationed at Poona and could avail himself of the railway as far as the border of the shadow 's path , I offered him , and he accepted , the charge of another of the hand spectroscopes .
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company 's Agent , Captain Henry , Superintendent at Bombay .
Lastly , I communicated with the agents of the Peninsular and Oriental Company at Calcutta and Madras Bay , and eventually entrusted the remaining two spectroscopes to the latter for employment on board two vessels , outwardand homeward-bound , which would probably be on the track at the right time .
16 .
Memorandum of explanations and suggestions for use of Hand Spectroscopes .
It was necessary , however , not only to distribute these instruments , but also to provide for their being intelligently employed in unpractised hands .
I accordingly drew up a short memorandum with the object of putting it into the power of those interested to understand as much of the subject as seemed necessary , and of suggesting the probable appearances which might be presented .
A copy of the pamphlet accompanies this Report .
1 7 .
Examination of Nebul &amp; e as bearing on the main subject .
While these arrangements were in progress I was myself engaged with the equatorial in the examination of the southern nebulae , to which I devoted as much time as the duties of my profession enabled me to do .
The weather was very favourable in March ( towards the middle of which month the base-line was completed ) , in April , and until the middle of May ; but from that time until the latter end of June , when the instrument had to be despatched , I hardly got a single observation , owing to the setting-in of the south-west monsoon .
I congratulated myself on having been able to use the fine nights we had had .
The results , showing the nature of the spectra of about fifty nebulae , have been already communicated to your Secretary ; there is therefore no occasion to enter into particulars on this subject here , except as bearing on instrumental peculiarities not previously touched upon , and as suggesting the probability that a considerable familiarity with the special kind of observation had been acquired , as well as with the individual instrument .
Those who are acquainted with the spectroscope as applied to a telescope will remember that it involves several additional screws to be attended to , and that the finding of these mechanically in the dark is no inconsiderable perplexity until habit has taught the way .
But this by the way .
18 .
The Finder , and the trouble it gave .
The finder attached to the telescope has a very low magnifying-power and decidedly bad definition-so much so that even Saturn can scarcely be recognized with it ; none but the most conspicuous nebulae and clusters are visible ; I have looked in vain for the planetary nebula in Lyra with it , though it was certainly in the field ; and of all the planetary nebulae in the southern hemisphere , only two ( Nos. 2102 &amp; 4510 ) are noted by me as " visible in finder .
" It was therefore almost always necessary to find with the principal , by the setting ; and afterwards either to exchange the light eyepiece for the heavy spectroscope ( removing at the same time a counterpoise ) without disturbing the direction , if possible , or to take the bearings of the most conspicuous stars visible in the finder .
But as there never was and never could be any certainty that in the act of insertion a disturbance sufficient to displace the image from the position the slit should occupy would not take place , the latter method became the surest , if the most troublesome .
[ The connecting-tube , I should remark , cost me , literally , days of worry and grinding before I could induce it to slide in and out at all .
] If after these precautions the result of a blind search was negative , the whole had to be done de novo .
What with removing and replacing the spectroscope , inserting eyepieces and 'counterpoises , setting the readings , searching in both finder and telescope , winding the driving-clock over and over again , in endless combination , all by the light of a bull's-eye lantern , perhaps without catching a single spectrum all night , I often found four or five hours ' observing ( ?
) more fatiguing than a long walk .
It may appear strange that I did not replace the finder by a better telescope .
I can only say that India is not England , and Bangalore is not London .
The idea did not occur to me as a practical one , and I was nervously afraid of making any alteration which might leave me worse off than I was .
A bad finder was after all no great matter , for the eclipse and the nebule could wait .
At the same time I wish now that my finder had been more serviceable as a telescope for I got ; but a poor sight of the eclipse with it .
19 .
Further preparations , Observatory , yc .
To return to my preparations .
In the utter absence of any precise knowledge of the appearances which would be presented , but anticipating a faint spectrum as the most probable , all my preliminary arrangements had in view as complete an exclusion of external light as practicable .
A wooden frame was constructed for an observatory with a revolving roof , the latter being covered with painted canvas .
A large black curtain was provided , through the centre of which were to be passed the observing-end of the telescope and finder , and the declination-clamp and slow-motion screw .
A segment of the octagonal observing-chamber would thus be in a great measure protected from the light which might be expected to enter the limited aperture in the roof .
20 .
The Expedition leaves Bangalore .
The instruments , observatory , and camp-equipage started from Bangalore on the 7th of July , and reached on the 7th of August-a creditable march of 390 miles in 31 days ( including halts ) in the height of the rainy season .
My subsequent experience of the state to which so-called " made " roads may be reduced , in these parts of India , by a few days ' rain , afforded grounds for self-congratulation that the journey was accomplished as quickly as it was .
I followed on the 1st of August , and reached Jamkandi on the morning of the 14th .
The journey was so exceedingly disagreeable a one that I shall say no more about it .
21 .
Arrival at Jamkandi .
By the evening of the 14th the observatory was put together and the telescope &amp;c. ready for adjustment .
22 .
Prospects .
I was surprised and considerably disappointed to learn that the weather had been for some days past as cloudy as I found it .
I had left heavy rain behind me at Belgaum , and found none at Jamkandi certainly ; but the sky was thick with passing cloud .
I was told that it was quite unusual , and that it could not last ; but by the morning of the 18th both Lieut. Campbell and myself had made up our minds not to be disappointed ( if we could help it ) , should we be denied more than a few glimpses .
23 .
Bad weather not unusual at this season .
I learned afterwards that at some time or other at that season a burst usually takes place on the Ghauts , causing a sudden and violent flood in all the rivers , and that the influence of this extends beyond their limits and occasions the fortnight of cloudy skies and scanty rainfall which such places as Jamkandi enjoy once a year .
This periodical flood had occurred between the time of our camp 's and our own arrival ; and we were now experiencing the cloudy season .
It was very unfortunate , but could hardly have been foreseen .
Not only our own party , but others in the neighbouring district of Bejapiur were unlucky .
Three days later the whole aspect of the country was changed .
The rivers subsided ; the heat which we had expected , but missed , began to make itself felt ; the villainous black soil hardened ; and the natives said confidently that their rainy season was past , and that the rivers would not rise again till next year .
24 .
Lieut. Campbell 's Station .
On the 17th Lieut. Campbell selected his position on a hill about a mile distant .
We had agreed that the character of the clouds was such that a greater separation was unnecessary , owing to their uniform distribution and regular current .
25 .
Final preparations .
I come at length to the more interesting part of my narrative .
The three days and nights which preceded the event were occupied in adjusting the polar axis , in examining every adjustment that could or could not require it , in exchanging the broad coarse pointer which I had used for night work for a stout but sharp needle , in going over and over again a mental review of the probable appearances and the possible contingencies which might arise .
The three months ' disuse , too , since I had to give up the nebulre , made fresh exercise necessary .
Among other things , I concluded not to alter the pendulum , long ago adjusted for sidereal time .
The difference of rate being only 1 in 365 for mean time ( and 1 in 388 for solar time at that date ) , the telescope would only gain on the sun by less than one second during the 5 ' minutes of totality ; so that even supposing I should wish to keep it directed on one and the same point the whole time , the practical effect would only be that that point would move along the slit by perhaps I5 part of its visible length ( estimating that length , or the width of the field , at 5 ' ) .
I mention this as the " Instructions " direct the adjustment to apparent solar time .
26 .
Disuse of the Barlow Lens accountedfor .
In one other respect , too , I must plead guilty to a departure from the letter of those instructions , which hardly perhaps needs justification ; I allude to the disuse of the Barlow lens .
My reason was principally this , that its insertion keeps the observer some 6 inches further from the body of the instrument , and , besides involving a complete disturbance of equilibrium , puts him out of reach of the declination screwresults which I could not but think had not been contemplated .
I should add that I was quite confident of the practicability of catching a prominence , without having its image doubled in size , though I was by no means so sure that I could spare any of the light , which would be reduced one-fourth .
27 .
Care in adjusting the Pointer during the approach of the Moon .
During the advance of the moon , and up to the last available moment , I paid particular attention to the collimation ( I use the word in its true sense of aim ) of the needle-point , being perhaps unnecessarily anxious to avoid my old difficulty of finding my object in the spectroscope .
The sharp cusps were well suited to this purpose , and the sun-spots were good tests .
I had been fortunate in getting the pointer very exact , and was therefore not troubled with any collimation-error to allow for .
28 .
Spectrum at the Moon 's centre .
While thus employed I had occasion to remark that at the centre of the moon , some nine or ten minutes before totality , the intensity of the solar spectrum was much about the same as that of the fuill moon .
29 .
Measurement of Solar Lines .
Intensity of Spectrum of Limb at D.-The principal solar lines were measured at intervals during the advancing eclipse .
A few minutes before totality , in going over these lines for the last time , the slit being as wide as was allowable for full sunlight , i. e. very narrow , I recorded an increasing brilliancy in the spectrum in the neighbourhood of D , so great in fact as to prevent any measurement of that line till an opportune cloud moderated the light .
I am not prepared to offer any explanation of this .
The clouds were arranged in two distinct strata , the lower one containing masses hurrying past with the monsoon-current at no great height , the upper consisting of light , thinly scattered cirri showing very little motion .
It is conceivable that the latter may have been obstinately interposed until the time when I remarked the recorded brilliancy ; but I cannot say that I should be satisfied with such an explanation .
Whiteness of the Crescent.-I also remarked that the whiteness of the crescent , as seen in the finder , was apparently intensified as it grew narrower .
Possibly this was the effect of contrast with the darkening background ; for at this time I began to be annoyed by the appearance of five or six phantom crescents , which seemed to be trying to rival the legitimate one .
I imagine I was indebted to the dark glass for these apparitions ; but whatever called them up , they most effectually confused the view of the closing scene ; whatever might otherwise have been seen at this stage was swamped in the confusion .
30 .
Restlessness during afpproach of shadow .
Up to within about ten minutes of totality I was every now and then outside watching progress through one or the other of two smaller telescopes of moderate power , one of which I had borrowed from the chief , who indulges a taste for the possession of English manufactures to an extraordinary degree .
I noticed no marked inequalities of surface in the advancing limb , nor any bluntness of the cusps ; but I must allow that I was not in a sufficiently composed state of mind to observe critically anything not bearing directly on the special problem before me .
I was impressed with a notion that everything must be subordinated , in my case , to the requisite freedom of attention when totality commenced , and was specially anxious to save my eyesight .
I studiously avoided looking at the sun except under cover of a cloud ; and though I had provided the telescopes with graduated smoked glasses , I was nervously afraid to look through them too long or too intently-all which can only be understood by referring to what has been said about the absence of any foreknowledge of the impending revelation .
My last view of external appearances showed nothing very striking-a few deeply neutral-tinted patches of sky in the zenith , and an increasing gloominess in all directions , being all the phenomena whose impression has outlived the excitement of the shortlived minutes which ensued .
I reentered the observatory , and retired behind my black curtain to watch the event .
31 .
Gentlemen , I have thus far endeavoured to lay before you , as far as possible , in an orderly manner , an outline of the preliminary arrangements for the employment of your Society 's instruments , and a sketch of my proceedings up to the hour of the eclipse .
If in so doing I have been unnecessarily tedious , I would ask you to remember that these few pages but faintly represent the months of anxious study and preparation which have passed since I accepted the responsibility involved in the charge of an ex pedition deputed by the illustrious body I have now the honour of addressing-a responsibility more engrossing , it may be , but not lessened , by the specific but novel character of the proposed object of the expedition .
I proceed now to describe how far that object has been attained ; and here I feel that I cannot well indulge in too great a minuteness of detail .
32 .
Relative positions of Pointer , Slit , and Sun 's Limb .
The spectroscope may be inserted , and employed with its slit in any direction perpendicular to the optical axis of the telescope .
It is therefore competent to the observer to place the slit perpendicular or tangential to the sun 's circumference at any point ; and there can be no doubt that , were the observations conducted at leisure , it would be desirable to examine the whole circumference in both positions ; but the operation of turning the spectroscope is not so very simple a one but that the advantages and disadvantages of any such proceeding require to be well considered where time is of the first importance .
I decided on employing the slit in one direction only , that which corresponded with the diurnal motion .
It so happened that this corresponded nearly with the direction of the relative motion of the sun and moon , so that the widest part of the crescent could be made to fall nearly perpendicularly across the slit .
The needle ( in the finder ) and its point accurately represented the direction and centre respectively of the slit ; therefore , when the needle-point touched the sun 's limb at the centre of the crescent , a solar spectrum of definite width appeared in the field , of which one edge ( the right-hand ) continued stationary , while the other ( the left ) advanced slowly but perceptibly towards it , the solar spectrum decreasing visibly in width .
33 .
Last view of Solar Spectrum .
About a minute 's breadth remained .
A few seconds more and it would vanish suddenly .
Whatever spectrum the corona could show must then be revealed , unless indeed a " prominence " or " sierra " should happen to be situated at that precisespot , in which case the double spectrum should be presented .
The nervous tension at the moment may be conceived : what would be seen ?
what call for action would be made ?
and for what action ?
or , if nothing were seen , what would have to be done ?
I cannot say that I was prepared , at that moment , either with these questions , or with ready answers to them ; but that was the sensation .
With regard to the last , I suppose I should have instinctively widened the slit ; and had that failed , should then have gone to the finder to look for a prominence .
As it was , the spectrum faded out as I looked , while it had still appreciable width , and I knew a cloud had intervened .
Totality commences unseen.-A few seconds more and the spectrum of diffuse light vanished also , and told me the eclipse was total , but behind a cloud .
34 .
On the watch for a glimpse .
I went to the finder , removed the dark glass , and waited ; how long , cannot say ; perhaps half a minute .
Soon the cloud hurried over ; following the moon 's direction , and therefore revealing first the upper limb , with its scintillating corona , and then the lower .
A prominence seen and aimed at.-Instantly I marked a prominence near the needle-point , an object so conspicuous that I felt there was no need to take any precautions to secure identification .
It was a long finger-like projection from the ( real ) lower left-hand portion of the circumference .
A rapid turn of the declination-screw covered it with the needlepoint , and in another instant I was at the spectroscope .
A single glance and the problem was solved .
Its Spectrum.-THREE VIVID LINES , RED , ORANGE , BLUE ; NO OTHERS , AND NO TRACE OF A CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM .
35 .
Measurement of lines undertaken , with partial success .
When I say the problem was solved , I am of course using language suited only to the excitement of the moment !
It was still very far from solved , and I lost no time in applying myself to measurement .
And here I hesitate ; for the measurement was not effected with anything like the ease and certainty which ought to have been exhibited .
Much may be attributed to haste and unsteadiness of hand , still more to the natural difficulty of measuring intermittent glimpses ; but I am bound to confess that these causes were supplemented by a failure less excusable .
I have no idea how those five minutes passed so quickly !
Clouds were evidently passing continually ; for the lines were only visible at intervals-not for onehalf the time , certainly-and not always bright ; but still I ought to have measured them all .
My failure was in insufficient illuminating power ; but why , I cannot tell .
I never experienced any difficulty of the kind with the nebulae , which required that I should flash in light suddenly over and over again .
I had found the hand-lamp the surest way ; but it failed me here in great measure .
The red line must have been less vivid than the orange ; for after a short attempt to measure it , I passed on to secure the latter .
Two lines measured .
In this I succeeded to my satisfaction , and accordingly tried for the blue line .
Here I was not so successful .
The glimpses of light were rarer and feebler , the line itself growing shorter and , what remained of it , further from the cross .
I did , however , place the cross wires in a position certainly very near the true one , and got a reading before the reillumination of the field told me that the sun had reappeared on the other limb .
These readings were called out , as those of the solar lines had been , to my recorder ; and it was only afterwards that I compared them .
I need not dwell on the feelings of distress and disappointment which I experienced on realizing the fact that the long-anticipated opportunity was gone , and , as it seemed to me then , wasted .
I seemed to have failed entirely .
Almost mechanically I directed the telescope to the bright limb , to verify the readings of the solar lines ; and in so doing my interest was again awakened by the near coincidence , as it seemed , of the line F with the position of the wires ; but a little reflection convinced me that the distance of the former was greater than the error which I might have made in intersecting the blue line .
Their readings and those of the solar lines.-I read F , and then D &amp; C. The following were my readings up and dowrn : C. D. b. F. ( 191 2'96 4-58 5-64 91 90 2-94 4-56 5 ' 61 Before .
193 2-98 4-60 5 ' 65 1-92 2-97 4-58 5-62 Bright lines ... [ 300 ] ... [ 5-56 ] After ... 1-93 3-00 ... 5-65 36 .
Identity of the Orange Line .
I consider that there can be no question that the ORANGE LINE was identical with D , so far as the capacity of the instrument to establish any such identity is concerned .
37 .
Of the Blue Line : doubtful .
I also consider that the identity of the BLUE line with F is not established ; on the contrary , I believe that the former is less refracted than F , but not much .
38 .
Of the Red Line : uncertain .
With regard to the RED line , I hesitate very much in assigning an approximate place : B and C represent the limits ; it might have been near C ; I doubt its being so far as B ; I am not prepared to hazard any more definite opinion about it .
Its colour was a bright red .
This estimate of its place is absolutely free from any reference to the origin of the lines C and F. 39 .
Subsequent mental aberration : not unusual .
It is a fact not unworthy of notice that in all the accounts of eclipses , written soon after the event , which I have read , the record hurries rapidly to a close after the sun has reappeared ; the reason , no doubt , is that a reaction takes place after the excitement of witnessing the actual eclipse , and phenomena which might be noticed after , quite as well as before , pass unregarded on that account .
For my part I was surprised to find how utterly indifferent I felt to the appearance of things when I came out of my observatory .
I am almost ashamed to confess that I went straight to my tent , and tried to write down what I had seen , instead of going to the telescope to watch for what still might be seen .
It never even occurred to me to remove the spectroscope and use the fine telescope I had at command .
40 .
Afterconsideration of the phenomena witnessed .
I have not quite exhausted the statement of my observations , though what I have still to state was rather the result of subsequent reflection than of actual cognisance at the time .
I said that the prominence was situated close to the needle-point .
I estimate its position as at the east point , a few degrees to the left of the lowest , of the sun 's limb .
Its form was that of a projecting finger slightly curved to the southward , and its height nearly 2 ' .
The slit was at right angles to the hour-circle , and therefore perpendicular to the sun 's limb at this point .
A vertical section ( so to speak ) of the prominence was therefore admitted through the slit .
It appears , then , that the length of the lines corresponded with the height of the prominence , being limited ( as in the case of the spectrum of the section of the crescent ) on the one hand ( the left ) by the advancing moon 's limb at the centre of the field , and on the other by the natural summit of the prominence , or flame , as we are now entitled to call it .
Spectrum of Corona not seen.-Beyond this summit the light of the corona was free to enter ; it was also free to enter with that of the flame ; but I saw the spectrum of the latter only .
I thence conclude that the spectrum of the corona was a faint solar one , --a conclusion quite in accordance with the other characteristics of this phenomenon , such as the radiated appearance and the evidence from polarity , indicating a central source of light .
With regard to the latter , it is clear that the light of the corona is polarized in planes passing through the sun 's centre ( as the gist of Lieut. Campbell 's Report ) , and therefore that the corona shines mainly by reflected light .
At the same time it is possible that the absence of a spectrum of the corona at this particular spot may have been accidental .
I have since heard that the corona was particularly feeble at this point .
I had no opportunity of studying the corona myself .
After first catching sight of the eclipse in the finder , I never left the spectroscope but once , when a long interval of cloudiness sent me to the finder to make sure .
I then caught a few seconds ' glimpse again , and remarked a red blot ( I recognized no shape ) of a prominence at about the north point , or rather to the west of it .
41 .
Remarks on the ease with which the lines might be measured , and suggestions for future observations .
I have now a few remarks to add which may be of use to future observers , if not of any present value .
It is difficult to say what might or might not have been done but for the clouds ; but I am pretty certain that ( even labouring , as I was , under the difficulty of bad illumination ) not only might all three lines have been satisfactorily measured , but time would have sufficed for further examination .
The course which that examination should take is a question which it is of the highest importance for an observer to decide on previously .
I believe I was right in using a narrow slit to begin with , not anticipating such a totally darkfield ; but I should not do so again ; or if I did , with the object of getting exact measures of the three principal lines , I should be prepared to widen the slit to look for faint ones , the positions of which I should estimate with reference to those three .
I should then direct the telescope at the brightest part of the corona , taking very good care to prefer a part free from any appearance of sierra , and if possible near the east or west points , so that the slit might admit a vertical section .
Assuming that the corona does not emit tosochromatic light -if I may be allowed to coin a word to indicate definite but unspecified colours , both in respect of number and tint ( or pitch)-of very distinct character , the spectrum of such a vertical slice might indicate by its varying width that the light was not uriformlly constituted .
Another point to be ascertained is whether all flarnes are constituted alike .
This would require a more or less rapid glance at the spectra of several .
I have spoken of " the three principal lines " because I saw no others .
I have , however , heard rumours of a greater number having been seen by other observers , whether of equal brilliancy or not I do not know ; but it inclines me to enforce the statement I have already made of " three vivid lines-no more , " as seen with a narrow slit .
I had no suspicion whatever of the presence of any but those three ; and as I first saw them they were as sharp and bright as one could well wish to see .
Whether the prominence which I looked at was the same as those in which more than three lines were seen I do not know .
42 .
Lieut. Campbell 's Observations satisfactory in their result .
The determination of the polarization-plane of the corona is as satisfactory as can be desired , and Lieut. Campbell 's account is so clear that I have little to say about it .
It is to be regretted that he did not see the effect of polarization all round at the same time , with a power low enough to include the whole of the phenomena ; but the view fortunately obtained with the higher power remedies this in great measure by showing what would have been seen at points 90 ?
distant from that which he describes .
43 .
Results with Hand Spectroscopes unknown .
With regard to the hand spectroscopes I have scarcely any report to make .
Lieut. Campbell had no opportunity .
Capt. Haig has sent no report .
Neither have I heard anything of one of the two sent to sea .
The only record I have received is that of Capt. Rennoldson , of the 'Rangoon , ' P. &amp; 0 .
Co. 's Steam Ship , which I enclose .
He mentions having seen with the spectroscope a prominence not seen by others with ( I presume ) ships ' glasses of greater power .
This is difficult to understand , except on the supposition that the light of the corona was weakened by dispersion , while that of the flame was not , or not in so great a degree .
Should it turn out that the prominence he describes was a reality , it is barely possible that the above explanation may be the true one ; in which case it suggests the possibility of seeing the proininences with a heavy battery of prisms when the sun is not eclipsed , especially if they are made of yellow glass ; nay , even of seeing them , without the help of dispersion , through a medium calculated to stop all light but that of the sodium flame .
Mr. Chambers prevented by Clouds from using two other Spectroscopes .
Two other hard spectroscopes in my possession were lent to Mr. Chambers , Government Astronomer at Bombay , who stationed himself not far from Begapur ; but I am sorry to say he was denied the opportunity of using them by the clouds .
Gentlemen , I beg to apologize for the length of my narrative , and to subscribe myself , with much respect , Your obedient Servant , J. HERSCInEL , Lieut. R.Eo Bangalore , Sept. 1868 .
LIEUT .
CAMPBELL'S REPORT .
" ' I was deputed to accompany Lieut. Herschel on his expedition to observe the phenomena of the total eclipse , and to use the instruments supplied by the Royal Society for the observation of polarized light in the corona and red flames .
" The instruments in question were as follows:--A telescope of 3-inch aperture , mounted on a rough double axis , admitting of motion in azimuth and altitude by hand only , unaided by any appliance for clamping and slow motion .
The telescope was provided with three eyepieces of magnifying-powers 27 , 41 , and 98 ; and with it were furnished two analyzers for polarized light , viz. a double-image prism and a ' Savart 's polariscope .
' " ; The first gives two images of the object viewed , which , when polarized light is present , become strongly coloured with complementary tints , by whose changes , according to the position in azimuth of the analyzer , the plane of polarization may be found .
" The second shows the presence of polarized light by the formation , across the image of the object viewed , of coloured bands , which alter in arrangement and intensity according to the position of the polariscope with reference to the plane of polarization , and hence afford a means of arriving at a knowledge of the latter .
" With the former , slight polarization would probably be more readily recognized at a glance ; while with the latter the plane of polarization could be more easily and accurately determined .
" To carry these arms I had a pair of jointed arms constructed , so attached by a collar and screw to the eye-tube of the telescope as to admit of the eyepiece being changed .
Each arm carried one of the analyzers in a cell , in which a rotatory motion could be given for analyzing purposes .
" Either analyzer could in this way be brought instantly into position before the eyepiece of the telescope , or both could be turned aside and the telescope used by itself at pleasure .
" Immediately behind the apparatus a circular piece of cardboard of about 12 inches diameter and neatly graduated was firmly attached to the eye-tube , and to each analyzer was affixed a long pointer by which its azimuth could be referred to the graduations on the card circle , should measures of position or change of azimuth appear desirable .
" I was also furnished with a hand spectroscope for direct vision .
" The point chosen for my station was on the northern slope of a low range of hills , about 1mile W. by S. of Jamkandi .
The flatness of the hills on top offered no point from which an uninterrupted view could be obtained in all directions ; and from my station [ I only had a view of the northern half of the distant horizon over the plains extending in that direction for many miles , above the level of which I was raised about 200 feet , " Early on the morning of the 18th I proceeded to the spot , having previously sent up the instruments and a tent for shelter in case of necessity .
" At sunrise the sky was beautifully clear , except in the northern horizon , where there were low clouds lying-over the river Kistna .
There was a gentle breeze from S.W. by W. A little later light flocculent clouds began to rise and form in an arch overhead from west to east , continuing to increase as the morning wore on ; then a light scud set in , and turned gradually into broken masses of thick dark clouds .
" Before the commencement of the eclipse I took observations for time with a small theodolite , from which I computed the error of my chronometer ( a mean time one by M'Cabe ) to be Ih 14m 55S'5 fast on local apparent time ; and by that quantity I have accordingly corrected all observed chronometer times in the statements of time which follow .
" I observed the first contact , which took place at 7 " 45m 13 ' ( local apparent time ) , about 150 from the vertex ; after which I watched the progress of the eclipse , and noted the times of occultation of three sunspots .
No. 1 was a large double ragged spot , No. 2a small well-defined one , No. 3 also double , but not so large or distinct as No. 1 .
After totality I saw a fourth spot very near the sun 's limb .
" During the progress of the eclipse I observed no unevenness in the moon 's limb , nor any want of sharpness in the cusps , using magnifyingpower 27 .
" The following notes were taken on the spot : At first contact .
Sun very slightly obscured by clouds .
At 8 " Om .
Clouds thick , and gathering from S.W. and W. Wind higher and gusty .
At 8h 10 ' .
Clouds overhead , increasing and thickening and rising steadily from west .
At 8 " 20'1 .
Sky nearly entirely overcast ; clouds thickest in neighbourhood of sun .
At 8h 25"L .
A clear break .
At 8h 30 " .
I thought I could discern very faintly the dark limb of the moon beyond that of the sun ; and at this time , making allowance for the general cloudiness , I did not perceive any decrease of light on the landscape .
At 8 " 40"1 .
But tenl minutes later the darkness was decided .
At 81 45^l .
Thick clouds well broken up , stil , gathered most closely in the region of the sun .
Light becoring lurid , and increase of darkness very apparent .
At 8h 521m .
Cusps perfect ( magnifying-power 27 ) .
" Closely before totality a bright line of light appeared to shoot out at a tangent to the mcon 's limb at its centre , as if running across the bright crescent of the sun ( though of course not visible against the superior light ) and extended beyond each cusp to a distance nearly , if not quite , 15 ' .
[ Note by Lieut. H. The sketch in the margin represents Lieut. Campbell 's meaning , as asceriained orally .
] The corona became visible immediately after , between the dark limb of the moon and the bright line .
The corona did not appear so briglit as the line , the brilliance and whiteness of the light of which was most striking .
This was seen through a highly smoked glass .
At this period , probably not more than 3 to:5 seconds before totality ensued , a thick cloud shut out everything , and the rest of the phenomenon was only seen fitfully through openings in the clouds , for an aggregate period which I estimate at somewhat less than half that of totality .
" This alternate appearance and disappearance troubled me greatly , and gave rise to nervousness and excitement ; for owing to the imperfect mounting of my telescope I was apt to lose myv place whenever the light was cut off by clouds , and to waste the precious moments of clearness in finding it again .
" On the first opportunity after the commencement of the eclipse I turned on the double-image prism with the eyepiece of 27 magnifying-power , as recommended in the Instructions , which gave a field of about 45 ' diamieter .
A most decided difference of colour was at once apparent between the two images of the corona ; but I could not make certain of any such difference in the case of a remarkable horn-like protuberance , of a brightred colour , situated about 210 degrees from the vertex , reckoned ( as I have done in all cases ) with reference to the actual , not the inverted image , and with direct motion .
I then removed the double-image prism and applied the Savart 's polariscope , which gave bands at right angles to a tangent to the limb , distinct but not bright , and with little , if any , appearance of colour .
On turning the polariscope in its cell the bands , instead of appearing to revolve on their own centre , passing through various phases of brightness , arrangement , &amp;c. , travelled bodily along the limb , always at right angles thereto , and without much change in intensity , or any at all in arrangement .
" The point at which they seemed strongest was about 1403 from the vertex , and I recorded them as black centred .
" Believing that with a higher power and a smaller field I should find it easier to fix my attention on one point of the corona and observe the phases of the bands at that point , I changed eyepieces applying that of 41 power .
With this eyepiece the first clear instant showed the bands much brighter than before , coloured , and as tangents to the lirmb at a point about 200 ?
from the vertex ; but before I could determrinle anything further a cloud shut out the view , and a few seconds later a sudden rush of light told that the totality was over , though it was difficult to believe that five minutes had flown by since its commencement .
" I experienced a strong feeling of disappointment and want of success ; the only points on which I can speak with any confidence being as follows:-(1 ) When using the double-image prism , the strong difference of colour of the two images of the corona , and the absence of such difference in the case of the most prominent red flame .
( 2 ) With the ' Savart 's polariscope ' the bands from the corona were decided ; with a low power they were wanting , in intensity and colour ; excepting alternate black and white , making it difficult to specify the nature of the centre ; and their position was at right angles to the limb , extending over about 30 ?
of the circumference .
When the polariscope was turined the bands travelled bodily round the limb without other change in position or arrangement , as if indeed they were revolving round the centre of the sun1 as an axis .
With a higher power , when a smaller portion of the coroiia was embraced , the bands were brighter , coloured , and seen in a different position , viz. tangents to the limb .
" The appearance observed with a low power seems exactly what might be expected , supposing the bands to be brightest at every point when at right angles to the limb , in which case the bands growing into brightness at each succeeding point of the limb would distract attention from those fading away at the points passed over as the analyzer revolved .
' After totality was over the clouds cleared away somewhat , and I watched the eclipse till its conclusion , noting the times of emersion of the spots and of last contact .
" A light shower fell at 9.30 .
" )During totality several stars and planets were seen by those who were with me ; and a fowl which I had placed near me , out of curiosity , was observed to compose itself to sleep .
It was at no time so dark as I had expected : after the total phase had commenced I read the chronometer and wrote notes in pencil without difficulty ; and the light of a bull's-eye lantern when thrown on my paper appeared somewhat dull .
( " The brilliance of the light of the corona when it burst out through the openings in the clouds astonished me .
Also the very gradual decrease of light before totality , and the wonderful flood of light which followed the instant of the sun 's reappearance ( though behind a cloud ) were very striking .
" I was too much occupied in watching the position of the sun , so as not to lose an instant of the precious intervals of clearness , to see much of the general effect .
I had no opportunity of using the hand spectroscope .

" Observations of the Total Solar Eclipse of August 18 , 1868 .
" By Captain CHARLES G. PERRINS , Communicated by Prof. STOKES .
Received October 30 , 1868 .
( Abstract .
) These observations are contained in a letter dated " S.S. ' Carnatic , ' Suez , 28th August , 1868 , " addressed to the Managaing Directors , Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company .
One of the hand spectroscopes sent out by the Royal Society had been entrusted to Captain Perrins ; but as his ship at the time of the eclipse was about 20 miles north of the track of the total phase , he had no opportunity of using it for the observations contemplated .
lie thus describes the appearance at the time of greatest obscuration:"That portion of the sun remaining uneclipsed consisted of a narrow streak ( in shape like a crescent ) of its upper left limb , in size about Tpart of its diameter .
The light emitted from this was of a very peculiar description and difficult to describe , being at the same time extremely brilliant and yet most remarkably pale .
The high sea running appeared like huge waves of liquid lead , and the ghastly paleness of the light thrown upon it and all around revealed a scene which , for its weird-like effect , it would be as impossible to depict as it is to describe .
" The slender crescent showed in the spectroscope several dark lines , as was to be expected .
