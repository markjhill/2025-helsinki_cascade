( Abstract .
) This paper contains the results of the investigation of the two prini cipal hydrocarbons produced by destructive distillation of caoutehouc and gutta percha .
Isoprene .
This substaice is any exceedingly volatile hydrocarbon , boiling betweeni 370 and 380 C. ; after repeated cohobations over soditum , it -was distilled and analvsed .

On distilling the ozonized liquid , a violent reaction takes place between the ozone and the hydrocarbon .

It is the same as between amylene and paramylene .
The author discusses the boiling-point of these bodies , and shows that they form most decided exceptions to Kopp 's empirical law .
Action of Bromine ot Caouttchine and its isomer Turpentine .
Caouitchine and turpentine act on bromine in precisely the same manner .
One equivalent of the hydrocarbon decolorizes four equivalents of bromine .
To determine this point quanititatively , eight experiments were made , four with turpentinie and four with caoutchine .

By the alternate action of bromine and sodiuim on caoutchine or turpentinie , two equivalents of hydrogen are remnoved , the final result being cymole , having exactly the odour hitherto considered characteristic of the hydrocarbon obtained from oil of cumin , and quite distinct from that of camphogenie .

At the same time that eymole is formed , there is a production of an oil having the same composition , but boiling about 300 ?
C. The author has provisionally named it paracymole .
Action of Sulphuric Aeid on Caoutchine .
Sulphuric acid acts on caoutchine , converting it almost entirely into a viscid fluid like heveene , at the same time a very small quantity of a conjuigate acid is formed , having the formula C20 i-16 S2 06 ; the composition was determined from that of the lime salt , which on ignition , &amp;c. , gave a quantity of sulphate of lime equal to 8-3 per cent. of calcium ; 020 flO Ca S2 O0 requires 8 5^ The author considers the action of heat on caoutchouc to be merely the disruiption of a polymeric body into substances having a simple relation to the parent hydrocarbon .
He deduces this view from the similarity in compositionl between pure caoutchoue , isoprene , and caoutchine .

) Both the cymole from tuirpentine and that from caoutchine were covnverted into insolinic acid by bichromate of potash and sulphnric acid .
The quantitative determinations made on the silher salt of the acid were alm , ost theoretically exact .
density determinations contained in this paper , and more especially in those " On some of the products of the Destructive Distillation of Boghead Coal , " the author has so repeatedly had to ascertain the value of the expression 1 that he was induced to calcuI + 000367 T ' late it once for all for each degree of the Centigrade thermometer from 1 ?
to 150 ? .
As it is always easy so to manipulate as to prevent the value of T falling betweena the whole numbers , the Table proved a most valuable means of saving time ; the author has therefore appended it to his paper in the hope of its proving equally useful to other working chemists .
