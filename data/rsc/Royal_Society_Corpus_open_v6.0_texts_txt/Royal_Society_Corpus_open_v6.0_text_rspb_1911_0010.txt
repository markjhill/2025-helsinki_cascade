) ( From the Bio-Chemical Laboratory , Lister Institute .
) A preliminary communication on some of this work has been published.* The present paper deals with the experimental part of the investigation in question , and some new results are recorded .
On examining the action of B. lactis aerogenes on glucose , it was found that the carbon content of the products isolated was not so great as that of the original glucose employed .
A further examination disclosed that a quantity of a neutral liquid was present containing the amount of carbon needed to explain this discrepancy .
As , in the preliminary communication , justification was shown for calling this liquid " crude butylene glycol , " the use of this convenient name will be continued here .
The object of this investigation was to determine as far as possible the nature of the constituents of this material , and the proportions in which they are found therein .
The Conditions of Cultivation of the Organism .
In all the earlier experiments the organism { B. lactis aerogenes ) was grown anaerobically in a medium containing 1 per cent , of Witte peptone , 2 per cent , of pure glucose , and an excess of chalk .
Later , other sugars were used , and sometimes , when using glucose , the percentage of sugar employed was raised to 5 , in order to obtain larger yields of one particular product per * Harden and Walpole , 'Boy .

litre of medium treated .
The flasks employed were of 1 litre capacity , and \#166 ; each was provided with a mercury trap which permitted the egress of the gases evolved .
The fermentation was carried on under strictly anaerobic \#166 ; conditions , and the method of preparing the flasks was that employed by Harden.* While in the incubator they were agitated from time to time to distribute the chalk throughout the medium .
The gas evolution was found to be vigorous during the first four days , but after two to four weeks ceased completely , and the quantity of unchanged sugar in the flask was very small indeed .
At first every flask removed was tested by plating on agar , but the practice was frequently omitted and , instead , a culture on sloped agar in a test-tube made and examined .
The quantities of the various substances found are stated in the previous paper .
In order to isolate the crude butylene glycol , the contents of the flask were first filtered from excess of chalk and then evaporated at 55 ' under diminished pressure to dryness , and the dry residue , consisting of calcium salts and peptone , extracted with alcohol .
The alcohol extracts yielded on fractionation a colourless liquid , boiling at 181 ' to 183 ' ( corr .
) at 760 mm. pressure .
The yield was very small , only amounting to about 1 gramme per litre of medium containing 20 grm. of glucose , but it was found possible to increase it by employing a medium containing 5 per cent , of glucose .
In this way 8 grm. of the new substance containing 52'8 per cent , of carbon were obtained per litre of medium containing 50 grm. of sugar .
This only accounts for about two-thirds of the missing carbon , and a rough estimate of the amount lost during the process of distillation and extraction was therefore made by dissolving 8 grm. of the material in 500 c.c. of a medium containing 5 grm. of Wit peptone , 6 grm. of calcium lactate , and 6'5 grm. of alcohol , and then extracting it in the manner described above .
Only 5*2 grm. were recovered , the loss per 500 c.c. being therefore about 2'8 grm. , and the loss per litre about 5'6 grm. This brings the total amount produced from 50 grm. of glucose to about 13'6 grm. , slightly in excess of that required .
In one case a yield of 10-75 grm. was obtained from 1 litre of medium \#166 ; containing 5 per cent , of glucose .
Generally , only 7 to 8 grm. of the " crude glycol " were obtained from each flask of 50 grm. of glucose , in spite of numerous attempts to improve the yield .
I. The Nature of the " Crude Glycol .
" This substance boils at 181 ' to 183 ' ( corr .
) at ordinary pressure , and at 12 mm. the boiling point is from 83 ' to 84'-5 C. ; it solidifies in the cold * ' Jenner Inst. Trans. , ' 1899 , vol. 2 , p. 126 .

to a transparent mass , which melts indefinitely at about 28 ' , and shows to a marked degree the phenomena of super-cooling .
It is slightly dextrorotatory , the value for [ a]D for different preparations varying from + +46 to +0-71 .
A sample of crude glycol gave the value +16 for [ a]D when .dissolved to the proportion 22 per cent , in a saturated aqueous solution of borax , while in aqueous solution it was +0 8 .
Dried over quicklime no-decomposition apparently takes place at once , though , after several months , discoloration , diminution of viscosity , and development of a peculiar smell occur .
Samples of the natural product gave the following figures on burning:\#151 ; c. H. I per cent. 52 *41 per cent. 10 -80 II 52 *68 10-92 Ill 52 -62 10 -92 IV 52 -71 10-93 The figures corresponding to the formula O4H10O2 are 53*33 for C and 1111 for H. It will be seen that the presence of a trace of moisture will account for this discrepancy , which will be referred to later .
Desiccation of the " Crude Glycol .
" In order to determine the percentage composition of the desiccated natural " glycol " a sample several times redistilled in vacuo was distilled on to quicklime , sealed up for several weeks , and then distilled off again at 12 mm. pressure .
No difference in boiling point was observed between the four consecutive fractions of several cubic centimetres , each of which was collected and at once hermetically sealed .
Melting-point.\#151 ; These were now all frozen and very slowly warmed in a large bath from 5 ' to 30 ' , the operation taking two hours and the bath being vigorously stirred the while .
Sample I.\#151 ; At 21 ' it became pasty and began to liquefy and did so more rapidly than IY .
Sample II was not further examined .
Sample III remained solid above 28'*5 .
Sample IY became pasty and began to liquefy at 21 ' , and completely liquefied at 28 ' .
It will be seen that the figures of Sample III , which had the highest melting point , correspond accurately to the formula C4Hi002 , but are considerably different from those of Nos. I and IV .

Oxidation of the " Crude .
" ( 1 ) Oxidation in Aqueous Solution by Bromine in the Presence of Light .
Formation of Diacetyl.\#151 ; To 0"9 grm. of crude glycol dissolved in 50 c.c. of water 3*25 grm. of bromine was added .
The whole was well shaken from time to time and exposed to the light from an arc-lamp , care being taken not to allow the temperature of the mixture to rise to any considerable extent .
After six hours a dilute aqueous solution of sulphur dioxide was added until the smell of bromine disappeared , and the mixture was saturated with sodium chloride .
Distillation under a Young 's still-head of 15 discs yielded some drops of a yellow liquid which possessed the characteristic smell of diacetyl and dissolved in excess of water .
Phenylosazone of Diacetyl.\#151 ; This was prepared in order to confirm the identification of this product of the oxidation of " crude glycol .
" The solution of diacetyl obtained above was made up to 10 c.c. with water , 3 grm. of phenylhydrazine and 3 c.c. of 50 per cent , acetic acid added , and the whole kept at 100 ' for one hour .
The phenylosazone deposited was recrystallised from alcohol and then melted at 241'-5 to 243 ' .
0T147 grm. gave 20-6 c.c. N ( moist ) at 18''5 and 765 mm. Found N = 20-8 per cent. Calculated for Ci6Hi8N4 , N = 21 05 per cent. The osotetrazone prepared from this by oxidation with potassium bichromate and acetic acid melted at 153 ' .

All these reactions were also obtained with a few grammes of diacetyl prepared from methylacetoacetic ester .
Dioxime from Diacetyl.\#151 ; Two grammes of crude glycol were converted into diacetyl by the method described and after reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride , 30 per cent , of the amount of oxime theoretically obtainable was isolated in the pure condition .
This melted at 135'*5 to 136'*5 , thus agreeing with the dioxime prepared from diacetyl obtained from methylacetoacetic ester .
It gave the well-known dimethylglyoxime reaction with small quantities of nickel.f The yield of diacetyl by oxidation of the crude glycol , taken in conjunction with the constancy of boiling point , percentage composition , and molecular weight determination , are conclusive evidence that the substance is nearly pure 2:3-butanediol .
The further confirmation of this by actually separating the purified diol from .its diphenylurethane is described later ( p. 281 ) .
( 2 ) Oxidation with Semi-normal and Normal Nitric Acid at 100'.\#151 ; Among the products of oxidation were found carbon dioxide , acetaldehyde , small quantities of acetylmethylcarbinol and diacetyl , acetic acid , and inactive lactic acid .
The last two substances were identified by the composition of their barium and zinc salts respectively:\#151 ; Acetic Acid.\#151 ; 3*535 grm. of barium salt gave 3*1479 grm. of BaS04 .

( 3 ) The crude glycol does not reduce Fehling 's solution either in the cold or on heating , though it contains a constituent which reduces ammoniacal silver nitrate* in the cold .
This may be removed without any apparent accompanying change to the " crude glycol " by boiling for eight hours with 30-per-cent , caustic soda solution .
When the " crude glycol " was boiled at atmospheric pressure for seven hours in contact with air the liquid assumed a brownish tint , which did not increase with time , and [ \#171 ; ]D fell from + 0-723 to + 0-590 .
On boiling with animal charcoal in aqueous solution and recovering the glycol , the [ \#171 ; ]d was found to be 0'749 .
No reaction product could be obtained by heating an aqueous solution of " crude glycol " and phenylhydrazine acetate to 100 ' for one hour .
A mixture of 10 grm. glycol , 32 grm. water , and 8 grm. concentrated sulphuric acid boiled up for 10 hours apparently underwent no change , the material being recovered unaltered .
The above experiments , beyond showing the general chemical stability of the constituents of the " crude glycol , " indicated that it was not a pure chemical substance , but did not provide any information as to the other substances accompanying the 2 : 3-butanediol therein .
Treatment of " Crude Glycol " with Pheny and Fractionation of the ResultingPlienylur ethanes .
20'4 grm. of " crude glycol , " 64 c.c. phenylisocyanate , 250 c.c. of pure dry ether were boiled on a water-bath for 12 hours till " bumping , " due to deposition of crystals commenced .
The mixture was then allowed to cool .
The supernatant fluid was poured off , and , together with the dry ethereal washings of the crystals , boiled up again for an additional seven hours .
This liquid was concentrated , and , on cooling , the mother liquors containing the .excess of phenylisocyanate were removed , and the isocyanate decomposed by alcohol .
In some later preparations the excess of phenylisocyanate , together with the most soluble phenylurethanes , was carried on to the next batch .
Precautions were taken to prevent access of water during the performance of the above operations .
The fractionation of the reaction-products was commenced by recrystallisation from alcohol .
Four substances were obtained pure in this way .
The mother liquors containing substances more soluble in alcohol were dissolved in benzene , and precipitated fractionally by adding light petroleum .
Altogether , about 105 grm. of " crude glycol " were treated with phenylisocyanate , corresponding to about 383 grm. of mixed phenylurethanes .

Repeated recrystallisation from alcohol did not alter this melting-point .
By the use of benzene as a solvent , however , careful fractionation of this material yielded crops melting at 235 ' ( diphenylurea ) and 196 ' ( diphenylurethane of 2 : 3-butyleneglycol ) respectively .

The melting point of the pure substance recrystallised from alcohol was found to be 100 ' C. , and a sample of the material treated with phenylisocyanate in benzene solution at its boiling point for eight hours gave an almost theoretical yield of the diphenylurethane ( melting point , 199c ) .

A collection of a quantity of this material was made , and then fractionation effected by precipitation with low boiling-point petroleum ether .
After a while the mother liquors became thick , and then the phenylurethane formed by the reaction of phenylisocyanate and the alcohol added was removed by distillation in vacuo .
The distillate , boiling at about 120 ' under reduced pressure , consisted of nearly pure phenylurethane , melting after recrystallisation at 490,5 .

Action of [ Oct. 22 , The residue from the distillation was dissolved in benzene , and fractionation by petroleum ether was continued .
It became necessary at this stage to take the [ a]D , as well as the melting point and weight of each crop , and these crops were then sorted out with respect to their optical activities .
It frequently happened that when material that was considered inactive was further fractionated it yielded strongly dextro- and strongly hevo-rotatory substances .
The separation at each step was very slight , and a very large number of precipitations was required before any fractions which could be regarded as pure substances were obtained .
The final products of this fractionation of the substances contained in the alcoholic mother liquors mentioned above were :\#151 ; ( 1 ) A substance of [ a]\#169 ; about \#151 ; 50 in alcoholic solution , melting at 145 ' C. The glycol obtained by hydrolysis was strongly dextro-rotatory .
( 2 ) A substance of [ a]D greater than +34 and melting higher than 200 ' C. These substances were not further examined , owing to the small amount obtainable in the pure condition , as judged by the definiteness of the melting point .
One of them is possibly the diphenylurethane of an active 2 : 3-butanediol .

On distillation under a long column the characteristic yellowish-green ring of diacetyl was seen to come over and the material was found to possess the peculiar smell of diacetyl .
The distillate reduced Fell ling 's solution at once in the cold and yielded a crystalline osazone .
The quantity was so minute that a melting-point determination could not be performed satisfactorily .
The evidence obtained , however , was considered to prove that the inactive diphenylurethane melting at 157 ' gave on hydrolysis a butanediol which 1910 .

Carbon dioxide was then passed in to saturation , the solution evaporated to dryness in vacuo , and the glycol dissolved out in alcohol .
The alcoholic solution on distillation gave a yellow oily liquid .
This remained yellow on redistilling several times , ultimately , however , by repeated boiling with animal charcoal it was obtained colourless .

c 52 -6 11 -07 53 -33 11 -11 H It will be seen that the combustions of the " glycol " prepared from the diphenylurethane consistently give figures for the carbon content which are less than the theoretical .
This cannot be put down to errors in the combustion process .
It is suggested that a small percentage ( about 1 per cent. ) of water persistently accompanies the glycol even in its distillation .
A sample treated in aqueous solution with bromine in the light gave diacetyl from which the osazone of melting point 241 ' to 243 ' was prepared .
The identity of this osazone with the corresponding one from the " crude glycol " was established .
With iodine and potash an aqueous solution of the glycol gives an immediate precipitate of iodoform .
It is seen that the " crude glycol " has given large quantities of a pure diphenylurethane from which a pure butanediol has been prepared by alkaline hydrolysis .
This recovered diol yields diacetyl on oxidation , and this shows conclusively that the butanediol has a straight chain with the two hydroxyl groups in the 2 : 3-position .
On this , and the fact of the large yield of diphenylurethane melting at 199''5 when phenylisocyanate acts on the " crude glycol " is based the conclusion that well over 90 per cent , of the " crude glycol " consists of an inactive 2 :3-butanediol .
From the remaining 10 per cent , only one substance has been definitely isolated and this appears also to be an inactive 2 :3-butanediol , but yields a pheny lure thane melting at 157 ' .
It is probable that one of these inactive diols is the r. or d.l. isomer and the other the internally compensated isomer , but no attempt has been made to decide this question .

The Effect of Free Oxygen on the Action of B. on Glucose and on 2 : 3\#151 ; Butanediol .
In the experiments described the amount of acetylmethylcarbinol obtained from 50 grm. of glucose was very small and it was desired to increase the yield of this substance .
An endeavour to do this by passing oxygen into the inoculated flask during incubation proved successful .
It was also found that acetylmethylcarbinol is abundantly formed when the bacillus is cultivated in a solution of the butanediol in 1 per cent , peptone water in a current of oxygen .

The volume of the contents of the flask scarcely changed during the passage of the gas .
The oxygen after leaving the flask passed again through wash bottles kept cold by circulation of the main supply ( 12 ' C. ) and up an inverted condenser .
Any acetylmethylcarbinol carried over by the oxygen was thus trapped .
In Experiment I the proportion of carbon dioxide in the gas leaving the apparatus never exceeded 2 per cent. The Examination of the Media after Fermentation .

The residual sugar in the anaerobic culture was less than 3 grm. ; that in the aerobic culture was less than 0-6 grm. The comparison of the amounts of acetylmethylcarbinol produced in the two cases was conducted as follows .
The contents of the two flasks were filtered from unattacked CaC03 and insoluble calcium salts and the filtrates distilled until in each case 800 c.c. of distillate were collected .
Very small traces of acetylmethylcarbinol can be detected by Fehling 's solution , and previous experience with this substance demonstrated that such a distillate * 'Compt .

The Action of [ Oct. 22 , would contain nearly all the acetylmethylcarbinol of the medium .
A number of experiments were then made to determine the volume of distillate in each case which , when made up to 10 c.c. with distilled water and 1 c.c. Eehling 's solution , just brought about complete reduction in 10 minutes .

The amount of acetylmethylcarbinol produced in the aerobic fermentation was 3.9 therefore \#151 ; = 5-6 times that produced in the similar fermentation under anaerobic conditions .
The acetylmethylcarbinol was found to be laevo-rotatory , but was not obtained pure enough for a determination of the [ a]D .
Experiments with synthetic acetylmethylcarbinol ( kindly made by Mrs. D. Norris ) show that under the above conditions 1 c.c. of Fehling 's solution is reduced by 248 mgrm .

In the anaerobic experiment 7'9 grm. , and in the aerobic experiment 6'85 grm. were obtained .
The values of [ a]d in 10-per-cent , solution in dry ether for these two samples were found to be + 1*71 and 4-1*52 respectively .

The stopper was therefore removed , the flask reinoculated and the stopper replaced , and the flask was then incubated .
Growth then took place .
After the expiration of three weeks both flasks were found to contain pure cultures of B. lactis aerogenes .
The liquids were distilled exactly as described for Experiment I , and the reducing power to Eehling estimated .

One litre of medium was made up to contain 1 per cent , of peptone , 1*5 per cent , calcium carbonate , and 5*0 per cent , of fructose .
The period of incubation at 37 ' was 37 days .
After filtration the volume was 963 c.c. , and from this 750 c.c. were distilled .
The distillates readily reduced Fehling 's solution in the cold , and when extracted with ether after saturation with potassium carbonate a liquid was obtained which gave with phenyl-hydrazine acetate an osazone melting at 240 ' C. It was therefore concluded that acetylmethylcarbinol was present .
The residue was treated in the manner described for glucose , and the weight of crude glycol obtained was 3*2 grms. The value of [ a]o was 1*32 in 10-per-cent , solution in dry ether .

Summary .
1 .
The " crude glycol " obtained by the action of B. lactis aerogenes on glucose contains two optically inactive 2:3-butanediols , whose diphenyl-urethanes melt at 199''5 and 157 ' respectively .
The former constitutes well over 90 per cent , of the material .
As no attempt was made to resolve either , it is impossible to say which is the racemic and which the meso- form .
2 .
Small quantities of the phenylurethanes of other glycols of unknown constitution were obtained from the crude glycol .
3 .
Acetylmethylcarbinol is formed from 2:3 butanediol by B. lactis aerogenes in presence of oxygen , and the yield from glucose is increased by the presence of oxygen .
4 .
Fructose is decomposed by the bacillus in a similar manner to glucose .
