Some Observations on the Formation of Mists in particular Situations .
By Sir H. Davy , Bart. F.R.S. V.P.R.I. Read February 25 , 1819 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1819 , p. 123 .
] The author shows , in this paper , that after sunset the fall of temperature that ensues upon the earth 's surface is considerably greater on land than in water , and refers to the well-known peculiarity in the expansibility of water , at temperatures below 40 ?
, for the cause of its superior temperature and that of the air above it .
When , therefore , the cold and comparatively dry air of the land mixes with the warmer and damper air that rests upon the water , the diminution of the temperature of the latter , occasioned by this mixture , tends to separate a portion of its moisture , and consequently to produce mist .
