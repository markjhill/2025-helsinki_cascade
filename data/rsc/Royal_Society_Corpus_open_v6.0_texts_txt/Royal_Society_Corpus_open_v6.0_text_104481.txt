V. Extract of a Letter from Mr. B-B---r , containing an Account , in Pounds and Ounces , of the surprising Quantities of Food devoured by a Boy , 12 Years old , in 6 successive Days , who laboured under a Canine Appetite , at Black Barnsley in Yorkshire .
Communicated by Dr. Mortimer , Secret .
R. S. April 15 .
1745 .
THE Boy was regular as other Children , till about a Year ago , when this extraordinary Craving of Appetite first began ; which afflicts him to such a Degree , that ( they tell us ) if he was not fed as he called out for it , he would gnaw the very Flesh off his own Bones ; so that , when awake , he is constantly devouring ; it can hardly be said eating , because nothing passes his Stomach , all is thrown up again .
