] By exposing the solid hydrate of chlorine , hermetically sealed up in a glass tube , to a temperature of about 100 , the chlorine is evolved from it under such pressure that it assumes the liquid form , appearing of a bright yellow colour , and sinking in the warm water without showing any tendency to mix with it till the temperature fell to about 700 , when the whole re-assumed the appearance of solid hydrate .
The liquid chlorine , in its pure form , did not congeal at 0 ?
, and it instantly assumed its usual elastic form upon removing the pressure to which it was subjected .
By condensing dry chlorine by means of a syringe into a glass tube , Mr. Faraday succeeded in converting a portion of it into a liquid , under a pressure of about four atmospheres .
The specific gravity of liquid chlorine he considers to be about 1-33 .
In a note attached to this paper Sir Humphry Davy announces his having succeeded in obtaining muriatic acid in a liquid form , by causing sulphuric acid and muriate of ammonia to act upon each other in a strong sealed tube .
The gas thus gradually liberated under pressure , condensed into an orange-coloured liquid , lighter than sulphuric acid , and instantly assuming the elastic state when the tube is broken .
Sir Humphry suggests the probability of other gases being condensed into the liquid form by a similar method of condensation under pressure ; and points out the advantages which this mode possesses over a sudden mechanical pressure , and condensation by exposure to cold .
