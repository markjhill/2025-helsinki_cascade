Communicated by A. CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received June 13 , 1855 .
The object of the paper is to enumerate the x-edra which have an ( x-l)-gonal face , and all their summits triedral ; or , what is the same thing , to find the number of the x-acra which have an ( x1)edral summit , and all their faces triangular .
Every x-edron having an ( x-l)-gonal face has at least two triangular faces .
Let A be an x-edron having all its summits triedral , and having about its ( x--l)-gonal face k triangular faces .
Suppose all these triangles to become infinitely small ; there arises an ( x-k)edron B , having an ( x-k-l)-gonal face , and all its summits triedral .
B will have k ' triangular faces , k ' being not less than two , nor greater than k. And there is no other ( x-k)-edron but B , which can arise from the vanishing of all the k triangles of A ; i. e. there is no ( x-k)-edron but B , from which A can be cut by removing k of the summits of B in such a way as to leave none of its k ' triangles untouched .
If we next suppose the kt triangles of B to vanish , there will arise an ( x-k-kt)-edron C , having an ( x-k-k'-1)-gonal face , all its summits triedral , and k " triangular faces , klf not &lt; 2 , nor &gt; kt .
And thus we shall at last reduce our x-edron , either to a tetraedron , or to a pentaedron having triedral summits .
All x-edra here considered fall into six varieties , differing in the sequence of the x-1 faces that are collateral with the ( x1)-gonal lase .
They are either irreversible , as the octaedron 6435443 , the seven faces about the base reading differently both backwards and forwards from every face ; or doubly irreversible , as the heptaedron 543543 , whose six faces about the base are a repetition of an irreversible period of three ; or triply irreversible , as the decaedron 643643643 , whose faces exhibit a thrice-repeated irreversible period ; or they are reversible , doubly reversible , or triply reversible , as the hexaedron 53443 , the enneaedron 63536353 , or the heptaedron 535353 , exhibiting a1 single , double , or triple period , all reading backwards and forwards the same .
If P , be the number of x-edra having an ( --l)-gonal base , and all their summits triedral , P =I , , + I+ I } 3+ R-+ R2I+ R3 , the symbols on the right denoting the numbers of x-edra of the six varieties that make up P_ .
Each variety is again subdivided according to the number of triangular faces .
Thus , if P(x , k ) denote the number of '-edra on an ( x-l)-gonal base , having k triangular faces , and all their summits triedral , PI(x , k)=I( , k ) + I(x , k ) + 13(x , k)+ R(x , k)+ R2(x , k ) + R3(x( , k ) .
^_ I T'he number k is not &lt; 2 , nor &gt; - , and P , = ZP(x , k ) , for all values of k. It is necessary to solve the following Problem.--To determine the number of ( ex+ k+l)-edra , none of which shall be the reflected image of another , that can be made from any , x-edron having k triangular faces , by removing k+1 of its base-summits , thus adding k+l triangular faces , so that none of its k triangular faces shall remain uncut .
The x-edron is supposed to have an ( x-1l)-gonal face , and all its summits triedral ; no edge is to be removed , and k +l not &gt; x-l1 .
When the x-edron , the subject of operation , is irreversible , all the resulting ( x+k+l)-edra will be irreversible .
If it is reversible , some of them will be reversible and others irreversible ; if it is multiple , some of them will be , and others will not be , multiple .
If the subject of operation is irreversible , the number required by the problem is take , e f , k ~ale ofanot g t-r tn the l of k and 1 ; i'e li( are , l)-^ a2-(-1 1 ) .

The complete answer to the problem is expressed by the following equations , in which , of the capitals on the left , the first expresses the result , and the second the subject of operation .
That is , IR2'( : , k , 1 ) denotes the number of irreversible ( x +k I)-edra having k-+ 1 triangular faces about the ( x.+ k-1l)-gonal base , that can be cut from any doubly reversible x-edron having k triangles about its ( xz-l)-gonal base .
Whenever k or I in the function ii(x , k , 1 ) is not integer , the function , by a geometrical necessity , is to be considered =0 .

By the aid of the above , together with the following , equations , the ( x +k+l)-edra having k+ triangular faces , an ( xk +k-1 ) gonal base and triedral summits , are successively found .

Similar equations are to be formed for the remaining five subdivisions of P(x +k+ l , k+ 1 ) .
Of the products under ; , the first factors are found by the preceding part of the process , and the second are given by the equations above written as solutions of the problem .
The factors will of course frequently be zeros .
Finally , if x =cx k+ 1 , P k+-= P=P( ' , 2 ) + P(x ' , 3 ) + ... .+ P(x ' , I(x ' ) ) .
Thus , to give an example , P , =P(11 , 2)+P(11 , 3 ) + P(11 , 4 ) + P(11 , 5 ) I=(11 , 2)+ 1(11 , 3 ) +1(11,4)+(1(11 , 5)=0 ) + 2(11 , 2)+ 2( 11 , 4 ) +R(l1 , 2)+ R(1 , 3)+R(11 , 4 ) +R(11 , 5 ) .

The result is P , =I11u+I1 +R11=61 +7 + 12=80 .
