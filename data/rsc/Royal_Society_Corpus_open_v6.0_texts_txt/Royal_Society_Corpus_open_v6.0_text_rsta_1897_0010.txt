[ Plate 9 .
] I state in another communication the arrangements made for obtaining results with prismatic cameras in Lapland , and how the attempts failed through bad weather .
After the instruments had been dispatched to Lapland in H.M.S. " Volage , " Sir George Baden-Powell , K.C.M.G. , M.P. , generously , and with admirable public spirit , offered to take an expedition to Novaya Zemlya in his yacht " Otaria , " if observers and instruments were forthcoming .
Sir George Baden-Powell consulted me on the subject , and ultimately , with the authority of the Vice-President of the Council , Mr. Shackleton , one of the computers employed by the Solar Physics Committee , was detailed to form part of the expedition .
The prismatic camera available was that which had been used in Brazil during the solar eclipse of 1893 .
The object glass is a Dallmeyer doublet of 19 inches equivalent focal length , with an aperture of 3*25 inches ; the image of the inner corona , therefore , is a ring of 0*2 inch diameter .
Two prisms of 3 inches clear aperture were used , with their refracting edges perpendicular to the horizontal , each having a refractive angle of 60 ' , the light being reflected into the apparatus by a siderostat .
The length of the spectrum given by this combination was 1*5 inches , from F to K , or 2*3 inches , from I)3 to K. In 1893 , the photographs obtained by this instrument in Brazil were not in focus in the ultra-violet , in consequence of the difficulties of adjustment under eclipse conditions .
The precaution was taken , therefore , of making all the necessary adjustments by obtaining some stellar photographs with the instrument before it left England .
Ultimatel}7 , a photograph of a Lyrse left nothing to be desired , and the then positions of all the parts were carefully marked .
Three specially-constructed dark slides , carrying eight plates each ( 4|- X If inches ) , were employed , the change from plate to plate being effected by means of a rack and pinion attached to the dark slides .
The plates used were Edwards ' isochromatic .
The following table , based on data furnished by the results of the 1893 eclipse , 2 L 2 2G.7.97 2G0 MR. J.

Mr. Shackleton , therefore , made the necessary alterations in the exposures , and the following revised table was determined upon .
Column 1 contains the numbers of the photographic plates , which will be quoted in subsequent references ; Column 2 gives the exposures ; Column 3 gives the times of exposing the plates in totality .
The exposures were made by means of a card moved by hand in front of the prisms , and when this was done as quickly as possible the exposures are tabulated as " instantaneous .

These are reproduced in Plate 9 .
No. 4 is given in two sections , on a scale of 3'4 times that of the original negative .
It was taken instantaneously at the exact beginning of totality .
The principal arcs are those of hydrogen and the II and K lines seen in the spectrum of calcium ; these long arcs , together with the numerous short ones , represent the spectrum of the sun 's limb at the moment of totality , Mr. Siiackleton determining the exact instant by watching the disappearance of the bright continuous spectrum with the aid of a small direct-vision slitless spectroscope .
This plate may undoubtedly be said to have been exposed within O'o second after the commencement of totality ; it had .
an instantaneous exposure , and this was sufficient to give a record of the spectrum from L\gt ; 3 to in the ultra-violet .
No. 11 is on a scale of 2*1 times that of the original negative , being exposed for a period of 40 seconds , beginning at 39 seconds from the commencement of totality , so that it records the spectrum near mid-totality .
The two overlapping disconnected rings to the left are the images of the prominences round the sun 's limb represented in the H and K light , the other discontinuous rings to the right are the images in II5 , Hy , and radiations respectively , the ring further to the right , which is of more continuous structure than the others is the 1474 K ring of the corona spectrum .
There are other fainter rings , both of the prominences and the corona , which are well seen on the original negative , but it is too much to hope that these will be seen in the Plate , being lost in the process of reproduction .

Corona .
Fig. 1 shows an enlargement of the 1474 K ring compared with an oriented photograph of the lower corona .
It will be seen that the prismatic camera has picked out the brightest parts of the corona , and where it is strongest the spectrum ring and the continuous spectrum at those points are most intense , whilst a prominence occurring at any point of the sun 's limb does not alter the intensity of the ring at the corresponding part .
The wave-lengths of the lines in Photo No. 11 have been measured by Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer , and a preliminary comparison of the results obtained in 1893 and 1896 has shown many points of difference ; it also indicates that the photograph of the flash so happily caught by Mr. Shackleton , and the cusp photograph secured by Mr. Fowler , in 1893 , both represent the spectrum of the chromosphere .
Except in the case of the lines visible in the spectrum of hydrogen , and the cleveite gases and the longest lines in the spectra of some of the metallic elements , notably calcium and strontium , there is little or no relation between the intensities of the lines visible in the chromosphere and Fraunhofer spectrum .
There is already evidence that the photographs which we owe to the public spirit of Sir George Baden-Povvell and the energy and skill displayed by Mr. Siiackle-ton will considerably widen our knowledge of solar physics and chemistry .

2G3 Mr. Shackleton 's report on the local arrangements , and the complete discussion of the results of the observations in their relation to solar physics will form the subject of a subsequent communication .
The investigation of the chemical origins of the various lines will occupy some time , and it seems desirable that the results of 1893 and 1896 should be studied together .
These will also be communicated at some future date .
