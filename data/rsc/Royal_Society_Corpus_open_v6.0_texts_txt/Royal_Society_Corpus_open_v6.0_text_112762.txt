In the second part of " c Researches on Vanadium , " it was stated that the metal absorbs hydrogeni .
This conclusion has been fully borne out by subsequent experiment ; and it appears that the amount of absorbed or combined hydrogen taken up by the metal varies according to the state of division , first , of the chloride ( VC12 ) from which the metal is prepared , and secondly , and especially , of the metal itself .
The metal containing absorbed hydrogen slowly takes up oxygen on exposure to dry air , water being formed and the metal undergoing oxidation to the lowest oxide , V , 0 .
At this point the oxidation stops , but in moist air it proceeds still further .
The difficulty of obtaining metallic vanadium free from admixture of oxide has been again rendered evident .
Perfectly pure tetrachloride was prepared in quantity , and from this pure dichloride was made .
On heating this to whiteness in dry hydrogen for 48 hours a substance was obtained which gained on oxidation 70 7 per cent. ( vanadium requiring 77i79 percentage increase ) , and therefore still contained a slight admixture of oxide .
The reducing action of sodium on the solid chlorides was next examined ; , in this case the reduction takes place quietly in an atmosphere of hydrogen at a red heat , and is best conducted in strong iron tubes .
Explosions occur when sodium acts on the liquid tetrachloride .
The substance thus obtained was found , after lixiviation , to be free from chlorine , and on washing it separated into two portions-(1 ) a light and finely divided black powder ( trioxide ) , which remiains in suspension , and is soluble in hydrochloric acid , and ( 2 ) a heavier grey powder , insoluble in hydrochloric acid , which soon deposits , and can , by repeated washing , be completely freed from the lighter trioxide .
This bright grey powder consists of metallic vanadium , mixed with more or less oxide .
If this metallic powder , after drying in vacuo , be reduced at a low red heat in a current of pure hydrogen , it takes fire spontaneously , even when cold , on exposure to air or oxygen , water being formred , whilst the vanadium undergoes oxidation , forming the blue oxide , V2 04 .
A portion of metal exposed for some weeks to the air also slowly absorbed oxygen , passing into the oxide , V 0 .

VANA DIU AND BROMINE .

wt.= 291 3.-When excess of bromine is passed over vanadium mononitride heated to redness , a vivid action occurs , and dense dark-brown vapours are formed , condensing in the cooler portions of the tube to a greyish-black , opaque , amorphous mass of the tribromide .
The tribromide is a very unstalle compound , losing bro* Phil. Trans. 1869 , p. 679 .
mine even when kept sealed up in glass tubes ; it is very deliquescent , and on heating in the air rapidly loses all its bromine and takes up oxygen , with formation of vanadic acid .
On being thrown into water , the tribromide readily dissolves , forming a brown liquid ( in this respect resembling the trichloride ) , which , on addition of a few drops of hydroehloric acid , turns of a bright green colour , showing the presence of a solution of an hypovanadic salt .
No free bromine or hydrobromic acid is given off on dissolving the tribromide in water .
That a more 'volatile higher bromide was not formed in this reaction was shown , inasnmuch as , on distilling the excess of liquid which had collected in the receiver , it was found to consist of free bromine , containing mere traces of the tribromide mechanically carried over .
The tribromide is likewise formed when bromine is passed over a red-hot mixture of vanadium trioxide and pure charcoal , as in the preparation of the tetrachloride ; but this method is not one to be recommended , as the tube becomes constantly stopped up by the formation of the solid tribromide .
The analysis of the tribromide was made by dissolving the dompound in water , and precipitating the bromine with excess of nitrate of silver , the vanadium being estimated as V2 0 , either in the filtrate from the bromide of silver or in a separate portion .
T'he bromine in the above determinations , obtained by precipitation as silver-salt , was invariably found to be too high , whilst the vanadium1 nearly agreed with the theoretical percentage , This is due to the fact pointed out by Stas , in his ' Recherches , ' p. 156 , that bromide of silver , when boiled , encloses mechanically a portion of the precipitant , which then cannot be washed out .
The loss of weight obtained by reducing the bromide to metallic silver in a current of hydrogen , taken as bromine , gave more nearly agreeing numbers : Calculated .

Vanadium Oxytribromide , or Vanadyl Tribromide , VOBr3 , molec .
wt. =307 3.-The oxytribromide is a dark-red transparent liquid , evolving white fumes on contact with the air , obtained by passing pure and dry bromine over vanadium trioxide ( V , 03 ) heated to redness .
Aoisture prevents the formation of the oxytribromide ; and it not only undergoes sudden decomposition when heated to 180 ?
, but also slowly decomposes at the ordinary atmospheric temperatures .
The boiling-point of the tribromide can , however , be brought below its temperature of decomposition by distillation in vaczud , and the liquid can then be freed completely from bromine by passing a current of dry air through the liquid .
Under a pressure of 100 millims. the oxytribromide boils from 130 ?
to 135 ?
, and may be distilled almost without decomposition .
Vanadium oxytribromide dissolves in water , yielding a yellow-coloured solution , in which both vanadium and bromine were determined , after reduction with sulphurous acid : Calculated .

VANADIUM AND IODINE .
Iodine-vapour does not attack either the trioxide or the nitride at red heat ; both these substances remain unchanged , and no trace of vanadiuin can be detected in the iodine which has passed over them .

THWE METALLIC VANADATES , In the first part of these Researches ( Phil. Trans. 1868 ) it was pointed out ( 1 ) that the salts analyzed by Berzelius must be considered as metaor monobasic vanadates , ( 2 ) that the so-called bivanadates analyzed by Von Hauler are anhydro-saits , and ( 3 ) that the orthoor tribasic vanadates contain 3 atoms of monad metal , the sodium salt being formed artificially by fusing 1 molecule of vanadium pentoxide with 3 molecules of carbonate of soda , when 3 molecules of carbon dioxide are expelled , whilst the orthosalts occur native in many minerals .
The present communication contains a description of these classes of salts , as well as of a new class of salts , the tetrabasic or pyro-vanadates .
Sodium Vanadates .

Orthoor Tri-Sodium Vanadate , Na , VO , -+ 16H11 , 0.--When a mixture of 3 molecules of Na , C,0 and 1 molecule of V2 05 is fused until no further evolution of CO2 is observed , a tribasic vanadate remains as a white crystalline mass .
This mass dissolves easily in water , and on addition of absolute alcohol to the solution two layers of liquid are formed ; the lower one solidifies after a time , forming an aggregation of needle-shaped crystals , which possess a strongly alkaline reaction .
These having been washed with alcohol , and dried on a porous plate over sulphuric acid in vacud , were analyzed with the following results:-Calculated .

=288'0 60-97 60-44 472-3 99'99 The sodium in this and in the following compounds was separated from the vanadium by precipitating the vanadic acid as the perfectly insoluble basic lead salt hereafter described .
This was dried at 100 ?
and weighed , then dissolved in nitric acid and decomposed by sulphuric acid , and the solution of V , 20 in excess of this acid gave on evaporation a finely crystalline mass .
The filtrate from the lead precipitate freed from lead yielded on evaporation sodium sulphate .
Full analytical details of this method , as well as of the other by precipitation as the insoluble ammonium metavanadate , are given in the memoir .
By frequent crystallizations the trisodium vanadate is slowly decomposed into the tetrasodium salt , caustic soda being formed .
This singular reaction was most carefully examined and the amount of sodiium hydroxide liberated determined volumetrically .

Tetrasodium Vanadate , Na , V , 07 + 18H1 O.-This salt crystallizes in beautiful six-sided tables ; it is easily soluble in water , insoluble in alcohol , tand is precipitated by the latter liqui from aqueous solution in wh ; ite scales of a silky lustre .
As long as the salt contains free alkali or tribasic salt , it forms , on precipitation with alcohol , oily drops which solidify after some time .
The tetrasodium vanadate is always formed by the first fusion of vanadic acid with excess of carbonate of soda , and can be easily prepared in the pure state by recrystallization .
