Referring to my paper communicated to the Royal Society A February 16 , 1894 , and read March 15 , 1894 , * in which it was shown that moderately sized plates of sterling silver of a uniform standard could be obtained by casting from thin castings , my attention since then was drawn to the difficulty of casting larger quantities than those described in that paper , which were only of an average weight of 4 to 5 kilogrammes per plate , and to the desirability of obtaining a large plate , say of some 8 or 10 kilogrammes in weight , without f difficulty , and I have therefore resumed my attention towards \#163 ; effecting this .
It appears that considerable difficulties have been c experienced with regard to obtaining large plates of constant standard , j In the Royal Mint Report of 1873 is a memorandum appended by / Professor W. Chandler Roberts , which refers to a series of well-known \lt ; j experiments with regard to obtaining a constant alloy of 0 .
900 silver i by Levol in the Paris Mint , he himself being at the time engaged in r the preparation of a standard silver trial-plate .
Professor Chandler i Roberts states:\#151 ; " From the foregoing remarks it will be evident i it is impossible to cast cl standard silvev plate bar of uniform , I and it was necessary therefore to resort to an artifice in order to \lt ; obtain a standard trial-plate of the required dimensions .
" !
The means adopted by him were to cast 1000 ozs .
of standard silver into a skillet-mould 30 cm .
long , 25 cm .
wide and 5 cm .
broad , to plane off 4 mm. from its surface and to roll the planed skillet to j 1'8 mm. thickness , a sheet being produced 1-5 m. long , 45 cm .
wide .
From this the portion was cut which showed constant results about ; 925 , but which varied from 924 .
6\#151 ; 925 .
1 ; and the rest of the plate which varied from 924 ( lowest ) to 928-4 ( highest ) was abandoned .
He shows all these results by diagrams accompanying his memoranda .
The portion of available constant standard so cut out from the 1000 oz. sheet weighed 104 oz. , about one-tenth of the whole plate .
And this 104 oz. ( = 3-230 kilogrammes ) formed the mint trial plate from a mass of 1000 oz. ( = 31-103 kilogrammes ) specially cast for the purpose .
Notwithstanding that many experiments were subsequently made by Professor Roberts Austen to find a means of obtaining a constant standard trial-plate , in 1899 he was compelled to resort to what he calls the " cumbrous expedient " of 1873 .

125 f the results were satisfactory , and eventually , after no less than .U plates had been cast without success , recourse was had to the method adopted in 1873 , of casting a large mass of metal and detaching a particular portion which proved by assay to be of approximately ^The^astino- of the standard silver into thin instead of into the thick moulds ordinarily employed having been attended with such excellent results , !
I was induced to believe that it must be due to the more rapid coolin^ of the metal , by which liquation was arrested ; so that if the standard silver were cast into moulds sufficiently cooled , liquation might be induced to disappear altogether .
In order then to overcome the difficulty of obtaining the standard trial-plates in larger sizes , commenced by casting quantities of not less than 8 kilogrammes into a mould cooled externally by ice , and also by freezing mixtures as low as 10 ' C. , and by these means I obtained most encouraging results results which confirmed me in the supposition that by cooling with rapidity there is less time for liquation , which appears to be the direct converse of what has been supposed hitherto , viz. : " that a uniformity of standard was best attained by slow and uniform cooling .
% But although I thus obtained exceedingly good results ( two of these are subjoined , see p. 126 ) , I was not satisfied that this was the best way of producing a constant-standard plate .
I therefore adopted a different method of casting the standard silver .
Instead of pouring the melted alloy into a mould from the top , I poured it into a mould by which the skillet was produced from the bottom , thus:\#151 ; Rough Section of Cast-iron Mould employed .
By pouring the alloy into the gate A the metal passes by B into the space C. And instead of cooling the mould by ice or freezing mixture I used the mould simply cold .
I have obtained excellent results by * Thirtieth Annual Report , Deputy Master of Mint , 1899 , pp. 69 , 70 .

The hitherto accepted theory " that the molecular rearrangement is comparatively slight if the mass of metal is slowly and uniformly solidified " * is contradicted by the results I have obtained ; and the results all bear out the fact that there is little or no difficulty in obtaining an 8 or 10-kilogramme plate of constant-standard silver , or even more if necessary .
