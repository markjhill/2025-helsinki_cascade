I. ( On the Distribution of Aqueous Vapour in the upper Parts of the Atmosphere .
" By Lieut.-Col. RICHARD STBACHEY , F.R.S. Received March 25 , 1861 .
The experiments of chemists having shown that any gas will flow into a space occupied by another gas , and diffuse itself there as though the space were a vacuum and the second gas not there , it was suggested by Dalton that the atmosphere might be considered to be a combination of as many distinct atmospheres as it has gaseous components , and that the actions of each of these might be treated of separately , and irrespective of the others .
Meteorologists , pursuing this idea , have proposed to separate the pressure of the aqueous vapour from the whole barometric pressure of the atmophere , and thence to infer the pressure of the permanently elastic portion , or as it has been called , the Gaseous Pressure , or the Pressure of the Dry Air .
It is my object to inquire how far the facts of the matter will support Dalton 's suggestion of the possible independent existence of an atmosphere of aqueous vapour , and whether we can in truth eliminate the pressure of this vapour by subtracting the observed tension from the total barometric pressure , in the manner that has commonly been done of late years .
And first as to the hypothesis of an atmosphere of aqueous vapour pressing only upon itself .
If there be such an atmosphere , the general laws of pressure of elastic fluids will apply to it , as they do to the mixed atmosphere .
But in consequence of the small specific gravity of the vapour , the rate of the diminution of pressure in the upper strata of the vapour atmosphere would be much slower than in the mixed atmosphere ; and irrespective of any variation in the law of the decrease of temperature , the height to which we should have to ascend in the vapour atmosphere to produce a given diminution of pressure , would be to the corresponding height in the mixed atmosphere inversely as the specific gravities of the atmospheres , that is , as 1 to '625 or as 8 to 5 .
Thus by ascending about 19,000 feet in the atmosphere , the barometric pressure is found to be reduced onehalf ; and consequently it would be necessary to ascend to about of 19,000 feet , or upwards of 30,000 feet , to produce a corresponding diminution of pressure in a vapour atmosphere , or to reduce the tension , say from 1 inch to ?
an inch .
Now let us compare this result with the observed facts .
This is done in the annexed Table I. , in which the ratio of the tensions of the vapour at heights extending to 20,000 feet with the surface tension , as actually observed , is set down in juxtaposition with the ratios that should hold good in an independent vapour atmosphere .
We here see that in reality the tension is reduced to one-half of what it is at the earth 's surface by an ascent of about 8000 feet , instead of 30,000 feet , as the hypothesis of the independent vapour atmosphere would require .

Further , the discrepancy between the observations and the hypothesis is so great , and so constant with reference to all the localities , the Himalaya , England , and the mountains of the south of India , while the observa tions are themselves so thoroughly consistent , that the conclusion is inevitable that the hypothesis is untenable .
A similar conclusion as to the entire incompatibility of the hypothesis of a separate vapour atmosphere with the facts , may be drawn quite independently of any observation of tensions , from a mere consideration of the known laws of the diminution of temperature as we ascend .
An argument , something to this effect , will be found in Bessel 's paper on Barometric Heights * ; but its form being too mathematical to be generally intelligible , I shall endeavour to place the matter in a rather more popular point of view .
Let us suppose , then , that we are at a place at the sea-level where the temperature of the air is 80 ?
, the tension of vapour being '80 , which would make the dew-point 72 ?
'5-a case that must be of constant occurrence .
If , now , we rose gradually above the earth 's surface , the temperature of the air would be reduced at the known rate of about 3 ?
for 1000 feet ; while the tensions of vapour , and the corresponding dew-points , calculated upon the hypothesis of an atmosphere of vapour pressing upon itself , would be as follows:ft .

, , 68-0 Hence , up to about 3000 feet , the temperature of the air would be found to be higher than the dew-point , and the supposed tensions might of course exist .
But the temperature of the air , it will be seen , diminishes much more rapidly as we ascend than that of the dew-point ; and the former will therefore soon fall below the latter .
Thus at 4000 feet , the air being at 68 ?
, the theory demands vapour , with a dew-point of 690 ?
9 , which is impossible ; for any vapour , in excess of that corresponding to the air temperature 68 ?
, would be instantly precipitated .
In like manner it might be shown that , under all conceivable conditions of heat or cold , and of damp or dryness at the surface of the earth , we could always ascend to a height where the diminution of temperature would render the progression of the tensions according to the presumed law impossible .
We may therefore conclude generally , that the known diminution of temperature in the atmosphere is ilcompatible with the existence of so large a quantity of vapour in the upper strata as the theory in question demands ; and , consequently , that the tensions observed at the surface are neither dependent on , nor balanced by , the pressure of the vapour in the higher parts of the atmosphere ( in the way in which the entire barometric pressure depends on the weight of the whole superincumbent column of air ) , for this would be insufficient to produce them .
To render an independent vapour atmosphere possible would , indeed , require a fall of temperature in the air of about 1 ?
for 1500 feet , or less than a quarter of that which really takes place .
It will also follow that , as the tension of vapour at any point exceeds the sum of all the pressures of the vapour above it , it must in part be due to the reaction of the air particles , which must therefore press upon those of vapour , contrary to the supposition with which we started .
This is , in fact , equivalent to saying that the air offers a resistance to the diffusion of vapour , instead of having no effect whatever in obstructing it ; and thus from an erroneous assumption , based upon experiments made on very small quantities of air in confined vessels , arises the fallacy of the theory I have been considering .
I am aware of no systematic observations relative to the actual distribution of vapour in the atmosphere , excepting those made by Dr. Joseph hooker , and published in his Himalayan Journals* .
He found in his journeys in Sikim , which extended to heights of 18,000 feet and upwards , that the quantity of vapour was dependent rather on the temperature of the air than on anything else , and that it was , in fact , simply a certain proportion of the maximum quantity that can exist in accordance with the conditions of temperature at any altitude , the relative quantity being pretty nearly constant throughout the whole column .
These conclusions of Dr. Iooker are altogether corroborated by my own observations .
In the annexed Tables I have further illustrated this .

To these calculated ratios are added those actually observed by Dr. Hooker in the Eastern Himalaya , and by Mr. Welsh in his balloon ascents* , as already given in a preceding page .

the results of Dr. Hooker 's and my own observations are given in more detail .
The accordance between the calculated and observed quantities of vapour shown by these figures is so close , that we can have no hesitation in admitting that Dr. Hooker 's conclusion will , in all probability , be found to afford the general solution of this problem .
The relative quantity of vapour in the case of his observations having been rather greater in the higher than in the lower strata of the atmosphere , is a circumstance which cannot be held to affect the general truth of our conclusions , as will be perfectly accounted for by supposing that the diminution of temperature with height was less rapid in reality , than 3 ?
for 1000 feet , on which my calculation is based .
It is further worthy of notice , that the calculated proportion of vapour at various altitudes varies but little even with considerable change of the surface temperature , though there is a manifest ten* Phil. Trans. 1853 , p. 311 .

IiI A. B. dency for the upper strata to contain a rather higher per-centage with a high thaii with a low temperature ; a result likewise in accordance with fact , so far as we are able to judge from the comparison of Dr. IHooker 's Indian observations with those made in England by Mr. Welsh .
The precise determination of the entire pressure of the vapour thus shown by observation to be suspended in the atmosphere is a matter of some difficulty ; but an approximation may be made to it as follows : Let us suppose the weight of the vapour to be measured , as is often done in the case of the entire atmosphere , by the height of a column of the density observed at the surface .
The height of a homogeneous atmosphere of vapour , equivalent to an independent vapour atmosphere , on Dalton 's hypothesis would obviously be } of the height of the homogeneous air atmosphere , that is of 26,250 feet , or about 42,000 feet .
But the vapour actually existing is much less than this .
Taking the results of Dr. IIooker 's observations , and considering the density at the surface to be unity , the mean density of the whole vapour below 20,000 feet will readily be calculated to be about '47 ; so that the whole of the vapour up to this height would be equivalent to a homogeneous column of 9460 feet of density 1 0 .
Now it may be assumed approximately that the quantity of vapour above 20,000 feet will bear the same relation to the entire quantity , as holds good between the densities at that height and at the surface ; and as we see from the Table that the density at 20,000 feet is -1J of what it is at the surface , we may infer that this is the proportion of the vapour above that altitude , the remainder , or x8-i , being below it .
Consequently the whole quantity of vapour , according to Dr. Hooker 's observations , would be equivalent to a homogeneous column of -lQO X9460 , or 11,260 feet .
Using the balloon observations , the height would be rather less than this , viz. 10,050 feet , so that we may infer that the actual pressure of the vapour in the atmosphere is to that represented by the tension at the surface of the earth , as 10,500 to 42,000 , or as about one to four ; and this ratio would also subsist between the actual pressures and observed tensions at all elevations .
The problem might otherwise be solved , by comparing the diminution of density as we ascend , according to Dalton 's hypothesis , and the observations , as shown by the series of figures in Table I. This diminution , it will be seen , takes place in all the series , approximately in a geometrical ratio , so that the density is reduced nearly in an equal proportion for each 2000 feet of ascent , namely , from 1'00 to '96 , that is by -- , on Dalton 's hypothesis ; from 1'00 to '84 , that is by o , according to Dr. Hooker ; and from 100 to '82 , that is by _o , according to Mr. Welsh .
Now it follows , from an obvious mathematical law , that the entire quantities of vapour in these different cases are inversely proportional to the constant reduction of density ; so that the quantity on Dalton 's hypothesis , which is that represented by the observed tension at the surface , is to the quantity according to Dr. Hooker , as sixteen to four , and to the quantity according to Mr. Welsh , as eighteen to four , a result nearly identical with the former .
The subtraction of the observed tension of vapour from the total barometrical pressure , in the hope of obtaining the simple gaseous pressure , must consequently be denounced as an absurdity ; and the barometrical pressure thus corrected , as it is called , has no true meaning whatever .
In conclusion , I would remark that the consideration of the small quantity of vapour that is disseminated in the upper parts of the atmosphere , shows us that inequalities of level on the earth 's surface , which are insignificant when viewed in relation to the dimensions of the globe , become objects of the greatest importance in connexion with the atmosphere which surrounds it .
Three-fourths of the whole mass of the air is within range of the influence of the highest mountains ; one-half of the air and nearly nine-tenths of the vapour are concentrated within about 19,000 feet of the sea-level , a height which hardly exceeds the mean level of the crest of the I-Iimalaya ; while one-fourth of the air and one-half of the vapour are found below a height of 8500 feet .
Thus , mountains even of moderate magnitude may produce important changes in very large masses of the atmosphere , as regards their movements , their temperature , and their hygrometric state ; and especially in those strata that contain the great bulk of the watery vapour , and that have the greatest effect therefore in determining the character of climate .
