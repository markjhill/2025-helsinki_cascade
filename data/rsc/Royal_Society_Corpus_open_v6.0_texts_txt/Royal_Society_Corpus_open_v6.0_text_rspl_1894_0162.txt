[ Feb. 2l , quantity , of water in the bottom of the jar it was noticed that th electrification did not commence to be perceptible generally till about the end of the first minute ; and that it went on augmenting per ceptibly for a minute or more after the bubbling was stopped .
Thp following experiment was therefore tried several times .
One of us stood leaning over the jar , with the head about 10 ins .
above it and the mouth so partly closed that breathing was effected sideways ' another blew the bellows ; and another took the readings of the electrometer .
After bubbling had been going on for some minutes and the readings were rising gradually ( 4 volts per 10 minutes , as in S 18 ) , blowing was stopped .
As soon as the bubbling ceased , the first-mentioned observer , without moving his head or his body ( see S 7 , regarding the necessity to have the electrometer screened from outside influences ) blew into the jar to displace the negatively electrified air in it .
In every case the electrometer reading showed instantly a small rise in the positive direction .
In the carrying out of these experiments we have received much valuable help from Walter Stewart , M.A. , and Patrick Hamilton , B.Sc. S 33 .
The very interesting experiments described by Lenard , in his paper on the Electricity of Waterfalls , * and by Professor J. J. Thomson , on the Electricity of Drops , f show phenomena depending , no doubt , on the properties of matter to which we must look for explanation of the electrical effects of bubbling described in our present communication , and of the electrification of air by drops of water falling through it , to which we have referred as having been found in previous experiments which were commenced in 1890 for the investigation of the passage of electrified air through tubes .

" Note on the Spectrum of Argon .
" By H. F. Newall Communicated by Lord Rayleigh .
Received February 14 , 1895 .
In the course of a spectroscopic investigation in which I have been for some time past engaged , a line spectrum , which so far as I was able to make out was unknown , has frequently presented itself upon my photographs .
It appeared in May and June , 1894 , under conditions which led me to call it , for the sake of convenience , " the low-pressure spectrum .

I |g95 ] Note on the Spectrum of Argon .
347 | jj^oral to borrow the first letter of Lord Rayleigh 's and Professor I uamgay 's names to give to the unknown lines , and in the measurements of the photographs which showed the lines well , there appears ( an " R " against seventeen lines out of sixty-one measured , the re-t maining lines being known to belong to Hg , H , N , and nitrocarbons .
It transpires now , as I learnt from reading the abstract of the paper I in which Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay describe their consummate researches on argon , that the symbol " A " should have been used instead of " R " to designate the lines on my photographs .
For the lines are Argon lines .
The conditions under which the spectrum of argon has appeared in my investigations are of interest at the present time , and I hope a description of them may not be unacceptable .
A glass bulb was sealed hermetically to a mercury pump of the Hagen-Topler form , in which there was strong sulphuric acid floating on the surface of the mercury .
The bulb was exhausted as low as possible and refilled with air .
The pressure was reduced to about | 180 Millionths of an atmosphere ( = 0*14 mm. ) , at which pressure a bright discharge could be passed through the residual gases by means of Professor J. J. Thomson 's method of surrounding the bulb by a coil of wire , which carries a very rapidly alternating current produced [ by the discharge of a condenser .
The discharge was passed for thirty minutes , during which time a photograph of the spectrum was taken .
The pressure of the gas in the bulb fell during the passage of the discharge from the value | 174 M ( = 013 mm. ) to 112 M ( = 0 085 mm. ) .
The spectrum shows the bands of nitrogen strong , also mercury lines and nitrocarbon .
groups strong , hydrogen weak , no oxygen or argon .
Again the discharge was passed for thirty minutes and a new photograph was taken .
The pressure fell from 100 M ( = 0'076mm .
) to 20 M ( = 0015 mm. ) ; the nitrogen spectrum had faded considerably , and there had appeared a number of fine lines which I was unable , in spite of careful efforts , to identify with the lines of any known substances .
The nature of my method of investigation of spectra is such that it is not difficult to pick out of the numerous spectra which appear superposed on the photographic plate , the lines which belong to any 1 'ne spectrum .
[ The photographic reproductions sent herewith show j cleai\gt ; ly the ease with which this may be done .
] The results of measurement made in the last few days of seventy-two lines in nay " low-pressure spectrum " are given below , and side by side are given the measurements of the wave-lengths determined by Mr. Crookes for the argon lines .
The agreement of the measurements shows conclusively that we | ave been measuring the same spectrum .
Between Hy and wave-vql , lvii .
2 c Mr. H. F. Newall .
[ *4.21 , length 370 , the agreement is all that we could hope for , taking iuto account the fact that my measurements were not made with a view 0'f l giving a final and carefully-considered set of measurements of Wave\gt ; lengths , but between Hy and Up there is a systematic difference of about 3 tenth-metres , which I am unable at present to account for The agreement of grouping and intensity , however , leaves no doubt as to the identity of the spectrum of my low-pressure lines with the spectrum of argon .
I have reduced my measurements with reference to Rowland 's scale of wave-lengths , and I infer from the value adopted for the H/ j ( F ) line , that Angstrom 's scale has been used in Mr. Crookes ' reduction .
The difference between the scales is not enough to account for the discrepancies above referred to .
The experiments were repeated , with slight variations , several times with results which , so far as the spectrum of argon is concerned , were constant .
But it was noted that continued passage of the discharge appears to result in the attaining of a certain minimum pressure , after which there is slight and slow rise to a tolerably-fixfed pressure .
It is not necessary to dwell on these points in the present note .
It is interesting to find argon asserting itself , unsolicited , in quite new circumstances , and under conditions which practically constitute one more mode of separating argon from nitrogen\#151 ; namely , the getting rid of nitrogen by passing electric discharge through it in the presence of hydrogen or moisture and acid .
