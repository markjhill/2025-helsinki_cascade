Philosophical enquiries require some corrections , which do not enter into mathematical calculus ; for example , in some cases the calculus changes the quantities from negative to affirmative , &amp;c. when from philosophical considerations they are not changed ; and , vice versa , they may be changed to affirmative , &amp;c. on philosophical considerations , when they are not changed from the calculus : and also a body may stop , &amp;c. from philosophical considerations , as in the preceding example , when it does not follow from the algebraical calculus , &amp;c. It is further to be observed , that resistances are always to be taken affirmatively .
Ex. 2 .
Let the accelerating force be as the arc , that is , the distance from the lowest point , and the resistance as the velocity ; then will the fluxional equation ( F V ) A= w be ( ax v ) x= w , which is an homogeneous equation of the first order : write in it zx for v , and its fluxion for v , and there results the equation ( ax zx ) xx= zx2z z2xx , whence ( a z ) x= zxz z2x and x/ x = zz/ a z+ z2 , and thence log .
x= 1/ 2 log .

arc , whose radius is ~ 4a 1/ 2 and tangent ( z 1/ 2 ) + B , whence can be found v= xz , and from curvilinear areas t= x/ v. If 4a is less than 1 , then it becomes log .
x=W 1/ 4~1/ 4-a x log z-~1/ 4-a-1/ 2/ z+~1/ 4-a-1/ 2 + B ; where B is an invariable quantity to be assumed according to the conditions of the problem .
Cor. If the force be directly as the distance , or as the arc of the curve from the body to the lowest point , and the resistance as the velocity ; then will the velocity in one arc be to the velocity in the corresponding point of another arc , as the arcs to be described ; and consequently the times equal .

If the body is acted on by forces tending to points S , S ' , S ' ' , &amp;c. situated in different planes , then let F be the sum of the forces in the direction of the tangent at the point P ; F ' and F ' ' the sum of the forces acting on the body in two different directions at the same point , which are not situated in the same plane with the tangent and each other ; from the three equations ( F + X'V ) A= w and v2/ C = 1/ 2F ' and v2/ C = 1/ 2F ' ' , in which the same letters denote the same quantities as before , and C and C ' denotes the chords of curvature in the same directions as the forces F ' and F ' ' , which from the curve being given can be found at any point ; and if F ' or F ' ' is given in terms of the distance from a given point , or an absciss or ordinate , &amp;c. the velocity v can be found in terms of the same , and X'V by a simple algebraical equation : if F ' is not given , and V is a given function of v , substitute in V for v its value ~(1/ 2 Cx F ' ) , and there results an equation expressing the relation between F ( which can be deduced from F ' or F ' ' ) and the distance of the body from some given point , or the abscissae and ordinates of the curve required , and their fluxions .
If some of the forces act in parallel directions ; the forces , velocities , &amp;c. may be found by the same method .

Let a body be projected in a direction HL with a given velocity , and be acted on by a force in a direction parallel to AP = x , which varies as Xa function of x ; and also by another force in a direction parallel to MP = y , that is , perpendicular to AP , which force varies as Ya function of y ; and let it move in a medium , of which the resistance is proportional to the velocity ; to find the curve described .
Find the fluent of ( X + av ) x= w , which corrected according to the conditions of the problem ( viz. so that v at the point H may be to the velocity of projection : : Hc : Hb , where bc is drawn perpendicular to AP ) suppose v= X ' ; find the fluent of x/ X ' , which corrected so as to become = o , when x= AH , let be X ' ' .
In the same manner find the fluent of ( Y + a'v ' ) y= v'v ' , which corrected , so that v ' at the point H may be to the velocity of projection : : cb : Hb , suppose v ' = Y ' ; find the fluent of y/ Y ' , which corrected so as to become = o , when PM = o , let be = Y ' ' ; assume X ' ' = Y ' ' , and thence from x find y : take AP =x and PM = y , and M will be a point in the curve , which a body projected in the line HL describes ; and if Mm in the direction parallel to HAP : mo perpendicular to it : : velocity v : velocity v ' , then will Mo be a tangent to the curve in the point M. 2 .
If a body is acted on by forces tending to any given points S , S ' , S ' ' , &amp;c. which vary as given functions of their distances from the body , and resisted by a force which varies according to a given function V of the velocity ( v ) into its density X ' , where X ' varies according to some function of the distances from the given points , &amp;c. ; to find the curve described .

The same principles may be applied to cases , in which some of the forces act in parallel directions .

Given the respective places of ( n ) bodies S , S ' , S ' ' , S ' ' ' , &amp;c. in the curves A , A ' , A ' ' , A ' ' ' , &amp;c. at the same time , and in the same plane , and the forces of all the bodies acting on S , except two , S ' and S ' ' ; to find the forces of the two bodies S ' and S ' ' on the body S. This proposition may be resolved by the method given in Prop. 4 .
for to produce the same effect the same finite forces will be requisite , whether the centers of forces rest or move in given curves .
1.2 .
If the bodies S , S ' , S ' ' , &amp;c. move in different planes , then all the forces acting on the body , except three , may be given , which may be acquired from the method given in the same proposition .
Hence it appears , that 2n forces may be requisite to be found from the conditions of the problem to determine all the bodies to move in their respective curves , when they are all situated in the same plane , and that 3xn forces may be requisite in different planes , &amp;c. if the force of one body ( S ' ) on another ( S ' ' ) does not at all depend on the force of the same body ( S ' ) on any other ( S ' ' ' ) ; and if the same can be praedicated of the rest , then n. n3 forces of the above mentioned bodies in the same , or n. n4 forces in different planes may be assumed at will .

then make a/ v = a'/ v ' = a''/ v ' ' = &amp;c. = b/ V , or which is equal to it = . .
b'/ V ' or = b''/ V ' ' = &amp;c. From the fluents of the fluxional equations resulting properly corrected will be found the arcs a , a ' , a ' ' , &amp;c. described by the bodies in the curves A , A ' , A ' ' , &amp;c. in the same time as the correspondent arcs b , b ' , b ' ' &amp;c. ; and from thence , by the method given in the preceding case , may be deduced the forces .
The same principles may be applied to bodies moving in resisting mediums .
PRO P. XII .
Given the law of the forces of two bodies acting on each other , to find the two curves by them described .
Fig. 12 .
Assume x and y for the absciss ( AP ) and ordinate ( PM ) of one curve , and z and u for the absciss ( AP ' ) and ordinate ( P'M ' ) of the other ; where the abscissae AP and AP ' begin from the same point A , and are situated in the same line ; then will the distance ( D = M'M ) between the bodies = ~ z~x2 +~ u~y2 ) ; let the forces of the body placed at M on that at M ' , and of the body placed at M ' on that at M vary . .
as ~ : ( D ) = F , and ~ ' : ( D ) = F ' ; and let Mp =x and pm = y ; then will cosine of the angle mMM ' to radius ( 1 ) be y~u/ D x . . .

In the same manner let x~z/ D x z/ ~ z2 + u2~y~u/ D x u/ ~ z2 + u2=c ' , the cosine of the angle made between the distance MM ' and arc of the curve of which the absciss is z and ordinate u , and consequently c ' x F ' will be the force in the direction of its ... .

The five equations are easily reduced to three by exterminating the quantities v and v ' .
The fluxional equation resulting will most commonly be of the fifth order , as evidently appears from the nature of the problem .
2 .
The same principles may be applied to determine the curves , when the bodies move in mediums , of which the resistances are given : for example , suppose the resistances to vary as a function of the distance from a given point into a function of the velocity : to the forces in the directions of the tangents contained in the preceding case must be added or subtracted the given resistances for the forces in the directions of the tangents , and the remaining process will be the same as is before given .
If two bodies describe similar orbits round a common center , either quiescent or moving uniformly in a right line ; the forces and velocities and resistances of the medium will be to each other in correspondent points as their respective distances from the center .
PRO P. XIII .
Given the forces acting on any bodies , and tending to points either moveable or quiescent , or in the direction of the tangents , &amp;c. ; to find the curve described by one of the bodies .
1 .
Assume x and y for the absciss and ordinate of the curve required , and from thence may be deduced the distances from any quiescent center of force , and consequently the force f in that direction ; resolve it into two others , one in the direction of the tangent , and the other in a different one ; for example , let it be in a direction perpendicular to the tangent , and from . .
their fluxions x and y , and the force f may , by the method before given , be deduced the forces in the two above mentioned directions ; and in the same manner may be found from x , y , . .

2 .
If some of the centers of force move in given curves B , B ' , B ' ' , &amp;c. whose arcs let be denoted by B , B ' , &amp;c. and their respective places at the same time are given ; then from their respective places given and forces , . .
and x and y , and x and y , can , as before , be deduced the forces in the direction of the tangent and its perpendicular to the curve required .

If other centers of forces move in given curves A , A ' , A ' ' , &amp;c. and the velocities are given at every point of the curves ; let A , A ' , A ' ' , &amp;c. be the arcs of the curves A , A ' , A ' ' , &amp;c. and suppose v , v ' , v ' ' , &amp;c. their correspondent velocities ; then , if the increments of the time ... be given , will A/ v=A'/ v'=A''/ v''= &amp;c. but as the velocities are given at every point of the curves , v in the curve ( A ) will be given in terms of its absciss , ordinate , arc , &amp;c. and consequently .
A/ v in terms of the same quantities and their first fluxions ; the . .
same may be affirmed of the fluxions A'/ v ' , A''/ v ' ' , in the curves A ' , . .
A ' ' , &amp;c. ; hence , from the equation A/ v=A'/ v ' , can be deduced the relation between the absciss or ordinate , &amp;c. of the curve A and its correspondent absciss or ordinate , &amp;c. of the curve A ' ; and so of the remaining curves ; hence this case is reduced to the preceding ; but it is necessary also , that the times of the bodies in the two cases should be the same , in order that the . .
places may correspond , and consequently A/ v=B/ V , where V denotes the velocity of the body at any point of the curve B from which equation can be deduced the correspondent abscissae and ordinates , &amp;c. of the curves B and A ; and thence the two cases are reduced to the preceding , whence the correspondent forces in the directions of the tangent , and perpendicular to it , can be found as above .

If some ( m ) of the centers move in curves L , L ' , L ' ' , &amp; c to be deduced from the laws of the forces being given which act on them ; assume z and u , z ' and u ' , z ' ' and u ' ' , &amp;c. for their respective abscissae .
and correspondent ordinates ; and from them and y and x , y and .
x , find the forces acting on the body moving in the curve required in the direction of the tangent , and perpendicular to it , as before ; then add all the forces deduced which act perpendicular to the tangent and also all contained in the direction of the tangent together with the resisting force in the same direction , and let the sums resulting be respectively F and F ' : by the same method find the sum of the forces which act on the bodies moving in L , L ' , L ' ' , &amp;c. in the directions of the tangents , and perpendiculars to them , which suppose S and s , S ' and s ' , S ' ' and s ' ' , &amp;c. ; then reduce the 2 ( m + 1 ) equations of the formulae found above , viz. v2=Fxx2+y211/ 2/ yx-xy and -w=F ' ~ x2+y2 ; v'2=s x z2+u211/ 2/ uz-zu and -v'v'=S x~ z2+u2 ; v''2 = s ' x z'2+u211/ 2/ u'z'-z'u ' and -v ' ' x v''=S ' x~ z''2+u''2 , &amp;c. ; where v , v ' , v ' ' , v ' ' ' , &amp;c. respectively denote the correspondent velocities of the bodies moving in the curves , whose abscissae are .
x , z , z ' , z ' ' , &amp;c. ; and also the ( m+1 ) equations B/ V=~ x2+y2/ v= ~ z2+u2/ v'=~ ( z'2+u'2)/ v''=~ ( z''2+u''2)/ v'''= &amp;c. containing the 3 ( m+1~ ) +1 variable quantities x and y , z and u , z ' and u ' , z ' ' and u ' ' , &amp;c. , v , v ' , v ' ' , &amp;c. , and the variable quantity contained in B and V , into one , so that all the variable quantities except x and y and their fluxions may be exterminated , and there results an equation to the curve required expressing the relation between x and y its absciss and ordinate , and their fluxions .

If the forces are not situated in the same plane , assume X , x and y , for the two abscissae and ordinates of the curve required ; and Z , z and u ; Z ' , z ' and u ' ; Z ' ' , z ' ' and u ' ' ; &amp;c. for the two abscissae and ordinates of the ( m ) curves L , L ' , L ' ' , &amp;c. respectively ; and from the preceding method may be acquired the 3 ( m + 1 ) equations v2 =Fx C , v2 = F ' x C ' , and w = F ' ' x~ X2 + x2 + y2 ; v'2 =Sx C ' , v'2 = ~c ' and v'v ' =sx~ Z2 + z2 + u2 ; v''2 = S'C ' ' = ~ ' c ' ' and v''v ' ' = s ' x ~ ( Z'2 + z'2 + u'2 ) ; v'''2 = S''C ' ' ' = ~ ' ' c ' ' ' and v'''v ' ' ' = s ' ' x ~ ( Z''2 + z''2 + u''2 ) ; &amp;c. ; in which v denotes the velocity in the required curve , and v ' , v ' ' , v ' ' ' ' , &amp;c. the correspondent velocities in the curves L , L ' , L ' ' , &amp;c. ; and F , F ' , and F ' ' ; S , ~ and s ; S ' , ~ ' and s ' ; S ' ' , ~ ' ' and s ' ' ; &amp;c. denote the forces acting on the respective bodies in two different planes and in the tangents , which planes cut each other in the tangents of the curves ; and C and c , &amp;c. , C ' and c ' , &amp;c. , C ' ' and c ' ' , &amp;c. the 1/ 2 chords or radii of curvature in those two planes to the different curves in the directions of the forces ; and also the ( m + 1 ) equations before mentioned B/ V =~ X2 + x2 + y2/ v =~ Z2 + z2 + u2/ v ' =~ Z'2 + z'2 + u'2/ v ' ' = &amp;c. ; where ~ X2 + x2 + y2 , ~ Z'~ + z'2 + u'2 , &amp;c. are the fluxions of the arcs of the required curve , and of the curves L , L ' , L ' ' , &amp;c. reduce these 4m +4 equations containing taining 4m +5 variable quantities into two , so that all the variable quantities except three , X , x , and y , and their fluxions may be exterminated ; and there result the two equations required .
It may be observed , that when the resistance arising from the density of the medium and velocity ( v ) of the body varies as X ' x v2 + X , where X and X ' are as functions of the distances from given points , the resolution of the fluxional equations will generally be more easy , than when the resistance varies as other functions of the velocities .
If the force acts equally on the particles of the body and fluid , then the force by which a body descends in a medium is as the whole force X acting on the body at the given distance multiplied into a fraction whose numerator is the difference between the density of the body ( D ) and fluid ( X ' ) at that distance and denominator D , that is , as XxD X'/ D. Many cases might have been given , in which the fluxional equations could have been resolved ; but in general their fluents can only be found by means of converging serieses .

The force in the direction PS is as the ultimate ratio of 2x QR ( the space through which a body is drawn from the direction of its motion in the tangent in a given time towards the center of force ) ; but ultimately 2QR = 2QP2/ PV , where QP is as the space described in a given time , and consequently as the velocity ( V ) of the body at the given point P , and PV the chord of curvature in the direction SP .

The increment ( Pp ) of the space divided by the velocity V is ultimately as the increment of the time , and = the increment of the velocity ( V ) divided by the force 2V2/ PV x PIE / SP in the direction of the tangent , that is , Pp/ V = Vx PV x SP/ 2V2 x PIE ; for Pp substitute Yh x PO/ PIE , and there results -P x PO/ PIE xV =Vx PV x SP/ 2V2 x PIE ; and consequently -2P x PO/ SP x PV = V/ V ; but SP x PV/ 2PO = SY = P , whence -P/ P = V/ V , and V= a/ p , where a is an invariable quantity .
Cor. Since Vx P , that is , SY the perpendicular multiplied into the velocity ( which is ultimately as Pp the space described in a given time ) is ultimately as the area described round the center S in a given time ; but this rectangle = a , a given quantity ; therefore the area , described round the center of force S in a given time , will be a given quantity , and thence in unequal times will be proportional to the times .

The sagitta QR is ultimately as the force , when the time is given ; and when the time is not given , it will be as the force into the square of the time ; from which expression , by substituting for QR and the time their values , may be deduced several others .

Let ~x = X ' and X= b , which is supposed to correspond nearly to the state of our atmosphere , then will v2 =2x e-~ 2aX'x x~ e~ 2aX'x x Xx =2x e-~ 2aex x~ e~ 2aex xx bx = 2e-2aex-b x ( ~ e2aex+b x bx + A ) , e being the number , whose hyperbolic log .
is 1 , and h and A quantities to be assumed according to the conditions of the problem .

Let X= X ' , and it becomes Xx = w/ 1 + aV , and t= v/ X ( 1 + aV ) .

Let X be an homogeneous function of one dimension of x , that is , = ax , and Va similar function of n dimensions of v , that is = bvn , and X ' a similar function of r dimensions of x and v , and n+r= 1 ; then by substituting zx and its fluxion for v and its fluxion , can be found the fluent of the fluxional equation ( X + aVX ' ) x= w , and consequently the velocity and time by the quadrature of curves in terms of the space ; and in like manner of many other cases .

Let a body moving in a given curve be acted on at any point P by a force f tending to a given point S , and resisted by a medium proportional to Va function of its velocity multiplied into its density X ' a function of the distance SP = D ; to find its velocity , time , and distance from the given point S in terms of each other .
Let F=fx PIE / SP the force in the direction of the tangent PIE , and consequently ( F + VX ' ) A= w , and v2 = 1/ 2 Cx f , where A is the increment of the arc , and C the chord of curvature in the direction SP ; but since the curve is given , the chord of curvature may be deduced from the distance , &amp;c. and the increment A of the arc from a function of the distance multiplied into the increment of the distance ; then , if f or v be a given function of the distance , the other may be deduced from it , and consequently w = ~ : ( D ) xD will be a given function of the distance D multiplied into D , whence we have ~ : ( D ) xD=D ( fx PIE / SP + X'V ) divide by D , and there results an algebraical equation , from which Vx X ' may be found .
If neither v nor f be given , reduce the two equations ( f x PIE / SP + VX ' ) A= w and v2 = 1/ 2 Cf into one , so as to exterminate either f or v and its fluxions , and there results an equation expressing the relation between the other v or f and D and their fluxions : from the velocity given in terms of D may be deduced the time from the equation t= A/ v. 3.2 .
If the body be acted on by forces tending to more points S , S ' , S ' ' , S ' ' ' , &amp;c. in the same plane ; resolve each of the forces into two ; one in the direction of the tangent , and the other perpendicular to it ; let the sum of the forces in the direction of the tangent be F ; and in the direction perpendicular to it be F ' ; and 2R the diameter of curvature at the point P , which will be given in terms of the distances from two points , or of an absciss and ordinate , and their fluxions , &amp;c. : assume the two equations before given ( F + X'V ) A= w and v2 = F'R , and since A is always given in terms of D and D , if F and F ' be given in terms of D , D ' , &amp;c. the value of Vx X ' may be acquired by a simple algebraical equation : but if F and F ' be not given , and consequently v not given , but Va given function of v , and X ' a given function of the above mentioned distances ; then substitute for v its value ~(F'R ) in the function V , and the fluxion of 1/ 2 F'R for w , and there will result an equation involving D and F ' and their fluxions , and F ; but if the forces tending to all the points but one are given in terms of the distance D , or absciss or ordinate of the curve , and their fluxions ; then from F ' can be found F , and , vice versa , from F can be found F ' , and consequently there results a fluxional equation expressing the relation between F or F ' and the distance D or D ' , &amp;c. or absciss or ordinate , and their fluxions .
From F and F ' , and consequently v being found in terms of D , D ' , &amp;c. can be deduced t= v/ F. The same method may be applied , if some forces tend to an infinite distance , that is , act parallel to themselves , and others tend to given points .
Ex. Let the accelerating force be directly as the arc = x , and the resistance uniform = a ; then will ( x a ) x= w , and consequently x2 2ax +B= v2 ; let A be the arc , where the velocity = 0 ; then will the equation A2 2aA x2 + 2ax = v2 , and the increment of the time t= x/ v = x/ ~(A2 2aA x2 + 2ax ) , whose integral is 1/ A aX arc of a circle , of which the radius is Aa and cos.=x a , where A is the distance of the point from which the body begins to fall , and the lowest point of the curve ; and the accelerating force xa is as the distance from a point ( a ) of a curve , of which the distance from the lowest is a. Cor. The times of the body falling from any point of the curve to a will be equal .
Cor. The body on this hypothesis will either rest at the point a , or at the lowest point , or any point between +a and
