58 Nitrification of Sewage .
By Geokge Reid , M.D. , D.P.H. ( Communicated by Professor Gotch , F.R.S. Received May 7 , \#151 ; Read November 1 , 1906 .
) My special object in this paper is to direct attention to certain observations I have recently made bearing upon depth of filters and grade of particles as affecting both the quality of the work done and the capital outlay involved .
To effect the necessary changes it is essential that the sewage in a fine film shall be brought into intimate contact with the nitrifying organisms in the presence of an adequate supply of oxygen .
It follows , therefore , that the larger the number of organisms employed , so long as they are maintained in a healthy active condition , the greater the amount and the better the quality of the work done .
How then should a filter bed be constructed , so that , within a given cubic space , it shall afford the largest possible surface for bacterial growth under healthy conditions ?
Clearly , I suggest , by reducing the particles composing the filter to the smallest size which is found to be compatible with free aeration .
Compare , from the point of view of effective working area , a filter formed of 2-inch cubes\#151 ; a grade in common use at present\#151 ; with one formed of -^-inch cubes , and it will be found that , bulk for bulk , the area in the latter case.is 16 times greater than in the former , but taking into account the relatively larger space occupied by the smaller particles , the actual gain is as 1 to 14-7 .
The question is , then , to what extent in actual practice is it possible to reduce the size of the filter particles ?
Some four years ago I had an opportunity of conducting an experiment on a large and practical scale at Hanley with a plant which complied with all the conditions which previous experience had shown me to be essential , including , for the first time I believe , perfect and uniform distribution of the sewage on to the filter by means of a power-driven apparatus .
Shortly , this plant , which dealt with 500,000 gallons per day ( 1,000,000 gallons per acre ) , consisted of:\#151 ; 1 .
A detritus tank and strainer of the usual type .
2 .
Three subsidence tanks having a total capacity equal to one-eighth the daily dry weather flow .
3 .
An open septic tank with a capacity of seven-eighths the daily flow Nitrification of Sewage .
59 ( giving , with the subsidence tanks , a capacity for quiescence equal to a day 's flow ) .
4 .
Two quarter-acre'"percolating " filters 4 feet 9 inches deep , the one circular and the other rectangular , and each having a different type of power-driven distributor .
I may here mention that I have long since discarded the " contact " method of working bacteria beds in favour of what is termed " percolating " filtration .
The filtering medium in this case consisted of broken " saggars , " the discarded hard-burned clay vessels in which china is packed for firing , and the filters were constructed in four separate sections , each having different graded material .
This material ranged ( in separate sections ) from inch to \#163 ; inch .
I have elsewhere given a full description of the working of this plant during a period of about eighteen months , and the results proved that such filters , working at the rate of 200 gallons per square yard per 24 hours ( 1,000,000 gallons per acre ) continuously , produce a high-class effluent , the best results being obtained from the section of the filter composed of the finest grade particles ( \#163 ; inch ) .
So much for the preliminary work which led up to the present investigations , the results of which seem to me to be of scientific interest and of practical importance .
It would seem to be established that the nitrification of hydrolysed sewage takes place in stages , the nitrous change being effected by one set of organisms as a preliminary to the nitric change brought about by another set , and the theory is that the two sets of organisms are located in different layers of the filter .
With the view of verifying this , and , at the same time , ascertaining the degree of purification effected at different depths , I determined to tap the filter which had been used for the purpose of the experiment already referred to , in such a manner that samples might be collected at different levels , and I selected the finest grade section for this purpose ( \#163 ; -inch particles ) .
Accordingly , four longitudinal shallow trays , with perforated covers , were placed in the body of the filter , the first at 1 foot from the surface , the second and third at 1-foot intervals downwards , and the lowest 18 inches below the third one , pipes being carried from the various collecting trays through the wall of the filter , to allow of the collection of the respective samples .
In order that the results from the lower depths might not be affected by the presence of the trays above , the trays were placed obliquely from above downwards , so that no tray had another in the vertical line above it .
As the filter at this time had been constantly at work for two and a-half years , in replacing the filtering material which had been disturbed in order to introduce the trays care was taken to ensure as far as possible that each portion !

[ May 7 , was placed in the position it had previously occupied in the depth of the filter , and seven days were allowed to elapse for recovery before collecting the first samples .
As regards .analytical methods , the free ammonia was determined in the usual way by distillation and Nesslerising , and the albuminoid ammonia by Wanklyn 's process , the quantities taken respectively being\#151 ; sewage , detritus tank , and septic tank , 50 c.c. , filter effluents , 500 c.c. , the former being made up to 500 c.c. by ammonia-free water .
The oxygen absorbed was determined by Tidy 's process , the nitrous nitrogen by Griess ' method , and the nitric nitrogen by Sprengel 's method .
In order to discount possible subsequent changes from the lower to the higher oxide , and vice versd , the tests for nitrous and nitric nitrogen were made at the works immediately on the collection of the samples , and again in the laboratory the following day , when the complete analyses were made .
The following figures represent the mean results of a series of analyses , the individual figures of which are given in the detailed tables attached .
The samples were collected at intervals extending over a period of about six months , the filters being steadily worked at the previous rate , namely , 200 gallons per superficial yard per 24 hours , and the delivery being uniform and continuous day and night .
In the first place , before commenting generally on the conclusions which may be drawn from the results as a whole , I propose to refer shortly to each analytical record separately :\#151 ; 1 .
With regard to the suspended solids it will be noticed that a reduction of 73 per cent , is effected in the detritus tanks , and that a further reduction of 15 per cent , takes place in the septic tank , making a total reduction of 88 per cent. , and resulting in an effluent being passed on to the filter containing 7"6 parts per 100,000 , exactly one-half of which is mineral matter .
This suspended matter , it will be seen , is practically all retained in the top layer of the filter , where the organic portion is liquefied , in all probability , by aerobic organisms .
The mineral matter , however , must remain in the filter , and in time , no doubt , it will be found necessary to remove the filtering medium to a depth of a few inches for the purpose of washing it , but so far , after over three years ' constant working , no such necessity has arisen .
As a matter of fact , if the total mineral suspended solids passing on to the filter during the three years were deposited in a uniform layer over the whole surface , the depth of the coating would be less than inch .

The reduction of the free ammonia at a depth of 1 foot is remarkable , especially considering the fact that the change has been effected in about 1906 .

[ May 7 , 12 minutes\#151 ; the time occupied by the sewage in passing downward through the first foot of filter .
In my experience it is not unusual to find the free ammonia figure reduced almost to an equal extent in effluents from fine-grade filters , but , hitherto , I had no conception that the change was brought about by so shallow a depth of filter .
I may here mention that the rate of travel downwards of the sewage through the filter was found , as the result of several observations , to vary in accordance with the depth as follows:\#151 ; From surface to 1 ft ... ... ... ... . .
12 mins .
" 1ft .

12 " \#187 ; 2 " " 3 , , ... ... ... ... ... .
6 " " 3 " " 4 ft. 6 in ... ... ... . .
5 " Total ... ... ... ... ... 35 " This is a slow rate of travel compared with the rate in the case of large particle filters , which , in my experience , in some cases allow the sewage to pass through the entire depth of from 4 to 5 feet in about four minutes .
The rate of travel was ascertained by a series of observations as follows:\#151 ; The delivery on the filter was stopped until the discharge pipes from the respective trays showed unmistakable signs of diminished flow , when it was started again , the period which elapsed before the discharge from the pipes was restored being taken as the time occupied in the passage downward of the sewage to the different depths .
The free ammonia figure presents one other interesting feature .
It will be noticed that the progressive reduction which takes place during the passage downwards through the first 3 feet is suddenly interrupted , a considerable increase in the amount being recorded at a depth of 4 feet 6 inches .
Accidental error in analysis does not explain this , for it will be seen on referring to the detailed tables that this increase is invariably recorded , and , as a matter of fact , I verified the accuracy of the results by a second analysis in the case of the first few samples until it became quite obvious that no such explanation of the occurrence was feasible .
This phenomenon will be referred to later in dealing with the general arguments and conclusions .
3 .
As regards the albuminoid ammonia figure , it will be seen that a highly satisfactory reduction is effected by filtration through 1 foot only .
In fact , this figure and the oxygen absorbed and nitric nitrogen figures considered together indicate a very high degree of purification , which precludes the possibility of subsequent putrefactive change .

It will be seen that the reduction in the oxygen absorbed is , stage by Nitrification of Sewage .

] stage , proportionate to the albuminoid ammonia reduction , and the rapidity of the change in this case also is equally marked .
5 .
With reference to the oxidised nitrogen the figures are very startling , for not only are they indicative of extremely healthy and active biological conditions , but , considered in relation to the other figures , they also demonstrate conclusively , in the case of the sewage in question at any rate , that the work of purification is practically completed within a few inches of the surface of the filter .
Within 12 minutes a foul and offensive liquid is rendered not only clear and non-odorous , but also absolutely stable as regards putrescible qualities , as is proved by the oxygen absorbed figures before and after incubation .
I must say that this result surprised me very much .
Theoretically , as I have said , one expected to find that the process was a more gradual and progressive one , nitrites being formed chiefly in the superficial layers of the filter and nitrates in the deeper layers , but this did not prove to be the case .
At the same time I do not suggest that the change is not gradational , but rather that the two sets of organisms are at work side by side , and in this case the absence of more than a trace of nitrous acid in the 1-foot effluent , although the tests were applied at the moment of collection , may be accounted for by the preliminary stage of the oxidation process being an extremely evanescent one owing to the highly efficient working conditions .
6 .
The column headed " depth of column necessary to obscure test lines " requires explanation .
It is a standard opacity test which I adopted some years ago for Staffordshire , and which has since been adopted by some other river authorities .
The lines referred to are engraved on a white porcelain disc , which is attached by means of a socket and rubber washer to a 2-foot glass tube , graduated in half-inches .
The exact mesh and depth of lines are as shown in the drawing , and in fixing the scale as regards mesh and length of tube , in the first instance , I was guided by my experience at the time as to the opacity of well-clarified effluents .
I have since found , however , that the clarification effected by fine-grade filters and efficient distribution is so perfect that the lines are not usually obscured by a depth of 24 inches , and this was the case in the present instance .
It will be noticed that while the mean depths of fluid necessary to obscure the lines in the case of the crude sewage and the detritus and septic tank effluents were 0*5 , 1*6 , and 1*5 inches respectively , the filter effluents , even those from the 1-foot tray , were so highly clarified that the full 24-inch column did not suffice to obscure the lines .
It is true that the opacity test in itself is not a reliable index of purity ; 64 Dr. G. Reid .
[ May 7 , at the same time , such a record , considered in conjunction with that of the suspended solids , is useful for comparative purposes .
For convenient reference , I have shown in the form of a diagram the percentage reduction in free ammonia , albuminoid ammonia , and oxygen absorbed at different stages , the figures for the sewage being taken at 100 , and also the actual nitric nitrogen figures in parts per 100,000 .

Whether what has been proved to be possible in this case will be found to be equally possible in other cases remains to be seen , and if the answer be in the affirmative , it is unnecessary to point out that the resulting economy in the construction of filters would be very material .
Personally I am extremely optimistic regarding future possibilities in this direction , and only the other day I had an opportunity of practically applying this recent experience with , so far , most gratifying results , in the case of a stronger sewage and one which contains a considerable amount of brewery waste .
In this case the authority had some years ago constructed works which provided for the nitrification of the sewage by means of " contact " beds , and , being lately threatened with proceedings on account of pollution , on the advice of their engineer an experimental plant was constructed , with the view of determining whether better results could be obtained by means of " percolating " filters .
Having worked these filters for about seven months , the engineer came to the conclusion that he might safely recommend the adoption of a scheme on similar lines , but with 5-ft .

] the whole of the sewage of the town .
Before assenting to this proposal , however , the authority decided to seek further advice , and this led to my being consulted .
Shortly , I may state that the experimental filter in this case had a mean depth of 4 feet , and was formed of clinker broken to sizes varying from | to ^ inch , the sewage , after having undergone preliminary treatment , the nature of which need not here be described , being distributed on to the filter by means of a series of fixed sprays .
The results obtained were fairly satisfactory as regards nitrification , but the organic matter remaining unconverted was considerable , and the effluent , so far as appearance went , was a poor one , owing to the amount of suspended matter it contained .
In order to determine whether and to what extent the imperfect results were attributable to the comparatively large-sized medium composing the filter , and with the view of ascertaining whether , in the case of the sewage in question , a shallower filter would answer the purpose , I suggested that a section of the filter should be partially reconstructed by removing the top medium to a depth of 12 inches and replacing it by granite chippings broken to | inch , and also that a collecting tray should be introduced at a depth of 3 feet in the reconstructed section .
This alteration was made , and we thus had the means of comparing the results obtained by the altered section at depths of 3 feet and 4 feet 6 inches with those from the undisturbed section at a depth of 4 feet 6 inches under identical conditions .
Having resumed the working of the filter , at a rate of flow of 200 gallons per square yard per day , three weeks were allowed to elapse for ripening before the first set of samples were collected , and up to the time of writing this paper the experiment , under the altered conditions , had been in operation for four months .
So far I have had an opportunity of analysing two sets of samples from the two sections of the filter , and the following are the means of the more significant results obtained:\#151 ; Parts pei r 100,000 .

[ May 7 , It will be seen that the improvement effected by apparently so trivial an alteration is remarkable .
The improved quality of the effluents from the altered section of the filter at a depth of 3 feet compared with those from the same section and the unaltered section at a depth of 4 feet 6 inches is most striking .
With reference to the work done at different depths in filters , Scott-Monerieff has added very much to our knowledge of the subject by his well-known experiments : on a small scale at Ashtead some eight years ago , and , later , on a larger scale , at Caterham Barracks .
The filters were built up of nine trays , each 7 inches deep , with perforated bottoms , and supported vertically over one another with about 3-inch interspaces .
The depth of the filtering medium in each tray was 6 inches , giving a total effective depth of 4 feet 6 inches .
The medium consisted of coke , broken to pass through a ring 1 inch in diameter , and the rate of delivery was about 200 gallons per square yard ( 1*000,000 gallons per acre ) .
The object Scott-Moncrieff had in view was a two-fold one : first , to secure the freest possible aeration of the filter ; and , secondly , to separate , as far as possible , the various stages of the process by providing facilities for the differentiation of the colonies of nitrifying organisms .
Incidentally the arrangement also allowed of the collecting of samples of effluents for analysis from different depths , for comparative purposes as regards the oxidising changes .
Without going into detail , I may mention that while the nitrification effected by the tray filters was exceptionally high , the changes , notwithstanding the free aeration which the arrangement provided for , did not take place so rapidly , nor at so shallow a depth , as in the case of the Hanley experiments .
The nitrous change was more marked , and was continued to a greater depth , and the reduction in the free ammonia , as well as in the oxygen absorbed , was far more gradual .
It is true that the sewage was a much stronger one , but , making allowance for this , the work done per foot deep of filtering medium was relatively considerably less than in the case of Hanley .
I feel pretty confident that had a much finer filter medium been used by Scott-Moncrieff the high oxidising changes would have been effected at a shallower depth , and practically the whole of the suspended solids would have been liquefied and nitrified within the filter .
Dr. Harriette Chick , in a paper published in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society/ 1906 , B , vol. 77 , gives an account of certain laboratory experiments she conducted in 1901 , and again in 1903 , having reference to the nitrification of sewage .
Three cylindrical filters were employed , each 4f inches in diameter , and approximately 1\#163 ; , 3\#163 ; , and 6^ feet in depth respectively .

] filtering material used was coke of practically the same grade as that used at Hanley , and the sewage was delivered on to the filters at the rate of 300 gallons per 24 hours by means of a syphonic discharge on to a perforated distributing disc at intervals of 38 minutes .
The sewage dealt with was artificially prepared by diluting liquid cow manure with water , the dilution in the first experiment being 1 in 20 and in the second 1 in 50 to 1 in 100 .
The suspended solids were removed by rough filtration through glass wool .
In this case , the filters being new , it was possible to determine the stages in the ripening process , and it was found that while a marked amount of general oxidation was apparent in the effluents from all the filters in two weeks , no trace of oxidised nitrogen appeared until 10 days later , and until then the ammonia in the effluents was the same as in the sewage .
The first trace of oxidised nitrogen in the effluents appeared in the form of nitrous nitrogen on the following dates , all three filters having been started on February 20th:\#151 ; Deep filter on 18th March .
Medium " 21st March .
Shallow " 28th March .
For some time the formation of nitrous nitrogen continued in increasing amount , and later , when nitric nitrogen made its appearance , the nitrous nitrogen gradually diminished until ultimately the effluents from the medium and deep filter showed no trace of it .
For some reason it would appear that the effluents from the shallowest filter ceased to be recorded before this period .
Regarding the absence of nitrous nitrogen in the effluents after the filters had matured , the results accord with those at Hanley .
In one other respect , namely , the reduction of general oxidisable matter , the results also agree with those at Hanley in the fact that practically the reduction was as marked in the shallow as in the deep effluents .
As regards the degree of nitrification at different depths , Dr. Chick 's results do not quite compare with those of Hanley .
It must be remembered , however , that the conditions differed widely .
The volume of sewage dealt with in the former case was relatively greater , and its ammoniacal strength was very much higher .
Also the intervals of delivery on to the filter were much longer , namely , 38 minutes compared with 5 minutes in the case of Hanley , and in addition all the disturbing influences incidental to a laboratory experiment of this character have to be taken into account , such as the effect of peripheral capillarity upon the uniformity of the downward flow in a filter of such small diameter .
At the same time , the nitrification effected at the medium depth was very considerable , and it would have been interesting to have had another record between that and the 6-ft .

F 2 Dr. G. Reid .
[ May 7 , It may now be convenient to sum up the arguments which may be adduced , and the conclusions which may be drawn , from the recent observations at Hanley .
In the first place , two important factors undoubtedly contributed in no small degree to the high quality of the work done : ( 1 ) the small amount of suspended matter in the effluent applied to the filter ; and ( 2 ) the very efficient means of distribution provided .
The oxidation of organic matter already in solution is a comparatively simple process , but to bring about the liquefaction of suspended organic solids takes longer time , hence the importance of providing , as far as possible , for their removal by mechanical subsidence or other methods , and their liquefaction by anaerobic organisms as a preliminary process .
When septic tank treatment was first introduced , its advocates , in their enthusiasm , predicted that the difficult question of sludge disposal would thus be solved , but experience does not quite corroborate this prediction .
In the case in point I attribute the satisfactory reduction of suspended solids in the septic tank effluent to the large capacity of the detritus tanks .
These were divided into three , two of which were always in use , while the third was emptied for cleansing weekly , and so on in rotation , the whole three being brought into use during rain periods .
As regards the distribution of the sewage on the filter , it is obvious that uniformity is all-important , otherwise certain sections might be greatly overtaxed , while other sections were working much below their capacity .
The distribution in this case was so perfect that frequent tests failed to establish any appreciable difference between one square yard of filter and another .
Now , as regards the rapidity of the oxidising changes , and the remarkable purity of the effluent after filtration through 12 inches only .
The three essential factors in the final changes are time , air , and organisms , and , given a sufficiency of air , the greater the number of organisms present the larger the amount of work done , provided the organic matter both in solution and suspension is brought into intimate contact with the organisms .
The factor which governs the bacterial population is the area available for growth , and this may be increased by two methods , either by enlarging the cubic capacity of the filter or by subdividing the filtering medium .
In the case in point , the latter was the expedient adopted , and the subdivision was carried as far as it was thought possible to carry it without preventing the superficial penetration of the suspended solids into the interstices .
In view of the results , it is needless to discuss whether the reduction in the size of particles resulted in an inadequate air supply .
The relative amount of carbonic acid in the air of the filter at different depths also shows the highly active oxidising changes which take place in Nitrification of .
1906 .
] the superficial layers .
A series of samples of air aspirated from different depths , by means of iron tubes driven vertically into the body of the filter while in continuous use , yielded the following mean results : Carbonic Acid in parts per 1000 .
1 ft , 2 ft. 3 ft. 4 ft. 19*5 21*5 20*0 20*0 An interesting fact bearing upon the aeration of the filter was incidentally made apparent by the method at first adopted of collecting the air .
The distributor passing backwards and forwards over the filter was found to interfere considerably with the collection of the samples , and , to obviate this , the apparatus was periodically stopped for varying periods during the operation .
Owing , however , to extraordinary discrepancies in the results thus obtained , measures were taken to overcome this difficulty and enable the air to be collected without interrupting the regular flow of sewage on to the filter .
The results , of which the figures just given are the means , were then found to be remarkably uniform , whereas in the case of the earlier samples the carbonic acid varied in amount according to the intervals which elapsed between the stopping of the distributor and the collection , short though these intervals were , from 2*8 to 26*1 , showing how free was the current of air through the filter .
If , then , by using fine-grade particles the depth of filter may be greatly reduced , the resulting economy would dictate such a course , but there is another important consideration which , other things being equal , tells in favour of shallow filters from the point of view of aeration .
The air travels through a filter from above downwards , the direction of the current probably being mainly due to the percolation downwards of the sewage , and its more rapid flow along the effluent drains .
The air , therefore , as it passes downwards , carries with it the products of the combustion which has taken place above , and thus has an asphyxiating effect upon the organisms below , and it is possible that even anaerobic fermentation may be revived in the bottom layers .
The sudden increase in the free ammonia figure , noted in the case of the effluent from the lowest tray , may possibly be accounted for in this way , because the albuminoid ammonia figure does not represent the total organic nitrogen present , therefore there is an unrecorded margin of nitrogenous organic matter available for the revival of the ammonia change should this explanation of the phenomenon be the correct one .
Be this as it may , however , the phenomenon does not appear to be accounted for by fouling of the deeper strata .
At the end of the observations the filter was opened and carefully examined throughout its Dr. G. Reid .
[ May 7 , depth , when it was found that the dark discoloration from deposit was confined to the surface , as was evident from the untarnished appearance of the light-coloured filtering medium below the top 14 to 18 inches .
Also , the relative amount of organic solids in the interstices at different depths , ascertained by drying and igniting 10 grammes of the filter particles in each case , supports this contention , as the following figures show:\#151 ; Percentage Loss on Ignition of Filter Particles at Different Depths .
6 in .
1 ft. 2 ft. 3 ft. 4 ft. 3-25 0-99 0'65 0'53 053 I may mention that on ignition there was practically no smell , except in the case of the samples collected at the 6-inch and 1-foot depths , and that in the case of these only an odour such as that of burning soil could be detected .
Apart from all theory , however , the fact has been established beyond all doubt that , in the case of the sewage in question at any rate , the lower or 3 feet of filter medium is absolutely unnecessary , and , so far as the cost of construction of the filter is concerned , the expenditure might be reduced by about one-half .
Again from the point of view of cost , another important consideration comes in .
It frequently happens that the absence of 2 or 3 feet of available fall is the determining factor between a gravitation and pumping scheme , and in this respect the reduced depth of filter might lead to further economy , not only in capital outlay , but in maintenance charges .
Now , the question may be asked whether this experience acquired at Hanley may be applied in other cases where the sewage may be of a stronger character ?
I am not at present in a position to give a positive answer to that question , but if , as is probable , such should prove not to be the case , the observations I have recorded clearly point to the conclusion that the extra filtering capacity should be provided for by increasing the area rather than the depth of the beds .
The three factors in the nitrifying process being a given time , a given volume of air , and a given bacterial population , all these would be supplemented by extending the area in accordance with the combustion which has to be effected , and thereby diminishing the delivery per square yard of filter .
Of course , I do not suggest that the depth of filters may be reduced to 1 foot , because we must allow for the effluent drains , and the few inches of large material immediately on the top of them , but I do suggest the practicability , if a fine medium is used , of reducing the total depth to , say , 2 feet 6 inches .
The tables appended give the details of the analyses and other determinations made during the investigations which have been described .
