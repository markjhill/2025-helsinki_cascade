113 ( 7 ) Summary of Results ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 115 A. Introductory .
In 1903 I commenced a series of breeding experiments with rats .
They were undertaken with the object of ascertaining whether Mendel 's Principles would adequately interpret the observed facts .
During the interval of four years which has since elapsed , many records of results have been made .
But a consideration of these initial results shows that the problems involved are of some complexity , and many years of continuous work will be needed before the hypothetical assumptions , which tentatively have had to be adopted , can be regarded as proved .
Notwithstanding this , it can be shown by the whole of the results so far reached\#151 ; only part of which are here recorded\#151 ; that the phenomena may be explained on the basis of segregation , gametic purity , and of dominance , if we tentatively accept certain postulates which are enumerated below { infra , p. 99 ) .
I purpose describing my results in a series of separate papers , of which this is the first .
At the time that my experiments were undertaken , the only papers which had been published on the hereditary transmission of coat colours in rats Mr. G. P. Murlge .
On the Hereditary [ May 8 , were those of Crampe ( 13 and 14 ) , published in 1877 , 1883 , 1884 , and 1885 .
All his papers were therefore published antecedent to the re-discovery of Mendel 's Principles , by De Tries , in 1900 , and the results were not stated in a form which render it possible to determine certainly whether they are in accordance with Mendelian expectations or not .
Crampe 's experiments were analysed by Bateson in 1903(5 ) , and he showed that a few Mendelian conclusions could be deduced from them .
But at about the same time that I commenced my experiments , Doncaster had also instituted a similar series with the same kind of animals , and in 1905 he published his results ( 15 ) .
He also discussed Crampe 's experiments , and as the outcome of his own work he reached the following conclusions:\#151 ; ( 1 ) That albinoes may carry the determiners for grey and for black , or for both .
That some may carry the piebald determiners , and others the self pattern determiners .
( 2 ) That Crampe 's " Irish " form consisted of two sub-forms , which Doncaster designated " a " and " b. " ( 3 ) That the " Irish " " a " and the wholly black form Cr 7 , contained no piebald .
( 4 ) That , tentatively , the Cr 7 ( wholly black ) form may be regarded as an extreme form of the Cr 6 a , and is not a separate variety .
( 5 ) That with regard to pattern there are only two allelomorphs in rats , i.e. , " self " and " piebald , " and that when they are crossed together , dominance is not complete .
( 6 ) That the " Irish " b form is a heterozygote produced by crossing black ( Cr 7 ) or " Irish " a with black and white .
( 7 ) That the proportions of types which appear in successive litters may be diverse .
With regard to these conclusions , my work confirms them all , with the exception of Ho. 4 , and it adds further evidence in support of most of them .
In addition , some new results are reached .
With respect to these latter and to the extended evidence , see " Summary of Results , " p. 115 .
I have to express my thanks to Mrs. Gunn ( Miss Gertrude Smith ) , who for three years daily superintended the feeding of the rats .
To her conscientious care must be ascribed much of the success of the breeding .
My thanks are also due to Mrs. F. Judkins , of Sark , who personally took considerable trouble to obtain for me three pairs of the old English black rat .
( Mas rattus).Unfortunately , this species apparently will not breed with the grey rat ( Mas clecumanus ) , nor with any of the tame types .
I have kept M. rattus mated with all the varieties for considerable periods , but without result .
To Mr. Reginald I. Pocock , I am also indebted for two specimens of the black variety of the wild grey rat , which were trapped in the Zoological Gardens , and for five young specimens of M. rattus , which were born there , from a pair presented by Mrs. Judkins .

The cost of these experiments has been defrayed by a grant from the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society .
B. The System of Interpretation \#169 ; f Results .
It is possible to adopt at least three ways of representing the allelomorphic pairs , but so far as the results which I have obtained with rats are concerned , the predictions are identical in each case .
One of these " schemes " differs fundamentally from the other two in that it regards greyness as not being allelomorphic to blackness , while the other two do .
There are reasons for believing that greyness and blackness may not be allelomorphic .
And since this " scheme , " which embodies Bateson and Punnett 's " Presence and Absence " theory , has successfully interpreted other results of a diverse nature , it will be adopted in this paper .
The essential feature in their " scheme " is that the allelomorphic pairs consist of a determinant ( factor ) for the presence , and of one for the absence of the character under consideration .
On the basis of gametic purity , therefore , any one gamete cannot carry both the positive and negative factor of the same character .
But it can carry the positive factor for each of two characters , such as blackness and grey ness .
This " scheme " predicts accurately the types of rat which result in any cross , in so far that types not predicted never appear .
In some cases , however , predicted types have not appeared , but the evidence is clear that this is due only to want of numbers , and that with more litters the .
missing types will duly appear .
Indeed , in several instances , when I first tabulated my results , a certain type which was predicted was absent , but in most of the cases it has since appeared in a later litter .
With regard to the expected proportions , the prediction is usually approximately , and in some cases exactly , fulfilled .
In interpreting my results by means of Bateson and Punnett 's " Presence and Absence " hypothesis , I have conjoined to their conception , that of Cuenot , in which he postulates the idea that colour is due to the interaction of two bodies , one a ferment and the other a chromogen .
This idea has received confirmation from Miss Durham !
s work .
Below I append the various symbols employed:\#151 ; C = colour producer.* c = absence of colour producer .
G = grey determiner.f g = grey determiner .
B = blackf b= " black " S = self-pattern determiner .
s = \#187 ; \gt ; self-pattern determiner .
P = piebald-pattern determiner .
p = piebald-pattern determiner .
* In this paper the colour producer is regarded as a ferment .
t In this paper the grey and black determiners are regarded as chromogenous bodies which develope colour when acted upon by the ferment C. 100 Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On Hereditary [ May 8 , The different types of rats will therefore be symbolically represented as follows :\#151 ; Wild self-grey rat ... .
CGBSP .
Piebald " ... .
CG-BsP .
Wild self-black rat ... CgBSP .
Piebald " ... CgBsP .
Albino rat ... ... ... ... cGBSP , cGBsP , cgBSp , cGbSp , cGbSP , cgBSP , cGbsP , CgBsP , cGBSp .
By various combinations of these forms the number of possible albinoes can be increased .
Thus , if cgBSP x cGBSp , a form cGgBSPp will result .
It is very doubtful whether an albino not carrying at least one positive colour and one positive pattern member of each allelomorphic pair , exists .
In accordance with the indications given by Miss Durham 's work ( 17 ) , I shall assume that the albino carries the chromogen determiners ( G and B ) and not the ferment = tyrosinase = colour producer ( C ) .
In applying this " scheme " to my results , it will be necessary to assume that every gamete must carry one member of each allelomorphic pair .
C. The " Irish " Character = Crampe 's Cr 6.* The form known in the " fancy " as the " Irish " rat is a nearly wholly black individual with patches of white on the ventral surface .
With regard to its visible zygotic characters there are apparently two types which Doncaster ( 15 ) has proposed to call the " Irish " a and the " Irish " With this subdivision of the " Irish " type ( Cr 6 ) I am inclined to agree , and certainly for purposes of description it is a very necessary one .
Doncaster 's definition of the zygotic characters of the " b " form is , however , unsatisfactory , because it is not sufficiently precise .
According to him this form has more white on the ventral surface than the " a " form .
My experience suggests that this is not the chief difference , and that wo should define the " Irish " b as being the form with more or less ventral white and with carpal and metatarsal white bands .
The " Irish " a possesses the ventral white alone and always very little of it , but has no carpal or metatarsal bands ; the ventral white is usually merely a fleck on the chest or abdomen .
Some of my " Irish " b forms in respect of the excessive reduction of the ventral white approach the a form , but are at once distinguished by the presence of the white carpal and metatarsal bands .
* The symbols Or 1\#151 ; Cr 7 , which are used in this paper , indicate the seven varieties into which Crampe divided rats .
These varieties are described on p. 119 , and also by Bateson ( 5 ) , and by Doncaster ( 15 ) .
1907 .
] Transmission of certain Coat Characters in Rats .
As a rule , the ventral white in the " Irish " form assumes the character of a longitudinal band extending from the chest at the level of the arms back to the umbilicus or farther .
In general form , this band is narrow-triangular with its base in the pectoral region .
In most cases , the two angles of the base extend off along the ventral surface of the arms and reach the carpal bands .
In some instances , however , this extension is absent , and in others broken .
The longitudinal band itself is often broken , or expanded in some parts , usually in the abdominal region , and constricted in others , usually just anterior to the umbilical region .
In the pattern thus produced there is often symmetry , but usually more or less departure from a strict symmetrical figure exists .
In the " Irish " a form , the ventral white in most cases assumes the shape of a very small triangular patch in the pectoral region , with its apex directed posteriorly .
It suggests a reduced pattern of the " Irish " b form .
Sometimes an additional spot of white is present on the abdomen .
Origin of the " Irish " b. The " Irish " bis a heterozygote and in my experiments has been produced in the following 10 different kinds of crosses:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Black var .
of wild grey ( Cr 7 ) x Cr 4.* ( 2 ) Extracted black ( Cr 7 ) x Cr 4 .
i ( 3 ) Cr 2 x Cr 2.f ( 4 ) Cr 2 x Cr 4 .
( 5 ) Cr 2 x Cr 5 ( carrying albinism recessive ) .
( 6 ) Cr 5 x Cr 4 .
( 7 ) " Irish " bx " Irish " b ( Cr 6 b ) .
( 8 ) " Irish " bx Cr 5 ( homozygote ) .
( 9 ) " Irish " bx Cr 5 ( carrying albinism recessive ) .
( 10 ) " Irish " \amp ; xCr 4 .
Of these , Doncaster has previously obtained " Irish " b from Nos. 6 and 10 , and also probably from crosses Nos. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 .
In these latter crosses Doncaster had not , at the time they were made , distinguished between " Irish " b and a. But in the light of my experiments there can be no doubt his " Irish " forms from these crosses were of the sub-type b. The origin of " Irish " b forms from crosses Nos. 1 , 8 , and 9 , are , therefore , new .
In addition to these , Doncaster also obtained this form from crosses of Cr 6 x Cr 6 \amp ; , Cr 7 x Cr 5 , and Cr 7 x Cr 6 b.It is almost certain from his records , that * See footnote , p. 100 .
+ The Cr 2 forms are similar in their visible zygotic characters to the " Irish " , but are grey in colour .
Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On [ May 8 , the Cr 7 in the two latter experiments ( 53 and 34 ) was not homozygote and was , perhaps , an " Irish " a ( see Summary of Results , No. 5 , p. 115 ) .
The Cr 2* types used in my experiments , and also the " Irish " were of two different origins , one form in each type resulting from a cross of a self-grey or a self-black respectively with a Cr 4 , and in the other with a corresponding cross with a Cr 5 .
The possibility that the Cr 4 in the two former cases carried the piebald pattern determiner must not be overlooked .
The homozygote nature of the Cr 5 in the eighth line of the column of matings above was tested by crossing it with a Cr 5 known to be carrying albinism recessive .
No albinoes appeared in its offspring .
D. Experimental Results .
( 1 ) " Irish " bx " Irish " 6 x 6 ( a ) Albino Parentage.\#151 ; Seven matings of this kind have been made .
Of the seven pairs of " Irish " b individuals used , two pairs ( experiments 49 , 50 ) were derived from a cross of a black var .
: wild grey x albino , three ( 51 , 52 , 53 ) from a cross of an extracted black ( Cr 7 ) x Cr 4 , and two ( experiments 54 , 55 ) from a cross of " Irish " bx Cr 5 carrying albinism recessive .
The black variety of the wild grey rat may be regarded as a pure black and as equivalent to an extracted Cr 7 .
There is no possibility of its carrying the grey chromogen determiner , since grey is dominant to black .
We may , therefore , consider experiments 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , and 53 together and regard them all as crosses of a Cr 7 x Cr 4 .
The parental albinoes of these " Irish " b individuals were bred by me from albino grandparents , which were in turn obtained from ordinary dealers .
Rats obtained from this source are nearly sure to be of piebald origin , though one of mine thus obtained for another experiment carried the self character , and another the grey chromogen .
We may , therefore , assume that these albinoes were carrying the piebald pattern and black chromogen determiners .
On this assumption we may represent the " Irish " b individuals used by the symbol CcgBSsP .
It will , perhaps , be as well in this particular cross to show how the predictions which are deduced are arrived at , and I will therefore give a table of the possible gametic combinations .
Each " Irish " b individual of the zygotic composition CcgBSsP will , at the segregation of the characters , form gametes which will carry the combination of characters shown in the following symbols : CgBSP , CgBsP , cgBSP , cgBsP .
There are thus 16 possible combinations between the four kinds of gametes .
The combinations are shown in the subjoined Table I. * See footnote , p. 100 .

3 Turning now to the actual results of experiments 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , and 53 , there is produced a total offspring of:\#151 ; 9 Cr 4+4 Cr 5 + 3 Cr 6 10 Cr 6 6 + 4 Cr 7 .

Thus the experimental result departs from prediction in the expected proportions only .
Dividing the actual result throughout by two , we have 4*5 + 2 +1*5 + 5 + 2 .
This is a very close approximation to the prediction .
The actual result is only one Cr 5 and Cr 6 6 too few , and one Cr 7 too many .
It is instructive to plot out the prediction and the actual result in the form of two curves ( fig. 1 ) .
It can be seen at once how close is the resemblance between the two .
It is obvious that the general slope and form is the same , and that the difference is not greater than that between a theoretical normal curve of error , and one of that form obtained from an actual series of measurements .
It is to be noted that all the types which are predicted have appeared , and that none which are not expected have arisen .
VOL. lxxx.\#151 ; B. i Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On Hereditary [ May 8 , We may , therefore , conclude that the " Irish " 5 form in these experiments may have the gametic composition which I have assumed for it , CcgBSsP .

The abscissae represent the different types of rats , and the ordinates the proportions in which they occur .
( b ) Piebald Parentage.\#151 ; In experiments 54 and 55 the " Irish " b parents used were derived from a cross of Cr 6 bx Cr 5 ( carrying albinism recessive ) .
The Cr 6 bgrandparent was in both experiments derived from a cross of black variety of wild grey x Cr 4 ( see experiments 47 , 57 , and 59 ) .
From such a cross of Cr 6 bx Cr 5 , there are expected among the offspring , in addition to the Cr 4 and Cr 5 types , two forms of " Irish " b , i.e. , CgBSsP and CcgBSsP .
If we suppose that in both of the experiments ( 54 and 55 ) one of the " Irish " b parents was a CgBSsP and the other a CcgBSsP , then the predicted results will differ from that where both are CcgBSsP in the absence of albinoes .
The expectation is : \#151 ; 2 Cr 5+1 Cr 6 a + 4 Cr 6 5 + 1 Cr 7 .
The actual result of the two experiments combined is:\#151 ; 3 Cr 5 + 8 Cr 6 5 + 1 Cr 7 .
The special feature of the prediction , i.e. , absence of albinoes , is thus far confirmed .
Considering the smallness of the number , the approximation to prediction , with regard to proportion of the different types , is sufficiently close to be significant .
The proportion of Cr 5 is exact , that of the Cr 7 is as near as it can be with the number of individuals present , while that of the Cr 6 5 is two too many .
The predicted Cr 6 a is absent .
In connection with the missing type , the remark made on pp. 99 and 106 should be borne in mind .
Expected types do not always appear in the first litter , and some not until the third litter , even though the early litters may be of large numbers ( eight or more ) .
1907 .
] Transmission of certain Coat Characters in Rats .
We may , therefore , regard these two experiments as affording initial evidence that this particular type of " Irish " i.e. , CgBSsP as contrasted to CcgBSsP has been actually produced .
( 2 ) " Irish " bx Piebald Black- White = Cr 6b x 5 .
Five matings of this nature have been made ( experiments 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , and 59a ) .
In experiment 56 the Cr 5 parent was known by two previous testings to be homozygote .
In experiments 57 and 59 the Cr 5 parent was known from previous testings to be carrying albinism recessive .
In experiment 58 the Cr 5 parent was not tested , but since both its parents carried albinism recessive , the chances are equal that it also carried albinism .
In experiment 59a the chances are also equal that the Cr 5 parent is either homozygous or carries albinism recessive .
The " Irish " b partners were in four experiments ( 56\#151 ; 59 ) members of the same parents , and were derived from a cross between a black variety of wild grey x Cr 4 ( experiment 47 ) .
The albino parent was derived from albino grandparents purchased from ordinary dealers , and it was therefore , in all probability , carrying both black chromogen and piebald pattern determiners .
The " Irish " b partners in these four experiments may be , therefore , represented by the symbol CcgBSsP .
The piebald parents in experiments 57 , 58 , and 59 will be represented by the symbol CcgBsP .
The predicted offspring in such a cross will be :\#151 ; 2 Cr 4 + 3 Cr 5 + 3 Cr 6 b. y-------Y-------j 2 alb .

In these two experiments ( 57 and 59 ) where the actual gametic factors-are known with some degree of certainty , the prediction of proportions of Cr 4 to the pigmented types and the actual result are practically identical .
The proportion , however , of Cr 6 bis a little too large .
In the case of experiment 57 there were five litters , and since the details-are significant , I append them:\#151 ; * At birth the pigmented individuals can be immediately distinguished from the-albinoes by the pigmented eyes , which show through the skin .
These two young ones died before their coat colour and pattern had developed .
At birth the skin of all rats is colourless and hairless .

12 8 15 2 It is to be noted in the first litter , notwithstanding that it is large , that the predicted Cr 5 type is not present .
That in the first , second , and third litters the proportion of albinoes to pigmented individuals is as near as it possibly can be to expectation , with the odd numbers involved .
That in the third and fourth litters the albinoes are in excess .
These considerations show us , what is also shown in others of my experiments , that predicted types will not necessarily appear in any one litter , and that large numbers must be reared before expected proportions in all cases will be quite accurately realised by actual results .
Considering next , experiment 56 , where the Cr 5 parent is known to be homozygote , the prediction is :\#151 ; 2 Cr 5 + 2 Cr 6 b. The actual result is :\#151 ; 4 Cr 5 : 3 Cr 6 5 .
With the odd numbers concerned this is the nearest approach possible to prediction .
The chief feature to notice is that while the predicted types have appeared , unpredicted ones have not .
Experiments 58 and 59a may now be considered .
The absence of albinoes in their offspring suggests that the Cr 5 parent was homozygous .
The total offspring in these two experiments is 4 Cr 5 + 8 Cr 6 5 .
Added to experiment 56 , it gives a total of 8 :11 respectively .
There is thus , roundly , only one Cr 5 too few , and one Cr 6 5 too many .
( 3 ) " Irish " 5 x Albino = 6 5 x 4 .
Seven crosses of this nature have been made , i.e. , experiments 60 to 66 .
All the " Irish " 5 parents used were descended from two individuals of the black variety wild grey rat ( experiments 47 and 48 ) .
Five of the seven were from mating 47 , and the remaining two from mating 48 .
Three of the albinoes used ( experiments 60 , 62 , and 63 ) were also derived from the same albino parents , which were obtained from ordinary dealers .
In experiment 61 the albino parent was also obtained from the same source , but from a different parentage .
Their zygotic composition may therefore be represented by cgBsP .
In experiments 64 , 65 , and 66 the albinoes used were 1907 .

107 extracted ones .
In 64 it was extracted from a mating of two " Irish " parents ( experiment 50 ) .
In experiments 65 and 66 the two albinoes used were brothers , and were extracted from a cross between a Or 2 x Cr 5 ( experiment 38 ) .
I will therefore deal with experiments 60 , 61 , 62 , and 63 together , since all the four albino parents are probably of the same gametic constitution .
The expectation is :\#151 ; 2Cr4 + lCr5-f-lCr66 = 1 alb .
: 1 pigmented .
The actual result of the four combined experiments is :\#151 ; 14 Cr 4 + 7 Cr 5 + 3 Cr 6 b + 6 pigmented eyes.* 14 alb .
: 16 pigmented .
= 1 : IT .
Result and prediction are thus almost identical with regard to the proportion of albinoes and pigmented individuals ; they are so with regard to the nature of the types predicted , and doubtless had the six individuals with pigmented eyes lived , there would have been a near approach to expectation of the Cr 6 btype .
Experiments 65 and 66 .
As already stated , the albino parents in this cross were derived from a Cr 2 x Cr 5 ( experiment 38 ) .
The Cr 2 was derived from wild grey x Cr 4 ( of ordinary dealers ) ( experiment 20).f The Cr 5 was derived from Cr 6 6xCr 4 ( of ordinary dealers ) ( experiment 62 ) .
The Cr 6 from black variety grey x Cr 4 ( of ordinary dealers ) ( experiment 48 ) .
( See Descendants ' Table , Charts II and III .
) From an ancestry of this nature the albino parent used in experiments 65 and 66 may have one of four zygotic compositions , i.e. , cgBsP , cgBSsP , cGgBsP , cGgBSsP .
The " Irish " b parents will be CcgBSsP .
If the albinoes are of the nature indicated by the last two symbols , and are carrying the grey determiner , then Cr 2 individuals are expected in the offspring .
They are absent .
Albinoes and the .
Cr 5 type are also expected in any case , but the Cr 4 is absent in experiment 65 and the Cr 5 in experiment 66 .
The numbers , however , are small , and it has been shown that expected types do not always appear in the first litter .
The results of these two experiments do not coincide in their proportions with prediction , and they are being repeated on a larger scale .
* These died before coat colour had developed , t This experiment will be described in a later paper .
Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On Hereditary [ May 8 , Experiment 64 .
In this experiment the albino was extracted from a cross of Cr 6 x Cr 6 ( experiment 50 ) .
Reference to the table of gametic combinations on p. 103 will show that an albino thus extracted may be either cgBsP , cgBSP , or cgBSsP .
If it be cgBSP , then a Cr 6 a is expected in its offspring when crossed with a Cr 6 b ; if it be cgBSsP , then a Cr 5 is additionally expected .
Assuming it to be cgBSsP , the full expectation is 4 Cr 4+1 Cr 5 + 1 Cr 6 a+2 Cr 6 The actual result of this mating in two litters is 3 Cr 5 + 2 Cr 6 + 8 Cr 6 The expected albinoes are therefore missing , and there is a preponderance of the Cr 6 btype .
But since the Cr 5 and Cr 6 a types were both absent in the first litter , it is possible that the expected Cr 4 types would have appeared had the parents lived to produce a third litter .
The appearance , however , of the Cr 6 a type among the offspring can only occur if the parental albino is carrying the self-pattern determiner , and the presence of the Cr 5 type can only occur if it carries an allelomorph , s , which , being recessive to it , will therefore allow P to be manifested .
The presence of Cr 6 a together with that of the Cr 5 type , must therefore be regarded as initial evidence that this type of albino has been actually produced .
And , since it is predicted ( see table of gametic combinations , p. 103 ) that some of the albinoes produced in a cross of Cr 6 xCr 6 will be of the two types cgBSP and cgBSsP , it thus far constitutes a fulfilment of the prediction of the existence of this latter type in contrast to the former .
( 4 ) " Irish ' ' b x Grey with White = 6 2 .
One cross only ( experiment 66a ) of this nature has been made , but the result is of exceptional interest , and affords a cogent test of the doctrine of gametic purity and of dominance .
To understand the case , it is necessary to consider the origin of the Cr 2 member of the pair .
Its parents were a black variety of the wild grey rat ( experiment 48 ) x with an albino purchased of ordinary dealers .
In this mating there were seven young , six being of the expected " Irish " b type and -one exceptional one , i.e. , a Cr 2 .
In my other crosses of this nature there were 13 young , all of the " Irish " b type .
To explain the production of this Cr 2 , it is necessary to assume that the albino rat which was mated to the black variety of grey was carrying the grey determiner.* For reasons which will appear later , I will further * The same result would be obtained by supposing that the black variety of wild grey was carrying the grey chromogen .
But since grey is dominant to black this cannot the case .
1907.1 Transmission of certain Coat Characters in Rats .
assume that the albino also carried the black and piebald pattern determiners .
Its composition will then be represented by cG-gBsP .
Such an albino , mated with a homozygote black , will produce , according to the subjoined Table II , equal numbers of " Irish " 6 and Cr 2 .

If albino = cGgBsP = 1 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 6 b. " = cGgBSsP = 2 Cr 2 +1 Cr 6 b +1 Or 6 a. If the assumption that the albino parent is carrying the grey determiner be correct , then the exceptional Cr 2 member among the offspring , in experiment 48 , may be assumed to be of the zygotic composition CcGgBSsP .
If we ascertain the possible gametic combinations when such a Cr 2 individual is crossed with an " Irish " b of CcgBSsP composition , it will be such that the F 1 offspring predicted will be as follows 8 Cr 4+1 Cr 1 + 8 Cr 2 + 3 Cr 3 + 3 Cr 5 + 2 Cr 6 a + 6 Cr 6 6 + 1 Cr 7 = 1 Cr 4 : 3 pigmented .
Now , the special feature in this progeny is the presence of the black forms , especially the homozygote Cr 7 .
Grey being dominant to black , black individuals could not appear in the F 1 generation of a cross between grey ( Cr 2 ) and black ( " Irish " 6 ) , unless the grey member carried black recessive .
Therefore , if black members of any coat pattern actually appeared in the F 1 generation of this cross of " Irish " 6 x Cr 2 , it must be accepted as evidence that the Cr 2 carried black recessive .
And , since on no other hypothesis , as far as I can see , could these black members appear\#151 ; bearing in mind the unquestioned dominance of grey\#151 ; unless gametic purity or segregation of unit characters really occurs , it must also be accepted as a cogent proof of the truth of this doctrine .
Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On Hereditary [ May 8 , The actual offspring ( experiment 66a ) consisted of:\#151 ; 1 Cr 4 + 1 Cr 1 + 2 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 5+1 Cr 7 .
Thus , two types of black individuals have appeared , Cr 5 and Cr 7 .
The predicted " Irish " form , together with the grey Cr 3 type , is absent .
But if we bear in mind that , at the lowest limit , eight individuals at least must be produced in order to represent all types expected , and that actually only a total of six individuals were produced , it is obvious that two types at least must be absent .
Unfortunately , though I kept these two rats mated for a year and a-half after this first litter , they never gave rise to a second one , and are now dead .
If the hypothesis above made be correct , then the Cr 7 member of the offspring should be homozygote .
It was tested by mating with three albinoes ( experiments 43 , 44 , 45 ) in succession , the last of which carried the grey determiner .
With the first two albinoes , it had a single litter in each case , of eight individuals , making a total of 16 , all of the " Irish " type .
No albinoes appeared .
The " Irish " b individuals of this offspring were crossed inter se ( experiments 51 , 52 , 53 ) , and gave a progeny wholly confirmative of the homozygote nature of the Cr 7 .
When crossed ( experiment 45 ) with the third albino ( carrying the grey determiner ) , it gave a wholly pigmented offspring , five in number { infra , p. 114 ) .
Thus , in a total offspring of 21 , from three albinoes mated with it , not a single albino appeared .
There can , then , be no doubt as to the homozygote nature of the Cr 7 .
Testing the assumption further by following some other of the offspring of the F 1 generation of this " Irish " h x Cr 2 , to the F 3 generation , we may consider the behaviour of two of the F 2 Cr 2 , which I mated with albinoes ( Pedigree Chart I , experiments 73 and 74 ) .
If the assumption be correct that the Cr 2 parent ( experiment 66a ) carried B and P recessive , then the Cr 2 members of its offspring should be of several zygotic compositions , i.e. , CcGgBSP , CGgBSsP , and CcGgBSsP .
If the F 2 Cr 2 of CGgBSsP composition be mated with an albino of reputed cgBsP composition , two particular features are expected in the F 3 generation .
There should be no albinoes , and black forms should appear .
The expected offspring is:\#151 ; 1 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 3 + 1 Cr 5 + 1 Cr 6 b. In experiment 73 , an F 2 Cr 2 was mated with an albino derived from albino grandparents obtained from an ordinary dealer , and presumably , therefore , of cgBsP composition .
The actual result is:\#151 ; 2 Cr 2 + 4 Cr 3 + 5 Cr 5 .
Ill 1907 .
] Transmission of certain Coat Characters in Rats .
The two special features predicted are therefore present , i.e. , absence of albinoes and presence of black forms .
We may therefore regard this experiment as being initial evidence that a Or 2 of the predicted composition CGgBSsP was produced .
Of course , the experiment must be repeated , and larger numbers reared before it can be accepted as proved .
But it is also predicted that an F 2 Cr 2 of composition CcGgBSsP will be formed .
The offspring of such a member when it is crossed with an albino of cgBsP composition will differ from the one just considered only in the presence of albinoes .
In experiment 74 , the second E 2 Cr 2 was crossed with an albino which had been extracted from a Cr 2 , and may therefore have been carrying the grey determiner , as well as the black one .
If the albino carried the black determiner only , the expected offspring is\#151 ; 4 Cr 4+1 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 3 + 1 Cr 5 + 1 Cr 6 If it carried the grey determiner additionally , it will be\#151 ; 8 Cr 4 + 3 Cr 2 + 3 Cr 3 + 1 Cr 5 + 1 Cr 6 b. The actual result is :\#151 ; 15 Cr 4+1 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 3 + 4 pigmented eyes.* In the presence of albinoes , it satisfies one of the two special features of the prediction , though the absence of the black forms is disappointing* It is probable that the four individuals with pigmented eyes , which died quite early , included some black types .
The presence of the albinoes is evidence that the Cr 2 contained albinism recessive .
And such a type was predicted .
Thus on the basis of the hypothesis of the nature of the Cr 2 of the E 1 generation ( experiment 48 ) , it is predicted that the Cr 7 type of the F 2 generation ( experiment 66a ) shall be homozygous .
And prediction in this ease has been completely proved to be fulfilled .
It is also predicted that among ; the Cr 2 members of the F 2 generation ( experiment 66a ) , three types shall be produced ( supra , p. 110 ) , and of these , two have been shown to very probably exist , by the nature of the F 3 generation ( experiments 73 and 74 ) .
( 5 ) Zygotic " pattern " Albinoes .
There remains one feature of importance to mention .
It is one almost new to science , and , as far as I know , has been observed only by Haacke ( 19 ) , and then only in the case of a single individual .
In experiment 74 , just considered , where a particular Cr 2 was x Cr 4 , .
there occurs in the F 3 offspring 15 albinoes .
Of these , six were born in the second litter .
Now , it is predicted that albinoes of such parents may include six zygotic types , i.e. , cgBsP , cgBSsP , cGBsP , cGgBsP , cGBSsP , and cGgBSsP* * These died before the coat colour or pattern had developed .
Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On Hereditary [ May 8 , With regard to the positive pattern determinants which they carry , we may regard them as of two types , i.e. , those carrying only P , and those carrying both P and S. It should he noted that in pigmented individuals S is known to he dominant to P. Hitherto , we have had to rely upon breeding tests in order to ascertain what pattern determinants are carried by albinoes .
But of the six albinoes in the second litter of this cross , one died early , while three of the remaining five had quite distinctly the pattern of the piebald rat .
One had also the pattern of a Cr 2 or Or 6 b ( these two patterns are the same , only the colour differs ) , and the remaining one had that of a self-coloured individual .
I do not purpose going into details here as I shall publish a full account in another paper .
It will be sufficient to say that the pattern is rendered visible by some difference in the texture and closeness of arrangement of the hairs , so that where in pigmented individuals there is colour , in albinoes there is pinkness , due to the fact that the underlying skin shows through ; and where in pigmented individuals there is absence of pigment , in albinoes there is an opaque whiteness , the skin not showing at all .
Thus , in the " self-pattern " albino mentioned above , the whole surface of the body exhibited a pinkness .
The visibility of the " pattern " early disappears , for I first noticed it in \#166 ; early August when the young were a month old , and it had disappeared in early October .
In more recent cases I have noticed that it disappears when the individuals are about two to two and a-half months old .
It is thus in the highest degree probable that some of the piebald marked albinoes were of the cgBsP , cGBsP , or of the cGgBsP type , that the Cr 2 or Cr 6 b pattern was of the cgBSsP or cGgBSsP type , while the self-pattern one may have been of the cGBSsP type.* If this conclusion is valid , then the prediction which forecasts that a homozygote black shall be formed , that certain Cr 2 types shall also be formed , and which also predicts that certain pattern bearing albinoes will be produced , has in all these cases been fulfilled .
Haacke 's single case ( 18 ) was evidently a piebald-bearing albino .
The -other types are here described for the first time .
Lock has described a somewhat analogous ease for the " maple " markings in peas ( 21 ) .
( 6 ) Self-black x Albino 7 x Cr A. ( a ) Black Variety of Wild Grey x Cr 4.\#151 ; Two crosses of this kind were made ( experiments 47 and 48 ) .
* While this paper was passing through the press , this conclusion has been tested by mating a " self-pattern " albino with a Cr 5 .
There were six young , all Cr 6 b. Since self is dominant to piebald , the Cr 5 could not have carried the self-pattern determiner .
This result is therefore conclusive proof that the albino did so .
1907 .
] Transmission of certain Coat Characters Rats .
113 In both matings , the albino parent was obtained from an ordinary dealer ; that in experiment 47 from one dealer , and that in experiment 48 from another .
It is important to note this fact .
In experiment 47 there were 13 young in one litter , all of the " Irish " 5 type .
In experiment 48 , there were seven young , all at first of the " Irish " b type , but one of these changed colour and became a Cr 2 in a few weeks after birth .
This change of colour has several times occurred in my experiments .and will form the subject of a separate paper .
The further history of this Cr 2 member has been already considered , p. 108 and experiment 66a .
From the " Irish " b individuals , the extracted self-black types to be considered in the next cross were derived , as well as directly or indirectly , all the individuals of the " Irish " b crosses described in this paper .
The details .of the behaviour of these two types will , therefore , be found under their appropriate headings .
( b ) Extracted Self-black x Albino.\#151 ; Four matings of this kind were made { experiments 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 ) .
Although there were four matings , only two black individuals were used , since the same individual ( ( 1 ) 52/ 53 ) was crossed with three different albinoes .
In experiments 43 and 44 , this self-black individual was crossed with an albino which was derived from albino parents obtained from ordinary dealers .
The zygotic composition of the albino may be , therefore , represented as cgBsP .
In each of these two matings there were .eight young all " Irish " b. Six of these from the second mating ( experiment 44 ) were crossed se { experiments 51 , 52 , and 53 ) .
There is expected ( supra , p. 103 ) , on the .assumption that their self-black parent is homozygote , albinoes and pigmented individuals in the proportion of 1 : 3 respectively .
Actually it is as near as it can possibly be , i.e. , 4:11 .
The detailed expectation ( Table I , p. 103 ) , is:\#151 ; 4 Cr 4 + 3 Cr 5 + 2 Cr 6 a+6 Cr 6 5 + 1 Cr 7 .
There are produced:\#151 ; 4 Cr 4 + 3 Cr 5 + 0 Cr 6 a + 6 Cr 6 5 + 2 Cr 7 .
There is thus one Cr 7 too many and the expected " Irish " a is missing .
But since some " Irish " a individuals have only a few white hairs on the .chest , it is possible that they may be mistaken for Cr 7 until they are gametically tested .
The result , therefore , may be regarded as confirming prediction in a very exact manner .
Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On Hereditary [ May 8 , * These " Irish " members , combined with the similar offspring of other crosses , have been already considered ( supra , p. 102 ) .
In experiment 45 , the same self-black rat was crossed with an albino which had been extracted from a cross of Cr2xCr4 ( experiment 71 ) .
The Cr 2 was derived from a cross of a wild grey x albino .
In experiment 46 , a very similar cross was made , but the self-black member was extracted from a cross between two " Irish " 5 individuals ( experiment 50 ) .
The albino used in this mating ( experiment 46 ) was sister to that used in experiment 45 .
We may , therefore , consider experiments 45 and 46 ' together .
The offspring will depend upon , the nature of the Cr 4 parent .
It will be assumed that the self-black parent in each case is homozygote , and in fact that used in experiment 45 has been proved to be so , by the previous results of 43 and 44 .
Albinoes extracted from a cross of Cr 2 x Cr 4 , may be expected to include individuals of the following zygotic characters : cgBsP , cgBSsP , cG-gBsP , and cGgBSsP ( supra , p. 111 ) .
If the albino is cGgBsP , and it is crossed with a homozygote Cr 7 , the prediction ( Table II , p. 109 ) is:\#151 ; 1 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 6 5 , If the albino is cGgBSsP , the prediction is :\#151 ; 2 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 6 5 + 1 Cr 6 a. In the two experiments ( 45 and 46 ) which we are considering , the total offspring is:\#151 ; 11 Cr 2 + 8 Cr 6 5 + 1 Cr 6 a. In experiment 46 no Cr 6 a type appeared , and it therefore suggests that the albino parent is cGgBsP , and probably differing from that in experiment 45 , in the absence of S. If , therefore , we take experiment 45 alone the result is:\#151 ; 2 Cr 2 + 2 Cr 6 5 + 1 Cr 6 This is as near as it is possible to get to expectation with the odd numbers obtained .
The presence of grey offspring in both experiments is conclusive proof that the two albinoes carried the grey determiner .
Thus in this case , prediction as to the nature of the Cr 2 , of the two-extracted Cr 4 individuals , and of the two Cr 7* individuals , is tentatively fulfilled .
The behaviour of the black individual in the manner described , in experiments 43 , 44 , and 45 , shows in a marked manner the influence which the albino parent exerts upon the nature of the offspring .
In experiments 43 * One of these two ( i.e. , that of experiment 45 ) is the same individual as that considered on p. 110 .
1907 .

115 .and 44 it had none but " Irish " b members in its offspring , 16 in number , because the albino with which it was mated had come probably from a piebald ancestry , and was carrying nothing but piebald pattern and black determiners .
But in experiment 45 it was mated with an albino in which it was probable that the grey determiner was present , because of its extraction from a grey parent .
And grey individuals then appeared in its progeny .
Grey individuals also appeared in the offspring of a sister albino when it was mated with a homozygote self-black .
( 7 ) Summary of Results .
The figures within brackets indicate the page where the matter of the summary may be found .
1 .
That black is dominant to albinism ( 113 ) .
The dominance is not complete , some ventral white being always present .
In relation to dominance this is perhaps not of particular significance , since ventral white patches are known to occur in both grey and black wild rats .
This conclusion is confirmatory of that deduced from Crampe 's results , and arrived at in Doncaster 's experiments .
It is theoretically conceivable that the incompleteness of the dominance is due to the influence of the factor s ( = absence of self-pattern ) brought in by the albino .
2 .
Expected types do not all always appear in any one litter of young , and frequently not until the third litter ( 106 ) .
Doncaster has also shown that there is considerable diversity in the proportions of the indivduals of each type in successive litters , but the examples published by him do not show whether a type present in one litter may be absent in another , as in several of my experiments .
3 .
Predictions based upon the doctrine of gametic purity and of dominance have not in these experiments ( including those not yet published ) been falsified by the appearance of unpredicted types .
With but few exceptions , the predictions with respect to the kind of types expected are fulfilled , and approximately so with respect to proportions .
The exceptions are due to the smallness of the number of offspring in certain cases .
4 .
The conception ( hitherto a matter of deduction ) that albinoes are the bearers of hidden factors , has been ocularly demonstrated for the piebald , " Irish " and self patterns ( 111 ) .
In peas a somewhat analogous phenomenon has been seen by Lock .
5 .
That completely self-black extracted forms are homozygous for black ( 110 , 113 ) .
This conclusion appears not to harmonise with some of Doncaster 's Mr. G. P. Mudge .
On Hereditary [ May 8 , results , i.e. , experiments 34 and 37 , where albinoes appeared in a cross when one of the parents is described as black .
Since the black parent was the same in both experiments , and its parents were unknown , it is not improbable that it was an " Irish " a , and not a true black .
If we make this assumption and accept the conclusion as to the nature of the Cr 6 a given in this paper ( Conclusion 7 ) , then the results of Doncaster 's experiments 34 and 37 are in accordance with prediction .
6 .
The " Irish " " b " type is a heterozygote .
Two zygotic forms have probably been experimentally recognised , of the composition CcgBSsP and CgBSsP ( 104\#151 ; 107 ) .
With regard to this conclusion , the first symbolic representation confirms that of Doncaster , while the second is new .
7 .
That the " Irish " " a " type is perhaps of the composition CcgBSP .
At present there is no direct evidence of this ; but in the possible theoretical gametic combinations { supra , pp. 103 and 109 ) such a composition occurs. .
The evidence shows that the " Irish " b always carries piebald and s , and this being so , the composition CcgBSP can be ascribed to the-"Irish " a form alone .
Some of Doncaster 's experiments ( 15 , p. 225r experiments 35 and 63 ) show that the " Irish " " a " does , in some cases , carry albinism recessive .
Hence his own conclusion , that the Cr 7 is only an extreme type of Cr 6 a and is not a separate variety , needs for the present to be accepted with hesitation .
My work indicates that the Cr 7 is homozygote for black ( see 5 ) .
The above considerations suggest that the two varieties are-distinct .
And , taken in connection with Conclusion 6 , suggests that both " Irish " a and " Irish " b are heterozygotes .
With regard to the composition CcgBSP ascribed to the " Irish " a , there is to be remembered Doncaster 's conclusion , which I endorse , that the " Irish " a and the Cr 7 have given no evidence that they carry P. But there is nothing inconsistent between this conclusion and the symbolic representation of this form , because S and P are not allelomorphic to each other , and , therefore , though P may be present , it cannot be manifested so long as S is also present in the same gamete or zygote .
Even if the " Irish " a contains P , and it is crossed with an albino carrying P , no piebald forms , will be expected in the P 1 generation , because it ( the " Irish " a ) also carries S " Neither are they expected if " Irish " \#171 ; x " Irish " a. Piebald forms cannot appear until s is introduced into the " Irish " gamete or zygote .
The evidence indicates that when this is done the " Irish " b zygotic form is produced .
It seems impossible , therefore , to obtain direct experimental evidence that the " Irish " a carries P. 1907 .

11T 8 .
That of the various theoretically possible types of albinoes , the following four have in these experiments been shown to ejdst , i.e. , cgBsP ( 102 , 106 , .
110\#151 ; 111 , and 112\#151 ; 113 ) , cGgBsP ( 109 , 112 , 114 ) , cgBSsP ' ( 108 , 112 ) , and cGgBSsP ( 112 , 114 ) .
To a lesser extent , the evidence indicates that two-other types , i.e. , cGBsP and cGBSsP , also exist ( I12)i That is , of the four types experimentally recognised , so far , all carry both the- black and piebald factors ; one , and perhaps three , in addition , carry the grey factor , another the self-pattern factor , and one , or perhaps two , carry both the grey and self-pattern factors .
The type cgBSP has not yet been demonstrated to exist .
Of these four or six types , Doncaster has shown the existence of the two first : : the others are new for rats .
Hurst has shown the same thing for rabbits , i.e. , the existence of albinoes carrying B , and of those carrying BG .
They also carry in some individuals the self character , in others the Dutch character , and in others both .
The same thing has been shown for mice by Cuenot and Allen .
There is thus a similarity in the carrying powers of albino rats , mice , and rabbits .
In rats and rabbits it is to be noted no albino has yet been obtained which carries G alone , i.e. , without B. 9 .
That self-grey types ( Cr 2 ) may carry both black and piebald recessive .
The following two forms have been experimentally recognised , i.e. , CGgBSsP ' ( 111 ) and CcGgBSsP ( 111 ) .
One thus carries plbinism recessive in addition to the black and piebald determiners , and the other does- not .
Clearly they correspond to the two races of " Irish " b revealed in these experiments .
From some of Doncaster 's experiments it can be seen that the Cr 2 type carries B and P recessive , but he made no attempt to ascertain whether different zygotic varieties of this type existed .
The discrimination of these two zygotic varieties is therefore new .
10 .
That piebald black-white types ( Cr 5 ) may be homozygous for black and piebald , or may carry albinism recessive ( 105 , 106 ) .
This conclusion can also be deduced from Crampe 's experiments ; none of the Cr 5 types in Doncaster 's experiments appear to have been homozygous , and all carried albinism recessive .
11 .
Externally considered , similar zygotes may have a different gametic constitution ( see above , 6 , 8 , 9 , and 10 ) .
In experiments not yet published , it can be shown that self-grey forms not distinguishable in external features from those in 9 , do not carry g , and therefore B , though present as a recessive character , cannot appear .
Zygotic characters alone are not , therefore , a safe basis for prediction .
This confirms and extends the same conclusion which has been arrived at in all experiments which give Mendelian results . .
12 .
With regard to the number of allelomorphs for colour and pattern , theMr .
G. P. Mudge .
On the Hereditary [ May 8 , evidence shows that there are two pairs for each , i.e. , presence and absence of greyness , presence and absence of blackness , presence and absence of selfness , and presence and absence of piebaldness .
13 .
Doncaster divided Crampe 's " Irish " type into a and sub-types ( 100 ) .
In this paper I propose a stricter definition of the " b sub-type .

Ancestry and Offspring Tables .
Explanations .
The " Offspring Columns " include Crampe 's seven types , \#151 ; Cr 1 = grey with no white.* Cr 2 = grey with ventral white patches and white carpal and metatarsal bands .
Cr 3 = grey-white piebald .
Cr 4 = albino .
Cr 5 = black-white piebald .
*Cr 6 b == " Irish " b ; black with ventral white patterns or patches and white carpal and metatarsal bands .
*Cr 6 a = " Irish " a ; black with little ventral white and no carpal or metatarsal white bands .
'Cr 7 = self black .
* The division of the " Irish " type Cr 6 into " a " and " b is due to Doncaster , while I am responsible for the definitions of the two sub-classes as here given .
The number of the parental pairing is given in the column headed Expt. The number of the ancestral pairings will be found in their respective columns .
Experiments from 1 to 41 and from 67 onwards will be given in later papers .
A few of these are to be found on the Descendants ' Tables ( Pedigree Charts I to III ) .
