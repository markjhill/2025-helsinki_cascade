" On the Theory of Ventilation : an attempt to establish a positive basis for the calculation of the amount of Fresh Air required for an Inhabited Air-space/ * By Surgeon-Major F. de Chaumont , M.D. , Assistant Professor of Hygiene , Army Medical School .
Communicated by Prof. Parkes , M.D. , F.R.S. Received November 18 , 1874 .
The question of ventilation , and the amount of fresh air required to keep an inhabited air-space in a sweet and healthy condition , has been much discussed of late years , and very fully treated of by various writers ; but there was a good deal of vagueness and want of precision in the manner of treatment previous to the Report of the Committee on Metropolitan Workhouse Infirmaries in 1867 .
In a paper in the \#171 ; Lancet ' in 18661 attempted to show that a more scientific method might be employed , and suggested some formulae , which were quoted by Dr. Parkes in a paper appended to the Report above mentioned .
Professor Donkin also investigated the question there , and in a short but exhaustive paper showed 188 Surgeon-Major F. de Chaumont on the [ Jan. 28 .
that , general diffusion in an air-space being admitted , the same amount of air was required to ventilate it , whatever its size might be .
In another paper , published in the ' Edinburgh Medieal Journal ' in May 1867,1 went into the subject with the view of pointing out that we might , with existing data , establish a basis , which should be both scientific and practical , for estimating the amount of air required ; and I adduced some results to show that the evidence of the senses might be employed ( if used with proper care and precautions ) as the ground-work of a scale , and gave a short table of the amounts of respiratory impurity ( estimated as CO ) which corresponded to certain conditions noted as affecting the sense of smell .
This paper attracted the attention of General Morin , who made it the text of a short article in the Journal of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers during last year .
Since the publication of my paper in 1867 T have accumulated more data ; and the number of observations being now sufficient to give at least a fair approximation to the truth , I beg to call attention to the results .
It is generally admitted that it is organic matter , either suspended or in the form of vapour , that is the poison in air rendered impure by the products of respiration .
It is also admitted that it is the same substance that gives the disagreeable sensation described as " closeness " in an ill-ventilated air-space .
Although the nature of the organic matter may vary to a certain extent , it will be allowed that a condition of good ventilation may be established if we dilute the air sufficiently with fresh air , so that the amount of organic matter shall not vary sensibly from that of the external air .
Unfortunately all the methods devised for the determination of organic matter in air are both difficult and unsatisfactory , so much so that they are almost practically impossible in a ventilation inquiry .
Observations , however , as far as they have gone , seem to show that the amount of organic impurity bears a fairly regular proportion to the amount of carbonic acid evolved by the inhabitant in an air-space ; and as the latter can be easily and certainly determined , we may take it as a measure , of the condition of the air-space .
This being accepted , and general diffusion being admitted , we can easily calculate the amount of fresh air required to bring down the C02 to some fixed standard , adopting as a datum the ascertained average amount of C02 evolved by an adult in a given time .
If , now , we adopt as our standard the point at which there is no sensible difference between the air of an inhabited space and the external air , and agree that this shall be determined by the effects on the sense of smell , our next step is to ascertain from experiment what is the average amount of C02 in such an air-space , from which we can then calculate the amount of air required to keep it in that condition .
The sense of smell is very quickly dulled , so that , in order to keep it acute , each air-space to be examined ought to be entered directly from the open air .
For this reason I have not included in the present paper any of the observations made in prisons , as it is almost impossible , from their con575 .

All the results , x erefore , have been obtained in buildings where this could be done , viz. irracks and hospitals , and the following are those examined :\#151 ; Aldershot Permanent Barracks .

The plan followed in all was to take the observations chiefly at night , hen the rooms or wards were occupied , and when fires and lights ( except he lamp or candle used for the observation ) were out .
In this way all isturbing sources of C03 were avoided , except in the occasional rare istances of a man smoking in bed or the like .
On first entering the 1 oom from the outer air the sensation was noted and recorded just as it t ccurred to the observer , such terms as " fresh , " " fair , " " not close , " 3 f close , " " very close , " " extremely close , " \amp ; c. being employed * .
Most t f these notes were made by myself ; but a good many were also made by lie assistants , Sergeant ( now Lieutenant ) Sylvester in the earlier , and i iergeant H. Turner in the latter experiments .
The air was then collected i generally in two jars or bottles , for controlling experiments ) , and set I side with lime-water for subsequent analysis , and the temperatures of he wet- and dry-bulb thermometers noted .
About the same time samples )f the external air were also taken , and the thermometers read .
In this vay any unintentional bias in the record of sensations was avoided , and his source of fallacy fairly well eliminated .
In some of the earlier observations the COa in the external air was not )bserved as constantly in connexion with the internal observations , partly because the importance of this was not so clearly perceived then , and partly from want of apparatus , the jars used being very bulky and not sasy of carriage .
It might therefore be argued that the combination-weights of the earlier experiments should be less in calculating the averages .
I do not think , , however , that this would amount to any sensible difference in the result , as the external C02 ratios adopted from single experiments accord fairly with the mean ratio of the outer air f. In each * N.B. The terms used in the Tables are exactly those noted down at the time of observation .

The vapour and humidity were calculated from Grlaisher 's Tables .
Although the records of sensation are various in terms , I have thought that they might be advantageously reduced to five orders or classes , as follows :\#151 ; No. 1 .
Including such expressions as " fresh , " " fair , " " not close , " " no unpleasant smell , " \amp ; c. , indicating a condition giving no appreciably different sensation from the outer air .
No. 2 .
Including such expressions as " rather close , " " a little close , " " not very foul , " " a little smell , " \amp ; c. , indicating the point at which organic matter begins to be appreciated by the sense of smell .
No. 3 .
" Close , " indicating the point at which organic matter begins to be decidedly disagreeable to the sense of smell .
No. 4 .
" Very close , " " bad , " \amp ; c. , indicating the point at which organic matter begins to be offensive and oppressive to the senses .
No. 5 .
" Extremely close , " " very bad , " \amp ; c. , indicating the point at which the maximum point of differentiation by the senses is reached .
Where there was a slight smell of tobacco no change in the record was made ; but where the smell of tobacco was strong , the observation was generally referred to the next order , both because the presence of the tobacco-smoke indicated slow change of atmosphere , and also because the sense of closeness must have been considerable to make itself felt along with the tobacco .
Hence such a remark as " rather close , " which properly belongs to No. 2 , is referred to No. 3 , " close , " if accompanied with a strong smell of tobacco . .
The total number of observations for the temperature , vapour , and humidity in the inhabited spaces amounts to 247* , and of carbonic-acid analyses to 473 .
Where the latter are in pairs they are linked by a bracket .
In each case the external and internal observations and their differences are given , and the arithmetical means of all are taken .
In the differences which represent the quantities due to respiratory impurity ) the mean error , error of mean square , and probable error ( both of a single measure and of the result ) are calculated , and the limits shown between which the range would lie in each case .
The values are also given as the reciprocals of the squares of mean error and of probable error of result , and their ratios to No. 1 as unity .
The modulus is also calculated from the mean error and error of mean square , and the ratio of the two results It has been thought unnecessary to give these in detail as taking up too much space , but the means are given at the end of the Table of Carbonic Acid .

Analyses of the different Orders .
No. 1 ( see Table No. 1)*.\#151 ; " Fresh " \amp ; c. : a condition of atmosphere not sensibly different from the external air .
1 .
Temperature.\#151 ; The experiments were made during both winter and immer , so that there is a good deal of variation in the external tempe-iture , and the mean is some degrees above the mean annual temperature : this country ( southern part of it ) , viz. 57'*47 .
The mean in the inhaled air-spaces is 62'*85 , or 50,38 higher .
This is a moderate difference , ad shows a good average temperature for dwelling-rooms .
The maxi-lum range is 10 ' ( 57'*89 to 67'*81 ) , calculated from the error of mean juare , the actual extremes being 77 ' and 53 ' .
2 .
Vapour and Humidity.\#151 ; As the external temperature varied con-derably , so also did the amount of vapour , the mean being 4*285 , equal about 80 per cent , of humidity .
The internal observations showed a lean of 4*629 , or 73 per cent , of humidity , being an excess of vapour of *344 of a grain , and a lowering of relative humidity equal to 7 per cent. 3 .
Carbonic Acid.\#151 ; The mean external carbonic acid was 0*4168 , a the above the usual amount .
The mean in the inhabited air-spaces was '.5998 , or an excess of 0*1830 , the mean error being 0*0910 .
The pro-able error of a single observation is 0*0831 , so that the truth would lie ietween 0*2661 and 0*0999 ; whilst the probable error of the result is my 0*0078 , the range being between 0*1908 and 0*1752 ; we are tbere-ore entitled to say that the limit of impurity , imperceptible to the sense if smell , lies at or within 0*2000 volume of C02 per 1000 as a mean . ?
rom these data , then , w*e may lay down as conditions of good ventilation he following:\#151 ; Temperature about 63 ' Fahrenheit .
Vapour shall not exceed 4*7 grains per cubic foot .
Carbonic acid shall not exceed the amount in the outer air by more than 0*2000 per 1000 volumes .
No. 2 ( see Table No. 2).\#151 ; " Rather close " \amp ; c. : a condition of atmosphere in which the organic matter begins to be appreciated by the senses .
1 .
Temperature.\#151 ; In this series the external temperature ( although still above the mean temperature of this climate ) was rather lower than in the previous one , viz. 54'*85 , whilst the internal observations gave a mean of 62'*85 ( the same as in No. 1 ) , or a difference of 8 ' .
2 .
Vapour and Humidity.\#151 ; Although the temperature was the same as in No. 1 , the amount of vapour in the inhabited air-spaces was greater , * It has not been thought necessary to publish Tables 1\#151 ; 5 , but they are preserved in the Archives of the Society .
Surgeon-Major F. de Chaumont the [ Jan. 28 , both actually and relatively , the excess being 0*687 of a grain and the lowering of humidity being about 7*6 per cent. 3 .
Carbonic Acid.\#151 ; The mean amount in the outer air was 0*4110 per 1000 volumes , in the inhabited air-spaces 0*8004 , or a mean difference ( respiratory impurity ) of 0*3894 .
The range for the probable error of result lies between 0*4057 and 0*3731 .
We may therefore say that ventilation ceases to be good when the following conditions are present:\#151 ; Yapour in the air exceeds 4*7 grains per cubic foot .
C02 in excess over outer air , ratio reaching 0*4000 per 1000 volumes .
No. 3- ( see Table No. 3).\#151 ; " Close " \amp ; c. : the point at which the organic matter begins to be decidedly disagreeable to the senses .
1 .
Temperature.\#151 ; The temperature in this series was more near the mean of our climate , viz. 51'*28 .
The mean in the inhabited air-space was 64'*67 , or a mean excess of 12'*91 .
2 .
Vapour and Humidity.\#151 ; The vapour in the outer air was 3*837 , and in the inhabited air-space 4*909 , a mean difference of 1*072 grain per cubic foot .
The drying of the air amounted to a lowering of the humidity by 11*56 per cent. 3 .
Carbonic Acid.\#151 ; The carbonic acid in the outer air was 0*3705 per 1000 volumes , rather below the average .
In the inhabited air-spaces it was 1*0027 , or a mean difference of 0*6332 due to respiratory impurity , the range for the probable error of result being between 0*6477 and 0*6167 .
We may therefore say that ventilation begins to be decidedly bad when the following conditions are reached:\#151 ; Yapour reaches 4*9 grains per cubic foot .
Carbonic acid in excess over outer air to the amount of 0*6000 per 1000 volumes .
* No. 4 ( see Table No. 4).\#151 ; " Yery close " \amp ; c. : the point at which the organic matter begins to be offensive and oppressive to the senses .
1 .
Temperature.\#151 ; The mean external temperature was 51'*28 , and the internal 65'*15 , or a mean difference of 13'*87 .
2 .
Vapour and Humidity.\#151 ; The mean vapour in the outer air was 3*678 grains , and in the inhabited air-spaces 5*078 , or a mean difference of 1*400 grain per cubic foot .
This corresponds to a lowering of the humidity by 8'*58 per cent. 3 .
Carbonic Acid.\#151 ; The mean amount in the outer air was 0*3903 per 1000 volumes , pretty near the usual average .
In the inhabited air-spaces it was 1*2335 , or a mean difference due to respiratory impurity of 875 .
] Theory of Ventilation .
193 .8432 , the range for probable error of result being between 0*8640 and .8224 .
We may say that ventilation is very bad when:\#151 ; Vapour reaches 5 grains per cubic foot .
Carbonic acid in excess over outer air reaches 0*8000 per 1000 volumes .
No. 5 ( see Table No. 5).\#151 ; " Extremely close " \amp ; c. : the maximum point of differentiation by the senses .
1 .
Temperature.\#151 ; The temperature in the outer air was 51'*86 , and a the inhabited air-spaces 65'*05 , giving a mean difference of 13'*19 .
2 .
Vapour and Humidity.\#151 ; The mean vapour in the outer air was \gt ; *875 , and in the inhabited air-spaces 5*194 , showing an excess of 1*319 grain , corresponding to a lowering of relative humidity of 9*88 per cent. 3 .
Carbonic Acid.\#151 ; The mean amount in the outer air was 0*4001 , or jxactly the average amount .
In the inhabited air-spaces it was 1*2818 , showing an excess due to respiratory impurity of 0*8817 per 1000 volumes , the range for the probable error of result being between 0*9202 rad 0*8432 .
The extreme point of differentiation by the senses is thus reached when the following conditions are found:\#151 ; Vapour 5*100 grains per cubic foot .
Carbonic acid in excess over the amount in the outer air beyond 0*8500 per 1000 volumes .
It will at once be seen that the figures in No. 5 differ but little from those in No. 4 , and that the probable limit of differentiation by the senses is reached in No. 4 .
The number of recorded observations in No. 5 is also very few comparatively ; and I think it would therefore be better to group the two together , as below .
Nos. 4 and 5 combined , being the probable limit of possible differentiation by the senses .
1 .
Temperature.\#151 ; In the outer air 51'*43 , in the inhabited air-spaces 65'*12 , or a mean difference of 13'*69 .
2 .
Vapour and Humidity.\#151 ; The vapour in the outer air was 3*729 , inside 5*108 , or a mean difference of 1*379 grain , corresponding to a lowering of relative humidity of 8*92 per cent. 3 .
Carbonic Acid.\#151 ; In the outer air 0*3928 , in the inhabited air-spaces 1*2461 , or a mean difference due to respiratory impurity of 0*8533 , the range for probable error of result being between 0*8717 and 0*8349 .
Wo may therefore , I think , say that when the vapour* reaches 5*100 grains per cubic foot , and the C02 in excess 0*8000 volume per 1000 , the maximum point of differentiation by the senses is reached .
* It is to be understood that the amounts of vapour stated in these cases are in reference to a mean temperature of about 63 ' F. Surgeon-Major F. de Chanmont on the [ Jan. 28 , By referring to the Tables it will be seen that there is a regular progression as we pass from one order to another .

In every case the combined 1 and 5 series is superior to the two singly , being nearly their sum .
In all the Tables it may be observed that the humidity is somewhat irregular in relation to the amount of vapour .
This may be understood from the fact that it is a complex quantity , depending partly on the amount of vapour , and partly on the temperature .

80 We have now a series of ratios which follow a regularly descending scale , very much in the order we might have expected a priori , seeing that the sense of smell is naturally less acute as the organic matter increases in amount .
But it is of less consequence to determine the position of the higher orders in the scale , except as a measure of the general value of the observations throughout the inquiry , the really important point being the very great superiority of the first order , particularly as regards the carbonic acid .
This is an additional argument for its adoption as the limit of admissible impurity in good ventilation .
\#166 ; The amount of fresh air necessary to keep the impurity down to the particular limit would be according to the following formula , P where d is the delivery of fresh air in cubic feet per head per hour , e the amount of carbonic acid expired per hour by one inmate , and p the limit of respiratory impurity taken as carbonic acid per cubic foot .
If we take e to be 0-6 of a cubic foot in a state of complete repose ' , such as during sleep , we are rather under Pettenkofer 's estimate , but considerably above Angus Smith 's .
The following Table gives the amounts necessary for the three estimates:\#151 ; No. of order .

199 i [ think that the general opinion is that Angus Smith 's results give too an estimate , and that 0*600 is really the lowest that can be with | s.ety admitted .
The existing Army Regulations contemplate a delivery of 1200 cubic i f it per head per hour in barracks ; but practical inquiry has shown that i ts amount is generally fallen short of .
The result is that the life of 11* soldier , at least during his sleeping-hours , is passed in a No. 3 air-sa.ce , or one in which the organic impurity is decidedly disagreeable to 11 senses .
Previous to 1858 he did not even get this moderate amount c air ; so that his life was spent in an air-space in which the organic utter was offensive and oppressive to the senses .
If we adopt ( as proposed [ ready ) 0*2000 per 1000 of C02 as the limit of impurity , then 3000 cubic jet per head per hour is the amount which must be delivered , on the fpposition that e= 0*600 , or 3525 if 0=0*705 .
We may say , in conclusion , that the experimental data already quoted irly justify the adoption of the following conditions :\#151 ; Conditions as the Standard of good Temperature ( dry bulb ) 63 ' to 65 ' Fahrenheit .
" ( wet bulb ) 58 ' to 61 ' " N.B. The temperature should never be very much below 60 ' , but it ay be found difficult to prevent its rising in hot weather .
In any tse the difference between the two thermometers ought not to be less tan 4 ' , and ought not to exceed 5 ' .
Vapour ought not to exceed 4*7 grains per cubic foot at a temperature \#163 ; 63 F. , or 5 grains at a temperature of 65 ' F. Humidity ( per cent. ) ought not to exceed 73 to 75 .
Carbonic Acid .
Respiratory impurity ought not to exceed 0*0002 per \gt ; ot , or 0*2000 per 1000 volumes .
Taking the mean external air ratio at 0*4000 per 1000 , this would ive a mean internal air ratio of 0*6000 per 1000 volumes .
By considering separately the conditions found in barracks and in hospitals , or among healthy and among sick men , a point of some interest nd importance seems to be indicated\#151 ; namely , that more air is required or the latter than for the former to keep the air-space pure to the senses .
This is due either to the greater quantity of organic matter or to a dif\#151 ; erence in its quality and nature .

It is , however , right to point out that in the one case the occupation was continuous , and in the other chiefly at night only .

( Abstract .
) The spectroscopic observations described in this paper were made with instruments belonging to the Royal Society , and in accordance with certain suggestions which had been made to the author by a committee appointed in consequence of a letter of his to Sir Edward Sabine , President , dated 13th February , 1866 .
In view of his residence at a considerable height above the sea-level , and of the exceedingly clear atmosphere prevailing at some periods of the year , it was suggested that the locality was peculiarly favourable for a determination of the lines 0 the solar spectrum due to atmospheric absorption , and that , for this purpose , the solar spectrum when the sun was high should be compared with
