IT has been thought advisable to eserve an account of the general aims and scope of the following paper till a few preliminary matters have been disposed of .
2 .
Consider the following statement , of the truth of which probably no one will doubt .
If a body on being moved from a position A to a position were found thereby to have Iost a charge of electricity , physicists would not be content to explain the circumstance on the mere ground that it had left its charge behind .
They would hold that processes had gone on , precisely similar to snch as would have been required to divest it of its charge , had it remained in its first position A. This has an important bearing on the way in which the " " electric displacement\ldquo ; is related to matter .
The polarisation thus called is some sort of polar.isation of and this polarisation is carried about by the when it moves .
There certainly is no lack of evidence that electric actions go on in space where there is , to the best of onr knowledge , no matter .
In this space , however , is a medium of some sort , which is intimately reiated to matter , and certainly affected in some way by the motion of matter .
For the present we must , for the sake of simplicity , be content to assume that the strains of this medium are , if it only bounds matter , continuous with those of matter , and if it permeate , matter , are at places common to both matter and the medium identical with those of matter .
( This may or may not be true .
I only say that in the first development of the theory of this paper it must for simplicity be assumed .
) This will not prevent us from regarding the slipping of the one medium over the other as the limit of a rapid shear .
With this assumption the medium in question will appeat in our mereIy as matter with zero density , bnt other physical quantities not zero .
Both for the medium referred to , and for matter , the statement would seem to remain true that the polarisation called electric displacement is a property that is carried about by the medium experiencing it .

687 their perfect turatness , seems to me to receive illustrabion in the methods about to be described .
notation in the present paper will be mainly the same as that of former paper on a " " Proposed Exbension of the Powers of Quaternion As in that .
paper ( which will for the future be referred to as " " the former paper a fixed of all the matter in space will be taken as a standard of reference .
Most of the following symbols have exactly the same meaning as before .
is the coordinate vector of any particle of matter in the standard the coordinate of the same particle in the present position , so that may be regarded as a function of the independent variables , ( the time ) , and denote elements of volume of the same particle in the standard and present positions ; elements of surface ; and the ullit normals at .
In the present paper another notation will also be used , defined by . . . . . . . .
( 1 ) , whence . . . . . . .
( 2 ) , and similarly for .
This meaning of 2 is scarcely likely to clash with the usual summation meaning ( which will also bo freeIy used in the present paper ) , since in the present use the 2 will always be preceded by , a combination that would be rare with the ordinary meaning .
With this notation equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the former paper take the somewhat riefer form . . . . .
( 3 ) , . . . . .
( 4 ) .
In connection with these tions it is well to call attention to the usual conventions which will be strictly adhered to .
The right-handed system rotation is adopted .
, or , when regarded , as in the last equation , as the normal of the boundary of any region , is always drawn from the region bounded .
Thus , if is regarded as the normaI to the bonndary of a dielectric at its junction with a conducbor , it is drawn from the point of the surface into the conductor .
The positive direction , that of in equation ( 3 ) , round the boundary of a surface , is that of positive rotation round a proximate positive normal , in .
Thus the positive direction round the boundary of a netic shell whose positive normal is in the direction of magnetisation is that of the equivalent current .
will have the usual meauing with to , and the same meaning with *oceedings of the Society of Edinburgh , ' 1890-91 , p. 98 .
THEORY OF CTROMAGNETISM .
[ compare for proof $ 603 eq. ( 11 ) with the corl.esponding eq. ( the last on p. 239 ) of S619 ] , and similar remarks , apply to the treatment in S 630 et seq. of the energy of the field .
How to bring these various parts of the subject under the dynamical treatment I did not strictly on MAXWELL'S own lines .
Again , in considering general equations of the electromagnetic field ( SS608 , 609 ) he speaks of a generalised force E. This generalised force .
quite contrary to dynamical analogies , , not a single definite effect , partly kinetic and partly static , but two independent effects , one static and the other kinetic .
On trying to trace out the reason of this , I could not arrive at any certain result strictly on MAXWELL'S own lines .
It seemed to me as if the double effect of was simply assumed .
[ If it were analogous an ordinary dynamical reaction , then it could not be associated with such external forces as result from electrolysis .
] 13 .
Whether these and many other similar questions which occurred , some of which will appear below , can , strictly speaking , be denominated difficuIties , is of no consequence .
it that they to the following considerations .
MA XWELL has built up a theory whose axioms can*be put down in a definite form .
Cannot , then , all his results ( electrostatic , electrodynamic , magnetic , and electromagnetic ) be developed as consequences of these axioms in one application of dynamical reasoning ?
Cannot we by such a single application obtain all MAXWELL'S equations from ( A ) to in SS 591 to 614 , as well as his stress resuIts contained in other parbs of the treatise , and by particular simplifying assumptions , show that the ordinary electrostatic and magnetic theories are particular consequences of our general results ?
This led me to attempt to apply in a perfectly rigorous and general manner the well-known equation . . .
( 1 ) ( where is the Lagrangian function , 'modified\ldquo ; if necessary , of any mechanical system of which is a coordinate , and the external force of type , and where the initial and final positions and times are not subject to variation ) to the present case .
The way I proposed to apply it was to all matter to be in any possible state as to strain and as to electric phenonlena , then to vary all the geometrical coordinates by simply giving to each element of matter an rbitrary displacement , and also to vary all the eIectric coordinates , and trace the mathematical consequences .
[ Note that on MAXWELL'S theory ( at least as I understand it ) these two val.iations are all that can be made , a variation in the netism being determined by the above variations .
] 14 .
And it was here at the outset that the greatest difficulty of any met with in the investigation occurred .
Consider a particular of assumiDg that the eIectric coordinates are the three components of for every point of space .
If by * It would be more correct to say " " some of whose axioms I wish to imply that I thoughb it advisable to Fill in the remainder tentatively and seek the lllR A. ON THE MATHEMATICAL the variation of geometrical coordinates an element of surface where there is finite surface density of electricity be moved from to , then in general the element of matter will by the variation of the coordinates only be entirely deprived of its charge , for this charge will be left at P. This result is , to say the least , unfortunate one , and to be avoided , if by legitimate means it is possible .
Still more disastrous results are arrived at if we assume that the components of for ement of matter are the electric coordinates , for then the charge in the whole of space is varied by a mere variation of the geometrical coordinates .
The legitimate way out of the difficulty seemed to be to assert that these electric coordinates , though theoretical]y permissible , were very unsuitable .
To find suitabJe ones it was natural to use the principle that the electric coordinates must be such that the variation in the coordin does not the of any portion of .
This is , of course , ensured by assurning that SD'd2 ' is unaltered by variation of the geometrical coordinates , and from this it is but a step to the assertion that is itself a suitable electric coordinate .
Intimately connected with this question of the independent variation of geometrical and electrical coordinates is that of the correct expression for an electric current in ( say ) an arbitrarily moving fluid .
It is not necessary to present all the reasons that occurred to me for the form already described ( S4 ) as these are sufficiently indicated in the above considerations of variation of coordinates . .
15 .
The resemblances and differences between the present fundamental assumptions and what I take to be MAXWELL'S , are , perhaps , more clearly brought out by analogy .
I will first describe what I understand to be the analogy which MAXWELL allows himself throughout his theory , in order more closely to realise the interdependence of the various physical quantities considered , and as an aid to memory .
The analogy contemplates the whole of space as being filled with an incompressible liquid .
In dielectrics the liquid is , as it were , held in elastic meshes , in the form of closed cells , so that if it be displaced it tends to return to its original position .
In the ideal conductor there are no such meshes , or rather there are meshes which do not form closed cells , so that the liquid can move through them , but is resisted while in motion .
An actual body which admits some but behaves also like a dielectric will be typified by meshes which allow a slow leakage of the liquid .
Now suppose into any space we introduce from some source more liquid .
This foreign liquid will be what is called the electric charge of that space , and it may be measured ( since the liquid is incompressible ) by the surface integral over the dary of the space considered of the displacement of the original liquid outwards .
Thus , " " electric displacement\ldquo ; is represented in the analogy by a flux of the liquid .
THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
The " " conduction\ldquo ; current is measured by the current of foreign liquid , and the " " displacement\ldquo ; current ( indicated in the present paper by the term " " dielectric\ldquo ; current ) by that of the original liquid .
In a simple conductor there is nothing to distinguish foreign from original liquid , and the conduction current this case is represented by whole liquid current .
A similar but not identical analogy will hold in the theory now advocated .
For fixed matter the whole of the foregoing would be true , but not for moving matter .
The liquid in the present analogy must not be incompressible , but must have a property in connection with matter which corresponds to the property of an incompressible liquid with reference to space .
An incompressible liquid is one of which only one definite quantity can occupy an assigned space .
In the present analogy we must say , instead , that the liquid is contained by matter , and that a given portion of matter always contains the same quantity of liquid .
If by any means we pump foreign liquid into this portion , then an equal quantity of liquid must pass out of the boundary of that portion of matter into neighbouring matter , and thus in the present analogy as in the electric displacement will have for analogue the flux of the liquid , but not as in that case , across a surface fixed in space , but across a surface fixed relatively to matter .
Similar remarks apply to currents .
E. Plan of the Pape 16 .
It will conduce to clearness to give some account here of the objects and aims of what is to follow .
The part of the paper succeeding this introduction is in three main divisions : The groundwork of the theory ; of results , and The detailed examination of these results .
The groundwork of the theory , though not , the longest of these , calls for most attention here .
It is divided into two parts , } ?
ptions and Preliminary dynamical and considerations .
I do not propose to here a resume of the different parts , but to call attention to certain prominent features .
The two most important of the fundamental assumptions are , perhaps , first , that in all cases , which I take to be one of the most characteristic features , if not the most characteristic , of MAXWELL'S theory , and secondly , that the modified Lagrangian function per unit volume , though , of course , it contains , does not contain any term involving magnetic moment per unit volume or magnetic induction .
Neither of these assumptions seems to be at variance with MAXWELL'S , and , as hinted , the first is taken up mainly because it is a fundamental feature in his theory .
Froln the first it follows that must obey the Jaws of incompressibility , and this naturally leads to the assumption that also invariably obeys those laws .
The second leads to very important consequences , which , I believe , have not before been traced , and which I wish to call attention to here .
Though not put quite in this form below they amount to this , that , where is the modified Lagran gian function per unit volume of the THEORY OF TROMA C of MAXWELL'S theory .
At any rate the results , though not in every respect identical with MAXWELL'S , are yeb so nearly identical that the true matter for ) rise is that they differ so little , rtnd in unimportant ways , his .
It must be added , to prevent of my own views , ] I no eans consider proven what I regard as the key to theory , and I strictly adhered to in this paper , the assumption that under all circumstances .
My position rather is , that while this assumption or may not be true , it is desirable to investigate as generally as possible what be trne , and what cannot be true if the assumption is .
In other words , I do not think that MAXWELL'S theory has yet had a fair , even at the of mathematicians , and the present paper is an attempt to provide more and means than hitherto have been available for such a trial .
The methods adopted are equaIly applicable to other sets of fundamental 19 .
Turning to the second part of the groundwork , the prcliminary and , it is necessary to remark that these considerations though not limited to an electric field , seemed absolutely in order to investigate the consequences of the assumptions .
With regard to the first two sections of this part of the paper on the ?
nodified kinetic and the .
free and on the entropy there is nothing which is likely to be questioned .
In the third section on forces , onduction of and of enerc , I a principle which opens the way for much criticism .
I would beg any readers to whom the form of enunciation is repugnant , to suspend theirjudgment as to the validity of the principle , not only until .
the first justification of it , but until they have seen it in action as it were , later in the paper .
What was wanted was to bring this group of phenomena , which are undoubtedly closely connected , under the same of treatment as is accorded to the reversible phenomena of a system by means of its grangian function , and the ( dependent ) entropy .
20 .
The way being thus paved , in the next principal division of the paper are deduced the general results of the theory , the most important of which are the equations of motion .
These are considerably more general than the ordinary equations of the field , and thus we are led to the last division of the paper , the detailed exftmination of these results .
The chief sub-divisions of this part are comparison with MAXWELL'S results , a discussion from the point of view of the present ) of thermoelectric , thermomagnetic , and the HA effects , and the ence of intrinsic energy through the field .
In comparing with MAXWELL'S results , wherever there is agreement , it is considered unnecessary to investigate further the detailed consequences .
Where there is disagreement the physical consequences are traced with more detail , and in no case can it , I think , be said that the results of this of the paper are condemnatory of the present theory .
In this place , too , the bearing of the present theory on the question of convection currents is discussed .

All enomena not determined by orces of nature of friction , will be osed given by a third function X , givell by where , unlike , do not in any way depend upon L. in forces and the thermal phenomena depend upon X will be explained later .

In choosing the coordinates of any mechanical system it is , of course , only to take them so that when given they completely specify the instantaneous position of the system .
But as in all ordinary dynamical problems , so in the general electromagnetic problem , there may be all the difference in the world between one set and another in respect to the simplicity of the investigations in which they are employed , and the amount of light they throw on the interdependence of the parts of the system .
Now , I believe I am right in saying that all writers on the present subject take as the electric coordinates the three coordinates of the vector for every element of volume in space where is the electric displacement at the point .
According to the viewjust advanced that is the measure of a property of the matter occupying the element , which is carried about with the matter , these are unsuitable coordiylates .
According to that view it is probable that the electric current is as intimateIy connected with the matter in which it resides , as is the electric displacement .
It would seem to follow that the current components could not in general be considered as the rates of variation of the corresponding electric coordinates .
4 .
Suppose all space split up into a series of elementary parallelepipeda which move with be the six vector faces of one such parallelepiped .
We shall take for our electric coordinates the three quantities , where is the electric displacement at the point , for every element in space .
[ The reason for the dashes will appear immediately .
] Moreover , we assume that the same expressions , when is replaced by , the current , are the rates of variation of the corresponding coordinates .
In other words , the current at any point is defined by the equation ( 1 ) , where is any vector element of surface which moves with , and denote differentiation with regard to the time which follows the motion of matter .
Thus the whole current through any surface which moves with matter tlJe rate of variation of the whole displacement through that surface .

As might be expected , the mathematical machinery tha appears to be most convenient for investigating as fully as possible the consequences of these assumptions , and others intimately connected with them , is novel .
And I may remark in passing that what Professor TAIT persistently and with complete justice emphasizes as one of the greatest boons that Quaternions grant to ungrateful physicists , viz. , hout this paper Mr. HEAVISIDE'S practice of replacing MAXWELL'S German letters by thick ordinary type is followed .

In MAXWELL'S 'Elect .
and Mag nd ed. , S12 , remarks : " " Physical vector quantities may be divided into two classes , in one of which the quantity is defined with reference to a line , while in the other the quantity is defined with reference to an area .
In electrical science , electromotive and magnetic intensity belong to the first class , being defined with reference to lines .
When we wish to indicate this we may refer to them as intensities .
On the other hand , electric and magnetic induction , and electric currents , belong to the second class , being defined with reference to areas .
When we wish to indicate this fact we shall refer to them as fluxes Now in connecting dashed with undashed letters it is absolutely necessary to bear in nund whether the vectors indicated are intensities or fluxes .
The connection between and will differ from that between and 7 .
Nearly all the physical vectors at a point will belong then to one of the following classes:\mdash ; Class I. Intensities .

* This part of the present paper should be read in connection with MAXWELL'S paper " " On Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities Collected Scientific Papers , ' vol. 2 , p. 257 , or ' Proc. London Math. Soc vol. 3 , No. 34 .
In connection with the naturalness of the prcsent methods , it may be of interest to note that the present paper was completed before had seen most suggestivo paper of MAXWEI , MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL I have not hesitated to put the symbolic vector , , among the intensities since it obeys all the laws thereof .
The definitions of the connection between , and and between , and may be taken as the first and third of equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) respectively .
The second and fourth equation of each set are easily deduced from these by observing that [ equations ( 26 ) and ( 37 ) of former paper ] , and that both and bitrary vectors .
It should , perhaps , be noticed that these connections between , and and between , and although very useful and intimately connected with the physical nature of the vectors indicated are , after all , only definitions , and thus the phrase " " where such and such a symbol is defined as a flux\ldquo ; will frequently occur below .
This merely means that , having assigned the meaning of one of the three vectors , say , by a physical definition , the allied symbols , and are defined by saying that the symbol in question is a flux .
The connection between and may } ) put in words , thus :be an any line integral of referred to the present position of matter is equal to the corresponding line integral of to the position of matter .
Of course , by the word " " corresponding\ldquo ; it is implied that the two line integrals are to be taken through the same chains of matter .
Similarly as to :\mdash ; If be flux , surface integral of eferred to the present position of is equal to the corresponding surface of referred to the position of : 8 .
It is convenient to give here the following four simple but useful propositions .
Prop. I. If be two intensities , is a flux.\mdash ; By this is meant that bears the same relation to as does to in equations ( 6 ) .

Going , now , back to our definition of electric coordinates ( S 4 ) , since for each element they may now be written , and since \amp ; c. , are constants , we see that the choice of coordinates is equivalent to regarding and not as the independent electric variable at any point .

I have deliberately led up as quickly as possible to a description of the mathe- matical machinery to be used subsequently , as it has been necessary to notice incidentally some of the essential characteristics of the fundamental assumptions and the methods of investigating their ences advocated in the present paper .
As a preliminary justification of these assumptions , I cannot do better than indicate the line of thought which led up to them .
In studying MAXWELL'S theory , and seeing how beautifully it was built up step by step from a mass of experimental facts , till the consistent whole stood revealed , it seeIned to me that , notwithstanding the general harmony of its different parts , there wasjust here still something to be desired , some single plan that should govern the whole .
statement may not seem justifiable , so I instance two examples of the want of harmony .
In one part of his treatise , the kinetic part , he works out the connections between the different parts of his theory by the general methods of Dynamics .
But not so in the statical part .
It would seem that the statical part of the subject , in such a plan as just mentioned , ought to appear as a particular case of the kinetic , whereas , in MAXWELL'S treatise , the statical terms in the equations are merely added on to those deduced from dynamical reasoning .
The same remark applies to the terms necessary to produce the mechanical effects of magnetism THEORY OF CTROMAGNETISM .
[ compare for proof $ 603 eq. ( 11 ) with the corl.esponding eq. ( the last on p. 239 ) of S619 ] , and similar remarks , apply to the treatment in S 630 et seq. of the energy of the field .
How to bring these various parts of the subject under the dynamical treatment I did not strictly on MAXWELL'S own lines .
Again , in considering general equations of the electromagnetic field ( SS608 , 609 ) he speaks of a generalised force E. This generalised force , quite contrary apparently to dynamical analogies , , not a single definite effect , partly kinetic and partly static , but two independent effects , one static and the other kinetic .
On trying to trace out the reason of this , I could not arrive at any certain result strictly on NJAXWELL'S own lines .
It seemed to me as if the double effect of was simply assumed .
[ If it were analogous to an ordinary dynamical reaction , then it could not be associated with such external forces as result from electrolysis .
] 13 .
Whether these and many other similar questions which occurred , some of which will appear below , can , strictly speaking , be denominated difficulties , is of no consequence .
it that they to the following considerations .
MA XWELL has built up a theory whose axioms can*be put down in a definite form .
Cannot , then , all his results ( electrostatic , electrodynamic , magnetic , and electromagnetic ) be developed as consequences of these axioms in one application of dynamical reasoning ?
Cannot we by such a single application obtain all MAXWELL'S equations from ( A ) to in SS 591 to 614 , as well as his stress results contained in other parts of the treatise , and by particular simplifying assumptions , show that the ordinary electrostatic and magnetic theories are particular consequences of our general results ?
This led me to attempt to apply in a perfectly and general manner the well-known equation ( 1 ) ( where is the Lagrangian function , 'modified\ldquo ; if necessary , of any mechanical system of which is a coordinate , and the external force of type , and where the initial and final positions and times are not subject to variation ) to the present case .
The way I proposed to apply it was to all matter to be in any possible state as to strain and as to electric phenonlena , then to vary all the geometrical coordinates by simply giving to each element of matter an arbitrary displacement , and also to vary all the electric coordinates , and trace the mathematical consequences .
[ Note that on MAXWELL'S theory ( at least as I understand it ) these two variations are all that can be made , a variation in the netism being determined by the above variations .
] 14 .
And it was here at the outset that the greatest difficulty of any met with in the investigation occurred .
Consider a particular consequence of assuming that the electric coordinates are the three components of for every point of space .
If by * It would be more correct to say " " some of whose axioms I to imply that I thoughb it advisable to lill in the remainder tentatively and seek the lllR A. ON THE MATHEMATICAL the variation of geometrical coordinates an element of surface where there is finite surface density of electricity be moved from to , then in general the element of matter will by the variation of the coordinates only be entirely deprived of its charge , for this charge will be left at P. This result is , to say the least , unfortunate one , and to be avoided , if by legitimate means it is possible .
Still more disastrous results are arrived at if we assume that the components of for ement of matter are the electric coordinates , for then the charge in the whole of space is varied by a mere variation of the geometrical coordinates .
The legitimate way out of the difficulty seemed to be to assert that these electric coordinates , though theoretical]y permissible , were very unsuitable .
To find suitabJe ones it was natural to use the principle that the electric coordinates must be such that the variation in the coordin does not the of any portion of .
This is , of course , ensured by assurning that SD'd2 ' is unaltered by variation of the geometrical coordinates , and from this it is but a step to the assertion that is itself a suitable electric coordinate .
Intimately connected with this question of the independent variation of geometrical and electrical coordinates is that of the correct expression for an electric current in ( say ) an arbitrarily moving fluid .
It is not necessary to present all the reasons that occurred to me for the form already described ( S4 ) as these are sufficiently indicated in the above considerations of variation of coordinates . .
15 .
The resemblances and differences between the present fundamental assumptions and what I take to be MAXWELL'S , are , perhaps , more clearly brought out by analogy .
I will first describe what I understand to be the analogy which MAXWELL allows himself throughout his theory , in order more closely to realise the interdependence of the various physical quantities considered , and as an aid to memory .
The analogy contemplates the whole of space as being filled with an incompressible liquid .
In dielectrics the liquid is , as it were , held in elastic meshes , in the form of closed cells , so that if it be displaced it tends to return to its original position .
In the ideal conductor there are no such meshes , or rather there are meshes which do not form closed cells , so that the liquid can move through them , but is resisted while in motion .
An actual body which admits some but behaves also like a dielectric will be typified by meshes which allow a slow leakage of the liquid .
Now suppose into any space we introduce from some source more liquid .
This foreign liquid will be what is called the electric charge of that space , and it may be measured ( since the liquid is incompressible ) by the surface integral over the dary of the space considered of the displacement of the original liquid outwards .
Thus , " " electric displacement\ldquo ; is represented in the analogy by a flux of the liquid .
THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
The " " conduction\ldquo ; current is measured by the current of foreign liquid , and the " " displacement\ldquo ; current ( indicated in the present paper by the term " " dielectric\ldquo ; current ) by that of the original liquid .
In a simple conductor there is nothing to distinguish foreign from original liquid , and the conduction current this case is represented by whole liquid current .
A similar but not identical analogy will hold in the theory now advocated .
For fixed matter the whole of the foregoing would be true , but not for moving matter .
The liquid in the present analogy must not be incompressible , but must have a property in connection with matter which corresponds to the property of an incompressible liquid with reference to space .
An incompressible liquid is one of which only one definite quantity can occupy an assigned space .
In the present analogy we must say , instead , that the liquid is contained by matter , and that a given portion of matter always contains the same quantity of liquid .
If by any means we pump foreign liquid into this portion , then an equal quantity of liquid must pass out of the boundary of that portion of matter into neighbouring matter , and thus in the present analogy as in the electric displacement will have for analogue the flux of the liquid , but not as in that case , across a surface fixed in space , but across a surface fixed relatively to matter .
Similar remarks apply to currents .
E. Plan of the Pape 16 .
It will conduce to clearness to give some account here of the objects and aims of what is to follow .
The part of the paper succeeding this introduction is in three main divisions : The groundwork of the theory ; of results , and The detailed examination of these results .
The groundwork of the theory , though not , the longest of these , calls for most attention here .
It is divided into two parts , } ?
ptions and Preliminary dynamical and considerations .
I do not propose to here a resume of the different parts , but to call attention to certain prominent features .
The two most important of the fundamental assumptions are , perhaps , first , that in all cases , which I take to be one of the most characteristic features , if not the most characteristic , of MAXWELL'S theory , and secondly , that the modified Lagrangian function per unit volume , though , of course , it contains , does not contain any term involving magnetic moment per unit volume or magnetic induction .
Neither of these assumptions seems to be at variance with MAXWELL'S , and , as hinted , the first is taken up mainly because it is a fundamental feature in his theory .
Froln the first it follows that must obey the Jaws of incompressibility , and this naturally leads to the assumption that also invariably obeys those laws .
The second leads to very important consequences , which , I believe , have not before been traced , and which I wish to call attention to here .
Though not put quite in this form below they amount to this , that , where is the modified Lagran gian function per unit volume of the MR. A. Mc AULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL position of matter , obeys the laws of .
incompressi that round every circuit there is an electromotive force equal to the rate of decrease of the surface integral of through the circuit , and that appears in subsequent equations in such a manner to compel us to identify it with the magnetic moment per unit volume .
* It is clear , then , that is , according to the present theory , the magnetic induction .
As the theory is developed below it is convenient to define as equal to and call the magnetic induction , leaving the justification till we examine the detailed consequences of the theory .
It is well to insist on this result here , as it does not appear obvious in the work below , but only comes out when a general review of a great part of the paper is made .
To put the matter in the form of a proposition :\mdash ; If the two fundamental assumptions are that , that , the grcmgian function per unit volume , can be expressed in terms involving but independent of magnetic induction and of gnetic moment per unit volume , the ?
?be 17 .
The other most important features of the fundamental assumptions are first those already described with reference to the electric coordinates , and the expression for the current in terms of the displacement ; and secondly the manner in which are treated the two currents , conduction and dielectric ( the latter being inappropriately , on the present theory , denominated the " " displacement current If there are ( and physicists seem agreed on the point ) two independent currents whose sum appears in the equation , and whose sum obeys the laws of incompressibility , it seems to me of the nature of a truism that there must be also two independent electric displacements whose sum obeys the laws of incompressibility .
I therefore , from the very beginning , recognise two displacements , and , which I call , for want of better names , the dielectric and conduction displacements .
This naturally leads to the contemplation of two independent kinds of electromotive force .
This last , however , is subsequently satisfactorily disposed of .
18 .
Before leaving the fundamental assumptions , let me remark that though in some important pects the present theory may seem to differ from MAXWELL'S , it will be found , I think , that just where the difference seems to be most marked , is MAXWELL'S theory most vague .
All the differences , if they really be such , have been forced on me lingly in the attempt to put into definite form what I take to be the essence * Strictly speaking , the last clause should be modified by the condition " " if the present position be taken as the standard position This , however , is only an accident of the particular form of enunciation , which , at the present stage , is unavoidable .
Perhaps it would be to call them the elastic and frictional displacements or the reversible and iersible displacements .
I wish to leave this point open for those better qualified to decide .
Of the sets of terms suggested above , the last seems to be the best .
The onIy reason for adopting in the present paper the names given the text is to imply the origin of the assumption that there are two such displacements .
Of coulse , if we call the two displacements reversible and irreversible , must also call the corresponding currents reversible and irleversible .
THEORY OF TROMA C of MAXWELL'S theory .
At any rate the results , though not in every respect identical with MAXWELL'S , are yeb so nearly identical that the true matter for ) rise is that they differ so little , rtnd in unimportant ways , his .
It must be added , to prevent of my own views , ] I no eans consider proven what I regard as the key to theory , and I strictly adhered to in this paper , the assumption that under all circumstances .
My position rather is , that while this assumption or may not be true , it is desirable to investigate as generally as possible what be trne , and what cannot be true if the assumption is .
In other words , I do not think that MAXWELL'S theory has yet had a fair , even at the of mathematicians , and the present paper is an attempt to provide more and means than hitherto have been available for such a trial .
The methods adopted are equaIly applicable to other sets of fundamental 19 .
Turning to the second part of the groundwork , the prcliminary and , it is necessary to remark that these considerations though not limited to an electric field , seemed absolutely in order to investigate the consequences of the assumptions .
With regard to the first two sections of this part of the paper on the ?
nodified kinetic and the .
free and on the entropy there is nothing which is likely to be questioned .
In the third section on forces , onduction of and of enerc , I a principle which opens the way for much criticism .
I would beg any readers to whom the form of enunciation is repugnant , to suspend theirjudgment as to the validity of the principle , not only until .
the first justification of it , but until they have seen it in action as it were , later in the paper .
What was wanted was to bring this group of phenomena , which are undoubtedly closely connected , under the same of treatment as is accorded to the reversible phenomena of a system by means of its grangian function , and the ( dependent ) entropy .
20 .
The way being thus paved , in the next principal division of the paper are deduced the general results of the theory , the most important of which are the equations of motion .
These are considerably more general than the ordinary equations of the field , and thus we are led to the last division of the paper , the detailed exftmination of these results .
The chief sub-divisions of this part are comparison with MAXWELL'S results , a discussion from the point of view of the present ) of thermoelectric , thermomagnetic , and the HA effects , and the ence of intrinsic energy through the field .
In comparing with MAXWELL'S results , wherever there is agreement , it is considered unnecessary to investigate further the detailed consequences .
Where there is disagreement the physical consequences are traced with more detail , and in no case can it , I think , be said that the results of this of the paper are condemnatory of the present theory .
In this place , too , the bearing of the present theory on the question of convection currents is discussed .
MR. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL Perhaps a clearer in sight into the true bearings of the present theory is obtained by the attempt below to explain thermoelectric , thermomagnetic , and the effects than by other part of the paper .
Especially clearly do some of the restrictions imposed ' the condition come out .
21 .
In the last sub-ivision it will be found that I entirely with Professor nterl)retation of his results , and show how quite a and , I , simpler flux of energy may be made to account for the ) of intrinsic energy in different parts of the field .
In particular , this interpretation would restore edcnce in what Professor considers he has shown to be a false view , viz. , that aspects of a current of electricity it may be looked upon as someconveying energy along the conductor .
part of the subject , although deduced the present theory , is OWII to be true on Professor PoYNTlNG'S uwn prenlisses . .
It is well here to call tention to what prove confusing otherwise .
In follows , and Qome allied symbols , stand for certain external forces .
But there re three different given in difFerent parts of the paper to these .
They are originally defined as the whole external forces of the different .
But in of frictional forces , \amp ; c. ( SS35 to 42 ) it is convenient to regard them as only those parts of the forces which are due to friction and the like .
Again from S50 onw rds it is convenient to them as meaning only those parts of the forces which are independent of friction and the like .
This inconvenience is incurred to avoid the greater evil of a large additional array of ] With this exception and one or two other trifling ones , which are noticed in their places , nowhere has the meaning of a symbol been changed throughout the paper .

They do not enable us to take account of ( 1 ) sliding friction ; ( 2 ) electrolysis ; ( 3 ) hysteresis and similar phenomena ; ( 4 ) contact-force .
All these , however , except ( 3 ) , can be taken account of by slight additions to our present assumptions , as in the case of ( 4 ) will appear ] ater .
The object of iting as above the number of the independent variables entering into and.x is to free the mind from unnecessary vagueness .
Moreover , the above assumptions are in one sense necessarily simpler than those made by Professor J. J. THOMSON ( ' Applications of Dynamics to Physics and Chemistry , ' 1st ed. , chap .

) to explain thermoelectric and thermomagnetic effects , in that the only quautity whose space-variations appear bove in or is , a statement not true of Professor assumptions .
With to forms of and as functions of their independent variables , it is simplest at present to make no restrictions .
28 .
I am a little doubtfUl whether writers on the present subject recognize two inde edent electric displacements at every point , but , as already remarked , it seelns to me to follow , as a matter of course , from the assumption of two independent currents .
The independent variables which have [ S 27 ( 25 ) ] above been chosen to take account of these are and , though , of course , and or and might have been chosen instead .
MAXWELL generally , but not quite without exception , seems to use the nbol D for what I have called .
I thought , however , that I should be following the usual custom of subsequent writers by using for the whole displacement .
If there be two independent e]ectrical displacements , it would seem as though we must assume , at any rate provisionally , the existence of two independent external electromotive forces of type and we shall denote by and respectively .
This , of course , means that the work done by the said external forces at the element , while change to and respectively , is .
We shall also assume external surface forces of these types ordinary forces and per unit volume and surface of the presenlt position of matter , an external stress being a self-conjugate linear vector function of Class I of S 9 above .
This last statement means that the real *Iu the former paper meant the force per unit volume of the standard position of matter .

It is not to be supposed that the coordinates we have assumed are sufficient to fix the position of all matter in space .
The mathematical machinery we use cannot be supposed sufficiently fine to trace the motion of molecules .
Such coordinates as would be required for that purpose are " " ignored Now ( LARMOR , 'Proc .

And that our principle may be true ) particular type of modification is assigned , i. e. , the nored coordinates are those whose momenta appear explicitly .
Aud a further restriction is necessary ( LARMOR , as abovej , viz. , the ignored coordinates must only appear their momenta .
That is , the ignored ates must be what Professor J. J. THOMSON ( ' Applications , ' 1st ed. , S7 ) has called kinosthenic or speed coordinates .
This last restriction , however , is not absolutely necessa1y if we take to be the average value of the modified Lagrangian function for a small time , sufficiently large to allow the molecules to through all their types of motion many times .

Whether these restrictions be imposed or not we have the relation:\mdash ; . . . . .

We shall then assume that the energy in any finite region is the integral on the right of this equation for that region .

If be the external force of type , we have where is the actual increment in during the element of time .
This can , of course , be proved directly from eq. ( 2 ) .
It must now be remembered that all the above variations are only true if we suppose the temperature of every element of matter kept constant .
In other words , the last equation must , when we do not make this restriction , be replaced by . . . . .
( 7 ) , where stands for that part of the increment in which is due to increment in temperature in all elements of matter during the element of time .
Let now be the intrinsic energy ( including under this term the ordinary kinetic energy of matter as well as all other forms of energy ) of all the matter in space .

We shall now suppose that the symbols , stand for those parts only of ths external of the various types , which are owing to friction and the like .
To determine their values we shall use the principle paper and and in the former paper [ paragraph following eq. 40 ) ] when used as affixes .
There are objections from the printer 's and proof-reader 's point of view when the ffix i anything other than a mere letter .
For instance , in the present case , and , still more , in eq. ( 2 ) , S 44 , below , are objectionable on these grounds .
Is it not , then , desirable to have , at any rate , an alternative notation As an alternative to , let me here suggest any one of the following : .
Of these I should personally be incliued to favour or , the latter rather than bhe former .
] instance , in this notation , eq. ( 18 ) would become which , I think , shows that the sufficiently striking , while it has advantago of great simplicity .
* I have not been able to reduce this to simpler form or to substitute a simpler principle leading to the same esults .
I merely wished to make all the phenomena of the kind now being considered depend cn some single scalar function , mtlch as the reversible phenomena depend on the single scalar THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
( 24 ) , where now only implies such variations as are the consequences of varying the velocities of the dynamical systern and tloe , and whele of course is given in our case by ( 25 ) .
This last equation would have to be modified if we contemplated finite sliding of one surface over another .
In this paper , as already stated , we simplify by supposing this never to take place ( except in S64 below ) .
Equation ( 24 ) is more general than in this paper is required .
Throughout this paper , and therefore , will be assumed zero .
37 .
The truth of the principle can be verified ( as , admitting the J mentioned , will be shown directly ) by proving that its consequences are in complete harmony with three recognised principles : that frictional forces can be explained by what Lord RAYLEIGH ( ' Sound , ' 1st ed. , vol. I. , S81 ) calls a tion function ; ( 2 ) that the heat which is created by the destruction of energy other appears , in the first instance , at the elements of matter where the destruction takes place ; ( 3 ) the fundamental principle of conduction of heat , that the rate of flow , of heat out of any region across the element of its boundary .
where a self-conjugate linear vector function , which is itself a function of the state of the medium at the point .
38 .
To show the truth of these statements in the limited circumstances viz. , when is zero and there is no slipping , notice first what the effects of varying and only are .
A variation in will cause a variation in and .
The device used in the calculus of variations to ta account function L. When there are heat sources nob included im our system ( and X ) we ought to put and instead of and in eq. ( 24 ) , and being the rate of Upply of external heat per unit volume and surface .
The form of eq. ( 24 ) would perhaps be made more instructive by grouping together the terms If be the rate of ' absorption of heat\ldquo ; by a of the system , this expression transforms into 2 MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL of such equations of condition is well known .
In the present case it takes the following form : to the left of equation ( 24 ) add 2 S where are vectors ; SC and SH may then be regarded as independent .
It is to be noted that there is but one for an element of the bounding surface , i.e. , there is not one for each region bounded .
In our notation this may be expressed by saying that Now , by eq. ( 4 ) , S5 , above , SH d2 SH SHa Hence , since the part contributed to the left of eq. ( 24 ) by SH we get , by equating to zero the coefficient of the arbitrary vector SH , . . . . .
( 26 ) . . . .
( 27 ) , disappearing , since Again , before considering what is contributed to the left of eq. ( 24 ) by SC , it must be remembered that SC is not quite arbitrary , by reason of the equations of condition .
This is taken account of by adding to the left o eq. ( 24 ) SC d2 SC SCY * It may be objected that these equations of condition have already been taken account of in treatment accorded to the more general equations of , and , therefore , it is erroneous to take account of them again .
The answer to this is that it is not necessary to do this , but , on the other hand , it is not erroneous .
We must expect as the result that the 's will be , in a mathematical sense , redundant .
That this actually is the case will appear in S 65 below .
The reason for introducing them is to obtain the equations of the field in as familial a form as possible , and to show the mathematical dependence of the existence of a potential on the equations .
The process may be paralleled in the subject of the of Variations .

The recognised method is to use the singlo equation instead of the three , A and being functions of , . . .

It would not be erroneous to add to the left of the last equation , where was a function oi the same kind as A and B. One of the two , or , would be mathematically redundant , ib might bo convenient to introduce both and give rily , later on , some method of aSSignin a definite meaning to each .

Equating now to zero the coefficients of SC , Sc , we get . . . .

( 29 ) .
It be noticed that , defined eq. ( 26 ) , satisfies both the conditions of incompressibility . . . .
( 30 ) .
The first condition is obvious \amp ; om the equation .
The second is easily deduced from the equation .
For this last asserts that the component of a parallel to the surface is the same for both regions bounded .
Thus the line integral , which , by eq. ( 3 ) , Sb , taken over any closed curve on the surface , is the same for both regions .
It follows that .
We naturally assume that a is an intensity and a flux .
Hence , by S8 , . . . .

Next suppose that the only variation implied in equation ( 24 ) is in and , therefore , in .
Thus [ eq. ( 13 ) of former paper ] where is defined by saying that ( 33 ) , and that is a function of Class I. of S9 above.'k Now since [ former paper , eq. ( 39 ) ] , we have $ What immediately follows a particular case of a theorem required more than once beJow .

Also [ S 5 , eq. ( 4 ) above ] SSS Hence , the variation of leads to . . . . . . . .

( 36 ) .
41 .
The first of the three statements in S 37 is now obvious , as far as is concerned .
With regard to it must be remembered that cannot be made to vary without varying B Now [ RAYLEIGH'S 'Sound , ' 1st ed. , I. , S81 ] in order that frictional forces may be explained by a dissipation function X , in Lord RAYLEIGH'S sense , the frictional force corresponding to an independent coordinate should be For our purposes this is put more conveniently by saying that THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
where the 2 implies that assigned group of independent velocities , and no others , are varied , and where is the increment in X due to the variation Now , on account of the conditions , it is necessary that we consider the whole group of velocities , SC , throughout space together .
It is , then , as far as is concerned , only necessary to prove that S S the extending throughout space .
( As to the sign of these terms , it must be remembered the force corresponding to is not , but ) .
This is proved quite easily*by means of eq. ( 4 ) S5 .
Similarly , with regard to , it is only necessary to prove that S ' and this is obvious from the mode in which equations ( 33 ) ( 34 ) were established .
42 .
To prove the second and third statements , let for any finite region denote an integration taken over the true of that region , and an integral taken over both sides of any surface of discontinuity , as to physical quantities in the region , so that ( 37 ) .
Then , if we can prove that for finite region , ( Rate of increase of heat of doing work of frictional forces ) ( 38 ) , it will follow that the energy supply required to account for ( 1 ) the incl.ement of heat , ( 2 ) the work ( negative ) done by the frictional forces , consists of three parts , ( 1 ) * It should , perhaps , be noticed that and are now not perfectly arbitrary .
We may assume that and from the equations MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL the work done on the boundary by the viscosity stress , ( 2 ) the work done on the boundary by the frictional electric forces , a flux - of energy at every point of ce .
This may be put in , perhaps , the more familiar form : increment of heat in the consists of three parts , ( l ) the work done agamst the frictional throughout the region , ( 2 ) the done the frictional forces ( viscosity and electric ) on the boundary , and ( 3 ) the surface integral taken inwards at the boundary of a flux - .
Stated in this way we see that equation ( 38 ) is equivalent to saying that the conduction of heat is dne to a flux of heat - at every point of space , and that the frictional forces are sources of heat .
* These are statements ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of S37 ( except that here we have , and there we have a more definite form for flux of heat due to conduction .
) To prove eq. ( 38 ) , note that the expression on the left Now put [ equation ( 37 ) ] , and transform the integral by means of equation ( 4 ) S5 above into a volume integral .
In doing this note that by reversing the process of S39 we get is possible at this stage that two objections may be taken to this reasoning .
First it may be said that there ought to be no terms in the surface integral leading to the result that the frictional electric forces do on the boundary .
That this is not a sound objection will come out more clearly below , when the effect of will be found to in no way alter the ordinary views of the transference of electric energy through the field , and the effect of will be only to modify them in a way which would naturally be anticipated from the new hypothesis that has some influence on the frictional forces of the field .
Secondly , it may be said that besides the terms mentioned the text as contributing to rate of increase of heat , there should be a fourth due to such causes as the THONSON and PELTlElt effects .
This tement is , however , undoubtedly wrong , as will appear more clearly when We come to the consideration of these effects .
The explanation is that these effects are explained by terms in .
Hence , in equation ( 38 ) they are included on the left .
this is not considered convincing , let me call attention to equation ( 25 ) , S49 below , which asserts that the rate of increase of intrinsic energy ( including that of the THOMSON effect , \amp ; c in any space rate of doing work throughout the region of the external foroes which are not due to friction rate of heat supply from external sources situated in the regionsuch a surface integral as now is under consideration ( i.e. , confined to the trne boundary ) .
We have here for the sake of the next transformation added the term , since from the equations , it follows that THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
Thus we get for the expression on the left of eq. ( 38 ) of which the volume integral is zero [ equations ( 18 ) , ( 21 ) ] , and the surface integral is the expression on the right of equation ( 38 ) .
To get the expression for the flux of heat due to conduction we have merely to suppose to contain the term - , where 7 is a linear vector function of I. , of S9 above .
The heat flux referred to the position of matter due to this term and , therefore , by Prop. VI .
, 510 , the actual flux of heat is 43 .
It is known TAIT'S 'Heat , ' 1st ed. , S412 that if be the lowest available temperature , is the rate of dissipation or degradation of energy in Sir WILLIAM THOMSON'S sense .
Now by equations ( 35 ) , ( 36 ) , ( 39 so that may be called the rate of dissipation of energy per unit volume .
There seems very good reason then to call X the dissipation function .
It only differs from Lord RAYLEIGH'S function in the terms that lead to the conduction of heat .
If , as will usually be the case , is quadratic in and the velocities , , and the rate of dissipation per unit of volume will be .
For instance , the rate of dissipation per unit volume of the standard position due to conduction ) , and , therefore , per unit volume of the present position it III .
ESTABLISHMENT 0F GENERAL RESULTS .
A. Value of SL for a Finite portion of Matter .
44 .
As already remarked ( S84 ) the S in equation ( 1 ) S13 implies variation in everything but the temperature .
This will be assumed for the ) resent .
Sl depends [ S27 ( 25 ) ] on the variations of , .
* I suppose this result has been noticed beforc , tbough I do not know by whom .
MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL So far as it depends on will be supposed on to contain the term - , where is the density of matter in the standard position , and an ordinary potential ( quite independent , however , of electromagnetic phenomena ) .
Of course , so far as it depends on is supposed only to contain the term - .
Thus Sl consists of the following parts:\mdash ; S''l S''W . . . . .
( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , . . . . .
( 3 ) , -@ . . . . .
( 4 ) , . . .
( 5 ) , S/ 4 S(Il . . . . .
( 6 ) , . . . . .
( 7 ) , where ( I stands , as throughout the present paper it will stand , for , and where is defined by saying that . . . . .
( 8 ) , and that is of Class .
in S9 above .
The proof of equation ( 7 ) is exactly parallel to the treatment of in S39 above , and , therefore , need not be given here .
45 .
The of SL due to ( 7 ) is S2 ' by eq. ( 4 ) , S 5 , above .
The due to ( 6 ) is [ S 26 , eq. ( 19 ) ] SH SH SH When considering the whole of space this surface integral can be neglected , since by eq. ( 15 ) , S25 , , and by eq. ( 20 ) , S26 , .
If , as for *This transformation which assumes a fact still to be proved thab is given , not with the object of detel.mining the equations of motion , in which process this fact will 1iot be assumed , but to find the rate of change of energy in an assigned space .
THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
the present we assume , we are considering that parb of ) uted by a finite portion of matter we must retain the part of the surface integral due to the true boundary of the portion ( of S42 ) .
Thus the part of SL due to ( 6 ) is SC SA SH SD SD SA SH Collecting terms we have for any finite portion of matter SL Sd SA SH .
( 9 ) .
B. The Free Energy Rate of of Intrinsic Energy for any Finite portion of : 46 .
We now see from the principle enunciated in S33 , above , that the modified kinetic energy for all space is given by SCAds [ S25 , eq. ( 13 ) ] [ S5 , eq. ( 4 ) ] SBHds [ S26 , eq. ( 19 ) ] , the surface integral vanishing by S25 , eq. ( 15 ) and S26 , eq. ( 20 ) .
Thus ( 10 ) , where is in value , but not in form ( since we suppose it expressed in terms of the MR. A. McAULAY ON THEMATICAL same independent variables as l ) equal to the function which is reciprocal to with regard to and H. These three vectors may be [ S35 ] called velocities , and thus is in value the reciprocal of with regard to all the velocities involved in the latter .
Adopting now the notation of S33 and its nption ( end of S33 ) , we have . . . . .
( 11 ) . . . . .
( 12 ) .
That , the Lagrangian function ( per unit volume ) , and , the free enelgy , should be reciprocal functions ( in value only ) with regard to the velocities they contain , is in accord with the fact ( but not deducible from it ) that a statement is true for an ordinary dynamical system [ S33 , eq. ( 1 ) above ] .
Let now stand for the part of the free energy due to a finite portion of matter .
Required .
To find this , first obtain the rate of increase of that would occur if all the circumstances were such as actually occur , except that the temperature of each element of matter is kept constant , and then add the part due to the rate of variation of temperature .
To get the first of these we have at first to find the corresponding part of by changing all the S 's of eq. ( 9 ) into differentiations with regard to the time .
Then we have to subtract the result from , which is given by eq. ( 11 ) .
Thus we get .
It should be shown perhaps how the last integral appears .
It comes from the term in and from the two terms SA SD SA SH in SL .
These three terms contribute to But , since , , so that the volume integral can be THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
transformed a surface integral .
Transforming and noticing that the part of the surface integral is zero , the last term in equation ( 13 ) is obtained .
We may now obtain .
To do this , combine the first integralof equation ( 13 ) with .
We thus get by equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) of S34 , and equation ( 4 ) , S 5 Thus , from eq. ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) .
C. The Equations of Motion .
47 .
The symbols \amp ; c. , will now again be supposed to stand for the whole external ) rees including those due to friction .
The parts contributed by all of these except to Sq can be written down at once .
By the former paper p. 107 the force per unit volume ( of present position of matter ) due to is is assumed to be self-conjugat and of Class I of S9 above .
Thus is also self-conjugate , and therefore there is , due to it , no couple per unit volume .
The force per unit surface at a surface of discontinuity .
Thus the part contributed to 2QSq by is Hence all the terms ( Se SdSE SD ) ( 15 ) .
48 .
To obtain the equations of motion from these results , it must be remembered ( S38 ) that while S ' and Sd are quite arbitrary , this is not the case with SD and SH .
We adopt the same method here as in S38 , i. e. , we add to the SL for all space * It is clear by the work in the paper ( pp. 106 to 108 ) that there is no necessity to make this simplification .
On the other hand nothing seems gaiued by not making it .
MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL SD ( SC \mdash ; SH/ 4 ) SH , where and where are scalars and vectors ; SD and may then both be regarded as arbitrary .
The expression to be added to SL may , by equation ( 4 ) S5 , be written:\mdash ; S ( 16 ) .
Equating now to zero , the coefficient of SH in he extended , we get the disappearing on account of the relation .
This is the promised proof of equations ( 19 ) ( 20 ) of S26 , and , therefore , also of equation ( 18 ) of the same article .
49 .
SL and Sq are , , ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) in such a form that the sequences of equation ( 1 ) , S 13 , are seen by inspection .
They give ( writing for , so that is the density of matter in the present position ) . . . . . .

rate of doing work of external forces ( 23 ) , rate of supply of heat from external sources THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
so that may be called the " " power\ldquo ; of the external forces and heat sources .
may be divided into the part due to the frictional forces , i.e. , expression on the left of eq. ( 38 ) S42 , and the power of the really external forces and sources , i.e. , forces and sources included neither in nor .
From the equations of motion just obtained , and from eq. ( 14 ) above , Now , , since .
Hence [ eq. ( 4 ) , S5 ] Hence ( 24 ) .
Putting now and substituting the expression on the right of eq. ( 38 ) , S42 for , we get . . . .
( 25 ) where now has been put for the of eq. ( 38 ) , S42 , to distinguish it from the of equations ( 26 ) , ( 27 ) below .
50 .
In SS38 , 39 , it will be l.emembered that , \amp ; c. , stood for those parts only of the external forces which were due to X. Let , now , these symbols stand for those paxts only of the external forces which are not involved in X. Thus in equation ( 20 ) we must change into [ eq. ( 28 ) , S38 ] , and similarly for the rest of the equations of motion .
We thus get ( 26 ) . .
( 28 ) .
( 29 ) . .
( 31 ) .
MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL We collect here , partly for reference , partly to show more clearly the actual stage we have now reached , the other chief equations of the field . . . . . . . . .

[ The last set has not yet been proved , as it is more convenient to discuss it along with the detailed results , though clearly itself a general result .
] Roughly speaking , of these equations [ ( 25 ) to ( 38 ) ] , it may be said that ( 36 ) and ( 37 ) contain the assumptions of the present theory , and the rest the consequences of those assumptions .
Two remarks may be made here .
It is clear that , since in the equations ( 25 ) to ( 38 ) , and occur only under the form , there is nothing by means of which we could experimentally distinguish them .
Putting , then , ( 39 ) , we shall generally in the future speak only of .
It may be convemently called the potential , though , as we see later , this is not in accordance with MAXWELL'S usage of the term ; and , what is perhaps of more importance , there is something arbitrary about it apart from the arbitrary additive constant which every potential involves .
THEORY OF TlSM .
The second thing to notice is that the of equation ( 29 ) is not what is usually known as the electromotive force .
The physical fact that is stated by saying , must with the present notation be stated by saying that , since -RK appears on the right of equation ) as a part of the term .
This , of course , is due to the ' fact that of equation ( 29 ) is physica ] lie defined as the part of the electromotive force not depending on friction .
D. Change of Variables in , and 51 .
In what follows with reference to change of variables , we shall always speak as if the change had reference only to xactly similar reasoning applies to similar changes of variables in any .
function such as , or a part only of any one of these .
There is , indeed , no reason why the function should bc a scalar .
So far , has been assumed an explicit function of the list of variables ( 25 ) , S27 .
These are by far the most convenient variables for most mathematical operations , and we shall continue as often as otherwise so to regard .
For many physical ' tions , however , it is necessary to regard , or a part of it , expressed in terms of other variables .
Considel .
, for instance , air as a ectriC .
This will be taken account of by supposing to contain a term quadratic in .
Suppose , llow , we compress the air till its density is ( say ) doubled .
We know as a matter of experimental fact , that the specitic inductive capacity will not thereby be largely .
This will mean , not that the quadratic expression in is but slightly altered in form , but that the equal expression in is thus slightly altered .
Moreover , to express simply the fact of electric and magnetic isotropy of fluids requires that the independent variables should be the dashed letters .
Let then or . . . .

Defining similarly , it may be said here what will appear incidentally later , that and , and and are related to one another exactly as are and ; i.e. [ S46 , eq. ( 11 ) ] \ldquo ; ( 3 ) , where is put for \amp ; c. NIR .

In ( 2 ) it is to be noticed that one more variable , , occurs in l'than in or The reason is obvious , but on account of the fact , it is easiest to arrive at formulae nsforming differentiations of into the corresponding ones of by first considering the similar relations between and Let and be taken as a typical independent variable intensity and flux respectivoly .

( S7 .
) By considering the increment in and due to an increment in a or we at once obtain . . .

By a similar process it is easy to see that ( 5 ) .

We proceed to find the corresponding relations for the other variables .
Let us in and vary and every , and and Thus , ( S7 ) Hence @\mdash ; rn Sm .

( 6 ) . . . . . . . .
( 7 ) , bhe last result in each of these being given by equation ( 4 ) .
These equations show that , bear to one another exactly the same relations as which THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
may be expressed by saying that they are fluxes .
Similarly , is an intensity .
This particular result can , of course , be proved by a simpler process than the above .
We now see that the meaning of , obtained by defining as a flux , , and likewise the meaning of independent of the particular position of matter we take as the standard .
We also see similarly that the various terms in , resulting from regarding these vectors as intensit , ies , and utilising equations ( 28 ) , ( 29 ) ' S50 , will be independent of the particular standard position chosen .
And agal1l , by Prop. II .
, S8 , we now see that equations ( 3 ) of last section must be true .

Putting now S0 , S0 , the equation Sm7n glves SI S(I S .

Dismissing the particular notation of this paper for the luoment , and putting for the coordinates of and for those of , this may be written If we add [ equation ( 5 ) , S52 , above ] to the left of this equation and to the right , we get a well-kuown theorem of JACOBI'S .

E. Connection between 56 .
So far it has been assumed that there are two independent kin of external force denoted by and , and by and .
This is contrary to the usual custom , but seems to me to be a necessary consequence of assumptions always made as to the difference in nature between what is ordinarily called the displacement current and the conduction current .
The independent variables required to fix the electric state at a point have for mathematical convenience been taken as and .
These are , perhaps , not the most natural .
It would seem from the ordinary views as to the two kinds of current as if the dielectric displacement , and the conduction displacement are the most natural .
Moreover , I believe it is generally held that has exclusively to do with the potential energy of electrification .
It seems , then , likely to lead to correct results to assume that if and were taken as the independent coordinates , there would never be any external force of type As this conclusion may seem open to question let us put the matter in a different THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
way .
If ( regarding and as the independent electric coordinates ) we could be certain that we had found the full ssions for , both types of external electromotive force would be zero .
But we can with considerable certainty say that we have not found these completely , so far as they depend upon and ( electrolysis , \amp ; c On the other hand , it is by no means so obvious that we have not found them completely so far as they depend on and .
Let us then assume that the external force ( exclusive of frictional forces , of course ) of the latter type is zero .
If we can point to no experimental facts contradicted by this assumption , we may consider that the simplification is warranted .
57 .
Now ( S 28 ) the work done per unit volume by the external forces of equations ( 28 ) , ( 29 ) , S 50 above , while and suffer the increments and respectively , is SE SEdk .
Hence , if and be taken as the coordinates , the forces of those ypes would be and respectively .
The assumptionjust made then leads to ( 1 ) , where it must be remembered that the exact meaning of these four symbols is that given to them in S50 above , not the meaning they had previous to that section .
If we assumed that was independent of , equation ( 1 ) would be equally true of the previous meanings of the symbols .
We shall now always suppose to be replaced by\mdash ; E. With regard to and note that by means of equation ( 1 ) and equations ( 30 ) , ( 31 ) , of S50 . . . . .

It does not , however , prevent on present assumptions an explanation of the PELTIER effect .

DETAILFD EXAMINATION 0F THESE RmSULTS .
A. Maxwell 's Results .
58 .
The justification of the present theory , where it differs from accepted theory , must be based on an examination of its results in detail .
First , then , let us MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL with results .
With the exception of ( 1 ) the expression for current in terms of displacement for a moving body , and ( 2 ) certain of his mechanical results hich I hold to be inconsistent with certain others of his own , it will be found that his results flow from the equations now established .
We put , then , simple forms of and , the first involving as independent variables and , and the second and only , and compare the results with MAXWELL'S .
Besides results we shall find that this form of is sufficient to take account of the interdependence of magnetisation and strain , and of specific inductive capacity and strain .
After that we add certain terms to , and otherwise generalise and , still , however , them as involving no independent variables except such as occur in the lists ( 25 ) , ( 26 ) , of S27 .
Thermoelectric , thermomagnetic , and the HALL phenomena are thereby accounted for and discussed in detail .
Finally , to account for electrostatic contact-force ( and incidentally capillary phenomena ) , we shall assume to contain certain independent variables not in the list ( 25 ) of S27 , and shall adopt a certain form for 59 .
For NIAXWELL'S results it is only necessary to assume . . . .

( 2 ) , wheoe is a flux , and are self-conjugate functions of Class I. of S9 , and is one of Class II , all four being functions of strain and temperature .
From these statements , and S9 , it follows that * I did not notice when first [ former paper , p. 119 ] using in this signification that it already had a special quaternion meaning ( conjugate of a quaternion ) .
As this meaning is never required in the paesent paper , and very rarely in physical applications , I have nevertheless retained the present meaning for K. I take opportunity of apologising for the apparent want of system in my notation .
It has been brought about by an attempt to compromise between accepted notation and a system of notation more suitable for quaternion methods .
May I the following system P Firsb , let the Greek alphabet be left as a happy hunting ground for symbols of every denomination ( vectors , scalars , linear vector functions , \amp ; c. ) ; secondly , let the ordinary alphabets , , B. . .

Equation ( 5 ) is the same as equation ( 22 ) , S26 , above , ( 7 ) as ( 23 ) S26 , ( 8 ) as ( 14 ) S 25 .
We can now show that equations ( 6 ) , ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) all follow if we assume that there is no exterl ) force other than that due to friction .
By the last paragraph of S 50 above , we see that what MAXWELL calls is not likely to be what on the present theory we call .
To compare with ordinary theories , then , it is convenient to introduce a new intensity defined by . . . . . . .

) , therefore where ( 22 ) .
This equation ( 6 ) .
Of course , this more complicated fornl of equaf , ion ) is necessary for some purposes , but the simpler form is more useful in the general theory .
From the simpler form , indeed , we may see at once that MAXWELL S result must follow , since it implies the truth of the principle from which he uces he ded his result .
That principle is ( Elect. and Mag. , ' 2nd ed. , S 598 ) that the line integra of round any closed curve moving with matter equals the rate decrease of the lille integral of round the same curve .
Since both and A are intenslt ] es , this may in our notation be expressed by saying that the line integra line inte ral of round the fixed curve equals the rate of decrease of the line integl'ao roun the fixed curve .
This last is clearly insured by the equation Thus in the results contained in equations ( 5 ) to ( 11 ) the present theory is in complete agreement with MAXWELL'S .

It remains then to investigate the physical bearing of the points of difference , Equation ( 13 ) , of course , could not be expected to represent the results of f , he present theory , from the definition of a rrent adopted in above .
Equation ( 13 ) asserts that the dielectric current is .
The question is by what on the present theory this statement must be replaced .
Since a flux by former paper equations ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) , ce [ ibid. , equation ( 25 ) ] by TAIT'S ' Quaternions , ' 3rd .
ed. , S157 , equation ( 2 ) .
Hence ( 23 ) , which equations have already been given anticipation , in equation ( 38 ) , S50 .
In the case of an incompressible substance ( solid or fluid ) , and , therefore , \fnof ; m(24 ) , and for a rigid body whose angular velocity ( vector ) is this simplifies further to . . . . .
( 25 ) .
Thus , on the present theory neither nor is the dielectric current .
The effect of the difference between the theories will be very slight in most experimental work , though it will , of course , lead to results in the solution of certain problems which involve currents in moving bodies .
64 .
There is one experimental result , however , in connection with which equation ( 28 ) has considerable interest .
In the ' Phil. Mag V. , vol. xxvii [ 1889 ] , p. 445 , Professor THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
ROWLAND and Mr. HUTOHINSON describe the experiments by which they have proved that a moving charged body acts on surrounding bodies as it should on the Ilvection current theory .
Now , this can be shown ccurately to follow from equation ( 23 ) if we make the double assumption that the rnedium in contact with the moving conductor is at rest , and ( 2 ) that the slipping which thus place may be regarded as the limit of a rapid shear ; and approximately to follow without the assumption .
First , then , assume there is no slipping .
Let the motion be steady .
If the moving dielectric be itself charged , we see by the term in that the effect of its motion is to cause the current due on the convection current theory to its charge .
Since the motion is steady , .
To take account of the remaining term of consider the current through a strip of surface constructed thus :Take an elementary line PQ in the surface of the conductor .
ough all points of PQ draw the lines of electrostatic induction ( lines at every point of which the tangent is parallel to Bound the strip of surface thus obtained at any distance from PQ by another element .
In fig. 1 the arrows indicate ( 1 ) the direction of motion of the conductor , ( 2 ) the Fig. 1 .
positive direction ( PQqp ) round the when the positive direction through it is that of the motion at .
The current through PQ taken over the strip .
The part contributed to this by the term of is by equation ( 3 ) , S 5 .
The parts contributed to the line integral by the lines of induction are zero .
Hence the current through the , strip where stand as usual for the vectors .
l.'he first of these terms is the rate of flow in the direction of motion of electrostatic charge through the ] ement , A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL .
Hence , if at is small enough to be neglected in the above expression , the whole current which on the present theory would be flowing through the strip PQqp the same as the current due to surface charge , which on the convection current theory would be flowing in the same direction across the element .
The extension to the case when slipping is allowed and the dielectric is at rest is obvious .
With regard to the plausibility of this explanation , it must be remembered that in this paper we admittedly do not take account of the independent motion in the very same space of two mediums such as air and ether .
Now , probably , ether is at rest relative to the conductor , and it is reasonable to suppose that the relative motion of the conductor and the ether is of more importance in connection with the part of than the relative motion of the air and the conductor .
On the other hand , as the air carries about with it any charge it possesses , it is the motion of the air we must consider in interpreting the term .
Indeed , if we suppose the ether only to bound the conductor and the molecules of air , and that the ether is mainly at rest ( i.e. , acts to the conductor and the molecules of air much as an ocean of perfect fluid , which could slide over surfaces , and was originally at rest , would act to the conductor and rnolecules supposed immersed in it ) the explanation is complete .
[ I do not wish to imply that I endorse this theory of the relative behaviour of the ether and matter ] .
On the whole , I thin it may be said that this test of the correctness of eq. ( 23 ) is fairly well met .
65 .
Before comparing eq. ( 12 ) with the corresponding results of the present theory , it is necessary to make one or two remarks on passages from MAXWELL'S ' Electricity and Magnetism .
' In the quotations I am about to make I have in every case changed MAXWELL'S notation to the notation used above , as leading to a dearer comparison of results .
Consistently with this , I have always substituted Quaternion language for the corresponding Cartesian .
In the first placet I wish to discuss MAXWELL'S views concerning the scalar he calls , and which has been above denoted by [ equations ( 6 ) ( 12 ) ( 22 ) ] .
In his second volume he to intend the symbol always to have the same meaning .
The first place in which it occurs in this volume is in S 598 , where he is investigating the expression for .
After that he proceeds : " " The terms involving the new quantity are introduced for the sake of giving generality to the expression for .
They disappear from the integral when According to a report in 'Nature , ' September , 1891 , p. 454 , Professor LODGE described to the British Association experiments which go to prove this .
I have not yet seen details of the experiments .
Before going further , attentiou may be recalled to the footnote of S38 abova THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
extended round the closed circuit .
The quantity is , therefore , indeterminate as far as regards the problem now before us , in which the total electromotive force round the circuit ; to be determined .
We shall find , however , that when we know all the circumstances of the problem , we can assign a definite value to , and that it represents , according to a certain definition , the potential at the point Now , I have looked in vain through the subsequent part of his treatise to find the promised definition of electric potential , and I have tried hard on MAXWELL'S own assumptions to see how the value he here speaks of is to be assigned , and I have totally failed .
He nowhere shows how to assign a value to ; whereas he qinly assigns a definite value to , and from equations ( 9 ) ( 10 ) above , he clearly assigns a definite value to .
From the equationjust given , then , it follows that must be indefinite in order to counterbalance .
the arbitrary part of , which is necessarily of the form some Leaping over this difliculty of MAXWELL'S assertions , however , i.e. , supposing definite , the question still remains what is the definite value of Light seems to be thrown on the question by the assertion above that it is the " " electric potential and the following , taken from S 630 of his treatise :\mdash ; ' ' The energy of the system may be divided into the Potential Energy and the Kinetic Energy .
' ' The potential energy , due to electrificat , , has already been considered in S85 .
It may be written where is the charge of electricity at a place where the electric potential is , and the summation is to be extended to every place where there is cation .
" " If is the electric displacement , the quantity of electricity in the element of volume is and where the is to be extended throughout all space He then shows that it follows that and proceeds : * For is assigned for every poiut of and [ lt is well known ] ) when this much and no more of a vector is known , it tcrm ( a scalar ) , this the full extent of its arbitrariness .
738 MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL If we now write the electromotive force instead , we find " " Hence , the electrostatic energy of the whoIe field will be the same if we suppose that it resides in every part of the field where electrical force and electrical displacement occur , instead of being confined to the places where free electricity is found Were it not for this last statement , the interpretation I should put on the whole of the above passage would be expressed thus : the case of electrostatics and .
In the case , where the electricity is not cannot be put in the form ; but )nevertheless assume that the equation is still true .
seems to me the intel.pretation that presents least difficulty , but it seems hard to reconcile it with the last sentence quoted , which implies that the equation is the same as the equation .
There seems only one other possible interpretation of the passage , but that lands us in hopeless difficulties .
This explanation is that the occurs in S598 , where it be put in the form has a different meaning from the which occurs in SS630 , 631 , where it is If he has changed the meaning of , we may presume that matters have not been further complicated by a change in the meaning of .
In this , 631 may be put thus : ( 1 ) It is ssumed that the energy of the field can be divided into two parts , electrostatic and electromagnetic .
( 2 ) The former of these , in the absence of electric currents , can be put in the form where is a .
It is assumed that this statement is also true when there are electric currents ( 3 ) It is assumed that the appearing in this expression is the same as the which occurs in the general equation ; and it is convenient to give it the name electric potential .
It will be acknowledged that these assumptions are more table than the one required for the first interpretation , and therefore I shall understand the passage to be thus , as at first , correctly interpreted .
But if this be so , we are as far off as ever from the conclusion that has a definite value which can appropriately be called the electric potential .
66 .
This is no mere question of terms , for [ equation ( 12 ) , above ] MAXWELL asserts that in the expression for the force due to the field occurs a term , and here the indefiniteness is not counterbalauced by the corresponding indefiniteness of There are more ways than one of compromising to get out of the difficulty .
* The * For instance , we may ( arbitrarily ) render defiuite by the equations and thus lender definite ; and we may then assert fhat equation ( 12 ) is correct .

course followed here is , of course , to abide by what the present theory leads to , and then to choose that rticular interpretation of the above passages which appears least at variance with our results .
[ It will be seen the above that the statements at the end of S50 , aboye , are true , viz. , that the potential of the present theory is certainly not [ equation ( 22 ) , S62 ] the same as ] potential , and that without some such assumption as our potential , like MAXWELL'S , is indefinite ) from an rary additive constant .

] It is , perhaps , unnecessary now to sa .
that the position I wish to aintain is that has not investigated in a perfectly general manner the consequences of his own theo1y , and that , consequently , some of his equations may prove inconsistent with that theory .
Equation ( 12 ) I hold to be such an equation .
So little right , indeed , has he to put this down as one of his general results that it is , I hold , inconsistent with other parts of his .
For instance , if the equation were consistent with equation ( 4 ) ; S640 ( ' Elect. and Mag 2nd edition ) , we should have , which not the case in general on MAXWELL'S theory .
I shall not , then , compare the mechanical results of the present theory with equation ( 12 ) at all , but shall adopt the simpler process of comparing the stress which results from the present theory with that which MAXWELL obtain in Chapter .
of Part I. , and Chapter .
of Part IV .
67 .
Before this comparison another matter must be considered .
MAXWELL , in accordance , I think , uniyersal custom , supposes that a molecular couple exists due to magnetism .
In the first place this extraordinary exception to our ordinary *As might be expected , the relation is in very many important problems whose details have been worked out , but it is not true in general , even when there are no currents .
Dropping the special notation of this paper for the moment , let ) their usual Cartesian meanings .

Let be any ncbion of .
If there be no currents , and if then wiJl and [ from the , which is the only equation be satisfied ] In this case and which clearly not in general equal .
The above expression for I is , of conrse , not the general one for is such this case , as we may add to it a term where is any vector .
Also , it is assumed tha that both and I are everywhere continuous , i.e. , and are continuous .
For stance put from to and from to MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL conceptionoe of stress seems to me unnecessary on general grounds .
It is well known that to every magnetic distribution there is an analogous conceivable distribution of ordinary statical electricity .
Io the ordinary action-at-a-distance theories the mutual mechanical effects of different parts of a magnetic system would be exactly the same as the corresponding effects in the analogue .
Why , then , should it be considered unnecessary in the case of electrostatics , but necessary in the case of magnetics , to postulate a molecular couple Why , in other words , say that the stress which would suppose existent in the electric analogue is exactly the stless really existent in the netic system ?
In the second place , although the process seems viciously needless , we may , if we like , conceive any physical phenomena involving stress as causing a molecular couple which is exactly balanced by a stress-couple .
[ It must be so equilibrated in order to insure nfinit , angular acceleration of an element of matter\mdash ; supposing , of course , that the ultimate constitution of matter were not heterogeneous .
] This latter stress-couple will be entirely of the nature of a reaction , since ( former paper , p. 108 ) it is entirely independent of tlJe potential energy of strain .
In the present case , then , in which we suppose electromagnetic phenomena to produce stress , we shall have one stress exactly equilibrating another stress , neither of them having anything to do with the rangian function .
This is only another way of that no physical conception whatever is gained by the supposition that the particular physical phenomenon produces a stress-couple .
We shall , then , consider it necessary to compare our results only with the pure part of the stress which MAXWELL supposes to exist .
Thus in S641 MAXWELL arrives at the conclusion that the stress required to produce obseryed electromagnetic phenomena is where ( VB'H ' .
) . . .
( 26 ) , ere ( } denotes the pure stress given by ( 27 ) .
Now , what in the former paper ( p. 108 ) was called the couple stress part of , namely , V , produces a couple per unit volume , and this must be equilibrated by some other couple per unit volume even when the body is not in equilibrium .
This couple can only result from a couple stress , , which produces a couple , , per unit volume ; and this is quite independent of the potentiai energy of strain , and therefore of the Lagrangian function .
Thus , If now , in addition to the stress we take account of the reactionary stress we si mply get the pure stress .
We shall then merely compare the stress which flows from the present theory with 68 .
It is well-known that MAXWELL'S stress can only be looked on as a normal THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
type of stress .
It by no means explains all the known facts .
It does explain satisfactorily such known mechanica ] actions of real co1lductors\mdash ; conveying currents and bearing charges\mdash ; and magnets on one another as are of the nature of apparent actions at a distance .
It does not at all explain the many known mechanical actions of one part of a conductor or magnet on another part which can be tested only by observing the ( small ) strains resulting .
In other words , conductors and magnets are found to behave mechanical]y , as they would if MAXWELL'S supposed stress acted outside them , but not as if stress existed internally .
It need not therefore be matter for surprise if , on the present theory , what would appear as the most suitable stress to regard as normal should differ from .
It is only necessary that just outside conductors and magnets it should be identical with MAXWELL'S .
To see what on the present theory should be regarded as a normal type we must discuss , from the physical point of view , the results of SS54 , above .
As far as I can see ( but this is , of course , largely a matter for personal judgment ) on the present theory we should recognize two normal types of stress\mdash ; one for fluids and one for solids .
The reason is that we may assume fluids to be magnetically and electrically isotropic , and that fluids are subject to indefinitely large strains , On the other hand , solids , even if magnetically and elecbrically isotropic when unstrained , cannot be considered so when strained and , moreover , their strains cannot exceed a certainusually very small\mdash ; amount without the form of being permanently altered .
For bodies which are isotropic , however large their strain , it is needless to say that we must regard the function as given in terms of the cLshed letters .
For such bodies , of equation ( 19 ) S54 is zero .
[ For let .
be the vectors of which is an explicit function .
Since the body is isotropic the value of must remain unaltered if we rotate all to the same extent round the same axis .
In particular , if we increase .

By equation ( 20 ) S54 above , we see that the assumption that ] amounts to assuming that the function of unit voturne of the body when slrained , however , is the as the Lagrangian function of unit of the body when unsirained .
By equation ( 29 ) , S55 , we see that the assumption amounts to assuming that that of the which causes the body to diffe , and )is contributed by given of the body , by stram .
Hence from equations ( 21 ) , S54 , and ( 30 ) , , we have For an isotropic body , of which the nction per ullit volume is unaffected by } ( 28 ) .
MR. A. McAULAy ON THE MATHEMATICAL For an isotropic body , that of the function per , which causes the body to differ from cted by strain ( 29 ) .
It is scarcely necessary to ) , that of course it is not meant to be here implied that there is any body whatsoever whose general Lagrangian function\mdash ; whether per unit mass or per unit volume\mdash ; is even approximately unaffected by strain .
It is only for brevity that we verbally contemplate such a body .
There seems little or no reason for choosing one rather than the other of these two stresses as the normal type of stress fcr fluids .
Both of them would satisfy the condition that for a gas which , however large its strain , always behaved like a vacuum , the normal stress would be the vacuum stress which resulted from identical values of and .
As the stress of equation ( 29 ) , however , agrees more closely with the pure part of stress than that of equation ( 28 ) , we will call the stress of ( 29 ) the normal stress for fluids .
For solids it is harder to find a suitable normal stress , but as by far the greater number of them ( non-magnetic bodies ) behave netically approximately like a vacuum , it seems to me that the most suitable is obtained by supposing of equation ( 27 ) , S 55 to be zero .
In this case , of course , we assume that for solids the normal type of stress the stress that , with identical values of and would exist in a vacuum .
Thus For vacuurn , . . .
( 30 ) , but it is needless to that this is not perfectly satisfactory .
The question may be asked why , in the present case , the stress of equation ( 29 ) should not be still retained as the normal one ?
The answer is , that the equation [ ( 30 ) , S 55 ] from which it is derived , and which actually must , in every exact discussion , be taken in its place , is a holly unsuitable one for a solid , while equation ( 27 ) , S 55 , is a suitable one .
Again it may be asked , Why not retain the stress equation in its original form , for solids ?
The answer to this is , that the important fact that the great majority of solids behave magnetically like a vacuum is not thereby readily taken account of 69 .
To compare these stresses and their effects with MAXWHiLL'S , it must first be noted that MAXWHiLL has only investigated the electrostatic part of his stress for the case of a series of charged conductors surrounded by a dielectric that behaves electrostatically like a vacuum .
I consider myself at liberty then to substitute anything for the electrostatic part of his stress which reduces to his for that particular case .
The stress he obtains in Chapter V. ofPart I. of his treatise For the particular case mentioned this may be written THEORY OF since for that case .
We shall assume that this is the correct expression in general , since thereby the stress of eqnation ( 29 ) is endered identical with the pure part of MAXWELL'S stress .
The pure part of his electromagnebic is the of equation ( 27 ) aboye .
Let us then put ( 31 or , if we assume that the } ) expression for is \mdash ; SK'R [ equations ( 28 ) , S50 and ( 20 ) , S35 ] , , and call MAXWELL'S stress .
[ Of course I do not thereby mean to render responsible for this form .

To sum up , of the two equations ( 28 ) and , ( 28 ) agrees more closely with MAXWELL as to the electrostatic part , and ( 29 ) more closely as to the electromagnetic part .
On the whole , equation ( 29 ) agrees more closely than ( 28 ) Of course , the normal stress [ eq. ( 30 ) ] we have adopted for solids is by no means the same as MAXWELL'S , except non-magnetic bodies whose specific inductive capacities are the ) as for a vacuum .
But this does not prevent our normal stress explaining all that MAXWELL'S stress explains , and , indeed , from the remarks at the beginning of last section , is now evident that for all useful purposes either the one stress or the other will serve equally well .
70 .
We have now compared the results of the present theory with all MAXWELL'S results contained in equations ( 5 ) to ( 17 ) , S 60 , above , except ( 16 ) .
Except for equations ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , the agreement is exact , and I think it may now be daimed that what the present theory gives instead of equation ( 12 ) , agrees , as well as ( 12 ) , with known facts , and what it gives instead of ( 13 ) agrees better than ( 13 ) .
Equation ( 16 ) itself is obvious enough since it merely asserts that has a potential when there no currents in the field .
But it suggests another question\mdash ; does the present theory lead to the mathematical theory of electromagnetism ?
It can be easily shown to do so .
The mechanical results when expressed in terms of and I ' have just been shown to result in forces and moments on conductors magnets regarded as wholes , as does MAXWELL'S stress .
These are all the lnechanical demands of the ordinary theory .
Equation ( 19 ) , S 61 , shows that , the relations between the whole magnetic moment per unit volume , the permanent magnetic moment per unit volume , and magnetic force at the point , may on the present theory , be regarded as the same as in the ordinary theory .
Only one other this , and the fact that I have in this paper called the stress of equation ( 29 ) the normal stress , I equation ( 28 ) is to be preferred , partly because the greater ] icity of the assumptions which lead to it , and parbly because of the greater simplicity of electrostatical results flowing from it .
OF TBOM A demand is made by theory .
and o11 ) one hand , must be determined in terms of and I ' , the other , by means of particular relations .
Let us tnerely to rid of the \mdash ; the standard position to coincide with the actual position .
One difference between MAXWELL'S theory and the ordinary theory is that according to the latter it is assumed that each individual yneti c molecule and each elemental.y current has own independently of rest\mdash ; in producing terms in H. Thus , consists of two parts , the depending only on the magnef , and the second only on the currents .
The first , where [ MAXWELL'S 'Elect .
and Mag 2nd ed. , S383 , equation ( 3 ) ] , where is the distance of the element from the under consideration , and where in the tions of the end of at the element is supposed .
The second part is obtained on the assumption that each closed current causes a tenn in which the corresponding magnetic shell would cause .
The second part is thus found to be The first part of A is supposed to depend on I in the same way as the , called the vector potential , of Part III .
of treatise depends , i.c. , [ S 405 , equation ] .
The second part , as with is ained by assuming that any dosed current will cause a term in A equal to the term A that ] be caused by the corresponding magnetic sheIl .
The second part is thus found to be We will suppose that the ordinary theory also admits that A is arbitrary in a term where is a scalar .
( This is only to render the comparison with the present theol.y simpler .
Perhaps it ought to be said that the A thus obtained in terms of I and on the ordinary theory is found to satisfy the conditions and that the present theory only agrees with the theory if we impose those relations .
) All this be expressed thus .
Defining and by ( 33 ) , we shall have . . .

MR. A. McAULAY ON THE fATIO A .
Now , on the present theory ( by means of the equations and by elimination of from the equations ) , Hence substituting for .
This is equation ( 35 ) .
Again substituting A for , and putting we get [ equations ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) , S 26 ] Also , This proves equation ( 34 ) .
That the present theory ( and MAXWELL'S ) , so far as and A depend upon I and thus leads exactly to the ordinary theory is of some importance .
One consequence is , that the mechanical action between bodies carrying currents and the induction of currents by the variation of position and magnitude of other currents and magnets , must necessarily be independent of the nature of the medium separating them , so long as that medium is non-magnetic .
This is in direct contrast with the known large influence the medium separating two charges of electricity has on the mutual actions of the bodies bearing the charges .
On the present , as on MAXWELL'S theory , this is simply owing to the fact that the ordinary theory of magnetism is in the points just mentioned , accurately true , whereas the theory ( action-at-a-distance , with consequently no difference of specific inductive capacity for different media ) of electrostatics is not even nately true .
[ Whether or not the theory I have called the " " ordinary\ldquo ; theory has actually ever been formulated is of little consequence .
I have , in the above , rately enough described what I mean by the term .
] THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
B. ccount of Hysieresis .
71 .
This seems to be the place to consider what bearing the phenomena of hysteresis upon such theories as the present .
No theory of electromagnetism can be considered complete unless it takes this important group of facts into account .
I do not here propose to give a theory of hysteresis\mdash ; so that the present theory must be in this sense confessed incomplete\mdash ; but it is necessary to notice what modificationls ought ictly to be made in the assumptions hitherto adopted .
Professor EWING Phil. , has given a theory which adapts itself to dynamical methods such as the present .
In his theory the phenomena of hysteresis depend upon the fact that groups of molecules can have various stable configurations , different groups at any instant having very di fferent degrees of stability .
The stability of a group is liable by variation of and to break down , so that the group up another configuration of greater or less stability , and the oscillations which necessarily ensue on the change result to our senses in production of heat .
On this view hysteresis is a phenomenon that prevents us , if we would take full account of the facts , from ignoring certain coordinates we have hitherto ignored .
We can , however , go on ignoring these coordinates if we suppose not to have a constant form in terms of the variables not ignored above , but a form which depends on the particular state as to these groups of molecules of an element of volume .
We must , then , suppose certain variables -call them hysteresis-coordinates\mdash ; which define the relative numbers of groups of different kinds .
Of these will be .
a function , but they are not of the nature of ordinary dynamical coordinates .
Their valoe merely determines the instantaneous form of as a function of ordinary coordinates , so that if one or more of the hysteresis-coordinates change , the form of changes and a new dynamical era begins .
In fact , they are very analogous to , and like they must not be varied when the dynamical coordinates are varied in order to obtain the equations of motion .
A mathematical development of Professor EWING'S theory may be supposed to furnish the of these variables , and experlment must then be appealed to at once to test the theory , and if the test be favourable , to find the exact of in terms of the variables .
And from the mathematical development , or that combined with experiment , we must look to find the laws of variation of the hysteresis coordinates when and vary .
72 .
This , of course , is only to be looked upon as an ideal procedure of events , which , perhaps , for man years cannot come about .
Meanwhile , tentative hypotheses as to the nature of these variables might be made .
For instance , it might be assumed that is always correctly given by equation ( 1 ) , S 59 above , and that the vector is the sole hysteresis coordinate .
In this case ( and ?
) would , of course , be assumed a function of as well as of .
Though this probably much too ' Nature , ' Oct. , 1891 , p. 566 . .
A. McAULAY ON MATHEMATICAL simple theory for the explanation of hysteresis phenomena , yet I believe it could be to account nearly all the known facts .
* But , at present , even if this assumption were made , we are very much in the dark as to how varies with , and compelled to fall back on such pure conjectures as are illustrated in the foot-nore .
mention only thing\mdash ; nearby all the detailed experiments on hysteresis deal only with variations of parallel to itself 73 .
Thus it is useless to attempt tisfactory theory of ysteresis at present , though we can see how , perhaps , in the future it may be made to fit into the present theory .
But these considerations show that we must be very cautious in discussing results which depend upon the of in terms of , for they imply that we are very ignorant of this for1n , even when we know how I varies with under assigned mstances .
Thus , for instance , in equation ( 30 ) , 55 , we can learn little of true meaning of so far as it depends upon .
The rest of in this equation , vever , being indepen dent of the form of , gives us information of no doubtful character .
C. On the Strains these Stresses .
74 .
The , object of the present paper is to discuss the general theory of electroagnetism .
It is not proposed , therefore , to deal more than is absolutely necessary in particular problems .
A word , however , must be said as to a certain class of problems connected with the stresses just ated .
After the question of hysteresis has been settled in some such way as just indicated , it will be possib ] to discuss in detail the exact form of of equation ( 29 ) , above .
do this , the data on which to argue will generally be the strains which accompany electromagnetic phenomena .
This necessitates the consideration of strains .
75 .
It must not be supposed that these strains will bear the same relation to the stresses as strain bear to the ordinary stresses considered in the mathematical theory of elasticity .
From equations ( 26 ) , ( 27 ) , S 50 above , we see that in the case of librium ( no external stress ) By suitably choosing the form of in terms of , and the functioms now to be introduced .
Lcb be positive scalar functions of Tw , and let be a vector function of the form funcfion \mdash ; not in general \mdash ; such that is ] ways negative .
The form of , like that of , is a funcbion of .
Let be the present and any previous value of H. Then assume that where UHTdh ) , the lower limit of the first integTal sign being , sbricbly , the of at an indefinitely remote epoch , practically at a time determined by the exponential .
I give merely to show in what sort of way we may stlppose to depend on the hisbory of body .
THEORY OF LECT Taking for simplicity the where there is no external , lorce poten tial ( W ) , we have Substituting now from equation ( 27 ) , 55 for , we see that this means that there is equilibrium to the silnultaneous existence of three stresses : ( 1 ) the ordinary elasticity theory stress , owing to terms which involve the stress which is independent of and , therefore , depends electromagnetic quantities ; ( 3 ) a stress due to terms in , which involve both and electromagrnetic quantities .
When these last are linear in , the stress will depend , like the second , upon netic quantities only .
If not linear , they will depend both upon and the electromagnetic quantities .
It is quite possible that there should be ) strain at all , and yet a very sensible stress due to electrolnagnetic actions .
In fact , in solving the elasticity problem\mdash ; having given the distribution throughout the field , of dielectri displacements , of ents , and of magnetisation , the strain at any point\mdash ; the only way in which the netic data can be used is , by finding the force per unit yolnme and surface respectively due to them , and then treating these forces as external .
That is , the knowledge of the which produces the effects of electromagnetism is of no use in discovering the strain actually resulting ; all the knowledge we can thus utilise is that of the forces ( per unit volume and surface ) due to such esses .
This shows that , to find the true expression for it is not sufficient to inves tigate experimentally what strain accompanies a given displacement , or current , or netisation a a point .
The problem is much more complicated .
The shapes of all the bodies present mufit be ssumed of quite as great importance as the gnetic quantities in deciding the form of from such experiments .
76 .
These remarks may be illustrated by considering the of MAXWELL'S stress in two different cases .
Choosing one shape of soft-iron body it will be found that he magnetisation will , according to MAXWELL'S stress , compress the body ; another shape , expansion results .
Suppose we have ( 1 ) an ) chor ring of soft ) ' this a layer of air of uniform thickness , ( 3 ) surrounding this coils of insulated uniformly distributed wire a current .
Take columoar coordinates , the of being the axis of the anchor ring , and let be unit yectors ( functions of the of a point ) in the directions of respectively .
At any polnt inside the coil we have .
Assuming to be a constant scalar Hence , irom equation ( 27 ) , S67 , * This seems to be the meaning of the third sentence of the on p. 269 of vol. 15 .
, ' Encyc .
Brit 9th ed. MR. A. McAULAy ON THE At the surface of the soft iron is tangential , and therefore continuous .
From this it easily follows that Hellae , due to MAXWELL'S stress , there in this case no superficial force and no bodily in the air , but there is a bodily force in the iron directed towards the aXlS .
The iron will therefore be compressed .
77 .
For the other case , notice ttJat the force per unit surface due to the electromagnetic part of MAXWELL'S stress is and by equation ( 27 ) , S67 , This can be put in several different forms , of which , perhaps , the following are the most useful , where the bar indicates the mean value for the regions bounded by the surface , and the suffixes and denote normal and tangential components respectively .
Thus and have the same value on both sides of the surface .
When is parallel to where is a scalar , not necessarily constant .
( But if not constant it has here a different meaning from what it has in the rest of this paper .
) In this case the tangential component of is zero .
For the first expression of equation ( 36 ) gives for the component in question So long then as we deal with isotropic media this surface traction is normal .
Corlsider a magnetically isotropic body surrounded by a non-magnetic medium , and let the magnetic region be denoted by the suffix , so that .
In accordance with what has been just proved we consider only the normal part of the traction .
Thus , Let now , Thus the last coming from he fact that .
Thus THEORY OF ]]CTROMAGNETISM .
; or ( 37 ) .
Hence for both paramagnetic and diamagnetic isotropic bodies surrounded by nonmagnetic media , MAXWELL'S stress leads to a surface braction which is always a tension ( except as in the anchor-ring when it is zero ) .
78 .
Consider now the well-known ordinary case of a soft-iron ellipsoid a constant scalar ) brought into a uniform field .
Inside the ellipsoid , and I ' are all constant , and therefore , so that is no bodily force .
Also since [ equation ( 27 ) , S67 ] . . . . .
( 3S ) , there is no bodily force in the rounding medium .
Hence , in the present case , the only force is the tension at the surface .
The ellipsoid will therefore be expanded by MAXWELL'S stress .
D. Thermoelectric , Thermomagnetic , and HALL Effects .
79 .
lt will be found convenient to discuss these various effects together .
The natures of the thermoelectric and HALL effects are well known and need no description here .
The thermomagnetic effects are perhaps not so well-known .
The original papers of VON ETTINGSHAUSEN and NERNSr ( the of these effects ) are in 'Wied .
Ann xxxi .
( 1887 ) , 737 and 760 , xxxiii .
( 1888 ) , 126 , 129 , 474 .
The effects are briefly described in Professor J. J. THOMSON'S 'Applications of Dynamics to Physics Chemistry , ' 1st ed. , S .
The principal features of these effects are that the electromotive forces due to differences of temperature are modified in two ways by the presence of magnetic force .
First , parallel to there is an electromotive force that varies approximately as ( the " " longitudinal\ldquo ; thermomagnetic effect ) ; and , secondly , at right allgles to both and there is an electromotive force , where is a scalar dependent on the temperature , but approximately independent of and TH ( the " " transversal\ldquo ; netic effect ) .
The latter effect especially large in bismuth .
There is evidence that these effects are closely connected with the HALL effect .
80 .
The natural way to discuss these results would appear to be to attempt to explain them by suitabie terms in .
But on the present theory it is possible that they may be explained by terms in .
According to the first explanation would be reversible phenomena , and according to the second irreversible phenomena involving dissipation of energy .
Thermoelectric effects are certainly at presenlt looked upon by physicists as reversible phenomena .
The two explanations\mdash ; which will for the future be referred to as the tbeory of reversibility and the theory of irreversibility respectively\mdash ; will be found in many respects very analogous , though , of course , we must expect striking difference of MB .
A. McAULAY ON IHE MATICAL results .
On the theory of this paper the most striking would seem to be that , while thermoelectric effects must in the be explained on the theory of reversibility , the explanation of the thermomagnetic effects by this theory is inadmissible by reason of certain collateral consequences .

Before discussing these equations in detail , it will be shown ow in the theory of eversibility certain very important restrictions must be imposed on the generality of as a function of , and , in order that known experimental facts shall not be contradicted .
These restrictions seem , for the most part , depend on the particular form of theory adopted in this paper ; but as the particular features of the theory which are thus involved are held by many physicists , ib is of ' to notice exactly what part of our fundamental assumptions causes the restrictions .
The direct cause of the trouble is the equation .
Now , it will be remembered ( S 16 above ) that equation flows from the assumptions ( 1 ) that contains and not explicitly , and ( 2 ) that .
If , then , it can be proved experimentally that the consequences of the restrictions developed below chief of which is that thermonlagnetic phenomena involve dissipation of energy , and that a part of the thermoelectric phenomena do the same ) , are contrary to fact ; one or both of these assumptions must be relinquished .
Thus , perhaps , in this unexpected quarter , will be found a practical test of the truth of MAXWELL'S fundamental assumption The consequences of ishing either of the above assumptions wouId probably be much the same , since it would lead to the physicist being compelled to recognise with THEORY OF ELHiCTROMAGNETISM .
Professor J. J. [ 'Applications , ' S17 ( 4 ) ] magnetic coordinates independently of electric coordinates .
It is interesting to note in this connection that Professor J. J. THOMSON ( ibid. , S59 ) working on somewhat differenlt lines from this paper , has found that thermomagnetic phenomena have a distinct bearing on the equation .
His conclusion is that equation must be given up , and that instead we shall have , being here assumed to be a scalar .
He assumes that thermomagne\fnof ; g)ic phenomena are reversible .
84 .
The first equation that challenges attention is ( 16 ) .
It might be thought that it was a truism that should remain constant in a steady field .
This , however , is not the case .
If the steady increase of implied by this equation does not produce a steady increase in some physical quantity which can be measured directly , the field will remain steady in the ordinary sense though increases .
Now the physically measurable phenomena depending on can be conveniently divided into three gtoups , ( 1 ) the stress at the point\mdash ; which leads to mechanical phenomena capable of meant , ( 2 ) the effect it has in modifying the value of at all points of the field \mdash ; which again leads to mechanical phenomena capable of measurement , ( 3 ) its effect on the induction of currents .
As to ( 1 ) it is certainly true that in many instances above does occur in the expression for the stress at a point , but this is in the case of solids purely a mathematical result .
By equation ( 27 ) S 55 we see that the rate of variation of will in general have no effect on the stress at a point .
With regard to ( 2 ) the question must be asked , how does the value of affect the values of \amp ; c. , at points other than that considered ?
The answer is \mdash ; solely by reason of the equations where it must be remembered is an explicit function of \amp ; c. If then the rates of variation due to are zero , the steady increase of will not produce a steady increase of \amp ; c. , at any point of space .
But these conditions are insured by equations ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) .
Hence we see that need not cause time variation of any phenomena .
As to the only electric effecf , of ( due to in E ) is one which remalns constant so long as remains constant , and , therefore , does not affect the steadiness of the field .
Hence equation ( 16 ) presents no difficulty .
Equations ( 15 ) , ( 17 ) , and ( 18 ) , however , do present very formidable difficulties .
It has been stated that the influence of on the electromagnetic tJes of the field is due to the equations .
It must now be added that the manner in which it thus affects the field depends on the form of its expresslo ] terms of \amp ; c. Now unless the principal term in is one depending on only , the behaviour of the body in question would not at all to the ) behaviour we know that bodies exhibit .
For stance , we know that . .
th always behaves very approximately as if it were non-magnetic .
This requires that MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL the principal term in should be .
It is needless to say that this will not in general be the case if involves D. In fact , in a steady field , the only conditions we should be able to assert that imposed upon the field would be those which resulted from equations ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) , which do not contain at all .
85 .
The conclusion we are bound to come to is that on the present theory there must be no term in which will result in containing D. Thus the thermornetic effects must be left to the theory of irreversibility .
It might be thought that all difficulty would vanish if , in 9 , instead of we substituted , since this would involve terms in similar to those given above for and since .
This , however , is not the case .
No term in can affect steady currents .
The equation determines the value of but does not affect the value of C. , since in equations ( 13 ) ( 14 ) we should have instead of , we see that no thermal effects would , owing to , occur in steady field .
86 .
None of these difficulties and restrictions are met with in the theory of irreversibility .
We shall find , however , that the thermoelectric consequences of that theory are inconsistent with known facts .
Both theories , therefore , are assumed as true in part .
In connection with thermoelectricity it is necessary first to establish equations ( 19 ) to ( 22 ) and ( 19A ) to ( 22A ) .
In these equations the notaf , adopted is that of Professor article in the 'Encyc .
Brit 9th ed. , vol. viii .
, p. 97 .
He there considers a circuit of two unstressed isotropic metals and , one of the junctions being at temperature , and the other at temperature .
The positive direction round the circuit is taken as that from the metal to the metal at the junction are the PELTIER and THOMSON efIects at the temperature , an the PELTIER effect at the temperature is the electromotive force round the circuit due to thermoelectric effecbs .
To consider such a case as this , and are , of course , ignored , and A is supposed a scalar .
For the future , in order to distinguish mole clearly between the theories , will be substituted for A on the bheory of reversibility .
It is necessary now to distinguish between and .
The former denotes tion when are taken as independent variables .
Now in all the commo1ler on thermoelectricity , different parts of the circuit aro not similarly strained , but similarly stressed .
This may be account of by regarding as a function of Regarding it as such denotes differentiation with to 87 .

ations ( and ( 20A ) are obtained in an exactly similar way .
It need only now be said from equation ( 14 ) the rate of absorption of heat at an element of the boundary of the metals and [ fig. 3 ] is PSC Fig. and also by the definition of PELTIER nect , it is rate of flow from the metal to the metal which equation ( 20 ) follows .
Similarly for equation ( 20A ) .
Equations ( 21 ) and are easily deduced from those now established .
88 .
In connection with equations ( 22 ) and ( 22A ) it advisable to make what may be looked upon as a digression , to examine whether , on the present theory , we have a right to identify the ] integral of any part of round a circuit with what , in the laboratory , is known as the electromotiye force of the particular kind round it .
To test this , we must see whether the total line integral of RK round the circuit what is called the whole resistance of the cuit whole current .
In equations ( 29 ) , ( 31 ) , S50 occurs a scalar or which , unlike the other terms in the equations , does not depend directly or indirectly ( as is the case with upon the form of or .
Consider now any closed curve which , if it anywhere crosses a SUl.face of discontinuity , passes , we shall suppose , from the region to the region .
Then , in the expression this unknown scalar does not appear as be easily seen by equations ( 29 ) , ( 31 ) .
Before taking this line integral , remove RK to the left of equation ( 29 ) , S50 , keeping all the other terms on the right .
THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
is the line integral the terms by thvrs on the right , which is the total electromotive round the curve .
Let us examine whether this statement is consistent with the one above about whole current and whole resistance .
Suppose the motion steady so that obeys the laws of incompressibility .
Consider an infinitely small tube of flow , and let this be the line along which the integral is taken .
Let be the whole current flowing along the tube .
Consider an elementary right section of the tube of length , and crosssection Td2 .
Thus and , therefore , the part contributed to the by the element in question is If then we choose to define as follows : ( 1 ) specific resistance of the body at the point , ( 2 ) specific resistance resistance of the element , ( 3 ) the sum of the resistances of all the elements hole resistance of the tube , we shall have current flowing along resistance of tube , or conductivity of flowincy along tube , which defines the conductivity as the reciprocal of the whole resistance .
Now ) any finite tube of flow into an infinite number of such elementary tubes , call the sum of the conductivities of the elementary tubes the whole of the finite tube , and call the reciprocal of this last the whole resistance of the finite tube .
We shall then have that the of the values for the elementary tubes whole resistance of the finite tube whole culTeut along it .
All this may , I think , be said to be in complete agreement with the theory , but it serves to call attention to the fact\mdash ; important in connection with the longitudinal effect mentioned in S79 above\mdash ; that anything which interferes with the ordinary lines of flow will alter the apparent resistance .
89 .
To return to our immediate ) , we are now at liberty to say the line integral of any term contributed to the riqht of eqclation ( 29 ) ' S50 , round a closed circuit implies an equal electro-motive force round the cn.ctllt in the or lnary sense .
Equations ( 22 ) and ( 22A ) are easily seen to follow .
Comparing , now , equations ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 22 ) ) ' awe see the results of the , and ( 22A ) , with ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) on p. 97 , vol. , ' Encyc .

MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL Thus the former theory explains thermoelectric effects satisfactorily .
But we shall see that we cannot suppose A zero .
Hence we must on the present theory suppose that the main thermoelectric effects are reversible , but that there are subsidiary irreversible ones that with the present means of experiment it would be practically impossible to disentangle from the former .
90 .
The detailed comparison between the two theories is most dearly made by means of the thermoelectric diagram .
From equation ( 22A ) we see that on the theory of irreversibility the thermoelectric er , instead of being .

THEORY OF The following results may be noted:\mdash ; No of experiments confined to of the electromotive forces resulting from differences of thejunctions of thermoelectric circuiis can distinguish betueen the two theories .
On the theory of reversibility the following statement is true ; on the theory of ersibility the contrary is true .
In a therrnoelectric circuit of two vnetcds , a current be across the junction in the same direction that of the that would be produced by heating the junction , the effect is absorption , and vice [ 'Heat , ' 1st ed. , S 192 ] .
In many cases this statement has been verified experimentally , and no one , I think , has ever asserted that he has obtained the contrary .
Hence the main thermoelectric effects cannot be explained on the theory of bility .
On the theory of takes the place of in the theory .
91 .
This last statement is of importance in connection with a difficulty purposely passed over till now .
By equation ( 23 ) S 82 it appears that enters into the expression for the stress unless be independent of the strain .
Thus tlJe stress depends on the electric history of the substance .
This involves fficulties of two kinds .
First it shows that in all bodies for which is not thus independent the stress would probably be widely different from what it is ordinarily assumed to be .
This , however , would not affect the pparen mechanical effect on a conductor as a whole since , as already noticed , that effect depends upon the stressjust outside the conductor , i. e. , the stress in the surrounding in which does not increase indefinitely .
But one think that its effects on the mutual behaviour of different parts of a conductor would have been observed .
The second difficulty is connected with equation ( 24 ) .
It might be thought a truism that should remain constant in a steady field .
But as with ( S84 ) this is not the case .
We saw in S75 that so long as any term which contrlbutes to contributes zero to and it produces no effect on the motion and strains of bodies , is , no mechanical effect whatever .
The conditions for a steady field , so far as stress is concerned , are , therefore , that and .
If then is the only term in containing , equation ( 24 ) gives for a steady field .
To see what be the approximate effect of this , let us assume to be a scalar ( P ) whatever be the strain , and let the scalal .
be a function of the temperature and : the sity of the body only .
Then and II .
: From the first of equations ( 25 ) it follows that the scalar must be constant throughout any single conductor ; and from the second , that it must be constant throughout any number of conductors in contact , and if the conductors are anywhere bounded by a dielectric , i. e. , , this constant value must be zero .
Hence with present assumptions must be zero everywhere in a steady field .
[ This is not quite accurate since if , regarded as a function of is a maximum or minimum , .
It does not seem hopeful to pursue this supposition howeyer .
] This presents no difficulty in ordinary cases , since and \mdash ; to drop the as no cessar \mdash ; would generally be very approximately at right angles in any case .
If , however , we contemplate such a case as the attempt by ordinary means to force a galvanic current and a stream of heat in the same direction through a conductor , some very curious consequences are involved .
The most obvious of them seem to be that both the heat and electric apparent conductivities would be largely altered .
That no such large alterations in these physical quantities have been observed I believe to be the case .
These difficulties may be wholly imaginaly .
If , which seems on other grounds most probable , is not even approximately a scalar when the body is strained , we should not be able to deduce that was even approximately zero .
In this case , the adjustments brought about in a steady field of the kind just contemplated by reason of the equations ( 25 ) , would probably be mainly strain adjustments that would not cause and to vary much , if at all , from parallelism .
These strains , of course , might very well have hitherto escaped detection .
These difficulties are , however , sufficiently serious to make it necessary to consider the results of assuming independent of the strain .
The most important of these results are easily seen to be ( 1 ) that , although the connections between the PELTIER effect and the elecbromotive forces in a circuit of different metals whose junctions are at different temperatures would on the theory of reversibility be the same as is usually supposed , yet there would on that theory , taken alone , be no THOMSON effect [ equation ( 19 ) ] , and ( 2 ) that there would be no thermoelectric effects in a circuit of a single metal whose various parts were variously stressed .
These two , then , would have to be explained on the theory of irreversibility , and no itative connection need be expected between the THOMSON effect and the main thermoelectric 92 .
These difficulties seem to me not to be confined to the particular form of heory developed in this paper .
For instance , there seems as much reason to suppose Professor J. J. THOMSON'S ( Applications , ' 1st ed. , S53 ) to be independent of the strain as the present P. And I may remark in passing that similar statements may be made with regard to the ( ibid. , S43 ) introduced to explain the HALL effect .
[ By S84 above , it is obvious that on the present theory it is impossible to explal ( the HALL effect by such a term owing to the results other than the HALL effect would ensue from the term .
] 93 .
Our chief conclusions , so far , may be thus summarised:\mdash ; THHiORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
( 1 .
) be assumed to be dependent upon , the theory of reversibility suffices to explain atl the known facts of thermoelectricity .
( 2 .
) If , there is some reason to believe , be independent of , the ?
electric effects must be on }theory of , but the THOMSON effecf and the thermoelectric effects observed in a circuit of metal differentlf stressed in different parts must be on the theory of .
In this case there no such connection between the THOMSON effect and other thermoelectric effects as is usually supposed .
On the present theory it is impossible to explain phenomena by the theory of reversibility .
94 .
There is little to be said with regard to the thermomagnetic phenomena themselves , as our knowledge of them is almost confined to what is expressed by equations ( 2 ) and ( 9A ) .
It is necessary to remark , however , that the of equation ( 2 ) may be\mdash ; probably is\mdash ; not the main cause of what been described in S79 above as the longitudinal effect , since an apparent longitudinal effect would be caused ( S88 above ) by any interference with the lines of flow of electricity , and by the variation in the resistance due to any cause .
More than one effect of hese kinds will be noticed below .
But , of course , the existence of and may inyolye results of a kind other than the1momagnetic , which are practically measurable .
Besides equations ( 2 ) and , and occur in equations to .
Equations ( 13A ) do not require notice , since in the present state of s , ccuracy of experimental of thermoelectric quantities the influence of and in these equations is negligible .
With regard to equations ( 16A ) to ( 1SA ) , we can trace approximately the of and in one important class of cases .
95 .
Suppose we have a plate of uniform thickness ( small ) in which a current is flowin placed in a strong uniform magnetic field .
On account of the current , of course , the uniformity will be disturbed , but only slightly if the strength is great enough .
Outside the plate ( except in certain conducting wires ) we assume that there is no current .
Hence by equation we see that at every point of the boundary of the plate . . .
( 26 ) .
Equation gives by equation ( 4 ) S5 for any portion of the plate ( 27 ) .
This is the form in which can be most easily discussed the effect of tion ( Let the region to which equation ( 27 ) refers be taken as a cylinder , one face of the cylinder being in one face of the plate , and the parallel face somewhere de fh MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL plate .
Since the plate is thin , we may suppose the faces of the cylinder large compared with the curved surface , and may , therefore , neglect the portion contributed to the integral of equation ( 27 ) by the curved lrface compared with the rest of the integral .
Now by equation ( 26 ) the part of the integral contributed by the face of the plate is zero .
Hence putting for we have , , at any point of the plate Si . . . . .
( 28 ) .
Assuming and to be scalars , this may be put in the form . . .
( 29 ) .
Now assuming , which will be at the boundary\mdash ; true , that is perpendicular to , we have Hence by equation ( 2 ) , .
Let us split this vector up into its components parallel to the three vectors , and .
For this purpose notice that since is perpendicular to ViKH \mdash ; KS iSKH iSiKH ) Thus ( 30 ) from which , by substituting for from equation ( 29 ) , we obtain [ XB SiKH ( 31 ) .
96 .
This transformation is not likely to give us clearer ideas of what takes place when a stream of heat is made to flow in the plate which is large compared with the THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
streams due to ordinary electric resistance and thermoelectric phenomena .
The original form of is more for that purpose .
We assume then that the only heat effects are due to purely electrical causes .
In this case , if the faces of the plate are thermally similar , we may assume that has opposite values at points situated symmetrically on opposite sides of the plane midway between the faces of the plate .
The effect of will be then merely to make the current stronger or weaker in the middle of the plate than near the faces , and , therefore , to increase the apparent resistance of the plate .
We have already seen that unless ( assumed invariably to be a scalar in this connection ) be independent of the strain , is zero , so that the whole expression on the of equation ( S1 ) is zero .
If , however , be independent of the strain , the term in VKH in equation ( 31 ) would indicate a HALL effect .
The presence of in this term , however , serves to show that probably this is not the true explanation of the HALL effect .
The HALL effect may be explained by saying that there is an electromotive force hVKH , where may be called the coefficient of the HALL effect .
It has been found experimentally that this coefficient is by no means independent of TH\mdash ; that , in fact , in certain cases it changes sign when a definite strength of magnetic field is reached .
The above work indicates how , on the present theory , we may seek to explain such an effect .
For this purpose it must be remembered that equations ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) are only true if is the only term in which involves H. 97 .
Let us now assume that the electric resistance is a function of , and let us incorporate in the term of thus depending upon H. We must add a to the former value of being a function ( of Class II .
of S9 ) of and H. For the sake of definiteness give .
the form are functions of the same classes as and respectively .
Thus , as can be easily seen , to get from we have merely to change and into , and or and respectively .
Equations ( 8A ) , ( 9A ) , , and ( 16A ) must now be changed to . . .
( 32 ) , bKSHcH . . . . . . .
( 33 ) , SXbKSHcH - ( 34 ) , cHSKbK .
( 35 ) .
Hence , in place of we now have Si cHSKbK ) ( 36 ) .
Assuming , to be all scalars , and putting , as is permissible in this case , instead of equation ( 29 ) we have MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL ( 37 ) , and in place of ( 31 ) , [ KB SiKH . . . .
( 38 ) which simplifies when is zero ( which it certainly approximately is in the experiments made to determine the coefficient of the HALL effect , whether be independent of or not ) to [ SiKH -VKH ] . . . . .
( 39 ) .
Owing to the term in on the right as ] as the term in on the left , there may be an apparent increase of resistance .
The term in shows that there will also be an increase \mdash ; the resistance .
The term in VKH shows that the present assumptions lead to a HALL effect , whose coefficient .
With regard to the new term SKbKSHcH in equation ( 34 ) , it should be noticed that since it is quadratic in , it would have no influence on the apparent THOMSON effect , but only upon the apparent resistance as measured by heat effects .
That we can explain the HALL effect on the present theory is of some interest , because , as remarked in S92 above , we cannot explain it on the present theory in the ordinary way .
Nor can we hope to explain it by the term - in [ equations ( 29 ) , S 50 , and ( 20 ) , S 35 ] for , whereas ) .
It should be noticed that the difficulties in the way of explaining the HALL effect by a term \mdash ; C'SCDH/ 2 do not apply to explaining the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarised light , since this is equally well explained by substituting for D. 98 .
One effect of still remains for consideration .
It is necessary to consider it if to show that it leads to no results large enough to be experimentally tested .
It also helps to show how the various interferences with the lines of flow , several times mentioned above , are mainly brought about .
In writing down equation ( 9A ) it was mentioned did not contain the.part of a due to .
We have indirectly taken account of the effect of in part , by the considerations just given in leading up to the explanation of the HALL effect .
We have not , however , thereby taken full account of .
To do t , his in the manner illustrated above , we should require to study the effect had in modifying the whole electromotive force instead of the part .
We proceed then , to a more general examination of the effect of the term , in E. We will now drop the suffix from a and , since we shall not suppose contain THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM .
except by reason of the term , so that of equation ( 35 ) now stands for the full value of and are arbitrary .
Let us , since it does not affect any physically measurable quantity , assume them both to be zero .
Since , if we considered an analogue in which stood for an electric current , would be the magnetic force due to the currents in a space containing no magnets .
This analogue will serve to give us a very fair general idea of the effect of \mdash ; a in E. Since [ equation ( 35 ) ] every term of contains be confined to conductors where there are conduction currents .
Thus , in the same conductor we shall have the " " real current\ldquo ; and the " " current of the analogue The current of the analogue may be disposed with reference to the real current in one of three ways .
It may be mainly parallel to the real current , or it may circulate lound the real current mainly at right angles to it , or it may circulate round it spirally .
In the first and third cases we see by the analogy that there would be an electromotive force due to a in the general field approximately parallel everywhere to the part of the magnetic force due to the real current .
In the conductor itself , then , the resulting electromotive force would cause the real current to move spirally , and would , efore , apparently increase the resistance .
In the second and third cases we see by the analogy that there would result effects due to the local state of affairs , so that where was large there the effect of a on would be large .
In a case of this sort we should have to examine further before we could say what the local effect would be .
It is easy to see that in the experiments for determining the quantities connected with the HALL and thermomagnetic effects , the second of the above cases very approximately represents the state of affairs .
For , by equation ( 35 ) , it is only in the plate , where or is very ] arge compared with the rest of the circuit , that will have a sensible value .
Hence there must be a strong local current of the analogue , that is , a current which does not go round the circuit parallel to the real current .
It follows that the main physical eflects of a are those that were considered in dealing with the HALL effect .
E. Contact Electromotive Force .
99 .
Our knowledge of this is not very accurate , but , besides the fact that contactforce certainly exists , and that it has been in numerous individual cases measured with fair accuracy , the following seems to stand out with considerable certa nty .
If the ( apparent ) electromotive force from one material , , to another , , when they are in contact be denoted by , then the equation ( 1 ) is true if all three materials are conductors , but is not true if they are not all c , onductors .
MR. A. McAULAy ON THE MATHEMATICAL This force cannot apparently be explained by any term in of the kind we have hitherto supposed to contain .
Suppose , then , to contain a where is of the same class as A or [ equations ( 5 ) , S81 .
] Thus is an intensity , and flux , gate of The ortion of contributed by this term is , or [ eq. ( 4 ) , S5 ] , Hence the effects of supposing to contain a term are identical with those of to contain a term So far as electric phenomena are concerned it is quite easy to see the effect of this rerm .
In place of equations ( 31 ) , S50 , and ( 2 ) , S57 , we shall have ( 2 ) , or , if ( 1 be a scalar , ( 3 ) .
100 .
Although this term involves a contact force it does 1rot explain the known facts , since , as can be easily seen , the contact force here obtained is such that equation ( 1 ) would be vari true .
We seem then to be driven to the conclusion that to explain contact force , cannot any longer be assumed to be zero .
Adopting the suggestion of Professor CRYSTAL , 'Encyc .
Brit 9th ed. , vol. 8 , p. 85 , we will assume there is no real contact force between conductors .
This simplification is not , of course , necessary ou the present theory , but the simpler the \mdash ; so long as they are not intrinsically improbable\mdash ; the better .
Professor CRYSTAL shows that the assumption serves to explain all the known facts , the apparent contact force between conductors being explained by the difference of their contact forces with one and the same dielectric .
We now assume that contains the where is of the same class as before , but now depends on and , and where of course the suffix has nothing to do with the linear vector function .
It is assumed that is zero for a surface of separation of two conductors .
In place of equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , we now have . . . . . .
( 4 ) ( 5 ) .
*It may be asked , Why make the differentiations act on as well as , why not assnme term to be ?
The answer is that this leads to a more complicated result , namely ( 1 ) , to ths same force as the term osen , ( 2 ) , to a term in , and ( 3 ) , to a stress which involves the space derivatives of .
It is best to assume , if possible , a term which involves what we know to be trus and nothing more .
Perhaps it would be better , as more general to suppose , to contain the term where is of the class as , and ' is not merely characteristic of the substanoe , but depends ou both the substances bounded , i.e. , where , in general , is not zero .
Equations ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) will still be true if we put a : THEORY OF ELECTRObfAGNETISM .
769 It might be thought that equation ( 4 ) could not be true in general unless was a scalar in general .
This , however , is not the case .
From equation ( 4 ) it certainly follows that , but this , by virtue of the dependence of on strain is merely an equation of condition satisfied by the strain .
The equation may indeed be written ( 6 ) , which is , of course , more general than equation ( 5 ) , since here is not assumed a scalar .
It may be noted that , so that the two conditions , and , are identical .
101 .
It should be remarked here that on the present theory the term just introduced would have no thermal effect in steady fields , and , therefore , no connection with the PELTIER effect .
( See S85 above .
) We have been obliged to suppose no longer zero .
Before discussing the modifications this entails in the general results above , the last application in the present paper of those results will be made .
This is the place where it would be proper to discuss electrolysis in connection with the present theory .
This I do not propose to do , mathematical machinery of this paper would require some important modifications to enable us to deal with such subjects as diffusion , the motion of the ions , \amp ; c. , because the subject is a very large one , and would , perhaps , unduly extend the length of the present paper .
F. The Transference of Energy through the Field .
102 .
On the present theory , in which the principle enunciated in equations ( 24 ) , ( 25 ) , S36 , required strong confirmation , it was necessary to show that it agreed in every particular with the generally accepted views as to frictional forces bein derivable from a dissipation function in Lord RAYLEIGH'S sense , and with the much more certainly established truths treated of in the theory of conduction of heat .
The only way to establish this last seemed to be to show that as a result of the principle there was a time flux of intrinsic energy , one term of which was what , in the theory of conduction of heat , is called the time flux of heat .
This led to the necessity of finding the time flux of intrinsic energy in general .
We are thus brought on to ground which has hitherto been regarded as belonging exclusively to Professor pointing \mdash ; the transference of through the field .
103 .
Let us now examine how far the results of the present theory are consistent with those of Professor POINTING .
Let be a flux such that . . .
( 1 ) , MR. A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL so that may be called the time flux of intrinsic energy .
By Proposition S10 , Hence we see by equation ( 25 ) , S 49 , that ( 2 ) .
Now , ( ' Phil. Trams 1884 , Part Ir .
, pp. 343 to 349 ) Professor POYNTING'S result expressed in similar notation would be ( calling the time flux of energy P ) .
( 3 ) .
It is scarcely necessary to remark that we have here generalised his by the insertion of the terms and have substitutedfor his what he means by it , namely , .
It might be thought at first that this is not quite what he means by since he incorporates in it terms depending on the motion of the body with reference to the lines of magnetic induction .
Remembering , however , that equation ( 6 ) , S60 , and the equation are identical , it will be seen that these terms have been here incorporated .
104 .
The direct interpretation of equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is , of course , videly different .
Let us see if they have the same physical significance , that is , whether they lead to the same rate of increase of intrinsic in any finite space .
For this purpose it must be asked whether or not is zero .
Now ( L\mdash ; P ) ( 4 ) .
Hence ) , or by equation ( 3 ) , S5 , ( 5 ) , where the line integralt is to be taken over all lines of discontinuity on the true * I only say\mdash ; generalised his expression\mdash ; since some such terms as have been added in the text would , on Professor POYNTING'S own theory , be included in the vector , defined by equation ( 1 ) , as the time flux of intrinsic energy .
The result of the present paper is , however , in all strictness much more general than his , since it has not other things been assumed that all the bodies in spacs are isotropic with reference to specific inductive capacity , resistance , magnetic permeability .
It may be well to notice that by the conventions of S5 , above , if the closed curve be regarded as bounding , not the regions of the true boundary , but the part of the surface of discontinuity in the region of space under consideration , the sign of the line integral must be changed .
THEORY OF ELECTRObfAGNETISM .
boundary of the region considered , that is , over the trace 011 that surface of surfaces of discontinuity .
The element is , of course , taken twice , namely , once for each of the two regions of the true boundary which it bounds .
Since is in the surface of discontinuity , and the component of parallel to that surface is not discontinuous , we see that .
Hence the part contributed by to the line integral may be written or . . .
( 6 ) .
If then is continuous , the line integral is zero .
It has already appeared [ equation ( 2 ) , S57 ] that if is everywhere zero this is the case .
Hence , less l exist , the physical results of supposing to be the time flux of intrinsic energy are identical with those of supposing L. If exist , we have at present no right to say that on the present theory may be taken as the time flux ; but in S111 , below , this will be proved .
The conclusion is then that , to explain the rate of variation of energy , Professor flux must be supplemented by a finite flux along surfaces of discontinuity in the potential , where . . . . .
( 7 ) .
[ In verifying the sign of this expression attention must be paid to the caution in the last foot-note .
] This of course is rather an unnatural , though by no means absurd , result , and therefore I think it better to regard as , more probably than , repre- senting the true time flux of intrinsic energy .
Another reason for preferring to is that for a field at rest , i.e. , such that and are everywhere zero , is zero , whereas In now sting Professor POYNTING'S result with that of the present paper , we will suppose continuous .
105 .
Very after the first publi , cation of Professor paper , Professor J. J. THOMSON in criticising it remarked ( ' B. A. Reports , ' 1885 , p. 151 ) .
' ' This [ Professor POYNTING'S ] interpretation of the expression for the variation in the energy seems open to question .
In the first place it would seem impossible , a priori , to determine the way in which the energy flows from one part of the field to another by merely differentiating a general expression for the energy in any reglon , with respect to the time , without any knowledge of the mechanism which produces phenomena which occur in the electromagnetic field ; for although we can , by means of HAMILTON'S or LAGRANGE'S equations , deduce from the expresslon for the energy the forces present in any dynamical system , and therefore the way in which the energy will move , yet for this purpose we require the energy to be express terms of the coordinates fixing the system , and it will not do to take any expression which happens to be equal to it .
The problern of finding the way which the energy is transmitted in a system whose mechanism is unknown , seems to an MR. , McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL indeterminate one ; thus , for example , if the energy inside a closed surface remains constant we cannot , unless we know the mechanism of the system , tell whether this is because there is no flow of energy either into or out of the surface , or because as much flows in as flows out .
The reason for this difference between what we should expect and the result obtained in this paper is not far to seek He then goes on to point how , so far from being necessarily the time flux of energy , where is any vector , such that at surfaces of discontinuity , might equally well be taken as the time flux of energy .
It so happens that ( assuming continuous ) \mdash ; is such a vector , so that the difference 1oetween the result arrived at in this paper and Professor POYNTING'S is just such a case as Professor warned us to expect .
We cannot then say that either or is the time flux of energy , but only that if we assume either the or the other ( being supplemented with ) to be the flux , the real changes of trinsic energy will be accounted for .
106 .
Notwithstanding Professor THOMSON'S warning , many subsequent writers seem to have taken Professor POyNTING'S theories for established facts .
The following statement of Professor POINTING especially seems to have grown to be accepted almost universally as a commonplace truth [ ' Phil. Trans 1884 , Part II .
, p. ] " " I think it is necessary that we should realise thoroughly , that if we accept MAXWELL'S theory of energy residing in the medium , we must no longer consider a current as conveying energy along the conductor .
A current in a conductor is rather to be regarded as consisting essentially of a convergence of electric and etic energy from the medium upon the conductor , and its transformation there into other forms Now , if we take as the true time flux of energy , we see that one way in which we must a current is precisely the way Professor TING denies us , namely , " " as something conveying energy along the conductor In from the term in , we see that in.this respect , as in so many others , a current and the potential are the exact analogue of a liquid current and its pressure .
Without doubt , the view that is the true flux is simpler for steady fields than the view that is .
This statement is not so obvious\mdash ; perhaps on the whole not \mdash ; for varying fields .
It is easy to contrast in detail the two views in all the particular cases Prcfessor POyNIING considers .
This may , therefore , be omitted here .
