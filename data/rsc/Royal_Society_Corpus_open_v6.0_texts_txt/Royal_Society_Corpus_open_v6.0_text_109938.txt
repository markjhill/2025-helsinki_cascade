] In this paper the author describes a delicate transparent membrane , covering the external surface of the retina , and united to it by cellular substance and vessels .
Its appearance varies in the different classes of animals , and at different ages .
In young animals it is transparent and tender ; but in the adult firm , and stained by the pigment .
In fishes , it has been described by Haller and Cuvier as the medullary layer of the retina ; but the author thinks incorrectlv , since it presents no character of nervous structure , and the retina remains perfect before it .
The aulthor concludes this com1.17 munication by describing his mode of examining delicate anatomical structures:-He procures a hollow sphere of glass , between two and three inches in diameter , of which one fourth is cut off at the open part , and the edges ground so as to fit upon a plate of glass to which the object is attached and immersed in water ; the sphere is then filled with water , and inverted over the object upon the plate .
The whole being withdrawn from the basin the object may be examined , and the portion of the sphere filled with water furnishes a convenient magnifying power .
