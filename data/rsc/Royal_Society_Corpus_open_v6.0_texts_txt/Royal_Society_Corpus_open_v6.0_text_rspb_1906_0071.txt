] The following account has reference to the pursuance of the inquiry into the nature of the process whereby the fats are hydrolysed under the influence of lipase* ; the experiments have been made in the hope of discovering an explanation of the selective power which the enzyme undoubtedly displays , as it promotes by preference the hydrolysis of ethereal salts of the higher fatty acids such as are present in the natural fats .
The active material used , as a rule , has been the finely ground air-dried residue which is left on depriving crushed castor oil seed of oil by means of ether ; although but slightly active towards ethereal salts other than fats , it is easily prepared of uniform quality and does not soon deteriorate when kept .
In all cases , the effect produced in blank control experiments is allowed for .
As a rule hydrolysis took place at the temperature of the laboratory .
Operating with what appear to have been highly active materials , Kastle and Loevenhartf were able by means of hepatic and pancreatic lipase to effect the hydrolysis of several ethereal salts derived from the lowest terms of the acetic series of acids .
The results they obtained in two series of experiments are as follows , the figures representing the percentage amount of salt hydrolysed after 15 minutes at 40 ' :\#151 ; Ethylic formate . .

3 with any of the salts .
They came to the conclusion that the higher the molecular weight of the acid , the more readily is its ethylic salt hydrolysed by lipase .
Kicinus lipase , at least in the form in which we have used it , has a very slight action on ethylic acetate , but gradually hydrolyses the butyrate .
Alone it produces little or no effect , mixtures of 2 grammes of seed residue , 3 c.c. ethylic butyrate and 200 c.c. water requiring for neutralisation at the end of 21 hours only 0*7 c.c. , after 45 hours 1 c.c. and after 117 hours T75 c.c. of normal alkali .
In presence of dilute N/ 5 acetic acid , action takes place slowly , as shown in the following table\#151 ; in which the values represent the number of cubic centimetres of normal alkali neutralised:\#151 ; A. 2 grs. seed residue .

Dr. Nicloux , in drawing attention to his work on Eicinus Lipase , * has stated that the cytoplasm separated from castor oil seed " acts on fat in the same way as an enzyme and follows all the laws of enzyme action " ; yet he concludes , that , " Nevertheless the active substance of which cytoplasm is but probably the support is not an enzyme ; this substance " \#151 ; which he proposes to call lipaseidine\#151 ; " is destroyed by water as soon as it is no longer-protected by fats .
" We cannot help thinking that this conclusion is illogical and that the destruction of the lipase prepared by Nicloux is probably to be traced to an admixed proteoclastic enzyme rather than to water .
The substance in question was obtained by expressing the oil from the seed , then centri-fugalising the oil to separate the suspended solid matter and washing this latter free from oil with carbon bisulphide .
It was intensely active as a lipoclast .
The material we have used , though free from oil , is but slightly affected by water or dilute acids .
After such treatment , however , it loses to a considerable extent the property of causing oil to form an emulsion with water ; * Ibid. , B , 1906 , vol. 77 , p. 454 .

] we are inclined to attribute its inferior activity principally to this effect .
Our results are as follows:\#151 ; 0-3 gramme of seed residue was digested with 3 c.c. of water during the time stated .
5 grammes of castor oil and 3 c.c. 1ST/ 5 acetic acid were then added ; the mixture , having been well shaken , was then maintained during 21 hours at 25 ' .

Several experiments were made in which a large excess of water was taken and the mixture shaken in the shaking machine in order to reduce to a minimum the decrease in the amount of fat hydrolysed due to the differences in the character of the emulsion .
0*3 gramme of seed residue and 0-4 c.c. of toluene was allowed to remain in contact with ( a ) 10 c.c. acetic acid and 10 e.c. water , ( b ) 20 c.c. water , during the time stated ; 5 grammes castor oil was then added and to ( a ) 10 c.c. water and to ( b ) 10 c.c. acetic acid , and the mixtures were shaken during 5 hours at 15 ' to 17 ' .

1*7 According to Nicloux , glycerol retards the hydrolysis .
Our experiments indicate that up to 25 per cent , glycerol has little , if any , influence ; in larger proportion , it certainly retards hydrolysis .
All observers agree that alcohol hinders the change : our experiments show that its influence is approximately proportional to the amount which is present .
The ethereal salts which are hydrolysed under the influence of lipase are all compounds of the type R'.CO .
OX ' .
Since R ' and X ' may be varied within wide limits , it cannot well be supposed that the selective action of the enzyme is exercised with reference either to R ' or X ' : consequently the controlling influence must be attributed to the carboxyl radicle ( CO. O ) ; the enzyme must be so constituted that it can " fit itself to this group .
" The problem to be solved is\#151 ; why should ethereal salts derived from the lower terms of the acetic series be so much less readily hydrolysed than the higher ?
The differences in stability do not account for the differences in behaviour of homologous salts ; in fact , ordinary hydrolytic agents appear to-act more readily on the lower terms .
Xor can the difference be attributed to the destruction of the enzyme by the acid which is liberated from the salt , as this destructive effect can be avoided by diluting the solutions k\gt ; the necessary extent .
Our experiments have led us to form the provisional hypothesis that the hydrolysis of the ethereal salt by lipase involves the direct association of the-enzyme with the carboxyl centre and that such association may be prevented by the " hydration " of this centre : consequently , that those salts which ar\amp ; the more attractive of water will be the less readily hydrolysed .
The facts generally seem to be in accordance with this view , inasmuch as the solubility in water of ethereal salts diminishes as the series is ascended ; salts such as ethylic formate and acetate undoubtedly tend to form hydrates ( hydrols ) in solution , such as CH3.CO .

\#151 ; The fact that amylic acetate , which is far less soluble in water than ethylic acetate , is more susceptible to lipase is an interesting confirmation of the explanation given above .
As it appeared possible that the differences in the rates at which different salts were hydrolysed might be due to the poisoning of the enzyme , the finely ground seed residue was mixed with the ethereal salt and the mixture shaken during an hour ; the solid was then filtered off , washed with ether VOL. lxxviii.\#151 ; b. 2 G 382 Prof. H.

A comparative examination of the enzyme derived from various sources will also be undertaken , both in order to ascertain whether only one form of lipase exists and to obtain the hydrolyst in a really suitable form for the quantitative study of its effects .
Should the explanation we have advanced be justified , ethereal salts will be a material at least as valuable as that afforded by the carbohydrates for the comparative study of enzymes and acids as hydrolytic agents .

Appendix .
( August 14 , 1906 .
) Since the foregoing account was written , a large number of experiments have been made with the object of contrasting animal lipase with vegetable lipase .
We have been led gradually to recognise that in the case of the former especially , if an effective comparison is to be made between ethereal salts , it is an essential condition of success that the substances compared be in solution .
We were led to this conclusion in the first place by observing in certain experiments , in which the materials were only partially dissolved , that ethylic propionate was more acted upon than was either the acetate or butyrate ; but when solutions of equivalent quantities of the three salts were acted upon by liver lipase , the acetate proved to be the most and the butyrate the least stable .
We need scarcely point out that this circumstance renders a strict comparison of ethereal salts which are only very slightly soluble in water a difficult matter ; moreover , it must be taken into consideration in connection with our earlier experiments .
Probably it is on this account also that the liquid expressed both from the liver and the pancreas acts so slowly and to so slight an extent on natural fats and oils .
With these agents , however , it appears to be impossible to secure anything approaching to the complete emulsification of fats which is readily effected by the residue of castor oil seeds ; indeed , at present we are inclined to attribute the extraordinary activity of the seed residue to its emulsifying power rather than to any inherent superiority of the enzyme as a lipoclast ; but it should be mentioned that any treatment which renders the enzyme in the seed residue inactive also destroys the emulsifying power of the material.* All attempts which we have made to overcome the difficulty referred to by dissolving the fat or oil in neutral liquids such as toluene or ether and then violently agitating the solution with liver juice have proved unsuccessful\#151 ; such treatment having served only to destroy the enzyme .
In confirmation of the statement already made with reference to the remarkable and , as we believe , significant difference in behaviour of the allied salts , ethylic succinate , malate and tartrate , the following results may be quoted which were obtained by digesting solutions of equivalent quantities of the three compounds with liver lipase .
The figures represent the quantity of alkali required to neutralise the liberated acid ; at the end of the experiment the succinate was practically all hydrolysed :\#151 ; * It is not improbable that the increased activity of pancreatic juice ( from a Pawlow fistula ) in presence of bile salts , to which Magnus has recently called attention ( ' Zeits .
Physiol. Oliein .
, ' 1906 , vol. 48 , p. 376 ) , is due to the promotion of emulsification by the salt .

The Action of Plants on a Photographic Plate the Dark .

] It has been shown in former papers that wood has the property of acting in the dark on a photographic plate , when placed in contact or in proximity to it .
Not only does wood act in this way , but leaves , seeds , roots , bulbs , and , in fact , with only few exceptions , all vegetable substances act in a similar way .
The more important bodies which are without this property are starch , cellulose , gum , sugar , pith , and pollen .
To obtain this action on a plate it is necessary that the body used be tolerably dry , or else the moisture contained in it will act on the gelatine of the photographic plate and destroy the picture .
The time necessary for the exposure to the plate varies from a few minutes to 18 hours or more .
To quicken the action , heat may be applied , but the temperature must not be above 55 ' C. , nor the time of exposure , under ordinary circumstances , longer than 18 hours , or the photographic film will be injured .
Any ordinary rapid photographic plate may be used , and its development is exactly the same as that of an ordinary picture .
The best and most general method of drying vegetable substances before exposing them to the photographic plate is to place them between pure white blotting paper and subject them to considerable pressure , say from 1 to 5 or 6 tons per square inch .
This process has also the advantage of giving a second picture , for it is found that the liquid which has been expressed and absorbed by the blotting paper is capable of acting on a photographic plate , and that it gives a good representation of the plant from which it came ( Plate 19 , fig. 1 , an oak leaf ) .
Since different woods are capable of 'acting on a photographic plate it was to be expected that leaves , stems , flowers would do the same .
