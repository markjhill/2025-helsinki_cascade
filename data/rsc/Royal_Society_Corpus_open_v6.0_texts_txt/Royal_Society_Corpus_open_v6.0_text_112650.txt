( Abstract .
) These experiments are a continuation of those described in a paper read February 22 , 1866 , with some modifications in the apparatus employed which render the comparison between torsion and flexure more direct .
The amount of torsion or flexure produced by subjecting a cylindrical rod to a uniform couple throughout its whole length , is measured by means of two mirrors clamped to the rod near its ends , in which , by the aid of two telescopes , the reflexions of a scale overhead are seen and the displacements read off .
One end of the rod is fixed , and a couple ( of torsion and flexure alternately ) is applied to the other end .
Three rods , of glass , brass , and steel , were experimented on , and the results obtained were as follows-M , n , and I denoting the resistances ( in kilogrammes per square millimetre ) to linear extension , shearing , and cubical compression respectively , and odenoting the ratio of lateral contraction to longitudinal extension : Glass .
