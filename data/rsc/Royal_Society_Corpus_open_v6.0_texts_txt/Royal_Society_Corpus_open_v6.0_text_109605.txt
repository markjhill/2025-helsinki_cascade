] The infant here treated of died at the age of ten days , during which period nothing particular was remarked , except that the skin exhibited the blue colour so common in cases of imperfect pulmonary circulation .
Upon opening the body , all the viscera were found in the natural state , except the heart , which exhibited the following remarkable structure : Externally , only one auricle could be perceived , into which the pulmonary veins and venwe cavae entered in the usual manner .
The pulmonary artery was wanting , and the body of the heart had but one ventricle , which was separated from the auricle by tendinous valves , and opened into the aorta .
The auricle was also single , and had a narrow muscular band , which crossed the ostium venosum , in the place of the septum .
The aorta sent off an artery from the situation of the ductus arteriosus : this o artery was divided into two branches , to supply the lungs .
These vessels were of small diameter .
The pulmonary veins were four in number ; but the area of these , and that of the vessel which acted as the pulmonary artery , did not exceed half the usual dimensions .
The child , while alive , was seen by Dr. Conmbe , who did not observe that its respiration , temperature , or muscular action , were materially affected .
