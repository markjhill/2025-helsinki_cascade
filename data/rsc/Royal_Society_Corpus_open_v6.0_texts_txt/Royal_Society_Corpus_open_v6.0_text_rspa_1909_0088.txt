148 Electric Conductivity , etc. , of Solutions of Hydrogen Fluoride .
definite existence in solution , and that with slight increase in dilution this dissociates into simpler molecules .
Second Break , \#151 ; If we consider the specific-conductivity curve , we find that from 0 to 30 per cent , it is a straight line .
The curve then dips , the dip ending at about 53 per cent. , where there is a point of inflection .
From this point the curve is parabolic until it reaches about 88 per cent. The concluding portion has already been discussed .
Turning to the molecular curve , we find the point of inflection clearly marked .
It is even more clearly marked upon the dotted curve , the meaning of which has been explained .
In each of these the point is at about 53 per cent , of hydrogen fluoride , a percentage which corresponds to the formula HF .
H20 ( HF = 52*6 per cent. ) .
We thus conclude that this hydrate has a definite existence in solution .
The density determinations are not of the same degree of accuracy as the conductivity measurements , and they are much fewer in number .
The curves are , however , very similar and the density curve gives corroborative evidence of a break or point of inflection at about 53 per cent. The break at 91 per cent , is not shown , owing to the paucity of measurements .
