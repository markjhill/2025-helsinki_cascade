Part I.\#151 ; General .
Six years ago Prof. Dixon and I began a research with the object of determining directly the weight of chlorine which combines with the unit weight of hydrogen .
Our method was to burn a jet of hydrogen in an atmosphere of chlorine ; hydrogen being stored and weighed in palladium , the chlorine being condensed and weighed as liquid .
The figure we obtained for the combining weight of chlorine was appreciably higher than that found indirectly by Stas , and still higher than that approved by the International Committee on Atomic Weights .
While this research was in progress , other determinations had been made bearing on the relative weights of silver , chlorine and nitrogen , so that some modification in the accepted values of one or more of these elements appeared inevitable .
The direct " joining up " of the two ends of the chain connecting hydrogen with chlorine thus became a matter of immediate importance .
Since the method of burning one gas in an atmosphere of the other had been proved to be accurate within fairly narrow limits , I was encouraged to continue the investigation , and to modify the apparatus with a view to eliminate some of the possible sources of error in the former series of experiments .
The most important source of error lies in the weighing of the hydrogen .
To diminish this error the weight of hydrogen employed was doubled ; and since Prof. Dixon and I found , when water was used to condense the hydrogen chloride formed in the flame , that some of the water vapour was decomposed by the free chlorine , I avoided this by burning a jet of chlorine in dry hydrogen , condensing the hydrogen chloride as it was formed in a tube dipped into liquid air .
In some of the experiments the hydrogen chloride has been weighed .
My experiments ( concluded in 1907 ) agree closely with the results previously obtained in 1905 .
The method employed was briefly as follows :\#151 ; Hydrogen , made by the electrolysis of barium hydrate solution and dried by potash and phosphorus pentoxide , was occluded and weighed in palladium contained in a VOL. CCIX.\#151 ; A 441 .
B 28.10.08 i\gt ; H. edWaeB c. eBgaH on the atomic Weight of chloeinE ; boro-silicate glass bulb : the chlorine , prepared by electrolysing fused silver chloride in a Jena glass vessel , was weighed as a liquid in a thick-walled boro-silicate glass bulb .
These bulbs were attached to a quartz combustion vessel , which was also connected with a quartz tube and with a steel bomb and a pump .
After a thorough evacuation of the whole apparatus , the combustion vessel was filled with hydrogen from the heated palladium bulb , and the chlorine was ignited by a spark at the tip of a quartz jet and continued to burn in the atmosphere of hydrogen , with a fine needle-shaped flame , until nearly all the chlorine weighed had been burnt .
The hydrogen chloride , immediately after its formation in the flame , was condensed as a snow-white solid by liquid air surrounding a limb of the combustion vessel ; and a little chlorine , which had escaped burning , was also solidified .
At the end of the combustion , the residual gas in the combustion vessel was extracted by the pump and subsequently analysed ; it proved to be practically pure hydrogen .
Then the snow-white hydrogen chloride was allowed to pass through a quartz tube filled with mercury vapour , and the purified gas was condensed in a steel bomb immersed in liquid air .
It was successfully weighed in three experiments ; in two other experiments the gas was absorbed by water and weighed as aqueous acid .
The balance was made specially for this work by Oertling .
Each piece of apparatus weighed was tared with another of the same material and of very nearly equal volume and weight , and the small weights used in the weighings were reduced to a vacuum standard .
Below are set out the corrected weights of hydrogen and chlorine burnt in eight experiments and the weights of hydrogen chloride caught in five .

DR. EDWARD C. EDGAR ON THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF CHLORINE .
Dixon and Edgar , burning hydrogen in chlorine , found the equivalent of chlorine to be 35*463 \#177 ; 0*0019 from their nine experiments .
The concordance of the two sets of experiments is thus exceedingly close , and the number 35'462 may be taken as representing the result of the whole work .
On the other hand , Noyes and Weber# have recently effected a complete quantitative synthesis of hydrogen chloride by passing a known weight of hydrogen over weighed potassium chlorplatinate , noting the loss in weight of the salt , and condensing and weighing in water the hydrogen chloride formed .
The mean number they have thus obtained for the atomic weight of chlorine is 35*452 \#177 ; 0*0008 ( LI = 1*00762 ) .
In view of the promised recalculation of the Atomic Weights by the International Committee , I have not attempted to correlate my results with the recent determinations of silver , nitrogen and chlorine .
The inception of this work is due to Prof. Dixon , and I gladly take this opportunity of thanking him for the searching , yet kindly , criticism to which he has subjected these experiments .
To the Government Grant Committee I am indebted for two grants , which have largely covered the cost of the apparatus employed .
Part II.\#151 ; Details of Experiments .
f. Preparation of Hydrogen.\#151 ; The preparation of hydrogen and its occlusion in palladium have been fully described in the previous paper , f The only alterations I introduced in the arrangement of the apparatus were these :\#151 ; Four phosphorus pentoxide drying tubes instead of three were used , and a water reservoir was attached to one arm of the electrolysis vessel .
The whole apparatus , including the bulb containing palladium , was made of boro-silicate glass .
In the preparation of the hydrogen , the gas passed through two U tubes containing platinised pumice , kept at 400 ' C. , instead of 220 ' C. , to remove any oxygen diffusing from the -1- electrode .
The purity of the hydrogen is evidenced by the fact that the residual gases from the combustion of all the hydrogen\#151 ; about 15^ grammes\#151 ; burnt in my eight experiments and of the corresponding weight of chlorine yielded less than half a cubic centimetre of nitrogen .
If it be assumed that all this nitrogen came from the hydrogenised palladium bulb ( which is not likely ) , the maximum weight of nitrogen present in the hydrogen was 1 part in 25,000 .
2 .
The Palladium Bulb.\#151 ; The palladium bulb , of which a sketch is given in fig. I , differed little from that described in the former paper .
It was made of boro-silicate glass , and terminated , not in a jet , but in the inner portion of a ground joint .

The bulb contained over 600 grammes of palladium , in which about 2^ grammes of hydrogen were stored in each experiment .
To Messrs. Johnson and Matthey my thanks are due for lending me 400 grammes of palladium .
3 .
Preparation of Chlorine.\#151 ; The details of the preparation of chlorine by electrolysing fused silver chloride are given fully on pp. 177-180 of Dixon and Edgar 's paper.* The only alteration I made in these experiments was to substitute boro-silicate glass for soft glass as the material for the various connecting tubes .
As before , the purity of the gas was shown by its complete absorption by pure , dry mercury .
4 .
The Chlorine Bulb.\#151 ; The bulb , in which chlorine was condensed as a solid by liquid air , was made of boro-silicate glass ; a sketch of the apparatus is given in fig. 2 .
The only difference to be noted between the apparatus I used and that described in the former paper is that mine terminated in a quartz jet F connected by a ground joint with the delivery tube .
The " reversed " tap ( e , fig. 2 ) had proved so trustworthy in controlling the exit of * 'Phil .

chlorine under pressure in the former experiments that it was employed unhesitatingly in these .
The weights of chlorine condensed in each experiment varied between 70 and 80 grammes .
5 .
The Method of Weighing.\#151 ; For the various weighings 1 used a short-armed balance made specially for this work by Oertling .
Even in weighing the steel bomb ( weighing considerably over 1000 grammes ) the concordance of individual weighings showed that their mean could be relied on to 0'0001 gramme .
Each piece of apparatus weighed was counterpoised by another of the same material , and of very nearly the same volume and weight .
The weights employed , though they had been standardised for the previous work , were carefully re-standardised for this ; but the variations found were too insignificant to affect results calculated from the older values .
The details of the method of weighing are given in full in the former paper .
It may be noted here that the variations in volume of the palladium bulb , caused by the differences in sealing off the thick-walled capillary tube , were small .
In all the experiments the bulb and its counterpoise differed so little in volume that , though the density of the air in some of the determinations altered appreciably between the first and second weighings of the bulb , in no case was it found necessary to apply a correction to the apparent weight .
6 .
The Combustion Apparatus.\#151 ; The chlorine was burnt in the quartz combustion vessel A ( shown in fig. 3 , and , on a larger scale , in fig. 4 ) , a prominent feature of t tc pump which was the dependent vertical limb B in which hydrogen chloride could be condensed .
The vessel had a capacity of 350 c.c. and was fitted with five ground quartz tubulures .
Into the two small tubulures C and Cx ( shown both in fig. 3 and fig. 4 ) were fitted two platinum wires D and sheathed in glass except for their extreme tips ; these sheaths were ground into the tubulures and the joints protected by caps containing mercury .
By passing sparks between the tips of the wires , the chlorine , from the chlorine condensation bulb E ( fig. 3 ) , could be ignited easily at the tip of the quartz jet F. The bulb E and the palladium bulb L were connected with A by the ground tubulures J and K respectively .
7 .
The Evacuation Apparatus.\#151 ; To the tubulure M was attached , by a ground joint , the evacuation apparatus .
This consisted of a quartz tube Q ( shown in fig. 3 t)R .

and , on a larger scale , in fig. 5 ) in which mercury could be heated to absorb chlorine , B , a small spiral condenser , X , a nickel-plated steel tube in which to condense the hydrogen chloride , and side tubes leading to two manometers , P and T , and to two Sprengel pumps .
In order to weigh the chlorine condenser separately , two taps , and were inserted , and ground-glass joints fitted at N and S. The ground-glass joint S led to the apparatus in which hydrogen chloride was condensed and weighed .
In six experiments this was a weighed nickel-plated steel bomb , consisting of a cylindrical steel tube X ( fig. 6 ) , connected by a length of flexible copper tubing with a screw valve W. The bomb was connected to the rest of the apparatus by the joint Y\#151 ; a joint between glass and steel cemented by solid phosphoric acid .
In two other experiments the hydrogen chloride was absorbed and weighed in water .
Fig. 7 is a sketch of the apparatus used .
Y was a boro-silicate glass bulb ( over 200 c.c. in capacity ) , fused to which was a tap y and a phosphorus pentoxide tube to absorb water vapour .
Z was a thick-walled capillary tube in which hydrogen chloride could be condensed by liquid air .
A tap z closed the apparatus .
Metaphosphoric acid was used as a lubricant on all the taps and ground joints .
It is somewhat troublesome to spread evenly on a glass surface , hut it has none of the disadvantages of organic lubricants .
8 .
Method of carrying out the Combustion and Condensation.\#151 ; When the palladium bulb , the liquid chlorine bulb , the chlorine condenser , and the hydrogen chloride condenser had been weighed , the different parts of the combustion and condensation apparatus were fitted together .
Then the pumps , fitted with McLeod gauges , were set working so as to evacuate the combustion vessel A ( fig. 3 ) through the connecting tube m and the rest of the apparatus through t. Since the quartz tube Q and the steel bomb X had been previously evacuated prior to weighing , it was only necessary to evacuate the small portion between Y and r. So as to facilitate the removal of traces of nitrogen , most of the glass apparatus was heated by the flame of a Bunsen burner .
When the pressure had fallen as low as some thousandths of a millimetre of mercury , the now vacuous combustion vessel was isolated from the pump by closing a tap , and the lower end of the vertical limb B was immersed in liquid air .
The liquid chlorine bulb E was packed into a freezing mixture of calcium chloride and ice , in which it was kept during the combustion .
The palladium bulb L , enclosed in an asbestos-lined copper box , was gradually raised z to 250 ' C. Then hydrogen was cautiously admitted through the tap l until the pressure shown by the manometer P was nearly atmospheric , at which point l was temporarily closed .
The glass cul-de-sac H was broken by lifting the small piece of steel rod G , imbedded in glass , by means of an electromagnet , and allowing it to drop .
Since the temperature of the liquid chlorine was about \#151 ; 25 ' C. , the pressure on the reversed tap e was rather more than atmospheric .
The ignition of chlorine at the tip of the quartz jet F was brought about by cautiously turning the tap e so as to admit chlorine to F , at the same time rapidly passing sparks between the platinum tips until the gas had lit .
Chlorine burns in dry hydrogen with a fine needle-shaped flame .
In daylight this cannot easily be seen ; the combustion therefore was carried out in a dark room .
The only part of the combustion vessel A heated by the burnt gases was the end immediately opposite the flame ; during the combustion this was continuously cooled by a rapid stream of water .
The atmosphere of hydrogen was continually renewed from L , while the tap controlled the admission of chlorine to the jet .
The elongation of the chlorine flame showed when the atmosphere was failing , but the readings of the manometer P were chiefly relied on in following the changes of pressure of the hydrogen .
During the combustion the endeavour was made so to regulate the admission of hydrogen as to keep it at a pressure just below atmospheric , but more often than not the attempt failed , owing to the rapid rate at which the gases burnt and the small size of the combustion vessel .
If the flame went out , the hydrogen atmosphere had to be restored and the chlorine re-lit by a spark , but this seldom occurred during the experiments .
The hydrogen chloride , immediately after its formation in the flame , was condensed as a pure white solid by the liquid air surrounding the lower end of the vertical limb B ; some chlorine , too , which had escaped burning in the flame , was condensed along with the hydrogen chloride .
As the solid accumulated , the liquid-air vessel was gradually raised so that , at the end of the combustion , nearly the whole of B was immersed in liquid air .
The combustion was continued until only a few grammes of liquid chlorine were left in E , when the tap l of the palladium bulb was finally closed and L allowed to cool .
The flame was now made very small .
As the atmosphere became rarefied , the flame became more and more attenuated until , just before it went out , e was finally closed .
The combustion , the average duration of which was over four hours , was then at an end .
Then the residual gases in the vessel were sucked out by the pump through m , collected and subsequently analysed .
The vapour pressures of solid hydrogen chloride and solid chlorine at the temperature of liquid air were so exceedingly small that none could be detected in the gases pumped out .
In the gas analysis it was assumed that both these gases were absent .
Even in the highest vacuum obtainable under DR. EDWARD C. EDGAR ON THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF CHLORINE .
the prevailing conditions , some hydrogen must still have adhered to the walls of the quartz vessel A ; but preliminary experiments showed the amount could not have been greater than 1 part in 55,000 of the hydrogen used .
If a correction could be applied for this small weight of gas , it would have the effect of raising slightly the atomic weight of chlorine .
The Sprengel pump fastened to m was now separated by fusion from the apparatus , and the tap p was closed so as to isolate the mercury in the manometer from subsequent contact with hydrogen chloride and chlorine .
The next series of operations was to evaporate the snow-white hydrogen chloride in B and to condense it in the bomb immersed in liquid air .
The successful accomplishment of this required very careful manipulation , the details of which were only learnt in the light of many failures .
The first step was to warm gently the mercury in the quartz test tube Q so as to fill the chlorine condenser with mercury vapour .
To prevent its diffusion into the bomb the coil It was surrounded by a freezing mixture of solid carbon dioxide and ether .
The steel tube X was now partially immersed in liquid air ; the taps n and r and the screw valve W were opened ; and the evaporation of the solid hydrogen chloride was commenced by slowly lowering the liquid air surrounding the limb B. The solid gradually evaporated into the combustion vessel , whence the gas passed on to the chlorine absorption apparatus .
Here all traces of chlorine combined with mercury vapour and condensed as mercuric chloride .
That the absorption of chlorine was complete was shown 6onclusively by the bright surface of mercury in the broad manometer tube T remaining untarnished ast the end of the condensation .
It was found , in preliminary experiments under similar conditions , that no weighable amount of mercury vapour could diffuse backwards out of Q. The purified hydrogen chloride , after its passage through Q , passed on to the steel tube X and there condensed .
By repeated trials it was found possible so to lower the bomb into liquid air as to effect the condensation at a pressure never exceeding two-thirds of an atmosphere .
The condensation took over four hours .
When it was complete , the taps n and r and the screw valve W were closed ; and the whole apparatus was taken to pieces .
Then the palladium bulb , the liquid chlorine bulb , the chlorine condenser , and the bomb were cleaned and weighed .
In six experiments , then , the hydrogen chloride formed in the combustion was condensed in a steel bomb by liquid air .
In two other experiments Y ( fig. 7 ) was substituted for the bomb and the gas was condensed and weighed in water .
In this case the manipulation varied a little from that adopted in condensing the gas by liquid air .
Y was placed in a salt-ice mixture so as to freeze slowly the 100 c.c. of water it contained .
This done , Y was attached to a pump and rapidly evacuated .
At the end of the evacuation the phosphorus pentoxide showed no signs of harmful deliquescence .
The taps 2 and y having been closed , Y was disconnected from the VOL. CCIX.\#151 ; A. 0 pump and weighed .
It was then attached to the rest of the apparatus by a ground-glass joint .
The evaporation of the solid hydrogen chloride in B and its passage through Q was conducted as before , though at a lower pressure .
The purified hydrogen chloride passed through the taps z and y into the bulb Y , surrounded at first by cold water , later by a calcium-chloride-and-ice freezing mixture .
Here the gas was absorbed ; occasional shaking of Y kept down the pressure .
Towards the end of the absorption , when only a very little solid hydrogen chloride was left in B ( fig. 3 ) , the tap ywas closed and the end of the thick-walled capillary tube Z was immersed in liquid air .
The last traces of hydrogen chloride condensed here .
Preliminary experiments showed that in a high vacuum no measurable amount of hydrogen chloride could cling to the walls of the quartz combustion vessel .
As an extra precaution , however , the walls of A were always warmed by hot water during the last stages of the condensation of hydrogen chloride .
Z was separated by fusion from Y , but was afterwards weighed along with it .
Finally , the different parts of the whole apparatus were disconnected as before .
9 .
Analysis of Residual Gases.\#151 ; The analysis of the residual gases was carried out as follows:\#151 ; Fig. 8 is a sketch of the apparatus in which the gases were collected .
It consisted of a graduated glass reservoir A furnished with two taps , B and C , and connected with a graduated tube D. The weight of the apparatus , filled with mercury between the taps B and C , having been determined , D was filled with mercury and the whole placed in a mercury trough .
The gases were collected in D and passed into A ; it was assumed they were hydrogen and nitrogen .
The gas apparatus , standing in the trough , was then taken to the balance room .
The tap C was opened and the whole allowed to reach the temperature of the room .
By noting the difference in level of the mercury in A and of the C \#151 ; mercury in the trough , with the aid of the etched scales on A and I ) , the divisions of which were 1 mm. apart , and by subtracting this difference from the barometric height the pressure of the gases was found .
The tap C was closed , the tube D emptied , and the gas apparatus was again weighed .
The difference in the weights of the apparatus before and after the collection of the residual gases ( corrected for the weight of these residual gases ) gave their volume under the ascertained conditions of temperature and pressure .
D having been refilled with mercury , the gas apparatus was replaced in the trough , C was opened , and successive small volumes of pure , dry oxygen added to the gases .
Between each addition C was closed and the platinum spiral in A was cautiously heated by an electric current so as to bring about the combination without explosion of all Fig. 8 .
DR. EDWAED C. EDGAR ON THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF CHLORINE .
the oxygen with the hydrogen .
When the volume of oxygen added was just below half the volume of the residual gases , the tap C was temporarily closed .
The gas apparatus , still standing in the trough , was then attached by the inner portion E of a ground-glass joint to a Sprengel pump .
After the pump had been thoroughly evacuated , the tap B was opened and the small remaining volume of wet hydrogen and nitrogen ( in no experiment exceeding 4 c.c. in volume ) was sucked out of A. At the same time the tap C was cautiously opened so as to allow mercury to rise slowly in A and fill the whole apparatus , thus removing the last traces of gas from the apparatus .
The wet nitrogen and hydrogen passed through a coil , immersed in a freezing mixture of solid carbon dioxide and ether .
Most of the water vapour in the gases condensed in the coil .
The dried gases then passed through the pump and were collected in another gas apparatus , a sketch of which is to be found on p. 193 of Dixon and Edgar 's paper .
The details of the subsequent gas analysis are given in full on the same page .
The composition of the residual gases of the combustion , assuming they were hydrogen and nitrogen , was thus arrived at by subtracting from the total volume collected in the first gas apparatus ( fig. 8 ) the volume of nitrogen found in the second .
