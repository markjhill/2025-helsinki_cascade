I. " On Platinized Graphite Batteries .
" By C. V. WALKER , Esq. , F.R.S. , F.R.A.S. , &amp;c. Received January 4 , 1859 .
In a short note communicated to the Royal Society on March 9th , 1857 , and which was read on March 19th , reference was made to the voltaic combination that I had adopted for certain telegraphic purposes ; namely , zinc-graphite .
Graphite in its crude state had for some years been of great service to me , especially for batteries whose resting time is great in proportion to their working time .
Since the date of that niotice , I have considerably increased the value of graphite for electrical purposes by platinizing it according to the process first described by Mr. Smee , whose platinized silver battery has been long known and much used .
The material to which I refer by the term " Graphite , " is the crust or corrosion that is collected from the interior of iron gas retorts that have been long in use .
My first crude graphite battery of twelve pairs of plates was set up on April 5th , 1849 , for working the telegraph from my residence at Toubridge to the Telegraph Office about a mile distant .
It was charged with sand saturated with diluted acid ; and had not been dismounted in March 1851 , when I changed my abode .
During the interval , the sand was from time to time moistened with acid water or water only .
The plates in this case had been roughly chipped out and rubbed on stone into something like shape .
In the meani time I had some sets of plates cuit at the Locomotive Works , Ashford , and was thus enabled to obtain further results .
I forwarded a graphite battery to the Great Exhibition in 1851 , for which a prize medal was awarded .
The introduction of graphite into anything like general use was for a long period no easy matter , on account of the difficulty of finding any one who would undertake to cut it into plates , its hardness destroying the tools ; and the then limited demand did not encourage any orne to construct special machinery for the purpose .
My wants at length reached the ear of Mr. J. Ptobinson of Everton , Liverpool , who took the matter thoroughly in hand , and has succeeded perfectly in cutting plates into any form and to comparatively any size , at a very moderate cost , for which I am much indebted to him .
I have before me plates 12 inches X 10 inches , of smooth texture and uniform thickness , and have seen some of double that size .
The plates in common use for bell signals are 7inches x3 inches and T inch thick , of which about 2000 are in daily use on the South Eastern Railway , and the greater portion of these are now platinized .
The plates are delivered to me in their crude state , that is to say , they are merely cut into form .
Immediately on arrival they are placed in a stone pan , and covered with a mixture of 1 sulphuric acid +4 water , in which they are allowed to remain for three or four days or more .
They are taken out as required , and are washed under a tap of running water ; this operation dissolves out any foreign matter that might be pernicious in a voltaic combination wherein sulphuric acid was employed ; they are then partially dried .
A hole for a rivet is next drilled in the middle , near the top of each platea belt of varnish one inch wide is applied to the top on both sides of each plate-a blank one inch square , having the rivet hole for its centre , being left unvarnished on each side-electrotype copper is then deposited on the blanik square in the usual way .
The deposited metal is then tinned , no part of the copper being left bare ; a conniecting slip of copper , 6 inches x1 inch is prepared and also enitirely tinned ; this is riveted to the graphite plate with a copper rivet , also tinned .
The soldering iron is now applied , and a little solder run in between the two surfaces .
By thus protecting all the exposed copper with tin , the formation of sulphate of copper and its attendant inconveniences are prevented .
The plate is now platinized .
A mixture of 1 sulphuric acid + 10 water is placed in a vertical glass cell , to this are added a few crystals of chloride of platinuim till the solution presents a fainit straw colour .
The battery power employed for platinizing is three cells of platinized graphite and zirc .
The positive electrode is platinum or graphite itself , and is presented to both sides of the plate that is to be platinized .
The actioni is allowed to go on for about twenty minutes .
Each finished plate is tested as to its power of liberating the hydrogen of electrolysis , by placing it in acid water in contact with an amalgamated zinc plate .
I have drawn out the above description in the presenice of our assistant , who attends to this department of the telegraph establishment , in order to be correct in the small details .
The battery-cells for the plates above described are quart jars of stone-ware that resists acid .
The exciting solution is 1 sulphuric acid +8 to 12 water .
Zinc plates are riveted to the other end of the copper connecting slip , also with tin rivets .
The zinc is strongly amalgamated .
It is dipped in a vessel containing 1 sulphuric acid +4 water , and after a few seconds , more or less , is withdrawn and thrust in its then condition into a trough of mercury , and set aside to drain .
On the followinog day it is treated in a similar manniier .
When the batteries are being put together , and before the zincs are placed in the jars , the foot of each is placed in a trough or slipper of gutta percha , 3 inches by 4 inch , containing about a couple of ounces of mercury .
A battery thus carefully prepared will stand for an indefinitely long period with little perceptible waste , and he ready for use at all times .
Under ordiniary circumstances it is not necessary to dismount the batteries employed for telegr ph signaling more than once a year .
Mercury is added during the interval , and the jars are filled up as occasion requires .
The greater portion of the mercury is recovered : when old plates come home , a considerable quantity of rich amalgam is scraped from the plates ; this is placed in jars of acid water , and a few pieces of graphite are thrown in ; the electro-chemical actioni makes the amalgam poorer of zinc , and mercury is easily expressed .
By continuing the operation , more mercury , to the amount in all of nearly three-fourths , is recovered .
As an illustration of the economic importance of this material in applied science , I am i iformed that the silver plates of the batteries constructed for the Atlantic Telegraph cost z2O20 or more .
On my having directed the attention of the Company to graphite as a substitute for silver , a set of plates were ordered , equal in number and size , which were supplied ( furnished with electrotype copper and connectingv wires ) for X216 .
The following Table illustrates the effective working powers of platinized graphite , as compared , under like circumstances , with platiniized silver , given in lifting powers in pounds , A third column is added , giving the results when table salt is dissolved in the water employed with the graphites .

The silver-zinc pairs were 1 inch apart , the graphite-zinc , 2 inches .
The lifting powers were not read off more closely than to quarter-pounds .
The electro-magnlet used in Table I. was a small horse-shoe containing about 10 yards of No. 16 wire ; that used in Table II .
was one of the electromagnets used in the construction of the signal bells before described ( vide Proc. Roy .
Soc. , vol. viii .
p. 419 ) , and containing 274 yards of No. 16 copper wire .
The resistance added in each successive experiment was one bobbin of a similar electro-magnet or 137 yards of wire .
The resistances in the Table include the resistance of the electro-magnet .
The total resistances in Table II .
are all mnultiples of the contents of a single bobbin or 137 yards .
A glance from left to right on the same horizontal line shows the comparative value of each combination in the several experiments .
One or two small irregularities in Table II .
in the six-cell results , are doubtless due to the poles of the magnet not having been ground true .
With respect to durability , the graphite plates in use since 1850 are in as good condition as the new ones now in course of manufacture .
Silver plates employed by us under like circumstances , commenced perishing after twelve months or more of use ; they crumble away in great measure , they cut apart at the surface level , and they get eaten into holes throughout .
