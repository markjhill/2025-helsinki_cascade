The Bakerian Lecture : on some new Electro-chemical Phenomena .
By William Thomas Brand , Esq. F. R. S. Prof. Chem. RL Read November 25 , 18g3 . ? .
I. IT has been asce tained by Sir H. DAVY , that when compound bodies capable of transmitting electricity are submitted to the operation of the Voltaic pile , their proximate and ultimate elements are separated with uniform phenomena ; that acids are attracted towards the positively electrified surface , and that alkaline and inflammable substances take an opposite direction and collect at the negative pole .
Of the ultimate chemical elements of bodies , the greater number exhibit the last mentioned character , and a few only appear to be attracted towards the positive extremity of the Voltaic instrument ; and as bodies possessed of dissimilar electrical powers attract each other , it has been concluded , that the inherent electrical state of the former is positive , that of the latter negative .
These chemical effects were at first regarded as peculiar to the Voltaic pile , and were considered to depend upon the operation of a new agent , termed the Galvanic fluid , until Dr. WOLLASTON , in the year 1801 , succeeded in imitating the effects by means of the electrical machine , and thus * Phil. Trans. i8Si , p. 435 .
H s experimentally demonstrated the identity of common and Voltaic electricity .
More recent investigations , and especially the admirable researches of Sir H. DAVY , have fully established the correctness of these views , and have shown that the different action of the Voltaic pile and the electrical machine , depends chiefly upon the quantity of electricity in the former being great , while its intensity is inconsiderable , and vice versa .
In the following Lecture I shall have the honour of presenting the Royal Society with some new inquiries connected with these objects of research , and have much pleasure in adducing facts which throw further light upon this interesting department of chemical science , and which harmonize with the opinions of the able philosophers alluded to . ? .
I. When the flame of a candle is placed between two surfaces in opposite electrical states , the negative surface becomes most heated : this circumstance was considered by Mr. CUTHBERTSON as indicating the passage of electric fluid from the positive to the negative surface.* Mr. ERMAN t has shown that certain substances are unipolar in regard to the electricity of the Voltaic pile ; that is , that they are only susceptible of transmitting one kind of electricity .
The insulated flames of wax , of oil , of spirit of wine , and of hydrogen gas , only conduct positive electricity ; dry soap , on the contrary , and the flame of phosphorus , under the same circumstances , only transmit negative electricity .
Sir H. DAVY * considers the result of Mr. CUTHBERTSON ' experiment to depend upon the unipolarity of the flame , which would render it positive , and cause it to be attracted towards the negative pole .
On perusing these statements , it occurred to me that they admitted of another explanation , and that the appearances might be connected with the chemical nature of the substances employed .
I repeated Mr. CUTHBERTSON'S experiment , and found that when the electrical machine was in weak action , the negative surface not only became hat sooner than the positive , but that the smoke and flame of the candle were visibly attracted towards it .
I now removed the candle , and substituted the flame of phosphorus , when the appearances were exactly reversed : the positive surface now became considerably warmer than the negative , and the flame and smoke of the phosphorus were powerfully directed upon it .
I conceived , therefore , that the flame of the candle was attracted by the negative pole , in consequence of the carbon and hydrogen in which it abounds , and that the rapid formation of acid matter during the combustion of the phosphorus , was the cause of its attraction towards the positive pole : in short , that the appearances were consistent with the known laws of electro-chemical attraction .
To ascertain the correctness of this idea , it became necessary to examine the phenomena with greater precision , and to institute the more extended series of experiments , which , with their results , I shall proceed to detail .
The apparatus employed consisted of two insulated brass balls capable of being brought near to , or removed from each other , with a small table between them , as represented in the annexed drawing .

) When it was necessary to ascertain the relative temperatures of the balls with accuracy , I made use of the instrument , fig. 2 , devised by Mr. PEPYS , in which aa represent two thin spheres of brass containing delicate thermometers , the bulbs of which , as well as the interior of the spheres , were coated with lamp black , to render the increase of temperature more evident .
One of the balls was connected with the negative , the other with the positive conductor of a small electrical machine of ' Mr. NAIRNE'S construction , as represented in fig. 1 , so that the apparatus was perfectly insulated . ? .
IIt .
Exp. 1 .
A small stream of olefiant gas was burned between the balls .
The flame was evidently attracted towards the negative side .
The combustion was continued for one minute .
At the commencement of the experiment , the mercury in the thermometers stood at 60 ?
FAHRENHEIT ; at its termination the positive thermometer indicated 62 ?
, the negative 72 ? .
2 .
The experiment-was repeated with sulphuretted hydrogen : the flame was now only slightly attracted by the negative ball , but the sulphureous acid vapour passed off towards the positive surface .
In this experiment the positive thermometer rose 3 ?
, and the negative thermometer 6 ?
in one minute .
3 .
A very small flame of phosphuretted hydrogen was slightly bent towards the positive pole .
In one minute it produced an effect upon the positive thermometer = 5 ?
, upon the negative = 3 ? .
When a larger flame was used , it appeared equally drawn towards the two electrical poles , but the acid vapour passed off in the direction of the positive ball .
4 .
The flame of arsenicated hydrogen was attracted by the negative surface : the fumes of white arsenic produced during the combustion were slightly attracted towards the positive pole .
5 .
The flame of hydrogen appeared weakly attracted by the negatively electrified ball , but on employing the apparatus with thermometers , the rise was nearly equal on both sides .
In one experiment , made with much caution , the thermometers stood at its commencement at 56* .
The gas was burned for two minutes : the negative thermometer rose to 62 ?
, the positive to 61 ? .
In a second experiment , the combustion was continued for five minutes : the effect upon the negative thermometer was = 4 ?
, that upon the positive = 2,5 ' , 6 .
With a very small stream of carbonic oxide , the results were still less distinct .
The tip of the flame appeared in some cases to be slightly inclined towards the positive ball , but one thermometer was not more affected than the other .
On substituting a larger current of the gas , which produced a flame between three and four inches in length , it was much more evidently directed to the positive surface , but the rise in the positive thermometer was less than might have been expected .
In several cases where the combustion was continued for two minutes , the rise in the positive thermometer did not exceed that of the negative more than 2,5 to 3 degrees .
7 .
Sulphur , in a state of combustion , was placed between the oppositely electrified balls .
The flame being extremely 55 small , its direction could not be observed , but the sulphureous acid vapour was attracted by the positive ball .
8 .
The flame of the sulphuret of carbon ( sulphuretted liquor of LAMPADIUS ) was attracted by the negative surface : the acid fumes which it throws off took an opposite direction .
9 .
When phosphorus in a state of vivid combustion was introduced into the electrical circuit , the flame , and the phos .
phoric acid produced , were powerfully directed towards the positive surface .
The acid vapour which arises from phosphorus , during its slow combustion in a warm atmosphere , is also attracted by the positively electrified ball .
o1 .
A small stream of muriatic acid gas was allowed to pass , into the atmosphere between the electrified spheres ; it was immediately attracted to the positive pole .
This effect is ren .
dered more evident by the diffusion of a small quantity of ammonia through the atmosphere of the room in which the experiment is made .
The attraction of the muriatic acid is strikingly exhibited by coating the conductors with litmus paper , placing them at a distance of about six inches asunder , and propelling a current of the gas through a small tube between them .
If the electrical machine is not in too powerful action , the positive ball is instantly reddened , while the blue colour of the negative surface remains unaltered .
11 .
Nitrous acid gas exhibited the same appearances as muriatic acid .
12 .
Potassium in a state of combustion was placed between the electrified surfaces .
Its flame , and the alkaline fumes it produces , were drawn to the negative conductor .
Ammonia afforded no very distinct results .
I attempted to ascertain its electrical state by disengaging it through a small tube placed between the conductors , the atmosphere being slightly tainted with muriatic acid ; but it was apparently equally attracted and repelled by the electrical surfaces .
When the conductors were coated with turmeric paper , the negative appeared sooner reddened than the positive , but in a very short time the effect upon each became equal .
14 .
Benzoic acid evolved by gently heating benzoin between the electrical poles , was attracted to the positive side ; but when the balsam took fire , the flame and carbonaceous matter were immediately drawn in an opposite direction .
I heated some pure benzoic acid placed upon a silver capsule , between the balls ; as long as the temperature was only sufficient to raise it in vapour , it took the positive direction ; but the moment that the acid was inflamed , the carbonaceous fumes passed to the negative side .
15 .
Camphor during its combustion throws off a large quantity of charcoal , and when burned between the opposite electrical surfaces , furnishes a good instance of the attraction of that substance by the negative pole , which soon becomes coated with it , the positive ball being much less soiled .
i6 .
The resinous bodies in general exhibited the same appearances as camphor : when in a state of combustion , both the flame and smoke were repelled by the positive , and attracted by the negative pole .
17 .
Amber , on the contrary , presented phenomena nearly similar to those of benzoin .
When brought into a state of fusion , its acid vapour was attracted by the positive ball , but when made to burn , an opposite effect was produced .
iv .
In the preceding detail of experiments , such only have been selected as were attended with marked results .
The electrical energies of many other substances were examined and compared , but no new facts were ascertained , nor were any circumstances observed which interfere with the inferences suggested by the above statement .
To insure accuracy , each of the experiments was several times repeated in the presence and with the assistance of some of my chemical friends , and the results were uniform when proper precautions were attended to .
It is especially necessary to operate in a quiet atmosphere , and to employ a feeble electrical power , for if the machine is too strongly excited , the substances under examination are alternately attracted and repelled between the poles , especially if insulated , or non-conductors of electricity .
The balls were usually withdrawn from each other to a distance of four inches , and the subject of experiment placed equidistant between them .
The poles too were occasionally changed , by moving the connecting wires from one ball to the other , with a view to insure correctness by observing the change thus produced in the direction of the flame or vapour .
The experiments were sometimes varied , by using the Leyden jar with a sliding electrometer connected with its outer surface : the substance , the electricity of which was to be examined , was placed between the ball of the charged jar , and that of the electrometer .
Regarding these experiments , as connected with electrochemical theory , they appear to furnish a more evident proof than has hitherto been offered , of the inherent electrical states of matter , which are decidedly exhibited by the attractions and repulsions between the opposite poles ; and when connected with Dr. WOLLASTON'S researches , to which I have elsewhere alluded , they amply demonstrate the identity in chemical powers of common and Voltaic electricity .
The attraction of acids by the positively electrified surface , and of alkalies and inflammables by that which is negatively electrified , is thus easily exhibited ; and the theory which regards their mutual attractive energies , as dependent upon their opposite electrical states , confirmed by experiments , not less decisive , than those in which the Voltaic instrument was employed .
Of the former class phosphorus in slow , and in rapid combustion , and benzoic acid , furnish the most striking instances ; and of the latter , the combustion of potassium and of camphor are excellent examples .
There are , however , some circumstances which appear difficult to explain , and which have not turned out as might have been expected a priori .
The combustion , for instance , of carburetted hydrogen gives rise to the production of water and carbonic acid , but its flame is entirely and powerfully attracted by the negative surface ; and carbonic oxide , which produces carbonic acid , is not very evidently attracted by either pole , unless the flame be of a very large size .
It may , however , be conceived with regard to carburetted hydrogen , that the carbonic acid which is formed does actually pass off to the positive surface , and that the polarity of its flame is influenced rather by the combustible , than by the product of combustion : this idea is in some measure sanctioned by the appearances exhibited by the flame of the sulphuret of carbon , which is directed towards the negative ball , although the sulphureous acid visibly passes towards the positive side , and it is fair to infer , that the carbonic acid accompanies it .
An attempt was made to detect the carbonic acid by means of caustic potash : for this purpose a piece of linen , moistened with the alkaline solution , was applied to each conductor , and a current of carbonic acid , issuing from a small tube , was directed between them .
The linen was then put into dilute muriatic acid , and it was expected that the effervescence would be greatest in that removed from the positive pole ; this generally appeared to be the case , but I cannot say that the results were satisfactorily distinct , nor indeed does the method admit of the accuracy required .
The experiments related in the second section of this lecture , suggest an explanation of the phenomena alluded to , as observed by Mr. ERMAN , more consonant with the known laws of electricity than that which he has suggested .
The flame , for instance , of oil , wax , &amp;c. must be considered as consisting chiefly of those bodies in a state of vapour , and their natural electricities being positive , it is obvious , that , when connected with the positive pole of the battery , and with a gold leaf electrometer , the leaves will continue to diverge , but when applied to the negative pole , that electrical state will be annihilated by the inherent positive energy of the flame , and consequently the leaves of the negative electrometer will not diverge .
On the other hand , the flame of phosphorus is negatively unipolar .
Now it has been shown , that this flame , ( owing probably to the rapidity with which it is forming a powerful acid by combination with a large portion of oxygen , ) 60o -__ __ _ fhiios .
