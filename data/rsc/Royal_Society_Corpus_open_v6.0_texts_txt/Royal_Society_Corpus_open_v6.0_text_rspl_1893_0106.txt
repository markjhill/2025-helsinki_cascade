] rotational aether has been essayed by Mr. Heaviside , who found it to be unworkable as regards conduction-current , and not sufficiently comprehensive ( 'Phil .
Trans. , ' 1892 , S 16 ; 'Electrical Papers , 'vol.2 , p. 543 ) .
A method of representing the phenomena of the electric field by the motion of tubes of electric displacement has been developed by Professor J. J. Thomson , who draws attention to their strong analogies to tubes of vortex motion ( " Recent Researches . .
1893 , p. 52 ) .
Professor Oliver Lodge has kindly looked for an effect of a , magnetic field on the velocity of light , but has not been able to detect any , though the means he employed were extremely searching ; the inference would follow , on this theory , that the motion in a magnetic field is very slow , and the density of the medium correspondingly great.\#151 ; December 18 , 1893 .
