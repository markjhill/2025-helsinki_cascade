DEAR SIR , -The favourable position of Jupiter for scrutiny of his physical features may perhaps have already brought to the Royal Society some notice of the aspect of his belts .
Whether that be so or not , I think you will readily excuse the desire I feel to lay before the Society a sketch from my equatorial , which shows the colours of several celestial objects more distinctly than I am accustomed to hear is the case with some other instruments of the achromatic class .
The sketch shows the usual equatorial bands* , or rather bands nearly in the usual latitudes north and south of the equator .
These , to the eyes of my friends and to mine , appear not dark grey , or greyish brown , or brown , but nearly of the colour of some ochraceous sands , or the yellower parts of what is called " red " deal .
Several friends to whom I have shown the planet have immediately exclaimed , " how red the bands are ; " " never saw them so red before .
" The bands far from the equator are not reddened , but of a grey tint a little warmed .
The space between the equatorial bands , sometimes described as yellow , appears rather bright white and silverymuch the brightest part of the surface .
The outer borders of the equatorial bands are not parallel , the inner borders much unequal ; in one part the two bands are connected across .
Not the faintest trace of such a tint as that conspicuous in these bands appears on any part of the moon ; but it is pretty nearly the tint of the supposed " land " of Mars .
In fact , it was suggested to my mind that these coloured extra-equatorial belts were land , seen between white clouds , of which the brightest band was on the equator .
