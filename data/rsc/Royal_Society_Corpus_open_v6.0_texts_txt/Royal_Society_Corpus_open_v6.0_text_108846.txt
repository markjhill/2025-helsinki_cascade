On the Law of Expansion of Superheated Steam .
By WILLIAM FAIRBAIRN , Esg .
, LL. D. , F.R.S. , and THOMAS TATE , Esq. Received March 20 , -Read April 3 , 1862 .
THE following experiments have been undertaken to verify the law of expansion for superheated steam indicated in a previous paper* .
The earliest experiments on the subject were made by Mr. FROST in America , but without sufficient accuracy to be of scientific value .
Mr. SIEMENS has also experimented on the expansion of steam isolated from water ; his results give a much higher rate of expansion for steam than for ordinary gases ; but , owing to the obvious defects of Mr. SIEMENS'S method of conducting the experiments , we consider that his results are not reliable .
For gases , the rate of expansion is expressed by the formula , for constant volume , P E+t P-E+l E t(1 .
) where E is a constant derived from experiment and determined by REGNAULT to be 459 in the case of air In the paper alluded to , it was shown that , with a certain proviso , the rate of expansion of superheated steam nearly coincided with that of air .
Within a short distance of the maximum temperature of saturation , the rate of expansion of steam was found to be exceedingly variable ; near the saturation-point it is higher than that of air , and it decreases as the temperature is increased until it becomes sensibly identical with that of air .
The results on which this law was based were too limited in their range for much numerical accuracy in the constants deduced .
Hence it has been our object in the present paper to supply the deficiency in the previous one , by affording experimental data of the expansion of steam at higher temperatures and with a greater range of superheating than was possible with the apparatus employed in ascertaining the density of steam .
The results obtained in these later researches , however , confirm the general law deduced from the previous ones .
The annexed diagram represents the experimental apparatus employed where the pressures did not exceed that of the atmosphere .
It consists of a glass globe a , about three inches in diameter , and with a stem about thirty-five inches long .
The capacity of this globe was known to a point b on the stem , where a piece of fine platinum wire was twisted round it to mark accurately the level to which the mercury column in the stem was to be brought to maintain a constant volume in the globe .
The stem dipped below into the 1l-inch tube d , which was supported on a frame of wood e e , sliding up and down vertically on the larger frameff , on which the apparatus was supported .
The frame e e , and the tube d , were balanced by cords passing over pulleys in the top of the frame , and weighted by bags filled with small pieces of iron .
In this way the tube d could be adjusted with the greatest facility , so as to maintain the upper level of the mercury column at a constant position .
To read the lower and variable level of the column , a rod g g , graduated into tenths of an inch , was fixed vertically , carrying a finger and vernier , h , which could be made to coincide accurately with the top of the meniscus of mercury , c. For heating the globe , a glass bath , k , containing oil , was provided , fixed in an outer iron mercury bath , 1 .
This was heated by a coil of gas-jets , and the oil was stirred continually , excepting at the instant of adjusting the upper level of the column to the level of the platinum wire .
The globe was fixed in the oil-bath by a stuffing-box .
The method of conducting the experiments was as follows .
The globe a was filled with dry and warm mercury , the air-bubbles being extracted from time to time by an air-pump .
It was then inverted to form a Torricellian vacuum .
A small glass globule of water was then inserted , the platinum wire fixed in its place , and an india-rubber cap fitted over the extremity of the stem .
It was then transferred to its place in the oil-bath , and fixed there .
The india-rubber cap was replaced by an open glass cistern , so that the glass tube d could be elevated to its position .
The gas-jets were lighted , and the temperature raised to 300 ? .
From this point the levels of the column were read off at intervals of 50 ?
until the temperature of saturation was reached .
The levels were rjI II 592 taken in a series of descending temperatures , to avoid the influence of steam boiling out of the mercury as the temperature rose , and to eliminate the effect of the cohesion of the glass on the water , as explained in our previous paper on the Density of Steam .
Capacity of the Globe .
Twelve cubic inches of mercury were measured into the globe , and a file-mark made on the stem .
Below the first file-mark , at a distance of 14X45 inches , another file-mark was made to afford a fixed point for ascertaining the correspondence of the upper file-mark with the readings on the fixed graduated rod or cathetometer .
Correction of Readings .
Let a be the reading on the fixed rod of the level of the column ; b be the reading of the lower file-mark on the globe-stem .
Then +b--a=the height of the column of mercury in the globe-stem .
To correct this for temperature , 71 inches of mercury , included in the oil-bath and its stuffing-box , were corrected for the temperature of the oil , and the remainder for the temperature of the atmosphere at the time .
By deducting the column so corrected from the reading of the barometer at the time , the total pressure in the globe is obtained .
The readings of the thermometer are corrected for the portion out of the oil-bath .
The pressure of the vapour of mercury is calculated from data supplied with great courtesy by M. REGNAULT , and embodying the results of unpublished experiments .
The pressure of this vapour is assumed to be the same as that in a vacuum , as the vapour in the globe remains still for a sufficient time ( it is believed ) for saturation to take place .
In this view we have been strengthened by M. REGNAULT'S opinion .
By deducting the pressure of mercury vapour from the total pressure in the globe , the pressure of the steam is obtained .

596 Summary of Results .
The law of expansion of gaseous bodies is expressed by the formula E+ t PV E+ t PIV PVt P , V , t. .
E-p pie PJV PV where E is a constant .
The values of E thus deduced have been placed in the last column of the foregoing Tables .
They show a decreasing rate of expansion from the saturationpoint upwards until ( at a certain increase of temperature ) the rate of expansion coincides -with that of a perfect gas .
Taking from the preceding Tables the two results , which in each case represent the rate of expansion at the greatest distance from the saturation-point , we have the following values of E:(1 ) 474-48 450-11 ( 2 ) 455-57 443-86 ( 3 ) 466-85 451-94 ( 4 ) 464-83 460-79 ( 5 ) 460-28 9)4128-71 Mean value of E458-74 The value of E for air , as ascertained by REGNAULT , is 459 .
That assumed for a perfect gas by RANKINE is 461-2 .
Hence the conclusion which we suggested in our previous paper has been satisfactorily demonstrated in more carefully conducted experiments , and the rate of expansion of superheated steam is shown to be almost identical with that of air and other permanent gases , if calculated at temperatures not too close to the maximum temperature of saturation .
