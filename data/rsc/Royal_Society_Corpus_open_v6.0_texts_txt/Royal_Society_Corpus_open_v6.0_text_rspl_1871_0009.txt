And it will be seen , from comparing .
Glaisher 's emarks and results with what in this paper , that the supplementary matter herein given , including the extension of \amp ; c. to 110 places of decimals , can scarcely be without interest to especi as regards the summation of the harmonic series in the formula for finding the vnlue of E. Not having seen M. Oettinger 's article in Crelle 's ' On Comthe value of the author is unable to stnte what artifices he used in summing the harmonic series . .
Glaisher gives a very simple and obvious one from M. Oettinger , which the author could not bnt see and employ for calcul a values of the reciprocals of the even numbers .
In summing the harmonic series , the author found the reciplocals of it]l numbers up to 200 , as far as 200 places of decimals ; next the reciprocals from 200 to 500 , to only 105 decimals ; and afterwards the recip r of the odd composite numbers up to 5000 , to the same extent .
In to some extra calculation was necessary ) which need not be stated here .
It is , however , necessary to calculate , in extenso , the reciprocals of the odd composite numbers only to half the number of terms which it is proposed to sum .
The reciprocals of all the prime ) must of course be calculated separately .
The leading artifices the author employed to shorten calculation may bc best stated and explained by supposing that the ocals of all the odd numbers below 5000 have been computed etained separ tely , also 30 Mr. W. Shanks on the [ Nov. 28 , that the sum of the series to 5000 terms has been found , and that the series is required to be summed to 10,000 .
terms .
To obtain the sum of the reciprocals of the even numbers from 5000 to 10,000 , we :\mdash ; rrhese twelve quotients , dded t , give the valne of the reciprocals of the numbers between 5000 and 10,000 , including the latter number .
To obtain the sum of the of the odd composite numbers between 5000 and 10,000 , we have , using prime divisors , Here it must be observed that all odd numbers which are multiples of previous prime must } excluded : ) must be excluded from division by 5 , because 1005 is a multiple of 3 .
Here it must be noted that all numbers below prime divisors must always be excluded . . . . . . . .
These twenty-four quotients , when added together , give the sum of the reciprocaIs of the odd composite numbers between 5000 and 10,000 .
To this sum add the sum of the prime reciprocals between 5000 and 10,000 ; the result is the value of the reciprocals of all the odd numbers between 5000 and 10,000 .
It need scarcely be stated that the sum of these two Numerical Value of Eule Constant .
31 distinct sets of numbers , increased by the sum of the series ) terms , will give the sum of the harmonic series to 10,000 terms .
Before proceeding further it should be ted that , having obtained the correct value of , from \amp ; c. to 110 declmals , verifying Mr. Glaisher 's to 99 decimals , it was comparatively easy to extend and to 110 decimals and to correct and extend , and to the same extent .
' we have , the calculations from Bernoulli 's 31 numbers will lead to obtaining only to about 92 decimals .
This vadue may no doubt be extended by finding the ratio between the last and each succeeding Bernoulli 's number .
Such ratio is , however , only approximative , and can yield correct results of only a limited number of de.cimals .
The excess of the Bernoulli terms over the \mdash ; ones , to 110 declnals , when is used , is readily obtained when and are known to the same extent .
Such excess be found below ; also the separate sums of the \mdash ; terms in which Bernoulli 's numbers enter , both when and when , to 205 decimals .
The values of , and to 110 decimals , also the corresponding \mdash ; results of the Bernoulli terms to the same extent , are likewise given below , as they involve very considerable calculation , and may thus be tested and verified .
The values of and may as well be also written , inasmuch as a few slight errors had crept into them before .

" " An Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Sound By E. J. STONE , , F.R.S. , Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope .
Received August ( Abstract .
) A galvanic current passes from the batteries at the Royal Observatory , Cape Town , at 1 o'clock , and discharges a gun at the Castle , and relays drops a time-ball at Port Elizabeth .
It appeared to the author that a valuable determination of the velocity of sound might be obtained by measuring upon the chronograph of the Observatory the interval between the time of the sound reaching some point near the gun and that of its arrival at the Observatory .
As there is only a single wire between the Observatory and Cape Town , some little difficulty was experienced in making the necessary arrangements , without any interference with the 1 o'clock current to Port Elizabeth ; but this difficulty was overcome by a plan which the describes , and which was into successful operation on Feb. 2 1871 .
The ents could not have beeri carried out , on account of the encroachment they would have made on the time of the Observatory staff , had it not been for the assistance of J. Den , Esq. , the acting manager of the Cape Telegraph Company , to whom the author is indebted for the preparation of a good earth-connexion near the gun , for permission to .
Kirby , a gentleman attached to the telegraph office , to assist in the experiments , and for a general superintendeuce of the arrangements at Cape Town .
The observed times of hearing the sound were recorded on the raph by two observers , situated one ( Mr. Kirby ) at a distance of 641 feet from the gun , the other ( Mr. Mann ) at the Observatory , at .
distance of 15,449 feet from the gun .
The former distance was sufficient to adlow the connexion of the main wire to be broken at the telegraph office after the gun httd been fired , but before the sound reached the first observer .
As there were no reciprocal , a correction was made ation for the of the wind , its velocity being measured by a set of
