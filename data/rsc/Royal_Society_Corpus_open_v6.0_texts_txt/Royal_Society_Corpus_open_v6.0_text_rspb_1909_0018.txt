) Under the bove title a paper has recently appeared by Mr. A. 1 ) .
in the .
Soc. Proc vol. , p. 61 et seq. , giving further experimental evidence with regard to the of certain characters in peas .
The paper is an interesting one , bnt the method adopted is not , I venture to think , capable of answering the problem the author set himself .
It has been supposed by some Mendelians that the theory of inheritance mlmed up in the " " law of ancestral heredity\ldquo ; was in some invalidated by investigations such its Mr. Darbishire 's , and that opinion con sciously or unconsciously seems to be expressed in the paper just referred to .
The law of an cestral heredity is embraced in the following state1nents:\mdash ; ( i ) In a population assortative the regression line for offspring on any ancestor is linear .
( ii ) The correlations between and the successive grades of ancestry a ression dimin ieometrically as we ascend to distant rades ; and The general of an lual to his aneestry can be expressed by the multiple ) rrelationfornlula .

is explaltation , Prof. K. Pearson .
[ Mar. 19 , erefore , of the apparent contradiction between such experiments as those of Mr. Darbishire and the theoretical development of the Mendelism which they profess to establish ?
It does not seem hard to account for the divergence .
Experiments as those of Mr. Darbishire do not deal with a population as a whole , and consider the contributions to the next eration of all its components supposed to be mated at random .
I feel quite certain that if Mr. Darbishire makes the requisite crosses in due proportions , and does not weight with differential fertility , he will find that ancestry does matter .
That it does matter is just as good a proof of Mendeli , as Mr. 's proof in the simpler case that it has not any eHect .
he fails to find its influence , then he will have refuted Mendelian theory .
To illustrate my point , take a population distribution which would follow from crossing two pure races with respectively dominant and recessive characters represented by the letters and .
Suppose the hybrids to cross at random , then the population will remain absolutely stable with the permanent formula .
to cross with itself or with .
Table I ives the scheme of offsprin with palents .
This population of 16 individuals of 6 different types of parentage now crosses with ] itself .
The result is a population of 256 individuals types of parent( .
This is exhibited in ) II .

But this criticism not valid , , in the population we are dealing with , it is clear that DR is the modal or mean , and , accordingly , it is perfectly neutral in the regression or correlation of the ) character .
In other words , the deviations of the ancestry from the mean population ( ameticchal.acter are all zero and accordingly they have no in using the spring to deviate from the population norm .

Table II is obtained by a symbolic process which will not be affected if we replace by and by , so that to exhibit the results for a Mendelian population of any constituent proportions we have only to multiply all the numbers in any row of offspring of Table Ir by for a DD grandparent , by for a DR ndparent , and by for an RR randparent , with the stable population which arises after the randou ) lnating .
We then reach the ] table for the case of classification by somatic characters , for brevity vrite : , and of pure ninants to recessives in the stable population .

When experimental work is adduced to demonstrate that ancestry has no influence , it will on investigation be found that the writer is : ( i ) his attention , as Mr. ) , to isolated liIJes of inheritance , with restricted matings ; ( ii ) Asserting a gametic knowledge of parents is equivalent to a gametlc knowledge of ancestry .
In neither case does the ument touch the ancestral position , which is summed up in the assertions that if we measure inheritance by the resemblance of somatic characters between and ancestry , then , in a population mating at random : The more ancestors of any grade with a given somatic character the mole with that character .
