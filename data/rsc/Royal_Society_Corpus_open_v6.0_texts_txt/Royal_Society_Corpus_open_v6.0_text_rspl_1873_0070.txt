380 On the Anatomy of Connective Tissue fyc .
[ June 18 , 8 .
At times , D puts on the appearance of the limiting line of a chan-nelled-space spectrum , the " easing off " of the absorption being now on one side and now on the other .
9 .
Should all these phenomena be ultimately referred to the causes which produce a channelled-space spectrum ( one of which undoubtedly is the tendency to a unilateral instead of a bilateral widening ) , a line-spectrum will be regarded as a special case merely , and not as an entirely different spectrum , as it has been hitherto ; and the range of molecular combinations in any one element from which line-spectra may be produced is extended .
10 .
The question further arises , whether many of the short lines in spectra are not remnants of channelled-space spectra .

" Given the Number of Figures ( not exceeding 100 ) in the Reciprocal of a Prime Number , to determine the Prime itself .
" By William Shanks .
Communicated by the Rev. G. Salmon , F.R.S. Received May 19 , 1874 .
In a former communication { supra , p. 200 ) I gave a Table showing the number of figures in the period of the reciprocal of every given prime up to 20,000 .
The Table here introduced is intended to solve the converse problem , and to show what primes have a given number of figures in their period .
It appears at once , from the ordinary rule for converting a pure circulating decimal into a proper fraction , that if the reciprocal of a prime have n figures in its period , that prime must be a factor in the number formed by writing down n nines , and therefore also , generally , in the number formed by writing down nones .
We denote that number by n that is to say , 5 ( in the left column ) , for example , =11111 , except where 3 , 32 , 33. . .
.3\#174 ; are concerned , when we have 3 , for example , =999 .
The problem now before us is equivalent to that of breaking up into its prime factors ; and the previous Table gives us great facility in doing this , for it exhibits every factor of n which is less than 20,000* ; and if , after accounting for all these , the remaining factor of is less than 30,0002 , we may be sure that it is a prime number , and that the resolution is complete .
If we have to deal with a composite number this may obviously be written down either as m groups of n ones or as groups of nt ones .
It follows that mn contains m and n as factors .
We may also state here that 12 , besides the factor 9901 , obviously has all the factors belonging to any submultiple of 12 , e.g. 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ; and that this holds in all other similar cases , and need not be stated again .
When we affirm that the resolution in any case is complete ( and , indeed , throughout the Table ) , it is to be clearly understood that the submultiples have all been carefully attended to , and thus any result may easily be verified .
The high factors found ( those , we mean , above 30,0002 ) have involved considerable labour ; and though we may not say absolutely that they are primes , yet we are certain that , if composite , their component factors are primes each greater than 30,000 , and that the periods of their reciprocals have readily been found .
It only remains to add here that the left column contains the given number of figures in the reciprocal of the prime or primes found and placed opposite in the right column , or , in a few cases , of the second powers of primes , and as far as the sixth power of the prime 3 .
If the number of figures in tl^ reciprocal of P be n , then the general rulet , which may be drawn from particular cases such as the following two , is that the number of figures in the reciprocal of P1 is n P , of P3 is * In point of fact I have carried on the calculation up to 30,000 .

Mr. W. Shanks on the [ June 18 , \#187 ; P2 , and so on .
Since the period of -L ~ 18 , and since the remainders resulting from dividing 18 such periods successively by 19 are , in order , 15 , 11 , 7 , 3 , 18 , 14 , 10 , 6 , 2 , 17 , 13 , 9 , 5 , 1 , 16 , 12 , 8 , 4 , 0 , it follows that = 18x19=342 .
The law of such remainders , after the first has 192 been obtained , is simple enough , and may be written down at once .
Again , since the period of ji^ = 81 , also since the remainders resulting from dividing 163 such periods , each of 81 figures , successively by 163 are , in order , 149,135,121,107 , 93 , 79 , 65 , 51 , 37 , 23 , 9,158,144 ... .0 ( the series consisting of 163 terms , of which the last is 0 ) , it follows that \#151 ; ?\#151 ; = 81 x 163 = 13203 .
The law of the above series is evident , and 1632 the number of terms is easily found to be 163 .
There is an obvious exception when P = 3 ; then the period is divisible by P , and the number of figures in the reciprocal of 32 is 1 , of 33 is 3 , and of 3n is 3"~2 .
There are other exceptions also , or at all events one .
Desmarest , for instance , has remarked that in the case of P=487 , the period is divisible by 487 ; and therefore the number of figures in the reciprocal of 4872 is the same as that in the reciprocal of 487 , viz. 486 .
I am not acquainted with the general theory of such exceptions ; nor do I know what other primes ( if any ) besides 3 and 487 have the same peculiarity .
With these explanations the following Table can readily be understood .
We mark with an asterisk those cases in which the resolution is complete , thus 28 j 29.281 .
12149 9449 .
We are to be understood as affirming that 12149 9449 is a prime number .
