231 moderate degree of traction is made .
Fortunately this condition of traction upon a solid body already engaged in the intestinal tube can but rarely come into Operation in the animal body , or it would undoubtedly prove peculiarly difficult to overcome .
Mechanical irritation of the lower mouth or upper mouth of the fistulous intestine , if persisted in , .
developed a powerful peristalsis which caused the rapid passage of a solid body through the fistula and its expulsion by the lower opening .
Thus if the animal was induced\#151 ; which it readily was\#151 ; to lick the mouth of the fistula after the sound had been inserted in the upper opening , expulsion from the lower opening occurred in four to eight minutes .
By moving a glass rod\#151 ; passed within the mouth of the fistula\#151 ; gently round or in and outwards , the same result was occasionally produced , but not with the same speed or certainty .
The consideration of the effect of electrical stimulation and of a number of drugs , upon whose action I believe new light will be thrown by this method of experimentation , I must leave to a future paper .
I have purposely avoided entering into a discussion of the physiological rationale of the various phenomena I have described in this communication , because they cannot find their full explanation in the examination of a fistulous animal .
This explanation must be sought by experiment of another character , and although much has been rendered clear to me by the analytical research I have already made , other points are still lacking their complete elucidation .
Until the latter research appears , I likewise postpone reference to the literature of the subject .
To the Royal Society , which presented me with a donation in aid of this research , and to Prof. Hugo Kronecker , of Berne , who most kindly placed his laboratory at my disposal for its accomplishment , my best thanks are due , and I gladly take this opportunity of recording them .

applicable or unsatisfactory , since even the best observers using all possible precautions disagree.* The platinum wire used was the purest , with an unusually high temperature coefficient , and very unalterable .
If Rt be the resistance of a given coil at 100 ' C. , and R0 the resistance at 0 ' C. , and It the resistance at any other temperature , the experiments abundantly prove ( 1 ) that with proper precautions R0 is constant to O'Ol per cent. , even if the coil has been subjected for hours to a temperature of 1300 ' 0 .
( 2 ) For several different pieces of Em wire from the same reel it was found that the ratio \#151 ; 1 was constant R0 to the same degree of accuracy , and equal to 1'3460 .
( 3 ) That for Rx-Ro Ro two different wires of pure platinum , though the values of may differ 3 per cent. , yet the values of R\#151 ; Ro Ri\#151 ; Ro 100 , that is to say , of the temperature Centigrade by platinum wire , agree to 0'1 per cent , through the range 0\#151 ; 600 ' .
The method of comparing the temperature variations of different wires is very accurate .
The wires to be compared are interwound symmetrically so as to form a double screw thread on non-conducting material ( e.g. , clay ) , and are heated in a vacuous porcelain tube in a gas furnace regulated to produce steady temperatures .
When the temperature is steady we may assume that the mean temperatures of the two wires are accurately the same .
The simultaneous resistances are measured by the Wheatstone bridge method with a sensitive mirror galvanometer and resistance boxes accurate to 0'01 per cent. The Comparison of two similar pure platinum wires might be effected with even greater accuracy than O'Ol per cent , by using a wire bridge ( Carey Foster 's method ) , since the ratio of their resistance is very nearly constant ( variation perhaps 2 per cent , between 0 ' and 600 ' ) , and all sources of error affect both wires equally .
The resistance of the connecting wires at each steady temperature is measured and allowed for , and thermoelectric effects are carefully eliminated : as a precaution the insulation is also measured .
It is evident then that by adopting one wire as the standard and comparing others with it , temperature measurements may be made strictly comparable through a very wide range , since the platinum thermometer is almost universally applicable , and is usually more convenient , sensitive , and accurate than any other kind .
The chief objection to its use is the need of auxiliary apparatus for accurately measuring the resistance : its great superiority lies in its wide range , its freedom from zero error , and its adaptability .

Comparisons were also made between the platinum pyrometer and the air thermometer at constant mass and volume up to nearly 600 ' C. By enclosing the fine platinum spiral inside the bulb of the air thermometer itself , errors of unequal heating were to a great extent avoided .
A modified form of air thermometer was devised for the purpose , in which the air is confined at constant volume by sulphuric acid in an 'auxiliary gauge which is connected to the mercury manometer by vulcanised rubber tube .
For the high temperature observations the bulb was made of a combustion glass tubing which does not soften till 700 ' C. ; the linear expansion of this kind of glass was determined by a very accurate method , in which the mean temperature of the glass tube is given by a platinum wire extending down its axis .
It was found that if kept for any time at about 500 ' C. , or higher , the glass bulb is liable to capricious changes of volume amounting to about 0'1 per cent , or more ; by a slight and convenient modification of the sulphuric acid gauge such changes may be determined on the principle of the volumometer and allowed for .
By avoiding the permanent change the linear expansion could be represented by the formula ^-=1 + *000006801+2*7.10\#151 ; !9 with a mean error of 0*2 per cent , per single observation .
Among other sources of error affecting the air thermometer at these temperatures we may mention surface condensation .
It seems certain that the surface air film varies with the temperature , and when completely removed by exhaustion at a high temperature does not recover its normal state for some time , so that the zero pressure may decrease upwards of a millimetre of mercury in a week .
The investigation of this is , however , still incomplete .
The results of all the observations with three different instruments are well represented by the formula R=e1^\lt ; ... ... ... ... ... ... .

Between 0 ' and 200 ' C. the curve ( e ) is very nearly a straight line , R=l + 0*003460\#163 ; , as it has a point of inflexion at about 80 ' C. The mean deviation of an observation between 400 ' and 600 ' from this curve is about 2*5 ' C. , but it would be rash to use the formula ( e ) outside the range covered by the experiments : it is for all reasons far Mr. H. L. Callendar .
preferable to use t= g\#151 ; ~100 , and to call the temperature so calculated temperature by platinum wire , as this involves no assumption and different wires nearly agree .
It is from a thermometric point of view that the method above described of comparing different wires with the standard is most valuable : but it might also be employed to form very accurate comparative tables of the change of resistance with temperature for different metals referred to platinum as a standard .
Such tables would , however , be of little use apart from the actual specimens of metal employed , except in so far as they tended to elucidate the general phenomenon of the variation of resistance with temperature .
With this view a comparison was made between platinum and iron , the resistance variation of which metal appeared likely from previous observations to differ widely from that of platinum .
The curve deduced resembled the steam pressure curve , and suggested the formula* at f0\ B , =ei+j8* * .

The chief difficulty of the comparison is that of protecting the iron wire from alteration when it is maintained at a red heat for some time .
The following Table , II , gives some observations selected at random from a long series in which the zero variation of the iron did not exceed 0'05 per cent. The observations were mostly taken on different days ; and the resistances observed at the air temperature in the intervals show the direction in which the correction for zero variation should be applied , but not its amount .
It is noteworthy that in all cases the correction for this would tend to reduce the small differences between the formula ( e ) and the observations .
As it is , the mean difference is only 0o , l C. It does not appear that any other equally simple and convenient formula could be found representing the observations equally well .
Treating the observations on the comparison of two platinum wires in precisely the same way , we shall find for the values of the constants , assuming #/ 3 as before for the standard , wire-\#151 ; Standard wire a , \#151 ; 0 *0034259 .
so that the values of / 3 are almost identical .
If/ 3==^ ' we have the relation between the resistances at the same temperature It is intended to continue the experiments at higher temperatures , and to apply the platinum thermometer to other investigations .

The Only methods hitherto proposed for determining the amount of organic^ matter in air are the two devised by the late Dr. Angus Smith ( " Air and Bain " ) .
According to the first of these methods , a definite quantity of the air to be examined is slowly bubbled through a dilute solution of potassium permanganate of known strength until it is fully !
or considerably bleached , ' and in the latter ease the amount of undecoimposed permanganate determined by oxalic acid .
In the second method a known volume of air is bubbled through distilled water , and the latter examined for free and albuminoid ammonia by Wanklyn and Chapman 's process for water analysis .
