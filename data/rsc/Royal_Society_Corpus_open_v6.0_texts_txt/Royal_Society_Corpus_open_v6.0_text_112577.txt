Received January 25 , 1866 .
Some time since , in connexion with a research on the fusing-point of mercury , several observations were made at Kew of the specific gravity of this fluid .
A specific-gravity bottle was used for this purpose and it was washed , in the first place with sulphuric acid , secondly with distilled water , and thirdly with alcohol ; when this was done it was found to contain mercury without any air-specks or any diminution of that metallic lustre which pure mercury exhibits when in contact with a vessel of clean glass .
Three different specimens of pure mercury were used and were separately weighed in the specific-gravity bottle at 62 ?
Fahr. The following results were obtained : Weighed in air .
Mercury from the cistern of the old Kew grs. standard barometer , filling the bottle , 13591'36 weighed at 62 ?
F ... ... ... ... ... . .
Mercury from the cistern of the new Kew 1 1359l 66 standard barometer weighed at 62 ?
F. Mercury used in experiments with air13591-96 thermometer weighed at 62 ?
F ... ... the mean of these will be 13591*66 grs. It was found that the specific-gravity bottle had an internal volume equal very nearly to 4 cubic inches , and assuming that a cubic inch of air weighs 0,31 gr. , then the air displaced by the liquid filling the bottle would weigh 1*24 gr. In like manner the air displaced by the Kew standard weights ( sp. gr. 8'2 ) would have the volume of 6'6 cubic inches , and would weigh 2-04 grs. From these premises we find that the real weight of the mercury in vacuo would have been 13590'86 grs. Again , the amount of water which the same bottle held at 62 ?
F. weighed in air 1000'53 grs. Here the air displaced by the bottle is , as before , 1'24 grs. , while that displaced by the weights is only 0'15 gr. From this we find that the real weight of water filling the bottle at 62 ?
F. would be in vacuo 1001 62 grs. We have thusTrue weight of mercury filling the bottle at 62 ?
F. = 13590-86 grs. True weight of the same volume of water at 62 ?
F. = 1001'62 grs. And hence the specific gravity of mercury at 62 ?
F. , as compared with water at the same temperature , will be 13*569 nearly .
Again , if we assume the correctness of Regnault 's Table of the absolute dilatation of mercury , and also that of Despretz 's Table of the absolute dilatation of water , we shall find that the weight at 32 ?
F. of a volume of mercury weighing 1359*086 grs. at 62 ?
F. will be 13590-86 x 1-00298=13631-361 grs. Also the volume at 4 ?
C. , or 39 ?
'2 F. , of a volume of water weighing at 62 ?
F. 1001-62 grs. , will be 1001-62x 1'0011437=1002-766 grs. Hence the specific gravity of mercury , according to the French method of determining it , will be 13631'361 =13'594 .
10021766 A determination by Regnault gives 13*596 .
These two results agree very nearly with one another ; and this agreement tends not only to verify the correctness of Regnault 's determination , but to show that Regnault 's Table of the dilatation of mercury , and Despretz 's Table of the dilatation of water , agree together ; a remark that had been previously made by Dr. Matthiessen in a paper which he recently presented to the Society .
