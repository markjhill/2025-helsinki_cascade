An Account of a Family having Hands and Feet with supernumerary Fingers and Toes .
By Anthony Carlisle , Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter addressed to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. K.B. P.R.S. Read December 23 , 1813 .

] These instances of supernatural formation are traced , bythe author 's inquiries , through four successive generations , from Zerah Colburn , the American calculating boy , to his great grandmother , whose maiden name had been Kendall , but of whose brothers , sisters , or parents , the present generation possess no record .
This woman had five fingers and a thumb on each hand , and six toes on each foot .
She had eleven children , ten of whom are said to have had the same peculiarity complete ; but one daughter , the grandmother of the present boy , had one of her hands naturally formed .
Of the next generation there were four persons .
Abiah , the boy 's father , and two others , had the peculiarity complete ; but one of his uncles was like the grandmother , with one hand natural .
The present generation are eight in number , of whom four are naturally formed as their mother is ; the rest , including Zerah the calculator , have the peculiarity complete , with the exception of his eldest brother , who has one of his feet naturally formed .
It appears to Mr. Carlisle , that these instances are sufficiently rare to be added to the numerous cases on record of peculiar structures continued by hereditary descent , in the hope that a greater accumulation of facts may enable future physiologists to trace , in some degree , the laws which govern such productions ; more especially if attention be paid to the relative influence of the male and female sex in the propagation of peculiarities .
