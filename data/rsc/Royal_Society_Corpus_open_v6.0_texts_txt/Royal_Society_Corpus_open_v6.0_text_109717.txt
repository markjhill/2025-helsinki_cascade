] As M. Arbogast is the only author who has cultivated this part of analysis with any great success , it appeared desirable to the author to take a different view of the same subject , in order to confirm Arbogast 's results ' by a different mode of obtaining them .
His own method has also the further advantage of arriving at several new and remarkable theorems ( particularly with respect to inverse derivation ) , which probably could not be found by the method of M. Arbogast .
As far as concerns the functions of a single multinomial , the rules are the same as those of Arbogast ; but in the more difficult cases of double and triple multinomials and functions of any number of them , the methods of the author are professed to be new and expeditious ; and they are demonstrated with a great degree of facility and simplicity , from the analogy which reigns throughout his manner of treating the subject , and which enables the reader more readily to retain the rules in his memory .
