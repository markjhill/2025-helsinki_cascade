( Abstract .
) In this memoir the following reactions have been studied:1 .
The Action of Hydrochloric and Hydriodic Acids on Opianic Acid .
When strong hydrochloric or hydriodic acid acts at 100 ?
for some time on opianic acid , iodide or chloride of methyl is evolved and a new acid formed , Cl100I , O + IC1 C,0 C-IO + CH3CI , We propose to call this acid methyl nor-opianic acid , as it stands intermediate between opianic acid and the normal opianic acid : Normal opianic acid..C..1 ... ... ... ... CO Methyl nor-opianic acid ... ... ... ... ... C Opianic acid or dimethyl nor-opianic acid. .
CoHIoO0 The new acid is soluble in cold water , but much more so in hot , from which it crystallizes on cooling with 2molecules of water .
Like hypogallic acid it strikes a dark blue with sesquichloride of iron ; but on addition of ammonia in excess , a light-red solution is produced , differing , therefore , from the hypogallic-acid blue , with which ammonia becomes bloodred .
From the analysis of the silver-salt it appears that methyl noropianic acid is monobasic .
2 .
The Action of Hydrochloric and Hydriodic Acids on Meconin .
When meconin is heated with strong hydrochloric or hydriodic acids at 100 ?
for some time , it is split up into chloride or iodide of methyl and an acid of the composition Co98HO .
The reaction is Co , EAO + HC1= ClH=C180 + C1-C1 .
This new acid we may call methyl normeconic acid , as it stands between meconin and normal meconin : Meconin ... ... ... -- ... ... ... ..*. .
11 Co10H04 Methyl nor-meconii or methyl nor-meconic acid .
C , Hs O , Normal meconin ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
CH0 Methyl nor-meconic acid is soluble in cold , but much more so in hot water ; it is easily soluble in alcohol , and slightly so in ether .
It reduces solutions of silver-salts in the cold , and behaves with sesquichloride of iron exactly like methyl nor-opianic acid .
From the analysis of the bariumsalt , methyl nor-meconic acid is monobasic .

The Action of Hydrochloric and Hydriodic Acids on Hemipinic Acid .
The action of hydriodic acid on hemipinic acid , has been already described in our former communication .
The reaction which takes place was found to be C0loHl100 + 2HI = CO , +2CH113 +C,7H0 .
The body C7H04 , we called hypogallic acid .
It was also mentioned that when hydrochloric acid acts on hemipinic acid the following reaction takes place : CloH10 , o + HC1 = CO,2 + CH3C1 + CsH80 , .
The formula C,1104 has been confirmed by further analyses , and from the analysis of its silver-salt we have shown it to be a monobasic acid .
This acid may be called methyl-hypogallic acid , as it contains one molecule of methyl more than the hypogallic acid , and may be converted into that acid by the prolonged action of hydrochloric acid on it .

Whilst experimenting with hemipinic acid we found that this acid may crystallize in different forms .
The crystals were found to contain different amounts of water ; thus when it crystallizes from a dilute solution by spontaneous evaporation , the crystals contain half a molecule of water ; when from a supersaturated solution , they contain one molecule ; and lastly , when crystallized in the ordinary way by cooling a hot solution , they contain two and a half molecules .
From the experiments here , as well as those in our former paper , it appears that the following compounds derived from opianic acid will be found to exist:-Co1011 104 C 101 10 C , H,1oO Dimethyl nor-meconin Dimethyl nor-opianic acid Dimethyl nor-hemipinic acid ( ordinary meconin ) .
( ordinary opianic acid ) .
( ordinary hemipinic acid ) .
CH80 , C , H80 C9IO80 Methyl nor-meconin .
Methyl nor-opianic acid .
Methyl nor-hemipinic acid .
C8116014 0605 CH1 C,606 Nor-meconin .
Nor-opianic acid .
Nor-hemipinic acid .
C81180 , CsH811 C5s104 Methyl hypogallic acid .
C7H62 C-T7O C7 , H , O Hypogallic acid .
Of the above , the following have been prepared : I. C , oH1O04 , C1oH10o6 by the action of potash on opianic acid ; thus , 12 Clo0-O = olO4 + C10 H O,6 .
2 .
C9H110 by the action of hydrochloric and hydriodic acids on meconin ; thus , CoI , o 1-HI=0 C , HO04 + CH3I .
3 .
CG9H80 by the action of hydrochloric or hydriodic acids on opianic acid ; thus , CoH , ,oO H I= C , H805 C H31 .
40 4 .
C8IIsO by the action of hydrochloric on hemipinic acid ; thus , 10H30 o+ HC-= CsH8O+ C0+C HC1 .
5 .
C7H604 by the action of hydriodic acid on hemipinic acid ; thus , C10HO , +2H I= C,7HO +C O+ 2C H , I. In the second part of the paper the properties and the preparation of a new base prepared from narcotine are described .
When narcotine is heated for from six to eight days with strong hydrochloric acid at 100 ?
, two molecules of chloride of methyl are given off , and the chloride of the new base formed .
The reaction which takes place is C22H23N O7 +2 HC1=C20H1N O , +2C H3C1 .
This base we have called methyl-nor-narcotine ; it forms an almost white amorphous powder insoluble in water and ether , slightly soluble in alcohol ; it is easily soluble in carbonate of sodium , by which means it may be separated from narcotine .
None of its salts form crystalline compounds ( the chloride , sulphate , and nitrate have been made ) .
In the paper of which this is an abstract , mention is made of two other new bases derived from narcotine ; these have not as yet been described .
They are the dimethyl and nor-narcotines , the first being the product of the action of hydrochloric acid for a short time on narcotine , and the latter the product of the action of strong hydriodic acid on narcotine .
The reactions may be written C22H123N 07+HC1=C2 , H2N O7+CH3C1 and C22H23N 07+3H I= C1H17N 0 , + 3CHsI .
There exist , therefore , four narcotines:-1 .
Ordinary narcotine , or trimethyl nor-narcotine , C22H23N 0 , .
2 .
, , , , dimethyl nor-narcotine , C2lH21N O7 .
3 .
, , , , methyl nor-narcotine , C2H119N 07 .
4 .
, , , , nor-narcotine , C19H,7N 07 ?
The descriptions and properties of the first-mentioned new bases will form the subject of a future communication .
