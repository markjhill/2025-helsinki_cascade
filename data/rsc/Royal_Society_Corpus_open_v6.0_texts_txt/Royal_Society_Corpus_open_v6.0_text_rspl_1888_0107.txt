" On the Wave-length of the Principal Line in the Spectrum of the Aurora .
" By William Huggins , D.C.L. , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received February 19 , 1889 .
Notwithstanding the large number of determinations by different observers , since Angstrom in 1867 , of the wave-length of the principal ( and frequently the only ) line in the spectrum of the Aurora , this value has not yet been accepted as definitely fixed with the degree of accuracy which is required for a final inquiry into its chemical origin .
The uncertainty within rather wide limits , which seems still to obtain , has arisen mainly from the circumstance that in nearly all cases the observations have been made with a small direct-vision spectroscope , and under conditions which do not admit of an accurate determination of the value sought for .
About half the number of some twenty-four observers agree pretty well , but among the results given by the others the differences are very large in relation to the accuracy which is required , though they are not greater , perhaps , than was to be expected from the circumstances under which the observations were made .
I think it is very desirable , therefore , that I should put on record some observations of the spectrum of the Aurora which I made in the year 1874 , but which up to the present time have remained unpublished .
These observations were made with a powerful spectroscope , and under conditions which enabled me to determine the wave-length of the principal line within narrow limits of error .
Th* spectroscope was made by Sir Howard Grubb on the automatic principle of his father , Mr. Thomas Grubb .
It is furnished with two " Grubb " compound prisms ; each has 5 square inches of base , an gives nearly twice the dispersion of a single prism of 60 ' , namely* about 9 ' 6 ' from A to H. The object-glasses of the collimator and telescope are 1*25 inch1 1889 .

431 diameter .
The definition is very good .
Though the automatic arrangement works well , I always take the precaution to measure only small differences of position of the line to be determined from lines near it , the wave-lengths of which are known .
The observations were made on February 4 , 1874 .
There was a brilliant Aurora , showing a whitish light ; a direct-vision spectroscope resolved this light into a brilliant line in the yellow and a faint continuous spectrum .
The " Grubb " spectroscope was directed from the window of the observatory upon the brightest part of the Aurora .
In the first instance , an estimation by eye was made of the position of the bright line by comparing it in the instrument with the spectrum of a spirit lamp .
The bright line was seen to fall on the more refrangible side of the line for which Watts gives the wave-length 5582 , * Angstrom and Thalen 5583 , t by from one-fifth to one-fourth of the distance of this line from the beginning of the band .
If we take one-fourth , we have A 5569*6 ; one-fifth gives A 5572*3 .
The mean of these values gives for the Aurora line X 5570*9 ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
( 1 ) .
The cross-wires of the spectroscope were then brought upon the line , and the reading 3476 showed the line to fall about midway between two strong lines in the spectrum of tin , A. 5564 and A 5587 respectively , according to my measures .
J The position of the cross was then compared directly with those lines in the spectrum of an induction spark taken between electrodes of tin .
The further details ot this comparison are not given in my note-book , but the result 'uly , which placed the Aurora line at A 5571 ... ... ... ... ... ... .
( 2 ) .
Consulting my map of the chemical elements , I found that there was a line of tellurium very near this place , namely , at A 5575 , I therefore brought the spark from tellurium before the slit , when the cross appeared on the more refrangible side of the tellurium line .
Ihe measure of the distance of the cross from this line came out equal to A ( \gt ; 003 .
The place given in my paper for this line of tellurium is 5575 .
Thalen gives for the same line 5574*1.S If we take the wean of these values and deduct 0003 , we get for The line of the Aurora A 5571'5 ... ... ... ... . .

The cross , after having been placed upon the line of the Aurora , was confronted with these lines in the spectrum of iron .

Among the numerous determinations of other observers , those of Professor H. C. Vogel in 1872* seem to me to have great weight .
A direct-vision spectroscope with a set of five prisms was used .
The reduction of the readings of the micrometer into wave-lengths was based upon the repeated measures of 100 lines of the solar spectrum .
The screw had been thoroughly examined .
After each observation of the Aurora line , readings were taken of the lines of sodium or of hydrogen .
The observations extended over four nights .
On three nights four separate readings were obtained ; on the fourth night two only .
Vogel gives as the mean result of the fourteen observations , Aurora line A 5571*3 + 0*92 ... ... ... ... .W* Perhaps I should state that I find , from a remark in my note-hook , that at the time of my observations in 1874 I was not aware 0 Vogel 's results , and I could not , therefore , have been biassed in any way by them .

On the Wave-length of the [ Mar. 7 , Now , though Angstrom 's original value X 5567 may not be quite accurate , his observation fixed a limit towards the red beyond which the Aurora line cannot lie .
Angstrom says , " sa lumiere etait presque monochromatique , et consistait d'une seule raie brillante situee a gauche " ( on the more refrangible side ) " du groupe connu des raies du calcium."* The position of the most refrangible line of .

... ... 5581*0 It is certain , therefore , from Angstrom 's first observation in 1867 alone , that the Aurora line lies well on the more refrangible side of wave-length 5580 .
This limit towards the red was confirmed afterwards by Angstrom himself ; he says later that the yellow line falls almost midway between the second and third line of the shaded carbon group .
J The positions of these lines of comparison are , according to Angstrom and Thalen , X 5538 and X 5583.S It follows that KrafEt 's values , X 5586 , X 5587 , and X 5595 , must be from some cause inaccurate .
A possible explanation may bo found in the small number of solar lines employed by Krafit for the reduction of the measures into wave-lengths .
The curve was drawn through the six Fraunhofer lines B , 0 , a , D , B , and 6 .
There was no control for the curve between D and E , and a very small deviation of the curve from its true position here would be sufficient to account for the position of less refrangibility of from X 0016 to X 0024 , which his measures give for the Aurora line .
It should be stated that Krafit expresses regret that more attention could not be given to the spectroscopic observations .
He says:\#151 ; " Leider gestatteten die obligatorisehen Beobachtungen nicht , den spectroscopischen Untersuchungen die gehorige Aufcnerksamkeit angedeihen zu lassen . . . . .
Ich glaubte ausserdem Wip Messungen um so mehr auslassen zu konnen , als der Platz derge-wohnlichen Nordlichtlinie oft und sehr genau bestimmt ist .

] principal Line in the Spectrum of the Aurora .
These values agree closely , and fix within very narrow limits , the position in the spectrum , where we have to seek the chemical origin of the line .
Gyllenskiold , from his observations of the changes which occur in the spectrum of the Aurora , comes to the conclusion that : " le spectre de l'Aurore boreale resulte de la superposition de plusieurs spectres differents , " and that " la raie principal form un de ces spectres elementaires ; elle apparait tres souvent seule .
" A similar view was taken many years ago by Angstrom* and by Vogel , f [ After consideration , I think that I ought to point out that Mr. Loekyer 's recent statement J that:\#151 ; " The characteristic line of the aurora is the remnant of the brightest manganese fluting at 558 , " is clearly inadmissible , considering the evidence we have of the position of this line .
In support of this statement Mr. Lockyer says :\#151 ; " Angstrom gave the wave-length of the line as 5567 , and since then many observers have given the same wave-length for it , but probably without making independent determinations .
Piazzi Smyth , however , gives it as 558 " which agrees exactly with the bright edge of the manganese fluting .
R. H. Proctor also gives the line as a little less refrangible than Angstrom 's determination .
He says:\#151 ; ' My own measures give me a wave-length very slightly greater than those of Winlock and Angstrom ' ( 'Nature , ' vol. 3 , p. 468 ) .
" By reference to Gyllenskiold 's table it will be seen that the probable errors of the determinations by Piazzi Smyth and Proctor , 5579 + 9'5 and 5595 + 25'0 respectively , S are too large to entitle these measures to special weight .
Mr. Lockyer says further :\#151 ; " Gyllenskiold 's measures with the Wrede spectroscope also give 5580 as the wave-length of the characteristic line .
I feel justified , therefore , in disregarding the difference between the wave-length of the edge of the manganese fluting and the generally accepted wave-length of the aurora line .
" j Gyllenskiold 's single measure of 5580 , on which Mr. Lockyer relies , I '\#174 ; er\#174 ; widely from the values which Gyllenskiold himself assigns 0 line , namely , from observations at Cape Thordsen in 1882 , 5568 + 1*6 , and from observations at Upsala in 1884 , with the Wrede spectroscope , X 5569 + 6*2 .

[ Mar. 7 , lengths obtained for the aurora line were 5595 , 5586 , and 5587 .
Unlike most observations , these place the aurora line on the less refrangible side of the manganese fluting .
Hence , we have an addi-tional reason for neglecting the difference between the wave-length of the brightest edge of the manganese fluting , and the commonly accepted wave-length of the aurora line , as given by Angstrom .
These observations are the latest which have been pub-lished , and were obviously made with a full knowledge of all previous work , so that their importance must be strongly insisted upon .
" I have already pointed out that Krafft 's measures were not made under circumstances which assured to them a high degree of accuracy j and Krafft 's own words , which I have quoted , disclaim expressly any special attempt on his part to redetermine the position of the principal line with a higher degree of accuracy than the observers who preceded him.\#151 ; March 4 .
