[ Feb. 23 , roots , or only feebly developed on the dorsal side .
The cortical layer next to the exodermis constitutes itself into a cork-cambium ; and in the pitcher-roots a secondary cork-cambium arises within the bands of sclerenchyma .
Cork is not formed on the distal parts of the pitcher-roots , nor within the most ventral portion of the climbing roots .
Sometimes there is a group of large wood-vessels in the ventral portion of the vascular cylinder .
The points especially worthy of note in the roots of Rafflesiana are\#151 ; 1 .
The early cuticularisation of the root-hairs , and the long persistence of these structures , which , in climbing roots , remain to function as anchoring threads .
2 .
The curious passage-cells of the exodermis , which do not possess thin cellulose-walls .
3 .
The precocious development of cork to prevent excessive loss of water .
4 .
The radial structure and large sclerenchyma-bands of the pitcher-roots .
, 5 .
The dorsi-ventral structure of the climbing roots , as revealed in the formation of root-hairs and cork ; also as seen in the structure of the cortex and even of the vascular cylinder .
