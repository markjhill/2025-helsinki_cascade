" On the Anatomy and Physiology of the Decidua .
" By Ro ?
bert Lee , M.D. , F.R.S. In this paper , the author describes some appearances which he has observed in the structure of the human decidua , and which ap ?
parently prove that the circulation of the maternal blood in the ovum is carried on during the early months of gestation , chiefly by the different layers of this membrane , and the cells of the chorion .
He has been led by his observations to the belief , that the veins of the uterine decidua convey blood from the deciduai cavity into the veins of the uterus ; and that , in all probability , a current of ma ?
ternal blood is constantly flowing from the cells of the chorion , through the decidua reflexa , into the deciduai cavity .
