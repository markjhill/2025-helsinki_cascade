The remarkable development of exogenous woody structures in most members of the entire family indicates the necessity of ceasing to apply either to them or to their living representatives the term Acrogenous .
Hence the author proposes a division of the vascular Cryptogams into an exogenous group , containing diacece , Equisetacece , and the fossil Calamitacea , and an endogenous group , containing the ferns ; the former uniting the Cryptogams with the Exogens through the Gycadece and other Gymnosperms , and the latter linking them with the Endogens through the Palmacece .

It has been shown in Part I. of this research * that the action of hydrobromic acid on codeia gives rise , without evolution of methyl bromide , firstly to bromocodide , and secondly to two other new bases termed respectively deoxycodeia and bromotetracodeia , the latter of which , under the influence of hydrochloric acid , exchanges bromine for chlorine , yielding a corresponding chlorinated base , chlorotetracodeia ; when , however , the action of hydrobromic acid is prolonged , methyl bromide is evolved in some little quantity .
By digesting codeia with three or four times its weight of 48 per cent , acid for five or six hours on the water-bath , vapours were evolved which condensed by the application of a freezing-mixture to a colourless mobile liquid , the boiling-point of which was found to be 10o,5 to 11'*5 , and the vapour of which burnt with a yellow-edged flame , and exploded violently with oxygen , forming carbonic and hydrobromic acids .
It becomes , therefore , of interest to examine in detail the action of hydrobromic acid on each of the three bodies produced from codeia under its influence .

Action of Hydrobromic Acid on Bromotetracodeia .
When bromotetracodeia hvdrobromate is heated in a sealed tube to 100 ' with four or five times its weight of 48 per cent , bydrobromic acid for from six to ten hours , methyl bromide is found as a thin layer on the top of the tarry contents of the tube after cooling ; by dissolving this tarry substance in water and fractionally precipitating the liquid by strong hydrobromic acid several times successively , nearly white amorphous flakes are ultimately obtained , resembling in all their physical and chemical properties the bromotetracodeia hydrobromate originally employed .

product , dissolved in warm water and precipitated by sodium carbonate , is for the most part insoluble in ether , the insoluble portion having all the properties of bromotetramorphia ; the ethereal extract shaken with H. Cl or H Br yields a viscid liquid , which , on standing , becomes filled with crystals consisting apparently of a mixture of the hydrochlorates or hy-drobromates of deoxycodeia and a lower homologue , the latter predominating when the digestion is performed in an open flask .
Attempts to prevent the formation of the lower homologue by continuing the digestion with H Br for only two or three hours did not succeed , as the large quantity of unaltered bromocodide in the ether extract obtained prevents the separation of the crystalline hydrochlorate or hydrobromate of deoxycodeia , and hitherto no method of separating the deoxycodeia salt from its lower homologue has been arrived at .

Wright on the Action of [ June 15 From the above numbers , and more especially from the percentages of H , Cl , and Br found , it appears that while specimen A may have contained some little quantity of deoxycodeia , specimen B must have consisted almost wholly of the lower homologue ; to this body the name deoxymor-phia may appropriately be given ( provisionally ) , to indicate that its composition bears the same relation to that of morphia as deoxycodeia to codeia .
The numbers required for apomorphia salts are very close to those actually obtained above , viz. for hydrochlorate C=67*22 , H=5'93 , Cl = 11*70 ; and for hydrobromate C=58'62 , H = 5'17 , Br=22 99 ; but the entire absence of emetic properties in all these specimens , as observed by Dr. Michael Foster , conclusively proves that this base could not have been present .
Further research is required before it can be decided with certainty which of the three oxygen atoms in codeia is removed in the formation of deoxycodeia ; the production of deoxymorphia with simultaneous evolution of methyl bromide , however , indicates that the oxygen that links the methyl group to the rest of the codeia residue is still present in deoxycodeia and deoxymorphia , while the production of both from bromocodide renders the following formulae probable :\#151 ; Codeia .

By the action of hydriodic acid on codeia methyl is eliminated as iodide , and the elements of free hydrogen and those of HI are added on to this group ; from which , as well as from the easy polymerization to form tetracodeia bases , it appears probable that some at least of the 17 carbon atoms are connected together somewhat after the fashion of ethylene or acrylic acid , which unite readily with HI , HBr , Ha , \amp ; c. Again , the oxidizing action of Ag N 03 on chlorotetramorphia is accompanied by the production of C02 , which renders it not improbable that the third oxygen atom exists either as the group [ CH(OH ) ] ' or as co " .

On carefully examining , side by side , the qualitative reactions of the 1871.1 Hydrobromic Acid on Codeia and its derivatives .
hydrochlorate B and those of a specimen of pure deoxycodeia-salt from codeia ( without evolution of methyl bromide ) , not the slightest difference was discernible between the two ; in their physiological actions , too , as observed by Dr. Michael Foster , the two bodies seem perfectly alike , both being utterly dissimilar from apomorphia , from which in all other respects ( qualitative reactions , percentage composition , \amp ; c. ) they differ either not at all or extremely little .
The portion insoluble in ether of the batch from which hydrochlorate B was obtained was treated with HC1 and fractionally precipitated by strong acid several times successively ; this mode of treatment was adopted rather than that with HBr , as a much larger yield is obtained thus , the hydrochlorates of chlorotetracodeia and chlorotetramorphia being much less soluble in dilute HC1 than the corresponding brominated bodies are in dilute HBr .
Finally , nearly white flakes were obtained presenting all the characters of chlorotetramorphia hydrochlorate , and yielding the following numbers after drying at 100':\#151 ; 0*2480 grm. gave 0*5610 C02 and 0*1410 H2 O. 0*1390 grm. gave 0*0755 AgCl .

Of these two views , the first involves only known substances and reactions similar to those already known in the codeia series of derivatives , Action of Hydrobromic Acid on Codeia fyc .
[ June 15 , and is , moreover , probable from the circumstance that the numbers obtained in some instances indicate the presence of deoxycodeia as well as deoxymorphia ; whilst the second view involves the not improbable existence of bromomorphide , 0l7H18BrNO2 ; on the other hand , it will be shown in the next section that equation ( III .
) represents a reaction which does not readily take place with deoxycodeia , when notin the nascent condition at any rate .
Whichever view be adopted , the ultimate formation of bromotetramorphia requires the action of water on a brominated body , substituting hydroxyl for bromine by a reaction perfectly parallel to that whereby codeia is regenerated from chlorocodide by the action of water * , viz. C13H20 Cl no2+h2o=hci+c18 h21no3 .

Action of Hydrobromic Acid on Deoxycodeia .
In the hope that this action would give rise to methyl bromide and deoxymorphia , deoxycodeia hydrobromate was heated to 100 ' for two hours with about five parts of 48 per cent. HBr ; no change whatever took place , no methyl bromide being found on opening the tube in which the digestion was carried on after complete cooling .
After an hour 's additional exposure to a temperature of 120'\#151 ; 130 ' , the contents of the tube were found to have become black and tarry , while a small quantity of methyl bromide floated on the top .
Precipitated by sodium carbonate , a very dirty substance was obtained , which was almost insoluble in ether ; the etherial extract , shaken with HBr , gave a small quantity of a tarry hydrobromate , of which 0*1330 grm. gave 0*0790 AgBr or B'r= 25*20 per cent , deoxymorphia hydrobromate requiring only 22* 8$ per cent. Nothing fit for analysis could be obtained from the portion insoluble in ether , and the minute yield of pure deoxycodeia from codeia precluded a repetition of the experiment .

On the Physiological Action of the foregoing Codeia .
* By Michael .
Foster , M.A. , M.D. The hydrochlorate of chlorotetracodeia and the hydrobromate of bromotetramorphia , in doses of a decigramme by subcutaneous injection or by the mouth , produced in adult cats in a very few minutes a condition of great excitement , almost amounting to delirium , accompanied by a copious flow of saliva and great dilatation of the pupils .
Micturation and defsecation occurred in some instances , and vomiting was observed on two occasions with the morphia-salt , but was very slight .
The excitement was very peculiar , being apparently due partly to increased sensitiveness to noises , and partly to an impulse to rush about .
The same doses of the morphia-salt given to a young kitten produced the same flow of saliva , dilatation of pupils , and excitement ( without vomiting ) ; * Matthiessen and Wright , Proc. Roy .
Soc. vol. xviii .

1871* ] On Intensity of Daylight in Eclipse of 1870 .
but the stage of excitement , which in adult cats passed gradually off in a few hours , was followed by a condition marked by a want of coordination of muscular movements , and presenting the most grotesque resemblance to certain stages of alcoholic intoxication .
This stage was followed in turn by sleepiness and stupor , in which the kitten was left at night ; in the morhing it was found dead .
Two observations have shown that these salts paralyze ( in dogs and cats ) the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric ; they also seem to lower the internal tension , but want of material has prevented me from ascertaining how this is brought about .
On rabbits neither salt , even in doses of a decigramme , seems to have any effect , except perhaps a slight excitement .
There is no dilatation of the pupils , no flow of saliva , and , if one observation can be trusted , no paralysis of the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric .
No marked difference was observable between the two salts , except that the morphia-salts seemed rather more potent than the corresponding codeia bodies .
V The salts of deoxycodeia and deoxymorphia given by mouth or by subcutaneous injection in doses of a decigramme , produced in adult cats , almost immediately after exhibition , a series of convulsions much more epileptic in character than tetanic .
In one case there was a distinct rotatory movement .
In a few minutes these convulsions passed away , leaving the animal exhausted and frightened .
Then followed a stage of excitement with dilated pupils and flow of saliva , very similar to the effects of the tetra-codeia and tetramorphia salts , but less marked .
Doses of half a decigramme given to adult cats produced the stage of excitement only , without the convulsions .
In no case , with any specimen of product , has vomiting been witnessed ; like the tetracodeia and tetramorphia products , the deoxycodeia and deoxymorphia salts appear to paralyze the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric .
Trials with rabbits gave only negative results .
No marked differences could be observed between the hydrochlorates and hydrobromates of deoxycodeia or deoxymorphia .
