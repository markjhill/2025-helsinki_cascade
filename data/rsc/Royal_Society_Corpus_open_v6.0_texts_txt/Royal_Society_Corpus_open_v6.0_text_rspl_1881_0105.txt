Communicated by Professor G. D. Living , F.R.S. Received January 13 , 1882 .
Various compounds of urea with metallic salts and oxides have been described by Werther and Liebig .
Some of these are suggestive of an analogy between urea and ammonia , while others seem altogether anomalous .
The following account of some chromium compounds of urea may help to throw some light on the nature of such compounds , for they appear to show that a very definite base is formed by a combination of urea with chromium .
When powdered and carefully dried urea is moistened with chromyl dichloride , and the mixture vigorously shaken , the temperature rises considerably , and on treating the resulting mass with water , there remains undissolved , a green crystalline powder .
The nature of the green salt thus obtained is at present under investigation .
It is insoluble in alcohol , ether , and chloroform .
It dissolves in hot watei with decomposition , another salt separating out as the liquid cools in brilliant olive-green needles , which by a second crystallisation is obtained in a pure state .
The examination of this body showed it to be the dichromate of a base containing the elements of urea and chromium , and to have the formula { ( CON3H4)13Cr2 } ( Cr307)33H30 .
The dichromate thus obtained is sparingly soluble in cold , more freely in hot water , and is decomposed by boiling the solution .
Its aqueous solution gives green crystalline precipitates with platinic chloride and potassium ferrocyanide , but none with ammonia .
The following results were obtained on analysis :\#151 ; The numbers given refer to the dried salt , unless expressly stated to the contrary .

When a hot solution of the dichromate is mixed with a solution of platinic chloride , and the mixture allowed to cool , the chloroplatinate crystallises out in long green silky needles .
The compound is moderately soluble in hot , but very sparingly in cold water .
The sparing solubility in cold water was made use of in preparing the bulk of this salt from washings and drainings from other compounds .
After one or two crystallisations from hot water , the compound is obtained in a state of purity .
The examination of the body led to the formula { ( OON\#187 ; H1)lsOr .

The Chloride .
This compound may be obtained from the original green body , or from the dichromate , by treatment with water and lead chloride .
The lead chromate is filtered off , and from the filtrate the chloride is precipitated in fine silky needles by passing in hydrochloric acid gas .
The compound recrystallised from warm water is deposited in long bright green prismatic crystals , having the composition ( CON 2H4 ) 12Cr2Cl66H20 .
It is freely soluble in hot water , less readily in cold , the compound being decomposed by boiling its solution .
Its aqueous solution is precipitated by potassium dichromate , the compound precipitated being similar in every respect to the dichromate just described .
It also gives precipitates with platinic chloride and potassium ferro-cyanide , but none with ammonia , until the compound has been destroyed by boiling or otherwise .
The compound is almost completely precipitated from its aqueous solution by the addition of hydrochloric acid .

This compound is readily obtained from the preceding , by the action of silver sulphate .
The silver chloride is filtered off , and the solution concentrated at a gentle heat or in vacuo .
If the warm solution of the chloride be rubbed up in a mortar with the proper quantity of silver sulphate , a crop of crystals of this compound is deposited after filtration , on cooling , in short dark green prisms .
The crystals have the composition ( CON3H4)12Cr3(SO4)310H3O .

273 The Nitrate .
This compound is readily obtained from the dichromate or chloride by nitrate of silver .
If the solutions used are warm and fairly con-centrated , a good crop of crystals is deposited on cooling after filtration The salt separates from the warm saturated solution , or by spontaneous evaporation in large , well-defined , dark green prisms which are anhydrous , and may be represented by the formula ( COJN2H.4)12 Oo(NO )g- The following determinations were-made : 1 .
*449 grm. crystallised salt lost no appreciable quantity of water at 104 ' C. , and is therefore anhydrous .

104-8 35 *46 35-09 8-94 1196 *8 The Hydroxide .
A mixture of the dichromate , cold water , and a slight excess of pure precipitated lead hydroxide , rubbed together in a mortar , the lead chromate removed by .
filtration and any excess of lead by a drop of the dichromate , yields a bright green strongly alkaline solution .
This solution appears to contain the hydroxide of the same base as the salts just described , for they are easily obtained from it by suitable reagents .
A precisely similar solution may be obtained from the sulphate by means of barium hydroxide .
The compound , however , is slowly decomposed in the cold , more rapidly on heating , the solution losing its alkalinity , chromic hydroxide separating out and urea remaining in solution .
If the green aqueous solution be mixed with alcohol , most of the hydroxide is deposited as a light green precipitate , which may be collected , redissolved in water , and reprecipitated by alcohol unchanged .
It is , however , difficult to prevent some decomposition occurring , especially in drying .
On this account , I have not at present succeeded in isolating it in a sufficiently pure state for analysis .

[ Jan. 26 Up to the present time , no compounds of chromium with ammonia have .
been described , which are analogous in composition to those forming the subject of this paper .
The metal cobalt , however , forms , with ammonia the base of Fremy 's well-known series of luteocobaltie salts , to which these compounds bear a marked resemblance .

" On the Spectrum of Water .

Received January 14 , 1882 .
In our former communication on the subject of the water spectrum ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. , vol. 30 , p. 580 ) we stated that the spectrum we then figured did not by any means exhaust the spectra of flames we had observed , but it was as much as we had at that time been able to trace to water as its cause .
We had , in fact , noticed in the spectrum of coal-gas and hydrogen-flames a still more refrangible but less intense series of lines ; and we have since observed that this second series is produced under the same circumstances as the first , and we therefore ascribe it to the same cause , namely , the incandescent vapour of water .
It is easily produced not only by the flames just mentioned , but by the arc of a De Meritens machine when a current of steam is passed into it , and by the spark of an induction coil without jar in moist air or other moist gas .
When a large coil and jar are used it almost or wholly disappears .
