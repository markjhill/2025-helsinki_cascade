On the late Extraordinary Depression of the Barometer .
By Luke Howard , Esq. F.R.S. Read January 24 , 1822 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1822 , p. 113 .
] On the evening of the 24th of December last , Mr. Howard found the barometer at his house at Tottenham Green at 28'20 inches .
The wind was moderate at S.E. , the temperature 450 , and water boiled freely at 210 ? .
At 11 r.M. the barometer fell to 27-96 inches , and at 5 A.M. on the 25th to 27'82 , below which the author thinks it did not descend .
By 8 A.M. it again reached 28 .
In the twentyfour hours preceding , 08 inch rain had fallen , but in the twentyfour hours following there fell none , nor was the wind strong .
By midnight on the 25th the quicksilver reached 28-07 inches , and remained there during the twelve hours following , -a thing very rare in our climate .
The quicksilver then rose in an uninterrupted curve , and on the 31st touched upon 30 inches , with fine weather .
A diagram showing the state of the barometer during the last two months of 1821 , as well as the quarter of the wind and quantity of rain fallen , accompanies this paper .
During these two months the rain amounted to 10*10 inches , a quantity without precedent in the same space of time at London .
