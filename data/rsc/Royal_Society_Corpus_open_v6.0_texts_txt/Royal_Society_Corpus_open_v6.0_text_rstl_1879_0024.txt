248 ZOOLOGY OF KERGUELEN ISLAND .
surface of puddles and tide-pools .
Near Observatory Bay the fly was common upon some small isolated rocks which were always submerged at high water .
The adults in that locality must spend a large portion of their lives under water , and hence the species was named H. amphibius .
All of them were females ; none were actually seen beneath the surface .
Probably whenever the water has retired sufficiently from the top of the rocks , all the flies hurry up from below to take an airing .
It is rather likely that the males have fully developed wings , and are able to fly .

The true Neuroptera of Kerguelen Island are as plentiful as the snakes of Iceland ; and it is doubtful whether there is any representative of this order indigenous to it , unless the Mallophaga\gt ; which must be placed somewhere , are reckoned as members of it .
Por the species of the Psocidce cited above , described from a single example taken at Molloy Point , and mounted on glass in balsam as a microscopic object , is of uncertain nationality , and may have accompanied the American Transit of Venus Expedition from Washington .
