On Scandium .

] Scandia is one of the rarest and least known of the recognised rare earths .
It was discovered in 1879 by Nilson , who separated it , with ytterbia , from erbia extracted from euxenite and gadolinite .
Nilson made an incomplete chemical examination of some of its compounds , but owing to the inadequate amount of material at his disposal he did not at first entirely separate it from ytterbia .
Later in the same year Cleve extracted scandia from gadolinite , yttrotitanite , and keilhauite , and described the scandium sulphate , double sulphates , nitrate , oxalate , double oxalates , selenate , acetate , formate , oxide , and hydrate , and gave some of the chief reactions of the new body .
Cleve , working on gadolinite , found that it contained only from 0'002 to 0*003 per cent , of scandium , while keilhauite yielded only about 0*005 per cent. He gave results from which he deduced an atomic weight of about 45 .
Cleve noticed that scandium almost exactly corresponded to the description given by Mendeleeff of his hypothetical element " ekaboron , " of atomic weight 44 .
More recently , in 1880 , Nilson , working on somewhat larger quantities of scandia , described and analysed the nitrate , sulphate , selenate , oxalate , and the potassium double sulphate .
He found the atomic weight to be 44*03 , the mean of four separate and closely concordant determinations .
Taking Nilson 's data , and re-calculating from them the atomic weight of scandium , using the most recent figures for oxygen and sulphur , I find his atomic weight to be almost exactly 44*1\#151 ; a figure I have used in the following paper .
In the course of my 20 years ' work on the fractionation of the rare earths I have repeatedly tested my products by examining their photographed spectra , using the dominant lines of the various elements as tests for their presence .
Scandium has an extremely characteristic group of lines in its spectrum , situated between wave-length 3535*864 and wave-length 3651*983 , the strongest being at 3613*984 , midway between two strong iron lines .
By using a part of the spectrum in which this line occupies the centre of the photograph , it is easy to recognise scandium .
Detecting the dominant line , the presence of scandium can be verified by reference to the other lines of the group .
( See the plate at the end of this paper .

Scandium I found in some of my fractions , but only in small quantities .
A few years ago I commenced an examination of all the obtainable rare-earth minerals , in order to see if any of them showed more than a examined were :\#151 ; trace of scandium .
The minerals ZEschynite Homolite Thalenite Allanite Keilhauite Thorianite Alvite Knopite Thorite Auerlite Koppite Thorogummite Baddeleite ( Ceylon ) Lanthanite Tseheffkinite Bastnasite Monazite Tysonite Broggerite Mosandrite Urdite Cerite Orangite Wiikite Cleveite Orthite Xenotime Columbite Polycrase Yttergarnet Cryptolite Pyrochlore Yttrialite Eudialite Rhabdophane Yttrocerite Euxenite Samarskite Yttrogummite Fergusonite ( Ceylon ) Scheelite ( Bohemia ) Yttrotantalite Fergusonite ( Ytterby ) Scheelite ( New Zealand ) Yttrotitanite Fluocerite Schorlomite Zirkelite ( Ceylon , sp. gr. 5'0 ) Gadolinite Sipylite Zirkelite ( Ceylon , sp. gr. 4'42 ) Hielmite Tantalite Of these minerals scandium was detected in auerlite , cerite , cryptolite , keilhauite , koppite , mosandrite , orangite , orthite , pyrochlore , thorianite , thorite , urdite , and wiikite .
But while the other minerals contained less than O'Ol per cent , of scandium , wiikite was found to contain more than one hundred times that amount .
Wiikite is a black amorphous mineral found with monazite in a felspar quarry at Impilaks , Lake Ladoga , Finland .
It is named after Professor Wiik , of Helsingfors ( ' Min .
Mag. , ' vol. xiii .
, p. 379 ) .
I have compared wiikite with a large number of typical rare-earth minerals , and in appearance I find it most resembles yttrotantalite .
A thin section under the microscope looks like solidified mud .
It is quite amorphous , breaks with a conchoidal fracture , shows no crystalline structure , and has no action on polarised light .
Wiikite is somewhat radio-active .
A fragment was laid on a sheet of sensitive film\#151 ; opaque black paper intervening\#151 ; for ninety-five hours .
Subsequent development revealed a good impression , about equal in strength to what would be given by pitchblende in twenty-four hours .
The image was not uniform , and at one point radiation had spread from the mineral over the adjacent part of the sensitive film .
The specific gravity of wiikite is 4*85 .
Its hardness is 6 .
It is infusible before the blowpipe .
It is imperfectly attacked by strong mineral acids and breaks up easily when fused with potassium bisulphate .
Heated to full redness in a silica tube it gives off helium , water , and a distinct amount of sulphuretted hydrogen , followed by SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
a white sublimate .
The mineral begins to crack at a temperature a little below redness , and , at the approach of redness , gas is evolved with almost explosive violence , the mineral breaking and flying about the tube .
A fragment so treated examined under the microscope shows a surface covered with glistening points .
With a high power these points are resolved into a mass of minute cubes , curiously regular in form and appearance .
Heating drives off 5'83 per cent , of its weight ; 5*82 of the loss is water and acid vapour , the difference , 0*01 per cent. , consists chiefly of helium , with a little hydrogen , carbon dioxide , and a mere trace of neon .
The average amount of gas collected from 100 grs. of the mineral was 15*6 cc .
Sir James Dewar kindly passed the gases for me over hot oxide of copper and then through charcoal immersed in liquid air .
This should absorb and retain everything but helium and the trace of neon , The gas thus purified , after exhaustion to the most luminous point , was sealed in a double-bulb silica tube .
The spectrum , visual and photographed , was that of pure helium with a scarcely perceptible trace of neon .
Containing so many bodies , the exact separation of which one from the other is not known , it is at present impossible to give an accurate and complete analysis of wiikite .
Moreover , I find the composition varies somewhat in different samples of the mineral .
The following is considered a fair approximation of the composition of a typical specimen:\#151 ; Tantalic acid with some niobic acid ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
1.5*91 Titanic acid and zirconia ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
23*36 Earths of the cerium group ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

1*97 100*00 The percentage of scandia is too low .
Owing to the difficulty of separating it completely from the accompanying earths and metallic acids , the amount given is only that which has been obtained in an approximately pure state .
I find the following the best process to extract scandia from wiikite:\#151 ; The ground mineral is passed through an 80-mesh sieve , then mixed with five times its weight of powdered potassium bisulphate and fused in a clay crucible .
At first much frothing occurs , due to the escape of permanent gases and aqueous vapour ; this ebullition can be abated by stirring with an iron rod .
When in quiet fusion , the heat is raised to full redness for ten minutes and the liquid mass poured on an iron plate .
VOL. CCIX.----A .
D When cold , the melt is finely ground , mixed with water in the proportion of 1 kilo , to 5 litres , and mechanically agitated for about twelve hours .
It is then thrown on a linen filter and well washed .
This treatment extracts most of the rare earths , together with a little titanic , niobic , and tantalic acids and zirconia , but the bulk of these bodies is left behind .
The solution is supersaturated with ammonia and well boiled ; this treatment precipitates all the earths , together with iron , titanic acid , zirconia , \amp ; c. The precipitate of crude earths is filtered and well washed .
The precipitated crude earths are converted into oxalates by heating the pasty precipitate in a dish with crystals of oxalic acid added gradually , excess being avoided as much as possible .
When cold , the oxalates are filtered off , and the iron , \amp ; c. , in the filtrate is precipitated with ammonia .
As scandium oxalate is slightly soluble in water , the iron precipitate will contain a certain proportion , which must be kept for subsequent working up .
The washed oxalates are dried and ignited ; the resulting earths form about 17 per cent , of the mineral and contain about 7 per cent , of scandia .
The crude oxides are converted into sulphates by heating with sulphuric acid , the excess of acid being driven off by heat\#151 ; not using too high a temperature .
The dry sulphates are agitated with plenty of water , and filtered from a little insoluble residue of metallic acids .
Ammonia in excess is then added to the filtrate , and the precipitated oxides are washed , once more converted into oxalates in the manner already described , and the oxalates again washed , dried , and ignited .
The ignited oxides are boiled in dilute nitric acid , filtered from a little insoluble matter , and evaporated to dryness .
These somewhat complicated operations are to insure the removal of sulphuric and metallic acids , the presence of which interferes with subsequent fractionation .
The earthy nitrates rich in scandium are mixed with an equal bulk of potassium nitrate and fused in large porcelain crucibles with constant stirring until the mass has the appearance of cream\#151 ; fluid when hot , solidifying on cooling to a white enamel-like mass .
On boiling this mass in water , a dense white basic nitrate separates and undecomposed nitrates are left in solution .
Scandium and ytterbium , forming easily decomposed nitrates , concentrate in the insoluble end\#151 ; the " heads , " \#151 ; while the yttrium and cerium earths , whose nitrates are less easily decomposed by heat , are left in the soluble end the ' ' tails .
" Fractionation on these lines must now be continued until spectrum photographs show the scandium to be pure .
It is not difficult to obtain scandia free from all earths present except ytterbia and yttria ; but the final elimination of pure scandia from these earths is a matter demanding much time and patience .
This easy decomposition of the nitrate by heat makes it possible by a systematic series of fractionations to separate scandium from most of the other associated elements .
The worst impurity is ytterbium , the nitrate of which is almost as easily decomposed .
Fortunately a strong dominant line of the ytterbium spectrum , wave-length 3694'344 , occurs at a vacant part of the scandium spectrum , and near the characteristic group SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
of scandium .
A sample of scandia is not considered satisfactory if the least trace of this line is seen on an over-exposed spectrum of scandium , and if the atomic weight is higher than 44'1 .
The atomic weight of ytterbium being 173 , a very little of it as an impurity raises the atomic weight of scandium .
Scandium Hydroxide , Sc203,3H20 = Sc(OH)3 .
On adding caustic alkali to a solution of a scandium salt the hydroxide comes down as a bulky gelatinous precipitate .
It is insoluble in excess of precipitant .
In appearance it resembles yttrium hydroxide .
It dries in the air at ordinary temperatures to a hard porcelain-like mass and has the composition given above .

54-048 28-41 28*98 190-248 100-00 100-00 The hydroxide is a very weak base , with a marked tendency to form basic salts .
It dissolves readily in dilute acids , forming salts which have a sweet astringent taste .
The salts show no absorption spectra .
After ignition , anhydrous scandia , Sc203 , is difficultly soluble in dilute acids in the cold , rather more easily soluble when warmed , and readily soluble in hot strong mineral acids .
Strong sulphuric acid poured on ignited scandia attacks it with considerable evolution of heat .
Scandium Carbonate , Sc2(C03)3,12H20 , comes down as a bulky white precipitate on adding ammonium or sodium carbonate to a soluble salt of scandium .
It is almost insoluble in a cold dilute solution of ammonium carbonate , but is moderately soluble in a hot and strong solution of this salt , and as m the same circumstances yttrium carbonate is much less soluble , this difference may be utilised as a basis for a method of separating scandium and yttrium by fractionation .
d 2 Scandium carbonate holds carbonic acid very weakly , and concordant analyses are not easy to get .
Drying at 100 ' drives off water and some of the carbon dioxide , leaving a basic carbonate .
When freshly precipitated and dried in a current of air at the ordinary temperature , the following formula best agrees with the figures obtained:\#151 ; Sc2(C03)3,12H20 .
At a temperature of 100 ' this salt loses carbon dioxide and water , and becomes a basic salt of uncertain composition .
Strong ignition drives off all water and carbon dioxide , leaving Sc203 .
Hydrated Scandium Chloride , Sc2C16,12H20 .
The hydrated salt is prepared by dissolving the earth in hydrochloric acid and evaporating on a water-bath .
It crystallises from a strong solution as a felt-like mass of fine white needles .
The crystals should be pressed many times between filter-paper frequently renewed , and put to dry for a few hours in a desiccator over sulphuric acid .
They are somewhat deliquescent , but not so much so as the nitrate , and are readily soluble in alcohol .
They have the following composition :\#151 ; Sc2C16,12H20 = Sc203,6HC1,9H20 .

Scandium hydroxide or carbonate dissolves easily in hydrobromic acid , and the acid solution evaporated on the water-bath deposits small rhombic crystals , coloured slightly brown by free bromine and very deliquescent .

Ignited scandia is attacked by aqueous hydrofluoric acid , forming a semi-transparent gum-like mass , which on boiling changes to a fine white precipitate .
This is difficult to filter , as it has great tendency to run through .
When hydrofluoric acid is added to a solution of scandium nitrate or sulphate , a white precipitate comes down .
On boiling it becomes milky , resembling the above-described precipitate .
The fluoride dried over sulphuric acid is anhydrous .
It slightly loses weight at a red heat , and at a yellow heat it frits together , fusing with difficulty before the blowpipe .
Strong sulphuric acid imperfectly decomposes scandium fluoride .
It is completely decomposed by fusion with potassium hisulphate ; the melt dissolves in acidulated water , and the solution mixed with ammonia deposits scandium hydroxide .

Aqueous chloric acid saturated with scandium hydroxide forms at first a clear colourless liquid ; evaporation on the water-bath decomposes it , with evolution of chlorine .
On further evaporation , crystals like long needles form on cooling , and the mother-liquor becomes a gummy amorphous mass in which , after standing , appear long needle-shaped crystals .
These crystals probably are the perchlorate .
Scandium Perchlorate .
Aqueous perchloric acid easily dissolves scandium hydroxide or carbonate , and the solution evaporated over the water-bath separates into a felt-like mass of rhombic needle-shaped crystals .
SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
Scandium Bhomate .
Bromic acid readily dissolves scandium hydroxide , but on evaporating the solution it decomposes , leaving an amorphous gummy mass without crystalline appearance .
Scandium Sulphate , Sc2(S04)3,6H20 .
Scandium hydroxide easily dissolves in dilute sulphuric acid ; after ignition the oxide dissolves with difficulty in dilute , but readily in strong acid , with evolution of heat .
The excess of sulphuric acid must be driven off carefully , when the anhydrous sulphate is left behind in the form of a fine white powder .
Nilson gives the formula of the anhydrous salt , Sc206,3S02 .
He says : " It loses acid at a high temperature , and leaves pure scandia .
The salt treated with water only gives at first a milky liquid , the anhydrous salt combines very slowly with water , and then re-dissolves .
On heating , a clear solution is immediately obtained .
" According to Cleve , " Sulphuric acid gives with scandia a white and bulky mass of sulphate , resembling thorium sulphate when it separates by heat .
The sulphate does not form distinct crystals .
" It is very soluble in water , and a strong solution when heated does not deposit crystals , in that respect differing from most of the other rare-earth sulphates .
The solution may be evaporated to a super-saturated syrup , which , standing in the cold for some hours , deposits crystals of* the 6-hydrate .
100 parts of the saturated solution at 12 ' were found to contain 44'5 parts of anhydrous scandium sulphate .
Scandium sulphate is not deliquescent in the ordinary air of a room even in damp weather , and is insoluble in alcohol .
On mixing 100 grs. of anhydrous scandium sulphate with the same quantity of water , the temperature rose in a few minutes from 14 ' to 21 ' .
On adding absolute alcohol to a strong solution of scandium sulphate the solution becomes milky , and a heavy oily-looking liquid sinks to the bottom .
This may be separated by filtration through paper moistened with alcohol , when the residue is left as a viscous liquid which on exposure to the air becomes thicker .
This oily-looking liquid has the composition of the 6-hydrate sulphate .
When strongly heated , the sulphate decomposes , leaving pure scandia .
It is , however , difficult to drive off all the sulphuric acid from the sulphate even by heating the crucible containing it before the blowpipe .
The best way to decompose scandium sulphate is first to ignite it to the highest temperature of a Bunsen burner , then to moisten with water and add a little ammonium carbonate .
Dry and ignite again , and pure scandia is left free from sulphuric acid .
Nilson says : " This salt separates from a syrupy solution in small globular aggregates .
It is inalterable in the air , it loses four molecules of water at 100 ' , and the rest at a higher temperature .
" He found on analysis 14'26 , 14-46 , and 7*16 , 7'29 of H20 , instead of 14'88 and 7'44 .
I have crystallised this sulphate from a syrupy aqueous solution ; it is dried by repeated pressure between many folds of blotting-paper .

The behaviour of the double sulphates of potassium and the rare-earth metals is usually considered to govern their position in the broad groups into which they are divided .
If the double sulphate is insoluble in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate the earth is supposed to belong to the cerium group , while if the double sulphate is soluble the earth is said to be one of the yttrium group .
According to Cleve ( ' Comptes Bendus/ vol. lxxxix .
, p. 419 , August 18 , 1879):\#151 ; " Potassium sulphate in concentrated solution gives rise to the separation of a double salt , a crystalline powder , soluble in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate .
" Cleve gives the composition of the double salt as Sc203,3S03+2K20 , S03 .
On the other hand , Nilson says ( ' Comptes Bendus/ vol. xci .
, p. 118 , July 12 , 1880 ) :\#151 ; " Scandium sulphate in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate gives a double salt , completely insoluble .
... It dissolves with difficulty in water , even boiling , and not at all in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate . . . .
The composition of the double salt , 3K202S02 + Sc2063S02 , shows that scandium belongs to the group of gadolinite and cerite metals , all these metals giving salts of the same typical composition .
" In view of these diametrically opposite statements I have taken especial pains to ascertain the true behaviour of the double salt .
17'717 grs. of re-crystallised scandium sulphate , found by analysis to be pure , were dissolved in water in a flask .
The calculated quantity of potassium sulphate to unite with the 17'717 grs. , and to make a saturated solution in the water added , was then weighed out , and 5 per cent , additional potassium sulphate was added to ensure complete saturation .
This was dissolved in boiling water , put into the flask containing the scandium sulphate , and water up to 250 cc .
was added .
The flask was securely corked , and put into a mechanical agitator , where it was shaken continuously for twenty-five hours .
At first , when the two salts were mixed , no precipitation of double salt was visible , but after a short time there appeared a fine granular precipitate , which gradually increased as the shaking proceeded .
At the end of twenty-five hours the precipitated double sulphate was filtered off and washed with 100 cc .
of cold saturated solution of potassium sulphate .
The filtrate was heated , ammonia added , and the whole well boiled .
A very slight precipitate of scandia came down which , when filtered , washed , and ignited , weighed 0-414 gr. , equivalent to 1'473 grs. of scandium sulphate in solution , the rest of the sulphate being in the insoluble precipitate .
It therefore follows that for every 100 parts of the double sulphate 8*32 per cent , are soluble and 91'68 per cent , are insoluble in the amount of saturated solution of potassium sulphate employed .
The insoluble double salt was washed with boiling water to remove the little excess of potassium sulphate , until its bulk wa^ reduced about one-half .
It was then dried and analysed .
SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
My own analytical results agree closely with Nilson 's formula .
As Cleve distinctly says that the double sulphate is soluble in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate , it is probable he was not working on the true double salt .
The scandia in the aqueous washings was also determined .
The total amount of scandia in the washings and precipitate amounted to 4'560 grs. , which , added to the 0'414 in the solution , makes 4*974 grs. of scandia .
The 17'717 grs. of scandium sulphate contain theoretically 4'981 grs. of scandia , so these results are well within experimental errors .
Scandium Selenate , Sc2(Se04)3,8H20 .
Dilute and warm selenic acid easily dissolves scandium hydrate or carbonate , and on evaporating the acid solution over sulphuric acid the selenate crystallises in well-defined rhombic prisms , bright , colourless , and capable of withstanding a temperature of 400 ' without decomposition , except loss of water .
When heated to 100 ' for sixteen hours , the 8-hydrate loses 6 molecules of water and becomes a 2-hydrate , Sc2(Se04)3,2H20 .

When hydrated , scandia easily dissolves in dilute nitric acid ; after ignition it dissolves with the aid of heat in moderately strong nitric acid .
The salt is very soluble in water and in alcohol , and is extremely deliquescent .
The acid solution , over sulphuric acid , dries up to a viscous gummy mass , in which appear groups of stellate crystals .
A neutral aqueous solution evaporated on the water-bath , on cooling , deposits colourless prismatic crystals .
Scandium nitrate decomposes more easily by heat than the nitrate of any other of the rare earths .
The crystals deposited from an almost neutral solution get pasty at 100 ' , but do not run to liquid .
In vacuum at 100 ' the crystals give off water , and frit together , but do not become liquid .
Dried on a water-bath , and heated in a tube immersed in melted paraffin with a thermometer by its side , they show signs of melting at 125 ' .
They commence to liquefy at 150 ' , and when stirred with a platinum wire the crystals run together and form an opaque white liquid .
When scandium nitrate is partly decomposed by heat , and the melted mass extracted with hot water and well boiled , a basic nitrate then deposits , which is difficult to filter owing to its clogging fineness .
The hydrated nitrate , gradually heated in a silica crucible , fuses and boils , becomes opaque and evolves much water .
If the heating is stopped at the proper time , the anhydrous nitrate is left , the whole of the water having been driven off .
On continuing the heat nitrous vapours come off and the liquid becomes clear and liquid like water .
Increasing the heat-turns the liquid brown and drives off more nitrous vapours , ebullition becomes sluggish , the fused mass gets white and opaque , and finally there remains a white residue of scandia .
For analysis the nitrate was thrice re-crystallised and repeatedly dried , between blotting-paper .

Scandium oxide after ignition does not dissolve in acetic acid .
The hydroxide , however , dissolves easily , and the acetate soon separates from the liquid in the form of fine white crystals , difficultly soluble in water .
The aqueous solution , evaporated over the water-bath , deposits hard crystalline crusts .
When freshly prepared , the acetate dried in the air has the composition given below .
Water , however , is slowly given off , and after standing some days the salt passes into a monohydrate analogous to the formate .
When ignited , the acetate leaves a grey residue of scandia containing carbon .
By ignition alone it is difficult to get it of a constant weight .
The best way to analyse the salt is to moisten the weighed acetate with a few drops of nitric acid and cautiously to evaporate to dryness , heat , and ignite .
In this way is obtained pure white scandia .

Scandium oxalate comes down as a white crystalline powder when oxalic acid or ammonium oxalate is added to a solution of scandium .
If much free mineral acid is present the precipitation is not immediate ; it begins by a cloudiness , which in a few minutes increases to a crystalline precipitate , a little scandium oxalate remaining in the solution .
It is slightly soluble in water , weak acids , and more so in solution of ammonium oxalate .
On boiling a mixed oxalate from wiikite in a solution of ammonium oxalate the portion dissolved was richer in scandium than the insoluble part .
Attempts were made to effect a separation of scandia from the accompanying earths by making use of this fact .
A mixed oxalate of crude earths was boiled in a strong solution of ammonium oxalate and then filtered , and this SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
operation was repeated on the residue several times .
Ultimately the most soluble and the least soluble earths were separated and their spectra photographed .
The most soluble earth was nearly all scandia , with a little yttria , and traces of ytterbia , titania , and lime .
The least soluble contained more yttria than scandia , but not much of either .
By a repetition of this process it would not be difficult to effect a good separation of scandia and yttria ; I think the fused nitrate process is simpler and quicker .
When crude scandium oxalate is boiled in a solution of ammonium oxalate a partial separation of the earths is effected , but it is less complete than when ammonium carbonate is used as a solvent .
This is a very good method for separating scandia from zirconia , as hardly a trace of the zirconia is to be seen in the portion insoluble in hot ammonium , oxalate .
According to Nilson ( ' Comptes Rendus , ' vol. xci .
, p. 121 ) , the precipitated oxalate is slightly soluble in weak acids , and even in water .
I have verified this observation ; care must be taken not to over-wash the oxalate , or loss will ensue , and the filtrates should be kept and worked again for scandium .
The precipitated oxalate , dried in the air , contains 5 molecules of water .

The hydroxide dissolves readily in warm solution of picric acid and separates in groups of long needle-shaped crystals of a rich yellow colour .
When rapidly crystallised from a strong solution , the crystals form confused feathery masses , which on pouring off the mother-liquor turn to a felt-like mass difficult to drain .
100 parts of water at 20 ' dissolve 0*95 part of scandium picrate .
At 9 ' the same quantity of water dissolves 0*37 part .
Dried by exposure to cold dry air the crystals have the composition shown above .
The picrate cannot be detonated when wrapped in tin-foil and struck on an anvil with a heavy hammer .
Heated in a dry test-tube it darkens , gives a slight sublimate , fuses , and at a little higher temperature faintly explodes , leaving a black flocculent residue , which burns off to pure white scandia at a red heat .
The explosion , although not violent , is sufficient to blow some of the products out of the crucible .
The scandia therefore was estimated by precipitating the hot solution with ammonia in considerable excess and well boiling the liquid before filtering .
Unless this precaution is taken some of the picrate precipitates as such , and slight explosions occur when the precipitate is burnt .

Scandium hydroxide is readily attacked by aqueous phenyl-acetic acid , with the formation of a white insoluble phenyl-acetate .
The salt thus prepared has , however , a tendency to become more basic , and a better way to prepare it is by double decomposition between ammonium phenyl-acetate and scandium nitrate .
When moderately dilute and hot solutions of these salts are mixed and the whole boiled , the phenyl-acetate comes down chiefly on the sides and bottom of the beaker , and adheres to the glass with great pertinacity .
It can only be removed with difficulty and risk of breakage .
The deposit on the glass looks like warty concretions and under a high power appears crystalline .
It is almost insoluble in hot or cold water , and is insoluble in alcohol .
When double decomposition between scandium nitrate and ammonium phenyl-acetate is effected in the cold , the salt comes down as a white curdy precipitate which does not adhere to the glass , and can be washed easily with warm water boiling water , however , causes it to cohere with contraction .
The dry salt when heated softens and can be pressed into a pasty mass .
It does not fuse at a temperature at which decomposition begins .
Analysis .
( 1 ) 13*584 grs. of scandium phenyl-acetate precipitated from hot solutions and washed with boiling water , filtered and dried at 100 ' till the weight was constant , yielded on ignition 2*396 grs. of scandia , = 1*5516 grs. of scandium .

Scandium Pyromellitate , C6H2{C00Sc(0H)2}42H20 = Sc4C10H10O16,2H2O .
This salt comes down when ammonium pyromellitate is added to a solution of a soluble scandium salt .
It is formed also by allowing pyromellitic acid to act on scandium hydroxide with the aid of gentle heat .
Scandium pyromellitate is a white amorphous powder , insoluble in water and alcohol , but soluble in dilute acids .
Of the two molecules of water of hydration one is driven off at 100 ' and the remaining molecule at 140 ' .
The dried salt can be heated to 220 ' without decomposition .
Analysis .

Scandium Camphokate , CsH./ Jxj^NScOH .
The camphorate is prepared by heating scandium hydroxide with a slight excess of camphoric acid and water .
The hydroxide is easily attacked and converted into an insoluble camphorate .
It may be prepared also by precipitating a solution of scandium nitrate with a solution of ammonium camphorate .
In either case it forms an insoluble white precipitate , which , after thorough washing and drying at 100 ' , has the composition given above .
Scandium camphorate is anhydrous and insoluble in water and alcohol .
It is easily soluble in dilute mineral acids .
When dry it is very electrical , and an attempt to powder it sends it Hying out of the mortar .
If it is put warm between two watch-glasses , and the lower glass is gently rubbed on the outside with the finger , the path of the finger is marked by a flight of camphorate from the lower to the upper glass , where it sticks .
This peculiarity makes it not easy to perform the preliminary operations of drying , transferring , and weighing , preparatory to its quantitative analysis .
Gradually heated to redness , the camphorate at first blackens with carbon .
At a red heat this burns off , leaving a white residue of scandia .
Analysis .
( 1 ) 18T91 grs. of the camphorate , dried at 100 ' , yielded on ignition 4772 grs. of scandia , = 3'0902 grs. of scandium .
( 2 ) 17'921 grs. of the camphorate yielded on ignition 4'719 grs. of scandia , = 3'0559 grs. of scandium .

Scandium is remarkable inasmuch as its existence was foretold by Mendeleeff , # and called by him ekaboron , eight years before its actual discovery by Nilson .
To-day I may be permitted to indulge still further in speculations on the genesis and degradation of the chemical elements\#151 ; speculations which a few years ago might have been derided even by a learned Society .
But the undoubted fact of the production of helium from radium , the probability that chemical elements of high atomic weight are slowly breaking up into bodies of lower atomic weight , and the suspicion that some well-known chemical elements of low atomic weight are degradation products , embolden me to speculate on the past history and genesis of scandium .
In 1898 I brought before the Boyal Society a scheme of the arrangement in Space of the chemical elements in which scandium was seen to fall in place between boron and yttrium .
I hesitated to introduce ytterbium into the scheme , as its atomic weight was not known with sufficient accuracy to enable it to be properly placed .
To-day it is seen to fill a gap below yttrium , and the group is :\#151 ; Boron , scandium , yttrium , ytterbium .
These four elements have a close relationship , thus :\#151 ; B atomic weight . . .
11-0 x 16 = 176-0 Sc " . . . . .
44T x 4 = 176-4 Y " . . . . .
89'0 x 2 = 178-0 Yb " . . . . .
173*0 x 1 = 173-0 In reference to this table it must be remarked that the atomic weight of scandium certainly is not known with absolute accuracy , the T being little more than a guess .
Yttrium , moreover , is now seen to be very liable to contain scandium ; when Cleve determined its atomic weight it was impossible , without further refined spectroscopic examination\#151 ; not available at that date\#151 ; to detect in it the trace of scandium sufficient to lower the atomic weight by one unit .
Ytterbium certainly is too low , for Urbain recently has announced the discovery in it of an element of a lower atomic weight ; this being removed might raise the atomic weight of ytterbium a few units .
With these reasonable corrections the last column will not be far from the same whole number , 176 .
The frequent occurrence of the triad ytterbium , yttrium , and scandium in a very limited group of rare minerals may be explained by assuming the instability of ytterbium , the atom of highest weight , and letting it split into two atoms , when yttrium would be produced .
Assume the same action to take place with yttrium , its splitting up again into two atoms would produce scandium ; and scandium ( " , * D. I. Mendeleeff , " A Natural System of the Elements , and its Application to the Indication of the Properties of Undiscovered Elements , " ' Russ .

SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
next in order to boron " ) would ultimately form boron by a quadruple sub-division .
The comparatively small quantities of ytterbium and scandium in these minerals may easily be accounted for by the assumption that they are more unstable forms of matter than yttrium and boron .
The fact that these bodies give totally distinct line spectra has not the significance it formerly was supposed to have , for now we know of different line spectra given by the same body .
Argon , with its red and blue spectra , is a case in point , and Goldstein , as a result of his work on the spectra of Cs , Rb , and K , has come to the conclusion that the property of emitting two separate line spectra is a general one .
Moreover , between the line spectra of radium , uranium , and helium\#151 ; bodies which are supposed to be associated genetically\#151 ; there is no similarity or line in common .
