" Researches on the Tides ; Sixth Series .
On the Results of an extensive system of Tide Observations , made on the Coasts of Europe and America , in June 1835 .
" By the Rev. Wiliiam Whewell , F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge .
The author having , in several previous communications to the Royal Society , urged the importance of simultaneous tide observations made at distant places , here gives an account of the steps taken to carry this plan into effect , in consequence of his representations , both by the Government in England , and by the other maritime powers of Europe .
He explains , in the present paper , the general character of the observations thus obtained , the mode employed in reducingthem , and enters at considerable length into a discussion of the immense mass of information which they supply with respect to the phenomena of the tides .
One of his principal objects was to fix with precision the form of the Cotidal lines by which the motion of the tide wave is exhibited .
He devotes one section of the paper to an investigation of the general form of these lines ; and another to a nearer approximation to an accurate map of these lines , more especially as they exist in the German Ocean .
The 4th section treats of the height of the tide in its total range from high to low water ; the 5th relates to the diurnal inequality ; the 6th to the semimenstrual inequality ; and the 7th and last comprises general remarks on the tables which accompany the paper .
