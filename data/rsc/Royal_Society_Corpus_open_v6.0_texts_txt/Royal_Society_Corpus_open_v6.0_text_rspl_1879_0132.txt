The following experiments were made upon Dr. Alcxander Macalister , at intel.vals from November , 1877 , to May , 1879 , and consisted in observing the lengths of time during which the extended horizontal arms , with supinated hands holding equal weights , could be held out : \mdash ; The following results were obtained , in which denotes the weight held in the hand in pounds ; and , the time , in seconds , of holding out before fatigue stopped the experiment : Rev.

This table shows the degree of credit attaching to the several of cbservations , and proves ( what I did not antic.ipate ) that the fatigue produced by small weights is as definite as that produced by large weights .
The interpretation of these ) servations by means of the Law of Fatigue is thus found .
When the arm is extended , the muscles of the shoulder joint keep it in position ; and , at the same time , the scapula and its muscles and surroundings are raised by the reaction ; so that the arm and scapula equilibrate by means of equal and opposite cou ples acting round the centre of the glenoid cavity .
If , therefore , denote the weight held in the hand , and denote the weight , which , if held in the hand , would represent the sum of couples of the arm and scapula and surroundings about the centre of the glenoid ; then it is plain that the total work done by the muscles before fatigue stops the experiment must be proportional to , where is the whole time of the experiment .
The rate of is evidently proportional to Therefore , by the Law of Fatigue we have . .
( 1 ) in which , A are unknown constants to be determined by experiment .
From the foregoing experiments , we have the eight following equations : \mdash ; ( 2 ) .

From the discussion of these equations I find the following results , in Note . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

From this , I find , by interpolation , the most probable values of and to be 5 .

From these values I obtain the following comparison of theory observation : \mdash ; The maximum useful work will take place when is a maximum , or which will be a maximum helt w , and the xtrnum useful will be , if be the time to , and seconds .
I attempted , in the following manner , to check the value found for , the equivalent of the arm and shoulder , estimated at the middle of the hand .
Dr. Macalister , closing his eyes , had his arm suspended to a balance by a string looped round the middle of the hand , and the weight the suspended arm , allowed to hang\ldquo ; dead was measured by weights placed in the opposite scale .
After many trials , I found the weight to be .
with a possible error of 2 ozs .
, or either way .
To find the effect of the shoulder , I measured the horizontal distance of the centre of gravity of his scapula from the centre of his glenoid cavity , and found it to be inches , while the distance of the of his hand from the same centre was found to be 22 inches .
The weights lifted with the scapula were thus estimated : \mdash ; Muscles .

To this must be added about one-third more , to represent , fascia , tendons , and skin , or ozs .
, making altogether ozs .
As these weights were all obtained from dead subjects , we must add somewhat more than one half , to the weights up to the standard of the living subject , which makes altogether over ozs .
Adding to this the weight of the average fresh scapula , ozs .
, we have , finally for the total weight applied at the centre gravity of the scapula , ozs .
, which , when reduced to the corresponding weight 3.5 held in the palm of the hand , gives ozs .

Ou the bsence of Potassium in Protagon .
365 inches from the centre of the shoulder joint , we obtain for the ralue of ( probable error ) .
{ This result agrees remarkably well with the result btained by calculations founded on the Law of Fatigue , from the series of observations detailed in this note . .
On the Absence of Potassium in Protagon prepared by Dr. Gamgee By H. E. ROSCOE , .D .
, F.B.S. Received April 29 , 1880 .
Protagon is stated by Gamgee to contain no potassium .
Thudichum , on the other hand , asserts that this body contains from to per .
of this metal .
In order to ascertain the quantity of potassium contained in protagon prepared by Gamgee , 5 grams of this material was completely $urnt , leaving a residue of gram , consisting chiefly of metaphosphoric acid .
On precipitating the potassium in the usual way , and on decomposing the platinochloride , a residue of gram of platinum was obtained ; this corresponds to a percentage of of potassium on the protagon employed .
Spectroscopic experiments , made upon solutions of the chloride and phosphate of potassium , and upon a solution of the latter salt with the addition of the relative quantity of phosphoric acid present in the ash , according to the above analysis , convinced me of the correctness of the conclusioIjS contained in my letter printed on , vol. 30 , of the " " Proceedings of the Royal Society The Society adjourned over Ascension to Thursday , May Presents , April 8 , 1880 .
