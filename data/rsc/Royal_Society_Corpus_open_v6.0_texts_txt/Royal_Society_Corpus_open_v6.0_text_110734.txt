" On Ground-gru , or ice formed , under peculiar circumstances , at the bottom of running water .
" By James Farquharson , LL. D. , F.R.S. , Minister of the Parish of Alford .
The author brings forward in this paper several recent observations on the formation of ice at the bottom of rivers , the conditions of which corroborate the views regarding the cause of that pheno ?
menon , which he presented in a paper on this subject , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1835 ( p. 329 ) , namely , that it occurs in consequence of the loss of heat by radiation from the bot ?
tom of the water , in a manner precisely analogous to the formation of hoar-frost on the surface of dry land , as first explained by Dr. Wells .
He then answers some of the objections to that theory propounded in an article , under the title of Ground-Gru , in the Penny Cyclopaedia , and shows that those objections are founded in error , and possess no validity .
