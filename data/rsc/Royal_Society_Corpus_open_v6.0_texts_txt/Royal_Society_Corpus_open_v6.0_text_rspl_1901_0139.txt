donnant a ces fonctions sous le sign J , soit la premiere form , soit toujours la second .
En operant de la sort on commet un erreur sir chacune des integrates , mais ces erreurs se compensent complete-ment dans la somme des integrates .
Je me suis attache ensuite a ecrire l'inegalite qui exprime la condition de stabilite , et a reduire aux integrales elliptiques les plus simples toutes les integrales qui figurent dans cette inegalite .

The anti-sera are produced briefly as follows : Assuming that we wish to obtain an anti-serum for human blood , we inject human blood intra-perito-neally into rabbits .
After about five injections , given at intervals of three or more days , the rabbit is bled to death , and its blood-serum collected .
