On heating a mixture of sebacic acid , C10 H1S 04 , and caustic baryta , besides the hydrocarbon C8 H18 , which I have described in a former communication* , other products are formed , amongst which there is a solid body , which , by several crystallizations from alcohol , was obtained in small white crystals .
On analyzing it , Mr. Dearden obtained results which led to the formula C18 H34 O , which is that of cetyl-alcohol:\#151 ; Calculated .

The formation of this compound is certainly very singular , and perhaps the more so as cetyl-alcohol is so easily oxidized to sebacic acid by the action of nitric acid .
I intend to obtain larger quantities of it by the above reaction and to investigate it .

( Abstract .
) Part I. The subjects of the present inquiry are three in number :\#151 ; 1 .
The electrical phenomena belonging to living nerve and muscle during rest ; 2 .
The electrical phenomena which mark the passing of nerve and muscle from the state of rest into that of action ; and 3 .
The workings of voltaic electricity , and of electricity generally , upon nerve and muscle .
1 .
The electrical phenomena belonging to living nerve and muscle during the state of rest .
Argument.\#151 ; Living nerve and muscle have an electricity of their own , which fails by degrees as life dies out , and is wanting altogether after * Proc. Roy .
