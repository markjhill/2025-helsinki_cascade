cate that in sodium vapour we have a medium which approaches more nearly to the ideal absorbing medium , with but a single natural period of vibration , than any substance heretofore investigated .
Of course I am speaking here only with reference to the natural vibration which appears to influence the dispersion .
Strictly speaking , there are two natural periods , of course , which influence the velocity of the light in the medium , but when the medium is very dense the condition certainly approaches very nearly to that of a single period medium .
As I have said before , the fluted absorption bands are without influence on the dispersion , at least their influence is too slight to be detected by the methods that have been employed thus far .

In the first part of the present investigation* I have stated , as one of the principal conclusions with regard to the frog 's skin , that the normal electrical response of the excited skin is of outgoing direction .
The chief object of the following observations was to ascertain whether or no similar effects of outgoing direction are manifested by the pad of the cat 's foot , this having been , since the first observations of Hermann and of Luchsinger , the chosen object upon which to demonstrate the cutaneous ( epithelial and glandular ) currents aroused by nerve-stimulation .
I have examined the cutaneous currents , A indirectly aroused by nerve-stimulation , B directly aroused by electrical excitation of the skin itself in .
the manner described and figured in my previous communication ( loc. cit. , p. 481 ) .
A. Indirect Excitation.\#151 ; The animals were decapitated , and used in the first instance for the observation of indirect effects and their possible modification in consequence of arrested circulation .
In every case , without exception , the electrical effect of excitation of the sciatic nerve upon the pads proved to be an ingoing current , as described by Luchsinger and by Hermann . !
The effect gradually declined with lapse of time , and disappeared within 1 hour after decapitation , without exhibiting any change of sign or other modification .
Although it was not my purpose to pay particular attention to this point , I may take the opportunity of stating that the experiment , as * " On Skin Currents .

made upon a freshly killed animal , affords a very convenient means of class-demonstration of the fundamental fact .
The response is elicited by stimulation of the sciatic nerve after the latter has ceased to provoke muscular contraction , and can then be most conveniently demonstrated ( and recorded ) without resort to the curarisation and artificial respiration necessary in the case of the living animal .
The method and its results will be made sufficiently apparent by the following experiments and figures :\#151 ; Experiment 1.\#151 ; Electrical Response of the Skin to Indirect Excitation through the Sciatic Nerve .
Cat decapitated\#151 ; Both sciatics exposed and cut\#151 ; Large pad of each hind foot led off to galvanometer by unpolarisable electrodes\#151 ; Tetanic excitation of peripheral end of one or other sciatic for 5 seconds at intervals of 5 minutes\#151 ; Berne coil at 1000 units supplied by two Leclanches .
Deflection + signifies that the skin of the right side is electropositive , i.e. , that it is traversed by an ingoing current ( directed from left side to right through the galvanometer ) .

) B. Direct Excitation.\#151 ; A pad of the cat 's foot , cut off ' 1 to 48 hours after death , and set up between unpolarisable electrodes as previously described ( Joe .
cit. , p. 481 ) , generally manifests a small and gradually increasing ingoing normal current , not exceeding , as a lule , 0-0100 volt .
With lapse of time this current gradually falls again .
It is noteworthy that its direction ( ingoing ) is from the intact external surface towards the injured cut surface .
On Skin Currents .
If after exact compensation of this normal current a single induction shock is sent through the pad , either in the ingoing or in the outgoing direction , the effect\#151 ; or , properly speaking , the after-effect\#151 ; is in nearly every instance outgoing , as in the case of the frog 's skin .
The few instances in which I have witnessed an ingoing response have been in the case of fresh skin , taken soon after decapitation , and tested by comparatively weak induction shocks .
( I find in my laboratory notes only one instance of a late ingoing response\#151 ; 3 days after decapitation .
) In such cases the ingoing response has been of comparatively low voltage , and has given place to an outgoing response at the end of a few hours .
From review of a considerable number of observations I conclude that outgoing response is the rule , ingoing response the exception .
I have kept the former under systematic observation up to 60 hours , but have found under the conditions of observation that it may disappear at an earlier period from the skin of ill-nourished animals .
The physiological action of the skin is indicated : 1 , by its invariable direction with both directions of excitation ; 2 , by its complete abolition after immersion of the skin in hot water .
A series of responses provoked at short intervals exhibits summation .
Tetanisation by alternating induction shocks in both pairs of directions , excites a larger response than that groused by a single induction shock .

Dr. A. D. Waller , The response to both directions of excitation is outgoing ; it is greater to tetanising currents than to single shocks ; it is greater the day after death than on the day of death ; it is abolished by immersion in hot water , the small residual deflections observed being such as would be caused by ordinary polarisation .
The 24-hour responses were recorded as under ; they were throughout of outgoing direction , by both directions of single break currents , and by both pairs of directions of tetanisation .

Weak subsequent to strong excitation gave no effect , while the latter gave regular outgoing effects .
Twenty-four hours postmortem weak excitation gave no effect ; with strengthened excitation the first visible effect was outgoing , and with strong excitation the outgoing effect was generally larger than on the day of death .
In general the outgoing effect is the far more prominent and regular phenomenon ; the conditions most favourable to manifestation of the* less prominent and more evanescent ingoing effect being a fresh skin and not too strong excitation .
With lapse of time , or as an imme-j diate consequence of strong excitation , the ingoing effect of weak excitation is abolished .

Method .
If two electrodes , A and B , are applied to the intact skm , e.g. , to the external surface of two separate pads , and tetanising currents are le in by these electrodes , the subsequent deflection is comparatively small VOL. LXIX .
Dr. A , D. Waller .
and of variable direction .
Two outgoing currents are aroused at the points A and B , of opposed directions in the circuit , and the deflection under these conditions is only resultant of an inequality in the two forces aroused at A and at B. In order to investigate separately the local reactions of A and of B consequent upon electrical excitation , of which these two points are poles , it is necessary to employ a third electrode , C , in the following manner:\#151 ; B and A are the exciting electrodes , C is an independent electrode through which no exciting current is passed , and which in conjunction with A or with B is to serve as leading-off electrode to the galvanometer .
If it be intended to examine the state at A after passage of an exciting current through A B , the procedure will be :\#151 ; 1 .

Connection of B and C with the galvanometer .
The necessary transposition from A to C or from B to C is most readily effected by means of a switch key of the following disposition :\#151 ; The three electrodes are connected with the terminals A , B , C. A is connected with A and B with B^ by revolving arms , either of which can be turned on to the middle terminal C. This method is applicable to many cases other than that of the skin.* I shall have occasion to refer to it as the " A , B , C Method , " and for the sake of brevity shall call the above-described switch the " M switch .
" The following protocol will best exhibit the results of a typical experiment and which is a point of some practical importance\#151 ; the system on which laboratory notes are taken so as to avoid confusion of direction during experiment .

Fallacy to be avoided .
The longest period at the end of which I have detected unmistakable physiological response of a surviving pad has been 7 days post mortem .
I have not , however , sought to follow out the reaction to its last remaining trace so as to determine a maximum duration of survival , because with declining voltage of reaction the disturbing effects of polarisation counter-currents become more and more appi-rent .
At a comparatively early period the ' response to single shocks disappears , and the galvanometer , if sensitive , manifests only polarisation effects contrary in direction to the test shocks .
At this period tetanisation by currents alternating in direction will still bring out a true summated outgoing effect with both pairs of directions of currents ; under these conditions the effect of polarisation is relatively smaller .
But at a later period , as the life of tissue is coming to an end , and the response reaches a value to be measured in ten thousandths of a volt , the disturbing influence of polarisation again becomes apparent .
In this case the deflection after tetanisation is reversed with reversal of direction , and a resultant due to superior polarisation by make is witnessed in the direction of break .
The shortest period after death at which I have observed this state has been Dr. A. D. Waller .
twenty-four hours , in the case of an ill-nourished cat .
I regard this as indicating brief survival of tissue .
Fallacies due to anomalous polarisation require to be tested for and excluded .
In my experience this kind of fallacy is liable to occur from a defectively amalgamated zinc , and is eliminated by reamalgai-mation .
I have not thought fit to use tetanising currents with tissue , secondary coil , and galvanometer in one circuit , but have always short-circuited the galvanometer during tetanisation ( any current in circuit being of course neutralised by compensation ) , and non-short-circuited the galvanometer immediately after tetanisation .
The time interval in this proceeding has been about 1 second , and upon occasion y^th second .
I have not attempted to ascertain what the electrical state may have been during this transfer-time .
The following experiment is given to illustrate the fallacy of the electrodes and its correction ; the explanation offered of that fallacy is only tentative .

The above experiment shows that the fallacy of the electrodes may be of complicated origin , and that care should be taken to ascertain , by separately testing the electrodes , that it has been eliminated .
The interpretation of the fallacy that has been given above is purely tentative , and whether right or wrong does not form part of the principal argument , which is based upon experiments in which the fallacy has been eliminated .
Nevertheless the fact that it might be present is important to bear in mind , especially in cases where reactions of low voltage ( below 0-001 volt ) are under examination .
But , as previously stated , the fallacy , even if present , would not interfere with conclusions based on reactions of high voltage ( above 0-01 volt ) .
The fallacy of the electrodes is easily recognised and easily avoided .
To recognise the fallacy it is sufficient to bring the clay pads of the two electrodes into contact , exactly compensating any accidental current , and then pass testing currents through the circuit , just as when a. test object is interpolated between the electrodes .
There should be no movement of the galvanometer spot , or at most the slight movement due to defect of compensation or trace of polarisation , in either case less than the movement produced by 0-0001 volt thrown into circuit .
To remove the fallacy , if recognised , it is usually sufficient to carefully reamalgamate the zinc rods .
From preliminary experiments with zinc rods , unamalgamated and amalgamated , in water and in saturated solution of ZnS04 , it appeared that fallacy of electrodes i might be due to a defectively amalgamated kathodic zinc surface rendered electronegative by an exciting current .
Conclusion .
The regular electrical effect of indirect excitation is an ingoing 1 current .
The usual and principal electrical effect of direct excitation is an 1 outgoing current .
An ingoing current may be obtained by direct excitation imme-1 diately after death .
I think it probable that both ingoing and outgoing forces may I co-exist in the excited skin at the same moment , and that the galvano- 1 metric deflection is an expression of this resultant .
This co-existence of two opposite forces is , however , less clearly J evident in the case of the cat 's skin than in those of the frog 's skin and 1 of the frog 's eyeball .
