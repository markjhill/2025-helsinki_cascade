) The rate of dissipation of energy at spring tides in the Irish Sea is calculated from the known formulae for skin friction of the wind on the ground and the friction of rivers on their beds .
The results range from 1040 ergs to 1300 ergs per square centimetre per second .
The least of these is 150 times as great as Mr. Street 's previous estimate of 7 ergs per square centimetre per second .
The rate at which energy flows into the Irish Sea is next calculated from the rise and fall of tide , the strength of the tidal current , and their phase difference over two sections taken across the North and South Channels .
The rate of dissipation of energy is found to be 1530 ergs per square centimetre per second .
This is in good agreement with the previous result .
It is next shown that this absorption of energy is sufficient to reduce the amplitude of the incoming wave to one-half , so that three-quarters of the energy of the incoming tidal wave is absorbed .
This absorption of energy explains most of the chief characteristics of the tidal phenomena of the South Channel to the Irish Sea , the velocity of the cotidal line , which is only about one-third of the velocity of the tidal wave , the angle through which the cotidal line turns in passing up the Channel , and the effect of Carnsore Point and Wicklow Head on the times of high water to the north and south of them .
