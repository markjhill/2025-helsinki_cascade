A paper was read , entitled , " On the probable Position of the South Magnetic Pole .
" By Edward Rudge , Esq. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. The recent discovery of the site of the North Magnetic Pole , which has resulted from the experiments of Capt. James Ross , suggested to the author the inquiry whether any similar indications of an ap ?
proach to the South Magnetic Pole can be gathered from any observations now on record .
With this view a table is given of the observations made by Tasman in 1642 and 1643 , during his voyage of discovery in the Southern Ocean , extracted from his journal ; from which it appears that he on one occasion noticed the continual agitation of the horizontal needle , in south latitude 42ยง 25 ' , and longitude from Paris 160 ? .
On the presumption that the South Magnetic Pole was at that time near this spot , and that it has since been retrograding towards the East , the author conjectures that it will nowbe found in or about the 43rd parallel of south latitude 3 and to the south-east of the Island of Madagascar , a situation extremely convenient for ascertaining its exact position , which he considers as an object of great theoretical as well as practical importance .
The reading of a paper was then commenced , entitled , " An Ex ?
perimental Inquiry into the Cause of the grave and acute Tones of the Human Voice .
