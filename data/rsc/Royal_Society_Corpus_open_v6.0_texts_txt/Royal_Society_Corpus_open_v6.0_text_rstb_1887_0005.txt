The quantitative estimation of the micro-organisms present in air is a problem which has attracted the attention of many experimenters since it received its first impetus at the hands of Pasteur " twentv-six vears aero .
V % \#171 ; \gt ; - The method originally employed by Pasteur was of a very simple character , and consisted in preparing vacuous flasks of definite ( j litre ) capacity , each containing a small quantity of nutritive liquid : the ah* in the flask was removed by boiling the liquid , and the open extremity was then sealed with the blowpipe .
Such sealed flasks could then be preserved for an indefinite period of time without undergoing change .
By breaking off its sealed extremity , however , a certain volume of air rushes into the flask , carrying with it any microbes that it holds in suspension ; the flask is again immediately sealed , and if any microbes have gained access the liquid will , alter suitable incubation , suffer visible alteration .
On opening a number of such flasks , in various places , Pasteur found that the proportion of them which suffered alteration was dependent upon the locality in which the experiment was performed .
Thus , out of twenty such flasks exposed in the country at a distance from all habitations , eight became contaminated ; of twenty others exposed on the first heights of the Jura Mountains , five became infected ; whilst of twenty others exposed on the Montanvert ( 2000 metres high ) one alone broke down .
Tyxdat.tT in order to obtain an idea of the distribution of micro-organisms in the air , constructed a square table provided with 100 apertures , in which 100 test-tubes , each containing sterile culture-fluid , could be placed .
This battery of tubes was then exposed to the air under examination , and the fate of the tubes watched from day to day .
It was found that the tubes did not all suffer change simultaneously , but that the date of their alteration was dependent upon then position ; moreover , the changes taking pdace in the different tubes varied according to the particular kind of organism * * Count .

1.6.87 114 DR. P. F. FRANKLAND ON THE QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF with which the individual tube had become infected , and thus , in a measure , this apparatus foreshadows some of the great advantages to be obtained from the use of a solid culture-medium in which each individual organism gives rise to a separate colony .
Freudenreich and Miqtjel* have further elaborated processes for the quantitative distribution of micro-organisms in air , their researches having led them to adopt the following method , which has been largely used in the well-known experiments at the observatory of Montsouris .
This method consists essentially in aspirating a definite volume of air through a plug of sterilised glass-wool , which is then agitated with a definite volume of sterilised water , so as to distribute the collected organisms in the latter .
This water is then divided into a number of equal parts , each of which is added to a tube , flask , or bulb containing sterilised broth .
The volume of water with which the plug is mixed must be so selected that , when divided into the given number of equal parts , the microorganisms are so attenuated that only a portion of the total number of inoculated tubes become infected .
If only a portion of the total number of tubes become thus infected , Miquel argues that the organisms were distributed at such wide intervals in the water that not every one of the parts into which the latter was divided contained even a single organism , and that , therefore , those broth-tubes which suffered alteration through the inoculation of such a part must have received only a single organism , and , thus , that the number of culture-tubes which break down is identical with the number of organisms communicated to the water by the plug .
Koch t first applied a solid nutritive medium to the examination of air for microorganisms by exposing glass dishes containing a nutritive solid surface , such as peptone-gelatine , potatoes , \amp ; c. Upon this surface the aerial microbes become deposited , and , after suitable incubation , give rise to colonies which can be counted and further examined .
This method , which forms an entirely new departure in the examination of air , was further developed by Hesse , J who , by aspirating air through wide glass tubes of about 2 feet 6 inches in length and 1'5 inch diameter , coated internally with peptone-gelatine , found that , provided the current of air was not too rapid , practically the whole of the suspended organisms were deposited on the bottom of the tube in the first half or two-thirds of its length .
The remarkable phenomenon of the rapid subsidence of organisms in comparatively still air , upon which this method depends , is similar to that previously observed by Tyndall S in his well-known sterile chambers coated with glycerine .

Advantages and Disadvantages of Methods Vogue .
Of the methods mentioned above , the two most generally in use at the present time are those of Miquel and of Hesse .
The former finds most favour with those experimenters who still work principally with liquid media , whilst Hesse 's method is preferred by those employing a solid material for the cultivation of micro-organisms .
There are many objections to Miquel 's process , sufficiently obvious from the above description .
Thus , in the first place , each individual experiment is attended with great expenditure of time , trouble , and material , for the water with which the glass-wool plug is mixed has to be divided amongst a large number ( ten , thirty , forty , or more ) of culture-tubes in one single experiment , so that the preparation of these alone for an extensive series of investigations must become an intolerable burden .
A still weaker point in the method lies in the necessity of so selecting the quantity of water with which the glass-wool plug is mixed that , when divided into the given number of equal parts for inoculation into the culture-tubes , each shall not contain more than one organism , for , as pointed out above , it is assumed in the subsequent estimation of the number of organisms present that each culture-tube which suffers alteration has succumbed through the introduction of a single organism .
Should , therefore , the quantity of water taken for mixing be wrongly proportioned and the whole of the inoculated culture-tubes break down , the experiment is rendered worthless , as no calculation with regard to the number of micro-organisms can then be made .
Again , the assumption that each tube suffering alteration does so in consequence of the introduction of a single organism must be accepted with much reserve , more especially as the difficulty of equally distributing the organisms in the water ( and upon this equal , distribution the process is absolutely dependent ) is rendered particularly difficult through the presence of the suspended particles of glass-wool , and of this difficulty I shall furnish experimental proof later on .
Owing to the above objections to Miquel 's process , and in consequence of the obvious advantages to be secured by working with a solid nutritive medium , I have myself adopted Hesse 's method for carrying out a number of experiments on the distribution of micro-organisms in air , the results of which were communicated to the Society in June last.# This method possesses the great advantage that the tubes , after preparation in the laboratory , can be transported to the place where the experiment is to be performed , and that there are no further operations requiring special appliances .
In hot weather , however , there is considerable difficulty in carrying the tubes about , and I had to devise special precautions , which I have described in another communication , for preventing the melting of the gelatine film in experiments performed in direct sunshine .
After a very short acquaintance with Hesse 's apparatus , however , I became convinced that it was a matter of great consequence in which direction the tube was placed with regard to the wind , and that , if the open extremity * 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 40 , p. 509 .
of the tube pointed towards the wind , the number of organisms deposited in the tube was greater than when pointing away from the wind .
It is a matter of some surprise to me that no reference to this point is made in Hesse 's original paper , and that he makes no special recommendation as to the relationship which should exist between the direction of the wind and that of the tube .
In my experiments with his apparatus I have made a practice of directing the open end of the tube at an angle of 135 ' away from the wind , so that the latter does not blow into the tube , whilst , at the same time , the experimenter does not intervene between the wind and the open end of the tube .
The direction of the wind is , however , very rarely so constant that this angle can be preserved throughout an entire experiment , which usually extends over 1 hour or even more ; commonly the direction of the wind is subject to considerable and rapid local variations , whilst , sometimes , a complete change of direction takes place , in consequence of which I have , in some cases , had to reject the results .
In my later experiments I have generally exposed side by side with the tube through which the air was aspirated a second similar tube by way of control , and I have ascertained that the number of colonies making their appearance in the control-tube frequently amounts to a large fraction of the number found in the tube through which the air has been aspirated .
In illustration of this , I may quote the following results obtained in this manner :\#151 ; Experiments i Open Air .

The two series of experiments recorded above show that the number of organisms gaining access to Hesse 's tubes , irrespectively of aspiration , is greater in out-door than in experiments within doors , this difference being obviously due to the more disturbed state of the external air .
Thus , in the 21 experiments made in the open air , the control-tube contained , on an average , 0'36 of the number of colonies found in the tube through which air was aspirated , whilst in the experiments made in-doors the proportion so found did not amount to more than 0T6 .
This introduces a point of great difficulty in the interpretation of the results obtained with Hesse 's apparatus , for it is obvious that the number of colonies obtained in the tube through which air is drawn is in excess of the number of organisms suspended in the air actually aspirated ; whilst , on the other hand , it is very probable that the number of colonies obtained in the control-tube is greater than the number of excess-organisms in the tube through which air is drawn .
Thus , in the first open-air experiment recorded above , the number 158 is obviously too high , whilst 158 \#151 ; 54 is probably too low , the truth lying somewhere between the two ; but to this point I shall return later on .
New Process .
Already in the winter of 1885 I made some preliminary experiments on the bacterioscopic examination of air by aspirating a known volume through sterile glass or cotton wool , and then transferring the latter to nutrient gelatine .
In consequence of numerous difficulties with which I was then met , I abandoned this method for Hesse 's apparatus , and it was not until I became convinced of the imperfections in the latter , to which I have referred above , that I again endeavoured to elaborate a new process .
I. Gelatine Plate Method.\#151 ; In the first instance , a known volume of air was drawn by means of a hand-pump through a small sterilised glass tube , about 4 inches long and ^ inch in diameter ; this glass tube was fitted with a plug constructed of either a stratum of fine glass-powder between two layers of glass-wool or a stratum of fine sugar-powder between two layers of glass wool , which had been soaked in a strong solution of cane-sugar and subsequently dried .
The tube was slightly constricted behind the plug , so as to prevent the latter being drawn through by the suction of the pump .
This plug , after use , was pushed by means of a sterilised wire into a small sterilised stoppered bottle , and a definite volume ( 5 , 10 , or 20 c.c. ) of sterilised water or broth added , and the whole violently shaken for some 5 or 10 minutes until the plug had become thoroughly disintegrated .
In the case of the sugar plugs , this was rapidly accomplished , owing to the greater part passing into solution and .
leaving only the glass-wool skeleton behind in a fine state of division .
The glass plugs are somewhat more difficult to break up .
Definite quantities of the liquid were now taken out by means of a sterilised pipette , and added to peptone-gelatine , with which plates were poured in the ordinary way .
The colonies subsequently making their appearance on these plates were counted as in the examination of water , and thus the number of organisms present on the whole plug was calculated .
The following details of some experiments will serve to illustrate the method of procedure :\#151 ; I. Science Schools , South Kensington Museum .

101'5 X 10 = 1015 , , 10 " ' " The experiments recorded above , although yielding in many cases very concordant results , point to several imperfections in the process , of which the more important are the following:\#151 ; 1 .
A very considerable volume of air has to be aspirated in order that the small fractions ( yq or -2^ ) , which can alone be examined by plate cultivation , shall yield a sufficient number of colonies for accurate estimation .
Thus , even when 119 litres of air were employed , the plates ( each of which represented yq of this volume ) generally only contained from 20-30 colonies .
2 .
A more serious objection is to be found in the difficulty of obtaining concordant plates put up from the water or broth with which the plug is mixed .
This is due to the want of homogeneity caused by the material of the plug being suspended in the liquid .
It was in order to reduce this disturbing suspended matter to a minimum that I constructed the plugs of sugar-powder and glass-wool coated with sugar , so that nearly the whole plug dissolved away , this construction being also intended to ensure the detachment of the organisms from the material of the plug by which they were arrested .
But even the small proportion of insoluble matter in these sugared plugs is sufficient to prevent that uniformity in the plates prepared from one and the same plug which is essential to the quantitative accuracy of the process .
That the discrepancies often observed in the case of the plates prepared with these glass-wool plugs is due to the suspended glass-wool and not to any inherent defect in the quantitative accuracy of the method of plate-cultivation in general is conclusively proved by the extraordinary concordance of the plate-cultivations of ordinary waters .
Thus I may quote the following results from my examinations of the London waters for the Local Government Board :\#151 ; THE MICRO-ORGANISMS PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE .
1 Colonies obtained from 1 c.c. of water ; i. II .
Chelsea , Sept. 1886 83 90 West Middlesex 31 23 Southwark 56 42 Grand Junction 18 16 Lambeth 61 57 New River 19 15 River Thames at Hampton 8,300 8,500 River Lea 3,500 4,000 Now many of the discrepancies observed between similar plates prepared from the air plugs are largely in excess of anything observed in the case of these ordinary water plates , and it is obvious that when these discrepancies have been multiplied by 10 or by 20 , as is the case , the result is still less satisfactory .
This objection applies , as already pointed out , in a still greater degree to Miquel 's process , since the latter is based entirely upon the assumption that such homogeneity is obtained in the aqueous emulsion of the plug .
In order to overcome all the difficulties to which reference has been made , I have devised the following process , which I will now describe in detail .
1 .
Construction of Tubes and Plugs.\#151 ; The tubes through which the air under examination is aspirated are about 5 inches in length and \ inch internal diameter .
Pig .
1 .
A \#166 ; 0 The front end ( A ) of the tube is open , the other extremity ( B ) being slightly constricted .
At a distance of 1 inch from the extremity ( A ) the tube is constricted so as to form a support for the first plug ( a ) , which is placed just in front of the constriction .
At a distance of 2-J inches from the plug ( the tube is again constricted to form a support for the second plug ( b ) , whilst resting against the constricted extremity ( B ) there is a third plug ( c ) .
In constricting the tube , the extremity ( B ) is first constricted and the plug ( c ) introduced at ( A ) , and pushed down to ( B ) ; the tube is next constricted at ( 6 ) , and the second plug introduced and put in position there , whilst finally the tube is further constricted at ( a ) , and the plug ( a ) introduced .
Plug ( a ) is invariably made more pervious than ( b ) , so that any organisms which may be carried by the current of air through ( a ) may find a greater resistance in ( b ) , and thus , if ( b ) is found to be altogether free from organisms , it clearly shows that they must have all been arrested by { a ) .
In order to secure this relationship between the plugs ( a ) and the former is constructed of a small quantity either of ordinary glass-wool or of glass-wool which lias been previously coated with cane-sugar by soaking it in a saturated solution of the latter and then drying .
The plug ( b ) , on the other hand , is constructed of fine sugar or glass-powder ( passed through sieve of 40 meshes to the linear inch ) , supported in front and behind by a layer of glass-wool , either plain , or coated with sugar as above .
Each of these plugs is about the size of a pea , and with a little practice the packing can be easily arranged to give the requisite degree of imperviousness .
Plug ( c ) is simply a piece of cotton wool , loosely packed , and serves to protect the back of plug ( b ) from any chance contamination .
The control tubes , which are exposed during an experiment , but through which no air is aspirated , are similarly constructed , with the exception that they have no plug ( ) .
The tubes thus fitted are sterilised by being heated on 3-4 successive days , for several hours each day , to a temperature of 110 ' C. in the case of those containing sugar , to 160 ' C. in the case of those which only contain glass plugs .
A number of tubes may conveniently be sterilised at one time in a tin box , or in a piece of wide glass tubing , sealed at one end , and fitted with a plug or cork at the other .
In this manner the tubes can be transported without fear of contamination to the place where the experiment is to be performed .
Fig. 2 .
2 .
Collection of the Sample of Air.\#151 ; The sterilised tube , prepared as above described , is carefully taken from the sterile case , and is only handled by its extremity ( B ) .
The latter is now attached by means of a piece of stout indiarubber tubing to a piece of lead tubing about 10 feet in length , which is clamped at this end to a retort-stand or other convenient vertical support , whilst the other extremity of the lead tube is attached to a T_plece by which it is connected , on the one hand , with an exhausting syringe , and on the other with a mercury pressure gauge , both syringe and gauge being mounted on a rigid support placed upon the ground .
THE MICRO-ORGANISMS PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE .
By bending the lead tubing the experimental tube ( AB ) is brought into a horizontal position , and in out-of-door experiments the open extremity ( A ) is turned away at an angle from the wind .
A control-tube is attached by means of wire to the vertical support , so as to rest in a precisely similar position to the experimental tube .
The long piece of lead tubing enables the operator to aspirate the air by means of the hand-pump without his movements disturbing the air in the vicinity of the experimental tube , whilst , by means of a mirror placed obliquely on the ground , he is able to watch the rise and fall of the mercury in the pressure-tube .
After each upward stroke of the pump , the operator waits until the pressure is equalised before making the down-stroke , and by observing this precaution each stroke of the pump corresponds to the passage through the experimental tube of a definite volume of air , which is determined once and for all by means of a gas-meter .
Thus , the number of strokes measures the volume of air aspirated , whilst the number of strokes performed per minute indicates the degree of perviousness which the plugs possess .
In the case of the air-pump used in the experiments recorded both above and below , 8 strokes were equivalent to y^-th cubic foot , or 2-36 litres , 100 strokes corresponding to 30 litres .
The volume of air aspirated is varied , of course , according to the number of microbes supposed to be present , but with ordinary London air 60 strokes of the pump , or 18 litres , were found to be convenient .
In order to make what is practically a duplicate experiment , it is my general practice to alternate the aspiration of air through two different experimental tubes , taking 20 strokes through one , then 20 through the other , and so on ; between the aspirations the tubes are kept in their sterile case .
When the desired volume of air has been aspirated through the tube or tubes the latter are at once replaced in the sterile case , and the further treatment of the plugs proceeded with as below described .
3 .
Further Treatment of the Plugs : Flask Cultivation.\#151 ; The ingenious modification of the method of plate cultivation recently introduced by my friend Dr. Esmarch , of Berlin ( ' Zeitschr .
f. Hygiene , ' 1886 , p. 293 ) , in which the gelatine , instead of being poured out upon a glass plate , is spread over the interior surface of the test-tube , and there congealed , appeared to offer particular advantages for the treatment of the air-plugs in question .
I found , however , that test-tubes were not suitable for the purpose , as the gelatine could not be violently agitated with the plug so as to disintegrate the latter without causing an inconvenient amount of froth , which , on solidification , would seriously obscure the gelatine film .
In order to obviate this , and to obtain a much larger surface of gelatine , I employ flasks , 300-400 c.c.# capacity , and containing about 12 c.c. of gelatine-peptone .
These flasks , with their contents , are sterilised in the ordinary way by intermittent steaming for three days .
The gelatine in these flasks having been melted at a temperature of 30 ' C. , the * If a very large volume of air has been aspirated , or if the air under examination is particularly rich in micro-organisms , flasks of greater capacity may be advantageously employed .
tube through which air has been aspirated is withdrawn from the sterile case , care being taken only to handle it by the extremity ( B ) , ( fig. l ) .
A scratch is made with a file intermediate between the plugs ( a ) and and the tube carefully broken across .
The second half , containing plugs ( b ) and ( c ) , is carefully laid aside on a sterile support , whilst the first half is held between the thumb and first finger at the constriction , and the broken edge passed two or three times through a Bunsen flame , care being taken that the heat does not reach the plug .
The cotton-wool stopper of one of the flasks is now withdrawn , and the extremity ( A ) of the tube is held vertically over the open flask , whilst the ping is carefully pushed down by means of a strong piece of sterilised copper wire , introduced from behind through the broken end of the tube .
The plug falls into the flask , and the cotton-wool stopper is replaced .
The second half of the tube is now taken in hand , and the broken extremity carefully passed several times through the flame .
The plug ( c ) , at the extremity ( B ) , is now withdrawn by means of a hooked wire , and this end also passed through the flame .
The plug ( / \gt ; ) is then transferred to a second flask , in the same manner as has been described for ( a ) .
The plug of the control-tube is similarly transferred to a third , flask , the cotton-wool plug at the back end having been previously hooked out by means of a wire , and the broken end passed through the flame .
The gelatine in each flask is then agitated with the plug by means of a rotatory movement , which , whilst rapidly and completely disintegrating the plug , does not cause the gelatine to froth .
In a few minutes the plug is quite broken up , in the case of the sugar plugs everything but the glass-wool skeleton passing into solution .
The flask is now held almost horizontally under a stream of water , and by uniformly rotating it an almost perfectly even film of gelatine is spread over its inner surface .
The successful spreading of the gelatine requires a little practice , and it is necessary that the stream of water should be sufficiently cold , otherwise the gelatine forms lumps ; on this account , in summer iced water has generally to be used .
It is best to allow the flasks thus coated internally to remain for an hour or so in a cool place .
They are then placed under a bell-jar , the internal air of which is kept saturated with moisture by means of blotting-paper soaked in water .
The flasks are allowed to incubate at a temperature of about 22 ' C. for a period of 4-5 days .
The development of the colonies takes place rather more slowly than in Hesse 's tubes , which is , doubtless , due to the fact that the organisms , not being quite on the surface of the gelatine , must first grow up to the surface before a colony of any considerable dimensions can be formed .
The accompanying photographs # illustrate the appearance of these flasks after proper incubation .
The counting of the colonies is effected with great ease by dividing the flask with ink into segments , and holding them up against the light .
* * I am indebted to Mr. Carrodus for bis kindness in executing these photographs for me .

2 ( sugar-wool ) , 26 , , The experiments recorded above show that when doubly plugged tubes are employed the organisms are almost invariably arrested by the first plug , and that the second or ( b ) plug only occasionally yields any , and then very few , colonies , although in all cases the second plug was constructed of a far more impervious material than the first plug , by introducing powder in addition to wool into its composition .
The results obtained with the control-tubes , which were in each case simultaneously exposed , show that the number of organisms gaining access to the tubes , irrespectively of aspiration , is , in general , nil , or at most forms a very small fraction of the number collected by aspiration in the same time .
The exposure of these control-tubes involves very little additional trouble , and should be invariably resorted to , and if any organisms are found in them a simple correction can be made , as has been done in the above experiments .
As regards the most advantageous construction of the front or ( a ) plugs , it would appear that there is nothing to choose between simple glass-wool and sugared glass-wool as regards their power of arresting the organisms , whilst the sugared wool leaves the gelatine-film in the flask rather clearer ; but this slight difference is of no material consequence .
Comparison of Flask-Method with Hesse 's Method .
Having found that the results obtained by means of the new flask-method were very concordant inter se , it became of interest to institute a comparison between the results yielded by this method and those by Hesse 's apparatus under precisely similar conditions .
There is an interest attaching to this comparison entirely apart from the question of which of the two processes is most reliable in the results which it yields , or of which is most advantageous for practical purposes , for by a comparison of the results obtained by the two methods it is possible to ascertain whether the living organisms suspended in air are in an isolated state , or whether they are present in aggregated masses .
Hesse 's researches show that the suspended organisms of the air are specifically isolated , that is to say , that organisms of two or more different kinds are not found adhering together , for the individual colonies which result from their deposition in his tubes , or on the surface of any solid medium , are pure cultivations and not mixtures of organisms .
THE MICRO-ORGANISMS PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE .
My experience is entirely in accord with Hesse 's observations on this point .
It is obvious , however , that any individual colony in Hesse 's tubes may result either from the deposition of a single organism or from the deposition of an aggregate of organisms of one and the same kind .
Now , in the new method described above , any aggregates of this kind would , in the process of agitating the plug with the gelatine , become broken up , and a number of colonies would result from that which , in Hesse 's method , would yield a single colony only .
In comparing the two methods , there was , therefore , no d 'priori reason for anticipating that the results obtained should bear any similarity to each other , and , since there is nothing to render the existence of such aggregates improbable , it would not have been at all surprising to find the number of colonies yielded by the flask-method in excess , and even very largely in excess , of the number obtained by Hesse 's apparatus from the same volume of the same air .
A number of experiments were carried out with this double object in view , the results of which are recorded below .

These experiments clearly demonstrate that the results obtained by the flask method and by Hesse 's method are in remarkable concord when the experiments are THE MICRO-ORGANISMS PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE .
performed in-doors , or on very calm days out-of-doors , whilst when performed in a disturbed atmosphere , more especially when the direction of the wind is variable , or , what amounts to the same thing , when the number of colonies in the control-tube , which I employ with Hesse 's apparatus , amounts to a considerable fraction of the number found in the Hesse tube through which air has been aspirated , the results obtained by Hesse 's method are markedly in excess of those obtained by the flask method .
The only conclusion with regard to Hesse 's method which can be drawn from the issue of these experiments is this , that in undisturbed air it yields results which can lay claim to a fair degree of accuracy , but that when the atmosphere is disturbed , more especially by currents variable in direction , the results are often very considerably above the truth .
For practical purposes , therefore , it may be taken that when a control-HESSE-tube , such as I have employed , yields practically no colonies the result by Hesse 's method is accurate , but that when such a tube yields a considerable number of colonies the result is too high .
The fact that the flask method and Hesse 's method yield practically coincident results when the latter ( Hesse 's ) is employed under circumstances in which it is reliable ( i.e. , in calm air ) gives a clear and unmistakable answer to the question , which I have already referred to , as to whether the suspended organisms in the air exist there in an isolated condition , or in aggregates of greater or less magnitude .
The coincidence between the results obtained by these two methods is only explicable , in fact , on the supposition that the aerial micro-organisms are present as isolated individuals , for , were they present in aggregates , the results yielded by the flask-method would be in excess ; and if the magnitude of the aggregates was great , in enormous excess of those obtained by Hesse 's method , as in the process of agitation with the liquid gelatine to which they are subjected in the flask-method , these aggregates would necessarily become broken up into lesser aggregates , at any rate , if not into the ultimate individuals of which they are composed .

Gesundheitsamte , ' vol. 2 , 1884 , p. 187 ) , draws the following conclusion with regard to this point :\#151 ; .
" The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed in the tube are moulds indicates that the mould-germs present in the air are on the average lighter than the bacterial germs , and leads to the conclusion that the aerial bacteria are not present as isolated individuals , but as aggregates of individuals or adhering to carriers in such a manner that on the average they weigh heavier than the % # " In beiden Rdhren sind die aussersten Colonien Pilzcolonien .
Diese ... .
auffallig hervortretende Erscheinung zeigt , dass die in der Luft enthaltenen Pilzkeime durchschnittlich leichter sind als die Bacterienkeime , undfiihrt zu dem Schlusse , dass die Bacterien nicht als einzelne Individuen isolirt in der Luft enthalten sind , sondern als Haufchen von Individuen , oder an Tragern liaftend derart , dass sie durchschnittlich etwas schwerer wiegen als Pilzsporen .
" The one alternative suggested by Hesse as possibly accounting for the undoubtedly slower deposition of the mould germs is thus rendered untenable , since neither mould germs nor bacterial germs appear to be present in air as aggregates , but as isolated individuals , and some other explanation of this difference in their behaviour must therefore be resorted to .
The advantages which appear to me to attach to the new method of quantitatively determining the micro-organisms of the air , which I have described in the preceding pages , may be briefly summarized as follows :\#151 ; 1 .
The method possesses all the well-recognised advantages pertaining to the use of a solid cultivating medium .
2 .
The results , as tested by the comparison of parallel experiments , can lay claim to a high degree of quantitative accuracy .
3 .
The results , as tested by control experiments , are not appreciably affected by aerial currents , which prove such a disturbing factor in the results obtained by some other methods .
4 .
The collection of an adequate sample of air occupies a very short space of time , so that a much larger volume of air can be conveniently operated upon than is the case with Hesse 's method .
Thus , whilst the aspiration of 10 litres of air through Hesse 's apparatus takes about three-quarters of an hour , by the new method about 48 litres can be drawn through the tube in the same time , whilst a better plan is to take two tubes and alternately draw a definite volume of air through each , as by this means duplicate results are obtained .
5 .
As the whole plug upon which the organisms from a given volume of air are deposited is submitted to cultivation without subdivision , no error is introduced through the multiplication of results obtained from aliquot parts , and all the great difficulties attending equal subdivision are avoided .
6 .
The risk of aerial contamination in the process of flask-cultivation is practically nil .
7 .
The apparatus required being very simple and highly portable , the method is admirably adapted for the performance of experiments at a distance from home and in the absence of special laboratory appliances .
I must express my thanks to Mr. Hart , A.R.S M. , for the zeal and patience with which he has assisted me in this investigation .
