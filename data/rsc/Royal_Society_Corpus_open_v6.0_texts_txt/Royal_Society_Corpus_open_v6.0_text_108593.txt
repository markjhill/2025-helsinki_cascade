To every p-edral q-acron , or solid having p faces and q summits , corresponds a q-edral p-acron , whose q faces have the same order ( of succession ) and rank ( as to number of edges ) with the q summits , and whose p summits correspond in the same way to the p faces , of the q-acron .
When p=q , the corresponding pair will sometimes be identical figures , as to the number , rank and arrangement of their faces and summits ; whilst at other times , as will always be the case if p is not =q , the two figures will differ .
When they differ they may be called a sympolar pair of heteropolars , or simply a sympolar pair ; when they are the same figure , it may be called an autopolar polyedron .
An elegant method of representing an imtnense number of sympolar pairs and autopolars , may be deduced from the property enunciated in the theoremts following , A. and B. Def.-Any most-angled face of a polyedron being taken as its base , the angles of the base may be called base-summits , the remaining angles of the faces either collateral or synacral with the base may be termed wall-summits , and all summits lying only in faces neither collateral nor synacral with the base , we may name crownsummits .
If a polyedron has base-summits aa2a3 ... , wall-summits b , b2b , ... , and crownsummits besides , the latter may consist of a system c1c2c , ... lying in faces that contain also some of b , b2b , ... , and an interior system d , d2d , ... not lying in faces containing any of b , b2b3 ... .
The summits dd2d , ... may be looked at as wallW-summits referred to c1c2c3 ... as base-summits , and as crown-summits referred to blb2b3 ... as base-summits .
And there may be any number of systems of crown-summits interior to d , d2d , ... , as e3e2e , ... leading up toff2f , f ... &amp;c. A. If in any q-acron there are either no crown-summits , or if from each of the wallsummits b , b , b ... there passes an edge to one of the crown-summits cl , c2c ... , and from each of c1C2c , ... an edge to one of d 3d2d , ... , and from each of dl , d , d ... an edge to one of e , ee , ... , and so on , the q sumlnits of the q-acron are the angles of a closed q-gon , whose q sides are all edges of the q-acron .
B. If in any p-edron there are either no faces y7l7s ... , of which none has any summit collateral or synacral with the most-angled summit S of the p-edron , or if each of the faces P1/ 3 ... .
about S is collateral with some one of y17273-. .
, a closed polygon of p sides can be drawn on the faces of the figtre , so as to have a side on every face , and to pass through no summit .
There is no use in perplexing further the enunciation of B , as its truth follows from , and its extent is parallel with , that of A. Nor is it worth while to trouble the reader with demonstrations of these properlties , since they are not properties of all polyedra , a negative which may however be worth the proving .
It may suffice , and may perhaps be useful , to show the connexion between these closed polygons and a pleasing mode of representation .
Let us suppose that in any p-edral q-acron we have traced the closed p-gon through the faces , and the closed q-gon through the summits , and let the edges of the p-gon be numbered in order 1 2 ... p , and the angles of the q-gon 1 2 ... q. Thus are all the faces and summits of the p-edral q-acron numbered , in the circles 12 3 ... pl2. .
, and 12 3 ... q12. .
Any edge of the figure may be read abed , a and c being its left and right summits , and b and d its upper and lower faces , or cdab , which is the same thing , turning the figure about .
In the same face d we read , passing towards the right from c to the summit e , the edge cfed or edcf , in the two faces d and f. Thus it appears that , in the reading of the edges , any consecutive and external duad , as cdl in abed , will occur reversed and internal , as dc in edcf , and vice versed .
We can thus represent the p+q+2 edges of the p-edral q-acron by as many quadruplets , so formed , that every contiguous internal or external duad shall occur again reversed as an external or internal duad ; the quadruplets being all read from left to right .
Let xyx , y , , x2yx , y , be two of these quadruplets .
The former is an edge at the xth summit and in the yth face , and also at the x , th summit and in the y , th face .
The like is conceived of the latter .
At the points xy and x , y , referred to right axes , write a , at x , y1 and xIy2 write b , and so on with all the p+q+2 edges abed ... .
The result is a paradigm of the figure and its sympolar .
The horizontal multiplets will be the faces , denoted by their edges , the vertical ones the summits so denoted , or vice versed .
The edges in summit or face will stand in their true order .
For the closed q-gon through the summits , if it leaves any face before it has completed the circuit thereof , must return to it to complete that in the same direction ; otherwise it would cross its own path and pass more than once through one or more summits , which is impossible , as it has only q sides .
Every pyramid is autopolar .
If the base be ( 2n+l)-gonal , the system of edges is denoted by 4n+2 quadruplets in pairs of the form abed , deba ; or as well by as many in pairs of the form abed , dabc .
Either edge in any pail lies between the poles of the faces through the other .
I call these two edges ( aA ) a gamic pair , and either is the gamic of the other .
Thus the pentagonal pyramid is represented by either of the systems , a 1356 b 2416 c 3526 d 4136 e 5246 A 6531 , B 6142 , C 6253 , D 6314 , E 6425 , 414 a 1126 b 2536 c 3446 d 4356 e 5226 A 6112 , B 6253 , C 6344 , D 6435 , E 6522 , giving the paradigms .

Ebcde a. eabed The first arrangement may be so folded that A shall fall upon a , B upon b , &amp;c. The second cannot .
Every e-gonal face is polar to an e-edral summit , the face and summit showing letters on their edges of like names and succession .
And every contiguous duad , as aD , in a horizontal line , is contiguous also in a vertical line , if we observe that the extremes of any multiplet are a contiguous duad .
This shows that any angle aD in a face is also ait angle in a summit , a property which the paradigm of course always has , whether of autopolar or heteropolar figure .
It is observable , that in the first arrangement no edge a meets its gamnic A in a point ; whilst in the second we see the angles aA and cC , which may be denominated nodal angles , in the nodalface aEA , at the nodal summit aAe .
The 2m-gonal pyramid can only be represented by pairs of quadruplets of the second form , abed , dabc .
Thus for m=3 , the system a 1127 b 2637 c 3547 d 4457 e 5367 f 6217 A 7112 , B 7263 , C7354 , D 7445 , E7536 , F7621 gives this paradigm , showing two nodal gamic pairs aA and dD , a F. .

dC D. c D. E. b E ... Ffabcde The reason why the ( 2m+1)-gonal pyramid has the first arrangement as well as the second , is , that every base-summit may be taken for the pole of the wall-face opposite it .
In the 2m-gonal no suminit is opposite to a face , nor can the interval between a base summit and its polar-wall face be constant .

cga These are both autopolar octaedra having , like the preceding , a pentagonal , two quadrilateral , and five triangular faces .
They are all three different figures .
In the first , the pentagon bedea has every other face either collateral or synacral with it , forfBC and DEG , the only ones not collatelal with it , have the summits fCae , and aDGb common with it , as is evident from the duads fC and DG .
And its two quadrilaterals AdgB and AEFc have the common side A. The second octaedron has also its pentagon either collateral or synacral with every other face , but its two quadrilaterals have not a common side .
The third has a crown triangle AbG , neither collateral nor synacral with the pentagon fegBD , for none of the angles Ab , bG , GA are in the summits of that pentagon .
416 IrI I The following gives a symrpolar pair of octaedra , having each a pentagon , two quadrilaterals , and five triangles:a 1228 , b2338 , c3344 , d4554 , e5566 , f7667 , g8118 , h1142 , i2243 , j3456 , k3678 , 18541 , m6587 , n7788 ; h ... .

The reader will find no difficulty in drawing these octaedra , by joining the angles of a pentagon to three included wall-summits .
It is to be observed , that in all these sets of quadruplets representing any p-edral q-acron , if we collect those which contain any given numeral in the same place , we shall find that in the two adjoining places they exhibit circles of the same numbers differing by one cyclical step .
Thus , collecting from the above the quadruplets containing 8 in the fourth place , 8118 , 1228 , 2338 , 3678 , 7788 , show the circle 81237 in the first and third places .
And those containing I in the second place , 8118 , 1142 , 4185 , show the circle 814 in the first and third .
From this property of the closed p-gon and q-gon of props .
A. and B , it is possible that some light may be thrown , when the matter is better handled , on the classification of polyedra , such as may lead to the solution of the problem of their enumeration .
It is easy to prove that there are polyedra on which the closed polygons cannot be drawn .
For suppose the q-gon of prop. A. drawn on a q-acron .
In making the circuit of any face G which we enter across an edge FG , which is not an edge of the q-gon , we add to the number of summits counted in F and other faces , all the summits of G , except two , these two having been enumerated in the circuit of F from which we enter G. That is , counting first all the summits of the base , we add to these for every m-gon whose circuit we proceed to make , m-2 summits more .
The number of faces , connected with each other and with the base by edges , not part of the closed q-gon , whose circuits the closed q-gon makes and includes , will be Oa3+G4+c 5+a ... 3+.k where c , is the number of m-gons among them , and ac that 417 of the k-gons , the base being one of these .
The whole number of summits will therefore be s3+24-24+3s-+ ... .
+(k -2)%k+2=q ; for we have counted all the summits of one k-gon , viz. of the base .
In order , then , that such a q-gon should be possible , it is necessary that among the p faces of our p-edral q-acron , there should be a , triangles , 0c , quadrilaterals , z5 , pentagons , &amp;c. , of which the above equation can be affirmed .
Now if q should be odd , and all the p faces even-angled , this equation becomes 2a+ 4a-6+ 6a8+ &amp;c. =2r+ 1 , which is impossible .
Hence it appears , that if the number of summits of a q-acron be odd , while the faces are all even-angled , the closed q-gon cannot be drawn through its summits .
I find exceedingly few polyedra on which the closed p-gon and q-gon cannot be drawn .
In fact , it is far from being necessary to their existence , that all the conditions of the theorems A and B should be filfilled .
If we cut in two the cell of the bee by a section of its six parallel edges , we have a 13-acron , whose faces are one hexagon and nine quadrilaterals .
The closed 13-gon cannot be drawn .
But if a line be drawn from the triedral vertex to the opposite angle of one of the quadrilaterals about that vertex , and this quadrtilateral sllpposed broken into two triangles having that line for their common edge , we shall then have a 13-acron whose faces are one hexagon , eight quadrilaterals , and two triangles ; and whose summits are nine triaces and two tessaraces .
Of this figure the paradigm can be constructed .
Here I would fain beg the reader 's permission to call a 5-edral summit a pentace , a 6or 7-edral summit a hexace or a heptace .
The words are at least convenient in speaking of the summits of polyacra .
As authorities and analogy are alike divided about the spelling of the word polyedron , I have pleased myself herein .
