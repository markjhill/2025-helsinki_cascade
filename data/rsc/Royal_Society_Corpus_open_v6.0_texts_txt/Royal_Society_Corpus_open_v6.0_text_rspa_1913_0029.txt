) In a number of most interesting papers Prof. R. W. Wood* has shown that it is possible to obtain from iodine vapour at ordinary room temperatures , under the stimulation of light from the mercury arc , a fluorescence spectrum , consisting of a number of lines ranging from A , = 7005*5 A.U. to X = 5337*63 A.U. Further , he has shown that these lines can be divided into three series , one of which is stimulated by the light from the green line A = 5460*74 A.U. , another by the light from the yellow line A = 5769*60 A.U. , and a third by the light from the yellow line A = 5790*66 A.U. Up to the present , he has identified in his photographs some 23 members in the series stimulated by the mercury green line , 10 members in that excited by the yellow line of shorter wave-length , and 13 members in the series arising from the excitation of the yellow line of greater wave-length .
Moreover , by using apparatus of high resolving power , he has recently been able to show that in nearly every case the members of the green line series are complex and are in reality close doublets accompanied by a number of fainter companions .
The members of the series due to the yellow line A = 5769*60 A.U. are also complex , he finds , but they appeared as doublets when a Cooper Hewitt arc was used as the source of the stimulating light , and as triplets when the light from a quartz-mercury arc lamp was used as the source of excitation .
The series of lines stimulated by the line A = 5790*66 A.U. he also finds to be complex , but the constitution of the members of this series is not uniform , some of them being single lines , others doublets , and one even a triplet .
The three lines X = 546074 i.U. , X = 5769-60 A.U. , and X = 5790-66 A.U. , which Prof. Wood used in his investigation , as is well known , are among the strongest in the mercury arc spectrum , and the absence of any resonance lines of wave-lengths shorter than A = 5337*63 A.U. suggests that , possibly , had a more intense source been used , or a modification in the method of illumination been adopted , some evidence might have been obtained of the excitation of additional series of resonance or fluorescence lines by the light * R.

[ Mar. 11 , from other lines in the mercury arc spectrum , and especially by that from the stronger lines in the ultra-violet region .
In view of the possible existence of such an excitation , it seemed to the writer worth while to see if any indication of such resonance or fluorescence spectra could be obtained , and the following paper gives a short account of some experiments arranged with that end in view .
First of all , however , it seemed advisable to repeat Prof. Wood 's experiments , and efforts were directed to see if any improvement could be made in the method of illumination used by him , so as to reduce , if possible , the time of exposure to obtain good photographs .
After trying a number of arrangements , it was found that very satisfactory results could be obtained by illuminating the iodine vapour by the light from a number of Cooper Hewitt mercury arc lamps , placed parallel to each other and as close together as possible .
Each of these lamps , it is known , furnishes a luminous discharge from 50 to 60 cm .
in length , and when from four to six of them are used one can very conveniently obtain an exceedingly powerful illumination , as well as one of considerable extent .
With this arrangement it was found that very good results could be obtained with about two hours ' exposure , and fig. 1 , Plate 4 , is an example of a photograph obtained with this arrangement in that time .
The iodine vapour was contained in a highly exhausted glass tube , about 70 cm .
long and 3 cm .
in diameter , which was illuminated by the light from four Cooper Hewitt lamps , placed parallel to it and as close to it as they could be set up .
The photograph was taken with a Hilger constant deviation spectroscope , with the collimator directed towards the rounded end of the iodine tube .
The figure shows quite clearly the resonance lines stimulated by the green line , and a number of the members of the two series due to the two yellow lines .
Several plates were taken similar to this one with two-hour exposures , and they all showed quite clearly 20 out of the 23 members cited by Prof. Wood as belonging to the green-line series .
On most of them , however , it was possible to make out only seven members of each of the series stimulated by light from the two yellow lines .
This was owing in part to their relative faintness , and in part , at least in the case of several members of the series , to their close proximity to the relatively much stronger lines stimulated by the light from the green line .
No doubt , with the use of screens to cut out this latter series , and with exposure of longer duration than two hours , the yellow line series could have been brought out with much more distinctness ; but , in view of a point of special interest cropping up in another direction in the course of the work , the investigation of this matter was deferred for a time .
The point referred to came out while using a tube for illuminating 1913 .

It consisted of an outer part AHC made of glass of the ordinary Cooper Hewitt design , and a second part DB made of clear fused quartz which was sealed into the former by wax joints ]c / Fig. 2 .
at Gr and F. The glass tube was furnished with mercury terminals at A and C , and carried the mercury arc .
Iodine in crystals was inserted in the tube BD , which w^as then highly exhausted and afterwards sealed off at E. With this apparatus it was possible to subject the iodine vapour in the inner tube to intense illumination by light whose wave-lengths extended beyond X = 7000 JL .
U. and down to approximately X = 1850 A.U. On examining the light emitted by the tube containing the iodine vapour by means of a quartz spectrograph directed at the exposed end I ) , it was found that in addition to the ordinary mercury lines coming from the arc in the outer tube the spectrum contained a number of narrow bands extending from about 4600 A.U. down to about 2100 A.U. With exposures of two or three minutes these bands could be readily seen on the photographs , but exposures of 15 minutes brought them out more clearly .
With an hour 's exposure they were brought out still more distinctly , but on increasing this to two hours it was found that the density of the bands was not greatly enhanced .
A photograph of the spectrum illustrating the distribution of these bands is shown in Plate 4 , fig. 3 , A. This shows a set of seven well marked bands between X = 3341*7 A.U. and X = 3131*7 A.U. , and also sets approximately equally spaced on either side of the line X = 4358*3 A.U. A limited series of bands in pairs is distinguishable between X = 3131*7 A.U. and X = 2893*7 A.U. , and a number of single bands can be seen between X = 2893*7 A.U. and X = 2536*7 A.U. Below X = 2536*7 A.U. the bands are spaced at intervals of approximately 20 A.U. , and can be seen extending down to the limit of the photograph .
The bands vary somewhat in width , but a majority of them have a width of approximately 10 A.U. A close examination was made of a number of photographs , and it was found possible to pick out over 80 bands in this new spectrum .
The positions of these were determined as closely as possible by comparison with 292 Prof. J. C. McLennan .

2915 2129 After obtaining the new band spectrum in the manner described , the tube BD was opened and air admitted .
The iodine was then all dissolved with methyl alcohol and thoroughly washed out of the tube .
The latter was then carefully freed of all moisture by forcing through it a current of dry air .
Finally , it was exhausted once more and sealed up again .
The mercury arc 1913 .

was re-established in the outer tube , and photographs taken with the spectrograph again directed at the end of the tube D. One of these is shown in Plate 4 , fig. 3 , B. The bands , it will be seen , are entirely absent , and the only lines which are in evidence are those of the ordinary well-known mercury arc spectrum .
The disappearance of the band spectrum with the removal of the iodine vapour made it clear that the spectrum had its origin in this vapour .
It did away , moreover , with the possibility of ascribing the spectrum to any fluorescence of the quartz tube under a stimulation by the ultra-violet light of the arc , or to a fluorescence of any mercury vapour which might have found its way in minute proportions into the iodine tube during the process of its evacuation by the mercury pump .
After having ascertained in the manner just described that the iodine vapour was the origin of the band spectrum , an experiment was made to see if the spectrum could still be obtained if the tube BD were provided with a window of crystalline quartz attached with sealing-wax or mastic at Ik This was done to make certain that the mastic or wax of the joint did not give off any gas even in small quantities which might act upon the iodine vapour and so lessen its power to emit the band spectrum .
When the end of the tube was cut off at D and the crystalline quartz window attached in its , place , it was found , on repeating the experiment , that the bands , and , in fact , , the mercury lines , too , came out with even greater clearness than when the end of the tube was made of fused quartz .
In the next experiment the tube was modified by making the portion BD of ordinary combustion glass tubing and providing it with a window of crystalline quartz , sealed on at D in the manner just described .
After inserting the iodine crystals in the tube and exhausting it and sealing it off at D , the arc was struck in the outer tube and an exposure made with the quartz spectroscope , as before .
In these experiments , although they were made repeatedly , no trace was obtained at all of the band spectrum .
This will be seen from Plate 4 , fig. 3 , C , which is taken from one of the photographs obtained with this glass modification of the original tube .
The mercury lines come out quite distinctly down to X = 2893*7 A.U. , it will be seen , but there is not the slightest indication of any bands in the region immediately to the right or to the left of the line X \#151 ; 4358*3 A.U. , or in the region between1 X = 3341*7 A.U. and X == 3131*7 A.U. , while in both of these regions in fig. 3 , A , the bands stand out most distinctly .
Moreover , in none of the plates was there any indication of bands in that part of the spectrum lying below X = 2893*7 A.U. This interesting result shows , in the first place , that the emission of the Prof. J. C. McLennan .
[ Mar. 11 , band spectrum by the iodine vapour could not have been due to an elevation of the temperature of the vapour by the heat from the arc , for the experimental conditions for obtaining a temperature spectrum were precisely the same with the combustion glass tube closed by a quartz window as with the fused quartz tube closed by the same window .
It is known from the experiments of Konen , * * * S Friedrichs , t Puccianty Evans , S and others that iodine vapour , when heated in an exhausted tube , emits a band spectrum at temperatures ranging about the same as the temperature of the iodine vapour in the tubes used in this investigation , but this temperature spectrum appears to be entirely confined to the region above that of the spectrum obtained in the present experiments , and so does not appear to have any direct relation to it .
It seems , therefore , that one must conclude that the emission of this new band spectrum by the iodine vapour is a true resonance or fluorescence effect stimulated by the light from one or more lines in the mercury arc spectrum ( doubtless in the ultra-violet region ) to which the combustion glass tubing is not transparent .
Up to the present , it has not been possible to pick out , with any certainty , the lines in the ultra-violet spectrum of the mercury arc which emit the light which gives rise to this new resonance or fluorescence spectrum from the iodine vapour .
Owing to its strong intensity , however , the line X = 2536*7 A.U. seems to be a likely one .
The experiments of Hughes|| indicate that a line or lines of comparatively strong intensity exist in the spectrum of mercury near the region X = 1850 A.U. , and as quartz is still transparent to light of this wave-length , it is possible that the light from such line or lines may contribute , in part at least , to the effect .
It is known that mercury vapour absorbs the light of wave-length X = 2536*7 A.U. , and it should not be difficult to use this fact to see if the new resonance bands are excited by the light from this line or by the light from the lines close to it .
By a modification of the tube shown in fig. 2 it should be quite easy to insert a third exhausted tube of fused quartz containing a little mercury between the quartz tube BD and the glass one AHC .
With the arc established in AHC this intermediate tube would be heated , the mercury in it would become vaporised , and so as a vapour act as a screen to cut off the light emitted by the lines at and in the neighbourhood * Konen , ' Wied .

295 of X = 2536*7 A.U. from the iodine vapour .
By the use of this third tube , therefore , with mercury vapour or other absorbing medium in it , there should be no great difficulty in locating , with considerable definiteness , the region or regions in the spectrum of the mercury arc from which the light comes which stimulates the iodine vapour to the emission of this somewhat extensive band spectrum .
Experiments with this end in view are now being carried out , and it is expected that information will soon be obtained which may throw some light upon this point .
A matter of interest in connection with these experiments is the complete absence from the plates , obtained with the new type of tube , of any indication of the lines belonging to the resonance or fluorescence spectrum from iodine vapour which has been so fully investigated by Prof. Wood .
The explanation of this absence , however , seems evident .
The tube BD , as is shown in fig. 2 , projected for some distance beyond the end of the tube AHC .
In consequence of this there would be a temperature gradient in the iodine vapour contained in it , the hottest portion being at the end B and the coldest at the other end .
If the light from the mercury green and yellow lines stimulated the iodine vapour , or any part of it , at the heated end to the emission of the spectrum studied by Prof. Wood , the light which constitutes this spectrum would have to pass through a considerable column of comparatively cool iodine vapour before it fell upon the slit of the spectroscope .
These are just the conditions under which one should expect to obtain an absorption of the resonance or fluorescence lines , and consequently their absence from the plates should not cause any surprise .
This explanation gains support , too , from the fact that there was considerable absorption by the iodine vapour of light corresponding to the green and the yellow lines of the mercury arc , for these appeared by visual observation very much sharper and narrower when viewed through the spectroscope with the iodine vapour in the tube BD than they did when this vapour was removed .
This can also be seen from the reproductions in fig. 3 , where the green and the two yellow lines are considerably sharper and somewhat narrower in A than they are in B. On the other hand , one cannot help asking why the bands of the new spectrum come out so clearly when those of the Wood spectrum do not .
Doubtless the fact that they do would seem to show that these bands have their origin in a system of atomic or molecular vibrations quite distinct from those responsible for the lines of the Wood spectrum .
One must remember that that portion of the iodine vapour upon which the light fell was raised to a considerable temperature by the mercury arc , and that it is highly probable , from the facts which have been brought out in connection with the investigation of the high temperature spectrum of Mr. F. B. Pidduck .
[ Mar. 13 , iodine vapour referred to above , that the molecular constitution of the iodine vapour at these higher temperatures is in all probability different from what it is at ordinary room temperatures .
It might , therefore , happen that the molecules of the heated iodine vapour would not be stimulated to emission at all by the light from the green and the yellow lines of the mercury arc spectrum .
If this were so , the lines in the Wood spectrum could not then appear on the plates .
At the same time , it might be possible that the molecules of the heated vapour would respond to a stimulation by the light from a line or lines in the ultra-violet portion of the mercury arc spectrum .
If such a stimulation had the effect of causing the heated vapour to emit a fluorescence spectrum , the light constituting this spectrum might easily pass through the cold vapour without any absorption and so give rise to the bands obtained in the present investigation .
In conclusion , I wish to acknowledge the services of my assistants , F. Mezen and P. Blackman , the one in quartz-blowing and the other in preliminary work on the photographs .
The Abnormal Kinetic Energy of an Ion in a Gas .

In a paper on " The Charges on Ions in Gases , and the Effect of Water Vapour on the Motion of Negative Ions , " Townsend* showed that when a stream of ions is moving in an electric field the extent to which it spreads out as it advances depends on the dryness of the gas as well as on the electric force , indicating that the rate of diffusion in dry air is abnormally great in comparison with the velocity under an electric force .
It was suggested ( loc. cit. , p. 469 ) that this could be explained on the supposition that the ions were not in " thermal equilibrium " with the molecules of the gas , but that their mean kinetic energy exceeded that of an equal number of gas molecules in the ratio k to unity , where k depends on the pressure and the electric force .
Townsend mentioned a possible means by which this abnormal energy might arise , namely , that the extra velocity acquired by an ion in an interval * J. S. Townsend , 4 Roy .
