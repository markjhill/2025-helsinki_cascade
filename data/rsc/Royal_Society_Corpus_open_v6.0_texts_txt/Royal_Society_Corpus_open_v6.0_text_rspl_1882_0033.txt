" By Thomas Gray , B.Sc. , F.R.S.E. Communicated by Professor Sir William Thomson , F.R.S. Received December 28 , 1881 .
Read January 12 , 1882.* The following paper is a description of the methods adopted , and of the results obtained , in a series of experiments on the specific resist- !
Jance of glass .
These experiments were performed in the Physical Laboratory of the Imperial College of Engineering , Tokio , Japan .
An account of some preliminary experiments on this subject was communicated by the author of .
this paper to the " Philosophical ; Magazine " for October , 1880 .
In that paper attention was specially directed to the change of resistance with change of temperature , and .to an apparently permanent change in electric quality which the iglass underwent when subjected to a high temperature .
Subsequent ^experiments have served to confirm the results there given , but show ( that if the glass be newly made very little , if any , permanent change is brought about by heating .
In the experiments just referred to a current of electricity was kept flowing either continuously or at short intervals during the heating .
As this might produce effects which would not be caused by heating alone , it was thought desirable to test one or two specimens for resistance at as low a temperature as possible , and then again , after the glass had been heated to between 200 ' and 300 ' C. , and cooled to the same temperature .
Experiments performed in this way have shown an exactly similar change to that previously obtained .
It appears , therefore , that the change previously observed was due to heating .
The fact that the permanent change produced by heating to a high temperature was markedly greater in specimens of old than in specimens of new glass , rendered it probable that the change was due to some previous change in the opposite direction , which goes on slowly at the ordinary temperature .
In order to put this conjecture to the test of experiment , advantage was taken of several specimens of newly-manu-factured glass which had just been obtained from the Government Glass Pi Works , Shinagawa , Tokio .
The results of tests made on three specimens of that glass are given in the following table .
The first two specimens were lime glass , while the third was a white semi-opaque flint glass , containing arsenic .
In the first column the number of the specimen is written ; in the second the resistance in ohms between two opposite faces of a cubic centimetre ; in the third , the temperature at * For abstract see ante , vol. 33 , p. 256 .

These results show a very considerable increase of conductivity ] with age , and also show a marked difference in the variation of j different specimens .
The number of experiments is not sufficient to give much information regarding this time change , but the fact that they give evidence that such a change takes place seems to warrant the publication of these preliminary results .
The measurements of resistance described in this paper were , like those in the previous paper above referred to , for the most part made by means of an astatic galvanometer of high resistance and great sensibility .
The galvanometer used had an internal resistance of 10,000 ohms , and one Daniell 's element produced a deflection of one division when a resistance of about 1011 ohms was in the circuit .
The great advantage of the galvanometer over the electrometer method of measurement is its simplicity ; the deflection being independent of the capacity of the circuit , provided no change is taking place in that capacity .
In many cases , however , the resistance of glass at low temperatures cannot be measured by the galvanometer , and in these cases , the most convenient instrument is a Thomson 's quadrant electrometer .
The method adopted in the galvanometer measurements was that of direct deflection , the current being produced by fifty Daniell 's elements , placed on a table well insulated with ebonite supports* kept dry by being enclosed in boxes containing sulphuric acid .
The main difficulty in this method is to ensure absence of leakage currents through the galvanometer .
The test used for the absence of such currents was to insulate the electrode of the inside coating of the glass vessel , and then close the key .
If there was no deflection* it was assumed that the circuit was sufficiently insulated .
Several measurements were made by means of the quadrant electrometer , and in that case the method adopted was to connect one coating of the glass , one pair of quadrants , and the case of the elecOn the Variation of the Electrical Resistance of , SfC .
201 rometer to earth ; while the other coating of the glass and the remaining pair of quadrants were connected together bnt insulated .
The resistance was then calculated from the capacity of the glass vessel and electrometer quadrant , and the rate of loss of charge .
The conducting coatings for the glass were generally made by partly tiling the vessel to be experimented on with mercury , and then immersing it in another vessel of mercury until the surface of the mercury inside and outside the vessel was at the same level .
In order ,0 avoid leakage over the sides of the vessel , it and the mercury were made thoroughly dry by heating , and when sufficiently cooled , a * , oating of paraffin was run over the surface of the mercury and the vessel .
Through this coating of paraffin a fine glass tube , well dried ind paraffined , was passed , thus furnishing at the same time a passage , md more thorough insulation against surface leakage for the electrode which made contact with the mercury .
This explanation will be more readily understood by the aid of fig. 1 , which shows the arrangement for measuring the resistance of a glass globe , the galvanometer , battery , and key being shown symbolically .
In the figure SM repreFig .

sents the surface of the mercury , Sp the surface of the paraffin , and t the fine tube through which the electrode , l , passes .
The tube , t , and the neck of the globe were in such a case coated with paraffin .
The precautions against leakage here described are more necessary when the resistance at ordinary temperature is to be measured , but even in other cases it was found advisable to begin with this , and simply allow the paraffin to evaporate at high temperatures .
The surface of the hot glass remained afterwards perfectly dry .
Sulphuric acid was sometimes used instead of mercury , and answers perfectly if the temperature does not require to be high .
If , however , Mr. T. Gray .
the temperature requires to be raised until the acid evaporates , it becomes extremely disagreeable .
The acid has the advantage that it keeps the vessel dry , and hence is to be preferred for low temperature j measurements .
Abridged tables of results for a few characteristic specimens are q annexed , and serve to illustrate the very wide range of resistance d which may be obtained by using different specimens of glass .
The variation with temperature of several specimens is illustrated by f means of curves .
These curves only show the variation with tempera- i ture through a small range , as it was found almost impossible to include both a number of curves and long range of temperature i in the same diagram .
It will be observed on examining these curves that the rate of variation with temperature is very nearly the same , not only for different specimens of the same kind of glass , but for all the kinds of glass there figured .
Other specimens , not included in this diagram , ) gave a very similar variation .
On an average it may be said that the I specific resistance of glass is halved for every 8'-5 C. rise of tem-1 perature.* In the tables of results the density of each specimen is recorded , p and in some cases the chemical composition also .
The chemical u analyses were performed in the Chemical Laboratory of the Imperial College of Engineering , Tokio , by Messrs. Fujii and Shimidzu , under 3 the superintendence of Dr. Edward Divers , to whom the author is much indebted for the great interest he has taken , and assistance he has given , in the carrying out of these experiments .
It is very interesting to notice how very closely a change of density in flint glass agrees with a change of electrical resistance , and also !
; that the electrical resistance of this kind of glass increased regularly until the density reached that point at which the composition of the glass was almost exactly that required for a trisilicate of lead , potash , ; and silica .
The very high density of lead oxide causes the density of the glass to he an indication of the quantity of lead present , and * Note added April 26 , 1882.\#151 ; Although the fall of resistance with rise of temperature generally follows very nearly the logarithmic law , the results show variations from that law which I am not yet able to explain .
The resistance at high temperatures is generally higher than would be inferred from the resistance and rate of variation at low temperatures .
It is remarkable that specimens which had a high resistance gave results more nearly in agreement with the logarithmic law than specimens of comparatively low resistance .
The resistances quoted in the tables are those calculated from observations after one minute 's electrification , the direction of the current being alternately in opposite directions , and only allowed to flow for about one minute at each observation .
The method of observation was thus similar to that described as " the first method " in my paper in the " Philosophical Magazine " above referred to .

203 hence the density in this case serves as a guide to the electrical quality of the glass .
A specimen of glass containing too much lead for a pure silicate has not yet been experimented on , but the result of such an | experiment would be of great interest in furnishing evidence as to whether purity of chemical composition and high electrical resistance go together .
When we turn to lime glass , however , we find that the density is !
no guide to the electrical quality .
Specimens having nearly the same density vary enormously as to their electrical resistance .
This , however , is to be expected , as the density may change but little , even when the chemical composition is greatly altered .
Lime glass generally contains both soda and potash , and the ratio of these two bases may influence considerably the density , while the glass remaining a good glass the electrical conductivity may not be much affected .
So far as the results of chemical composition go , however , it appears that in the case of lime glass also , a glass which would be pronounced good from a chemical point of view is also relatively good from an electrical point of view .
On the other hand a glass which would be pronounced bad chemically is also bad electrically .
.In the following tables the resistance at various temperatures of six specimens of lime glass and two specimens of lead glass are given . !
The first column contains the temperature , the second the resistance in ohms of a cubic centimetre , the third the density , and the fourth the chemical composition in those cases where it was determined .

The flask is therefore defective , for not only is the soda in excess to the lime , but the silica is deficient .
I calculate that from 20 to 25 parts of silica should be added to 100 of that glass to counteract the excess of soda .
Such a glass would be Silica 77 *5 9 *5 13*0 ?
" However , too little is yet known of the relations of composition to quality of glass to admit of positive statement .

When equal , the glass is certainly excellent .

207 Allowing the lime , magnesia , \amp ; c. , to replace one equivalent of lead jxide , this glass very nearly agrees with the above theoretical composition .
This therefore ought to be an excellent glass , and so it turns out to be electrically .
So far as these results go then , the evidence is n favour of an exact chemical compound for a glass of low conductivity .
In the following table , the resistances at 60 ' C. of numbers of different specimens of lime glass are given , together with their densities .
The first column tells the kind of vessel experimented on ; he second the resistance in ohms of a cubic centimetre , and the third the density .
