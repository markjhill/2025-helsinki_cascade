which is against the Supposition .
The same is true of the Equation Axn12Bxn2+3Cxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , for the same Reason .
CO R. The biquadratick x4Ax3+Bx2Cx+D= 0 , will have two imaginary Roots , if two Roots of the Equation 4x33Ax2+2Bx C=0 be imaginary ; or if two Roots of the Equation Ax32Bx2+3Cx4D=0 be imaginary .
But two Roots of the Equation 4x33Ax2 +2BxC=0 must be imaginary , when two Roots of the Quadratick 6x23Ax+B= 0 , or of the Quadratick 3Ax24Bx+3C=0 are imaginary , because the Roots of these quadratick Equations are the Limits of the Roots of that Cubick , by the third Theorem ; and for the same reason two Roots of the Cubick Equation Ax32Bx2+3Cx4D=0 must be imaginary , when the Roots of the quadratick 3Ax24Bx+3C= 0 , or of the quadratick Bx23Cx+6D=0 are impossible .
Therefore two Roots of the Biquadratick x4Ax3 +B x2 Cx+D=0 must be imaginary when the Roots of any one of these three quadratick Equations 6 x2 3Ax+B= 0 , 3Ax24Bx+ 3C= 0 , B x2 3Cx+6D=0 become imaginary ; that is , when 3/ 8 A2 is less than B , 4/ 9 B2 less than A C , or 3/ 8 C2 less than B D. CO R. II .
By proceeding in the same manner , you may deduce from any Equation xnAxn1+ Bxn2Cxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , as many quadratick Equations are there are Terms excepting the first and last whose Roots must be all real Quantities , if the proposed Equation has no imaginary Roots .
The Quadratick deduced from the three first Terms xnAxn1+Bxn2 will manifestly have this Form , nx ~n 1x ~n 2x ~n 3 &amp;c. x2 ~n 1x ~n 2x ~n 3x ~n 4 &amp;c. xAx+ ~n 2x ~n 3 x ~n 4x ~n 5 &amp;c. xB= 0 , continuing the Factors in each till you have as many as there are Units in n 2 .
Then dividing the Equation by all the Factors n 2 , n3 &amp;c. which are found in each Coefficient , the Equation will become nx ~n 1x x2 ~n 1x2Ax+2x1xB= 0 , whose Roots will be Prop. i. Prop. i. when nx ~n 1x2x4B exceeds ~n 1~2 x4A 2 , or when B exceeds n 1/ 2 nA 2 , so that the proposed Equation must have some imaginary Roots when B exceeds n 1/ 2 nA 2 ; as we demonstrated after another Manner in the vth Proposition .
The Quadratick Equation deduced in the same Manner from the three first Terms of the Equation Axn12Bxn2 +3Cxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , will have this Form ~n 1x ~n 2x ~n 3 &amp;c. xAx2 ~n 2x ~n 3x ~n 4 &amp;c. x2Bx+ ~n 3x ~n 4x ~n 5 &amp;c. x3C= 0 ; which by dividing by the Factors common to all the Terms , is reduced to ~n 1x ~n 2xAx2 ~n 2x 4Bx+6C= 0 , whose Roots must be imaginary when 2/ 3 xn 2/ n 1xB2 is less than A C ; and therefore in that case some Roots of the proposed Equation must be imaginary .
CO R. III .
In general , let Dxnr+1Exnr+ Fxnr1 be any three Terms of the Equation , xnA x Ax ~n 1+Bxn2 &amp;c. = 0 , that immediately follow one another , multiply the Terms of this Equation first by the Progression n , n 1 , n 2 , &amp;c. then by the Progression n 1 , n 2 , n 3 , &amp;c. then by n 2 , n 3 , n 4 , &amp;c. till you have multiplied by as many Progressions as there are Units in nr 1 : Then multiply the Terms of the Equation that arises , as often by the Progression 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 &amp;c. as there are Units in r 1 , and you will at length arrive at a Quadratick of this Form , ~n-r+1 X ~n-r x ~n r1X ~n r2 &amp;c. x ~r 1 x ~r 2x ~r 3x ~r 4 &amp;c. D x2 ~n rx ~n r1x ~n r2x ~n r3 &amp;c. xrx ~r 1x ~r 2x ~r 3 &amp;c. xEx + ~n r1x ~n r2x ~n r3x ~n r4 &amp;c. x ~r +1xrx ~r 1x ~r 2 &amp;c. xF= 0 , and dividing by the Factors nr 1 , nr 2 , &amp;c. and r 1 , r2 &amp;c. which are found in each Coefficient , this Equation will be reduced to ~n r+1 x ~n rx2x1xDx2 ~n rx2xrx2 Ex + 2x1x ~r +1xrF= 0 , whose Roots must be imaginary ( by Prop i. ) when n r/ n r+1x r/ r +1x E2 is less than D F. From which it is manifest that if you divide each Term of this Series of Fractions n/ 1 , n 1/ 2 , n 2/ 3 , n 3/ 4 , &amp;c. nr+ 1/ r , n r/ r +1 by that which preceeds it , and place the Quotients above the Therms of the Equation xnAxn1+Bxn2Cxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , beginning with the second : Then if the Square of any Term multiplied by the Fraction over it be found less than the Product of the adjacent Terms , some of the Roots of that Equation must be imaginary Quantities .
There remain many things that might be added on this Subject , but I am afraid you will think I have said as much of it as it deserves ; and therefore I shall only add the Demonstration of some Algebraick Rules and Theorems that are very easily deduced from the xith Lemma .
I. The Rule for discovering when two or more Roots of an Equation are equal , immediately follows from that Lemma , Suppose that two Roots of the Equation xn Axn1+Bxn2Cxn3 &amp;c. =0 are equal , and two Values of y ( which is equal always to x-e ) will be equal .
Suppose that e is equal to one of those two equal Values of x ; and two Values of y will vanish , and consequently y2 must enter each of the Terms of the Equation of y ; and therefore in this Case the first and second Term of the Equation of y in Lemma xith must vanish , that is , en Aen1+Ben2Cen3 &amp;c. =0 and nen1n1xAen2+ ~n 2xBen3 ~n 3xCen4 &amp;c. =0 at the same time ; and consequently these two Equations must have one Root common , which must be one of those Values of x that were supposed equal to each other .
It is manifest therefore that when two Values of x are equal in the Equation xn Axn1+Bxn2 &amp;c. = 0 , one of them must be a Root of the Equation nxn1 ~n 1xAxn2+ ~n 2xBxn3 &amp;c. = 0 .
If three Values of x be supposed equal amongst themselves and to e , then three Values of y ( = x e ) will vanish , and the first three Terms of the Equation of y in Lemma xi .
will vanish , and therefore nx ~n 1 xen2 ~n 1x ~n 2xAen3+ ~n 2x ~n 3 xBen4 &amp; c = 0 ; and one of the equal Values of x will be a Root of this last Equation , and two of them will be Roots of the Equation nxn1 ~n 1x Axn2+ ~n 2xBxn3 &amp;c. = 0 .
In general , it appears that if the Equation xn Axn1+Bxn2 &amp;c. =0 have as many Roots equal amongst themselves as there are Units in S , then shall as many of those be Roots of the Equation nxn1 ~n 1xAxn2 + ~n 2xBxn3 &amp;c. =0 as there are Units in S 1 ; as many of them shall be Roots of the Equation nx ~n 1xxn2 ~n 1x ~n 2xAxn3+ ~n 2x ~n 3xBxn4 &amp;c. = 0 , as there are Units in S 2 ; and so on .
II .
The general Rule which Sir Isaac Newton has given in the Article de limitibus Equationum for finding a Limit greater than any of the Values of x immediately follows from the xith Lemma ; for it is manifest that if e be such a Quantity as substituted in all the Coefficients of the Equation of y , viz. in enAen1 +Ben2 &amp;c. nen1 ~n 1xAen2 ~n 2 xBen3 &amp;c. nxn1/ 2xen2 ~n 1x ~n 2/ 2x Aen3+ ~n 2xn3/ 2xBen4 &amp;c. gives the Quantities that result all positive ; then there being no Changes of the Signs of the Equation of y in this case , all its Values must be negative ; and since y is always equal to xe it follows that e must be a greater Quantity than any of the Values of x ; that is , it must be a Limit greater than any of the Roots of the Equation xnAxn1+Bxn2 &amp;c. = 0 .
III .
From this xith Lemma some important Theorems in the Method of Series , and of Fluxions , and the Resolution of Equations are demonstrated with great Facility ; it is obvious that the Coefficient of the second Term of the Equation of y in that Lemma is the Fluxion of the first Term divided by the Fluxion of e ; the Coefficient of the third Term is the second Fluxion of that first Term divided by 2e 2 , supposing e to flow uniformly .
The third Term is the third Fluxion of the first Term divided by 2x3e 3 ; and so on .
Therefore supposing enAen1+Ben2 &amp;c. = c , the Equation for determining y will be c+ c/ ey +c/ 1x2e2 y2 +c/ 1x2x3e3y3 &amp;c. = 0 ; and hence , when e is near the true Value of x , Theorems may be deduced for approximating to y , and consequently to x , which is supposed equal to y+ e. IV .
Let AP ( = x ) be the Absciss and PM ( = z ) the Ordinate of any Curve BL M ; and suppose any other Absciss AK=e and Ordinate KL= c , then shall z ( = P M ) =c~c/ ey+c/ 2e2y2~c/ 2x3e3y3 +c/ 2x3x4e4y4 &amp;c. For let z be supposed equal to any Series consisting of given Quantities , and the Powers of x , as to A xn + Bxr+Cxs &amp;c. and substituting e~y for x , we shall find after the manner of the xith Lemma , z=Aen~nAe~1y+n~n1/ 2~Aen2y2 &amp;c. +Ber~rBer1y+r~r1/ 2~Ber2~y2 &amp;c. +Ce~~sCes1y+s~s1/ 2~Ces~ y2 &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. B L M cz AeKyP But when x=e then Z=c=Aen+Ber+ Ce~ &amp;c. c=nAen1e+rBer1e+sCes1e &amp;c. c=n~n1~Aen2e2+r~r1~Ber2e2 +s~s1~Ces2e2 &amp;c. and therefore z=c~ c/ ey+c/ 2 e2 y2~c/ 2~3e3y3 &amp;c. After the same manner you will find that c=z~z/ xy+z/ 2x2 y2 ~z/ 2~3~3 y3 &amp;c. for c=Aen+Ber+Ces &amp;c. = A~x~y~n+B~x~y~r+C~x~y~s &amp;c. =z~z/ xy +z/ 2x2y2 &amp;c. The Area KLMP is equal to the Fluent of zy or of c y , but cy=zy~z/ xyy+z/ 2x2y2y~z/ 2~3x2y3y &amp;c. and zy=cy~c/ eyy+c/ 2e2y2y~c/ 2~3 e2 y3y &amp;c. And consequently by finding the Fluents KLMP =cy~c/ 2e y2 +c/ 2~3e2 y3 ~c/ 2~3~ 4e3 y4 &amp;c. ~~~ orKLMP =zy~z/ 2x y2 +z/ 2~3 x2 y3 ~z/ 2~3~4x3y4 &amp;c. This last is the Theorem published by the learned Mr. Bernouilli in the Acta Lipsiae 1694 .
It is now high Time to conclude this long Letter ; I beg you may accept of it as a Proof of that Respect and Esteem with which I am , SIR , Your ~ Obedient , ~ Humble Servant , IV .
A second Letter from Mr. Colin Mc Laurin , Professor of Mathematicks in the University of Edinburgh and F. R. S. to Martin Folks , Esq ; concerning the Roots of Equations , with the Demonstration of other Rules in Algebra ; being the Continuation of the Letter published in the Philosophical Transactions , No 394 .
Edinburgh , April 19th , 1729 .
SIR , IN the Year 1725 , I wrote to you that I had a Method of demonstrating Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule concerning the impossible Roots of Equations , deduced from this obvious Principle , that the Squares of the Differences of real Quantities must always be positive ; and some time after , I sent you the first Principles of that Method , which were published in the Philosophical Transactions for the Month of May , 1726 .
The Design I have for some Time had of publishing a Treatise of Algebra , where I proposed to treat this and several other Subjects in a new Manner , made me think it unnecessary to send you the remaining Part of that Paper .
But some Reasons have now determined me to send you with the Continuation of my former Method , a short Account of two other Methods in which I have treated the same Subject , and some Observations on Equations that I take to be new , and which will , perhaps , be more acceptable to you than what relates to the imaginary Roots themselves .
Besides Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule , there arises from the following general ral Propositions , a great Variety of new Rules , different from his , and from any other hitherto published , for discovering when an Equation has imaginary Roots .
I shall particularly explain one that is more useful for that Purpose , than any that have been hitherto published .
Suppose there is an Equation of ( n ) Dimensions of this Form , xnAxn1+Bxn2Cxn3+Dxn4 Exn5+Fxn6Gxn7+Hxn8Ixn9+Kxn 10 &amp;c. = 0 .
And that the Roots of this Equation are , a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , k , l , &amp;c. then shall A=a+b+c+d+e +f &amp;c. and therefore I call a , b , c , d , e , f , &amp;c. Parts or Terms of the Coefficient A. For the same Reason I call a b , a c , a d , a e , b c , b d , c d , &amp;c. Parts or Terms of the Coefficient B ; ab c , a b d , a b e , a c d , b c d , &amp;c. Parts or Terms ofC ; abc d , abc e , abc f , Parts or Terms of the Coefficient D , and so on .
By the Dimensions of any Coefficient ; I mean the Number of Roots or Factors that are multiplied into each other in its Parts , which is always equal to the Number of Terms in the Equation that preceed that Coefficient .
Thus A is a Coefficient of one Dimension , B of two , C of three , and so of the rest .
I call a Part or Term of a Coefficient C similar to a Part or Term of any Coefficient G , when the Part of G involves all the Factors of the Part of C : Thus ab c , abcdefg are similar Parts of C and G ; after the same manner abc d , abcdef are similar Parts of D and F , the Part of F involving all the Factors of the Part of D. Those I call dissimilar Parts that involve no common Root or Factor : Thus ab c , and defgh are dissimilar Parts of the Cocfficients C and F. The Sum of all the Products that can be made by multiplying the Parts of any Coefficient C by all the similar Parts of G , I express by C~ G~ placing a small Line over each Coefficient : After the same manner D~ F~ expresses the Sum of all the Products that can be made by multiplying the similar Parts of D and F by each other ; and C~ ~ C~ expresses the Sum of the Squares of the Parts of the Coefficient C , but C~ ~ C ; expresses the Sum of the Products that can be made by multiplying any two Parts of C by one another .
These Expressions being understood , and the five Propositions in Phil. Trans. No 394 , being premised , next follows PRO P. VI .
If the Difference of the Dimensions of any two Coefficients C and G be called ( m ) then shall the Product of these Coefficients multiplied by one another be equal to C~ G~ +m+2~ B~ H~ +m+ 3/ 1 ~ m+ 4/ 2 A~ I~ +m+ 4/ 1 ~m+ 5/ 2 ~m+ 6/ 3 ~I~ K. Where B and H are the Coefficients adjacent to the Coefficients C and G , A and I the Coefficients adjacent to B and H , I and K the Coefficients adjacent to B and H. It is known that C=abc+abd+abe+abf+ ab g , &amp;c. and G=abcdefg+abcdefh+abcdefi +bedefg h , &amp;c. and it is manifest , 1 .
That in the Product CG each Term of C~ G~ will arise once as a2 b2 c2 def g. But 2 .
Any Term of B~ H~ as a2 b2 cdefgh may be the Product of ab c , and abdefg h , or of abd and abcefg h , or of abe and abcdfg h , or of abf and abcdeg h , or of abg and abcdef h , or lastly of abh and abcdef g ; so that it may be the Product of any Term of C that involves with ab one of the Roots , c , d , e , f , g , h , multiplied by that Term of G , which involves ab and the other five ; that is , it may arise in the Product CG as often as there are Roots in a2 b2 cdefgh besides a and b , or in general , as often as there are Units in the Difference of the Dimensions of B and H , that is , m+2 times ; because m expresses the Difference of the Dimensions of C and G , and consequently in expressing the Value of CG the Coefficient of the second Term B ' H ' must be m+ 2 .
3 .
Any Term of A I , as a2 bedefgh i , may be the Product of any Part of C that involves the Root a with any two of the rest b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i ( the Number of which is the Difference of the Dimensions of A and I , which is in general equal to m+ 4 ) multiplied by the Part of G that involves a and the other six ; and therefore a2 bedefghi or any other Term of A ' I ' must arise as often as different Products of two Quantities can be taken from Quantities whose Number is m+ 4 , that is m+4~m+4 1/ 2 times or m+ 3/ 1 ~m+ 4/ 2 times ; and consequently in expressing the Value of CG the Coefficient of the third Term A ' I ' must be m+ 3/ 1 ~m+ 4/ 3 .
4 .
Any Term of 1~K as abcdefghi k , may be the Product of any Part of C that involves three of its Factors , and of the Part of G that involves the rest , and therefore may arise in the Product CG as often as different Products of three Quantities can be taken out of Quantities whose Number is m+6 that is , m+6~m+ 5/ 2 ~m+ 4/ 3 times , and therefore the Coefficient of the fourth Term in the Value of CG must be m+ 4/ 1 ~ m+ 5/ 2 ~m+ 6/ 3 .
In general , in expressing the Value of the Product of any two Coefficients C and G , if x express the Order of any Term of this Value as A ' I ' , that is , the Number of Terms that precede it , the Coefficient of that Term must be 2x+ m/ 1 ~2x+m 1/ 2 ~ 2x+m 2/ 3 &amp;c. taking as many Factors as there are Units in x. Co R. I. If it is required to find by this Proposition the Square of any Coefficient E , then suppose m= 0 , the Difference of the Dimensions of the Coefficients in this Case vanishing , and we shall have E~ = E ' ~ E ' + 2 D ' F ' +3~ 4/ 2 ~ C ' G ' +4~ 5/ 2 ~ 6/ 3 ~ B ' H ' &amp;c. = E ' ~ E ' +2 D ' F ' +6 C ' G ' +20 B ' H ' +70 A ' I ' +252 K. Therefore if E ' ~ E~ express the Sum of the Products of any two parts of E multiplied by each other , we shall have E~ = E ' ~ E ' +2 E ' ~ E~ , and therefore E ' ~ E~ = D ' F ' + 3 C ' G ' +10 B ' H ' +35 A ' I ' +126 K. CO R. II .
It follows from this Proposition that E2 = E'~E ' +2 D ' F ' +6 C ' G ' + 20 B ' H ' + 70 A ' I ' + 252 K. DF= D ' F ' +4 C ' G ' + 15 B ' H ' + 56 A ' I ' + 210 K. CG= C ' G ' +6 B ' H ' + 28 A ' I ' + 120 K BH= B ' H ' +8 A ' I ' + 45 K AI= A ' I ' + 10 K K= K. CO R. III .
It easily appears by comparing the Theorems given in the last Corollary , that E ' E ' = E~ 2DF+2CG2BH+2AI2 K. D ' F ' =DF4CG+9BH 16 AI+ 25 K C ' G ' =CG6BH+ 20 AI 50 K B ' H ' =BH8AI+ 35 K A ' I ' =AI 10 K. PRO P. VII .
Let l=n~n 1/ 2 ~n 2/ 3 &amp;c. taking as many Factors as the Coefficient E has Dimensions and l 1/ 2 l~ E2 shall always exceed DFCG+BH AI+K when the Roots of the Equation are all real Quantities .
For it is manifest that l expresses the Number of Parts or Terms in the Coefficient E , and it is plain from Proposition V ( See Phil. Trans. No 394 ) that l 1/ 2 l~ E~ must always be greater than the Sum of the Products that can be made by multiplying any two of the Parts of E by each other , that is , than E ' ~ E~ ; but 2 E ' ~ E~ = E~ E ' E ' = ( by the first Theorem in the last Corollary ) 2DF2CG+2BH 2 A ' I+2 K , and therefore since l 1/ 2 l~ E~ must always exceed E ' E~ , it follows that l 1/ 2 l E~ must always be greater than DFCG+BHAI+K when the Roots of the Equation are real Quantities .
SCHO L. In following my Method this was the first general Proposition presented it self .
For having first observed that if l expresses the Number of any Quantities , the Square of their Sum multiplied by l 1/ 2 l must always exceed the Sum of the Products made by multiplying any two of them by each other ; and that the Excess was the Sum of the Squares of the Differences of the Quantities divided by 2 l , it was easy to see in the Equation x~Axn1+Bxn2Cxn3+ Dxn4 &amp;c. = 0 .
Since B is the Sum of the Products of any two of the Parts of A , that if l expresses theNumber of the Roots of the Equation , l 1/ 2 l~ A~ must always exceed B ; and this is one Part of the 5th Proposition .
In the next Place , I compared the Sum of the Products of any two Parts of B with A C , and found that it was not equal to AC but to ACD from which I inferred , that if l expresses the Number of the Parts of B then l 1/ 2 l~ B~ must always exceed AC D ; and these easily suggested this general Proposition .
PRO P. VIII .
Let r express the Dimensions of the Coefficient C , and s the Difference of the Dimensions of the Coefficients C and G , then B and H being Coefficients adjacent to C and G , nrs~r C ' G ' shall always be greater than s+1~s+2~ B ' H ' when the Roots of the Equation are all real Quantities affected with the same Sign .
For taking the Differences of all those Parts of the Coefficient C that are similar in all their Factors but one , as ab c , a b h , ab i , &amp;c. and multiplying the Square of each Difference by such Parts of the Coefficient D ( which is of s Dimensions ) as are dissimilar to both the Parts of C in that Difference , the Sum of all those Squares thus multiplied , will consist of Terms of C ' G ' taken positively , and of Terms of B ' H ' taken negatively .
By multiplying in this manner abcabh~2+ abcabi~2+abcabk~2 &amp;c. +abcach~2+ abcaci~2+abcack~2 &amp;c. +abcbch~2+ abcbce~2+abcbck~2 &amp;c. by defg the Term of D , that is dissimilar to all those Parts of C , you will find that a2 b2 c2 defg will arise in the Sum of the Products r~nrs times : For those Products may be also expressed thus defga2 b2 ~ch~2+ci~2+c~~2 &amp;c. +defg a~ c2 ~bh~2+bi~2+bk~2 &amp;c. + defg b2 c2 ~ah~2+a~~2+ak~2 &amp;c. where the Number of the Differences c h , c i , c k , &amp;c. whose Squares are multiplied by defg a2 b2 is manifestly equal to the Number of the Roots of the Equation that do not enter a2 b2 c2 defg or abcdef g , that is , to the Excess of the Number of the Roots of the Equation above the Dimensions of abcdef g , a Term of G , that is to nr s. But in collecting all the said Products , nrs~ a2 b2 c2 defg must arise as often as there are Units in r : Because the Terms which are subtracted from abc may differ from it in the Root c , as ab h , ab i , ab k , &amp;c. or in the Root b , as ac h , ac i , ac k , &amp;c. or in the Root a as bc h , b c i , b c k ; that is , nrs~ a2 b2 c2 defg must arise as often as there are Dimensions in ab c , a Term of C , or as often in general as there are units in r , which expresses the Dimensions of C : Therefore the Term a2b2c2defg will arise in the Sum of the above mentioned Products r~nrs times .
The Negative Part must consist of the Terms of B ' H ' doubled ; each of which , as 2 a2 b2 cdefg may arise as often as there can be Differences c d , c e , c f , c g , d e , &amp;c. assumed amongst the Terms c , d , e , f , g whose Number is equal to s+2 that is , s+2 ~s+ 1/ 2 times ; and therefore a2 b2 cdefg or any other Part of B ' H ' must arise in the negative Part s+1 ~s+2 times ; and since the whole aggregate must be positive it follows nrs~r C ' G ' must always exceed s+1~s+2~ B ' H ' .
CO R. I. Suppose we are to compare E~E~ the Sum of the Squares of the Parts of E with D~F~ the Sum of the Products of the similar Parts of D and F ; in this Case s vanishes , and therefore nrxr E~ E~ must exceed 2 D~ F~ .
Let nrxr=m and consequently nr1xr1=mn+ 1 ; nr2x r2=m2n+ 4 ; nr3xr3= m3n+ 9 ; nr4xr4=m4n+ 16 .
Since it is plain that nrqxrq=nrxr qn+ q2 .
Then by this Proposition , supposing mx E~E~ 2 D~ F~ = a~ mn+1x D~F~ 12 C~ G~ = b~ m2n+4x C~ G~ 30 B~ H~ = c~ m3n+9x B~ H~ 56 A~I~ = d~ m4n+ 16 x A~I~ 90 K~ = e~ The Quantities a~ , b~ , c~ , d~ , e~ , must be always positive when the Roots of the Equation are real Quantities affected with the same Sign .
The Coefficients prefixed to the negative Parts are the Numbers 2,12,30,56,90 , whose Differences equally increase by the same Number 8 .
CO R. II .
Supposing as before , that nrxr= m ; and also that mxmn+1= m~ ; m~ xm2n+4 = m~ ; m~ xm3n+9= m~ &amp;c. it may be demonstrated after the manner of this Proposition , that if m E~ E~ 2 D~ F~ = a~ m~ E~ E~ 2x 12 C~ G~ = a~ m~ E~E~ 2x 12 x 30 B~ H~ = a~ m~ E~E~ 2x 12 x 30 x 56 A~I~ = a~ &amp;c. Then shall a~ , a~ , a~ , &amp;c. be always positive when the Roots are real Quantities , whether they be affected with the same , or with different Signs .
The Negative Coefficients arise by multiplying those in the preceeding Corollary , 2,12,30,56,90 , by one another .

Co R. Since m= ~n rxr therefore m+n+1 =nr+1xr+ 1 ; and consequently r/ r +1x n r/ n r+1x E2 must always be greater than DF the Product of the Coefficients adjacent to E ; and hence the Fractions are deduced , that in Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule are placed over the Terms of the Equation , which multiplied by the Square of the Terms under them , must always exceed the Products of the adjacent Terms of the Equation , when the Roots are real Quantities : For it is manifest that the Fraction to be placed over the Term Exnr according to that Rule is the Quotient of n r/ r +1 divided by nr+ 1/ r. PRO P. X. The same Expressions being allowed as in the preceeding Propositions , it will be found in the same manner that as m E2 -m+ n+1 xD F=a~+b~+2c~+5d~+14e~ so mn+1x DF -m+2n+4 xC G= b~+3c~+9d~+28e~ m-2 n+4xC G-m+3n+9 xB H= c~+5d~+20e~ m-3 n+9xB H-m+4n+16 xAI= d~ +7 e~ m-4 n +16 xAI m+5n+25 xK= e. These Theorems are easily deduced from the Theorems given in the second Corollary of Prop. vi .
and the first Corollary of the viiith Proposition ; and the Coefficients prefixed to a~ , b~ , c~ , d~ , e~ , are the Differences of the Coefficients of the corresponding Terms in the Values of E2 , D F , C G , B H , AI and K in Cor. ii .
Prop. vi .
CO R. Hence the Products of any two Coefficients , as DF and AI may be compared together when the Sum of the Dimensions of D and F is equal to the Sum of the Dimensions of A and I. Let the Dimensions of A and F be equal to s and m respectively , and let p=n s/ s +1xns 1/ s +2xns 2/ s +3 &amp;c. taking as many Factors as there are Units in the Difference of the Dimensions of D and A. Let q=n m/ m +1x nm 1/ m +2xnm 2/ m +3 &amp;c. taking as many Factors as you took in the Value of p. Then shall q/ p x DF always exceed AI when the Roots of the Equation are real Quantities affected with the same Sign ; and this Rule obtains , though the Roots are affected with different Signs when the Coefficients D and F are equal .

A General COROLLAR Y. From these Propositions a great Variety of Rules may be deduced for discovering when an Equation has imaginary Roots .
The Foundation of Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule is demonstrated in the ninth Proposition , and its Corollary .
The seventh Proposition shows that if l 1/ 2 lx E2 does not exceed DFCG+BHAI + K , some of the Roots of the Equation must be imaginary ; and sometimes this Rule will discover impossible Roots in an Equation , that do not appear by Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule .
These are the only two Rules that have been hitherto published .
But the Rules that arise from the Theorems in the eleventh and twelfth Propositions , are preferable to both ; because any imaginary Roots that can be discovered by the viith or ixth always appear from the xith and xiith Propositions ; and impossible Roots will often be discovered by the xith and xiith Propositions in an Equation , that do not appear in that Equation when examined by the viith and ixth Propositions .
The Advantage which the Rules deduced from the xith Proposition , have above those deduced from the preceeding Propositions , will be manifest by considering that in the xith Proposition we have the Values of the Quantities a~ , b~ , c~ , d~ , e~ , separately ; whereas in the preceeding Propositions , we have only the Values of certain Aggregates of these Quantities joined with the same Signs .
Now it is obvious that if these Quantities be separately found positive , any such Aggregates of them must be positive ; but these Aggregates may be positive , and yet some of the Quantities a~ , b~ , c~ , d~ , e~ , themselves may be found negative : From which it follows , that if the Roots of the Equation are all affected with the same Sign , and no impossible Roots appear by Proposition xith , none will appear by the preceeding Propositions ; but that some imaginary Roots may be discovered by Proposition xith , when none appear in the Equation examined by the Propositions that preceed the xith .
If some of the Roots of the Equation are positive , and some negative ( which always easily appears by considering the Signs of the Terms of the Equation ) then the xiith Proposition will be in many Cases more apt to discover imaginary Roots in an Equation than those that preceed it .
The Rule that flows from the first Theorem of the xith Proposition , obtains when the Roots of the Equation are affected with different Signs , as well as when they all have the same Sign , and it is this ; Multiply the Number of the Terms in an Equation that preceeds any Term , as Ex n-r by the Number of Terms that follow it in the same Equation , and call the Product m. Suppose that + D , C , + B , A , +I are the Coefficients preceeding the Term Ex n-r , and that + F , G , + H , I , +K are the Coefficients that follow it ; then if 1/ 2 m E2 does not exceed ~m +1xDF ~m +4xCG+ ~m +9xBH ~m + 16 xAI + ~m + 25 xK the Equation must have some imaginary Roots ; where the Coefficients m+ 1 , m+ 4 , m+ 9 , &amp;c. are found by adding to m the Squares of the Numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , &amp;c. which show the Distances of the Coefficients to which they are prefixed , from the Coefficient E. The second Theorem of the xiith Proposition shows , that if 1/ 2 m~ E2 does not exceed m~ DF ~m~ 12 xCG ~+ m 72 xBH ~m~ 240 xAI+ ~m~ 600 x K , the Equation must have some Roots imaginary .
For an Example , If the four Roots of the Biquadratick Equation x4 A x3 +B x2 Cx+D=0 are real Quantities , it will follow equally from the vth , viith , ixth , and xith Propositions , that 3/ 8 A2 must be greater than B , and that 3/ 8 C2 must exceed B D. The viith further shows that 5/ 12 B2 must exceed AC D ; the ixth demonstrates that 4/ 9 B2 must exceed A C ; but our Rule deduced from Prop xi .
shows that 2 B2 must exceed 5AC8 D , the excess being 1/ 2 a~ , and the Rule deduced from the second Theorem of the xiith Proposition shows that B2 must always exceed 2AC +4 D , the Excess being 1/ 4 a~ .
It appears from several preceeding Propositions , that if the Roots of the Equation have all the same Sign , then AC must exceed 16 D : Let the Excesses 5 B2 12 AC+ 12 D = p , 4 B2 9AC= q , AC 16 D= s ; and it is plain that a~ ( = 4 B2 10 AC+ 16 D ) =q s= 2/ 5 x ~2 p s ; and that a~ =q+s= 2/ 5 x ~2 p+4 s. Let us suppose , 1 .
That s is positive , then it is manifest that if either p or q be negative , a~ must also be found negative , and consequently that when the viith or ixth Propositions show any Roots to be imaginary , the xith Proposition must discover them at the same time .
But as ~ ( = qs= 2/ 5 x ~2 p s ) may be found negative when p and q are both positive , it follows that the Rule we have deduced from the xith Proposition may discover imaginary Roots in an Equation , that do not appear by the preceeding Propositions : Thus if you examine the Equation x4 6 x3 + 10 x2 7x +1 by Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule , or by our viith Proposition , no imaginary Roots appear in it from either .
But since 2 B2 5AC+8D ( = 1/ 2 a~ ) = 200 210 +8=2 is in this Equation negative , it is manifest that two Roots of the Equation must be imaginary .
Let us suppose 2 That s is negative , and that from the Signs of the Terms of the Equation , it appears that some Roots are positive and some negative ; then in Order to see if the Equation has any imaginary Roots , the most useful Rule is that we deduced from the second Theorem of Prop. xii .
viz. that if B2 does not exceed 2AC+ 4D some of the Roots of the Equation must be imaginary : For the Excess of B2 above 2AC+4D being 1/ 4 a~ = 1/ 4 x ~q +s= 1/ 10 x ~2 p+4 s , and s being negative , it is manifest , that if q or p be negative 1/ 4 a~ must be negative ; and that 1/ 4 a~ may be negative when q and p are both positive ; that is , This Rule must always discover some Roots to be imaginary when the viith or ixth Propositions discover any impossible Roots in an Equation ; and will very often discover such Roots in an Equation when these Propositions discover none .
For Example , if you examine the Equation x4 +5 x2 +6 x2 x 12 = 0 , you will discover no imaginary Roots in it by the viith or ixth Propositions ; and though AC 16 D ( = s ) be negative , it does not follow , that the Equation has any impossible Roots , because it appears from the Signs of the Terms , that the Equation has Roots affected with different Signs .
But since B2 2AC4D ( = 36 + 10 48 = 2 ) is negative , it appears from our Rule , that the Equation must have some imaginary Roots .
I might show in the next Place , how the Rules deduced from the xith and xiith Propositions may be extended so as to discover when more than two Roots of an Equation are imaginary , and in general to determine the Number of imaginary Roots in any Equation ; but as it would require a long Discussion , and some Lemmata to demonstrate this strictly , I shall only observe that these xith and xiith Propositions will be found to be still the most useful of all those we have given for that Purpose .
To give one Example of this ; If we are to examine the Equation x4 4a x3 +6 a2 x2 4ab2x +++ b4 =0 by Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule , it is found + to have four impossible Roots when a is greater than b ; for though the Square of the second Term multiplied ed by 3/ 8 be equal to the Product of the first and third Terms , yet in that Case , in applying Sir Isaac Newton 's Rule , the Sign ought to be placed under the second Term , and the same is to be said of the Square of the fourth Term .
The Rule deduced from the viith Proposition shows four Roots imaginary , when a is greater than b , and also when b2 is greater than 15 a2 ; but a Rule founded on the xith Proposition , shows the four Roots to be imaginary always when a exceeds b , or when b2 exceeds 9 a2 ; from which the Excellency of this Rule above these two is manifest .
I have said so much of Biquadratick Equations , that I must leave it to those that are willing to take the Trouble , to make like Remarks on the higher Sorts of Equations .
In investigating the preceeding Propositions , when I found my self obliged to go through so intricate Calculations , I often attempted to find some more easy Way of treating this Subject .
The following was of considerable Use to me , and may perhaps be entertaining to you .
By it , I investigate some maxima in a very easy Manner , that could not be demonstrated in the common Way with so little Trouble .
LEMMA V. Let the given Line AB be divided any where in P and the Rectangle of the Parts AP and PB will be a maximum when these Parts are eA ~B P qual .
This is manifest from the Elements of Euclid .
LEMMA VI .
If the Line AB is divided into any Number of Parts A B , C D , D E , E B , the Product of all those Parts multiplied into one another will be a maximum when the Parts are equal amongst themselves .
For let the Point D be where you will , it is manifest that if DB be bissected in E , the Product ACxCD xDExEB will be greater than ACx A~CDEeB CDxDexeB because by the last Lemma DExEB is greater than Dexe B ; and for the same reason AD and CE must be bissected in C and D ; and consequently all the Parts A C , C D , D E , EB must be equal amongst themselves , that their Product may be a maximum .
LEMMA VII .
The Sum of the Products that can be made by multiplying any two Parts of AB by one another is a maximum when the Parts are equal .
The Sum of these Products is ACxCB+CDxDB+DE xE B : Now that DExEB may be a maximum , DB must be bissected in E by the vth Lemma , and for the same reason AD and CE must be bissected in C and D , that is all the Parts , A C , C D , D E , EB must be equal , that the Sum of all these Products may be a maximum .
LEMMA VIII .
The Sum of the Products of any three Parts of the Line AB is a maximum , when all the Parts are equal .
For that Sum is ACxCDxDE +EBx ~A CxCD+ACxDE+CDxD E ; and supposing the Point E given , it is manifest that AE must be equally trisected in C and D that ACxCDxDE may be a maximum by Lemma vi .
and that ACxCD +ACxDE+CDxDE may be a maximum by Lemma viith .
From which it is manifest that all the Parts A C , C D , D E , EB must be equal , that theSum of the Products of any three of them may be a maximum .
LEMMA IX .
It is manifest that this way of reasoning is general , and that the Sum of any Quantities being given , the Sum of all the Products that can be made by multiplying any given Number of them by one another , must be a maximum when these Quantities are equal .
But the Sum of the Squares , or of any pure Powers of these Quantities , is a minimum , when the Quantities are equal .
THEORE M. Suppose xn Axn1+Bxn2Cxn3+ Dxn4Exn5 &amp;c. = 0 , to be an Equation that has not all its Roots equal to one another : Let r express the Dimensions of any Coefficient D , and let l=nxn 1/ 2 xn 2/ 3 xn 3/ 4 &amp;c. taking as many Factors as there are Units in r ; then shall l/ n rx Are be always greater than D , if the Roots of the Equation are real Quantities affected with the same Sign .
This may be demonstrated from the preceeding Propositions : But to demonstrate it from the last Lemmata , let us assume an Equation that has all its Roots equal to one another , and the Sum of all its Roots equal to A , the Sum of the Roots of the proposed Equation .
This Equation will be ~x 1/ n A ~n = 0 , or xnAxn1+nxn 1/ 2 xA 2/ n 2xn2nx n 1/ 2 xn 2/ 3 xA 3/ n 3xn3 &amp;c. =0 and if r express the Dimensions of the Coefficient of any Term of this Equation ( or the Number of Terms which preceed it ) it is manifest that the Term it self will be lxA r/ n rxn r : But by the Supposition Dxnr is the Corresponding Term in the proposed Equation , and D must be the Sum of all the Products that can be made by multiplying as many Roots of that Equation by one another , as there are Units in r ; and lA r/ n r must be the Sum of the like Products of the Roots of the other Equation ; which must be the greater Quantity by the preceeding Lemmata , because its Roots are equal amongst themselves , and their Sum is equal to the Sum of the Roots of the proposed Equation ; and the Sum of such Products is a maximum when the Roots are equal amongst themselves .
By pursuing this Method , it may be demonstrated that ~2 B/ n X ~n 1~r/ 2 Xl must always exceed the Coefficient prefixed to the Term xnr in an Equation whose Roots are all real Quantities affected with the same Sign ; providing that r be a Number greater than 2 ; and also that ~2 x3 c/ n x ~n 1x ~n 2~r/ 3 xl must exceed the same Coefficient , if r be any Number greater than 3 .
It is easy to continue these Theorems .
The third Method which I mentioned in the Beginning of this Letter , is deduced from the Consideration of the Limits of the Roots of Equations ; and though it is explained by some Authors already , yet as I deM 2 monstrate monstrate and apply it to this Subject in a different Manner , I shall add a short Account of it .
LEMMA X. If you transform the Biquadratick x4 A x~ +B x2 Cx+D=0 into one that shall have each of its Roots less than the respective Values of x by a given Difference e ; suppose y=xe or x=e+y and the transformed Equation , the Order of the Terms being inverted , will have this Form .
e4 +4 e3 y+6 e2 y2 +4e y3 + y4 = 0 .
A e~ 3A e2 y3Ae y2 A y3 +B e2 +2Bey+B y2 Cecy +D Where it is manifest , 1 .
That the first Term e4 A e3 +B e2 Ce+D is the Quantity that arises by substituting e in Place of x in the proposed Equation x4 A x3 +B x2 Cx+ D. 2 .
That the Coefficient of the second Term 4 e3 3A e2 +2BeC is the Quantity that arises by multiplying each Part of the first e4 A e3 +B e2 Ce+D by the Index of e in that Part , and dividing the Product by e. 3 .
That the Coefficient of the third Term 6 e2 3Ae+B is the Quantity that arises from the preceeding Coefficient 4 e3 3A e2 +2BeC by multiplying each Part by the Index of e in it , and dividing the Product by 2 e. 4 .
That the Coefficient of the fourth Term arises in like Manner from the preceeding , only you now divide by 3 e ; and in general , the Coefficient of any Term may be deduced from the Coefficient of that Term which preceeds it , by multiplying each Part of the preceeding Coefficient by the Index of e in that Part , and dividing the Product by e and by the Index of y , in the Term whose Coefficient is required .
LEMMA XI .
If any Equation xn A xn-1 + B xn 2C xn 3 &amp;c. =0 be transformed in the same Manner , by supposing x=ye or x= e+ y , and consequently xn =e+ y~n , A xn 1= Axe+ y~n 1 , B xn 2=Bxe+ y~n 2 &amp;c. The transformed Equation will have this Form , the Order of the Terms being inverted , en +n en 1y+nxn 1/ 2 x en 2 y2 &amp;c. =0 A en 1n1xA en 2yn1xn 2/ 2 xA en 3 y2 &amp;c. +B en 2+n2xB en 3y+n2xn 3/ 2 xB en 4 y2 &amp;c.

That the Coefficient of the second Term n en 1n1xA en 2+n2xB en 3n3xC en 4 &amp;c. is deduced from the preceeding en A en 1+B en 2C en 3 &amp;c. by multiplying each of its Parts by the Index of e in that Part , and dividing by e. 3 .
That 3 .
That the Coefficient of the third Term is deduced from the Coefficient of the second Term , by multiplying after the same manner , each of its Parts by the Index of e and dividing by 2 e. In general , the Coefficient of any Term yr is deduced from the Coefficient of the preceeding Term , that is of yr 1 by multiplying every Part of that Coefficient by the Index of e in it , and dividing the Product by r e. LEMMA XII .
If you substitute any two Quantities K and L in the Place of x in x4 A x3 +B x2 Cx+ D , and the Quantities that result from these Substitutions be affected with contrary Signs , the Quantities K and L must be Limits of one or more real Roots of the Equation x4 A x3 +B x2 Cx +D= 0 .
That is , one of these Quantities must be greater , and the other less than one or more Roots of that Equation .
For if you suppose that a , b , c , d , are the Roots of that Equation , then it is plain from the Genesis of Equations , that x4 A x3 +B x2 Cx+D= xaxxbxxcxx d ; and therefore K and L being substituted for x in xaxxbx xcxx d , the Product becomes in the one Case positive , and in the other negative ; so that one of the Factors x a , x b , x c , xd must have a Sign when K is substituted for x in it , contrary to the Sign which it is affected with when L is substituted in in it for x , suppose that Factor to be x b ; and since Kb and Lb are Quantities whereof the one is positive , and the other negative , it is manifest that b one of the Roots of the Equation must be less than one , and greater than the other of the two Quan3 tities tities K and L : So that K and L must be the Limits of the Root b. I say further , that the Root whereof K and L are Limits , must be a real Root of the Equation ; for the Product of the Factors that involve impossible Roots in an Equation can never have its Signs changed by substituting any real Quantity whatsoever in place of x ; because the Number of such Roots is always an even Number , and the Product of any two of these Roots such as xm~ n , and xm+~n is x m~2 + n2 which must be always positive , whatever Quantity be substituted for x while n remains positive , that is , while these two Roots are impossible .
LEMMA XIII .
If you substitute K and L for x in xn A xn 1+B xn 2 &amp;c. and the Quantities that result be affected with contrary Signs , then shall K and L be the Limits of one or more real Roots of the Equation xn A xn 1+B xn 2 &amp;c. = 0 .
This may be demonstrated after the same Manner as the last Lemma .
THEOREM I. If a , b , c , d are the Roots of the Equation x4 A x3 +B x2 Cx+D= 0 , they shall be the Limits of the Roots of the Equation 4 x3 3A x2 +2BxC= 0 .
Suppose a to be the least Root of the biquadratick x4 A x3 +B x2 Cx+D= 0 , b the second Root , c the third , and d the fourth , and the Values of y in the Equation in the xth Lemma , will be a e , b e , c e , d e ; then by substituting successively a , b , c , d for e in that Equation of y , one of the Values of y will vanish in every Substitution , and the first Term of the Equation of y , viz. e4 A e3 + B e2 Ce+D vanishing , the Equation will be reduced to a Cubick of this Form .
4 e 4e3+6 e~2 y+4ey2+y3=0 3Ae23AeyAy2 +2Be+By C And consequently 4e ~3 3Ae ~2 +2BeC must be the Product of the three remaining Values of y having its Sign changed ; that is , it must be equal to ~b ax ~c ax ~d a when e is supposed equal to a , it must be ~a bx ~c bx ~d b when e= b ; it must be ~a cx ~b cx ~d c when e= c ; and it must be ~a dx ~b dx ~c d when c= d. Now it is manifest that these Products ~b ax ~c ax ~d a , ~a bx ~c bx ~d b , ~a cx ~b cx ~d c , ~a dx ~b dx ~c d must be affected with the Signs + , - , + , respectively ; the first being the Product of three positive Quantities , the second the Product of one negative and two positives , the third the Product of two negatives and one positive , and the fourth the Product of three negatives .
Therefore since by substituting a , b , c , d for e in the Quantity 4e33Ae2+2Be C , it becomes alternately a positive and a negative Quantity , it follows from the last Lemma that a , b , c , d must be the Limits of the Roots of the Equation 4e33Ae2+2BeC= 0 , or of the Equation 4x33Ax2+2BxC= 0 .
CO R. It follows from this Theorem , that if a~ b~ and c~ are the three Roots of the Equation 4x33Ax2+ 2BxC= 0 , they must be Limits betwixt a , b , c , d the Roots of the Biquadratick x4Ax3+Bx2Cx+D= 0 : For if a , b , c , d are Limits of the Roots a~ , b~ , and c~ ; these Roots conversely must be Limits betwixt a , b , c and d. THEOREM II .
Multiply the Terms of any Biquadratick x4Ax3+Bx2Cx+D=0 by any Arithmetical Series of Quantities l+4 m , l+3 m , l+2 m , l+ m , l , and the Roots of the Biquadratick a , b , c , d will be the Limits of the Roots of the Equation that results from that Multiplication that is of the Equation .
lx4lAx3+lBx2lCx+lD=0 +4mx43mAx3+2mBx2mCx Suppose that substituting the Roots a , b , c , d of the biquadratick Equation x4Ax3+Bx2Cx+ D=0 successively , for x in 4x33Ax2+ 2Bx C , the Quantities that result are R , + S , T , + Z ; while x4Ax3+Bx2Cx+D is in every Substitution equal to nothing ; and it is manifest that the Quantity +lx4lAx3+lBx2lCx+lD +4mx43mAx3+2mBx2mCx will become ( when a , b , c , d are substituted successively in it for x ) equal to mR x , +mS x , mT x , + mZ x ; where the Signs of these Quantities being alternately negative and positive , it follows that a , b , c , d must be Limits of that Equation by Lemma xii .
CO R. Hence it follows , that a , b , c and d are Limits of the Roots of the Cubick Equation Ax32Bx2 +3Cx4D= 0 , and conversely , that the Roots of this Cubick are Limits of the Roots of the biquadratick Equation x4Ax3+Bx2Cx+D= 0 , for multiplying the Terms of this biquadratick Equation by the Arithmetical Progression 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , the Cubick Ax32Bx2+3CxAD=0 THEOREM III .
In general , the Roots of the Equation xn Axn1+Bxn1Cxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , are the Limits of the Roots of the Equation nxn1 ~n 1xAxn2+ ~n 2xBxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , or of any Equation that is deduced from it by multiplying its Terms by any Arithmetical Progression l~ d , l~ 2d , l~3d &amp;c. and conversely the Roots of this new Equation will be the Limits of the Roots of the proposed Equation xnAxn1+Bxn2 &amp;c. = 0 .
This Theorem is demonstrated from the xith and xiiith Lemmata in the same manner as the preceeding Theorems were demonstrated from the xth and xiith .
From these Theorems it is easy to infer all that is delivered by the Writers of Algebra on this Subject .
THEOREM IV .
The Equation xnAxn1+ Bxn2Cxn3 &amp;c. =0 will have as many imaginary Roots as the Equation nxn1 ~n 1x Axn2 ~n 2xBxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , or the Equation Axn12Bxn2+3Cxn3 &amp;c. = 0 .
Suppose that any Root of the Equation nxn1 ~n 1xAxn2+ ~n 2xBxn3 &amp;c. = 0 , as p becomes imaginary , and the two Roots of the Equation xnAxn1+Bxn2 &amp; c = 0 , which by Theorem III .
ought to be its Limits , cannot both be real Quantities ; for it is manifest from the Demonstration of Theorem I. that if they are real Quantities , then being substituted for x in nxn1 ~n 1x Axn2+ ~n 2xBxn3 &amp;c. the Quantities that result must have contrary Signs , and consequently the Root p , whereof they are Limits , must be a real Root ;
