A Letter from John Martyn , M. D. Prof. Botan. Cantab .
&amp; F.R.S. to the President , concerning an Aurora Borealis seen February 16 .
1749-50 .
SIR , Chelsey , Feb. 21 .
1749-50 .
ON Friday the 16th there was a bright Aurora Borealis , the Northern Part of the Sky being entirely filled with a pale Light , in which frequent Coruscations were visible .
Besides these Lights , there was a perfect uniform Arch , extending from East to West : the Colour of it was the same with that of the Aurora ; with which however it did not seem to have any Communication , being placed several Degrees to the Southward .
The Shoulders of Orion were visible thro ' this luminous Arch , in the Western Part of it , and Cor Leonis in the Eastern Part .
I did not happen to see it till about a Quarter before Ten ; and at Ten it disappeared .
The Weather was then , and has been ever since , exceedingly warm for the Season .
The Walls are covered with Blossoms ; and the Hyacinths , Daffodils , &amp;c. are blown before the usual time .
I am , with the greatest Respect , SIR , Your most humble Servant , JOHNMARTY N , Read Feb. 22 .
