THE well known theorems of VIVIANI and BossuT , respecta ing certain portions of the surface and solidity of a hemisphere , form , together , a ~ ; , / , \\ single case of the following 0/ : " \ m\ problem ; which is one of C e\ .
jb the most remarkable , for generality and simplicity of r dj3a result , in the whole compass of geometry .
Problem .
To pierce a hemisphere , perpendicularly on the plane of its base , with any number of equal and similar cylinders ; of such a kind , that , if we take away from the hemisphere those portions of the cylinders that are within it , the remainizg part shall admit of an exact cubature : and zf we take away , from the surface of the hemisphere , those portions cut out by the cylizders , the remaining surface shall admit of an exact quadrature .
Let fig. i represent the nearest half of the hemisphere , where a is the pole , bdcf a quadrant of the great circle forming its base .
From every point d , on this side of b , draw the radius dC to the centre of the hemisphere , and ( if the number of cylinders is to be 9n* ) take the arc bs equal to n times the arc bd , draw se perpendicular to Cb , and with the centre C and radius Ce describe the arc er cutting Cd in r. Through all the points ( r ) thus found , draw the curve line brC , terminated at b and C , and it shall be half the base of one of the required cylinders .
It is , in the first place , evident , from the construction , that the half cylinder , whose base is beCrb , is contained between two planes CabC , CacC , making with each other the angle bCc = 9- ; consequently the whole base of the hemisphere may be pierced by Qn such cylinders as this is the half of .
Let atmb be the intersection of the surfaces of the half cylinder and hemisphere ; amd a great circle passing through a and d , and meeting atmb at m. Call the radius of the sphere r , Cr is the cosine of the arc bs to the radius r , by construction ; it is also the cosine of the arc md to the same radius ; therefore nmd = bs -n x bd .
Put bd =p ; md n= x p ; dz = .
Moreover , put A for the spherical space atmbdcna contained by the arcs anc , cdb and the curve atmb ; and let S be the solidity of the portion of the hemisphere contained between the quadrant ancC and the surface ( brCatmb ) of the half cylinder .
It is easy to see that A= -j ff cos. x 4 , S =-fC cos. x os .
4x cos. X c. f , cos. zp , q x cos. n , x cos. 4 Q. The fluents to be taken , first from i=o to A= np , and then from q= o , to = 9 .
The first operation gives Ac rfp sin. np , S fC Q sin. n(p +1 sin. 3np } sin. n7 cos. 1n , and by the second we get A= Ccos .
np r3 cos. 3np 3I S= n:{iT 3 -COS .
n -p cos. 3np } + C , which fluents being taken from np = o , to n= 9o0 ?
, are A == -n S=x - ; and if these are multiplied by 4n , we have A ==4r ; S=r ; for the whole that remains of the surface and solidity of the hemisphere after the subduction of the 2n cylinders .
Thus A and S ( for the whole hemisphere ) do not depend on the number of the cylinders with which the penetration is made ; a most remarkable circumstance , seeing that amongst the bases of those cylinders are curves of an i/ finity of different kinds and orders .
Let fig. 2 represent half the base of one of the cylinlders ; b1 Pb Cb the radius of the hemisphere , C " &amp; -. .
/ the centre .
From r , any point in the v ?
" '"'. .
_r curve , let fall the perpendicular rp on the axis ; call Cp , x ; rp , y. By construction , Cr Vx2 / =r cos. n. bCr ; now the cosine of the simple arc bCr is v which being put in the trigonometrical expression for the cosine of the multiple arc c.13 in terms of the cosine of the simple one , we have , for the equation of the curve brC .
When n = , V/ x +-y= or x -t y ' = rx , the equation of a circle .
When n = , / jvx + Y= xz r or ( x2 + y ' ) =r ( x'*-yy)2 ; and in general the curve will be algebraic when i is any whole number .
