] The method of removing a stone from the bladder , which is detailed in this communication , is as follows:-An incision is made in the direction of the linea alba , beginning at the pubes , and four inches long , down to the tendon .
The linea alba isthen pierced , close to the pubes , and divided to the extent of three inches .
A silver catheter is now passed into the bladder ; and its point being felt through the wound in the fundus of the bladder , a stilet is forced through it , followed by the end of the catheter. .
The stilet is then withdrawn , and the opening through the fundus of the bladder enlarged towards the pubes by a probe-pointed bistoury .
The catheter is then withdrawn , and the stone removed .
A flexible gum catheter is lastly introduced , by which the urine passes off .
The nsubject of the above operation was a lad sixteen years of age .
In ten days the wound of the bladder healed , and he made water freely by the urethra .
The stone was very rough , and about an ounce , in weight .
