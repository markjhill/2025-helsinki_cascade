" On the diurnal Temperature of the Earth 's surface , with the discussion of a simple formula for ascertaining the same .
" By S. M. Drach , Esq. , F.R.A.S. Communicated by John Lee , Esq. , LL. D. , F.R.S. The author investigates the several causes which influence the daily temperature of any point at the earth 's surface .
He employs the term Thermed establishmerU to denote the retardation of the effects of solar light caused by atmospherical conduction and by local circumstances , in the same manner that the term Tidal establishment has been used to express the local constant by which the astronomical effects on the waters of the ocean are delayed .
After explaining the formation of the tables and diagrams given at the end of the paper , and detailing the conclusions derivable from them , the author enters into a review of the perturbing causes , investigates the analytical expression for the daily heat , and concludes with some observations on isothennal lines , on the influence of the friction resulting from the rotation of the earth about its axis , and on the agency of electricity .
