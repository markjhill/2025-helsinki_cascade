( Received March 23 , 1917 .
) The following investigation is supplementary to a paper dealing with the .same problem communicated to the Society some years ago.* In that paper I showed that the method of deducing the inertia of an electrified system , moving with a high constant speed , from consideration of the energy or the electromagnetic momentum of such a steady state was logically incorrect ; and I developed a method of dealing with the problem which depends directly on the general electromagnetic equations , and so is free from this objection .
Application of the method to an electrified sphere showed that Sir J. J Thomson 's expression for transverse inertia ( using his surface conditions ) was correct , but that Abraham 's expression ( which involves a different surface condition ) was not confirmed .
Larmor and Lorentz independently showed there is complete correspondence between an electrified system at rest and -another system maintained in uniform linear motion , provided the linear scale of the second system is contracted in the ratio ( 1\#151 ; where h is the ratio of the speed of the system to that of radiation .
While such a contraction would provide an explanation of the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment , no proof has ever been given that a specified system at rest will , when set in uniform motion , actually undergo precisely this contraction .
This assumption is , however , tacitly made in Einstein 's theory of " relativity , " and is in fact an essential feature of that theory .
Lorentz suggested that an electron , supposed spherical at slow speeds , might undergo the contraction referred to ; and , using the electromagnetic momentum of this steady state , he deduced that the electric inertia for longitudinal acceleration would be m0(l \#151 ; A:2)-3/ 2 and for transverse acceleration mo(l\#151 ; \amp ; 2)'A , where mo or .Se2\amp ; ~1C~2 is the inertia for slow speeds.f Precisely the same results are obtained by the " relativity " theory .
These formulie have been used in discussing experiments on / 3-rays by Kaufmann , Bucherer , Bestelmeyer , and others , with results that are claimed to prove the correctness of the formula .

449 In view of the objection that I have already raised to the quasi-stationary method of calculating the inertia ( admitted by Lorentz ) , I have for some time wished to apply the more correct method { loc. cit. ante ) to the case of a \#171 ; contracted " electron .
We shall consider the electron to have a charge e in electrostatic units distributed on its surface which is of the form ( 1-k ?
)~lXi-\-y2-\-Z2 = when the electron moves in the direction of x with uniform speed JcC , where C is the velocity of radiation .
In the steady state of motion of a conductor it is shown by Larmor ( ' iEther and Matter ' ) that the field referred to an origin moving with the conductor is given by the magnetic force ( a , / 3,7 ) = 0 , \#151 ; kdf and the mthereal electric force ( X , Y , Z ) = -(1-k2)dfo/ fa , -fyo/ fy , -fyo/ 3* .
where yjr0 satisfies ( 1 \#151 ; \amp ; 2 ) d2yJro j dx2 + d'^yfro / By2 + 02-v/ ro / dz2 = 0 , and is constant throughout the conductor .
The surface density of electricity is given by 47 ra = Normal component of ( X , Y , Z ) and the force effective in moving electricity ( called by Larmor the electric force ) is P , Q , E = \#151 ; ( l \#151 ; k2)(d^0/ dx , 0^o In the present case we take outside the electron yfr0 = Ap~1 where and p2 = ( 1\#151 ; k2)~1x ?
+y while inside ^0 is constant .
Thus the conditions are secured and a \#151 ; Apa~3/ 47r , where p is the perpendicular on the tangent plane and the total charge is e. W hen the system undergoes acceleration from this state of motion with velocity \amp ; C , so that the displacement / due to the acceleration is small , the method consists in finding the modified solution of the primary equations of the field true up to first powers of f and its derivatives , and then calculating the reaction .
It might be thought that the solution would fail as time progresses and the velocity gradually increases , but this is not really so , for we may start with any value of the velocity kO and thus our solution retains its form at every stage of the motion if we remember that the proper value of the speed is introduced after any differentiations have been performed .
450 Mr. G. W. Walker .
Th Effective Inertia of Suppose , then , that the system undergoes linear acceleration in the direction of x , so that the displacement at any time is The equations for the state of the aether outside are given in my former paper , p. 161 , but the equations have to be solved in the present case , subject to the conditions that the tangential component of P , Q , R is zero at the surface ( 1 \#151 ; k2)~1x2 + y2 + z2 = a2 , and that the interior is free from electric and magnetic force .
Using the same notation as before , we find that the solution is expressed as follows:\#151 ; Let \lt ; f\gt ; \#151 ; ( C t\#151 ; Xx)2(f)\ + ( Ct\#151 ; ) 4~ 03 , subject to ( d/ dt\#151 ; kd/ dx)2\lt ; f ) = C2y where \ \#151 ; k(l\#151 ; k2)~l then \lt ; \#163 ; ] = Bp-1 , ( f\gt ; 2 \#151 ; Dxp~3 , 03 \#151 ; B(1\#151 ; where B = | p , AC~2 , D = J-XBa2 , also % = Ea ?
p_3 + F^p_5{3 \#151 ; 5 ( 1\#151 ; k2)~loi ?
where E = -|-(5 \#151 ; 3\amp ; 2)(1\#151 ; \amp ; 2)_2B and E = \k2(l-k2)~2W .
We may thus verify that at the surface of the electron the aethereal electric force is given by ( X , Y , Z ) = A a~3{x , y , 0 , 0 ) + 4BC\#163 ; \amp ; ( 1 \#151 ; k2)~2x2 y , z ) \#151 ; 4B ( 1 \#151 ; ^k2)(1 ( x , y , z ) , while P = X. Thus the surface density of electricity is given by 47rcr = Apa~3 \#151 ; 4B ( 1\#151 ; fk2)(1\#151 ; where p is perpendicular on the tangent plane .
Hence the force on the electron in the direction of x =ijo-PdS .
Neglecting squares of y ( the acceleration ) , as we have done consistently , the force reduces to \#151 ; \#151 ; A .

451 Substituting the values of A and B , we find that the force due to the aether reaction is _ 2 ( !

In the expression for there should be a term The condition is , again , that the tangential component of P , Q , B. should vanish at the surface of the electron , and that the interior should be free from force .

We find that at the surface of the electron Q = ( l\#151 ; k2)Aya~3 + 4kGt Bxy2a~ 5\#151 ; 4 B ( 1 + yL k2 ) y2cc~s ( X , Y , Z ) = Aa~3(x , y , z)--f-Ba-^l-F)"1 ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) \#151 ; 2kGtBa~s(y , ( l\#151 ; k2)~1x , 0 ) + 4\amp ; C\#163 ; B(l y , z ) \#151 ; 4B(1 + T\k2 ) ( l-k2)~la~3y ( x , y , z ) .

An objection to the preceding calculation may be raised .
It might be argued that I ought to have supposed that the contracted electron should alter in shape as the acceleration proceeds .
But the difficulty is to know how it alters .
There is no correspondence between accelerated motions at different speeds such as can be proved for uniform speeds , for the transformation entirely breaks down if the velocity is not constant .
One might , as a pure hypothesis which has no a 'priori justification , assume that the surface is deformed according to the same law as holds for uniform velocity .
This could be worked out , and might lead to a first-order term ( in acceleration ) for longitudinal inertia , but clearly would lead to only second-order terms for transverse inertia .
But this appears to me too speculative to be of any value at present .
Experimental researches on the inertia of electrons have been made by Kaufmann , * Bestelmeyer , f Bucherer , J and Wolz .
S. In my former paper I have shown that J. J. Thomson 's expression for the electric inertia agrees very well with Kaufmann 's numbers .
Using the same method of analysing the observations as formerly , I find the new expression for transverse inertia , viz. , ( 1\#151 ; agrees equally well .
I should have given this calculation but for the fact that , when # Bucherer 's numbers were examined , they would not stand such a severe test , and the method of least squares had to be used to give them a reasonable chance .
Hence , for comparison , I have treated Kaufmann 's numbers also by least squares .
The following Table is based on the Table ( loc. p. 170 ) which was originally prepared from Kaufmann 's paper .
I have simplified it by calculating p , ]e , where p is the effective mass m -f mf { k ) and / ( * ) = ( !

The present formula gives 10 = 1-418 + 4-45 - e/ l* = x'704 x 1''* [ HIsOTTWi ' while Lorentz ' gives 10fi/ e = 0-251 + 5*66/ ( \amp ; ) or ^ = 1-692 There is a slight advantage in favour of the corrected formula , but these \lt ; observations are not nearly so consistent as Kaufmann 's or Bestelmeyer 's Moreover , the Table does not reveal the serious internal discrepancies ii Bucherer 's numbers .
When taken in pairs , they give great variations in the coefficient of / ( \amp ; ) .
A considerable discussion took place between Bestelmeye and Bucherer as to the accuracy of the latter 's work , into which I do no propose to enter , but it leaves some doubt about the value of th\lt ; investigation .
Wolz , working under Bucherer 's direction , repeated some o his work , with similar results .
My attention has recently been called to a recent paper on " Cathodt Bays " by Guye and Lavanchy.* They compare their experiments over i range of speed from one quarter to one half the speed of light with Abraham 's formula and Lorentz ' formula .
There is greatly superior agreement with Lorentz ' formula .
I should have liked to analyse their data by means of the correctec formula for a contracted electron , but , unfortunately , they do not give tin original measurements , and the values of speed and inertia can only b( deduced from these by means of the formula it is desired to test .
But the numbers they give for the Lorentz-Einstein formula are readily found t( be in equally good agreement with the formula I have obtained when a small proportion of ordinary inertia is assumed .
Erom the experiments as a whole , it appears to me very difficult to maintain that they afford a conclusive proof that the Lorentz-Einstein formula is correct , and hence that the inertia is wholly electromagnetic , and that the electron is contracted in the ratio ( 1\#151 ; k2 ) % .
On the experimental side it is found that J. J. Thomson 's formula , or the corrected formula proved for a contracted electron , agrees equally well with observation , but assigns a proportion of ordinary inertia .
The experiments are , in fact , inadequate to distinguish between a number of formulae that might be proposed .

On the Coefficients of a Fourier Series .
On the theoretical side I have shown that J. J. Thomson 's formula is confirmed by the present method of analysis , and that the Lorentz-Einstein formula for a " contracted " electron requires to be modified in the manner stated .
If it be argued , as may fairly be done , that the experiments do not conflict with the Lorentz-Einstein formula , we require to give up the view that the electron is contracted in the proportion they assume .
But it is fairly certain that there is an electron of form intermediate between Abraham 's sphere and Lorentz ' spheroid which would have a transverse inertia correctly given by m0 ( 1\#151 ; k2)~*-This , however , implies giving up the correspondence assumed in the relativity theory , and we might choose between this and the alternative view ( by no means unreasonable ) that electrons as obtained in experiments possess ordinary as well as electric inertia .
It appears that still further experiments are required , and it would be helpful if results were represented in a form that could be used to test any formula and not any particular one .
The subject is still too uncertain to warrant the view that any special formula represents the end of the matter .
On the Mode of Approach to Zero of the Coefficients of a Fourier Series .
By W. H. Young , F.R.S. ( Received February 2 , 1917 .
) S 1 .
In the present communication I give a number of results on the mode of approach to zero of the coefficients of a Fourier series , to which I have already made allusion in my paper on " The Order of Magnitude of the Coefficients of a Fourier Series .
" These results are not merely curious , they have a real importance , and give one an insight into the nature of these series , which cannot easily be gained without them .
Indeed , while the earlier paper leads , as I showed in a subsequent communication , to the discovery of classes of derived series of Fourier series , which , although not themselves Fourier series , none the less converge , and are utilisable in a similar manner , and is therefore in a certain sense of practical interest , the present paper does something towards the elucidation of the general theory of the convergence of Fourier series themselves , as well as of their derived series .
It will be sufficient to give a single instance .
