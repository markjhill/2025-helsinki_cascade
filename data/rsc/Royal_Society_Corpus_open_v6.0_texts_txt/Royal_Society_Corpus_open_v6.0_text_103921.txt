~ BC qtsBPC S QT RHr YZ ~~e I. An Inquiry concerning the Figure of such Planets as revolve about an Axis , supposing the Density continually to vary , from the Centre towards the Surface ; by Mr. Alexis Clairaut , F. R. S. and Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris .
Translated from the French by the Rev. John Colson Lucas .
Prof. Math. Cantab .
and F. R. S. NOtwithstanding that Part of Sir Isaac Newton 's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy , where he treats of the Figure of the Earth , is delivered with the usual Skill and Accuracy of that great Author ; yet I thought something farther might be done in this Matter , and that new Inquiries may be proposed , which are of no small Importance , and which possibly he overlooked , through the Abundance of those fine Discoveries he was in Pursuit of .
What at first seemed to me worth examining , when I applied myself to this Subject , was to know why Sir Isaac assumed the Conical Ellipsis for the Figure of the Earth , when he was to determine its Axis ?
For he does not acquaint us why he did it , neither can we perceive how he had satisfied himself in this Particular : And unless we know this , I think we cannot entirely acquiesce in his Determinations of the Axes of the Planets .
It seems as if he might have took any other oval Curve , as well as the conical Ellipsis of Apollonius , and then he would have come to other Conclusions about those Axes .
I began then with convincing myself by Calculation , that the Meridian of the Earth , and of the other Planets , is a Curve very nearly approaching to an Ellipsis ; so that no sensible Error could ensue by supposing it really such .
I had the Honour of communicating my Demonstration of this to the ROYALSOCIET Y , at the Beginning of the last Year ; and I have since been informed , that Mr. Stirling , one of the greatest Geometricians I know in Europe , had inserted a Discourse in the Philosophical Transactions , No 438 .
wherein he had found the same thing before me , but without giving his Demonstration .
When I sent that Paper to London , I was in Lapland , within the frigid Zone , where I could have no Recourse to Mr. Stirling 's Discourse , so that I could not take any Notice of it .
The Elliptical Form of the Meridian being once proved ; I no longer found any thing in Sir Isaac Newton , about the Figure of the Earth , which could create any new Difficulty ; and I should have thought this Question sufficiently discussed , if the Observations made under the Arctick Circle had not prevailed on us to believe , that the Shape of the Earth was still flatter than that of Sir Isaac 's Spheroid ; and if he himself had not pointed at the Causes , which might make Jupiter not quite so flat , as by his Theory , and the Earth something more .
As to Jupiter , he says , ( Page 416 of the 3d Edition of Phil. Not .
Prin .
Math. ) that its Equator consists of denser Parts than the rest of its Body , because its Moisture is more dried up by the Heat of the Sun .
But as to the Earth , he suspects its Flatness to be a small matter greater than what arises by his Calculation .
lation .
He insinuates , that it may possibly be more dense towards the Centre than at the Superficies .
( See Art .
XXIV .
following ) I am something surprised that Sir Isaac should imagine , that the Sun 's Heat can be so great at Jupiter 's Equator , when it has no such Effect at that of the Earth ; and that he does not ascribe each to a like Cause , by supposing also , that Jupiter may be of a different Density at the Centre from that at the Superficies .
But whatever Reason he might have for introducing two different Causes , I give the Preference to the Hypothesis which supposes unequal Densities at the Centre and at the Circumference .
I have inquired , by the Assistance of this Theory , what would be the Figure of the Earth , and of the other Planets which revolve about an Axe , on Supposition that they are composed of similar Strata , or Layers , at the Surface ; but that their variable Density , from the Centre towards the Circumference , may be expounded by any Algebraical Equation whatsoever .
And though my Hypothesis should not be conformable to the Laws of Nature , or even though it should be of no real Use ( which would be the Case , if the Observations made by the Mathematicians now in Peru , compared with ours in the North , should require that Proportion of the Axes , which is derived from Sir Isaac 's Spheroid ) ; I thought however that Geometricians would be pleased with the Speculations contained in this Paper , as being , if not useful , yet curious Problems at least .
PART I. In which are found the Laws of Attraction , which are exerted upon Bodies at a Distance , by a Spheroid composed of Orbs of different Degrees of Density .
PROBLEM I. To find the Attraction which a homogeneous Spheroid BNEb e , ( TAB. 1 .
Fig. 1 .
) differing but very little from a Sphere , exerts upon a Corpuscle placed at A in the Axis of Revolution .
I. We may conceive the Space BNEbDM B , included between the Spheroid and the Sphere , to be divided into an infinite Number of Sections perpendicular to the Axe AC b. Supposing then that every one of the Particles , which are contained in one of these Elements or Moments Nnm M , exerts the same Quantity of Attraction upon the Body at A , which may be supposed because of the Smallness of N M ; we shall have c~~PM~~Pp~AP/ AM3 for the Attraction of any one of these Elements ; putting c for the Ratio of the Circumference to the Radius , and ~ for the given Ratio of MN to P M , that is , of DE to C D. Now if we make CA=e , CB=r , AM=z ; and for PM , AP , Pp , if we substitute their Values expressed by z , and then seek the Fluent of the foregoing Quantity ; we shall have 4c~r3/ 3ee 4c~r5/ 5e4 for the Value of the whole Attraction of the Solid generated by the Revolution of BDbEB : To which if we add 2r3c/ 3ee , the Attraction of the Sphere , we shall have 2r3c/ 3ee+4cr3~/ 3ee-4c~r5/ 5e4 for the required Attraction of the Spheroid upon the Corpuscle A. PROBLEM II .
Supposing now the Spheroid Bebe ( Fig. 2 .
) to be no longer of a homogeneous Matter , but to be composed of an infinite Number of Elliptical Strata , all similar to BE b , the Densities of which are represented by the Ordinates KT of any Curve whatever V T , of which we have the Equation between CK and K T ; the Attraction is required which this Spheroid exerts upon a Corpuscle placed at the Pole B. II .
Making BC= e , CK= r , by the foregoing Proposition , we should have 2r3c/ 3ee+4cr3~/ 3ee-4c~r5/ 5e4 for the Attraction of the Spheroid KLK , if it consisted of homogeneous Matter ; and the Fluxion of this Quantity 2rrcr/ ee+4c~r2r/ ee-4c~r4r/ e4 would be the Element or Moment of the Orb KLKkl k. But because the Density is variable , we must multiply this Value of the Attraction of the Orb by K T , and the Fluent of this Quantity will be the Value of the Attraction of the Spheroid KL K. As to the Value of K T , which expresses the Density of the Stratum or Bed KLKkl k , we shall take only frp+grq , because we shall see afterwards , that a Value more compounded , at frp+grq+hrs+irt , &amp;c. which by the Property of Series may express all Curves , would not produce any Variety in the Calculation .
Therefore multiplying the foregoing Equation by frp+grq , we shall have 2cf~1+2~~r 3+p/ ee~3+p-4c~fr 5+p/ e4~5+p +2cg~1+2~~r 3+q/ ee~3+q-4c~gr 5+q/ e4~5+q for the Quantity of Attraction of the Spheroid KL K , exerted upon a Corpuscle placed at B. III .
In this Value making r=e , we shall have 2cfe1+p/ 3+p+8cfe1+p~/ 3+p~5+p+2cge1+q/ 3+q+8cge1+q~/ 3+q~5+q , which will express the Force of Attraction of the Spheroid BE b , exerted upon a Corpuscle placed at the Pole B. THEORE M. A Corpuscle being placed in any Point N of the Surface of the foregoing Spheroid BEb e , I say it will undergo the same Attraction from this Spheroid , as if it were placed at the Pole N of a second Spheroid revolving about the Axe N O , the second Axe being the Radius of a Circle equal in Superficies to the Ellipsis F G ; supposing this second Spheroid NGOF ( Fig. 3 .
) to be composed of the Strata Mmq Q , whose Densities are the same as those of the Strata KkLlK k , of the first Spheroid .
IV .
In the Discourse I had the Honour of communicating to the ROYALSOCIET Y , being then at Torneo , printed in the Philosophical Transactions ; No 445 .
I have demonstrated this Proposition as to a homogeneous Spheroid ; and the same Reasoning will obtain in this Case also .
PROBLEM III .
To find the Attraction which the Spheroid Bebe ( Fig. 2 .
) exerts upon a Corpuscle placed at any point N of the Superficies .
V. We will make , as above , BC= e , CE= e+e~ , and also CN= e+e~ , and half the Conjugate Diameter of CN will be CG= e+e~-e~ ; whence the Radius of a Circle , equal in Superficies to the Ellipsis F G , will be a mean proportional between CE and and C G , that is to say , e+e~-1/ 2e~ .
Therefore the Spheroid BE be exerts the same Attraction at N , as would be exerted at the Pole of a Spheroid NGO F , ( Fig. 3 .
) of which the principal Axis would be NO=2 e+2e~ , and the second would be to the Principal as 1+~-3/ 2~ to 1 .
Therefore in the Expression of the Attraction at the Pole , ( Art .
III .
) we must substitute e+e~ instead of e , and ~-3/ 2~ instead of ~ .
But if f and g must no longer be the same ; for we may easily perceive by the foregoing Theorem , that the Density must be the same in this Spheroid NGO F , at the Distance r+r~ from the Centre~ as it is in the Spheroid BEbe at the Distance r. Therefore f ( e/ 1 + ~ ) p+g ( e/ 1 + ~)q must be put instead of fep + geq .
Thus we shall have 2cfe1+ p/ 3 +p+2p2cf~e1+ p/ 3 +p~5+p+8cf~e1+ p/ 3 +p~5+p+2cge1+ q/ 3 +q +2q2cg~e1+ q/ 3 +q~5+q+8cg~e1+ q/ 3 +q~5+q for the Attraction of the Spheroid BEbe at N. VI .
If we make ~= ~ , the foregoing Expression will be reduced to this 2cfe1+ p/ 3 +p+2cfe1+p ~/ 5 +p +2cge1+ q/ 3 +q+2cge1+q ~/ 5 + q , which expresses the Attraction of the Equator .
VII .
If we would have the Attraction at any Point M within the Spheroid , in the Expression of the Attraction at N , we must put r instead of e. The Proof of this is plain from the same Reasons that Sir Isaac Newton makes use of , ( Corol .
3 .
Prop. XCI .
L. 1 .
Princip .
Math. ) to show that the Attraction of an Elliptic Orb , at a Point within it , is none at all .
PROBLEM IV .
Let R~r~ ( Fig. 4 .
) be a Circle whose Centre is Y ; it is required to find the Attraction which this Circle exerts upon a Corpuscle at N , according to the Direction H Y ; supposing the Point H , which answers perpendicularly below the Point N , to be at a very small Distance from the Point Y. VIII .
Let there be drawn ~H~ perpendicular to the Diameter RY r , and let the Space R~~ be transferred fer 'd to ~~ Z. Then the Space ~Z~r will be the only Part of R~r ~ , which will attract the Body N according to H Y. To find the Attraction of this little Space , we will suppose it to be divided into the Elements Tts S , the Attractions of which , according to H Y , will be TtsS~Q T/ N T3 or 2HY~Qq~Q T/ N T 3 , the Fluent of which 2HY~HQT Z/ N T3 is the Attraction of TZr S , according to H Y. In which if we put ~~ for H Q , we shall have ~H~R~2H Y/ N T 3 , or 1/ 2 HY~~H2~ c/ N T 3 , for the Attraction required .
IX .
It is easy to perceive , that if , instead of a Circle , the Curve R~r were an Ellipfis , or any other Curve whose Axes were but very little different from one another , the foregoing Solution would be still the same .
PROBLE M. V. To find the Attraction which Elliptical Spheroid KLk ( Fig. 5 .
) exerts upon a Corpuscle placed without its Surface at N , according to the Direction CX perpendicular to C N. X. To perform this , we will begin by drawing the Diameter C~ ~ , which bisects the Lines Rr perpendicular to C N ; and the Ratio of CH to HY shall be called n. Then esteeming the Ellipsis Rr as a Circle , ( see the foregoing Article ) we shall have by the Problem aforegoing 1/ 2 nc~RH~~C H/ N R~ for its Attraction , according to H Y ; which being multiplied by the Fluxion of M H , the Fluent of this will be the Attraction of the Segment of the Spheroid RM r. This Calculation being made , and Nm being substituted for N R , we shall have 2ncr 5/ 5 e4 for the Attraction of the Spheroid in N , according to the Direction C X. PROBLEM VI .
To find the Attraction of a Corpuscle N , according to C X , towards an Ellipsoid BNE be , composed of Strata , the Densities of which are defined by the Equation D=frp+gr q. XI .
Take the Fluxion of the Quantity 2cnr 5/ 5 e 4 , which expresses the Attraction of the homogeneous Ellipsoid KL K , and you will have 2cnr4 r/ e 4 for the Attraction of an infinitely little elliptic Orb ; which being multiplied by the Density D , gives 2cnfr4+pr +2cgnr4+ q. r/ e 4 , the Fluent of which 2cfnr5+ p/ 5 +p~e 4 .
+2cgnr5+ q/ 5 +q~e 4 , is the Attraction of the Spheroid KL k , according to C X. Therefore the total Attraction of the Spheroid BNEbe upon the Corpuscle N , according to the Direction C X , will be 2cfne1+ p/ 5 +p+2cgne1+ q/ 5 + q. Now if we have regard to the Smallness of the Line N v , and observe how little the Angle vNC will differ from a right one , we may perceive that the Diameter CN contains the same Angle with the perpendicular NX in N , as the Diameter CN with the perpendicular at v ; that is to say , that the Angle NCv is the same as the Angle CNX ; so that instead of n we may take C X/ C N. Wherefore the foregoing Expression of the Attraction of the Ellipsoid BEb e , acting according to the Direction CX upon a Corpuscle placed in N , will be 2cfe1+ p/ 5 +p~C X/ C N+2cge1+ q/ 5 +q~C X/ C N. PROBLEM VII .
To find the Direction of the Attraction of a Corpuscle N towards the Ellipsoid .
XII .
By the second Problem we shall find the Attraction of the Spheroid according to CN to be 2cfe1+ p/ 3 +p+2cge1+ q/ 3 + q , by expunging what may be here expunged .
Then by taking a fourth proportional to these three Quantities , the first of which is the Attraction according to C N , the second is that according to C X , and the third is the right line C N , there will arise fe1+ p/ 5 +p+ge1+ q/ 5 +q fe1+ p/ 3 +p+ge1+ q/ 3 +q ~CX= CI .
Whence we shall have NI for the Direction required , of the Attraction of the Corpuscle N. XIII .
If we suppose p=q= o , that is , if the Spheriod be homogeneous , we shall have CI = 3/ 5 C X ; which agrees with what Mr. Stirling has found , in that curious Dissertation he has published in the Philosophical Transactions , N~ 438 .
PART II .
The Use of the foregoing Problems , in find~ ing the Figure of Spheroids , which revolve about an Axis .
XIV .
, Let us now suppose , that the foregoing Spheroid BNEb e , ( Fig. 5 .
) which is still composed of Beds or Strata of different Densities , revolves about its Axis B b , and that it is now arrived at its permanent State .
It is plain that the Particles of the Fluid , which are upon its Surface , must gravitate according to a Direction perpendicular to the Curvature BN E ; for without this Condition there could be no AE quilibrium .
We shall now inquire , whether the Elliptic Figure we have ascribed to our Spheroids can have this Property , and to produce this Effect , what must be the Relation between the Time of Revolution of the Spheroid and the Difference of its Axes .
Let us then put ~ for the centrifugal Force at the Equator , and the centrifugal Force at N will be ~~P N/ C E , or ~~C x/ 2 CE ~ ~ , because 2PN~~=C x. By resolving this centrifugal Force according to the Perpendicular to C N , we shall have ~~C X/ 2 ~~C E ; which being added to 2cfe1+ p/ 5 +p~C X/ C N+2cge1+ q/ 5 +q~C X/ C N , found by Prob. V. will give the whole Force of the Body N , according to the Direction C X , when the Spheroid is converted about its Axis .
But because this Body , by virtue of the Attraction according to C N , and the Force according to C X , ought to have a perpendicular Tendency to the Superficies ; we shall shall have this Analogy , C N. C X : : 2cfe1+ p/ 3 +p +2cge1+ q/ 3 + q. 2~~C X/ C E+2cfe1+ p/ 5 +p~C X/ C N+2cge1+ q/ 5 +q ~C X/ C N. And hence , because CN and CE may be assumed as the same on this Occasion , it will be ~=8cfe1+p ~/ 3 +p~5+p+8cge1+q ~/ 3 +q~5+ q. And as in this Value of the centrifugal Force , no Quantity enters but what will agree to any Point N~ ; we may therefore conclude , that when our supposed elliptical Spheroid performs its Rotation in a proper Time , so that the centrifugal Force at the Equator may be as before ; then the centrifugal Force in any other Place N will be such as it ought to be , to cause Bodies to gravitate in a perpendicular Direction to the Surface .
The Spheroid being supposed elliptical , Bodies will gravitate perpendicularly to its Surface .
XV .
If we now consider , that ED ( Fig. 6 .
) being taken for the centrifugal Force in E , then will MN express the centrifugal Force in N , and consequently MI will be such a Part of this Force as acts according to N C ; we shall have 8cfe1+P ~/ 3 +px5+p+8cge1+q ~/ 3 +qx5+q to be subtracted from the Attraction at N. Hence 2cfe1+ P/ 3 +p +2p 10 cf~c1+ p/ 3 +px5+p+8cf~e1+ p/ 3 +px5+p+2cge1+ q/ 3 +q + 2q 10 cg~e1+ q/ 3 +qx5+q+8cg~e1+ q/ 8 +qx5+q will be the Gravity at N. The Expression for the Gravity at any Place on the Spheroid .
XVI .
In this Value making ~= ~ , we shall have 2cfe1+ p/ 3 +p+ 2p 2cf~e1+ p/ 3 +px5+p+2cge1+ q/ 3 +q +2q2cg~e1+ q/ 3 +qx5+q for the Gravity at the Equator .
The Gravity at the Equator .
XVII .
If we subtract the Value of the Gravity in N from the Value of the Attraction or Gravity at the Pole , ( Art .
III .
) we shall have 10 2pcf~e1+ p/ 3 +px5+p + 10 2qcg~e1+ q/ 3 +qx5+ q. But it is easy to perceive , that ~ is proportional to the Square of the Sine of the Arc P M , or of the Complement of the Latitude .
Whence we may therefore conclude , that the Diminution nution of the Gravity from the Pole to the Equator is proportional to the Square of the Cosine of the Latitude ; or , which is the same thing , that the Augmentation of Gravity from the Equator to the Pole is as the Square of the Sine of the Latitude , as Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated in his Hypothesis of a homogeneous Spheroid .
XVIII .
From the following Calculation it is easy to conclude , that Sir Isaac 's Theorem , ( Prin .
Math. L. III .
Prop. XX .
) which is this , that the Gravity in any Place within is reciprocally as the Distance from the Centre , cannot obtain here .
For we may see by the foregoing Expression , that the Gravity in N cannot be to the Gravity in P as 1 to 1+ ~ , except when p=q=o , which happens only in Sir Isaac 's homogeneous Spheroid .
It was for want of considering , that this Theorem was demonstrated by Sir Isaac only in the Case of his homogeneous Spheroid , that several Geometricians have too hastily concluded , this Theorem might be applied to determine the Ratio of the Earth 's Axes , and the Lengths of the Pendulum observed in two Places of different Latitudes .
Dr. Gregory is one of those who have fallen into this Mistake , in his Elements of Astronomy , Lib. III .
Sect. 8 .
Prop. 52 .
And in the Philosophical Transactions , N~ 432 .
it is concluded , from the Proportion of Gravity at Jamaica to that at London , that the Diameter of the Equator must exceed the Earth 's Axis by 1/ 190th Part , which Computation was founded on this 20th Proposition , Lib. III .
of Sir Isaac 's Principia , which is true only of his Spheroid .
XIX .
Let us now suppose , that the centrifugal Force at the Equator is known by Observation , as also within the Earth , &amp;c. and that it is a certain Part 1/ m of the Gravity ; by Articles XIV .
and XVI .
we shall have this Equation : 2cfe1+ p/ 3 +p+2~2cfe1+p ~/ 3 +px5+p+2cge1+ q/ 3 +q +2q2cge1+q ~/ 3 +qx5+qx+q=8cfme1+q ~/ 3 +px5+p+8cmge1+q ~/ 3 +qx5+ q. From hence it will be easy to derive the Value of ~ , because f , g , p , q , will be given , from the Hypothesis that will be chosen , for the Variation of the Density in the internal Parts of the Spheroid .
The Manner of finding the Axes of the Spheroid , the Variation of the Densities of the Strata being taken at pleasure .
XX .
And if on the contrary ~ be given , that is , if we know by Observation the Ratio of the Axes of the Planet concerned ; then by the foregoing Equation we may perceive , whether we have assumed an agreeable Hypothesis for the Variation of the Densities : But we cannot precisely determine what this Hypothesis must be , because there is but one Equation , in which four indeterminate Quantities f , g , p , q , are involved .
And indeed there might be many more than four indeterminate Quantities , if we should assume more than two Terms in the general Equation of the Densities D=s rp +g rq +h rs , &amp;c. XXI .
In order to apply the foregoing Theory to the Earth , it might seem at first Sight , that by the Assistance of Observations made for measuring the Length of the Pendulum , we might have other Equations , which with the foregoing Equation A , would determine the Coefficients &amp; Exponents now mentioned ; but we shall soon see the Impossibility of this upon two Accounts : First , There need be only two Observations , as to what concerns the Length of the Pendulum .
For because by Art .
XVII .
the Augmentation of the Gravity from the Equator to the Pole is proportional to the Square of the Sine of the Latitude , two Observations as much determine the Problem as an infinite Number can do : So that we could have but one other Equation besides the foregoing .
This Equation will be ( B ) p-p/ p = 5-p f ~/ 3+p x 5+p + 5-q g ~/ 3+q x 5+q/ p-1 f ~/ 3+p x 5+p + f/ 3+p + g/ 3+q + q-1 g ~/ 3+q x 5+q The first Member of this Equation expresses the Gravity at the Equator subtracted from the Gravity at the Pole , and divided by the Gravity at the Equator ; a Quantity which may be known in Numbers , by determining the Length of the Pendulum at two different Latitudes .
The other Member of the Equation is an Expression of the same Quantity , as it is deduced by the preceding Calculus .
Secondly , This new Equation B cannot be of any Service in determining the Coefficients and Exponents f , g , p , q , &amp;c. For we shall now show , that the foregoing Ratio p p/ p has such an immediate Connexion with ~ , that one of them being determined , the other will necessarily be so too , independently of the Values of f , g , p , q , &amp;c. This may deserve our Attention , and the Proof is thus : XXII .
Because the Ratio of the Gravity to the Centrifugal Force is very great , and is expressed by m , in the Equation A we may reject the third and fourth Terms ; by which means the Equation will be reduced to this , f/ 3 +p+ g/ 3 +q=4mf ~/ 3 +px5+p+4mg ~/ 3 +qx5+q And if from this Equation we deduce the Value either of f or g , and substitute it in the Equation B ; ( having first rejected the first and fourth Terms of the Denominator , as in this Case may be done ) we shall have after the Calculation is made , whatever is the Number of Terms in the Equation of the Densities , p p/ p = 10/ 4 m ~ , or p p/ p = 1/ 115 ~ , by putting 288 for m , as has been long known .
It is easily seen from this Equation , that when ~ is determined , p p/ p will be so too , which was the thing proposed to be proved .
The Figure of the Spheroid being known , the Augmentation of Gravity from the Equator to the Pole will be known also ; and so vice versa .
XXIII .
But from this Equation there follows a very singular Proposition , and which , in some sort , is contrary to the Sentiments of Sir Isaac Newton , Page 430 .
of the 3d Edition of his Principles .
And this is , that if by Observation it shall be discovered , that the Earth is flatter than according to the Spheroid of Sir Isaac , that is , if the Diameter of the Equator exceeds the Axis by more than the 1/ 230 Part , the Gravity will increase less from the Equator towards the Pole , than according to the Table which he has given for his Spheroid ; Prop. XX .
of the 3d Book .
And on the contrary , if the Spheroid is not so flat , the Gravity will increase more from the Equator towards the Pole .
XXIV .
It is thus that Sir Isaac Newton expresses himself about it , when he relates the Experiments made towards the South , concerning the Diminution of Gravity , which Experiments make it greater than his Theory requires .
He affirms , that the Earth is denser towards the Centre than at the Superficies , and more depressed than his Spheroid requires .
But by the foregoing Theory we may easily perceive , that if the Density of the Earth diminishes from the Centre towards the Superficies , the Diminution of Gravity from the Pole towards the Equator will be greater than according to Sir Isaac 's Table ; but at the same time the Earth will be not so much depressed as his Spheroid requires , instead of being more so , as he affirms .
Yet I would not by any means be understood to decide against Sir Isaac 's Determination , because I cannot be assured of his Meaning , when he tells us , that the Density of the Earth diminishes from the Centre towards the Circumference .
He does not explain this , and perhaps instead of the Earth 's being composed of parallel Beds or Strata , its Parts may be Et excessus longitudinis Penduli Parisiensis supra longitudines Pendulorum isochronorum in his latitudinibus observatas , sunt paulo majores quam pro Tabula longitudinum Penduli superius computata .
Et propterea Terra aliquanto altior est sub aequatore , quam pro superiore calculo , &amp; densior ad centrum quam in fodinis prope supersiciem .
conceived to be otherwise arranged and disposed , so as that the Proposition of Sir Isaac shall be agreeable to the Truth .
XXV .
As to Dr. Gregory , who has attempted to comment upon this Passage of Sir Isaac , I think I have demonstrated , that he has committed a Paralogism .
He says ( Element .
Astronom .
Lib. III .
~ .
VIII .
Prop. LII .
Schol .
) that if the Earth is denser towards the Centre , or if ( for Example ) it has a Nucleus of greater Weight than the other Parts , the Diminution of Gravity from the Pole towards the Equator shall be greater than if the whole were of the same Density ; and in this he is right .
But he is in the wrong ( I think ) immediately to conclude from thence , that the Earth has a greater Flatness .
Whence can he conclude this : It can be only from that Proposition of Sir Isaac which informs us , that Gravity is in a reciprocal Ratio of the Distances ; because he gave us the Proposition but the Page before , as a Method for determining the Figure of the Earth .
But we are not allow 'd to make use of this Proposition in this Case , because it has been shown , Art .
XVIII .
that it can take Place only on the Supposition of a homogeneous Spheroid .
Therefore , &amp;c. XXVI .
It will not be very difficult , without any Regard had to the foregoing Theory , to find the Ratio of the Axes of a Spheroid , which we may suppose to have a Nucleus at the Centre , of greater Density than the rest of the Planet ; and hence we shall be easily assured of Dr. Gregory 's Mistake .
XXVII .
Setting aside all Attraction of the Parts of Matter , if the Action of Gravity is directed towards a Centre , and is in the reciprocal Ratio of the Squares of the Distances , the Ratio of the Axes of the Spheroid will then be that of 576 to 577 : And the Gravity at the Pole is greater than at the Equator by 1/ 144th Part , or thereabouts .
Which may be a Confirmation of what is here advanced , especially to such as will not be at the Pains of going through the foregoing Calculations .
For we may consider the Spheroid now mentioned , in which Gravity acts in a reciprocal Ratio of the Squares of the Distances , as composed of Matter of such Rarity , in respect of that at the Centre , that the Gravity is produced only by the Attraction of the Centre or Nucleus .
XXVIII .
In the foregoing Calculations , in order to find the Axes of our Spheroids , and to know whether their Figure makes a sensible Approach to that of the conical Ellipsis , we have had Recourse to this Principle , that Gravity ought always to act in a Direction perpendicular to the Surface .
Two Reasons have prevailed with us to make use of this Principle rather than the other , which consists in the Equilibrium of the Columns .
The first is , because the Calculations founded thereon are more simple .
The second is , that considering the State of the actual Solidity of the Earth , it should seem as if this Principle were the more indispensably necessary .
However , because Sir Isaac Newton , and all the other Philosophers , who have treated about the Figure of the Earth , have taken it , as it were , at its first Formation , at which Time they suppose it to have been fluid ; we shall here make the same Supposition , and we shall assume no other Ratio for that of the two Axes , than that of the Spheroid , which results from a Coincidence of these two Principles .
We shall begin by inquiring what is the entire Weight of any Column C N , Fig. 7 .
To do this we must resume the Expression of the Attraction in any Point M of the Column C N ; then multiply it by r+~ r , and by the Density frp+gr q , and afterwards we must find the Fluent .
Thus we shall have cf2e2+2p/ 1+p~3+p + cg2e2+2q/ 1+q~3+q + 2cfge2+p+q/ 2+p+q~3+p + 2cfge2+p+q/ 2+p+q~3+q + 4cf2~e2+2p/ 1+p~3+p~5+p + 4cg2~e2+2q/ 1+q~3+q~5+q + 8cfg~e2+p+q/ 2+p+q~3+p~5+q + 8cfg~e2+p+q/ 2+p+q~3+q~5+q + 4+2pcf2~e2+2p/ 1+p~3+p~5+p + 4+ ~ 2~e2+q/ 3+q~t+q~~+p + 8+4pcgf~e2+p+q/ 2+p+q~3+p~5+p + 8+4qcfg~e2+p+q/ 2+p+q~3+q~5+q for the total Gravity of any Column C N , having Regard only to the Attraction .
XXIX .
If in this Expression we make ~= 0 , we shall have the Gravity of the Column at the Pole .
XXX .
And if we make ~= ~ , we shall have the Aggregate of the Attractions of the Column at the Equator .
XXXI .
Now because the Column CN is in AEquilibrio with the Column C B ; it follows from thence , that if we subtract the Weight of the Column CB from the Aggregate of the Attractions of the Column C N , the Residue must be equal to the Sum of the centrifugal Forces of the Column C N. Now to endue our Spheroids with this Property , we will resume the Expression of the centrifugal Force in E , which we found Art .
XIV .
which will give ( 8cfe1+p~/ 3+p~5+p + 8cge1+p~/ 3+q~5+q)r/ e , for that Part of the centrifugal Force which acts according to C M , in any Place M , by expunging the Terms in which ~~ would be found .
This Value being multiplied by r , and by the Density , will give ( when we have taken the Fluent ) 8cf2e2+2p~/ 2+p~3+p~5+p + 8cfge2+p+q~/ 2+p~3+q~5+q + 8cfge2+p+q~/ 2+q~3+p~5+p + 8cg2e2+2q~/ 2+q~3+q~5+q for the Sum of the centrifugal Forces of the Column C N , still expunging those Terms in which either ~~ or ~~ are found .
Then making this Expression equal to 4+2pcf2e2+2p~/ 1+p~3+p~5+p + 8+4pcfge2+p+q~/ 2+p+q~3+p~5+p + 8+4qcfge2+p+q~/ 2+p+q~3+q~5+q + 4+2qcg2e2+2q~/ 1+q~3+q~5+q , which is the Difference of the Weight of the Column at the Pole C B , from the Sum of the Attractions of the Column C N , we shall have the Equation ppff/ 1+p~2+p~3+p~5+p + 2pqfg/ 2+p+q~3+p~5+p~2+q + 2pqfg/ 2+p+q~3+q~5+q~2+p + qqgg/ 1+q~2+q~3+q~5+q = 0 , where we have put e= 1 , for the greater Simplicity of Calculation .
XXXII .
This Equation informs us , that when out of all the infinite Varieties , which will be supplied by the Equation of the Densities D= frp + grq + hrs , &amp;c. we shall have taken at Pleasure all the Coefficients , and all the Exponents , one only excepted ; if this last is such in respect of the others , that it may fulfil the Conditions of the foregoing Equation , the Spheroid , being supposed in a State of Fluidity , will be in AEquilibrio , because it will unite as well the Principle of a perpendicular Tendency to the Surface , as that of an Equipoise of the several Columns .
Determination of such Spheroids , as make the Principle of the Equilibrium of the Columns , and that of Gravity perpendicular to the Surface , to coincide with each other .
XXXIII .
Before I conclude this Paper , I shall make a few Reflections on the Principles we have now made use of , for determining the Figure of a Spheroid revolving about its Axe .
The first Principle which , after Mr. Huygens , we have had Recourse to , and which consists in making Bodies gravitate perpendicularly to the Surface , seems to me of absolute Necessity .
For if there were never so little Water upon the Surface of the Earth , it could not be at Rest , if it had a Tendency any how inclined to the Surface .
The second Principle , made use of by Sir Isaac Newton , and which consists in an Equilibrium of the Columns C E , C N , C P , could be thought necessary ( I think ) only for these two Reasons : The first is that which is usually assigned , that at the first Formation of the Earth , it was probably in a State of perfect Fluidity ; in which case it must acquire such a Figure , as will result from the Equilibrium of the Columns , and from the Gravitation acting perpendicularly to the Surface .
Indeed though this Reason has a Degree of Plausibility , yet there are many who think it to be of small Force .
Perhaps , say they , the Earth has never been in this fluid Condition .
The second Reason , which I believe will have a greater Weight with every Body , is this .
Considering the Earth as it is at present , and without carrying our Thoughts so far back as to its Formation , if the Ocean , which is now upon its Surface , has any considerable Depth , and if its Parts preserve a Communication with each other , from Region to Region , by subterraneous Canals ; it can only keep an Equilibrium by this Means , because its Superficies is the same as it would have , were the whole a Fluid .
XXXIV .
This second Reason has suggested a Reflexion to my Mind , concerning the Equipoise of the Columns now calculated , Art .
XXXI .
and XXXII .
Let us first suppose , that the Earth is our fluid Spheroid , composed of Beds of different Densities ; and that afterwards this Fluid hardens into a Solid , so that the different Beds or Strata , of which it is made up , are of no other Use but to cause a Gravity by their Attractions .
Then let us suppose , that the Seas and great Waters about the Earth have a Communication with each other , by means of some subterraneous Canals .
As the Waters of the Sea , which unite with one another , are probably homogeneous , the foregoing Calculation , wherein we have considered the Spheroid as a Fluid , can no longer take Place , because we have there supposed , that the Fluid contained in the Canal BCN is of a Density , that varies from the Qq Centre Centre to the Circumference .
From hence it seems to me , we must undertake the Computation of the Equilibrium of the Columns after another Manner , thus : We must examine whether two Canals , as CN and B C , which are filled with a homogeneous Fluid , will be in AEquilibrio , all the other Parts of the Spheroid continuing as above .
XXXV .
To do this , we will begin with finding the Gravity of any Column C N , ( Fig. 7 .
) arising from Attraction alone .
First , then , we must resume the Expression of the Attraction in any Point M , Art .
VII .
Then we must multiply it by r+~ r , which will give 2cfr1+pr/ 3+p + 8+~pcf~r1+pr/ 3+p~5+p + 8cf~r1+pr/ 3+p~5+p + 2cgr1+qr/ 3+q , &amp;c. And taking the Fluent of this Quantity , we shall have 2cfe2+p/ 3+p~2+p + 4cf~e2+p/ 3+p~5+p + 8cf~e2+p/ 2+p~3+p~5+p + 2~ge2+q/ 3+q~2+q , &amp;c. for the Gravity of the whole Column C N. XXXVI .
If in this Value we make ~= 0 , we shall have the Gravity of the Column at the Pole .
XXXVII .
And if we subtract the Gravity of the Column at the Pole from the whole Sum of the Attractions of the Column C N , we shall have 4cf~e2+p/ 3+p~5+p + 4cge2+q~/ 3+q~5+q , which must be equal to the Sum of the centrifugal Forces of the Column C N , in order that the Columns CB and CN may be in AEquilibrio .
But we shall find this really to obtain , if we resume the Quantity ( 8cfe1+p/ 3+p~5+p + 8cge1+q~/ 3+q~5+q)r/ e , which expresses ( Art .
XXXI .
) that Part of the centrifugal Force in M , which acts according to C M. Then multiplying this Expression by r , and seeking the Fluent , we shall have 4cfe2+p~/ 3+p~5+p + 4cge2+q~/ 3+q~5+q for the Aggregate of the centrifugal Forces of the Column C N. And this being the same as the foregoing , shows , that the Columns CB and CN are in AEquilibrio , supposing them to be homogeneous ; nor are we here obliged , as in Art .
XXXII .
where we consider them as heterogeneous , to suppose the Coefficients f , p , &amp;c. to have any certain Relation among one another .
XXXVIII .
Perhaps it may be urged , that the foregoing Calculus agrees only to a Canal , as BC N , which passes through the Centre ; and that we ought to prove , in the same manner , that the Water included in any other Canal pqr would observe an AEquilibrium .
But it appears to me , that this Property may be derived from the former : For it follows from the foregoing Calculation , that if we might be allow 'd to make this Hypothesis , viz. That independently of the Attraction of any Matter , the Gravity at any Distance CN from the Centre , ( see Fig. 7 .
) would be proportional to 2cfe1+p/ 3+p ~ 2p-2cf~e1+p/ 3+p~5+p + 8cf~e1+p/ 3+p~5+p , &amp;c. it is plain from thence , that a Mass of the homoQ q2 geneous geneous Fluid , which should turn about the Axis C B , would assume the same Form as that of our heterogeneous Fluids .
But if this Spheroid should then put on a fixed State , except only some Canal pq r , the Water in this Canal would be in AEquilibrio ; for without this , the Spheroid could not be esteemed as having arrived to its fixed State .
But this Supposition comes to the same as that of our heterogeneous Spheroid , composed of elliptical Beds , in which should be found a Canal pqr of a homogeneous Fluid ; provided that the Space , which this Canal possesses in the Globe , be not of so large an Extent , as to change the Law of Attraction .
It might now be thought seasonable to give Examples , for illustrating the foregoing Theory ; but they are so easy to be produced , after what is already done , that I shall leave them to the inquisitive Reader , having perhaps exceeded the Limits , within which this Discourse should be confined .
Therefore I shall only add the few Observations following .
The only three Planets , in which we can be assured of Gravitation , and the centrifugal Force , are the Sun , Jupiter , and the Earth .
As to the Sun , the centrifugal Force is there so small , in respect of its Gravity , that his Poles must be very little depressed , so that we cannot be sensible of it by Observation .
Then as to Jupiter , Observations make him something less flat than according to Sir Isaac Newton ; that is to say , than if he were composed of Matter of an uniform Density .
Therefore by the foregoing Theory , he must be a little more dense towards the Centre , than at the Parts near the Superficies .
We might make a thousand Hypotheses about the Manner of distributing the Inequality of Density , proceeding from the Centre towards the Circumference , which would all agree with the Figure observed , and which are very easy to calculate by the Principles here laid down .
As to what concerns the Earth , I shall wait till we receive the Observations which must have been lately made in Peru ; that by comparing those with what Observations we have made under the arctick Circle , and with those of Mr. Picart in France , we may have the true Difference of the Earth 's Diameters at the Equator and at the Poles .
Then our Theory may be applied , to determine whether the Earth is more or less dense at the central Parts than at the Surface , or whether it be every-where of an uniform Density , as it ought to be , if ( without admitting very gross Errors in the Observations ) it may be concluded , that the Earth is really the Spheroid of Sir Isaac Newton ; and this Case would be the simplest and the most natural of all .
I am here obliged to acknowledge , that if the Observations we have made in the North may be relied upon , and if we must admit as incontestable as well the Measure of a Degree as the Length of the Pendulum , the foregoing Theory could not be reconciled to the Phenomenon .
For it follows from our Observations , that the Diameter of the Equator must exceed the Earth 's Axis by more than 1/ 230 Part : And that the Gravity at the Pole must be greater than that at the Equator by more than 1/ 230 Part likewise ; which will by no means agree with what we have deduced in Art .
XXIII .
As to what concerns the Measure of Gravity in Lapland , as being not so liable to Error as the measuring suring a Degree ; the Earth may be not quite so flat as Sir Isaac 's Spheroid requires .
By the Table of the Length of the Pendulum , exhibited in the Treatise concerning the Figure of the Earth , published this Year by Mr. de Maupertuis , and by Art .
XXII .
of the present Discourse , the Earth may be more elevated at the Equator than at the Pole by the 1/ 266 Part , or thereabouts .
After the true Quantity of the Earth 's flatness shall be fully settled , if it should be found to have this Figure , I should be apt to think it is a little more dense at the Centre than towards the Superficies .
But if on the contrary we should be well ascertained , that the Earth is raised higher at the Equator than at the Pole , by above the 1/ 230 Part ; and if , for any sufficient Reason , we may something shorten the Length of the Pendulum that beats Seconds in the North ; there would be some grounds to allow , that the Earth is not so dense at the central Regions as at those near the Surface .
But if it shall happen , that we can neither diminish the Length of the Pendulum , nor the Excess of the equatorial Diameter above the Axe ; I must then give up my Hypothesis .
Yet I shall think it may be of some Use to have thus discussed it , because possibly no one would have imagined what might have been the Result of it .
It appears that even Sir Isaac Newton was of Opinion , that it was necessary the Earth should be more dense towards the Centre , in order to be so much the flatter at the Poles : And that it follow 'd from this greater Flatness , that Gravity increased so much the more from the Equator towards the Pole .
