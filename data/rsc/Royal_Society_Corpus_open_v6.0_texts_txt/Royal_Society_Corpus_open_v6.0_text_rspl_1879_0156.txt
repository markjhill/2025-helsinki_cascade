The Cailletet pump may be conveniently employed to observe the thermal effects of compression on solid and fluid substances .
Before engaging in an investigation on this subject , it was necessary to test the apparatus , and especially the manometer .
For this purpose it seemed , on theoretical grounds , that observations on the lowering of the freezing-point of water by pressure would be a severe test of the accuracy of the pressure gauge , and the constancy of the records of the thermo-junctions under pressure .
I am not aware of any quantitative experiments on this subject having been made under high pressures .
Sir William Thomson carried the proof of the accuracy of Professor James Thomson 's great theoretical discovery to a pressure of 17 atmospheres.* The experiments of Mousson ( " Pogg .
Annalen , " 1858 ) were not of a quantitative character , being merely intended to show that ice at a temperature of \#151 ; 18 ' C. might still be liquefied by the application of an enormous pressure .
The following experiments appear to show that a convenient manometer for very high pressures , based on the observation of the freezing-point , may be easily constructed .
In all the following experiments the galvanometer , moving to the negative side , represents a cooling effect on the junction inside the * " The Effect of Pressure in Lowering the Freezing-Point of Water experimen- .

One division on the arbitrary scale represented about of a degree C. Two thermo-junctions , made of iron-copper wires , insulated by a covering of marine glue , the junctions themselves being covered with a thin layer of gutta-percha dissolved in benzol , were employed in the experiments .
One junction was placed in the iron bottle , to record the effect of pressure under different circumstances , the other was kept in a beaker outside at the constant temperature of melting ice .

A junction , fixed in a brass flange with marine glue , was frozen in a test-tube containing boiled water , and placed in the iron bottle of the Cailletet apparatus , surrounded with water at 0 ' C. , the bottle itself being packed round with ice .
The pressure was increased by 25 atmospheres at a time .
The galvanometer showed a deflection immediately after the pressure was applied , rapidly coming to rest , and it remained perfectly steady at the lower temperature as long as the pressure was maintained constant .
The following table gives the results of one of many series of experiments , which agreed very nearly .

The mean reduction for one atmosphere of pressure is 0o-0072 .
These experiments were afterwards repeated , with a stronger pump , to 700 atmospheres .
Exactly the same mean deflection was observed , and the galvanometer moved with the same regularity .
Series The junction in the flange was placed in a piece of quill tubing , open at top and bottom , in order to insulate it from the sides of the iron bottle , and surrounded with water at 0 ' C. instead of ice , the iron bottle being afterwards packed , as before , in ice .
On applying pressure a very slight decrease of temperature occurred , the whole deflection for 200 atmospheres being only about 4 divisions , or 7s a degree C. This agrees with Joule's* experiments on the compression of water about the same temperature .
Series A mixture of finely powdered ice and water was placed round the junction inside the bottle , which was , as usual , packed afterwards in ice .
It will be seen , from the following set of readings , that the deflection was about the same as when the junction was frozen into a block of ice , the only difference being that , whereas the galvanometer in the first series assumed its new position immediately after the pressure was applied , the instrument now required from two to three minutes before coming finally to rest , the action being far more sluggish .

These experiments ' were made with the junction frozen into a test-tube as in Series I , with mercury surrounding the test-tube instead of water .

Series VII .
As in several cases the junction that was placed inside the bottle , and which had been several times subjected to high pressures , appeared to be affected by the compression and worked somewhat irregularly , it was thought advisable to subject both the junctions to the same compression , so as to have them both under the same conditions .
For this purpose both junctions were passed through the brass flange ( fig. 1 ) , being well insulated by marine glue , the one remaining outside of the test-tube in which the other was frozen .
Fig. 1 .
The results with ice were exactly the same as when one junction was placed outside of the bottle .
Pressure still appeared to have an effect upon the junctions , as after one or two series of compression experiments they could be no longer relied upon , and worked very irregularly .
The only way to obviate this difficulty was to prevent the junctions being submitted to pressure at all , and this was effected by soldering a stout iron tube ( fig. 2 ) , about | inch internal diameter , into the brass flange , which reached to about the centre of the bottle .
The tube was closed at the bottom and contained a few cubic centimetres of alcohol , into which the junction was lowered from the outside .
The part of the tube which went into the bottle was then frozen into a mass of ice , and the iron tube sustained all the interior pressure .
The alteration of temperature was conveyed slowly through the iron to the junction .

[ June 17\gt ; This method worked exceedingly well , giving exactly the same results as before , the only drawback being that the action was very sluggish , the galvanometer taking about two minutes to come to rest after each addition of pressure .
The above results seem to prove that the calculated value of the variation of the freezing-point of water , deduced from the observed difference of volume of ice and water , and the latent heat of fluidity at the melting-point under one atmosphere of pressure , is identical with the mean experimental value obtained from a series of observations extending to 700 atmospheres .
From Clapeyron 's formula we are thus entitled to infer that \#151 ; \#151 ; =constant , where T is absolute temperature , V the difference of volume of the two states , and L the latent heat of fluidity .
If V is assumed to be approximately constant , then T varies as L. Thus the latent heat of ice diminishes as the freezing-point is lowered by pressure .
This is in accordance with the deductions of Clausius* from other considerations .

The following experiments regarding the behaviour of carbonic acid in presence of different vapours above the temperature of the critical point of the pure gas , were undertaken to ascertain if any optical discontinuity could be observed in such mixtures .
As the object was intentionally a qualitative investigation , many of the pressure observations have been taken with the metallic manometer .

Carbonic acid liquefied in presence of a small quantity of bisulphide of carbon at a pressure of 49 atmospheres and a temperature of 19 ' C. It floated on the convex surface of the bisulphide , the line of separation being sharp and well defined .
At 35 ' C. liquid condensed on the surface of the bisulphide in the same way at a pressure of 78 atmospheres , at 40 ' C. it still appeared at 85 atmospheres , at 55 ' C. there seemed to be a distinct appearance of two liquids , and at 58 ' C. there was still the same apparent separation under a pressure of 110 atmospheres .
