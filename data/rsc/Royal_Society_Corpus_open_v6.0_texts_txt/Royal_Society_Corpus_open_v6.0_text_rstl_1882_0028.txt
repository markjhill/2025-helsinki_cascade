In a series of papers printed in the Proceedings of the Boyal Society for the years 1877 , 1879 , 1881 , Mr. G. F. Bodwell has investigated the expansion and contraction by heat of the silver iodide , Agl ; of certain chlorobromiodides of silver ; and of certain alloys of silver iodide , with lead iodide , and copper iodide .
Analogous researches were made by us on the substances HgI2.2AgI ; HgI2.3AgI ; HgIa .
Cu2I2 ; * which , when heated to a certain temperature , change their colour .
HgI2.2AgI and HgT2.3AgI , at about 50 ' C. , change from canary-yellow to red , and HgI2.Cu2I2 , at about 70 ' C. , changes from red to a chocolate colour .
For temperatures below and beyond the colour-change the co-efficient of expansion and the specific heat are regular , but during a range of a certain number of degrees of heat in which colour-change and corresponding modification of structure take place , the substances undergo a very notable expansion and absorb a great quantity of heat .
It seemed to Mr. Bodwell , and to us , that it would be interesting to make a calorimetric study of those substances whose expansion and contraction he had determined , and Mr. Bodwell having kindly furnished us with the specimens which he employed in his researches , we have briefly described in this paper the method and results of our calorimetric determinations .
During the operation of heating , the substance was contained in a vertical double cylinder of brass , 3 centims. in diameter and about 12 centims. long ( fig. 1 , p. 1176 ) .
The substance to be examined , made into small rods , was arranged round the reservoir of a thermometer , whose stem passed through a cork which closed the upper end of the brass cylinder .
At the lower end this cylinder was closed by two small double doors which could be opened by a spring , and thus allowed the substance to fall out .

7 k 2 brass cylinder was introduced into another very long brass cylinder , heated externally and at the lower end by water or paraffine , and closed by a cork .
The stem of the thermometer , passing through this cork , supported at a convenient height the inner cylinder .
This manner of heating the substance is , indeed , somewhat slow ; but we adopted it because it is very easy to maintain the temperature constant for a long time , and because it allowed us to carry the substance , protected by the cylinder , from the heating apparatus to the calorimeter , in which it was allowed to fall , without any appreciable loss of heat .
We used a Geissler 's thermometer graduated to C. ; but the temperatures were referred to the air-thermometer after having accurately compared our Geissler 's thermometer with a Jolly 's air-thermometer .
The calorimeter ( fig. 2 ) was a copper cylinder containing about 125 grms. of water , furnished with a movable cover , and was contained in a tin cylinder surrounded by water .
For stirring the water a horizontal frame of copper wire covered by a brass net was moved up and down by a handle .
The substance fell upon this net , and was moved in the water with the stirrer .
The thermometer in the calorimeter was graduated to j^ ' C. , and was accurately compared with a standard thermometer .
The thermal capacity of the calorimeter , stirrer , and thermometer was 2*660 grms. Calorimetric experiments and calculations were made according to Regnault 's method , improved by Wullner.^ In order to diminish corrections the temperature of the water in the calorimeter was initially cooled below the outer temperature .
We have not described the physical properties of the bodies we have studied , because Mr. Rod well has done so in his papers .
We have only given the temperature range of the contraction and expansion by heat of each substance , derived from Mr. Rod-well 's private communications , and afterwards the results of our calorimetrical experiments .

The calorimetric results are given in the following table , in which Q denotes the number of calories given out by unit weight of the substance in cooling from T to t ' G. The rate of change of the specific heat of water for temperature is no doubt small , but still uncertain , and therefore we did not introduce any correction for it ; but we give in the table the initial water temperature r , so that the eventual correction is always possible .

Some experiments were also made with Cu3I2 , but this substance , when heated , emits iodine vapour , and is therefore slowly decomposed .
Its surface was covered by some oxide .

I. The specific heat of the bodies we experimented on , below the point at which a change of structure commences , increases with the temperature .
HEAT AND HEAT OP TRANSFORMATION OF IODIDE OF SILVER .
1175 II .
This specific heat for the alloys of silver- and ; copper-iodide diminishes when .the percentage of silver-iodide increases , but if we calculate the specific heat of the alloys from the specific heats and the proportion of components , we approach only roughly to the true values .
It seems that the coefficient of T generally increases with the percentage of Agl .
The coefficient 0*000028 , for Cu2I2.3AgI , appears to be less than that for Ou2I2 .
2A.GT , but , perhaps , that is due to some uncertainty in the experiments , notably Nos. 25 and 26 .
The coefficient for Ou2I2 .
12_A_gI was not determined , owing to the low temperature of change of this substance .
III .
The value of the heat of change , Xfor Pbl2 .
Agl is less , and for the alloys of silver- and copper-iodide is greater than for pure iodide of silver .
This singular result leads to the assumption that some or all of the alloys of copper- and silver-iodide are real chemical or molecular compounds .
Starting from the values of for Agl and for and calculating the values of X for the other alloys , considered as mixtures of Agl and Cuglg .
Agl , we find the numbers 7*99 , 7*62 , 7*38 , 6*72 respectively for Ck^^^Agl , Cu2I2.3AgI , Cu2I2.4AgI , Cu2I2.12AgI .
These numbers differ from those given above , but making allowance for errors of observation , for want of the values of c1 respecting Cu2I2.AgI and Cu2I2.2AgI , and for the uncertainty of the temperature for which X is computed , it is perhaps probable that at least Cu2I2.2AgI and Cu2I2.3AgI might be considered as mixtures of Agl and Cu2I2.AgI .
The uncertainty in the temperature of change is chiefly influential in Cu2I2.4AgI and Cu2I2.12AgI , for which bodies the interval of temperature between the commencement and end of the change of structure exceeds 100 ' C. Moreover , for these substances cx is small , and the coefficient of T-\-t in the value of c has not been determined for Cu2I2.12AgI , and is somewhat uncertain for Cu2I2.4AgI , owing to discrepancy in the experiments Nos. 16 and 17 .
For these reasons the values of X deduced from observation for those two substances do not pretend to great accuracy .
IV .
The values of c1 increase with the percentage of Cu2I2 ; and in the case of Agl and those alloys of Agl and Cu2I2 for which cx was determined , the values of cx are smaller than the values of c computed for corresponding temperatures .
The difference between cx and c , extended beyond the temperature of change , diminishes as the percentage of Cu2I2 increases .
It is therefore probable that cx does not much differ from c in Cu2I2.2AgI and Cu2I2.AgI , for which the values of A. are computed on this assumption .
V. For PbI2.AgI the value of c1 is greater than the value of c for corresponding temperatures .
Perhaps other conclusions may be derived by comparing our calorimetric results with those of thermic expansion and contraction obtained by Mr. Rodwell ; but mdccclxxxii .
7 h Mr. Rodwell 's last paper had not been published in , when the present paper was written .
Before concluding , we beg to express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Rodwell , who kindly sent us the substances he had studied , and to Professor Fr. Rossetti , Director of the Physical Institute of Padua , who afforded us every facility for the execution of our experiments .
