] About the middle of the year 1910 , whilst examining our laboratory strain of Trypanosoma equiperdum , short parasites , certain of which exhibited a posterior displacement of the nucleus , were observed .
This strain had been preserved at the Euncorn Laboratory by passage through experimental animals since 1907 , when it was obtained from the Kaiserliches Gesund-heitsamt , Berlin .
As these posterior nuclear forms had not been described in T. equiperdum we asked Prof. Schilling for further animals infected with this strain which had been preserved by him .
Examination of the parasites in these animals likewise revealed the presence of the posterior nuclear forms .
Having satisfied ourselves that these forms are a constant feature of the strain , we published a short preliminary note* drawing attention to this fact .
As previously T. equiperdum had always been described as a monomorphic parasite invariably furnished with a free flagellum , we decided to examine for ourselves various strains of this parasite preserved at the present time in the European laboratories .
We were enabled to collect the following three strains of the trypanosome .
Strain A.\#151 ; Berlin strain .
This is our old laboratory strain .
Prof. Schuberg informs us that this was the trypanosome used by Uhlenhuth , Hiibener , and Woithef in their experimental work on Dourine in 1908 .
These authors state that the virus was obtained from a horse suffering from Dourine brought over to Germany from Algiei 's for experimental purposes by the firm of Hagenbeck .
The work of Salvin Moore and Breinl , | and others , on T. equiperdum , was done with this strain .
Strain B.\#151 ; Frankfurt strain .
This strain was obtained in 1906 from Prof. Ehrlich .

Prof. Ehrlich informs us that there is no doubt that he obtained it from a trustworthy source .
StrainC.\#151 ; East Prussian strain .
This strain was supplied to us by the veterinary department of the Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt .
It is the virus responsible for the East Prussian outbreak of Beschalseuche in horses in 1905 .
We have made a careful study of the morphology of each of these three strains .
Eor the sake of comparison the infection in rats and guinea-pigs has been observed in each case .
On examining the blood of infected guinea-pigs we were at once impressed by the large number of short , aflagellar forms occurring in Strain A as compared with B and C. To give mathematical expression to this statement 20,000 individuals of each strain were examined regarding the presence or absence of a free flagellum .
The examinations were conducted by observing from 200 to 1000 individuals on different days of the infection in both rats and guinea-pigs .
A glance at Table I will show that the impression\#151 ; that Strain A is different from Strains B and C\#151 ; conveyed by casual examination of blood films of guinea-pigs infected with each of these strains is correct , for whereas of the 20,000 individuals observed in each strain , 1321 aflagellar and spicule* forms were encountered in Strain A , only 18 and 86 similar forms were seen in Table I.\#151 ; Showing the Number of Parasites of Various Types encountered in 20,000 of each of the Three Strains .

The Trypanosomes causing Dourine .
Strains B and C respectively .
It is to be observed that this distinction between the strains is much more clearly brought out by an examination of guinea-pigs than of rats .
Applying the present method of classification , this morphological distinction is at once sufficient to differentiate Strain A from the others .
If we adopt Laveran 's recent scheme for the classification of pathogenic trypanosomes , Strain A belongs to G-roup 3 ( in which certain individuals have a free flagellum , whilst others have not ) , whereas Strains B and C must be classed amongst the trypanosomes forming Group 1 ( those in which all the individuals have a free flagellum ) .
Moreover , there is a further morphological peculiarity by which Strain A is differentiated from Strains B and C. As is described in our previous paper ( loc. cit. ) , certain of the short forms of the former strain exhibit a posterior nucleus .
The phenomenon , so far as we have been able to ascertain , is limited to this strain and does not occur in either of the other two .
Having satisfied ourselves that Strain A was morphologically distinct from Strains B and C , we examined more minutely the morphology of the two latter strains with a view to ascertaining whether these are different one from the other or whether they are identical .
Attention has already been called to the fact that in both the strains long free flagellated forms constitute the vast majority of the parasites encountered .
There is , however , a point to which we must refer .
In the East Prussian strain the cytoplasm is continued in many individuals a considerable distance along the flagellum , so that even the longest forms encountered have frequently a comparatively short portion of flagellum free .
Most of the aflagellar or spicule forms in this strain are not " short stumpy " forms properly speaking , but medium or even long forms in which the cytoplasm is carried along the flagellum .
A few short forms , concerning certain of which some doubt existed as to whether or not there was a free flagellum , spicule forms , were met with in both strains B and C. These , however , may be neglected , as at least an equal number of short forms with a questionable free flagellum is seen in T. evansi , which is recognised as the type of the trypanosomes constituting Group 1 in Laveran 's classification .
In Table II are given the dimensions of the trypanosomes of each of the three strains in rats and guinea-pigs .
But little assistance in the differentiation of the strains is to be obtained from these figures .
It is to be noted that in each case the average dimensions of the parasites in the rat are greater than those of the same strain in guinea-pigs .
This difference , which is but slight in Strains B and C , is more marked in the case of Strain A. H 2 Drs. B. Blacklock and W. York .

It will be observed that in the case of rats the curves of each of the strains correspond fairly closely .
They are those of monomorphic trypanosomes , the main peak in Strains A and C being at 27 , whilst in Strain B it is found at 2,9/ jl .
A striking difference , however , is to be observed in the graphs compiled from the measurement of the parasites in guinea-pigs , for whereas in MICRONS G'PIGS COMBINED ' STRAIN *X ' The Trypanosomes causing Dourine .

Strains B and C the curves are again those of monomorphic trypanosomes and correspond closely to those obtained from the rats , in Strain A the curve has two widely separated main peaks , one occurring at 17-19/ 4 and the other at 25-27/ 4 , and is typically that of a dimorphic parasite .
Apart then from the slightly greater average length of Strain B and the prolongation of the cytoplasm along the flagellum in Strain C noted above , we have been unable to discover any character which enables us to distinguish these two strains .
Both , however , are differentiated from Strain A by the presence in the latter of posterior nuclear forms and by the occurrence of typical " short stumpy " forms .
These distinctive points are more readily brought out by a study of the infections in guinea-pigs than in rats .

In order to determine this point it is necessary to refer to the literature of the subject .
In 1896 , Kouget* described a trypanosome in the blood of an Algerian horse which was suffering from Dourine .
Kouget succeeded in infecting a number of laboratory animals with the parasite , but , unfortunately , the strain was lost shortly afterwards .
Three years later ( 1899 ) Schneider and * ' Contribution a l'Etude du Trypanosome des Mammif\amp ; res , " * Annals de l'Institut Pasteur , ' 1896 , vol. 10 , p. 716 .
The Trypanosomes ; Buffard* found a trypanosome in two Algerian horses and an ass which had Dourine .
They succeeded in reproducing Dourine in a horse experimentally after passage of the virus through a dog .
This work was subsequently confirmed by Nocard.f Doflein , J in his book on the parasitic protozoa , 1901 , refers briefly to Rouget 's description of the disease and to the morphology and pathogenicity of the parasite .
The photographs illustrating Doflein 's article are apparently reproductions of Rouget 's original plates .
Reference is made to Nocard 's work on the transmission of the disease by coitus , and also to the fact that he believed the parasite to be identical with those causing Nagana and Surra .
Since , however , the disease was spread by coitus and the trypanosome failed to infect ruminants , Doflein considered that the parasite described by Rouget was distinct from those causing Nagana and Surra and gave to it the name T. equiperdum .
It appears , therefore , that five years after the strain was lost Doflein named the parasite purely on the description of the trypanosome given by Rouget .
Rouget 's account of the morphology of the parasite must then be regarded as the authentic description of T. equiperdum .
Unfortunately , in Rouget 's original paper ( cit. ) the account of the morphology of the trypanosome is rather vague .
Its length is given as 18-26/ * and its breadth as 2-2'5/ x. The parasite is described as terminating in a free flagellum which forms about a fourth of the total length of the creature .
All subsequent authors agree that T. equiperdum is a monomorphic parasite in which all forms are furnished with a free flagellum .
The Frankfurt and the East Prussian strains conform to this description .
The strain brought from Algiers by Hagenbeck and maintained at Berlin and here , under the name T. equiperdum , differs in important particulars from the classical description of T. equiperdum , and from the other strains we have examined .
We must conclude , therefore , that the symptom-complex of the disease clinically known as Dourine can be produced by more than one species of trypanosome .
It is important to record that we are unable to distinguish morphologically the parasite of Hagenbeck 's Dourine horse from T. rhodesiense , T. pecaudi , or T. ugandce( T.brucei of Uganda ) .
Nevertheless , we hesitate to suggest that it is identical with any , or all , of these , in view of the fact that it produced in a horse symptoms clinically known as Dourine .

Studies in the indistinguishable morphologically from T. should be disseminated amongst horses by coitus is of considerable interest .
We are at present conducting experiments with a view to ascertaining whether these three strains , all of them obtained from horses suffering from " mal de coit , are still capable , after numerous passages through laboratory animals extending over many years , of being transmitted in equines by coitus .
For the present , we propose for this rhodesiense-like trypanosome the name equi .

The calorimeter with which the included data have been obtained was built upon the plan described by Benedict , * omitting , however , such parts as were essential rather to a study of the respiratory gases than to measurements of heat-production .
The general principles of its construction are well known , exceedingly ingenious , were developed by Atwater and Benedict , and are briefly as follows : The body of the calorimeter is of sheet copper built upon an external wooden framework , on which again is built externally an outer zinc box enclosing , but nowhere in contact with , the calorimeter box proper .
Between the two metal boxes , sets of thermocouples arranged in groups are utilised to discover any differences of temperature likely to lead to a radiation of heat from one box to the other across the intervening air space partially occupied by the wooden framework .
