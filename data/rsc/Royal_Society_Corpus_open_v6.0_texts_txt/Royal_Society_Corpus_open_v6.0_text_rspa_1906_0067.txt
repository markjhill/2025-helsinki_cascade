157 A MetJiod for Determining Velocities of Saponification .

) A possible method of following the progress of a reaction in which electrolytes are involved is to measure the electrical conductivity of the solution at stated intervals .
This method was employed by Walker and Kay* in their investigation of the conversion of ammonium cyanate into urea , and is capable of a more extended application .
The chief conditions for the convenient application of the method are : first , that there should be a considerable difference in conductivity between the initial and final systems , and second , that the change in conductivity should be proportional to the progress of the reaction .
It occurred to me that these conditions would be well fulfilled in the saponification of an ester by a caustic alkali .
The conductivity of the alkali , say sodium hydroxide , is much greater than that of the sodium salt produced by the saponification , owing to the high velocity of hydroxidion as compared with the salt anion .
Since , too , sodium hydroxide and sodium salts of monobasic acids are approximately equally ionised under the same conditions , the ionisation in dilute solution remains practically the same throughout the saponification , and thus the alteration in the conductivity is almost exactly proportional to the progress of the reaction .
The following experiment on the rate of saponification of methyl acetate by caustic soda may be quoted as an example of the method carried out under ordinary laboratory conditions with the apparatus generally used for conductivity measurements in solution .
The conductivity cell used was of the narrow Arrhenius type , and was immersed in a thermostat at 25 ' .
In this cell were placed 4 c.c. of N/ 20 caustic soda , and 15 c.c. of water .
To prevent access of carbon dioxide , the hole in the ebonite cover was plugged with a small rubber stopper .
When the temperature of the thermostat had been reached , the solution was stirred by raising and lowering the electrodes , and the conductivity was read off .
To the solution was then added 1 c.c. of N/ 5 solution of methyl acetate , the time being simultaneously noted , and the contents of the cell were well stirred by up-and-down motion of the electrodes .
A reading of the conductivity was * ' Journ. Chem. Soc. , ' vol. 71 , p. 489 , 1897 .

A Method for [ July 10 , at once taken after mixing , but this acted merely as a check , and was not used in the calculation .
After a short interval readings were made of the conductivity of the solution ( which was now N/ lOO , both with regard to sodium hydroxide and to methyl acetate ) , at first every minute , and then every few minutes , when the reaction had become slower .
The following table contains the results of the observations .

It is , however , advisable to neglect the first and last fourths of the reaction , since in them initial disturbances and the effect of a slight departure from exact equivalence of the reacting substances have a relatively large effect on the value of the constant .
The initial reading of the conductivity cannot be taken directly , owing to the great speed of the reaction .
In order to obtain it , the conductivity of the alkaline solution is read before the methyl acetate is added .
In the above instance the conductivity read in this way is that of a solution N/ 95 with regard to sodium hydroxide , 4 c.c. of N/ 20 solution being contained in 19 c.c. When this is diluted to IST/ 100 by the addition of 1 c.c. of the methyl acetate solution , the conductivity will fall off in the ratio of 100 to 95 , since the quantity of methyl acetate in the solution after mixing is less than 0'1 per cent. , and can have no appreciable effect either on the speed or the number of the ions .

methyl acetate we therefore deduct one-twentieth of its value in order to obtain the initial conductivity after mixing .
The final reading may of course be ascertained by waiting till the action has ceased , but it is both more expeditious and more accurate to measure the conductivity of a IN'/ 100 solution of sodium acetate prepared by neutralising the N/ 20 solution of caustic soda by means of acetic acid and diluting to the requisite extent .
It is well to make this measurement of the end-point before beginning the actual saponification .
Theoretically the end-point can be calculated from the initial reading and the known ratio of the conductivities of N/ 100 solutions of sodium hydroxide and sodium acetate , but it is advisable to perform the experiment as a check .
1 oc The calculation of the constant - .
---t 1\#151 ; x may be much simplified by the following device .
For conductivity work a table is used which gives the ratio a/ ( l \#151 ; a ) for different values of the bridge-reading a. If therefore , we make the total range of the reaction equal to unity , we can use the same table to obtain the ratio x/ ( l\#151 ; x ) and have then merely to divide by the time t , a calculation which can be performed mentally if the intervals are suitably chosen .
Now it is always possible to make the range between the initial and final values of a/ ( l\#151 ; a ) equal to unity by introducing the appropriate resistance in the resistance box .
Thus in the above example it was found that the ratio between the initial and final conductivities was 2-773 : 1 .
We have then if = 2*773 , and we wish to make i\#151 ; f = 1 .
From these two equations we obtain i = 1*564 and / = 0*564 .
We have therefore so to adjust the resistance that the initial value of aj(l\#151 ; a ) shall be 1*564 .
This refers to the N/ 100 solution after mixing , whilst the conductivity actually measured is that of a N/ 95 solution .
We must therefore increase the value 1*564 in the ratio of 100 to 95 , and thus obtain 1*646 as the value of a/ ( l\#151 ; a ) which the N/ 95 solution of caustic soda must exhibit if the difference between the initial and final values of \#151 ; is to be unity .
In the table this value of u/ ( l\#151 ; a)corresponds to =0*622 .
We therefore adjust the resistance in the box , either by trial or by calculation , until the minimum for the N/ 95 solution of caustic soda is exactly at this part of the bridge , and then proceed with the experiment .
This adjustment , though tedious in description , only occupies a few minutes in practice , and saves much time in the subsequent calculations .
Even if readings are taken every minute , the calculation of the constant - .
\#151 ; \#151 ; \#151 ; from each observation can be performed t 1 \#151 ; x in the interval between two readings , generally without the necessity of putting pen to paper .

In the above instance the velocity constant is thus 0T17 -4- O'01 = 11*7 .
As a further example of the method , I append a series of observations made by Mr. D. C. Crichton , B.Sc. , on the velocity of saponification of ethyl acetate by caustic soda at 240-85 , the concentration of both substances being N/ 100 .

The conductivity method , even without special apparatus , is at least as accurate as the titration method carried out under specially favourable circumstances , and for rapid reactions is incomparably less trying in execution .
