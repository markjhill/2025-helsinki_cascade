Observation of the Winter Solstice of 1812 , with the Mural Circle at Greenwich .
By John Pond , Esq. Astronomer Royal , F.R.S. Blead February 25 , 1813 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1813 , p. 123 .
] The weather was so extremely unfavourable , that it was not possible to obtain more than eight observations of the sun , from which the obliquity of the ecliptic at the late solstice could be deduced ; from these it is inferred to have been 230 27 ' 471"35 , that from the summer solstice having been 230 27 ' 51 " 3 .
This small discordance , it is observed , might be easily made to disappear by a slight modification of Bradley 's refractions ; but the Astronomer Royal has not yet had an opportunity of making a sufficient number of observations on circumpolar stars with the new circle , to warrant making any corrections in his table of refractions , and he leaves the subject of the discordance of the solstices for discussion in a separate paper ,
