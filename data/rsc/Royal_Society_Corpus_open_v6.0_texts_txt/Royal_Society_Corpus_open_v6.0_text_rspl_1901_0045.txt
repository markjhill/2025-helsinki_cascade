J ' In my father 's book on Vegetable Mould and Earthworms an esti mate is given of the rate at which stones placed on the surface of the soil are buried by the action of earthworms .
The estimate is rough and as far as I know no attempt has been made to detect such movements when small , or to determine them accurately when they are The experiments described in this paper were undertaken originally to measure accurately the downward movement of a stone-caused by earthworms .
The upward and downward movements due to varying moisture of the soil and to frost were found to be much larger than was expected .
These movements , interesting in themselves , increase he difficulty of accurately determining the movement due to the action of earthworms.* The experiment was begun on September B , 1877 , and the position selected is in a near^ level field which had probably been pasture for considerably more than fifty years .
It is to the south of my father 's house at Down , close to some railings separating the field from the lawn and under a large Spanish chestnut tree .
He approved at the tame of the selection of this position ; at a later date he considered a mistake had been made , as he thought there were fewer worms under miv/ T " ecessary , * ' haTe a flxed Point from which the displacement might be measured ; this was managed in the following way--An iron rod was driven into the ground by means of a heavy hammer ; it was then removed , and a copper rod , slightly larger ( 22 mm in 2'63\gt ; met ' T T"7 ^ h''e J the b'*t0m o\#163 ; the rod Tas about 2 63 metres from the surface .
The top of this rod is the point from which all measurements were taken .
^ A circular stone about 460 mm. in diameter and about 57 mm thick weighmg about 23 kilos .
, was placed on the ground with the rod pro- ' than the Zlfh * ^ T T ?
*'A ^ C^linder\gt ; lightly smaller nthe hole m the stone , had previously been firmly fixed in the hole by running in melted lead .
The brass cylinder Ld three pro jec mg pieces at its top ; three symmetrical radial right-angle grooves re cut , one m each of these projecting pieces .
This gavf the usual 954 Mr. H. Darwin .
Ou the Small Vertical Movements form of geometrical bearings for the three rounded feet of the stand which carried the micrometer used for measuring the relative positions of the stone and the top of rod .
The action of the earthworms would cause the stone to sink relatively to the top of the rod , but the following other causes should also be considered:\#151 ; l The Growth of the Roots of the The copper rod passed through about 2-63 metres of slightly sandy red clay which overlies the chalk , and contains many flints ; some of these were broken or displaced by the passage of the iron rod .
Great force was required to draw the rod out of the ground , and in doing so its sides became scored by the flints .
It is , therefore , safe to assume that the flints were pressed with considerable force against the rod , and that their sharp edges gripped it tightly .
The point where the rod was gripped , and where there was no relative movement between it and the clay , was unknown ; probably , however , it was well below the level of the roots of the tree The roots growing larger in diameter would raise the stone relatively to the top of the rod .
The amount of this movement is quite uncertain . .
2 .
Dampness of the Ground.\#151 ; The clay and the surface soil both , no doubt swell with increase of moisture .
The swelling of the clay above ' the unknown point at which the rod is gripped will raise the stone , and the swelling of the surface soil will have the same effect .
3 .
Expansion of the Rod from Change of Temperature , \#151 ; The effect of this is very small and is quite negligible when measurements , taken at the same * time of year , are compared .
If we take a high estimate and assume that the summer and winter temperature of ^ the ro differed by 10 ' C. , the relative movement of the stone and the top of the rod would be about 0*4 mm. ; this is on the assumption that the rod is only gripped close to its lower end , and that the expansion practically of its whole length is taken into account An attempt was made to eliminate this error by sinking two rods alongside of each other , one being of iron and one of copper and by taking measurements from both rods .
This attempt failed , and the results now given are the measurements from the copper 10 on y. The measuring apparatus is shown in fig. 1 .
It consists of a brass rina ; A , with three short rounded feet B , which rest in the radial grooves before mentioned .
This annular base carries a vertical brass rod C , to which is soldered an arm with V-bearmgs D. Trunnions _ were fixed to the usual form of micrometer screw gauge as shown m the figure , the trunnions were supported by the V-bearmgs m the aim , * Professor Judd pointed out that the clay with dints through ^ passed probably contained small quantities of calcium carbonate which " 'uld b slowly dissolved by rain , and that this would produce a small error.-May 2 , 1901 .

255 and the micrometer screw was used for the measurement .
G and II are the tops of the iron and copper rods ; the micrometer screw is turned till its lower end K just touches one of the rods ; the upper end of the screw is not used at all .
The stand and micrometer were kept indoors till wanted .

The method of reading was as follows The grooves for the feet of the stand were cleaned , and the stand placed with its feet resting in them .
The trunnions of the micrometer gauge were placed m the V-bearings ; the screw was then adjusted till the lower end just touched the top of one rod ; by swinging the gauge d~'"8 " th6 ^ tUs bemwfT T m0ve ?
sideways by sliding the trunnions along the healings ; this horizontal movement brought the screw over the centre second rod , and a second measurement was taken .
This second measurement , however , was not used .

On the Small Movements of the decimals was not reliable .
This error existed because the horizontal movement of the trunnions along its bearings was not strictly parallel to the surface of the top of the rods from which the measurement was taken .
As the readings from one rod only were used , it would have been better if this lateral displacement had been impossible With care , however , consecutive measurements agreed within 0-01 mm. , showing that the method was capable of far greater accuracy than was required .
During the experiment the stone sank more than the range of the micrometer screw .
The arm was unsoldered , moved upwards sufficiently far to allow the screw to be used again , and was then resoldered This operation , no doubt , introduced a small erroi .

The curve shown by the dotted line roughly represents the dampness '1 he-T I , M- ' Baldwin Latham has most kindly supplied me with the rainfall during this period at Leaves Green , about 1 mile distant and nearly at the same level as Down .
I have assumed that the soil dries at a uniform rate ; this assumption cannot be correct , but no other is possible .
The varying rate of drying will , no doubt , depend ^temperature , wind , and dryness of the air , as well as on the rate at wmcn the water drains away .
The ordinates are proportional to the amount of the rainfall , less the assumed amount which has evaporated or drained away ; both quantities are calculated from February 19 , the date of the beginning of the curve .
The curves representing the dampness of the soil and the movement of the stone are 16 mm. apart on February 19 , the beginning of the experiment , and the rate of drying has been assumed to bf end^/ the experiment ^ 16 , part ' " 'Ct'W 9 ' at tha O Tm TT f'll0W 6ach 'ther in a striking manner after May 18 On May 9 the stone-curve rises to a sharp peak when there was no rSrSrfaliSUggeSti^ an error in reading the micrometer on that date ; this is the most probable explanation .

The curve is constructed from readings taken near the middle of January when the ground was free from frost The points which correspond to these readings are surrounded by small circles and are joined by straight lines .
The points are at equal distances apart of a Stone laid on the Surface of the Ground .
259 in a horizontal direction , and their vertical distance apart is 4/ 5 of the actual displacement of the stone , the numbers on the scale representing mms .
This curve is marked " Winter .
" There were no winter readings aftei lbb6 .
The Summer curve is made in a similar manner ; the dates of the observations are more irregular : the corresponding points , however , are equally spaced in a horizontal direction .

3-14 The stone was accidentally removed and no readings were taken alter 1896 .
If we take the winter readings , we find that the stone sank 8 mm. in the eight years from January 1878 to March 1886 , or at he average rate of 2-22 mm. per year , rather less than 1 inch in ten years .
My father found* that small objects left on the surface of a field were buried 2-2 inches in ten years .
This result is obtained from observations in a field near the stone .
The large stone sank more slowly , a result we should expect .
The curve shows that the rate of sinking was greater at the egmmng than at the end ; this is probably due to the decaying of the grass ; the turf was not removed , the stone resting directly on it .
e third curve marked " Rain " on this diagram , roughly indicates the dampness of the ground .
The ordinates of the curve are proportional to the rainfall at Greenwich Observatory during the twenty days \gt ; efore the date of the summer reading .
The curve is only a very rough mdicatmn of the dampness of the soil , as no account is taken of the rainfall for a longer period than twenty days before the observation , T .

no doubt is due to the greater variation in the dampness of the soil in summer than in winter .
The rain-curve and stone-curve roughly follow each other .
In 1888 , however , the stone rises and the rain-curve shows very little rain for the twenty days before September 20 , the date of this observation .
During June , July , and August a great amount of rain fell ; and although there was very little rain from September 1 to 20 , the ground was probably damper than the rain-curve indicates .
At Hayes , 3| miles from Down , the rainfall on these days was greater than at Greenwich , but still very small .
If the points marked A and B are joined by a straight line , it will roughly represent the mean movement during the first nine years of the experiment .
These points were selected so that the line joining them appeared to represent the mean movement to the best of my judgment .
In the same manner the points C and D were selected , so that the line joining them represented the mean movement of the last nine years of the experiment .
The movements deduced by this method are 2-3 mm. per year for the first nine years , and 0'36 mm. the last nine years .
The slow movements for the latter period ate surprising .
The movement given above and obtained from the winter curve is 2'22 mm. per year .

Durum the last five years the rainfall on the twenty days before each observation was distinctly above the average ; it was 2*09 inches , and the average for these twenty days during the whole experiment is Meeting for Discussion , May 9 , 1901 .
1 54 inches .
This will perhaps partially explain the slow movement at the end of the experiment .
The curve , Fig. 4 , shows the movement due to frost .
It is constructed as before , and the ordinates represent the position of the stone magnified 8 times .
On February 2 , at 12.45 p.m. , the thaw was beginning , but the ground was still hard ; readings were also taken at 3.25 p.m. and 5.25 p.m. The stone fell 2'37 mm. in 4 hours 40 minutes .
