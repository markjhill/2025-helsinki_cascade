1889.1 On Salts of a Base containing Chromium and Urea .
321 Ilf an iron ring which , has never been magnetised has its curve of magnetisation determined for an ascending series of forces , if it bo then thoroughly demagnetised by a succession of reversed currents of descending intensity , and the curve of magnetisation is redetermined , I find that the two curves differ materially .
The demagnetising currents do not reduce the iron to its virgin state .
For small forces the second curve is below the first , indicating less induction for the same magnetising force ; for medium forces the second curve is above the first , whilst for large forces the two curves agree .
If a ring be heated with a current through the primary coil and the heating bo continued till the ring has ceased to be magnetic , if then the current be stopped and the ring be allowed to cool , I find that the ring is not entirely demagnetised by the heating , but that it recollects its state of magnetisation before heating .
It would seem that the magnetic molecules of the iron , having been directed by the magnetising force whilst they were magnetic , retain in part their direction when they have ceased to be magnetic by heating , find- tMt when they again become magnetic by cooling its effect is apparent .

" On a Series of Salts of a Base containing Chromium and Urea.\#151 ; No. 2 .
" By W. J. Sell , M.A. , F.I.C. With Crystallographic Determinations by Professor W. J. Lewis , Cambridge .
Communicated by Professor Gr .
D. LlVElNG , F.R.S. Received February 1 , 1889 .
In a former paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 33 , 1882 ) a number of salts were described derived from a base formed by a combination of chromium with urea .
It was stated that the chief product of the .
regulated action of chromyl dichloride on dry urea , and subsequent treatment with water , is a green crystalline powder , insoluble in alcohol , ether , or chloroform .
The compound thus obtained contains chlorine as an essential component , while , as noted , the product of crystallisation from hot water is the pure dichromate of the base .
At the date of the previous publication the nature of this green salt , as a preliminary to the study of the reaction by which it is produced , was ^uder investigation .
The present paper deals with these subjects , and describes a number of additional salts of the base .
The failure in the attempt to purify , the green salt by crystallisa-'n from water , added to its insolubility in all other available neutral Mr. W. J. Sell and Prof. W. J. Lewis .
[ Feb. U menstrua , rendered it advisable to make some preliminary analytic^ determinations on the different samples of crude well-washed sub .
stance .
From the results obtained it was evident that the salt was either a chlorochromate of chromium urea , or a compound of the dichromate and chloride , a conclusion which at once harmonises with its genesis , and suggests the trial of dilute hydrochloric acid as a possible vehicle for its purification by crystallisation .
The purification by dilute hydrochloric acid containing one volume of strong acid to nine of water , was successful , the numbers obtained on analysis being substantially the same as those obtained from the crude well-washed product of the reaction .
The analytical results were satisfied by either of the formulae\#151 ; ( 1 .
) { ( C0N2H4)12Cr2}^fs'7-)22H !
!0 , or ( 2 .
) { ( COIPH')i*Cr2}^sci2Hi !
0The latter , however , is regarded as very improbable .
It is difficult to believe that a chlorochromate in fine powder can withstand the action of water for weeks without appreciable change .
The fact also that the hydrochloric acid used in its recrystallisation may be replaced by metallic chlorides , such as those of sodium or potassium , is against the second formula .
Moreover , the decomposition effected when the salt is recrystallised from water , may be cited .
A chlorochromate having the formula given in ( 2 ) should normally decompose , according to the equation\#151 ; { ( CON2H4)12Cr2 } govern + H20 = 2HCl + { ( CON3H4)\#171 ; Cia}c\lt ; Si ' whereas the decomposition effected by water is of a totally different character , and may be represented thus:\#151 ; 3{(CON2H4)12Cr2}^[2'7^ = 2{(C0N2H4)i2Cr2}(Cr207)3 + { ( CON2H4)18Cr2}Cl8 .
These facts may be regarded as conclusive that formula ( 1 ) is more correct representation of this compound , which may be called\#151 ; Dichlordichromate of Chromium TIrea .
The following results were obtained on analysis:\#151 ; The samples employed were dried by pressure between bibulous paper .

325 188\amp ; ] The question naturally arises , " Is the compound last considered the initial chief product of the reaction of chromyl dichloride on urea , or is it produced from this compound by interaction with the water added subsequently ?
As at the present time difficulties , which seem insurmountable ( see below ) , attend the direct determination of this question , and as , moreover , it was suspected that the salt above described is the product of the action of water on the chlorochromate of the base , it was determined before proceeding further to attempt the isolation of such compounds .
With this object in view an investigation was made of the action of aqueous hydrochloric acid on the compound last considered .
As mentioned above , the dichlordi-chromate crystallises out unaltered from a hot solution containing one volume of strong acid to nine of water .
If , however , the quantity of acid to water be increased to one in six , a salt crystallises out as the solution cools in brownish-yellow crusts of small crystals .
When a much stronger acid than one in six is used , the product is a mixture of the brown-yellow salt and green needles of the chloride .
The examination of this brown-yellow compound showed it to be the dichlortetrachlorochromate of the base having the composition\#151 ; { ( CON2H4)120r2}^3r'3C13H2O , formed from the dichlordichromate by the following change :\#151 ; { ( C0N2H4 ) }12Cr2^3r3'7 + 4HC1 = { ( C0N2H4)120r2}^r'3C1+2H20 .
The colour of the new salt presents a striking contrast to that of the preceding compound .
With the exception of the acid of the strength from which it has been crystallised , it is either insoluble fh 'r ^ecomPosed by , all the usual solvents .
With alcohol | chloride of the base is formed , and the usual products of the 1 action of chromic acid on that reagent .
Water effects immediate ^composition , the colour changing to the characteristic dark green of 326 Mr. W. J. Sell and Prof. W. J. Lewis .
[ Feb. 14 the dichlordichromate , hydrochloric acid being at the same time set free , thus :\#151 ; oojm| { ( CON2H4)12Cr2 }^2r0 , C1 +2H*0 = +4HC1 .
It is extremely probable that this salt is the chief initial product of the reaction between ehromyl dichloride and urea , and that the subsequent addition of water decomposes it , as shown by the preceding equation .
Granting that a chlorochromate is formed ( and as the reaction takes place in presence of excess of chromyl dichloride , it ig difficult to resist this conclusion ) , the only salt of this character which would normally decompose by water with production of the dichlordichromate , is the compound under consideration .

] On Salts of a Base containing Chromium and Urea .
327 The direct decision of such an apparently simple matter as the composition of the chief initial product of the reaction has , np to the present time , been found to be impossible .
No reagent or mixture of reagents has been discovered which at once dissolves any excess of materials used and the other products of the reaction , without producing some change in the composition of the chief product .
A careful examination of the reaction between chromyl diehloride and urea was made by taking known weights of the materials , collecting and measuring the gaseous products , and after the addition of water to the residue , estimating the dichlordichromate produced , as well as the other products which pass into solution .
The dichlordichromate was then calculated as dichlortetrachlorochromate .
Without going into a mass of detail , it may be stated that the results of the examination gave numbers very nearly agreeing with the equation\#151 ; 13CO(NH\#187 ; )*+9CrO !
Cls = { ( CON2H*)iW}^r'3C1 + Cr\#187 ; Cl\#171 ; +H2Cr04 + H20 + CO2 N2 + 3C12 .
With regard to the preparation of these substances , it may be well to note that the reaction of chromyl dichloride on urea succeeds best in narrow test-tubes , working with about 3 grams of urea .
On a larger scale the reaction becomes very difficult to control , and decomposition more or less complete is very liable to ensue .
On the other hand , unless the reaction is fairly vigorous and the temperature allowed to rise , little or none of the compound is produced .
A considerable amount of time has been taken up in attempts to prepare this class of compounds by some modification of the above process which should present less complexity , and thus offer some hope of arriving at their constitution .
Passing over the unsuccessful attempts , it was discovered that the dichromate of the base may be obtained by the action of chromic acid on urea .
In the month of September of last year three separate portions of nearly equal weights of urea and chromic anhydride were dissolved in a small quantity of cold water , the solutions covered with filter-paper , and allowed to stand at the ordinary temperature .
On examination in March the solutions had changed colour , become quite thick from evaporation , and on addition of water a small quantity of sparingly soluble green crystals were found to be left .
These , when separated and recrystallised from hot water , had all the cha-racters of the dichromate of the base , and gave on ignition 41*32 per cent , of Cr203 , against 41'43 as required by theory for the dichro-mate .
It was subsequently found that the dichromate may be formed in some quantity by evaporating the aqueous solutions of the mixed Mr. W. J. Sell and Prof. W. J. Lewis .
[ Feb. 14 substances at about 60 ' C. The nature of this change is at present under investigation .
In addition to the foregoing , the following new compounds have been examined:\#151 ; The Chromite .

The foregoing experiment having failed to give the pure oxalate , recourse was had to the decomposition of the pure chloride with silver oxalate .
The two substances warmed together with water for some time and filtered gave an abundant crop of dark-green crystals belonging to the anorthic system .
Examination showed , however , that the salt differed from the preceding one only in containing more water of crystallisation , and that it readily parts with the latter even in a corked tube , becoming , less soluble and possibly forming the preceding compound .

When a warm solution of iodine in potassium iodide is added to a warm and moderately concentrated solution of the normal iodide , a considerable crop of crystals separates out on cooling in transparent browm-red micaceous scales .
If , however , the solutions are heated to near the boiling point before mixing , or are more dilute , especially if the quantity of iodine added is small , the crystals deposited are in the form of long opaque black needles , having a well-marked green reflection , which is , to a certain extent , lost on drying .
Not unfre-quently , however , both forms are deposited from the same solution .
The apparent dissimilarity of form and general appearance led to the analysis of the two modifications being conducted separately .
The numbers obtained , however , are identical , and lead to the formula being assigned to this remarkable substance .
Ihe difference in appearance of the two forms is possibly due to certain of the faces in one being differently developed to those in the ether .
Both yield apparently identical crystals when deposited by spontaneous evaporation from alcoholic solutions , or from the nearly riling solution in aqueous potassium iodide .
The substance dissolves freely in alcohol , very sparingly in benzene , \amp ; cd is scarcely affected by chloroform , only j118 !

The Sulphatoper iodide .
This salt is precipitated in silky yellowish-brown needles when a solution of iodine in potassium iodide is added to a solution of the sulphate or any other salt of the base containing sulphuric acid .
It is practically insoluble in cold water , dissolving , however , to a small extent in hot water from which it crystallises on cooling in brown needles .
The solvent action of water is not materially affected by the presence of potassium iodide , and it is insoluble in the usual neutral menstrua .
On boiling with water the compound is decomposed , iodine to the extent of about two-thirds of the total amount present escaping with the steam .
The composition of this remarkable salt would appear to be ( C0.N2H4)13Cr3(S04)2I2I4 .

341 Carbonatoperiodide No. 2 .
When in the preparation of the preceding compound the quantity of the base has been considerably diminished by precipitation , the further addition of iodine no longer produces a yellowish but a well-marked brown precipitate consisting also of fine needles .
The brown colour is not due to admixed periodide , as it is perfectly unaffected by alcohol or aqueous solution of potassium iodide , moreover it was formed in the presence of a considerable excess of ammonium sesqui-carbonate .
The crystals are insoluble in all neutral menstrua , and decomposed by hydrochloric acid with effervescence and separation of free iodine .
The analyses are rather unsatisfactory , but point to the formula ( C0N2H4)12Cr2(C03)2I6 .
From the nature of the case it is well nigh impossible to see when the precipitation of one compound ends and the other begins , and there is no doubt that the sample analysed contained some of the preceding compound .
A. better result would probably have been obtained by adding the dilute solution of the normal iodide to the solution of iodine and ammonium sesquicarbonate , so as to maintain an excess of iodine .

This beautiful compound is sparingly soluble in cold , more readily in hot water , especially in presence of alkaline bromides , and crystallises out in large prismatic aggregations ; alcohol especially when warm takes up the substance , freely decomposing it and depositing the normal bromide , a similar result being obtained with ether and carbon disulphide , in which , however , it is much less soluble .
The crystals rapidly lose bromine on exposure to the air , yielding bright-green pseudomorphs of the normal bromide .
A specimen of the compound in the form of micaceous scales exposed for three days over lime gave 36 .
5 per cent , of bromine , against 36 78 required for the normal salt .
Analysis leads to the conclusion that this substance has a similar composition to that of the periodide , viz. , ( CON2H4)12Cr2Br66Br2 .

The examination of th\#174 ; decompositions which they undergo under varied conditions , is a problem little more than touched upon , and the same may be said o the action of chromyl dichloride on substituted ureas , including 1889 ] On Salts of a Base containing Chromium and Urea .

The crystals are of a dark-green colour , and are only translucent in moderately thin plates .
They belong to the oblique system , and have a very perfect and facile cleavage , perpendicular to the plane of symmetry .
This cleavage plane , though absent , or at any rate very infrequent , as a natural plane , has been selected as the base .
The planes o(491 ) are much striated , parallel to their intersection with one another , and give very bad reflections .
The general habit of the crystals simulates that of a crystal of the rhombohedral system with two rhombohedral forms .
The faces j ?
