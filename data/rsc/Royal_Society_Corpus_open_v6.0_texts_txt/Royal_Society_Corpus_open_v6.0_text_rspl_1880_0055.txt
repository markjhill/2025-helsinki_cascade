of any number , such as the modulus of any other system of logarithms can be found , and its reciprocal , whence the radix for that system can be calculated by simple multiplication .
This is sufficient to show the practicability of the present method , and generally the comparatively small trouble which it would occasion for the first construction of logarithmic tables .

" On the Influence of Temperature on the Musical Pitch of Harmonium Reeds .
, \gt ; By Alexander J. Ellis , B.A. , F.R.S. , F.S.A. Received January 17 , 1881 .
In my " Notes of Observations on Musical Beats , " I stated ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 30 , p. 532 ) that the influence of temperature on harmonium reeds was , so far as I was aware , unknown .
Since then I have made some observations which at least approximately determine it , but there are so many sources of small errors ( stated below ) that still more uncertainty must attach to the results , than to the determination of the influence of temperature on the pitch of tuning-forks { ibid. , p. 523 ) .
Roughly we may say that the pitch of harmonium reeds is affected in the same direction as that of tuning-forks ( heat flattening and cold sharpening ) , and very nearly to twice the amount , that is , by about 1 in 10,000 vibrations for each degree Fahrenheit .
The following is the process pursued with the exact figures obtained:\#151 ; Towards the end of November , 1879 , in the South Kensington Museum , with artificial temperatures ( observed in each case ) varying from 53 ' to 60 ' F. on different days , I determined the beats which all the reeds of Appunn 's treble tonometer ( ibid. , p. 527 ) made with Scheibler 's forks ( ibid. , p. 525 ) .
On 1st September , 1880 , and again on 3rd September , 1880 , at constant natural temperatures of 73 ' and 79 ' F. respectively , I took the beats of twelve of the reeds ( the same on each occasion ) with the same forks of Scheibler with which I had measured those reeds in November , 1879 .
It is , of course , impossible to say whether either forks or reeds were precisely of the same temperature as the air .
The reeds were enclosed in the wooden chest of the tonometer , which had been reposing in a glass wall-case in the same room during he night , and might not have fully acquired the general steady temperature of the room .
The beats for each reed were counted 10 times each for 10 seconds , with each of two , and sometimes three forks , and the mean of each set of beats was employed .
The known pitch of the forks at 59 F. ( ibid. , p. 525 ) was then reduced to the temperature of the observation on the supposition that the number of vibrations altered by 1 in 20,000 for 4l4 Mr. A. J. Ellis .
On Influence of Temperature [ Feb. 3 1 ' F. ( ibid. , p. 523 ) .
By adding or subtracting the mean of the observed beats from this calculated pitch of the fork , the pitches of the harmonium reeds at those temperatures were determined , and the mean of all the determinations for each reed was taken .
In all cases I calculated to two places of decimals , but the second place cannot be depended on when counting the beats ; and as the result is considerably affected by the second place , the process is not so satisfactory as could be wished , and must be regarded as only preliminary .
The loss of pitch in proceeding from the lower to the higher temperatures thus determined was divided by the number of vibrations at the lower temperature , and also by the number of degrees F. of difference of temperature .
The result or coefficient of temperature , being the alteration for 1 vibration and 1 ' F. , would serve to reduce one pitch to the other , on the supposition , which cannot be more than approximately correct , that the alteration for temperature is uniform , and is the same for reeds of very different pitches and makes .
Such a coefficient is , however , clearly better than none at all , and is especially useful in determining pitch by Appunn 's instrument .
In the following table the number of the reed is that marked on Appunn 's treble tonometer ( ibid. , p. 527 ) .
The " pitch " means the number of double vibrations in a second made by the reed , on the three occasions of observation already mentioned , and as the temperature was variable during the first observations , made on different days , though constant on the same day , this is annexed in a separate column .
As harmonium reeds are subject to rather sudden small alterations from causes not yet investigated , it is not possible to be perfectly sure that all the reeds would have shown precisely the same pitch at the same temperature for observations made at intervals of more than nine months .
I am inclined to think that reeds 22 and 23 must have so altered .
In other observations on reed 22 , made 14th July , 1880 , at 7l''5 F. , I obtained practically the same results as here , differing from those of all the other reeds .
The observations on that day were not sufficiently numerous nor exact to be here recorded , but they agree very well with those now given .
The flattening of the reeds for each increase of temperature is quite unmistakable , even in the passage from pitch II to III , with a difference of only 6 ' F. The pitch III of reed 26 is certainly a bad observation , as the results of the determinations by the two forks differed much more than usual , and it should , therefore , be thrown out of consideration .
Altogether for such a small difference as 6 ' F. the observations could not be made with sufficient accuracy to secure trustwoi'thy results .
Even for the greatest difference of temperature , 26 ' F. , the difference of pitch never amounts to so much as '9 vibration in a second for the reeds observed .
The three last columns give the coefficients of temperature arising from comparing these three pitches two and two , namely , I and II , J 881 .

The results marked + should , I think , be relucted , because o\#163 ; the probable alteration in reeds and 23 , the badness of the observation on reed 26 pitch III , and the too great closeness of the temperatures for pitches II and III .
Rejecting these , we obtain , as the mean of the results from I \amp ; II , and II \amp ; III respectively , the coefficients *0000938 and *0000930 ; so that either *00009 or .0001 , ' that is , an alteration of 9 in 100,000 or 1 in 10,000 vibrations in a second for each change of 1 ' F. may be used with tolerable certainty , diminishing for heat and increasing for cold .
Thus a tuning-fork like Scheibler 's of 440 vibrations at 59 ' F. ( his standard tuning A ) , an harmonium reed like Appunn 's , and an open metallic flue-pipe of an organ , both in unison with the fork at the same temperature ( the , last having a coefficient of *00104 acting in the opposite direction ) would become 439*56 , 439*12 , and 449*15 , at 79 ' F. respectively , so that it would be quite impossible to play the organ and harmonium together .
