Note Supplementary to a Paper On the Radio-active Minerals .
By the Hon. R. J. Strutt , F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge .
( Received May 29 , \#151 ; Read June 8 , 1905 .
) In a paper read before the Society on February 28 , 1905,1 drew attention to the fact that all thorium minerals , so far as could be ascertained , appeared to contain uranium and radium .
Since then , I have examined a number of additional minerals , in order to test the induction further .
The result has been quite confirmatory of the original conclusion .
I have , in this further investigation , contented myself with determining the thorium and radium , for it may now be considered proved that radium is a product of uranium , and it is much easier to establish the presence of radium by its emanation than to detect uranium by chemical analysis .
The experimental methods explained in the former paper were employed .
The results are as follows:\#151 ; Mineral .

In conclusion , I must express my best thanks to several friends , especially Professor W. R. Dunstan , for specimens of these minerals , which would , in some cases , have been impossible to procure otherwise .
* This consisted of pure grains of monazite , picked out from the commercial sand .
