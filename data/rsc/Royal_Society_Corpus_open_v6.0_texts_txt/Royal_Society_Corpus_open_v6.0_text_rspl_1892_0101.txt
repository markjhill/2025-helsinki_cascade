] The nerve degeneration is associated with a fatty degeneration of the muscles , which is proportional to the degree of degeneration .
The heart , in all cases , shows advanced fatty degeneration .
Diphtheritic Membrcme.\#151 ; The membrane in diphtheria consists chemically of fibrin , hetero-albumose , proto- , and deutero-albumose , i.e.t it is in a state of digestion .
From it was obtained an extract which was 3\#151 ; 5 times as toxic as the albumoses removed from the body , producing the same symptoms ( fever , paralysis ) and the same nerve degeneration .
This poison is probably the same as that isolated by Roux and Yersin , and is presumably of a ferment nature , the albnmoses and organic acid found in the bodies of the patients being the result of the action of the ferment on the proteids of the tissues .
Diphtheria would , therefore , be , from this point of view , a disease in which the Bacillus diphtherias growing in the membrane excretes a ferment which , being absorbed , digests the proteids of the body , with the formation of albumoses and an organic acid , the action of the former of which is to produce fever and paralysis dependent on nerve degeneration .
