The Electrical Conductivity of Dilute Solutions of Sulphuric Acid .

) S 1.\#151 ; Introduction and Summary of If the measure of the electrical conductivity of a solution be divided by that of the concentration expressed in gramme-equivalents per unit volume , we obtain a quantity which may be called the equivalent conductivity of the solution .
If the conductivity of the solvent used be subtracted from that of the solution , the corresponding quantity may be taken as giving the equivalent conductivity of the solute .
As is well known , the equivalent conductivity of neutral salts when dissolved in water approaches a limiting value as the dilution is increased , and , in terms of the ionisation theory , this limiting value corresponds with complete ionisation .
With solutions of acids and alkalies , however , the phenomena are different .
As dilution proceeds , the equivalent conductivity reaches a maximum at a concentration of about a one-thousandth or a two-thousandth of a gramme-equivalent per litre , and then falls rapidly as the dilution is pushed farther .
It has been supposed that this diminution of equivalent conductivity at extreme dilutions is due to interaction between the solute and the impurities which remain even in redistilled water .
Kohlrausch* has given evidence to show that the chief impurity in water carefully redistilled is carbonic acid , and Goodwin and Haskellf have corrected the observed values of the equivalent conductivity of nitric and * 'Wissensch .

Electrical [ Nov. 8 , hydrochloric acids on the assumption that " the total effect of the acid and of the impurities in the water on the conductivity of each other is already produced when a relatively small quantity of acid has been added to the water .
" These observers conclude that the diminution of equivalent conductivity of dilute acids is due to the presence of carbon dioxide .
In order to examine the real effect of carbonic acid and other impurities on the conductivity of an acid solution , the writer and his wife have carried out an investigation in which the amount of impurity was varied , and the result observed .
The conductivity of dilute solutions of sulphuric acid and its variation with concentration was determined in four solvents : ( 1 ) good quality redistilled water ; ( 2 ) the same water to which a trace of carbon dioxide had been added ; ( 3 ) the same water with a trace of potassium chloride ; ( 4 ) the same water which had been freed as far as possible from carbonic acid and other volatile impurities by repeated boiling under diminished pressure .
In each case the conductivity of the solvent was subtracted from that of the solution .
The results may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; Within the limits of experimental error , the equivalent conductivity of a dilute acid is not affected by boiling the water under diminished pressure , though the conductivity of the solvent is thereby much diminished .
The equivalent conductivity of the acid is also unaffected by the addition of a small quantity of potassium chloride to the water , though the conductivity of the solvent is thereby much increased .
But , by the addition of a little carbonic acid , the equivalent conductivity of the sulphuric acid is diminished appreciably .
It is natural to conclude that , while the presence of carbonic acid would produce a diminution of equivalent conductivity of the same character as that observed , it does not explain the total effect .
S 2.\#151 ; The Experiments .
The solvent used was water kindly prepared by Mr. T. G. Bedford and Mr. W. Spens .
It was distilled in a glass still with potassium permanganate and sulphuric acid , and then redistilled in a platinum still with baryta water .
It was collected in a large stoppered flask of Jena glass , in which it was kept till used .
Its conductivity was about 0'9 x 10~6 or BO x 10-6 in reciprocal ohms per centimetre cube .
The best water obtained by Kohlrausch by distillation in air had a conductivity of about 0*7 x 10-6 in these units .
The sulphuric acid was supplied in a sealed glass bulb by Messrs. Baird and Tatlock as chemically pure acid mixed with 50 per cent , of water .

] Conductivity of Dilute Solutions of Acid .
579 the purposes of this investigation absolute values of the equivalent conductivity were not needed to very great accuracy .
The conductivity of a stock solution ( B ) , prepared by diluting by weight the 50-per-cent , acid , was therefore determined in a resistance cell , and the concentration of the solution calculated from Kohlrausch 's results .
The constant of the cell was determined by measuring in it the resistance of a solution of potassium chloride , prepared by weighing out a quantity of the pure salt dried by heating in a tube in a current of dry air .
The cell constant was found to be 0T274 , a number which , divided by the resistance of the solution in ohms , gave its conductivity in reciprocal ohms per centimetre cube .
The concentration of the stock solution ( B ) was thus estimated as 0-02408 gramme-equivalents per litre .
Three other stock solutions ( C , D , and F ) were also used .
They were prepared by diluting B by weight .
Their concentrations in gramme-equivalents per litre were :\#151 ; ( C ) 0-002379 , ( D ) 0-005212 and ( F ) 0-005928 .
The cell used for the resistance measurements consisted of a tube of Jena glass about 18 cm .
long and 4 cm .
in diameter .
A rubber cork closed it so as to be airtight , and carried a box-wood core , through which passed two glass tubes supporting the electrodes , and another glass tube for adding stock solution and exhausting the apparatus by means of an air-pump .
The electrodes were of stout platinum sheet , and were fixed to thick platinum wires fused through the glass tubes .
The electrodes were platinised electro-lytically , and then heated to redness .
This process gives a rough surface , which does not seem appreciably to absorb electrolytes from a solution .
About 50 grammes of water were placed in the tube cell , which was then weighed .
The rubber head was inserted , and the cell placed in a water bath , the temperature of which was kept within a degree or less of 18 ' C. and observed accurately .
The resistance of the water was measured , and corrected to 18 ' by the known temperature coefficient .
Small quantities of stock solution were then added successively , by means of a small vessel of Jena glass , which was weighed before and after each addition .
The resistance measurements were made with alternating currents by means of a resistance box , moving-coil galvanometer , and alternator driven by hand , as described in former papers.* The accuracy of measurement varied as the resistance altered , but was seldom less than one in a thousand .

] Conductivity of Dilute Solutions of Sulphuric Acid .
583 solvent was increased to about the same extent by adding potassium cloride and carbon dioxide , the latter is very slightly ionised , so that a much greater equivalent amount of carbonic acid than of potassium chloride was present .
The addition of an impurity , which is certainly present to some extent in redistilled water , is thus seen to increase the effect we are investigating .
The diminution of equivalent conductivity is more marked , and the maximum of the curve is reached at a higher concentration .
At this stage of the work it seemed possible that the whole effect might be explicable by the interaction of the acid with the impurities of the solvent .
The next step was to remove as much as possible of the residual carbon dioxide from a sample of the purest water obtainable .
The water was placed in the tube-cell , and the air above it exhausted as completely as possible , the water boiling freely under the low pressure .
Air was then re-admitted through tubes filled with small lumps of caustic potash to absorb the carbon dioxide .
This operation of exhaustion was repeated five times .
The conductivity was reduced by this means from 0-98 x 10~6 to 0'57 x 10-6 .
The usual additions , of sulphuric acid were then made .
The resulting curve , shown in the diagram by spots and crosses in triangular frames , is not appreciably different from that obtained with the usual water as solvent .
This result seems conclusive against the supposition that the abnormally low equivalent conductivity of very dilute solutions of acids is wholly due to the presence of carbon dioxide as an impurity in the water used as solvent .
The effect of saline impurities , too , of the type of potassium chloride , seems , incapable of explaining the phenomenon .
At the first opportunity further experiments will be undertaken to investigate the influence of possible slight traces of ammonia , and , if this proves insufficient to explain the phenomenon , to examine the question from other points of view .
