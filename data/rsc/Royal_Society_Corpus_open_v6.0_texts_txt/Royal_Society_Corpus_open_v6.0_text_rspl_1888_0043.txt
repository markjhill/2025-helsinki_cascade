" On Meldrum 's Rules for handling Ships in the Southern Indian Ocean .

) The results of this paper may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; The author examines critically certain rules given by Mr. Cg Meldrum for handling ships during hurricanes in the South Indian Ocean , by means both of published observations and from personal inspection of many unpublished records in the Observatory if Mauritius .
The result confirms the value of Mr. Meldrum 's rules , and the author then develops certain explanations , which have be\lt ; 5|| partially given by Meldrum , adds slightly to the rules for handlin0 1888.1 for handling Ships in the Southern Indian Ocean .
315 ships , and correlates the whole with the modem methods of meteorology .
# As an example , a hurricane is taken which blew near Mauritius on February 11 , 12 , and 13 , 1861 , and the history of every ship to which the rules might apply is minutely investigated .
The result , dividing Meldrum 's rules shortly into three parts , is as follows :\#151 ; Rule 1 .
Lie to with increasing south-east wind till the barometer has fallen 6-10ths of an inch .
Seven cases , rule right in every case .
Rule 2 .
Run to north-west when the barometer has fallen 6-10ths of an inch .
Three eases , two failures , one success .
Rule 3 .
Lie to with increasing north-east or east wind and a falling barometer .
Seven cases , rule right in every instance .
Rule 2 was exceptionally unfortunate in this case , as the path of the central vortex moved in a very uncommon and irregular manner .
At the same time , in any case , it appears to be about equally hazardous to follow this rule or to remain hove to .
The following statements are then examined in detail:\#151 ; The shape of all hurricanes is usually oval , not circular .
An elaborate examination is made of hurricanes on 60 different days , in 18 different tropieal cyclones in various parts of the world , with the following results .:\#151 ; 1 .
Out of 60 days , cyclones were apparently circular on only four occasions , and then the materials are very scanty , 2 .
The shape was oval on the remaining 56 days , but the ratio of the longer and shorter diameter of the ovals very rarely exceeded 2 to 1 .
3 .
The centres of the cyclones were usually displaced towards some one side .
No rule can be laid down for the direction of displacement , and in fact the direction varies during the progress of the same cyclone .
The core of a hurricane is nearly as oval as any other portion .
4 .
The longer diameter of the ovals may lie at any angle with reference to the path of the cyclone ; but a considerable proportion lie nearly in the same line as the direction of the path .
5 .
The association of wind with the oval form is such that the direction of the wind is usually more or less along the isobars , and more or less incurved .
This is the almost invariable relation of wind to isobars all over the world .
From an examination of the whole it is proved conclusively that no rule is possible for determining more than approximately the position of the central vortex of a cyclone by any observations at a single station .
The relation of a hurricane to the south-east trade is then discussed , and it is shown that there is always what may becalled " a belt of intensified trade wind " on the southern side of a cyclone , while the hurricane is moving westwards .
In this belt a ship experiences increasing south-east winds and squalls of rain , with a falling barometer , but is not VOL. XLIV .

[ June 14 .within the true storm field .
The difficulties and uncertainties as to handling a ship in this belt are greatly increased by the facts that the longer diameter of the oval form of the cyclones usually lies east and west , and that there is no means of telling towards which side of the oval the vortex is displaced .
The greater incurvature of the wind in rear than in front of hurricanes in the Southern Indian Ocean is next considered , and then facts are collected from other hurricane countries confirmatory of Meldrum 's rules for the Mauritius .
Knipping and Doberck in the China Seas find little incurvature of the wind in front , but much in rear of typhoons .
Mr. Wilson finds in the Bay of Bengal that nOrth-east winds prevail over many degrees of longitude to the north , .
, in front of a cyclone ; and this is analogous to the belt of intensified trade so characteristic of Mauritius hurricanes .
Padre Vinez finds at Havana that the incurvature of hurricane winds is very slight in front , and very great in rear .
The author then details further researches on the nature of cyclones , which bear on the rules for handling ships .
1 .
Indications derived from the form and motion of clouds .
It is shown that the direction of the lower clouds is usually more nearly eight points from the bearing of the vortex than the surface wind ; but as the direction varies with the height of the clouds , and as this height can only be estimated , this fact is not of much value .
2 .
Looking at the vertical succession of wind currents in the Southern Indian Ocean , if the march of the upper clouds over the south-east trade is more from the east , then the cyclone will pass to the north of the observer ; but if the upper clouds move more from the south than the surface wind , then the hurricane will pass to the south of the observer .
3 .
As to the form and position of clouds ; so soon as the upper regions commence to be covered , the direction in which the cirrus veil is densest gives approximately the bearing of the vortex .
Later on , the characteristic cloud bank of t]jte hurricane appears , and the greatest and heaviest mass of the bank will appear sensibly in the direction of the vortex . .
The irregular motion of the centre of a cyclone is next discussed , and it is shown that the centre often twists and sways about , in some , cases even describing a small loop .
From all the facts relative to the nature of cyclones adduced m this paper it is shown that the attempts which have been made 1 .
To estimate the track of a cyclone by projection ; 2 .
To estimate the distance , of a ship from the vortex , either y taking into account the entire , absolute fall , or by noting the rate ^ fall , can lead to no useful result .

] Magnetic Properties of an Impure Nickel .
A series of revised rules for handling ships in hurricanes in any part of the world is given .
Comparing these rules with the older ones it will be remarked\#151 ; 1 .
That the rule for finding approximately the bearing of the vortex is slightly modified .
2 .
That the great rules of the " laying to " tacks remain unaltered .
3 .
That the greatest improvement is the recognition of the position and nature of the belt of intensified trade wind on the dangerous side of a hurricane , where a ship experiences increasing wind , without change of direction , and a falling barometer .
The old idea that such conditions show that a vessel is then necessarily exactly on the line of advance of a hurricane is erroneous .
She may , but she need not be ; and under no circumstances should she run till the barometer has fallen at least 6\#151 ; lOths of an inch .
4 .
There are certain rules which hold for all hurricanes ; but every district has a special series , due to its own local peculiarities .
Those for the Southern Indian Ocean are given in this paper .

] The sample of nickel on which these experiments were made was supposed to be fairly pure when the experiments began .
A subsequent analysis , however , showed its composition to be as follows :\#151 ; Nickel Cobalt Copper Iron 1*05 Carbon 117 Sulphur Phosphorus Loss ; .
n-ia 100-00 The experiments comprise determinations of the curve of magnetisation at various temperatures , the magnetising force being increased , that is to say , they are confined to a determination of the ascending curve of magnetisation .
The temperature was always produced by enclosing the object to be tested in a double copper casing with an air space between the two shells of the casing , and by heating the casing from without by a bunsen burner .
The temperature was measured by determining the electrical resistance of a coil of copper wire .
The copper was first roughly tested to ascertain that its 2 b 2
