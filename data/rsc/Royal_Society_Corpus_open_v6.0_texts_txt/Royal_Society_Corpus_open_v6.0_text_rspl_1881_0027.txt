The following investigation was commenced at the suggestion , and indeed in conjunction with , Mr. Lockyer .
Other work , however , prevented his continuing with me this research , but I am much indebted to him not only for instruction in methods of spectroscopic observation , but also for important suggestions and much aid in the course of the work .
The more immediate object of the investigation was to examine carefully and systematically the absorption spectra produced by certain coloured liquids and solids , in order to identify the spectra with the substances producing them .
If this , be fully done , a powerful means has been obtained for investigating the changes , be they either chemical or physical , which occur more especially in cases of solution .
Of all coloured substances the cobalt salts seemed most suitable for commencing the investigation with , as they give well marked band spectra , and are salts well known and easily obtained .
The following observations were made with a Dasaga 's spectroscope having a single heavy glass prism , and , as a rule , it did not seem advisable to use higher dispersive power .
The positions of the bands are given in wave-lengths of millionths of a metre , obtained from the observations by graphical interpolation .
Cobalt chloride was the salt first examined ; the absorption spectra produced by it when pure and dry were carefully ascertained , and then the changes occurring in the spectrum when it was acted on by water and by other substances .
First , with regard to the pure cobalt chloride ( C0CI2 ) .
A specimen of the pure salt was fused out of contact with the air in a glass tube .
Another specimen of this salt was obtained by dissolving pure cobalt in hydrochloric acid , fusing it in an atmosphere of that gas , and sealing it np in a glass tube to exclude moisture .
Fig. 1 represents the absorption spectrum which was obtained in both cases .
When in place of pure the commercial salt was used , when the salt was formed by the action of chlorine on the metal , when the ordinary hydrated cobalt chloride was dried and fused On the Absorption Spectra of Cobalt Salts .
259 hzzxsrs\amp ; z chloride when in a fused state .
The chloride fuses at so hrgh a tern-perature that the glass becomes red hot , and it has consequently not been found possible to observe the absorption spectrum of the chloride when in a liqnid state .
# .
, .1 One point further : this spectrum is not in any way due to the action of the fused chloride on the glass tube , for water entirely dissolves the salt , leaving the glass colourless .
Whether in fig. 1 both hands are due to the same substance , and whether the small absorption at the red end of the spectrum is accidental or not , cannot be discussed at present .
If bromide of cobalt be treated in a like manner to the chloride , 1 yields a very interesting spectrum ( shown in fig. 2 ) , for on comparing it with the chloride spectrum a strong similarity between them is at once seen ; but the bands of the bromide corresponding to those of the chloride have approached the red end of the spectrum , the most refrangible band more than the other one .
Owing to the opacity and the ease with which the iodide of cobalt decomposes , its absorption spectrum cannot be obtained in the same way .
The strong power which the cobalt chloride has of combining with water , and the change of colour and of spectrum which it undergoes , is well known .
The alteration thus brought about m the absorption spectrum will be discussed further on ; but it should here be stated that simply on drying the moist chloride without fusing it , a spectrum is obtainable similar to that from the fused salt .
The dehydration of the ordinary crystallised chloride can be effected even at a comparatively low temperature ; if the heat be continued for a considerable length of time , a temperature of 150 ' if continued for 4^ hours renders the salt dry .
It is not easy to see the absorption spectrum of the powder thus formed ; the plan found to answer best is to have the salt in a fine state of division , suspend it in melted paraffin , and then when cold cut slices of the paraffin of proper thickness .
Assuming , then , that the above is the true spectrum of the solid cobalt chloride , the next point was to study spectroscopically the changes it underwent when acted on by different substances , or even when merely its physical state was altered .
The action of water on the chloride is complicated , and it is better to consider first the simpler case of the chloride fused with potassic chloride .
When these two substances are mixed , especially if mixed in atomic proportions , the whole mass fuses at a considerably lower temperature than either salt alone ; it forms a greenish-blue mass , and even when fused for some length of time in air it undergoes no Dr. W. J. Russell .
On the Absorption Spectra Cobalt Salts .
decomposition .
On examining this fused mixture it is found to give absorption spectrum ( shown at fig. 3 ) quite different from that .ven by the chloride alone .
On varying the proportions of the two Silts even taking as much as twenty molecules of the potassium salt to one of the cobalt salt , still the spectrum remains the same ; in fact , if only a trace of the fused or hydrated cobalt chloride be added to potassium chloride , the fused mass gives this same spectrum .
On increasing the thickness of the layer of salt examined or the amount of cobalt present in a layer of constant thickness , the absorption extends between the bands , and quickly reaches 600 .
Now , when the absorption has reached thus far , a faint band from 540 to 53o becomes visible , a band agreeing in position and character with the one produced by the pure chloride ; increase the absorption still more , both sides close in , leaving only a band of light from 580 to 550 .
On making a similar experiment with the bromide of cobalt , fusing it with potassium bromide , an absorption spectrum is obtained ( given at fig. 4 ) , and if the iodide of cobalt and potassium iodide be fused together , a spectrum ( shown at fig. 5 ) is obtained ; the first two spectra are strikingly alike .
In the above order the absorption bands are nearer and nearer to the red end of the spectrum , and only one band of the iodide is clearly visible , still one cannot but suspect the existence of the others , although not visible .
With a considerable thickness of the bromide a band from 573 to 558 is very visible , the analogy of the 532 band in the chloride .
Fluoride of cobalt ( for a specimen of which I have to thank Dr. Gore ) , neither alone nor with potassium fluoride , gave any visible absorption bands .
In place of potassium chloride , sodium chloride , ammonium chloride , zinc chloride were used ; they all , when cold , gave the same absorption spectrum , but with this peculiarity , that the exact position of the two bands between about 600 and 625 varied with each salt to a small extent .
With the potassium chloride the bands were nearest to the red , and with the zinc chloride nearest to the blue .
The distance between these two bands appears to remain nearly if not quite constant .
With regard to the absorption which extends from 650 to 700 , if only a thin layer of the salt be used , it will be clearly seen that it is resolvable into a dark band from 696 to 675 , and a fainter band at 656 ( figs. 3 and 6 ) .
The action of heat on these bodies is curious and interesting , the absorption at the red end of the spectrum is intensified , the bands disappear in a mass of dark absorption , and with regard to the two bands in the orange they gradually merge , into a single band ; and on still further increasing the heat ( but at a temperature still considerably below the fusing point of the mixture ) the band at 625 disappears , and there is a broad band beginning sharply about 620 , and extending nearly up to 600 .
On cooling , precisely the same changes are gone through in reverse order .
On reDr .
W. J. Russell .
peating the experiments over and over again , and continuing the heating for a long time , there is always the same result , the return on cooling to the original spectrum .
From the change in the fusing point of the mixture , from the permanence of the cobalt chloride when the mixture is fused in the air and from the change of colour , it seems natural to conclude that chemical combination takes place between the chlorides , and that the new spectrum pertains to the double chloride then formed .
Experiments , to be described further on , will show , however , that this supposition is not correct ; for this spectrum ( fig. 3 ) is easily obtainable without the presence of any alkaline chloride , and that it is produced in fact , in all cases when the cobalt chloride dissolves in any menstruum ' without chemically combining with it , to form a new and definite compound .
At ordinary temperatures then , at all events , the two chlorides in the above mixture are not chemically combined , but the cobalt salt is simply dissolved in the potassium or other chloride .
If these mixtures be dissolved in water , on evaporation the two salts separate out perfectly distinct , the potassium chloride often even without colour .
Zinc chloride gives a different reaction from the alkaline chlorides , for when mixed in certain proportions this spectrum is no longer visible .
On evaporating an aqueous solution of these two salts , a new compound , a double salt having the composition CoCloZnCl2 + 6H20 , crystallises out .
This double salt produces no visible banded spectrum , consequently as long as sufficient zinc chloride is present to combine with the cobalt chloride , no spectrum is visible ; but when even a trace of cobalt beyond this amount is present the banded spectrum ( fig. 3 ) is visible .
Some interesting applications of these changes have been made and will form a separate communication .
The visible spectroscopic changes which occur when these mixed chlorides are heated , are as above described , viz. , a new spectrum is produced , as if chemical combination occurred , and on cooling the return of original spectrum .
This seems to indicate that the action of heat is to produce change of a physical rather than of a chemical nature ; that a dissociation of a cobalt salt into a simpler molecular form occurred rather than the formation of a new chemical compound , which always decomposed as the temperature fell .
With zinc chloride , however , the action of heat is different and easily explainable , for a mixture of cobalt and zinc chlorides , which at ordinary temperature gives no bands , on being heated shows very clearly this same band spectrum of cobalt chloride .
In this case heat breaks up the double salts existing at ordinary temperatures , and gives the spectrum of the free chloride .
If calcium chloride be used in place of potassium chloride , then a much higher temperature is required to fuse the mixture , and it is far more opaque and difficult to examine .
There On the Absorption Spectra of Cobalt Salts .
268 L however , this point of interest about it , that it gives the spectrum ot the simple fused chloride ; this may arise either from some dry 'hloride having escaped the action of the calcium chloride , or what seems more probable , that it arises from the action of the high tern-.berature on the cobalt .
f TlLere are a few liquids which appear to dissolve the anhydrous [ bobalt chloride without combining with it , and it was of much interest to see what spectra they would give .
The liquids ex-perimented with were hydrochloric acid , methylic , ethylic , and amylic alcohols , the saline ethers , amylene , glycerine , and glacial ijtacetic acid .
_ .
First , with regard to the action of the ordinary strong hydrochloric acid .
As is well known , cobalt chloride dissolves readily in this acid , yielding an intensely blue solution .
The spectrum which this liquid gives is shown at fig. 6 , and it will at once be seen to be similar to the spectrum obtained from the fused chloride ( fig. 3 ) , the two bands in the orange now being a little nearer the blue .
The similarity of these two spectra is remarkably complete , for on increasing gradually the thickness of the solution the bands in the red are gradually hidden , and when the absorption has crept up to 600 , then a band at 540 to 525 becomes visible .
The spectrum is remarkable for its permanence , if the solution be either weak or strong , hot or cold , the spectrum remains unchanged .
This agrees with what one would naturally expect , that , under these circumstances , the cobalt remains as chloride .
Moreover , from the similarity of this spectrum with that obtained with the fused chlorides , the inevitable conclusion is that the cobalt is in the same state in both cases .
_ This spectrum of cobalt chloride is very characteristic in its I appearance and very easily produced ; without special care and with a common spectroscope " 0005 grin , of cobalt chloride can easily be s detected , and even the presence of other coloured chlorides does not interfere with it j for instance , even the presence of iron , nickel , j ' chromium , manganese , does not hide the characteristic appearance produced even by the above small amount of cobalt chloride .
Supposing the 532 band be produced by a specific compound , it j seemed likely that at least a rough estimate of the amount of that body , present under different circumstances , might be judged , by i bringing always the absorption in the red up to the same point and | comparing then the intensity of this 532 band ; practically , however , !
this did not lead to results of any value .
It is , however , important to note that the spectrum of the fused I chloride is never seen without the 532 band ; and that in the other two cases already described , this band is only visible when a considerable amount of the cobalt salt is present .
It seemed , therefore , VOL. XXXII .
T Dr. W. J. Russell .
possible that since the amount of the 532 producing body appeared judging very roughly by the eye to diminish on dissolving the solid chloride in hydrochloric acid , that in an excessively dilute hydro-chloric acid solution this substance might be destroyed and the band have disappeared .
Experiments , however , did not confirm this , for when a solution so dilute that it required 6 feet of the liquid to bring the absorption up to 600 , the 532 band was just as visible as in a strong solution .
To sum up ; with regard to this spectrum it is remarkably persistent ; strengthen the solution or increase the length of the column looked through , or raise the temperature of a dilute solution , and the effect is the same ; first , the shaded part up nearly to 650 becomes uniformly dark , then the absorption closes in as far as the 610 band , and the absorption creeps on up to 600 ; immediately after reaching this point the 532 band becomes visible .
Still further increase the absorption and a shadow is seen extending from the 532 band towards the red to 560 .
And lastly , with the strongest solution that can be looked through , there is still discernible a broad black band from 550 to 520 , and the absorption from the red end reaches now to 565 , and it is remarkable that in the ultra-red , where at first there was complete absorption , now light is transmitted .
At the blue end considerable absorption occurs , no light being visible beyond 480 .
Ethylic , methylic , and amylic alcohols , the saline ethers , and glycerine all dissolve cobalt chloride freely , and on being saturated with anhydrous chloride of cobalt give this same spectrum ( fig. 3 ) .
These liquids must , of course , be free from water , or the true spectra are complicated by the spectra of the hydrates .
When ordinary alcohol is the solvent , a very large amount of the chloride is taken up and a mere film of the liquid on a microscopic slide is quite sufficient to give clearly the characteristic spectrum ( fig. 3 ) .
With amylic or methylic alcohol no appreciable alteration in the position of the bands takes place ; but , with glycerine , both the bands have moved slightly towards the red .
That solvents so different as the above should all give the same spectrum with the cobalt chloride seems only to be explainable on the view that the spectrum so formed is that of the chloride itself , and not that of any new combination , in fact , that the solvent has so far altered the molecular structure of this salt that in place of its giving the spectrum ( fig. 1 ) which it does when alone and solid , it gives this second spectrum ( fig. 3 ) ; and further , it seems , whether the chloride be in the liquid or solid state , whether dissolved in alcohol or in a solid alkaline chloride , the spectrum is practically the same . .
Although not probable , at the same time it seemed possible , that the identity of these different spectra might be due to a trace of water in On the Absorption Spectra of Cobalt Salts .
each of the solvents , and that this banded spectrum was really that of a hydrate , and not of the chloride .
To settle this point the following experiments were carefully carried out : Some of the mixed chloride of cobalt and potassium was dried and fused in a glass tube in a slow current of very thoroughly-dried carbon dioxide , in the first instance for twenty minutes ; it was then allowed to cool and was spectroscopically examined , and found to be quite unchanged ; again the heating and the slow passage of dry gas was continued for forty minutes , and afterwards for two hours , but in no case was the least change apparent , the spectrum-giving substance .was evidently as abundant after all the heating as before , and no trace of any other spectrum was visible .
The experiment was also made of fusing separately in different parts of same tube , filled with dry carbon dioxide , the cobalt chloride , and potassium chloride , and , after they had been in a state of fusion for some time , allowing them partially to mix , and sealing up the tube ; where the two had come into contact this spectrum was visible and nowhere else .
The hydrochloric acid solution of the cobalt chloride in one respect , however , is different from any of the other solutions , for , as before mentioned , only one spectrum is obtainable from it , whereas with the other solvents , the spectrum varies with the amount of chloride in the solution .
Thus a very dilute alcoholic solution gives a spectrum ( fig. 7 ) evidently different from the former one given by the saturated solution .
To obtain clearly this second spectrum dry alcohol must be used , and should contain about 0'008 grm. of cobalt chloride in 100 cub. centims. of the alcohol ; this amount of the cobalt salt gives only a faint purple colour to the alcohol , and requires a solution of about 2d ?
inches in depth to show the spectrum .
If the strength of the solution be gradually increased so that it becomes of a strong blue colour , and contains about 20 grms. of the chloride in 100 cub. centims. of alcohol , and requiring for observation only about one-eighth of an inch thickness of the solution , a third spectrum ( fig. 8 ) is obtained .
This , however , appears in part to be a compound spectrum , formed by the presence in the solution of the bodies which produce the former spectra .
Indications of two bands , 610 and 625 , for instance , are visible , but what is characteristic of this spectrum , and does not occur when the solution is very strong or very weak , is the band at 585 .
In ordei to determine whether any other changes would occur when the solution was still more dilute , some of it requiring a depth of 2 inches to show the spectrum was diluted to such an extent that 6 feet of the liquid was required .
This great dilution produced no change whatever , in the spectrum .
Other liquids , such as dry amylic alcohol or amylic acetate , which readily dissolve cobalt chloride , give spectra corresponding to those given by ethylic alcohol .
With methylic alcohol , however , the first or most dilute stage was not obtained , but this T 2 Dr. W. J. Russell .
evidently arose from a trace of water adhering most persistently t the alcohol .
If liquids be used in which the cobalt chloride is not so soluble , dry acetic acid for instance , it will be found that only two spectra are produceable , corresponding to those in the more dilute alcoholic solutions ; and with a liquid in which the cobalt chloride is still less soluble , such as dry ether , there is only one spectrum obtainable .
And lastly , with such a liquid as tetrachloride of carbon or benzol , in which the cobalt chloride is absolutely insoluble , the spectrum , which is faintly visible when the liquid and the salt , in a fine state of division , are shaken up together , is that of the pure fused chloride .
The action of heat on these solutions is two-fold : first , it increases the amount of colour ; this arises , no doubt , to a considerable extent , if not altogether , from an absolute increase of the amount of anhydrous cobalt chloride present , for if a mere trace of water be present , on adding the blue cobalt salt the first action is for it to combine with the water , and to produce a pink and comparatively colourless solution ; this hydrate , as will be shown further on , is decomposed on rise of temperature , giving the blue chloride .
The second action of heat is to transform the saturated solution spectrum or third stage , into* the intermediate or second stage , and the intermediate one into the first\#151 ; the one given by most dilute solutions .
Again , in the spectrum of the third stage , the 532 band is visible , but with the alcoholic solution the absorption has to extend nearer to the blue to about 575 instead of only 600 , as with the hydrochloric acid solution , before this band becomes visible .
This seems to indicate that less of the body producing it is present in the alcoholic than in the hydrochloric acid solution .
When water is the solvent for the cobalt chloride , the phenomenon is somewhat more complicated , as direct combination occurs and hydrates are formed .
The eolour of the dilute solution , as is well known , is pink .
If this be examined with the spectroscope no sharp bands are visible ; there is , however , very considerable absorption at the blue end of the spectrum , but with certain concentration and depth of solution , it is easy to distinguish a wide absorption band extending from 550 to 485 ( fig. 16 ) , and beyond this blue rays are comparatively freely transmitted .
This band , however , is never sharply defined , but shades off on both sides ; it undoubtedly belongs to certain hydrates of the cobalt chloride .
To study the formation of these hydrates , solutions containing different amounts of cobalt chloride were prepared and tested as follows : first , a solution containing only 0'1 grm. of cobalt chloride in 100 cub. centims. of water was made , and the spectrum it gave was compared with that of a solution containing 100 times as much cobalt chloride .
These solutions were found to give identical spectra .
Again , 15 inches of a 2^ per cent , solution gave the same spectra as 4^ inches On the Absorption Spectra of Cobalt Salts .
267 )f the 10 per cent , solution , and 16 inches of 1 per cent , solution was .ompared to inch of 10 per cent , solution .
So that in all these lilute solutions , as far as the spectroscope can tell us , there are the * am compounds present .
With stronger solutions this is not the case ; L. if the solution contains , say , from 20 to 30 grms. in 100 cub. Untims .
of water , and a thin layer of it be compared with a thick were of a more dilute solution , the spectra will be seen to be essentially different .
This new spectrum , which proves to be a very interesting one , is best seen when a saturated or nearly saturated solution of cobalt chloride is used ( 100 cub. eentims .
at 16 ' dissolve 32 grms. of cobalt chloride ) , then there are two bands\#151 ; one at 625 and the other at 610\#151 ; and an absorption stopping sharply at 652 .
Evidently we have again the spectrum of the dissolved cobalt chloride , a spectrum which has already been shown to be perfectly independent of water , consequently it appears that the anhydrous cobalt chloride is capable of existing in an aqueous solution .
If a solution saturated at ordinary temperatures with the chloride of , cobalt be diluted with half its volume of water , the bands at 625 and i 610 disappear ; but if to this solution , or even to one more dilute , any substance be added capable of combining with water , such as sulphuric acid , calcium chloride , or even ammonium or sodium chloride , the bands at 625 and 610 again appear .
Heat acts on these dilute solutions in the same kind of way .
If , for instance , this saturated solution , diluted with half its bulk of water , be heated up gradually at 49 ' , the 625 band first becomes visible , and then the 610 band .
As the temperature increases the absorption in the green diminishes , and at the boiling point you have a spectrum very similar to that obtained by fusing together chloride of cobalt and chloride of potassium .
^ The reverse action also occurs .
A solution giving strongly the bands at ordinary temperature ceases to show them when cooled .
In both cases as the solution returns to its original temperature so does the original spectroscopic appearande return .
In many cases the | spectroscopic variations by temperature are very delicate and very striking in appearance .
Any change tending to break up the hydrates seems always to diminish the amount of absorption taking place towards the blue end of the spectrum .
The well known change of colour of strong cobalt solution on heating bears this out .
Pass hydrochloric acid gas , for instance , into a dilute cobalt solution , and the gradual formation , and the chloride spectrum and disappearance of the absorption in the green and blue , is well shown .
In proportion as one compound , the hydrate , ceases to exist , so the other , the anhydrous compound , is apparently produced .
The ordinary crystals of chloride of cobalt contain six molecules of water , and they give a spectrum shown at fig. 9 .
There are certain cases in which the Dr. W. J. Russell .
hydrated crystals and their aqueous solutions give similar spectra ; but with cobalt chloride this is not the case , the hydrate is not the ' one existing in the solution .
The readiness with which the pink crystals of the hydrated chloride become blue arises from the ease with which it parts with water , the blue compound in all cases giving the spectrum of the anhydrous chloride .
There is another band which is generally visible in moderately strong aqueous solutions at 653 to 638 , and is often well seen with a depth of about 3 inches of a 10 per cent , solution .
This band , which , from its origin and its constant occurrence appeared to belong to all the cobalt salts , is really due to the presence of nickel .
Cobalt salts which have been carefully purified do not give this band , even when very strong solutions are used .
The oxide of cobalt is spectroscopically an interesting body .
It gives , as is well known , a very characteristic spectrum ( fig. 10 ) .
This is readily obtained by examining the precipitate formed on adding an excess of caustic potash or soda to a solution of any cobalt salt .
This blue precipitate ( which is said to be a basic oxide ) rapidly loses its colour , and the spectrum disappears .
The spectrum consists of two very strongly marked bands , one about 665 to 638 , and the other from 600 to 585 .
These are very characteristic of the oxide , for on increasing the thickness of absorbing layer , these bands always join together , forming thus a single band , before they increase in other directions .
Besides these two bands , when the oxide is precipitated by potash or soda , there is always an absorption at the blue end , beginning at about 550 , and having very much the appearance of a band , but rendered somewhat indistinct by the general absorption taking place in the blue .
At the red end of the spectrum the absorption ends at about 675 .
If ammonia be used as the precipitant in place of potash or soda , then there is clearly no band in this part of the spectrum and no absorption at 540 ( fig. 11 ) .
This difference between the two spectra seems clear and definite , and is of much interest , and the obvious deduction is that the two bands at 640 and 585 are produced by the oxide , and that the absorption at 540 is produced by a compound of oxide and potash or soda .
Vogel has pointed out the similarity existing between the spectrum of the precipitated oxide and that given by ordinary cobalt glass .
The spectrum of the glass is seen at fig. 10a , and it will at once be seen how nearly this spectrum agrees with that of the oxide precipitated by potash or soda ; the two bands are of the same character as before and very nearly in the same position , but apparently a little nearer to the red , and now clearly a third band from 550 to 525 is visible .
The conclusion seems inevitable that the oxide and potash compound which exist in the precipitated oxide exist also in the blue glass .
Again , these same spectra can be obtained by another process , and it is easy On the Absorption Spectra of Cobalt Salts .
269 I to prepare a blue liquid which gives an absorption spectrum identical with that produced by a piece of blue glass . .
Winkler showed some years ago that when finely divided metallic , cobalt oxide of cobalt , or a salt of cobalt was boiled with caustic potash , a blue solution was formed , which he attempted to show con- !
tained cobaltate of potash .
To the acid forming oxide he at first gave the formula Co05 , and afterwards that of Co03 .
Schultze , however , immediately repeated Winkler 's experiments and came to the conclusion that instead of its being a solution of cobaltate of potash , it was merely an alkaline solution of cobaltic hydrate .
The absorption spectrum seems clearly to show that the blue liquid is not a new cobaltic salt , but that it contains essentially oxide of cobalt in solution and the same potash or soda compound as exists both in the glass and in the precipitated oxide .
Again , it may further be deduced from the similarity of these spectra that the blue precipitate is not a hydrate , for it gives the same spectrum as exists in the glass , or at all events the water can only be so feebly combined with the oxide as not to alter the individuality of the compound .
Again , if oxide , or , in fact , any ordinary salt of cobalt , be dissolved by fusion in borax , a glass which gives the same spectrum as ordinary blue glass is obtained .
The positions of the bands , however , are apparently intermediate in position between those in the glass and those in the precipitated oxide ; these differences are , however , very small .
The blue oxide of cobalt can be made to undergo another change which is of much interest .
If a solution of cobalt chloride be precipitated by caustic alkali , taking care to keep the cobalt chloride in excess , thus on well agitating the precipitate and solution together , or even on slightly boiling them , the precipitate will be found to be of a green colour , and to contain , as an integral part , cobalt chloride .
Evidently an oxychloride has been formed .
Eig .
12 gives the spectrum produced in this way ; it is a mixed spectrum of oxychloride and of oxide .
The same body may also be obtained if the blue oxide be first prepared , drained rapidly and washed and then shaken up in a solution of the chloride .
The stronger the solution used the more chloride attaches itself to the oxide , and apparently one or more oxychlorides are formed .
If any other salt than the chloride or bromide and probably the iodide of cobalt , be used and precipitated by a small amount of caustic alkali , no salt corresponding to this oxychloride is formed , but the oxide is at once thrown down .
This green substance is but very slightly decomposed by cold water and not at all by alcohol .
A sample of washed blue oxide was divided into , three portions : one was shaken up with a very dilute solution of cobalt chloride , another with a solution made by adding 3 cub. centims. of a saturated solution of chloride to 50 cub. centims. of water , and the third portion with a saturated solution of the chloride ; the green com- Dr. W. J. Russell .
pound formed in each case was dried out of contact with air , and the chlorine it contained determined ; the first one contained chlorine corresponding to 4 85 per cent , of cobalt chloride , the second with 10*94 per cent. , and the last with 28*02 per cent , of the cobalt chloride .
The compound having the formula 4CoOCoCl3 , would contain 30*40 of cobalt chloride .
Such are chemically the changes which occur .
Spectroscopically , the changes which the oxide undergoes are shown at figs. 13 , 14 , and 15 .
Mg .
10 being the spectrum of the original blue precipitate .
These changes are , first , the fading of the band at 590 , and then the disappearance of all absorption on the less refrangible side of 590 and ultimately the formation of a dark and well-defined band from 674 to 665 , the faint band from 600 to 596 remaining .
This change has much the appearance of a division of this oxide band into two bands of which the most refrangible part from 590 to 580 remains , and the less refrangible part from 590 to 600 disappears .
It seemed possible that with a spectroscope of greater dispersive power to separate the 690 band in the oxide into these two bands , but on trial this did not take place .
This spectrum , fig. 14 , of the oxychloride , is in many respects similar to the spectrum of second stage of the chloride in alcohol , although certainly not identical with it , but in both cases the chloride appears to be modified somewhat in the same way .
That it is not an oxychloride which is formed in the alcohol solution , seems proved by the fact that as previously pointed out , this spectrum is formed by dissolving the chloride in acetic acid .
Warm water decomposes this green compound , washing out the cobalt chloride .
This decomposition is very clearly shown in the absorption spectrum , if , for instance , some of the green compound be prepared by precipitation as before described , and a little of it be placed on a microscope slide under a covering glass , it gives very distinctly the spectrum shown at fig. 13 .
Now wash the precipitate on a filter with warm water , and then , on taking another sample of it , the two bands at 647 and 592 will be distinctly visible , that is , there is evidently now oxide present .
This oxychloride of cobalt may also be formed in small quantities by digesting the precipitated oxide in a solution either , of nickel or potassium , or other chlorides , for on examining the oxide thus treated , the change of the absorption spectrum is distinctly visible .
The bromide of cobalt appears to react with the oxide in the same way as the chloride .
Generally the soluble cobalt salts of the oxygen acids do not give band spectra , but only a broad absorption shading off on both sides and extending from about 550 to 480 ( fig. 16 ) , and a considerable amount of general absorption at the blue end of the spectrum ; for On the A bsorption Spectra of Cobalt Salts .
instance the sulphate , nitrate , and acetate all act m this manner .
An interesting reaction is visible with the cobalt carbonate .
It is stated in works on chemistry that on adding sodic or potassic carbonate to a cobaltous solution it is not the normal carbonate , but a mixture of the carbonate and hydrated cobaltous oxide , that is formed* If now this precipitation be made in front of the spectroscope , the changes which V on are perfectly visible .
On the addition of the alkaline carbonate a precipitate forms which gives no bands , but after a very short time , perhaps half a minute or less , the bands of the oxide become distinctly visible ; apparently then it is a pure carbonate which is thrown down , but that it rapidly , by the action of the water , undergoes decomposition , and oxide is formed .
Under special conditions , however , some of the oxygen salts may be made to give band spectra , for instance , on fusing chloride , oxide , or phosphate of cobalt with microcosmic salt and allowing it to cool , a pink-coloured glass is obtained , which gives a spectrum consisting of bands with much general absorption .
Since all three of these cobalt compounds give under these circumstances the same spectrum , it apparently leaves little doubt that it is the spectrum of a phosphate of cobalt .
If this pink bead be heated , it undergoes an interesting change , the absorption in the blue entirely disappears , and you get a spectrum identical with that of the oxide ; for instance , that of an ordinary borax or glass bead ( fig. 10 ) .
As this phosphate glass cools it again becomes pink , and the banded spectrum returns ; evidently the phosphate is dissociated , recombination taking place as the temperature falls .
When sodic phosphate is added to a cobaltous solution , a precipitate is formed which is soluble in excess of the cobalt salt ; on continuing the addition of the phosphate , first a permanent pink precipitate is obtained , and afterwards when the phosphate is in excess the precipitate is of a blue colour .
If the cobalt salt be added to the disodic phosphate , the blue precipitate forms at once .
Now , on examining this blue precipitate spectroscopically , it is at once evident that oxide of cobalt must be present , for there is exactly the same spectrum as is given by the precipitate formed on adding caustic alkali to a solution of cobalt .
The pink precipitate gives a faint band about 590 , but the bands seen in the fused phosphate were not visible in the precipitate .
The foregoing account of these different spectra is bnt very imperfect ; many most interesting questions with regard to the nature and meaning of the spectra have to he left for the present unsolved foi want of sufficient data .
Further experiments with other compounds are required , and above all it would be of the highest interest to investigate fully the parts of the spectrum not visible to the eye ; * Miller 's " Chemistry , " p. 536 .

evidently with the cobalt salts many , and it may be the most important bands lie in the ultra-red .
All the above spectra and many more have been drawn from direct and repeated observations , but obviously it is not intended to claim any originality for them ; many have been described before .
My best thanks are due to my assistant , Mr. W. Lapraik , for the help he has given me in carrying out these investigations , which have extended over a considerable length of time .

] Of late years our knowledge concerning the form and structure of the placenta , as well as of the arrangement of the foetal membranes in various species of mammals has been much extended through the researches of Milne-Edwards , Ercolani , Turner , and others .
The observations of these anatomists have not been confined to the placentation of any one group , but extend to that of species belonging to every Mammalian order .
Among these orders that of the Carnivora has received a not inconsiderable share of attention , not only from the observers just named , but also from those among whom may be mentioned the names of Daubenton , Von Baer , Bischoff , and others who appeared earlier in the field .
Among the members of the fissiped group of Carnivora , the placenta or foetal membranes , or both , have been described in the marten ( , * stone marten ( Mustela foina ) , f pine marten ( f weasel ( Mustela vulgaris ) , S ferret ( Mustela fur o ) , \\ bitch ( Cards familiar is ) , ^ fox ( Ganis vulpes ) , **cat ( Felisdlioness ( leo ) , \X hyaena ( sp. ?
