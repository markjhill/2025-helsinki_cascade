I. Magnetic Observations .
The magnetographs have worked satisfactorily all through since last report .
The curves obtained , representing Declination , Horizontal Force , and Vertical Force , have shown a marked increased activity in terrestrial magnetic changes as compared with the preceding year , although no very large disturbances have been registered .
The principal movements occurred on the following dates , viz. March 2\#151 ; 3 , and 31 , April 8 and 12 , May 14 , 15 , and 16 , Jane H September 9 12 , October 24 , November 20\#151 ; 21 , and December 7 .
Report of the Kew Committee .
In accordance with the usual practice , determinations of the scale values of all the instruments were made in January last , and the ordinates for the different photographic curves were then found to be as follows:\#151 ; .

Additional observations of the Horizontal Force , Inclination , and Declination have been made each month with the absolute instru- ments for the purpose of determining with greater precision the zero values of the magnetograph curves .
Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various data have been supplied to Professors Thorpe and Rucker , Dr. Yan Rijckevorsel , Captain Schiick , and Professor Stroud .
In January the Kew 9-inch unifilar , by Jones , was sent to Messrs. Elliot Brothers for cleaning , and , at the same time , certain alterations were introduced in order to modernise the instrument .
Unfortunately , the heavy brass telescope support was found on examination to be slightly magnetic , and it was therefore discarded , and , on February 12 , the magnetometer was restored to its original state , with the exception of a brass the-piece , which , being found non-magnetic , was retained until the end of the year .
On closely discussing the Declination observations of the preceding years it was found that observations given with the old collimator magnet N.E. were more subject to a variable torsion effect than were those of the collimator marked K.O. 90 .
The two having been em-i ployed in conjunction for one year , it was decided , with the com-( mencement of 1891 , to discard altogether the use of the old heavy ( i magnet for the purpose of observing Declination .

II .
Meteorological Observations .
The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra .
tion respectively of Atmospheric Pressure , Temperature , and Humidity^ Wind ( direction and velocity ) , Bright Sunshine , and Bain have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year , with the excep .
tion of the wet-bulb thermograph .
The readings of the last-named instrument during the winter of 1890-91 became irregular , and it was found to vary considerably from its accompanying standard .
It was accordingly decided to dismount the thermometer and to replace it by a new tube , which was done in July last .
On examination , the bulb showed the existence of a crack , which eventually extended completely around it .
The scale value of the new tube has been determined by means of nearly 300 comparative readings , and new glass and ivory tabulating scales for it have been constructed at the Meteorological Office .
For controlling these values , an experimental determination of the zero of the instrument was made by means of melting ice .
Experiments were made , unsuccessfully , to use a Richard pen with the Beckley rain gauge , but a BBB black-lead pencil was found to be more reliable in its indications than such a pen .
The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records have been duly registered .
The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly made , and these , as well as copies of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine , have been transmitted , as usual , to the Meteorological Office .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , data have been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the editor of ' Symons 's Monthly Meteorological Magazine , ' Dr. Rowland , and others .
Tables of the monthly values of the rainfall and temperature have been regularly sent to the Meteorological Sub-Committee of the Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club for publication in their Proceedings .
Detailed information of all thunderstorms observed in the neighbourhood during the year has been forwarded to the Royal Meteorological Society , soon after their occurrence .
Atmospheric Electricity.\#151 ; The electrograph has been maintained in action during the greater portion of the year .
The records were , however , lost for forty-eight days on account of the freezing of the water-jet during frost in winter .
The instrument has failed in sensibility during the last year owing to the large extent of diminution which the 60-cell chloride of silver battery has experienced in its charge , the potential of which h*8 apparently diminished by one-half .
Report of the Kew Committee .
This having been reported to the Meteorological Council , it was decided by them to request Professor J. J. Thomson to examine into the subject of the measurement of Atmospheric Electricity , and , meanwhile , to continue the instrument in action in its present condition .
III .
Solar Observations .
Sun-spots.\#151 ; Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 170 days , and | the groups numbered after Schwabe 's method .
Time Signals.\#151 ; These have been received from Greenwich through the G.P.O. with regularity since last report , with the following exceptions :\#151 ; On six occasions , viz. , March 10 ; May 30 ; August 18 , 19 , and 27 ; and September 11 , no signal was received either at 10 a.m. or 1 p.m. On January 14 and February 4 it arrived two seconds late , and on October 8 , 9 , and 10 it did not record itself on the chronograph , but was only observed by the galvanometer .
Transit Observation.\#151 ; Occasional solar and sidereal transits have been observed as checks upon the Greenwich signalled times .
Yiolle'sActinometer.\#151 ; The copies of the observations made during 1890 were duly forwarded to the Meteorological Office in January , and , as the Committee understand , have been handed over by that Office to Mr. H. F. Blanford , who will report on the subject to the Solar Physics Committee .
IV .
Experimental Work .
The Committee have had under trial on the roof of the Observatory two new forms of wind registering instruments , the anemo-cinemo-graph of MM .
Richard Freres , of Paris , and the sight-indicating velocity meter by Munro , of London .
The first-named instrument is an improved form of the old windmill vanes anemometer which was used by Smeaton after Rouse and Robins , but is best known as Whewell 's .
The anemo-cinemograph is similar to that which was employed on the top of the Eiffel Tower at Paris , and the vanes , by running constantly against a train of clock-v ork , record directly on a sheet of paper the velocity of motion of the wind at any time .
Continuous records were obtained for six months , and the result given would seem to show that the indications of the Kew Beckley anemograph are in excess of those given by the new instrument .
These are 20 per cent , less than those of the anemograph with winds blowing at 40 miles or upwards per hour , and 2 per cent , less with light winds which blow at from 6 to 10 miles 156 Report of the Kew Committee .
per hour .
A reduction of the Robinson factor from 3 to 2'5 would serve to render the readings of the two instruments more nearly comparable .
As the Richard instrument is designed to record the velocity of the wind in gusts as well as the total run during any definite interval , no detailed comparisons with the Robinson indications are possible ; but it may be noted that daring the period the einemograph Was under observation gusts of 45 and 43 miles per hour were recorded , whilst simultaneous curve readings of the Robinson gave hourly rates of 55 and 52 miles for quarter of an hour intervals .
The Munro sight-indicating anemometer is a sensitive Robinson cup arrangement , which drives by means of a small centrifugal pump a column of oil up a glass tube .
Its height above a fixed zero mark , as shown on a divided porcelain scale at the side , indicates the velocity of rotation of the cups when converted into miles per hour of wind movement .
The divisions of the scale have been laid down in accordance with Mr. Dines ' experimental deduction .
When the instrument was originally set up , it was found incapable of recording a velocity of more than 40 miles per hour , but , during a gale in November , velocities were attained during several gusts of over 70 miles per hour , and accordingly Mr. Munro has found it desirable to change the gearing of the pump so as to enable the higher values to be indicated .
The comparisons with the new gearing are not sufficient in number to furnish results suitable for quotation at the present time , but they appear to show , during gusts , rates fully 20 per cent , higher than the cinemograph gives .
The instrument as fitted at present fails to work during frost , owing to congelation of the oil employed .
Dr. E. Yan Rijckevorsel , of Rotterdam , visited the Observatory in July for the purpose of making simultaneous magnetic observations with the Kew , his own , and the Utrecht unifilar magnetometers , and of comparing the results with those he had recently made with the magnetometers in use at the Observatories at Parc St. Maur , Wilhelmshafen , and Utrecht .
Professor Rucker has also been investigating the differences found to exist in similar simultaneous readings of his three unifilars ; and his assistants , Messrs. Gray and 'Watson , have visited Kew on numerous occasions in order to make the necessary observations .
Cloud Photographs.\#151 ; The operations with the cloud cameras have been conducted during the past year solely according to the simplified method of zenith observation , as described in last year 's report , and results were obtained on 24 days .
A joint paper by General Strachey and the Superintendent , describing the plan of working , was read before the Royal Society in June , and was fully illustrated by photographs shown in the optical lantern .
A report , giving a detailed Report of the Kew Committee .
account of the year 's work , was forwarded to the Meteorological Council in November last ... ... ... ... Particulars , with specimens of cloud pictures , were also supplied to Mr Rotch , of the Blue Hill Observatory , for communication to the Committee of the International Meteorological Conference at Munich . .
, , .
, Experiments were also made with several new lenses kindly lent by Mr. Dallmeyer , in order to select one suitable for giving pictures covering a wider field of view than the R.R. lens hitherto employed , which confines the observer to clouds within 15 ' of the zenith .
The results of these experiments , as well as others with Eastman n films used instead of glass plates , have been communicated to the Meteorological Council .
In compliance with the request forwarded by Mr. Clayden , secretary to the British Association Committee on Meteorological Photography , for copies of photographs illustrating meteorological phenomena , or their effects , the Committee forwarded a selection of duplicate cloud and other photographs to be added to the collection which has been formed .

There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification .
9 Barometers , 452 Thermometers , 2 Hydrometers , 23 Sextants , and 15 Telescopes .
Sextant Testing.\#151 ; The apparatus , consisting of two Mawson and Report of the Kew Committee .
Swan 's glow lamps , lighted by electricity derived from one of Pitkin 's storage batteries , has been successfully employed in testing the dark shades of sextants , when requisite , during the past year .
It has been found necessary to replace the lamps in two instances ; but the initial charge of the battery has proved capable of working them throughout the whole twelvemonths without replenishing .
Telescope Testing.\#151 ; A second test plate has been procured , and mounted on a portable frame , with a reflector , in order to enable the examination of telescopes to be prosecuted from the optical room as well as from the lawn .
A detailed form of certificate has been prepared and issued with telescopes and binoculars examined for the general public .
6 Look-out telescopes have been examined and certified for the Brethren of the Trinity House .
Normal Thermometers.\#151 ; M. Benoit , the Director of the Conservatoire des Poids et Mesures , Paris , having completed his examination of the three standard thermometers , and submitted his report upon them to the Committee , who have placed it in the hands of Professor Rucker for discussion , proceeded to examine the low-range alcohol thermometer which accompanied them .
Whilst conducting this operation , M. Carpenter , the observer , was so unfortunate as to break the tube .
M. Benoit , having strongly advised that further comparisons at low temperatures should be made by means of thermometers filled with toluene instead of with alcohol , has been requested by the Committee to order such an instrument of M. Tonnelot , the maker , and compare it with the Sevres standards before its delivery in England .
The mercurial standards were safely returned to the custody of the Observatory by M. Carpenter in May last .
VI .
Rating of Watches .
During the fourteen months 709 entries of watches for rating were made .
They were sent for testing in the following classes:\#151 ; For class A , 468 ; class B , 153 ; and class C , 86 ; subsidiary trial , 2 Of these 161 failed to gain any award ; 49 passed with C , 140 with B , 327 with A certificates , and 29 of the latter obtained the highest , class A especially good .
In the Appendix will be found statements giving the results of trial of the 29 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks during the year , the highest position being attained by Messrs. Stauffer , Son , and Co. , London .
This watch was a keyless tourbillon chronometer , with going barrel , which obtained the very excellent total 91-6 of marks out of a possible 100 .
Marine Chronometers.\#151 ; Certificates showing the mean daily rate Report of the Kew Committee .
and the variations of rate at three different temperatures have been awarded to 18 marine chronometers after undergoing the 35 days ' trial .
The Committee having had their attention drawn to the limited nature of their trials for first-class marine chronometers , decided to establish a second and more rigorous trial for these instruments , and have now organised two classes , which are as follows : Class A trial , extending over 55 days , comprising runs at tempera-tures of 45 ' , 70 ' , 95 ' Faht .
; and Class B trials , which last for 35 days , and include readings at temperatures of 55 ' , 70 " , and 85 ' Faht .
only .
For Class A tests , the individual runs are 10 days at each temperature ; whilst for Class B tests , they are only 7 days each in duration .
The Committee have drawn up a special circular addressed to the directors of steamship companies , calling attention to rating chronometers , and have distributed it to the managers of all the principal companies of vessels sailing from British ports .
As the question of the rate of a chronometer under varying temperatures is intimately related to the behaviour of the lubricating material employed , when heated , the Committee asked Professor T. Thorpe , F.R.S. , to favour them with his opinion as to the temperature to which a chronometer may be subjected to without producing a deleterious effect upon its oil .
Non-Magnetic Watches.\#151 ; Owing to the extension of the use of electrical dynamometers , a class of watches provided with springs and balances of palladium or some alloy , and termed non-magnetic watches , has been brought into more general use ; and the Committee have been requested to certify as to the extent in which they may be employed in the vicinity of dynamos without deterioration of their time-keeping properties .
Professor Rucker kindly undertook to arrange to conduct a series of experiments with the dynamos at South Kensington , and two students of the Royal College of Science , Messrs. Edser and Stansfield , have already submitted a preliminary report to the Committee upon the nature and extent of the influence in the magnetic field in the neighbourhood of a dynamo .
The experiments are still in progress .
VII .
Miscellaneous .
Lens Testing .
In the preliminary operations necessary to conduct the satisfactory examination of photographic lenses , Major Jj .
Darwin , late R.E. , has been associated with Captain Abney , and , in accordance with his suggestions , a special camera , capable of working with lenses of 4 inches aperture and 30 inches focal length , has been constructed by Mr. Meagher , and fitted up at the Observatory .
\amp ; Report of the Kew Committee .
photometer , on Abney 's principle , 13 feet long , has also been fitted for use in the testing operations .
A detailed account of the apparatus and methods employed is in course of preparation by Major Darwin for publication .
Meanwhile circulars , respecting the proposed scheme of examination and preliminary certificates , have been printed , and 200 distributed amongst the leading opticians , manufacturers , and secretaries of all the best known photographic societies , both at home and abroad , to call their attention to the intended plan of examination .
A fire- and burglar-proof safe has been purchased and fitted up for the reception and safe custody of the lenses .
Prepared photographic paper has been procured , and supplied to the Observatories at Aberdeen , Lisbon , Mauritius , Oxford , St. Petersburg , Stony hurst , as well as to the Meteorological Office for Batavia , Fort William , and Valencia .
Other photographic material supplied to Observatories includes developing dishes for Colaba and Oxford , as well as a camera and requisite fittings for cloud and lightning photography for Mauritius .
Anemograph sheets have been sent to Coimbra , Hong Kong , and Mauritius , and blank forms for entry of magnetic observations to Padre Denza and Professor Riicker .
Library.\#151 ; During the year the library has received as presents the publications of\#151 ; 44 Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and Ireland , and 114 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments , as well as of numerous private individuals .
Rouse , Enclosure , $fc.\#151 ; A new stove has been obtained , and fitted up in the clinical testing office to replace the one previously fitted , now worn out .
Stone blocks have been laid down on the surface of the lawn , to ensure the erection of the tripods for supporting magnetometers used for occasional observation , approximately in the proper meridian .
The roofs of the Magnetic Observatory , and of the Experimental House have been newly covered with felt , and freshly tarred .
With the view of the protection of the building against fire , and also for sanitary purposes , the Committee have made application to H.M. Office of Works and Public Buildings to have the Observatory connected with the water mains of the Corporation of Richmond , but , owing to the expense of laying down the necessary pipe , the Office has as yet been unwilling to accede to the Committee 's request ; nor have H.M. Commissioners provided a gas engine for pumping from the wells , capable of furnishing a sufficient quantity of water from the local springs , which they have suggested as an equivalent .
162 Report of the Kew Committee .
The Committee have also represented to the Office of Woods and Forests , the inconvenience to which they are at present subjected by the greatly increased cattle traffic through the existing entrance to the Old Deer Park , since the change of tenants of the park ; H.M , Commissioners have for some $ time had under consideration the provision of a new entrance to the road leading to the Observatory , which shall avoid the passage through the two unfenced cattle lairs , at Clarence Street , Richmond , with their attendant inconvenience and danger ; but no change has , up to the present , been made .
In order to provide additional space for the accommodation of the growing work at the Observatory , the Committee have obtained plans from H.M. Office of Works for the erection of two rooms on the roof of the thermometer testing room in the present west wing .
They propose to proceed with building operations during next summer .
The Librarian is still engaged in the preparation of a card catalogue of the library , and has now completed over 1,700 cards , which contain the titles , \amp ; c. , of all works received by the Committee during the past nine years , together with those of a like title which had been received previously .
The publications not yet catalogued formed part of Sir E. Sabine 's Magnetic Office collection , and are chiefly excerpts from foreign publications and reports .
Workshop.\#151 ; The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew Observatory by grants from the Government Grant Fund or the Donation Fund have been duly kept in order .
Mr. T. Fuller , the former lessee of the Old Deer Park , having resigned his tenancy , the Committee have addressed the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests , and he has decided that in future the land attached to the Observatory shall be let direct from the Crown to the Committee , without the intervention of the park tenant .
Exhibition of Instruments.\#151 ; Several instruments were shown by the Committee at the twelfth annual exhibition of the Royal Meteorological Society , which was composed of Rain Gauges , Evaporation Gauges , \amp ; c. Registration of the Committee under the Companies Act.\#151 ; The Committee have come to the conclusion that it would be of advantage to them , in the transaction of their business , to obtain registration under Section 23 of the Companies Act , 1867 ; and they have obtained the sanction of the President and Council to their making application to the Board of Trade for this purpose .
The matter is still under consideration .

Magnetical Observations , Made at the Kew Observatory , Richmond , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " N. and Long. 0h lm 158'1 W. , height 34 feet above mean sea-level , for the year 1891 .
The results given in the following tables are deduced from the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations of deflection and vibration .
These were made with the Collimator Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow , No. 33 , and needles 1 and 2 , which are 3|- inches in length .
The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing Magnetic Observations .
The following is a list of the days during the year 1891 which were selected by the Astronomer Royal , as suitable for the determination of the magnetic diurnal variations , and which have been employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables .
