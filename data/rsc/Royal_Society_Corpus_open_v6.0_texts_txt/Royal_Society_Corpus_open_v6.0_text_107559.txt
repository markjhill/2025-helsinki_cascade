A Sketch of an Analysis and Notation applicable to the estimation of the value of Life Contingencies .
By BENJAMIN GOMPERTZ , Esq. F. R. S. Read June 99 , 182o .
THE estimation of the value of property , connected with life contingencies , has for many years occupied the attention of the philosophers , as well as the monied and landed interest of this country .
The many institutions now existing in England , for the purpose of granting annuities and assurances on lives , are a sufficient evidence that they are conceived to yield advantages to the community:-advantages which seem to present themselves in two points of view ; the one , the gain accruing to the parties granting the assurance or other object ; the other , the benefit to be received by persons purchasing those grants .
In a political point of view , -it appears a question of great importance to decide , what ought to be the demands of those companies , so that the public may reap the greatest benefit from them ?
And the only means of answering this question , is the possession of the mathematical and philosophical principles , by which those institutions ought to be guided .
In the present improved state of the science of life assurances , it is not sufficient for a proper regulation to follow old customs , and calculations , drawn from a less perfect experience than we have now the means of obtaining ; but every company , to reap the advantage of the progressive state of the science , should not only possess every k1nowledge relative to this science , which it may be within its immediate power to acquire , but it should promulgate its individual information ; that the actuaries of the different societies may , by their mathematical skill , collect for the common good of all , from multiplied resources , that which they cannot obtain from a less general observation .
I am induced to venture this hint , as it is my firm belief , that the tables generally adopted , might , by this means , receive many extremely necessary corrections ; for those tables should be as accurate as they can possibly be made , and the interest should be calculated at that rate which shall appear to be the average interest to be made for money ; but such additional demands should be made by the company or institution , as to leave an adequate portion for its security , profit , and expenses ; for it does not seem possible , in the various beneficial applications which can be made from a proper knowledge of this branch of the mathematics , to judge universally how to adopt tables of mortality , which are not correct in themselves , connected with a rate of interest which is not the .
average rate made in reality , so that the advantage may tend to any one direction .
In granting assurances on lives , it is a practice to use a certain table of mortality , and to calculate at a certain rate of interest , without making any additional charge ; in the presumption , that the tables are in themselves incorrect , but that their deviation from the truth , is in favour of the society ; and that the interest of money is less than that which they can really make but such a plan does not appear to me sufficiently scientific , to be followed by companies concerned with life contingencies generally .
It is not my intention in the paper I have at present the honour 215 to present to this profoundly learned Society , to offer my opinion on the rates of mortality ; but my object is to propose a plan of analysis and notation , which I conceive may be applied with utility to most problems likely to occur , and capable of suggesting a variety of new speculations in the pursuit of this science .
Many accurate and ingenious men have occupied their hours in the improvement of this subject .
Messrs. MORGAN , BAILEY , and MILNE , of the present age , are among the number of mathematicians to whom this department is greatly indebted ; the works of the former two gentlemen have been long before the public ; that of Mr. MILNE , was not earlier than about the commencement of this year in my possession ; but I felt much gratified with the able manner in ' which he has treated his different subjects ; and particularly pleased with his notation , in his sixth chapter , referring to the different orders of survivorship .
I feel thankful for the information I have received from the labours of those who have preceded me ; and I hope that this sketch may be received as a wish to aid science , but not as a medium to censure those whose steps may sometimes have faltered in the paths to knowledge .
To a true philosopher , it will ever be much more pleasing to grant even more praise than is actually due , than to pluck the laurel from the deserving brow .
This is an observation which might frequently be addressed to authors , but I profess no particular point of application in my remark .

I. A function , that is an expression made up of certain quantities , has been often very usefully expressed by some letter with those quantities written underneath , of which that function or expression is made up .
And frequently those quantities only are placed under , which it may be the particular object to bring into notice ; thus , if in an analysis we had the frequent occurrence of some particular expression , / a " + x2 + v/ x + y , for instance , it might be convenient to put some letter to represent it ; and if we had two or more expressions of the same form made up of difierent letters , such for instance as 1Va"+ 'x + V-x-+y , and Va ++z+ w , it may be more convenient to express them by some generic character , which shall still involve the peculiarity of each ; thus , by writing for the one M y , and for the other M , W , and this or a similar mode of notation ; be , comes more necessary when we are ignorant of the form of the expressions to which our analysis is to be applied .

If for x in the expression Mx signifying some function of x , we write separately x= n , xn -p , x -n + 2p , z=n+ 3P , &amp;c. x increasing by the continual addition of p ; then the sum of the terms commencing with x=n and finishing with x=m , is M. + Mtp + M , +2P &amp;c. ... Mm ; and to express this operation on x , I use the symbol n prefixed m to the function of x ; that is , I should write fM for this m sum .
This is the same as what is called the finite integral of M +p ; from x-n to x =m ; that is , the first value of the increment M p+ of theseries being M p , and the last Mm+p or which is the same thing , the first term of the series being M , and the last term of the series M. And thus would Xmp MEI .
express M+q -+ Mn+p + n+ zp * ' Mm+ + and also would P+E M| = Mn+ M+e+p+ Mn+e+2 ... m+$ Mm+g as is evident by writing n+s and m+e respectively in the room of n and m in the first of the series mentioned ; conx x sequently , P M , =^ i+ | MM ; they both being expressive senuently , p MS+x----rn+ .
of the sum of the same series .
Moreover , because when x becomes n , x+e becomes n+e , and when x becomes m , x-I x+s X , x-]se becomes m+ e ; therefore the symbols P and P+ when m m+1 prefixed to the same function mean the same thing , that is nXM --n+I M. mi m+S X Also because n M+ is the symbol for M , p+ Mn , p + &amp;c. ... Mm+ , and n M , is the symbol for M+ M , +p , x fn+2p + &amp;c. ... .
Mm , therefore n M-Mm Mp + 218 x _P ~~~pp n| M x , and also = M , +n_M + , or=^j M+ MI P+X ' f m-.p MPPd This last is also evident from above .

It may be proper to state that the symbol 'I is not necessarily written with the letters x p , n , m ; but that with other letters it will , mutatis mutandis , have a similar meaning : the first or highest letter within the symbol expressing the constant increment of the variable quantity above the symbol ; the second , the value of that variable quantity at the commencement ; and the last or lowest letter the value thereof at the end .
If this letter be infinite , we onmit its no tation and write the symbol thus n. If p , or the first letter wthin be infinitely small , or o comparatively with finites , then the X symbol will stand n and will express the integral of a differential expression of x between the limits n and m of x , and will be the same as the fluent of a fluxional expression between the same limits , mutatis mutandis .

The present value of a periodic income of one pound payable on the joint lives of persons of the present ages a , b , c , &amp;c. at equally distant intervals p , the first payment being due in the time 1 , and the last in the time m , the present value of one pound certain due in one year being r. If there be not any character in the place of the r , in the last symbolic form , the interest is supposed to be the same as in some previous consideration , which shall be evident from the text ; thus , if we had been conversing of an interest of 5 per cent. per annum , we should write a , b , c , to express the present value of an annuity of one pound ( that is one pound payable yearly ) on the joint lives of the present ages a , b , &amp;c. the first payment to be made in one year , because in this case p1 , n=i , and m is infinite , or extends to the longest possible duration of life .

If the income is on the present ages a , b , c , &amp;c. between the terms &amp;c. , on the contingency of v or more of them being living , we write as a symbol of its present value r nP , b , , &amp;c. , and according to this notation we should have in my the following particular cases for the present value of the in rr come b 6 , the same as n ?
na bJ cwhen the income rm 3 m1 mz for the term depends on two or more of the three persons r whose present ages are a , b , c , being living ; na bn c , when it depends on one or more of the three being living ; that is , r what is termed on the longest of the lives ; and mo when it depends on none , or any of them being living , and is therefore the income certain and quite independent of the ages a , b , c , and therefore this case may be written withr out those letters , thus n , and will be expressive of the present value of an income certain for the term , &amp;c. ; o inserted in the angle signifying that it does not involve any contingency ; and this presents us with a ready notation for the purpose of expressing an income for a term , a rate of interest , and a periodic interval of payment given on any nominated contingency specified by any particular character , by placing that character in the angular point ; thus if the contingency involved were designated by the character C , then the income for the term , rate of interest , &amp;c. depending on that continr gency , we should denote by nmCr Art .

Moreover , as n expresses the value of the inm or come certain for the term , and n a , b , c , &amp;c. expresses the value mi of the income for the term on the contingency of v or more of the persons of the present ages a , b , c , &amp;c. being living ; the excess of the former above the latter , will express the value of the income for the term on the contingency of p.--v +i , or more of the persons being dead ; if , be the number of persons in all : because it is certain that out of p persons living at any time , there will after that time either be v or more of them " living , or v-i x or less of them living including o ; but v-~ or less of them being living , is the same as --y+or more o~ , 22 .
" of them dead ; therefore the chance of v of them being liv"ing + the chance of p-vl of them being dead , is equal ' to unity , that is certainty , " and the said excess will be writr r ten n_a b , , &amp; c , and is expressive of the chance of X tn om or more being dead , Xr being equal to tv+ i ; or / * , that is , the number of persons in all being =r-xv--x ; and as the sign r of summation and the intere inindicated by r , the present value of one pound certain to be received at the years end , affect both contingencies alike , we may join those contingencies and r use but one symbol , and we shall have n a , b , , c , &amp;c. for the m o ) v value of the income for the term on the contingency , that out of ir v1 persons , there shall be Xr or more of them dead .
rrr Accordingly would nl a , , , .
and n |-a , b , c rem o,3 mn , 2m o , I spectively signify the value of the income for the term on the contingency of one or more being dead , of two or three being dead , or of all being dead .
And these besides being an appropriate abbreviation of the expressions , likewise indicate , that if from the value of the income certain for the term we subtract separately the value for the income for the term on the contingency of all three being living , on the contingency of two or more being living , and on the contingency of one or more being living , of three persons , we shall have respectively the value of the income for the term on the contingency of one or more being dead , two or more being dead , or of all $m3 r rPa being dead of three persons .

If one pound is to be received at the expiration of the first of the equal periods p , after the expiration of the time n-- , which shall happen after the failure of any of the above conditions of joint or single existence of the persons in question , provided that that failure should take place between the intervals n-p and m ; the present value of this sum will be the present value discounted for the period p of the income on the contingency of the conditions not failing , the first payment to be made at the period n--p , and the last at the period m-p , less the present value of the income on the contingency of the conditions not failing , the first payrent to be made in the time n , and the last in the time m. Thus suppose the income , payable at every interval p , of one pound on the contingency of certain lives remaining , the first payment to be made at the time n , and the last at the time m , be reprer sented by n and therefore a similar regulated income of which the first payment is to be made in the time n-p , and p the last in the time mn-p , will be -P -- , and the present m-^p C value of one pound to be received at the first period p which shall happen after the failure of the condition , &amp;c. is rrrrx -P- .
Because is the valueof one mp CmCXC pound to be received at the period i in the contingency of the r conditions not having failed , on or before that time ; r is the chance of its not having failed on or before that time ; r p in the same manner n-p p is the chance of its not nm-p C having failed on or before the time r--p ; and the excess of the latter above the former , is the chance of its failing between the intervals s , -p and tr , which multiplied by rr gives rrx -r - , for the present value of one pound , to be r -p CwC received at the expiration of the time ?
r , in case the condition should fail between the time , r-p and 7r ; and if qr be successively interpreted by n , n+p ; n+2p , &amp;c. m , the sum of the resulting expressions , will be the value of one pound to be received at the first of the periodsp from the time n-p that shall happen after the failure of the condition , provided that that failure takes place between the periods n-p and m ; but because rrrrr l " _P -p--+ n 2p--+ &amp;c. ... * .

o. It is often necessary in calculating fro mt ables , t have a method of in erpolation for the discovery of terms not sexpliceity coneaadatained , in the tables ; if for instance we had the function Mx , yz &amp;c. calculated in a table , for values of ) , yz , &amp;c. taken in as many series proceeding in arithmetical progression , according to certaint scales of differences , and we wish to have the value of the function , when some only , or neither of them are in those series .
And for this purpose the method of finite differences , when the differences converge , s applied with great advantage , as is well known , 228 SECTION II .

i. If there be any function M , which decreases as w increases , and for x we write x+n , the function will be transformed into M+ ; and may be developed into M--n M+n ' M-+n3 M , &amp;c. where M ' is positive ; and if n be taken sufficiently small we shall have MnM --nM ' sufficiently near .
And nM ' will be nearly the decrement produced in M by writing x-+n for x. And this approximative decrement is proportional to n. Hence it appears , that the number of persons living in any table of mortality indicating the number of persons living at every possible age , that is to any fraction of a year or unity of time , the intervals of age may be taken so small , that whatever the law of mortality may be , ( during any portion of any the same interval , the decremenets may be considered proportional to the time .
Observation informs us , that this proportionality of decrement may be admitted as affording a tolerable degree of accuracy during very long intervals , and in that respect , it gives us some idea of the nature of the function of mortality ; but independently of observations from known results , we see that we may approximate to any degree of accuracy contained in the tables , by dividing long intervals into shorter intervals , and taking , whatever may be the functions of mortality or of living , the decrements proportional to the portions of time between the separate intervals , and thus if we r wished to find the value of n ' b , c , &amp;c. that is the value of m an annuity of one pound on the joint lives whose present ages are a , b , &amp;c. ; the first payment to be made in the time n , and the last in the time m , at a rate per cent. indicated by the 930 present worth r of one pound to be received , certain in one r one year ; because n a , be , &amp;c.

e. Moreover any functions Mx+m , may be developed mM ' , + m1 M " + &amp;c. into the form M.r Mx and , consequently , if n be sufficiently small to admit of all powers of n above the first being omitted , we shall have M , +m = Mx .
rmMx ; and if this remark be applied to the function La , + of the living at the age a+n , we see that we may take an interval m , from n so small , whatever be the real constitution of the function , that the number of the living , during that interval , shall decrease so as to form a geometrical progression very nearly , whilst the portions of time increase in an arithmetical progression ; and that the decrements of living are also in consequence very nearly in geometrical progression : and we may moreover in this , as in the former case , accommodate the function so as to be accurate at the two extremes .
Thus , for instance , if we wish to have an approximative expression in a geometrical progression , for the number of living for ages from So to go years , which shall be exact for the age 20 and 0o , according to the Northampton tables of mortality .

And it alsG follows , that a similar reduction Inay be made for more lives , and their value ths obtained according to the hypothesis .
And this , I inagine , is e ondatio of the practice for determining the value of annuities , on many joint lives , from two tables , of which the one is on single lives , and the other on two joint lives ; and we discover , that if the sane geometrical progression , or a proximity thereto , does not continue hr uget throug e whole , or the certain portion in question of the lives , this method , which may be considered the general practice , must often lead to error .
It may be worth observing , that if La+n , Lb+Lc+ , &amp;c. wevre t ' I ' : respectively equal to La. nL , Lb .
rLb , L r , &amp;c. whatever positive value n might be , that is , if the living from the respective ages a , b , c , &amp;c. , whilst the time increased in arithmetical progression form series in a geometrical progression , then would the present value of the periodic income on the joint lives of the ages a , b , c , &amp;c. be the same for the same term , as on ages older than those by any number of years , either the same for each , or different .
And hence we may have some reason to suspect that the value of annuities given by tables on old age , by a:suming a necessary term to life , as is done in the adopted tables of mortality , is likely to be far from the truth .

Besides the usual mode of reducing them to their equivalents , a number of combinations of joint lives , for the purpose of working from calculated tables , which , when the lives are many , will be a laborious task , and subject to the errors of numerous interpolations and of the other approximative modes which will be necessary in many cases when the lives are numerous , it maybe easier to work them directly without such reduction , or by reducing the terms to geometrical progressions for short 235 periods , &amp;c. and for all these purposes it is necessary to havethe value of the contingencies referring to each payment .
And in order to this , for the sake of brevity , let Ea , n whatever a and n may be , represent the chance that a person of the age a , shall be living at the expiration of the time n , and Da , be the chance of his being dead at the expiration of the time n.

And we are here presented with two dif2 x0 ferent forms for the value of L + .
LrL+ ; that is of the value of the fluent of Lq+x .
Lr+x , whilst x from o becomes -+a ' ; the latter form being on the supposition , that the decrements are proportional to the time throughout the interval S+e ' , and the former , that they are first proportional to the time during the interval E , and that after that they are again proportional to the time through the next interval e ' .
The reason of adducing these two , which are commonly approximate values of is that several ingenious proximate values of +8 Lq..jx ]r+x , is that several ingenious authors in the solution of some of the problems hereafter to be considered , have taken as an approximation that if two persons , who were living at a particular period , are both dead at any nominated period after , within a certain limit , that it is an equal chance which of the two is the survivor ; which as will appear is the natural consequence of supposing the decrements of the lives during every part of that period , to be in a constant proportion to the time elapsed from the commencement of the period .
But the mode of analysis pursueed by those gentlemen , have led them to divide their periods continually into two , the one a period generally of several years , and the other a period of one year only , and they have calculated for the two periods separately , and added the result of the two .
This mode would be given from the first of the two forms of this article , which is extremely more complex than the second form , and apparently with very little , if any advantage ; for if the decrements were accurately in a constant proportion to the time from the comnmencement , they would be perfectly of equal value ; though the one possesses so much more simple a form than the other ; and when they are each but approximations , there will be but little choice to be made between them , in point of proximity , in the use they are to be made of in those problems ; though there will be a vast difference in the degree of simplicity in the resulting formula .

If for q and r we write a and b , and we wish to have the part of the contingency corresponding to the intervals between x _n and x= n + , taking t= 1 in the first of the two forms we have it = ( Lb+n --Lb++nl ) La+-+ n+La+l ) 2L , aa , b and by taking n successively o , I , l , s , &amp;c. and adding the 248 results ; making the division by 2 La , b for the sake of convenience on the sum of numerators , we obtain in the same formula excepting the notation , with the ingenious Mr. MORGAN first , and Messrs.

If we use the second form , the part due to the interval between n and n+1 , will stand _b+ L bn+l a , b o.La , ++ ; this form , at least if the tables of mortality have the number of living inserted for every half year , would be easier in practice than the other .
If a less accurate solution would answer our purpose , we might take t much larger ; if it were taken ten years we should soon get through the work , and frequently with sufficient accuracy , either from the article now quoted , or from Art .

Note .
If the constitution of both functions of life is of " one and the same continuous character , which is not necessarily the case , unless they be taken from one and the " same continuous table ; then it becomes an interesting problem to search , what is the constitution of the function of life , to admit of the aforesaid equality of contingency of A dying after B or B dying after A ; on the condition of their both dying in that time ; that is to say , to find the common characteristic L which shall be independent of a , b , and x , such that i -a k. ( i T ) , the requisite equation above given .
And as this is a problem which , from its " mode of solution , may be equally interesting to the Analyst , " as forming one of a rather novel species of problems , I shall give its solution for both purposes ; in order to which 6I first observe , that unless k be unity , it must be expressiDb ble in the form D , so that the equation may be written in the a La+ L " form D a--Da D Lb+ . ?
D ; otherwise there a Lb " would not be a perfect similarity of the character L , on both D sides of the equation .
For the sake of brevity , put -l= HaaD and therefore b= Hb ; and our equation will stand ' H. ( L4+La ) H. ( Lb+ --L .

are constant .
Whence we a~ " " find the constitution is La-e'-e .
e ; a where e ' , e , e " are " any constants at pleasure .
And if I mistake not , it is the " only function which will admit of this equality of chance continuously between persons whose mortality is formed from the same function ; but if e. be =1+ e , and E be infi"nitely small , this will stand simply La e'e " ( i + a ) ; " or writing g ' for e'-e " ' and g " for e"E , this becomes " La=g'1-g"a , the formula of equal decrements in equal c times .

And thus we might proceed to an infinite variety of cases with regard to the limits in time , with regard to the number of events , &amp;c. ; and however compounded and numerous the signs of fiuentization and summation may be , and if this mode of enunciation be duly considered , it will be found that the meaning of the more compound cases is much easier to express and to understand , in this analytical language , than by a more elaborate phraseology ; and that this mode enables us as soon as the meaning of the question is understood , granting the theory of summations andfluentizations , to solve it .
No. 7 .
By way of illustration I shall only add here , that the nature of the events to which K , K ' , K " &amp;c. may refer , is unlimited ; they may refer to single lives only , to joint lives , to joint lives connected with other joint lives , to joint lives connected with deaths , &amp;c. And that more compounded cases may be understood , I also mention that P1 o fl(r'+P .

Article 6 .
As it is probable that the reader will be desirous to see the application of our theory to some of the problems which have been esteemed the most difficult , I shall consider the problems which have been solved by Mr. MORGAN , in the Philosophical Transactions ; and in pursuing this object , I shall take the examples in the order in which they have been presented by Mr. BAILEY , in his work on Assurances , from page Eo6 , because that Gentleman 's book was in my hand when I worked the examples .
Note , that the object which I denote by p , has with those Gentlemen the particular value one year ; and is supposed by them to be wholly within the limits of proportional decrement .
Note also , that the present ages of A , B and C , I denote by a , b and c. Example i. The chance of A dying , the first of the three lives A , B , C , is by taking K " of No. s , in the last article =LL L : b , and K ' L , the fluent of LLx " b , ca a , b , c Ifp be within the limits of proportional decrements ( that is of decrements proportionate to the times ) then by Section 3 , Article 9 , the chance of the events happening between the o x^:b , c e. a+ a+w+p times X and 7r+p , that is L : -L1S ri L ---a L La+x LLC _+ _ a , b ?

La Lb c2 or if p be small ; such for instance as one year , it will be 26o simply La+ -La+ +p .
, very nearly ; as the other La , b , c , z part will be comparatively with this extremely small ; as an instance , if p answered to one year ; a+r , b+r , c+-jr , each to 34 years , and the Northampton Tables be used : the error caused by neglecting the part in question will not amount to the thirty three thousandth part of the real value .
The error towards the very commencement of life , or towards the end , is c:rtainly greater ; thus if the values of a+-r , b+-r , c+-r were all 90 ; the error Nwith the same tables , and on the same hypothesis of decrement , would bear a nearer proportion to the real value ; but would not amount to the one hundred and thirtieth part of the real value ; and it should be observed in these extreme cases , the hypothesis itself is defective .
Moreover , the present value of one pound to be received at the end of the time r-+p3 , if the event should take place between the times r ' and r+p , will be the said expression x r~+P ; and the sum of all the values produced by interpreting , r , by n--p , n , n-+P , &amp;c. to m-p , will be the present value of the assurance of one pound on the contingency .

But I observe that a near approximation of its value in this case is one twelftli of the income certain for the term multiplied by the chance of all three dying between the intervals n and n-+p ; and as an example ofp=in-= , and the corresponding assurance for the whole possible joint existence be required from the Northampton Tables , for three lives at the age of 3o , at the interest of 3 per cent. ; considering the last income possibly to be received , to be at the age 95 , the term will be 65 , and the approximative value of this neglected part , if the assurance be on ?

I shall now offer in the same order as in Mr. BAILY'S work , some other questions of Mr. MORGAN'S papers , which are most of them of a nature in point of solution different ; in as much as that they contain in my method double fluents ; or , as we have reduced them , contain fluents multiplied by variable quantities .

life time of A ; and independent of the correction , the first part is -x : a , b L+x ( La+ Lb+x ) the evidently L+ fluent of ; the a , b a , b , cLLL LgL b+x Lc+.s +x ?

But in other aaa cases , if we are to have all the contingencies commence with xso , and we are satisfied with the approximation that when two persons are dead , it is an equal chance which has died first , see note , Art .

I do not state the mcase of B 's being the oldest , because it is only necessary to write a for b in the last case to have this .
If we should not be satisfied with the approximation deduced , by assuming the equality of chance above named , during a long period , we have only to divide the period in shorter periods to attain any accuracy , being careful properly to correct the fluents .
The theoretn I have just given for a solution to the problem in question , is so much more simple than the solutions I have seen to this problem , that I think it proper to inform the reader , that the cause will be understood from Art .

As the Tables calculated for the valuation of annuities or yearly incomes may be serviceable for the valuation of incomes payable at less periods , it will be proper to show how the value of such incomes depend on each other ; and also to show how to compare the value of assurances on lives , when the sum assured is to be received at some one of a number of periods which is to'happen after the death , reckoning from a fixed period , with the value of the assurance , if the sum is to be received at a given distant time from the death ; for instance , what is commonly called the assurance of L. on a life , is the value of one pound to be received at the first anniversary from the payment of the premium , which shall happen after the death ; but it is not the value of one pound to be received at the death ; and it is , as will appear farther on , very nearly the value of one pound to be received a half year after the death shall happen .

It is proper to observe , that what refers to the fluents of the expressions L , x x1^ , --Z Lp+ x L+-x x Lr*r La a rr7 .
&amp;c. of Section r , equally apply whether L in the different expressions L4+ , Lr+x , &amp;c. is , mutatis mutandis , the same , or a different functional characteristic , whether when they refer to life contingencies , if L in the one part refers to one given constiuteion , and in the other part it refers to another constitution or not ; for instance , if in the expression Lq+x LLr+x , Lpr refers to the Northampton lives , and Ls , to the Swedish lives , or whether they both refer to the same lives , &amp;c. Whether they refer to the number of living at the ages q+x and r+x , or whether they refer with respect to the variable time x to expressions compounded of the number of living and dead .
But instead of resuming the characteristic L here , I shall , with a view to better distinction , consider the value x M~ N , .
And I observe , similarly to what is done in Secxr+p.87 tion $ , that if x be put sv-+-t , and that if when t be not greater than p , M+t be equal to M tM 's , and N.+t NtN ' , sufficiently near , that we shall have Mx .

-+ 2 , M ' 3N'= =pN ' x M-pN .
MN 2 =-(N-,1 N+p ) M+p .
And therefore if M represent 2 the chance that a certain circumstance shall exist at the time x , and N , the chance that some other certain object shal exist at the time x ; then the chance that the second circumstance shall fail during the exstence of the first between the time np and m is sufficiently nearly =n ( Nr ?
+ x M , r+p ) .
rn-p And the present value of one pound to be received at the first of the periods n , n+p , n+ sp , &amp; c from the present time , which shall happen after such failure , provided it shall take place between the time n--p and m , will be according to hypothesis with sufficient proximity ( r'+PxN +p x M+p : ) : ( rw+P x N , M+p ) ( r+ X N+p x2 m-p-p^ 2 1lm-^ M14p ) .
And this mode of investigation will afford different modes of solution to ALL THE EXAMPLES OF SECTION 4 .

When the term is in@p n m , c-4p\ -ia-my--not very long , especially when there are many lives concerned , it will be often preferable to calculate with the usual tables by calculating each term of the expression IN ' N+p n-p m-p M+p , when put into the form'N,4-Nn .
Mnp+N , -Nn+ 22 Mn+p + &amp;c. And I think when many lives are concerned , 2 this will generally be the best way , if even the term should be long ; but for the sake of preventing great error in such cases , or for near approximation , the following hint may be serviceable .
Suppose we wished to calculate the value of I A , , that is the sum of the first 80 terms of the series whose rth term is A , ; then since An =A A AX+ sA +f A 80 73 74 75 A+ A. .
&amp;c. S A^ , that is the sum of eight terms of a 761 80o z9o new series , whereof the first term is equal to the ist -* gth + 17th &amp;c. term of the original series ; the second term equal to 2nd + loth + &amp;c. term of the original series , &amp;c. it will follow if our original series be a gradually , but a very slowly A converging series , such that.-differs very little from unity ; since each term of the new series will be nearly equal to each other ; that if this method be used , we shall have a means of detecting any great error , as it would be evinced by a too great difference produced in different terms .
And if an approximation to the value be sufficient , we may avoid great labour by taking 8x1 A , , or 8xA A , for the value of the sum ; 771 78 and if r does not differ much from unity A , r will be nearly 8o( 8.r x r'4 A or to 8 .

It may also be serviceable to observe , that if M , y. x Ml , M " , do not contain x or y , that 0 , ( Ml .

This form is put down for the yyy purpose of reducing double fluents at once , such as occur in Section 4 .
In a similar manner may the immediate reduction of analogous triple fluents be shown ; and I may remark , that in the double fluents of Section 4 , the case of the question may not always require them both to commence with the r same value of x. The application of the symbol to all n\ cases of definite and indefinite fluents , and of simple , double &amp;c. fluents , might be enitered on perhaps with advantage to other branches of the mathematics ; but this is not my present object .

If in the room of MS of Art .
4 , of this Scholium , we put r " Mx , MC still being put to represent the chance that the said certain circumstance shall exist in the time x , we shall have the present value of one pound to be received immediately on the failure of the second circumstance , provided it takes place during the existence of the first circumstance , and between the times n-p and m , merely by making that substitution in the expression PpI(NP -N7p x -M+p ) by mn-p which means it will become ( N=-N rp x 4-+P ) or its equal r~P .
Q ; Q being put for the value of the contingency as in Article 4 of this Scholium ; namely , when the payment is to be made at the first of the equal periods n , n+p , s9 % from the present time after the failure , provided it takes place between the intervals n -p and m. And XP_ ( Ni-t , p nm-I r2M +l , ) or its equal r ''* -Nn_pNn rM is the value if it is to be paid immediately after the failure , provided it takes place between the intervals n and m. It is necessary to add , that the method pointed out in Art .
4 of this Scholium , for solving the problems of Section 4 , will generally produce results which do not agree to absolute mathematical equality , with the results of that Section , except the intervalp be infinitely small ; but they will agree with each other as far as the first power of p is concerned ; which when p is taken , the smallest interval of the tables will be as near the truth as any method should be considered to reach , as long as the real function of life is not known ; except indeed there be sufficient regularity in the tables to induce the belief that we may approach nearer by interpolation , as hinted in Art .
4 , Section 3 ; but if the interval p be not greater than one year , this will give , I think , sufficient accuracy for any useful purpose , except perhaps in very rare cases , and in which our tables ( from more minute observation ) , should , I imagine , be divided into less periods than yearly interval , and then the same method would still apply by taking p smaller .
The same observation will apply if a comparison is made with what is done in the present Article 6 of this Scholium , with the other articles of the Scholium ; for instance , with Article 3 .
As an annuity secured by land , only differs from common annuities , in as much as in case of death of the lives on which the annuity is determined , during the portion of a year , that that portion of the annuity is payable to the assignees r of those persons ; its value will be equal to n a , b , c , &amp;c. + rft s+t:a , a , c , &amp; c but : if LL be n-I tx 7 ... .

I might make some farther observations on the comparison of the different methods pointed out , with respect to their proximity , but I fear that the length of this Paper has already caused me to occupy too large a portion of the present volume .
