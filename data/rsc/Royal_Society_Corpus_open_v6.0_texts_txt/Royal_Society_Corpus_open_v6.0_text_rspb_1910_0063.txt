Introduction .
This interesting species of trypanosome appears to be widely distributed in Uganda .
It was first discovered by the Commission in two cattle which came from Kavirondo , the district lying to the north-east of Victoria Nyanza .
These oxen were driven to Kampala round the north end of the Lake , and probably became infected on the way .
Then the Government Transport Department lost many of their oxen from this trypanosome .
They were worked between Kampala , the native capital , and Luzira , the port on the Lake-shore , which lies about seven miles to the south-east .
When the epidemic .
broke out these cattle were kraaled near the Lake-shore , along which they were allowed to graze , and where tsetse-flies are numerous .
Afterwards , at the suggestion of the Commission , they were kraaled at Kampala , when the epidemic stopped , and no more deaths from Trypanosoma vivax occurred among them .
Cases also occurred among the transport cattle belonging to the German Company , " Victoria Kyanza Agentur .
" These cattle were employed carrying goods between Lake Victoria and Lake Albert .
Lastly , the Glossina palpalis on the Lgike-shore near Mpumu , where the Sleeping Sickness Commission laboratory was placed , were found to be naturally infected with Trypanosoma vivax , and this trypanosome was found in the blood of a bush-buck , shot at the same place at which the flies were collected .

16 Col. Sir D. Bruce and others .
Trypanosome [ July 22 , The evidence , therefore , at present points to the Glossina being the carrier of this disease , and that the wild animals living in the fly area act as a reservoir of the virus .
This species of trypanosome is similar to Trypanosoma nanum , in that it is only pathogenic to equines and bovines , and has no effect on the smaller laboratory animals .
There was no opportunity in Uganda of inoculating it into horses , mules , or donkeys .
Mne cattle came under observation suffering from a natural infection of the disease .
Seven of these died after being at Mpumu , on an average , 103 days .
Five cattle were successfully inoculated , and these died , on an average , in 69 days .
The disease is , therefore , a fairly rapid and fatal one in cattle .
It may be noted that two of the cattle ( Experiments 493 and 583 ) , after living for 268 and 237 days respectively , died at last from an accidental infection of Trypanosoma pecorum .
It is possible that these two oxen had recovered , and if not , it is certain that trypanosomes were either absent or very scanty in their blood , as inoculations from them failed to infect goats and sheep .
It may also be noted that none of the four sheep which were inoculated ever showed signs of the disease .
This is probably due to the scarcity or absence of the trypanosomes in the blood used in the experiment for inoculation , and not to any natural immunity .
Morphology of Trypanosoma vivax .
This species of pathogenic trypanosome can at once be recognised among all the others by its shape alone .
There is no tendency to dimorphism , as in Trypanosoma bracei and Trypanosoma gambiensc .
On the contrary , the individuals tend to run persistently to one type .
This type has an average length of 24 microns .
The body posterior to the nucleus is swollen , and contains clear protoplasm , in which an alveolar structure can be made out ; the posterior end is rounded , as a rule , and close to it is the large round micronucleus ; the anterior part of the body rapidly narrows and terminates in a free flagellum ; the nucleus is elongated and situated in the narrowed part , is often broken upVand diffused , and seems to fill up the part of the body in which it lies ; the undulating membrane is narrow and simple , and can , as a rule , only be made out by the deeply-stained flagellum running along its border .
' An examination of the plates which illustrate this paper will , however , give a clearer idea of the general appearance of this species than any written description .

A. Living , Unstained .
This species of trypanosome is extremely active in its movements .
It dashes across the field of the microscope with such rapidity that it is impossible to follow its movements , cyclone-like leaving a clear path , the corpuscles in its track having been flung on either side .
If it remains at the same spot for a time , as it sometimes does , it has an appearance of great energy and power , throwing the surrounding red blood corpuscles about in wild confusion .
B. Fixed and Stained .
The blood-films were fixed , stained and measured as described in the ' Proceedings.'* Length.\#151 ; The following table gives the average length of this trypanosome in the ox and goat .
Twenty trypanosomes are drawn and measured from each preparation , the average length reckoned , and the length of the longest and shortest given .

Trypanosome [ July 22 , Breadth.\#151 ; Varies between 2 and 3 microns .
Shape.\#151 ; This species can be recognised with certainty by its shape alone .
The body of the creature lies mostly posterior to the nucleus , and this part is broad and swollen and filled with beautifully clear protoplasm , in which a delicate.alveolar structure can be made out .
The body narrows at the nucleus and tapers off rapidly to the anterior extremity ( Plates 3 and 4 ) .
Contents of Cell.\#151 ; Clear , with a delicate alveolar structure , and now and then a chromatin-staining granule , especially in the narrow anterior part .
Nucleus.\#151 ; Long and oval , often diffuse , situated towards the anterior extremity , and in a narrowed or waist-like part of the trypanosome .
Micronucleus.\#151 ; Large , round and terminal , or sub-terminal .
Undulating Membrane.\#151 ; Narrow , simple , straight , and little in evidence .
Flagellum.\#151 ; There is a well-marked flagellum , the free part varying from 3 to 6 microns in length ( Plates 3 and 4 ) .
Comparison of Trypanosoma yivax , Uganda , 1909 , with Trypanosoma vivax , Togoland , 1903 .
Thanks to the courtesy of the Director of the Hamburg Institute of Tropical Medicine , through Dr. Eulleborn , the Commission are enabled to compare the Uganda strain with the original preparations made by Ziemann in 1903 .

Trypanosome [ July 22 , From a comparison of these tables and the figures on Plate 3 , there can be little doubt that the trypanosome found in the blood of cattle in Uganda in 1909 is identical with that seen in 1903 , and also with that discovered by Ziemann in Togoland , and named by him Trypanosoma vivax .
As Dr. Laveran kindly examined the Uganda specimens and pronounced them to be Trypanosoma cazalboui , it is probable that Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma cazalboui are the same species .

Trypanosome [ July 22 , inoculated with a drop of blood from the heart of an ox , Experiment 450 , dead of Trypanosoma vivace disease , is as follows :\#151 ; March 3 , 1909.\#151 ; Inoculated six tubes .
The trypanosomes ai'e very scarce in the blood .
March 6.\#151 ; Tube No. 1 has been examined daily for signs of growth .
Nothing living has been seen .
The tube remains sterile .
March 8.\#151 ; To-day many very active trypanosomes are seen .
They are single or in small groups of ten or twenty or so .
The cell-contents are granular .
The cells possess flagella , but no obvious undulating membranes .
There are many dividing forms to be seen , and division is evidently going on rapidly , as many individual trypanosomes appear to be undergoing fission into three or more at the same time .
March 9.\#151 ; Since yesterday an immense multiplication has taken place .
The trypanosomes are still very active .
They appear to have free flagella and long-pointed , finely granular posterior extremities .
March 11.\#151 ; Many highly active trypanosomes seen .
They are elongated , thin , and have a long free flagellum , sometimes as long as the body itself .
The trypanosomes remained alive and active up to 20 or 30 days , when the tubes became contaminated , or dried up , and were thrown away .
Size.\#151 ; Cultural forms of Trypanosoma vary much in size .
At first , when they begin to multiply , on or about the sixth day , the individuals forming groups are about 15 microns in length .
Next day they are longer and thinner , and later many are seen 50 , 60 , or more , microns in length .
Shape.\#151 ; At first , the young forms are oval or elliptical in shape ; afterwards they become more attenuated ; and later still may be seen as huge trypanosomes with undulating membranes and long free flagella .
Contents of Cell.\#151 ; In the living unstained condition this appears to be finely granular .
Undulating Membrane.\#151 ; In the smaller forms composing the groups no obvious undulating membrane can be made out .

The Carrier of Trypanosoma vivax .
It was pointed out in a previous paper that , in laboratory experiments^ Trypanosoma vivax readily develops in and that this tsetse fly can convey the infection to healthy animals after a period of from 20 to 30 days.* It was also found that this fly is naturally infected with this trypanosome , and several animals became ill and died of this disease when freshly-caught Lake-shore flies were fed upon them.f The epidemic among the Government Transport oxen at Kampala also points to this fly being the carrier .
As stated above , as long as the cattle were kraaled at the Lake-shore and exposed to the bites of Glossina palpalis , so long did they suffer from Trypanosoma vivax infection .
Afterwards , when stabled at Kampala , the fatality from this disease ceased .
Although it must be confessed the evidence is rather scanty , what there is points to the Glossina palpalis as being a carrier , if not the chief carrier , of Trypanosoma vivax ; and there is no evidence at present to incriminate the j Fabanids or Stomoxys .
Conclusions .
1 .
Trypanosoma , vivax , an easily recognisable species , gives rise to a fatal disease of cattle in Uganda .
2 .
The carrier of Trypanosoma vivax .
is probably Glossina palpalis , which is found naturally infected on the Lake-shore .
3 .
The reservoir of the virus is possibly the antelope which frequent the Glossina palpalis area .
