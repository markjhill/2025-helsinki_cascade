) ( Abstract .
) With a view to comparing the values of secular change of declination , horizontal force , and inclination , at various stations on the coasts of the British Isles , with the values derived from the continuous records at Kew Observatory , the Hydrographer ( Rear-Admiral A. Mostyn Field , F.R.S. ) directed that observations should be made at certain stations selected from those occupied by Rucker and Thorpe during their magnetic survey for the \#171 ; poch January 1 , 1891 .
The observers detailed to make the observations were:\#151 ; Captain M. H. Smyth , R.N. , H.M.S. " Research " ; Captain W. Pudsey-Dawson , R.H. , H.M.S. " Triton " ; and Captain J. W. Comb , R.N. , H.M. surveying vessel \#166 ; " G-ladiator .
" The stations selected were fairly distributed around the coasts , so that a mean of the results would represent the mean for the whole .area embraced .
, The observations have been reduced to the epoch January 1 , 1907 , by means of comparisons with the records at Kew Observatory .
The resulting values of mean annual changes for the British Isles are as follows:\#151 ; ( a ) ' ( b ) 21-year period .
16-year period .
( 1 ) Declination 1886\#151 ; 1907 .
- 5'*7 1891\#151 ; 1907 - 5'T ( 2 ) Horizontal force + 19 7 + I87 ( 3 ) Inclination - l'*6 - l'-4 ( 4 ) Vertical force ( excepting the results at Dublin and Tanera Mor ) \#151 ; 14 7 The mean annual changes of declination at Kew comparable with ( 1 ) a and b are respectively 5''2 and 4''9 .
Thus the mean for the British Isles during the 16-year period is 0''2 greater than at Kew .
The mean horizontal force change appears to have been 3 \lt ; y less than at Kew .
The mean inclination change during the 21-year period was O'T less , and during the 16-year period 0'-6 less , than at Kew .
476 Magnetic Observations on Coasts of British , 1907 .
The mean vertical force change during the 16-year period has been 87 less than at Kew .
Diagrams showing the mean annual changes at Kew from 1889 to 1904 indicate that the declination change , which since 1894 has been decreasing in amount , is now increasing , and that the probable mean value for January 1 , 1907 , Kew , is 4'-8 .
For the whole of the British Isles , therefore , the mean value is assumed to be 5 ' .
The annual increase of horizontal force continues to diminish and is at the present time very small ; there has been a very marked diminution during the last two years , and the annual increase may shortly become a decrease .
The annual change of inclination continues to decrease in amount , and is now 1 ' ( nearly ) .
A comparison of the value of the mean annual change of declination at Kew , Greenwich , and Stonyhurst shows that whereas , during the period embracing Biicker and Thorpe 's survey ( 1886\#151 ; 1894 ) , the change at Stonyhurst was considerably greater than at Kew and Greenwich , this being in accord with the results found by Bucker and Thorpe , that the secular change was greater in the north-west than at Kew .
Since the year 1894 , however , the values have been in closer agreement , that at Stonyhurst being slightly less than at Kew .
Thus it is indicated that the variations of secular change are not , over the area referred to , synchronous .
Comparisons of results of declination observations made at sea with those made on shore show considerable differences , and although the sea observations cannot be considered to the same degree of accuracy as the shore observations , the differences are in most cases outside the margin which might be assigned to this cause .
The results indicate that the values at sea are , off the east coast generally greater , and on the west coast generally less , than the corresponding values adduced from observations made on shore .
It is intended to investigate this subject further .
