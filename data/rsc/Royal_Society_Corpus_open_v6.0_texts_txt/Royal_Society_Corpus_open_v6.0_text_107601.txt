Particulars oa fact , nearly similar to that related by Lord MORTON , communicated to the President , in a letter from DANIEL GILES , Esq. Read November 23 , 1 8o .
IN answer to your enquiries , I will now give the best account I can of my sow and her produce .
She was one of a well known black and white breed of Mr. WESTERN , the Member for Essex .
About ten years since I put her to a boar of the wild breed , and of a deep chesnut colour , which I had just received from Hatfield House , and which was soon afterwards drowned by accident .
The pigs produced ( which were her first litter ) partook in appearance of both boar and sow , but in some the chesnut colour of the boar strongly prevailed .
The sow was afterwards put to a boar of Mr. WESTERN'S breed ( the wild boar having been long dead ) .
The produce was a litter of pigs , some of which we observed , with much surprise , to be stained and clearly marked with the chesnut colour which had prevailed in the former litter .
This sow had afterwards another litter of pigs by a boar of Mr. WESTERN'S breed , and I think , and so does my bailiff , that some of these were also slightly marked with the chesnut colour ; but though we noticed the recurrence with surprise , it is so long since , that our recollection is much less perfect than I wish it to be .
I should observe , that I have known Mr. WESTERN'S breed many years , but never in any other instance observed the least appearance of the chesnut colour .
Believe me , &amp;c. DANIEL GILES .
