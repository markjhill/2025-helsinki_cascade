) The object of the work described in the present paper was to extend the measurements of Thermal Conductivities of Metals and Alloys made by Lorenz , Jager and Diesselhorst , and others at temperatures between 0 ' C. and 100 ' C. down to the temperature of liquid air , and thus provide a means of comparing the Thermal and Electrical Conductivities of these substances over a much wider range of temperature than has hitherto been possible .
The method adopted was a modification of that used originally by Wiedemann and Franz .
A rod of the metal , 7 or 8 cm .
long , 06 cm .
in diameter , was placed in the axis of a vertical copper tube of 2*7 cm .
internal 33 cm .
external diameter , 9'5 cm .
long , closed at the top .
The lower end of the rod fitted into a copper disc , which in its turn fitted into the lower end of the copper tube .
The joints were accurately made and were smeared with olive oil to exclude air and improve the thermal contact .
The heat which flowed along the rod was supplied electrically by means of a current through a fine platinoid wire wound on a short thin brass sleeve , which was slipped on to the upper end of the rod .
The difference of temperatures at two points of the rod , between the heating coil and the point where the rod entered the disc forming the lower end of the tube , was measured by means of two platinum thermometers , the wires of which were wound on two short thin brass sleeves , capable of sliding along the rod .
The three sleeves fitted the rod closely , and thermal contact was improved by smearing rod and sleeves with a little olive oil .
The apparatus was placed in a Dewar vacuum vessel , which could be filled with liquid air .
When the apparatus had cooled down to the temperature of the liquid , the excess of liquid was poured off , and observations commenced .
Owing to the heat supplied to the rod , and the flow of heat from without , the Prof. C. H. Lees .
Effects of Temperature and [ Nov. 8 , temperature of the whole apparatus rises , and it is shown in the complete paper under what conditions observations taken under such circumstances can be used to determine conductivities .
In making a determination , the difference of resistance of the two platinum thermometers was first measured with the heating current round the rod zero , then with the current flowing , then again with it zero .
The difference between the second and the mean of the first and last gives the difference of resistance due to the flow of heat down the rod .
The instruments used in measuring the watts spent in the heating coil were standardised , and a correction was made for the heat conducted away from the rod along the wires supplying the current and along the wires to the platinum thermometers .
The effect of each sleeve on the flow of heat through the rod in its neighbourhood was calculated and allowed for .
The platinum thermometers were standardised by observations of their resistances in steam at about 100 ' C. , in ice at 0 ' C. , and in liquid oxygen boiling under a reduced measured pressure .
All temperatures are by this means reduced to the standard constant volume hydrogen thermometer .
Resistance coils were standardised by comparison with standards tested at the National Physical Laboratory or at the Reichsanstalt .
The rods used were turned from materials supplied as pure by firms , of repute , and have been tested for density and electrical conductivity .
The following table embodies the results obtained , together with those given for higher temperatures by Jager and Diesselhorst , and it will be seen that they justify the following statements:\#151 ; The thermal conductivities of most pure metals decrease as the temperature rises within the range \#151 ; 160 ' to 100 ' C. The thermal conductivities of all alloys tested increase as the temperature rises within the range \#151 ; 160 ' to 100 ' C. 1907 .
