) It is clear , from the experiments of W. Wilson* and others , f that one of the main factors in the absorption of / 3-rays is the loss in velocity of / 3-rays in passing through matter .
It follows from this that / 3-rays of a definite speed must have what may be called a maximum range , and also that an exponential law of absorption for / 3-rays can only be approximate .
These facts are brought out in the following experiment on the / 3-rays of radium E. Two preparations of radium ( D +E -f-F ) were used , one relatively weak .
The weaker preparation was placed 2 cm .
below an electroscope 4 cm .

Similar experiments were made with the stronger preparation .

The / 3-rays coming through this amount of paper were examined as before , and readings , corrected for 7-rays , are given in Table II .

These results have been confirmed by placing the stronger preparation of radium D 12 cm .
below an electroscope and deflecting the / 3-rays away by a magnetic field , thus allowing directly for the effect of 7-rays .
A rough explanation of the results obtained may be given as follows :\#151 ; A true exponential law of absorption would mean that the distribution of the / 3-rays with respect to velocity would be unaltered as the / 3-rays passed The Similarity in Nature of X- and Primary y-Rays .
489 through matter , always assuming that the / 3-rays had passed through enough matter to nullify the effects of scattering .
If we assume such a distribution and from it plot the number of / 3-rays against the velocity , there will be a certain velocity for which the number of / 3-rays is a maximum .
We will call this velocity the mean velocity , the / 3-rays with a smaller velocity the slower / 3-rays , and those with a greater velocity the faster / 3-rays .
The exponential law would probably mean that the very slowest / 3-rays were absorbed , while the faster / 3-rays simply lost energy , * the distribution keeping the same .
This hypothetical distribution , however , cannot be kept indefinitely , as the faster / 3-rays must ultimately have a smaller velocity than the mean velocity , and so , as we have seen above , the exponential law can only be approximate , and after a certain thickness the / 3-rays must become more and more absorbable .
Similar results to those obtained above can be deduced from a table given in a paper by H. W. Schmidt* on the absorption ( in aluminium ) of the / 3-rays of radium E. The Similarity in Nature of X- and Primary y-Rays A By J. A. Gray , M.Sc .

) Introduction .
It has generally been supposed that X- and primary 7-rays are of the same nature .
Both radiations are not deflected by electric and magnetic fields , and both excite cathode or / 3-rays in materials in which they are being absorbed , the velocities of these cathode or / 3-rays being independent of the material in * Schmidt , " Phys. Zeit .
, ' 1907 , vol. 8 , p. 362 .
t The term X-rays is arbitrarily limited to the X-rays excited by cathode rays in vacuum tubes or to the scattered and characteristic radiations formed from these X-rays in suitable radiators .
The most penetrating X-rays so far experimented on are a little more penetrating than the X-rays characteristic of cerium .
We keep the term y-rays for y-rays excited by / 3-rays .
Primary y-rays are y-rays emitted from radioactive atoms .
