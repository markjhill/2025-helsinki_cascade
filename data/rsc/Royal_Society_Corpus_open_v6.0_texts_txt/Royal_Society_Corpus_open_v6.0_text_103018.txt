An Account of some Roman Coins found at Clifton near Edlington in Yorkshire .
By Mr Ralph Thoresby , F. R. S. I Take my self obliged to give you an account of the discovery of some Roman Coins , lately found at Clifton , near Edlington , the Seat of the Honoured and Obliging Robert Molesworth Esq ; from whom I have received a Noble Present of them ; which is the more valuable , because by his Ingenuity they are so artificially cleared from the Rust they had contracted by lying so many Centuries in the Earth , that they appear little inferior to what they were when first Minted : They were dug up at the East Entrance of Clifton ( a Village on the Cliff of the Hill ) three miles from Doncaster , the Roman Danum , where the ~ Equitum ~ resided , and one from Cunsbrough , or Coningsburgh , an Ancient Seat of the Kings during the Saxon Heptarchy , now belonging to Mr Cook of Norfolk .
They were found so near a Highway , that the Cart-tracks had worn the Earth off the top of the Urn , which a Labourer of Mr Molesworth 's struck his Pick-Ax into , before he was aware of it : Upon another search , they found another Theca Nummaria , both full of Copper Coin ; the haste and scramble of the workmen to get the supposed Booty ( which they hoped might prove as valuable as the Broad Gold found at ~ ) made them break in pieces both the Urns , which were large and entire ; the bigger of them might contain two gallons : By the fragments of them they appear to have been of a Eeeeeeeeeeeee finer finer Clay than those found at South Holland in Lincolnshire , mentioned in the Phil. Trans. No 279 , and the Coins also much better preserved , being in a dryer Soil .
Of sixty I bought of those found at Fleet com. Linc .
there was not one before Gallienus , nor after Quintillus ; and of near 150 of these from Clifton , there is not one of an elder or later date ; so that both those in Holland and these in Yorkshire~ seem to have been hid in some common Calamity that followed the Death of that short-liv 'd Emperor Quintillus , who reigned but seventeen days , An. Dom .
271 .
And within six years after , we find that Probus the Emperor , upon some Commotions in Britain , sent over certain Vandals and Burgundians , who had invaded Gaul , to inhabit Hritain ; upon whose arrival , probably such as had made the Insurrection , might conceal their Treasure ; and being slain in the Conflict , it lay hid till now .
This I look upon as a more probable Conjecture , than the Per~ secution of Dioclesian , which was not till thirty four years after .
These , tho they have not added one Emperor to my Collection , yet have they made a very considerable addition to the Variety of Reverses ; so that I have above thirty of Gallienus .
But not to trouble you with any I had before ( as VICTORIAGERMAN IC A. VIRTVSGALLIENIAV G. GERM AN ICVSMAX V. &amp;c. ) I shall only present you with a list of such as were sound at Clifton .
So far as are in Ca pital Letters are upon the Coins , the rest are only for explanation .
