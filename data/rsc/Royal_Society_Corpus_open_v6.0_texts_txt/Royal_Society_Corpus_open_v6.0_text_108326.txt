SOME months back , at the instigation of Dr. GOLDING BIRD , I undertook some experiments to ascertain whether , in cases of diseased and imperfect function of the lungs or liver , when the normal quantity of carbon could not be discharged from the system by those channels , the Ikidneys undertook an extra duty , and whether under such circumstances an excess of carbon could be shown in the urine above that usually secreted under healthy conditions .
Should this question be answered in the affirmative , and should it be found that a larger amount of carbon was excreted by the urine in persons affected with such diseases , a practical application might reasonably be made of the fact .
For by stiniulating the kidneys to still greater exertion , the amount of work required of the lungs or of the liver could be lessened , and thus a better chance offered them of being restored to a healthy state .
The method proposed for solving this problem was , to precipitate the urine of different patients suffering from diseases of the kinds mentioned , with basic acetate of lead , keeping it slightly alkaline by the addition of a few drops of ammonia , then to ascertain the amiount of organic matter contained in the precipitate , and in particular the amount of carbon , and lastly to compare these quantities with those obtained in a similar manner from the urine of healthy individuals .
In endeavouring to determine the amount of organic Imatter in the lead precipitate by burning , as likewise in determining the quantity of carbon by an elementary analysis of the same precipitate with oxide of copper , results were obtained which did not agree , and many difficulties arose which it is not necessary to state nov , but which rendered it absolutely necessary to separate by some means the organic matter from the oxide of lead before submnitting it to analysis , and even that we might obtain accurately its quantity .
Whilst employed in seeking an accurate mode of separation , Dr. SCHERER'S paper appeared on the extractive matters of urine* , in which a successful mode of separation is described , and the question at issue answered .
Dr. SCHERER finds that the extractive or colouring matter of the urine contains a larger quantity of carbon and hydrogen when obtained from persons in whom the normal function of the lungs , of the liver or of the skin is deranged , than when taken from healthy subjects , and that the same excess of carbon passes off by the urine when the diet is more than usually rich in that element .
From his paper however it does not appear that the quantity of this extractive or colouring matter passed during a certain space of time has been ascertained , and it strikes me that he assumes the quantity of extractive to be the same in all kinds of urine ; this I think requires to be proved before it can be positively affirmed that more carbon and hydrogen do pass off by the urine in such diseased conditions , as a larger quantity of less highly carbonized extractive matter might compensate for the excess of carbon in the more highly carbonized , supposing the latter to be in less quantity .
The relative quantity of these matters , and likewise the relative quantities of urea in a certain amount of urine , must be accurately determined before the conclusion can be considered as absolutely proved .
Whilst engaged with the foregoing researches , it occurred to me that it might not be devoid of interest to the physiologist to know the amount of sulphur which was secreted by the kidneys in an unoxidized state .
That urine does contain sulphur , not in combination as sulphate , is evident from the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen which , mixed with that of ammonia , is evolved from it whilst undergoing spontaneous decomposition , also frbom the blackening which white lead paint suffers when exposed to the gases arising from putrid ur'ine , and likewise from the fact , that urine allowed to putrefy in a glass vessel containing oxide of lead as one of its contituents , permanently blackens the glass .
To set the fact beyond doubt , two portions of urine , previously deprived of mucus by acetic acid and filtration , each consisting of four fluid ounces , were measured ; the one simply evaporated and burnt , the other evaporated and afterwards deflagrated with nitre .
Each portion was then dissolved in dilute nitric acid , leaving a the results were as follows : Four fluid oz. , simply incinerated , gave Four fluid oz. , deflagrated with grs. gr. nitre , gave in grains BaO SO3 2-656 SO3 0*902 BaO SO3 5-697 = 03 1954 S 0'366 .
=S 0-783 .
The quantity of sulphur in four fluid ounces not excreted in the state of sulphate was therefore 0'417 grain .
To ascertain the quantity of sulphur excreted by the urine in twenty-four hours in an unoxidized state , the whole quantity passed by three individuals during that time was collected on different days and measured ; its specific gravity was taken , and after being filtered from mnucus , two portions of each specimen were measured in a specific-gravity bottle containing 1000 grain measures ; one portion was simply acidified with nitric acid , and the sulphuric acid precipitated by nitrate of barytes .
The other portion was evaporated with nitre and deflagrated , and the fused mass treated with dilute nitric acid and nitrate of barytes .
From the difference in the quantities of sulphate of barytes obtained , the amount of sulphur not in an oxidized state was ascertained .
The results from five different experiments are shown by the following Table .

J| It thus appears that from three to five grains of sulphur pass off daily by the urine in some other combination than as sulphuric acid , and that these three to five grains amount to about one-fourth of the whole quantity of sulphur excreted by the kidneys .
With a view to ascertain what compound contained this sulphur in the urine , I have examined the precipitates produced in urine by neutral and basic acetate of lead , after the separation of the sulphates by baryta , and find that they only contain traces of sulphur .
The colouring matter described by SCHERER , and obtained by the method he adopts , likewise contains only a trace ; whereas the liquid containing the urea , generally considered free from all other organic matter , which remains on the separation of the precipitate by basic acetate of lead , contains nearly the whole of this excess of sulphur , but how combined I have not yet been able to ascertain .
The determination of this question , which I propose to examine , may possibly lead to some interesting facts , and perhaps throw some light upon the question respecting the formation of cystic oxide .
From some preliminary experiments made for the purpose of ascertaining whether phosphorus was contained in urine in any other compound than as phosphate , the following results were obtained .
To the four ounces of urine employed for the preliminary detelmination of the sulphuric acid and sulphur in the former experiment , after the precipitation of the sulphuric acid by barytes , some more nitrate of barytes was added and then the whole carefully neutralized with ammonia .
The following quantities wele obtained : Phosphate of barytes obtained from the Phosphate of barytes obtained from urine PO5 naturally contained in urine was after deflagration with nitre was BaO PO5 5-775 grains Ba P 6532 grains -POG 1'834 =PO5 2-074 -P 0-805 ; =P 0'910 ; showing an excess of phosphorus over that contained as phosphatin the four ounces of urine to be 0*105 grain .
463 In another experiment , in which the same portions of urine were employed as at the fifth column of the foregoing Table , the following were the results : Phosphate of barytes obtained from the P05 Phosphate of barytes obtained from 1016 grs. naturally contained in 1016 grs. of urine .

BaO PO5 3-135 grains BaO PO5 5'313 grains =PO5 0'993 =PO5 1-687 =P 0'435 .
P 0740 .
Therefore 0-305 grain of phosphorus was contained in the 1016 grains of urine in an unoxidized state , which , calculated for the whole amount of urine passed in twentyfour hours , would amount to 5'896 grains .
In some other specimens of urine which I examined there was however no approach to this quantity of phosphorus in an unoxidized state , and as the mode of analysis employed in these preliminary experiments was not the most accurate , I intend to make the determination of the quantity of phosphorus the subject of further experiments .
The only opportunity I have had of examining urine in a diseased state , was a portion obtained from a patient suffering from diabetes mellitus .
As might have been anticipated from the character of this disease , the amount of sulphur which the urine contained in an unoxidized state , was considerably greater ( by one-fourth ) than in healthy urine .
The diabetic urine had a specific gravity of 1046 .
Of this urine 1046 grains , precipitated with nitrate of barytes , gave4'308 grains sulphate of barytes =1 479 grain SO0 --=0*592 grain S. After the precipitation of the sulphuric acid by baryta , the urine was evaporated down with nitric acid , mixed with nitre and deflagrated .
An excess of nitrate of barytes having been used to precipitate the sulphuric acid , there remained on treating the fused mass with dilute nitric acid , an insoluble residue of sulphate of barytes , the sulphuric acid of which had been derived from the oxidation of the sulphur by the nitre ; the sulphate of barytes amounted to 1'837 grain =0'629 grain sulphuric acid =0'251 grain sulphur , or 0'024 per cent. , whilst in healthy urine the sulphur in this state never exceeded 0'018 per cent. 464
