The paper is illustrated by three plates , the first giving the sea-level distribution of pressure and the wind directions all over India , the second the distribution of pressure at a height of 10,000 feet , and the third the curves of temperature decrement on ascending , both as given by observation in Glaisher 's balloon ascents , and as computed on the hypothesis of adiabatic convection .

( Abstract .
) This is a continuation of the investigation in which the authors are engaged .
The measurements include the expansion of the liquid , the pressure of the vapour , and the compressibility of the substance in the gaseous state ; and from these are deduced the densities of the saturated vapour and the heats of vaporisation .
The total range of temperature is from \#151 ; 15 ' to +240 ' ; the range of pressure , from 11 mm. to 60,000 mm. The conclusions announced in their previous papers are supported by these measurements .
The apparent critical temperature is 240'0 ' , and the critical pressure about 59,700 mm. III .
" Further Discussion of the Sun-Spot Observations made at South Kensington .
" By J. Norman Lockyer , F.R.S. Received January 8 , 1887 .
In papers communicated to the Royal Society , and printed in the 'Proceedings ' ( vol. 31 , pp. 72 and 348 ; vol , 32 , p. 203 ; and vol. 33 , p. 154 ) the sun-spot observations made at South Kensington since 1879 have been to some extent discussed .
In the last paper communicated to the Society , in May , 1886 , I discussed the results obtained by the reduction of the observations of the most widened lines in the region F to for the whole number of observations ( 700 ) made from November , 1879 , to August , 1885 .
In the latter paper it was shown that as we pass from the minimum to the maximum period included in the years named , the lines of known terrestrial elements disappear , their places being taken by lines which do not appear in any maps or tables of spectral lines .
If was pointed out that such a result might be explained on the supposition that since the solar atmosphere is quietest and coolest at the
