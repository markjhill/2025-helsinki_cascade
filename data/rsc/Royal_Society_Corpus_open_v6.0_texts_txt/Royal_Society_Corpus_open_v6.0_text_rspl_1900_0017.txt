In a former paper* we described experiments on the electrical qualities of specimens of glass of which the chemical composition was determined by analysis .
Results were given for a lead-potash glass made by Messrs. Powell and Sons , of London , a lead-potash glass made by Messrs. Schott and Co. , of Jena , a barium glass , and a zinc-soda glass ( " Jena glass " ) , both made by Messrs. Schott and Co. These * ' Roy .

specimens are referred to in the paper by the numbers XXI\#151 ; XXIV .
We have now to communicate the results of some further experiments , the object of which was to throw light on various points which had arisen in connection with the previous experiments , and to afford information as to whether the resistance or capacity of the glass was affected by the process of annealing , or varied with time .
The specimens here referred to are numbered XXV\#151 ; XXXII , and were all made , as nearly as possible , according to a previously prescribed composition , and in the form of flasks , with long thick-walled necks , adapted for .
experiments by the direct-deflection method formerly employed .
Full particulars of the different specimens are given in Table I below .
The method of experimenting and the method employed were the same as those described in our former paper .
The chief sources of error which had to be guarded against were , as before , surface conduction , due to moisture on the surface of the glass , and leakage at other parts of the apparatus , due to the want of perfect insulation .
The most careful watch was kept throughout the experiments against the possibility of inaccuracy from these causes , and tests were made in connection with each determination to make sure that everything was working correctly .
The Resistance Experiments .
Only a few days before the meeting of the Royal Society at which the paper referred to above was read , a rough test was made of the resistance of a flask ( XXVII below ) made for us by Messrs. Powell and Sons , which had approximately the same composition as Specimen XXI , the potash , however , being replaced by soda .
It will be seen by a reference to our former table of results , that XXI was a lead-potash glass of very high specific resistance , certainly above 18000 x 1010 at 130 ' C. It was anticipated from our experiments that the substitution of soda for the potash in this glass would very greatly diminish the specific resistance , and it was stated when the paper was read that this conclusion had been verified .
More accurate determinations made since that time have confirmed this result , as will be seen by a comparison of Table I with the table given in the former paper .
While XXI had the resistance at about 130 ' C. quoted above , the specific resistance of XXVII at about the same temperature was only 136 x 1010 j so that the substitution of soda for potash in the composition of the glass diminishes the resistance of the glass to i-Stf of its former amount .
The influence of the substitution of soda for potash is still more clearly brought out by a comparison of XXIX with XXXI , and XXX with XXXII .
Specimens XXIX and XXX are lead-potash glasses , On the Electrical Properties of Different Kinds of Glass .
199 XXX and XXXII lead-soda glasses , in which the amount of soda is nearly equivalent chemically to the potash in XXIX and XXX respectively .
Reference to Table I will show that in both cases the potash glasses have very much higher resistances than the soda glasses .
Both XXI and XXVII were lead glasses ; but in the previous paper a glass was discussed which was made by Messrs. Schott and Co. , and was composed mainly of barium oxide and alumina in combination with silica and boron trioxide .
This , which we shall call the Jena barium glass , had a very high resistance , one quite unmeasurable , indeed , within the range of temperatures covered by the experiments .
Moreover , it was found that the inductive capacity in a plate of this glass was exceedingly low , and that the glass showed little or no effects of dielectric polarisation .
It was thought that it might be of interest to find whether the high resistance of this glass was associated with the presence of the large percentage of barium oxide .
Accordingly , further experiments have been made on flasks of barium-potash glass manufactured by Messrs. Powell and Sons .
This glass is numbered XXVIII of Table I. Its resistance is very low in comparison with that of either the lead-potash glass or the Jena barium glass , which , however , it must be remembered contained no potash .
It was found to be subject to a somewhat rapid disintegration of its surface , and it probably differed in physical constitution from the Jena glass .
The Jena glass , moreover , contains a considerable quantity of boron trioxide and alumina , which are absent from the glass made by Messrs. Powell .
The presence in glass , however , of a considerable percentage of potash with lead is , as shown by XXIX and XXX , consistent with a high specific resistance .
It is interesting also to compare XXVIII and XXVI , which contain approximately the same percentage of barium and lead oxides respectively , and are otherwise very similar .
The lead glass , XXVI , contains soda , from which the barium glass , XXVIII , is free ; but in spite of this , the resistance of XXVI is about three times that of XXVIII at the same temperature .
Comparison with Ordinary Glass.\#151 ; Experiments were next made to test how the glasses of specially prescribed chemical composition , already experimented on , compared with the ordinary kinds of glass used in the construction of apparatus .
A common lime glass , XXV , and common lead glass , XXVI , were examined .
The resistances of both of these were low ; that of XXV was low in comparison with the resistance of any other glass in the table.* As has been pointed out , * It may be noticed here that the first experiments on the electrical properties of specimens of glass , which were afterwards subjected to chemical analysis , seem to be those described in Mr. T. Gray 's paper , c Roy .
Soc. Proc. , * vol. 34 , p. 199 .
The analyses of the specimens ( which were of glasses used for different purposes in the arts ) were made with great care by Professor Divers , of Tokio .

however , the resistance of XXYI considerably exceeded that of the barium glass , XXVIII .
Effect of Annealing.\#151 ; The last four specimens mentioned in Table I ( XXIX\#151 ; XXXII ) were experimented on to find the effect of annealing on the resistance of glass .
It is well known that in most conductors , especially pure metals , the effect of annealing is to diminish the specific resistance .
XXIX and XXX were specimens of Messrs. Powell 's lead-potash glass .
Of these , XXIX and XXXI were carefully annealed in the usual way by Messrs. Powell : XXX and XXXII were left in the unannealed state .
The results are given side by side in Table I , and show that the effect of annealing glass is very greatly to increase its specific resistance .
In the case of XXX and XXXII , the lead-soda glasses , the specific resistance has been raised to three times its former value .
Annealed glass is therefore a much better insulator than unannealed glass .
Variation of Resistance with Time.\#151 ; The question of variation of resistance with time has been investigated by testing flasks , which had been set apart for the purpose , at intervals of about six months .
The results are shown in Table II .
XXI , XXVII , and XXVIII have had their resistances determined three times , and so far no change has disclosed itself .
As noticed above , the surface of the glass XXVIII seems to become disintegrated in course of time ; for the surface , which was originally cleaned till quite clear , has gradually acquired a milky appearance , and is now quite opaque .
The Capacity Experiments .
The specific inductive capacity of the glass of these flasks was determined by the method described in our former paper , and the results are shown in Table I. It will be seen that the specific inductive capacity of Powell 's lead-soda glass , XXVII , is rather low in comparison with that of the corresponding lead-potash glass , XXI , which was about 8 .
It is noteworthy , however , that the lead-soda glass was free from the dielectric polarisation effects which were so troublesome in the case of XXI .
Of the glasses discussed in the present paper , XXVI , one of the ordinary glasses experimented on , was the only one that showed dielectric polarisation conspicuously .
No trouble from dielectric polarisation was experienced with Nos. XXIX\#151 ; XXXII , so that annealing does not cause any marked differences in the " electric absorption " of the glass .

201 Measurement of Residual Twist of Glass Fibres .
The object of these experiments was to compare fibres of the glasses , on which the electrical experiments already described had been carried out , as regards imperfection of their torsional elasticity .
The figure shows a sketch of the apparatus used .
A long cylindrical glass tube ( a ) , about 23 inches in length and 2 inches in diameter , was fixed permanently in a vertical position in a wooden frame , as indicated in the diagram .
A tightly-fitting cork closed the upper end of the tube , and through a narrow slit in this passed a rectangular piece of copper foil , from the centre of the lower edge of which projected a short tag of the foil .
This tag was quite rigid , and carried attached to it with shellac cement the glass fibre , care being taken that the fibre was so placed that it hung vertically along the axis of the tube , when the cork was fixed in position .
The lower end of the fibre was attached in a similar manner to a cross-piece , c , weighing about 1 gramme , and having a length of about If inches .
The fibre was attached to the upper end of the cross , and to the lower end was fixed a small mirror .
The lower end of the glass tube fitted into a groove cut in a wooden sole-plate , capable of being rotated about a vertical axis , which coincided as nearly as possible with the axis of the tube , that is , with the position of the fibre .
Two brass pins were fixed vertically at two points in the sole-plate within the tube , and , projecting upwards , stood one on one side the other on the other side of the horizontal arm of the cross-piece .
By turning the sole-plate round , any required twist could be given to the fibre , since the tube was held fast in its supporting frame .
A lamp and scale set in front of the mirror enabled the position of the lower end of the fibre to be observed .

After fixing the fibre and allowing the arrangement to stand undisturbed for a day or two to allow the cement to harden , the scale was placed in position with its ends at equal distances from the mirror .
The zero position of the spot of light on the scale was observed , and the sole-plate turned round to give a total turning of the lower end of the fibre relatively to the upper of 360 ' .
The couple was kept applied for thirty seconds , and then taken off gradually without any jerking of the fibre .
This prevented torsional oscillation of the fibre after the removal of the couple .
In fifteen seconds after the removal of the couple a reading of the position of the spot of light was taken .
From this the angular deflection of the lower end of the fibre was obtained , and the angle so measured , divided by the length of the fibre , gave the residual twist .
The following table gives the results in radians per centimetre of the length of the fibre x 104 .
The diameter of the fibre was found by weighing a known length of it , and calculating from the known density of the glass .

But since XXI to XXIII were glasses whose resistances were too high for measurement , it was of course impossible to draw any numerical conclusion on the point without examining more specimens .
A very little reflection , however , showed that no exact comparison was possible from this point of view , as the residual torsion was no doubt influenced in a very marked degree by the immediate previous history of the fibre .
But it is noteworthy that the residual twist is very low ih the case of the Jena barium glass and in Messrs. Powell 's lead-potash glasses , viz. , in XXIII , XXIX , XXX , and is abnormally high for the two ordinary glasses , XXV , XXVI .
On the Electrical Properties of Different Kinds of Glass .
203 It was found that for the same fibre the same twisting couple produced the same residual twist , provided the two determinations were not made in immediate succession .
The rate at which the residual twist came out was very great immediately after the twisting couple had been taken off ; and this rate diminished rapidly as the spot of light approached its zero position on the scale .
Chemical Composition of the Specimens of Glass .
The results of the chemical analyses made for the different specimens are stated briefly in Table I , which affords a conspectus of all the results of the experiments now described .
The following notes regarding the different specimens , containing approximate empirical formulae for their composition , are , however , set down here .
