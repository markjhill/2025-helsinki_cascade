( Abstract , , ) The paper gives an account of a series of experiments on the viscosity of water made with revolving cylinders .
The cylinders were coaxial , and the fluid was placed in the annulus between them .
Special precautions were taken to eliminate the effect of the terminal conditions at the lower end of the annulus , with the result that the motion of the fluid in the annulus was practically the same as it would have been in an annulus of infinite length .
One of the cylinders was driven at known and constant speeds , and the moment transmitted to the other cylinder , which was suspended by a torsion wire , was measured for each speed .
In some of the experiments the inner cylinder was suspended on the torsion wire , and the outer one revolved , and in others these conditions were reversed .
Two sets of cylinders were used , giving annuli of one inch and half an inch width respectively .
When the outer cylinder was the revolving one , it was found that , up to a certain speed , the transmitted moment increased as the first power of the speed .
Above this speed there was a region where that moment was indeterminate between certain limits , and varied suddenly from one value do another at uncertain intervals .
At higher speeds again the moment was perfectly determinate , but varied as a power of the speed higher than the square .
When the inner cylinder was the revolving one , none of these variations in the character of the function representing moment in terms of speed were observed .
At not even the lowest speeds was the moment proportional to the first power of the velocity , but the whole series agreed fairly with the equation , moment = constant x velocity to the power of 1*8 .
Returning to the experiments where the outer cylinder revolved , the coefficient of viscosity of water deduced from these experiments at speeds where the moment was proportional to the , first power of the speed , was greater than Poiseuille 's value , and the difference was greater with the one inch than with the half inch annulus .
In some former experiments of the same kind where an annulus of about 0'2 in .
was used , the value of the coefficient of viscosity obtained was very nearly the same as Poiseuille 's .
Taken together , these experiments tend to show that there must be more than two forms of flow possible for a viscous fluid subjected to shearing force , and that long before anything like permanent eddying Presents .

] is set up , the motion may depart from the purely lamellar one , which appears to hold in capillary tubes , although in the motion in question the resistance is still on the whole proportional to the first power of the speed .
