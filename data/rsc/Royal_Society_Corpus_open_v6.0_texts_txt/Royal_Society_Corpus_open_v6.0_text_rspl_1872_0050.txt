( Abstract .
) In this paper is given an account of a series of observations made in the Observatory of Birr Castle , in further prosecution of a shorter and less carefully conducted investigation , as regards many details , which forms the subject of two former communications* to the Royal Society .
The observations were first corrected for change of the moon 's distance from the place of observation and change of phase during the continuance of each night 's work , and thus a curve , whose ordinates represented the scale-readings ( corrected ) and whose abscissas represented the corresponding altitudes , was obtained for each night 's work .

Mr. E. A. Schafer on the [ Apr. 3 , all these , a single curve and table for reducing all the observations to the same zenith-distance was obtained , which proved to be nearly , but not quite , the same as that found by Professor Seidel for the light of the stars .
By employing the table thus deduced , and also reducing the heat-determinations obtained on the various nights for change of distance of the sun , a more accurate phase-curve was deduced , indicating a more rapid increase of the radiant heat on approaching full moon than was given by the formula previously employed , but still not so much as Professor Zollner 's gives for the moon 's light .
By employing Laplace 's formula for the extinction of light in our atmosphere , the heat-efEect in terms of the scale-readings was deduced , and an approximation to the height of the atmosphere attempted .
Prom a series of simultaneous measurements of the moon 's heat and light at intervals during the partial eclipse of November 14 , 1872 , when clouds did not interfere , it was found that the heat and light diminish nearly if not quite proportionally , the minimum for both occurring at or very near the middle of the eclipse , when they were reduced to about half what they were before and after contact with the penumbra .

( Abstract .
) After premising that , owing to the rapidity with which changes set in after death , the subject in question can only properly be worked out whilst the muscular fibres are still living , the author proceeds to give the result of his investigations of the tissue in this condition .
The animal employed was the common large water-beetle , the muscles of the legs being taken .
These were examined entirely without addition , being either teased out upon a glass slide in the ordinary way and covered with thin glass , or else prepared upon the latter , which was then inverted over a ring of putty after the method introduced by Strieker .
The author describes a muscular fibre as consisting^ of a groun substance appearing at first sight-to be formed of two distinct substances ( the one dim , the other bright in aspect , which are arranged in alternating disks disposed in successive series , with their planes at right angles to
