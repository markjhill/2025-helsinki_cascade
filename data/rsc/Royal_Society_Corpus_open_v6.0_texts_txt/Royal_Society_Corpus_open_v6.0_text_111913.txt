The discovery by Dr. Lamont of a " decennial " period in the range of the solar diurnal variation of magnetic declination , naturally leads to the question whether a similar law may not exist for the lunar diurnal variation ; the question is also of importance in connexion with the theory of the cause of these variations .
The following results for the range of the lunar diurnal variation were obtained from the discussion whose conclusions were given in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , vol. x. p. 475 .

4-0 It appears from these values that the range of the lunar diurnal period varies from year to year according to the same law ( nearly ) as the range of the solar diurnal period ; and we may conclude that the range of lunar diurnal variation obeys the " decennial " law .
It is well known that the declination needle obeys two diurnal laws due to the solar action the first of these governs the movement of the north end of the needle from east to west and from west to east , the second determines a superposed movement resulting from the relative amounts of displacement of the needle from its normal position at each hour ; the latter is usually termed the diurnal law of disturbance .
In order to obtain this law and the values of the disturbance , the quantities do , dl , d ... .
( Proceedings , vol. x. p. 477 ) are summed for each hour and the means are taken .
No similar investigation , as far as I am aware , has as yet been undertaken for the lunar diurnal variation .
I have now arrived at the following conclusions in the discussion for this object of six years ' observations of magnetic declination made at the Trevandrum Observatory .

were taken ; these differences , as in the case of the similar investigation for the solar laws , represent the disturbance at each hour-angle of the moon ; and when the means of the second differences are taken , the law of the lunar diurnal disturbance will be obtained , if any such law exist .
The small range of the regular lunar diurnal variation , and the derangement produced by the larger disturbances , the effects of which cannot be eliminated in short series of observations , would render identical results from different groups of years iraprobable , especially if the range of the variation to be determined be small .
The following conclusions , however , seem sufficiently confirmed by the discussion of different groups of observations to be accepted .
There is a lunar-diurnal law of disturbance which , from the mean of six years ' observation , consists of a Principal maximum 5 hours before the moon passes the upper meridian .
Principal minimum near the moon 's passage of the lower meridian .
Secondary maximum 6 hours after the passage of the upper meridian .
Secondary minimum 1 hour after the passage of the upper meridian .
When the results for each year are compared , the principal maximum and minimum are always shown distinctly ; but the values and epochs of the secondary maximum and minimum vary , and that so irregularly , that in the mean for the three years 1857-59 the existence of either is doubtful , only the principal maximum and minimum being well-marked .
In order to determine if the law varied with season , means of groups for quarters of the year were obtained ; means also for the groups of half-years , October to March and April to September , were taken .
As the results for the quarters forming each half-year agreed with each other , and that for the half-year which contained them , the following conclusions may be accepted as probably true .
Half-year October to Marwch Principal maximum , 5 hours before the moon 's passage of the upper meridian .
Principal minimum , 3 hours before the moon 's passage of the lower meridian .
Secondary maximum , 5 hours after the moon 's passage of the upper meridian .
Secondary minimum , 1 hour after the moon 's passage of the upper meridian .
Talf-year 4pril to September .
Maximunm , 41 hours before the moon 's passageof the upper meridian Minimum , at the passage of the lower meridian .
In the case of the half-year including the June solstice , the secondary points disappear ; this also is the case for each of the quarters forming the half-year .
It may be due to this and the preponderance of the disturbance in one half of any given year , that the mean for the whole year shows distinctly or indistinctly the secondary points : the question , however , of the secondary points will be considered hereafter in another discussion including a longer series of observations .

1'59 I have not at hand the mean solar disturbances for each year , and cannot therefore compare the two ; it will appear , however , from a comparison with the ranges of the solar diurnal variation ( which are known to follow nearly the same law as the law of mean disturbance ) , that the mean lunar disturbance obeys the same law as the mean solar disturbance , and that the former is probably dependent upon the latter .
