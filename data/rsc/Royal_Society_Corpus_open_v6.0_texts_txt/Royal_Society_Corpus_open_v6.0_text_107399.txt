Observation of the I1inter Solstice of 1812 , with the AMurat Circle at Greenwich .
By John Pond , Esq. Astronomer Royal , F.R.S. Read February 25 , 1813 .
PHE weather this year at the period of the solstice was peculiarly unfavourable for astronomical observation ; however , in the course of the month , I obtained nine observations of the sun ; one of these proved defective , the result of the other eight , accompanies this communication .
In my observation of the summer solstice , it will be seen that I assumed the arc ZP equal 38gยง 1 ' 2 " 1 5 ; by subsequent observation I conceive that I have somewhat improved this quantity , which I now assume 38ยง 31 ' 21",5 , as resulting from 12o observations of Polaris .
The observation of the summer solstice thus corrected will give the mean obliquity of the ecliptic for January i , 1813 , 23ยง 27 ' 5",50 , and the winter solstice 23ยง 27 ' 47",35 .
There can be no doubt but this small discordance might easily be reconciled by a slight modification of BRADLEY'S refractions , and perhaps ultimately it may be necessary to have recourse to this theory for its explanation ; but I am unwilling to do this hastily , being now occupied in making an extensive series of observations of circumpolar stars , with a view of determining , if possible , whether BRADLEY'S mean refraction does , or does not , require alteration.-As I propose making the discordance of the solstices the subject of a sepaR 9 rate paper , I shall not add any thing farther on the subject , excepting a recommendation to astronomers , to deduce their refractions from circumpolar stars altogether , and then examine the solstices with those refractions , and by no means to make the coincidence of the solstices a required proof of their accuracy .
Note .
In the annexed computation the reduction to the solstice is computed from the observed right ascension of the sun , by this means the errors of the tables being avoided , observations at a considerable distance ( even some weeks from the solstice ) may be employed , particularly in the winter season , when the uncertainty from refraction is greater than the error which may be probably introduced into this part of the calculation .
