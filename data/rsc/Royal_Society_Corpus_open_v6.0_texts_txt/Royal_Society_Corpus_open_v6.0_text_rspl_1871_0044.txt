187 and each part acquires an independent existence .
These parts again divide , and the process of subdivision is carried on until they appear to be nothing more than cells , which have a swimming-power so great as to pass over the field of the microscope with rapidity .
After twelve or eighteen months all the vibrios disappear and are replaced by microzyms , either in motion or at rest .
If these microzyms are placed in a solution of fresh albumen , vibrios are abundantly developed .
The apparent explanation of this fact is that m the fresh albumen they have all the circumstances favourable to their growth and reproduction , while the putrid albumen has become so completely modified as to be incapable of affording them the requisite conditions for reproduction .
I may also notice that at the same time a deposit has taken place which , under the microscope , appears to consist of shoals of small particles of matter which have no life .
The solution has now become perfectly clear , possesses considerable refractive power , and has lost the property of becoming coagulated by heat .
The albumen solution does not emit a putrid odour until after the formation of the above-mentioned deposit , and the amount of odour is in direct ratio to the number of vibrios present .
I remarked during the investigation the presence of several other forms of animalcules which contribute to the decomposition and putrefaction of proteine substances , the description of which will be found in the original memoir .

( Abstract .
) To carry out this series of experiments , small test-tubes were thoroughly cleansed , and heated to dull redness .
Into each was placed 26 grammes of a solution of albumen containing one part of white of egg to four parts of pure distilled water , prepared as described in my paper on protoplasmic life .
To this was added one thousandth , or *026 gramme , of each of the substances the action of which I desired to study .
The reasons why I employed one part in a thousand are two-fold .
First , the employment of larger proportions would , in some instances , have coagulated the albumen ; secondly , it would have increased the difficulty of observing the relative powers of the most efficacious antiseptics in preventing the development of the germs of putrefaction or decay .
A drop was taken from each of the tubes , and examined under a microscope having a magnifying-power of 800 diameters .
This operation was repeated daily with the contents of each tube for thirty-nine days , and from 188 Dr. F. Crace-Calvert on Prevention of Putrefaction .

29 , time to time for eighty days .
Daring this time the tubes were kept in a room the temperature of which did not vary more than 3 degrees , namely , from 12'5 ' C. to 15'5 ' C. In order the better to show the influence of the antiseptics used , I examined two specimens of the same solution at the same time , one of which was kept in the laboratory , the other in the open air .
A marked difference was observed in the result , the one kept outside becoming impregnated with animal life in less than half the time required by the other , while as many vibrios were developed in six days in the tube kept outside as were developed in thirty days in the tube in the laboratory .

of Fungi .
Vibrios .
None None None None None None None In comparing the results stated in the above Table , the substances can be classed under four distinct heads , viz.:\#151 ; those which prevent the development of protoplasmic and fungus-life ; those which prevent the production of vibrio-life , but do not prevent the appearance of fungus-life ; those which permit the production of vibrio-life , but prevent the appearance of fungus-life ; and those which do not prevent the appearance of either protoplasmic or fungus-life .
The first class contains only two substances , carbolic and cresylic acids .
In the second class , also , there are only two compounds , chloride of zinc and bichloride of mercury .
In the third class there are five substances , lime , sulphate of quinine , pepper , turpentine , and prussic acid .
In the fourth class is included the remaining twenty-five substances .
The acids , while not preventing the production of vibrio-life , have a marked tendency to promote the growth of fungus-life .
This is especially noticeable in the case of sulphuric and acetic acids .
Alkalies , on the contrary , are not favourable to the production of fungus-life , but promote the development of vibrios .
The chlorides of zinc and mercury , while completely preventing the development of animalcules , do not entirely prevent fungus-life ; but I would call special attention to the intereS ' ing and unexpected results obtained in 190 Dr. F. Crace-Calvert on Prevention of Putrefaction .
[ Feb. 29 , the cases of chlorine and bleaching-powder .
When used in the proportion above stated they do not prevent the production of vibrio-life .
In order to do so they must be employed in excess ; and I have asceitained , by a distinct series of experiments , that large quantities of bleaching-powder are necessary .
I found that part of the carbon was converted into carbonic acid , and part of the nitrogen was liberated .
If , however , the bleaching-powder be not in excess , the animal matter will still readily enter into putrefaction .
The assumption on which its employment as a disinfectant has been based , namely , that the affinity of the chlorine for hydrogen is so great as to destroy the germs , is erroneous .
The next class to which I would call attention is the tar series , where neither the carbolic nor the cresylic acid fluids gave any signs of vibrionic or fungus-life during the whole eighty days during which the experiments were conducted .
The results obtained with sulphate of quinine , pepper , and turpentine , deserve notice .
None of them prevent the development of vibrio-life ; but sulphate of quinine and pepper entirely prevent the appearance of fungi .
This fact , together with the remarkable efficacy of sulphate of quinine in intermittent fever , would lead to the supposition that this form of disease is due to the introduction into the system of fungus-germs ; and this is rendered the more probable , if we bear in mind that these fevers are prevalent only in low marshy situations , where vegetable decay abounds , and never appear to any extent in dry climates , even in the midst of dense populations , where ventilation is bad and putrefaction is rife .
The results obtained in the case of charcoal show that it possesses no antiseptic properties , but that it prevents the emanation of putrid gases , owing to its extraordinary porosity , which condenses the gases , thus bringing them into contact with the oxygen of the atmosphere , which is simultaneously condensed .
The above results have been confirmed by a second series .
A series of experiments was also undertaken , substituting gelatine for albumen , and was continued for forty-seven days .
Vibrios appeared in two days in the standard gelatine-solution , and bacteria after four or five ; and during the whole time of the experiment , life was far more abundant than in the albumen-solution .
A distinct putrid smell was emitted after twenty-six days .
With bleaching-powder it took twenty days for life to appear , instead of seven , as in the case of albumen ; while at no time during the twenty-seven days which remained was life abundant .
No putrid odour was emitted ; but a mouldy one could be detected on the thirtieth day .
With chlorine-solution vibrio-life was observed only after forty days ; no putrid nor mouldy smell was given off at any time .
The protosulphate of iron gave , with this solution , results quite different from those with albumen , in which , it will be remembered , vibrios appeared in seven days , and fungi after fifteen ; whilst with gelatine neither proto187.2 .

plasmic nor fungus-life appeared during the time the experiments were continued .
Another substance , arsenious acid , also presented a marked difference in its action in the two solutions ; for although with albumen twenty-two days elapsed before vibrios were present , and eighteen before fungi , with gelatine animal life appeared after two days , and at no time did any fungi exist .
The effects of the other substances with gelatine were so similar to those with albumen , that it is unnecessary to state them here .

, ( Abstract .
) This series of experiments was undertaken as being complementary to those described in my last paper , and consisted in adding to a solution of albumen , swarming with microscopic life , one-thousandth part of the sub-# stances already enumerated in that paper , and examining the results pro-n duced immediately after the addition of the substances , and after one , six , and sixteen days ; but in this abstract only the results obtained in the first s and last cases will be noticed .
The solutions were placed in test-tubes similar to those described in my last paper .
0 The experiments were begun on the 20th Sept. 1871 , the solutions being kept at a temperature of 15'-18 ' C. In the standard solution the amount of life and putrescence increased during the whole of the time .
The first class includes those substances which completely destroyed the locomotive power of the vibrios immediately , and completely prevented their regaining it during the time the experiments were conducted:\#151 ; Cresylic acid .
The second class contains those compounds which nearly destroyed the locomotive power of all the vibrios 'present when added , and afterwards only one or two could be seen swimming about in each field:\#151 ; Carbolic acid , sulphate of quinine , chloride of zinc , and sulphuric acid .
The third class are those which acted injuriously on the vibrios on their addition , leaving only a small number retaining the power of swimming , but which allowed the vibrios gradually to increase in number , the fluid , nevertheless , containing less life after sixteen days than the standard putrid albumen-solution:\#151 ; Picric acid and sulpho-carbolate of zinc .
The fourth class includes those substances which acted injuriously at first , but permitted the vibrios to regain their former locomotive power ,
