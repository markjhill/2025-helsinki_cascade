" On Correlation of certain External Parts of Palomon serratus."By H. Thompson .
Communicated by Professor Weldon , F.R.S. Received January 25 , 1894 .
In 1890 Professor Weldon published ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 47 , p. 445 ) the results of measurements of certain organs of the common shrimp , with a view to establish by accurate data the degree of variation existing in those organs .
In a later paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 51 , p. 2 ) he determined , by Mr. Galton 's method there described , the degree of correlation existing between four organs of the same animal , and in a recent paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proe .
, ' vol. 54 , p. 318 ) similar determinations have been worked out by him for certain organs of Carcinus moenas .
Some time ago it was suggested to me by Professor Weldon that I should determine the values of correlated variations in a number of parts of the hard exoskeleton of the common prawn ( serratus ) .
Accordingly , 1000 adult female prawns , chosen at random , were procured from Plymouth and measured .
Twenty-two measurements were made of each prawn , except in the case of two or three measurements which were made on part only of the sample .
The parts measured were the following :\#151 ; 1894 .

Similar measurement for the left side .
Measurements I to III were made with compasses , and may be regarded as accurate to within about 0'5 mm. , except No. I , the body length , which is somewhat less accurate .
The remaining measurements were made under a microscope , and are accurate to within 0'05 mm. , For the purpose of comparison the measurements are all expressed in terms of the body length , which is taken as = 1000 .

The numerals refer to the numbers of the measurements .
Out of the 1000 prawns seven had a deformed rostrum , and six had a deformed telson .
In several of the numerical results set out below these thirteen animals have been excluded because their deformities affected the body length to such an extent as to give a wholly fictitious value to the reduced measurements of the other organs .
The existence of a long rostrum in the prawn has proved a serious hindrance , since its length in proportion to that of the body is very variable , and hence those parts in which the rostrum is an element present a degree of correlation which is very slight , and render impossible any real comparison with the corresponding parts in the shrimp , for instance , which has scarcely any rostrum at all .
Selection was made of the female prawn as being larger than the male , and therefore more convenient for .
the purposes of measurement .
The largest measured 111 mm. in total body length , the smallest 61*5 mm. All the measurements having been reduced , as above stated , to fractions of the total body length , they were next arranged in order of magnitude for each organ separately , and in almost every case the values were found to range themselves with a fair degree of symmetry around the median value , and to correspond with more or less accuracy to calculated probability curves .
In one case , however ( measurement No. VII ) , the curve presented features of asymmetry which have been investigated by Professor Karl Pearson ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 54 , p. 329 ) .
The next step was to determine the degree of correlation betwTeen various pairs of the organs measured .
The method used was that originally suggested by Mr. Galton , and sufficiently explained by Professor Weldon in his paper above referred to , so that it is unnecessary to repeat it here .
The following table gives the value of " Galton 's function " for 56 pairs of organs :\#151 ; 1894 .

Next , we observe that a strong correlation obtains between the terga of adjacent abdominal segments ; their values range between 058 and 071 ; while those of segments that do not lie next each other range between 047 and 061 .
A considerable fall occurs in the degree of correlation between the telson and the segments of the abdomen\#151 ; it varies from 026 to 029 , except in the case of the 6th abdominal segment , which lies next to the telson , when the value rises to 051 .
It is interesting to note that Professor Weldon found the corresponding value for the telson and 6th abdominal tergum in the 238 Mr. H. Thompson .
On of [ Mar. 1 , common shrimp from Plymouth to be only O il .
Perhaps this difference may in part be accounted for by the fact that the prawn is essentially a swimmer , while the shrimp , in confinement at aDy rate , spends most of its time standing or crawling on the surface of the sea-bottom .
The prawn is certainly a more powerful and rapid swimmer .
It swims backwards , propelling itself by means of the hinder part of the abdomen , the terminal portion of which is fanshaped , the fan consisting of the telson and the exopodites of the last pair of appendages .
This hinder half of the abdomen starts from the extended position , and is brought , with a rapid stroke , up under the fore part of the abdomen and thorax , pushing the water before it , and so propelling the animal backwards .
The 3rd segment acts as the hinge of the propeller , and it may be assumed that the exoskeleton is here exposed to the greatest strain , for here we find the highest degree of correlation , as is shown by the following figures:\#151 ; Index of correlation between terga of abdominal segments 1 and 2 = 0'58 .
2 " 3 = 0-70 .
3 " 4 = 0-71 .
4 " 5 = 0-62 .
5 " 6 = 0-57 .
6 and telson = 0'51 .
Professor Weldon determined three other values in the shrimp , viz. , the relations between carapace length and post-spinous portion of carapace , between carapace length and tergum of abdomen vi .
, and between carapace length and telson .
Their values were ( in Plymouth specimens ) 081 , 009 , and 0T8 respectively .
It is not possible to institute a comparison with exactly the same organs in the prawn , as , owing to the great variation in the length of the rostrum , no appreciable degree of correlation exists between the whole carapace including rostrum ( measurement Ho. Ill ) and the other organs .
But if we take measurement Ho. II ( from orbit to hinder edge of carapace ) as an approximate equivalent to the carapace measurements of the shrimp , we find in the prawn the corresponding values are 0'59 , 059 , and 040 .
The difference in the first measurement , viz. , shrimp , 0'81 ; prawn , 0'59 , may be accounted for by the fact that the dorsal spines probably do not correspond in nature or function in the two animals .
The shrimp has but one median dorsal spine , situated far forward ; the prawn has a row of them .
But why the prawn should exhibit a so much higher degree of correlation between the carapace and the two terminal segments of its body than the shrimp is not , I think , readily to be ex- 1894 .

The subjoined table furnishes the necessary data for constructing approximately the curve of each of the separate organs .
The Roman numerals in the first column refer to the organ described above under the corresponding numbers on p. 235 ; the second column contains the number of animals out of the whole sample of 1000 in which a measurement of the particular organ was made ; the third column contains the median value ; and the fourth the " probable error " or quartile deviation from the median of each organ expressed in thousandths of the body length ; the fifth and sixth columns refer to the same animals after subtracting from their number thirteen individuals in which the rostrum or telson was deformed , and for these the arithmetical mean and probable error ( obtained by finding the mean error and multiplying it by 0-845 ) are given .
All the figures in columns 3 to 6 , inclusive , represent thousandths of the body length , except those standing against organ No. I ( the body length itself ) , which represent millimetres .
