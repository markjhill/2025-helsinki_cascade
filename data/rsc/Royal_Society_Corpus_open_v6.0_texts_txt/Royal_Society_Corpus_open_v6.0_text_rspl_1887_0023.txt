( Abstract .
) The paper consists , as its title implies , of a record of experiments relating to the functions of the cerebral cortex , a subject upon which the authors have been engaged during three years .
The experiments have been entirely made upon monkeys .
After describing the methods employed , the general results of excitation and of extirpation of various parts of the cerebral hemispheres on one or both sides are given , and the cases in which the method of ablation has been employed are then recorded in detail , the symptoms observed during life and the condition of the brain after death being systematically noted .
Each case is illustrated by one or more drawings , showing the exact condition of the brain post mortem .
In some instances sections of the brain are also represented .
The paper includes also a topographical plan of the excitable or motor region of the cortex cerebri .

The duration of phosphorescence after cessation of the exciting cause is known to vary within wide limits of time , from several hours in the case of the phosphorescent sulphides to a minute fraction of a VOL. xlii .
