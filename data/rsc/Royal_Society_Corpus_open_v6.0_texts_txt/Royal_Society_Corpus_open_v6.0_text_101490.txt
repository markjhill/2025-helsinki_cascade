Some particulars , communicated from foreign parts , concerning the Permanent Spott in Jupiter ; and a Contest between two Artists about Optic Glasses , &amp;c. Eustachio de Divinis ( saith the Informer , ) has written a large Letter , wherein he pretends , that the Permanent Spot in jupiter hath been first of all discovered with his Glasses ; and that the P. Gotignies is the first that hath thence deduced the Motion of Jupiter about his Axis ; and that Signior Cassini opposed it at first ; to whom the said Gotignies wrote a letter of complaint thereupon .
See Numb. I. of these Transactions ; by the date whereof it will appear , that that Spot was observed in England , a good while before any such thing was so much as heard of .
The same Eustachio pretends likewise , that his great Glasses excel those of Campani ; and that in all the trials , made with them , they have performed better ; and that Campani was not willing to do , what was necessary for well comparing the one with the other .
viz. To put equal Eyeglasses in them , or to exchange the same Glasses .
The said Divini affirms also , that he hath found a way to know , whether an Object glass be good or not , only by looking upon it , without trying .
This would be of good use , especially if it should extend so far as to discern the goodness of such a glass , whilst it is yet on the Cement .
