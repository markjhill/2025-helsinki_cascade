An Experiment of Signior Fracassati upon Blood grown cold .
When any blood is become cold in a dish , that part which is beneath the superficles appears much blacker , than that on the top ; and it is vulgarly said , that this black part of the blood is Melancholy blood , and men are wont to make use of this example to show that the Melancholy humor as it is called , enters with the 3 others into the composition of the blood .
But Signior Fracassati maintains , that this blackish colour comes from hence , that the blood , which is underneath , is not exposed to the Air , and not from a mixture of Melancholy : to prove which he assures , that upon its being exposed to the Air it changes colour , and becomes of a florid red .
An Experiment as easy to try , as it is curious .
