There is a different arrangement for holding the minor weight , which the engraver has failed in representing so well as the rest .
Plate 9 shows also a variety of milled screw-heads , each of which has of course a purpose ; but as neither of them , except one by which the lower weight is turned round , has any part in the observations such as they are described above , but only in ultimate manipulations which it is unnecessary to dwell upon here , they may be regarded as ornaments .
It will be noticed that the collimator is removed , and one of the side supports is supposed broken off , to discover the minor weight ; which last , with its mirror and magnet bar , is seen turned through 30 ' or 40 ' into an oblique position .
At the same level and ' outside the chamber are seen arms , one of which resembles a cross .
These are the guides for two magnets which have been removed .
Their intended purpose is mentioned by Broun in his description .
The pillar alongside the shaft is a case for a thermometer , the bulb of which is within the chamber .

In former communications which I have had the honour of submitting to the Royal Society , I have given determinations of the coefficients of expansion by heat of the chloride and bromide of silver and the iodide of mercury between 0 ' C. and the fusing point ; also determinations of the coefficients of expansion and contraction of the iodide of silver , and of certain chlorobromiodides of silver .
( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 25 , pp. 280-303 , and vol. 28 , p. 284 .
) The iodide of lead , and an alloy of iodide of lead with iodide of silver , were thought to be very suitable substances for a continuation of these experiments .
The following pages describe the results obtained .
The experimental method was precisely similar to that before described , but the expansion apparatus was rendered more delicate by several notable changes suggested during the course of the former experiments .
It is unnecessary to describe this apparatus again ( for description vide " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 25 , p. 281\#151 ; 2 ) , but it may be remembered that a homogeneous rod of the substance under examination is connected with a series of levers which multiply 5,382 times , while the value of the movements is estimated by a micrometer screw reading to 50000 of an inch .
The following alterations were made mainly with a view of reducing the resistance by diminishing friction , and thus adding to the sensibility of the apparatus : 1 .
The wooden base N ( fig- 1 ) was replaced by a massive stone On the Coefficients of Expansion , fyc .
block , to which the box containing the levers and the upright carrying the micrometer head were firmly bolted .
This block with figs. 1 , 2 , 3 is a reprint from " Proceedings , " vol. 25 , p. 280-282 , where all are described .
2 .
The levers S , U ( fig. 2 ) were reduced in weight .
3 .
The spring X ( fig. 2 ) was removed , as it was found that the recoil of the helical spring Z was quite sufficient to bring the index back to zero , and the presence of Y served only to increase the resistance and general strain .
4 .
The vertical axis X ( figs. 1 and 3 ) was no longer allowed to work in the upper confining plate of the framework h , but it was caused to turn lightly on a bent .arm above , while below it rested upon a slightly hollowed ruby .
5 .
The steel chain W communicating motion from the lever U to the vertical axis X , which carries the index , was shortened and caused to wind upon the barrel in such a manner that when unwound to the Mr. G. F. Rodwell .
extent of half a single coil , it moved the index through its entire range , viz. , from 0 ' to 180 ' of arc .
By this means any possibility of the chain doubling upon itself was obviated .
6 .
But perhaps the most important changes were the removal of stuffing boxes I and the rods H from the trough F , and the substitution of levers working over the rim of the trough ; and the suspension of the rod of substance under examination in a cradle between the levers .
This was effected in the following manner:\#151 ; Section through the trough longitudinally , showing the mode of suspension of the bar , and the position of the levers .
A horizontal bar LL ( fig. 4 ) was supported by rods N , N , strengthened by cross bars ( not shown ) let into the stone base of the instrument ; it carried Y-shaped brass levers B , B , moving about axes at C , C ( figs. 4 and 5 ) , attached at the points A , A. F is the trough in which hot ceresine is used for heating the bar under examination , H , supported by the cradle G. Two rods I , I , which slide in holes K , K , and are capable of being held at any height by screws , support the cradle G. D is the rod ( figs. 1 and 2 ) which bears upon the lever S , and M the point of the micrometer screw .
The apparatus was standardised at frequent intervals by the use of a rod of fine homogeneous silver .
Ceresine boiling at 430 ' C. was used to heat the rods in F , and it was heated to any desired temperature by means of a Bunsen burner placed beneath , and near the centre of the trough .

Iodide of Lead.\#151 ; Pure iodide of lead was cast into rods one-third of an inch in diameter and 6 inches long .
The ends were made plane by a fine steel saw , and they were furnished with copper caps .
Great difficulty was experienced in casting the rods , owing to the brittleness of the iodide .
Slightly greased tubes of very thin German glass were used as the moulds , and as the rods would rarely slip out of the tubes the glass had usually to be chipped away along the whole length of the rod by the point of a knife .
The iodide underwent the same .changes of colour as were observed in the iodide of silver ; that is to say , it fused to a bromine-red liquid , which , when solidified , became red-brown , and , while cooling , brick-red , reddish-yellow , and , when .completely cool , orange-yellow .
Harsh noises , like those produced by bending tin , were heard during the cooling of the mass , and the fracture was highly crystalline .
Differences of opinion appear to exist as to the effect of fusing iodide of lead in the air .
In the same volume of a standard work I find two exactly contrary opinions : for it is stated , on the one hand , that the iodide if fused in contact with air gives off a part of its iodine , becoming oxyiodide of lead ; while elsewhere the iodide is classed among those which may be fused in an open vessel without \#166 ; change .
In order to set this matter at rest , 56*1690 grms. of iodide were fused in a covered porcelain crucible .
The fusion was continued Mr. G. F. Rodwell .
for eight minutes , during which the cover was three times momentarily removed .
Violet fumes of iodine escaped on each occasion , but on weighing the loss was found to amount to only *11036 per cent. Again , the mass was kept fused for four minutes , and the crucible-cover was twice removed , but the loss had only increased to " 1584 per cent. After a third fusion the total loss only amounted to " 1718 per cent. Hence it is manifest that iodide of lead may safely be fused out of contact with air , with scarcely appreciable loss .
When , however , the-crucible cover was permanently removed , the iodide rapidly decomposed .
When the iodide was heated in a current of carbonic anhydride , , it sublimed unchanged in crystals ; while if it was heated in a current of dry oxygen it rapidly decomposed , fine crystals of iodine collecting in the fore part of the tube .
The specific gravity of iodide of lead , in common with the iodides-of copper , silver , and potassium , is less than the mean specific gravity of its constituents .
Karsten found it to be 6"0282 , Boullay 6T1 , and my own determinations gave 6*12 .
The calculated specific gravity is-6*629 .
The fusing point as determined by Mr. Carnelley is 383 ' C. The coefficient of cubical expansion for 1 ' C. was found to be .00007614 for temperatures between 0 ' C. and 205 ' 0 .
It increased to .00008317 between 205 ' 0 .
and 253 ' C. Between 263 ' C. and 265 ' C. the mass expanded rapidly , with a coefficient nearly eight times greater than the previous , viz.:\#151 ; " 0006378 .
After the subsidence of this rapid expansion it no longer retained the original coefficient , but assumed one of more than double the amount , viz.:\#151 ; .000180 .
At temperatures some distance from the melting point the rod began to bend , and it became necessary to assume that this last coefficient continues to the melting point .
The expansion in passing from the solid to the liquid condition was determined by the method described in my previous paper .
On the Coefficients of Expansion , fyc .
It will be observed that the iodide of lead , as in the case of the iodide of mercury ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 28 , p. 284 ) , has three coefficients of expansion , viz.:\#151 ; ( a ) a coefficient somewhat less than that of chloride of silver up to 253 ' C. ; ( 6 ) a coefficient during 12 ' C. , nearly eight times greater than the preceding ; and ( c ) finally a coefficient somewhat more than twice as great as that between 0 ' and 253 ' C. , at temperatures above 265 ' C. Undoubtedly the iodide of lead , as in the case of the iodide of mercury , undergoes a molecular change while rapidly expanding between 253 ' and 265 ' C. , and before assuming the higher coefficient .
This is supported by the fact that the highly brittle and crystalline rod showed itself capable of bending after having undergone the rapid expansion .
It will be remembered that the iodide of silver , which is very crystalline and brittle below 145 ' C. , becomes amorphous and plastic above that temperature .
The familmr example of sulphur will also recur to the mind .
If we suppose a mass of iodide of lead to be heated from 0 C. to the melting point ( 383 ' C. ) the following will be the volumes at the respective temperatures .
Volume at 0 ' C. =1*000000 .
205 ' =1*015608 .
253 ' =1*019595 .
265 ' =1*027248 .
383 ' ( solid ) =1*048488 .
383 ' ( liquid ) =1*078080 .
The curve is shown in Table A. The specific gravity of the iodide in the molten condition is 5*6247 .
The fact that a substance may possess two or three different coefficients of expansion has apparently only been observed hitherto in the case of such substances as fusible alloy , because in determining the coefficients of solid bodies temperatures exceeding 100 ' C. have rarely been employed .
Paraffine or ceresine used as a heating medium will allow the determination of coefficients to a temperature of 300 ' C. , and , undoubtedly , many bodies when thus examined would be found to present anomalies similar to those remarked in the case of the iodides of lead and mercury .
The Lead-Silver Iodide Alloy .
Bearing in mind the peculiar nature of the coefficients of certain alloys of iodide of silver with.the chloride and bromide ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. " vol. 25 , p. 292 ) , it was thought to be advisable to determine tlfr coefficients of an alloy of iodide of lead with iodide of silver .
These bodies were accordingly fused together in the proportion of one molecule of each , viz. , PbI2.AgI .

The molten mass underwent the same changes of colour in cooling as either one of its constituents , and ultimately became a dull orange-coloured compact mass .
Although composed of two substances which are highly crystalline and brittle , the alloy was found to be hard and tenacious .
Although the constituents are coarsely crystalline in structure , the alloy is finely granular .
During the cooling of the mass it expanded with sufficient force to break the glass tube .
Harsh noises were emitted during cooling , and the whole mass was sometimes jerked from its position ; while , if held in the hand , it was felt to be agitated by strong tremors .
Mr. T. Carnelley has determined for me the melting point of the alloy , which he finds to be 350 ' C. The specific gravity is 5*923 .
By repeated digestion with large volumes of boiling water the alloy is decomposed , the iodide of lead being dissolved , while the iodide of silver remains as a dull green powder .
On examination in the expansion apparatus the alloy was found to undergo slow expansion to a temperature of 118 ' C. , then , for 6 ' C. , it simply absorbed heat without either contracting or expanding .
At 124 ' 0 .
contraction commenced , and continued at unequal rates till a temperature of 139 ' C. was attained .
Then , again , the mass underwent neither contraction nor expansion during heating through 5 ' C. , and then it commenced to expand somewhat rapidly .
The most rapid contraction on heating took place between 130 ' and 133 ' C. Thus , in all , for the temperatures during which the mass contracted , the index moved through fifteen revolutions of 180 ' to 0 ' of arc , and these were related to the temperatures in the following manner:\#151 ; 1 revolution of index took place during heating from 124\#151 ; 128 ' C. 2 " " " 128-130 ' C. 4 " " " 130-131 ' C. 6 " " " 131-133 ' C. 2 " " " 133\#151 ; 139 ' C. The details of these contractions are shown in Table B. The heating , especially at these temperatures , was excessively slow , and so moderated that a complete observation of the behaviour of the substance in the expansion apparatus lasted from three to four hours .
Above 144 ' 0 .
the alloy expanded with a coefficient about three times greater than that which it possessed between 0 ' and 118 ' C. Mr. G. F. Rodwell .

The expansion in passing from the solid to the liquid condition was determined as before .
The coefficient between 144 ' C. and the fusing point increased rapidly with the temperature .
If we take the volume at 0 ' C. as unity , we have the following volumes corresponding to the temperatures given :\#151 ; Volume at 0 ' C. = 1-000000 99 118 1-003610 99 124 1-003610 9 ) 128 1-002314 99 130 .999716 99 131 .994517 99 133 .986717 99 139 .984120 99 144 .984120 99 150 .984810 99 300 1-006500 99 350 ( solid ) 1-013790 99 350 ( liquid ) 1-024370 In regard to this alloy the following points may be noted:\#151 ; 1 .
It possesses a similar density at three different temperatures .
Thus , it is obvious that the density is the same at 0 ' 0 .
, at just below 130 ' 0 .
, and at 282 ' O. 2 .
Although the alloy contains only 33'794 per cent , of iodide of silver , it contracts as considerably during heating as the iodide itself .
3 .
While the iodide of silver commences its contraction at 142 ' C. , and finishes it at 145''5 , the alloy commences to contract 18 ' C. lower ( viz. , at 124 ' C. ) and finishes 6''5 C. lower ( viz. , at 139 ' F. ) .
4 .
The chlorobromiodides of silver also began to contract on heating ( an effect which , of course , we must attribute solely to the presence of iodide of silver ) at 124 ' C. , but they finished at 133 ' 0 .
5 .
The harsh sounds emitted by the alloy during cooling , and the tremors simultaneously propagated through the mass , prove that violent molecular agitation is going on at such time as the iodide of Mr. G. F. Rodwell .
silver is passing from the amorphous plastic condition to the brittle crystalline condition , within the mass of the iodide of lead .
6 .
The fusing point of the alloy is 177 ' C. lower than that of the iodide of silver , which constitutes one-third of its weight , and 33 ' C. lower than that of the iodide of lead , which constitutes two-thirds of its weight .
7 .
If the lowering of the fusing point ( also markedly apparent in the case of the chlorobromiodides of silver ) is due to the fact that similar particles of matter attract each other more powerfully than dissimilar , and hence , when the particles of two bodies are mutually diffused , the attraction becomes less , and the molecular motion is consequently more readily assimilated ; the same cause may serve to explain the commencement of the phase of contraction on heating the alloy at a temperature 18 ' C. lower than the substance to which it owes this property .
8 .
It is interesting to compare one of the chlorobromiodides of silver with the lead-silver iodide alloy .
For this purpose we will take the chlorobromiodide which contains the nearest approach to the same quantity of iodide of silver as the alloy .
The second of the chlorobromiodides before described ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 25 , p. 295 ) contains 4P484 !
per cent , of iodide of silver , and 58-5160 per cent , of the chloride and bromide of silver , which latter , from the heat point of view , may be regarded as the same substance , because their coefficients of expansion are practically the same .
It may be noted ( vide below ) that while the expansion of the bromide ( which is slightly greater than that of the chloride ) scarcely exceeds that of the iodide of lead , and while , moreover , the chlorobromiodide contains 8 per cent , more iodide of silver than the lead-silver iodide alloy , the amount of contraction by heat of the latter is more than twenty times greater than that of the former , although we must believe this effect to be solely due to the iodide of silver in each case .

The accompanying tables show the curves of contraction and expansion of the lead-silver iodide alloy , and of its constituents .
In Table B the scale has been enlarged in order to show the details of the contraction of the alloy on being heated from 124 ' C. to 139 ' C. ( Addendum .

PbI3 described above , which contains 33*794 per cent , of iodide of silver .
But with the exception of Ho. 5 they were all so brittle that they could not be cast into rods suitable for use with the expansion apparatus .
During cooling large rifts appeared in the rod at right angles to its length , at the time when the iodide of silver commenced to -expand .
In the case of Ho. 1 the rod was violently broken during its cooling by the expanding iodide of silver ; even when slowly annealed in hot paraffine .
It may be noted that no such effect was produced in the case of the chlorobromiodides of silver , having the composition respectively : Ag2I2.AgBr .
AgCl ; Ag3I3.AgBr .
AgCl ; Ag4I4.AgBr .
AgCl ; and containing in each case a larger percentage of iodide of silver ( viz. , 58*6404 ; 68*0171 ; and 73*9285 ) than the silver-lead iodide alloy Ho. 1 .
The chlorobromiodides , although , of course , their brittleness increased with the percentage of iodide of silver , formed less brittle rods than the iodide of silver , and than the first of the silver-lead iodide alloys , although the latter contains 23 per cent , less iodide of silver than the chlorobromiodide Ag^.AgBr .
