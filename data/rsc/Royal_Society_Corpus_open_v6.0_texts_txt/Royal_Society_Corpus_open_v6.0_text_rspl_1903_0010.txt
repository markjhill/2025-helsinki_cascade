A few months ago , one of us ( J. L. ) stated* that he had made a series of experiments in which lipase was allowed to act on cottonseed oil , and that he had only been able to obtain hydrolysis amounting to 3 per cent. Dr. Macleod then suggested that it would be of considerable interest to ascertain the extent to which steapsin could carry the hydrolysis under the same conditions .
We , therefore , decided to* investigate this question conjointly , and we are now in a position to-show beyond doubt that steapsin is capable of hydrolysing ( saponifying ) , fats outside the organism to a very great extent .
As this fact appears to us of considerable physiological importance , inasmuch as the quantitative experiments have hitherto been made almost entirely on monobutyrin and simple esters , !
we publish this preliminary notice without referring to the literature inextenso .
This will be done after the completion of the experiments we have in hand .
Preparation of the Steapsin Solution. .
The steapsin solutions A and B ( see table ) were prepared from fresh ox pancreas .
The pancreas was freed of fat , minced , and 200 grams ground up in a mortar with water .
In the case of preparation A , 0 .
1 per cent , of mercuric chloride was added , and in B some thymol .
The preparations were then digested in the incubator at body temperature for 20 hours . !
Next they were filtered , and the filtrate examined for steapsin by vigorously shaking 2\#151 ; 3 c.c. in a test tube with a few drops of filtered butter fat , adding a drop of an alcoholic solution of phenolphthalein and then decinormal caustic soda solution , till a deep red colour was obtained .
Exactly the same mixture was # 'Jour .

u. Pharmak./ vol. 20 , p. 367 ) tested the action of an aqueous extract of pancreas on mutton fat , but found hydrolysis to proceed only to about 20 per cent. By adding bile to the digest the saponification amounted to about 60 per cent. Pawlow ( ' The Work of the Digestive Glands/ translated by W. H. Thompson , London , 1902 ) also records determinations by Dr. Walther ( pp. 29 , 39 ) of the steatolytic action of pancreatic juice obtained from a fistula , but the results do not give us an estimate of the actual amount of hydrolysis effected .
They were used by the workers for comparative observations .

[ May 11 , placed into a second test tube , the pancreatic extract having , in this case , been heated to destroy its ferments .
The preparations were incubated at 37 ' C. After about half-an-hour the preparations were examined .
In the case of the steatolytically active mixture , the -contents of the test tube were found to be discolourised , and the amount of decinormal caustic soda solution necessary to restore the original red tint was ascertained .
Preparations C and D were obtained from 200 grajns minced , fresh pig pancreas by simply triturating in a mortar with twice the bulk of water .
In these cases the preparations were not incubated , for it was evident that in the previous experiments with A and B the steapsin had been destroyed , as the preparations , before incubation , were very active steatolytically when tested by the above method , but only very slightly so after incubation ; probably this was due to the action of trypsin on steapsin .
It was also noticed in preparations A and B that the steapsin remained on the filter paper when the solutions were filtered , the filtrates having much weaker steatolytic powers than the precipitates .
Preparations C and D were , therefore , only filtered through muslin .
Preparation of the Emulsion of Fat and Steapsin .
100 grams of cotton-seed oil , or lard , were weighed out and carefully triturated in a mortar with measured quantities of the pancreatic extract .
Great care was taken to obtain a complete emulsion .
The emulsion was then poured into bottles which were well corked to exclude growth of fungi , and allowed to stand at the ordinary temperature.* If the temperature was raised too rapidly , say by immersion in a water bath kept at 30 ' or 35 ' 0 , the emulsified mass would separate into two layers , and no hydrolysis would then take place .
It is therefore of the greatest importance to carefully observe the mixture for some hours , and to thoroughly shake them up as soon as signs of separation are noticed , in order to restore the state of emulsion .
A good plan is to immerse the well-shaken emulsion in cold water , or to let it stand in the open during the night .
After a few days , distinct hydrolysis is noticeable .
In the case of cotton-seed oil , the outward sign of hydrolysis is the hardening of the mass , due to the fatty acids that have been formed .
Consideration of Results .
The following table contains a series of observations made on cottonseed oil and lard .
The amount of hydrolysis was measured by the percentage of free fatty acids , expressed in terms of oleic acid .
The # Most of the preparations kept free from infection during the time these experiments lasted .
Only a. few became covered with growth of Penicillium glaucum after the lapse of about four weeks .
1903 .
] The Hydrolysis of Fats in vitro by means of 33 experiments with A B and C were started on February 19th , and those with D on March 5th .
The first observations were made after a lapse of 4 days .
The delay was caused through some of the emulsions having separated into two layers , which necessitated the re-establishing of the state of emulsion by frequent shaking .
It will be noticed that in those experiments with cotton-seed oil , in which neither acid nor alkali had been added , hydrolysis had reached after four days , in the case of preparation C , from 22'9 per cent. ( No. 5 ) to 32'8 percent .
( No. 6 ) , and in the case of preparation D , from 31 per cent. ( No. 11 ) to\#187 ; 37 T per cent. ( No. 9 ) .
After another 7 days , samples Nos. 11 and 9s had reached 46'3 per cent , and 44'3 per cent , respectively .
As it was-not expected that further hydrolysis would proceed very rapidly , some time was allowed to elapse before the next tests were taken .
It will be seen from the table that the highest percentages of hydrolysis , when neither acid nor alkali was added , were 86'7 per cent , in the case of preparation C ( No. 6 ) , and 83'8 per cent , in the case of preparation D ( No. 10 ) .
In both cases the steapsin had been allowed to act for 56 days .
Whereas the experiments made with C show that the amount of hydrolysis increases with the amount of steapsin mixed with the oil , no such striking regularity is apparent in the case of preparations D ( Nos. 9 to 11 ) .
Further experiments were made with cotton-seed oil under the same conditions , only with that difference that either dilute acid or dilute caustic soda was added .
So far , no decisive influence of either acid or alkali has been noticed , and from the experiments recorded here , no definite conclusions can be drawn .
Curiously enough , the hydrolysis of lard proceeds at a very much slower rate , reaching only about one-third of the hydrolysis noticed in the case of cotton-seed oil .
Since the consistency of lard favours the state of emulsion , one would have expected the opposite result .
The last two experiments with lard seem to show that an increased amount of caustic soda , whilst favouring hydrolysis at the commencement , seems later on to retard the action of the steapsin , notwithstanding the larger amount of the latter .
The numbers recorded in the table show that the steapsin is not capable of producing the reversible reaction which it was thought , reasoning by analogy , this enzyme might produce .
These preliminary experiments are very interesting from a physiological point of view ; they prove for the first time that it can be demonstrated by the usual quantitative methods of fat analysis that steapsin is a very powerful fat-splitting ferment .
We are now investigating the action of steapsin and of lipase on fats , in the presence of bile , small quantities of soaps , and a number of other substances which suggest themselves from a physiological point of view .
