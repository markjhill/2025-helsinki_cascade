] On a Magnetized Copper Wire .
I. " Preliminary Experiments on a Magnetized Copper Wire .
" By Professor Balfour Stewart , LL. D. , F.R.S. , and Arthur Schuster , Ph. D. Received March 30 , 1874 .
1 .
The following experiments were made in the Physical Laboratory of Owens College , Manchester .
The copper wire employed ( A B C D , see fig. ) was found to contain no perceptible trace of iron , nor was it sensibly magnetic , behaving quite in a neutral manner when tested by the highest magnetic power at our disposal .
It was covered with gutta percha .
The diameter of the wire was 00487 inch .
The wire was wound fifty-three times , in one direction , round the poles of a powerful electromagnet , the length of wire encircling these poles being about twelve metres .
The direct distance of the magnet from the galvanometer , Gr , was about twelve metres .
A Wheatstone bridge was employed , and a very delicate Thomson 's reflecting galvanometer by Elliott Brothers , of which the resistance was 5540 B.-A .
units .
A circuit-breaker was placed in the circuit at E , close to the bridge .
On some occasions , we used one consisting of a solid key , which might be removed , thus breaking the circuit ; but , on other occasions , a fluid or mercurial circuit-breaker was employed .
When the left-hand pole of the electromagnet ( see fig. ) was made north the arrangement was called ( 1 ) , and when the other pole was made north the arrangement was called ( 2 ) .
It will thus be seen , from the figure , that the current went round the magnet in the same direction as the molecular currents of arrangement ( 2 ) .
Experiments were made at intervals of two minutes ; ad , on each occasion , the current was allowed to pass through the bridge for ten 2 b 2 3^2 Prof. B. Stewart and Dr. A. Schuster [ May 7 , seconds , the measurement being taken by the first swing of the galvanometer , which lasted for about eight seconds .
Three cells of Grove 's battery were used for producing this current ; but , on the other hand , six similar cells were employed for magnetizing the electromagnet .
The arrangements for magnetizing are not shown in the figure .
The distance of the magnet was too great to affect the galvanometer-needle so as to alter its sensibility , the average deflection causing a differencein the zero of about four divisions of the scale .
2 .
In the first experiments made , the key at E ( see fig. ) -was not taken out before the magnetism was put on or off , in consequence of which the induction-current , due to the wire coiled round the magnet , affected the galvanometer on these occasions ; but , after December 12th , the key was taken out , so that no induction-current passed .

For instance , in the above Table , we see for December 18th a marked increase of resistance when the magnet was first put on ; but , on the afternoon of that day , the experiments were repeated , and there was no apparent increase of resistance in this first effect .
Next , with regard to the average effect : on Dec. 16th , 17th , and 18th , this average effect of magnetism was a decrease of resistance ; but on Dec. 19th there was an apparent increase of resistance when the magnetism was on .
We cannot say that nothing had been done to the arrangement between the 18th and 19th of December that might account for this change ; but whatever was done must have escaped our recollection .
Undoubtedly a good many experiments were made during the time between the 15th and 19th of December , and the direction of the magnetism was frequently changed .
This curious anomaly , occurring unexpectedly , induced us to limit our future experiments to a definite set each day .
4 .
The experiments were resumed on January 7th , the arrangement having remained untouched during the holidays .
From this date until January 10th inclusive , the key was taken out before beginning experiments in the morning : there was no peculiar effect while , on the other hand , an average effect denoting a decrease of resistance came out very prominently .
On January 12th and 13th the key was only taken out before magnetizing , and on these occasions the first , denoting increased resistance , was sufficiently marked .
Our method of procedure was varied in the above manner up to January 27th ; and it was invariably found that , whenever the key was taken out before commencing experiments , there was no effect ; but when it was kept in until before magnetizing , this first effect was sufficiently marked .
These experiments concur in proving that the first effect has some reference to the previous treatment of the wire ; but they do not prove that it is at the same time connected with the putting on of the magnetism .
To determine this point we made a set of experiments on'January 22nd , 26th , and 27th .
When the current had become constant the key was taken out , but the magnetism was not put on ; and on these occasions there was no first i ffvet of the current upon itself in the direction of increased resistance , but rather in the opposite -direction .
It thus appears that the first effect which increases the resistance has not Prof. B. Stewart and Dr. A. Schuster [ May only reference to the previous treatment of the wire , but depends also upon the magnetism being put on .
This result is confirmed by experiments made previous to Dec. 12th , in which the key was not taken out at all .

+45 We have hitherto only spoken of the first effect obtained after January 7th ; we now come to the average .
From January 7th to January 27th inclusive , the magnetism was always put on in the direction ( 1 ) , and the average effect invariably denoted a decrease of resistance when the magnetism was on .
5 .
On January 28th the magnetism was reversed ; the effect during this day was very irregular .
On January 29th , 30th , 31st , and February 2nd the key was left in until before magnetization .
The first effect was now extremely large ; but it was suspected that , during these experiments , the contact of the key was not very good .
On January 29th the average effect denoted a decrease of resistance , but on January 30th , 31st , February 2nd , 4th , 6th , the average effect denoted an increase of resistance .
6 .
From February 6th until February 11th the wires were left broken ; on February 11th there was a very slight first effect in the direction of increased resistance , and a slight average effect in the direction of decreased resistance .
On February 12th a mercury interruptor was used instead of a metal key , both the wires being broken by it , and its use was continued until February 18th .
The interruptor was left in over night and the current w^as only broken before magnetization , but no first effect was observed .
From February 19th to February 26th one wire only was broken by the fluid interruptor ; nevertheless there was no effect .
On February 12th , when the fluid interruptor was first employed , there was a very small average effect in the direction of increased resistance ; but , in all the experiments afterwards , this average effect was in the direction of decreased resistance .
The magnetism had been in the direction ( 2 ) from January 28th ; but , during the experiment of February 25th , it was reversed and retained in this condition through the experiment of February 26th , without appearing to affect the results .
7 .
From these experiments we may perhaps conclude as follows :\#151 ; In the first place , there is a first effect in the direction of increased resistance which appears to have reference to three things\#151 ; namely , the previous state of the wire , the solidity of the circuit , and its magnetization .
In the second place , we have an average effect , of which the normal state appears to denote a decreased resistance while the magnetism is on , without reference to the direction of the magnetism .
on a Magnetized Copper Wire .
1874 .
] In the third place , when , in a solid circuit , the direction of the magnetism has been recently changed , there appears to be a temporary reversal of the average effect , which appears , at first , as an increase of resistance .
Besides the evidence herein detailed , we have other evidence in favour of the third conclusion ; for in some preliminary experiments , in which we frequently reversed the poles , we found an increase of resistance when the magnetism was on .
We have given , in a Table appended to this paper , a synopsis of our various experiments .
8 .
We are led to conclude , from other experiments besides these , that the effect of the magnetism is not merely confined to the part of the copper wire wound round the poles , but is propagated all along the wire .
On December 2nd , for instance , the current was passed through the wire , the galvanometer being joined as a secondary circuit .
The main current was therefore measured .
The deflections were as follows :\#151 ; 297 off 300 . . . .
off 300 ( 1 ) 302 . . . .
( 1 ) 297 off 301 . . . .
off 300 ( 1 ) This shows an average strengthening of the current , equal to about one two-hundredth part of the whole .
Were this strengthening due to merely the change of resistance of that part of the wire wound round the poles , the effect , as measured by the much more delicate arrangement of Wheatstone 's bridge , would be much larger than was actually observed .
9 .
Allusion was made in article 7 to some preliminary experiments , in which increased resistance was observed when the magnetism was put on ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) alternately .
Similar experiments were made , giving the same result with a piece of coke and graphite , which were placed between the poles of the magnet .
10 .
We have also some evidence that a copper wire , one end of which is wound round the pole of the magnet , changes its position in the electromotive series .
Two copper wires were dipped into dilute nitric acid and connected with the galvanometer .
A weak current passed through the galvanometer owing to a slight difference in the copper wires , one of which was also connected with the copper wire wound round the magnet .
When the magnet was on , the current , as a rule , changed in intensity ; but the effect was small , and the difficulty of having two copper wires which , when joined together and dipped into nitric acid , give a current sufficiently weak and constant , prevented us from getting any decided results .
11 .
In conclusion we have to state that we regard these results which we have ventured to bring before the Royal Society as preliminary , the correctness of which will , we trust , be confirmed by the further experiments which it is our intention to make .

" Note on some Winter Thermometrie Observations in the Alps .
" By E. Frankland , F.R.S. During the past winter , I spent a. fortnight at the village of Davos , Canton Q-raubiinden , Switzerland , and had thus an opportunity of experiencing some of the remarkable peculiarities of the climate of the elevated valley ( the Prattigau ) in which Davos is situated .
The village has of late acquired considerable repute as a climatic sanitarium for persons suffering from diseases of the chest .
So rapidly has its reputation grown , that while in the winter of 1865\#151 ; 66 only eight patients resided there , during the past season upwards of three hundred have wintered in the valley .
The summer climate of Davos is very similar to that of Pontresina and St. Moritz , in the neighbouring high valley of the Engadin\#151 ; cool and rather windy ; but so soon as the Prattigau and surrounding mountains become thickly and , for the winter , permanently covered with snow , which usually happens in November , a new set of conditions come into play and the winter climate becomes exceedingly remarkable .
The sky is , as a-rule , cloudless or nearly so ; and , as the solar rays , though very powerful , are incompetent to melt the snow , they have little effect upon the temperature , either of the valley or its enclosing mountains ; consequently there are no currents of heated air ; and , as the valley is well sheltered from more general atmospheric movements , an almost uniform calm prevails until the snow melts in spring .
