) The view that the spectra of isotopes are identical was first put to the test by Bussell and Rossi* and Exner and Haschek , f who examined the spectra of thorium and ionium preparations .
The former of these observers worked with a mixture containing at least 10 per cent , of ionium , but no lines were found which were not present in the spectrum of pure thoria .
AstonJ has submitted neon to fractional diffusion , by which a partial separation was effected , as shown by the change of density , but no change in the spectrum was observed .
More recently Soddy and HymanS and Richards and LembertH have compared the spectrum of lead of radioactive origin with that of ordinary lead .
The former of these investigators , who worked with lead from thorite , found that the line \ = 4760T was stronger in ordinary lead than in the thorite lead , but that the spectra in other respects appeared to be identical .
Richards and Lembert also found that the spectra were identical .
In both of these investigations , the Fery spectrograph was used for the photography of the spectra ; no details are given , but it is presumed that in both cases the spectra of the radioactive and ordinary lead were photographed in juxtaposition on the same plate .
This method is admirably suited to a general comparison , but it gives no numerical data as to the exact degree of identity of the wave-lengths in the two spectra .
It might reasonably be expected that in the spectra of isotopes small differences of wave-length would occur , though the character and distribution of the lines were the same .
According to the recent views of Prof. Hicks , an atomic weight term enters exactly into the separations of doublets and triplets in series spectra .

Spectra of Ordinary Lead and Lead of Radioactive Origin .
199 have found that a group of ten lines repeats itself three times with constant frequency differences .
It seems probable , however , that doublet or triplet series exist in the lead spectrum , and for the lines which fall into such series there should , according to the views of Prof. Hicks , be differences of wavelength in the two isotopes corresponding with the difference of atomic weight .
In the present investigation , I have made a comparison of the wave-lengths of some of the most prominent lines in the spectrum of ordinary lead and of the lead in Joachimsthal pitchblende .
The spectra were photographed with a concave grating spectrograph , mounted according to the arrangement of Eagle* and provided with a concave grating of 4 feet radius of curvature having 20,000 lines to the inch .
The plates were measured on a Hilger micrometer .
The spectra were produced in the carbon arc , the carbons being cored , as the case might be , with the pitchblende residues or with iron oxide containing a small proportion of ordinary lead .
The residues contained a considerable quantity of iron which served as a comparison spectrum .
A number of plates were taken , in which the two spectra were in juxtaposition , and the lines due to lead were found to be identical in the two spectra .
The object of the present investigation , however , is to set some superior limit to any wave-length differences that might occur .
The wave-lengths of the principal lead lines between X = 3500 and X = 4100 have therefore been independently measured in the ordinary and radioactive lead spectra , the iron lines being used as standards .
The values obtained are given in the following table :\#151 ; A , ordinary lead .

200 Spectra of Ordinary Lead and Lead of Radioactive Origin .
The atomic weight determinations of Richards and Lembert ( loc. cit.\ Honigschmid and Horovitz* and Curief show that the atomic weight of lead from the pitchblende residues is somewhat greater than the value predicted by theory , this being no doubt due to the presence of a small'quantity of ordinary lead in the pitchblende .
If the spectrum lines in the two leads differed in wave-length by a small amount , the lines from the pitchblende residues would be double .
If the components were not resolved in the spectroscope , the doubling should nevertheless make itself felt as an apparent shift or an asymmetric broadening of the line .
On the assumption that the lead in my residues has an atomic weight about *5 unit less than ordinary lead , Prof. J. W. Nicholson has very kindly calculated for me the order of the change of wave-length to be expected according to Prof. Hicks ' theory , in the case of lines belonging to series , doublets or triplets .
If the separation of two such lines in a doublet were 50 A.U. at X = 4000 A.U. ( an order of separation which might reasonably be expected to occur in the case of lead doublets ) , then a change of atomic weight of 0*5 unit should alter the separation of the lines by about 0*3 A.U. , or if each of the lines were shifted by an equal amount , a change of wave-length of the order of 0*15 A.U. in each line would result .
It may be stated with certainty that in the lead lines , which are not given in the above list but which were observed in the photographs of the spectra taken in juxtaposition , no change of wave-length of this order occurs .
A special examination has been made of the line X = 4058 .
This line is by far the strongest line which can be photographed through glass lenses and prisms .
The comparison has been made of this line in the two lead spectra by photographing the ring systems produced by means of a Fabry and Perot etalon .
The line X = 4058 .
when produced in the carbon arc at atmospheric pressure , is too broad for the production of interference rings of sufficiently good definition .
The spectrum was therefore produced in a glass globe of about 1 litre in capacity , exhausted by means of a Fleuss pump to a pressure of a few millimetres of mercury , between carbon rods , cored with small quantities of the two leads as carbonates or oxides .
Under these conditions sharp definition could be obtained .
The convergent beam of light from a lens placed at a suitable distance from the arc passed through the Etalon , and an achromatic lens of 6 inches focal length brought the ring system to a focus on the slit of a large Hilger constant-deviation spectroscope provided with a camera attachment .
The etalon consisted of two half-silvered plane parallel glass plates separated by three glass studs , the distance between the * 4 Comptes Rendus/ vol. 158 , p. 1796 ( 1914 ) .

plates being 6*50 mm. The exposures were made within two or three minutes of one another , to avoid variations due to changes of temperature .
Photographs taken in this way showed that the interference rings are identical for the two* lead spectra , and measurements of the diameters of the rings agree within the limits of experimental error , the calculated results showing that there is certainly no difference of wave-length for the line \ = 4058 as great as 0*003 A.U. in the spectrum of ordinary lead and of the lead from pitchblende .
In conclusion , I should like to thank Prof. Nicholson for the calculation which he has made for me .
On the Viscosity of the Vapour of Iodine .

) In a previous communication* I have described the measurements I have made of the viscosity of bromine vapour .
The method used for this purpose involved the distillation of bromine from one vessel to another through a capillary tube .
The pressure difference between the two ends of the capillary was established by maintaining the two vessels at suitable different temperatures , and the rate of transpiration of the bromine vapour was estimated by observing the volume of the liquid bromine which evaporated in a *given time .
It was hoped that the same method could be applied to iodine by adjusting the temperatures of evaporation and condensation to values above the melting point of iodine ( 113 ' C. ) , and measuring the transpiration rate by means of the disappearance of liquid from the evaporation vessel .
Preliminary experiments , however , soon revealed the fact that the liquid iodine was not sufficiently mobile , and its surface was too indefinite and variable in shape to allow small changes of volume to be observed .
It was , therefore , found necessary to modify in several respects the method used with bromine .
The present paper describes the modified method , which was found to work extremely well and to give very consistent results .
