" On the Non-coincidence of the Focus of the Photogenic Rays with that of the Visual Rays of the Solar Spectrum .
" By M. A. Claudet .
Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. , &amp;c. After detailing the difficulties he had met with in obtaining perfect pictures when a lens , accurately corrected for spherical and chromatic aberration , was employed in the Daguerreotype process , the author states that in order to obtain a clear and well-defined image of any object on the Daguerreotype plate , he generally found it necessary to adjust the focus on the ground glass by another object brought considerably nearer to the camera than the object whose picture was required .
When this adjustment is made , he proceeds to apply the principle practically to the taking of portraits .
He finds that in achromatic object-glasses the focus of photogenic action is not coincident with the visual focus ; and the distance between these two foci varies according to the nature of the combination of the glasses , to their different dispersive powers , and to the degree of intensity of the light .
By attention to these circumstances in accurately adjusting the Daguerreotype plate to the situation of the focus of the photogenic rays , the author has succeeded in obtaining the most perfect delineations of objects .
