THE surface of any turbinated or discoid shell may be imagined to be generated by the revolution about a fixed axis ( the axis of the shell ) of the perimeter of a geometrical figure , which , remaining always geometrically similar to itself , increases continually its dimensions .
In discoid shells the generating figure retains its position upon the axis as it thus revolves , as in the Nautilus Pompilius ( Plate IX .
fig. 3 .
) , and the Argonaut .
In turbinated shells , including the great families of Trochi , Turbines* , Murices and Strombi , it slides continually along the axis of its revolution ( fig. 4 .
) .
In some great classes of shells as the Ammonites , the Nautilus scrobiculatus , the Nautilus spirula , the Helix cornea , the Trochus perspectivus , the Nerita , the generating figure increases its distance from the axis at the same time that it increases its dimensions and revolves .
Among the generating figures of conchloidal surfaces are to be found various known geometrical forms .
The generating figure of the Conus Virgo is a triangle , that of the Trochus telescopicus and of the Trochus Archimedis , a trapezoid .
The species of the genus Turbo have for their generating figure a curve , of double curvature , of a circular or elliptic form , to whose perimeter the axis of revolution is a tangent .
The Nautilas Pompilius is generated by the revolution about its shorter diameter of a plane curve , approaching very nearly to a serni-ellipse ( fig. 3 .
) ; and the Cyproea by the revolution of a similar curve about its longer diameter .
There is a mechanical uniformity observable in the description of shells of the same species , which at once suggests the probability that the generating figure of each increases , and that the spiral chamber of each expands itself , according to some simple geometrical law common to all .
To the determination of this law , if any such exist , the operculum lends itself , in certain classes of shells , with remarkable facility .
Continually enlarged by the animal , as the constm'uction of its shell advances , so as to fill up its mouth , the operculum measures the progressive widening of the spiral chamber , by the progressive stages of its growth .
Of these progressive stages of the growth of the operculum , distinct traces remain on its surface , under the form in the Turbines ( fig. 1 .
) of certain curved lines , and in the Neritoe ( fig. 2 .
) of certain straight lines , passing from the margin of the operculumi ( which if produced they would intersect ) to a certain spiral line marked deeply upon its face .
To this spiral they are tangents , and may be supposed to generate it by their consecutive intersections .
The spiral eventually passes into the margin of the operculurn and for a considerable distance traces it .
If the eye be made to traverse one of the curved lines first spoken of in the operculumr of the Turbo , or one of the straight lines in the Nerita , from its margin to the point where it loses itself in the spiral , and if it then follow the spiral until it returns to the point in the margin whence it set out , it will have traversed the boundary of a figure which was once the actual boundary of the operculum , which therefore indicates one stage of its growth , and of which all , similarly traced , will be seen to have similar geometrical forms .
It will further be apparent from this examination , that the operculum has increased at each stage of its growth , not throughout its whole margin at once , but on a series of different portions of it lying in different consecutive positions round it ; each such addition being SO made as to preserve the above-mentioned geometrical similarity of the whole* .
In all the similar geometrical figures thus visible upon the face of the operculum , and which have in succession constituted its limits , the pole of the spiral will moreover be seen to occupy a similar position .
The linear dimensions of any two of them ( P1 C Q1 and P2 C Q2 ) are then to one another as the radii vectores drawn to similar points in them , and therefore as those ( P P1 and P P2 ) drawn to the extremities of the boundary by which they unite .
To determine , therefore , the law according to which the linear increase of the operculumr takes place , that is , the law according to which the linear increase of the section of the chamber of the shell takes place , we have only to determine the law according to which the radii vectores , drawn to successive points of the spiral visible upon the operculum .
increase , that is , we have only , geometrically , to determine the spiral .
Now in every case this spiral is the logarithmic spiral .
A slight inspection of it is sufficient to suggest the probability that the angle at which it intersects its radius vector is everywhere the same , and this supposition is fully confirmed by direct aduleasurements grounded upon the following property of the logarithmic spiral , " That the distances of successive spires , measured upon the same radius vector produced , from the pole and from one another , are respectively in geometrical progression ; the common ratio of the progression being in both cases 52grcotA , where A is the constant angle of the spiral+ .
" T The whole class of shells Haliotis affects the method of formation here described .
The shell itself is in this class generated by additions upon one margin , as in other classes the operculum is generated .

The following distances were measured upon three different opercula from the poles of their spiral curves to their successive whorls ; the distances in the same column being measured on the same radius vector produced .
It will be perceived that for the same operculum these distances have the same ratio consecutively to one another ; the deviation from this law in no case exceeding that error which of necessity attaches to the method of admeasurement .

I6::13 74 18 &lt; I2 95 The spiral of the operculum is then a logarithmic spiral .
Now its linear dimensions in the different successive stages of its progress have been shown to be as the successive radii vectores of its spiral .
The increments of its linear dimensions are then as the increments of these radii vectores .
But by a fundamental property of the logarithmic spiral , the increments of its radii vectores , corresponding to equal increments in their angles of revolution , are as the radii vectores themselves .
Thus , then , it follows that the increments of the linear dimensions of the operculum , corresponding to equal angular distances round its pole , are as its existing linear dimensions ; and , therefore , that the increments of the linear dimensions of the section of the spiral chamber corresponding to these are everywhere as its existing linear dimensions .
The animal , as he advances in the construction of his shell , increases continually his operculumn , so as to adjust it to its mouth .
He increases it , however , not by additions made at the same time all round its MDcccxxxvll ! .
2 z nargin , but by additions made only on one side of it at once .
One edge of the operculurn thus remains unaltered as it is advanced into each new position , and placed in a newly formed section of the chamber similar to the last , but greater than it .
That the same edge which fitted a portion of the first less section should be capable of adjustment , so as to fit a portion of the next similar but greater section , supposes a geometrical provision in the curved form of the chamber of great apparent complication and difficulty .
But God hath bestowed upon this humble architect the practical skill of a learned geometrician , and he makes this provision with admirable precision in that curvature of the logarithmic spiral which he gives to the section of the shell .
This curvature obtaining , lie has only to turn his operculum slightly round in its own plane as he advances it into each newly formed portion of his chamber , to adapt one margin of it to a new and larger surface and a different curvature , leaving the space to be filled up by increasing the operculum wholly on the other margin .
rro nake this apparent , let the following be received as a characteristic property of the logarithmic spiral : " 'That lines anywhere drawn from its pole , inclined to one another at the same angle , will intercept between them branches of the curve which , however different their linear dimensions , will be geometrically similar to each other .
" So that if two lines given in position be imagined to be drawn from the pole of such a spiral , parallel to its plane , and the spiral be then imagined to be put in motion in its own plane round its pole , then as its curve revolved under these lines they would intercept portions of it continually increasing , or continually diminishing in dimensions , and continually receding from or approaching the pole , but all geometrically similarly to each other ald similarly placed .
" Now each new section of the chamber of the shell being similar to the preceding section , but greater than it , if the opercullum were thrust forward into this greater section without being turned round in its own plane , any portion of its edge would manifestly present to the corresponding portion of the perimeter of the new section a similar but a less curve , which could not be made to coincide with it .
If , however , the operculuin be imagined to be turned round in its own plane about its pole in the opposite direction to that in which the spiral increases , the curve presented by it to this portion of the perimeter of the section will continually approach it , increasing its dimensions , but remaining similar to it , so that at length it will coincide with it .
And thus one margin of the operculum will be made everywhere to fit itself to the side of the chamber , the coincidence of the other margin remaining to be produced by new matter added to it .
It will be apparent from a simple inspection of the operculumn that the animal does thus turn it round in its own plane as he advances it , with what is called a screw motion .
Such is the theory of the growth of the operculurn .
There is traced in it the application of properties of a geometric curve to a mechanical purpose by HIM who muetes the dimensions of space and stretches out the forms of matter according to the rules of a perfect geometry , -properties which , like so many others in nature , may have also their application in art .
It instructs us how to shape a tube of a variable section , so that a piston driven along it shall , by one side of its margin , coincide continually with its surface as it advances , provided only the piston be made at the same time continually to revolve in its own plane .
The investigation has now arrived at a point from which the law of the geometrical description of turbinated shells can be enunciated with greater precision .
" They are generated by the revolution about a fixed axis ( the axis of the shell ) of a curve , which continually varies its dimensions according to the law , that each linear increment , corresponding to a given angular increment , shall vary as the existing dimensions of the line of which it is the increment ( the law of the description of the logarithmic spiral ) , and which curve either retains its position upon the axis , or moves along it with a motion of translation in the direction of its length .
" This law is readily subjected to verification by admeasurement .
It is clear that , if it obtain , similar linear dimensions measured at similar points of successive whorls , should be in geometric progression .
Thus if the generating curve ( as in the Nautilus Pompilius ) revolve about the axis without at the same time sliding along it , and a section be made through the centre of the shell perpendicular to the axis , then will the section be ( if this law be true ) a spiral curve , whose distances from the axis , measured on the same radius vector , are in geometrical progression , and which is therefore a logarithmic spiral .
In the more general case , in which the generating curve , as in the Turbo scalaris , slides forwards upon the axis as it reevolves , increasing at the same time its linear dimensions according to the law of the logarithmic spiral , it is clear that the surfaces of the successive whorls would .
interfere with one another , and that thus the uniformnity of the spiral chamber would be destroyed , unless the motion of translation ( or the sliding motion ) of the curve , by which the space allowed to each whorl upon the axis is determined , were governed by some law corresponding to that which governs the linear dimensions of the whorl ; unless , in short , the spaces allowed to the widths of successive whorls upon the axis varied in the same progression as the widths themselves vary .
A similar principle applies to the distances of the whorls measured upon the surface of the shell in the same plane passing through the axis .
These distances are , in fact , in this case , similar linear dimensions of successive whorls , and are therefore subject , according to the theory , to the law of the logarithmic spiral , and like the distances of successive whorls of that spiral , on the saimle radius vector , are in geometric progression .
Nautilus Pompilius .
These conclusions were directly verified .
by the following observations .
A shell of the Nautilus Pompilius was cut through the middle in a direction perpendicular to its axis , and a tracing was taken of the section of its spiral surface ; this tracing is copied in fig. 6 .
2 z2 It was made from the dark line which shows , on the section of the internal whorls of the shell , the line of that pearly surface which the animal deposits as a covering to its completed portion , as it advances in the construction of it .
It is important to make this observation , because as it extends one whorl of its shell over another , the animal deposits continually upon the pearlysurface of this last a new coating of shell , and thickens it ; and it is in the centre of this thickened section that is to be found that section of the pearly surface , of which the edge of the external whorl is a continuation , and fionm which this tracing was taken .
It will be found that the distance of any two of its whorls measured upon a radius vector is one-third that of the two next whorls measured upon the same radius vector .
Thus ab is one-third of b c , de is one-third of of , gh is one-third of h i , Ik is one-third of I m. The curve is therefore a logarithmic spiral .
Turbo duplicatus .
From the apex of a large specimen of the Turbo duplicatus a line was drawn across its whorls , and their widths were measured upon it in succession , beginning from the last but one .
The measurements were , as before , made with a fine pair of compasses and a diagonal scale .
The sight was assisted by a magnifying glass .
In a parallel column to the admeasurements are the terms of a geometric progression , whose first term is the width of the widest whorl measured , and whose common ratio is 1 1804 .

A great number of admeasurements were similarly made upon other shells of the genera Trochus , Strombus and Murex ; some of them were cut through the axis longitudinally ; and similar measurements were made by drawing lines from the apex across the section .
From all these the same result was obtained .
Thus to each particular species of shell is annexed a characteristic number , being the ratio of the geometric progression of similar successive linear dimensions of its whorls ; from which number is deducible the constant angle of the particular logarithmic spiral which is affected by that species of shell ( see equation 26 .
in the following mathematical discussion ) .
This number , or this angle , connected as it is of necessity with the circumstances of the animal 's growth and the manner of its existence , is determinable by actual admeasureinent , and may be available for the purposes of classification ; it may suggest relations to which the observations of naturalists may usefully be directed , and eventually become linked with characteristic forms and modes of molluscous existence* .
Why the Mollusks who inhabit turbinated and discoid shells should , in the piogressive increase of their spiral dwellings , affect the particular law of the logarithmic spiral , is easily to be understood .
Providence has subjected the instinct which .
shapes out each , to a rigid uniformity of operation .
This uniformity manifests itself in turbinated shells in respect to their axes .
Now the law of the logarithmic spiral , considered under its more general form of a curve of double curvature , is the only one according to which the Mollusk can wind its spiral dwelling in an uniform direction through the space round its axis , in respect to that axis .
Under this general form it may be geometrically defined as the curve whose tangent retains always the same angular position in respect to its axis* , and in respect to a line drawn from the point where it touches the curve perpendicular to the axis ; or in other words , which traverses the space round the axis always in the same direction in respect to it .
A second property of the logarithmic spiral , equally referring itself to the uniformity of the animal 's operations about the axis of its shell , is this ; that it has everywhere the same geometrical curvature , and is the only curve except the circlet which possesses this property .
Certain physiological facts having reference to the growth of the Mollusk are deducible from the geometrical description of its shell .
If it be a land shell , its capacity may be supposed ( reasoning from that principle of economy which is an observable law in Nature ) to be precisely sufficient for the reception of the animal who built it .
If it be an aquatic shell , it serves the animal at once as a habitation and as a float ; enabling it to vary its buoyancy according as it leaves a greater or a less portion of the narrower extremity of its chamber unoccupied , and thus to ascend or descend in the water , at will .
Now that its buoyancy , and therefore the facility of thus varying its position , may remain the same at every period of its growth , it is necessary that the increment of the capacity of its float should bear a constant ratio to the corresponding increment of its body , a ratio which always assigns a greater amount to the increment of the capacity of the shell than to the corresponding increments of the animal 's bullk .
Thus the chamber of the aquatic shell is increased , not only , as is the land shell , so that it may contain the greater bulk of the Mollusk , but so that more and more of it may be left unoccupied .
Now the capacity of the shell and the dimensions of the animal began together , and they increase thus in a constant ratio ; the whole bulk of the animal bears therefore a constant ratio , of greater inequality , to the whole capacity of the shell , in aquatic shells : in land shells , it is probably equal to it .
Now let the generating curve of a shell be conceived to describe , as it revolves round its axis , a series of successive equal angles , represented each by A 0 .
Corre .
sponding to these equal increments of the angle of revolution of the generating CurI 've , will be certain increments of the capacity of the shell ; and it appears from the following mathematical investigation of the properties of conchoidal surfaces ( see equation .
19 .
) , that the increments of the capacity of the shell , thus taken , will be in a constant ratio to the then existing whole capacities of the shell .
The increment of the animal 's bulk corresponding to each of these increments of the shell must then be in a constant ratio to its then existing hulk ; that is , the animal 's growth corresponding to a given increment , A 0 , in the angle described by the generating curve of iLs shell , is proportional always to its existing growth .
Let us now suppose that the physical living energies of the animal ( those by which it grows ) , at any time , are proportional to its then existing growth ; and therefore that its growth in any increment of time is proportional to its growth up to that time ( a supposition which possesses an independent probability ) .
From the conclusion before arrived at , and from this supposition , it follows that the growth of the animal corresponding to a given increment , A 0 , in the aingle of revolution of the generating curve , and the growth corresponding to a given increment of time , are each proportional to the animal 's whole then existing growth , and therefore to one another ; and , since they begin together , that the whole angle , 0 , of revolution of the generating curve of the shell , is proportional to the whole corresponding time of the animal 's growth , and therefore that the whole number of whorls , and parts of whorls , is proportional to its whole age : a conclusion which , like the supposition whence it is dedi-ced , possesses an independent probability .
The separate piobability of each of the two suppositions , " that the physical energies of the Mollusk , as developed in its growth in a given increment of time , are proportional to its whole then existing growth* , and that its age is always proportional to the whole angle which , in the construction of the shell , it has then described round its axis , " is greatly increased by the necessary relation which is here shown to obtain between them ; a relation , by reason of which , either supposition being made , the other becomes a conclusion .
The form of the Mollusk being supposed to remain geometrically similar to itself , the surface of its mantle , by which organ it deposits its shell , of necessity varies as the square of its linear dimensions , whilst the whole bulk of the animal varies as the cube of its lineal dimensions .
But , as its xvhole bulk , varies its active living and growing energy , and therefore the amount of the leposition of its shell in a given time ; this last , then , varies as the cube of its linear dimensions ; but the surface of the depositing organ ( the mantle ) varies only as the square of the same linear dimensions .
Besides , then , the organic increase of the surface of the mantle , there mobust be an increased functional activity of all its organs , varying as its simple lineal dimensions .
This increased functional activity of the surface of the depositing organ , varying May not this law of the growth of a Mollusk have its analogy in other forms of animal life , and perhaps in vegetable life ?
simply as the linear dimensions of the animal or its shell , offers an analogy , and has perhaps a relation , to the increase of the section of the shell , according to the same law of its simple linear dimensions .
Subjoined to this paper is a mathematical discussion of the following geometrical and mechanical elements of a conchoidal surface : its VOLUME , the dimensions of its SURFACE , the CENTRE OF GRAVITY of its contained solid , the CENTRE OF GRAVITY of its surface .
These elements are determined ( the law of the logarithmic spiral being supposed ) by certain transcendental functions , having constant factors dependent for their amount upon the statical moments and the moments of inertia of the generating figures and of their areas .
The object proposed in the determination of these elements was their application to a discussion of the hydraulic theory of shells ; yet further , if possible , to develope that wisdom of God which shaped them out and moulded them ; and especially in reference to the particular value of the constant angle which the spiral of each spedies of shell affects , -a value connected by a necessary relation with the economy of the material of each , and with its stability , and the conditions of its buoyancy * .
The paper concludes with a discussion of the general EQUATIONS to a conchoidal surface in respect to systems of polar and of rectangular coordinates .
To determine the Volume of a Conchoidal Solid .
Suppose the generating curve to be a plane curve , and let it ( first ) retain its position upon the axis as it revolves , varying its dimensions .
Let PC and QC ( fig. 3 .
) be two of its positions , inclined at the angle A 0 , and ineluding between them the elementary solid PC Q. Imagine the plane PC to have revolved about Az through the angle A0 without altering its dimensions , the solid generated by it would then , by the theorem of GuLDINUS , be represented by M. A 0 , where M represents the statical moment of the plane PC about the axis A z. The elementary solid imagined to be in like manner generated by the revolution of QC through the angle A 0 , will similarly be represented by ( MJ +A M ) A 0 .
Now between these two imaginary solids is evidently the actual elementary solid PC Q. Calling then V the volume of the solid to be determined , we have MA0 &lt; A V &lt; ( M +A M ) A 0 .
Or , considering Ni and V as functions of 0 , and expanding by TAYLOR'S theorem , die d2V .

) without otherwise altering its position , the elementary solid included between it and PC will retain the same volume as it had before ; for the two planes PC and QC may be divided into the same number of similar elements , whose corresponding angles being joined , thie solid element included between then will be divided into as many pyramidal frusta , the volume of each of which will remain unaltered by the supposed displacement of C Q , since each such frustum may be imagined to be made up of two pyramids , the base of each of which will remain the same after the displacement , and their bases and vertices between the same parallels .
Th us , then , the volume determined by the above formula is that of the conchoidal solid under its most general form .
To determine the Area of a Conchoidal Surface .
Let U represent the whole area of the surface ( fig. 3 .
) , and AU the elementary area intercepted between the positions PC and QC of the generating curve , supposed to revolve without otherwise altering its position on the axis .
Take AS to represent the element PQ of the curve described by the extremity P of the revolving axis PC of the generating curve .
Imagine the generating curve to describe , without altering its dimensions , an angle about the axis A z , such that the circular arc .
, described on this supposition by the AS8 point P , may equal PQ or A S. This angle will be represented by-i- .
The generating curve remaining always similar to itself , its statical moment about Az is a function of 0 or of R. Let it be represented by N , and considered a function of R. The elementary surface which the curve CP will generate , on the AS supposition just made , will then be represented by R N. according to the property of GULDINUS .
A surface similarly generated by CQ will in like manner be represented by R+ AJ ( N + AN ) .
Now the dimensions of the actual element of the conchoidal surface lie between the dimensions of these two imaginary surfaces .
This will be seen if we conceive any number of planes passing through the axis C D , at right angles to A z , to intersect all three of the surfaces spoken of .
The intercepted parts will be strips of the three surfaces , all of the same length , but of breadths , of which those of the surface described by PC will be the least , and those described by QC the greatest .

The expression for the area of the surface thus determined , on the supposition that the generating curve does not alter its position in respect to the axis otherwise than by revolving round it , is the same with that of the surface which would be generated by a curve which , as it revolved about the axis , slided along it , a different form being assigned to the function N. For if we imagine a conchoidal surface of this general form ( fig. 4 .
) to be intersected by planes , exceedingly near to one another , passing through its axis , and at the same time to be traversed , as the surfaces of turbinated shells usually are , by spiral lines parallel to the direction of the whorl , and which may be understood to mark the paths of given points in the generating curve * ; then each element of the surface intercepted between two of the planes spoken of will , by these spiral lines , be divided into a series of oblique parallelograms , two adjacent sides ( containing an acute angle ) of each of which , may be considered as intersections with the conchoidal surface of two planes , which intersect one another in an ordinate of the generating curve ; one of these planes is , a tangent to one of the spiral lines spoken of , and the other is the plane of the generating curve itself .
Now let us suppose the inclination of these planes to one another to be constant , as is always the case in shells , and let it be represented by A. Let moreover the inclination , to its ordinate , of the tangent to the generating curve be represented by i ; and the inclination to the same ordinate of the tangent to the spiral line by a. We have then given the in clination A of two planes to one another , and the inclinations p and c of two lines , drawn in them respectively , to the intersection of these planes ; whence by a wellknown formula , of spherical trigonometry , if * represent the inclination of these lines to one another , cost = cos is cos ay + sin p sin oa cos A. Moreover , if the two adjacent sides of the parallelogram , being elements of the generating curve , and the spiral , be represented by As and A S ; then since their inclination is I , the area of the parallelogram is represented by A S.

Now let us suppose the generating curve to revolve , not altering its dimensions , but sliding along the axis ; then a= g.@cost = sin cosA , and sin= A/ I + sin2Atan-p.cospalso in this case AS =y cosec A ; the area of the elementary parallelogram becomes then d , y2 ds y A2 @ .

Suppose the solid included between PC and QC ( fig. 3 .
) to be divided into an infinite number of prismatic elements by planes perpendicular to P C , and perpendicular and parallel to A z ; and let mr ( fig. 5 .

Assuming then O to be measured from the plane z y , the momentum of the element mr about the plane zy is represented by ( momentum of inertia of elementary plane m q ) sin O sin A0 cos2 A 0 , and the momentum of the same element about the plane zx is represented by ( momentum of inertia of elementary plane m q ) cos 0 sin A0 COS2 A 0 .
Hence if we imagine two solids to be generated , one by the revolution of P C , without altering its dimensions , through the angle PC Q. and the other by the revolution of QC through the same angle ; and if we take I to represent the momentum of inertia of the plane P C ; then will the momentum of the first solid about the plane z9 be represented by I sin 0 sin A0 cos2 A 0 , and that of the second by ( I+deA0 + ... ) sin ( 0 +AO ) sin A 0cos2 A 0 .
Now the momentum of the elementary solid PCQ evidently lies between those of these elementary solids .

The generating curve has here been supposed to revolve about the axis A z , otherwise retaining its position upon it .
If we suppose PC to slide along the axis as it revolves ( fig. 4 .
) , the moment of the elementary solid PCQ about A z , and therefore the moments M1 and M2 of the whole solid about the planes zx and zy will remain unaltered .
Another dimension will however now have become necessary to determine the position of the centre of gravity ; viz , its distance from a given point in the axis A z , measured along that axis .
Let V ( fig. 4 .
) be the point where the generating curve intersects the axis A , z ; .

Moreover , the moment of the actual element of the conchoidal surface evidently lies between the moments of these imaginary elements ; as before , therefore , the whole moments of the conchoidal surface about the planes zx and z y , being represented by N1 and N2 , dN_ K dS de --sin 3df dN2 K dS d=0 Cos 0 di Similarly , if N3 represent the moment of the surface about a vertical plane perpendicular to the axis A z , and passing through the point V ; and if x be an abscissa to any point of the generating curve measured along the axis from that point ; and if H represent the integral fxyd s , taken in respect to the whole perimeter of the generating curve ; then dN3 H dS d ?

The generating curve of a turbinated shell remains similar to itself as it revolves ; the statical moment of its perimeter varies therefore as the square , and the moment of inertia of its perimeter as the cube , of any of its linear dim ensions .
In like manner the statical moment of the area of its generating curve varies as the cube , and the moment of inertia as the fourth power , of any of its linear dimensions .
