I. " Report on the New Unit of Electrical Resistanice proposed and issued by the Com:imittee on Electrical Stanadards appointed in 1861 by the British Association .
" By FLEEMING JENKIN , Esq. Coimmunicated by Professor A. W. W7'ILLIAMSON .
Received March 20 , 1865 .
Sir Hiumphry Davy , in .
1821 * , published his researches proving a difference in the conducting-power of metals and the decrease of that power as their temiperaturle rose .
This quality of metals was examinied by Snow H-larris , Cummling , and E. Becquerel , whose table of coinductingpowers , com-piled by the aid of his differential galvanometer , and published in 1826t , is still frequently quoted , and is inideed remarkable as the result of experiments made before the publication by Ohm , in 1827t , of the true mathematical theory of the galvanic circuit .
The idea of resistanlce as the property of a conductor was initroduced by Ohm , who conceived the force of the battery overcoming the resistance of the conductors and produicinrg the current as a result .
Sir Humphry Diatvy , on the contrary , and other writers of his time , conceived the voltaic battery rather as continually reproducing a charge , somewhat analogous to that of a Leyde.n jar , which was discharged so soon as a conductor allowed the fluid to pass .
The idea of resistanlce is the necessary corollary of the conception of a force doing some kind of work ?
, whereas the idea of conducting-power is the result of an obvious analogy when electricity is conceived as a fluid , or two -uids , allowed to pass in different quantities through ( lifferent wires from pole to pole .

The writer cdoes not ncani by this that electrical and mechanical resistance are truly an , alogoits , or that a entrrenit truly represents work .
qualities of conducting-power and resistance are naturally expressed by reciprocal numbers , and the terms are used in this sense in the early writings of Lenz ( 1833 ) * , who , with Fechnert , and Pouillett , established the truth of Ohm 's theory shortly after the year 1830 .
The conception of a unit of resistance is implicitly contained in the very expression of Ohm 's law ; but the earlier writers seem to have contented themselves with reducing by calculation the resistance of all parts of a heterogeneous circuit into a given length of some given part of that circuit , so as to form an imaginary homogeneouis conductor , the idea of which lies at the basis of Ohm 's reasoning .
These writers , therefore , generally speak of the resistance as the " reduced length " of the conductor , a term still much used in France ( vide Daguin , Jamin , Becquerel , De la Rive , and others ) .
The next step would naturally be , when comparing different circuits , to reduce all resistances into a length of some one standard wire , though this wire might not form part of all or of any of the circuits , and then to treat the unit length of that standard wire as a unit of resistance .
Accordingly we find Lenz ( in 1838 ?
) stating that 1 foot of No. 11 copper wire is his unit of resistance , and that it is 19 9 times as great as the unit he used in 1833* , which was a certain constant part of the old circuit .
In the earlier paper the resistanices are treated as lengths , in the later as so many " units .
" Lenz appears to have choseni his unit at random , and apparently without the wish to impose that unit upon others .
A further advance is seen when Prof'essor Wheatstone , in his well-known paper of 184311 , proposes 1 foot of copper wire , weighing 100 grains , not only as a unit , but as a standard of resistance , chosen with reference to the standard weight and length used in this country .
To Professor Wheatstone also appears due the credit of constructing ( in 1840 ) the first instruments by which definite multiples of the resistance-unit chosen might be added or subtracted at will from the circuit l. He was closely followed by Poggendorff ?
and Jacobi** , the description of whose apparatus , indeed , precedes that of the Rheostat and Resistance-coils , although the writer understands that they acknowledge having cognisance of those inventions .
Resistance-coils , as the means of adding , not given lengths , but given graduated resistances to any circuit , are now as necessary to the electrician as the balance to the chemist .
In 1846 IHankeltt used as unit of resistance a certain iron wire ; in 1847 I. B. Cookel4 speaks of a length of wire of such section and conductingpower as is best fitted for a standard of resistance .
Buff ? ? ? ?
and Horsford 1111 in the same year reduce the resistance of their experiments to lengths of a given German-silver wire , and as a fuLrther definitioni they give its value as compared with pure silver .
To avoid the growing inconvenience of this multiplicity of standards , Jacobi * ( in 1848 ) sent to Poggendorif and others a certain copper wire , since well known as Jacobi 's standard , desiring that they would take copies of it , so that all their results might be expressed in one measure .
He pointed out , with great justice , that mere definition of the standard used , as a giveni len:gth and weight of wire , was insufficient , and that good copies of a standard , even if choseni at random , would be preferable to the reproduiction in one laboratory of a standard prepared and kept in another .
The present Committee fully indorse this view , although the definition of standards based on weights and dimensions of given materials has since then gained greatly in precision .
Until about the year 185-0 measurements of resistance were confilned , with few exceptions , to the laboratory ; but about that time underground telegraphic wires were introduced , and were shortly followed by submarine cables , in the examination and manufacture of which the practical engineer soon found the benefit of a knowledge of electrical laws .
Thus in 1847 the officers of the Electric and International Telegraph Company used resistance-coils made by Mr. W. F. Cooke , apparenitly multiples of Wheatstone 's original standard , which was nearly equal to the No. 16 wire of commerce ; and Mr. C. F. Varleyt states that , even at that date , he used a rough mode of " distance testing .
" In 1850 , Lieut. Werner Siemens4 published two methods for determining , by experiments made at distant stations , the position of " a fault"-that is to say , a connexioni between the earth and the conducting-wire of the line at some point between the stations .
In one of these plans a resistance equal to that of the battery is used , and the addition of resistances is also suggested ; and Sir Charles Bright , in a Patent dated 1852 ?
, gives an account of a plani for determining the position of a fault by the direct use of resistance-coils .
Sinice that time new methods of testing for faults and of examining the quality of materials employed , and the condition of the lilne , have been cointinually invented , almost all turning , more or less , on the measurement of resistance ; greater accuracy has been continually demanded in the adjustment of coils and other testing-appalratus , until we have now reached a point where we look back with surprise at the rough and ready means by which the great discoveries were made on which all our work is founded .
The first effect of the comimercial use of resistance was to turn the " feet " of the laboratory into " miles " of telegraph wire .
Tfhus we find employed as units , in England the mile of No. 16 copper wire 1 , in Germany the German mile of No. 8 iroln wire , and in France the kilometre of iroln wire [ Tofacepage 157 .

of 4 millimetres diameter .
Several other units were from time to time proposed by LaDgsdorf * , Jacobit , Marie-Davy W , Weber ?
, W. Thomson 1 , and others , with a gradually increasing perception of the points of chief importance in a standard ; but nione of these were generally accepted as the one recognized measure in any coulntry .
To remedy the continually increasing evils arising from the discrepancies invariably found between different sets of coils , Dr. Wernier Siemens ( in 1860 ?
T ) constructed standards , taking as unit the resistanice of a column of chemically pure mercury 1 metre lonig , having a section equal to I millimetre square , and maintained at the temperature of 0 ?
Centigrade"4 .
Dr. Siemens supposed that this stanidard could be reproduced without much difficulty where copies could not be directly obtainied .
Mercury had been proposed before as a fitting material for a standard by Marie-Davy and De la hivte ; but Dr. Siemens merits especial recognition , as the coils and apparatus he issued have been made with great care , and have materially helped in introducing strict accuracy tt .
The question had reached this point when ( in 1861 ) the British Association , at the suggestion of Professor W. Thomsoln , appointed a Committee to determine the best standard of electrical resistance .
This Committee , aided by a grant from the Royal Society , has now issued a new standard , the subject of the present paper .
The writer has hitherto described those unlits only which are founded on a more or less arbitrary size and weight of some more or less suitable material ; but measurements of resistance can be conceived and carried out entirely without reference to the special qualities of any material whatever .
In 1849 Kirchhoff 4J had already effected a measurement of this kind ; but it is to WV .
Weber ? ? ? ?
that we owe the first distinct proposal ( in 1851 ) of a definite system of electrical measurements , according to which resistance would be measured in terms of an absolute velocity .
This system of measures he called absolute electromagnetic measure , in analogy with Gauss 's nomenclature of absolute magnetic measure .
The Committee have decided that Weber 's proposal is far preferable to the use of any unit of the kind previously described .
Setting aside the difficulties in the way of their reproduction , which are by no means contemptible , arbitrary material standards , whether of mercury , gold , silver , platinum , or any other material , would be heterogeneous isolated units without any natural connexion with any other physical units .
The unit proposed by Weber , on the other hand , forms part of a symmetrical natural system , including both the fundamental units of length , time , and mass , and the derived electrical units of current quantity and electromotive force .
Moreover it has been shown by Professor W. Thomson* , who accepted and extended Weber 's proposal immediately on its appearance , that the unit of absolute work , the connecting link between all physical forces , forms part of the same system , and may be used as the basis of the definition of the absolute electromagnietic units .
The full grounds of the choice of the Committee could only be explained by a needless repetition of the arguments given in the reports already made to the British Association .
It will be sufficient here to state that , in the absolute electromagnetic system , the following equations exist between the mechanical and electrical units : W=C2Rt.(1 ) where W is the work done in the time t by the current C conveyed through a conductor of the resistance R. This equation expresses Joule and Thomson 's law .
C_ E , ... ... ... ... ( 2 ) where E is the electromotive force .
This equation expresses Ohm 's law .
Q=Ct,.(3 ) expressing a relation first proved by Faraday , where Q is the quantity of electricity conveved or neutralized by the current in the time t. Finally , the whole system is rendered determinate by the condition that the unit length of the unit current must produce the unit force on the unit pole ( Gauss ) at the unit distance .
If it is preferred to omit the conception of magnetism , this last statement is exactly equivalent to saying that the unit current conducted round two circles of unit area in vertical planes at right angles to each other , one circuit being at a great distance D above the other , will cause a couple to act between the circuits of a magnitude equal to the reciprocal of the cube of the distance D. This last relation expresses the proposal made by Weber for connecting the electric and magnetic measure .
These four relations serve to define the four magnitudes R , C , Q , and E , without reference to any but the fundamental units of time , space , and mass ; and when reduced to these fundamental units , it will be found that the measurement of R involves simply a velocity , i. e. the quotient of a length by a time .
It is for this reason that the absolute mte foot measure of resistance is styled metr or oo , precisely as the comisecond secoiid ' mon noni-absolute unit of work inivolving the product of a weight inlto Ea length is styled kilogrammetre or foot-pound .
The Comnlittee have choseni as fundameental units the second of time , the metre , and the mass of the Paris gramme .
The metrical rather than the British system of units was selected , in the hope that the new unit might so find better acceptance abroad , and with the feeling that while there is a possibility that we may accept foreign measures , there is lno chance that the Continent will adopt ours .
The uniit of force is taken as the force capable of producing in one second a velocity of one metre per seconid in the mass of a Paris gramme , and the unit of work as that which would be done by the above force acting through ouie metre of space .
These points are very fully explained in the British Association Report for 18639 , and in the Appelndix C to that Report by Professor J. Clerk Maxwell and the writer .
mnetre The mag , nitude of the-----------is far too small to be practically convenient , t ) ~~seconid and the Committee have therefore , while adopting the system , chosen as their standard a decimal multiple 10 's times as great as Weber 's unit the millimetre\ or 107 times as great as the metre This magnitude\~ second r second T is not very different from Siemens 's mercury uriit , which has been founcl convenient in practice .
It is about the twenty-fifth part of the mile of No. 16 impure copper wire used as a standard by the Electric and International Companly , and about once and a half Jacobi 's unit* .
It was found necessary to undertake entirely fresh experiments in order to determine the actual value of the abstract standard , and to express the same in a material standard which might form the basis of sets of resistancecoils to be used in the usuial manner .
These experiments , made during two years with two distilnct sets of apparatus by Professor J. C. Maxwell and the writer , according to a plan devised by Professor W. Thomson , aie .
fully described in the Reports to the British Association for 1863 and 1864. .
The results of the two series of experiments made in the two years agree withini 02 per cent. , and they show that the inew standard does not probably differ from true absoluite measure by 01 per cent t. It is not far from the mean of a somewhat widely differing series of determinations by Weber .
In order to avoid the inconivenience of a fluctuiating standard , it is proposed that the new standard shall not be called " absolute mrieasure , " or metre .
described as so many m but that it shall receive a distinietive name , seconds such as the B. A. unit , or , as -IN1r .
Latimer Clarki su ' , gests , the c " Ohmad , " so that , if hereafter improved methods of determination in absolute measure are discovered or better experiments made , the standard neecl not be changed , but a small coefficient of correction applied in those cases in which it is necessary to convert the B. A. measuLre into absoluite measure .
Every unit in popular use has a distinietive niame ; Nwe say feet or grains , not unlits of length or units of weight ; and it is in this way only that ambiguity can be avoided .
There are many absolute measures , according as the foot and grain , the millimetre and milligramme , the metre and grnamme , &amp;c. are used as the basis of the system .
Aniother chance of error arises from the possibility of a mistake in the decinmal mnultiple used as standard .
For all these reasons , as well as for convenience of expression , the writer would be glad if Mr. Clark 's proposal were adopted and the unit called aln Ohmad .
Experiments have been made for the Committee by Dr. Matthiessen , to determinie how far the permanency of material standards may be relied on , and under what conditions wires unaltered in dimension , in chemical composition , or in temperature change their resistance .
Dr. Matthiessen has established that in some metals a partial ainnealing , diminiishing their resistance , does take place , apparently due to age only .
Other metals exhibit no alteration of this kind ; and no permanent change due to the passage of voltaic currents has been detected in any wires of any metala conclusion contrary to a belief which has very generally prevailed .
The standard obtainied has been expressed in platinum , in a gold-silver alloy , in a platinum-silvrer alloy , in a platinium-iridium alloy , and in mercury .
Two equal standards have been prepared in each metal ; so that should time or accident cauise a change in one or more , this change will be detected by reference to the others .
The experiments and considerationis which have led to the choice of the above materials are fully given in the Report to the British Association for 1864 .
The standards of solid metals are wires of from 05 millim. to 08 millim. diameter , and varying from one to two metres in length , insulated with white sIlk wound round a lonig hollow bobbin , and then saturated with solid paraffin .
The long hollow form chosen allows the coils rapidly to assume the temperatuire of any surrouinding medium , and they can be plunged , without injury , into a bath of water at the temperature at which they correctly express the standard .
The mercury standards consist of two glass tubes about three-quarters of a metre in length .
All these standards are equal to one another at some temperature stated on each coil , and lying between 140.35 and 160.5 C. None of them , when correct , differ more than 003 per cent. from their value at 150-5 C. Serious errors have occasionally been introduced into observations by resistance at connexions between different parts of a voltaic circuit , as perfect metallic contact at these points is often prevented by oxide or dirt of some kind .
Professor Thomson 's method of inserting resistances in the Wheatstone balance ( differential measurer ) has been adopted for the standards , but in the use of the copies which have been issued it has been thought that sufficient accuracy would be attained by the use of amalgamated mercury connexions .
In the standards themselves permanence is the one paramount quality to be aimed at ; but in copies for practical use a material which changes little in resistance with change of temperatuire is very desirable , as otherwise much time is lost in waiting till coils h:ave cooled after the passage of a currenit ; moreover large corrections have otherwise to be employed when the coils are used at various temperatures ; and these temperatures are frequently not known with perfect accuracy .
German silver , a suitable material in this respect , and much used hitherto , has been found to alter in resistance , in some cases , without any known cause but the lapse of time , since the change has been observed where the wires were carefully protected against mechanical or chemical injury .
A platinum-silver alloy has been preferred by the Committee to Germnan silver for the copies which have been made of the standard .
These have been adjusted b)y Dr. iAatthiessen so as to be correct at some temperature not difTering more than 10 from 150.5 C. The resistance of platinum-silver changes about 0(031 per cent. for each degree Centigrade within the limits of 50 above and below this temperature ; this change is even less than that of German silver .
The new material seems also likely to be very permanent , as it is little affected by annealing .
The form of the copies is the same as that of the standard , with the exception of the terminals , which are simple copper rods ending in an amalgamated surface .
Twenty copies have been distributed gratis , and notices issued that others can be procured from the Committee for ?

The Committee also propose to verify , at a small charge , any coils made by opticianis , as is done for thermometers and barometers at Kew .
Dr. Matthiessen reports , with reference to the questiont of reproduction , that given weights and dimenisions of several pure metals might be employed for this purpose if absolute care were taken .
The reproduction , in this manner , of the mercury unit , as defined by Dr. Siemens , differs from the standards issued by him in 1864 about 8-2 per thousand if the same specific gravity of mercury be used for both observations* .
Each observer uses for his final value the mean of several extremnely accordant results .
It is therefore to be hoped that the standard will never have to be reproduced by this or any similar method .
Oni the other hand , four distinct observers , with four different apparatus , using four different pairs of standards issued respectively by Dr. Siemeens and the Committee , give the B. A. unit as respectively equal to 1 0456 , 10455 , 1-0456 , and 1-0457 of Siemens 's 1864 unit .
It is certain that two resistances can be compared with an accuracy of onie part in one hunidred thousand-an accuracy wholly unattainable in any reproduction by weights and measures of a given body , or by fresh reference to experiments on the absolute resistance .
The above four com* If Dr. Matthiessen uises the sp. gr. of 13 596 , as given by Regnault , .
the differenco from Dr. Siemens 's standard is 5 per thousand .
parisons , two of which were made by practical engineers , show how far the present practice and requirements differ from those of twenity and even ten years ago , when , although the change of resistance due to change of temperature was known , it was not thought necessary to specify the temperature at which the copper or silver standard used was correct .
The difficulty of reproducing a standard by simple reference to a pure metal , further shows the unsatisfactory nature of that system in which the conducting-power of substances is measured by comparison with that of some other body , such as silver or mercury .
Dr. Matthiessen has frequently pointed out the discrepancies thus produced , although he has himself followed the same system pending the final selection of a unit of resistance .
It is hoped that for the future this quality of materials will always be expressed as a specific resistance or specific conducting-power referred to the unit of mass or the unit of volume , and measured in terms of the standard unit resistance , that the words conducting-power will invariably be used to signify the reciprocal of resistance , and that the vague terms good and bad conductor or insulator will be replaced , in all writings aiming at scientific accuracy , by those exact measurements which can now be made with far greater ease than equally accurate measurements of length .
There is every reason to believe that the new standard will be gladly accepted throughout Great Britain and the colonies .
Indeed the only obstacle to its introduction arises from the difficulty of explaining to inquirers what the unit is .
The writer has been so much perplexed by this simple question , finding himself unable to answer it without entering at large on the subject of electrical measurement , that he has been led to devise the following definitions , in which rLone but already established measures are referred to .
The resistance of the absolute metre is such that the current generated second in a circuit of that resistance by the electromotive force due to a straight bar 1 metre long moving across a magnetic field of unit intensity * perpendicularly to the lines of force and to its own direction with a velocity of 1 metre per second , would , if doing no other work or equivalent of work , develope in that circuit in one second of time a total amount of heat equivalent to one absolute unit of work-or sufficient heat , according to Dr. Joule 's experiments , to heat 0O0002405 gramme of water at its maximum density 1 ?
Centigrade .
The new standard issued is as close an approximation as could be obtained by the Committee to a resistance ten million times as great as the absolute metre .
The straight bar moving as described above in a second ' maginetic field of unit intensity , would require to move with a velocity of ten millions of metres per second to produce an electromotive force which would generate in a circuit of the resistance of the new standard the same mretre stne h currenlt as would be produced in the circuit of onie se resistance by the seconcl electromotive force due to the motion of the bar at a velocity of one mnetre per second .
The velocity required to produce this particular current* being in each case proportionlal to the resistance of the circuit , may be used to measure that resistance , and the resistance of the B. A. unit may therefore be said to be ten millions of metres per secoIld , or 107 metres second It is feared that these statements are stil too complex to fulfil the purpose of popular definitions , but they may serve at least to show how a real velocity may be used to measure a resistance by using the velocity with which , unider certaini circumstances , part of a circuit must be made to move in order to iniduce a given currenit in a circuit of the resistance to be measured .
That current in the absolute system is the unit current , and the work done by that unit current in the uniit of time is equal to the resistance of the circuiit , as results from the first equation stated above .
Those who from this slight sketch may desire to know more of the subject will find full information in the Reports of the Commrnittee to the British Association in 1862 , 1863 , aand 1864 .
The Committee continLue to act with the view of establishing and issuing the correlative units of current , electromotive force , quanitity , and capacity , the standard apparatus for which will , it is proposed , be deposited at Kew along with1 the ten standards of resistanice already constructed with the finds voted by the Royal Society .
APPENDIX B. The following Table shows the degree of concordance obtained in the separate experiments used to determnine the unit .
The determinations were made by observing the deflections of a certaini magnet when a coil revolved at a given speed , first in one direction , and then in the opposite direction .
The first columnl shows the speed in each experimenit ; the second shows the value of the B. A. unit in terms of 1O ' metres as calculated from .
the second ' single experiments .
A difference constanitly in one direction may be observed in the values obtained when the coil revolved different ways .
This difference depended on a slight bias of the suspending thread in one direction .
The third columni shows the value of the B. A. unit calculated from the pair of experiments .
The fourth shows the error of the pair from the mean value finally adopted .
In the final mean adopted , the 1864 determination was allowed five times the weight allowed to that of 1863 .
