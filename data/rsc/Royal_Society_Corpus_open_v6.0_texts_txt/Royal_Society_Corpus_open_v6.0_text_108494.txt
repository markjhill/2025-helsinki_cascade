SECTION XI.-On the Quadrature of the Logarithmic Ellipse and of the Logarithmic Hyperbola .
LXXXIV .
IN the former part of this paper , printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1852 , the author has shown that the geometrical types of those integrals , named by LEGENDRE and others elliptic functions , are the curves of symmetrical intersection of surfaces of the second order .
In the progress of those investigations he discovered two curves , which he called the Logarithmic Ellipse and the Logarithmic Hyperbola .
The properties of these curves have the same analogy to the paraboloid of revolution that spherical conics have to a sphere , or which ordinary conic sections bear to a plane .
To determine the areas of those curves , or rathel the portions of surface of the paraboloid bounded by them , appeared to the author a problem not undeserving of investigation .

The logarithmic ellipse is defined as the curve of intersection of a paraboloid of revolution with an elliptic cylinder whose axis coincides with that of the paraboloid .
The logarithmic hyperbola , in like man\\ ner , may be defined as the curve of intersection of a paraboloid of revolution with / /a cylinder whose base is an hyperbola , and whose axis coincides with that of the paraboloid .
/ \ Through the vertex Z of the paraboloid let two parabolas be drawn indefinitely f\ near to each other , ZP , ZQ , and let two planes indefinitely near to each other at right angles to the axis OZ cut the parabolas in the points u , u ' , v , v ' .
The little trapezoid uvu'v ' is the element of the surface , and if the normal un makes the angle p with the axis OZ , d.4 being the elementary angle between the planes , uu'=k tanpdd , , k being the semiparameter of the generating parabola .

Now when the area is 0 , sec p= 1 , and therefore constant =--d .
Whence area=--dI(sec3p- ) ... ... .
( 43 .
) This is the general expression for the surface of a paraboloid between two principal planes , and bounded by a curve .
When this curve is the logarithmic ellipse , let the area be put ( AH ) .
We must now express 4 and p0 as functions of another variable 0 .

Since a2 &gt; a+k2 ' e2 &gt; i2 , or the function of the third order is of the circular form .

There is one particular case when the area of the logarithmic hyperbola may be represented by a very simple expression .
Let k=b , then if we turn to ( 448 .

Hence ( 452 .

) a value entirely independent of elliptic integrals , and which may be represented by a right line and the difference of two circular arcs .

) , this expression denotes an arc of the spherical ellipse whose principal angles are given by the equations ( 464 .
) , and whose radius is V/ r--kki .
Hence if a sphere be described whose radius is not r , but Vr2-kk , , the length of the curve , the intersection of the sphere ( r ) with the paraboloid ( kkl ) will be equivalent to that of a spherical ellipse described on the sphere whose radius is Vr-kk , .
When r=k , k being greater than k , , ( 459 .
) becomes ds d=2 vk(kk , ) or s=2k(k-k , )O .
Hence s is an arc of a circle .
That such ought to be the case is manifest , for in this case the sphere intersects the paraboloid in its circular sections , and\/ k is the cosine of the angle which the plane of the circular section of the paraboloid makes with its axis .
We have shown in the first part of this paper that the curves of intersection of concentric surfaces of the second order may be rectified by elliptic integrals .
When the intersecting surfaces are not concentric , the rectification of the curve of intersection may be reduced to the integration of an expression which may be called an hyperelliptic integral .
The general expression for the length of an arc of this curve will be an integral of the form S= d AX4 + ax3+ aX2 +x+jV a4b4 +c ex +f When the surfaces are symmetrically placed and have a common plane of contact , the above expression may be reduced to s=Sd V axa + bx2 + ex + This is also an hyperelliptic integral .
When , moreover , the surfaces are concentric and symmetrically placed , the preceding expression may still further be simplified to 2+ Qx ++ y =jXV ax2 + b+c ' which is the general form for elliptic integrals .
We can perceive therefore that the solution of the general problem , to determine the length of the curve in which two surfaces of the second order may intersect , investigated under its most general form , far transcends the present powers of analysis .
It is only when one of the surfaces becomes a plane , or when they are concentric and symmetrically placed , that the problem under these restricted conditions admits of a complete solution .
We may hence also surmise how vast are the discoveries which still remain to be explored in the wide regions of the integral calculus .
We see how questions which arise from the investigation of problems based on the most elementary geometrical forms-surfaces of the second order-baffle the utmost powers of a refined analysis , with all the aids of modern improvement .
It is not a little curious , that nearly all the branches of modern analysis , such as plane and spherical trigonometry , the doctrine of logarithms and exponentials , with the theory of elliptic integrals , may all be derived from the investigation of one geometrical problem , -To determine the length of an arc of the intersecting curve of two surfaces of the second order..LXXXVIII .
In the logarithmic hyperconic sections , we may develope properties analogous to those found in the spherical and plane sections , if we substitute parabolic arcs for arcs of great circles in the one , and for right lines in the other .
Here follow a few of those theorems .
1 .
From any point on a parabolic section of the paraboloid let two parabolas be drawn touching the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola , the parabolic arcs joining the points of contact will all pass through one point on the surface of the paraboloid .
2 .
If a hexagon , whose sides are parabolic arcs , be inscribed in a logarithmic ellipse or logarithmic hyperbola , the opposite parabolic arcs will meet two by two on a parabola .
3 .
If a hexagon , whose sides are parabolas , be circumscribed to a logarithmic ellipse , the parabolic arcs joining the opposite vertices will pass through a fixed point on the suirface of the paraboloid .
4 .
If through the centre of a logarithmic ellipse or logarithmic hyperbola two parabolic arcs are drawn at right angles to each other , meeting the curve in two points , and parabolic arcs be drawn touching the curve in these points , they will meet on another logarithmic ellipse or logarithmic hyperbola .
5 .
If a circle , whose radius is a , be described on the surface of the paraboloid , and therefore touching the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola at the extremities of its major axis , and from the extremities of any diameter two parabolic arcs be drawn to any third point on the circle , if one of these parabolic arcs touches the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola , the other will pass through a fixed point on the surface of the paraboloid .
6 .
If on the paraboloid we describe a circle whose radius is Va ' ?
/ , and if from the extremities of any diameter of this circle we draw parabolic arcs touching the logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola , these tangent parabolic arcs will meet on the circle .
These theorems will suffice .
There would be little difficulty in extending the list .
In fact nearly all the projective properties of right lines and conic sections on a plane may be transformed into analogous properties of great circles and spherical conic sections on the surface of a sphere , and of parabolic arcs and logarithmic sections on the surtace of a paraboloid .
SECTION XII.-On the Rectjation of the Lemnicates .
LXXXIX .
There is a particular class of plane curves , of which the lemniscate of BERNOULLI is an example , to which the principles established in the foregoing pages may be applied with much elegance .
lefinition.-This entire class of curves may be defined by the following property .
The square of the rectangle under the radii vectores drawn from the foci to any point on the curve is equal to a constant , plus or minus the square of the semidiameter multiplied by a constant quantity .
Let Q , Q ' be the foci , and O the centre , ,r Fig.28 the lines drawn from these points to any point on the curve .
Let OQ=OQ'=c , and letf be a variable constant .
Then by the definition ... ... ... ... ... -e .

) But e=(( +y2)2+c4+2cY2-2c2- , and y=a , +y2 , hence ( S+y)2=(/ 2+2c ) +(-2..y ... ) ... .
( 467 .
) This is the general equation of the curve , which assumes different forms , as we assign varying values tof and c. Some examples may be given .
( a. ) Let c=O , orf=oo , the equation is that of a circle .
( b. ) Letf2 &gt; 2c2 , and makeP2+2e=a2,2= , -2 ' ... = .
( 468 .
) the equation will become ( { +y3)2=a22+by2 .
* .
( c. ) Letf=2c2 .
The equation becomes ( x2+y2)2=4cx2 , or the equation is that of two equal circles in external contact .
( d. ) Let/ 2 &lt; 2c2 .
The equation becomes ( x2t2)2= -(2"+f2)x(2cc-f 2)y2 ; and a2 &gt; b2 .
( e. ) Letf2=0 .
The equation becomes ( x2+y2)2=2c2(x2-y2 ) , or the equation is that of the leinniscate of BERNOULLI .
( f. ) Letj2 , passing through 0 , be taken with a negative sign .
The equation in this case becomes ( x2+ , y2)2= ( 2_-f )x--(2c+f2)y2 , and b6 &gt; a2 In one case only does the equation of the lemniscate in its general form coincide with that of CASSINI'S ellipse ; namely , whenf=0 , and h=-c , h2 being the product of the radii vectores from the foci .
The definition of CASSINI 's ellipse being " a curve such that the product of the radii vectores drawn from two fixed points the foci-to a third point on the curve , shall be constant and equal to h2 , " its equation will obviously be , 2c being the distance between the foci , h4-4= ( X2+y2)a-2c2(x2_--y2 ) when h=c , ( 2+y2)2=2c2(x2_-y2 ) .
This is the equation of the lemniscate of BERNOULLI .
These elliptic lemniscates may also be defined as the orthogonal projections of the curves of symmetrical intersection of a paraboloid of revolution with cones of the second degree , having their centres at the vertex of the paraboloid .
Let a and 3 be the principal semiangles of one of the cones .
Its equation is cot2a.x2+cot2.y2=z2 .
2k 2k Make tana= - , tan3=--2 and the equation of the cone becomes aba + bid =4kb x2 Let the equation of the paraboloid be x2+y2=2kz .
Eliminating z , the equation of the projection of the curve of intersection will become ( x2+y2)2=a2x2 ?

When the section is an ellipse , the equation of this curve is , as in ( 469 .

( 470 .
) This equation may be put in the form r2=a2cos2X+b2 sin2X , r being the radius vector , and .
the angle it makes with the axis .
Let s be an arc of this curve ; s\-2 d , j2 ds\2 a4 cosX+ b4 sin2A since =dX =r +\ d } e cos+2 i-- ' Assume tan tank= , ... ... ... ... ( 471 .

) we shall see that they are precisely identical .
Whence we infer that an arc of the elliptic lemniscate is equal to an arc of a spherical ellipse which is self-supplemental .
It is very remarkable , that , whatever be the ratio of a to b the semiaxes of the plane ellipse or of the elliptic lemniscate , the arc is always equal to an arc of this particular species of spherical ellipse .
There is another property of this spherical ellipse , that its area , together with twice the lateral surface of the cone , is equal to a hemisphere .

We may obtain under another form an expression for the arc of an elliptic lermniscate .
Let the polar angle x be measured from the minor axis of the curve .

of a self-supplemental spherical ellipse .
Writing m for the parameter in this expression , we can easily show that the parameters in this and the preceding formula ( 474 .
) are conjugate parameters .
The condition of the conjugation of parameters in the circular form is ( 1 tn ) ( 1-m ) =( i2 ) .
~Now i2 ' a4 ab2 Now l+n=-- , 1-m_= , 1--2 whence the proposition is manifest .
An invariable relation exists between the parameter m and the modulus i ; for as a4--b4 am m=a4 and i2 = b+i 22 , ( 477 .
) hence i being given , m also is given ; or the elliptic lemniscate can be represented by only one species of spherical ellipse , that in which the sum of the principal arcs is equal to two right angles .
On the Hyperbolic Lemniscate .
XCII , The equation of the lemniscate in this case is ( X2+y2)2=a22_ 62Y22 ( x-.{-y , )-=a2x b'y2 .
Following the steps indicated in ( XC .

in the preceding equation , we shall find ds a.h-e.-.(479 .

That it is of the logarithmic form may thus be shown .
b2_al b2 Let b2m , and i2a+ b. V2 a Hence i2-m=b(a + b2 ) ; or i2 is greater than m ; but we know that the form is logarithmic when the square of the modulus is greater than the parameter , when it is affected with a negative sign .
This is a result truly remarkable .
All analysts know the impossibility of transforming the circular form into the logarithmic , or vice versed , by any other than an imaginary transformation .
The utmost efforts of the most accomplished analysts have been exhausted in the attempt ; yet in this particular case their geometrical connection is very close .

b2 sin2p or the djffrence between an arc of a hyperbolic lernniscate and an arc of a spherical ellipse may be expressed by an integral of the first order , together with a circular arc .
When a=b , the radius of the sphere is infinite , the sphere becomes a plane , so that it is not possible to express an arc of a spherical ellipse by the common lemniscate .

Let b &gt; a. In this case the arc of the hyperbolic lemniscate may be expressed by an arc of a logarithmic ellipse of a particular species , or one whose parameter and modulus are connected by the relation given in ( 481 .

When b=a , the above expression will become _ are df 2V 1J-/ 1 sin2 &lt; In this case the parameter of the paraboloid becomes infinite , and therefore the paraboloid a plane , just as the sphere became a plane in the last case ; so that we cannot express integrals of the third order , whether circular or logarithmic , by an arc of a common lemniscate .
XCIII .
FAGNANI , the Italian geometer , first showed that the lemniscate of the equilateral hyperbola might be rectified by an elliptic integral of the first older whose modulus is -He did not however extend his researches to the investigation of the general problem of the rectification of the lemniscates .
Although the lemniscates may be rectified by elliptic integrals of the third order , as well circular as logarithmic , yet these curves cannot be accepted as general representatives of integrals of the third order , because in the functions which Iepresent those curves , the parameters and the moduli are connected by an invariable relation , as in ( 477 .
) and ( 481 .
) .
Thus the elliptic lemniscate , whatever be the ratio of the axes of the generating plane ellipse , can be represented only by a particular species of spherical ellipse , that whose principal arcs are supplemental .
The general fundamental expressions for the rectification of curve lines , whether of single or double flexion , show that the arc of a curve may in general be represented as the sum of two quantities , an integrated and a non-integrated part , or as the proposition may be more briefly put , an arc of a curve may be expressed as the sum of an integral and a residual .
Thus the arc of a plane ellipse is equal to an integral and a residual , which latter is a right line .
An arc of a parabola is the sum of an integral and a residual , which latter is also a right line .
An arc of a spherical ellipse is the sum of an integral and a residual , the latter being an arc of a circle , while an arc of a logarithmic ellipse is made up of two portions , one a sum of integrals , the other the residual-being an arc of a common parabola .
It appears therefore to be an expenditure of skill in a wrong direction to devise curves whose arcs should differ from the corresponding arcs of hyperconic sections by the above-named residuals .
Thus geometers have sought to discover plane curves whose arcs should be represented by elliptic integrals of the first order , without any residual quantity the common lemniscate for example , when the modulus has a particular value .
It is possible that such may be found .
In the same way , an exponential* curve may be devised , whose arc shall be represented by the integral kTcinstead of taking it with the residual quantity k tanO secO , as the expression for an arc of a common parabola .
Thus geometers have been led to look for the types of elliptic integrals among the higher orders of plane curves , overlooking the analogy which points to the intersection of surfaces of the second order as the natural geometrical types of those integrals .
