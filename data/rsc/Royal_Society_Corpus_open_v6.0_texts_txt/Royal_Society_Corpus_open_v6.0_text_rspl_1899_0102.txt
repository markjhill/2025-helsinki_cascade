The experiments* described in the following paper form a continuation of researches on thermal radiation by one of the present authors , the results of which have been communicated to the Royal Society from time to time since 1884 .
t The main object of the present experiments was to push forward the inquiry as to the amount , and the relative quality , of the radiation from surfaces of various kinds in high vacuum .
When a body is maintained at a high temperature the total radiation from its surface depends , other things being the same , on the temperature and on the character of the radiating surface .
With a given temperature the total radiation , consisting of thermal , luminous , and actinic rays , seems to depend on the nature and on the ultimate texture of the radiating surface ; and the proportion in which vibrations of longer and shorter period are present seems to be governed by the * The experimental results of the paper were obtained two years ago .
Various circumstances have prevented earlier publication ; and it was originally intended to carry the investigation further before publishing .
Want of opportunity , however , makes this difficult for the present ; and we therefore deem it advisable to put our results on record just now , as they stand .
The present investigation , as well as the former work referred to in the text above , has been assisted by grants from the Government Grant Fund .

coarseness or fineness of the structure of the surface at which the rays take their origin .
Very little progress has yet been made towards an investigation of the question just referred to ; and the results of our experiments are intended to be a contribution in this direction .
In a former paper* by one of us the loss of heat in vacuum from the metallic surface of platinum wires was determined ; and Schleiermacherf has compared the loss from bright platinum wires and from platinum ?
wires whose surface was coated thinly with black oxide of copper .
Further experiments on this part of the subject seemed highly desirable , and were , therefore , undertaken by us .

The outer ends of the spiral springs terminate in loops and two pieces of glass rod , which are passed into tubes , cc , cY ( see figure ) , pass through the loops , so that the springs pull on these glass rods .
After the rods have been passed into their places , the ends of the tubes are closed up , except one , which is used for exhausting .

stout multiple platinum terminals ; and by means of these , which are fused , with the help of some white enamel , into the glass at the current is passed through the platinum wire .
At e , e , platinum wires are brought through the sides of the tube , and serve as potential electrodes ; and it is to keep the platinum wire ab in the middle of the length of the tube , and to avoid pulling unduly on the potential electrodes , that the two spiral springs , one at either end of the tube , are introduced .
Two exactly similar tubes were employed , as shown in fig. 2 .
They were connected together by a side tube , as shown ; and by means of a branch tube , attached to this side tube and connected to a Sprengel pump , the air was withdrawn from both tubes at the same time ; and by this arrangement it was provided that the vacuum in the two tubes should be at all times precisely the same .
In one of the tubes the platinum wire was brightly polished and perfectly smooth , just as it came from the maker 's hands .
The other tube contained a platinum wire cut from the same hank , but with the surface covered with an excessively fine coating of soot .
The soot was put on by passing the wire carefully through the upper part of a clear paraffin flame.* The usual arrangements were made for drying the vacuum of the tube , and of the pump , by means of phosphorus pentoxide ; and the vacuum was measured by means of the Gimmingham modification of the McLeod gauge .
The wires were heated , as in the former experiments , by means of an electric current .
Fig. 2 shows the electric connections .
A battery consisting of a sufficient number of secondary cells was employed ; and the current was controlled by means of suitable resistances , including a rheostat .
In the experiments here described the platinum wires of the two tubes , the resistances , and the battery were all connected in series , so that the same current passed through all.f The current in the circuit was measured by means of a Kelvin ampere gauge , and the difference of potentials at the two ends of each * The texture of the soot depends greatly on the source from which it is obtained and on the way in which it is applied to the wire .
Some preliminary experiments have been made with various coatings of soot , and comparisons have been attemped between surfaces finely coated with soot , and surfaces prepared with platinum black and with a fine coating of black oxide of copper chemically applied to the wire ( of .

T In another set of experiments the platinum wires were joined in parallel , and , by means of two rheostats , one connected in series with each platinum wire , an attempt was made to regulate the current in each wire so that the temperatures in the two should be the same .
This was found very difficult to carry out ; but it is intended to renew the attempt , and determine simultaneously the radiation from two wires with different surfaces , in the same vacuum , and at the same temperature .

of the platinum wires was measured by means of a high resistance reflecting galvanometer .
This potential galvanometer had a resistance of about 5000 ohms , and it was possible to insert in the galvanometer circuit an additional resistance of 10,000 ohms .
In order to ascertain the absolute value of the readings of the potential galvanometer , a standard coil of platinoid wire , whose resistance was known very accurately , was joined into the circuit , as shown in fig. 2 .
This resistance was of considerable length , and it was kept cool by being immersed in a bath of oil .
The following was the order of experimenting .
The pressure in the tubes was first reduced as much as possible by means of the Sprengel pump ; then a very small current , practically unable to heat any part of the circuit , was sent through the two platinum wires and the standard coil , and the potential difference between the two ends of each was determined .
This gave the ratio of the resistance of each of the platinum wires to that of the standard coil , all being cold , and at the same temperature .
The current from the battery of storage cells^was now suitably increased , and readings were taken in the following order :\#151 ; The current passing was first read .
Then the zero of the potential galvanometer was noted , and the deflection of the potential galvanometer when connected to the two ends of the standard coil was observed .
The electrodes of the potential galvanometer were next applied to one of the platinum wires , and the deflection noted ; then the deflection due to the second wire was observed .
A second reading was taken from the first wire and also from the second wire .
Usually these pairs of readings were identical , or nearly so , as no reading was taken until after ^the strong current had been passing through the circuit for sufficient length of time to allow the temperature of the whole to become perfectly steady .
Generally speaking , five minutes or more was allowed for this purpose .
Lastly the current was again read , and the zero of the potential galvanometer noted .
The readings detailed above enabled us to calculate the current passing through each wire and the resistance in that wire .
The length and cross section of each of the platinum wires ( practically identical ) were also known .
Thus the energy lost by radiation per square centimetre per second , C2R/ JS , could be calculated ; C being the current , R the resistance and S the surface of the radiating wire , and J being the dynamical equivalent of heat , all in absolute measure .
The measurement of the electric resistance of the wires also enabled us to calculate the temperatures of the wires by means of the results of a separate determination of the electric resistances , at different temperatures , of the wires themselves .
In a former paper , * the precautions and difficulties connected with * J. T. Bottomley , ' Phil. Trans. , ' A , 1887 .

273 the determination of change of resistances of platinum wires with temperature have been fully discussed .
In the present case each platinum wire , after having been used in the radiation experiment , was wrapped round the bulb of an air thermometer* of special construction .
the bulb and wire were then packed in asbestos wool , and placed in the laminated copper heating jacket described and figured in the paper just referred to .
The jacket was heated by means of one of Fletcher 's powerful " solid flame " burners , by means of which it could be kept for any length of time almost absolutely steady , at any temperature below the softening point of glass .
By means of stout copper electrodes the platinum wire was made one of the branches of a Wheatstone balance , and the electric resistance and temperature were simultaneously determined .
A considerable number of readings between 15 C. and 350 C. were taken , and from these an empirical formula was constructed , or a curve drawn to represent the relation between temperature and pressure at all intermediate points .
In one respect , the determinations , an account of which is given in the present paper , are not perfectly satisfactory .
W^e have not been able to take account in a proper way of the temperature of the enclosing envelope .
In order to be able to see the condition of the wires , and in particular to observe their appearance when they became luminous , glass envelopes were used in these experiments ; and owing to the nature of the arrangements and the method of experimenting , it was not found possible to immerse the glass envelopes in a cooling bath .
Consequently the glass became more or less heated during the experiments , and the heating was unequal in the cases of the bright wire and the sooted wire .
It has already been pointed outf that the proportions in which the radiations of longer period and shorter period are present in the total radiation depends on the radiating surface , other things being the same .
In the case of the sooted wire , the quantity of long-period radiation is , in proportion , far in excess of that proceeding from a bright metallic polished surface .
Consequently , with the same total electric energy supplied to both wires , the glass tube containing the sooted wire became much hotter than the tube containing the bright wire .
It has also been pointed outj that with a substance like glass , Conducting badly and somewhat diathermanous , it is impossible to tell how * J. T. Bottomley , " On a Practical Constant-volume Air Thermometer , ' Proc. Roy .

This thermometer has proved perfectly satisfactory ; and the separation of the volume gauge and pressure gauge make it extremely convenient for applications of the kind referred to in the text .

much heat is returned to the radiating wire from the interior skin of the tube , which no doubt rises to a high temperature during the experiment .
To a certain extent , therefore , the results which we have obtained must be considered as not affording results strictly comparable with those formerly obtained in which a metallic envelope cooled with water was used .
The absolute value of the radiation observed ought to be somewhat lower in amount than would have been found had the enclosing envelope been of metal and properly kept cool , and the disturbance from this cause must have been relatively greater in the case of the dull , than in the case of the bright , wire .
Experiments were made with platinum wires from three separate hanks .
A pair of wires of equal length was taken in each case .
One of these was left with its surface exactly as it was on being taken from the hank ; the other was sooted .
The two wires were then fixed in the glass tubes .
The wires are designated Btl3Bt2 , Pt3 , Pt4 , Pt5 , Pt6 .
The first of each pair is the bright wire ; the second is the sooted wire .
The diameters of the wires are as follows:\#151 ; Ptx and Pt2 , 0-0542 cm .
, Pt3 and Pt4 , 0-025 cm .
; Pt5 and Pt6 , 0*015 cm .
In Tables I and II specimens are given of the results obtained , in the manner described above , by observation and calculation .
The remainder of the results are embodied in the curves appended , which it is hoped will be found self-explanatory .
At the head of each table the particulars as to the wires referred to in the table are given .
In the following tables , III , IV , V , the loss of heat per square centimetre of surface for the several pairs of wires , bright and sooted , at various temperatures , is compared ; and the ratio between the radiation from the sooted wire and the radiation from the bright wire is calculated .
It will be seen that the numbers are in fair agreement .
What may be the causes of divergence from exact agreement it is impossible to say at the present stage of the inquiry ; but it may be conjectured that part of it at least is due to the difficulty , or impossibility , of keeping the vacuum which surrounds the wires in these experiments unchanged .
When the pressure is very low , the accession of the smallest quantity of gas to the surrounding space causes an enormous change in the rate of loss of heat , as has been shown in a previous part of this research ; and as the temperature rises it is always found that the vacuum becomes deteriorated , owing to the expulsion of gas from the body of the wire itself .
This gas must be removed by a fresh application of the pump , and , in fact , during the experiments the pump must be kept always at work .
Thus the vacuum is incessantly changing ; and , moreover , as the indications of the McLeod gauge lag very much behind , it is not even possible to know the exact state of the pressure at the instant when it is desired to make an observation as to current Thermal Radiation in Absolute Measure .
passing and resistance .
The consequence is that owing to the constantly altering state of the vacuum an irregularity is introduced in the loss of heat , and the irregularity tells more in the case of small wires than in the case of larger sizes .
In the case of the bright wire , Pt5 , the loss of heat was somewhat abnormal .
It is probable that the surface was lacking in polish .
It will be seen that the loss from the sooted platinum wires is about four to five times that from the bright wires at the same temperature .
In the paper of 1894 , already referred to , the radiation from a very brightly polished and burnished silvered copper globe , and that from the same globe sooted , were determined .
The highest temperature reached was about 230 ' C. , and in that case the sooted globe lost about ten times as much heat as the silvered globe under the same circumstances .
When the silvered globe had become tarnished , the radiation from its surface was so much increased that the loss from the sooted globe was only three times that from the tarnished silver .
