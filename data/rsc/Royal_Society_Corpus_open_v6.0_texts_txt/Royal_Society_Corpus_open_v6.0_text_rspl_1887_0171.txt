( Abstract .
) The authors have examined a variety of cells analogous to Becquerel 's " pile a oxygene ; " i.e. , containing two platinum or other non-oxidisable plates , one immersed in an acid fluid , the other in an alkaline one , the two fluids being connected by a wet wick or siphon , and either some oxidising agent being also contained in the acid or some reducing substance in the alkali .
In the first case continuous evolution of oxygen was brought about from the surface of the plate immersed in the alkali ; in the second the converse phenomenon was observed , i.e. , hydrogen was continuously evolved from the plate in the acid ; in each case the quantity of gas liberated was equivalent to the current passing as measured by a small silver voltameter .
Thus the following figures were obtained in various experiments , the measurements being made after sufficient amounts 490 Dr. C. R. A. Wright and Mr. G. Thompson .
of current had passed to about saturate with oxygen or hydrogen respectively the fluid in the collecting tube , and so avoid loss by solution ; in the first set the alkaline fluid was strong caustic soda solution ; in the second somewhat diluted sulphuric acid ( 1 to 4 or 5 water ) was the acid liquid .
Carbon plates were used in experiments G- and H ; platinum ones in all the others .

Various reducing agents were found ineffective in causing hydro- , gen evolution in this way ; thus , no noticeable amount of , hydrQgenj was produced when sodium sulphite or hypophosphite , potassiumi ferrocyanide , or manganous hydroxide and ammoniacal sal-ammoniac were used .
Similarly , no oxygen evolution was observed when a , mixture of sulphuric acid and barium dioxide , or hydrochloric acid : containing iodine in solution , was the acid fluid .
On the other hand^ the oxygen absorbed by a platinum sponge aeration plate was suffi-j ciently active to cause some four times as much permanent current toj pass as was produced when a solid platinum plate was used immersed some centimetres below the surface of the acid .
By substituting various metals and caustic soda or ammonia solution for the platinum plate and alkaline solution containing a reducing substance , tolerably energetic cells were obtained ; even in the case of metals not ordinarily regarded as belonging to the oxi-disable class , solution was readily brought about when the alkaline fluid contained potassium cyanide .
In all cases hydrogen was evolved from the surface of the opposed platinum plate immersed in sulphuric acid solution in quantity proportionate to the current passing , whilst a quantity of metal was dissolved usually sensibly equal to that representing the formation of the lowest oxide ; tin dissolved to a somewhat less extent , indicating the production of some stannic oxide , from 3 to 7 per cent , of the metal being dissolved in this form , and the rest as stannous oxide ; and mercury dissolved to form mercuric potassio-cyanide , 100 parts of metal dissolving for 108 of silver thrown down in the voltameter .
Gold , silver , and palladium readily evolved hydrogen when immersed in cyanide solution ; but platinum was ineffective , and iron gave only a faint action .
Thus the following figures were obtained in various experiments :\#151 ; 492 Voltaic Circles produced by Acid and Alkaline Fluids .

For every gram-equivalent of silver thrown down in the voltameter , consequently , a gram-equivalent of both acid and alkali must disappear by mutual neutralisation during the passage of the current .
This disappearance was verified quantitatively by titration in various experiments with no more lack of precision than the nature of the observation would lead one to anticipate .
We find that by combining two fluids , one alkaline and containing a powerful reducing agent , the other acid and containing an energetic oxidiser , with platinum plates immersed in each ( .
, caustic soda solution of pyrogallol , and sulphuric acid solution of chromic anhyOn Kreatinins .
.dride ) , continuous currents of very considerable power may be obtained when the internal resistance is diminished sufficiently by using cells of considerable magnitude ; e.g. , when made of the stone-waro and inner porous vessels usually employed for Grove 's cells , the porous vessel being cemented into the outer stoneware vessel ( by paraffin wax or other unattacked material ) in such a fashion as to jdivide it into three compartments separated one from the other by porous dividing walls ; the acid and alkaline fluids being placed in the two outermost compartments , and the innermost one being filled with a solution of a neutral salt , e.g. , sodium sulphate .
A large variety of analogous cells of more or less power can thus be formed by using different organic and inorganic reducing substances soluble in alkali , e.g. , ferrocyanides , hydrosulphites , opianates , \amp ; c. " On Kreatinins .

Part I. I was induced to undertake this investigation by a careful observation of the action of picric acid and potassium hydrate upon normal human urine at the boiling temperature .
The introduction of picric acid as a test for sugar in urine is due to my father , Dr. George Johnson , who accidentally discovered the production of a very dark colour on the addition of picric acid to a portion of saccharine urine which had been previously boiled with potassium hydrate .
He made this observation in^ November , 1882 .
The dark colour was found to be due to reduction of potassium picrate to potassium picramate by glucose at the boiling temperature , and in presence of potassium hydrate .
The reaction had been described by C. D. Braun nearly twenty years previously ( " Ueber die Umwandlung der Pikrinsaure in Pikraminsaiire und fiber die Nachweisung des Tratfbenzuckers , " * Fresenius , Zeitschrift , ' 1865 ) , but it had not hitherto been applied to any practical purpose .
Having observed the extreme delicacy of the test , and the ease with which the reaction is effected , my father determined to introduce it to the notice of the medical profession , not merely as a trustworthy qualitative test of extreme delicacy , but also as a means of estimating quantitatively the actual amount of glucose in diabetic urines .
In this latter object I did my best to assist him , and our united efforts resulted in the elaboration of a new , easy , and accurate method for
