A paper was also read , entitled &lt; f An Account of the Construction of a fluid refracting Telescope of eight inches aperture and eight feet nine inches in length , made for the Royal Society by George Dollond , Esq. F.R.S. " By Peter Barlow , Esq. F.R.S. The author has , in former papers read to this Society , pointed out the great variety of cases included under the general formulie relating to the operation of fluid refracting telescopes , and stated the difficulty of selecting , independently of experiment , the particular case which was likely to produce the best result .
This subject is pursued in the present paper ; and the principles and calculations stated at length which the author has applied in the construction of the telescope which the Council of the Royal Society directed should be made by Mr. Dollond , under the superintendence of the author , in order to put these principles to the test of experiment , and to decide the question of the expediency of proceeding in the construction of a similar telescope of much larger dimensions .
When the experimental telescope was completed , it was found that its performance agreed in every respect with the computed results , as well in focal distance as in chromatic and spherical aberration .
The arrangement of the lenses was such , that the corrections are all of them made in the transmis ?
sion of the light through the fluid , and by the fluid only .
The author abstains from offering any remarks on ihe performance of this telescope , leaving it to those whom the Council of the Royal Society may appoint , to decide upon its merits .
He concludes by expressing his obligations to Mr. Dollond , for the readiness with which he complied with all the suggestions of the author , and for the accuracy with which he has executed every part of the instrument .
