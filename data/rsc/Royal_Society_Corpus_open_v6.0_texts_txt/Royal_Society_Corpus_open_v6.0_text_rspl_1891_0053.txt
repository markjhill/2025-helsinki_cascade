round in each of the guns , using the driving rings marked A , B , and 0 As it would be useless to attempt to draw general conclusions from single rounds , and as in guns of the calibre experimented with the difference between the driving rings is not very marked , I have treated the series as if all the rounds had been fired with the same driving ring ; the results are given in Table IX .

" On the Thermal Conductivities of Crystals and other Bad Conductors .

( Abstract .
) The author commences by pointing out the great differences between the results obtained in 1879 by G. Forbes for the con-1 ductivities of quartz in different directions and those obtained in 1883 by Tuschmidt .
He then refers to Kundt 's discovery , that ^ the metals stand in the same order as conductors , and as to the 1 velocity of propagation of light through them , and mentions that his 422 On the Thermal Conductivities of Crystals , fyc .
[ Feb. experiments were originally intended , to furnish data for a similar comparison for crystals , but that their object has been extended .
After some preliminary experiments , he adopted the " divided bar " method , which consists in placing a disc of the material the conductivity of which is required , between the ends of two bars of metal placed coaxially , heating one end of the combination , and observing , by means of thermo-junctions applied to the bars , the distribution of temperature along them , first , with the disc in position , second , with the bars in contact without the disc .
When the conductivity of the bar is known , these observations suffice to determine that of the disc .
The bars used were T9 cm .
diameter , and about 34 cm .
long .
The ends which came in contact with the discs were amalgamated , n-s this was found to be the best method of securing good contacts .
These bars were suspended horizontally in a frame , by means of strings passing over adjusting screws , which enabled the bars to be set accurately in the required position .
The temperatures were found by means of a copper-platinum-silver junction applied to points along the bars , at which small conical holes about ; 0'5 mm. diameter , containing mercury , were placed .
This junction was in circuit with a galvanometer , and the circuit was so arranged that its resistance could be found by a modification of Thomson 's bridge method .
The conductivity of the brass bar was determined before cutting , by the method\#151 ; due to Forbes\#151 ; of determining the loss of heat from the surface by allowing the bar to cool and observing the change of temperature with time , and then observing the steady distribution of temperature along the bar when heated at one end .
The author shows that change of both the " internal " and " external " conductivities with temperature must be taken into account in the equation for the distribution of temperature .
He takes each to be a linear function of the temperature , and finds finally the conductivity of the bar to be 0'27 c.g.s. unit , and to increase slightly with the temperature .
The discs used were of the same diameter as the bar , and were of various thicknesses , in order to make the distribution of temperature 'throughout the bars nearly the same in each case .
The following are the results obtained , the conductivities of a few other bodies being given , in order to show the positions of the bodies experimented on amongst conductors generally .
