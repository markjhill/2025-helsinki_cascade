" An Experimental Inquiry undertaken with the view of ascertaining whether any , and what signs of Current Force are manifested during the organic process of Assimilation in the Muscular and the Nervous Tissues in living animals."-Part III .

I. On the existence of Current Force in the Muscular Tissues .
After relating the conclusions arrived at by Matteucci in ; reference to the origin of the muscular current , the author endeavoured to obtain more direct evidence by forming a circuit-between the muscular tissue and the venous-blood ; the effectshoweverivere but slight ; , they nevertheless indicated the tissue and the venous tblod to be in opposite electric states .
The results of the experiments tend to confirm the inferences of Matteucci . ?
II .
On the existence of Current Force in the Nervous Tissues .
After referring to the results obtained by Pacinotti , Puccinotti ' Matteucci , and Du Bois Reymond , experiments are related in which it is shown that if one electrode be inserted into the substance of the brain , and the : other be brought .
into contact with the blood flowing , from the internal jugular vein , an effect upon the needle occurs indicating the blood to be positive ; an effect also was easily obtained if the latter electrode was placed in contact with any other part of the animal , such as the muscles .
Reasoning from the results obtained , combined with physiological evidence , it was consideredl that they tend to establish the conclusion that the effects are due to the .
changes which occur during the organic process of assimilation or nutrition .
