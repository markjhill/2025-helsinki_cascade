( Abstract .
) The subject of this communication forms part of a collection of fossil remains from Australia , recently acquired by the British Museum , and demonstrates the former existence in that continent of a land-lizard considerably surpassing in bulk the largest species now known .
The characters are chiefly derived from vertebrm , partially fossilized , equalling in size those of the largest existing Crocodiles ; they are of the 'proccelian ' type , but present lacertian modifications , and closely agree with those in the great existing ' Lace-lizard ' of Australia ( Hlydrosaurus giganteus , Gray ) , of which individuals upwards of six feet long have been taken .
A generic or subgeneric distinction is indicated by the comparatively contracted area of the neural canal , and by the inferior development of the neural spine , of the fossil vertebrae , which have belonged to an individual not less than twenty feet in length , calculated from the vertebre and proportions of the body of the existing Ilydrosauri .
For this , probably extinct lizard , the name of Megalania prisca is proposed .
The results of an extended series of comparisons of its vertebrae with those of recent and extinct Sauria are given ; and the paper is illustrated by drawings of the vertebrae of Megalania and those of Hydrosaurus .
