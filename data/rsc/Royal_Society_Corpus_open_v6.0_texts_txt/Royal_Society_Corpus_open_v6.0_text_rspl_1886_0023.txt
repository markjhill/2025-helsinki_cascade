In the course of an investigation into the nature of carbon filaments , such as are ordinarily used in the construction of incandescent lamps , my attention was arrested by certain variations in the amount of light emitted from filaments which were , to the best of my belief , of similar nature and composition , but which , when tested under precisely similar conditions , gave the most anomalous results .
I was also struck with changes which occurred to a greater or less degree in the light yielded by certain lamps when re-tested subsequent to a shock of over-incandescence , or long continued hard running at a high temperature ; the light yielded after this occurrence ( indeed the light yielded by any lamps that had been much used ) I found to be invariably lessened both in quantity and brightness , and to require a. considerable increase in the energy supplied to it to produce from the same filament the light it originally gave .
After seeking vainly to account for these irregularities from structural differences in the carbon filaments themselves , and after testing and re-testing many carbons made in a variety of ways , both by myself and others , it occurred to me that the composition or structure of the carbon itself , , of which the filaments were made , might have really little to do with the discrepancies and changes I had noticed .
All the carbons I had tried gave in turn the most irregular results , and although some of these were porous , and some dense and compact , the light emitted from any one of them per unit of surface for each unit of electrical energy supplied to it was very varied and uncertain , and did not appear to follow any condition of the porosity or denseness of the filament itself .
All the carbons in turn gave the same light per unit of surface208 Mr. M. Evans .
Observations on the [ Feb. 18 , when raised to the same incandescence , but the energy required to produce this light , or raise the filament to this incandescence , varied sometimes in a remarkable way .
At times a filament was found which , with 2 watts or volt amperes passing through it , would yield the light of the standard candle .
And again , with other filaments it sometimes occurred that no less than 5 volt amperes were required to produce this light .
On collating a number of these observations , and comparing the filaments themselves with their various testings , I noticed , I thought , some difference in the outward appearance of those filaments which had tested well and those that had required any large amount of energy to give a satisfactory light , and , following up this idea , I soon became convinced that it was to this surface appearance or condition that the whole question of economical light giving or otherwise might be traced .
All the filaments , it appeared , whose surfaces were of a dull black required the larger amounts of energy to yield the usual unit of light , while from those filaments with even moderately bright surfaces the light of the standard candle could be obtained for an expenditure of energy surprisingly less .
To ascertain with greater certainty if this idea were correct , I prepared a number of carbons made from a vegetable fibre which , though yielding a somewhat porous carbon , was strong and uniform in texture .
Having selected two filaments as like each other as the eye could determine , and having ascertained by careful measurement that they were both of exactly the same length and diameter , and therefore of .equal surface , I subjected each carbon in turn to the action of an electrical current in a hydrocarbon atmosphere , so regulating the current as to maintain the carbon filament at a white heat in the vapour until a sufficient deposit of carbon upon its surface was obtained .
To provide for the deposit of carbon upon the one filament being as dull a black as possible , I used for the depositing medium an atmosphere of ordinary coal-gas drawn from a domestic burner .
A large glass jar was filled with this , and a constant current of the cold gas kept circulating through it during the deposit , and the resulting surface was all that could be desired .
It had all the appearance of being coated with lampblack , but the coating was quite permanent , and did not brush off , or even soil the fingers in ban dling .
On the other of these two filaments I now deposited carbon of a bright silvery appearance in marked contrast with the dull black of that just described , and this deposit I found I could readily effect by using as the depositing atmosphere the very hot vapour of almost any hydrocarbon having a high boiling point , though from the porous nature of the carbons I was using I did not get the surface as brilliant ; as I subsequently obtained it from smoother carbons .

209 This filament was then mounted on platinum electrodes , as the other had been , enclosed in a similar glass globe , and exhausted of air , the vacuum being carried to about the xooVoo an atmosphere .
The remeasurement of these carbon filaments subsequent to the reduction of the carbon on their surfaces , showed no perceptible increase in their diameter , the deposit of carbon which had been added being in all likelihood less than the ten thousandth of an inch in thickness , and the surface areas of each filament still remained practically equal in all respects .
Having now two carbon filaments with which a comparative test might be made , and in which the conditions were in all respects identical , except in that of surface condition or polish , the one being like soot and the other like silver , I passed a series of known electrical currents through each in turn , registering the light produced against a standard candle burning 120 grains per hour in a good photometer provided with a sliding screen .
In Table Ho. I , Carbon A , are shown the testings of the blackened filament , and in Table II , Carbon B , those of the filament which was made bright .
In diagram Ho. 1 may be seen the plotting of these results and their relative curves .
The dotted curve marked Carbon A shows the testings of the black filament , and the curve marked with a plain hard white line , Carbon B , gives the testings of the filament which was bright .
The horizontal divisions in the diagram give the watts or volt amperes of energy passing through the filament , and the perpendiculars mark the corresponding candle powers .
From these tests it may be noticed that with two carbon filaments identical in all respects but in that of surface polish or brightness , the blackened filament required no less than 100 watts to keep its surface at an incandescence yielding 20 candles , whilst the filament with the bright surface was kept at the same incandescence , and gave an equal light with 74 watts only , also that each filament when consuming an energy of 4 watts per candle , that which was blackened required no less than 118 watts of energy to effect this ( besides having its surface incandescence strained to yield 28 candles ) , while the bright filament with 71 watts only effected the same economy , viz. , 4 watts only per candle , and had to give from its surface only 17f candles .
These results satisfied me that the condition of the carbon surface was wholly the cause of the large differences shown by these curves , and I determined therefore to carry out a more extended series of tests with carbons about which I knew nothing .
For this purpose , therefore , I procured two carbons of foreign manufacture , but by whom made I did not know .
The following were their chief characteristics .
The carbons were very nearly square in section , and appeared before carbonising to have been sliced from some homogeneous material like parchment paper .
Mr. M. Evans .
Observations on the [ Feb. 18 , They were both , I found from careful measurements , of precisely the same dimensions and surface area , and each presented the same dull dead black surface ; the cai'bon itself appeared exceedingly dense and hard .
Testing these filaments as I procured them , I placed them in bulbs and exhausted as before .

Tables III and VI give the photometric tests of these carbons as I procured them , and diagrams 2 and 3 show the plotting of these tests .
I have marked these filaments C and D , the black dotted line in diagram 2 being the curve for filament C , and the black dotted line in diagram 3 that for filament D. In these two curves the extreme uniformity with which these carbons tested is worthy of notice , the one giving nineteen and a half candles and the other twenty for the eighty watts supplied to each , Mr. M. Evans .

which not only well inside any error of observation , but is in great measure a sufficient proof of the extreme equality of the areas of their radiating surfaces .

213 1 now dismounted these filaments and subjected them to incandescence in the hot hydrocarbon vapour as before with carbon B. The result was highly satisfactory , as they both took a surface much brighter than carbon B had done .
Again remounting them and exhausting , they were placed in the photometer as before .
The results are given in Tables IY and VII , and the curves from these tables are shown by the bright hard lines CC and DD , diagrams 2 and 3 .
These curves appear fully to bear out the assumption arrived at in the former tests , Tables I and II , and the improvement in light radiation per unit of energy is especially marked in the case of filament C , where it may be noticed that at 2 watts of energy per candle of light the same filament in its black condition was strained to yielding sixty candles nearly , while in its polished state it had only to yield thirty-seven , and still be as economical in its electrical energy as before .
The same filament at 3 watts per candle , when black , had to give off 31 candles , equal to 270 candles per square inch of its surface , while in its polished state it required to give only 18 candles to equal 3 watts per candle , and its surface was strained only to the extent of 155 candles per square inch .
It is certain , therefore , that its lasting power with its surface bright would be many times greater at the foregoing expenditure of energy than in its black condition .
As the filaments were still unbroken and appeared capable of yet another test , I resolved to attempt the reblackening of them , and to ascertain if possible if the test-curve under these conditions would again revert to its former position , but I had now to reblacken over the bright surface which could not be removed .
The filaments were again successfully dismounted , and with some difficulty again reblackened over their former polished surfaces .
They were now tested , as is shown in Tables Y and VIII , and the corresponding curves are given in diagrams 2 and 3 , marked CCC , DDD .
The recession of the curves was in both cases nearly complete , any difference being fully accounted for by the incomplete reblackening of the carbon surface .
In carrying out these experiments I much regret not having made the necessary arrangements for simultaneously testing both the heat and light emitted from each filament in its blackened and bright condition .
I have little doubt the loss of efficiency when black was due to the energy supplied being radiated in large quantities as heat waves from the blackened surfaces , which these surfaces when bright would not permit .
This radiation of heat , however , which had not been converted into light by emission from a bright surface was abundantly manifested in the handling of the lamps .
The incandescent globe containing the bright filament could at all times be readily held in the hand even when giving its maximum of light , while the heat radiated from the filament when its surface was blackened was most Mr. M. Evans .
Observations on the [ Feb. 18 , intense , and not only caused at times severe burns , but occasionally would even char the little paper labels attached to the glass .
I also regret not having dissipated by a powerful current the black carbon deposited over the bright surface in the last case , as an increase of economy in working and light-giving should have resulted , and this would have been the more interesting as ordinarily it is just the other way ; as soon as by overheating or long use the polished surfaces of our best lamps are injured , so surely is there an increased waste of energy , and hence the extreme difficulty of preserving lamps made for use as standards for any long period .
From these results it appears probable that the attainment of economical high E.M.F. lamps of ordinary sizes may be very difficult , as what would be a high E.M.F. lamp with a black surface would be a low E.M.F. lamp were this black surface made bright ; the energy required being less , both the E.M.F. and current would have to fall .
The desire , therefore , for high E.M.F. lamps should be met not by a supply of black wasteful filaments , but more properly by economical lamps of greatly increased size and candle power , or by lamps of a smaller candle power run two or more in series .
