" An Account of the Base Observations made at the Kew Observatory with the Pendulums to be used in the Indian Trigonometrical Survey .
" By BALFOUR STEWART , M.A. , LL. D. , F.R.S. , Superintendent of the Kew Observatory , and BENJAMIN LOEWY , Esq. Received June 13 , read June 15 , 1865 .
Her Majesty 's Indian Government , on the recommendation of the Royal Society , lately decided that pendulum observations shall be made at different stations in India in connexion with the Great Trigonometrical Survey of that country .
The object of these proposed observations may be stated in a very few words .
The labours of those engaged in the Trigonometrical Survey have already disclosed the fact that the direction of the plumb-line in the northern stations of India was influenced to some extent by the mass of the Himalayas , and it was therefore thought highly desirable that the influence of these mountains upon the intensity of terrestrial gravity should be investigated in addition to their influence upon its direction .
The propriety of this view will at once be evident , if we reflect that by knowing the change produced not only upon the direction of gravity , but also on its intensity , we know at once all the particulars of the disturbing mountainforce both as regards magnitude and direction .
It was therefore with the view of ascertaining the alteration which these mountains might cause upon the intensity of gravity that the Indian pendulum observations were ' decided upon .
In consequence of this decision , Captain Basevi , R.E. , and first assistant in the Survey department , was appointed to superintend the observations , and instructed to repair to the Kew Observatory previously to his departure for India , in order to become acquainted with the necessary instruments , their adjustment , and the method of observing with them .
After attending daily at the Observatory from the beginning of September to the middle of November , this officer was perfectly instructed in every particular necessary for the practical part of these observations , as well as for their calculation and reduction .
He was then obliged to leave for India , being prevented by his early departure from making the necessary base determinations with the instruments at Kew Observatory .
The best arrangement of apparatus formed the subject of careful discussion with Colonel Walker , Superintendent of the Indian Survey ; and the experimental arrangements ultimately adopted received the sanction of this officer , who , besides suggesting several improvements , made himself thoroughly acquainted with all the details of the apparatus .
A room suitable for these observations was constructed in the south-east corner of the Observatory , the expenses of which were defrayed from the Government Grant Fund of the Royal Society .
The following simple diagram will be sufficient to show the experimental arrangement in the Pendulum-room .
_4 is e pe fr te , wC is the place for the clock , which is connected with theo transit-instrument ; P is the pillar bearing a slab attached also to the wall at W , to which the receiver ( R ) is rigidly fixed .
T is the telescope for the observations of the coincidences , mounted on a pillar which stands in a depression , so that the observer is not under the necessity of kneeling down during the observation .
In every other part the arrangement is entirely similar to that described by General Sabine in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829 , -with this difference , that the receiver was in our experiments a copper one with glass windows .
The whole of the apparatus was made by Mr. P. Adie , who deserves the highest praise for the excellent manner in which the work was executed by him .
The pendulums used were those marked No. 1821 and No. 4 , used formerly by General Sabine in different parts of the globe .
The former was also used by Mr. Airy in his I-arton experiments .
lethod of registering and reducing the Observations .
The manner in which the number of vibrations , made by a detached pendulum , are determined from a series of observed coincidences with the pendulum of a clock has been so often described , that we may refer to the writings of Kater , Sabine , Bailey , and others on the subject .
The established methods have been followed throughout in these experiments , and 426 [ 1865 .
the only change introduced was a very slight one , with the view of obtaining a more correct arc of vibration .
It is usual to observe the arc a little after the coincidence , which does not give the true arc corresponding to it .
To obviate this , the arc was read in our series about 30 seconds before , and again 30 seconds after each observed coincidence , marking first the right edge of the tailpiece and then the left one .
If we call these four readings of the scale a , 6 , c , d , we may consider ( a b ) + ( c d ) 2 as a very exact representation of the reading for the arc at the instant of the coincidence .
The adjustment of the diaphragm , disk , and tailpiece was made very carefully at the commencement of the experiments .
Nevertheless it was found slightly deranged when the pendulum was reversed .
In this case , as is well known , the disappearance and reappearance of the disk are not each instantaneous ; but we see first one side of the disk , then the other disappear , and in the same order reappear , so that we have four 'events , of which , calling the time of their happening respectively a , F , y , 8 , either ( 1 ) x+O++ , or ( 2 ) a , or ( 3 ) , lastly , 4'22 will give us the time of coincidence .
In a few sets of our series the first formula was used ; but it was soon found that the correct registration in such a case is a matter of the greatest difficulty , and it was therefore thought in one instance preferable to stop the clock and repeat the adjustment , and afterwards a similar derangement was rectified by a lateral motion of the observing telescope .
With a few trials , using a few successive coincidences for the purpose , it is quite possible to adjust the whole to the greatest nicety without stopping the clock .
The reduction of the observations was made entirely after the manner of former experimenters .
It comprises the following corrections : A. Correction of the observed arc-readings and reduction of the vibrations to infinitely small arcs .
In the first place , the scale for reading the arc being behind the tailpiece of the pendulum , the registered readings are too large .
Let D be the distance of the scale from the object glass of the telescope , d its distance from the tail of the pendulum , 0 the observed reading of the whole arc on the scale graduated from end to end , S the distance of the indicating-point of the tailpiece from the knife-edge , then the true arc , or more correctly semiarc observed ( =a ) , through which the pendulum moved from the vertical , is given by the formula O(D-d ) tang 2DS expressing all distances in inches , into which the scale was divided .

] 427 The values of --D were determined for each pendulum from accurate measurements , and are For pendulum No. 4 in position , face on 98-74 2x 100(22 x49'89 face off9 96 2x 100-22 x 49 ' 89 , , , No. 1821 , , face on= 24 2x 100'22 x 49'3 face off =-9 2x 100.22 X 49-3 The logarithms of these expressions were added to those of the observed readings for the logarithm of the tangent of a. In the next place , the reduction to infinitely small arcs was deduced from the well-known formula , { 1 : s3in ( a + a ' ) sin ( c-a ' ) , Number of infinitely small vibrations=n -n xs * , 32 ( log sin alog sin c ' ) where M3 denotes the logarithmic modulus =0'4342945 ; o the initial , and c ' the final semiarc of vibration , expressed in degrees , minutes , and seconds , n being the number of observed vibrations ; and to obtain a more correct result from this formula , the calculation was madefor each interval between two successive observations .
B. The rate of the clock was determined from a series of observations of star-transits , the results of which are given in Table I. The rate was somewhat unequal during the experiments , the range being equal to - , ths of a second ; and besides , the unfavourable state of the weather occasioned longer intervals between the observations than was desirable .
To free the results as far as possible from any errors arising from this source , the rates were represented in a series , as shown in Table II .
, which also gives the actual number of vibrations made by the sidereal clock in a mean solar day , as deduced from the following formula : Number of vibrations in a mean solar dav =-N'=86636*5554(1 8-40 ) , where r is the observed rate , which in our case was a losing one throughout the whole of the observations .
If we now call V ' the number of observed vibrations of the clock-pendulum from beginning to the end of one experiment , V the number of observed vibrations of the detached pendulum during the same time , corrected for the amplitude of the are , and finally N ' the number of actual vibrations of the clock in a mean solar day at the date of the experiment , found as above , we have for the number of infinitely small vibrations of See Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society , vol. vii .

C. Correction for temperature.-Two thermometers were fixed , one to the lower , the other to the upper part of a brass bar , which was made by Mr. Adie , of precisely the same form as the pendulums .
The brass bar being fixed near the middle of the receiver , close to the swinging pendulum , every change in the temperature of the latter was of course shared by the brass bar , and indicated by the two thermometers , which were extremely sensitive and read to '05 of a degree .
The readings of these two thermometers were in the first instance corrected for indexerror .
The instruments having been very carefully compared with the Kew Standard , a table of index-errors was made from these comparisons , and , by interpolation , giving the errors from degree to degree .
Another correction was applied for the observations in the exhausted receiver on account of the effect of exhaustion on the glass tubes of the thermometers .
This effect was determined very accurately by a series of experiments at Kew , and found to be equal for both thermometers , and amounting to 0 ?
'43 for a decrease in pressure of 29*210 inches .
This correction is smaller than that assumed by General Sabine and the late Mr. Bailey , who make it : of a degree for the thermometers which they employed .
Our experiments showed the remarkable fact that the correction is by no means proportional to the decrease in pressure .
The diminution of the pressure from 30*080 inches to 13'610 , that is , by an amount of 16'470 inches , gave a correction of only 0 ?
'052 , while a further decrease of 12'820 , bringing the pressure to 0'790 inch , gave for one thermometer 0 ?
0377 , and for the other 0 ?
` 385 .
The mean of the upper and lower thermometer reading will give the temperature of the pendulum at the moment of the observations ; and if we call t , t ' , t " , t " ' the temperatures found in this manner for the successive observations , we have t+t ' t'+t " t " +t ' " ' 2 ' 2~ ' 2 as the most probable temperature during the interval between two consecutive observations .
These intervals being of unequal length , we will call n , n ' , n " , n " ' , the number of coincidence-intervals which they contain ; and calling t ?
the mean temperature of the whole experiment , we have + ) ' , -t't"I +n ( " , ,t-ti ' o(22n n'n -n " ' ... ... Table III .
gives the mean temperature found in this manner for each experiment , and shows the mean of all observed temperatures for each pendulum , to which temperature all the experiments made with that pendulum have been reduced .
For this reduction it would have been best if we had had an opportunity of swinging the pendulums at extremes of temperature , say about 50 ?
distant from each other .
But the desirability of sending the apparatus to India under the care of Mr. Hennessey , who left by the March mail , 1865 .
] 431 prevented such a course , and we availed ourselves of the elaborate series of experiments on the temperature corrections of pendulums , made by General Sabine ( vide Phil. Trans. 1830 , p. 251 ) , which gives 0'44 vibration per diem for each degree of Fahrenheit 's scale .
General Sabine found in a former series this correction nearer to 0'43 ; and he says , in the above mentioned publication , " The probable error which may be incurred by employing the correction 0'44 for each degree as now determined , can only be very inconsiderable ; but when the differences of temperature amount to 50 ?
, which is a case of actual experience in pendulum observations , the question of whether 0'43 or 0'44 , for example , be the more correct value , involves an uncertainty in the ultimate result of no less than half a vibration a day .
" The pendulums which we used were not those employed by General Sabine in his determinations , but they were made by the same maker at the same time , and very probably from the same kind of brass , and there cannot be the least doubt that the true correction will lie between 0'43 and 0'44 .
We have therefore adopted 0'435 for our reductions ; and as the greatest difference in temperature between a single experiment and the mean is less than 11 ?
, the greatest error would in this case amount only to T-ths of a vibration per diem , an error too small to affect seriously the mean result of the whole .
At the same time we must state that , as Colonel Walker and Captain Basevi inform us , experiments will be made in India with both pendulums , to ascertain their exact constants with regard to expansion , and that our results will of course have then to be modified accordingly .

D. Correction for pressure of air.-This correction , as shown in the Phil. Trans. for 1832 , is thus determined : Let 1 ' denote the reading of the gauge for the mean of the experiments made in air , and / t the same reading for the mean of the vacuum experiments ; also let t ?
denote the mean temperature of all the experiments , both in air and vacuo , then the expression 1 +0023(to-32 ) will denote very nearly the mean difference of density between the two sets of experiments .
Now if N ' denote the mean number of vibrations in air during a mean solar day , and N " the mean number of vibrations in vacuo during the same time , then the constant for one inch of reduced pressure will be C= 3 , , , ( 1 + 0023(eo-32 ) ) .

The reduction of the resulting number of vibrations to the sea-level is calculated from Nx hxx , where R is the earth 's radius at the latitude of the Kew Observatory , h the height of the receiver above the mean level of the sea , and xa quantity which , with Dr. Young , may be assumed for a tract of level country to be =*666 ( vide Phil. Trans. for 1819 , page 98 ) .
This correction has been only applied to the ultimate mean number of vibrations of each pendulum .
Taking Bessei 's value for the semiaxis major and the eccentricity of the earth , and h= 17'5 feet as given by measurement and the known height of our standard barometer , the logarithm of the factor for this correction is 7-7467623 .
Result .
Adopting the values for the reduction to a vacuum as found in Table IV .
, and applying the correction to those experiments , which were made in a highly rarefied medium , we find the following numbers of vibrations made by each pendulum in both positions in a mean solar day in vacuo , viz. for Pendulum No. 1821 , Face on , Exp. I. 86072-728 ' II .
