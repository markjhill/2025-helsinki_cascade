( Abstract .
) Having been furnished , by Professor Ramsay 's kindness , with a sample of the new gas , argon , I have carried out experiments on its behaviour at low temperatures and at high pressures , in order to contribute , at least in part , to the knowledge of the properties of this interesting body .
The argon with which I was supplied had been dried with phosphoric anhydride ; its density was 19 9 ( H = 1 ) ; and Professor Ramsay thought that at the outside it might contain 1 to 2 per cent , of nitrogen , although it showed no nitrogen spectrum when examined in a Pfliicker 's tube .
For the first two experiments I made use of a Cailletet 's apparatus .
As cooling agent I used liquid ethylene , boiling under diminished pressure .
In both the other experiments the argon was contained in a burette , closed at both ends with glass stop-cocks .
By connecting the lower end of the burette with a mercury reservoir , the argon was transferred into a narrow glass tube fused at its lower end to the upper end of the burette , and in which the argon was liquefied , and its volume in the liquid state measured .
In these two series of experiments liquid oxygen , boiling under atmospheric or under diminished pressure , was employed as a cooling agent .
I made use of a hydrogen thermometer in all these experiments to measure low temperatures .
Determination of the Critical Constants of Argon .
As soon as the temperature of the liquid ethylene had been lowered to \#151 ; 128''6 , the argon easily condensed to a colourless liquid under a pressure of 38 atmospheres .
On slowly raising the temperature of the ethylene , the meniscus of the liquid argon became less and less distinct , and finally vanished .
From seven determinations the critical pressure was found to o\#174 ; 50 6 atmospheres ; the mean of the seven estimations of the critical temperature is \#151 ; 121 ' .
At lower temperatures the following vapour-pressures were corded :\#151 ; 1395 ] The Liquefaction and Solidification of Argon .

A calibrated tube , intended to receive the argon to be liquefied , and the hydrogen thermometer were immersed in boiling oxygen .
On admitting argon , and diminishing the temperature of the liquid oxygen below \#151 ; 187 ' , the liquefaction of the argon became manifest .
When liquefaction had taken place , I carefully equalised the pressure of the argon with that of the atmosphere , and regulated the temperature , so that the state of balance was maintained for a long time .
This process gives the boiling point of argon under atmospheric pressure .
Four experiments gave the numbers \#151 ; 186'*7 , \#151 ; 186''8 , -187'*0 , and \#151 ; 187'*3 .
The mean is \#151 ; 186'*9 , which I consider to he the boiling point under atmospheric pressure ( 740'5 mm. ) .
The quantity of argon used for these experiments , reduced to normal temperature and pressure , was 99*5 c.c. ; the quantity of liquid corresponding to that volume of gas was approximately O'114 c.c Hence the density of argon at its boiling point may be taken as approximately 1*5 .
This proves that the density of liquid argon at its boiling point ( \#151 ; 187 ' ) is much higher than that of oxygen , which I have found , under similar conditions , to be 1*124 .
By lowering the temperature of the oxygen to \#151 ; 191 ' by slow exhaustion , the argon froze to a crystalline mass , resembling ice ; on further lowering temperature it became white and opaque .
When the temperature was raised it melted ; four observations which I made to determine its melting point gave the numbers : \#151 ; 189''0 , \#151 ; 190'*6 , \#151 ; 1890,6 , and \#151 ; 189'*4 .
The mean of these numbers is \#151 ; 189'*6 ; and this may be accepted as the melting point of argon .
In the following table I have given a comparison of physical constants , in which those of argon are compared with those of other so-called permanent gases .
The data are from my previous work on the subject .
A.s can be seen from the foregoing table , argon belongs to the so-called " permanent " gases , and , as regards difficulty in liquefying it , it occupies the fourth place , viz. , between carbon monoxide and 0xygen .
Its behaviour on liquefaction places it nearest to oxygen , hut it differs entirely from oxygen in being solidifiable ; as is well nown , oxygen has not yet been made to assume a solid state .
The high density of argon rendered it probable that its liquefaction would take place at a higher temperature than that at which oxygen upiefies .
Its unexpectedly low critical temperature and boiling point seem to have some relation to its simple molecular constitution .
