] The author , in a former paper , read to the Society in February last , had discussed various objections which had been raised against his mode of geometric representation of the square roots of negative quantities .
At that time he had only discovered geometrical representations for quantities of the form a+b A/ 1 , of geometrically adding and multiplying such quantities , and also of raising them to powers either whole or fractional , positive or negative ; but he was at that time unable to represent geometrically quantities raised to powers , whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities ---m 4+ n / 1 ( such as a+b / -1 ) .
His attention has since been drawn to this latter class of quantities by a passage in M. Mourey 's work on this subject , which implied that that gentleman was in possession of methods of representing them geometrically , but that he was at present precluded by circumstances from publishing his discoveries .
The author was therefore induced to pursue his own investigations , and arrived at the general result stated by M. Mourey , that all algebraic quantities whatsoever are capable of geometrical representation by lines all situated in the same plane .
The object of the present paper is to extend the geometrical representations stated in his former treatise , to the powers of quantities , whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities .
With this view he investigates various equivalent formulae suited to the particular cases , and employs a peculiar notation adapted to this express purpose ; but the nature of these investigations is such as renders them incapable of abridgement .
