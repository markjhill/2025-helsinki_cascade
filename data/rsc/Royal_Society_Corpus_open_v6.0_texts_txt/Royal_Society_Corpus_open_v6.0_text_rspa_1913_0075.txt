158 Atomic Specific Heats between the Boiling Points of Liquid Nitrogen and Hydrogen .
I.\#151 ; The Mean Atomic Specific Heats at 50 ' Absolute of the Elements a Periodic Function of the Atomic Weights .
By Prof. Sir James Dewar , F.R.S. ( Received May 29 , \#151 ; Read June 19 , \#151 ; Revised July 30 , 1913 .
) A method of determining the specific heat of substances at low temperatures was described in a paper on " Studies with the Liquid Hydrogen and Air Calorimeter/ '* also in the abstract of a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution entitled " Liquid Hydrogen Calorimetry , " .( .
where the apparatus then used is illustrated .
Continuing the use of the same method , but with some modification of the apparatus , the investigation has been extended to a large number of inorganic and organic bodies .
In this later series of experiments , the measurements of the specific heats of materials by the liquid hydrogen calorimeter were made over a range of temperature from boiling nitrogen to boiling hydrogen , a fall of temperature of some 57 ' Abs .
Weighed pieces of the material are cooled to the temperature of boiling nitrogen in a quartz cooling vessel of special design .
By a simple mechanical device they are then released from this vessel , and drop into liquid hydrogen in the calorimeter below .
The resulting volumes of hydrogen evaporated are measured .
From this value and a knowledge of the latent heat of the liquid hydrogen and the mass of the substance , the specific heat is calculated as follows :\#151 ; If V is volume of hydrogen at N.T.P. evaporated by the fall of 1 grm. of the substance through T degrees above the temperature of boiling hydrogen , and s its specific heat , L being the volume of hydrogen evaporated by 1 calorie , then Y .
Y sT = L ' S = Tl4 The latent heat of liquid hydrogen is taken as 115 calories , and therefore L = 97'05 c.c. ; also in these experiments T is constant ( 57''5 ) therefore s = Vx 0-0001792 .
Thus the hydrogen volumes measured are reduced to Y at N.T.P. and simply multiplied by the constant factor 0'0001792 , thereby giving the specific heat .

Five observations were given varying +5 about this mean value .
This was determined on the basis of 0*0291 being accepted as the mean specific heat of lead from 15 ' C. to 20 ' Abs .
Several Willard Gibbs vapour pressure formulae , however , calculated from the vapour tensions of liquid hydrogen , give a mean value of 115 for the latent heat of hydrogen , so that the specific heat of lead over this range would seem to be 0*0272 .

is now 0*02399 .
This is the mean value of a series of nearly 30 observations .
The greatest variations from this mean value were 0*0247 and 0*0233 , but the majority of the values varied to a much less extent .
This is equivalent to an atomic specific heat of 4*965 .
It may be mentioned that a computation from Nernst and Lindemann's* real specific heats of lead within the same range of temperature gives the mean value 5*18 .
In the observations with the liquid air calorimeter the specific heats were calculated in each case by direct comparison with lead observed at the same time , , as explained in the earlier papers .
This is most convenient because liquid air varies in composition on standing , and therefore in the volume evaporated by unit amount of heat .
Liquid Air Calorimetry .
A few results obtained with the form of calorimeter used in 1904 with liquid air may be recorded .
They were all reduced by comparison with lead done at the same time , using the value for the specific heat of lead given in the earlier paper , viz. , 0*0290 from 195 ' Abs .

They were reduced on the basis of the value 48'9 for the latent heat of nitrogen at its boiling point , as given by Fischer and Alt in 1902 .
The method of calculation was thus similar to that employed with liquid hydrogen .

A side delivery tube , 1 cm .
wide , provided with a stopcock D of 8 mm. bore , is sealed near the top of B. A short length of rubber tubing on the neck of F makes a gas-tight joint with B.

square , stands centrally in the calorimeter A. The strip is cut from a thin tube of about the same diameter as the calorimeter neck .
A short length of the tube is left above the shoulder , and supports the strip by fitting loosely into the neck of A. The shoulder is arranged just above the level of the liquid hydrogen in A , which is at least three-quarters full .
Some such device is essential in the use of this form of the liquid hydrogen calorimeter .
The calorimeter in its turn is immersed in liquid hydrogen in the supporting vacuum vessel C , the neck of the calorimeter being 8 to 10 cm .
below the liquid hydrogen surface .
This vacuum vessel C is only slightly wider than the lower part of A , and is provided with a coned cap F , whereby it is also supported and completely immersed in a wider vacuum 162 Sir J. Dewar .

163 vessel G- containing exhausted liquid air .
G- is also fitted with a brass coned cover , fitting vacuum-tight on to the cap F on C. .
Both caps are pierced by two thin tubes , one for fitting on to the filling syphons , the other , bent at right angles , serves for connecting to the exhaust in the case of the liquid air vessel , and in the case of the liquid hydrogen vessel to the stopcock leading the evaporating hydrogen through the upper part of the apparatus .
This arrangement thus charged only needs a little liquid air sucked in every one and a-half hours .
The liquid hydrogen vessel will not need replenishing for at least four hours .
The level of the liquid hydrogen in the calorimeter does not fall 1 cm .
in six hours with constant use .
The bulk of the materials added roughly compensates for the volume of the liquid hydrogen evaporated .
It is important that this level should not materially change , since , after striking the shoulder , bodies move more slowly , are deflected on to the cold wall , and low results are obtained due to longer cooliug of the materials in the vapour before being immersed in the liquid hydrogen .
The isolation of the calorimeter was such that less than 10 c.c. of hydrogen gas was evaporated from it per minute .
The whole apparatus is supported between the cork-lined spring jaws mounted on a heavy metal base , on which the outer vacuum vessel rests .
The cooling vessel H is connected by india-rubber tube to the top of the calorimeter .
It consists of an ordinary cylindrical slit silvered vacuum vessel , 20 cm .
long and 7 cm .
wide , with a central axial open tube K sealed in below .
This tube passes through the liquid in the vacuum vessel .
It has the same diameter below as the neck tube of the calorimeter .
Hear the top of the central tube a side tube J , of about the same diameter , and some 3 cm .
long , serves for the introduction of the weighed pieces of material , which are all cooled previously to the temperature of liquid air , and then fail on to a thin metal disc P fitting loosely the tube K , where they remain about 15 minutes .
P is supported by being hinged to two thin ebonite rods , L and M , fixed to a brass fitting cemented on to the top .
The rod L is not fixed directly to the disc but to a metal ring R. From the ring R two thin vertical steel wires are connected freely to two points on the circumference of the pan below .
This rod and the attached ring can be given a vertical motion by a crank N in the top fitting , thereby tipping the pan and releasing the piece of material , which then falls freely down into the calorimeter .
The level of the pan placed about H is approximately one-third the vertical height of the'cooliug vessel .
Quartz was found to be safer than glass for the construction of this vessel .
A high 164 Sir J. Dewar .
Atomic Specific Heats between the vacuum was maintained by a cross-tube S , opening to the annular space , filled with charcoal .
At the temperature of boiling nitrogen , the convection currents in the central tube of such a vessel , when connected to the calorimeter below , have no serious effect on the temperature in the tube at a reasonable distance from the bottom , provided the central tube be not wide .
The difference of temperature in the tube and in the surrounding liquid was found to be only 05 ' when the tube was 1*5 cm .
wide .
With a larger pattern vessel the width of the central tube was increased to 2'2 cm .
, and even here the difference was under 3 ' at the level of the pan .
These temperatures were measured by a small helium thermometer , consisting of a 4 c.c. bulb to which was sealed a small mercury manometer of fine capillary tubing .
The thermometer was filled with pure helium to 273 mm. pressure at 0 ' C. The reading of the mercury manometer thus gives , with slight corrections previously determined , the absolute temperature .
It is scarcely necessary to add that , by exhausting the liquid nitrogen , a lower initial temperature than 78 ' Abs .
can be secured .
The hydrogen evaporating from the liquid in the vacuum vessel C , in which the calorimeter is immersed , is employed in the interval of observations to maintain a hydrogen atmosphere through the neck of the calorimeter and the connected measuring tubes .
Risk of solid air in the calorimeter neck is thus obviated .
A simple arrangement of a three-way cock T , connected at the top of the brass fitting on the central tube of the cooling vessel , allows this to be manipulated .
The hydrogen thus passes continually in at the tubular top of the fitting on the central tube of the cooling vessel , and out through the stopcock on the calorimeter neck , and through the cocks to the measuring vessels .
When an observation is to be made , the three-way cock is turned to allow the hydrogen current to-escape to the laboratory , thereby closing off the calorimeter , which now only connects to the collecting and measuring vessels V and W. V consists of a glass tube 8 cm .
in diameter and 40 cm .
long , open at the bottom and provided with a wide T-piece at the top .
The tube is immersed to the neck in water in a glass cylinder , and is counterpoised by a weight and cord running over a pulley just above .
It is thereby readily raised during the time gas is being evaporated from the calorimeter ; this ensures that no back pressure is produced .
One arm of the T-piece is open and connects to the stopcock D on the calorimeter neck ; the other is provided with another small stopcock and connects to a 200 c.c. gas burette W similarly immersed in water .
This latter stopcock is closed during the collecting of the gas from a dropped piece of material .
This being completed , the calori- Boiling Points of Liquid Nitrogen and Hydrogen .
165 meter stopcock is closed while the evaporated hydrogen gas is measured by transference to the burette , the slight continual evaporation from the calorimeter meanwhile finding a vent through the three-way cock T at the top of the cooling vessel , which is now turned on .
These arrangements are necessary to secure the minimum impediment to the evaporating hydrogen , which is usually evolved in less than 10 seconds , any temporary back pressure being fatal to concordant results .
At least 15 seconds are allowed for collecting the gas given off , and even longer , in some cases , with badly conducting bodies .
A slightly different form of calorimeter vacuum vessel was used on some occasions , but without modifying the results .
Instead of the constriction at the top of A , a ground conical neck was used of the same diameter as the inner tube .
This neck was fitted with a similar ground conical hollow tube sealed on to the tube B. Anhydrous glycerin was used to make the ground joint tight at the low temperatures .
The wider neck in some ways simplifies the preliminary manipulations , and allows a more efficient arrangement to be securely fixed for preventing splashing , and breaking the fall of the bodies dropped into the calorimeter .
The arrangement is shown in the side sketch B. It consists of a light counterpoised trap door hinged at the lower end of a conical brass or german silver tube , supported in and fitting to the inner tube of the calorimeter .
A small lead ball on a wire soldered to the trap door keeps this closed until struck by a falling sphere , while shutting it again immediately after its passage .
The conical tube above the trap door is pierced with several small holes to leave a free passage for the evaporating hydrogen .
The addition of a gauze filter to intercept spray was found to be impracticable , the resistance introduced causing back pressure .
As far as possible the materials used were cast in the forms of spheres about 8 mm. diameter , and for this purpose the use of an ordinary bullet mould was found convenient .
In the case of liquid bodies , the mould was first cooled by liquid air .
Frequently liquids were frozen into solid cylinders in thin glass tubing , and pieces cut off after removing the glass mould .
The metallic materials were in some cases fused into buttons of convenient weight in an exhausted quartz tube .
The lead , however , of which many pieces were required , was cut from rod , and subsequently squeezed in a small spherical mould .
Yolatile bodies were weighed at a low temperature on a light german silver pan supported by a thin platinum wire suspension from the balance pan about 2 cm .
above the level of liquid air contained in a wide deep vacuum vessel .
Some materials would not make coherent bullets or cast sticks .
These were filled into very thin walled cylindrical metal capsules VOL. lxxxix.\#151 ; A. p 166 Sir J. Dewar .
Atomic Specific Heats between the of equal weight , so that a preliminary determination of the volume of hydrogen evaporated by the metal of the capsule gave the correction .
They were then cooled on an aluminium dish floating on liquid air , filled with the fluid , and weighed separately .
Materials which could not be fused were compressed hydraulically into small blocks and cut up into pieces of suitable dimensions .
At least three pieces of every substance were dropped .
The results rarely varied among themselves by more than 2 to 3 per cent. Very frequently the agreement was within 1 per cent. In order to ensure good results , uniformity of shape and size in the pieces of material used is desirable , so that the manner of release and fall shall be comparable : because in the use of this instrument the materials have to pass through a region of the neck , between the cooling vessel and the calorimeter , where a considerable gradient of temperature exists .
It is necessary that , as far as possible , the bodies used shall be subjected to this variable region in the same manner , so that the amount of heat absorbed in transit shall be nearly the same .
This value was determined in the following manner .
The warm portion of the calorimeter neck between the cooling vessel above and the vacuum vessels below was cooled by being surrounded with liquid air placed in a simple temporary fitting .
Observations with various kinds of bodies were then made .
The comparison of the reduced volumes now obtained with the values given by the ordinary use of this particular form of the instrument gives the correction factor .
Many confirmations of the specific heats were made with this addition to the instrument .
In the latest form of the calorimeter the neck is always surrounded with liquid nitrogen , thus abolishing all heat correction .
This improved calorimeter gives results differing but slightly from the corrected values of the old instrument .
The value of the atomic heat of lead is determined before and after any series of experiments as a check on the constancy of the instrument .
The values of the specific heats given will include any heat of transformation of glassy or crystalline modifications or other comparable change produced by the cooling to 20 ' Abs .
Another effect is produced by some materials when used in the form of hydraulically compressed blocks .
Such as are porous exhibit in varying degrees the phenomenon of heat evolution due to liquid hydrogen passing into the capillary spaces , thereby rendering the observed specific heat too great unless the proper correction is made .
Any air occluded during the preliminary cooling of the porous material to liquid air temperature before being introduced to the hydrogen calorimeter is also included .
Some of this air would be replaced by hydrogen through diffusion while in the hydrogen atmosphere in the central tube of the cooling vessel Boiling Points of Liquid Nitrogen and Hydrogen .
167 of boiling nitrogen ; but the true remedy is the preliminary cooling of such porous bodies in a hydrogen atmosphere to the temperature of liquid air .
That heat evolution continued in many cases for some time after the dropping of the material was shown by an increased rate of evolution of hydrogen from the calorimeter .
As stated above , this is* normally less than 10 c.c. per minute .
In some instances the introduction of porous material increased this for some time to more than 30 c.c. per minute .
The values set out in Table I for the mean atomic specific heats of 53 elements at about 50 ' Abs .
represent the results of some 200 calorimetric observations .
When plotted in terms of their atomic weights , they reveal definitely a periodic variation resembling generally the well-known Lothar Meyer atomic volume curve for the solid state .
The relation between the two curves is shown in fig. 2 .
If experiments were similarly made between the boiling points of hydrogen and helium then in all probability the atomic specific heats would be all very small and nearly constant .
Until more accurate values of the atomic heats have been reached , by the use of purer samples of the elements and the latest form of this calorimeter , it will be advisable to delay theoretical discussion .
The second part of this paper will contain the molecular specific heats of a series of inorganic compounds ; while a third part will include similar values derived from the examination of types of organic bodies .
