A Relation of the strange Effects of Thunder and Lightning , which happened at Mrs. Close 's House at New-Forge , in the County of Down in Ireland , on the 9th of August , 1707 .
Communicated by Samuel Molyneux Esq ; Secretary of the Philosophical Society at Dublin .
WHEN I went to wait upon this Gentlewoman , about a Fortnight after , to inform my self in all the Particulars of this Extraordinary Accident , she then told me , That the whole Day was Close , Hot and Sultry , little or no Wind stirring until towards the Evening ; That there was a small Breeze with some mizling Rain , which lasted about an Hour ; That as the Air darkned after Sun set , she saw several faint Flashes of Lightning , and heard some Thunder Claps as at a distance ; That between ten and eleven a Clock both were very violent and terrible , and so increased and came on more frequent until a little before twelve a Clock ; That one Flash of Lightning and Clap of Thunder came both at the same time louder and more dreadful than all the rest , which , as she thought , shook and inflamed the whole House ; and being sensible at that Instant of a violent strong Sulphureous Smell in her Chamber , which she did not perceive before now , and feeling a thick gross Dust falling on her Hands and Face as she lay in Bed , she concluded no less than that part of her House was thrown down by the Thunder , or set on Fire by the Lightning ; That arising in this Fright , she called up her Family , and Candles being lighted , she found her Bed-chamber full of Smoke and Dust , as also the Kitchen that was beneath it : The rest of the House being safe , she was not sollicitous at that time about any other damage she might have sustained , more than that she observed the Looking glass , that hung in her Chamber , to be broken .
The next day again she found upon further search and inquiry , that part of the Top or Cornish of the Chimney , which stood without that Gabel-end of the House where her Chamber was , was struck off ; That part of the Copeing of the Splay of the Gabel end it self was broken down , and the Shingles on the Roof adjoining thereto ( to the number of 12 or 16 ) were raised or ruffled , but none shattered or carried away ; That part of the Ceiling in her Chamber beneath those Shingles was forced down , and part of the Plaister and Pinning Stones of the adjoining Wall , was also broken off and loosened , ( the whole Breach 16 or 20 Inches broad .
) That at this place there was left on the Wall a smutted Scar or Trace , as if made black by the Smoke of a Candle , which was directed downwards towards another place on the same Wall whereon a Breach was also made as the former , and of the same Dimensions , part of which was behind the place where the Looking-glass did hang ; That the Boards on the back of a large hair Trunk full of Table and other Linen , standing beneath the Looking-Glass , were forced in , and splintered as if by the Blow of a Smith 's Sledge ; That two parts of three of the Linen within this Trunk were pierced or cut thro ' , the Cut appearing of a Quadrangular Figure , and between two or three Inches over ; That the End of the Trunk was likewise forced out , as the Back was drove in ; That at about two Foot distance from the End of this Trunk ( where the Floor and the Side-Wall of the House joined ) there was a small Breach made in the Plaister , where a small Chink or Crevice was to be seen between the side Board of the Floor and the Wall , so wide as that a Man could thrust his Fingers down ; and that just beneath this again in the Kitchen the Ceiling was forced down , and some of the Lime or Plaister of the Wall broke off ; That exactly under this again stood a large Tub or Vessel of Wood enclosed with a Crib made of Brick and Lime , which was broke and splintered all to pieces , and most of the Brick and LimeWork about it forced and scattered about the Kitchen .
As the Gentlewoman gave me this Account , I went from place to place viewing each particular ; and as I found all was done on or near the Gabel end of the House , I have endeavoured to explain this Description by a Draught thereof , wherein the several Breaches are distinguished : And as I conceived all to be effected by some Irresistible Body , I have also by two Parallel Lines traced out its Irregular Motion .
[ See the Figure .
] The further Circumstances judged material to be offered , which cannot be represented in the Draught , are these : That the Looking glass was broke with that Violence , that there was not a Piece of it to be found of the largeness of Half a Crown ; That several Pieces of it were sticking like Hail-shot in the Chamber Door ( being of Oak ) and on the other side of the Room ; That several of the Edges and Corners of some of the Pieces of the broken Glass were tinged of a Light Flame Colour , as if heated in the Fire ; that the Curtains of the Bed were cut in several Pieces , thought to be done by the Pieces of the Glass ; That several Pieces of Muslin and Wearing Linen , left ( on going to Bed ) by this Gentlewoman and Daughter on the great hair Trunk , were thrown and scattered about the Room , no way singed or scorched ; and yet the Hair on the Back of the Trunk , where the Breach was made , was singed ; That the uppermost part of the Linen within the Trunk was safe and well , and the lowermost Parcel , consisting of 350 odd Ply of Linen , pierced thro ' , of which none was any way smutted , but the uppermost Ply of a Tablecloath that lay above all the rest .
The Gentlewoman told me , there was a yellow Singe or Stain perceivable on some part of the other Linen so damaged the next day ; and that the whole Linen smelt strong of Sulphur ; but neither this yellow Stain or Smell was perceivable when I was there : That the Glass of two Windows in the Bed-Chamber above , and two Windows in the Kitchen beneath , was so shattered , that there was scarce one whole Pane left in any of them ; That the Pewter , Brass , and Iron Furniture in the Kitchen were thrown down , and scattered about the Kitchen , particularly a large Girdle about 20 Pounds weight , that hung upon an Iron Hook near the Ceiling , was found lying on the Floor ; That a Cat was found Dead the next Morning in the Kitchen , with its Legs extended as in a going posture , in the middle of the Floor , with no other Sign of being hurt , than that the Furr was singed a little about the setting on of the Tail .
The Gentlewoman told me too , That about some few Days before this Accident happened to her , she removed a Table Press-Bed from the Place where the Hair Trunk stood , wherein two little Girls ( her Daughters ) used to lie ; which she looked upon as a particular Piece of Providence .
I must further remark , That the Wall both above and below a little Window in the same Gabel-end was so shattered at the same time , that the Light could be seen thro ' the Crevices in the Wall ; and that upon a large Stone on the outside of the Wall beneath this Window , was to be seen a mark , as if made by the stroke of a Smith 's Sledge or large Iron Crow , with which a Splinter or piece of the Stone was broken off of some Pounds I was further informed , That from the time of that great Tunder clap both the Thunder and Lightning diminished gradually , so that in an Hours time all was still and quiet again .
