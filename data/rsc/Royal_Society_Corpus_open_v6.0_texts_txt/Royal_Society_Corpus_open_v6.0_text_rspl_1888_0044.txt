A series of revised rules for handling ships in hurricanes in any part of the world is given .
Comparing these rules with the older ones it will be remarked\#151 ; 1 .
That the role for finding approximately the bearing of the vortex is slightly modified .
2 .
That the great rules of the ** laying to " tacks remain unaltered .
3 .
That the greatest improvement is the recognition of the position and nature of the belt of intensified trade wind on the dangerous side of a hurricane , where a ship experiences increasing wind , without change of direction , and a falling barometer .
The old idea that such conditions show that a vessel is then necessarily exactly on the line of advance of a hurricane is erroneous .
She may , but she need not be ; and under no circumstances should she run till the barometer has fallen at least 6\#151 ; lOths of an inch .

There are certain rules which hold for all hurricanes ; but every district has a special series , due to its own local peculiarities .
Those for the Southern Indian Ocean are given in this paper .

] The sample of nickel on which these experiments were made was supposed to be fairly pure when the experiments began .
A subsequent analysis , however , showed its composition to be as follows :\#151 ; Nickel Cobalt Copper Iron 1*05 Carbon Sulphur Phosphorus Loss : .
100-00 The experiments comprise determinations of the curve of magnetisation at various temperatures , the magnetising force being increased , that is to say , they are confined to a determination of the ascending carve of magnetisation .
The temperature was always produced by enclosing the object to be tested in a double copper casing with an air space between the two shells of the casing , and by heating the casing from without by a bunsen burner .
The temperature was measured by determining the electrical resistance of a coil of copper wire .
The copper was first roughly tested to ascertain that its 2 b 2 318 Mr. J. Hopkinson .
[ June 14 , temperature coefficient did not deviate far from 00388 per degree centigrade of its resistance at 20 ' 0 .
; I was unable to detect that the coefficient deviated from this value in either direction .
The temperature may therefore be taken as approximately accurate .
The nickel had the form of a ring\#151 ; fig. 1 .
On this ring was wound in one layer 83 convolutions of No. 27 B.W.Gr .
oopper wire carefully insulated with asbestos paper to serve as measurer of temperature and as secondary or exploring coil .
Over this again , a layer of asbestos paper intervening , was wound a coil of 276 convolutions in five layers of No. 19 B.W.G. copper wire to serve as the primary coil .
The method of experiment was simply to pass a known current through the primary , to reverse the same and observe the kick on a ballistic galvanometer due to the current induced in the secondary .
At intervals the secondary was disconnected , and its resistance was ascertained for a determination of temperature .
Knowing the current it is easy to calculate the magnetising force , and knowing the constants of the galvanometer it is easy to calculate the induction per square centimetre .
The practice was to begin by heating the ring to a temperature at which it ceased to be magnetic , then to lower the gas flame to a certain extent and allow the apparatus to stand for some time , half an hour or more , to allow the temperature to become steady , then determine the temperature , then rapidly make a series of observations with ascending force , lastly , determine the temperature again .
The ring was next demagnetised by a series of reversals with diminishing currents .
The flame was further lowered , and a second series of experiments was made .
It was then assumed that the previous magnetisation would have a very small effect \lt ; jfji any subsequent experiment .
As the substance , turned out to be|^HI| from pure nickel , it is not thought worth while to give actual readings .
The results are.given in the accompanying curves , Nos. 1 to 14 , in which the abscissae represent the magnetising forces per linear centimetre , the ordinates the induction per square centimetre , both in C.G.S. units .
Curves 15 and 16 give the results of Professor Rowland* for pure nickel at the two temperatures at whichj* experimented .

The magnetisation of my impure nickel disappears about 310 ' C. 4 .
A little below the temperature of 310 ' C. the induction diminishes very rapidly with increase of temperature .
* 5 .
At lower temperatures still the induction increases with rise of temperature for low forces , diminishes for high forces .
This fact has been observed by several experimenters .
Specific Heat.\#151 ; The object here was simply to ascertain whether or not there was marked change at the temperature when the nickel ceases to be magnetic .
It appeared that this question could be best answered by the method of cooling , and that it mattered little even if it were roughly applied .
A cylinder of nickel ( fig. 2 , Plate 13 ) was taken , 5-08 cm .
diameter , 5'08 cm .
high , having a circumferential groove , 15'9 mm. deep and 6 35 mm. wide .
In this groove was wound a copper wire , well insulated with asbestos , by the resistance of which the temperature was* determined .
The cylinder was next enveloped in many folds of asbestos paper to insure that the cooling should be slow , and that consequently the temperature of the nickel should be fairly uniform and equal to that of the copper wire .
The whole was now heated over a bunsen lamp till the temperature was considerably above 310 ' C. ; the lamp was next removed , and the times noted at which the resistance of the copper wire was balanced by successive values in the Wheatstone 's bridge .
If be the temperature , and t be time , and if the specific heat be assumed constant , and the rate of loss of heat proportional to the excess of temperature , Tc -f- \#151 ; Q dt or k log 6 -j- ( \#163 ; \#151 ; ^o ) \#151 ; 0 .
In curve 21 the abscissae represent the time in minutes , the ordinates the logarithms of the temperature ; the points would lie in a straight line if the specific heat were constant .
It will be observed that the curvature of the curve is small and regular , indicating that although the specific heat is not quite constant , or the rate of loss is not quite proportional to the excess of temperature , there is no sudden change at or about 310 ' C. Hence we may infer that m this sample there is no great or sudden absorption or liberation of heat occurring with the accession of the property of magnetisability .
