] The details of the author 's experiments upon the above subjects are given in an extended series of tables , commencing with a temperature of 30 Fahr. up to 127 ?
Fahr. Mr. Christie found that as the temperature of the magnets increased , their intensity diminished , in direct contradiction to the notion of destroying magnetism by intense cold .
Fromn a temperature of 80 ?
the intensity decreased ra pidly as the temperature increased , and at above 100 ?
a portion of the power of the magnet was permanently destroyed .
In regard to the diurnal changes in the terrestrial intensity , the author 's experiments lead him to suggest the following queries for the consideration of those who may have an opportunity of making such observations:-Does the time of the minimum intensity correspond with the time at which the sun is on the magnetic meridian ?
Does the time of maximum intensity corresp6nd to the sun 's passing the plane of the equator of the dipping-needle ?
Does any change take place in the intensity while the sun is below the horizon ?
Are any periodical effects corresponding to the time of rotation of the sun about its axis observable ?
Is the diurnal change of intensity at the time of new moon sensibly different from what it is at the time of quadrature ?
If the moon do produce an effect on the needle , it is evidently less than that of the sun ; -should we then attribute it to solar heat , or to the magnetism of the sun ?
