( Abstract .
) The Trigonometrical Survey of the United Kingdom commenced in the year 1784 , under the immediate auspices of the loyal Society ; the first base was traced by General Roy on the 16th of April of that year , on Hounslow Heath , in presence of Sir Joseph Banks , then President of the Society , and some of its most distinguished Fellows .
The principal object which the Governnent had then in view , was the connexion of the Observatories of Paris and Greenwich by means of a triangulation , for the purpose of determining the difference of longitude between the two observatories .
A detailed account of the operations then carried on is given in the first volume of the 'Trigonometrical Survey , ' which is a revised account of that which was first published in the 'Philosophical Transactions ' for 1785 and three following years .
At the time when these operations were in progress , the Survey of several counties in the south-east of England , including Kent , Sussex , Surrey , and Hampshire , was also in progress , under the direction of the Master-General of the Ordnance , for the purpose of making military maps of the most important parts of the kingdom in a military point of view ; and it was then decided to make the triangulation which extended from Hounslow to Dover the basis of a triangulation for these surveys .
It is extremely to be regretted that a more enlarged view of the subject had not then been taken , and a proper geometrical projection made for the map of the whole kingdom .
As it is , the south-eastern counties were first drawn and published in reference to the meridian 'tf Greenwich , then Devonshire in reference to the meridian of Butterton in that county , and thirdly the northern counties , in reference to the meridian of Delamere in Chesh'ire ; but there is a large intermediate space , the maps of which are made of various sizes to accommodate them to the convergence of the meridian .
In 1799 the Royal Society gave further proof of the interest it took in the progress of the Survey , by lending to the Ordnance its great 3-foot Theodolite , made by Ramsden , for the purpose of expediting the work of the Survey ; and although this instrument has been in almost constant use for the last sixty-seven years , during which time it has been placed on the highest church towers and the loftiest mountains in the kingdom , from the Shetlands to the Scilly Islands , it is at this day in perfect working order , and probably one of the very best instruments that was ever made .
The great Trigonometrical operations of the Survey have been carried on under so many officers , from the time of their commencement under General Roy down to the present time , that it would be quite impossible , in this short notice , to mention more than the names of several Superintendents who have succeeded General Roy , viz. Colonel Williams , Major-General Mudge , Major-General Colby , and Colonel Hall ; but in justice to the highly meritorious body of noncommissioned officers of the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners , it should be stated , that whilst in the early part of the Survey the most important and delicate observations were entrusted solely to the commissioned officers , these duties have of late years been performed by the non-commissioned officers with the greatest skill and accuracy .
The computations connected with the corrections of the observed angles , to make the whole triangulation as nearly as possible perfectly consistent , have been most voluminous , and have been made under the direction of Lieut.-Colonel Yolland , Captain Cameron , and Captain Alexander R. Clarke ; but Col. James gladly avails himself of this opportunity to acknowledge the great and important assistance and advice which , both as regards the instruments and the calculations , have at all times been received from the Astronomer Royal .
The triangulation , by the methods which will be explained , is now made consistent in every part , so that any side of any triangle being taken as a base , the same distance will be reproduced when it is computed through any portion or the whole series of triangles ; and when the five measured bases relied on are incorporated in this triangulation , the greatest difference between their measured and computed lengths is not as much as 3 inches , and yet some of the bases are upwards of 400 miles apart .
Several bases of from five to seven miles long have been measured , but those upon which the chief reliance has been placed are the Lough Foil and Salisbury Plain bases which were measured with General Colby 's compensation bars .
The difference between the measured and computed length of the one base from the ether through the triangulation is 0'4178 ft. , or about 5 inches .
This difference has been divided in proportion to the square root of the lengths of the measured bases , by which the mean base which has been used in the triangulation has been obtained ; there is therefore a difference of + or-0'2 ft. , or 2inches between the measured and computed length of these bases from the mean base .
The Hounslow Heath base was measured with Ramsden 's 100 ft. steel chains , and only differs 0 173 ft. , or about 2 inches , from its computed length from the mean base .
The Belhelvie base in Aberdeenshire , also measured with the steel chains , differs only 0'24 ft. , or less than 3 inches , from the computed length .
The difference between the measured and computed length of the Misterton Carr base , near Doncaster , also measured with the steel chains , is only 0157 ft. , or less than 2 inches ; and it will be observed that the difference between the computed and measured lengths of these three bases ( measured with chains ) is not greater than the difference between the measured and computed length of the Lough Foil and Salisbury Plain bases ( measured with the compensation bars ) , from which it may be inferred , that bases measured with steel chains are deserving of the greatest confidence ; and when the great simplicity , portability , and cheapness of the chains are compared with the complex , heavy and expensive apparatus of the compensation bars , it may be anticipated that they will be more generally employed than they have been of late years , especially in the colonies , and in countries where the transport of heavy articles is effected with difficulty .
The length of the base on huluddlan Marsh in North Wales , which was measured with steel chains , differs 1'596 ft. from the computed length ; but from the circumstance that the extremities of the base are very badly situated with reference to the surrounding Trigonometrical stations , the angles being very acute and not well observed , little confidence has been placed in the result of the comparison of its computed and measured length .
One of the first practical results arising from the completion of the triangulation is , that it is now possible to engrave the latitude and longitude on the marginal lines of the old sheets of the one-inch Map of England , and this is now being done .
The following account of the Trigonometrical operations and calculations has been drawn up by Captain Alexander R. Clarke , R.E. ; this account may be considered an aLridgement of that more detailed account which is now in the press , and will be shortly published .
It will be seen that the equatorial diameter of the earth , as derived from the Ordnance Survey , is 7926-610 miles , or about one mile greater than it is given by the Astronomer Royal in his 'Figure of the Earth , ' and that the ellipticity is 299 or as the Astronomer Royal conjectured , something " greater than 30 , " which he gives in the same paper .
The mean specific gravity of the earth , as derived from the observations at Arthur 's Seat , was stated in a former paper to be.514 ; the calculations have since been revised , and it is now found to be 5-316 .
The mean specific gravity of the earth , as derived from the only other observations on the attraction of mountain masses on which any reliance has been placed , viz. the Schehallien observations , is , as finally corrected by I-utton , ,9 or almost 5 0 .

Two copies of the new National Standard Yard have recently been received through the Astronomer Royal , and it is obviously necessary that the geodetic measures should be given in reference to the standard ; but not knowing from what scale the standard has been taken , Col. James is unable to say at present in what way the reduction is to be made ; that is , whether by reference to the comparison of the old standards which have been already made , or by the mechanical process of a direct comparison of the Ordnance Standard with the new National Standard .
This introductory explanation by Col. James is followed by an account of the Trigonometrical operations and calculations ; the following is a brief statement of the results : " 1st .
