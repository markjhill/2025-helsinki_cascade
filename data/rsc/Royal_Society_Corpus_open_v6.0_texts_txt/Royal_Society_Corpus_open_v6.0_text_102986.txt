A Register of the Weather for the year 1692 , kept at Oats in Essex .
By Mr John Locke .
I Herewith send you the Copy of my Register of the Weather , from the 9th of Decemb. 1691 .
to the end of the year 1692 .
It is fit I explain a little to you some things in the Table , for the better understanding of it .
The first Column , having D at the top , contains the day of the month .
That with H , the hour of the day , which beginning from one of the clock in the morning , I count round in one continued series to 24 , which is 12 a clock at night .
The Column There is that of the Thermoscope , which was a sealed one , whereof you will find a larger account hereafter .
Qqqqqqqqqqq The The Column Bar marks the height of the Mercury in the Baroscope .
The first number is the inches of its height , the second number marks the 20th parts of an inch above that inch marked by the first number .
The Column Hyg .
is that which marks the moisture of the Air .
The Instrument I used was the beard of a Wild Oat , of which each turn was divided into sixteen degrees .
The Column of the Wind marked the point the Wind was in , but not always exactly , because the Weathercock visible out of my Window was stiff , and turned not easily , nor was the House it stood on situate exactly East and West ; so that it was not easy by the standing of the Weather-cock to know exactly the point of the Wind : Wherefore I contented my self to set down barely one of the 4 cardinal points , when the Wind was pretty near it ; and when it was more remote , the two cardinal points between which it was , putting the Letter of the cardinal point first to which it was nearest ; as when the Wind was between the South and the West , if it were nearer the West than the South , I writ W. S. and so of the rest .
I marked besides the force of the Wind , which I di vided into four degrees .
1 .
When it just moved the Leaves .
2 .
When it blew a pretty fresh gale .
3 .
When it was a hard and whistling Wind .
4 .
When it blew a storm .
Though these divisions were not made with that exactness as they might have been , had one had an Instrument on purpose , yet they may give some help to those who would make observations from such Registers as these .
( o ) was when there was not Wind enough to move a Leaf as I could see .
As to the Weather .
Cloudy signifies more of the Sky(visible out of the Windows ofmy Study , which were Fast and South ) covered with Clouds , than not .
Fair the contrary , Between when it was uncertain whether more of the Sky was covered or clear .
Covered when no part of the clear Sky appeared Close when the Sky was covered with one uniform thick Cloud .
I have often thought that if such a Register as this , or one that were better contrived , with the help of some Instruments that for exactness might be added , were kept in every County in England , and so constantly published , many things relating to the Air , Winds , Health , Fruit fulness , &amp;c. might by a sagacious man be collected from them , and several Rules and Observations concerning the extent of Winds and Rains , &amp;c. be in time established , to the great advantage of Mankind .
Whether you will think it worth the Royal Society 's consideration and promotion , I leave it to you .
From this solitary one there is little to be collected .
The pains is so little , that I indulged my Curiosity , when it cost me the writing not so much as a line a day .
For , though besides the ordinary Observation , which I set down commonly every morning , there seldom happened any Rain , Snow , or other remarkable change , which I did not set down .
But as you see , a few Letters and Figures do it ; such as it is I send it you , and if it may be of use to any one I shall be glad .
N. B. That the Thermoscope marked 4 , which I made use of till Mar. 7 .
1701 .
wasone of those sold by Mr Tompion , wherein o marked Temperate , and the Figures from thence increasing both upwards and downwards , showed the increase of Heat and Cold from Temperate .
Sept. 22 .
1701 .
I began to use a new sealed Thermoscope , adjusted to a Scale made by Mr John Patrick in the Old Bailey , who places o at the top , supposing it to be the Heat under the line , and so the Figures increase downwards , with the increase of Cold .
Temperate being placed at 45 .
This Thermoscope is marked 5 in my Register .
