During the last few years the minds of medical men and of the general public have been exercised over the rapid and striking increase in the mortality from cancer , as shown by the statistics contained in the Registrar-General 's Annual Reports .
The following table , taken from these reports , shows how great this increase in registered mortality has been .
The registered death-rate of males from this disease was 2'7 times , for females 2*0 times , and for both sexes together 2*2 times , as high in 1891 as in the average for the decade 1851\#151 ; 60 .

572 572 615 621 656 676 692 1 That cancer has really increased in this country appears to be now generally assumed in medical circles .
Sir Spencer Wells , in his Morton Lecture ( November , 1888 ) , gives the Registrar-General 's figures , showing that the mortality from cancer had increased from 488 per million of the population in 1877 to 615 per-million in 1887 in England and Wales , and from 350 per million in 1877 to 430 per million in 1887 in Ireland , as proof of this increase ; and further quotes the statement of Dr. Fordyce Barker , that the mortality from cancer in the city of New York had risen from 400 per million in 1875 to 530 per million in 1885 .
The attitude taken by the Registrar-General 's Department has become somewhat modified of late years , doubts having been formerly 210 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
cast on the reality of the increase , whereas now the generally received medical opinion appears to have been adopted .
Thus , Dr. Ogle ( p. xiv , Supplement to the 45th Annual Report ( 1882 ) of the Registrar-General ) points out that the deaths ascribed to malignant disease in the decennium 1851-60 amounted to 317 annually per million persons living ; in the next decennium it had risen to 387 ; and in the decennium 1871\#151 ; 80 to 473 ; but adds : " there can be very little doubt that a considerable part in this apparent increase is simply due to improved diagnosis and more careful statement of cause on the part of the medical men .
" In the 46th Annual Report ( 1883 ) of the Registrar-General ( p.xviii ) , are the following remarks , bearing on the same point : " How much , if any , of this increase ( in cancer ) was real cannot be stated with any accuracy ; but that some part of the apparent increase was only apparent , and due to improved diagnosis and more careful statement of cause , can , as we stated in previous reports , scarcely be doubted .
Year by year the number of deaths ascribed to " abdominal disease " and other imperfectly stated causes has been undergoing diminution , and there has been , of course , a corresponding addition to the mortality under the more definite headings .
Moreover , the increase of mortality from cancer has been considerably greater in the male than in the female sex .
Now , were the rise not only apparent but real , there would seem to be no reason why males should have suffered more than females ; whereas the difference is readily intelligible on the hypothesis that the rise was , at any rate in great measure , really due to improved diagnosis .
For the cancerous affections of males are in a much larger proportion internal or inaccessible than are those of females , and consequently are more difficult of recognition , so that any improvement in medical diagnosis would add more to the male than to the female figures .
" In the 52nd Annual Report ( 1889 ) of the Registrar-General ( p. xiii ) , attention is again drawn to the increasing mortality from cancer , which now amounted to 656 per million persons living , " showing a further increase upon the ever-growing rates previously recorded .
" Then follow these remarks ( the italics are ours ) :\#151 ; " Some of the increase is most certainly attributable to increased accuracy in statement of cause , and to the system introduced some years back into this office of writing for further information in cases where some vague cause , such as 'tumour , ' had been given as the cause of death in the original certificate ; a system which added , for instance , in the year 1889 no less than 421 deaths to the heading ' Cancer .
' Nevertheless , in face of the constant and great growth of mortality under this heading , and the expressed belief of medical practitioners specially engaged in dealing with this class of diseases that they are becoming more and more common , seems scarcely On the alleged Increase of Cancer .
possible to maintain the optimistic view that the whole of the apparent increase can be thus explained ; and it must be as at any rate highly probable , that a real increase is taking place in the frequency of these malignant affections .
" It is evident , therefore , that although the view that the increase in cancer was chiefly , if not entirely , apparent has , until recently , been held in the English General Register Office , it is now reluctantly accepted as a probable fact that cancer has really increased ; and it must be admitted that the figures on which this conclusion is based , as shown in the preceding table , look , at first sight , to be overwhelming in the weight of their evidence .
A more careful investigation , however , shows that the ratios prepared in the usual manner from the returns of the Registrar-General at the best only approximately represent the truth , and that , in fact , they may even be very misleading .
Cancer is , par excellence , a disease of mature life .
In a population of 1,000,000 adult males , aged from 25 to 35 , about 95 would die annually from cancer ; while there would be about 2,530 deaths among 1,000,000 males from 55 to 65 , and 4,405 deaths in 1,000,000 males aged from 65 to 75 .
Therefore , to take the deaths from cancer at all ages in a community , and to compare them with the total population in order to arrive at the cancer death-rate , may introduce an error sufficiently serious to vitiate the results .
If there be a larger proportion of lives , below , say , 50 years of age , the fraction formed by dividing the number of deaths from cancer by the total population will give an unduly small ratio ; whereas , if the lives above 50 years of age be in excess , the ratio will be unduly large .
Row the age distribution of one district may differ materially from that of another , and the age distribution of the males in a community may differ from that of the females , and the age distribution of the same district may possibly differ at different periods .
That this consideration is of great importance is shown by Table I ( Appendix ) , which gives the age distribution per million of population of each sex according to the census of 1881 in the several divisions of the United Kingdom .
It will be noticed that the average age of females in England and Scotland is higher than that of males , while the converse is the case in Ireland ; and that the average age of the population in Ireland is much higher than in either England or Scotland .
Consequently the death-rate from cancer given by the Registrar-Generals of the three divisions of the United Kingdom in their Annual Reports are unduly unfavourable to the female sex in Great Britain and to the male sex in Ireland ; and similarly the death-rate from cancer in Ireland is exaggerated as compared with that of the sister kingdom .
To rectify this error it is necessary to assume a standard of age distribution , to be applied to each set of statistics examined .
It is not 212 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
of importance what standard is selected , because , all the observations being treated alike , the comparisons instituted between them will be entirely trustworthy .
It is desirable , however , to adopt a standard which is not purely arbitrary , and in the following investigations we have therefore used that given by the " English Life Table , No. 3 , Persons , " as the most suitable .
This represents a stationary population unaffected by changes in the birth-rate or by migrations ; and , although no existing community conforms to it , yet , for purposes of comparison of one community with another , it answers every purpose .
The following is the age distribution according to this standard :\#151 ; Table B.\#151 ; Age Distribution according to the English Life Table , No. 3 , Persons .

46,715 1,000,000 These considerations showing that a source of fallacy lurks m the rates of mortality usually quoted ( especially when one country is compared with another ) , and that this fallacy specially affects the question of cancer , we came to the conclusion that it was desirable to investigate the alleged increase of cancer altogether afresh , and to avail ourselves in doing so of all the materials that could be turned to good account .
In order to be useful , the materials must extend over a long period of time , and must be presented in such form that , at any rate for several intervals of years , the deaths from cancer and the population may be grouped according to age and sex .
The records of life assurance offices of old standing might throw much light upon the subject , and doubtless if access could be had to them , and if the experience were collated in a suitable manner , an immense amount of most valuable information would be obtained .
Unfortunately these sources , with one conspicuous exception , are not available .
This exception is the Scottish Widows ' Fund Life Assurance Society .
For many years that institution has been accustomed at each septennial investigation to prepare a very complete statement of its mortality experience , distinguishing the deaths , according to age and according to the causes of death , and at the same time giving the number of lives at risk in each interval of age .
Through the On the alleged Increase of Cancer .
courtesy of the manager , Mr. A. H. Turnbull , these statistics have been placed at our disposal , and he has also kindly given us the figures for the four years 1888-91 , which have elapsed since the last septennial valuation , thus enabling ns to bring the investigation approximately up to date .
So far as we know , the British Empire Mutual is the only other office which has abstracted its experience in such a form as in the present connexion could be of any service .
The experience of that Society , distinguishing diseases , was published for the two periods 1847-72 and 1872-78 , and the following figures are extracted from the reports:\#151 ; Table C.\#151 ; Experience of the British Empire Mutual Life Office .

They show an apparent increase of about 50 per cent , in the death-rate from cancer in the period 1873-78 over 1847-72 ; but it must be remembered that , the office having been founded only in 1847 , the lives assured had , in the earlier of the two periods , on the average much more recently passed the medical examination than in the later period .
Cancer being a disease of comparatively slow development , this is a disturbing factor the effects of which it is impossible to measure .
A life office must have been established for many years , and must for a long period have been transacting a business approximately uniform , before it is safe to base any conclusions upon its experience of such a disease as cancer .
The Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society and the Clergy Mutual Life Office have each published their experience , giving the deaths from cancer and the lives at risk according to age ; and in the collective experience of thirty American offices , published in 1881 , 214 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
similar particulars are given ; but in eacb of these cases only one period of time is investigated , and therefore , for present purposes , their figures cannot be utilised .
On two occasions the Australian Mutual Provident Society , which is the largest life office in the British dominions , has investigated its mortality experience , and on each occasion has tabulated its cancer figures ; but , for various reasons which we need not particularise , this information could not be successfully utilised .
The returns of the Scottish Widows ' Fund , above mentioned , extend over four septennia and a broken period of four years , making a total period of thirty-two years during which it is possible to minutely investigate the causes and progressive rates of mortality .
The figures , so far as they bear upon the present inquiry , are given in Table II in the Appendix .
The Scottish Widows ' Fund statistics being only available in the form given in Table II , we proceeded to extract the Registrar-General 's data for the same periods and in the same form , in order that trustworthy comparisons might be instituted ; and we also treated in precisely the same way the valuable statistics of Frankfort-on the-Main , to be described more minutely later on .
For England , Scotland , and Ireland respectively , the census enumerations of 1861 , 1871 , and 1881 were available for both males and females , the populations being classified in the same age periods as in the data supplied by the Scottish Widows ' Fund .
We had also the total populations , both male and female , enumerated in 1891 , but information as to the age distribution of these populations had not hitherto been published .
It was therefore necessary to assume that the age distribution in 1891 was the same as in 1881 .
A source of inaccuracy has been thus introduced , but its magnitude cannot be serious.* From the figures in the four census enumerations , the number of males and females respectively living in the middle of the years 1861 , 1871 , 1881 , and 1891 , were calculated for each age period 25\#151 ; 35 , 35\#151 ; 45 , 45\#151 ; \#163 ; 5 , 55\#151 ; 65 , 65\#151 ; 75 , and 75 and over ; and from these figures again the numbers living in each age group in the middle of each year from 1860 to 1891 inclusive were worked out .
These were then classed into septennial periods , as with the Scottish Widows ' Fund , with a broken period at the end .
In this way was obtained with great accuracy the population in age groups in each division of the United Kingdom , passing through a year of life in each of the septennia under review .
The deaths from cancer , arranged according to age , are given in the annual returns of the Registrar-General , and these were extracted and summed for the * Owing to the steady fall in tli\#169 ; birth-rate between 1881 and 1891 , the average age of the population is probably somewhat higher at the latter date .
This would tend to slightly exaggerate the apparent increase in the death-rate from cancer .
On the alleged Increase of Cancer .
septennial periods .
The annual returns for England and Wales and for Ireland came down to 1890 inclusive , but for Scotland the last year available was 1889 , and the several observations were therefore closed at these points respectively .
In the case of Ireland , we could not obtain the deaths from cancer prior to 1864 , and we have therefore been limited to the three years 1864-66 for Ireland , instead of the seven years 1860-66 , For purpose of reference , and in case other inquirers desire further to investigate our figures , we give them in Tables II to V in the Appendix , arranged as above described .
From the figures in Tables II to V may be at once obtained the death-rates from cancer for each period of years , and for each age interval .
As the resulting rates are necessary to the subsequent calculations , they are given in Tables VI to IX in detail , and are expressed as rates per million , in order to reduce the number of decimal places .
The numbers , as might have been expected , run irregularly , but , on account of the method of grouping of the figures later on , this irregularity is not of any practical importance .
The rates of mortality given in Tables YI to IX , notwithstanding the considerable numbers on which they are based , do not run with sufficient regularity to disclose the general law by which they are governed ; and , even though they did run regularly , it would not be easy to discover from them that law .
Moreover , it is not the object of the present inquiry to ascertain the liability to cancer at different J ages , but to discover whether cancer is on the increase or not in the community generally .
It is therefore necessary so to group the figures that the total cancer experienced at all ages in any particular period of years may be compared with the total cancer experienced in any other period .
If we take the rates of mortality given in Tables-YI to IX and multiply them into the populations of Table B , we shall have the desired results .
The sum of the products for any particular period of years will give the number of deaths from cancer per annum among 1,000,000 persons aged 25 and upwards .
Then by comparing the sum for , say , the period 1860-66 with that for the period 1881\#151 ; 87 , we can ascertain in which direction the apparent-death-rate from cancer is progressing .
It will be observed also that by pursuing this course the observations for all the different localities and all the different periods of years are reduced to one common standard , and the errors are eliminated which would arise from variations in the age distribution of the populations .
Tables X and XI display these results in their final form , the ratios for ages under 55 and over 55 respectively , as well as for all ages , being given in them .
Some persons may be glad to be able to investigate the matter for these two great periods of life , although we do not propose to include this branch of the subject in our inquiry .
VOL. LIV .
Q 216 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
In Tables X and XI the death-rates have been corrected for age distribution , and a single illustration will indicate how important is this correction , and how serious an error may result from its omission .
Taking from Tables III and Y the total population at risk for all ages , and the total deaths from cancer , and dividing the second by the first for each period of years for England and Ireland respectively , we shall have the death-rates from cancer in the form usually presented by the Registrar-General .
They are given in the following table , and alongside them are placed the corrected rates from Table X. Table D.\#151 ; Comparison of Corrected and Uncorrected Cancer Death- rates .

The corrected figures , however , show that Ireland stands below England throughout , so that in the first two periods the position of the countries is reversed by the correction , and in the last three periods the difference in favour of Ireland is very great indeed .
It is evident that the ordinary method of presenting the statistics exaggerates the rate of cancer in Ireland as compared with England , a result which , as already explained , ing to the age distribution of the the subject by a careful analysis of Tables X and XI .
It is , however , difficult from arrays of figures to ascertain their exact teaching , and it is , therefore , desirable to aid the mind by translating the figures into a graphic form .
In Tables X and XI the rates of mortality from cancer are given for five periods of years , and from them the rates may be obtained for each individual year .
If these subdivided results be then plotted out in curves , the forms and directions of the curves will show at a glance , far more conclusively than could the most elaborate examination of might have been expected , ow populations of the two countries .
Much light may be thrown on On the alleged Increase of Cancer .
217 tabulated figures , the nature of the progression of the rates of mortality .
This distribution into individual years might be accomplished by skilful application of analytical processes ; but the method would be very difficult on account of the nature of the material available , and the results could scarcely fail to be unsatisfactory and untrustworthy .
The end can be much more satisfactorily attained by a modification of the late Joshua Milne 's graphical method of constructing mortality tables , which has been fully described , and of which the beautiful accuracy has been demonstrated and illustrated by one of us ( G. K. ) in two papers in the ' Journal of the Institute 218 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
of Actuaries , ' vol. xxiv and vol. xxx .
As showing the application of the method to the present inquiry , the accompanying diagram , No. 1 , relating to England and Wales , is submitted , of which a very few words of explanation will suffice .
Along the abscissa axis are marked off equal lengths to represent each of the periods of seven years under review , with a portion of proportionate length for the three years 1888-90 ; and along the ordinate axis the rates of mortality per million are marked off .
Rectangles are then erected , the areas of which are to represent the number of deaths from cancer in each of the septennial periods .
Thus the area of the rectangle for the septennium 1860-66 is 4,375 for males , as its base is 7 and its altitude 625 .
Similarly for the other rectangles .
Through the tops of the rectangles must then be drawn a continuous curve in such a way that the area cut off is exactly equal to the area added .
The length of the ordinate of the curve which is central to any particular year will then give the deaths from cancer in that year ; and the accuracy of the drawing of the curve will be proved , if there be no sudden change of direction , and if the sum of the numbers for the seven years of a septennium is equal to the area of the rectangle for that septennium .
Diagram No. 1 shows the curves for England and Wales , that for males being iu an unbroken line , and that for females in a dotted line .
Similar curves were prepared for all the observations so far discussed , and they are collected in Diagram No. 3 , so that they may be easily compared .
The curves for males are in continuous lines , while those for females are broken , and that for the Scottish Widows ' Fund is marked by crosses .
The only curve which proved at all intractable was that for the Scottish Widows ' Fund in its earlier portion .
It will be seen from Table X that the death-rate from cancer in the first septennium was very light , while in the second it was comparatively heavy , very nearly equal to that in the third , and that the rates in the third , fourth , and fifth exhibit an almost uniform upward progression .
These peculiarities are better seen by the help of Diagram No. 2 , where the deaths are represented by the rectangles .
The second and third rectangles being of nearly the same altitude , while the first is much lower , and the fourth considerably higher , there is indication of a rapid rise in the curve between the first and second periods and of a slight fall between the second and the third , and effect has been given to this in the undulating curve shown in the diagram .
The most unpractised eye will , however , at once perceive that the undulating line cannot represent the real law of the curve , and more especially so when the other six curves are examined ( Diagram 3 ) .
Except for the one bend in the Scottish Widows ' Fund curve , they all partake of one character , and the conclusion is forced upon us On the alleged Increase of .
that the twist in the Scottish Widows ' Fund curve is abnormal , and that it must be removed if we are to arrive at the true teaching of the facts .
The data are given in septennial periods , and the shape of the figure suggests that were it possible to rearrange them into , say , quinquennial periods , the abnormality would disappear .
The abnormality is introduced by insisting on the rule that the area of each portion of the curve must be exactly equal to the area of its corresponding rectangle , a rule which is to a certain extent arbitrary .
Where , as in the case of the Scottish Widows ' Fund experience , the original facts are few , and insufficient when grouped into short 220 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
periods to form trustworthy averages , it is better to enlarge the rule , and to redistribute the deaths slightly as between the adjacent periods , while still arranging that the curve shall in general Outline follow the summits of the rectangles , and that the area of the curve shall exactly equal the areas of the rectangles in the aggregate .
In Diagram No. 2 the correction of the curve on these principles is shown , and it is this corrected curve which is repeated in Diagram No. 3 .
How slight the correction really is becomes apparent when .we state that it is equivalent to the transfer of only seven deaths in the Scottish Widows ' Society from the second to the first septennium , On the alleged Increase of Cancer .
221 and of one death from the third to the second septennium .
Where the data are so scanty such slight adjustments are unavoidable .
It may be added , however , that the general deductions to be drawn from the forms of the carves are the same whether we adopt the original or the corrected curve of the Scottish Widows ' Fund .
In Table XII the distributed rates of mortality , as derived from the curves , are given for each of the seven sets of observations so far considered .
We are now in a position to examine more attentively the nature of the seven curves , and to attempt to derive from them the lessons which they are capable of conveying .
The Irish curves are the lowest of all , and are consistent with each other .
In each of them there is a moderate upward gradient from the beginning to the end of the observations .
The English curves for males and females are far apart , the female mortality from cancer being very heavy .
The two curves are , how--ever , consistent with each other .
They both show a decided and slightly increasing gradient from beginning to finish .
The Scottish curves are much nearer each other than the English , the males in Scotland having a higher apparent mortality from cancer than in England , and the females having one lower .
The gradient in the Scottish curves is much the same as in the English , except that for the last year or two the rise is more rapid .
The experience for the last period is for two years only in Scotland , while for England and Ireland it extends over three years , and this may account for the difference .
Probably for this reason the curves at the end are more to be depended on for England and Ireland than for Scotland .
The correction for age distribution which we have introduced brings out the fact that Ireland seems to enjoy a great comparative immunity from cancer .
Probably deficient accuracy in diagnosis and certification may account for much , if not all , of this difference .
Ireland is a poor country , the majority of whose inhabitants cannot afford to pay much for medical attendance .
The resulting deficient medical attendance would tend to produce defective diagnosis , and thus to lower the cancer curve .
Probably also , owing to the poverty of the patients and consequently of the medical attendants , the average skill of the general practitioners over large tracts in Ireland is less than in Scotland and England , and this again would lead to defective diagnosis .
It is probable that in Scotland the general practitioner has been in the past better educated than in England , and this would cause the curves for the sexes to approximate , because in the female , cancer being more commonly accessible in position , is more easily diagnosed 222 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
than in the male , and improvement in diagnosis would raise the curve for males ia greater proportion than that for females .
This argument is , however , scarcely consistent with the fact that the curve for English females is the highest of the seven .
It appears therefore probable that , apart from diagnosis , there is some cause in English female life more favourable to cancer than among Scottish women .
The Scottish Widows ' Fund curve has the easiest gradient of all , and this seems strongly to point in the direction so frequently indicated by the Registrar-General , that the apparent increase of cancer in the community is due to increased accuracy in diagnosis and certification .
The policy holders in the Scottish Widows ' Office are insured on the average for substantial sums , and are , therefore , presumably well-to-do , and able to secure , on the whole , better medical attendance than the mass of the people .
The diagnosis throughout has , therefore , probably been good , as suggested by the fact that the curve begins comparatively high .
But even among the most highly skilled members of the medical profession diagnosis has been improving , and therefore the Scottish Widows ' Fund curve rises like the others .
Among the class of practitioners attending assured lives there is not , however , the same scope for improvement in diagnosis and certification of death as in the profession as a whole , and the gradient of the Scottish Widows ' Fund curve is consequently easy .
This curve might have been expected to be below those , for English and Scottish males , because , although there is a small admixture of females who suffer more severely from cancer than males , yet the lives g , re select .
Persons with marked cancerous family histories are excluded .
Cancer , moreover , is a disease whose development is usually gradual and slow , and may be preceded for several years by non-malignant disease of the part subsequently affected with cancer ; hence , for two , or even three or four , years after an initial medical examination , cancer among insured lives should be comparatively rare .
Notwithstanding these considerations , the Scottish Widows ' Fund curve is above all the other curves for males at the commencement , though it falls below those for England and Scotland at the finish .
This , as we have already remarked , points to good diagnosis on the part of the medical attendants of the assured lives , and to an improvement in diagnosis on the part of the medical profession generally during the last thirty years .
Another reason for thinking that the apparent increase in cancer is at any rate mostly due to improved diagnosis is derived from a comparison of the curves for males and females respectively .
It will be noticed that the curves for females are always the higher , and that in each pair of curves the difference is practically constant through- On the alleged Increase of Cancer .
223 out the entire period .
Now , if there were a real increase of cancer , there is no sufficient ground for thinking that this would be confined to any one set of organs of the body , or would affect one sex more than another ; and in such case the difference between the cancer in .males and females would be a percentage of the total , and would increase at the same rate as the curves themselves rise , and consequently the curves for males and females would tend to widen their distance apart .
This , however , is not so .
In each of the three pairs the curves for males and females do not diverge , but , if anything , tend to approximate .
It may be urged that , notwithstanding what has been said above , cancer may have increased more in certain parts of the body than in others , and that , although it has really increased in both sexes , it has increased in such greater proportion among males , that the curves for the two sexes remain parallel .
This view , however , is contradicted by the Frankfort statistics , to be discussed presently , which confirm in a remarkable manner the conclusion we have drawn that it is only the cancer of organs common to both males and females which has apparently increased , while cancer of the special female organs , which is most easy of all to diagnose , has practically remained constant .
The chief weakness of the figures already given for cancer consists in ( 1 ) the absence of distinction between carcinoma and , the two chief varieties of malignant disease , which are , however , pathologically distinct ; and ( 2 ) the absence of statement of the part of the body primarily affected by the cancer .
An accurate statement of the site of the primary cancer in each case would enable us to ascertain whether the increase of cancer had been general , or chiefly in the cancer of inaccessible parts the diagnosis of which is comparatively difficult .
Unfortunately medical certificates of death commonly omit any statement of the organ affected by cancer , and comparisons founded on those cases in which the position is stated in successive years are open to the fallacy that the non-localised cancers may have been transferred in increasing numbers to the more definite headings as time goes on .
There are no statistics available in which an accurate distinction is made between carcinoma and sarcoma , and the general terms \#166 ; " cancer " or " malignant disease " must therefore be regarded as including these two forms of malignant new growths in unknown proportions .
It may be added , moreover , that no such statistics would be trustworthy unless each death were followed by an aqtopsy and by a microscopical examination of the diseased parts .
The town of Frankfort-on the-Main is the only one known to us which has for a long series of years kept an accurate record of deaths from all causes , in which deaths from cancer are classified according 224 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
to the parts of the body primarily affected.* In the original the Frankfort figures are given in great detail , hut we have summarised them somewhat .
Thus , Table XIII shows both for males and females at all ages the total number of deaths from cancer of various parts of the body in the same year periods as we have adopted throughout this paper .
The subdivisions in Table XIII are still too minute , and the numbers consequently too small , for the purposes of useful investigation in the present connexion , and we therefore proceeded to group them , as shown in Table XIV , tin three broad classes , which may be called " accessible cancer , " comprising cancers of external parts of the body and other parts in which the nature of the disease is easily demonstrable during life by physical examination ; " inaccessible cancer , " comprising cancers of internal parts and other parts in which , as in the case of cancer of the bones , diagnosis is less easily made ; and " cancer , position undefined , " comprising simply the first line of Table XIII .
In Table XIV only deaths at age 20 and over are included .
Under " Accessible cancer " we have included only the four headings Tongue , Mamma , Uterus , and Vagina , cancers of which are all capable of careful and exact diagnosis .
Under " Inaccessible cancer " come cancers primarily affecting any other parts of the body .
It will be seen from Table XIII that the great majority of cancers coming under this second head are of parts of the body in which the difficulties of diagnosis are great .
The classification cannot be regarded as perfect .
Thus it may be pointed out that the first group embraces a large excess of women , among whom it is shown by the Registrar-General 's returns in Great Britain that the apparent increase in cancer has been in less ratio than among men .
In the next place , it may be argued that we have placed under the " inaccessible " division cancer of certain parts that might be more appropriately described as accessible .
The following are the doubtful cases here referred to:\#151 ; * ' Statistiche Mittheilungen fiber den Ciyilstand der Sfcadfc Frankfurt-am-Main * ( 1860\#151 ; 1889 ) .

" bone 2 2 6 6 Total 41 48 72 100 Of the cancers enumerated above , cancer of the pharynx , thyroid gland , larynx , trachea , and penis are most accessible , but their number is so small ( twelve in all ) that their transference to the " accessible " group would have no appreciable effect ; and since , before the paper took its present shape , they had been included with other cancers in their appropriate physiological system , and a considerable amount of calculation had been based upon that classification , they have been allowed to remain in the " inaccessible " group .
Cancer of the prostate and bladder may be regarded as intermediate between the " accessible " and " inaccessible " groups , but as cancer of these organs appears to have increased in a smaller proportion than the population , the effect of introducing it into the " inaccessible " group , is rather to diminish the already striking difference which we shall show to exist between the increase in " accessible " and " inaccessible " cancer respectively .
Cancer of the oesophagus has , we think , been properly placed in the " inaccessible " group .
The majority of cases of stricture of the oesophagus in persons over 50 are undoubtedly due to cancer , and yet certificates stating the cause of death at these ages as " stricture of oesophagus , " without any definition of the cause of sti'icture , are still common .
There can be no doubt that in the past they have been much more common , and that therefore cancer of the oesophagus is rightly placed in the class of " inaccessible " cancers which have been largely affected by improved diagnosis and certification of deaths .
Cancer of bone has also been placed in the same group .
The number under this head is small , and , as the vertebrae and other inaccessible bones are a favourite seat of cancer of bone , the classification appears to us correct .
Cancer of the rectum is more accessible than that of other parts of 226 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
the intestines , and we have , therefore , extracted it separately , in order to ascertain whether its increase is in the same ratio as that of cancer of the upper parts of the intestine .
The result is as follows:\#151 ; Table F.\#151 ; Cancer of Rectum and other parts of Intestines in Septennial Periods .
Period .
Cancer of rectum .
Cancer of remaining parts of intestines .
1860-66 21 15 1867-73 28 19 1874-80 39 36 1881-87 32 47 Thus , while cancer of the rectum increased ( in absolute amount and not relatively to the population* ) 52'4 per cent. , cancer of the rest of the intestines increased 213-3 per cent. It is evident , therefore , that by including cancer of the rectum in the group of " inaccessible " cancel 's we have further diminished the sharp contrast between " accessible " and " inaccessible " cancers .
In Table XIII we give the deaths from cancer in Frankfort during the period under review , grouped according to age and sex ; and in the sub-headings , a , ft and 7 , in Table XIV , the same facts are classified as above described .
Census enumerations of the city of Frankfort have been taken at frequent but irregular intervals , and wTe have been able to avail ourselves of the returns for 1864 , 1867 , 1871 , 1875 , 1880 , and 1885 .
From these we calculated the population in the middle of each year from 1860 to 1889 inclusive for both males and females , arranged according to age ; and a summary of the results is given in Table XIV .
On account of the military element which prevails on the Continent , there were some causes of disturbance , but , owing to the frequency of the censuses , these were not of much practical importance , and , moreover , they scarcely affected the ages which , in an inquiry into cancer , are principally concerned .
From the populations of Table XV and the deaths of Table XII the annual death-rates were calculated , corresponding to those in Tables VI\#151 ; X , but it is scarcely necessary to reproduce them here .
From these again were calculated the annual deaths from cancer in 1,000,000 living aged 25 and over , the population being as before * The population of Frankfort increased from an average of 53,550 in the years 1860-66 to an average of 92,500 in the years 1881-87 ; i.e. , it nearly doubled .
Therefore the rate of mortality from cancer of the rectum really diminished .

distributed in age groups , according to the English Life Table No. 3 , Persons , as shown in Table B. A very slight adjustment was required in consequence of the Frankfort statistics being prepared for the decades 20\#151 ; 30 , 30\#151 ; 40 , \amp ; c. , and not for 25\#151 ; 35 , 35\#151 ; 45 , \amp ; c. , as at home .
The final results are given in Table XVI .
The first thing that strikes one in examining this table is , the marked prevalence of cancer in Frankfort as compared with the United Kingdom , and we have failed to discover any facts in explanation of this , unless it be the extremely careful certification for which that city is noted .
Nevertheless the same general laws prevail as with all the other statistics available .
Cancer preponderates greatly in the female sex , and , looking at the column relating to the total cancer , the progressive apparent increase for both sexes is observable .
The Frankfort figures are , however , very instructive on account of the sub-division of which they are capable .
The cancer of undefined position does not show much sign of progressive change .
No doubt on account of paucity of data , the numbers run irregularly , but from beginning to end of the thirty years under review there is no marked tendency to increase or decrease .
This fact is of great importance , because , although in any one year there may be accidental fluctuations , yet , taken over such a long series of years , the figures become trustworthy .
On the other hand , the rates of mortality from " inaccessible " cancer , both for males and females , steadily rise , though , perhaps , not quite so rapidly as in the United Kingdom .
One very remarkable fact becomes apparent , namely , that males and females suffer almost equally from " inaccessible " cancer , the average for the thirty years being 1,641 for males and 1,640 for females .
The excessive mortality from cancer of females is confined to " accessible " cancer , that is , practically to cancer of the female sexual organs .
The numbers relating to " accessible " cancer run somewhat irregularly , probably because of the paucity of data , among males there having been only 31 deaths in this category during the thirty years ; but no well marked law of variation can be detected .
There is , if anything , a tendency to decrease , at any rate as regards males , but the sequence of the numbers is not such that we could say with certainty whether or not that tendency would continue were the duration of the observations to be extended .
Taking a general view of the Frankfort figures , the one result of surpassing importance to be derived from them is that in those parts of the body in which cancer is easily accessible and detected there has been no increase in the mortality from it between 1860 and 1889 .
It may be mentioned that in 1887 Dr. Grimshaw , the Registrar-General for Ireland , began to tabulate the deaths from cancer in 228 Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Newsholme .
Ireland , according to the primary seat of the disease , whenever this is given in the death certificate .
The number of years as yet available does not allow of any valid deductions being drawn , and the great variation during the four available years under the head of cancer of unspecified parts causes a further difficulty in utilising the figures .
In the 52nd Annual Report ( 1889 ) of the Registrar-General for England , the subject of the part of the body affected by cancer is also discussed , and in the words of the Registrar-General , " a sufficiently large sample of those cases of cancer in which the seat of disease is more or less clearly specified " is taken out to warrant the assumption that " such samples fairly represent the bulk " ( p. 15 ) .
This method , however , does not appear to us to furnish trustworthy results , and we only refer to it here in passing .
To summarise , the conclusions arrived at from the whole investigation are as follows:\#151 ; 1 .
Males and females suffer equally from cancer in those parts of the body common to man and woman , the greater prevalence of cancer among females being due entirely to cancer of the sexual organs , viz. , the mamma , ovaries , uterus , and vagina .
This is shown by the Frankfort statistics , and may not unreasonably be accepted as a probable general law , seeing that in other respects , where comparison is possible , the Frankfort statistics are confirmed by those of the United Kingdom .
2 .
The apparent increase in cancer is confined to what we have called " inaccessible V cancer .
This is shown ( a ) by the Frankfort statistics ; ( 6 ) by the fact that the difference between the rates for males and females respectively is approximately constant , and does not progressively increase with the apparent increase in cancer in each of the sexes ; ( c ) because the apparent increase in cancer among the well-to-do assured lives , who are presumably attended by medical men of more than average skill , is not so great as among the general population .
3 .
The increase in cancer is only apparent and not real , and is due to improvement in diagnosis and more careful certification of the causes of death .
This is shown by the fact that the whole of the increase has taken place in inaccessible cancer difficult of diagnosis , while accessible cancer easily diagnosed has remained practically stationary .
