" Contributions towards the Solution of the Chemical Constitution of Isatin .
" By H. Kolbe .
[ The following pages contain the last experimental researches\#151 ; unfortunately unfinished\#151 ; of Hermann Kolbe , upon isatoic acid ( Isato-saui'e ) and its transformations .
I have endeavoured , in drawing up this paper , to infuse into it the true meaning and spirit of the deceased .
This difficult task has been made all the lighter for me from my having had , at the time these investigations were being carried out , frequent conversations with him upon the subject of them , but especially by his own exact notes .
Dr. Th. Bellmann and Herr Gr .
Schmidt , who assisted Professor Kolbe in part of the researches herein described , have also given me valuable assistance .
The title of this paper , " Contributions towards the Solution of the Chemical Constitution of Isatin , " is from the author himself .
He began to write the paper but a few hours before his death .
The opening paragraphs ( printed in italics ) are the last bequest which he has made to us .
The concluding ones ( also in italics ) are taken from remarks made by him which were plainly meant to form a part of this communication .

] Notwithstanding that so many facts have been collected with the object of definitely settling the constitution of yet arguments of weight sufficient to support a hypothesis of its rational , or indeed to raise it above the mere level of a hypotheare still wanting .
The property of isatin of forming crystalline compounds with the alkaline bisulphites led to the supposition of its belonging to the class of aldehydes or ketones ; its property , when in contact with bases , of assimilating the elements of water , and therewith forming isatic acid , from which 194 Professor Kolbe .

, which show a similar behaviour .
These facts alone , as already remarked , were not sufficient upon which to build a solid hypothesis of the constitution of isatin .
That this has nevertheless been attempted simply proves how much the necessity was felt of finding for isatin its proper place among those compounds to which it is most nearly related .
Oxidation of Isatin by Chromic Acid .
Isatoic Acids .
The first experiments upon the oxidation of isatin , which led to the discovery of the so-called isatoic acid , and also the behaviour of the latter , have been already shortly detailed.* Some of the statements then made as to the supposed composition of the compounds derived from that acid , require correction .
Since then isatoic acid and its derivatives have been the subjects of careful investigation .
If the supposition formerly expressed , viz. , that isatin is a compound of formyl and nitrogen-benzoyl be correct , then one might expect that it would , by suitable oxidation , be converted into a carboxylic acid , according to the following equation :\#151 ; ( C0 , C6H4l$r)C0H + 0 = ( C0 , C6H4N)C00H .
Nitrogen-benzoyl formyl .
Nitrogen-benzoyl carboxylic acid .
An acid of this atomic composition is in fact formed from isatin ; this is the compound termed in the preceding communication Isatoic acid , which name will be retained for it throughout this more complete paper .
The isatin used for its preparation was made in part by myself , by oxidising ( natural ) indigo by nitric or chromic acid , and partly procured from Schuchardt ( in Gorlitz ) and from Kahlbaum ( Berlin ) A solution of chromic acid in acetic acid has shown itself to be the only suitable oxidising agent for the conversion of isatin into isatoic acid .
The following mode of procedure , the result of many trials , has been found to be the best .
About 600 grams of glacial acetic acid ( the half of the total quantity to be used ) , are poured over 100 grams of finely powdered isatin placed in a large flask .
The .chromic acid ( 200 grams ) is brought , in moderate portions at a time ( each time about one-sixth of the total quantity ) , into a funnel loosely stoppered by means of a glass rod , and a part of the remaining .600 grams of acetic acid poured over it ; by lifting up the glass rod , * " Journ. fur Prakt .
Chem. " [ 2j , 30 , 84 , and 124 .
f The fact , perhaps already observed by other chemists , that the isatin got with .chromic acid is darker than that got with nitric , is explained by the tenacious adhesion to the first of small quantities of chromic oxide ; by dissolving this preparation in hot caustic soda solution and precipitating the filtrate by dilute sulphuric acid , absolutely pure isatin is obtained from it .
1885 .
j The Chemical Constitution of Isatin .
195 the solution is allowed to flow slowly into the mixture of isatin and acetic acid , which thereby becomes heated .
As soon as the slightest ebullition is noticeable , the flask must be cooled by ice-water .
After the mixture has become quite cold , the process is repeated as above , with frequent shaking , care being taken that the temperature does iiiot rise above 50 ' , as otherwise the product undergoes partial decom- ; position .
After each addition of chromic acid , the colour of the liquid , at ; first red , becomes darker ; when about the half of the chromic acid has been added , a brown flaky substance begins to separate out , the quantity of which goes on increasing , and before the whole has been run in , the bottom of the flask is seen to be coated with a dirty grey layer .
After the addition of all the chromic acid and acetic acid , the flask , with its dark-brown coloured contents , is allowed , after frequent shaking , to stand in cold water for 12 hours .
Should this be neglected , the liquid becomes heated again of itself ( the reaction not being yet at an end ) , and this must be avoided , as it is accompanied by partial decomposition .
At this stage the product contains as yet no isatoic acid .
To complete the oxidation , the flask with its muddy contents is now allowed to stand for some hours in water , kept at 40 ' to 50 ' ; a higher temperature is hurtful .
The contents thus undergo a distinct change ; the brown flakes vanish , a crystalline substance taking their place , and the liquid finally acquires the deep green colour of acetate of chromium .
The product is lastly heated for several hours at about 60 ' ; during this stage isatoic acid separates out in the form of a yellow crystalline powder .
To make this separation as far as possible complete , the whole is poured into 500 c.c. of extremely dilute sulphuric acid ; the precipitate thus got , after being washed with cold water with the aid of a filter-pump , and spread out on paper to dry , is almost quite pure isatoic acid .
The yield from 100 grams isatin is 80 grams , i.e. , 72 per cent , of the calculated amount .
It is finally obtained absolutely pure by one crystallisation from boiling acetone .
Other solvents are unsuitable for the purification of isatoic acid ; water , which , even when warm , dissolves it with difficulty , causes decomposition , with evolution of carbonic acid .
Ethyl and methyl alcohols etherify at the boiling temperature a part of the isatoic acid , as may be easily recognised from the agreeable odour which the crystals acquire .
Even the minute quantities of methyl alcohol which acetone contains show their presence in this way .
Isatoic acid crystallises from hot acetone ( of which about 23 parts at the boiling temperature are required for the solution of 1 part of acid ) in hard yellow prisms , which appear to be almost rectangular ; it melts at 230 ' , with decomposition , carbonic acid being given off , Professor Kolbe .
[ Mar. 12 , while at the same time a small amount of a substance crystallising in needles sublimes .
The yellow colour is characteristic of isatoic acid !

48 163 29 *5 100 *0 Adopting my idea of the composition of isatin , the process of its oxidation by chromic acid when the above conditions are observed proceeds , therefore , in this way , that the formyl of the isatin is changed to carboxyl , whereby nitrogen-benzoyl carboxylic acid is formed .
( See Equation , p. 194 .
) The chemical behaviour of isatoic acid , so far as I have studied it , is in complete harmony with the supposition that it is nitrogen-benzoyl carboxylic acid .
Of special importance for the right interpretation of its chemical constitution are its close relations to anthranilic acid , i.e. , o-amidobenzoic acid .
It is readily and completely changed into the latter ( or its derivatives ) by various reagents , carbonic acid being separated and the elements of one molecule of water assimilated .
This transformation of isatoic acid into anthranilic acid is shown by the following equation ( C6H4N , CO)COOH + H20 = ( C6H4NH2 ) COOH + C03 .
The two atoms of hydrogen of the water combine with the atom of nitrogen , which thereby becomes trivalent.to amide ; the oxygen atom of the water serves for the oxidation of the carbonyl , carbonic acid 1885 .

separating ; from nitrogen-benzoyl carboxylic acid there thus results amidophenyl carboxylic acid .
Action of Water on Isatoic Acid .
I As already mentioned , isatoic acid undergoes decomposition by prolonged boiling with water , carbonic acid being evolved .
The dark-coloured powder which separated out on cooling , yielded , after crystallisation from alcohol of 50 per cent. , beautiful needles of anthranilic acid ( melting point 145 ' ) , from which , by solution in hydrochloric acid , the characteristic compound of the latter with anthranilic acid , melting at 191 ' , was obtained .
Behaviour of Isatoic Acid towards Mineral Acids .
If isatoic acid be gently warmed with ordinary strong hydrochloric acid , decomposition with foaming ( evolution of carbonic acid ) ensues ; the crystalline mass obtained on evaporation is again dissolved in hydrochloric acid , in order to destroy all the isatoic acid .
The residue , after solution in water , yields , on cooling , colourless prisms of the hydrochloric-anthranilic acid , containing one molecule of water .

From the hot aqueous solution , which has been treated with animal charcoal , it crystallised in colourless prisms an inch long , which , according to the analysis , had the proper composition , and were also recognised as o-amidobenzoic acid through its transformation , by means of nitrous acid , into salicylic acid .

Tolerably concentrated sulphuric acid acts upon isatoic acid in exactly the same way as hydrochloric acid does ; the product is the sulphuric-anthranilic acid , which can in this way be easily got beautifully crystallised in large quantities .
The anthranilic acid separated from it gave an analysis corresponding to its composition .
Dilute nitric acid acts upon isatoic acid in a manner analogous to the above two acids , while concentrated turns it into a nitro-deriva-tive which is described below .
Hydrochloric acid gas , acting upon the alcoholic solution of isatoic acid , decomposes it in such a manner that carbonic acid escapes , while the ethyl ether of anthranilic acid is formed .
Hydrochloric acid gas was led to saturation , with gradual warming , into alcohol holding finely-powdered isatoic acid in suspension ; the resulting clear solution solidified , on cooling , to a mass of pale-yellow needles , which , after washing with alcohol or , better , ether , were analysed .

165 100 *00 Action of Bases upon Isatoic Acid .
Basic substances decompose isatoic acid likewise with evolution of carbonic acid ; since this takes place even at a low temperature , it has not been found possible to prepare salts of isatoic acid , as these undergo immediate decomposition into salts of carbonic and of anthra-nilic acids.* Isatoic acid , when heated with baryta-water , yielded besides car- * bonate of baryta the salt of anthranilic acid , which was extracted by saturating the solution with acetic acid and then shaking up with ether ; its melting point , as well as that of its hydrochloric acid compound , conclusively proved that it had been formed .
The action of ammonia on isatoic acid is to this extent different , that not the ammonium salt of anthranilic acid , but its amide , which , so far as my knowledge goes , is not yet known , is formed .
Isatoic acid is readily taken up by aqueous ammonia ; the solution 'immediately contains carbonate of ammonia , and after some time solidifies to a mass of yellow crystals , which , after being redissolved in hot water , separate out from the latter in glancing mother-of-pearl plates ; the mother-liquor yields , on evaporation , a further quantity .
This compound , which is extremely soluble in warm water and in alcohol , melts at 108 ' , and distils , with slight decomposition , towards 300 ' .
Chloroform is a capital solvent for it , and from this it crystallises in large white plates ; it is difficultly soluble in ether and hardly at all in benzol .

The same conversion of isatoic acid into this amide is brought about by the action of ammonia gas on the dry ( isatoic ) acid ; at about 60 ' a vigorous action , with strong foaming , begins , and in a short time the whole is converted into anthranilic amide .
The formation of the latter in this , as well as in the preceding case , is seen by the following i equation :\#151 ; ( C6H4N , CO)COONH4 = C6H4NH2 , C0NH2 + C02 .

[ Mar. 12 , Addition of water to the solution of the acid in alcohol , or in the mixture of alcohol and acetone , precipitates it .
The chemical behaviour* of nitro-isatoic acid corresponds generally with that of isatoic acid , the former being however more stable towards water , acids , \amp ; c. , than the latter .
Just as isatoic acid yields with those ^ reagents anthranilic acid , so does the nitro-derivative give a nitro* anthranilic acid , which corresponds with one of the two known compounds of this composition , and therefore explains the function of the nitroxyl in the original nitro-isatoic acid .
If the latter be evaporated along with aqueous hydrochloric acid carbonic acid is evolved ; the residue ( which contains no hydrochloric acid in chemical combination ) yields , upon recrystallisation from alcohol , a strong acid which forms yellow needles , is difficultly soluble in water , easily in alcohol and ether , and not at all in chloroform and benzol ; it melts between 265 ' and 270 ' with decomposition .
The same acid is formed , although more slowly , by the continued boiling of a mixture of water and nitro-isatoic acid .
As is shown by the properties of the product\#151 ; as given above\#151 ; but especially by the composition of the baryta salt prepared from it ( see the analysis of the same below ) , we have here to do with the nitro-anthranilic acid already obtained in a different way by Hiibnerf and by Griess , | the so-called m-nitro-o-amidobenzoic acid or ( e-nitro-amidobenzoic acid ) .

On treating nitro-isatoic acid with tin and tolerably concentrated hydrochloric acid , with gentle warming , much carbonic acid besides hydrogen escaped , which led one to suppose that a reduction product of the above nitro-amidobenzoic acid was formed , and this was verified by the examination of the resulting solution .
In this there was contained the hydrochloric acid salt of a diamidobenzoic acid , which , from its relation to the above nitroanthranilic acid , may be termed amido-anthranilic acid .
Its formation is shown by the following equation :\#151 ; H3 ] H3 ] C6N02 \gt ; CO , COOH + H6=C6NH2 \gt ; cooh + co2 + h2o .
N J NHj The above solution was first freed from tin by means of sulphuretted hydrogen , and then , in order to prevent decomposition setting in during the subsequent evaporation , a few crystals of acid sulphite of soda were added.* Notwithstanding this , the solution became brown-coloured , and deposited , when sufficiently concentrated , a salt likewise dark in colour , which after pressing was recrystallised from hot water containing a little hydrochloric acid .

The formation of a-nitrosalicylic acid from isato acid , as described above , is easily explained upon the supposition that the anthranilic acid ( amidobenzoic acid ) generated from the latter is nitrated by the nitrous acid , and that in this nascent nitro-amidobenzoic acid the amide is replaced by fiydroxyl .

Nitro-salicylic acid .
The foregoing research explains the behaviour of isatoic acid substantially only in one direction .
Other experiments are now being made , by means of which the changes induced in this compound by suitable oxidising and reducing agents are to be made clear , in order thereby to gain new foundations for the right perception of the chemical constitution of isatin and compounds derived from it .
We possess in the substance obtained by the oxidation of indigo , and named by me isatoic acid , a nitrogen compound which seems to be specially \#166 ; fitted to shed light upon the question whether nitrogen can act not only as a di- , tri- , tetra- , and penta-vdlent element ( as in nitric oxide , nitrous acid , and nitric acid ) , but also as a monovalent one .
The mode of formation and the chemical behaviour of this isatoic acid the conception that it is benzoylcarboxylic acid , in which one of the five phenyl hydrogen atoms is replaced by an atom of monovalent , and through the further supposition that isatin is its corresponding aldehyde\#151 ; such a simple and , from all points of view , -satisfactory explanation , that only one already prejudiced by the idea that nitrogen can only be trivalent can feel himself satisfied by the supposition that the molecular weight of isatoic acid must be doubled , i.e. , that it is a dibasic acid .
None of the facts which up till now I have discovered support hypothesis ; on the contrary , by the supposition that isato acid contains 1 atom of monovalent nitrogen as substitute for 1 atom of , they all obtain the simplest and least strained explanation in such a degree that , in the publication of my research on isatin and isatoic acid and their , I have not discussed the question whether the nitrogen in them may possibly be polyvalent .
N.B.\#151 ; Benzoyl carboxylic acid is usually termed phenyl glyoxylie acid , so that nitrogen-benzoyl carboxylic acid = nitrogen-phenyl glyoxy lie acid .
