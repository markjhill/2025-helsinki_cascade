[ ; 127 ] XII.-Experiments on the modulus of Torsion .
By BENJAMIN BEVAN , Esq. Communicated by the President .
Read December 18 , 1828 .
NUMEROUS experiments have already been published on the strength of wood and other substances , as far as regards their cohesion and elasticity ; but I am not aware of any extensive table of the modulus of torsion of different species of wood , deduced from experiments conducted upon a proper scale , and with the necessary care .
To supply this defect , and to furnish the practical engineer and mechanic with useful data , and with rules for their application , is the object of the present communication , consisting of a copious table of the results of my experiments , made at various times , and upon substances of considerable variety of dimensions within the ordinary limits of practice .
It is proper to observe , that the various specimens of wood upon which my experiments were made , were sound and dry , except it is otherwise expressed or described , and were in general free from all large knots .
Considerable care was used to obtain correct dimensions of the specimens under experiment , by means of a simple instrument , which answers the purpose of improved callipers , by which the dimensions of the specimens were measured , and read off by a magnifying-glass to the 400dth part of an inch .
Previous to trial , each specimen was brought to a prismatic form , as near as could be wrought by the ordinary means , and the dimensions afterwards taken by means of the improved callipers above mentioned , at equal distances ; and the mean breadth and thickness thus obtained , were used in the calculations for obtaining the modulus .
My experiments were often repeated on the same species of wood , under considerable variations of length , breadth , and thickness ; and always with the most satisfactory results ; viz. from nine to ninety inches in length , and from three inches to three tenths of an inch in thickness .
Due care was observed to prevent any error in the apparent torsion or twist arising from compression at the ends of the prisms , both at the clamp by which they were fixed , and at the radial lever at which the successive weights were applied ; two sources of error which have materially affected former experiments on this subject , in other respects carefully made .
To every specimen under experiment I attached two indexes ; one a few inches from the end fixed in the clamp or vice , and the other at a small distance from the attachment of the lever or wheel , where the weight or straining power was applied ; and the distance between the two indexes was used as the length for calculating .
Another error of less magnitude I have been able to avoid by fixing a pivot or small gudgeon at the supported end , in the line of the axis of the prism , instead of making the lower side or angle of the prism at the supported end the revolving point .
My experiments were made upon prisms of very different proportions as to breadth and depth , viz. from Ioth to equality .
In general practice , the square or cylindrical shaft is usually adopted , and as a cylindrical spindle or shaft of +th more in diameter than the side of a square shaft , will possess nearly the same stiffness in resisting a twisting force , it will , I presume , be sufficient in this place to give the rule for calculating the deflection of a square prismatic shaft , to which I shall add one example by way of illustration .
Rule.-To find the deflection ~ of a prismatic shaft of a given length I when strained by a given force w in pounds avoirdupois acting at right angles to the axis of the prism , and by a leverage of given length = r ; the side of the square shaft d. T , being the modulus of torsion from the following table ; 1 , r , 6 , and d , being in inches and decimals , r21w d4 T i. e. for a numerator , the square of the radius of the wheel or leverage multiplied into the length , and this product by the weight in pounds : and for a divisor , multiply the fourth power of the side of the square prism by the tabular modulus of torsion : divide the former by the latter , and the quotientwill be the deflection or quantity of twisting in inches and decimals when measured at 128 the end of the radius r. As an example , let there be a square* shaft of English oak 50 inches long and 6 inches by 6 inches , subject to a strain of 30001bs .
at the circumference of a wheel of 2 feet in diameter , or having a leverage of 12 inchest .
6X 6=--36 12 X 12=144 36 50 = length 1296 7200 20000 3000 = force 25920000 25920000)21600000(0.83 deflection , or nearly _ths of an inch .
And as the deflection will be directly as the force , a weight or force of 3001bs .
would produce a deflection of ilth of an inch .

I have observed in a great number of my experiments , that the modulus of torsion bears a near relation to the weight of the wood when dry , whatever may be the species ; and that for practical purposes we may obtain the deflection ( ~ ) from the specific gravity ( s ) .
