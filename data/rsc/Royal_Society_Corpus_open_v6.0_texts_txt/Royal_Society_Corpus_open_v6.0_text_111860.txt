I. Composition of Narcotine .
The announcement made by Wertheim*and Hinterbergert of the probable existence of various kinds of narcotine , rendered it necessary to commence the present investigation by a series of analyses of our material , in order to ascertain which variety of narcotine we were dealing with .
* The narcotine employed was obtained from Mr. Morson , to whom we are greatly indebted for the scrupulous care bestowed on its preparation and purification .
HEe stated that it was extracted from the residues which had accumulated during the preparation of very large quantities of morphine and codeine , from opium of various qualities and from various sources .
If , therefore , distinct varieties of narcotine exist , there was reason to expect that our narcotine would prove to be a mixture of several of them .
The results of all our analyses , however , agree with the formula C22 3 NO7 , as shown by the following Table , which gives the highest , lowest , and mean results obtained : Calculated .

Further data are , however , needed for the final decision of this question , and we shall accordingly feel very much indebted to any chemist who has a specimen of narcotine of well-ascertained origin , or which he believes to have a different composition from that given above , if he will kindly spare us a sufficient quantity for analysis .
II .
Composition of Cotarnine .
The combustion of cotarnine with oxide of copper and oxygen , as well as the determination of the proportion of platinum in its chloroplatinate , leads us to adopt the formula C12 H13 NO3 for this base .
The formula usually adopted contains one more atom of carbon ; but , independently of our analytical results , the supposition that cotarnine contains only twelve atoms of carbon is supported by the simple manner in which the action of oxidizing substances on narcotine can then be expressed , namely , by the equation C22 H23 NO7 +0 C'0 H11 05 + C1C H13 NO3 , Narcotine .
Opianic acid .
Cotarnine .
and , as will be shown hereafter , by the manner in which cotarnine is decomposed by dilute nitric acid .
III .
Decompositions of Opianic Acid .
Opianic acid is readily decomposed when heated with strong hydriodic acid ; no iodine is set free , but iodide of methyl is formed in considerable quantity at the same time as a non-volatile substance , very easily altered by heat and exposure to air , especially if in contact with alkali , the precise nature of which we have not yet been able to ascertain .
When opianic acid is heated with an excess of a very strong solution of potash , it splits up into meconin and hemipinic acid .
These substances were found by experiment to be formed in proportions corresponding to the equation 2 C10E1100 = C10 H100 ' + ( 10 H 06 Opianic acid .
Meconin .
Hemipinic acid .
The meconin thus produced has all the characters which have been ascribed by previous observers to meconin obtained by other processes ; its identity was further established by analysis , and by the preparation of chloroand nitro-meconin , the former of which was analysed .
The hemipinic acid was also found to be identical with that obtained directly from narcotine : the acid and its silver-salt were analysed .
Having thus found a method by which meconin and hemipinic acid can be produced with certainty and in large quantities , we intend to make an extended investigation of them and of opianic acid , in the hope of discovering the nature of the relationship of these three bodies to each other and to narcotine .
The principal results which we have hitherto obtained in this direction are as follows .
Action of Hydriodic Acid on Meeconin.-Meconin is decomposed by hydriodic acid like opianic acid , giving iodide of methyl and an easily alterable substance , the nature of which has not been determined .
Action of 'Iydriodic Acid on Hemipinic Acid.--Hemipinic acid , heated with concentrated hydiodic acid to within a few degrees of the boiling-point of the latter substance , is decomposed into iodide of methyl , carbonic acid , and an acid of the formula C7 HG O. It was found by direct experiment that two atoms of iodide of methyl are formed from each atom of hemipinic acid , so that the following equation probably represents the reaction : Cl ?
Hol 0G +2 HI =2 CW13 I+ C02 C7 H[ O4 Hemipinic acid .
New acid .
The new acid is moderately soluble in cold water , and very soluble in boiling water , alcohol , and ether ; its solution has a strongly acid reaction with test-paper .
It separates from hot water in small needleshaped crystals containing 14 80 per cent. water of crystallization , which they lose at 100 ?
( the formula C7 HI O+1U H2 0 corresponds to 14'92 per cent. water ) ; at a higher temperature the acid melts and sublimes without apparent alteration .
Dried at 100 ?

, it slowly oxidizes and becomes brown ; the same change takes place more rapidly when a solution of it , especially if neutral or alkaline , is evaporated .
A solution of the acid immediately reduces ammonionitrate of silver , even in the cold ; with sulphate of copper and a slight excess of potash it gives a yellowish-green solution , from which suboxide of copper is precipitated on warming .
The free acid , or its ammonia-salt , gives a very intense blue coloration with perchloride of iron .
The colour thus produced is changed to blood-red ( exactly resembling the red produced by the sulphocyanates ) by ammonia , and is destroyed by strong acids , being restored by dilution with water , or by neutralization by an alkali : like the colouring matter obtained by Anderson by the action of sulphuric acid on opianic acid , it is entirely removed from solution by alumina .
We have not yet obtained any of the salts of the new acid in a state fit for analysis , and prefer not to propose a name for it until its relationship to other bodies has been more thoroughly examined ; its formula , however , assigns to it a place in the following seriesC7 -16 ... ... ... . .

It is remarkable that salicylic and gallic acids both give colorations with perchloride of iron much resembling that produced by the acid C7 I1t 04 .
IV .
Action of dilute ANitric Acid on Cotarnine .
By gently heating cotarnine with very dilute nitric acid , we have obtained nitrate of methylamine and a new acid , cotarnic acid , but have not hitherto found out the conditions necessary for the certain production of the latter substance .
Cotarnic acid dissolves easily in water , giving a solution which reacts strongly acid with litmus-paper ; it dissolves only sparingly in alcohol , and is precipitatedfrom its alcoholic solution by ether .
Heated with an excess of sodium , it gives no trace of cyanide , and therefore contains no nitrogen .
With perchloride of iron it gives no coloration ; with acetate of lead it gives a white precipitate insoluble in excess of acetate ; with nitrate of silver it gives a precipitate which is very slightly soluble in hot water .
The silver-salt , crystallized from water , was found to contain C " H10Ag2 05 : on analysis it gave the following results : Calculated .

Cotarnic acid .
Nitrate of methylamine .
It is possible that the substance obtained by Anderson by the action of nitric acid on narcotine ( Chem. Soc. Quart .
Journ. vol. v. p. 265 ; Gerhardt , 'Traite , ' vol. iv .
p. 80 ) , and supposed by him to be hydrate of meconin ( Opianyl , Anderson ) , may have been cotarnic acid , with the composition of which Anderson 's analyses closely agree , as shown by the following comparison : Calculated .

V. Conclusion .
In the absence of more definite knowledge of the constitution of meconin and opianic and hemipinic acids , it is obviously useless to try to assign a rational formula to narcotine .
According to the fotmulee which we have adopted for narcotine and cotarnine , narcotine contains the elements of cotarnine and meconin : C22 H23 N07= C12 H13 NO3 + C10 HO 04 .
Narcotine .
Cotarnine .
Meconin .
It will be seen that these formulae are the same as those of the methyl-narcotine and methyl-cotarnine of Hinterberger and Wertheim .
e The ground upon which Wertheim admitted the existence of ethyland propyl-narcotine was the formation of volatile bases containing C2 H7 N and C3 HI N by the distillation of narcotine with potash .
An experiment which we have made goes some way towards explaining the formation of these bases without assuming the existence of more than one variety of narcotine .
Having so frequently observed the formation of methyl-compounds from the derivatives of narcotine , we tried the direct action of hydriodic acid on this base , expecting to obtain iodide of methyl .
By distilling 20 grms. of narcotine with concentrated hydriodic acid , 19 grms. of pure iodide of methyl were obtained , a quantity which corresponds , as nearly as could be expected , with three atoms of iodide of methyl for one atom of narcotinei ' , ( C2 HI23 NO7 : 3CH3I : : 413 : 436 or 20 : 21i1 ) .
Narcotine therefore contains three atoms of methyl so combined as to be easily separable t ; and it is very probable that when it is distilled with potash , according to the conditions of the experiment , sometimes nearly pure ammonia is evolved , while , at other times , methylamine , CH5 N , dimethylamine , C2 H7 N , or trimethylamine , C3 H9 N , predominates .
We wish not to close without acknowledging our obligation to Dr. M. Holzmann for very valuable assistance rendered to us at the commencement of our investigation .
* It is possible that narcotine will prove to be an economical , as it is certainly the most convenient , source of iodide of methyl .
t Gerhardt ( Trait6 , iv .
64 ) had previously observed the production of a volatile substance , which he supposed to be nitrate of ethyl or of methyl , by the action of nitric acid on narcotine .
