Introduction .
The spectrum of c Cephei is one of a group with special characteristics .
While containing a great number of fine metallic lines , giving it more or less the same general appearance as the solar spectrum , it shows many lines which are either faint in the solar spectrum or are altogether absent .
In a former paper* I showed that the spectrum is practically identical with that of 7 Cygni , which my previous work had indicated to be a star of increasing temperature.t The chief argument which I had employed in favour of placing 7 Cygni on the ascending"side of the temperature curve was based on the presence of certain special lines , which occur with increased importance , in the spectrum of cl Cygni , which differs very widely from the solar spectrum , and has a close relationship to the Orion stars .
Further , the association of a special kind of variability with some of the stars having a spectrum of this type seemed to strengthen the view that the constitution of such stars must be vastly different from that of the sun .
Dr. Yogel , however , has classified two stars of the same group as c Cephei , namely^ \gt ; / Aquiloe and 10 Sagittae , * ' Roy .

Mr. J. Norman Lockyer .
with the sun in his Class Ila , and more recently Dr. Scheiner has placed another star of the group .
, a Persei , between \#171 ; Oygni and the sun .
It is right to add that Drs. Yogel and Scheiner differ very considerably as to the classification of a Cygni , and this still further complicates matters .
It will be seen that the question between the two classifications is a very sharp one .
Is the difference between stars like Cephei and stars resembling the sun solely due to a temperature difference , as it is on Vogel 's view , or does it in part represent , as I contend , a physical difference between the two classes , since on my view stars like 6 Cephei consist of uncondensed swarms of meteorites of increasing temperature , while those like the sun are masses of vapour in which there are photospheres and relatively quiet atmospheres ?
Since the work recently communicated to the Royal Society enables me to go still further forward , I propose to discuss in the present paper the points relating to the classification of stars of the 8 Cephei class .
In Vogel 's classification all stars are regarded as cooling bodies , while one of the chief points of mine is the distinction between stars which are getting hotter and those which are becoming cooler .
Thus , while stars like \#163 ; Cephei and those like the sun are grouped together by Vogel in his Class ILz , they are in mine divided into two groups , Croup III including 8 Cephei and Group V the sun .
When I first suggested the new classification I fully recognised the difficulty of separating Groups III and V. Thus I wrote in 1888:\#151 ; " With our present knowledge , it is very difficult to separate those stars the grouping of which is determined by line absorption into Groups III and V , for the reason that so far , seeing that only one line of temperature , and that a descending one , has been considered , no efforts have been made to establish the necessary criteria."* In the following year I gave the results of some visual observations of stellar spectra which seemed to justify the separation of the stars with line spectra into two groups , and to suggest the necessary criteria for distinguishing them.f Soon after this a photographic investigation of stellar spectra was commenced at Kensington , and as a result of that work the conclusions at which I had arrived from a discussion of the eye observations were confirmed .
The additional details shown by the photographs enabled me to extend the classification given in 1888.J * ' Roy .

On the Classification of Stars the 8 Cephei Class .
44 ( Stars resembling 7 Cygni formed the sub-group III/ 3 .
In November , 1895 , I gave an account* of the spectra of five short period variable stars , 0 Cephei , 7 Aquilee , \#163 ; Geminorum , T Vul-peculse , and S Sagittse , and pointed out that these belonged to the same sub-group as 7 Cygni , which , however , is not a variable star ; \#171 ; Ursse Minoris has also a spectrum which has since been recognised to be identical with that of 7 Cygni and 0 Cephei , while a Persei differs so slightly from them that it may also be classified with them .
These I now group together , and for convenience of reference I designate them the 0 Cephei class .
Dr. Vogel 's Classification .
Only two of the stars which have been mentioned as belonging to the h Cephei class , namely , 7 Aquilas and S(10 ) Sagittae , were included in Vogel 's spectroscopic D , published in 1883 , and both are classed without further comment as stars of Class Ila.f This type of spectrum was thus defined : " Spectra with very numerous metallic lines , which are easily known by their intensity , especially in the yellow and green .
The hydrogen lines are for the most part strong , but are never so broad as in the case of Class I In some stars the lines of hydrogen are faint , and in these faint bands can be generally recognised in the less refrangible portion of the spectrum .
" So far as Vogel 's classification serves as a guide , then , all the stars of the 0 Cephei class would be classed with the sun .
Dr. Scheiner has discussed one of the stars of the 0 Cephei class , a Persei , in some detail .
J Attention is specially drawn by him to the differences between the spectrum of Persei and that of the sun .
In the following table I have brought together the lines of a Persei which Dr. Scheiner states to be more intense than in the sun , and have compared them with 0 Cephei and a. Cygni as photographed at Kensington .
The remarks in the last column are those made by Dr. Scheiner with regard to the spectrum of a Persei .

It will be seen that the special lines of Persei are nearly all present in 8 Cephei and a Cygni , and that they are all either faint in , or absent from , the solar spectrum .

On the Classification of Stars of the 8 Class .
449 lines which are strongly marked in the spectrum of Cephei as compared with corresponding lines in the solar spectrum photographed with the same instrument , A discussion of these differences shows that the more special lines of b Cephei , like those of a. Persei , are very prominent in nc Cygni .
In spite of these differences , Dr. Schemer classes a Persei with stars like the sun , but regards it as a transition stage between aC)gni and the sun .
He says : " From the general conclusions , the above list gives us quite a curious and important result .
If one compares these lines with those in the spectrum of a Cygni , which is of special interest as an advanced spectrum of Class 16 , one finds that , out of sixty lines in a Cygni , twenty-one occur in the list , and all of these in a Persei .
The fact , therefore , remains that nearly half the lines which in the spectrum of a Persei show divergences when compared with the solar spectrum appear certainly in any case in the spectrum of a Cygni and determine its peculiarity .
" Now a Cygni belongs to Class 16 , a Persei to Class IIu , and the plausible conclusion appears to me , therefore , that % Persei had pie-viously a spectrum similar to that of a Cygni , and that in this case we have the missing connexion between 16 to Ila .
" * The spectrum of a Tauri , which , as I shall show , must be regarded as a condensing swarm , closely resembles that of the sun ; so that Dr. Schemer 's evidence would equally place a Persei intermediate between a Tauri and a Cygni .
Difficulties connected wGlassification .
The close association of stars like b Cephei with those like a. Cygni makes it here important to discuss the place of a Cygni in \ogel s classification .
With regard to this star Dr. Scheiner writes : Ihe spectrum of a Cygni , in spite of the large number of its lines , has no resemblance with that of the sun .
While it is possible to identify most , of the lines with solar lines in respect of their position , yet the total lack of agreement as to intensity of the lines makes many of these identifications worthless .
" f Dr. Scheiner has classified ol Cygni in Vogel 's Class 16 , which was thus defined in Vogel 's original classification : " Spectra in which the metallic lines are few in number , and very faint or entirely imperceptible , and in which the hydrogen lines are lacking .
In view of the photographic results obtained at Potsdam , the last clause in this definition was corrected in 1888 , so that it reads : " and the strong hydrogen lines of Type la are lacking .
" J This has again been modified by Dr. Scheiner , and the characteristics of * ' Potsdam Observations , ' vol. 7 , Part II , p. 331 .

Mr. J. Norman Loekyer Type 16 are stated as " spectra in which the hydrogen lines and the few metallic lines all appear to be of equal breadth and of sharp definition."* It is on the ground of this greatly modified definition that a Cygni is included with stars like Rigel in Class 16 .
Dr. Vogel , however , is not prepared to accept Dr. Scheiner 's amended definition of Class 16 .
He writes : " However justifiable it may be to regard the peculiarly sharp spectral lines of the stars above mentioned and a few others of the same kind as worthy of special consideration , the adoption of this proposal would make it necessary to separate a number of stars ( including those of Orion ) whose relationship is placed beyond all question by the investigations I have referred to , and to place them with a , Cygni , which has a materially different spectrum .
" f In the same paper Dr. Vogel brings forward a new definition of his Class 16 in the following terms : " Spectra in which , besides the still dominant hydrogen lines , the lines of cleveite gas appear , and above all the lines X 4026 , X 4472 , X 5016 , and X5876(D3 ) .
The lines of calcium , magnesium , sodium , and iron are also more or less numerous in spectra of this subdivision .
" This new definition excludes a Cygni from Class 16 in Dr. Vogel 's opinion , and he places this star in Class la 3 of his extended classification of spectra of the first class .
This sub-class is thus defined : " Spectra in which the calcium line X3934 has nearly the same intensity as the hydrogen lines .
In occasional instances it is still sharply defined at the edges , or it may be broader and more intense than the hydrogen lines , and very diffuse , forming with the hydrogen line He(X3970 ) , which is greatly intensified and broadened by the calcium line X 3969 , a conspicuous pair .
" In the spectra of this division the lines of the cleveite gas cannot be recognised ; on the other hand , numerous strong lines of different metals , particularly lines of iron , are always present .
The lines of hydrogen are still always dominant .
Hs is plainly apparent among the other lines , and the group Gr is less conspicuous than Hy .
This subdivision forms the direct connecting link with the spectral class II , in which the hydrogen lines no longer play a prominent part in comparison with the lines of other metals."J According to this definition , a. Cygni is classed with Procyon , a star which in the main resembles the sun , and this notwithstanding Scheiner 's remark that the spectrum of a Cygni bears no resemblance to that of the sun .
It is clear , then , that oc .
Cygni cannot be classified satisfactorily on the supposition that all stars are cooling .

On the Classification of Stars of the 8 Class .
451 Reference to the Old Evidence of Two Series .
the occurrence of radiating carbon vapour is an indication that these stars , like comets , consist of uncondensed swarms of meteorites .
Since the temperature of a condensing swarm of meteorites must be increasing , in accordance with thermodynamical principles , stais like oc Orionis must he placed on the ascending arm of the temperature curve .
The photographs show that the spectrum of stars like a Tauri is almost identical with that of a Orionis so far as the lines are concerned , and since one of the flutings in the red in the specti um of a Orionis also appears in a Tauri , this star must also be regarded as one of increasing temperature .
The discussion of the Kensington photographs led me to place 7 Cygni next to a Tauri in the series of stars with increasing temperature , ^ and we now know^ that ^ Oephei must be classed w^ith this star .
I pointed out that the spectrum of 7 Cygni " has much in common with that of ol Tauri , but there is less continuous absoiptlon , and many of the lines of at .
Tauri thin out .
The next step to % Cygni is rather a long one , but it seems very probable that if more photographs were available intermediate spectra would be found .
Tt will be seen , however , that in a Cygni the hydrogen lines are intensified as compared with 7 Cygni , and that all the important lines of a Cygni agree in position with prominent lines in 7 Cygni ... .In passing to Rigel the more important lines of a Cygni are retained , and a few new lines make their appearance .
" My argument was , then , that with an increase of temperature a star like a. Tauri would develop into one like Cephei , which , with further increase , would pass through successive stages represented by a Cygni , Rigel , and Bellatrix .
To justify this it is accordingly necessary to show greater reason for associating 8 Cephei with a Taui-i than with a star like the sun , which we know on other grounds to be cooling .
From the great similarity of the line spectra of a. Tauri and the sun , it is clear that the argument will not entirely depend upon the identity of lines in the spectra of ol Tauri and d Cephei , but upon general and specific differences between Cephei and the sun .
In previous communications to the Royal Society I have stated the idence which shows that in stars of Group II , such as a Orionis , Evidence from , Enhanced Lines .

metals has enabled me to apply new criteria in the classification of stellar spectra .
A study of these lines shows at once that 8 Cephei is hotter than either a. Tauri or the sun , and that the difference between its spectrum and that of a , Tauri or the sun iis certainly in part due to this difference of temperature of the absorbing vapours .
The lines which are stronger in 8 Cephei than in the sun include many of those which have been found to be enhanced in the spark spectra of metals , so that they are no longer to be regarded as unknown lines .
Similarly , many of the lines of a. Cygni for which no origins could previously be assigned have been shown to be lines of common metals under conditions of high temperature .
Still , the mere presence of the enhanced lines in a star spectrum affords us no criterion as to whether the temperature of a star is increasing or decreasing .
But I have also shown that if we take the relative intensities of the enhanced lines and the arc lines as an indication of stellar temperatures , and in this way bring together a sufficient number of stars ctf about the same temperature as 7 Cygni or 8 Cephei , such spectra may be divided into two well-marked gi'oups , of which 7 Cygni and Castor may be taken as types .
The chief generic differences between the two groups of stars at the temperature of 8 Cephei were thus summarised in the paper to which reference has been made :\#151 ; 8 Cephei .
( 1 ) Considerable absorption in ultra-violet .
( 2 ) Hydrogen lines relatively thin .
( 3 ) Metallic lines of moderate intensity .
Castor .
( 1 ) Very little continuous absorption in ultra-violet .
( 2 ) Hydrogen lines relatively very thick .
( 3 ) Metallic lines relatively feeble .
I further showed that these differences are simply and sufficiently explained on the supposition that stars like 7 Cygni and 8 Cephei are uncondensed swarms of meteorites , while those like Castor , which ha ve about the same mean temperature , are stars approaching the condition of the sun in which photospheres and relatively quiescent atmospheres have formed .
The foregoing considerations indicate that there are three chief periods in the history of a star during its stages of luminosity :\#151 ; ( 1 ) A period during which it exists as an uncondensed swarm , when the " atmosphere " is disturbed by meteoritic bombardment from without .
At this stage the atmosphere is a mass of heterogeneous vapour at various temperatures and moving with different velocities in different regions .
On the Classification of Stars of the 8 Cephei Class .
453 ( 2 ) A period of complete vaporisation during which the atmosphere is quiescent , bombardment having ceased , and the radiation being too great to permit condensation in the atmosphere .
( 3 ) A period of cooling during which the atmosphere is disturbed by the fall of condensation products from the outer parts of the atmosphere on to the photosphere .
Evidence that we are not dealing with Composite Spectra .
Many of the lines in the spectra of stars of the S Cephei class coincide with prominent lines in the spectrum of a Cygni , but it is true that many also coincide with lines in the spectra of stars like a. Orionis and Arcturus , which closely resemble the solar spectrum .
It seemed possible , therefore , that we might be dealing with the integrated spectra of two stars in close proximity , one having lines resembling those of a Orionis or Arcturus , and the other those of a Cygni .
The spectra of all the stars of this sub-group have accordingly been very carefully investigated from this point of view .
Enlarged glass positives of a Cygni and Arcturus on exactly the same scale have been superposed , and the integrated spectra photographed .
When this integrated spectrum is compared with 7 Cygni or 5 Cephei , there is a considerable similarity , but the relative intensities of the various lines and the general appearance of certain parts of the spectrum , especially about G , are quite different .
Again , if there were two bright bodies physically connected in such a star as 7 Cygni there must be a revolution and a consequent doubling of the common lines , unless the plane of movement were perpendicular to the line of sight .
Ho signs of such doubling , however , have been detected in any of the eight stars of the sub-group which have so far been recognised , and it is quite improbable that the plane of revolution would be at right angles to the line of sight in every case , and still more so that the two components would have identical spectra in each of the eight systems .
Spectra of the S Cephei type must , therefore , be taken to represent a particular stage in the orderly development of cosmical bodies .
Evidence from Variability .
Further evidence in favour of placing stars like $ Cephei and 7 Cygni on the ascending arm of the temperature curve is afforded by the fact that stars of this class present a special form of variability .
This variability is similar in kind , but different in degree , to that associated with stars of Group II , such as Mira .
The following table shows that the amount of variation is very much less than that in variables of the Mira type:\#151 ; 454 On the Classification of Stars of the 8 Cephei Class .

A constitution more or less similar to that of the Mira class is therefore indicated .
I have already shown that in such variables as Mira the presence of bright carbon flutings indicates a meteoritic structure.* Here the variation has a much longer period than in Cephei , but it is only necessary to suppose that 8 Cephei is more condensed , so that revolving swarms of short period will be alone effective in producing collisions at periastron , as I pointed out in 1889.f A recent discussion of all the available observations of rj Aquilse by Dr. William J. S. Lockyer| has shown that the light curve of this variable can be best explained on the supposition of three meteor swarms moving around their centre of gravity .
In this way not only is the general form of the light curve satisfied , but the smaller irregularities discovered by the author are also easily accounted for .
Hence , by placing stars of the 8 Cephei class on the ascending arm of the temperature curve , the variability of certain members of the group finds a ready explanation .
I am not aware of any satisfactory explanation of the 8 Cephei type of variability in which a constitution resembling that of the sun is assumed , and to my mind such a variation in a star constituted like the sun is impossible .

455 General Conclusions .
The final result of the discussion of the spectra of stars of the \#163 ; Cephei class is to show that they must be placed on the ascending arm of the temperature curve , at a stage higher than stars like a Tauri , in which the mean temperature is not very different from that of the sun .
Stars of equal temperature on the descending side of the curve , of which Castor may be taken as a type , show precisely the same lines , the enhanced and cool lines having the same relative intensities , but with inverted intensities of the hydrogen and metallic lines , and with somewhat less continuous absorption in the ultra-violet .
The difference between stars like b Cephei and those of the sun is therefore partly due to a difference of temperature and partly due to a difference of physical condition such as is demanded by the meteoritic hypothesis .
This result enables us to understand why some members of the b Cephei class should show such a very special kind of variability .
a Cygni also finds a natural place on the ascending arm of the temperature curve , at a stage higher than b Cephei , and all the difficulties met with iu attempting to classify it on Yogel 's view of decreasing temperature alone are removed .

In a paper recently communicated to the Royal Society " On Lunar Periodicity in Earthquake Frequency , " Mr. C. G. Knott gave some results , from which he argued that a real connexion between tidal effects and earthquakes probably existed .
These results are based on a method which has frequently been employed .
The records of earthquakes are grouped together and expressed by means of a Fourier series , and conclusions are based on the greater or smaller values of the coefficients of this series .
In order to decide what value is to be attached to such investigations , it seems necessary iu the first instance to discuss what would be the order of magnitude of the coefficients , on the supposition that the events have happened perfectly at i-andom without any connecting law .
It is the object of this paper to solve this question , and to apply the solution to the periodicities which are supposed to exist in the frequency of earthquakes .
