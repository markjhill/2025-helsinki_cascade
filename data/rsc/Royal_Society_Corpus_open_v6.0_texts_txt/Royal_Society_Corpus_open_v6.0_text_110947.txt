" Description of a Method of Registering Magnetic Variations .
" By Charles Brooke , Esq. , M.B. Communicated by G. B. Airy , Esq. , F.R.S. A vertical stream of light issuing through a slit in the copper tube of a camphine lamp , is reflected by a concave mirror fixed vertically on the axis of a suspended magnet , and condensed into a focus by a cylindrical lens placed at the distance of about seven feet from the mirror .
The luminous image , which shifts its position according to the movements of the magnet , but to a much greater extent , impinges on highly sensitive photographic paper , wxound round a horizontal cylinder , which is made , by a watch movement , to revolve once in twelve hours .
Thus , by a combination of the vertical movement of the paper with the horizontal movement of the image , the magnetic curve of variation is distinctly portrayed and registered .
