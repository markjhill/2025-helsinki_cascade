The observations 1low referred to were conducted with an pparatus igned upon the same lilles as that already desoribed . .
It must suffice to mention that only importaIlt modification lay the fact that the two single volumes , which , wheIl employed together , colIstitute the double volume , were used separately and alternately , so as to eliminate io each set of measurements any question as to what the of these volnmes exactly is .
It is hoped to give a full of the method when it has been extended to the examination of other , such nitrous oxide and carbonic anhydride .
The temperatures rarlged from , and care was taken that in each nteasurement the mean temperatures be almost exactly the same for the and the double volume .
The results were reduced mnch as previously explained , and give the of , which , according to Boylc 's la shonld be lity , Oxygen 1 00040 Hydrogen Nitrogen rbonic oxide 1 00028 hcre denotes the qnotient of the value of ) at the half the rebponcfing value at the wholc atmosphere .
