216 Introduction .
It was stated by Cathcart ( 4 ) and Benedict and Myers ( 2 ) independently , in 1907 , that creatine was excreted in the urine during inanition .
Cathcart ( 5 ) has further stated that the output of creatine , caused by fasting for 36 hours , is diminished as soon as a diet consisting of carbohydrates is taken , whereas it is increased by a fat diet .
Rose and Mendel ( 19 ) confirm these results , laying great stress on the fact that carbohydrates play a very important role in preventing the excretion of creatine in the urine .
In the course of a 10 days ' experiment on one of us ( G. G. , 10 ) , where the diet was restricted to protein and fat and was of insufficient calorie value , we found that no creatine was excreted in the urine .
The explanation of this discrepancy was not fully investigated at that time , but recent work by Greenwald ( 12 ) has suggested a possible explanation .
Folin 's ( 8 ) method for the estimation of creatinine in urine depends on the orange colour produced by the addition of picric acid and soda ( Jafffi , 15 ) .
This colour has been shown to be due to a reducing action of the creatinine on the picric acid ( Chapman , 6 ) .
Among the reducing substances which also give a similar colour are acetone , aceto-acetic acid , and / 3-oxybutyric acid , all of which may be present in urine under different conditions .
Van Hoogenhuyze and Verploegh ( 13 ) and Krause ( 16 ) stated that urine to which acetone had been added produced , with picric acid and soda , a VOL LXXXVII.\#151 ; B. Q 206 Messrs. G. Graham and E. P. Poulton .
Alleged slightly darker colour than was obtained with the urine alone , hut that the colour soon faded and caused no error in the determination of creatinine .
Krause ( 16 ) , Wolf and Osterberg ( 22 ) , and Rose ( 20 ) found that the addition of the ethyl ester of aceto-acetic acid to urine did not produce any error in the estimation of creatinine , unless large amounts ( ie .
over 1 per cent. ) were added .
They seem to have assumed that the action of aceto-acetic acid would be the same as that of the ester .
Recently , however , Greenwald ( 12 ) , working on diabetic urines , has shown that if aceto-acetic acid is added to urine directly a considerable error is introduced into the estimation of creatinine .
This observation may possibly explain why we did not find any creatine in our experiment on the fat diet .
Pol in ( 8 ) originally stated that acetone and aceto-acetic acid gave the orange colour with picric acid and soda , but remarked that they could easily be removed from the urine .
In our experiment we removed the aceto-acetic acid as far as possible from the urine before making the estimation , in order to get rid of any disturbing effect that the acetone bodies might have on the creatinine figures .
In the experiments described in this paper we have studied this question in greater detail and also the means of overcoming the difficulty .
I. The Effect of Aceto-acetic Acid on the Estimation of Creatinine .
The different intensities of colour produced by / 3-oxybutyric acid , acetone , aceto-acetic ester and aceto-acetie acid when treated with picric acid and soda were first investigated .
The importance of aceto-acetic acid is emphasised by the experiments of Arnold ( 1 ) , Emden ( 7 ) , and Hurtley ( 14 ) .
These investigators have , independently , pointed out that in cases of acidosis the fresh urine contains only small amounts of acetone , while aceto-acetic acid may be present in large amounts .
Throughout our experiments the estimation of the creatinine was performed in the usual way ; 15 c.c. of a saturated solution of picric acid and 5 c.c. of 10-per-cent , caustic soda were added to 10 c.c. of urine , the mixture was allowed to stand for seven instead of five minutes , and then diluted to 500 c.c. with water .
Folin ( 8 ) stated that the maximum intensity of colour occurs in five to nine minutes after mixing .
We have always waited seven minutes because we found that five minutes was not always sufficient if the urine was slightly diluted , as occurs in the estimation of the creatinine + creatine by this method .
The matching was done with a Duboscq colorimeter against an N/ 2 potassium bichromate solution .
All the matching was done by E. P. P. while the scale was read by G. G. , six Excretion of Creatine in Carbohydrate Starvation .
207 to eight readings were made and the mean was taken .
The total nitrogen was estimated by KjeldahTs method .
The aceto-acetic acid + acetone was estimated by the Messinger-Huppert method .
The substances tested were prepared in the following manner , and we wish to thank Dr. Hurtley for very kindly supplying us with them .
The / 3-oxybutyric acid was extracted from urine and the strength of the solution was accurately known ; the solution was nearly colourless .
The acetone was chemically pure .
The ethyl ester of aceto-acetic acid was obtained by distilling the pure commercial ester under reduced pressure , and the product boiled constantly at the correct boiling point for the pure substance .
The aceto-acetic acid was obtained from the ester , which was hydrolysed by adding the theoretical amount of normal caustic soda , and allowing it to stand at the room temperature for 36 hours , when the hydrolysis was complete .
It will be seen that the solution used consisted of the sodium salt of aceto-acetic acid and an equivalent amount of ethyl alcohol .
The mixture was diluted and the amount of acetone present was determined by Folin 's method ( 9 ) .
The amount of aceto-acetic acid corresponding to the acetone present was deducted from the theoretical amount of aceto-acetic acid in order to get the correct value for the aceto-acetic acid .
The aceto-acetic acid was kept in an ice chest in order to prevent its decomposition , and was tested from time to time by means of the Folin and Messinger-Huppert methods .
/ 3-oxybutyric acid , acetone , the ethyl ester and the sodium salt of aceto-acetic acid all give an orange colour when treated alone with picric acid and soda , but on dilution the solution is much paler than the usual colour obtained with urine under these conditions .
These substances were then added to urine in varying concentrations , and the colour produced by the addition of picric acid and soda was compared with the colour produced by the urine alone with the picric acid and soda , without the addition of these substances .
The addition of / 3-oxybutyric acid produces practically no alteration in the colour obtained by adding picric acid and soda to urine .
Thus when added to the urine ( Table 1 ) in amounts corresponding to 0'036 grm. per 100 c.c. and 1 grm. per 100 c.c. it caused no error at all in the creatinine determination .
When present in amounts corresponding to a 2T6-per-cent .
solution it made the colour slightly lighter , causing a difference of 0'27 mm. scale reading , which is almost within the limit of accuracy of the method .
The amounts of the / 3-oxybutyric acid added are quite comparable with those found in the urine in diabetes , and as the error caused even by large amounts is so small its effect may be safely neglected .

A 1-per-cent , solution makes the colour lighter than usual , while if the acetone is present in larger amounts the colour becomes much lighter and it fades very rapidly on standing .
As acetone is excreted in urine in very small amounts the creatinine determinations will not be affected , as a 0T7-per-cent .
solution caused no error .
These results do not agree with those of van Hoogenhuyze and Verploegh ( 13 ) and Krause ( 16 ) , who found that a 1-per-cent , acetone solution made the colour darker , but that the error disappeared on standing .
Aceto-acetic ethyl ester when present in small quantities produces a slight lightening of the colour .
Thus a 01- and 0'75-per-cent , solution causes an error in the scale reading of 0'2 and IT mm. Larger amounts , on the other hand , cause a darkening effect , but the colour becomes much redder than usual , which makes it really impossible to match it with the N/ 2 bichromate solution .
These results agree with those obtained by Krause ( 16 ) , Wolf and Osterberg ( 22 ) , and Rose ( 20 ) .
This experiment is not of much practical importance , as the ethyl ester is never excreted in urine , but we have made Excretion of Creatine in Carbohydrate Starvation .
209 it because other observers have added this substance to urine instead of aceto-acetic acid .
The sodium salt of aceto-acetic acid produces a much more marked effect than the other acetone bodies .
Even when added to urine in small , amounts the colour obtained with picric acid and soda is not darker , as stated by Krause ( 16 ) and others , but is actually lighter , and when present in large amounts the colour is very much lighter ( Table II and fig. 1 ) .
The error is not eliminated on standing but increases .

The error produced by larger amounts is very striking , for if the concentration is increased to 0374 per cent , the error is as great as 0'061 grm. , and the percentage error in this case is 52-6 per cent. As amounts of aceto-acetic acid up to a concentration of 0'4 per eent .
may be excreted in diabetes , the error caused in such cases must be very great .
If the error in the creatinine determination be plotted against the concentration of the aceto-acetic acid the resulting curve is almost a straight line ( fig. 1 ) .
The chemistry of this action is at present engaging our attention .
It was not possible to isolate the pure acid and add it to urine , but this does not matter , as the aceto-acetic acid is excreted in the urine partly as the free acid and partly as a salt .
Moreover , in the process of estimating the creatinine an excess of caustic soda is added , and this must convert all the free acid into the sodium salt .
The solution of sodium aceto-acetate used in our experiments also contained 0-37 grm. ethyl alcohol to 1 grm. of aceto-acetic acid .
The presence of ethyl alcohol in the sodium aceto-acetate solution ( due to its mode of preparation from aceto-aeetic ethyl ester ) is a possible disturbing 210 Messrs. G. Graham and E. P. Poulton .
Alleged factor , as it might be the cause of the colour change .
However , the addition of alcohol to urine in amounts which correspond to those added with the sodium aceto-acetate did not produce any alteration at all in the colour .
The possibility still remained that it was the mixture of the alcohol with the sodium aceto-acetate which was responsible for the change in colour .
There is no means of directly disproving this hypothesis , as the alcohol cannot be removed from the sodium aceto-acetate solution without destroying the salt .
There is , however , indirect proof that this is not the case , as will be shown in the following paragraphs .
Aceto-acetic acid is excreted in the urine during carbohydrate starvation .
As will be shown later on , the aceto-acetic acid can easily be removed from the urine without breaking down creatinine or creatine , and this procedure was followed in three diet experiments which will be described in detail later on .
The urine which contained aceto-acetic acid had apparently less creatinine in it than the urine from which the aceto-acetic acid had been removed .
Thus on the 2nd day Experiment I , a concentration of aceto-acetic acid of 0'065 per cent. , caused an error in the creatinine figure of 0 017 grm. per 100 c.c. , and a concentration of aceto-acetic acid of 0081 per cent , on the third day caused an error in the creatine of 0 028 grm. per 100 c.c. On the second and third days of Experiment II the concentration of aceto-acetic acid of 0'085 and 0112 per cent , produced errors of 0'018 and 0D27 grm. per 100 e.c. respectively ( Table III ) .

It must be remembered that the figure for the concentration of the aceto-acetic acid in the diet experiments was obtained by the Messinger-Huppert method , which makes no distinction between acetone and aceto-acetic acid .
It is true that acetone is only present in urine in small amounts , but in considering the effect of the aceto-acetic acid some allowance should be made for the amount of acetone present .
A diminution in the concentration of the aceto-acetic acid would make the points below the curve more nearly approximate to the curve but would displace the point above the curve away from the curve .
The general agreement between the errors produced by aceto-acetic acid in these experiments , and the errors produced when sodium aceto-acetate containing ethyl alcohol is added to urine , point to the conclusion that it is the aceto-acetic acid itself and not the alcohol that causes the errors , in the latter case .
Our experiments agree with those of Greenwald and show that the aceto- 212 Messrs. G. Graham and E. P. Poulton .
Alleged acetic acid produces a considerable error in the estimation of creatinine , so that the result obtained is too low .
II .
A Method for Removing Aceto-acetic Acid from Urine Preliminary to the Estimation of Creatinine .
In Folin 's method for estimating the creatinine + creatine , the creatine is converted into creatinine by heating on a water-bath for three hours with normal hydrochloric acid .
This procedure removes all the aceto-acetic acid from the urine by converting it into acetone , which is distilled away .
Thus the aceto-acetic acid could not be detected by Rothera 's ( 21)* nitroprusside test after one hour 's heating .
Consequently the estimation of the creatinine + creatine will not be disturbed by the presence of any aceto-acetic acid and will be accurate , but the result of the creatinine estimation which is carried out in the presence of aceto-acetic acid will be too low .
Consequently the result obtained for the creatinine + creatine will be higher than that for the creatinine and will lead to the conclusion that creatine is present in the urine whether this is actually the case or not .
The aceto-acetic acid must , therefore , be removed from the urine before the determinations are made .
Greenwald ( 12 ) extracted the urine with ether for two hours and found that the aceto-acetic acid was all removed by that process ; the ether was subsequently removed by aeration for one hour .
This process involved some dilution of the urine and in order to get over this difficulty Greenwald added twice the amount of picric acid and soda .
This method takes some time to carry out and in our experience it is better if possible to avoid all dilution of the urine , especially when the urine is dilute to begin with , in order to get correct results .
The method which we employed ( 10 ) is very much simpler and we have now tested it carefully and modified it slightly ( 11 ) .
1 c.c. of 10-per-cent , phosphoric acid is added to 10 c.c. of urine in a boiling tube 200 mm. long and 30 mm. wide .
The mixture is then heated in a water-bath of which the temperature is between 65 ' and 70 ' C. and at a pressure of about 210 mm. of mercury produced by means of a filter pump .
Bumping is prevented by allowing air to bubble slowly through the liquid by means of a capillary tube dipping into it .
The temperature must not rise above 70 ' 0 .
nor the pressure fall below 210 mm. or else concentration of the urine takes place .
If the above directions are followed only a few drops of liquid are distilled over into the receiver , as the result of three-quarters of an hour 's distillation .
At the end of this time the process is stopped and the solution * Bothera 's test has been shown by Hurtley(14 ) to be a test for aceto-aeetic acid as well as for acetone .

213 cooled .
The mixture in the boiling tube is neutralised with 1*5 c.c. of 10-per-cent , soda* and then 15 c.c. of saturated picric acid and 5 c.c. of the soda are added .
The mixture is allowed to stand seven minutes and then the contents of the boiling tube are washed into a 500 c.c. flask and diluted up to 500 c.c. with water .
By heating for three-quarters of an hour , the aceto-acetic .
acid can be completely removed even if it is present in a concentration of 0-2 per cent. If the concentration of aceto-acetic acid is greater than 0'2 per cent. , the distillation must be continued for a longer time , and the complete removal of the aceto-acetic acid must be ascertained by testing a control with Rothera 's nitroprusside test .
We have continued the distillation for one and a half hours , and find that no error in the creatine estimation occurred .
We have tested the method in the following manner .
The amount of creatinine in a normal urine was determined , and aceto-acetic acid was then added in varying amounts to the urine , and the creatinine again estimated .
The aceto-acetic acid was then removed by the distillation method , and the creatinine again estimated .
The results obtained show that the distillation did not break up any of the creatinine , and that the aceto-acetic acid was completely removed ( Table IY ) .
Table IY shows that the Error caused by Varying Concentrations of Aceto-acetic Acid in the Urine is completely removed by the Distillation Method . !

Alleged and the creatinine was then determined by Folin 's method and by the distillation method .
The creatine was then converted into creatinine by heating on the water-bath for three and a half hours or longer with 5 c.c. normal hydrochloric acid , in older to get the creatinine + creatine figure .
These experiments show that in no case was any creatine converted into creatinine by the distillation , even when ( Experiment 5 ) there was actually more creatine ( 0152 grm. ) than creatinine ( 0119 grm. ) in the urine ( Table Y ) .
In the first three experiments , when creatine was present in small amounts , practically all the creatine added to the urine was converted into creatinine by heating for three and a half hours on the water-bath .
In the fourth experiment , when 0-076 grm. of creatine was present in the urine , only 48 per cent , of the creatine was converted into creatinine after three and a half hours , and even after five and a half hours only 89 per cent , could be recovered .
In the fifth experiment , with a very large amount of creatine ( 0-152 grm. per 100 c.c. ) , only 28 per cent , was converted after heating for three and a half hours .

Benedict and Myers ( 3 ) have also noticed that the water-bath method gave an incomplete result , when urine containing 0'066 grm. creatine per 100 c.c. was used .
Mellanby ( 18 ) has pointed out that five hours ' heating on the water-bath is usually necessary to get a complete conversion .
However , our observations show that three and a half hours on the waterExcretion of Creatine in Ca Starvation .
215 bath is sufficient to estimate accurately small amounts of creatine up to 0034 grm. per 100 c.c. , but that a greater quantity than this cannot be converted quantitatively into creatinine in three and a half hours .
Larger amounts than 0 034 grm. per 100 c.c. must be heated for more than three and a half hours , and it is very difficult , even so , to convert all the creatine into creatinine .
As the greatest amount of creatine found by Cathcart(5 ) in a case of carbohydrate starvation was 0*38 grm. per day , three and a half hours ' heating on a water-bath would be quite sufficient to convert practically all the creatine , that might be present in the urine , into creatinine .
Finally , to test the accuracy of the distillation method , we have employed it for urines containing both creatine and aceto-acetic acid in solution together ( Table VI ) .
In one experiment creatine was added to normal urine , and the estimations were carried out with and without the addition of aceto-acetic acid .
In the second experiment the creatine was added to part of the urine of the third day of the diet experiment ( Table VIII ) .
In this case the urine already contained aceto-acetic acid .
The results ( Table VI ) show that , even when both aceto-acetic acid and creatine are present at the same time , the aceto-acetic acid can be removed from the urine without breaking up the creatine , and that the creatine , if present in small amount , can be converted almost quantitatively into creatinine after three and a half hours ' heating .
The series of control experiments shows that the distillation method gives satisfactory results .

Alleged In the examination of any urine which contains aceto-acetic acid , and which is thought to contain creatine , two estimations are required , namely , that of the total creatinine + creatine by the original Folin method , and that of the creatinine alone by the method given in this paper .
III .
The Alleged Excretion of Creatine on a Carbohydrate-free Diet .
It is well known that the consumption of a diet containing no carbohydrates produces acidosis , with the excretion of / 3-oxybutyric acid , aceto-acetic acid , and acetone .
The aceto-acetic acid will cause an error in estimating creatinine and creatine , and must be removed to get accurate results .
We have performed three diet experiments on three separate individuals , and have investigated the creatinine and creatine excretion , taking this precaution .
The experiments were begun about 12 hours after the last ordinary meal in Experiments I and III , and six hours after , in Experiment II .
Tables VII , VIII , and IX show the various determinations made .
The creatinine was first of all estimated directly by Folin 's method without removing the aceto-acetic acid , and the results are referred to as " apparent creatinine .
" The true creatinine was then obtained after removing the aceto-acetic acid by the distillation method .
The creatinine + creatine was determined by heating the urine for three and a half hours on the water-bath with hydrochloric acid .
By subtracting the apparent creatinine values from the creatinine + creatine output , the apparent creatine was obtained , and , by subtracting the true creatinine from the creatinine-t-creatine , the true creatine output was obtained .
Duplicate determinations were performed in each case , and in each determination the mean of six to eight readings of the scale was taken .
In Experiment I ( E. P. P. ) , cream alone was eaten on the first two days ; on the third day protein was added to the diet .
The calorie value of the diet was low .
The effect of the withdrawal of carbohydrates was shown by the prompt appearance of aceto-acetic acid in the urine .
On the first day the nitroprusside reaction ( Ilothera 's ) was faint , but on the second and third days it was well marked , and 0 872 and 0-874 grin , of aceto-acetic acid were excreted .
On the first day the apparent creatinine was 1*82 grm. , while the true creatinine and creatinine + creatine was P78 and 1*80 respectively , so that no creatine was excreted in the urine , as the difference is within the limits of experimental error .
On the 2nd day the apparent creatinine was diminished to l-58 grm. , while the true creatinine and creatinine + creatine were practically the same as on the previous day , i.e. , 1-8 L and 1'82 grm. The apparent creatine was , therefore , 0-24 grin .

throughout the experiment , viz. , 15 grm. On the first day the apparent creatine was already 0'07 grm. , and on the second and third days it had risen to 0*22 and 0 36 grm. respectively , but no true creatine was excreted at all .
The difference in the scale reading between the apparent and true creatinine was 2 mm. on the third day of this experiment .
It has been previously shown ( p. 211 , fig. 1 ) that the error in the estimation of the creatinine caused by the aceto-acetic acid in these two experiments agrees fairly closely with the error caused by adding the same concentration of a sodium aceto-acetate solution to normal urine .
| As it was necessary to be absolutely certain that if any creatine was present in the urine it would be converted into creatinine by the methods we have used , some pure creatine was added to a part of the urine of the third day in Experiment II .
The estimation of the creatinine + creatine in the plain urine and in the urine to which creatine had been added was .
11( carried out under precisely similar conditions on the same water-bath .
The result ( Table VI ) showed that in the plain urine no creatine was converted into creatinine , but that the creatine was almost quantitatively converted into creatinine in the sample of urine to which creatine had been added .
This control experiment shows that creatine if present in the urine is detected and estimated by the methods employed .
As we wished to confirm the results of these experiments on ourselves , Dr. M. Donaldson very kindly took the following diet for three days , viz. , | pint of cream and three eggs each day .
We wish to express our thanks to him .
The urine gave Eothera 's nitroprusside test on the first day , and this reaction was well marked on the second and third days .
The true Excretion of Creatine in Carbohydrate Starvation .
219 creatinine in the urine was again very constant for the three days , lying between 2 and 2'3 grm. On the first and second days the apparent creatine was 012 grm. , and on the third day it was 016 , while no true creatine was excreted .
The apparent creatinine was not so low as in Experiments I and II , but its difference from the true creatinine was quite definite enough to be measured on the colorimeter .
Discussion of Results .
These three experiments show that the removal of carbohydrate from the diet causes an excretion of aceto-acetic acid in sufficient amount to cause an error in the estimation of creatinine , so that the results are too low and creatine is apparently excreted .
Cathcart(5 ) , Benedict ( 2 ) , Mendel and Rose ( 19 ) state that creatine occurs in the urine under somewhat similar conditions to those under which we have worked .
The amounts of creatine they obtained were about the same as those apparently obtained by us , before we removed the aceto-acetic acid , e.g. the largest amount that Cathcart ( 5 ) found on a fat diet was 0*38 grm. , which is slightly more than the apparent creatine we found on the third day of Experiment II .
Cathcart remarks that the creatinine excretion diminishes to a certain extent , as the result of a fat diet .
We have found that it remains constant throughout , and in the case of G- .
G- .
agreed very closely with the amount of creatinine excreted 15 months before on a pure fat and carbohydrate diet ( 10 ) .
However , the error caused by the presence of aceto-acetic acid in the urine results in less creatinine being found than is actually present .
Our experiments extended over about the same time as those of Cathcart , but there was a slight difference , viz. , that we had no preliminary starvation day .
However in Experiment I the condition of semi-starvation was really very similar to that of one day 's complete starvation , as only half a pint of cream was taken and the calorie value was 1060 .
We have also published a case of carbohydrate starvation ( 10 ) lasting for 10 days in which the diet had a calorie value of only 1969 per diem .
Ho creatine was excreted at any time , and the creatinine excretion remained constant throughout .
From these results we draw the conclusion that mere carbohydrate starvation itself does not cause an excretion of creatine in the urine .
Naturally , no conclusion can be drawn from these experiments as to whether creatine is excreted during prolonged periods of total starvation , but we maintain that in all those many physiological and pathological conditions in which acetone bodies are excreted in the urine , the estimations of creatinine 220 Alleged Excretion of Creatine in Carbohydrate Starvation .
and creatine must be inaccurate , unless the precaution is taken of removing the aceto-acetic acid from the urine .
Conclusions .
1 .
The presence of aceto-acetic acid always causes an error in the estimation of creatinine and the error increases with increasing amounts of aceto-acetic acid .
As the result of this error the estimation of creatinine will be too low .
This error is not eliminated if the diluted urine is allowed to stand for varying lengths of time before making the readings .
2 .
The aceto-acetic acid is removed in the estimation of creatinine+ creatine and does not cause any error .
3 .
As the creatinine figure is too low and the creatinine + creatine figure is correct , it will appear that creatine has been excreted .
4 .
Acetone and / 3-oxybutyric acid , if present in amounts comparable to those which usually occur in urine , produce practically no error in the estimation of creatinine .
5 .
A simple and reliable method has been devised for removing aceto-acetic acid , preliminary to the estimation of creatinine .
6 .
In our experiments a carbohydrate-free diet did not cause the excretion of any creatine .
