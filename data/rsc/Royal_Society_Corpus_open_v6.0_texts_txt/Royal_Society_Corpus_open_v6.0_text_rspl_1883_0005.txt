" By John Tyndall , F.R.S. Received February 5 , 1883 .
On Hind Head , a fine moorland plateau about three miles from Haslemere , with an elevation of 900 feet above the sea , I have recently erected a small iron hut , which forms , not only a place of rest , but an extremely suitable station for meteorological observations .
Here , since the beginning of last November , I have continued to record from time to time the temperature of the earth 's surface as compared with that of the air above the surface .
My object was to apply , if possible , the results which my experiments had established regarding the action of aqueous vapour upon radiant heat .
Two stout poles about 6 feet high were firmly fixed in the earth 8 feet asunder .
From one pole to the other was stretched a string , from the centre of which the air thermometer was suspended .
Its bulb was 4 feet above the earth .
The surface thermometer was placed upon a layer of cotton wool , on a spot cleared of heather , which thickly covered the rest of the ground .
The outlook from the thermometers was free and extensive ; with the exception of the iron hut just referred to , there was no house near , the hut being about 50 yards distant from the thermometers .
On November 11th , at 5.45 p.m. , these were placed in position , and observed from time to time afterwards .
Here are the results :\#151 ; 6 p.m ... ... .

November 12th , the wind had veered to the east , and was rather strong .

[ Feb. 8 , During the first and last of these observations the sky was entirely overcast , during the other two a few stars were dimly visible .
On November 13th , 25th , and 26th , observations were also made , but they presented nothing remarkable .
It was otherwise , however , on December 3 Oth .
On the morning of that day the temperature was very low , snow a foot deep covered the heather , while there was a very light movement of the air from the north-east .
Assuming aqueous vapour to play the part that I have ascribed to it , the conditions were exactly such as would entitle us on a priori grounds to expect a considerable waste of the earth 's heat .
At 8.5 a.m. the thermometers were placed in position , having left the hut at a common temperature of 35 ' .
The cotton wool on which the surface thermometer was laid was of the same temperature .
A single minute 's exposure sufficed to establish a difference of 5 ' between the two thermometers .
The following observations were then made 8.10 a.m. ---- ... Air 29Q ... ... . .

Up to this time the sun was invisible : a dense dark cloud , resting on the opposite ridge of Blackdown , virtually retarded his rising .

" 11 During the last two observations , the newly risen sun shone upon the air thermometer .
As the day advanced the difference between air and wool became gradually less .
From 18 ' at 8.50 a.m. , it had sunk at 9.25 to 15 ' , at 9.50 to 13 ' , while at 10.25 , the sun being unclouded at the time , the difference was 11 ' ; the air at that hour being 31 ' and the wool 20 ' .
In the celebrated experiments of Patrick W ilson , the greatest difference observed between a surface of snow and the air 2 feet above the snow , was 16 ' ; while the greatest difference noticed by Wells during his long continued observations , fell short of this amount .
Had Wilson employed swandown or cotton wool , and had he placed his thermometer 4 feet instead of 2 feet above the surface , his difference would probably have surpassed mine , for his temperatures were much lower than those observed by me .
There is , however , considerable similarity in the conditions under which we operated .
Snow in both cases was on the ground , and with him , there was a light movement of the aii* from the east , while with me the motion 18831 Terrestrial Radiation .
23 was from the north-east .
The great differences of temperature between earth and air which both his observations and mine reveal , are due to a common cause , namely , the withdrawal of the check to terrestrial radiation which is imposed by the presence of aqueous ^Let us now compare these results with otherR obtained at a time of extreme atmospheric serenity , when the air was almost a dead calm , and the sky without a cloud .
At 3.30 p.m. , January 16th , the thermometers were placed in position , and observed afterwards with the following results :\#151 ; 3.40 3.50 P.M ... Air 43 ' . .

" 36 .- 32 These observations , and especially the last of them , merit our attention .
There was no visible impediment to terrestrial radiation .
The sky was extremely clear , the moon was shining , Orion , the Pleiades , Charles ' Wain , including the small companion star at the bend of the shaft , the north star , and many others , were clearly visible .
On no previous occasion during these observations had I seen the firmament purer 5 and still , under these favourable conditions , the difference between air and wool at 6 P.M. was only 4 ' , or less than one-fourth of that observed on the morning of the 10th of December .
We have here , I submit , a very striking illustration of the action of that invisible constituent of the atmosphere , to the influence of which I drew attention more than twenty-two years ago- On the 10th of December the wind was light from the north-east , with a low temperature .
On the 16th of January it was very light from the southwest , with a higher temperature .
The one was a dry air , the other was a humid air ; the latter , therefore , though of great optical transparency , proved competent to arrest the invisible heat of the earth .
The variations in the temperatures of the wool recorded in the last column of figures are , moreover , not without a cause .
The advance ot temperature from 28 ' at 5 p.m. to 32 ' at .6 p.m. , is not to be accounted for by any visible change in the atmosphere , or by any alteration in the motion of the air .
The advance was due to the intrusion at 6 p.m. of an invisible screen between the earth and firmament .
As the night advanced , the serenity of the air , became , if possible , more perfect , and the observations were continued with the following results:\#151 ; 24 Mr. J. Tyndall .

" Here , again , the difference of 4 ' between the temperature of the wool at 8.30 p.m. , and its temperature at 10.30 p.m. , is not to be referred to any sensible change in the condition of the atmosphere .
The observations were continued on January 17th , 23rd , 24th , 25th , and 30th ; but I will confine myself to the results obtained on the evening of the day last mentioned .
The thermometers were exposed at 6.45 p.m. , and by aid of a lamp read off from time to time afterwards .

" 27 Daring these observations the atmosphere was very serene .
There was no moon , but the firmament was powdered with stars .
The serenity , however , had been preceded by heavy rain , which doubtless had left the atmosphere charged with aqueous vapour .
The movement of the air was from the south-west and light .
Here again , with an atmosphere at least as clear as that on December 10th , the difference between air and wool did not amount to one-fourth of that observed on the latter occasion .
The results obtained on February 3rd were corroborative .

" 30 Here again , the difference between air and wool is only 4 degrees , although the sky was cloudless , and the stars were bright .
The movement of the air was from the south-west and light .
On the forenoon of this day there had been a heavy and persistent rain storm .
Heavy rain and high wind also occurred on the night following .
The serene interval during which the observations were made lay , therefore , between the two storms .
Doubtless the gap was well filled with pure aqueous vapour .
Further observations were made in considerable numbers , but they 1883 ] On Tei'restrial Radiation .
need not here be dwelt upon , my object being to illustrate a principle rather than to add to the multitudinous records of meteorology .
It will be sufficient to say , that with atmospheric conditions sensibly alike , the waste of heat from the earth varies from day to day ; a result due to the action of a body which escapes the sense of vision .
It is hardly necessary for me to repeat here my references to the observations of Leslie , Hennessey , and others , which revealed variations in the earth 's emission for which the observers could not account .
A close inspection of the observations of the late Principal Forbes on the Faulhorn , proves , I think , that the action of aqueous vapour came there into play , and his detection of this action , while unacquainted with its cause , is in my opinion a cogent proof of the accuracy of his work as a meteorologist .
Postscript .
In the u Philosophical Transactions 99 for 1882 , Part I , p. 348,1 refer to certain experiments executed by Professor Soret of Geneva .
My friend has recently drawn my attention to a communication made by him to the French Association for the Advancement of Science , in 1872 .
It gives me great pleasure to cite here the conclusions at which he has arrived .
" The influence of humidity is shown by the whole of the observations ; and it may be stated generally , that , other circumstances being equal* the greater the tension of aqueous vapour , the less intense is the radiation .
" In winter , when the air is drier , the radiation is much more intense than in summer , for the same height of the sun above the horizon .
" On several occasions a more intense radiation has been observed in dry than in humid weather , although the atmospnere was incontestably purer and more transparent in the second case than in the first.- m . .
" The maximum intensity of radiation , particularly in the summer , corresponds habitually to days exceptionally cold and dry .
" Such are the results of experiments , executed by a most excellent observer , on the radiation of the sun .
They apply word for word to terrestrial radiation .
They are , moreover , in complete harmony with the results , published by General Strachey in the " Philosophical Magazine " for 1866 .
Meteorologists will not , I trust , be offended with me if I say that from such outsiders , fresh to the work and equipped with the necessary physical knowledge , they may expect efficient aid towards introducing order and causality among their valuable observations .
