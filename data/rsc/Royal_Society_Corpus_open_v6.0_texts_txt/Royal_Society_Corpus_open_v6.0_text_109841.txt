] In the same manner as an exponent expresses one operation on quantity , namely , the multiplication of it by itself a certain number of times , or raising it to the power expressed by that exponent , so the term Function , which has been introduced into modern analysis , is intended to express generally the results of all the various operations that can be performed upon quantity .
Many of these operations consist of two parts , the direct and the inverse .
To extract a root is the inverse , with reference to that of raising any number to a higher power .
So the integral is the inverse of the differential calculus ; and the same observation applies to finite differences .
In all these cases the inverse method is by far the more difficult of the two .
The author 's object in the present essay is to consider the inverse method with respect to functions , and , if possible , to determine the value of an unknown function by means of any functional equation given , instead of discovering , as in the direct method , the value of a quantity from an equation in which the function is known .
But the mode in which the author pursues his inquiry , of course could not admit of being publicly read .
