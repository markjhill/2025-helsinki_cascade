On the Nature of Pancreatic Diabetes .
{ Preliminary Communication .

) Many explanations have been proposed for the fact , discovered by von Mering and Minkowski ( 1 ) , that extirpation of the pancreas is followed immediately by severe and fatal diabetes .
It has been suggested on the one hand that the normal function of the pancreas is to diminish excessive production of sugar , and that , in the absence of its restraining influence , .excessive sugar production and mobilisation are the results .
On the other hand , the fact that carbohydrates are not utilised by the body when administered to animals in this condition has been interpreted as showing that the tissues have lost their normal power of assimilating and utilising glucose .
It has also been suggested , though without much experimental support , that the sugar of the blood has to be built up into some other form before it can be utilised by the tissues .
We have recently , in a research on the influence of mechanical conditions and of temperature on the heart beat , modified the procedure described by Jerusalem and Starling ( 2 ) for working with a heart-lung preparation , so that we are able to keep a heart , connected with the lungs but isolated from the rest of the body , beating for many hours in approximately normal 1912.1 On the Nature of Pancreatic Diabetes .
219 conditions , i.e. working at a normal arterial pressure and with a normal output .
In this preparation we are able to vary at will the venous filling of the heart , the arterial resistance , or the temperature .
The total amount of blood employed is about 300 c.c. , and as the heart of a small dog puts out about 150 to 250 c.c. of blood per minute , the whole of the blood in the apparatus circulates through the heart once in every two minutes .
It occurred to us that it might be possible by using this preparation to throw i light on the pathogeny of pancreatic diabetes .
I. The Consumption of Sugar in the Normal Heart .
The power of the tissues to utilise glucose directly was asserted by Chauveau and Kaufmann ( 3 ) in the case of voluntary muscle , and has been proved in the case of the heart transfused with Ringer 's fluid , by Locke and Rosenheim ( 4 ) , and by Rohde ( 5 ) and others .
In our experiments , a small proportion of glucose having been added to the blood , it was allowed to circulate through the heart at a temperature of 37 ' C. continuously for two to three hours .
The arterial pressure was kept throughout at 80 to 90 mm. Hg .
The following table represents some of the results obtained:\#151 ; Consumption of Sugar by the Heart .

[ Mar. 26 , From these results we may conclude that the normal heart fed with normal blood under approximately physiological conditions consumes about 4 mgrm .
of sugar per hour and per gramme of heart muscle .
II .
The Consumption of Sugar in the Diabetic Heart .
Similar experiments were carried out on the hearts of dogs from which the pancreas had been removed from three to six days previously .
The following table represents the results obtained in six such experiments:\#151 ; Sugar Consumption in Diabetic Heart .

In two cases the sugar titration gave the Same results at the beginning and at the end of the hour .
In two other cases a difference in titration was obtained which pointed to a consumption of sugar of 0'5 mgrm .
per gramme of heart muscle .
But this difference was within the limits of our experimental error .
A series of parallel estimations of sugar in different samples of serum gave the following results\#151 ; Blood 1 .

Moreover , we have evidence of the occurrence of a certain small amount of glycolysis in the blood itself .
This in normal blood was probably not greater than 0'01 per cent , per hour during the first two hours of the experiment .
In diabetic blood taken at the end of the experiment a somewhat higher degree of glycolysis was occasionally observed .

0-91 0*89 0*01 " It is possible that a summation of glycolysis and experimental error would account for the highest figures obtained in the series of experiments on the diabetic heart .
They show at any rate that the consumption of sugar by the diabetic heart is minimal or , as we are inclined to believe , entirely absent .
III .
Is this loss of the Power to utilise Sugar in the Diabetic Heart due to the Absence of some Substance normally present in the Heart and Circulating Blood and presumably formed by the , or to the Presence of some Toxic Substance accumulating as a result of Extirpation of the Pancreas and preventing the Utilisation of Sugar by the Tissues ?
Two sets of experiments point to the former explanation as the most probable .
In the first set of experiments the heart from a diabetic animal was fed with blood from a normal animal .
In this case the consumption of sugar , even in the first hour , was considerably above that observed in the diabetic hearts fed with diabetic blood , and steadily increased during the next two hours of the experiment .

2*9 5*28 81 On the Nature of Pancreatic Diabetes .
In the reverse experiment a normal heart was fed with diabetic blood .
In this case the consumption of sugar during the first hour was only slightly below normal and steadily diminished during the succeeding two hours , as is shown by the following figures :\#151 ; 1st hour .
2nd hour .
3rd hour .
3-5 2-5 1*7 The obvious interpretation of these two sets of experiments is that the tissues and blood normally contain some substance , the presence of which is essential for the direct utilisation of sugar by the tissues .
This substance is gradually used up in the tissues , and therefore has to be continually replaced from the blood if the utilisation of sugar is to continue .
IY .
Is this Substance derived from the Pancreas To answer this question an extract of pancreas was made by grinding up the gland , boiling it in slightly acid Ringer 's solution , and filtering it to free it from the coagulated proteins ; 10 c.c. of the filtrate were neutralised with a few drops of sodium carbonate solution and added to the blood circulating through the heart of a diabetic animal .
The addition was in each case made during the second hour of the experiment , in order that the consumption of sugar by the heart during the first hour might be tested .
The following results were obtained:\#151 ; Diabetic Heart Fed with Diabetic Blood .
Consumption of Sugar in milligrammes per grm. of Heart Muscle .
1st hour 2nd hour ( blood alone ) .
( after addition of pancreatic extract ) .
1*5 4-3 0-5 3-0 0-5 28 0-5 36 It will be seen that in every case the addition of a boiled extract of pancreas , whether derived from the same .animal ( dog ) or from another animal ( cat ) , raised the sugar consumption by the heart from a figure which was within the limits of experimental error to a point closely approaching that found in normal hearts .
The effect of the pancreatic extract in improving the action of the heart was evident during the experiment itself .
In most cases the heart in the diabetic animal , under the conditions of the experiment , has a lower rate of beat than that found in the normal animal .
The effect of adding the extract of pancreas was to quicken the rate of beat up to a normal figure .
Thus , in one experiment , the rate of beat during the The Measurement of Trypanosoma rhodesiense .
223 first hour was 108 per minute , while feeding with diabetic blood ; during the second hour , after the addition of pancreatic extract to the same blood , the heart beats rose to 144 per minute .
We hope to continue these experiments , and especially to determine the respiratory quotient in the normal and in the diabetic heart , and the influence of pancreatic extract on the same .
So far as our results go , they seem to indicate that the pancreas normally produces a hormone which circulates in the blood , and the presence of which is necessary in order that the tissue cells may be able to assimilate and utilise the sugar of the blood .
In fact , they indicate that the second of the two explanations , which have been mentioned above as having been proposed for the occurrence of pancreatic diabetes , is essentially correct .

] Introduction .
The following paper contains the results of a biometric study of Trypanosoma , rhodesiense ( Stephens and Fantham ) .
This trypanosome , which is dimorphic , was described by us in July , 1910 .
It was considered to be a new species of trypanosome , producing Sleeping Sickness in man , since it could be distinguished morphologically by the fact that a certain percentage of short forms showed the nucleus either close to or even posterior to the blepharoplast , a feature which has never been recorded for T. gambiense , either before or since .
Otherwise , in external morphology T. rhodesiense closely resembles T. gambiense , for there are long , slender forms and short , stumpy forms , together with intermediate forms .
These flagellates were figured by us
