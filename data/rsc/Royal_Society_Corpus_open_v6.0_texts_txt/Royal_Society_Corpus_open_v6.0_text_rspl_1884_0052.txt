( Abstract .
) While studying the molecular constitution of various organic substances by means of their action on the ultra-violet rays in the manner described in the " Philosophical Transactions , " vol. 170 , p. 257 , 1879 , it was considered of importance to ascertain whether absolute physical measurements could not be substituted for the uncertain chemical reactions and variable physiological tests at present employed as a means of detecting the alkaloids in medicolegal examinations .
About forty alkaloids and derivatives therefrom have been examined , authentic specimens having been procured from the chemists by whom they were prepared .
Solutions were carefully made of the same strength in most cases , only diactinic solvents , most generally alcohol , being employed .
The cells with quartz sides for holding the solutions were of various thicknesses , ranging from 1 mm. to 20 mm. The electrodes employed to give a well-defined spectrum consisted , one of an alloy of tin with 25 per cent , cadmium , the other of lead with cadmium in the same proportion .
Spectra are thus obtained with lines of the same intensity , numerous and evenly distributed throughout a spectrum extending VOL. XXXVIII .

The prominent lines of cadmium are distinguished by their extension across the spectrum from pole to pole , while those of lead are on one side only and those of tin on the other .
As a weaker continuous spectrum fills the intervals between the lines , there is no difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements .
To secure well-defined spectra the photographs were taken with the solutions placed in front of the slit , upon which the rays from the sparks were concentrated by a quartz lens of 2 inches diameter and 3 inches focal length .
The spectra were measured by means of an ivory scale applied to the surface of the photographs ; this had bevilled edges and was divided thereon into hundredths of an inch .
The linear measurements are termed scale numbers and are arbitrary , but they were reduced to wave.-lengths by the use of an interpolation curve .
The oscillation frequencies were also read off on a second curve whenever it was considered desirable to record them .
The wave-lengths were taken from those published in the " Philosophical Transactions , " vol. 175 , p. 63 , 1884 , but for use in recording these measurements the fractions of a tenth-meter were disregarded .
The total number of lines employed , including two or three air-lines , was seventy .
For the convenience of those who maybe engaged in similar work , the wave-lengths of the lines and their reciprocals are given on page 3 .
The wave-lengths of a magnesium line and a calcium triplet are also inserted , as it is sometimes convenient to refer to them .
The absorption curves which have been drawn differ from those figured in my previous communications , owing to the use of wavelength numbers .
The curves have been made continuous , and so the necessity for shading has been avoided ; but very careful descriptions of the spectra are furnished in addition , so that no detail has been omitted .
Nearly all the samples of alkaloids examined were obtained from Messrs. T. and H. Smith and Co. , of Edinburgh , Mr. David Howard , of the firm of Howard and Sons , of Stratford , and Dr. C. E. A. Wright , F.R.S. The bodies maybe divided into two groups , those which exhibit spectra with absorption-bands and those with continuous spectra .

[ Dec. 11 , 1 .
The absorption-spectra offer a ready and valuable means of ascertaining the purity of preparations of the alkaloids , and particularly of establishing their identity .
The quantity of some of the alkaloids present in a solution may be estimated by means of the absorption curves .
The different character of the various specimens known as aconitines may be recognised ; thus the comparatively harmless base may be distinguished from those of great physiological activity by its transmission of a continuous spectrum , while the- three specimens of physiologically active aconitines are distinguished from one another by their characteristic absorption curves .
That the three active aconitine bases are substances each with a different .chemical constitution , is a conclusion confirmed by optical examination .
The purity of quinine and absence of any admixture of cinchonine can be readily determined by reason of the latter substance being much less diactinic than the former ; but for the same reason quinine cannot be estimated in presence of cinchonine .
Drugs of such potency as aconitine , morphine , quinine , strychnine , \amp ; c. , which ought to be prescribed only when of absolute purity , should have their exact nature and degree of purity guaranteed by an examination of their absorption-spectra .
2 .
In comparing the spectra of substances of similar constitution , it is observed that such as are derived from bases by the substitution of an alkyl radical for hydrogen and acid radicals for hydroxyl , the curve is not altered in character , but may vary in length when equal weights of substances are examined .
This is explained by the absorption-band being dependent upon the compactness of structure of the carbon and nitrogen nucleus of the molecule , and because equal weights are not molecular weights .
Examples are afforded by morphine and codeine ( methyl-morphine ) , diacetyl-codeine , and tetracetyl-morphine .
3 .
Bases which contain oxidised radicals , as hydroxyl , carboxyl , or methoxyl , diminish in diactinic quality in proportion to the amount of oxygen they contain .
Examples are papaverine , narceine , narcotine , and oxynarcotine .
The apo-derivatives are less diactinic than the parent bases in a* degree which indicates that the molecular weights have been nearly doubled .
Examples are apo-morphia and pseudaconitine .
4 .
Bodies with the pyridine and quinoline nucleus exhibit absorption-bands extending between wave-lengths 350 and 280 , those with a benzene nucleus generally from 290 to 260 , or rays even more refrangible ; while the aconitines and opium bases , likewise strychnine , give evidence of a benzene nucleus , the cinchona bases , with piperine and brucine , appear to contain a nucleus of quinoline or pyridine .
