" Researches on the Theory of Invariants .
" By XWILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE , M.A. , F.R.So Received December 20 , 1854 .
Invariants may be regarded from two points of view , the permutational and the functional .
According to the former they are considered as arising from a process of permutation , according to the latter as derivatives from other functions .
In this paper the latter course is adopted ; and the following is an outline of the method : Let u=f(x , y , .
a. .
, aa ... ) be any homogeneous function of the degree n of the variables x , y,. .
in which a , , a,1 , ,. .
multiplied by their respective multinomial coefficients are the coefficients of xn y*. .
, x , ' y / ..,. .
Let x , y,. .
undergo any linear transformation , and let 1 , m,. .
, l f , m,. .
, .
be the coefficients of transformation ; also let a=I m. .

Now the fundamental condition of invariance is expressed by the following equation:mnn A F(a a. )=F(a .

But in the case of two variables the coefficient a may be expressed by a series of symbols with a single suffix , thus : ao , o , a,. .

Now since A is of the same degree in 1 , m , and in It , m ' , the coefficients of all powers and products of ao , a ; ,. .
in which the degree of 1 , m is above or below that of I1 , mt , will vanish in the invariant .
And from this and some other considerations it is shown , that not only nzn Elo U=O , D =,. .
noU=O , but that the coefficients of the invariant may be calculated from the equations arising from equating to zero each term of the last equation above written , operated upon by the symbol &gt; .
This always gives a system of linear equations for finally determining the coefficients .
It does not appear possible fully to explain this method without entering into more details than can be given in an abstract.:From the general equations for so determining the coefficients , the number and degrees of the distinct invariants belonging to any given function may theoretically be determined ; and this has been done for the simplest case , viz. quadratic functions .
But the expressions for higher degrees appear so complicated that an answer to this important question can hardly be expected from this method , in any case not already known .
The view of invariants here taken has suggested a series of other functions of which invariants form the last term .
These functions , which I propose to call Variants , may be thus expressed .
If functions of the degrees r , s,. .
( r , s,. .
being less than n ) have in variants of the degree m , then writing dd dl / dm s l/ A2F(aao , aao,. .

n With the exact relation between these functions and covariants I am not at present acquainted .
