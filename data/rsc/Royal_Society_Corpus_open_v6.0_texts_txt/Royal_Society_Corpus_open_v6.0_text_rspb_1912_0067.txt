) According to the theory advanced by Harden and Young , * the presence of phosphate is essential for the alcoholic fermentation of sugar by yeast-juice .
In the presence of the fermenting complex , the phosphate and sugar react together , with the simultaneous production of equivalent quantities of carbon dioxide , alcohol , and hexosephosphate .
The hexosephosphate is then hydrolysed by an enzyme present in yeast-juice , with formation of a hexose and free phosphate , and the latter then again undergoes the first reaction with more sugar .
The phosphate thus repeatedly passes through a cycle which may be represented by the following equations:\#151 ; ( 1 ) 2C6Hi306 + 2R2HP04 = 2C02 + 2C2H60 + C6H10O4(PO4R2)2 + 2H20 , ( 2 ) C6Hio04(P04R2)2+2H20 = C6H1206 + 2R2HP04 .
The normal rate of fermentation of excess of sugar by active yeast-juice is therefore dependent upon the rate at which phosphate is set free from the hexosephosphate , and any acceleration of this reaction would increase the rate of fermentation of the sugar .
Thus the addition to yeast-juice and sugar of a hexosephosphatase , that is , an enzyme capable of hydrolysing hexosephosphate , would be expected to bring about this result , and the following experiments on the action of various enzyme preparations on sodium hexosephosphate have been carried out primarily with the object of finding such an enzyme .
As a result , it was found that enzymes of very different origin ( Ricinus lipase and almond emulsin ) were capable of hydrolysing hexosephosphate , but the effect of adding these to fermenting yeast-juice has not yet been ascertained .
Preparation of Hexosephosphoric Add.\#151 ; The solution of hexosephosphoric acid used in these experiments was prepared as described by Young , f by decomposing the lead salt with hydrogen sulphide .
The solution of free hexosephosphoric acid was made neutral to litmus by a known volume of sodium hydrate solution , and such a neutral solution was used in all the experiments .
The amount of hexosephosphoric acid was previously deter* ' Roy .

The Action of Enzymes on Hexosephosphate .

In all experiments the term hexosephosphate is used to designate the solution neutral to litmus .
The extent of hydrolysis was in each case ascertained by precipitating the liberated phosphate with magnesium citrate mixture , igniting and weighing as magnesium pyrophosphate .
All results , as well as the concentration of the original hexosephosphate solutions , are expressed in terms of magnesium pyrophosphate .
The following enzyme preparations were employed :\#151 ; ( a ) lipase from castor oil seeds ; ( b ) autolysed ox pancreas ; ( c ) emulsin ; ( cl ) zymin extract ; ( e ) autolysed yeast-juice .
( a ) Lipase from Castor Oil Seeds ( Bicinus communis).\#151 ; This was prepared by extracting the freshly ground seeds of Ricinus communis with ether until fat free , and using the residue as the lipase preparation .
It was found to be highly active .
The results of three experiments are given in the accompanying table , which refers in each case to the following set of mixtures:\#151 ; A. 0*3 grm. lipase+ 3 c.c. N/ 5 acetic acid+ 15 e.c. water .
B. " " " +15 c.c. hexosephosphate .
C. Same as B , but boiled before incubation .
The experiments were carried out at 25 ' in presence of toluene ( 0*5 c.c. ) , and different hexosephosphate solutions were employed in each set of experiments .

( b ) Ox Pancreas.\#151 ; The fresh ox pancreas , freed as far as possible from connective tissue , was allowed to undergo autolysis for four days under toluene at 37 ' .
The liquid was then filtered through a coarse muslin cloth to remove any undigested pancreas , and the filtrate used in the experiments .

( d ) Zymin Extract.\#151 ; 10 grm. of " zymin " preparation were digested four days with 30 c.c. water at 25 ' .
The resulting mixture was filtered and used in the experiment .
It was found to contain considerable amounts of phosphate .
An aqueous extract of zymin ( yeast treated with acetone , was found only to have a slight action on hexosephosphate .
This is seen from the following experiment carried out at 25 ' in presence of toluene , the mixture being incubated for three days :\#151 ; * 'Roy .

It was found to be incapable of fermenting glueose .
The following mixtures were incubated at 25 ' for 24 hours in presence of toluene , and the free phosphate estimated:\#151 ; A. Autolysed yeast-juice 25 c.c. +10 c.c. water .

= 0*0823 " Hexosephosphate is thus hydrolysed to some extent by autolysed yeast-juice .
This is in agreement with with the experiments of Harden and Young , who showed that in actively fermenting yeast-juice most of the phosphate was present in the combined form , but was gradually set free by an enzyme hexosephosphatase , after the juice had lost its fermentative activity.* An attempt was made to ascertain if hexosephosphatase could be isolated from the autolysed yeast-juice : 50 c.c. of autolysed yeast-juice were added with constant stirring to a mixture of 400 c.c. alcohol and 400 c.c. ether .
The white precipitate was filtered immediately at the pump , washed once with ether , and air dried .
A very small amount of a brownish .
sticky precipitate remained .
This was dissolved in 50 c.c. of water and allowed to stand overnight with a little toluene .
It was then filtered through muslin , and the solution thus obtained examined as to its hydrolytic properties towards hexosphosphate .
