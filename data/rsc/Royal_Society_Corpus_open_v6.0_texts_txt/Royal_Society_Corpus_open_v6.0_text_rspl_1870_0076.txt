487 of the diaphragm was noticed ; and the varying condition of that muscle , and of the lungs and pleura , with their mutual relations , are commented on .
The importance of this passive tension of the diaphragm is indicated , and exemplified both physiologically and pathologically .
It is essential in retaining the supplemental air within the lungs , in restoring the equilibrium of repose , in economizing active muscular power , and in maintaining the pericardial space , \amp ; c. The action of the diaphragm in relation to the walls of the chest and to other muscles is next discussed ; and the influence of the diaphragm in drawing in the chest-walls , under certain circumstances , is pointed out , and illustrated by cases of injury to the spinal cord .
The action of the intercostal muscles , as necessary adjuncts to the diaphragm and as muscles of inspiration , is insisted on and illustrated by diagrams ; and a summary of their action is given .
The agency of the serratus magnus is then discussed ; and reasons are advanced , supported by observation and experiment , to show that it is only under special conditions and to a limited extent that it can be regarded as taking any part in the act of inspiration .
The mobility of the different costal regions and of the sternum is exemplified by observation and experiment .
Lastly , the question of abdominal and thoracic breathing , severally in the male and female , is considered ; and reasons are adduced for concluding that the received opinions on this subject are erroneous .

In a former communication * , I have shown that the paraffins , the constitution of which is known , may be arranged in four groups .
The first group , which I called normal paraffins , contain the carbon atoms linked together in a single chain .
Of these I have obtained some new ones , which I shall describe more fully in a further communication .
The normal paraffins which I have so far studied are given , together with their boiling-points , in the following Table:\#151 ; From the acids of the So-called al-From petroleum .

488 Dr. W. Huggins on the Spectra [ May 25 , That these paraffins have really the constitution which I have ascribed to them follows partly from their mode of formation ; thus dipropyl was obtained from the normal propyl iodide , and dibutyl from normal butyl iodide .
The constitution of the others was determined by converting them into alcohols and studying the oxidation products of the latter ; thus the hexyl hydride from petroleum , as well as that obtained from mannite , was transformed into secondary hexyl alcohol , which on oxidation yielded acetic acid and normal butyric acid .
In the communication above referred to , I placed the hydrocarbon C8 H18 from methyl-hexyl carbinol amongst another group ; but I have found now that this body is identical with dibutyl and also with the hydrocarbon which Zinke obtained from primary octyl alcohol .
This chemist prepared also dioctyl , C16 H34 , which consequently is a normal paraffin ; and it appears probable that dihexyl , which Brazier and Grossleth obtained by the electrolysis of oenanthylic acid , belongs to this group too .
We are now acquainted with the following normal paraffins:\#151 ; .

" Note on the Spectrum of Uranus and the Spectrum of Comet I. , 1871 .
" By William Huggins , LL. D. , D.C.L. , V.P.ll .
S. Received May 10 , 1871 .
In the paper " On the Spectra of some of the Fixed Stars"* , presented conjointly by Dr. Miller and myself to the Royal Society in 1864 , we gave the results of our observations of the spectra of the planets Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn ; but we found the light from Uranus and Neptune too faint to be satisfactorily examined with the spectroscope .
