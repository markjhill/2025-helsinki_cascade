Some isolated observations have been made from time to time upon the temperatures of the Monotremes.# More recently Sutherland ' !
' has published an important series of observations upon the temperatures of Echidna and several Marsupials , and upon the variation in their body-temperature with changes in that of the air .
These observations of Sutherland have been referred to in some detail by Vernon , j in whose paper , and in Pembrey 's chapter " On Animal-heat " in Schafer 's ' Text-hook of Physiology , ' and in Pichet 's article " Chaleur " in the ' Dictionnaire de Physiologie , ' the literature of the subject is so fully collected that it will merely he necessary for me to refer to those papers directly bearing upon the present work , when discussing the experimental results .
Without doubt , as pointed out by Sutherland , S Monotremes and Marsupials present a stage of physiological development intermediate between the fairly accurate homoeothermism of the higher mammals , and the rudimentary indications in this direction which , according to Vernon , || occur in lower vertebrates , but the conclusion of both Sutherland and Vernon that O " is nearly a cold-blooded animal , " which conclusion is based upon some observations of Macleay's,1F is very far from being sustained by my experiments .

B 11.1.1902 Monotremes and Marsupials in this ascending scale of physiological superiority to the temperature of environment .
Sutherland made his observations upon Echidnas and Marsupials kept in confinement during an extended period , in which the temperature of the air varied from 14 to 36 ' C. I also have done this , and my observations entirely confirm Sutherland 's .
My range was somewhat more extensive , viz. , 4\#151 ; 35 ' , and , in some cases , 40 ' C. I found further that during the winter Echidna abandons all attempts at homoeothermism , and hibernates for 4 months .
The present investigation was not primarily concerned with recording the variations in the temperature of the animals with that of the environment , but with ascertaining to what extent the different groups of animals utilised variation in production and variation in loss for purposes of adjustment .
With this end in view I have measured the respiratory activity of specimens from the different groups of mammals .
C02 production , and not the amount of oxygen consumed , lias been taken as indicating oxidation , because the former is so much simpler .
The respiratory quotient for Echidna does not appreciably vary when the animal is submitted to an environment varying 18 ' C. , provided that the diet is the same and adequate in quantity .
In order to measure the C02 produced , it was necessary to enclose the animals in a receptacle , which was placed in a hath of varying temperature and supplied by a current of air at the temperature of the bath .
As it was necessary to conduct observations at the whole range of temperature in one day , I was obliged to limit the experiment at any particular temperature to from 1CJ to 2 hours .
Consequently the variations found in the animal 's own temperature do not necessarily indicate the extent of variation which might be produced by a longer sojourn , as under the conditions of Sutherland 's experiments .

5 5 750 5 5 RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE IN MONOTREMES AND MARSUPIALS .
The respiratory activity of the cat and rabbit have been investigated frequently .
I made observations on them and also on the lizards to obtain data in a precisely similar manner , to place in line with those obtained with Monotremes and Marsupials .
The temperature to which the animals were submitted ranged from 5 to 35 ' C. , and in some cases 40 ' C. Only one experiment was made with OrniIt is easy to shoot these animals , hut extremely difficult to catch them alive .
I have waited two years since this investigation commenced , hut have not been successful in securing another live specimen .
Most of my earlier experiments showed less regular results than those detailed below\#151 ; for instance , the production of C02 might he , in some cases , greater at 25 ' C. than it was at 20 ' C. In order to obtain results which would give regular curves 1 found it necessary to adopt the following precautions :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) To accustom the animals to confinement in the chamber by keeping them in it for a while on two preceding days , otherwise they often displayed considerable activity in efforts to escape during the earlier part of the experiment , thereby sending up the production of C02 in a way independent of the external temperature .
( 2 .
) To conduct the observations in a regular order , beginning with either the lowest or the highest temperature .
When I first began I did not take these precautions .
I soon found , however , that the C03 produced was not only a function of the temperature of the environment at the time being , but also depended upon whether this temperature was warmer or colder than the one the animal had been previously submitted to .
For instance , the respiratory activity at 20 ' C. was invariably greater when the animal had been previously at 35 ' C. than when it had just been living in an environment of 5 ' C. The physiological response to temperature , like conscious appreciation of it , is , to a certain extent , relative .
Experimental Method .
The animal was placed in a receiver A ( fig. 1 ) .
The broad end was rendered airtight by screwing it up against a rubber washer .
This was inserted in a tank containing 100 litres of water .
The temperature of the hath was maintained at the desired point by ice or else a small flame .
It was constantly mechanically stirred .
With this bulk of water there was no difficulty in keeping the temperature constant within T ' C. by adjusting the flame or adding or removing ice from time to time .
The thermometer* was graduated in -njth of a degree .
* All thermometers used throughout the experiments had their errors determined by reference to a standard .
4 PROFESSOR C. J. MARTIN ON THERMAL ADJUSTMENT ANY ) Air was aspirated through the chamber as shown in the figure .
It was first freed from C02 by passing over KHO , and dried by bubbling through H2S04 , then warmed or cooled to the temperature of the hath by passing through 8 metres of metal tube .
After leaving the chamber the air was dried by the H2S04 bottle and passed through Fig. 1 .
MohrhHHObul Solid KHO r PT PurnPtwo extra large Mohr 's bulbs , filled with 80 percent .
KOH^ and a U-tube containing H2S04 on pumice .
Between the H2S04 bottle and the KHO bulbs was a T-piece leading to a by-pass which communicated again with the aspirating tube beyond the .tube containing H2S04 and pumice ( see fig. 1 ) .
Air could he drawn through the by-pass or through the bulbs by opening or closing the clamp C. The C02 produced in a given time was found by the difference in the weight of the Mohr 's bulbs and U-tube before and after the experiment .
The observations were made upon animals which had received no food since the previous day .
They were weighed and their rectal temperatures taken before inserting in the chamber .
At the end of an experiment at each particular temperature they were removed and their temperatures taken .
They were immediately re-inserted in the chamber and gradually warmed up or cooled down to the temperature at which it was desired to make the next observation .
This warming up and adjustment usually took about 1 hour .

As the C02 production of these reptiles is so small , and in order to get an average result with a minimum of trouble , I used five specimens simultaneously .

No observations upon their number of respirations were made .
On cooling down to 5 ' C. they became quite inactive , and , as they were warmed up , displayed more and more activity until 30 ' C. was reached .
Above this temperature their activity diminished .
The following table represents the results of eight experiments .
In each experiment the C02 was collected for one hour .
At the expiration of the hour the animals were removed , their rectal temperatures taken , and replaced .
About three-quarters to one hour was occupied in adjusting the temperature of the bath for the next experiment .
The temperatures of individual lizards varied as much as '4 ' C. The figures in the table represent the average of the five .

The Echidnas were fed whilst in confinement upon milk containing either egg beaten up or very finely divided cooked meat .
They do very well , however , for a month or two upon a diet of milk only .
Observations upon the respiratory quotient were made when they were upon a milk diet .
The animal respired through a T-piece provided with gut-valves , one opening inwards , the other outwards .
The expiratory valve was connected Avitb an air meter the resistance of Avhich was compensated for by a weight passing over a pulley and geared to the axis of the meter .
A sample representative of the whole of the air breathed was obtained by the ingenious arrangement of Geppert and Zi'TNTZ* by which the meter operates as a motor , and by appropriate gearing lowers the level of the out-flow tube of the gas-burette and takes a sample of the air into the burette in amount exactly proportionate to the particular expiration moving the meter .
An analysis of the air in the burette gave the respiratory quotient .
This was done in duplicate .
The animal breathed through the meter for ten minutes at a time .
The amount of air breathed varied between 4000 and 5000 cub. centims. Respiratory quotient at 10 ' *4 C. .

RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE IN MONOTREMES AND MARSUPIALS .
Discussion of Results .
Before discussing the results of the experiments detailed above , I will place them in tabulated form .
I have also expressed them in curves ( hgs .
2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .
In order that the amount of C02 produced by the different animals of varying size , can be compared , they must he reduced to some common term .
Rubnee# and RichetI have shown that this term is surface .
I have accordingly calculated the experimental results in terms of 1000 sq .
centims. surface .
The surface of an animal is proportional to the y of its volume , or S \/ v where kis a constant .
Assuming that the specific gravity of the different animals does not vary , weight can be substituted for volume\#151 ; k of course assuming a different value .
The value of k in this case was determined by MeehJ and also by Rubner , S and found to be 11 *2 for mammals .
I have used this value for all the animals except the lizards .
In their case I determined the value of the constant by direct measurement of the skin after removal from the body .
Before skinning , the girth was taken in several parts of the body and limbs , and the spread-out skin was stretched slightly to coincide with these measurements .
I found the value of k for these animals to be 9'95 , and have in the calculations used 10 .

On examining the figures setting forth the temperature of animals corresponding with variations in the temperature of environment under the conditions of the RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE IN MONOTREMES AND MARSUPIALS .
experiments , or better by glancing at the curves ( fig. 2 ) wherein these relationships are graphically represented , it will be seen that the lizards I was working with are truly poikilothermic .
The curve of variation of body-temperature with change in temperature of environment from 5 ' to 39 ' C. , is nearly a straight line .
Fig. 2 .
The experiment was begun at the highest temperature employed ( 39''l C. ) .
Notwithstanding that I kept the animals in an environment of between 39 and 40 ' C. for 2\ hours , I could not get their mean temperature above 38'5 .
The air supplied was dry , so that this difference was probably due to some small amount of transpiration .
On lowering the temperature , this difference between animal and environment gradually diminished until , at 20 ' C. , there was only a difference of 0'T C. between VOL. CXCV.\#151 ; B. E them .
As the temperature of environment was further lowered the animal 's temperature sank with it , keeping , however , two or three tenths of a degree in excess , and at 5 ' C. their temperature was 5'5 .
In these temperature curves no attempt on the part of the animal in the direction of resisting the fall of temperature of their bodies is manifested , nor on glancing at the figures showing their C02 production , or the curve ( fig. 3 ) is there any indication of the increased heat formation observed by Yeiinon in frogs .
Fig. 3 .
EocternaL temp. C. ' The next point shown is that the body temperatures of Echidna , Ornithorhynchus , Marsupials , and higher mammals gradually rise in the order mentioned .
The temperature of these animals for an environment of 15 ' C. deduced from the curves ( fig. 2 ) is shown in the table below .

The above values are for the particular individuals experimented with .
They are typical , and agree with Sutherland 's , observations and with a number of observations I have made from time to time upon the temperature of Monotrem.es , either in captivity or immediately after they were shot .
My observations under these circumstances happened only rarely to be taken when the external temperature was 15 ' C. , but they indicate 28-29 ' as an average temperature for Echidna , and 29-30 ' for Ornithorhynchus , with environment at 15 ' C. The temperature observed by Miklouho-Macleay* in a single specimen of Ornithorhynchus was 24''8 C. when the water in which the animal was kept was 22'-2 C. This has led both Sutherland !
and YernonJ to the conclusion that Ornithorhynchus is " almost a cold-blooded animal .
" Macleay 's observation is , I am convinced , unreliable .
I have taken the temperature of upwards of thirty specimens either in captivity or immediately after being shot , and their temperature was always above 28 ' C. Ornithorhynchus is not an amphibious animal , and only goes into the water for food or to amuse itself , and if kept too long in water its temperature falls and it dies .
I imagine Macleay , from his remarks , kept the animal in a tub , in which it could not emerge from the water .
He says the animal was in a " dying condition , and presented no chance of living much longer .
" These circumstances fully account for the low body-temperature .
The experiments with Ornithorhynchus in this paper show that between 5 ' and 30 ' C. it is better able to adjust its temperature than a rabbit .
When subjected to a temperature above 30 ' C. it became feverish , as the physiological limits for this animal had been exceeded .
I think these results show that Ornithorhynchus has been most unjustly degraded to " almost a cold-blooded animal .
" The temperatures for Echidna and Marsupials agree with Sutherland's* and Senior'sS observations , but as mentioned in the introduction , they are subject to much wider variations , as the specimens I have kept in the laboratory during the last two winters hibernated from the middle of June to the middle of October .
During hibernation they took neither food nor water , and their body-temperature followed that of the shed in which they lived within 0'*5 C. The table below shows to what extent the body-temperature of the individuals of the different groups of animals varied when that of the environment changed from 5U to 35 ' C. e 2 * Loc .

The experiments with lizards { Cyclodus gig as ) show an extremely small oxidation-coefficient throughout the whole range of* temperature experimented with .
These animals only produced '0525 gramme COo per kilogramme per hour at 20 ' C. , whereas the rabbit produced l'216 grammes at this temperature .
The former is approximately Yjth of the latter .
The data show two critical temperatures ( see curve , fig. 3 ) , one between 5 ' and 10 ' C. , and another between 30 ' and 40 ' C. A small change in the temperature between these points occasions a rapid increase in their metabolic activity disproportionate to the effect of a similar increase in temperature between 10 ' and 30 ' C. In fig. 3 I have plotted a curve for Rcma obtained from the data of Hugo Schultz .
# The two curves are similar in character , but the critical temperatures are both a few degrees higher for Cyclodus than for and the respiratory activity of these frogs is throughout more energetic than that of the lizards , and greatly so at the higher temperatures .
The sudden increase in oxidation above 30 ' C. occurs also in the Monotremes , Marsupials , and Mammals , and is interesting as being in the two latter independent of any visibly increased activity on the part of the animals .
In all the animals experimented with , except the lizards , the minimum production of C02 occurred at or about 30 ' C. This has been found to be the case with the higher Mammals and with man.f This minimum production calculated in relation to body sufface is , as may be seen in the charts ( figs. 4 , 5 ) , different in the three groups of animals .

temp. deg. Cent. Throughout the range of temperature 5 ' to 35 ' C. oxidation is less energetic in the Monotremes and Marsupials ( see figs. 4 and 5 ) than in the higher Mammals .
This difference is most marked at the temperature at which the minimum production occurs .
Such economy can be accounted for by\#151 ; ( 1 .
) Diminished loss of heat , by better insulation , or less evaporation from skin and lungs .
( 2 .
) A lower body-temperature .
( 3 .
) Failure to maintain a constant body-temperature .
I have already shown that none of the animals maintained a constant body-temperature throughout the experimental range .
The Marsupials , however , kept their temperature more constant than the rabbit , though less so than the cat .
Imperfect homoeothermic adjustment cannot explain this relative economy on their part , It is , I believe , largely due to their better insulation , though the fact that their average body-temperature is 2 lower than that of At animals will account for it to a small extent .
This explanation certainly does not explain the small heat production of Echidna , which is covered with spines and coarse hairs which do not afford a good insulation .
One must accordingly look to their low temperatures ( under 30 ' ) and defective homoeothermism for an explanation .
Fig. 6 is a graphic representation of the relation of C03 production to the difference in temperature Fig. 6 .

Difference in temp. \amp ; and environment in degrees Cent. between animal and environment for the three groups of animals .
By representing the experimental data in this way the effect of the comparatively low and varying body-temperature of Echidna is eliminated .
In the curve for Echidnas it will be RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE TN MONOTREMES AND MARSUPIALS .
seen that with a difference in temperature of 20-25 ' C. between animal and environment the production of Echidna is nearly equal to that of the Mammals .
Imperfect homceothermism is economical of energy .
With a specific heat of '8 , 800 calories per kilogramme is saved to an animal by allowing its own temperature to fall 1 ' C. instead of maintaining it by increased production of heat .
The respiratory quotient for Echidna was found to be '88 , and I have calculated that this amount of energy ( 800 calories ) would necessitate an amount of combustion of its food represented by about *3 gramme of C(X.# Comparison of Behaviour and CO.z production of , and Mammals at Temperatures above 30 ' C. Above 30 ' C. the 002 production increases .
This is accompanied in the higher Mammals by panting .

37 over 200 The respirations of the Marsupials were little affected by the warm temperatures , and the Monotremes breathed decidedly more slowly and less deeply than when in cooler air ( see Details of Experiments ) .
The increased oxidation of Monotremes and Marsupials cannot therefore be the expression of increased work done in respiratory movements , whereby the higher Mammals assist in the adjustment of their temperature ( Rubner 's physical regulation ) by operating as refrigerating machines , but must be due to the higher body-temperature which they invariably had when in air above 30 ' C. I imagine they have a critical temperature just as is seen in cold-blooded animals , and that when this is reached increased oxidation occurs independent of activity .
All the Monotremes and Marsupials with which I have experimented became less and less active as the temperature rose , and displayed a minimum of activity at 35 to 40 ' , often culminating in fainting .
Nevertheless the C02 produced increased from 30 to 35 ' and from 35 to 40 ' .
This refrigerating mechanism is of very considerable value in animals covered with an insulating fur , and not freely supplied with sweat glands , as the dog .
In one of RlCHET'sf experiments a dog evaporated 11 grammes of water per kilogramme per * For this calculation , it was assumed that the oxygen in the foodstuffs has already oxidised the hydrogen and not the carbon .
This is , of course , not the case , but gives an approximate result only .
On this assumption the energy dissipated by oxidation of 1 gramme butter is 4 per cent , too high ; of 1 gramme casein , 4 per cent , too low ; of 1 gramme lactose , 12 per cent. low .

hour ( = 6000 calories ) by the respiration , three times the amount of heat normally produced .
I conclude that this power to lose heat is absent in Monotremes and little evident in Marsupials , which no doubt accounts in large measure for the fact that when heated in the chamber they so readily suffered from heat apoplexy , as their range of adaptation is thereby curtailed .
If the body-temperature rises to 35 ' in Platypus and 37c in Echidna they very soon die , showing that the maximum consistent with life is lower than is the case with the higher animals .
In this respect I may mention an observation of Chapman's* that the muscle of Echidna , which retains its vitality after excision much as reptilian or amphibian muscle , lost its irritability immediately after its temperature was raised to 35 ' C. Comparison of the Effect of Cold upon the production of C0.2 in Relation to the Minimum Production in Monotremes , , and .
The general effect of lowering the temperature of the environment upon the COo produced by the different groups of Mammals is graphically represented in the charts ( figs. 4 and 5 ) .
These curves show that the oxidation in Echidna increases rapidly and in a regular manner as the external temperature is lowered .
With Marsupials and Mammals this increase is less until 10 ' is reached , when it becomes much more marked .
In many respects the curve for Platypus is between that of Echidna and Marsupials , whilst the curve for Marsupials approaches in character that of Mammals .
For comparative purposes , it is instructive if the production of C02 found in the experiments is plotted as ordinates against the difference in temperature between animal and environment as abscissae .
This takes into account the fact that the temperature of the different animals is itself varying , and to a different degree , in the various groups of animals .
This was done for each experiment from the data tabulated on pp. 22\#151 ; 24 .
From such curves an average curve for the three Echidnas , three Marsupials , and two Mammals was derived by taking the values for a difference of temperature of 5 , 10 , 15 ' C. , \amp ; c. , as indicated by the individual curves and averaging them .
These average curves are represented in fig. 6 , and the data from which they were drawn are given in tabular form below .

F These tables show that the actual increase in oxidation as the difference in temperature between animal and environment increases , is at first very much less in Marsupials and Mammals than in Echidna , hut reaches or exceeds that of the latter animals , when this difference becomes greater .
The contrast is more striking when expressed as the percentage increase in C02 produced when the difference in temperature between animal and environment varies from 10 ' to 20 ' C. This is for Echidnas .
Platypus .
Marsupials Mammals 72 per cent. 59 " 50 " This indicates that the importance of variation in heat-production as a means of temperature adjustment within this range diminishes in the above order , and that whereas variation in production is uniformly employed by Echidnas , in Ornithor-hynchus , Marsupials , and Mammals , other means of regulation must be utilised .
A glance at the curves , fig. 6 , will also show that , with the exception of Echidna , variation in production grows gradually in importance as the difference in temperature between the animal and environment increases , and , further , that in higher Mammals variation in production is comparatively trivial until the conditions become sufficiently favourable to heat loss .
The higher Mammals evidently produce a much larger quantity of heat per unit surface at all temperatures than Marsupials and Monotremes , and rely upon dissipating the balance when not wanted to keep ujj their body-temperature .
The lower Mammals are much more economical , and tend more to increase their expenditure of energy only as required .
In this respect Echidna is the most thrifty .
The actual expenditure of Echidna is , for a difference of 20 ' between his body-temperature and the air , greater than Marsupials ; but it must be remembered that his insulation is very much poorer .
According to the results of Senator , * Speck , !
and LoewyJ Man utilises variation in production still less until loss of heat becomes excessive .
With a very considerable variation in external temperature Loewy found the oxygen consumed by man remained the same in more than half his experiments , and that if voluntary movements were restrained , the heat production was not increased until the loss of heat occasioned shivering and involuntary rigidity of muscles .
Apart from modifying insulation in the form of clothes , the machinery for varying heat-loss is more extensively developed in man on account of the much larger surface for sweating .

RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE IN MONOTREMES AND MARSUPIALS .
In [ fig. 5 I have represented the C03 production per 1000 sq .
centims. of a man with environment at different temperatures for comparison with that of Mammals and Marsupials .
The curve was drawn from calculations from Voit's* data .
These are the only figures which I know where the experiment was conducted upon the human subject under conditions similar to my experiments , viz. , in a chamber supplied with cooled or warmed air .
The C02 produced varied little when the temperature of the air was changed from 14 ' to 27 ' C. Investigation of Echidna for Evidence of Temperatur other than by Variation in Production .
Marsupials are fairly well supplied with sweat-glands .
Ornithorhynchus possesses .
an abundant supply upon the soft snout and frill , but none elsewhere .
In Echidna I could find none .
To test whether Echidna varied heat-loss by vaso-motor adjustment , I shaved the coarse hair from the feet and ankles of two specimens of Echidna and secured them in two bottles , one of which I filled with water at 40 ' C. , and the other at 0 ' .
I could detect no difference in the colour of the two for several minutes , then the foot in the cold water became redder than the other .
I have tried to obtain evidence on this point in another way .
I placed Echidnas in a metal box in the ice-chest ( temp. 2-3 ' O. ) for several hours .
Their body temperatures slowly fell ; but , notwithstanding that they stood upon the cold iron , their feet remained warm and were only 2'-3 ' C. lower than their rectal temperatures .
When I myself grasped the metal box my fingers soon became blanched and cold .
It appears that Echidna is devoid of both sweat-mechanism and vaso-motor adjustment of superficial circulation in response to temperature .
This was suggested by the fact that the production of C02 was so nearly directly proportional to the difference in temperature between the animal and environment , in other words , was proportional to loss of heat .
Without means of losing heat by evaporation from the skin , or of increasing evaporation from the lungs by additional respirations , Echidna is incapable of adapting itself to an environment the temperature of which is above 35'-37 ' C. , for it cannot reduce its heat-production below a certain minimum which is itself dependent upon the body-temperature .
When exposed to a temperature of 35 ' C. its body-temperature soon rises above the physiological maximum ( about 38 ' C. ) , this causes further heat-production , and it dies of heat apoplexy .
This happened twice in the course of these experiments , and I have had unwelcome evidence of the same during the hot weather we sometimes have in Melbourne .
On four occasions when the hot weather has been sufficiently prolonged for the temperature of the box in which they were kept to rise to 37 ' C. , my Echidnas have succumbed .

PROFESSOR C. J. MARTIN ON THERMAL ADJUSTMENT AND Adjustment of temperature by variation in production is economical , but , like most economies , has its disadvantages , since it greatly curtails , as just seen , the range of temperature in which an Echidna can live .
In their natural state these animals burrow several feet into the ground , and on hot days only emerge after sundown .
This curtailment of their range of temperature is not the only disadvantage attendant upon their disability to vary loss of heat .
The production of heat will obviously increase with muscular work , so that their temperature is not independent of activity .
I have frequently observed their temperatures rise a degree or two after digging .
The following is an instance :\#151 ; Echidna .
Weight , 3350 grammes .
Temperature of air , 19 ' C. Temperature of earth , 8 inches below surface , 16 ' *5 C. The earth was damp .
12.15 .
Temperature of Echidna , 32'T C. Commenced to dig in a desultory way .
He was kept to the task by scratching his hack with a stick .
He was not allowed to cover himself , but , when he had dug a hole about 10 inches in depth , he was removed to another situation and persuaded to dig again .
12.50 .
Temperature , 33''7 C. In 35 minutes his temperature had risen 1''6 C. , notwithstanding the cool damp earth in which he was working .
The amount of work necessary to raise the temperature of his body 1''6 , assuming that his specific heat = '8 ' is , independent of heat lost , 1819 kilogramme metres .
Conclusions .
Echidna is the lowest in the scale of warm-blooded animals .
Its attempts at homoeothermism fail to the extent of 10 ' C. when the environment varies from 5 ' to 35 ' C. During the cold weather Echidna abandons all attempts at homa3othermism and hibernates for four months , during which time its temperature is only a few tenths of a degree above that of its surroundings .
The production of heat in Echidna is proportional to the difference in temperature between animal and environment .
At high temperatures Echidna does not increase the number or depth of its respirations .
It possesses no sweat glands , and exhibits no evidence of varying loss of heat by vaso-motor adjustment of superficial vessels in response to external temperature .
Ornithorhynchus is a distinct advance upon Echidna ; although its body temperature is low it maintains it fairly constant .
It possesses abundant sweat glands upon the soft snout and frill but none elsewhere .
The C02 production with varying RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE IN MONOTREMES AND MARSUPIALS .
temperature of environment indicates that the animal can modify heat-loss as well as production .
Ornithorhynchus does not increase respirations at high temperatures .
Marsupials show evidence of utilising variation in loss to an extent greater than Ornithorhynchus , but less than higher Mammals .
Their respirations are sometimes slightly increased in number at high temperatures .
Higher Mammals depend principally upon variations in heat-loss , and do not greatly increase production of heat until subjected to an environment 25 ' to 30 ' below their own body temperatures .
At high temperatures they assist in dissipating heat by rapid respiration .
Variation in production of heat is the ancestral method of homoeothermic adjustment .
During the evolution of the warm-blooded animal it has , through developing a mechanism by means of which it can vary production in accordance with heat lost , overcome one disadvantage of cold-bloodedness , viz. , that activity is dependent upon external temperature .
It has thereby increased its range in the direction of low temperatures .
Later , by developing a mechanism controlling loss of heat , it has increased its range in the direction of high temperatures , and also rendered body-temperature largely independent of activity .
These advantages have been gained by a greater expenditure of energy .
