Introduction .
In the Western Midlands of England and along the Welsh Borderland a series of coalfields occurs parallel to the course of the Biver Severn , and , for the most part , situated to the West of that river .
The main links in this chain begin in the North with the Shrewsbury coalfield .
Next follows the Le Botwood area , then Coalbrook-dale and the Wyre Forest .
Further still to the South is the little coalfield of Newent in Gloucestershire .
This line terminates in the Forest of Dean and Bristol coalfields .
In addition , a few detached areas of coal measures , of which the Clee Hills are the most important , lie further to the West .
To the North of Shrewsbury , the line is continued by the Denbighshire ( Wrexham ) and the Flintshire coalfields , both situated for the most part to the West of the Dee .
There is little doubt that the coalfields lying along this line , roughly North and South , are not all related to one another , either stratigraphically or tectonically .
We are concerned here with the fields beginning with the Shrewsbury and ending with the Newent areas , and more especially with that of the Wyre Forest .
We may at once exclude from primary consideration the Forest of Dean and Bristol fields in the South , and the Dee Valley coalfields in the North , as being quite unrelated , at least stratigraphically , to the Wyre Forest .
The Shrewsbury , Le Botwood , Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest coal-bearing areas , which as I hope to show here are related , have been sometimes described as the Severn Valley coalfields .
I prefer , however , to speak of them , as on former occasions , as the Welsh Borderland chain of coalfields .
By the former term one would naturally imagine that the Forest of Dean and Bristol coalfields should be included , whereas these more Southern areas are not really cognate to the Welsh Borderland system .
The Wyre Forest coalfield , the Northern half of which lies in Shropshire , and the Southern in Worcestershire , * is a southerly continuation of Coalbrookdale ( see * Tb\#174 ; extreme \#169 ; astern limit falls within Staffordshire , DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
365 map , p. 367 ) .
The outerop of the so-called grey measures of the two coalfields is in fact continuous near Bridgnorth , where , however , it is very narrow , being only a few hundred yards across .
The red rocks of the Permians ( so-called ) are , however , continuous over a very much wider area .
In Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest we are in fact dealing with a single area , but this is of so large an extent , and the geology of the northern half is so very different from that of the southern that it is more than a matter of convenience to subdivide the whole region into two natural areas\#151 ; Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest .
We shall have to discuss in some detail , at a later stage , the relationships of these two districts .
As we shall see from the historical sketch , which forms the next section of this paper , the geology of the Wyre Forest is very complicated , and at present very little understood .
This is largely due to the fact that the Forest , regarded from a coal-winning standpoint , is only a minor coalfield , and consequently but little attention has been devoted to the elucidation of its structure .
It has not been my intention to investigate this area from a purely geological point of view , nor indeed has the time necessary for such a gigantic task , if undertaken single-handed , been at my disposal .
My object has , however , been to ascertain what light the study of the fossil floras of the productive measures of the Wyre Forest throws on its geology , and especially on the question of its relationship to the Midland and Pennine coalfields .
As we shall see , this line of inquiry has not previously been pursued in this area .
Further I have confined my attention , for the present , to the productive or so-called grey measures , and I have not concerned myself with the red rocks of the so-called " Lower Permian , " which there is some reason to believe are of Upper Coal Measure or Keele age .
The fact that the Wyre Forest is but little worked for coal , and that a considerable portion of it is densely forested , has naturally implied that the chances of obtaining exposures of the Coal Measures , adequate for the purposes of fossil plant collecting , are strictly limited .
As the result of several weeks ' work during the last three years , I have managed to obtain a fairly representative collection of fossil plants from different parts of the Forest , and these will be found described here .
In part of this work I have had the help of the expert collecting of Mr. I. Rogers , to whom , as on other occasions , I am indebted for unearthing many excellent examples of the flora .
I would here also express my thanks to those who have aided me by permission to collect on their property , and in this respect I am particularly indebted to the owners or managers of all the collieries which are now at work in the Forest .
I would particularly mention in this connection the kindness of Mr. F. Whitworth Wright of Bay ton , Mr. C. W. Roberts of Wollaston Hall and Mr. L. E. P. Russ of Billingsley Colliery , to whose help I am under considerable obligations .
I further desire to thank those who have aided my work by much valuable information on the subjects discussed in this paper , and I would especially mention in this connection Prof. Lapworth , F.B.S. , Mr. F. G. Meachem , F.G.S. , Mr. Henry Kay , F.G.S. , and Mr. W. Wickham King , F.G.S. 2 .
A Geological and Historical Sketch of our Knowledge of the Wyre Forest Coalfield .
So little information exists as to the geology of this coalfield as a whole , that it will be necessary in this instance to deal with this subject more fully than is usually needed in a paper which is chiefly of paleeobotanical interest .
The Wyre Forest Coalfield is , as we have seen , continuous in the North near Bridgnorth with that of Coalbrookdale ( see map , p. 367).# Between that town and a point about 2 miles south-west of the Abberley Hills , a distance from North to South of roughly 18 miles , we find a tract of Coal Measures of varying breadth with an area of about 35,000 acres .
This is known as the Wyre Forest , or the Forest of Wyre , or sometimes as the Bewdley coalfield .
I have ascertained that the beds in different parts of this area belong to different horizons , and in view of this fact and of our present very imperfect knowledge of the geology of the district , it is essential to distinguish clearly between four regions in the Wyre Forest .
These I propose to term the Highley , Dowles Valley , Shatter-ford and Mamble regions .
The Highley Region may be taken to include the whole of the Northern part of the coalfield , from the neighbourhood of Bridgnorth as far South as an imaginary East and West line drawn parallel to the Howies Brook , and about 1 mile to the North of it ( see map , p. 367 ) .
This area on the East is bounded by the Severn , on the West by Old Bed Sandstone .
In the North the productive measures are largely overlain by the so-called Permians .
The width of the outerop of the former increases towards the South , and is believed to reach its maximum along a line drawn roughly East and West through the Kinlet doleritic intrusion and Upper Arley .
The Dowles Valley Region may be taken to include the measures lying South of an East and West line about 1 mile to the North of the Dowles Brook ( or the first five miles of the Bewdley\#151 ; Cleobury Mortimer railway line , West of Dowles Bridge ) .
It extends as far South as the Old Bed Sandstone boundary and the Mamble Begion .
It is believed to be connected with the latter only by a narrow neck near Church Hill .
To the North , the Dowles Valley Begion is perfectly continuous with the Highley , and to the North-east with the Shatterford area .
On the East and Southeast it is bounded by the Trimpley anticline and Triassic rocks , on the West by Old Bed Sandstone .
The so-called Permians only occur in this region in the extreme South-east , at Stagbury Hill near Areley Kings .
The Shatterford Region ( see map , p. 367 ) includes the whole of the coalfield which * * In the map on p. 367 the rocks indicated as " Younger than Coal Measures " include the Lower Permian , so-called , which is possibly of Keele or Upper Coal Measure age .

lies to the East of the Severn Valley , from the neighbourhood of Quatt and Claverley in the North , as far South as the Trimpley anticline and Bewdley .
By far the greater part of the measures in this district belong to the red-rock series of the Upper Coal Measures = " Lower Permian .
" The outerop of the so-called Grey Measures , to the North of Bewdley and in the neighbourhood of Upper Arley , Shatterford , and Starts Green , is very narrow and irregular .
They are bounded on the North , and to some extent on the East , by the " Lower Permian .
" The Trimpley anticline of Old Bed Sandstone and Silurian occurs in their midst , and they apparently surround it on all sides except on the East , where for a short space the Trias overlies the Old Bed Sandstone ( see map , p. 367 ) .
The MambleRegion extends from a short distance to the North of Church Hill as far South as the Abberley Hills , and for 2 miles to the West , beyond them .
As mapped by the Survey this region is of very irregular shape , and is cut off from the rest of the coalfield , with the exception of the narrow neck already mentioned , by which it is united with the Dowles Valley area .
This region is otherwise surrounded on all sides by Old Bed Sandstone , except where it abuts against the older Palaeozoics of the Abberley Hills .
The only so-called Permians found here are those seen at Church Hill .
In the present paper I propose to discuss the fossil floras of three of these areas , the Highley , Dowles Valley , and Mamble regions .
I have not examined the small area of grey measures in the Shatterford district , because I am not aware that , owing to the absence of coal pits , there are any exposures at present which are at all adequate for the task of fossil plant collecting .
What is known , however , of this region will be here included in the discussion of the relationships of this coalfield .
As I have already pointed out , the general stratigraphy of the Wyre Forest is very little understood at the present time , and until the area has been re-mapped on the 6-inch scale , a labour involving many years ' work , it is likely to remain so .
" I am here only concerned with the essential and broader features , and from this standpoint I will now review the very scanty literature bearing on this coalfield , afterwards gathering together the principal points relating to the four regions here adopted temporarily .
The earliest geological reference to this coalfield is , I believe , the brief notice by England* which appeared in 1834 .
England 's account was , however , quite overshadowed by the full description of this coalfield included by Murchison , !
in 1839 , in his ' Silurian System .
' The Geological Survey Maps , which are now in need of urgent revision , appear to have been published , under de la Beche'sJ direction , between 1852 and 1855 .
No Survey memoir on this coalfield has , however , * England ( 34 ) .

t 1-Inch Survey Sheets , 61 S.E. and 55 N.E. DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
369 appeared .
Some very brief reference to it is , however , given in one of the earlier Survey Memoirs by John Phillips , * published in 1848 .
Next we have several brief but important references to the geology , and more especially the fossil flora of the coalfield , by Roberts !
between 1858 and 1862 , and several contributions on the geology by Daniel JonesJ between 1871 and 1873 .
The latter authorS also contributed a further valuable paper in 1894 .
In 1895 Mr. Cantrill's|| memoir was published , and this is , no doubt , the most important contribution to our knowledge of this coalfield since the days of Murchison 's ' Silurian System .
' In more recent years the productive measures have attracted but little attention .
Studies have been made , however , of the so-called Permian rocks .
Mr. CantrillH has discussed the " Lower Permian " of the Shatterford District , and Mr. Wickham King** has elucidated the Middle and Upper Permians of Enville and the neighbourhood .
Important references to the geology of the Wyre Forest are also contained in papers by Clarke , ft Spackman^ Randall , SS Groom , |||| and Lapworth and Watts . ! !
Finally we have the brief records of the Claverley Boring published by the Geological Survey in 1905 and 1906 , *** and the detailed account which has quite recently been published by Dr. Gibson.tft The General Geology .
Before reviewing the main points , already ascertained , of the geology of the four regions of this coalfield , a few words may be first added as to the essential features of the productive measures as a whole .
The Wyre Forest has naturally been interpreted in terms of Coalbrookdale , with which it is continuous .
In the latter coalfield ( see p. 411 ) we find a lower series , containing the " Sweet Coals " and ironstones , and a higher sequence , unproductive either of iron or of coal , with the exception of a few thin " Sulphur Seams .
" The two series are unconformable to one another , the unconformity being termed the * Phillips ( 48 ) , pp. 158-159 .

Symond fault , an unfortunate name .
In the Wyre Forest matters are very different .
A lower series is present , corresponding to the Sweet Coals of Coalbrookdale , but this series is apparently regarded as confined to a very limited portion of the district which is here termed the Highley Region .
The measures there are productive , and in large part are overlain , it is believed unconformably , by a higher series , as at Coalbrookdale .
It has been thought that the other regions of the Wyre Forest , as well as a considerable part of that of Highley , contain only the equivalents of the higher series of Coalbrookdale , which here , however , are in part at least productive .
It has thus been customary for many years past to speak of the lower series in the Wyre Forest as the " Sweet Coals/ 'and the upper as the " Sulphur or Stinking Coals .
" Both series have been worked probably for more than a century .
The " Sulphur Coals " are said to resemble those spoken of by that name in the Shrewsbury and South Staffordshire coalfields .
It should , however , be remarked that some of the Sulphur coals of the Mamble Region are of good quality and find a ready market , and are by no means as valueless as the term Sulphur coals is usually taken to imply .
It has also been known for many years past that bands of ^S^rorfo's-limestone are associated with the Sulphur Coal Series .
Such bands have been recognised in all the four regions into which the coalfield is here temporarily sub-divided .
I now pass to a concise account of the present state of our knowledge of the four regions of the Wyre Forest .
After reviewing in each case the results obtained by previous workers I will add , where possible , such additional information as I have been able to gather on these matters .
Detailed Geo. ( a ) The Highley Region-\#151 ; It has been known for more than a century that parallel outerops of coals occur near the Western boundary of this district .
The Survey Map shows two such seams extending from Glazeley southward to Billingsley , and two others , more to the West , from Billingsley to Kinlet Knowl , and again further South at Baveney Wood .
It must not , however , be imagined that these are the outerops of the same seams .
As a matter of fact these coals do not all belong to the same series of measures .
Those furthest to the North belong to the Sulphur Coal Measures , while the rest are Sweet Coals.# According to Jones , f the Sweet Coals crop out only in the Western portion of the field .
Elsewhere they are always overlain unconformably by the Sulphur Coal Series .
We will first examine a case where the Sulphur Coals are alone present , the Sweet Coals apparently being absent .
This lies in the Northern part of the region at * * See the maps in Jones ( 94 ) , Plate 14 , and Cantrill ( 951 ) , map at end .

371 Chelmarsh Common as described by Murchison.* Three seams were here proved , the middle one being 22 inches thick and the lower 2 feet 6 inches in thickness .
Both England !
and Murchison^ pointed out that a bed of \gt ; S^Vor6\amp ; *s-limestone , 18 inches thick , occurs between the two lower coals , and this is believed to be generally the case throughout the coalfieldS wherever these coals are present , though here and there the evidence is lacking .
The coals are believed to lie only a short distance above the Old Bed Sandstone .
In the case of a boring at Prior 's Moor ( see p. 375 ) , put down quite recently by the Billingsley Colliery Company , the same Sulphur Coal Series was proved resting on Old Bed Sandstone .
The Sweet Coals crop out to the West between High Green and Kinlet , and were formerly worked at Harcott Pit ( see map , p. 367 ) , of which the following section is somewhat condensed from that given by Jones|| in 1894 :\#151 ; Harcott Pit Section .

At the present time the Sweet Coals are being worked beneath the Sulphur Coals at three collieries\#151 ; Billingsley , Highley and Kinlet Collieries , all in the Northern part of the Highley Region .
As some of the fossil plants described here are derived from the Sweet Coal Series of these collieries , it may be well to discuss the sections of each pit as briefly as possible .

The first point to be noticed in comparing these sections is the very unequal thickness of barren measures between the Sulphur and the Sweet Coals .
Approaching the outerop from Kinlet Pit , where these rocks are 465 feet thick , and 477 feet at Highley Pit , we find that , at Billingsley Colliery , they are only 227 feet in thickness , and that , if William Smith 's section is correct , at Billingsley Engine Pit , only 152 feet thick .
At Harcott , the Sweet Coals crop out .
The Sweet Coals thus , obviously , lie in a fold , and the simplest explanation of the whole matter doubtless is that an unconformity exists between the Sulphur and the Sweet Coal Series .
At present , however , owing to the very small number of sections and pits existing in the Wyre Forest , it is not possible to demonstrate the fact by a careful correlation of pit sections , as has been done in Coalbrookdale by Clarke* and Scott.f On the other hand , it does not seem possible to explain these facts by reference to faults .
Faults of greater or lesser importance undoubtedly occur in the Wyre Forest , as in all coalfields , though very little is known about them at the present time , and , except in one or two cases in the Highley District , they are not apparently of much importance or dominant as regards the structure of the coalfield , so far as can be ascertained at present .
Very little attention has hitherto been paid to the lithology of the Wyre Forest measures , but from the descriptions of the rocks passed through in borings and sinkings it is obvious that they are very varied as regards their physical characters .
Sandstones occur occasionally , though not , as a rule , in beds of any great thickness .
A bed 84 feet thick was , however , passed through in the present Billingsley Shaft , and one of 68 feet at Kinlet .
Massive sandstones crop out to the South-east of Kinlet Park , as recorded by Murchison.^ On the other hand , there is little doubt that the dominant rocks throughout the coalfield are shales and clays , both often called marls , which vary in colour from brown , red or green to blue and black , and are sometimes described as mottled .
Occasional fireclays and ironstones also occur .
I have had opportunities of seeing a considerable number of natural sections , as well as cores , from this coalfield , and the conclusion at which I have arrived is that the dominant rock , both of the Sulphur and Sweet Coal Series , is a coloured shale or clay .
These beds may be chocolate coloured , or fairly bright red or green , or mottled with patches of green on a red ground , or versed .
The subsidiary types are black or blue shales , white clays ( clunches ) , dark earthy clays ( clods ) , sandstones , fireclays , ironstones , and espleys .
The dominant type prevails above and below both the Sulphur and the Sweet Coals , but the rocks associated with the coals themselves are almost invariably the subsidiary grey types , and consequently these are alone seen on the waste heaps of the collieries .
I have studied the rocks of the Sulphur Coal Series in several localities .
In 1912 the Billingsley Colliery Company put down a short boring by the side of the Borle Brook , close to the ford at New England .
The rocks passed through here belonged to the Sulphur Coal Series , and consisted of chocolate-coloured or variegated marls with some beds of sandy shale .
No Espleys or / SpfcVorfoVlimestones were , however , observed here .

DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
375 I also had an opportunity of seeing part of another set of cores , belonging to the same Company , from a boring put down at Prior 's Moor , a half mile South of Billingsley Colliery .
This boring penetrated the Sulphur Coal Series , and Mr. Meachem informs me ended in Old Bed Sandstone .
Here again coloured and variegated shales were dominant , and Espley rocks also occurred .
One fossil plant , furcata Brongn .
, was obtained from these beds of the Sulphur Coal Series .
In a quarry recently re-opened by the Billingsley Colliery Company , close to New England , and South of the ford over the Borle Brook , 50 feet of massive , yellowish grey sandstones are seen , and , near by , thin sandstones and chocolate-coloured shales are exposed in a new railway cutting .
From what I have seen of the beds above the Sulphur Coals , I conclude that they consist partly of a red , and partly of a grey series , in which Espley rocks and possibly limestones occur .
I have not in this district had any opportunities of studying the beds above and below the Sweet Coals , except those closely associated with the seams themselves .
The latter consist of well-laminated grey shales , often with much ironstone , of carbonaceous shale ( batt ) , of dark clod , and tough white clay ( clunch ) , but no red rocks .
The material to be found on the waste heaps of Billingsley , Highley and Kinlet Collieries , derived from close proximity to the Sweet Coals and from a very limited vertical range , is identical , and agrees in this respect .
( b ) The Dowles Valley Region\#151 ; Very little is known of the geology of this district at present .
The Survey Maps show outerops of seams at Kings wood and Win woods in the North , and at Prizeley in the South-west .
With the exception of a very few thin seams near Bewdley and Areley Kings , * no other coals are known in this region .
Murchisonf regarded the unproductive measures South of Bewdley as representing merely " the lower grits J and conglomerates of the series .
" During the last half century several borings have been put down along the line of the Dowles Brook , but no workable seams were met with in any case .
These borings ( from East to West ) were situated at Town Mill and Coventry Mill ( these two not very far apart ) , and Furnace Mill ( more than 2 miles West of Cooper 's Mill ) , the latter penetrating through 804 feet of sediments ( see map , p. 367 ) .
The deepest of these borings was that at Town Mill , which in the " seventies " penetrated 1150 feet .
Within the last two years fresh borings have been made along the line of the Dowles Brook , and to the South .
Alton No. 1 boring ( see map , p. 367 ) was situated close to the South side of the railway line , about 1^ miles East of Wyre Forest Station , and not very far to the West of Cooper 's Mill .
This boring reached * Jones ( 94 ) , p. 300 , discovered a $)nr0r\amp ; is-limestone and Sulphur Coal seam at Areley Kings , in the extreme South-east of the district .

\ Roberts ( 601 ) , p. 135 , mentions thick beds of sandstone near Bewdley and in Dowles Quarry .
a depth of 1102 feet 8 inches .
By the kindness of Mr. C. W. Roberts , of Stourbridge , I have had an opportunity of examining the completed cores .
They consist throughout of red or green or chocolate-coloured clays or marls , sometimes mottled , sometimes sandy , with occasional thin bands of typical " Espley Green Grits .
" Thin beds of grey , well-laminated shales , and of yellow or grey sandstones , and occasionally conglomerates also occur .
From the shales I was able to obtain a number of plant remains , which will he found discussed in Section 4 .
These show that the rocks belong unmistakably to the Sweet Coal Series .
Another and shorter boring ( Alton No. 2 ) was put down at the same time in the Forest , about a mile South of Alton No. 1 , but this penetrated for only a few hundred feet .
The rocks , however , were precisely similar to those proved by Alton No. 1 , and no coal was found in either boring .
The absence of coal in this district is remarkable , seeing that the Sulphur , if not the Sweet Coals lie not very far to the North , and that Sulphur Coals are worked at no great distance to the South .
( c ) The Shatter/ ord Region\#151 ; Murchison* briefly noticed the occurrence of coal near Shatterford , and also the presence of an intrusive dolerite dyke in its neighbourhood .
Attempts to win the coals on a small scale were followed , between 1850 and 1860 , by a deep sinking and boring at Shatterford , of which Roberts has given a full and valuable record , f This exploration penetrated about 1360 feet , and ended in a dolerite or basalt .
In the upper portion , to a depth of 530 feet , seven thin seams , varying from 6 inches to 2 feet 8 inches , were proved .
These we will call the upper series of coals .
Next followed some 625 feet of barren ground , and then a lower coal series , containing two seams , the thickest of which was 1 foot 1 inch .
Special attention may be called to the varied nature of the measures .
Not only are shales , fireclays , clays , sandstones , and conglomerates recorded , but we have also mottled , red , blue , green , and yellow marls and measures .
There is also record of a blueish rock ( gritty ) , which may possibly have been an Espley sandstone .
There is frequent mention of marls in the record of this boring , and in one position , in the upper coal series , of limestone balls ( ?
the \gt ; Sp\#163 ; Vorfo's-limestone ) .
Roberts does not attempt to identify either the upper or the lower coal series with the Sulphur or Sweet Coals of other parts of the coalfield .
He says , however , " the section obtained may be regarded as an index to nearly the whole of the coal measures of the forest of Wyre."| * Murchison ( 39 ) , pp. 133-4 .

28 \#151 ; 1359 1 Jones# states that the upper coal series probably belongs to the Upper Coal Measures , but points out the difficulty of comparing the lower coals with the Sweet Coals of Highley and Harcott , owing to the great thickness of barren ground between the two series .
Cantrlll , f on the other hand , has arrived at an opposite conclusion .
After some discussion of the matter , he says ; " I am inclined to believe that the greater part , if not the whole of the Shatterford beds below the Bench ( main sulphur ) coal are barren Middle measures\#151 ; the thin coals found therein being the diminutive representatives of the sweet coals of Harcott and Highley .
The bulk of the ground along the Dowles Valley , and for some distance on either side of it , is in the same barren series , and will prove to be Middle Coal Measures .
" At the present time there are no fresh explorations in progress in the narrow strip of Coal Measures of the Shatterford area , and I have thus nothing further to add in the way of new facts .
The matter will be found further discussed , however , on p. 409 .
The Claverley Boring.\#151 ; The Claverley Boring , 5 miles South-east of Bridgnorth , and lij miles South of Claverley , was completed in 1905 , and a full account of this boring has recently been published by Dr. Walcot Gibson4 This remains the only * Jones ( 94 ) , p. 299 .

( d ) The Mamble Region\#151 ; Coal has been worked in the high-lying Mamble Begion for more than a century past , and is still being worked there to-day on a small scale .
Only two or three seams , however , are of any thickness .
These coals lie not very far above the Old Bed Sandstone , and a band of ^Sp^rorfo's-limestone is associated with them .
As mapped by the Survey , and in view of more recent discoveries , * there is no reason to doubt that the rocks of this district occupy a very irregularly shaped synclinal fold , the boundaries of which are natural crops , and not faults .
It has been found possible to trace either the coals or the limestone bands round almost the whole margin of the basin .
These coal seams have always been called Sulphur Coals , though some of them are of good quality .
They have also been regarded , since the time of Murchison , as being the same seams as the Sulphur Coals of the High ley Begion , and have also been correlated with the Sulphur ( Upper ) Coals of Coalbrookdale and the coals of the Le Botwood and Shrewsbury coalfields .
We will first consider the coal-bearing rocks at Bay ton , Mamble , and Pensax , which are still being worked , and from which the fossil plants recorded on * Roberts ( 601 ) , p. 136 ; Jones ( 711 ) .

379 p. 388 were obtained .
This series appears to be often overlain by thick , white or yellow sandstones , 50 feet thick at Mamble , but considerably thicker at Pensax .
In this respect the series resembles the Sulphur Coals at Billingsley in the Highley District .
The beds immediately associated with the coals consist of a series of chinches , stiff , grey , unlaminated clays , with occasional beds of ironstone and conglomerates .
The lowest seam of coal , the Main Sulphur or Hard Coal , is usually the thickest , and yields the best coal .
It , however , rarely exceeds 2 feet 6 inches in thickness .
The so-called S^rorfo's-limestone lies between it and the Brockholes or Brock Hall Seam , but nearer to the former .
The seams are often split by the interpolation of masses of carbonaceous shale or batt ( often called " dirt " ) , which reduce the workable thickness very considerably .
At Bayton , Mamble , and Buckets Leasow the pits are shallow , while at Hollins Colliery , Pensax , they are much deeper .
The section given by Phillips* of the Mamble Pit may be taken as typical .

No. 7 is now generally termed the Three-quarter-yard Seam , and this with the Hard Coal are the chief , if not the only coals now worked at Bayton , Mamble , and Hollins Colliery , Pensax ( see map , p. 367 ) .
The fossil plants described here from the Bayton , Buckets Leasow , and Pensax pits , all come from the clunches above and below the three-quarter-yard and hard coals .
At the Beehive Colliery ( about two-thirds of a mile North-west of Abberley ) , now disused , two coals , of a foot or less in thickness , occur in a series of clunches .
These , no doubt , are the representatives of the two coals worked at Mamble and Pensax , which thin rapidly to the East and South .
In fact the reasons why the coals on the eastern side of the district have always proved unprofitable are not only the excessive faulting found in this district , but the thinning of the seams , as traced from West to East .
We now turn to inquire what are the characters of the rocks which lie above the * Phillips ( 48 ) , p. 158 .
3 c 2 Sulphur Coal Series in the centre of the basin in the Mamble Region .
No new explorations in this part of the field have been made in recent years , and I have not been able to examine any borings or sinkings in this area .
Several such , however , were made some 20 years or more ago , and the coals were worked at some of them for a short period .
By the kindness of Mr. Whitworth Wright I have been placed in possession of the records of several of these borings , of which I now propose to give a brief account .
At Gybhouse Colliery ( see map , p. 367 ) , rather more than lj- miles almost due East of Bay ton Colliery , I am informed that the dip is to the West , under the so-called Permians of Church Hill .
The section here is very similar to that of the pit at Bayton .
Above the clunch-coal series , we find 78 feet of brown sandstone ( 11 feet from surface ) and above that 2 feet described as brown marls , and then 4 feet of yellow clay forming the subsoil .
In all 181 feet of Coal Measures were proved here .
A boring near Carton Farm , to the North-west of Gybhouse , near the eastern margin of the Church Hill breccia , gives us further information as to the beds above the coal series .
The sandstone bed here appears to be 88 feet thick , and above this we have 212 feet described as consisting of mottled clays , clunches , marls , and shales ( binds ) , light blue or brown or dark brown in colour , containing several beds of ironstone and coal .
In all 390 feet of Coal Measures were proved here .
Further to the South at Yew Tree sinking and boring , a short distance East of Clows Top , 601 feet of Coal Measures were proved .
The sandstone series here appears to be about 80 feet thick , and above it we have nearly 400 feet described as blue , red and brown marls , dark red marls , blue or brown binds and clods , with several thin coals and ironstones , as at Carton Farm .
A short distance North-east of Yew Tree , a boring was put down in 1897 at Blakemore Farm , near an old colliery .
According to a record which I have seen , this only penetrated to a depth of 295 feet , and thus we have only the upper section as proved at Yew Tree .
These rocks are described as consisting of blue , light or dark brown , or light red marls and clods , or mottled red and blue clays , with a few bands , one to two feet in thickness , of dark blue , strong rock , which may be really Espley grits .
From a consideration of the records of these borings it seems very probable that the rocks , above the coal-clunch basal series in this region , closely resemble those found in the Highley district ( p. 375 ) .
The greatest thickness of these beds proved was about 390 feet at Carton Farm , lying towards the centre of the syncline .

Previous Records of Fossil Plants from the Wyre Forest Coalfield .
The earliest record of a fossil plant from the Wyre Forest dates from 1858.* In the following year a plant was described by Morris !
under the name I ( ?
) Robertsi , sp. nov .
As Dr. Kidston has pointed out long ago , this specimen , now in * Roberts ( 581 ) .

381 the British Museum , is really Lonchopteris , Brongn .
Morris ' plant , which was collected by Roberts , came from beds just below Hill Farm , on the East bank of the Severn , about 2 miles North-east of Bewdley .
The following species among others were said to be associated* :\#151 ; Alethoptens Serli ( Brongn .
) .
A. lonchitica ( Schl .
) .
Pecopteris oreopteridia ( Schl .
) .
Sphenopteris cf. S. latifolia ( Brongn .

Roberts , f in 1860 , noticed the occurrence of plants in the rocks along the Dowles Brook , in particular at Town Mills , in Dowles Quarry , and in brook cuttings below Munster 's HillJ in the Shatterford Region .
Several of the specimens recorded were no doubt wrongly determined , and the list has so little value to-day that it is hardly worth while repeating it here .
Apparently these specimens were among the large collection of fossil plants from the Wyre Forest which , in 1861 , the British Museum obtained by purchase from Mr. G. E. Roberts , Mr. T. Baugh and others of Bewdley .
Very few of these bear any record of the localities from which they were obtained , though some are labelled as having been collected " near Bewdley , " from " Dowles Quarry , " and from the " railway cuttings near Dowles Bridge .
" These specimens were determined in 1886 by Dr. Kidston , and recorded in his c Catalogue of the Palaeozoic Plants in the British Museum .
' The collection is , however , of little value for my present purpose , owing to the absence of locality records , and in view of the fact that two palaeobotanical horizons are represented in the Forest , as I hope to prove in the present paper .
I however add here a revised list of these specimens , with some additional records .

The Fossil Flora of the Productive Measures of the Wyre Forest .
One of the chief objects of the present investigation was to inquire which palseobo-tanical horizons , below the Keele Series , are represented in this coalfield .
In particular , it was desired to ascertain whether the Sweet and Sulphur Coal Series belong to the same or to different horizons , and whether the horizon of certain * See Gibson ( 052 ) , p. 151 ; ( 06 ) , p. 173 .
DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
385 non-coal-bearing areas , the position of which in the sequence is at present uncertain , could be determined by this means .
To some extent this has been accomplished , though if more adequate exposures* for fossil plant collecting existed at the present time , no doubt the evidence would have been still more extensive .
It has , however , been found possible to investigate the flora of , and determine the horizon of\#151 ; ( a ) The Sweet Coals in the Highley Region .

The Sweet Coal beds worked at the Billingsley , Highley and Kinlet Collieries are undoubtedly the same , and therefore the floras of these three localities may be recorded together .
All the plants were obtained from the waste heaps of these collieries .
At the time the collections were made the heaps of Billingsley and Highley Colliery were not very productive of specimens , but Kinlet Colliery proved to be one of the richest collecting grounds in my experience .

387 ( b ) The Fossil Flora of the Unproductive Measures of the Dowles Valley Region .
With regard to the specimens obtained from the surface beds of the Dowles Valley , I have no new determinations to add to those already recorded by Dr. Kidston .
The fossil flora discussed here was obtained from the Alton No. 1 Boring ( see p. 375 ) , and from the occasional beds of black shales which there occur among the red clays and coloured shales .
The cores of this boring were not labelled as to depth , though the depth at which the diameter was varied is known .
Thus the position of the plant-bearing shales can be only very roughly indicated .

Plants were collected from the colliery heaps of the Bay ton Colliery , Hollins Pit , Pensax , and Buckets Leasow Pit , Mamble .
As the coals worked at all three collieries are either the same or very closely associated , the plants obtained may be considered together .
The fossils occur chiefly in a stiff white clay , from which it is somewhat difficult to get good specimens .

( d ) Notes on the Figured Specimens .
The specimens figured on Plates 26-29 are chosen partly as being species new to Britain or rare plants of which but few figures exist , and partly to illustrate the two distinct floras which occur in the Wyre Forest Coalfield .
Several are common plants , well known and repeatedly figured , but experience has shown that the only real proof of the palaeobotanical horizon , which can be offered in a memoir , is the publication of plates of figures of some of the most abundant and characteristic plants of the horizon in question .
In regard to the synonymy , only a few of the memoirs in which figures of the species in question may be found are here indicated .
I desire here to express my thanks to my friend Prof. Zeiller , of Paris , who has very kindly given me the benefit of his opinion on some of the fossils discussed here , of which I had no examples for comparison , and particularly in the case of the Sigillariostrobus first described by him .

Description.\#151 ; The specimen figured on Plate 29 , fig. 31 , is probably a terminal portion of a cone of Macrostachya , showing the external surface of the bracts .
It is 5*5 cm .
long and 2 cm .
across .
The pointed terminations of the bracts are broken off , except in one case .
Remarks.\#151 ; This is , I believe , a new British record , though the existence of a Macrostachya of comparatively slender habit in the Middle Coal Measures of the Midland and Pennine coalfields has been long known , and in some cases recorded without being specifically determined , for these specimens are nearly always very fragmentary .
The present example agrees in general habit with the much larger M. infundibuliformis ( Brongn .
) of the Upper Coal Measures.* It appears to me to be more closely similar to the plant originally described by Weiss as Macrostcichya Schimperiana , and later referred by him to the genus The close resemblance in the habit of this fossil to the better known infundibuliformis ( Brongn .
) , especially in the obvious union of the bracts for the greater part of their length , points , however , to its inclusion in the genus Macrostachya .

Remarks.\#151 ; This is a very rare Neuropterid in Britain , only known hitherto from the Middle Coal Measures of North Staffordshire .
Fig. 11 , Plate 27 , shows the general habit of the pinna and pinnules .
This photograph is nearly twice natural size ; while fig. 10 is enlarged four times to show the characteristic nervation of the pinnules .
I believe this plant to be identical with that figured by Kidston in 1888 from North Staffordshire , though his figures only show a small portion of the nervation .
Whether Kidston 's specimen is identical with Sternberg 's type is another matter .
There is agreement as regards the general , but not the detailed habit .
The pinnules of Sternberg 's plant are clearly plicated obliquely , like those in the lower portion of the frond of the Gondwana Neuropteridium validum .
My specimens do not show this feature , and it is apparently not very pronounced in Dr. Kidston 's .
But what is more important , the nervation of Sternberg 's figures differs totally from that given by Kidston , or from the present specimens .
Sternberg 's figures may " have been carelessly drawn and the nervation indicated only in a conventional manner , but seeing that the differences between the species of this genus depend almost entirely on the detailed nervation , it is not by any means certain that these British specimens are identical with the Austrian plant .

Blanzy et Creusot/ p. 49 , Plate 14 , fig. 2 .
Locality:\#151 ; Middle Coal Measures , Sweet Coals , Kinlet Colliery , Shropshire .
Description.\#151 ; Only a single example of this frond has been collected .
The pinnae are about 1*6 cm .
long , and the pinnules 3 mm. in length and 1*5 mm. broad .
They are attached by their whole base , and set a little obliquely on the rachis .
The base is somewhat decurrent below , and slightly contracted above .
The lateral nerves fork only once , as a rule , and the two branches are somewhat distant .
Remarks.\#151 ; This frond has been quite unknown to me previously .
I think it is certainly a new record for Britain , whatever doubt there may be as to the specific determination .
I have submitted photographs of it to Prof. Zeiller , who has very kindly examined them , and has suggested that this plant may be Pecopteris integra ( Andrse ) and has pointed out that the basal characters of the pinnules agree with those of that species .
I have compared the specimen with the published figures of this species , and especially those given by Prof. Zeiller of examples from the coalfields of Commentry and Blanzy .
There is considerable agreement* except that the pinnules of the Wyre Forest specimen are less than half the size of those of the Continental fronds .
This plant has also been recorded by Prof. Zeiller from the Westphalian of the Valenciennes coalfield , but the resemblance of that specimen to the British fossil is very much less than in the case of the Commentry examples .
Semina Incert^e Sedis .
RADIOSPERMUM Arber.* Diagnosis:\#151 ; Seeds cylindrical or ellipsoidal in form , radially symmetrical , longer than broad , not winged ; apex with or without notches or lobes ; testa smooth , with or without a few distant longitudinal ridges , but not striated longitudinally ; seeds with or without a cupule .
Remarks.\#151 ; This genus has been recently instituted for the reception of certain radially symmetrical seeds , when preserved in the form of , and to include impressions hitherto referred to the very unsatisfactory genus Carpolithus .
A study of the petrified specimens of such seeds indicates that , structurally , they are of several different types .
Thus among the smaller seeds here included in this genus are those which , when the structure is preserved , are referred to Lagenostoma , Physostoma , and Conostoma , and in these a cupule is present in some cases and not in others .
The generic distinctions between these seeds depend largely on the anatomical structure of the free portion of the integument at the apex of the seed .
In impressions * Arber ( 14 ) , pp. 92 , 101 .
VOL. cciv.\#151 ; B. of the external surface of such minute seeds , these characters can rarely , if ever , he recognised , and it is hopeless to attempt to refer such impressions to a structure-genus .
The same is true in greater or less degree of the larger species , of which in many cases the anatomical structure is unknown .
They are thus best grouped together as belonging to a single form-genus Radiospermum .

of Bot/ vol. 28 , p. 103 , Plate 7 , fig. .37 .
Locality:\#151 ; Middle Coal Measures , Sweet Coals , Kinlet Colliery , Shropshire .
Diagnosis:\#151 ; Seed radially symmetrical , ovoid , about 4 cm .
long and 2 cm .
across at its greatest breadth , broadly rounded at one end and bluntly pointed at the other .
Testa smooth , with very fine and close , discontinuous , longitudinal striae , and more than 5 ( ?
10 ) not very prominent , and somewhat distant longitudinal ridges .
Description.\#151 ; The material consists of a single specimen , of which one half is shown on Plate 27 , fig. 12 , natural size , and the reverse impression on fig. 9 , twice enlarged .
The seed appears to me to , be a new type , quite apart from any explanation of the peculiar features exhibited by the broader end .
It may be that this termination of the seed , whether it be the apex or the base , was damaged before preservation , or it may be that the seed split naturally into several lob'es at this extremity , when mature .
Only the discovery of further specimens can decide which view is the more correct .

Remarks.-\#151 ; This seed has been recorded from three or four coalfields , from both the Middle and Lower Coal Measures .
It is probably more abundant than the records would lead one to suppose , but has been frequently overlooked owing to its small size .
The specimens of seeds with cupules , recently figured by Carpentier ( see above ) , would no doubt be referred to the structure-genus , or to Conostoma , if they were known in the petrified state .
The seed of Carpentier s Plate 12 , fig. 4 , agrees very closely with that figured here on Plate 26 , fig. 8 .

There has been some difference of opinion as to whether this species should be referred to Samaropsis Gopp .
or Cardiocarpus Brongn .
I should , however , propose to reserve the latter generic name for a certain type of seed , which is not winged , or only in a slight degree .
The generic characters of Samaropsis may be stated as follows : Seeds fairly small , flattened , lenticular , more or less circular or oval , more or less broadly winged , usually pointed at the apex , with a fairly long micropyle .
Sclerotesta heart-shaped or oval .

SIGILLARIA Brongn .
1 .
SigillariaKinletensis sp. nov .
Plate 29 , fig. 34 .
Locality:\#151 ; Middle Coal Measures , Sweet Coals , Kinlet Colliery , Shropshire .
Diagnosis:\#151 ; A Eusigillarian stem of the type .
Ribs convex , prominent , 9 mm. broad , separated by straight grooves .
Leaf-scars approximate , 4 mm. apart .
On the bark between the scars a considerable number of curved , closely approximated wrinkles occur .
Leaf-scar occupying about one-half of the breadth of the rib , pyriform or somewhat club-shaped , 8\#151 ; 9 mm. long , 4-5 mm. across at its broadest point .
Lateral angles very obtuse , lower margin rounded , upper margin short and straight , upper lateral margins sometimes slightly concave .
Leaf-trace and parichnos-scars near apex of leaf-scar .
A curved line or groove occurs above the leaf-scar .
Remarks.\#151 ; I have been unable to identify this specimen with any recorded species .
It belongs to the group of S. rugosa Brongn .
and elongata Brongn .
It differs from S. rugosa in the leaf-scars being more closely approximated , much more vertically elongated , and especially in the ornamentation of the bark between the leaf-scars , and in the absence of the feather-like plume of wrinkles above the scar , which is characteristic of that species .
It approaches elongata Brongn .
in the length of the leaf-scar , but the shape of this scar , and especially the more pointed apex does not correspond , and further the ornamentation of the bark above the scar is different .
The leaf-trace and parichnos scars are also placed nearer to the apex .

Locality:\#151 ; Middle Coal Measures , Alton No. 1 Boring , Dowles Valley , Worcestershire .
Diagnosis :\#151 ; A Rhytidolepis stem , with prominent , slightly convex ribs , 7-9 mm. broad , separated by shallow , slightly sinuous grooves .
Leaf-bases prominent , bracketshaped ; leaf-scars 4-5 mm , long , and 4 mm. across at their greatest width , covering the greater part , but not the whole , of the rib .
A deep transverse sinus occurs immediately above each leaf-scar .
Leaf-base , below the leaf-scar , with three rows of transverse wrinkles ; one median , vertical and sometimes faint , and .
the other two , lateral and oblique .
Leaf-scars 2-2*5 mm. apart vertically .
Leaf-scar oval ; lateral angles rounded or very obtuse ; upper margin short , straight , emarginate ; lower margin rounded .
Remarks.\#151 ; The fossil figured on Plate 29 , fig. 32 , natural size , and on Plate 28 , fig. 24 , enlarged twice , appears to me to be a new species .
Its nearest affinities appear to be S. Micaudi Zeill .
, in which , however , the shape of the leaf-scar is quite different , the lateral angles being very pointed , and the lower lateral margin somewhat concave .
There are apparently , in this species , only two oblique rows of wrinkles below the leaf-scars .

Remarks.\#151 ; This species is a new record for Britain .
Even on the Continent it appears to be a rare plant .
In the single example which .
has been found in the Wyre Forest Coalfield , the leaf-scars are partly hidden under a film of carbon .
The scars are more distant ( 2 cm .
) from one another , vertically , than in the specimens figured by Brongn [ art and Goldenberg ( see above ) .
The ribs are not very prominent , and measure 8 mm. across , the grooves between them being slightly undulating .
The scar is transversely lenticular , 4*5-5 mm. broad , and 3*5 mm. high .
The lateral angles are very acute .

Remarks.\#151 ; The only previous record of this species from Britain is that by Kidston ( see above ) of a Wyre Forest specimen in the British Museum .
The chief characters of this species appear to be as follows : Bibs narrow , convex , 5 mm. across at the broadest part ( at the leaf-scar ) , with sinuous , undulating margins .
Leaf-scars about 5 mm. high , widely separated ( 12 mm. apart ) , bark between the scars smooth , not wrinkled .
Lateral angles of scar acute , lower margin rounded , upper margin straight and in some cases slightly emarginate .
There is , however , considerable variation in the shape of the scars , even in the specimen figured on Plate 28 , fig. 18 .

Locality:\#151 ; Middle Coal Measures , Sweet Coals , Kinlet Colliery , Shropshire .
Diagnosis:\#151 ; The following is a translation of Zeiller 's diagnosis of this species .
Cones cylindrical , straight or slightly bent , 50-65 , mm. broad , and 30 cm .
at least in length .
Stalk curved , 7-10 mm. broad , clothed at least towards the top with acicular leaves , very closely arranged , 25\#151 ; 40 mm. long and about 1 mm. broad , borne on slightly projecting cushions , disposed in longitudinal rows , 5-7 mm. high and 1*5 mm. broad , with undulating margins , finely punctate below the base of insertion of the leaves .
Axis of the cone 10 mm. broad , furnished with elliptical projecting scars , 1*5 mm. high by 1 mm. broad , often a little depressed or indented at the apex , arranged in whorls about 3\#151 ; 3*5 mm. distant from one another , 8\#151 ; 10 in a whorl and alternating in successive whorls .
Bracts lanceolate , very spreading , closely imbricated , 25\#151 ; 30 mm. long , 7\#151 ; 8 mm. broad , somewhat abruptly contracted towards their lower quarter into a cuneiform aiglet , also narrowing rather rapidly on the opposite side , and terminating in a very acute , long point , uninerved and more or less concave on the upper surface .
Description of the Specimens.\#151 ; Plate 26 , fig. 1 , shows , natural size , part of a straight cone about 10 cm .
long .
The shape of the sporophylls is very well seen .
Another specimen is figured on Plate 26 , fig. 5 , also natural size .
The cone here is clearly bent , and the sporophylls are not so plainly seen .
At the base there is about 3 cm .
of stalk , clothed with acicular bracts .
This cone , with the stalk , measures 12 cm .
in length , and like the last is incomplete .
An axis of a cone of the same species is represented twice enlarged on fig. 2 , Plate 26 .
It shows , in about the centre of the photograph , a small area in which the carbonaceous film still adheres to the impression .
The scars on this area are smaller and more triangular in shape than on the rest of the axis , one side of the triangle forming the upper margin and the angle being directed downwards .
Above and below , this carbonaceous layer is absent , and the scars are more oval in form .
Faint indications of sporophylls , which agree in form with those of the cones shown on figs. 1 and 5 , are seen at the side of the specimen , in the region where the carbonaceous film occurs , but these are not shown in the photograph on fig. 2 .
Some of them appear to be still attached to the axis .
The scars of the sporophylls are seen natural size in fig. 4 , and twice enlarged in fig. 2 .
They are borne on slight longitudinal ribs with sinuate margins .
The scars of one rib alternate with those of the ribs on either side , just as in the Sigillarian stems of the Rhytidolepis type .
The scars are approximated because , at any node , the ribs between those bearing the scars are very greatly contracted .
The deciduous nature of the sporophylls in is certainly one of their most remarkable features , wherein they appear to differ totally from Lepidostrobus .
Remarks.\#151 ; The specimens shown on Plate 26 are the first figured records of this plant from Britain.# Sigillariostrobus is one of the rarest of Coal Measure fossils .
So far as I am aware only a single example of this species has previously been known , and this occurred in the Nord de France coalfield , and was first figured by Prof. Zeiller in 1884 .
I have forwarded photographs of the Wyre Forest specimens to Prof. Zeiller , and he has very kindly given me the benefit of his opinion on them .
He agrees with me that they should be referred to his species S. nobilis , though the whole cone is somewhat smaller , and the sporophylls shorter and less pointed than in his figured specimens .
The new examples of this plant do not add anything of botanical interest to the masterly account of this plant for which we are indebted to Prof. Zeiller .
I have not been able to recognise any spores , and the stalk of the cone seen in fig. 5 is not long enough to show the ordinary leaf-bases .

Remarks.\#151 ; This is a new record from the British Coal Measures , and , so far as I am aware , this species has only been recorded hitherto from the Stephanian of the Loire coalfields by Grand ' Eury .
I think it possible that it may represent a male inflorescence of Cordaites .
Two specimens have been obtained , and in these the inflorescence is 2*6 cm .
long , with no sign of any bract , except perhaps in one somewhat doubtful instance , where the supposed bract may in reality be only one of the leaves of the " catkin , " which has become separated from the rest .
The axis is narrow , 1*5-2 mm. across .
In the specimen figured , six elliptical " catkins " are seen , arranged spirally .
Each is about 9 mm. long , and 2*5 mm. wide at its broadest part .
The apex is acute .
The parallel striation of the leaves forming the " catkin " can be seen in places .

The Pal^eobotanical Horizons of the Productive Measures of the Wyre Forest .
( a ) Previous Opinions .
In this sketch of previous opinions as to the age of the Coal Measures in the Wyre Forest , we may conveniently include those views founded solely on the lithological evidence .
Considerable stress has , in the past , been laid on the occurrence of bands of so-called Spirorbis-limestones , as marking certain definite horizons in the Coal Measures of the Welsh Borderland and Midland Coalfields .
Though there are some indications .that this view is being abandoned , * the presence of these rocks in the Wyre Forest played at one time a very prominent part in the discussions as to the * Clarke ( 01 ) , p. 86 , Gibson ( 01 ) , p. 253 .
horizon of the beds , and the conclusions founded on this evidence are in some cases still maintained to-day .
It may therefore be worth while to consider afresh exactly what stratigraphical inferences may be safely drawn from the occurrence or absence of such / S^rorfo's-limestones .
It is interesting to recall in this connection that the earliest description of these rocks relates to the Wyre Forest , and appeared in 1834 .
In that year England* discussed the \gt ; Sp^rorfoV limestones of this coalfield under the terms " thin concretionary limestone or calcareous conglomerate or corn stone , " but he did not mention the occurrence of Spirorbis in these beds .
In 1839 , however , Murchisonf showed that these beds were identical with those which elsewhere contained the fossil now generally known as Spirorbis .
In the meanwhile Phillips , | in 1836 , had described the / Sjp^rorfoVlimestones of Ardwick , Manchester .
The fossil Spirorbis itself was first described in 1809.S Murchison|| laid great stress on the occurrence of these Spirorbis-limestones as a means of correlating the coalfields of the Welsh Borderland system .
More recently Daniel JonesIF has applied the same principle to the correlation of the Sulphur Coals in different parts of the Wyre Forest .
It appears to me to be more than doubtful whether any such evidence can be relied upon , in view of the wide vertical range which Spirorbis is now known to possess .
There are four important facts to be borne in mind in this connection .
Firstly , in my experience , Spirorbis occurs in shale more frequently than in limestones .
Such / S^VorfoV-shales were recorded from the north-eastern margin of the Mamble district by Roberts in I860.** Secondly , Spirorbis sometimes occurs in a hard , cream-coloured limestone .
It seems to be held in some quarters that these limestones are largely built up of Spirorbis .
On the contrary , I believe this fossil is , in a sense , an accidental occurrence in the limestone , and just as much so as any impression of a fossil plant found in a calcareous bed .
Thirdly , cream-coloured limestones of similar texture to those containing , but without any trace of that fossil , are of frequent occurrence , and are often fairly closely associated with other limestones containing Spirorbis .
Fourthly , it must also be borne in mind that Spirorbis carbonarius ranges through the whole of the Carboniferous , both Upper and Lower , ft It was described from the * * * S ** * England ( 34 ) , p. 21 .

Wardie Shales , t When we bear in mind the wide vertical distribution of $pm\gt ; rfo's-limestones in the red measures of the Midlands , which have taken so many years to unravel , it is obvious that the occurrence of these bands is a matter of no zonal value .
In the North and South Staffordshire Coalfields , and in the Warwickshire area , they occur both in the Transition and Upper Coal Measures .
Thus any argument based solely on the occurrence of Spirorbis bands , associated with the Sulphur Coals , in the Wyre Forest is , from the point of view of the horizon of these beds , invalid .
There is no doubt however that , in the higher horizons of the Midland and Welsh Borderland Coalfields , we do find such bands of " freshwater limestone/ ' as MurchisonJ termed them , though we should not now lay stress on the occurrence of these rocks as of value as zonal indices .
In the Midlands and Welsh Borderland , the presence of such limestones may be regarded as a rough indication that the beds in question lie high up in the series , but even this conclusion is not in itself trustworthy , for such limestones sometimes occur in the productive measures , and we cannot deduce , from this evidence , the horizon to which they belong .
In my experience the presence or absence of Spirorbis in these limestones is quite immaterial , especially since that fossil itself has no zonal value .
These limestones appear to have , in some cases , been formed very slowly , and on the surface of the developing bed the worm in question formed its cast , just as it did , in other cases , on beds of mud , which later hardened into shales , or on the leaf or frond of a plant as it lay on the mud before becoming finally entombed .
S For the reasons above stated , I pass over any comparisons of the Wyre Forest Coalfield with that of South Staffordshire , based on the correlation of Spirorbis-limestone bands in the two coalfields .
Mr. Daniel Jones|| in particular has laid great emphasis on this correlation , and has concluded that " the idea that the Kinlet and Harcott coal-seams are the equivalents of the South Staffordshire thick coal-seam cannot be maintained .
" Turning next to the plant evidence , Stur,1T in 1884 , concluded from the occurrence of Alethopteris Serli ( Brongn .
) in the Wyre Forest ( see p. 383 ) that the rocks of this region , like those of the South Wales , Bristol , and Forest of Dean coalfields , belong * * * S * Gibson ( 051 ) , pp. 309-10 .

407 to the " Jtingsten Ablagerungen des Obercarbons .
" In 1894 , Dr. Kidston* severely criticised this conclusion , and rightly pointed out that the determination of the horizon by the presence of a single species is wholly unsafe .
Alethopteris Serli , for instance , ranges from the Middle Coal Measures , through the Transition and Upper Coal Measures , into the Stephanian .
In this country , however , it is much more abundant in the Transition , and especially the Upper Coal Measures , than in the Middle , where it is rare .
In 1895 , Mr. Canthillf concluded that the Sulphur Coal Series were Upper Coal Measures , and the Sweet Coal Series , Middle Coal Measures , and he further recorded Dr. Kidston'sJ conclusion that the fossil plants collected by Mr. Canthill from the Shatterford and Dowles Valley regions ( see pp. 383-384 ) indicated that the beds in these areas belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
One of the most recently expressed opinions is that of Lapwohth and Watts , S who remark of the Sulphur Coal Series that " one may hazard the conjecture that this division is parallel to the Newcastle and Halesowen sandstones .
" Dr. Gibson|| has also expressed the same conclusion , and quite recently has referred parts of the Claverley boring to the Keele , Halesowen Sandstone and the brick-clay or Espley Group ( see pp. 378 and 429 ) .
( b ) The Highley Region .
The fossil flora , recorded on pp. 385-386 , from the Sweet Coals of Highley , Kinlet , and Billingsley Collieries , is undoubtedly a Middle Coal -Measure flora .
Stephanian types are entirely absent , and thus this flora is easily distinguished from that of the Transition and Upper Coal Measure horizons , the floras of which are characterised by a greater or less number of essentially Stephanian species , associated with Westphalian elements .
Leaving out of account a large number of species which are widely distributed throughout the Coal Measures , the following is the vertical range of plants of more restricted distribution :\#151 ; * * * S * Kidston ( 94 ) , p. 191 .

We thus arrive at the important conclusion that Sweet Coals of the Kinlet area belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
With regard to the horizon of the Sulphur Coal Series above them , I have not been able to obtain any direct evidence in this region .
But provided that these coals are identical with the Sulphur Coals of the Mamble area ( see p. 378 ) , as has always been believed , and which belief there is no reason to doubt , so far as I am aware , then the Sulphur Coals of the Highley Region belong to a higher horizon , the Transition Coal Measures .
( c)The Dowles Valley Region .

409 The fact that Cordaicarpus Cordai ( Gain .
) occurs in the first 200 feet , and Lonchopteris rugosa Brongn .
within the first 360 feet of this boring indicates that the whole of the beds passed through belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
This conclusion is in harmony with the evidence of the plants collected by Mr. Can trill* and determined by Dr. Kidston ( see p. 407 ) from the surface beds in this area , and with Roberts ' specimens from this region in the British Museum , if we except the records of Pecopteris oreopteridia ( Schl .
) ( see p. 383 ) .
The whole collection in the British Museum is , in my opinion , derived from Middle Coal Measures .
Mr. Cantrill 's collection contains four species furcata Brongn .
, Alethopteris lonchitica Schl .
, Cardiocarpus orbicularis Ett .
, and Pinnularia capillacea L. and H. ) which have not been found in the Alton cores , and these again support this conclusion .
( d ) The Shatterfor Region .
Although I have no fresh evidence to offer with regard to the Shatterford Region , I may point out that all the specimens recorded by Mr. CantrillI ( see p. 383 ) and also those known to be derived from this region ( see p. 381 ) , now in the British Museum ( excepting the records of Pecopteris oreopteridia\#151 ; see p. 383 ) , indicate , as Dr. KidstonJ has concluded , that the surface beds of the measures of the southern part of this region belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
Further , I regard the whole of the productive measures penetrated by the Claverley boring ( see p. 378 ) , between 1800 and 2202 feet , as Middle Coal Measures .
There is a large collection of plant remains from this boring in the Museum of the Geological Survey , Jermyn Street .
I have had an opportunity of seeing these specimens , and in particular those from the lowest 200 feet ( 2000\#151 ; 2177 feet ) of the boring .
I can find , however , no evidence from these specimens that these beds belong to the Lower Coal Measures , as Dr. KidstonS has concluded .
On the contrary , the flora of the lowest 200 feet of the measures is undoubtedly .
a Middle Coal Measure flora .
( e ) The Marnble Region .
The flora of the Sulphur Coals of the Mamble Region , lying near the base of the Sulphur Coal Series , is undoubtedly one belonging to a higher , horizon than that of the Sweet Coals of the Highley area , or of the unproductive measures of the Dowles Valley Region .
It belongs to the Transition Coal Measures , as the following table of the distribution of the species , of more restricted vertical range , indicates :\#151 ; * * * S * Cantrill ( 951 ) , p. 38 .

( f ) General Conclusions as to the Horizons of the Productive Measures .
It may be wbll here to review the general conclusions as to the horizons of the productive measures in the Wyre Forest .
It has been found that the Sulphur and the Sweet Coal Series belong to the different , the former to the Transition Coal Measures , the latter to the Middle Coal , the two series being unconformable to one another .
The equivalents of these beds in the neighbouring coalfields will be found discussed in the following sections of this paper .
The distribution of these beds in the Wyre Forest has been made out to be as follows , on the evidence of the fossil plants ( see map , p. 367 ) :\#151 ; In the Highley Region , Transition Coal Measures are believed to overlie Middle Coal Measures uneonformably .
In the Dowles Valley and Shatterford Regions probably only Middle Coal Measures occur.* In the Mamble Region only Transition Coal Measures are found .
In the sketch map on p. 367 some attempt has been made to indicate these conclusions very * There may be also small patches of Transition Coal Measures in parts of these regions , but this is uncertain at present . .

It should be noted that the boundaries of the Sulphur Coal Series in the South of the Highley Region , and the relations of the two series to the North of Church Hill , are indicated more or less at random , for the exact position of these lines is quite unknown at present , and the field work necessary to solve these problems has not been regarded as falling within the scope of the present investigation .

A Review of the Fossil Floras and Pal^eobotanical Horizons of the other Welsh Borderland Coalfields .
In order to elucidate the natural affinities of the Wyre Forest Coalfield , it will be necessary to compare it in some detail with the other coalfields of the Welsh Borderland system , especially as regards the fossil floras , so far as they are known , and the palseobotanical horizons represented in each .
We will naturally begin with Coalbrookdale , which apparently is simply another portion of the same coalfield .
( a ) Coalbrookdale .
The classic memoir on this coalfield is still that by Prestwich , * published in 1840 .
Earlier accounts were given by AikinI and MurchisonJ , and more recently important papers by Marcus Scott , S Daniel Jones|| , and Clarke , IF have added to our detailed knowledge of the subject .
Some further account of the coalfield is to be found in Eyton , ** PuRTON , ff Randall .
The measures of Coalbrookdale belong to two distinct series .
SS The upper division , sometimes called the Upper Coal Measures or Series , is non-productive of ironstone , and also practically non-productive of coal .
This rests unconformably on a lower series , the so-called Lower Coal Measures , which are highly productive of both iron and coal , though only between 200 and 300 feet in total thickness .
The unconformity between the two series is known locally as the Symond Fault .
|||| The total thickness is at least 1100 feet .

tt Purton ( 65 ) .
Randall ( 71 ) , ( 73 ) , ( 82 ) .
SS Hull ( 77 ) , p. 629 , sub-divided the measures into three divisions\#151 ; Upper Coal Measures , Coal Measures , and Gannister Beds , the last named containing the Pennystone and Crawstone ironstones .
There seems , however , to be little to be said for such an unnecessary subdivision .
HI Clarke ( 01 ) ; Jones ( 712 ) , ( 94 ) , p. 291 ; Scott ( 61 ) .
UU Prestwich ( 40 ) , p. 429 .
The general succession has been very clearly stated by Scott , * from whose paper the following contracted account is chiefly derived .
The upper series consists of red and blue clays , with grey or green marls , clays and shales , and grey sandstones , with a few thin , impure and impersistent Sulphur Coals , rarely more than 6 inches in thickness .
The most persistent bed at the base of this series consists of a mottled red or yellow clay , termed Calamincar locally .
An impersistent band of \gt ; S^Vorfo"s-limestone occurs at Tasley , f Caughley , Kingslow , and elsewhere , above a thin Sulphur Coal .
Beds of calcareous breccia or conglomerate are also present.^ The whole of these rocks are very impersistent when traced laterally .
Their thickness is at least 300 feet .
It is obvious that this red-grey series corresponds very closely lithologically with that described here as the Sulphur Coal Series of the Wyre Forest .
There is specific mention of Espley rocks in a section given by Prestwich , S as occurring at some little distance below the Calamincar , and there is thus good reason to suppose that these beds occur in Coalbrookdale above the productive measures .
So far as I am aware , no fossil plants are known from this upper series , and therefore the horizon of these beds has yet to be ascertained .
But , from the presence of / S^Vorfos-limestones and Sulphur Coals , these beds have always been regarded as the equivalents of the measures of the Shropshire and Le Botwood fields , and of the Sulphur Coal Series of the Wyre Forest .
If this is the case , the horizon is no doubt the Transition Coal Measures , but this conclusion , while , provisionally accepted , awaits confirmation and proof .
The thin , lower series consists of alternations of grey\\ clods ( clays ) , with or without ironstone nodules , and of coal seams , with a few sandstone beds , such as the Flint Coal Sandstone .
All the coals and ironstones are impersistent laterally , and the former frequently pass into carbonaceous shale , known as batt or bass .
Further , both the coals and ironstones gradually thin out to the southward in descending order .
IT This lower series rests unconformably on Old Bed Sandstone or Silurian or Carboniferous Limestone , or in a limited area on ?
Millstone Grits .
There seems to be a very close correspondence between these measures and those productive of iron and coal in the Midland and Southern Pennine Coalfields , where the predominant type of sediment , associated with the coals , is clay , rich in ironstone nodules .
If these conclusions are correct , the lower , productive series of Coalbrookdale is of a very different facies to the Sweet Coal Series in Wyre Forest ( see p. 374 ) .
Fortunately we have the materials for determining the horizon of these beds .

413 Coalbrookdale .
This flora was described by Morris* in Prestwich 's memoir in 1840 , and the fine collection of the latter is preserved in the British Museum ( Not .
Hist. ) .
Naturally many of Morris ' determinations now require modification in the light of our modern knowledge .
I have carefully examined these specimens , and I propose to add here a list of species which represents our present knowledge of the fossil flora of Coalbrookdale .
They were all derived from the lower productive series , and chiefly from the ironstones known as the Ballstone , Whiteflats , and the Crawstone , though specimens were also obtained from certain sandstones and shales .
It is worthy of note that the ironstone nodules of Coalbrookdale sometimes contain petrified plant-remains .
Williamson !
figured a from this coalfield , and both Bindley and Hutton !
and Morris also figured the structure of the wood of Stigmaria fcoides from these nodules .
Before enumerating the known species of Coalbrookdale , I may add some notes on the specimens figured by Morris , S which are all preserved in the British Museum .
Notes on Morris ' Figured Specimens .
Halonia disticha Morr .
( p. 489 , Plate 38 , fig. 1 ) , from the Flint Coal Sandstone .
This is the type of this species , which is a perfectly distinct form .
The leaf-bases are decorticated , and there is thus no means of determining whether it is a branch of Lepidophloios or some other genus .
Bechera charceformis Sternberg ( p. 489 , Plate 38 , fig. 2 ) , from the Ballstone .
This is the plant now known as Calamocladus charceformis ( Sternb .

Stigmaria fcoides Brongn .
( p. 489 , Plate 38 , figs. 3 , 3a , 3b ) .
These petrified specimens illustrate the structure of the wood of this rhizophore .
Carpolites zamioides Morris ( p. 489 , Plate 38 , fig. 4 ) , from the Flint Coal Sandstone .
This I believe to be the Trigonocarpum of Lindley and Hutton , || also from Coalbrookdale , described three years earlier , and recently transferred by me to a new genus Radiospermum , as R. ovatum ( L. and H.).T Antholites anomalus Morr .
( p. 480 , Plate 38 , fig. 5 ) .
In some lists this has been regarded as a distinct species , but I am quite unable to distinguish it from Cordaianthus Pitcairnice ( L. and H. ) with which I believe it to be identical .
Knorria taxina L. and H. ( p. 489 , Plate 38 , fig. 6 ) , from the Ballstone .
This is a leafy stem of a Lepidodendron , showing a Knorria cast .
Cyclopteris semifabelliformis Morris ( p. 488 , Plate 38 , fig. 7 ) , from the Ballstone .
There may be some doubt whether ib is advisable to distinguish species of these * Morris , in Prestwich ( 40 ) , pp. 488-9 , Plate 38 .

Neuropterid aphlebise .
If such species are maintained , then this is the type of a distinct form .
Lycopodites ?
longibracleatus Morris ( p. 488 , Plate 38 , figs. 8-11 ) .
This is the most interesting specimen in the whole collection .
It Consists of a branch of Lepidophloios acerosus ( L. and H. ) ending in a cone , one of the few cases in which the cone of this genus has been found attached.* The bracts of the cone have some resemblance to Lepidophyllum lanceolatum L. and H. , but in my opinion they are really quite distinct from that species .
Carpolithes helicteroides Morr .
( p. 489 , Plate 38 , figs. 12 , 12a ) .
This is the type-specimen of the well known Palceoxyris helicteroides ( Morr .
) , which , on my view , is not the remains of a plant , but probably the egg-capsules of a fish .
The following is the order of succession of the chief plant-bearing beds , according to PRESTWIOHf :\#151 ; ( 5 ) Balls tone .
( 4 ) White and Blue Flats .
( 3 ) Flint Coal Sandstone .
( 2 ) Best Coal Rock .
( 1 ) Crawstone .
The Crawstone is one of the lowest ironstones of Coalbrookdale , and occurs not very far above the base of the measures .
The two next beds are associated with the Best and Flint Coals , two of the most important seams in the field .
The White and Blue Flats ( ironstones ) lie above the latter coal , and below the Top Coal .
The Ballstone lies above the Top Coal , and near the top of the lower series .
There is little doubt that the following flora of the lower series of Coalbrookdale is , as a whole , a Middle Coal Measure flora .
The majority of the species are those which are common in both the Middle and Lower Coal Measures , but the presence of Calamocladus charceform/ is ( Sternb .
) and Neuropteris , Hoflin .
is unknown in the Lower Coal Measures .
At the same time it is much to be desired that a further examination of this flora should be undertaken , and it may be expected to result in the record of further species , some of which will no doubt prove to be exclusively Middle Coal Measure plants .
While these records from the Ballstone show that the higher beds of this series are Middle Coal Measures , and certainly not Transition Coal Measures , it is not possible to prove on the present evidence that the lowest beds are Middle , rather than Lower Coal Measures , though the former horizon is much the more probable .
We may assign , at least provisionally , the lower series of Coalbrookdale to the same horizon as the Sweet Coals of the Wyre Forest .
Possibly also the upper series , in both coalfields , may eventually be proved to belong to a higher horizon , * These specimens were re-figured by Williamson ( 93 ) , Plate 8 , figs. 53 , 54 .

This is what we should expect , seeing that the Wyre Forest and Coalbrookdale are apparently parts of the same coalfield , and that in both areas the upper series is unconformable to the lower .
While the upper series in both coalfields is very similar lithologically , this is not the case as regards the lower series , which in Coalbrookdale appear to be a grey series , far richer in coal , and particularly in ironstone , than the red-grey Sweet Coal series of the Wyre Forest .
In Coalbrookdale the coals of the lower series vary from 7 to 22 \#166 ; distributed throughout the series , while in the Wyre Forest the Sweet Coals number from 3 to 7 ( counting very thin seams ) , most of which I believe to lie all together near the top of the series ( see pp. 372 and 373 ) .
The explanation of this difference between the lower series in the two areas is to be sought in the fact that , although the Wyre Forest and Coalbrookdale apparently form one coalfield , this is not in reality the case .
The whole area includes at least four coalfields of different ages , some of them in part , hut only in part , overlying or overlapping one another .
This I believe to be the key to the structure of this area .
In the whole of the Southern part of Coalbrookdale the lower series ( Middle Coal Measures ) are absent.* We have thus two isolated regions of Middle Coal Measures or Sweet Coal Series , one in the Northern part of Coalbrookdale and the other in the Northern , Eastern , and Central districts of the Wyre Forest .
So far as we know , these beds , though of equivalent age , are quite unconnected by beds belonging to the same period .
Overlying these , but separated from them by a marked unconformity , we have another large coalfield of Transition Coal Measures , belonging to a later epoch .
This covers most of the Middle Coal Measures of Coalbrookdale , and further forms a bridge connecting these measures with the corresponding , but not identical , measures of the Wyre Forest .
It also covers up a large portion , but by no means all , of the Middle Coal Measures of the Highley Ttegion of the Forest .
This is the third coalfield .
Its boundaries apparently bear no relation to those of the two coalfields which it overlies , and from which it is separated by the not inconsiderable interval of time represented by the unconformity known as the Symond Fault .
Lastly , in the Sulphur Coal series of the Mamble area , in the South of the Wyre Forest , we have a fourth coalfield of the same age as the third , but , so far as we know , entirely isolated from it , and overlying , except near Abberley , not Middle Coal Measures , but Old Led Sandstone .
It may be that , North of Church Hill , this coalfield overlaps the Middle Coal Measures of the Howies Valley Legion , but , so far as we know at present , not to any great extent .
How far the Northern limit of this coalfield is separated from the Southern limit of the third coalfield remains also an obscure point . !
These tracts may have originally been continuous , but such evidence as * Jones ( 94 ) , p. 291 .
t The boundary lines shown on the map on p. 367 between the Middle and Transition Coal Measures are purely conjectural .
DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
417 there is at present , insecure as it is , does not lead one to suspect that they are continuous in the West at the present time .
If this is the explanation , and if the Middle Coal Measures of Coalbrookdale form a quite distinct basin from those of the Wyre Forest , then the lithological dissimilarities between the two are capable of a comparatively simple explanation ( see p. 436 ) .
( 6 ) Titterstone The geology of the Clee Hills has been discussed by Wright , * Murchison , !
Phillips , !
Symonds , S Jones , || and others .
Mr. Daniel Jones !
has attempted to correlate the Coal Measures of Clee Hills with those of the Wyre Fore^ and Coalbrookdale .
Quite recently Mr. Ernest Dixon** has made a special study of the geology of Titterstone Clee Hill , of which , however , only a short abstract has yet been published .
His results , however , are of particular interest .
Among them we may notice the conclusions that the Coal Measures rest unconformably on the so-called Millstone Grit , which , in part at least , is really of Lower Carboniferous Age .
He notices also the fact that red clays and green Espley sandstones are a feature of the Coal Measures , and agrees with the previously expressed view that the Clee Hill Measures belong to the same horizon as the Sweet Coal series of the Wyre Forest .
He believes that they correspond to part of the Etruria Marl Series .
He points out that a fairly rich flora occurs in the Coal Measures , which , however , Dr. Kidston regards as a Middle Coal Measure flora , and therefore one belonging to a lower horizon than the Etruria Marl Series .
No details of the flora collected have been published as yet .
It is obvious that these results with regard to Titterstone Clee Hill have an important bearing on the present work on the Wyre Forest .
There have been for some years past a few plants from Titterstone Clee in the Sedgwick Museum , and this collection has recently been increased by Mr. Rogers .
I append a list of these specimens for comparison with the fossil floras of the Wyre Forest .
Before doing so , however , I may briefly notice the previous records of Bindley and Hutton !

419 Hutton 's records\#151 ; though I have not obtained any further specimens of either of them , nor have they ever been recorded from any other locality in Britain .
This flora is clearly a Middle Coal Measure flora .
Setting aside those species which are distributed throughout the Coal Measures , there are six types which are unknown above the Middle Coal Measures , and four ( including one doubtful determination in each case , but omitting Bindley and Hutton 's unique types ) , which are unrecorded from the Lower Coal Measures .
Thus we have actual proof here of the opinion already expressed by Mr. Dixon that these beds belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
One of the plants included in the above list is a record new to Britain , and this , with another specimen , is figured here .
The following notes relate to these specimens :\#151 ; Notes on the Specimens Figured .

It approaches more closely Cordaicladus Schnorriana ( Geinitz ) , f in which , however , the leaf-cushions are more widely separated , and apparently do not possess the radiating ridges .

Remarks.\#151 ; This specimen , which is not at all perfectly preserved , appears to me to agree more closely with certain forms of the somewhat variable S. Boblayi Brongn .
, than with any other species with which I am acquainted .
There is also some resemblance to S. mamillaris Brongn .
, but I think in less degree than to the former species .
The leaf-scars are more vertically elongated than in S. mamillaris .
The specimen in question agrees fairly closely with the fig. 2 of Plate 83 of Zeiller 's Valenciennes Memoir ( see above ) .
So far as I am aware , no plants have been recorded from the Brown Clee Hills , with the exception of the British Museum specimen of Grandini Gopp .
, # which is labelled as being derived from this locality .
This species in Britain is known only from the Upper Coal Measures , but it is a very rare plant , which may perhaps in reality also occur on other horizons .
So far as this uncertain evidence permits us to draw any conclusions , it seems not unlikely , provided the above specimen is properly labelled as regards locality , that the Brown Clee measures may eventually prove to belong to a higher horizon than those of the Titterstone Clee.t It is therefore much to be desired , should any opportunities of obtaining specimens from this locality arise in the future , that particular attention should be paid to the fossil flora of these beds .
In conclusion , I have endeavoured to prove here that the red-grey measures with Espleys of the Titterstone Clee Hills , as made known to us by Mr. Dixon , belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
They are thus the equivalents of the Sweet Coal Series of the Wyre Forest , a set of sediments , as has been shown here , of precisely similar lithological character to those at Clee Hill .
On the other hand , neither the Sweet Coal Series of the Wyre Forest nor the Clee Hill beds are the equivalents of the Etruria Marls , which belong to a higher horizon , the Transition Coal Measures .
It is quite a mistake to suppose that Espley rocks , in conjunction with red-grey sediments , are confined to one zone of one horizon , \#151 ; the Etruria Marls .
In the Welsh Borderland , in more than one coalfield , they occur in the Middle Coal Measures , and in the Wyre Forest on two horizons , the Middle and Transition Coal Measures .
On the other hand , we have no evidence in the Titterstone Clee Hills of any beds equivalent in age to the Sulphur Coal Series ( Transition Coal Measures ) of the Wyre Forest .
( c ) Shrewsbury and Le .
There appears to be little doubt that the Shrewsbury and Le Botwood Coalfields were originally united , though now widely faulted asunder .
Very little attention , as compared with that given to the other Welsh Borderland coalfields , appears to have * * Kidston ( 86 ) , p. 78 .
f The occurrence of another Upper Coal Measure plant , Corynepteris erosa ( Gutb .
) , labelled " Clee Hill , in the same collection , is also significant in this connection .

421 been devoted to these measures since Murchison's* account appeared .
At present the view is widely held , as it has always been held , that the coals and limestones of the red-greyf measures of these areas are the equivalents of the Sulphur Coal Series of Coalbrookdale and the Wyre Forest .
J What little we know of the fossil plants of these coalfields entirely supports this view , though as yet the floras of these beds have not been thoroughly collected .
With a view to a comparison of the flora of these coalfields , so far as our scanty knowledge extends , with those of the Wyre Forest , I append the following records .

one can judge from these and the scanty records above mentioned , I am quite inclined to believe that the horizon of these beds is the Transition Coal Measures .
Definite proof , however , of the horizon will not be forthcoming until their flora has been more thoroughly collected and examined .
( d ) Newent .
In 1910* I gave the results of an examination of what little there is to be seen at the present time of this concealed coalfield in Gloucestershire .
A scanty flora was described , but the exact horizon of the beds remained in doubt , owing to the difficulty of obtaining plant-remains .
On the other hand , it was shown that the horizon must be either the Transition , or the Upper Coal Measures .
In 1912f I pointed out the great lithological dissimilarity between the Newent Coalfield and the neighbouring Forest of Dean , and suggested that in all probability the Newent area was related to the Welsh Borderland system of coalfields , and not to the latter area .
Since then my studies of the Borderland Coalfields have enabled me to recognise a strong lithological resemblance between the Wyre Forest and Newent .
The reddish shales and clays passed through in the 90-feet well-sinking at Great Boulsden , J near Newent , from which the fossil plants were chiefly obtained , closely resemble lithologically the Wyre Forest Beds , though neither \gt ; Sp^ror\amp ; is-limestones nor Espleys have been recognised , so far , in the former area .
On the other hand , the occurrence of Sulphur Coals at Newent supports the provisional contention that these beds are probably Transition Coal Measures , belonging to the Welsh Borderland system of coalfields , and lithologically similar to the beds of that horizon in the Wyre Forest .
( e ) Conclusions .
A comparison of the Wyre Forest with the other coalfields of the Welsh Borderland system leads me to believe that not only are these areas related tectonically , but that in many cases they closely resemble one another lithologically .
The prevalence of red-grey argillaceous measures , of Sulphur Coals , of Espleys , and of $pfcVor\amp ; 2S-limestones , which appear to be the dominant lithological types ( though certain important exceptions occur , in particular the beds of the Lower Series of Coalbrookdale ) , is certainly very remarkable .
Further , it is clear that the red-grey measures with Espleys occur in at least two coalfields on a lower horizon than is known to be the case in the Midlands or the Pennine Coalfields .
On the other hand , while these coalfields show some points , of lithological resemblance to those of the Midlands , as we shall see in the next section of this paper , they show practically none to the coalfields to the South , e.g. , the Forest of Dean and Bristol areas .

423 same also holds as regards the coalfields to the North , for , as Murchison* pointed out as early as 1839 , the Denbighshire field is quite distinct from the Shrewsbury area , and " constitutes in reality the natural southern termination of the great coalfield of North Wales " With regard to the palaeobotanical horizons represented by the measures of the Welsh Borderland areas , much further work is necessary before our knowledge can be firmly established in regard to these points .
It has , however , been shown here that the lower series of Coalbrookdale , and the whole of the productive measures of Titterstone Clee Hill , belong to the same horizon as the Sweet Coal Series of the Wyre Forest , \#151 ; the Middle Coal Measures .
It has been pointed out that the Coalbrookdale-Wyre Forest area consists of four distinct and isolated coalfields , two composed of Middle Coal Measures , and two of Transition Coal Measures , the latter in part reposing unconformably on the former , or bridging over the interval between them .
With regard to the horizons represented in the other fields , more doubt remains , but the results incorporated in the following table are believed to be as accurate as our present knowledge of the subject will permit .
In the whole of this region Lower Coal Measures appear to be absent , and the Middle or Transition Series rest unconformably on Lower Carboniferous , or more generally on Devonian or Lower Palaeozoic rocks .
The horizons present in any particular area but rarely correspond with those of the neighbouring fields , and in all probability each of these coalfields originated as an isolated region , and was not , ab continuous with its neighbours .

A Review of the Fossil Floras a^nd Pal^eobotanical Horizons of the Midland and Southern Pennine Coalfields .
In the Midland counties we find two series of Coal Measure basins , which differ fundamentally from one another , though they possess many features in common .
Those which we may call the Midland fields include South Staffordshire and Warwickshire .
Here the lowest zone of the Coal Measures represented is the Middle Coal Measures , and these rest unconformably on Silurian in South Staffordshire , and on Cambrian in Warwickshire .
Both Millstone Grits and Lower Coal Measures are absent .
On the other hand , in the Southern Pennine fields of North Staffordshire , Nottinghamshire , and Derbyshire ( the Southern prolongation of the Yorkshire Coalfield ) , and in Leicestershire , there is , in general , a perfect succession from the Carboniferous Limestone to the Middle Coal Measures , both Millstone Grits and Lower Coal Measures being represented .
This is also true in the case of the Northern Pennine Coalfields of Yorkshire and Lancashire , which , however , we need not discuss here .
The great advance which has been made within recent years in regard to the Southern Pennine and Midland Coalfields , and one which we owe chiefly to the long-continued labours of Dr. Walcot Gibson , # has been the elucidation of the higher , unproductive coal measures of these coalfields .
The classification of these measures , which now include the rocks formerly called the Lower Permian , that has been adopted by the Survey , is shown in the following table , which also gives the palseobotanical horizons .
This perfectly conformable series has been found to be typically developed in North Staffordshire , and thus the Potteries Coalfield is taken as the type area :\#151 ; t Lithological Horizon .

The Leicestershire Coalfield is abnormal in that none of the Transition or Upper Coal Measures are represented .
Further , the Black-Band group is confined to the Potteries Coalfield .
The essential lithological characters of these four conformable groups in the North Staffordshire Coalfield are as follows :\#151 ; # ( 4 ) Keele Group.\#151 ; Red and purple sandstones and marls with occasional seams of coals , and bands of \gt ; Sp^Vor6\#187 ; s-limestone , and subordinate bands of grey sandstone and shale .

( 1 ) Black-Band Group.\#151 ; Grey sandstones , shales , and clays , with thin seams of coal , with Black-Band ironstones and \gt ; Sp{ror6^s-limestones .
The palseobotanical horizons of these beds are known , thanks to the labours of Dr. Kidston , and these , in conjunction with the lithological characters , have for many years past served as a standard for the correlation of the unproductive measures , as developed , in the neighbouring coalfields .
For the purposes of a comparison with the Wyre Forest it will be necessary to review , as briefly as possible , the floras and horizons of the Midland and Southern Pennine Coalfields .
We will begin with those of South Staffordshire , as this is the nearest coalfield to the Wyre Forest:\#151 ; * Gibson ( 01 ) , ( 051 ) , p. 51 .

( a ) South Staffordshire .
The lithological horizons of the South Staffordshire Coalfield have been described by Jukes , # Lap worth , !
Gibson , ; \#163 ; and Kay .
S They may be summarised as follows :\#151 ; ( 4 ) Keele Group.\#151 ; Red breccias , sandstones , and marls , with \gt ; SpiVor6^-limestones .
( 3 ) Halesowen Sandstone Group.\#151 ; Grey and yellow sandstones , with a few thin coals and / Sp^rorfo's-limestones .
( 2 ) Red Clay Group of Old Hill and Oldbury.\#151 ; Red and mottled clays and marls with Espley bands .
( I ) Productive Measures.\#151 ; Grey clays , shales , and sandstones , and fireclays , with thick coals and ironstones .
Of the fossil floras of these beds we know very little .
Our knowledge of the horizons of the Keele , the Red Clay group , and the Productive Measures has rested , until quite recently , on the plants obtained from the sinking of the shafts of the Hamstead and Sandwell Park Collieries .
These were recorded by Dr. Kidston|| in 1888 and 1894 .
They have been shown to belong to the Upper , Transition , and Middle Coal Measures respectively .
The palaeobotanical investigation of this coalfield is , however , in active progress at the present time , and it is hoped that before very long our knowledge of the floras and horizons will be greatly increased .
Our present position may be summed up as follows .
Nothing further has been ascertained as to the flora of the Keele Series , but considerable progress has been made as regards the Halesowen SandstonelF flora , and especially in connection with the plants of the Red Clay group.## Some interesting specimens have been obtained from the former series , but they are not sufficient to determine the horizon , which remains unproved .
A very remarkable flora has however been obtained from the Red Clay group , and this indicates that the horizon is low down in the Transition Measures .
So far , the plant evidence has tended to confirm the view that a close parallelism exists between the unproductive measures of South Staffordshire , and those of Warwickshire on the one hand , and North Staffordshire on the other .
With regard to the flora of the productive measures , which is very rich , large collections have been made from time to time , but they have never been worked out , nor recorded , with the exception of the work of Dr. Kidston above mentioned , and the study of a few isolated specimens of particular interest , recorded by Hooker , * Jukes ( 59 ) .

All those , however , who are familiar with the plants of this coalfield agree that it is a Middle Coal Measure flora , though a thorough working out of the vertical distribution of the species in the productive measures of this area , and especially the proof that the lowest and highest beds both belong to this horizon , has yet to be accomplished .
( b ) Warwickshire .
The foundations of our knowledge of the Coal Measures of the Warwickshire Coalfield were laid by Howell , * and have been more recently extended by the Survey , f and especially by Vernon .
J Mr. Vernon gives the following classification of the Coal Measures :\#151 ; ( 4 ) Keele Beds.\#151 ; Red and purple sandstones and marls , with marly breccias , and three thin beds of / S^Vorfo's-limestone .
( 3 ) Haunchwood Sandstones.\#151 ; Grey sandstones and shales , with thin coals , and some red mottled marls towards the top .
( 2 ) Nuneaton Clays.\#151 ; Red and purple mottled marls and clays , with thin Espley rocks , a Spirorbis band , and local breccias .
( 1 ) Productive Coal Measures.\#151 ; Grey sandstones and shales , with thick coal seams , and beds of ironstone .
For our present knowledge of the fossil floras of this horizon we are mainly indebted to Vernon 's recent work .
S The Keele beds have been shown to belong to the Upper Coal Measures , the Haunchwood Sandstones and Nuneaton Clays to the Transition Series , and the Productive Measures to the Middle Coal Measures .
There thus appears to be a very close lithological , as well as zonal , similarity between the South Staffordshire and the Warwickshire Coalfields .
( c ) North Staffordshire .
The standard work on this area , the memoir of Dr. Gibson , || contains a full bibliography of the earlier literature .
The lithological subdivisions of the higher unproductive measures of this coalfield have been already referred to ( p. 424 ) with reference to their palseobotanical horizons , as disclosed by the researches of Dr. Kidston .

( d ) Nottingham and Derbyshire .
In the Nottingham and Derbyshire Coalfield , * only the Lower and Middle Coal Measures are exposed , and the floras of these horizons have now been worked out .
t The higher unproductive beds are everywhere concealed , and are known only from a few borings .
The Thurgarton Boring , | 10 miles north-east of Nottingham , proved red beds , followed by grey sandstones , which , on the evidence of their fossil plants , were shown to belong to the Keele and Newcastle Series .
S At the Gedling Colliery , and in the Oxton Boring , the Etruria Marls were proved.|| ( e ) Leicestershire .
The Survey MemoirlT on this coalfield confirms the conclusion that only Lower and Middle Coal Measures occur here .
Some additions to our knowledge of the fossil plants of these beds have been made in recent years by Horwood , ** but much remains to be done in this coalfield , particularly as regards the plants of the Lower Coal Measures .
It has sometimes been assumed that the higher horizons were once present in Leicestershire , and that they have since been completely denuded .
This may have been the case , but it is by no means certain at present that the unproductive measures ever existed in this area .
( f ) Conclusions .
From this rapid survey of our knowledge of the palaeobotanical horizons of the Coal Measures in the Midland and Southern Pennine Coalfields , it is clear that we have now reached a stage at which the framework to support a detailed correlation has been firmly secured , even if , here and there , the workmanship is rough and unfinished .
It is at least certain that the coalfields of the Midland and Southern Pennine system are by no means identical as regards the horizons represented , and it is very difficult , if not impossible , to believe that originally they formed one continuous sheet .
Some areas are more closely related than others , and this is particularly so in the case of Warwickshire and South Staffordshire .
How , then , does the Wyre Forest compare with these coalfields ?
The Sweet Coal Series of the Wyre Forest are the equivalents of the Productive Measures of the Midland fields .
But lithologically they are very different .
In the Wyre Forest the coals are few , and for the most part thin , and the ironstones fewer still .
This horizon is there represented by a red-grey series with Espleys , as opposed to the grey series without Espleys , in South Staffordshire .

DR , E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
429 The Sulphur Coal Series of the Wyre Forest belongs to the same horizon as the Red Clay group of South Staffordshire , and may be the actual representative of that very series .
The South Staffordshire beds , however , consist almost entirely of a series , while in the Wyre Forest they are red-grey measures , and , in part at least , productive of coal , and unconformable to the beds below .
No such unconformity occurs in South Staffordshire .
If the Halesowen Sandstone Series occurs in the Wyre Forest the beds must be thin , for there does not appear to be any great development there of grey arenaceous rocks above the coals , which lie at the base of the series .
Thin coals occur both in the Halesowen Sandstones and the Old Hill Marls , but , so far as I am aware , nowhere in the Midland or Southern Pennine Coalfields are coals of workable thickness found in the equivalents of these beds , 'as they are in the Wyre Forest .
I do not wish to labour this point , however , for the workable Wyre Forest Sulphur Coals are few , and their relative thickness may be simply a local peculiarity .
On the other hand , they are also the only coals which have been , or are being worked in the Shrewsbury and Le Botwood fields , and probably also at Newent .
The Keele Series appears to be represented in the Wyre Forest.* These beds , however , lie outside the province of this paper , and I have nothing to add to what Mr. Canthill has recorded of them .
In one point in particular the Wyre Forest resembles the Midland Coalfields , and that is that the lowest horizon of the Coal Measures present in each case is the Middle Coal Measures .
But this is not a matter of primary importance .
On the whole I recognise much less affinity between the Wyre Forest and the Midland Coalfields , than between that area and the other Welsh Borderland coalfields .
In this connection , however , the record of the Claverley Boring ( see pp. 378 , 384 , 409 ) is obviously important .
Yet , on my view , the results of this boring are curiously inconclusive , and it is quite possible to claim Claverley as part of the Wyre Forest , or as part of the South Staffordshire Coalfield , according to the point of view which appeals to one most .
Personally I am in doubt as to which coalfield the beds proved by this boring belong , if to either , though I am inclined , provisionally , to see in Claverley a greater resemblance to the Wyre Forest than to South Staffordshire .
On the other hand , Dr. Walcot Gibsonf has recently stated , in no uncertain terms , that the beds here passed through below the Permians and Keele Series , are the lithological succession met with in South Staffordshire .
These may be summarised as follows , the names being those applied by Dr. Gibson .
( 3 ) Halesowen Sandstones ( 361 feet 3 inches).\#151 ; Grey sandstones and blue , shales , with two thin coals , each 3 inches thick .
* Cantrill ( 952 ) , ( 97 ) t Gibson ( 13 ) .
( 2 ) Brick Clay or Espley Group ( 185 feet 9 inches).\#151 ; Red and variegated marls , grey sandstones and Espleys .
( 1 ) Productive Coal Measures ( 401 feet 10 inches).\#151 ; Grey measures with six coals , varying from 2 to 12 inches in thickness .
No plant remains were obtained from beds ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) , and thus their palasobotanical horizons are unknown ; ( l ) is known to be wholly Middle Coal Measures .
It might quite well prove , were it possible to ascertain the palaeobotanical horizons , that these beds are the equivalents of the Productive Measures , Brick Clays and Halesowen Sandstones of South Staffordshire .
But that is not the main point .
What is really important is to ascertain whether the Claverley beds belong to the Wyre Forest , or to the South Staffordshire Coalfield .
The productive measures of Claverley , as described by Dr. Gibson , do not resemble the productives either of South Staffordshire or the Wyre Forest , as he admits , but there is greater dissimilarity as regards the former than the latter .
This part of the boring may be compared to the lowest 240 feet of the measures of the Shatterford sinking* ( see p. 377 ) .
At any rate there is a closer comparison to be found there than between the productive measures of Claverley and South Staffordshire , and the absence , in the former boring , of any trace of the workable coals and ironstones of South Staffordshire is too significant to be lightly passed over in this connection .
If the Claverley rocks should prove to belong to the Wyre Forest , the coals there met with are not necessarily the Sweet Coals of Kinlet .
They are more probably the coals at the base of the Middle Coal Measures of the Wyre Forest , which have only been proved so far at Shatterford .
The workable coals of the Highley district appear to lie near the top of the Middle Coal Measures , and are perhaps equivalent to the Upper Coal Series of Shatterford .
I pass now to the beds termed " Brick Clays or Espley Group " by Dr. Gibson .
It has been shown here that Espley rocks occur in the Middle Coal Measures of the Wyre Forest , as also of the Titterstone Clee Hill Coalfield .
The occurrence of Espleys is thus no criterion of horizon .
The " Espley Group , " so-called , of the Claverley Boring may be the Sweet Goal Series of the Wyre Forest , i.e. , Middle Coal Measures .
It has been pointed out here that these beds , in the Wyre Forest , are a red-grey series of measures , coloured clays ( ?
marls ) predominating , and black shales and grey sandstones only occasionally occurring .
The chief objection to the recognition of this group in the so-called Espley beds of Claverley is the absence of any coals in that boring on this horizon .
On the other hand , there is considerable evidence which shows that , in the Wyre Forest , the coals thin fairly rapidly from West to East , not only in the Middle , but also in the Transition Measures .
Perhaps the Sweet Coals of the Highley Begion have disappeared entirely at Claverley , but , however this may be , doubt still remains as regards this correlation .
* Roberts ( 61 ) .
DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
431 The next higher beds certainly do resemble lithologically the Halesowen Sandstone Series of South Staffordshire , but , until the palmobotanical horizon of this series can be ascertained , it is idle to guess at the horizon to which they may belong .
At any rate no such grey series , of 360 feet in thickness , has yet been recognised among what are generally termed the productive measures in the Wyre Forest .
I have entered somewhat at length into this matter , in order to point out that the correlation of Claverley , as part of the South Staffordshire Coalfield , should not be accepted without hesitation .
As a matter of fact , as I have shown , there are difficulties in recognising in the Claverley beds either the South Staffordshire or the Wyre Forest lithological sequence , and judgment on the main point at issue is best suspended until more evidence is 'available .
It is quite an open question whether Claverley does not represent a distinct coalfield .
In conclusion , if there is little correspondence between the Transition Measures of the Wyre Forest and the Midland fields , there is still less when we compare the beds belonging to the same horizon in the Potteries Coalfield .
The affinities of the Wyre Forest clearly lie neither to the East nor to the North-east , but to the North and South .
8 .
General Conclusions .
The structure of the Wyre Forest Coalfield presents a number of difficult problems to which comparatively little attention has been directed hitherto .
At the present time I do not imagine that anyone pretends to understand this coalfield fully , and I , for my part , do not suppose that the present consideration will do more than clear up certain of the difficulties .
As I have already pointed out , my object has not been here to attempt a thorough elucidation of the geological structure of this area , but rather to seek data which will admit of some broad conclusions with regard to the general relationships of this coalfield with the neighbouring areas of productive measures .
The study of the fossil floras of the productive measures of the Wyre Forest appears to throw some light on these matters , though it has been found that the possibilities of obtaining adequate collections of this nature are very limited at the present time .
However , the series of plant remains already obtained will probably be regarded as sufficient to establish the palseobotanical horizons of the Sweet and Sulphur Coal Series .
The Sweet Coal Series belongs to the Middle Coal Measures and the higher Sulphur Coal Series , overlying the Sweet Coals to a higher , the Transition Coal Measures .
It has further been ascertained that both the Middle and Transition Coal Measures in the Wyre Forest consist of red-grey measur , and both contain Espley rocks .
The distribution of the two series in the coalfield ( see map , p. 367 ) has in some respects been found to be different to what has previously been imagined .
In particular it has been shown conclusively , as I think , that in Dowles Valley Region not only do the beds belong to the Middle Coal Measures ( Sweet Coal Series ) , but that more than 1000 feet of these sediments are there developed , as is also the case at Shatterford .
These beds I regard as the lower barren portion of this horizon .
The stratigraphical succession of the productive measures in the Wyre Forest appears to be as follows :\#151 ; Transition Coal Measures ( Sulphur Coal Series ) .
" Red-grey measures with Espleys , Spirorbis-limestones and J a few coals , of which some are sufficiently thick to be workable .
These beds are at least 400 feet thick in the Mamble Region , where the coal seams occur near the base of the series .
Unconformity ( " Symond Fault " ) .
Middle Coal Measures ( Sweet Coal Series ) .
\lt ; r Red-grey measures with Espleys , and coals near the top and bottom of the series , which is over 1000 feet in thickness , and possibly 1500 feet thick in places .
The higher coals '-are alone of workable thickness .
The beds of the Sweet and Sulphur Coal Series appear to be indistinguishable lithologically , except that Spiroi'bis limestones are known from the latter , but not from the former .
While these limestones form no safe index of horizon , as has been pointed out here , they have been of much use locally in tracing the limits of the higher series , as Mr. Daniel Jones ' work has shown .
There is however another and better means of distinguishing between these series , namely , by their fossil floras .
The two floras arq quite distinct , and belong to different horizons .
The Middle Coal Measures flora of the Wyre Forest is a rich one , 55 species being recorded here , of which two are new species and four new records from Britain .
The Transition Coal Measures flora , as at present known , is smaller , 20 species being here described , of which one is a new British record .
It has been pointed out that the key to the general structure of the Wyre Forest , which must be always considered in relation to Coalbrookdale , is the recognition of the fact that in this area there are in reality four distinct coalfields .
The lower series of Coalbrookdale forms one of these , quite isolated from the second coalfield of the same age in the Wyre Forest , i.e. the Sweet Coal Series or Middle Coal Measures of the Highley , Shatterford and Dowles Valley Regions .
It has been shown that the fossil flora of the Lower Coal Series of Coalbrookdale indicates that these beds belong to the same horizon as the Sweet Coals of the Wyre Forest , though lithologically they are quite distinct .
Next we have , forming a bridge connecting these coalfields and partly overlying them , a third coalfield of a later age , i.e. , the upper series of Coalbrookdale plus the Sulphur Coal Series of the Highley Region .
These beds belong to the Transition Coal Measures ( see map on p. 367 ) .
The fourth coalfield is of the same age , and occurs in the extreme South of the DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
433 Coalbrookdale- Wy re Forest Region .
It appears to be quite isolated from the third field , though apparently it overlies a small part of the second , i.e. the Sweet Coals of the Dowles Valley Region .
It rests on rocks older than the Coal Measures .
It has been pointed out that the real affinities of these four coalfields are to be sought in the Shrewsbury and Le Botwood fields to the North , the Titterstone Clee Hills to the West , and perhaps the Newent Coalfield to the South .
These are termed the Welsh Borderland coalfields , and their history , as viewed in their lithology , appears to be similar , though there are some exceptions .
The thin , lower series of Coalbrookdale , in particular , is of the Midland facies , and consists of grey measures , and in this respect there is a possible comparison with the Midland and South Pennine Coalfields .
Otherwise the Welsh Borderland chain seems to be quite remote from the fields to the East and North-east , although the same horizons may , and do also occur there .
The agreement between the Titterstone Clee field and the Sweet Coals of the Wyre Forest is very marked .
Espleys occur in the red-grey measures of both , which have been shown here , on the plant evidence , to belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
With regard to the other Welsh Borderland fields our knowledge , particularly of the fossil floras , is at present too limited to enable us to institute a close comparison .
Such evidence as exists , however , points to the conclusion , at least provisional , that these coalfields are related , not only tectonically , but in possessing in common a peculiar facies of Coal Measure sediments , and therefore a similar history .
From an economic standpoint these coalfields are not built on productive lines .
The measures are to some extent productive , both of coal and iron , particularly the lower series of Coalbrookdale .
This series may possibly be related to the Midland and South Pennine Coalfields , but it is very difficult to see any relationship between the other coalfields and those situated further to the East .
The Claverley Boring , which might have been expected to throw some light on these questions , has proved curiously inconclusive , and there is even dispute as to which Coalfield the beds here penetrated belong .
The question how far to the West the South Staffordshire coalfield extends is still as doubtful as ever , and the conclusions of the present inquiry do not support Ramsay's# contention of a possible unity between the South Staffordshire and Wyre Forest , Coalfields .
It is obvious that , if these conclusions be accepted , several of the more fundamental beliefs with regard to the geology of the Coal Measures are severely shaken , if not undermined .
I refer to the faith in the constancy of lithological types , to the credit given to the theory of an originally continuous sheet of measures , far spread over wide areas , and to the consequent belief in what I may , perhaps , call excessive denudation .
In the past undoubtedly too great reliance has been placed on the constancy in the vertical distribution of particular lithological types in different areas .
In my * Ramsay ( 71 ) , p. 465 , and ( 77 ) .
VOL. CCIV.-\#151 ; B. experience nothing is truer concerning the Coal Measures than the assertion that every lithological type , be it arenaceous , argillaceous , calcareous , or carbonaceous , is typically inconstant and impersistent laterally .
The Coal Measures are essentially an interlocked series of lenticles , thick or thin , long or short .
There are , of course , many noteworthy exceptions which spring to the memory , and these , perhaps , in the past have done more to mislead us in our general conception of the Coal Measures than we are inclined to admit .
But if these exceptions be examined it will be found .that they derive their value solely from the fact that they are in reality local phenomena , and not actually widely spread .
An exception may hold good over a large coalfield .
The Pennant Grit of the South Wales Coalfield is an example .
But when we take a more than local view the exceptional nature of this phenomenon is at once established .
Where is the Pennant Grit in the Forest of Dean Coalfield , * and , conversely , what is the equivalent of the Forest of Dean Stone in South Wales ?
We have seen ( p. 404 ) that the occurrence of / S^Vor^s-limestones is no guide to the horizon , and now Espley Grits , on the occurrence of which so much stress has been laid in the Midland and Southern Pennine Coalfields as absolutely indicative of a particular horizon , have failed when the test is applied more widely .
Again , in the Armorican system of coalfields in the West of England , and also in the Welsh Borderland coalfield of Titterstone Clee Hill , most of the rocks , which resemble lithologically the Millstone Grits of the Northern Pennine fields , have been shown on faunal evidence to be of Lower Carboniferous age .
Or we may instance again the red series of the upper portion of the Middle Coal Measures in Cumberland , the Whitehaven Sandstone , which was mistaken by Sedgwick for Permian , f Many other instances might be quoted , but these will suffice .
It is therefore no argument that , because the Sweet Coal Series of the Wyre Forest consists of red-grey measures with Espleys , these beds must be the equivalents of the beds of corresponding lithological character in the Southern Pennine and Midland Coalfields .
As a matter of fact they are not , as their flora clearly shows .
The sole test of horizon is palaeontology , and not lithology .
For many years past it has been apparent to those who are working out the horizons of the British coalfields on the plant evidence that the continuous-sheet theory of God win-Austen and others is only exceptionally true .
In many cases the horizons found to be represented in neighbouring coalfields do not agree .
But I doubt if any previous consideration is likely to be more convincing than a study of the Welsh Borderland system of coalfields .
It appears quite impossible to imagine that these areas , related as they are , once formed a continuous sheetj of Coal Measures from Shropshire , through Worcestershire , to Gloucestershire .

I The effects of late or post-Carboniferous faulting are , of course , not included in this consideration .
DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST .
435 In order to emphasise this point I propose to restore in outline the general history of the Welsh Borderland , in Carboniferous times , as briefly as possible .
I shall not attempt here to explain the conditions which resulted in the deposition of red measures as opposed to grey , or to account for their existence .
At the close of Lower Carboniferous times , it would appear that the whole of the Welsh Borderland was dry land , undergoing rapid denudation , a denudation which had , in a large part of the area , begun long before this period , and certainly continued long after .
The old Palaeozoic floor , on which the Coal Measures were eventually deposited , consisted of a great variety of sediments , chiefly of Silurian and Devonian age , with very limited areas of Carboniferous Limestone in the Coalbrookdale and Clee Hill regions .
Further , this floor consisted of rocks which , in part at least , had been folded prior to the deposition of the Devonian beds , as Prof. Lapworth# has shown .
The Old Bed Sandstone deposited on the folded floor naturally conformed to some extent to its tectonic structure .
This floor is best studied in the Midland area , where the measures rest directly on Silurian rocks , except in the Southern and Northern parts of the field , where there is some evidence of the existence of Old Bed Sandstone , !
Carboniferous Limestone .
J and Millstone Grit .
We have , then , prior to the beginning of Upper Carboniferous times , the existence of an unevenS and , in part , folded floor , on which the Coal Measures were eventually deposited .
This fact , I believe , is more than any other the key to the solution of the difficult stratigraphy of the W. ire Forest and the neighbouring coalfields .
With the commencement of the Upper Carboniferous period we find the denudation of this ancient floor still in progress , and that it continued during the period when the Millstone Grit and Lower Coal Measures were being deposited in the Southern and Northern Pennine areas .
There is no real evidence that true Millstone Grits were ever laid down along the Welsh Borderland , for there is very little doubt that the beds so named , which occupy a very limited area in Coalbrookdale , and perhaps at Baginswood , to the west of the Highley Begion , will eventually share the same fate as those of Titterstone Clee Hill , || which have been recently shown to belong to the Lower Carboniferous Series , and to be unconformable to the true Coal Measures there developed .
We find , then , everywhere in the Welsh Borderland a great unconformity between the Coal Measures and the uneven floor of older rocks below .
During Middle Coal Measure times , the greater part of the area remained elevated , * * * S * Lapworth ( 98 ) , p. 362 ; Groom ( 00 ) , p. 175 .

though local subsidence took place in three distinct areas , over which either estuarine or lacustrine conditions now prevailed .
These three areas were the northern part of Coalbrookdale , the Highley , Shatterford and Dowles Brook Regions of the Wyre Forest , and the Titterstone Clee Hills , with possibly other small outliers .
In my opinion there is no evidence to show that these areas were ever connected with one another .
To assume this conclusion necessitates a theory of subsequent excessive denudation to account for the facts .
On the other hand , not only is this assumption unnecessary , but there is , so far as I am aware , no evidence that the denudation of the Welsh Borderland has ever exceeded in amount the normal denudation exhibited by all our British coalfields , which have not been covered up , since early Mesozoic times , with a blanket of newer deposits .
Denudation of an ordinary or normal amount is not denied .
I refer here simply to the theory of excessive or extraordinary denudation , which has more than once been postulated in respect to these coalfields.* The measures deposited in these three essentially local hollows of the old Palaeozoic floor were diverse , because different conditions prevailed in different parts of the area .
In the northern portion ( Coalbrookdale ) , a very thin grey series , of little more than 200 feet in thickness , rich in coals and ironstones , was laid down under conditions essentially similar , apparently , to those affecting the Midland and Southern Pennine areas at the same period .
Further South , in the Wyre Forest and at Clee Hill , the conditions were different , and a dissimilar set of alternating red and grey measures , poor in coal and still more so in iron , resulted .
In the alternating lithological facies of the beds of the higher horizon , one seems to see evidence of a constant struggle between two sets of conditions , the one giving rise to grey measures , and the other to red .
From the first , in the Welsh Borderland , except in the Lower Series of Coalbrookdale , the conditions resulting in red rocks always had the upper hand , and by the Keele period they had suppressed entirely , so to speak , the conditions giving rise to grey measures .
The next epoch in the history of our area was the elevation of the whole , with consequent denudation , and the folding of the measures .
These events appear to have taken place in the order stated.f In the Welsh Borderland , we have clear evidence of inter-carboniferous movements and folds .
; f The result is that , wherever Coal Measures had been deposited , it is found that the newer measures subsequently laid down on them are unconformable ( the Symond Fault , so called ) .
This gap in time , representing a cessation of deposition and a period of elevation , was not inconsiderable , neither was it very great .
It lasted into the Transition Coal Measure period , when parts of the Welsh Borderland were again depressed , with con- * Randall ( 71 ) , ( 73 ) ; Jones ( 712 ) , p. 207 ; ( 71s ) , p. 371 ; ( 732 ) , p. 350 ; Lapworth ( 98 ) , p. 369 .

437 sequent deposition in the irregular hollows of the eroded land surface .
Here again , although the depression was more general than before , it was essentially local , or rather of such a nature as to lead to local deposition .
The North-western part of Shropshire became for the first time involved , and the Transition Coal Measures of the Shrewsbury and Le Botwood field were initiated .
It is noteworthy that here , as elsewhere , red-grey conditions prevailed at this period , and wherever the red element is present and in the ascendant we find a corresponding decrease in the thickness and abundance of the carbonaceous types .
Again further South , in Coalbrookdale and the Wyre Forest , two new coalfields of Transition Measures were initiated , partly over-lying the older Middle Coal Measure fields , but in reality simply filling up hollows without particular reference to the rocks below .
These are the Sulphur Coal Series of Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest , forming as already explained ( p. 423 ) two distinct coalfields .
The local nature of these subsidences is seen in the Clee Hills , where there is no evidence at present that the latter beds were deposited at all .
There the old Middle Coal Measure field remained isolated .
No doubt a chain of such small , local subsidences extended as far to the South as Newent .
Finally , in Keele times , deposition ceased to be local , and all the areas , except the Clee Hills , were connected by a vast , wide-spread sheet of Upper Coal Measures , of , for the first time , regional distribution .
Further the whole region was folded by important post-Carboniferous earth movements , and thus brought into tectonic relationship.* This folding was complex in origin and direction . !
Such appears to me to be an outline of the history of this district , and one which does not demand a theory of excessive subsequent denudation , and which is certainly opposed to any hypothesis that the measures of these coalfields ah initio formed a continuous sheet of regional distribution .
