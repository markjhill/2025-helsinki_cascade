388 The Development of Trypanosomes Tsetse Flies .
Conclusions .
1 .
That Trypanosoma gambiense multiplies in the gut of about one in every 20 G-lossina palpalis which have fed on an infected animal .
2 .
That the flies become infective , on an average , 34 days after their first feed .
3 .
That a fly may remain infective for 75 days .
4 .
That Trypanosoma dimorphon , Trypanosoma and Trypanosoma nanum may also multiply in Glossina palpalis , which must therefore be looked upon as a possible carrier in these diseases .
