miralty , and communicated to the Society by the President .
These experiments were undertaken with the view of ascertaining whether the action of steam upon the hull of an iron vessel affects a compass , properly placed , in any degree that may bof practical importance in its navigation ; and also whether the keeling of the vessel produces any alteration in the deviations , or disturbs a compass so placed to any considerable extent .
The former question is , from the results of these experiments , resolved in the negative ; but with respect to the second , it appears that the deviations produced by keeling are very marked , and could not be safely disregarded .
These observations completely confirm those already made by Mr. Walker and Commander Shaugh on board H.M. Iron Brig Recruit , ' Commander A. Slade , and they prove the necessity that exists for ascertaining the deviations of the compass in all ships , not only at the beginning and end of their voyage , but likewise at intermediate
