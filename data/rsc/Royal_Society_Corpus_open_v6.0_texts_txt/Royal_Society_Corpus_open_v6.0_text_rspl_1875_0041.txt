[ Feb. 17 , Since bromine and iodine chloride appear to have the same volume in union with ethene that they have when uncombined , it is not unreasonable to suppose that the same may be true of ethene itself , viz. that at its boiling-point it would possess the same volume which it has in the bromide and chloriodide at their respective boiling-points .
On this assumption the specific gravity of liquid ethene would be\#151 ; III .

In July 1800 Nicholson and Carlisle first effected the decomposition of water by the pile of Volta ; and they were not a little surprised when the constituent gases of the water appeared separately at some considerable distance from each other* , but they offered no opinion as to the cause of so singular a phenomenon .
A little later Cruickshank also decomposed water by the pile , and , for the first time , many metallic salts f. He also , like Nicholson and Carlisle , was much struck by the appearance of the compounds round poles separated some distance , and attempted to explain the phenomenon by supposing that the principle of galvanism could exist in an oxygenated and deoxygenated condition\#151 ; that in entering water at the negative end , it combined with oxygen , liberating hydrogen , and that on arriving at the positive end the oxygen either escaped or combined with the wire J. This hypothesis , which involves the idea of an imponderable capable of combining with ponderables , underwent various modifications by Eourcroy and Vauquelin and Thenard , and by Dr. Bostock and others .
But the next step of importance to the theory of electrolysis was the idea of the passage into or through the liquid of one or both constituents of the electrolyte , which was first roughly foreshadowed by an anonymous correspondent of Nicholson 's Journal ( vol. iv .
p. 472 ) , and which was thus more explicitly expressed in 1807 by Sir H. DavyThe oxygen of a portion of water is attracted by the positive surface at the same time that the other constituent part , the hydrogen , is repelled by it , and the opposite process takes place at the negative surface ; and in the Calculated from f !

iddle or neutral point of the circuit , whether there be a series of de-(mpositions and recompositions , or whether the particles from the etreme points only are active , there must be a new combination of the ipelled matter .
" ( Phil. Trans. 1807 , p. 30 .
) The next enrichment of the subject was by Grotthus * , who contended at since in the elementary combinations of the pile of Volta , as in a agnet , there is polarity , it would establish a like condition in the ements of water .
Faraday , accepting the notion of polarity , added the necessary corol-ry , the idea of the revolution of the molecules of the electrolyte t , which , i far as I am aware , is the last important contribution to the theory of le subject .
If the condition of an electrolyte just prior to , and in the act of , de-jmposition be in accordance with the views of Grotthus and Faraday , g enunciated , an electrolyte may , it appears to me , be regarded as a ielectric whose molecules are possessed of the power of mutually ex-hanging their constituents during discharge .
This view , jointly with ome supposed points of resemblance between magnetic and electrolytic iibstances to which it is unnecessary here to refer , led me to undertake he experiments detailed in this communication .
Experiment I.\#151 ; A piece of thin copper wire about an inch long was uspended lengthwise , by a piece of cotton , between the copper electrodes distant about 4 inches ) of a Grove 's battery + , and immersed in a 5-per-ent .
solution of potassium chloride .
Gas was at once given off from he end of the wire facing the positive pole , and after the lapse of i few minutes the end facing the negative battery-pole was found ; orroded .
Experiment II.\#151 ; Four small upright wooden posts 1 inch high were fixed perpendicularly and 1 inch apart in a wooden stand 5 inches long .
Slits were made in the tops of these posts , and in them were inserted strips of thin sheet silver .
The whole arrangement , " as in the figure , was then placed in a glass vessel containing a 5-per cent , solution of copper sulphate mixed with a little potassium chloride , the silver strips being arranged lengthwise in a * Arm , de Chimie , vol. lviii .

These quantitative experiments also accord with the view of Grotthus .
Nos. 3 and 4 would show that the whole of the molecules of the electrolyte were equipolarized , which follows from the fact that in any given section of the liquid there must have been the same number of polarized particles as in that in immediate contact with the electrodes ; whereas in Experiments V. and VI .
it would appear that the number of polarized particles increases as the section is removed from the electrodes , and the intensity of the action in any definite space is accordingly diminished .
Grotthus 's view , however , as it appears to me , does not account for the difference of polarization of the molecules in the vicinity of the two electrodes , as exhibited in Experiments V. and VI .
The principal source of error in the foregoing experiments is the difficulty of placing the strips in a straight line and perfectly parallel m direction ; for if not parallel to the line joining the electrodes , the !

[ Feb. 17 strips , after the lapse of thirty minutes , not a trace of copper could be seen on the glass , a little on the negative end of the charcoal ( facing the positive electrode ) , and more on the platinum .
Experiment IX.\#151 ; In the centre of a glass trough , containing a 5-percent .
solution of potassium chloride , was fixed a post midway between platinum electrodes 5 inches apart .
Pieces of different metals 1| inch long and 5 inch wide were successively inserted in a slit in the upper part of the post , lengthwise in a line with the poles , and the amouut of gas given off from the negative extremity during five minutes was determined .

I/ O " In the language of G-rotthus 's hypothesis , the foregoing experiments may be explained thus:\#151 ; The greater amount of copper found on the longer silver strip in Experiment VII .
may be accounted for ( 1 ) by its being subjected to the influence of a greater number of polarized molecules , ( 2 ) by its tendency to electric equilibration being less , and ( 3 ) by the smaller number of molecules between its ends and the battery-electrodes inducing a more rapid discharge .
The absence of copper on the glass , the presence of a little on the carbon , and more on the platinum in Experiment VIII .
is explained by the difference in the capability of these bodies to be polarized en masse .
The results of Experiment IX .
are due in great part to the specific affinities of the metals for the chlorine of the potassium chloride ; in great part , because the different metals are polarized en masse with more or less facility , and the result is affected accordingly ; but were the conductivity of the metals equal , we might expect the rapidity of the discharge to be proportional to the specific affinities .
It now appeared desirable to obtain some experimental knowledge of the general direction of the lines of the discharge between electrodes of small dimensions .
Eor this purpose 198 silver strips were placed in as many posts fixed into a wooden stand .
The arrangement of these , as well as the position in which the electrodes were placed , is shown in the accompanying diagram .
Connexion was made with the battery for an hour , after which the copper sulphate was removed from the trough , and each strip examined .
Those on which copper was visible , as well as its position on the strip , are thus marked in the figure , ( \#151 ; 1\#151 ; ; t signifies the merest trace , and ?
doubtful .
The position of the copper on the strips , indicative as it is of their Letter to the President .
376 , ] metrical condition , illustrates in a striking manner the electrical condi-m of the molecules in the vicinity of the poles .
It is also evident that ; e electric influence spreads itself out in the electrolyte , in the same j , y that the magnetic influence does in the magnetic field .

I hope to do this so soon as time nd opportunity permit .
The work recorded above is in no way inconsistent with those current iews which are usually expressed in the language of Ohm 's laws ; but diile those views deal rather with results , the views propounded above efer to the physical processes involved , and appear to unite the different inds of electricity more closely together .
