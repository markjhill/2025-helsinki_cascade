On the Action of Chloride of Zinc on Codeia .

On endeavouring to prepare apomorphia by a cheap method , Mr. Mayer and one of us heated morphia with chloride of zinc , to see whether the elements of water could not be abstracted by this reagent ( the results of this reaction have not yet been published ) .
Apomorphia having been obtained in this manner , it seemed possible that apocodeia , that is codeia minus the elements of water , might be prepared by a similar reaction .
On trying the experiment a new base was obtained , which proved on analysis to be apocodeia .
When hydrochlorate of codeia is heated with an excess of a concentrated solution of chloride of zinc , to a temperature varying between 170 ' and 180 ' C. , for about 15 minutes , the decomposition takes place ; on cooling a yellowish-brown tarry mass separates from the liquid , which on further cooling may be drawn into thin threads , and thus obtained almost free from the excess of the chloride of zinc .
This amorphous silk-like mass is almost pure hydrochlorate of apocodeia .
To obtain the base in a pure state from this substance , the following method was employed:\#151 ; The hydrochlorate was dissolved in hot water and precipitated by hy- On the Action of Chloride of Zinc on .

The liquid containing the precipitated hydrochlorate was allowed to cool , and the precipitate on solidifying was separated from the acid solution .
The operation of dissolving and reprecipitating with hydrochloric acid was repeated several times , and lastly the hydrochlorate was dissolved in water , precipitated with carbonate of sodium , and the base extracted with ether .
On evaporating the ether-solution the base remained behind as an amorphous , gum-like , reddish mass ; this was powdered , dried in a water-bath , and gave on analysis the following results .
All combustions were made with oxide of copper and oxygen .

The base itself is soluble in alcohol , ether , and chloroform , but almost insoluble in water , and has not yet been obtained in the crystalline state .
The hydrochlorate , obtained by shaking the ether-solution of the pure base with hydrochloric acid , and evaporating the acid solution to dryness , gave the following on analysis : \#151 ; 0*563 gramme of the hydrochlorate gave 0*256 chloride of silver .

were found to be almost identical , the most marked of the few differences being that the blood-red colour given with nitric acid is much more permanent than in the similar apomorphia reaction .
Between the two bases also a very marked difference exists in respect of stability , apocodeia being far superior in this respect to apomorphia ; in fact it may be precipitated by ammonia or carbonate of sodium , washed and dried , without undergoing a marked change of colour .
The hydrochlorates also differ ; for that of apomorphia can be easily crystallized , whereas hydrochlorate of apocodeia has only been obtained in an amorphous state .
The preparation of apocodeia is easy and sure , yielding a very large product .
In this respect it differs materially from apomorphia , the preparation of which is tedious , and the amount of yield very uncertain , hence the high price of this valuable therapeutical agent .
The solutions of the two hydrochlorates also show the same differences that the bases themselves do .
In physiological effects also there is a decided difference between the hydrochlorates , that of apomorphia being , as observed by Dr. Gee , a very violent emetic , whilst that of apocodeia is , according to Dr. Legg 's experiments , a mild emetic ; it also produces subcutaneous abscesses at the place of injection , which the apomorphia salt does not .
It has been shown in Part II .
( Proc. Roy .
Soc. vol. xvii .
p. 460 ) of these researches , that when codeia is heated with hydrochloric acid it splits up into chloride of methyl , water , and apomorphia .
The action of hydriodic acid on narcotine for the elimination of the methyl contained in it is , however , more energetic than that of hydrochloric acid .
Therefore it was thought probable that , by means of hydriodic acid , CH2 might be abstracted alone , as iodide of methyl , from the codeia , leaving the elements of water , and thus forming morphia .
On trying the experiment , however , not a trace of iodide of methyl was obtained , but the iodide of a new base , which is at present under examination .
The codeia with which the foregoing experiments were made was kindly presented to us by Messrs. McFarlan and Co. , of Edinburgh , to whose liberality we are already so much indebted .
