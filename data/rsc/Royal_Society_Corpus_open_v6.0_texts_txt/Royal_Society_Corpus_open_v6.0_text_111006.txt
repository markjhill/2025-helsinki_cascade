" Microscopical examination of the contents of the Hepatic Ducts .
" By Thomas Wharton Jones , Esq. , F.R.S. On a microscopical examination of the matter contained in the larger hepatic ducts , the author has observed what he considers the debris of broken-up hepatic cells , in the form of free nuclei , a granulous substance , oil-globules and fragments of cell-walls ; while in the matter contained in the smaller branches of the duct , entire cells of hepatic parenchyma may , in addition , be seen .
These facts the author adduces as proofs that the cells of hepatic parenchyma are analogous to the endogenous cells , or true secretory corpuscles of the pancreas and other glands ; and he infers that as the endogenous cells of other glands are constantly being reproduced , successively cast off , received into the radicles of the ducts ( into which the containing vesicles or tubules of the former open ) , broken up and resolved into the secreted matter , so the cells of hepatic parenchyma are received into the radicles of the hepatic duct as they are successively cast off , and are there broken up and resolved into bile .
This conclusion , namely , that the hepatic cells are analogous to the endogenous cells of other glands , as was first suggested by Professor Henle of Heidelberg , and not to glandular vesicles as has been assumed by some , the author considers as throwing light on the anatomical relation of the hepatic cells to the radicles of the hepatic ducts .
