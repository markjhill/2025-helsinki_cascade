A New Method of Solving Numerical Equations of all Orders , by continuous Approximation .
By W. G. Horner , Esq. Communicated by Davies Gilbert , Esq. F.R.S. Read July 1 , 1819 .

] The process which the author endeavours to establish in this essay , being the leading theorem in the calculus of derivations , presented under a new aspect , may , he says , be regarded as an universal instrument of calculations , extending to the composition as well as analysis of functions of every kind , but it promises to be especially useful in the numerical solution of equations .
Mr. Horner then proceeds to the illustration of his method , and to explain the investigations to which it is applicable , by details which do not admit of explanation .
