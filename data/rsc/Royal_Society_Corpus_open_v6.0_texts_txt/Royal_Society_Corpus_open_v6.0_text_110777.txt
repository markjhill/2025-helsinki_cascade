The reading of a paper , entitled , " Sixth Letter on Voltaic Com ?
binations , " addressed to Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , Fullerian Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great Britain , &amp; c , by John Frederic Daniell , Esq. , Foreign Sec. R.S. , Professor of Chemistry in King 's College , London , was resumed and concluded .
The purport of this letter is to follow the consequences of the law of Ohm , and the expressions which result from it , relative to the electromotive force , and to the resistances in the course of a voltaic circuit ; to apply this theory to the verification of the conclusions which the author had formerly deduced from his experiments ; and to suggest additional experiments tending to remove some obscurities and ambiguities which existed in his former communications .
In following out these principles , the author is led to offer various practical remarks on the different forms of voltaic batteries which have been proposed with a view either to the advancement of our theo ?
retical knowledge of the science , or to the service of the arts .
The author enters more particularly into an explanation of the principles on which the cylindric arrangement of the battery he has intro ?
duced is founded , which appear to him to have been greatly misunderstood .
The formulae and the calculations which form the body of this paper are not of a nature to admit of being reported in the present abstract .
