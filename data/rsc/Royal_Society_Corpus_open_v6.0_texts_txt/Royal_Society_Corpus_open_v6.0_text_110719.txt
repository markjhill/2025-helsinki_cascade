A communication was also read , entitled " Supplementary Note to a Paper , entitled ' Researches in Embryology .
Third Series : a Contribution to the Physiology of Cells/ " By Martin Barry , M.D. , F.R.S. , L. &amp; Ed. In the paper referred to , the author had shown , that after the ovum of the Rabbit has entered the Fallopian tube , cells are found col ?
lected around its thick transparent membrane or " zona pellucida " ; which cells , by coalescing , form a thinner membrane ?
the incipient chorion .
He now adds , that the formation of this thinner membrane does not exhaust the whole layer of these cells ; but that a stratum of them is found remaining on , and entirely surrounding the " zona " , after the thinner membrane has risen from it .
The fluid space also , between the " zona " and the thinner membrane , presents a large number of cells or discoid objects , each of which contains a brilliantly pellucid and highly refracting globule .
In some parts , several of these discs , closely joined together , have the appearance of shreds of membrane ; in others , there are found pellucid globules , some of which are exceedingly minute .
The discs now mentioned collect at the periphery , for the thickening of the chorion .
They seem to proceed from the region of the " zona " ; and probably have their origin in the cells by which the latter is surrounded .
If so , the author thinks we cannot suppose them to arise in any other way than that which , according to his observations , appears to be the universal mode of reproduction ; namely , by division of the nuclei of the pa ?
rent cells .
Nor can we suppose that minuteness is any hinderance to their subsequent increase by the same means .
