The Resin of Gamboge , or Gummi Gut .
THE medical and commercial values of the several varieties of garnboge which occur as articles of commerce in the European markets , and their botanical origin , have lately been investigated by Dr. CHRISTISON* .
He found the different varieties to contain respectively Siam .

Like many of the other resins , acid as well as basic , it retains with considerable obstinacy the last traces of these solvents , and requires the prolonged action of a temperature above that of complete fusion fully to expel them .

5*32 grains of the resin precipitated by water from its solution in alcohol , dried and fused at 212 ?

To be certain that alcohol and ether were absent , the resin was dissolved in caustic potash , precipitated by muriatic acid , washed , dried , and fused at 3500 FAHR. In this state it fused less readily , and was of a darker colour .

19-986 19'874 20'424 20-351 20-351 100 100 100 100 100 It is difficult to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion in regard to the true formula for this acid resin .
The results of analysis approach exceedingly near to the beautifully simple formula C5 H3 0 , or C40 H24 0 , , which gives Calculated .
Experiment .
C5 = 382*185 = 73'550 72-763 H3 = 37'438 = 7'205 7'363 10 = 100'000 = 19'245 19-874 519'623 100 100 This formula is further interesting , because of the close relation it would establish between oil of turpentine and its resin , and that of gamboge ; since Oil of turpentine .
C5 H4 { = C IH 0 .
The fact , however , that in all the analyses there is a constant deficiency of carbon to the amount of nearly one per cent. , renders the formula suspicious .
It is true that the gambodic acid has a strong affinity or attraction for ether and alcohol , and that a certain quantity of these substances may have been present in some of the specimens analysed ; yet it would be necessary to suppose a much larger admixture of them than seems possible , in order to account for so great a diminution in the per centage of carbon .
Neither can we admit the presence of these substances in the resin after solution in potash , though the carbon in this also is considerably less than the formula requires .
In order to determine whether a still higher temperature than 350 ?
FAHR. would drive off a further portion of alcohol from the resin precipitated from its solution by water , I heated it to 400 ?
+ FAHR. , when it ceased to emit its agreeable fragrant odourt gave off white vapours , and became slightly darker in colour .
In this state 11-38 grains gave C= 30'23 , H= 6-73 grains , or per cent. , Carbon = 73-791 Hydrogen = 6 ' 601 Oxygen = 21'608 100 282 The carbon here is sufficiently great , but there is much too little hydrogen for the formula ( C5 IH3 O ) , to which this resin seems so closely to approximate .
After fusion at this temperature , however , the gambodic acid was no longer wholly soluble in alcohol , nearly one half of its bulk being left behind in the form of a yellow powder when digested in this liquid .
This powder was collected , washed with alcohol , and heated for a long time at 212 ?
+ FAHR. previous to analysis .
At 400 ?
FAHR. it undergoes no apparent change ; at 500 ?
FAHR. it becomes brown , and gradually darkens , but does not mnelt .
7'30 grains gave C= 18'93 , and IH 4'62 , or per cent. , Experiment .
Calculated .
Carbon -= 71703 72-033 Hydrogen = 7'031 6'762 Oxygen = 21'266 21'205 100 100 This result agrees with the formula C40 H22 Oy , according to which the second column is calculated .
The formula which most nearly represents the result of experiments on the unchanged resin is C48 H29 010 .
This gives per cent. C48 = 3668'976 = 72'929 H29 = 361'908 = 7*193 10= 1000'000 = 19'878 5030'884 100-000 in which there is an allowance for loss of carbon and for a similar slight excess of hydrogen in the results of analysis , being the directions in which errors are likely to occur .
It is satisfactorily ascertained , however , that the gamboge of commerce , as we have found reason to conclude is the case with dragon 's blood , undergoes a process of manufacture before it is brought to market .
Like the reed dragon 's blood , it has all the appearance of having been fused and moulded into shapes ; the effect of such fusion in the case of the red resin is , as we have seen* , to diminish the amount of carbon about one per cent. , and if we suppose a similar change produced on the gamboge , the deficiency of carbon in the analysis will be sufficiently accounted for .
The likelihood of an analogous change in the two resins is the greater , as they belong apparently to a kindred group , the several members of which are related almost as closely as mastic and colophony .
On comparing the quantity of hydrogen found by analysis with that given by the formula C40 H24 O , 7*205 per cent. , we find them approach so closely as scarcely to allow for the necessary errors of experiment , but in the reed dragon 's blood there was a similar deficiency , so that until we have the opportunity of analysing the gamboge resin as it issues from the tree , we might adopt the formula to which the results appear to point .
There is an analogy , however , in favour of the formula containing one equivalent less of hydrogen , which is not unworthy of attention .
When heated above 400 ?
FAHR. we have seen that this resin is partly changed into a nearly insoluble resin = C40 H22 09 , that is C40 H23 08 +t In like manner mastic resin when so heated is in part changed into C40 H30 05 , that is C40 H31 04{+ o. It is reasonable to suppose that the nature of the change which takes place is the same in both ; and though I do not consider , notwithstanding the precautions adopted , that the number of atoms of hydrogen in any of the formulae I have given for the resins can be considered absolutely certa in , yet there being a reasonable probability that mastic resin A , is represented by C40 H31 04 , there is reason from the present analogy to infer that gamboge resin is C40 H23 08 .
One interesting and important fact may be considered as established , whichever of these formulae be adopted , that a small change in the number of atoms of hydrogen only , may give birth to new resins possessed of very different properties .
We have for example , Colophony = C40 H30 04 Liebig .
Mastic A. = C40 H31 04 represented generally by C40 IH2-a 04 the resin of which C40 132 04 is the formula , being undetermined .
And we have also Resin of dragon 's blood = C40 H21 08 Resin of gamboge ... .= C40 H23 O ?
And the general formula C40 H24-x 08 may represent a second large group , of which , as in the former , only two members are as yet determined .
In the present stage of our inquiry it would be premature to dwell on theoretical indications as to what we may hereafter expect to meet with , but it may be remarked that H32 and H24 seem to point to a series , of which H64 , H16 and H8 are members , and which may respectively form the starting-points as it were , of new groups .
Salts of Gambodic Acid .
Gambodiates of Potash and Soda.-The salts of the alkaline metals may be formed by dissolving or digesting the acid in solutions of the caustic alkalies .
In strong solutions the salt is very ingly soluble , sol that by digesting the acid in such solution , the compounds may easily be obtained in a solid state .
In colour they are somewhat darker than the pure resin , and very soluble in pure water , giving reddishbrown solutions , and though more sparingly , yet still largely soluble in alcohol .
They are decomposed by the dilute mineral acids , which precipitate the acid from its saline solutions unchanged , and in the form of a pale-yellow bulky powder .
Gambodiate of Ammonia.-Gambodic acid dissolves slowly in dilute caustic amnmonia , giving a brownish-red solution .
The solution is most readily obtained by adding caustic ammonia to the alcoholic solution of the acid , diluting largely with water and distilling or boiling off the alcohol and excess of ammonia .
Evaporated to dryness at a temperature below 212 ?
FAHR. , it leaves a brittle resinous mass having the colour of the acid .
Instead of the fragrant smell of the resin , however , it has assumed a faint unpleasant animal odour .
It is insoluble in pure water , but dissolves on the addition of a little caustic ammonia .
It dissolves also in alcohol , and is decomposed by the mineral acids .
Boiled in a solution of caustic potash , ammonia is evolved and a salt of potash formed .
Its solution in water precipitates the ammonia nitrate of silver and the ammonia acetate of lead ( PAYEN'S salt ) of a yellow colour , and the ammonia sulphate of copper of a dark-reddish-brown .
Earthy and Metallic Salts.-On these salts I have made many experiments with results in some cases sufficiently discordant , and which led me at first to consider that the equivalent of this resin should be represented by ( C50o29010 ) , instead of 2 ( C4 , ,123 08 ) , as the analysis of the resin appears to indicate .
I am now inclined , however , to adopt the formula containing C40 , as entering into the expression for the gambodiates , and to attribute the observed differences between experiment and calculation to the difficulty of obtaining these as well as other resinous compounds in a perfectly pure state , especially free from mutual admixture .
To this conclusion I am further led by the study of the salts of mastic resin A , of which an account has already been given .
Properties of the Earthy and Metallic Gambodiates.-1 .
When fresh prepared from alcoholic solutions these salts are yellow , slightly soluble in alcohlol , and insoluble in water .
When first precipitated from solutions of chloride of calcium and nitrate of strontia , by means of ammonia , they are of a beautiful red , but by standing they subside yellow .
Precipitated from ammoniacal aqueous solutions , they are brownish or brownish-red .
2 .
Collected on the filter after precipitation from alcoholic solutions , washed with alcohol , and dried by pressure on bibulous paper , they are in the form of a beautifil yellow powder , in which state they remain , if dried by a very gentle heat in the open air , raised after a sufficient time to 212 ?
FAHR. If immediately on being dried by pressure as much as possible between folds of paper , they are exposed to a heat of upwards of 100 ?
FAHR. , they melt , and run into a thin liquid , which on cooling solidifies into a red brittle resin , giving a yellow powder .
This property , which is common to these with the salts of many other resins , appears to indicate a combination of the salts with alcohol , from the last portions of which , like the resins themselves , they 285 are with difficulty separated .
They may be heated , however , to 350 ?
or 400 ?
FAHR. .
without decomposition , emitting only the fragrant odour characteristic of the gambodic acid itself .
At or under this temperature they melt , those of the earths excepted , and on cooling assume the appearance of a reddish-brown resin , not unlike the acid , and like it giving a beautiful yellow powder .
At a higher temperature they are decomposed , giving off empyreumatic products .
The salt of silver is discoloured by exposure to the air , and when dry is of a dirty-dark-green .
They are all decomposed by boiling in acetic and dilute nitric acids .
I had spent much time in preparing these salts by means of alcoholic solutions , before I discovered that the resin possesses a property which enables us to prepare very many of its salts from aqueous solutions .
The garnbodiate of ammonia being soluble in dilute ammonia , and not precipitable by water , it is sufficient to add caustic ammonia to an alcoholic solution of the resin , and to dilute with water , when the addition of an ammoniacal solution of magnesia , oxide of manganese , oxide of copper , oxide of zinc , acetate of lead , or of any other oxide soluble in caustic ammonia , causes a precipitate of the corresponding gambodiate of a brownish-red colour .
By washing with dilute ammonia these may be obtained in a state of comparative purity* .
Analogous compounds may be formed by adding an alcoholic solution of the resin to similar solutions of the metallic salts with or without the addition of ammonia .
A. Salts of Lead.-1 .
When a solution of the resin in alcohol is mixed with one of acetate of lead , a yellow precipitate falls .
Washed with alcohol and dried per cent. a. At ... ... .
212 ?
FAHR. , 11'425 grs. gave 2'224 oxide of lead 19-466 b. After fusion , at 370 ?
FAHR. , 13'03 grs. gave 2-58 oxide of lead = 19-80 A second portion thrown down from a solution in which a large excess of resin was present gave only 17*36 per cent. of oxide .
A sesquisalt 3 ( C40 1123 O8 ) +2 Pb 0 , contains 18,32 per cent. of oxide , and it will be recollected that mastic resin A. in similar circumstances gave also a sesquisaltt .
2 .
To the mixed solutions as above , after the precipitate was separated , caustic ammonia was added with agitation .
The new precipitate was also yellow , but when washed and dried 14'74 grs. gave only 2,046 , or 13,88 per cent. of oxide of lead .
This agrees with the formula Pb 0+2 ( C40 H23 O ?
) which contains 14,40 per cent. of oxide , though it is not easy to understand why a bisalt should be thrown down when the solution is rendered more neutral by the addition of ammonia .
3 .
An aInmoniacal solution of the resin was diluted with water , and a solution of PAYEN 's ammoniacal subacetate of lead was added to it .
A yellow precipitate fell which was collected , carefilly washed , and dried at 212 ?
FAHR. At a low heat it took fire and burned like tinder , without melting .
grs. left 5'284 grs. of oxide of lead 49-231 per cent. This indicates three of base to one of acid ; the formula 3 Pb 0+ ( C40 H23 08 ) requiring 50'23 per cent. ; and this tribasic salt is precisely the analogue of the tribasic acetate from which it is formed .
After being digested in acetic acid , and again washed and dried , this salt lost fivesixths of its base , becoming a bisalt .
Thus 11 066 grains left 1-635 of oxide of lead = 14'777 per cent. ; the formula , as already stated , requiring 14-40 per cent. That an acid salt should be formed under these circumstances is what we should expect ; but whether a bisalt is the constant result I have not determined .
B. Salts of Copper.-1 .
A dilute antnmoniacal solution of the resin in water was mixed with one of ammoniaco-sulphate of copper ; a brownisl-yellow precipitate fell , which was washed with dilute anmmonia , and dried at 212 ?
FAHR. 11'037 burned in the air left 1-197 Cu =1 0845 per cent. 13'455 of another portion left 1 40 Cu = 10'405 per cent. A portion of the dry salt , after boiling in dilute ammonia , still left 10 994 per cent. of oxide .
These results indicate a neutral salt , the formula Cu + ( C40 H23 O0 ) requiring 10-68 per cent. of oxide of copper* .
2 .
A further portion of the salt was prepared by adding the ammoniacal resin to a solution of common sulphate of copper ; and , as this might contain excess of oxide , one portion of it was digested while moist in hot dilute ammonia .
When dried it left in two experiments 18-951 and 18'830 of oxide per cent. respectively .
Another portion was boiled in strong caustic ammonia , by which , as appeared from the colour of the solution , a portion of the acid was taken up .
Washed , dried , and burned , it left 14'666 per cent. of oxide of copper .
The former result agrees with 2 Cu + ( C40 H23 ) , which requires 19'31 per cent. of oxide .
The latter agrees with 3 Cu +2 ( C40 HI 08 ) , which requires 15-21 per cent. of oxide .
It is impossible , however , without several repetitions of these experiments , to say that these coincidences are more than accidental , though from analogy it appears probable that such compounds do exist .
Above all , their true nature can only be known by the ultimate analysis of the salts , -a work of great labour , but which I do not despair of being able to undertake .
By varying the mode of preparation I obtained a copper salt by direct precipitation , containing 14'824 per cent. of oxide , agreeing with one of those just described .
But if the three classes of salts above obtained be constant and definite , the circumstances under which they may be formed without failure requires further study .
C. Salts of Zinc.-The gambodiate of zinc is obtained by mixing the ammoniacal resin with a solution of zinc in ammonia , or with an ammoniacal solution of sulphate of zinc .
It is of a brownish-yellow colour .
If the solution be too largely diluted with water , an excess of oxide of zinc is apt to be thrown down along with the salt .
Thus the first portion I prepared gave me 14-17 per cent. of oxide of zinc , while another plrepared with more carl gave me in two experiments 11242 and 10*976 per cent. respectively .
A neutral salt = Zn 0+ ( C40 H23 08 ) , contains 10'83 per cent. oxide of zinc .
D. Salts of Lime , Strontia , and Magnesia.-a .
To alcoholic solutions of chloride of calcium and of nitrate of strontia , ammonia was added , and afterwards a solution of gamlbodic acid in alcohol .
The former gave an abundant , the latter a very sparing precipitate .
The mixed solutions at first became of a beautiful red colour , but the precipitate , as it fell , graduially assumed a more yellow shade .
Washed without access of air , and dried at 360 ?
, the lime salt gave in two experiments 6'119 and 6'192 per cent. of lime ; the strontia salt gave 9'877 per cent. of strontia .
If these results are to be depended upon , they indicate a sesquisalt in both cases ; since Ca +1 ( C40 H23 08 ) contains 5*72 per cent. of lime , and Sr 12 ( C40 I-I23 O8 ) contains 9'43 per cent. of strontia .
b. The ammoniacal resin in water gives , with ammoniacal sulphate of magnesia , a copious precipitate , which , dried and burned , yielded 4,542 and 4*681 per cent. of magnesia , which , however , is not reconcileable to any formula .
E. Salts of Silver.-1 .
Newly precipitated oxide of silver , digested in gambodic acid in alcohol , gave a dark-brown salt , which fused at 360 ?
FAHR ; and of which , when burned , 20*335 grains left 5*46 of silver = 28'762 per cent. of oxide .
A neutral salt , AgO + ( C40 H23 0 ?
) , contains 25'94 per cent. , to which the salt above obtained approximates .
It will be readily understood that very careful agitation would be required to bring all the particles of the oxide introduced in the state of powder into contact with the resin held in solution , and that an excess of silver is to be expected in a salt prepared by such a process .
2 .
When an alcoholic solution of the resin is poured into a similar solution of nitrate of silver , no precipitate falls ; but if the mixture be allowed to stand for some time , the inside of the glass vessel becomes covered with a coating of metallic silver , and a small quantity of a black powder gradually falls to the bottom .
The same effect follows if the resin of dragon 's blood be used , and in a still morle marked manner with the pure resin of guaiacum .
If ammonia be added , a yellow precipitate falls , which is speedily discoloured by the air , and ultimately becomes dark.green .
Carefully dried , 6'94 grains left 1-00 grain of silver = 15'475 per cent. of oxide of silver .
7'766 grains left 1'146 grains of silver = 15'848 per cent. of oxide of silver .
2S8 These results indicate the formation , as was the case with mastic resin A* , of a Iisalt , containing also , like the salt of that resin , a small excess of silver .
The formula Ag O+2 ( C40 H3 O ) requires 14'90 per cent. of oxide of silver .
3 .
Into an aqueous solution of ammonia nitrate of silver , an ammoniacal solution of gambodic acid was slowly poured with agitation , a yellow precipitate began to fall , which re-dissolved on a fulther addition of the resin , and was again thrown down on adding ammoniacal nitrate of silver .
The yellow precipitate gradually collected into brown flocks , and fo-rmed a brown coherent sediment , leaving the supernatant liquid of a pale yellow colour .
The lprcipitate was well wasled with distilled water , collected on the filteil , and d(ricld at 250 ?
FAIAn .
, till at that temnperature it ceasedt to soften .
13*17 grains blurned in the air left 1P17 of metallic silveir , or 9.54 per cent. of oxide .
7*866 grains left 0-725 of silver = 9'90 pet cent. of oxide .
A salt consisting of three equivalents of acid to one of base , or Ag 0+3 ( C40 H23 08 ) , contains 10*22 of oxide of silver .
We may safely consider the compound prepared by this mnetliod , therefore , as a tersalt , the excess of ammonia present probably retaining the silver in solution , so as to prevent its forming a more basic combination .
It is not unlikely that by varying the process a bisalt Ilight be obtained from aqueous solutions similar to that which was given by alcoholic solutions .
Constitution of the Salts of Gambodic Acid .
Of the salts above dlescribed( I have subljected to ultimate analysis only the bisalt of silver , obtaiined by mllixing the alcoholic soltions of the Lesinl and of nlitl'ate of silver , and ad(ling ammoniia .
This salt contained 15'8S pierc cent. of oxide of silver , and when biurned with oxide of copper , 8'.19 grains gave C= 18'02 , and II = 4'47 .
7-60 grains gave C= 16-875 , and I-I = 411 .
These results are equal to A. B. Calculated .
Carbon = 60'954 -=61-40 61'51 I-ydrogen = 6065 = 6'00 5'77 Oxygein = 17'098 _ 16-72 17-82 Oxide of silveIr = 15-883 15'88 14)90 ) 1 ( )00 10 ) 10( ) The numbers in the third colunmn are calculated accotrding to the formula Ag 0+2 ( C40 I-I .
0 ) , and to these numlbers the experimentlal results aplproximate very closely .
Like the simnilar analyses of the salts of imastic resin At , these show that in cornbining with oxides the gambodic acid does not part with the elements of water .
They are opposed , however , to the view suggested by the constitution of some of the salts of that resin , that the metal replaces an equal number of equivalents of hydrogen when it combines with the resin ; and they support rather the other view , which would represent the normal state of the acid resin to be that in which it exists when in a state of combination , and that the hydrogen contained in their salts of the metallic oxides is the true quantity which enters into the composition of these bodies .
Conclusions.-From the preceding investigation it appears , 1 .
That the most probable formula for gamboge resin is C40 HI23 O8 , though all the specimens analysed yield too little carbon by nearly one per cent. This deficiency is supposed to be due to a change produced during the preparation of the natural resin for the market .
2 .
When heated to about 400 ?
FAHR. it undergoes partial decomposition , a resin soluble in cold alcohol being formed , and another insoluble in that liquid .
The constitution of the latter seems to be represented by C40 H22 09 .
3 .
It forms with the nietallic oxides numerous classes of salts , the existence and constitution of which the preceding experiments must be considered as only rendering probable .
A complete study of the resinous salts , and of the circumstances under which the several classes of them are necessarily formed , though it would involve much labour , would probably lead to interesting results .
The various saline compounds obtained as above described may be classed as follows , representing the forr mula C40 H23 0 ?

I cannot persuade myself to regard this formidable list of salts without suspicion , especially as several of them have been formed only once .
In detailing my results and observations , however , I have in some measure cleared the way for future inquirers .
290 Resin of Guaiacum .
When the resin of guaiacum of the shops is treated with alcohol in the cold it is nearly all dissolved , giving a dark-brown solution .
On evaporating this solution in a flat dish , and heating it for twelve hours at a temperature rising from 1800 to about .
2500 FAHR. , a very beautiful transparent ruby-coloured resin is obtained , brittle and electric , melting at 212 ?
FAHR. , and emitting an agreeable fragrant odour .
Of this resin thus carefully dried , A. 10'647 grs. gave C= 27'167 and H1 = 6-585 B. 10'995 grs. gave C= 27-975 and H= 6*733 these results gave per cent. A. B. Carbon .

= 305'75 = 70'37 23 Hydrogen 28'70 = 660 10 Oxygen .
= 10000 23'02 434*45 100 This resin in a natural arrangement , therefore , must stand in the same group with the resins of dragon 's blood and of gamboge , which as we have already seen may be represented by Resin of dragon 's blood C40 H21 8O Resin of gamboge ... C40 H23 O Resin of guaiacum. .
C40 H23 010 Salts of Guaiacum Resin.-When the solution of this resin in alcohol is added to an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead in excess , a white precipitate falls , which becomes blue on exposure to the sun 's rays* .
After separating the precipitate , ammonia throws down a further portion from the supernatant liquid .
I have analysed three successive portions of the first of these compounds , which contains two equivalents of oxide of lead to forty of ecarbon but the results are so little l concordant wit the analysis of the uncombined resin as to render further investigation necessary .
With nitrate of silver this resin gives no precipitate , but on standing exposed to the light , the silver , in considerable quantity , is thrown down in the metallic state .
I have not examined what change of composition the resin undergoes during this deoxidation of the metal .
Acaroid Resin .
( Botany Bay Resin , Yellow Gum .
) This resin exuldes from the Xanthorrhcea hastilis , is of a darker reddish yellow colour than gamboge , comes to this country generally mixed with the spines and bark of the tree , gives in alcohol and ether a much darker solution than gamnboge , and a darker resin when evaporated .
It emits also a peculiar fragrant odour when melted , and differs further from gamboge in being almost entirely precipitated by water from its solution in alcohol , even when much ammonia has been added .
Dried in a thin film at 2500 FAHR. for twelve hours , A. 11-655 grs. gave C= 28'523 and H= 6'036 B. 11 61 grs. gave I= 6-048 and of another portion similarly heated C. 10236 grs. gave C= 25'204 and H= 5'258 A. B. C. Carbon .

This resin , therefore , belongs also to the group represented by the general expression C40 HI24 , Oy , and it contains more oxygen than any other resinous substance hitherto analysed .
General Remark .
In so far as we are entitled to draw general conclusions from the analyses contained in this and the preceding paper , it appears , 1 .
That many of the resins may be represented by formulae exhibiting their elementary constitution , and the weight of their equivalents in which 40 C is a constant quantity .
2 .
That there appear to be groups in which the equivalents both of the carbon and the hydrogen are constant , the oxygen only varying , and others in which the hydrogen alone varies , the two other elements being constant .
In a subsequent paper I hope to extend further these first generalizations .
