] On the 9th of July 1801 , this frigate sailed from Sheerness harbour with a strong favourable wind .
In about thirty minutes she went downbythehead , and in less than four minutes more she sunk entirely , twenty-two of the crew having perished by the fatal accident , -which is ascribed to the hawse-holes being extremely large , low , and carelessly left open ; so that by the crowd of sail the ship bore , they were pressed under water , by which means she filled imperceptibly , and sunk before any preventive means could be applied .
In order to raise her , Mr. Whidbey had recourse to another Dutch vessel of 1063 tons burden , and four lighters of 100 tons each .
In what manner he slung the frigate through the ports , and across the decks , and by proper purchases and other expedients first overcame the powerful effect of cohesion at the bottom , and then having floated her brought her safe into harbour , and completely recovered her , can only be clearly understood by perusing the paper , and at the same time inspecting the drawing which accompanies it .
Mr. Whidbey , at the end of his paper , acknowledges that he does not apprehend that there is anything new in the mode he has adopted in weighing this frigate , unless it be the expedient he had recourse to in order to remove the effect of cohesion : and he declares his opinion , that if a similar principle had been applied in the attempt made to weigh the Royal George , it would most probably have succeeded .
