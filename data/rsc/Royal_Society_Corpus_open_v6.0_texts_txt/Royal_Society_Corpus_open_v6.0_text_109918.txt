] The author , at the commencement of this paper , refers to the 12th volume of the Asiatic Researches , in which there are detailed accounts of two complete sections of an arc on the meridian , measured by him in prosecuting the Trigonometrical Survey of the Peiinsula of India .
The first is comprehended between the parallels of Punne , a station near Cape Comorin , in latitude 80 9 ' 38'"39 , and Patchipolliam in Coimbetoor , in latitude 100 59t 48'"f93 .
The second is comprehended between the parallels of Patchipolliam and Namthabad , a station near Gooty in the ceded districts , in latitude 15§ 6 ' 0"Since thoose imeasurements , the -author has obtained another section , extending from Namthabad to Daumergidda , in the Nizam 's dominions , which being in latitude 180 3 ' 23'"6 , gives a total arc of 90 531 45"-14 in amplitude .
From the first of these sections , Colonel Lambton finds the length of the degree due to latitude 90 34 ' 44 " ( the middle point of that arc ) , equal to 60472 83 fathoms .
The second section , whose middle point is in latitude 13§ 2 ' 55 " , gives the mean degree equal to 60487 56 fathoms ; and the last section gives the degree equal to 60512-78 fathoms due to the latitude of 16 34 ' 42 " , the middle point of that section .
The author proceeds to compare each of these degrees , first with the French measure , then with the English , and lastly , with the Swedish measure , and thence obtains a general mean for the compression at the poles .
The -first mean of these three degrees , used with the French degree , gives the compression -.OT ; the second mean of the same three degrees , used with the English degree , gives T-r- , ; and the third mean of these three degrees , used with the Swedish degree , gives --.T ; so that the mean of these three means will give the compression --.6 , or -g-3 nearly of the polar axis .
The number of base lines in this extensive arc are five , all measured with the chain extended in coffers , with elevating screws , &amp;c. The author , after giving a variety of data , proceeds to investigate the formulae which he has employed in his calculations , and concludes with a table of the lengths of different degrees for every third degree from the equator to the pole .
