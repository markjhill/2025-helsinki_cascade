General Theorems , chiefly Porisms , in the higher Geoa met ry .
By Henry Brougham , un .
Esq. conmunicated by Sir Charles Blagden , Knt. F.f R. S. Read May 24 , 1798 .
TrHn following are -a few propositions that have occurred to me , in the course of a considerable degree of attention which I have happened to bestov upon that interesting , though difficult branch of speculative mathematics , the higher geometry .
They are all in some degree connected ; the greater part refer to the conic hyperbola , as related to a variety of other curves .
Almost the whole are of that kind called porisms , whose nature and origin is now well kndwn ; and , if that mathematician to whom we owe the first distinct and popular account of this formerly mysterious , but most interesting subject , * should chance to peruse these pages , he will find in them additional proofs of the accuracy which characterizes his inquiry into the discovery of this singularly beautiful species of proposition .
Though each of the truths which I have here enunciated is of a very general and extensive nature , yet they are all discovered by the application of certain principles or properties still more general ; and are thus only cases of propositions still more extensive .
Into a detail of these , I cannot at present enter : they compose a system of general methods , by which the discovery of propositions is effected with certainty and ease ; and.* See Mr. PLAYFAIR'S Paper , in Vol. 111 .
of the Edinburgh Trans. they are , very probably , in the doctrine of curve lines , what the ancients appear to have prized so much in plain geometry ; although , unfortunately , all that remains to us of that treasure , is the knowledge of its high value .
Neither have I added the de !
.monstrations , which are all purely geometrical , granting the methods of tangents and quadratures : I have given an example , in the abridged synthesis , of what I consider as one of the most intricate .
It is unnecessary to apologize any farther for the concisenessof this tract .
Let it be remembered , that were each proposition followed by its analysis and composition , and the corollaries , scholia , limitations , and problems , immediately suggested by it , without any trouble on the reader 's part , the whole would form a large volume , in the style of the ancient geometers ; containing the investigation of a series of connected truths , in one branch of the mathematics , all arising from varying the combinations of certain data enumerated in a general enunciation.* As a collection of curious general truths , of a nature , so far as I know , hitherto quite unknown , I am persuaded this Paper , with all its defects , may not be unacceptable to those who feel pleasure in contemplating the varied and beautiful relations between abstract quantities , the wonderful and extensive analogies which every step of our progress in the higher parts of geometry opens to our view .

I. PORISM .
( Tab. XXI .
fig. 'i .
) A conic hyperbola being given , a point may be found , such , that every straight line drawn from it to the curve , shall cut , in a given ratio , that part of a straight line passing through a given point which is intercepted between a point in the curve not given , but which may be found , and the ordinate to the point where the first mentioned line meets the curve .
Let X be the point to be found , NA the line passing through Xthe given point N , and M any point whatever in the curve , join XM , and draw the ordilnate MP ; then AC is to CP in a given ratio .
Corollary .
This property suggests a very simple and accurate method of describing a conic hyperbola , and then finding its centre , asymptotes , and axes ; or , any of these being given , of finding the curve , and the remaining parts .

PORISM .
A conic hyperbola being given a point may be found , such , that if from it there be drawn straight lines to all the intersections of the given curve , with an infinite number of parabolas , or hyperbolas , of any given order whatever , lying between straight lines , of which one passes through a given point , and the other may be found , the straight lines so drawn , from the point found , shall be tangents to the parabolas , or hyperbolas .
This is in fact two propositions ; there being a constructionfor the case of parabolas , and another for that of hyperbolas .
PROP .

PORISM .
If , through .
any point whatever of a given ellipse , a straight line-be drawn parallel to the conjugate axis , and cutting the ellipse in another point ; and if at the first point a perpendicular be drawn to the parallel , a point may be found , such , that if from it there be drawn straight lines , to the innumerable intersections of the ellipse with all the parabolas oforders not given , but which may be found , lying between the lines drawn at right angles to each other , the lines so drawn from the point found , shall be normals to the parabolas at their intersections with the ellipse .

PORISM .
A conic hyperbola being given , if through any point -thereof a straightline be drawn parallel to the transverse axis , ( and cutting the opposite hyperbolas , ) a point may be found , such , that if from it there be drawn straight lines to the innumerable intersections of the given curve with all the hyperbolas of orders to be found , lying between straight lines which may be found , the straight lines so-drawn shall be normals to the hyyperbolas at the points of section .

The two last propositions give an instance of the many curious and elegant analogies between the hyperbola and ellipse ; failing , however , when -by equating the axes we change the ellipse into a circle .

V. LOCAL THEOREM .

If , from a given point A , a straight line DE moves parallel to itself , and another CS , from a given point C , moves , along with 'it round C ; and a point I moves along AB , from H , the middle point of AB , with at velocity equal to half the velocity of DE ; then , if AP be always -taken a third proportional to AS and BC , and through P , with asymptotes D'E ' and AB , a conic hyperbola be described ; also , focus I and axis AB , a conic parabola be described , the radius vector from C to M , the intersection of the two curves , moving round C , shall describe a given ellipse .
PROP .

THEOREM .
A common logarithmic being given , and a point without it , a parabola , hyperbola , and ellipse , may be described , which shall intersect the logarithmic and each other in the same points ; the parabola shall cut the logarithmic orthogonally ; and , if straight lines be drawn from the given point to the common intersections of the four curves , these lines shall be normals to the logarithmic .

PORISM .
Two points in a circle being given , ( but not in one diameter , ) another circle may be described , such , that if from any point thereof to the given points straight lines be drawn , and a line touching the given circle , the tangent shall be a mean proportional between the lines so inflected .
Or , more generally , the square of the tangent shall have a -given ratio to the rectangle under the inflected lines .

Two straight lines AB , AP , ( not parallel , ) being given in position , a conic parabola MN may be found , such , that if , from any point thereof M , a perpendicular MP be drawn to the one of the given lines nearest the curve , and this perpendicular be produced till it meets the other line in B , and if from Ba line be drawn to a given point C , MP shall have to PB together with CB , a given ratio .

This is a case of a most general enunciation , which gives rise to an infinite variety of the most curious porisms PROP .

Fig. 4 .
A conic hyperbola being given , a point may be found , from which if straight lines be drawn to the intersections of the given curve with innumerable parabolas ( or hyperbolas ) of any given order whatever , lying between perpendiculars which meet in a given point , the lines so drawn shall cut , in a given ratio , all the areas of the parabolas ( or hyperbolas ) contained by the peripheries and co-ordinates to points thereof , found by the in~numerable intersections of another conic hyperbola , which may be found .
This comprehends , evidently , two propositions ; one for the case of parabolas , the other for that of hyperbolas .
In the former it is thus expressed with a figure .
Let EM be the given hyperbola ; BA AC , the perpendiculars meeting in a given point A : a point X may be found , such that if XM be drawn toayintersection M of EM with y parabola AMN , of any given:'order whatever , and lying between AB and AC , XM shall cut , in a given ratio , the area AMNP , contained by AMN and AP , PN , co-ordinates to the conic hyperbola EN , which is to be fouid ; thus , the area ARM shall be to the area RMNP in a given ratio .

A conic hyperbola being given , a point may be found , such , that if from it there be drawn straight lines , to the innumerable -i-ntersections of the given curve with all the straight .
lines drawn thorough a ' given pointI in one of the given asymptotes , the first mentioned lines shall cut , in -a given ratio , the areas of all the triangles whose bases and altitudes are the co-ordinates to a second conic hyperbola , which may be found , at the points where it cuts the lines drawn from the given point .

PORISM .
A conic hyperbola being given , a straight line may be found , such , that if another move along it in a given angle , and pass through the intersections of the curve with all the parabolas , ( or hyperbolas , ) of any given order whatever , lying between straight lines to be found , the moving line shall cut , in a given ratio , the areas of the curves described , contained by the peripheries and co-ordinates to another conic hyperbola , that may be found , at the points where this cuts the curves described .

PORISM .
A conic hyperbola being given , a straight line may be found , along which if another move in a given angle , and pass through any point whatever-of the hyperbola , and if this point of section : be joined with another that may be found , the moving line shall cut , in a given ratio , the triangles whose bases and altitudes are the co-ordinates to a conic hyperbola , which may be found , at the points where it meets the lines drawn from the point found .

I proceed to give one or two examples , wherein areas are cut in a given ratio , not by straight lines , but by curves .

Fig. I. A conic hyperbola being given , if through any of its innumerable intersections with all the parabolas of any order , lying between straight lines , whereof one is an asymptote , and the other may be found , an hyperbola of any order be described , ( except the conic , ) from a given origin in the given asymptote perpendicular to the axis of the parabolas , the hyperbola thus described shall cut , in a given ratio ; an area ( of the parabolas ) which may be always found .
If from G ( as origin ) in AB , one of LM 's asymptotes , there be described an hyperbola IC ' , of any order whatever , except the first , .
and passing through M , a point where LM cuts any of the parabolas AM , of any order whatever , drawn from Aa point to be found , and lying between AB and AC , an area ACD may be always found , ( that is , for every case of AM and IC ' , ) which shall be constantly cut by IC ' , in the given ratio of M : N ; that is , the area AMN : NMDC : : M : N. I omit the analysis , which leads to the following construc.tion and composition .
Construction .
Let m+n be the order of the parabolas , and p+q that of the hyperbolas .
Find pa fourth proportional to m+ n , q --p and divide GB in A , so that ARE : AG:q : p+ A ; then find vr a fourth proportional to M+ N , q +p , and q p. and ya fourth proportional to q , AG , and q.-p ; and , lastly , 0a fourth proportional to the parameter* of LM , 7 and M. If , with a parameter equal to +mtn xM+N of the rectangle -r .
AN , and between the asymptotes AB , AC , a conic hyperbola be described , it shall cut the parabola in a point , the co-ordinates to which contain an area that shall be cut by IC ' in the ratio of M : N. Demonstration .
Because AG is divided in R , so that ARE : AG :q:p + , and that:m + n : : q-p : m+2 n , ARE is equal to AG x q_ and , because LM is a conic hyperbola , the pm+ XqP m+2n rectangle MS .
RS , or MS .
AP , or AP MP .
+ ARE is equal to the parameter , ( or constant space , ) therefore , this parameter is equal to AP x MP + AG .
qp+ ( m + n ) ( q _p ) m+2n Again , the space ACD is equal to m + ?
, of the rectangle rn +zn AC .
CD , since AD is a parabola of the order m+ n ; but ( by construction ) AC .
CD is equal to o of O 1+ ANN M+N ~ ~~ therefore , ACD =0M+ N. .
AN , of which 0 : parameter M of LM : : ir : M , and ir : M+ N : : + +p : q -p ; therefore , Lt_ Par. LM xM+Nm+nx q-p.also AG ' M ( qp ) m+2nq _p ; consequently , ACD = ParLM ? ? ?
?iN multiplied by q ~~~~~~~~~~~~M ( q ... p ) m+n xq-P p and diminished by M ANx Par. LM XM+Nm+n q_p\ therefore , transposing PrL x M(+xn 4p sMx qP m zn I equal to ACD XAN xQ and Par. LM will be ( ACD+ MNXAN xqp xequal to - ) that is , ( m+n )L : ?
+ , qxiFjK iM +2 n/ MX qp x ACD + q. AN x AG +_-_x q-P P mn +z n Now , it was before demonstrated , that the parameter of LM is equal to AP x MP + q. AG p+ ( m +2n)(q _ ) This is therefore M +x Npx ACD + q.AN x AG equal to _ _ , multiplying both by +nX i+ n+tn P+pwehaeM+ N_ I q-pxACD+q.ANxAG =APx ( MP x ( p + m+n xq-P ) + q.AG ) .
From these equals take q. AG x AN , and there remains M +Nx qX -px ACD equal to AP x PM x(m +P ) +q AG x AP-AN ; or , dividing by q-p ; M -N XACD ~~AP x+ +t PM =APx r+n q-xPM+q+xAGxAP-AN .
Now , M+ T. x AP x PM is equal to the area APM ; therefore , the area APMtogetherwith x AP .
PM , and qx AG x AP AN , or APM with x AP .
PMp x AG x AN-AP , or APM +jx AP .
PM .
X rect .
PT is equal to xACD .
Now , IC'is an hyperbola of the orderpb q ; therefore , its area is Px rect .
GHi .
MH .
But q is greater thanp ; therefore , P~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ P.is negative , and 'x ( dH .
HM is the area MHKC ' ; and the is neatve q-p area NTKC ' is equal to .
Px GT x TN ; therefore , MNTH is equal to ( MHKC'NTKC ' ) , or to x GH .
MH GTN .
From these equals take the common rectangle AT , and there remains the area MPN , equal to x AP x MP x PT ; which was before demonstrated to be , together with APM , M equal to l ACD .
Wherefore MPN , together with APM , M that is , the area AMN is equal to M ACD ; consequently , AMN : ACD : : M : M+ N ; and ( dividends ) AMN : NMDC M : N. An area has therefore been found , which the : hyperbola IC ' always cuts in a given ratio .
Wherefore , a conic hyperbola being given , &amp;c. Q. E. D. Scholium .
This proposition points out , in a very striking manner , the connection between all parabolas and hyperbolas , and their common connection with the conic hyperbola .
The demonstration which I have given is much abridged ; and , to avoid circumlocution , algebraic symbols , and even ideas , have been introduced : but , by attending to the several steps , any one will easily perceive that it may be translated into geometrical language , and conducted upon purely geometrical principles , if any numbers be substituted for m , n , p , and q ; or if these letters be made representatives of lines , and if conciseness be less rigidly studied .

'THEOREM .
A common logarithmic being given , if from a given point , as origin , a parabola ( or hyperbola ) of any order whatever be described , cutting , in a given ratio , a given area of the logarithmic } the point where this curve meets the logarithmic is always situated in a conic hyperbola , which may be found .
Scbolium .
This proposition is , properly speaking , neither a porism , a theorem , nor a problem .
It is not a theorem , because something is left to be found , or , as PAPPUS expresses it , there is a deficiency in the hypothesis : neither is it a porism ; for the theorem , from which the deficiency distinguishes it , is not local .

A parabola of any order ( m + n ) being given , another of an order ( m 42 n ) may be found , such , that the rectangle under its ordinate and a given line , shall have always a given ratio to the area ( of the given curve ) whose abscissa bears to that of the curve found a given ratio .
Example .
Let mI 1 , n= 1 , and let the given ratios be those of equality ; the proposition is this ; a conic parabola being given , a semicubic one may be found , such , that the rectangle under its ordinate and a given line , shall be always equal to the area of the given conic parabola , at equal abscissae .
Scbolium .
A similar general proposition may be enunciated and exemplified , with respect to hyperbolas ; and , as these are only cases of a proposition applying to all curves whatsoever , I shall take this opportunity of introducing a very simple , and , I think , perfectly conclusive demonstration , of the 28th lemma , Princzjpia , Book I. ' , that no oval can be squared .
It is well known that the demonstration which Sir ISAAC NEWTON gives of this lemmna , is not a little intricate and , whether from this difli-culty , or from some real imperfection , or from a very natural wish not to believe that the most celebrated desideratum in geometry must for ever remain a desideratum , certain it is , that many have been inclined to call in question the conclusiveness of that proof .
Let AMC be any curve whatever , ( fig. 8 .
) and Da given line take in aba part ap , having to AP a given ratio , and erect a perpendicular p m , such , that the rectangle p m. D shall have to the area APM a given ratio ; it is evident that m will describe a curve amc , which can never cut the axis , unless in a. Now , becausep m is proportional to APM , or to APM , pm will always increase , ad in finitum , if AMC is infinite ; but , if AMC stops or returns into itself , that is , if it is an oval , pm is a maximum at b , the point of ab corresponding to B in AB ; consequently , the curve amc stops short , and is irrational .
Therefore pm , its ordinate , has not a finite relation to ap , its abscissa ; But ap has a given ratio to AP ; therefore pm has not a finite relation to AP , and APM has a given ratio to p m ; therefore it has not a finite relation to AP , that is , APM cannot he found in finite terms of AP , or is incommensurate with AP ; wherefore , the curve AMB cannot be squared .
Now , AMB is any oval ; wherefore no oval can be squared .
By an argument of precisely the same kind , it may proved , that the rectification , also , of every oval is impossible .
Wherefore , &amp;c. Q. E. D. I shall subjoin three problems , that occurred during the consideration of the foregoing propositions .
The first is an example of the application of the porisms to the solution of problems .
The second gives , besides , a new method of resolving one of the most celebrated ever proposed , KEPLER'S problem ; and the last presents to our view a curve before unknown , ( at least to me , ) as possessing the singular property of a constant tangent .

Q. K D. Of this solution it may be remarked , that it does not assume as a postulate the description of the cycloid , but givesa simple , construction of that curve , flowing from a curious property , whereby it is related to a given circle .
This cycloid too gives , by its intersection with the ellipse , the point required , directly , and not by a subsequent construction , as Sir I. NEWTON'S does .
I was induced to give the demonstration , from a conviction that it is a good instance of the superiority of modern over ancient analysis ; and in itself , perhaps , no inelegant specimen of algebraic demonstration. .

In order to draw a tangent to it , from a given point without it ; from this point as pole , with radius equal to d , and the curve 's axis as directrix , describe a conchoid of Nicomedes : to its intersections with the given curve draw straight lines from the given point ; these will touch the curve .

This curve may be described ( organically ) by drawing one end of a given flexible line or thread along a straight line , whilst the other end is urged by a weight towards the same straight line .
It is , consequently , the curve of traction to a straight line .
