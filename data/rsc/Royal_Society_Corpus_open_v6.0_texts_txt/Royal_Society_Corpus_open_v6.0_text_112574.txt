I. " Sixth Memoir on Radiation and Absorption .
" By Prof. J. TYNDALL , F.R.S. Received December 21 , 1865 .
( Abstract .
) In this paper the author considers the deportment of certain additional elementary bodies towards Radiant Heat .
He exposes powders and liquids of the same physical character , but differing from each other chemically , at a focus of dark rays , and describes the different effects produced .
He examines and explains the experiments of Franklin on the absorption of solar heat .
He then determines the radiative power of a great number of substances in the state of fine powder , and finds , contrary to the current belief , that in this state also chemical constitution exercises a paramount influence .
The results obtained by previous experimenters in connexion with this subject are illustrated and explained .
The reciprocity of radiation and absorption on the part of fine powders is also illustrated .
It is moreover shown that the heat emitted from different sources , at a temperature of 100 ?
C. , varies in quality , this being proved by its unequal transmission through plates of rock-salt of perfect purity .
The absorption by such plates varies from 4 to 30 per cent. of the incident radiation .
