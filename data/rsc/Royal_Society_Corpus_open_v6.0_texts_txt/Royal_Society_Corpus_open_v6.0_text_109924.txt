] The anomalies in magnetic observations on ship-board were usually attributed to imperfectiols of the azimuth compass , till Capt. Flinders suggested the influence of the iron used in the construction of the ship as their probable source , -a suggestion since confirmed and illustrated by Mr. Bain .
In this paper , Mr. Scoresby has given a table of the selected results of his observations relating to this subject , conducted on the coast of Spitzbergen , in the years 1815 and 1817 .
To these he has added some general inferences , deduced at the time of observation , and observes , that the anomaly of attraction is probably the greatest in men-of-war , and ships containing large quantities of iron , though it also exists to a considerable extent in merchantmen where iron forms no part of the cargo , especially in high latitudes where the dip of the needle is great .
