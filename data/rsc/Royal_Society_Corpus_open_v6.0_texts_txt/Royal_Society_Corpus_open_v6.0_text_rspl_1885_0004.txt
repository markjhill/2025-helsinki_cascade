On the Law of the Distribution of Energy among the Molecules .
" By J. J. Thomson , M.A. , F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics in the University of Cambridge .
Received June 4 , 1885 .
In any kinetic theory of gases the statistical method of investigation must be used , and since the separate molecules of the gas are supposed to possess some properties to very different extents , it is necessary to know how many molecules there are which have the measure of any given property between certain limits .
Thus the question of the distribution of configuration and velocity amongst the molecules is one of the most important problems in any theory of gases .
, .
This problem has been solved for the ordinary solid particle theory by Maxwell and Boltzmann , and their researches are the more valuable as the results do not depend on any assumption about the law of force between the molecules .
In this paper I shall attempt to solve the same problem for the vortex atom theory of gases .
In this case the question is a little more complicated , as the radii of the vortex rings can vary as well as their velocities .
This is one of the most striking differences between the two theories ; according to the ordinary theory all the molecules of a gas are of the same size , according to the vortex atom theory the molecules of the same gas vary in size .
If this be true , a porous plate of the requisite degree of fineness might play in this theory the part which Maxwell 's demons play in the ordinary theory .
For let us suppose that we have two chambers , A and B , separated by a porous plate , and that A is filled with gas initially while B is empty , then if the pores in the porous plate are so fine that only the smaller molecules can get through from A to B , then , though some of the molecules will recross the plate , some gas will remain in B , and the
