" The Application of the Kinetic Theory of Gases to the Electric , Magnetic , and Optical Properties of Diatomic Gases .
" By George W. Walker , B.A. Communicated by Professor Pucker , Sec. R.S. Received January 23 , \#151 ; Read February 14 , 1901 .
( Extended Abstract.\#151 ; Received January 6 , 1902 .
) In this paper I have endeavoured to examine the most important magnetic , electric , and optical properties of a gas , supposed to consist primarily of two-atom molecules .
A two-atom molecule , in which the atoms are of unequal mass and carry equal and opposite electrical charges , was selected not as an actual representation of the molecule , but as typical of the characteristic features .
I have adopted Boltzmann 's distribution law , and , as far as I can judge , have not applied it beyond the limits to which it appears to be justified experimentally .
We have first to observe that the molecules may be divided into three classes , which I have called A , B , and C. Theory of Gases to the Properties of Diatomic Gases .
395 In A the two atoms revolve in continuous contact under their mutual electric attraction ; in B and C they are separated by the centrifugal tendency .
In B the two atoms are describing elliptic orbits about their common centre of inertia , while in C they describe hyperbolic or parabolic orbits .
In the set C the atoms may thus be regarded as practically free .
We may also contemplate the possibility of multiple molecules .
The individuals of the three fundamental sets may change from time to time ; but we may suppose that a permanent average distribution will finally obtain .
The proportions of molecules in the three classes must be determined by the consideration that the velocities satisfy the conditions appropriate to the specified class .
There is no discontinuity in the case of B and C , and the limits of integration for these have been determined .
I have not obtained a satisfactory estimate of the proportion of A to B , as a sort of discontinuity occurs .
Inasmuch as the electrical energy of the two atoms when close together is very great compared with the mean kinetic energy at ordinary temperatures , the molecules are maixdy of the class A. It has thus been established that a small proportion of molecules are always dissociated , a point which has recently been established experimentally .
I also find that although on the whole the numbers of B and C together diminish as the pressure decreases , yet the proportion of C to B increases as the pressure decreases .
This would account for the increased ease with which electrical discharge takes place through a gas under reduced pressure .
Passing next to the magnetic properties it is shown from a former paper* that diamagnetic effects are produced by the free atoms on establishing a magnetic field , and that the effect disappears very soon .
It is also shown that the molecules contribute positive magnetic susceptibility ; and the formula obtained , which is complicated , agrees well with Quincke 's experiments on the subject .
Turning to the dielectric constant , it is found that K = 1 + kpj6\ where p is the pressure , 0 the absolute temperature , and is a constant depending on the gas .
This differs essentially from other theories which have been proposed , as regards the temperature variation , the usual result being K = 1 We may see without analysis how this arises .
The electrical field is capable of affecting the rotational energy of the molecule , and thus the * " On the Phillips Phenomenon , " ' Electrician , ' August , 1899 .
396 Mr. G. W. Walker .
The Application of Kinetic control depends on the temperature ; whereas in all former theories the control is supposed to he independent of temperature .
The calculation of K applies to two-atom molecules , but it is clear that a similar result will hold for a more complicated molecule , provided that the energy of those co-ordinates , which are affected by an electrical field , can be affected by the communication of heat .
I have next considered the optical effects .
The free atoms are first considered , and the method used is due to Lord Rayleigh , viz. , calculating the effect of the Avaves on the particles , and then the modification of the waves , which these disturbed particles produce .
The motion of a free atom under the influence of plane waves can be completely determined , and the results are as follows : Each atom moves in a complicated manner , but as a first approximation the motion may be regarded as made up of a linear motion and a periodic motion .
For any individual atom this periodic motion is not parallel to the plane of the waves , nor is it strictly of the same period as the incident waves ; but on integration for the whole set , the component normal to the plane of the waves vanishes , and only the component in the plane of the waves remains .
The free atoms accelerate the velocity of propagation by a term proportional to the square of the wave-length , and hence the refractive index is diminished by the same term .
This is identical with the term introduced by Ketteler in Cauchy 's formula to explain the observed facts in cases of abnormal not anomalous dispersion .
The atoms scatter the light , and consequently the intensity of the transmitted light is diminished , but the effect is independent of the wave-length .
^ ... With respect to the molecules , it is found that a neAV distribution law obtains , the change being of such a nature that there is a periodic orientation of the axes of the molecules and a periodic surging of the centres of inertia of the molecules in the plane of the waves .
Both effects contribute to the refractive index , but the former is of far o-reater importance than the second .
The final result , Avhich involves a function of considerable complexity , is shown to he capable of explaining ordinary or anomalous dispersion .
The formulae for K and y , which agree in giving K = are considered in their bearing on the supposed additive law .
They woukl not give a strictly additive law , but the divergence would not be great if the properties of the constituents Avere not widely different , if ei , VOTee Avith an additive law as well as experiment warrants .
^The coefficient of rotation of the plane of polarisation in a magnetic field is obtained , and is found to vanish if the masses of the positn e and negative atoms are equal .
Combined with the formula for refractive index an estimate of o\gt ; for oxygen is obtained , o\gt ; being call angular velocity of rotation of mean square , from ana ogy ordinary velocity of mean square .
Theory of Gases to the Properties of Diatomic Gases .
397 I may now quote from the paper my conclusions :* " It is interesting to note that w [ here ] plays the part of a control in refraction , and that the form of the dispersion curve is really due to the distribution law and not to radiation .
The value of w/ 2ir obtained must be about three times the frequency for the Na lines and hence to corresponds to a frequency far beyond the violet .
I see no grave objection to this result , as the same result would arise in any theory in which a single term is supposed to represent the facts .
The controlling period must be less than the imposed period to explain ordinary dispersion in the spectral range .
" The high value of to precludes the possibility of explaining spectral lines by the molecules of this theory .
I am inclined to think that spectral lines are in some way connected with dissociation , but not necessarily of simple molecules .
" 1 return to a suggestion which I made earlier , that these are due to multiple molecules .
We cannot avoid the conclusion that there are such in a gas .
They need not , and indeed do not , have a permanent existence .
It is only necessary that there should be a small proportion on average .
The frequencies of these small planetary systems are probably less than the frequency of the molecule par excellence .
h urther it is probable that their frequency will not be greatly affected by pressure , but the number would probably increase with pressure .
This would agree with Professor Sir Norman Lockyer 's observations that the period of the lines does not alter much with pressure , but the intensity does increase considerably with increase of pressure .
" Earlier in the paper I point out the importance of multiple molecules in connection with the theory of the ratio of specific heats .
The ratio of specific heats for chlorine indicates more nearly six degrees of freedom , and one must either suppose that there is a considerable proportion of the set B present , or else a proportion of multiple molecules .
The first supposition could hardly be supported quantitatively on electrical grounds ; while the second is more probable in view of the comparative proximity of chlorine , under ordinary conditions , to its critical state .
