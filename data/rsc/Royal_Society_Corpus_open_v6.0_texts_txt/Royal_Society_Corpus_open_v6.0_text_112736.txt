( Abstract .
) The author states that the advantages possessed by Mr. Heppel 's method will probably cause it to be used both in practice and in scientific study .
With a view to the instruction of students in engineering science , he proposes an abridged way of stating the theoretical principles of Mr. Heppel 's method , considering at the same time that Mr. Heppel 's more detailed investigation forms the best model for numerical calculation .
He then uses Mr. Heppel 's improved form of the " Theorem of the three Moments " to test the accuracy of the formulae which he obtained in another way , and published in 'A Manual of Civil Engineering , ' for the case of a uniform continuous beam with an indefinite number of equal spans , the successive spans being loaded alternately with a uniform fixed load only , and with a uniform travelling load in addition to the fixed load ; and he finds the results of the two methods to agree in every respect .
