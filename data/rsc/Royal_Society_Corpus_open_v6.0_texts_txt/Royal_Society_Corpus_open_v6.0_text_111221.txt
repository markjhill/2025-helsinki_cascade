LORD WROTTESLEY , V.P. , in the Chair .
The following letter , addressed to Michael Faraday , Esq. , and by him communicated to the Society , was read : Dunse ( N. Britain ) , March 1 , 1853 .
DEEAR SIR , In the report in the Athenaeum of your lecture at the Royal Institution on the 21st of January , I observe that you refer to the highly interesting observations of Schwabe , Sabine , Wolf , Gautier , &amp;c. , from which it would appear that a connection exists between the solar spots and the variations of the terrestrial magnetic forces .
Since a connection has been demonstrated to exist between the latter and auroral phenomena , I was induced to look over my notes relating to the auroroe observed at this place , with a view to ascertain whether these also exhibited maxima and minima , and if so , whether the periods'of such agreed with those of the solar spots and of the magnetic variations .
The subjoined table shows the distribution of the aurore seen here in the years 1838 to 1847 inclusiveJan .
