( Abstract .
) In the former paper , the author had supposed that by taking a vessel of very large horizontal section he should be able to eliminate the sensible effects of conduction of heat downwards by the sides of the vessel .
However , considering the important part which the sides might conceivably play , and the statements in books and published writings that the conduction of heat downwards in liquids in the experiments of Despretz and others , was wholly , or almost wholly , due to conduction by the sides of the containing vessel , it was thought advisable to put the matter to a direct test .
A screen of thick cotton material was accordingly placed inside the cylindrical vessel used in the experiment .
The screen extended all round , at a little distance from the side , and reached from top to bottom , and accordingly would arrest currents of convection arising from heat conducted down the side , if such were sensible .
Experiments made in March and April , 1880 , gave for the conductivity of heat by water , in square centims. per second , a mean of 000134 without the screen , and 000154 with the screen .
These numbers , though not in complete agreement , are yet quite of the same order .
They indicate that no important error is to be feared as the result of conduction down the walls of the bath .
Indeed , the apparent conducting power of water comes out a little greater with the screen than without .
