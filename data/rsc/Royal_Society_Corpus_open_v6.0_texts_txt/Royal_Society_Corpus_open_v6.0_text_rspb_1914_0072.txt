248 Further Observations on the Changes in the Breathing and the Blood at Various High .
By Mabel Purefoy FitzGerald .
( Communicated by J. S. Haldane , F.R.S. Received June 2 , \#151 ; Read June 25,1914 .
) In a previous investigation carried out in connection with the Anglo-American Pike 's Peak Expedition ( 1911 ) , the changes in the breathing and the blood at high altitudes were recorded at atmospheric pressures ranging from 625 to 458 mm. of mercury .
Lack of time prevented further observations being made , and in the graphic representation of the gases of the alveolar air and of the percentage of haemoglobin in the blood ' subsequently published , * the supposed values for atmospheric pressures ranging from 625 to 760 mm. of mercury were indicated by a broken line .
To complete the records , experiments were made by me in North Carolina , U.S.A. , during the months of July , August , and September of 1913 .
Three localities were chosen in the Southern Appalachian chain , approximately between 35 ' and 35 ' 6 ' N. latitude , and 82 ' 5 ' and 83 ' 25 ' W. longitude : Highlands ( altitude 3850 feet ) , the highest village east of the Rocky Mountains , situated in the Blue Ridge Mountains ; Waynesville ( altitude 2645 feet ) in the Balsam Mountains , and Asheville ( altitude 2210 feet ) situated in the valley of the French Broad River , with the Blue Ridge Mountains lying to the south and east , and the foot-hills of the Unaka Mountains to the west and north .
Experiments were made with 43 residents .
Care was again taken to exclude the unhealthy , and those who , on account of recent change of abode , might be unacclimatised .
Observations were also made on myself at each locality visited .
The research is based upon 206 C03 determinations and 52 hsemoglobin percentage determinations .
The subjects were adult men and women , of from 18 to 70 years of age .
The number of subjects corresponding to each decade , or part thereof , were as follows :\#151 ; Age .

Changes in Breathing and Blood at High Altitudes .
249 In the majority of cases , the subjects were natives of the respective localities .
With the exception of two subjects , one of whom had been at sea-level three weeks prior to the experiment , and the other , one month before , at an altitude of about 1000 feet , no subject had left the place at which he or she was living for a considerable time .
The methods of determining the alveolar CO2 percentage , and of calculating the alveolar C02 and 02 pressures , were the same as in the previous investigation .
A carefully standardised Gowers-Haldane luemoglobinometer was used for determining the haemoglobin percentage , and pure CO was used for saturating the blood solution .
At Asheville and New York the readings for the barometric pressure were obtained from the local offices of the United States Weather Bureau ; at Highlands and Waynesville readings were taken from an aneroid barometer compensated for temperature and checked by comparison with the readings of the Weather Bureau .
The altitude records were taken from the bench marks of the United States Geological Survey , with the exception of that for Highlands , in which case the elevation recorded ( 3850 feet ) is for the Highlands Camp Sanatorium , where the experiments were made , and not for the village proper .
The mean values for the haemoglobin percentage , the alveolar C02 percentage and pressure , and the calculated alveolar oxygen values for men , at altitudes varying from 658 to 711 mm. of mercury are given in Table I , and similar values for women in Table II .
Normal mean values for near sea-level ( Oxford ) are included for comparison in each table .
The results obtained in the present and the former investigation are indicated graphically in Charts I and II .
It will be seen that taken in conjunction with the barometric pressure the values for the alveolar C02 and 02 pressures decrease progressively with the increase of altitude .
Since the C02 values , with the exception of those for Waynesville , correspond closely with the supposed values indicated by the graph in the preceding paper* additional support is given to the statement then made , that the lowering of the C02 pressure is in direct proportion to the diminution of the barometric pressure and amounts to about 4'2 mm. or 10*5 per cent , of the sea-level value for each 100 mm. of diminution of barometric pressure .
There is a corresponding progressive fall in the oxygen pressure of about 16 mm. , or 16 per cent , of the sea-level value for each 100 mm. fall in the barometric pressure .
In each of the two charts a curve is also plotted , as in the former paper , * Ibid. , Chart 1 .

Further Observations on the seven atmospheres in the case of Greenwood .
With long exposures , however , the result may well be different .
The percentage of haemoglobin in the blood in men increased progressively with the fall in barometric pressure .
The mean percentage values correspond closely w'ith the supposed values at similar pressures indicated in Chart III of the previous paper* and support the statement there madef that " for every 100 mm. fall of atmospheric pressure , there is an average rise of about 10 per cent , in the haemoglobin .
" Similar , but less regular , increase occurred in the percentage of haemoglobin in the blood of women .
An unusually low value ( 9C8 per cent. ) was recorded at Highlands .
Insufficient data together with varying physiological condition may account for the irregularity in the records for women .
At each locality greater uniformity in the individual determinations was met with than in the previous investigation at the higher altitudes .
At Waynesville and Asheville , in four of the five men subjects aged between 52 and 64 years , the haemoglobin percentage was less than 100 , which possibly indicates that the compensatory increase of haemoglobin in the blood wanes with age at the less high altitudes .
With regard to the influence of age on the fall in the alveolar C02 pressure , the tendency previously noticed \for the fall to be less in those under 30 than at later age periods was again observed .
Only one subject complained of the ill-effects of living at high altitudes ( 3850 feet ) .
A marked difference wras observed in the degree of " nervousness " in the subjects , this being much less than in residents at altitudes of 5000 feet and over .
Observations were made upon myself at each locality ( see Table III ) ; 24 hours were allowed to elapse before the alveolar C02 determinations were made .
My mean normal alveolar C02 pressure at Oxford and at New York is 34 mm. of mercury ( barometric pressures respectively 753 and 759 mm. of mercury ) .
The journey of about 33 hours to Highlands ( altitude 3850 feet ) was made direct from New York , where the previous nine months had been spent .
At Highlands , a stay of over eight weeks was made .
During the last two and a half weeks I slept at a point about 400 feet higher than the sanatorium , where work was conducted during the day , and through the eighth week was more or less stationary at the higher altitude ( 4250 feet ) .
Contrary to the former experience at altitudes of 5000 feet and higher , the alveolar C02 pressure did not fall , but remained , with slight variations , at the normal value for sea-level ( 34 mm. of mercury ; .

255 256 Miss M. P. FitzGerald .
Further Observations on the oxygen pressure was lower than it otherwise would have been .
In general I was not conscious of being at a higher altitude than usual , but signs of being at a physiological disadvantage , due to the low alveolar oxygen pressure , were manifested by the constant feeling of great fatigue and , except during the stay at 4250 feet , when work was in part lessened , by poor and unrefreshing sleep.* From Highlands the journey was made via Lake Toxaway ( seven hours ' drive and thence by rail ) to Waynesville ( altitude 2645 feet ) , one night being spent on the way at Asheville ( altitude 2210 feet ) .
Four days were spent at Waynesville ( 2645 feet ) .
Stormy weather prevailed .
The mean alveolar CO* pressure was found to be 34'6 mm. of mercury with a barometric pressure of 689 mm. of mercury ( corrected barometric pressure 694 mm. C02 pressure 34*9 mm. of mercury ) .
At Asheville ( altitude 2210 feet ) , where a week was spent after leaving Waynesville , the mean C02 pressure in the alveolar air was found also to be within the variation of normal sea-level values , i.e.34'4 mm. of mercury ( barometric pressure 708 mm. of mercury ) .
The return to sea-level ( New York ) was made direct from Asheville , a journey of 22 hours and involving a change of altitude of slightly over two thousand feet .
Fourteen hours after arrival , the alveolar C02 pressure was found to be 33T ( barometric pressure 766 mm. of mercury ) , a slightly lower value than usual .
On the third day at sea-level the C02 pressure was 34'0 mm. of mercury .
The values obtained during the subsequent three weeks varied from 33'2 mm. of mercury to 35'6 mm. of mercury , the normal mean value obtained for New York being 34Y mm. ( mean barometric pressure 759 mm. of mercury ) .
Thus at altitudes ranging from 4000 feet to 2000 feet , and at barometric pressures ranging from 663 to 708 mm. of mercury , there appears to be no respiratory reaction in M. P. F. G. Entirely different behaviour of the respiratory centre was therefore met with below 4000 and above 5000 feet , for in the latter experience ( 5000-14,000 feet ) , f although the response of the respiratory centre to want of oxygen was slow , it was nevertheless apparent .
From the present series of experiments , and in spite of a stay of eight weeks at 3850 feet , the alveolar C02 pressure remained at sea-level value ( 34 mm. of mercury ) at barometric pressures ranging from 759 to 663 mm. of mercury .
The sea-level value of 34 mm. of mercury falls within the lower limits of * In spite of this , however , there was a general improvement in condition as evidenced by increase in bodily weight .
Excellent food was provided at the sanatorium , and the daily consumption of food was greater than usual .
It must be borne in mind that fatigue was easily produced since I had been weakened during the previous winter by a chronic Staphylococcus infection .
t Ibid. , p. 367 .
Changes in Breathing and Blood at High Altitudes .
257 alveolar C02 pressure observed for normal women .
Whether the fact of my COa pressure remaining at the normal value in spite of the barometric pressure varying from 759 to 663 mm. of mercury is an idiosyncrasy , or an indication that with persons in whom the alveolar CO2 pressure is naturally low a marked decrease of barometric pressure ( i.e. more than 100 mm. of mercury ) is required to produce a lowering of the threshold value of the C02 pressure , can only be determined by further experiments .
In contrast to the absence of change in the alveolar C02 , the hfemoglobin in M. P. F. G. rose , as before , * with decreased barometric pressure and fell as sea-level pressure was approached .
From an initial value of 89 per cent , at New York , the haemoglobin had after three days at Highlands ( altitude 3850 feet ; barometric pressure 668 mm. of mercury ) risen to 96 per cent. It oscillated during the following four weeks between 91 and 93 per cent , and was 98 per cent , during the eighth week , after a fortnight had been spent at an altitude of 4200 feet .
At Waynesville ( altitude 2645 feet ) it fell to 93 per cent. , and was again 96 per cent , at Asheville ( altitude 2210 feet and barometric pressure 708 mm. of mercury ) .
Three days after the return to New York a lower value than usual was recorded , 87 per cent. The haemoglobin reached 92 per cent , a few days later , and then fell to the normal value of 89 per cent. Conclusions .
1 .
In persons acclimatised at altitudes up to 3850 feet , the partial pressure of C02 in the air of the lung alveoli is invariably lower than at sea-level , so that the lung ventilation is correspondingly increased .
The results of the present investigation are in accord with those obtained with persons acclimatised at altitudes of 5000 to 14,000 feet , and support the conclusion previously published that " the lowering of the C02 pressure is in direct proportion to the diminution of the barometric pressure , and amounts to about 4'2 mm. or 10'5 per cent , of the sea-level value for each 100 mm. of diminution of barometric pressure .
" 2 .
It is again found that in women , as at sea-level , the alveolar C02 pressure is about 3 mm. lower than in men .
3 .
As at higher altitudes , in persons acclimatised at altitudes up to 3850 feet , the percentage of haemoglobin in the blood is increased .
The present observations support the view previously published that " for every 100 mm. fall of atmospheric pressure the percentage of haemoglobin in the blood is increased by about 10 per cent , of the normal value for men at sea-level .
" * Ibid. , p. 369 .
258 Mr. A. Compton .
Optimum Temperature an In women , as at sea-level , the values are about 11 per cent , lower than for men , but greater irregularity is observed .
Graphic representations and tables of the results are given .
To render possible a complete survey of the alveolar gas pressures and the haemoglobin percentages recorded for acclimatised persons at varying atmospheric pressures and heights above sea-level , the values previously published* are included in the graphs .
In conclusion , I wish to express my cordial appreciation of the kind help and hospitality received during the investigation .
My thanks are specially due to Dr. Mary Lapham , of Highlands , Dr. Stokes and Mr. J. Tull , of Waynesville , and to Dr. George Purefoy and Messrs. Taylor and Johnstone ( U.S. Weather Bureau ) , of Asheville .
My sincere thanks are also due to Dr. J. S. Haldane for his advice and for the loan of standardised instruments , and to Prof. Yandell Henderson , of Yale University , for the further loan of apparatus .
Constancy of the Optimum Temperature of an Enzyme under Varying Concentrations of Substrate and of Enzyme .
By Arthur Compton , Imperial Cancer Research Bund .
( Communicated by Sir J. R. Bradford , K.C.M.G. , Sec. R.S. Received June 10 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1914 .
) In a recent paper+ a new enzymic relation is recorded .
For the enzymic hydrolysis of salicin\#151 ; by the enzyme which Gabriel Bertrand and the author^ have named salicinase\#151 ; it is found that , in an action of fixed duration , S the temperature of greatest activity of the ferment is always the same , whatever the dilutions of substrate and of enzyme adopted for the determination .
In other words , the duration of the action being constant , the optimum temperature of the ferment is independent of the concentration both of the substrate and of the enzyme .
The observation is suggestive : if true of one enzyme it may be true of all , and possibly becomes the enunciation of a general law .
Herein , for the moment , lies its main interest .
