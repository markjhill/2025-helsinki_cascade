The following communications were read : I. " On the daily Fall of the Barometer at Toronto .
" By THOMAS HOPKINS , Esq. Communicated by WILLIAM FAIRBAIRN , Esq. Received December 19 , 1857 .
( Abstract .
) In this paper the writer exhibited tables of the movements of meteorological instruments registered at Toronto in 1846 , in the months of January and July , as specimens of the changes which take place in the atmosphere in winter and summer .
The principal object was to find the cause of the fall of the barometer in the middle of the day .
The author endeavours to show that the vapour , which in the early part of the day was produced by solar heat at the surface , by its expansive power , bore that heat to the upper regions of the air , where it was condensed by the cold of the gases in that situation , when the heat of elasticity was set at liberty to warm and expand the gases , and that it was this expansion which reduced atmospheric pressure in the locality and caused a fall of the barometer .
