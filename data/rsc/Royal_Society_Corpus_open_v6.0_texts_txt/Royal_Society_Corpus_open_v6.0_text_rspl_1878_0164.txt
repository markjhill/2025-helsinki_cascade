520 Dr. F. W. Pavy on the [ Apr. 24 , V. " Further Researches on the Physiology of Sugar in relation to the Blood .
" By F. W. Pavy , M.D. , F.R.S ' .
Received April 3 , 1879 .
The results brought forward in this communication are supplementary to those published in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society " for June , 1877 ( vol. xxvi , pp. 314 , 346 ) .
The first of these communications was devoted to the consideration of the quantitative determination of sugar for physiological purposes .
Some important physiological conclusions had been drawn by Bernard from the results obtained through a modified method introduced by him of employing Fehling 's solution .
I pointed out the manner in which 1 considered the process in question to be open to fallacy , and showed that the results yielded by it differed to a marked extent from those yielded by a gravimetric method , which I described , of using the copper test .
I have since continued my investigations , and have now results to bring forward obtained by another process , which I described in a communication read at the Royal Society , January 16,1879 , and published in the " Proceedings , " vol. xxviii , p. 260 .
This process does not differ in principle of action from Bernard 's , and if therfe were no fallacy in either case involved , the results yielded by the two should agree .
In both the reduction of the oxide of copper is made to occur without the precipitation of the reduced oxide , so that the change to be watched in the action of the test is a progressive decoloration , unobscured by the presence of any deposit .
In Bernard 's process this result is brought about by the action of potasb in a concentrated form upon the organic matter incidentally present in the product prepared for examination , and the agency in force is , according to the view I have expressed , the development of ammonia .
In my own process , for particulars regarding which I must refer to the published communication in the " Proceedings , " ammonia is added to the test , and no fixed alkali employed beyond that present in Fehling 's solution .
By means of this new process an opportunity is afforded of ascertaining on which side the fault lies in the disagreement between the results obtained by Bernard 's and the gravimetric method .
The accompanying table contains the results given by the application of the three processes to six specimens of blood .
The figures in the first two columns are derived from the analyses respectively conducted with the use of potash ( Bernard 's plan ) and ammonia , and with the adoption of Bernard 's proposition that the liquid obtained from equal weights of blood and sulphate of soda measures , in cub. centims. , four-fifths of the total weight in grammes of the sulphate of soda and blood taken .

The figures in the next two columns represent the results given by the same two processes of analysis applied to the product obtained after the plan adopted for the gravimetric process .
The blood is treated with sulphate of soda , filtered , the coagulum thoroughly washed to extract all the sugar , and the filtrate and washings brought to a known volume .
The last column furnishes the mean of two gravimetric analyses carried out upon two portions of the blood distinct from that employed for the analyses in columns 3 and 4 .

0-879 0-635 0-945 0-650 0-631 On looking at the results the first point to which attention may be directed is that evidence is supplied showing that reliance cannot be placed upon the formula adopted by Bernard for calculating the volume of liquid derivable from the weight of blood taken for analysis .
The figures in columns 3 and 4 were drawn from direct observation , and if the formula supplied correct information , the results in columns 1 and 3 and 2 and 4 should respectively coincide .
It is noticeable , however , that whilst in some instances they approach closely towards agreement , in others there is a pretty wide divergence .
In the second place it is seen that the results obtained by the method of analysis involving the employment of the potash stand considerably higher than those yielded by the ammoniated form of the test .
It may be assumed that in the action of the potash on the incidental organic matter present to give rise to the required condition for mainDr .
F. W. Pavy on the [ Apr. 24j taining the suboxide in the dissolved state , a reducing substance becomes developed , or else that the amount of oxide of copper appropriated to the oxidation of the sugar becomes altered in the presence of the large amount of potash which it is necessary to employ .
Lastly , it may be observed that a close conformity exists between the figures in columns 4 and 5 .
The results obtained by the gravimetric method are thus confirmed by the volumetric results obtained by means of the ammoniated form of the cupric test .
Seeing that separately prepared specimens of the respective samples of blood were submitted to the two kinds of analysis , the conformity is certainly striking , and gives strong weight to the validity of the results yielded by the gravimetric method .
One of the points referred to in my second communication* is the spontaneous disappearance of sugar from the blood after withdrawal from the body .
It is a part of Bernard 's doctrine that the natural seat of destruction of sugar within the system is in the systemic capillaries , and if it can be shown that an active disappearance of sugar occurs in the blood after removal from the vessels , support is given to his proposition .
I cited the observation which has been adduced by Bernard to illustrate that a marked aptitude exists for the disappearance of sugar under the circumstances named .
According to this observation , a reduction from 1#070 to 0'880 parts per 1,000 occurred during the first half-hour , and at the end of 24 hours the analytical result obtained is represented as standing thus\#151 ; 0'000 .
I stated that my own experience furnished evidence of a widely different nature , and introduced the figures yielded by five observations in proof of this assertion .
The gravimetric process is only suited for the examination of blood before decomposition has set in , as the result would be vitiated by the presence of ammonia as a product of decomposition , the effect being an interference with the deposition of the cuprous oxide .
With the ammoniated cupric test , however , any state is suitable ; and since my communication of June 21st , 1877 , was published , I have applied this process , as well as Bernard 's potash process , to blood which has been kept for lengthened periods , instead of limiting the examination , as I had previously done , to the first twenty-four hours .
The results obtained were quite unlooked for , and quite irreconcileable with the representation in Bernard 's observation , which has been referred to , that at the end of twenty-four hours the blood ceased to give any indication of the presence of sugar .
I have before me a large amount of recorded experience , but need only select a few illustrative examples , for the information supplied is of the same nature throughout .
In no case , although the blood had acquired a highly offensive character from putrefaction , has it failed to * " Proc. Boy .

] Physiology of Sugar in relation to the Blood .
exercise a decided amount of reducing power over the copper test .
It will be seen in the succeeding observations that there is a period during the first few days when the reducing power undergoes a pretty sudden fall , and that it afterwards remains nearly stationary .
If the reducing action is to be attributed to sugar , and sugar only , it would have to be said that sugar can exist in a mass of putrefied blood without undergoing destruction .
It seems to me , and this view is supported by evidence to be presently adduced derivable from the addition of sugar to decomposing blood , that there is another reducing substance present besides sugar which is not affected in a similar manner by contiguous decomposition .
The period of sudden fall , it appears , may be taken as corresponding with the disappearance of sugar , and this , it will be noticed , presents a variation within certain limits .
In the observations at the top of the list the period is more prolonged than in those lower down .
It is possible that this may have arisen from the atmosphere of the laboratory having become influenced by the presence of decomposing samples of blood .
The earlier observations were conducted with the application of Bernard 's process only , as it was not until June , 1878 , that I began to apply the ammoniated cupric liquid .
In the employment of this liquid the same product prepared from the blood was used as for Bernard 's mode of testing .
It is noticeable that the results yielded by the two processes differ from each other in the manner that has been already commented upon .

0*369 0-294 In the following series of experiments sugar was added to blood at different periods after withdrawal .
The results furnish the same kind of evidence as that obtained through the previous observations .
A marked descent is noticeable in the reducing power until a certain point is attained , after which but little change occurs , however long the blood may be kept , and however putrid it may become .
It seems , therefore , as already suggested , that there is a reducing agent in the blood which comports itself differently from sugar .
If the reducing action were due solely to sugar , it is not intelligible that there should be a more or less sharp descent to a certain point , and then that 1879 .

525 the condition should remain comparatively stationary .
There is no reason that the last portion of sugar should behave differently from the first .
Something having a reducing power , on the other hand , appears to exist which possesses a stability greater than that enjoyed by sugar , and which , thus resisting the influence of the changes of decomposition , produced the reducing effect on the test exerted by the blood after keeping for thirty days .

I was desirous of ascertaining if oxygen promoted the disappearance of sugar , and counterpart observations were made with carbonic acid and hydrogen .
The results obtained afford no evidence of any chemical action being exerted .
Whatever slight effect occurred , I think , may be assumed to have arisen from increased molecular action excited by the transit of the gas .

1 * The following conclusions may be expressed as constituting the issue of the results recorded in this communication:\#151 ; That the results bearing on the physiology of sugar in relation to the blood derived from the application of the gravimetric process , and given in my former communication to the Royal Society ( vol. xxvi , p. 846 ) , are confirmed by those yielded by the ammoniated cupric test , described by me in the " Proceedings , " vol. xxviii , p. 260 .
That the disappearance of sugar from the blood after withdrawal from the system takes place in the gradual manner that might be expected from the effect of ordinary decomposition , and presents nothing to support any conclusion regarding the destruction of sugar in the blood as a physiological phenomenon .
2 \lt ; 3 2 Presents .
[ Apr. 3 , That there appears to exist a reducing substance besides sugar in the blood which is of a sufficiently stable character to resist the effects of advanced putrefaction .
Expressed as sugar , it amounts to from .200 to *300 per 1,000 .
These figures , therefore , would appear to require to be deducted from those which have been given as representing the amount of sugar present in the blood .
That the passage of a current of oxygen through the blood does not exert any appreciable effect in the direction of oxidation of the sugar .
