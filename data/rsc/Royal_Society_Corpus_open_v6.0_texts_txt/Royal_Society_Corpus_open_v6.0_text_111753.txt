" On a New Phosphite of Ethyl , 3C4 HIO , PO3 .
" By A. W. WILLIAMSON , Ph. D. , &amp;c. Communicated by Dr. SHARPEY , Sec. R.S. Received June 15 , 1854 .
The following results were obtained by Mr. Railton in an investigation undertaken in connexion with the idea that the water of constitution discovered by Wurtz may be conceived as basic .
The processes for preparing the compound are thus described by Mr. Railton .
1st .
When three atoms of absolute alcohol are acted upon by one atom of PCl1 , this compound is formed .
The alcohol is introduced into a retort which is connected with an apparatus for upward distillation , and the retort is surrounded with a freezing mixture .
The terchloride is then added drop by drop , the whole is then gently heated for some time , the vapour being allowed to run back into the retort .
It is now distilled and the portion which comes off between 140 ?
C. and 196 ?
C. collected and redistilled , that portion being preserved which boils between 188 ?
and 191 ?
C. The quantity of pure ether obtained by this process was not large , and there was left in the retort a considerable amount of P0O and other products , which on further heating evolved inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen .
2nd .
This ether is obtained with the greatest facility from ethylate of soda and terchloride of phosphorus .
I introduce into a thirty ounce stoppered retort about a pint of ether , which must be perfectly free from alcohol and from water .
The ethylate of soda is then added , and as much PC13 is taken as is necessary to form chloride of sodium and phosphite of ethyl .
The ether is absolutely necessary , for without it , the action of the PC1 , is so violent , as to set fire to the ethylate .
The PC13 is introduced into the mixture of ether and ethylate of soda through a long funnel , which is drawn to an extremely fine point , by which means it enters drop by drop into the mixture , thus avoiding the violent action which otherwise occurs .
The retort should be kept quite cool and frequently shaken .
If these precautions are neglected considerable loss is experienced .
When the whole of the PC13 has been added , the ether is distilled off by a water-bath .
The retort is then transferred to an oil-bath which is gradually heated up to about 240 ?
C. The whole of the distillate obtained by the oil-bath is collected in a dry receiver , and as it is prone to decomposition if distilled in air , it is distilled in an atmosphere of hydrogen , the portion which comes off at 188 ?
C. is the phosphite of ethyl .
I may here notice the remarkable fact , that this substance has two boiling points , as doubtless have many other bodies , if distilled under similar circumstances .
In air it boils at 191 ?
C. while , as I said before , it boils in hydrogen at 188 ?
C. Its specific gravity is 1'075 .
3rd .
The reaction which occurs on the formation of this ether may be represented by the following formula:3NaO , C4HO0 + PCl3= 3NaC1 + 3C4HO , P3 , .
The carbon and hydrogen were estimated in the usual manner by oxide of copper , the phosphorus as follows .
A weighed portion of the ether was introduced into a twelve ounce stoppered bottle ; concentrated nitric acid was poured upon it , and the bottle allowed to stand in a warm place , loosely stopped , for several days .
When nitrous fumes no longer appeared , the oxidation of the phosphorous acid was deemed to be complete .
The acid liquid was then saturated with ammonia , some chloride of ammonium and sulphate of magnesia then added , and the mixture well shaken .
It was allowed to stand for some time , when a precipitate of phosphate of magnesia and ammonia was formed ; this was washed , dried , and ignited , and the amount of phosphorus calculated from the result .
These are the results .

The method of taking the vapour densities of bodies liable to oxidation was described by me about twelve months ago , in the Chemical Society 's Quarterly Journal .
It was used in the following experiments .
1st .
Weight of globe filled with air at 53 ?
F. and 30-2 in .
barometer , 188-213 grs. Weight of empty globe , 186'313 grs. Weight of globe and vapour at 521 ?
F. and 30'3 in .
barometer , 192-387 grs. Capacity of globe at 60 ?
F. , 6-00 cub. in .
Residual hydrogen '05 cub. in .
Capacity of globe at 521 ?
F. , 6-40 cub. in .
Six cubic inches of air at 53 ?
F. and 30'2 in .
barometer , become at 60 ?
F. and 30 in .
barometer 6-12 cub. in .
, and weigh 1-90 grs. ?
05 cub. in .
hydrogen at 60 ?
F. become '094 cub. in .
at 521 ?
F. , and weigh '002 grs. 6'40-'094=6'306 cub. in .
vapour at 521 ?
F. , which at 60 ?
F. and 30 in .
barometer =3*376 cub. in .
Hence 192'387--002=192'385-186'313-=6072 grains , the weight of 3 376 cub. in .
vapour .
100 cubic inches. .
= 17986 grs. 100 cubic inches air= 31'01 grs. The density is therefore 5'800 , from which it appears that its combining measure is four volumes .
Density by calculation =5-763 .
A second experiment gave 5'877 .
This substance has a highly offensive odour , it burns with a bluish white flame , is soluble in water , alcohol , and ether , and is slowly decomposed in contact with air .
On boiling phosphite of ethyl with concentrated solution of baryta , in water , it is decomposed into alcohol and a salt which varies according to the amount of baryta used .
If one atom of the ether be treated with one of baryta , a crystallized salt is produced on evaporation , the carbon and hydrogen in which are , according to an analysis I have just completed .

36-880 37-090 In that marked ' required ' I have supposed the salt to bear the following formula and to be completely anhydrous , 2C4 , H0 , BaO , P03 , but if we suppose that four atoms of water are present in the salt analyzed , the relation will stand thus Found .

20-354 20-453 5-356 5-540 The formula would then be 2C , H50 , BaO , PO3+4HO .
When two atoms of baryta are made to act upon one atom of the ether , a salt is obtained which does not crystallize , and it may be evaporated in air without sensible decomposition .
This salt is perfectly neutral to test paper ; when dry it is a white friable deliquescent mass , the formula of which will be C4H50 , 2BaO , P03 .
If an excess of baryta is used , a white salt is thrown down on boiling , which I suppose to be HO , 2BaO , PO3 .
I have prepared another compound with three equivalents of amyle .
This was obtained from amylate of soda by an analogous process to that described for the phosphite of ethyl .
Analysis has pointed out the formula 3C0oH10O , PO3 .
Like phosphite of ethyl it is easily decomposed on being heated in air ; heated in hydrogen it is more stable and then boils at 2360 C. It is soluble in ether and in alcohol , but only slightly soluble in water .
