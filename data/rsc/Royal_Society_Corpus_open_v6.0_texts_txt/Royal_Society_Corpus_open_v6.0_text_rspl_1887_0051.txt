the axes and in the azimuth of the major axis of the elliptically polarised light , and was observed in the case of two different crystals which were made the subject of experiment .
Since the light reflected from the surface of the crystal is exceedingly nearly plane polarised , the absolute value of the change in the ratio of the axes is small ; but the relative change is considerable , for tan vr is altered by polishing from 0 0334 to 0*0252 .
Also the change in the azimuth of the major axis is not very large .
As regards the disturbing causes , it is found that temperature and time do not cause any very perceptible alterations in the surface state of a polished crystal .
The experiments prove a result unnoticed by Seebeck , that an emery-rouge polished surface gives perfectly concordant results on repolishing , and in this respect is quite as satisfactory as the chalk-polished surface recommended by hi m. This conclusion is supported both by the elliptic and simple analysers .
And in general the results of the paper tend to confirm the views of Seebeck rather than those of Sir J. Conroy , for Seebeck in his paper prefers polished surfaces because of the liability of the natural surface to tarnish .
In conclusion , my best thanks are due to Mr. Glazebrook for his advice , and to Professor J. J. Thomson for placing at my disposal a room and apparatus in the Cavendish Laboratory .
" Further Experiments on the Distribution of Micro-organisms in Air ( by Hesse 's Method ) .
" By Percy F. Frankland , Ph. D. , B.Sc. , F.C.S. , and T. G. Hart , A.R.S.M. Communicated by Prof. Frankland , D.C.L. , F.R.S. Received November 22 , \#151 ; Read December 9 , 1886 .
[ Plate 3.J In a previous communication entitled " The Distribution of Microorganisms in Air/ ' a number of experiments have been recorded by one of us on the relative abundance of microbes in the air of various places and of the same place at different times .
The numerical determination of the aerial micro-organisms in these experiments was made by means of Hesse 's apparatus , the method of using which was there fully described .
Since the publication of the above experiments we have been extending our investigations by means of this method , and the results which we have obtained form the subject of the present communication .
In addition to the determination of the number of micro-organisms VOL. X.LII .
X 268 Dr. P. F. Frankland and Mr. T. G. Hart .
in a given volume of air by means of Hesse 's process , we have also , as before , determined in each case the number of microbes falling on a given horizontal area in unit of time , by the exposure of small dishes containing sterile nutrient gelatine , as previously described .
During the hot weather we have experienced considerable difficulty in working with Hesse 's tubes , which are very liable to melt in transport and when exposed to the sun ; to obviate this we have made a practice on hot days of surrounding the outer surface of the tube with a coating of bibulous paper saturated with water , and this envelope was again covered with a coating of white tissue paper to prevent the former drying too rapidly .
Owing to this precaution we have scarcely ever lost a tube even on the warmest days .
The greater number of our observations have been made on the roof of the Science Schools , South Kensington , which thus form a continuation of those already recorded .
We have also made further experiments in Hyde Park , the Brompton Hospital for Consumption , the Natural History Museum , and in the garden of the latter closely adjoining the traffic in the Exhibition Road , South Kensington .
I. Hoof of Science Schoo , South Kensington .
The samples of air were here collected at a height of about 60 feet above the ground in the manner previously described .
The particulars of the experiments are recorded in the following table ( Table I ) .
These experiments , taken together with those already published , form a continuous series , excepting a few breaks , from January to the end of October of the present year , and serve to illustrate the changes which take place in the prevalence of aerial micro-organisms according to the seasons .
In order to render these results more readily intelligible , we have also expressed them by means of a curve in the accompanying diagram ( Plate 3 ) , in which the ordinates represent the number of micro-organisms found in 10 litres of air , whilst on the horizontal axis the dates are marked off .
Below , on the same diagram , the temperature of the air at the time of experiment is recorded .
From this diagram it will be seen that , although the number of micro-organisms in the air frequently undergoes great changes from one day to another , yet the general tendency is for the number to follow the temperature .
Thus , on taking the average of the results obtained in each month , the following ' sequence is arrived at:\#151 ; On the Distribution of Micro-organisms Air .

12-5 35 From the above it will be seen that it is during the hottest months of the year\#151 ; July and August\#151 ; " -that the largest number of micro-organisms is present in the air .
In September the number underwent a great reduction , which Was further continued in October .
II .
Experiments in Interior of Buildings .
In Table No. II we have recorded a number of experiments which we have made in the interior of buildings , viz. , in the Hospital for Consumption , Brompton , in Burlington House , in the Natural History Museum , in the Chemical Laboratory of the Science Schools , South Kensington , as well as in a bam and cowhouse in the country .
The results of the above experiments fully substantiate the previous observations made by one of us , that in the interior of buildings , \amp ; c. , the number of organisms present in the air is almost wholly dependent upon whether the latter is in a disturbed state or not , and that when undisturbed the number is generally considerably less than in the open air , whilst in crowded rooms the number rises enormously .
Thus in the Hospital for Consumption , when only a few persons were moving about the ward , the air was remarkably free from microbes , the number increasing somewhat when the number of people in the room increased , but even then the number fell very far short of that in the crowded rooms of the Royal Society during the conversazione , or in the Natural History Museum on Whit Monday , whilst the greatest number which we have ever recorded was found in a bam in which the operation of thrashing was going on , the number of micro-organisms falling on the square foot in one minute amounting there to upwards of 8000 .
III .
Miscellaneous Open-Air Experiments .
In Table III we have recorded the results of some experiments x 2 Dr. P. F. Frankland and Mr. T. G. Hart .
made in the open air at other places than the roof of the Science fechools .
This table includes , in the first place , a comparison between the number of micro-organisms present in the air of Hyde Park , the roof of the Science Schools , and the entrance to the latter in the Exhibition Road respectively , the experiments in these three places being all made on the same day .
It will be seen that the air in Hyde Park contained markedly less than either of the other two , and that the air in the Exhibition Road in which a large amount of traffic was going on at the time was considerably richer in micro-organisms than the air on the roof .
Then follow several experiments made in the garden of the Natural History Museum in the immediate vicinity of the Exhibition Road .
In every case , excepting one , this air was exceedingly rich in micro-organisms , as was to be anticipated ; whilst on the occasion when the number of organisms was small , the wind , which was very gentle , was not blowing from the road but over the grass of the garden which was damp at the time .
The above experiments are intended to form a supplement to those aliealy published by one of us , in which the same method of investigation was pursued .
In the course of these experiments we have found that the results obtained with Hesse 's apparatus are liable to considerable inaccuracy when the latter is employed in a disturbed atmosphere , more especially when the aerial currents are irregular in direction .
This source of error has been fully discussed fn another paper by one of us , and a new method of examining air for microorganisms , in which this difficulty is overcome , has been devised and its accuracy carefully tested .
[ Note , Since the communication of the above , we have completed the observations for November and December , with the following results:\#151 ; Average number of colonies Average temperature obtained from 10 litres 1886 .
