In a previous communicationj* we have shown ( 1 ) that chloroform has a much higher solubility in serum or haemoglobin solutions than in water or saline ; ( 2 ) that at the same vapour-pressure of the chloroform the amount dissolved in serum or haemoglobin solution is considerably higher than in saline or water ; ( 3 ) that the curve of chloroform vapour-pressure and concentration in solution in the case of water and saline is a straight line , while in the case of serum and haemoglobin solution it is a curve showing association at the higher vapour-pressures ; ( 4 ) that in the case of serum addition of chloroform causes an opalescence and a slow precipitation at room temperature ( 15 ' C. ) , and at body temperature ( 40 ' C. ) a rapid , though incomplete , precipitation , also in the case of haemoglobin , 1*5 to 2 per cent , of chloroform causes a change of colour and commencing precipitation at room temperature , which becomes almost complete in the thermostat at 40 ' C. , while 5 per cent , and over causes complete precipitation , even at 0 ' C. In our previous paper we also recorded the relations between chloroform vapour-pressure and concentration of the anaesthetic in solution for water , saline and serum , throughout a range from below the anaesthetising value to nearly saturation , and gave curves illustrating these relationships .
From these experiments we drew the conclusion that chloroform forms an unstable chemical compound or physical aggregation with the proteids experimented upon , and that it is carried in the blood in such a state of combination .
Since proteids build up the living protoplasm , the inference was drawn that chloroform and other anaesthetics must form similar unstable compounds with protoplasm , and that anaesthesia is due to the formation of such compounds , which limit the chemical activities of the protoplasm .
On account of the instability of the compounds , these remain formed only so long as the pressure of the anaesthetic in the solution is maintained .

On certain Properties of Solutions of etc. 87 Since the publication of our paper we have extended our observations to certain tissues in the fresh condition , to emulsions in saline of the ethereal extracts of the tissues of equal concentration to the tissues in " lipoid " or ethereal extractives , and to estimations of the relative solubilities in water and serum of a number of other anaesthetics , and observation of the effects of such other anaesthetics upon the proteids of the serum .
The additional experiments show that the proteids of the tissues combine with chloroform in a similar fashion to the proteids of the serum , and also that other anaesthetics possess higher solubilities in serum than in water , and that the effects in the case of each anaesthetic upon the proteids of the serum , as the anaesthetic is increased in concentration , are similar to those already recorded in the case of chloroform , although the points of commencement of opalescence and precipitation vary quantitatively in the different cases .
Experiments have also been made upon the relative variations in depression of the freezing point caused by additions of chloroform to water , saline , and serum respectively , as also of the variations in electrical conductivity produced in saline and serum respectively by additions of chloroform .
The various series of experiments can best be described under the headings indicated above .
A.\#151 ; Experiments on the Relationship between Vapour-pressure and Concentration of Chloroform in certain Tissues in the Fresh Condition .
The experiments were made in the " differential densimeter " described in our previous paper , and following the procedures and precautions there discussed , and it is accordingly only necessary here to state how the tissues were prepared for introduction into the densimeter .
The tissue concerned was cleared as far as possible from blood ; in the case of the heart muscle and liver by perfusion of saline through the organ , and in the case of the brain by dissecting out the larger vessels and washing with saline solution .
Adherent connective tissue and fat were removed as completely as possible and the tissue was then passed through a machine sold for comminution of tissues for subcutaneous injection .
The mass so obtained is too thick in consistency for introduction into the densimeter and was made thinner by addition of an equal volume of normal saline .
The tissues were so prepared in as fresh a condition as possible , and the various dilutions of chloroform were made as described in our previous paper .
The emulsion of tissue and saline is so opaque that it is impossible to estimate the solubility of chloroform therein by direct observation as we had previously done in the case of serum , but the observations on vapour-pressure given below , show that in the H 2 88 Prof. B. Moore and Dr. H. E. Boaf .
[ Oct. 19 , case of all the tissues experimented with the solubility is much higher than in the case of water or saline .
As in the case of serum and haemoglobin , a gradual precipitation of the tissue proteid occurs with increasing concentration of chloroform , shown by change in colour and by the emulsion of tissue becoming flocculent and separating out .
This change occurs more readily , and at lower concentration of chloroform , at body temperature than at room temperature .
This is shown by the fact that a mixture of the tissue and a certain strength of chloroform which remains perfectly stable and uncoagulated when kept unheated , rapidly changes colour and separates out when heated in the densimeter .
The amount of proteid in each tissue emulsion was determined by coagulation by excess of alcohol , drying and weighing ; and the amount of ethereal extractive , by extracting in the manner described in the next .section for preparation of ethereal extracts .
The amount of ethereal extract .so obtained was used to determine the amount of ethereal extract of the fresh tissue required to be added to saline in order to form an emulsion of equal concentration in lipoid for carrying out the companion vapour-pressure .experiments of the succeeding section .
Experiment 1.\#151 ; Brain Tissue .
The brains of two sheep were prepared as above described .
The amount of proteid in the emulsion as introduced into the densimeter was 7'36 per cent. , and the amount of ethereal extractive was 4*07 per cent. The results of the experiments are given in Table I , and graphically in Curve 1 , fig. 1 , in which they are compared with ethereal extractive alone , of equal concentration , in emulsion in normal saline .

[ Oct. 19 , B.\#151 ; Experiments on the Relationship between Vapour-pressure and Concentration of Chloroform in Emulsions in Saline of the Ethereal Extractives { Lipoids ) of Serum and Brain Tissue .
These experiments were devised with the object of testing whether the alterations in the relationships between vapour-pressure of the anaesthetic and its concentration , as compared with water and saline , found in the case of serum and the tissues , were due entirely to lipoids or ethereal extractives contained in these fluids , or whether part of the effect was due to action of the proteids .
The results shown in the curves of figs. 1 and 3 , clearly show that a great deal of the action is due to the proteid .
That a certain amount of the anaesthetic will be taken up by the lipoid in a physical fashion there can be no doubt on account of the high solubility of chloroform and other anaesthetics in such lipoid substances .
But we hold that the portion of anaesthetic so taken up and held by the lipoid is passive and not active , and that it is the other portion taken up by the proteid ( the existence of which figs. 1 and 3 demonstrate ) which is active in paralysing protoplasmic activity and producing anaesthesia .
It is a matter of common experience that the greater the amount of fatty tissue in a subject undergoing anaesthetisation , the greater the amount of anaesthetic required .
The portion of anaesthetic which is absorbed by the lipoid is imprisoned as far as purposes of anaesthetisation are concerned , and so much the more anaesthetic must be given in order to raise the pressure of anaesthetic sufficiently and cause combination between cell-protoplasm and anaesthetic with resulting anaesthetisation .
The ethereal extractives ( lipoids ) were obtained by the following method :\#151 ; The proteid of the serum or brain tissue was completely precipitated by addition of excess of absolute alcohol , and the precipitate was separated from the alcohol .
The precipitate was thoroughly extracted with ether .
The absolute alcohol solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue also thoroughly extracted with ether .
The two ethereal extracts were united and the ether evaporated off .
The total ethereal extractive was weighed and then made up into a fine emulsion by shaking with normal saline ( 0*75 per cent. ) .
The volume of the emulsion was made equal to that of the serum originally taken , and in the case of the brain tissue the concentration of the emulsion of the ethereal extract was made equal to the amount of lipoid directly determined in the sheep 's brain .
For comparison with the results in the case of the ethereal extractive emulsion of serum , the results in the case of serum from our former paper are given , and the comparison is shown in the two curves of fig. 3 .
In the case of the brain tissue and the emulsion of the lipoids of brain tissue of equal concentration , the results are shown alongside in the two curves of fig. 1 .

] On certain Properties of Solutions of , etc. 93 Separation or Coagulation of the Lipoid Emulsions by Chloroform and other Substances .
An interesting physical effect is seen as the amount of chloroform added to the emulsion of lipoids in saline is increased .
At a certain stage , dependent upon the richness of the emulsion in lipoid , a complete separation of the lipoid , in a butter-like mass , is obtained , leaving the saline practically free from lipoid .
The phenomenon suggests a resemblance to the similar precipitation of proteid observed under like conditions , but there is this difference , that in the case of proteid , when the amount of anaesthetic is sufficient , the precipitate is permanently altered , being coagulated and rendered insoluble in water or saline , while the lipoid is only physically thrown out , and can be re-dissolved in ether and again made into an emulsion with saline .
This phenomenon of physical aggregation of the lipoid by the anaesthetic is the more remarkable because the emulsions are exceedingly permanent and remain unaltered for days .
The permanency is probably due to lecithin , and the emulsion under the microscope shows small bodies , which are not in most cases spheres , but show the appearance of bi- concave discs of varying size , many being no larger than mammalian blood-corpuscles .
The physical cause for the production of such discs is at present unknown to us , but the matter is being further investigated .
In the case of the emulsion of brain tissue ( containing 4'07 per cent , of lipoid ) coagulation or separation of the emulsion occurs in the cold when about 2 per cent , of chloroform has been added , and the coagulation occurs much earlier at body temperature .
The coagulum or separated lipoid forms a jelly-like mass , which later separates into a thin whitish fluid and a butterlike mass .
These emulsions can also be coagulated or separated by solutions of neutral salts , alcohol , benzol , xylol , and other organic fluids .
The precipitation may be due to a lowering of surface tension in the emulsion , and presents an interesting analogy with the precipitation of proteids and other colloids from solution by neutral salts , chloroform , and other organic substances which act as anaesthetics .
It may be noted in this connection that froth on serum disappears when chloroform is dropped into it , and we have noticed the absence of frothing on stirring on the chloroform side of our densimeter as compared with the control side .
Experiment 4.\#151 ; Ethereal Extract of Serum .
The extract was obtained as described , the percentage of ethereal extractive ( lipoid ) in the emulsion in saline as introduced into the densimeter was 0*206 .
The results are given in Table IY , and shown graphically in Curve 2 , fig. 3 , where they are contrasted with the results given by entire serum .

C.\#151 ; Relative Solubilities of a Series of Anaesthetics in Water and Serum respectively , and the Effects of Addition of such Ancesthetics upon the Serum .
The method of determining the solubility of the anaesthetic consisted in weighing out known amounts of the anaesthetic into water and serum respectively , stoppering the flasks , placing on the mechanical shaker for some hours , and then determining by direct observation that concentration in each case at which the anaesthetic ceased to be dissolved .
The anaesthetics so tested were chloroform , ethyl ether , ethyl acetate , amyl alcohol , amyl acetate , benzol , and xylol .
The results obtained were as follows :\#151 ; Chloroform .

In all cases the solubility in serum is higher than in water , and it is clear from the results that a similar association between the anaesthetic and the proteid of the serum occurs throughout the series .
The amount of ethereal extractive in the different samples of serum used for the determinations varied between 0*24 and 036 per cent. , thus showing that the increased solubilities found could not be due to solution of the anaesthetic in lipoid or ethereal extractives present in the serum .
D. Changes in Depression of the Freezing Point of , Saline , and Serum respectively caused by the addition of Chloroform .
These experiments were undertaken to elucidate if possible the state in which the chloroform existed in the proteid solutions .
The determinations were made with Beckmann 's apparatus .
On account of the chloroform being volatile , the apparatus had to be completely closed , and the stirring accomplished by electro-magnet in the usual way .
The solution was placed in a straight tube , which was almost completely filled , so that no correction was required for escape of chloroform into the air space above the fluid .
The changes in depression of freezing point are small , but in every case the results are comparable and concordant .
In the table ( Table YI ) the percentages of chloroform are given by weight , and the figures are corrected to allow for the degree of supercooling .

Moore and Dr. H. E. Boaf .
[ Oct. 19 , chloroform in water or saline ; ( 2 ) that the lowering of freezing point in the case of serum goes on increasing far beyond the point of maximum solubility of chloroform in water or saline , but that the increased lowering is not strictly proportional to the extra amount of chloroform added , but progressively less ; and ( 3 ) above 2 per cent , further addition of chloroform has no more effect upon the freezing point .
The latter fact points to a removal of the chloroform by the proteid corresponding to the steep rise in the vapour-pressure curves at I high concentrations .
E. Changes in Electrical Conductivity in Saline and Serum produced by the addition of Chloroform .
The electrical conductivities were determined by the method of Kohlrausch , at the temperatures of 0 ' , 15 ' , and 40 ' C. In the case of saline ( 075 per cent. ) and different samples of serum , both before and after addition of definite weighed amounts of chloroform .
In the case of the saline the amount of chloroform added was 06 per cent , by weight , and in the case of serum amounts of 0*6 , 1 , 2 , and 3 per cent , by weight were added in successive experiments .
On account of variations in the different samples of serum there are considerable fluctuations in the results , but certain facts are observable .
In Table YII the alterations in the value of K ( the specific conductivity , multiplied by 103 ) are shown , which result from the addition of the amounts by weight of chloroform shown at the head of each column .
It is noticeable that the conductivity is reduced without exception in all cases where chloroform is added to normal saline , due to a diminution of the ionisation of the sodium chloride by the chloroform and alteration of ionic velocity .
But when chloroform is added to serum there is , in many cases , an actual increase in conductivity , and in other cases the diminution is less than occurs with the corresponding amount of chloroform added to normal saline .
This indicates that there is a tendency for inorganic salts to be set free from the proteid and add to the conductivity .
This is only seen as an actual increase where it outbalances the action above mentioned of the chloroform in reducing conductivity in pure saline solution .
The table shows that the amount of increase in conductivity varies with the temperature and the amount of chloroform added .
Thus at 0 ' C. the diminution in conductivity is the same in saline and serum for 06 per cent , of chloroform , but when 1 per cent , of chloroform has been added , the diminution becomes converted into an increase ; again , at higher percentages , a diminution is seen , as if all the electrolyte possible had been detached from the proteid at the lower concentrations , and the diminution was now that due to the effect of the additional chloroform upon the saline in solution ( fig. 4 ) .

] On certain Properties of Solutions of , etc. 101 Taking the experiments as a whole , there is evidence of two opposing factors partially masking each other , the first being due to a setting free of electrolyte from the proteid by the added chloroform increasing the conductivity , and the second the well-known action of a non-electrolyte in diminishing the conductivity , which is seen clearly in the case of the pure saline plus chloroform .
Summary and Conclusions .
The experiments recorded in the present communication support the conclusion drawn in our previous paper that anaesthetics form unstable compounds or aggregates with the proteids of the tissue cells , and that anaesthesia is due to a paralysis of the chemical activities of the protoplasm as a result of the formation of such aggregations .
The comparative experiments with ethereal extracts demonstrate that the action is upon the cell proteids and not upon the lipoids .
The compounds or aggregations so formed are unstable , and remained formed only so long as the pressure of the anaesthetic in the blood is maintained .
The results of our experiments may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The solubility of all anaesthetics experimented with is higher in serum than in water .
( 2 ) At a certain concentration , definite for each anaesthetic , there occurs opalescence and commencing precipitation of proteid .
( 3 ) At equal concentration of chloroform in water or saline on the one hand , and serum , haemoglobin , or the tissues ( brain , heart , muscle , and liver ) on the other , the vapour-pressure is always higher in the former than in the latter .
( 4 ) The curve connecting vapour-pressure and concentration is , in the case of water and saline , a straight line ; while in the case of serum , haemoglobin , and the tissue proteids it is a curve showing association , especially at the higher concentrations .
( 5 ) Comparative determinations of vapour-pressure and concentration , in serum and brain tissue and in ethereal extracts of these equal in concentration of lipoid , show that the proteid of the tissue combines with the anaesthetic .
( 6 ) Determinations of the effects of addition of chloroform upon the lowering of freezing point confirm the results obtained by the vapour-pressure and solubility determinations .
( 7 ) Determinations of the changes in electrical conductivity caused by addition of chloroform indicate that accompanying the combination of the anaesthetic with the proteid there takes place a splitting off of electrolytes .

[ Oct. 9 , ( 8 ) When the lipoids , extracted from serum or tissues by ether are made up into an emulsion with normal saline , many of the lipoids take the form of bi-concave discs .
( 9 ) The lipoid emulsions are very permanent , but separate on the addition of anaesthetics or neutral salts , in similar fashion to colloidal solutions .

) The results of observations previously made in the Bio-chemical Laboratory of the University of Liverpool have shown that free hydrochloric acid is absent from the gastric contents , or greatly reduced , in nearly all cases of malignant disease , no matter where the malignant growth happens to be situated .
In the paper describing these observations it was pointed out that the most probable cause of this absence of the free hydrochloric acid was an increased alkalinity of the blood-plasma , as a result of which the hydrogen ion concentration in the plasma was so far reduced that the oxyntic cells were no longer able to separate an acid secretion from it.* It seemed to us , therefore , desirable to test the effects of alterations in the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions respectively , upon the growth and cell division in some organism in which cell division was proceeding rapidly , and which could be easily subjected directly to changes in acidity or alkalinity of the medium in which it was living .
We selected for this purpose the fertilised eggs of a species of sea-urchin { Echinus esculentus ) , because at the season of the year at which our experiments were carried out ( April , 1905 ) the ripe eggs can readily be obtained from the gonads of the female , and be fertilised by mixing with the sperm similarly obtained from a ripe male .
