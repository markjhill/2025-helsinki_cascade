radius coated with uranium oxide placed inside a metal coated bell-jar of 6'5-cm .
radius for containing the gases , the ball being connected to an electrometer and the bell-jar raised to a potential of 800 volts , he found the following values for the total ionisation:\#151 ; Air = 100 , hydrogen 95 , oxygen 106 , carbonic acid 96 , coal gas 111 , hydrochloric acid gas 102 , ammonia 101 .
An investigation of the conductivity of gases under the action of Becquerel rays was next made by the Hon. R. J. Strutt , ^ using , among other agents , the easily-absorbable a-rays from barium radium carbonate , polonium , and a uranium preparation .

Total Ionisation of Gases by the a-Rays of Uranium .
207 Experimental Methods .
Uranium oxide , U3O8 , was selected as a source of a-rays for several reasons .

of air over a film of 0-0012 gramme per square centimetre is produced by the a-particles* ; the range of its a-particle was believed to be short , which meant smaller total voltages would be required to obtain a saturation current ; and finally uranium has no emanation , the cause of experimental difficulties with radium .
Apparatus.\#151 ; The ionisation vessels were two similar cylindrical brass vessels , one of which is drawn to scale in fig. 1 .

The brass top A was fastened by means of screws , an indiarubber washer made a gas-tight joint .
The disc electrode E , attached to a rod passing through the guard ring insulator I of vulcanite , could be placed at a desired distance from the disc D which was coated with 0'0067 gramme per square centimetre of the dark-green oxide , U3O8 .
The joints in I were made gas-tight with shellac .

P 2 Mr. T. H. Laby .
The Total Ionisation of [ Feb. 28 , In order that the results obtained should be , as far as possible , independent of the electrometer , a null method for measuring the total ionisation was at first tried .
The electrode E of the standard air vessel C , and the similar electrode E ' of a vessel C ' containing the gas under examination were connected to the Dolezalek electrometer .
One vessel was connected to + 400 volts , the other to \#151 ; 400 volts , and the excess ( or defect ) of the current from C ' over that from the standard C was measured .
But a passable concordance in successive observations ( with the conditions unchanged ) was not obtainable either when the rate of deflection of the electrometer was observed or when the electrometer was allowed to charge up for a definite time , or when a Wilson tilted electroscope was substituted for the electrometer .
The cause of this want of concordance in the observations could not be found , and appeared not to be due to imperfect shielding , or the keys , etc. The electroscope was quite free from irregularities when directly tested .
The null method was consequently abandoned , and the apparatus was arranged as shown in fig. 2 .
TO PUMP Fig. 2 .
The ionisation vessels ( already described ) were used and could be alternately connected to the Wilson electroscope F. The vapour or gas , generated in G , entered the vessel C ' through T and passed out through T ' , 1907 .

which was connected with a large glass vessel Y , to a mercury-pressure gauge , and to a pump .
For adjusting the pressure in C ' there were clips at 1/ and L. B represents a set of 500 ( in some experiments 900 ) small lead accumulators with the positive terminal earthed .
The wires W , W ' for connecting the electrodes E and E ' to the mercury cup M attached to the gold leaf of the electroscope F were made as short as possible , and passed through brass tubes S , S ' connected to earth .
Method of using Electroscope.\#151 ; With the leaf of the electroscope to earth , a small adjustment , if necessary , of the potential of the charged plate was made by means of the potential wire P till the leaf was exactly at the zero of the reading microscope scale .
To determine the amount of ionisation in either of the vessels , the electrode E of the vessel was connected to the gold leaf through the mercury cup M , and the time taken between when the connection to earth of the mercury cup was broken and when the leaf ( rapidly ) passed the last division of the scale .
The constancy of the sensitiveness of the electroscope was checked by means of the standard vessel , which , being undisturbed , gave a constant current .

With air in the vessel C ' , E ' was connected to the electroscope and the ionisation measured .
Then , when a gas was under examination , it was passed for an hour or more through C ' to completely displace the air from it ; when a vapour was under examination , the vessel C ' was exhausted to a pressure of a few centimetres of mercury , and the vapour from the volatile liquid was boiled through .
The pressure in the vessel was kept constant by means of the clips at L and L and the large exhausted glass globe .
With the electrode , the U3O8 , and the voltage undisturbed , the ionisation in the gas or vapour was determined .
The gas was swept out by air and the ionisation again measured .
.The ratio of the ionisation of the gas to the mean of the two air values gave the relative ionisation .
Range of the a-Particle from Uranium .

Since a high E.M.F. is necessary in order to obtain a saturation current , it is desirable to have this distance as small as complete absorption will allow .
The thickness of the air ionised by the uranium oxide disc was actually found by slightly indirect method .
With the plates at a fixed distance apart , the ionisation with air between them was observed at several pressures .

of air .
That this is sufficient is confirmed by Prof. Brag * who has recently found that the range of the a-particle of uranium is very nearly equal to that of the a-particle of radium , i.e.,3'5 cm.f While these curves show the minimum distance allowable between the plates , a consideration of the distribution of the ionisation above the layer of uranium oxide used shows that the range could not be found with any accuracy from them .
Saturation Voltage .
As it is necessary in determining the total ionisation to use a saturation current , the voltage per centimetre giving this had to be known .
For air , nitrous oxide , and sulphur dioxide , the current-voltage per centimetre curves are given in curves 4 and 5 , and portions of similar curves for NH3 , ( C2H5)20 , C5H12 , C2H5CI and CH3.CHO .
The dotted portion of the curve for air between 215 and 260 volts per centimetre was obtained in a separate experiment to the rest of the curve .
While 130 volts per centimetre give a saturation current in air , the curve for sulphur dioxide shows that this gas is not saturated with 600 volts per centimetre .
The tables on p. 212 state the values from which the curves have been drawn .

The Total Ionisation of [ Feb. 28 , The carbon dioxide was from a cylinder .
Sulphur dioxide from the liquefied gas in a glass syphon was passed through a long drying tube of sulphuric acid into the ionisation chamber which had been previously filled with dry air , in order to avoid fumes of sulphurous acid .
The acetylene obtained from calcium carbide and water was dried with sulphuric acid .
The methyl bromide , ethyl chloride , ethyl ether , pentane , and aldehyde were the preparations of Kahlbaum , and were fractionally distilled through the ionisation vessel , which had been exhausted to a low pressure ( about 10 cm .
) before the vapours were admitted .
In this way the liquids were purified and the air intially present in the ionisation vessel removed .
The presence of 4 per cent , of air as impurity in pentane vapour would be necessary to affect the amount of ionisation to 1 per cent. The ionisation of each gas , as already mentioned , was found by determining the total ionisation , first with air in the vessel , then with the gas in it , , then in nearly all cases with air again .
Thus direct comparisons with air were made .

215 It is necessary to consider the magnitude of two possible corrections to the above results : the one is the correction arising from the fact that some of the a-particles from the edge of the uranium disc strike the walls of the vessel and their ionising power is only partly spent in the gas , the other is the ionisation due to / 3- and 7-rays from the uranium .
When the pressure of a gas in the ionisation vessel was such that its effective stopping power was the same as that of the air with which it was compared , then it can be said from the investigations of Prof. Brag and Mr. Kleeman that the range and velocity of all the a-particles , including the ones which strike the sides of the vessel , were unchanged when the gas in the vessel was replaced by air and the ionisations found could be strictly compared .
The effective stopping powers , however , of the gases were not in all cases the same as that of air at atmospheric pressure , as is shown below .

With nitrous oxide ( stopping power 1*46 ) at atmospheric pressure in the ionisation vessel , some of the a-particles from the edge of the uranium disc with paths directed towards the sides would spend more of their ionising energy in this gas than they would spend when the vessel contained air .
Ihe proportion of these a-particles to the whole number must be small from the evidence of the experiments given on p. 216 , in which the pressure of the gas was varied within certain limits , and thus also the effective stopping power , and yet no certain change in the ionisation was observed .
From these experiments it is seen that the correction under consideration is so small that it only certainly appears in the case where the stopping power was doubled ( the second of the air results on p. 216 ) .
In the total ionisation experiments , only in the case of N2O and CO2 was the effective Mr. T. H. Laby .

For such a difference of stopping power the correction would be , from the analogy of the first air results above , not more than 07 per cent. , or of the same magnitude as the experimental error of a determination of ionisation .
In the case of the other gases the correction was smaller .
The ratio of the ionisation in a layer of air 4 cm .
thick due to the / 3-rays to the ionisation due to the a-rays from the U3O8 disc used may be found thus .
The intensity I of the / 3-rays from a layer of uranium oxide , of thickness d , is given by the relation I = I0(l-e-M ) , where I0 is the intensity of the / 3-rays from a very thick layer , and A , divided by the density of the uranium oxide is 6'3 .
This gives for the layer of uranium oxide of 0-0067 gramme per square centimetre used in the experiments of this paper I = 0-04110 .
Now Rutherford and Grier* determined the relative amount of ionisation produced in a slab of air 5-7 cm .

For this layer I = 0-007910 .
Thus the / 3-rays from the thicker layer have 5"2 times the intensity of those from the thinner layer .
By plotting the values found by Rutherford and McClungf for the saturation current from a varying thickness of uranium oxide , it is found that the ionisation due to the a-rays of the * 'Phil .

Thus 5.9 x 0'0074 \#151 ; -\#151 ; \#151 ; ----------= 0-0124 of the ionisation produced by the thicker layer O 1 ( 0-0067 gin./ cm.2)is due to / 3-rays .
And since the relative ionisations produced by / 3-rays in different gases are very similar to those of the a-rays , this 1*2 per cent , of / 3-ionisation gives rise to a negligibly small correction .
The 7-rays produce less ionisation than the / 3 , so need not be considered .
Comparison of Ionisations due to a- Uranium and Radium Rays .
Since this research was concluded , Prof. Brag has published* the results of his work " On the Ionisation of Various Gases by the a-Particles of Radium .
" He found the total relative ionisation by a method essentially different to the one used by the writer .
It is based on the following considerations .
When the ionisations in air , produced in a shallow ( 3 mm. deep ) horizontal chamber by the approximately vertical rays obtained when a grid of narrow vertical tubes is placed over radium bromide , are plotted against distances from the radium film , a curve of this kind is obtained .
Prof. Brag shows that changing the pressure , temperature , or gas alters the curve so that " the ordinates are multiplied by some factor , and all the abscissae divided by the same factor , " so that the product R x I of the coordinates of a point such as P ( where the top portion of the RaA curve meets the side of the RaC curve\#151 ; a point readily found ) is proportional to the area of ABPCD , i.e. , to the total ionisation produced by the RaC .
Prof. Brag has found the value of R.I for a number of gases .
This method seems to be more complicated , and to be based on more assumptions * ' Trans. Roy .

It is evident from the table that the relative total ionisation is independent of the range and initial velocity of the a-particles producing it , for the EaC a-particle has probably double the range of the uranium one .
The agreement of the results of two such different methods of measurement as those of Prof. Brag and the writer is of interest .
The Density Bide .
When the details of the Hon. E. J. Strutt 's experiments are considered , it appears that his conductivity of a gas divided by its stopping power gives approximately the total ionisation for that gas .
As he found the conductivity of a gas was proportional to the density , we have If \#151 ; p/ s , where If is the total relative ionisation , p the density , and s the stopping power of the gas .
On comparing the total ionisation calculated in this way with the ionisation found in the writer 's experiments , there is seen to be little agreement .
Since the total ionisation If is the ionisation in a slab of given area of the gas under consideration of thickness equal to the range E of the a-particle in that gas , then the ionisation per unit volume I is If .

Kleeman has suggested it is an additive atomic property , and Brag that it is approximately proportional to the volume of the molecule ionised .
