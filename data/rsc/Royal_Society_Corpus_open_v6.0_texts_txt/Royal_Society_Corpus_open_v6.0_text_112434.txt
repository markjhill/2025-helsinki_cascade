( Abstract .
) From four species of Touraco , or Plantain-eater , the author has extracted a remarkable red pigment .
It occurs in about fifteen of the primary and secondary pinion feathers of the birds in question , and may be extracted by a dilute alkaline solution , and reprecipitated without change by an acid .
It is distinguished from all other natural pigments yet isolated , by the presence of 59 per cent. of copper , which cannot be removed without the destruction of the colouring-matter itself .
The author proposes the name turacine for this pigment .
The spectrum of turacine shows two black absorption-bands , similar to those of scarlet cruorine ; turacine , however , differs from cruorine in many particulars .
It exhibits great constancy of composition , even when derived from different genera and species of Plantain-eater ; as , for example , the Musophaga violacea , the Corythaix albo-cristata , and the C. porphyreolopha .
