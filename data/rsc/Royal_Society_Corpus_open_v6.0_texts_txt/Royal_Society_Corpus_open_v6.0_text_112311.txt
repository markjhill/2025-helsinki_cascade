( Abstract .
) The electromotive force of a thermo-electric couple is a function of the nature of the metals of which it is composed , and of the temperatures of the junctions .
It is expressed in this paper by [ Ex y]T where x and y are names of metals , and T and t are temperatures .
In this notation Becquerel 's two laws become a , b]t , =[a , 6-[a , b ] ; ... .
( I. ) and ( a , c)T= [ a , ]T+ [ , c]T ... ... ( II .
) From ( I. ) we learn that the electromotive force of a couple may be expressed as the difference of two quantities which are functions of the temperature and of the nature of the circuit , or [ , Y]O=[ , y]T--[l Y ] ... . .
( II .
) From ( II .
) we learn that any number of metals with their ends at the same temperature may be introduced without effect , or [ a , b]t+[b , c]t=[a , C]t ... . .
( IV .
) This equation will always be true if [ L Y ] t= [ t[y ] ... ... .
( V. ) whence we may write ( III .
) [ Iy t[X ?
]t[y]t[T + [ y3 T ; or , in other words , the electromotive force of a couple may be considered as the difference of the electromotive force of two metals , each of which is found by subtracting its tension at the higher temperature from that of the lower one .
Everything therefore depends on a knowledge of the value of what may be called the electric tension of each metal at the various temperatures .
This for every metal is a function of temperature , and may be called , in the language of the paper , a function of the nature ( or name ) of the metal and the temperature .
( The nature of the metal may be altered otherwise than chemically .
) If the temperature of the metal vary in any way throughout its length , then if it be homogeneous , the electromotive force will depend only on the temperatures of its extremities .
In a circuit of one metal , the author considers that at the junction of the ends there may be a real discontinuity of temperature while there is a continuity of electric current .
He regards the explanation of the effect by the stratum of air between the unequally heated ends to be unsatisfactory .
Mercury , as is known , will not produce thermo-curyents in this way .
The author considers that the texture , &amp;c. , as well as the chemical nature of the substance , influences the value of the thermo-electric function .
He also shows the possibility of the thermo-electric inversions first discovered by Professor Cumming .
