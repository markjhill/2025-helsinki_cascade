] The author proposes the employment of threads of glass in the construction of torsion-balances , in place of the silver wire , used by Coulomb for the measurement of minute electric or magnetic forces .
He describes a galvanometer of his invention , acting upon this principle , the intensity of the galvanic current being measured by the torsion of a slender filament of glass , to the lower end of which a magnetized needle is fixed at right angles .
He also applies the same power to the improvement of the sensibility of the common balance for weighing minute bodies , by affixing to the beam a long glass thread horizontally in the axis of suspension , by the torsion of which , when the balance has been brought nearly to a level , the more accurate adjustments are to be effected .
On the whole he considers that glass , from its perfect elasticity , possesses decided advantages over metallic wires , for the construction of instruments acting on the principle of torsion .
