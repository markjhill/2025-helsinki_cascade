TIHE theorems relative to finite differences , given by M. LAGRANGE in the Berlin Memoirs for 1772 , have much engaged the attention of mathematicians .
M. LAPLACE has been particularly successful in his investigations respecting them ; yet an important difficulty remained , to endeavour to surmount which is the principal object of this Paper .
The theorems alluded to may be thus stated .
Let u represent any function of x. Let x+ h , x+ 2h , x+31h , &amp;c. be successive values of x , and u , u , u &amp;c. cor3 responding successive values of u. Let A"u represent the first term of the nth order of differences of the quantities u , u , u &amp;c. And let also S"u represent the first term of a series of quantities , of which the first term of the nth order of differences is u. Then ( e representing the series 1 +I +2 -+ -- , &amp; C.).--b -b --n i. A"u=(eX ) " 2 .
Su-(e -- ) provided that 3 c. be sd in the expansion of ( e i , - ) A , a &amp;c. be substituted for 1 i1 ( - ) ( +T ) ) &amp;c. ; and provided that in the expansion of -1-b _l n-I n--i ( ) fl ) n , S. U x , &amp;c. be substituted for ( j ) , 23 ( 4 ) -+ ) &amp;c. and 4 , u , &amp;c. be substituted for ( i ( 4 ) &amp;c. These theorems , which M. LAGRANGE had not demonstrated except by induction , have since been accurately investigated in different ways by M. LAPLACE , * and also by M. ARBOGASTt .
The expanded formula for S " u , or , more accurately speaking , the natural series for St u is of the form &amp; 4 *n / ?$ .
n ?
t3 *r-n IU** _Lfl.n + nfl ... .-fl.t_ +v x z-hh+p4-h + &amp;c. The coefficients w5 , 3 , y , &amp;c. are readily obtained by equations of relation , which were first given by LAGRANGE .
But to complete the solution it is obviously necessary to -obtain the law of progression , and be able to ascertain any coefficient independent of the preceding ones .
This has not hitherto been done , as far as I know , except in the case of n=1 .
M. LAPLACE has given a very ingenious investigation for that case.t This has been copied with just encomiums by M. LACROIX , ?
who does not mention that any one had accomplished it for any other value of n. In this Paper the general term is given for any value of n , the law of which is remarkably simple .
A particular formula , remarkably simple as to its law , is also given for the case of fn= , from which that of LAPLACE may be deduced .
In the case of na=i and h-=i the formula for Su is of the form a fl. ux + i3u + -y , +C+ &amp;c. and exhibits the sum of a series of which u any function of x is the general term .
For which purpose it was first given by EULER in the VIth Vol. Corn .
Petropol .
and afterwards demonstrated in the VIIItl Vol. of the same work .
It has been differently investigated since by several authors.* But LAPLACE appears to have been the first who gave a general term for the coefficients .
EULER seems to have sought it in vain , for he says " Ipsa series " coefficientum a , A , &amp;c. ita est comparata ut vix credam " pro ea terminum generalem posse exhiberi .
" As preparatory to the main object of this enquiry it has been thought proper to give investigations of the above two theorems , which will probably be found as simple as any that have appeared .
It has also been found necessary , for avoiding very complex formula , to adopt a peculiar .
notation , which requires some explanation .
Notation .
The first term of the nth order of differences of the series Om , im , 2m &amp;c. is denoted by o " x is denoted by.l2.3.4t n is denoted by I,2.3..4 1 ^ ?

If the quantity ( l ) ( )v &amp;c. or ( I : ; .p)t(z..q),.tI.v &amp; ( l Z_p)(i.2..q &gt; 1.z ... V &amp; C. has various values arising from different values of p , q , t , v9 &amp;c. then the sum of them all is denoted byf(i)t ( i ) &amp;c. Theorem I. Let u be a function of x and x+h , -+2h , --x+nh successive values of x. Then an u= ( ex -i ) if after 23 the expansion of this latter quantity , - , &amp;c. be substituted for ( -i ) , ( i ) , &amp;c. respectively .
Demonstration .
Let the successive values of u be represented by u , u , u , ... u , u. Then by TAYLOR'S theorem , 23n( i ) n3 ji =u + 4f ih + n2h +h 3--i h3+ &amp;c. =u+ e --i , substituting as above-mentioned .

This change does not affect the numerical coefficients , which are evidently the same as those of ( eh^_- ) " , and because ( e6--1)=h ( 1 3 + , &amp; .

Theorem IV .
Let u be a function of x and x+h , x+2h , &amp; cM successive values of x , as before , then Su=-(eT --i ) if after expansion ( ) , ( &amp;c. are changed into fl. u " , fl.n ' ux &amp;c. and ( 4 , ) ' ( ) , 3 &amp; C. 3 into &amp;c. Demonstration .

Then , by taking the successive fluxions of equation ( O ) and substituting in equation( 1 ) , we have EULER uses a similar assumption in ihis iestistigaton of the slun of a series from its general term , p. 15 , Tom. VIII .

For taking m successively i , o , 3 , &amp;c. and dividing by , l , h , 3 , 8c .
we obtain the equations ( 3 ) .

By the converse of that method we are enabled , either from the general coefficient , or from the equations of relation , to arrive at the primitive function .
The converse , therefore , applies to the summation of series , to the investigation of the general term of a recurring series , and to several other important purposes .
It is evident , that it applies to finding the general term of a recurring series , because from the given scale of relation , the primitive function can be deduced , and from the primitive function , the general coefficient may be determined .
The same method extends to the reduction of any function of x , y , z , &amp;c. and therefore the converse to finding the general term of double , triple , &amp;c. recurring series .
I had not considered the converse of the method of reduction of analytical fulnctions afforded by my theorems for finding fluxions per saltum , till I had seen M.A RBGAs T'S ingenious work , entitled , e Du Calcul des Derivations .
" As those theorems furnish every thing that is given in the former part of his treatise , and likewise admit of more extensive application ; so also the converse of them serve for deducing , with greater facility , every thing respecting recurring series , &amp;c. contained in the same Treatise .
The important uses to be derived from finding fluxions per saltum in the reduction of analytical functions , and from the converse , induced me to draw up a particular work on that subject .
Its publication has hitherto been delayed by my unwillingness to offer a fiuxional notation different from either that of NEWTO N or LE BNITZ , each of which is very inconvenient as far as regards the application of the theorems for finding fluxions per salumn .

Previously to the investigation of the numerical coefficient of the general m+1 term , it will be convenient to premise the following lemmas .
Lemma I. Let n represent any affirmative integral number , and m any other affirmative integral number not greater than n. Then f(p )t ( 1 ) ( , )w &amp;c.

The case of the above theorem , when n-= , has , on account of its importance , been a particular object of investigation among mathematicians .
Although the formula in the first corollary is , as to its formation and law of progression , very simple , yet one more simple may be readily obtained by the joint application of a transformation given by M. LAPLACE in his m , thod , and of the first lemma above given ; which formula and its investigation are here subjoined .
Thi 's and the al)ove general formule ( n being any number ) , as well as the formula of LAPLACE ( n being 1 ) , do not enable us to compute the successive coefficients so readily as from the equations of relation .
But this circumstance , it is imagined , will not render what has been here done less worthy of the notice of mathematicians .
Their researches for a general term in the case of n=i , sufficiently show of what importance the enquiry has been considered .
