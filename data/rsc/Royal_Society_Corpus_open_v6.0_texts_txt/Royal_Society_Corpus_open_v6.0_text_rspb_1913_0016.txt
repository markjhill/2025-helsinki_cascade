) To promote drop-measuring in serological and bacteriological work , etc. , the writer has devised a simple system of producing uniform pipettes , clean and sterile , which deliver uniform drops of any required size from \#163 ; c.c. down to 1/ 200 c.c. or less , and has devised also simple forms of constant-pressure apparatus for use with the pipettes .
The fundamental principle of his method rests on the fact that the size of a drop of a given liquid yielded by a clean pipette is determined by the outer circumference of the pipette at the level where the contact-edge of the drop clings round the glass\#151 ; due allowance being made for the rate at which the drop is detached and the temperature .
The pipettes , freshly drawn out from glass tubing in a Bunsen flame to a nearly cylindrical capillary form , are gauged in a wire gauge and cut off at the required sizes .
The gauges used are such as the Starrett Morse Drill and Wire Gauge , which has holes ranging in diameter from 5'79 mm. down to 034 mm. Tubes larger than these sizes may conveniently be gauged by the Columbia vernier slide gauge .
Capillary tubes less than 034 mm. may be gauged in a wire drawplate .
In gauging , the capillary tube is pushed gently down into the particular gauge hole required and is then cut off\#151 ; preferably at the upper surface of the plate , so that the dropping-point shall not come into contact with any trace of greasy matter which may remain on the cleaned gauge plate .
To ascertain the size of drop yielded by such a dropping-point an adjustable constant-pressure apparatus was devised .
This ( fig. 1 ) consists of a straight tube of 3 to 4 mm. internal diameter and of such a length , e.g. 50 or 60 cm .
, that the free air space within shall be amply greater than the capacity of the pipette employed .
The tube is carefully cleaned , washed finally with distilled water , and dried with grease-free cotton wool drawn through on a thread .
The ends are opened out slightly funnel-shaped to facilitate the ramming in of an inch or so of pure cotton wool , which is required to retard An Apparatus for Liquid Measurement by Lh'ops .

long , which is introduced to act as a plunger .
The tube is arranged as shown in the figure .
The right-hand end is joined by a short rubber tube to the upper end of a pipette , which is supported by a clamp , and the left-hand end , attached to a screw-clamp , can be moved up or down the tall stem of a retort stand .
The stem of the pipette has an internal diameter of 1 mm. or so , and the lower of its two calibration marks is 1 or 2 cm .
below the bulb .
Then 1 or 2 cm .
below this the pipette is joined by a short piece of cleaned bicycle valve-tubing to the upper end of the capillary dropping nozzle .
For special work the junction may be made by means of a sleeve of good cork or by grinding or fusing the nozzle on to the pipette point .
The liquid friction in a small dropping nozzle ought to be such that the head of mercury employed may be great enough to render negligible the loss of 2 or 3 cm .
head of water as the pipette empties .
The acceleration of the falling mercury down the well-throttled sloped tube is negligible .
To carry out a dropping experiment the mercury is first brought to the Mr. R. Donald .

of the end .
The vessel of liquid is raised to cover the end of the nozzle .
The left-hand end of the mercury tube is then depressed till the pipette is nearly full .
Next it is gently raised until the upper meniscus of the liquid rests at the upper calibration mark .
Finally the vessel of liquid is lowered .
Now the end of the mercury tube is raised till the drops fall at the required standard rate , say one per second .
The height required for the dropping-point in use is marked by a sliding ring .
Then the pipette is refilled , the mercury tube is at once elevated to the required point , and the drop-count at the uniform standard rate is observed .
If necessary , the mercury tube may be slightly lowered at the last drop to allow estimation of the fraction of a drop .
The drop-counts for distilled water thus found are given in the following table .
The fourth column contains the quotient drop-weight in mgrm./ diam. in mm. , e.g. for Morse gauge 80 , 1000/ 131/ 0-340 = 22'45 .
These quotients are seen to form a fairly uniformly falling curve as the dropping-point increases in size .

Such rates can be easily and reliably secured by the use of a hand mercury-plunger tube\#151 ; a miniature form of the mercury tube described above .
The narrow limits of drop-rate required for large drops , e.g. of 1/ 5 to 1/ 4 c.c. in the Wassermann test , may be secured by the use of the arrangement shown in fig. 2 .

tube , may be fitted on by a ferrule of washed rubber tubing or of good cork .
A dropping-point to give watery drops of \ c.c. may be formed of tubing 14 J mm. external diameter .
The dropper is held in a stand at a height convenient to allow a rack of test-tubes to be slid under the dropping-point .
The drop-rate may be regulated as desired by fitting inside the dropping-tube , and within forceps-reach of the orifice , a throttle made of suitably drawn out capillary tube .
The author has found the apparatus efficient in the following applications:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Comparison of surface-tension of liquids , in quantity as little as | c.c. , e.g. in testing the value of the meiostagmin reaction in syphilis .
( 2 ) As the drop yielded by one pipette differs by not more than a fraction of 1 per cent , from the drop similarly yielded by another pipette similarly gauged in the same hole , the method may be used , with successive fresh pipettes , for rapidly and accurately measuring off small quantities of any liquid , from 0'25 c.c. to , say , 0'004 c.c. of watery liquids of high surface tension , or even smaller quantities of liquids of low surface tension , for instance , in:\#151 ; ( a ) Measurements of various small quantities , in e.g. Wassermann reaction , micro-Wassermann reaction , and other complement-fixation tests ; Widal reaction ; alkalimetry , acidimetry , and other volumetric tests ; testing cultures and disinfectants ; and in pharmacy .
