( Abstract .
) In this communication a " general magic square " is defined as I consisting of ri2 numbers arranged in a square in such wise that each row , column , and diagonal contains a partition of the same number .
Such squares can be added together , by addition of corresponding j numbers , without losing the magic property , and we can thus speak *of a linear function of squares of the same order , the coefficients being integers .
The squares can , in fact , be regarded as numerical magnitudes , and can be taken as the elements of a linear algebra .
Since , moreover , arithmetical addition can be made to depend upon algebraical multiplication , the properties of the magnitudes can be investigated by means of a non-linear algebra .
The properties of a magic square can be exhibited by means of a system of homogeneous linear diophantine equations , so that it immediately follows that there is syzygetic theory of such formations .
The method of procedure is set forth and worked out in detail for the third order .
In Section 10 the general question of enumeration associated with a given sum is considered , and some particular results obtained .
The methods are applicable not only to general magic squares as herein defined , but to all cases of forms in " Arithmetic of Position , " which retain their properties after addition of corresponding elements , i
