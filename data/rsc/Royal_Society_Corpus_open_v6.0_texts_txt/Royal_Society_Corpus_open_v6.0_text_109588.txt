Continuation of an Account of the Changes that have happened in the relative Situation of double Stars .

] In the former part of this paper , Dr. Herschel mentioned the changes he had noticed in the situation of six double stars ; and in investigating the causes of those changes , he declared that he had recourse to the most authentic observations he could find of their motions in right ascensions and polar distance , especially in the instance of the double star Castor : but finding in the tables which have been lately published in the last volume of the Greenwich Observations , which give the proper motions of thirty-six stars , that ( especially in the instance of the above-named star , ) the motions are somewhat different from those he assigned to them in his former communication , he now undertakes to review the arguments he there used , in order to ascertain what will be the result of these new motions .
As this investigation , which forms the first part of the present paper , has a continual reference to the contents of the preceding one , it will be in vain to attempt an abridgement , which could not be rendered intelligible within our usual limits .
Nor can we enter here into a detail of the sequel of Dr. Herschel 's observations on the changes in the situation of a great number of additional double stars ; this second part of the paper , in which they are fully detailed , being itself a minute of his proceedings , in which he is at particular pains to point out that these changes of situation are not the effect of parallax .
