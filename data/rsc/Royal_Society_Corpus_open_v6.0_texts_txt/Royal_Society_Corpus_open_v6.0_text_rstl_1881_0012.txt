It lias long been clear that the means placed at our disposal by photography for studying the solar spectrum enable us to construct maps of the region more refrangible than bon a much larger scale than those hitherto employed .
MR. J. NORMAN LOCKYER ON SPECTRUM-ANALYSIS ready and unfailing means of detecting cyclical changes , maps of the spectrum on a large scale must be constructed .
By means of the photographic method described in the third Memoir of this series , * and illustrated by its application to the mapping of the spectra of barium , calcium and strontium in the fourth , 11 commenced in the year 1875 a new map of the solar spectrum on four times the scale of Angstrom 's " Spectre Normal .
" Specimens of this map in its earlier stages were laid before the Society , with a preliminary note , in November of that year4 After the presentation of this preliminary note , the construction of the map was carried on , until on January 10 , 1877 , I submitted to the Royal Society a complete Memoir on the first part completed ( W.L. 390-400 millionths millim. ) with comparisons of the lines of 25 metals and complete tables , both of the solar and metallic lines .
While this Memoir was in the hands of the referees , I received from my friend Mr. L. M. Rutherfurd , of New York , a magnificent reflection grating , with 17,280 lines to the inch .
This enabled me to attack the question of wave-lengths in a much more satisfactory manner than I had been able to do in the first instance .
I therefore determined to reject my two years ' work and to do it all over again , in order , if possible , to introduce greater accuracy than the method of graphical interpolation , which I had been compelled to adopt in the first instance , had permitted .
I therefore applied to the Royal Society for leave to withdraw my paper , giving the above-stated reason for so doing , and at once received the required permission .
I now beg to re-submit to the Society that part of the withdrawn Memoir which has reference to the spectrum of the sun , independently of the spectra of the metals .
1 have determined to do this , not only because the reviewing of the wave-lengths of the metallic lines will take considerable time , but because during the time that the Memoir was in the hands of the Royal Society , and that which has elapsed since I received it back , I have very nearly completed the survey of the whole of the metals for this region , so that the comparison can now shortly be given for the whole of the metallic elements united for this part .
The section of the new normal spectrum comprises , as I have said , the Fraunhofer lines between W.L. 390-400 millionths millim. That portion of the map now in question is but a very small fraction of the whole region of the spectrum workable by photography , and my chief object in thus forwarding a fragment to the Royal Society is to point out the necessity for , and to invite co-operation in , a work of such magnitude , and to publish full details of the methods I have found most effective for the use of those who may take up the research .
For this reason , and because it may happen that a diffraction grating of the requisite brilliancy may not be forthcoming in all cases , I think it best to give a complete history of the production of the map , including that stage of graphical interpolation of wave-lengths which I have , by Mr. Rutherfurd s generosity , been able to supersede .

5G3 II .
REFRACTION MAP .
A. Instruments , \amp ; c. The same general arrangement of the spectroscope , electric lamp , and lenses figured in the third of the present series of memoirs has been employed for obtaining the photographs used in the construction of the refraction map .
The spectroscope used is one constructed on the model of Bunsen and Kirchiioff , by Schmidt and Hensch , of Berlin .
It is provided with a train of four flint glass prisms , viz. , three of 45 ' and one of 60 ' .
The prisms are levelled by Kirchhoff 's method , and adjusted as nearly as possible for the minimum deviation of the centre of the section being worked upon .
The camera employed is provided with a simple quartz lens of 5-feet focus .
The image of the spectrum formed by this lens falls on a sensitized glass plate , 1G'GX 5*8 centims. The dispersion obtained by this arrangement gives a photographic impression , in which the distance from G to K ( using Cornu 's nomenclature ) is about 11 centims. and from H to K about 1 '3 centims. The focus is first fixed approximately by viewing the image of the spectrum on the ground glass focussing screen by means of a positive eye piece , and the final adjustment is determined by a series of trial plates , using the solar spectrum when possible , or , in the absence of the sun , the spectrum of some metal such as cerium , which contains an immense number of lines throughout its entire length .
For fine definition it is requisite that if the beam of light which falls on the slit is not parallel , the light of the wave-length to be photographed should be brought to focus on it .
B. Method of Mapping .
a. Construction of Interpolation Curves .
The relative positions of all the most prominent lines visible in an enlargement of the photographs employed were first laid down on a strip of paper and then transferred to the horizontal line ruled at the base of some curve paper to furnish the ordinates .
The lines thus selected were referred to Cornu 's map , and their wave-lengths furnished the abscissae .
A wave-length scale was marked off on the vertical line , 4 millims. of which represented 1 millim. of Cornu 's map .
In the case of lines assigned to particular metals by former observers , a photograph of the metallic and solar spectra confronted was found useful in this work of identification .
The wave-lengths of the selected lines having been found , vertical lines are carried up from them , and horizontal lines marked across from the corresponding wave-lengths .
Where the vertical and horizontal lines meet , a series of points is obtained , through which is drawn a curve with as much regularity as possible .
The drawing of this curve at once reveals errors of identification or of wave-length in the map used .
4 d 2 Two curves ( A and B ) were employed in the construction of this section .
The first curve ( A ) was obtained from an enlargement on glass , and was available from about W.L. 386'0 to 399'98 millionths millim. The distance between K and H in this photograph is 3'5 centims. , and it was employed in preference to Rutherfurd 's print , because being in much better focus it was more easy , in consequence , to compare it with Cornu 's map .
The second curve ( B ) was constructed from Rutherfurd 's print , commencing at the point where the photograph referred to in the last paragraph fails ; this curve extends from W.L. 397'045 to W.L. 400'925 millionths millim. The wave-lengths are expressed in xth metres , and are given in two places of decimals .
This has been found necessary in order to distinguish between lines very close together .
The greatest error in the method of determining wave-lengths by graphical interpolation does not much exceed 2 millims. of the present scale millim. Cornu 's scale \#151 ; tyitoVooo i-n the actual wave-length .
I have not thought it necessary to reproduce the curves , but at the end of the paper I give two tables which will show the accuracy which it is possible to secure by the method above described .
The experience gained in constructing these curves ( I had already completed the region W.L. 390-440 millionths millim. before I received the grating , of which mention has already been made , from Mr. Rutherfurd ) leads to the following conclusions :\#151 ; .
I. The photograph of the solar spectrum employed should be on as large a scale as possible .
II .
The wave-length scale giving the abscissae should never be smaller than that used here .
III .
The photograph should be tested for distortion after enlargement .
IV .
The fundamental lines should be copied from the glass and not from an enlargement on paper .
/ 3 .
Construction of the The photograph used for the construction of the original refraction map is the original negative varnished and examined by a lens , or placed under a simple microscope of low magnifying power .
Considerable loss of detail and sharpness , leading to the obliteration of faint lines and the fusion together of close groups , has been found to be an invariable effect of photographic enlargements .
Thus in section W.L. 390\#151 ; 400 millionths millim. , there were mapped 333 lines in the refraction map as completed , whereas in the map of the same section exhibited to the Society in November , 1875 ' , which was drawn from an enlargement , there were but 221 lines .
I may add that the same holds good with metallic spectra .
Thus the spectrum of cerium as first mapped from enlargements contained several broad and nebulous bands which the negatives now in use resolve into groups of distinct but closely-packed lines .
IN CONNEXION WITH THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN .
The drawing of section W.L. 390-400 millionths millim. , exhibited with the preliminary note before referred to , was utilised for the first revision of the refraction map , for which purpose it was sufficiently good , although not good enough for copying finally , having been produced , as before mentioned , from a photographic enlargement of this region of the spectrum .
The method adopted in drawing the final refraction map was the following .
A millimetre scale of the required length having been drawn near the top of a sheet of paper prepared for the reception of the map , the fundamental lines were first entered in their correct positions in pencil upon it , and afterwards made of their correct widths and intensities , as seen in the standard photograph , by means of a drawing pen and Indian ink .
The width of these fundamental lines , where sufficiently great , was found by actual measurements on the curve .
The spaces between these fundamental lines being too large on the scale adopted for interpolating the intermediate lines accurately by eye , their places in the photograph were found and their corresponding wave-lengths determined by means of the curve .
The lines obtained in this manner by the aid of the interpolation curves were entered in the map in the same manner as before .
A skeleton map is thus obtained , in which no greater extent is left blank than 8 or 10 millims.\#151 ; a distance sufficiently small , considering the shape of the curve , to allow of the interpolation of the intermediate lines by eye .
The standard photograph , placed under a microscope of low magnifying power , was accordingly made to furnish the details for the remaining lines , which were interpolated with the greatest possible care , the interpolation position being checked from time to time by actual measurements of the wave-lengths of the selected lines on the curve .
In all cases the agreement was as close as could be desired .
In order to save the cost of engraving , a third map was constructed from the finally o revised copy on twelve times the scale of Angstrom 's .
This enlarged map was photographed down to the original scale adopted for this work , viz. , four times the scale of Angstrom .
For this enlarged map I was greatly indebted to Lance-Corporal Murray , R.E. , who made the drawing with great skill and care .
y. Determination of the Wave-lengths of the Solar Lines .
I have no means for determining wave-lengths absolutely , but the accurate measurement of the wave-length of the chief lines in the ultra-violet portion of the solar spectrum by Cornu rendered it unnecessary to attempt any absolute measurements for the construction of the present map .
The last degree of accuracy in the determination of wave-lengths is also , I think , having regard to the objects I have had in view , of less importance than good maps showing the details of the spectrum .
The idea was at first entertained of simply copying Cornu 's map on the scale now adopted , and interpolating new lines by eye ; but for two reasons this idea had to be abandoned .
In the first place , Cornu 's map , although by far the best ever published of this region of the spectrum , was found to be considerably wanting in detail when compared with the best negatives taken with the camera before described .
For example , the following lines are represented as single in Cornu 's map :\#151 ; Section 3900-4000 .

3 * In the next place , on the increased scale of the new map , the omission of lines by Cornu gives rise to blank spaces of too great an extent to enable one to interpolate new lines by eye with sufficient accuracy .
Cornu admits that he has attempted to give groups of lines a natural appearance ( when contrasted with photography ) , without special reference to the position of lines within the groups .
Slight errors thus introduced , although unimportant on Angstrom 's scale , would be considerably exaggerated on the scale now adopted .
The table of wave-lengths of the refraction map depends then ( l ) upon Cornu 's values as far as they are available , and ( 2 ) upon the interpolation curves for all the other lines . .
I have already stated the degree of accuracy which they may be expected to possess .

DIFFRACTION MAP .
A. Instruments , \amp ; c. The stand and collimator of the spectroscope of the Bunsen and Kirchhoff model already referred to were utilised , the train of prisms being removed and replaced by the grating .
This grating , which as I have already said I owe to the great kindness of Mr. Rutherfurd , contains 13,321 lines 25 millims. long ( 17,280 to the inch ) .
The ruled portion occupies the centre of a plate of glass 40 millims. square ; a deposit of silver is made on the ruled side , and then another plate is cemented with Canada balsam to the silvered side , to protect the surface .
The grating is mounted with IN CONNEXION WITH THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN .
wood at the back , over the centre of a brass circular plate free to move on another lower plate levelled by screws .
The observing telescope , after a few preliminary observations to adjust the grating for verticality , was replaced by the long camera before mentioned .
The focus for any one order was determined in much the same way as in the case of the refraction photograph ; that is , it was first roughly obtained by viewing the spectrum on the ground glass screen by means of a fixed positive eye piece , but the final adjustment was likewise determined by a series of trial plates , and , when satisfactory , the sliding end of the camera was clamped up tight in order to keep the adjustment as rigid as possible .
The spectrum of the second order was first obtained .
In this the distance between the H and K lines was nearly 8 millims. With the angle between the collimator and the camera which I used , the H and K lines of the third order are brought to focus with the D lines of the second order , so that practically the grating and instruments generally are in the first instance adjusted for D , with the exception that the violet light is focussed on to the slit .
In the photograph thus obtained the H and K lines are about 15 millims. apart , and the perfection of the grating is demonstrated by the definition of the photographs , except in those parts of them where , in consequence of the presence of the glass plate , the purity of the spectrum is marred by interference effects.'5 ' ' As the exposure for the third order spectrum was much longer than that required by the train of prisms , the photographs used were taken by means of a siderostat , the use of which gives great constancy to the direction of the beam of light employed .
At times , an opera glass was used for obtaining a parallel beam ; at others , the centre of the beam ( of 12 inches diameter ) thrown by the siderostat was grasped by an 8-inch object glass , and focussed on the slit .
B. Determination of Wave-lengths .
The small original negative was enlarged by many stages to obviate all chances of distortion , until a glass positive was obtained of sufficient size to commence operations upon .
This was 24 centims. in length .
The wave-lengths of the extreme points having been taken from Cornu 's map , it was divided into ten parts carefully by compasses .
It was then found that the intermediate wave-lengths did not correspond with those of Cornu .
I at first feared that some distortion had , after all , been introduced ; and to test this I employed a photograph on which wave-lengths 38 and 40 were taken as extreme points , and the distance between them divided into twenty portions in like manner .
I then found that , although the point 39 was very slightly changed , all the rest of Cornu 's measurements between 39-40 fitted the photograph very well .
That is , I found that the ten points between 39 , as thus determined , and * Mr. Rutherford , who has carefully studied these phenomena , ascribes them to the so-called " Talbot Bands .
" 40 fell as near the places assigned by Cornu as could possibly be expected , considering the great difference in the scale employed , and the vast increase in the details obtained by the grating .
The new place for 39 , which lies at 38'992 on Cornu 's map , was finally settled as the start-point .
The distance from 39 to 40 on the glass plate was carefully divided into 1000 parts ; a scale was made in ink , and from the glass plate , which now contained both the spectrum and the scale , an enlargement on paper was obtained slightly greater than the map to be produced from it .
I willingly here express my great obligation to M. Cornu 's work , and add a tribute of admiration to its value and completeness .
The way in which it bears the severe test put on it by the larger scale I have employed is marvellous .
C. Construction of the Map .
Being thus in possession of an enlarged photographic print on which are marked the absolute wave-lengths , the next thing done was to study it side by side with a refraction photograph brought up to the same scale .
Owing to the cause I have before referred to , it was found that , though there was no difficulty in recognising the chief lines in both , still in the diffraction photograph the smaller details were in many places quite different , and in many others very difficult to harmonise , the intensities of the lines having been greatly changed .
Although , therefore , I was able to use the diffraction photograph for the positions of the chief lines , I had to depend on the refraction photograph for the detailed work and the intensity of the lines .
A trial map on the scale adopted was then very carefully made by the aid of the photographs and the original standard refraction negative .
An enlargement was o then made on three times the scale , \#151 ; twelve times the scale of Angstrom .
I tried several methods of conveniently comparing the drawing with the photograph , after the chief lines had been inserted in positions indicated on the scaled negative .
The following I found most satisfactory , and , indeed , it has been of great service in the construction of the map .
The board on which the large-scale map was drawn was placed in an upright position , and at about 10 feet in front of it a small sighting aperture of 3 millims. diameter was adjusted .
The diffraction photograph with its accompanying scale was supported between the board and this aperture , care being taken to keep the line joining the eye-hole and the centre of the map at right angles to the plane of the map , and the plane of the photograph parallel to the same plane .
The position of the photograph was so adjusted that the lines on the photograph and the map , thus viewed from the observing aperture , were absolutely continuous .
In this manner I was able to correct any error in the positions of the lines in the enlarged map with the greatest certainty .
The details and intensities were added afterwards by mounting the refraction photograph in the Having thus corrected , checked , and finished the large map in ink , it same manner .

was sent to the School of Military Engineering at Chatham , where , by the kind permission of the authorities , it was photographed down to the scale determined upon .
IV .
IMPORTANCE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC METHOD .
The importance of applying photography to the violet and ultra-violet portions of the solar spectrum seems to have been fully appreciated by Angstrom.'* The classical " Spectre Normal " is avowedly incomplete about this region , both with regard to the number of lines and their wave-lengths .
Even in portions of the spectrum distinctly visible\#151 ; such , for example , as from G to F\#151 ; a good photograph shows a much greater number of lines than the corresponding region of the " Spectre Normal .
" Similarly with regard to metallic spectra : the most complete spectral maps hitherto published , those of Thalen , + contain in a given region a much smaller number of lines than are mapped for the same region by means of photography , even when the spectra are purified to the greatest possible extent by the elimination of all known impurity lines .
Numerical comparisons illustrating this superiority of the photographic method over eye observation have already been given in the preliminary note before referred to .
O Since the publication of the " Spectre Normal , " and of Angstrom and Thalen 's map of the violet portion of the solar spectrum , a map of the ultra-violet region has been constructed by Mascart^ by means of photography ; but this map possesses the disadvantage of an arbitrary scale , and no metallic lines are introduced .
A diffraction spectrum obtained by means of photography was published by Dr. Draper in 1872 .
This spectrum extends from beyond G to O , and although the best diffraction spectrum hitherto published , the wave-length scale is too indistinct and blurred for use in very accurate measurements .
The allocation of the lines with those of metallic spectra is , moreover , not shown , although the author states that he has photographed some of the metallic spectra , both by means of a grating and of a train of quartz prisms .
The excellent photograph of the solar spectrum taken by Mr. Rutherfurd , as might have been expected , contains a much greater number of lines than the " Spectre Normal " for the same region , but being a refraction spectrum is of course not available for the purpose of directly determining wave-lengths .
The most perfect map of the violet and ultra-violet solar spectrum at present in existence is that recently published by Cornu , who has determined absolutely the wave-lengths of thirty-six of the principal lines in the portion of the spectrum included between O ( wave-length 3440 ) and beyond h ( wave-length 4120 ) , the remaining lines , about 650 in number , being introduced by interpolation .
This map was constructed by means * " Quant a la lumiere violette et extra-violette , j'espere pouvoir , a l'aide de la photographie , en publier bientot un apercju exact et detaille , surtout comme les tentatives , deja faites a cet egard par M. Thalen , confirment ces esperances."\#151 ; ( ' Recberch.es sir le Spectre Solaire , ' Upsal .

of photography , and although very incomplete so far as regards metallic coincidences , it has proved of invaluable service in the construction of the present map .
That the value of the photographic method has not been over-estimated will be rendered evident from the following considerations .
In the first place , it is well known that a great extent of the spectrum totally invisible under ordinary circumstances can be recorded by means of photography .
Thus , taking the length of spectrum which can be conveniently mapped by eye to extend from h ( wave-length 4100 ) to near A ( wave-length 7310 ) , this map would be , on Angstrom 's scale , 3-20 metres long .
Taking about Q ( wave-length 3177 , Mas-cart ) as the most refrangible limit of the spectrum conveniently workable by photography , we thus gain from this point to h , on the same scale , an additional length of nearly 1 metre .
Next with regard to the amount of detail obtained from photographs compared with that observable by eye .
To illustrate the advantage of the present method , it will be instructive to compare a given region mapped by eye and by photography .
The portion first selected has been mapped by Angstrom , by Cornu , and likewise in the course of the present work .

94 Map constructed from Ruther-furd 's print of the solar spectrum Map constructed from a negative taken July 29 , 1875 275 412 Seeing the great advantages thus offered by photography , even in a part of the spectrum distinctly visible , I am persuaded that it will be necessary to re-map the IN CONNEXION WITH THE SPECTRUM OP THE SUN .
whole length of spectrum capable of being photographed , before the conditions set forth at the commencement of this paper are fulfilled .
Experiments made in the course of the present work show that , with a bromo-iodized collodion , it is possible to photograph as far as E in the green ( wave-length 5269 ) , with exposure of from two to three minutes .
Neither can there be much doubt that , in a short time , we shall be in possession of methods enabling us to photograph any part of the spectrum with equal facility .
The importance of the photographic method will be still further enforced , if we consider that the maps of metallic spectra at present in existence , although constructed with the greatest skill , are necessarily incomplete , and are , moreover , not free from impurity lines .
Before we can hope to arrive at any great generalisation in the theory of the spectrum , it is obvious that we must have pure spectra to deal with ; and , as I have previously shown , the photographic method is the only one which enables such a purification to be effected .
V. PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS EMPLOYED .
The silver bath employed contains 40 grains of silver nitrate to the ounce of distilled water .
It is made as neutral as possible .
Amongst many developers which were tried , I have found that used by Cornu to be best for these investigations , viz. :\#151 ; 1 litre ... ... ... ... ... .Distilled water .
60 cubic centimetres . .
Saturated solution of ferrous sulphate .
30 , , " . .
Glacial acetic acid .
30 " " .
Alcohol .
In course of these researches I have used many collodions , but Blanchard 's extra bromo-iodized is by far the best and most suitable for spectrum photography , as its power for imparting detail is greater than any other , and the granular appearance under magnification is less than that produced by others , although this defect is still great , and leaves much to be desired .
The emulsion process and also the dry plate processes have yet to be more thoroughly tested in connexion with this work , but at present the time of exposure required has proved a fatal objection .
Having obtained the negative , whether from the grating or a train of prisms , the next process is to produce the necessary enlargement .
I have found no lens so well suited for these enlargements as Mr. Dallmeyer 's rapid rectilinear .
The working-positive employed is a little below the scale of the map .
The exposure required for transparencies is not so long as for a negative by about one-third .
The intensifying solution should be passed over once , merely to secure the fine lines .
The cyanide solution should be made rather weak for this work .
It is most important that both the negative and transparency should not be varnished , as the texture of the varnish will , when photographed , mar all fine detail .
VI .
CONCLUSION .
In conclusion , I would remark that the accompanying map can only be regarded as provisional , seeing that when greater dispersion is employed , or a grating without the glass plate in front of it is available , much finer details will no doubt be revealed , and wave-lengths of all lines will be directly given .
With regard to the detail shown , I believe that the map as nearly represents the actual state of the solar spectrum at the epoch as can be expected with the photographic materials and dispersion at my disposal .
There are some few lines which , when magnified , seem to show indications of being double , in some cases by a shading off on one side , in others by a trace of a central division .
Such lines are , however , represented in the map as single , and the words " probably double " introduced opposite to them in the tables .
I may also mention that in other cases a solar line , although single under the highest magnifying power , has also been suspected to be double , because in my work on metallic spectra the supposed components have been found to be coincident with two lines in the spectra of two distinct metals , which lines just graze each other without actually coinciding .
The coincidence of the solar lines with those due to the vapours of the metals in this region I shall deal with in another paper .
In the annexed plate I have not only given the map , as reduced from the photographs in the manner described , but introduced a permanent enlargement of one of the photographs .
It has not been possible to represent the intensities absolutely , on account of the varying tones of the absorption-lines themselves .
The untouched photograph will allow of the detection of any errors of this nature .
I must express my obligation to the authorities of the School of Military Engineering , Chatham , for the permission they granted to have the enlargements made , and the reduced copy of the map photographed , there .
It is my duty and pleasure to record my deep obligations to my assistants , Messrs. Meldola , Ord , and Starling for the care , patience , and skill they have successively shown in carrying on the various branches of the work .
My thanks are also due to Corporals Murray and Ewings , RE .
, for their aid in enlarging the sketch maps and comparing them with the original negative .
In the map the lines have been fined down as much as possible to show the double lines , and the shading near H and K reduced to a minimum to show the finer lines in those regions .

Lines marked ( Fe .
) are iron lines , assigned to this metal by Cornu , which have been identified by a comparison photograph of Fe and solar spectrum , N.B.\#151 ; In the case of lines which the standard photograph resolves into groups of two or more , the centre is alwa}S taken for measurement .
In the case of multiple lines , the intensities are placed in the same order as the lines are seen when looking at the map , i.e. , the more refrangible on the observer 's left .
The scale of intensities adopted is the same as that employed by ThalIjn for the metallic spectra\#151 ; 1 being the darkest and 5 the lightest .
In the overlapping portions of curves A and L\gt ; the values given by B are adopted .
