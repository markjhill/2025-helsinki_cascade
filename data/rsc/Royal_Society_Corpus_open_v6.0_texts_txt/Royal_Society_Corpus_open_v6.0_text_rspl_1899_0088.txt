The Genesis and Development of copper sulphate and of sodium chloride , but found no electrification .
The present experiments lead to the conclusion that evaporation of fused sodium does not give electrification , such as could be detected by the method used , unless oxidation is going on .

In the course of my investigations in connection with the forthcoming paper on " The Histology of the Cell Wall with special Reference to the Mode of Connection of Cells , " * certain observations and conclusions concerning the origin and development of the wall-threads and cell-wall have come to light which seem to be of sufficient interest to warrant my bringing them to the notice of the Society without delay .
1 .
Origin and Development of the " Wall Connecting Threads .
" The " connecting threads " are found to arise from the median nodes of the fibres of the achromatic spindle .
The nodes are either ( a ) all continued as connecting threads , e. .
, the endosperm cells of Tamus * * Roy .

Origin and Development of the Cell ( a ) Origin.\#151 ; Seeing that spindle fibre nodes ( apparently intact ) can be recognised in a mature wall of considerable thickness , there would seem little doubt that the existing views with regard to the genesis of the cell plate and first formed cell wall cannot be entirely correct .
I am inclined to believe that the cell plate arises not directly from the spindle fibres , in the manner described by Strasburger and others , but rather indirectly ; that is to say , that although it is possibly provided by or even proceeds from the fibres in question , yet it exhibits a certain structural distinction , in that it is pierced by the persistent nodes of the spindle fibres , and is not merged into their substance .
The cell plate would appear to consist of cytoplasm , and cytoplasm , moreover , practically identical with the ordinary cytoplasm of the cell , and from it is secreted the first formed cell wall as an equatorial membrane traversed by the nodes of the achromatin spindle fibres .
( b ) Development.\#151 ; There are grounds for regarding the primary cell wall as different in genesis and character from the secondary formations which succeed it and arise from the general cytoplasm .
In any case , the wall rapidly grows in thickness as layer after layer of cellulose is deposited .
In the course of my work certain observations were made , which appeared to throw some light on the structure and genesis of the wall thus produced .
It was found that many walls , \#163 ; hd especially mucilaginous walls , when strongly swollen and stained , after passing through the stage of stratification , became resolved into numberless and often well-defined spherical droplets or spherules which not unfrequently exhibit a markedly high refraction , and are embedded in a hyaline and possibly mucilaginous ground-substance or matrix .
I am of opinion that these spheroidal droplets represent swollen granules or spherules , which are practically homologous with the droplets or the drops ( and I am disposed to think with the droplets ) described by myself and Ito in our paper " On the Structure of the Mucilage-secreting Cells of Blechnum , L. , and Osmunda regalis , L. , " published in 1887 in the August number of the 'Annals of Botany ' ; and I believe that the phenomena in the two cases of internal mucilage there described , were in essence , instances of internal wall formation , or , in other words , that the formation of the cell wall takes place in a similar way .
Moreover , the " mucilage " described by us , both gave the reactions of cellulose , and also exhibited the formation of a firm , clear , and stratified membrane .
188 Proceedings and List of Papers In the above paper we compared the droplets of with the granules or spherules described by Langley as occurring in certain gland cells , e.g. , the mucous cells of the sub-maxillary gland of the dog ; and I am still of opinion that such a comparison was a pertinent one , and not entirely without significance in the case of the plant cell wall also .
I am disposed to regard the cell wall as fundamentally of the nature of a mucous or , rather , mucilage secretion ; the droplet or spherules ( shall I call them provisionally " " ?
) being composed of a substance which , when more hydrated , passes as " a mucilage , " and when less hydrated functions as " a cellulose .
" The spherules are embedded in the " ground substance , " and possibly the remains of even a protoplasmic framework ( which may undergo mucilaginous change ) is also present .
I regard stratification as the necessary accompaniment of the rhythmic periods of activity and rest of the secreting protoplasm ; and as to the method of secretion , it is external and not internal , as in the mucilage cells described by Gardiner and Ito .
The changes incident upon lignification and the like I have always regarded as induced by secondary secretion or post-formation chemical change .
I may add that I see little in the above view of the structure of the cell wall which militates against the facts which we have at our disposal , either with regard to the properties of the cell wall or to the phenomena associated with growth in thickness or in surface .
I am aware that much remains to be done before the above views are placed on a proper basis , but I have great hopes that this is only a matter of time and of further detailed research .
