Supplement to a Paper " On the Nervous Ganglia of the Uterus .
" By Robert Lee , M.D. , F.R.S. , Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians .
The author is confirmed in his views regarding the arrangement of the nervous filaments distributed to the uterus , as described in his papers printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 18 41 and 1842 , by his recent dissection of a gravid uterus at the full period , and which he considers as demonstrative of the accuracy of all the statements which are contained in those communications .
