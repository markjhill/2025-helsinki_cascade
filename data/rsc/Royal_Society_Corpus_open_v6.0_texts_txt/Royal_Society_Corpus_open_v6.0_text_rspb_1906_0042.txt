548 Upon the Properties of an Antityphoid Serum obtained from the Goat .

) In this communication I propose to give a brief account of the results obtained by the immunisation of the goat with the cell juices of the Bacillus typhosus , in continuation of researches already published which had for their main object the production of an antibody for the endotoxin of the typhoid organism.* These experiments met with partial success and failure .
It will be sufficient on the present occasion to say that the goat proved a more suitable animal than the horse for arriving at a solution of the theoretical and practical considerations involved .
The object was to arrive at the best method of producing with the material employed an antiendotoxin in adequate amount , with a view to its reapplication to the horse .
During the progress of these researches experiments on analogous lines have been published by Dr. Besredka , f and to these I will , in the first instance , refer .
Dr. Besredka describes the results following the intravenous injection into a horse of the intact dead and living typhoid bacilli .
The injections of the bacilli were carried out for a period of two years .
The serum was tested for antiendotoxic properties against ( 1 ) killed and dried cultures of the B. typhosus , of which O'Ol gramme killed guinea pigs on intraperitoneal injection ; ( 2 ) a soluble endotoxin extracted from the dead and dried bacilli , of which 1/ 8 c.c. killed guinea pigs .
The results were as follows : 10 or 15 centigrammes of the dried serum ( about 1 c.c. and 1'5 c.c. before drying ) neutralised 10 or 15 lethal doses of the killed typhoid culture respectively on intraperitoneal injection into the guinea pig , and the 10 centigrammes of the dried serum neutralised 16 lethal doses of the soluble * " Upon the Immunising Effects of the Intracellular Contents of the Typhoid Bacillus , as obtained by the Disintegration of the Organism at the Temperature of Liquid Air , by Allan Macfadyen , ' Boy .

549 endotoxin .
To obtain this low antitoxic value in the horse a period of two years was apparently necessary .
The typhoid cell juices employed in my experiments were prepared as follows : Virulent typhoid bacilli were cultivated on nutrient agar in Roux bottles for 18 hours at blood heat .
The growth was brushed off and washed with distilled water in a centrifuge for half an hour .
The bacilli were then triturated at the temperature of liquid air in the grinding pot already described by Rowland and myself.* The time allowed was 30 minutes per gramme of bacilli .
The mass was taken up in 1/ 1000 solution of caustic potash , and centrifuged for two hours .
The supernatant fluid was pipetted off , and represented a 10-per-cent , extract of the ground mass .
This was treated with chloroform vapour for half an hour .
The juices obtained under these conditions were sterile and toxic on intravenous injection into the test animals employed .
The endocellular toxins obtained in this manner are unstable bodies , and the juices rapidly decrease in toxicity .
The experiments with kept juices did not indicate that their injection would lead to any marked tolerance for fresh and markedly toxic juices ; the probabilities were against this easier and less risky method of procedure .
Resort was accordingly made to the use of fresh and acutely toxic juices , which contained on an average 10 to 12 milligrammes of solid matter per cubic centimetre .
The fresh juices on intravenous injection were acutely toxic for the goat .
The first goat died after the injection of 1 c.c. , whilst 1/ 10 c.c. killed several animals .
In two instances 1/ 20 c.c. killed within 12 hours .
Death was preceded by profuse diarrhoea and collapse .
Where death did not occur , the injection of 1/ 20 c.c. was followed by illness and diarrhoea , and 1 / 30 c.c. rendered certain animals ill , but with less acute symptoms .
It was obvious that the intravenous injections would have to be carefully carried out to avoid unduly depressing or killing the animals .
A goat after receiving 1/ 20 and 1/ 10 c.c. cell juice died , whilst another , after the injection of doses of 1/ 20 , 1/ 10 , 1/ 2 , and c.c. at intervals of seven days , died within four hours after receiving the last injection .
The indication , it appeared to me , was to start with small sublethal doses , and to raise them very gradually at duly spaced intervals .
One injection weekly proved to be the safest procedure , and in the later experiments the same dose was repeated until it failed to produce toxic symptoms in the animal .
A higher dose was then given and the process repeated .
This method proved successful , as the animals became tolerant to otherwise fatal doses of the toxins .
In the experiments here recorded the antiendotoxic action of the serum * ' Centralblatt f. Bakter.,5 vol. 34 , No. 7 , 1903 .
550 Dr. A. Macfadyen .
Upon the Properties of an [ Mar. 2 , was tested by intravenous injection in rabbits .
The endotoxin likewise killed rabbits acutely , e.g. , 1/ 10 c.c. killed with diarrhoea and collapse , and at times within two hours , whilst 1/ 20 c ; c. was not infrequently a lethal dose .
The onset of the toxic symptoms usually occurred in from one to two hours .
The conditions were therefore sufficiently stringent in respect of any antitoxic action of the treated goats ' serum .
I satisfied myself that neither the goats ' nor rabbits ' serum possessed any appreciable antitoxic power for the toxins employed .
Controls were subsequently found to be unnecessary .
Three cubic centimetres of normal goat and rabbit serum did not neutralise two or ten lethal doses of the cell juices .
The serum of the treated goats was tested against multiple lethal doses of the endotoxin .
An estimate was likewise made of the agglutinative and bacteriolytic properties of the serum .
I now proceed to an account of the first successful immunising experiment .

It was evident that with succeeding animals an even more careful system of dosage would have to be adopted .
The goat was bled at intervals and its serum tested .
In all instances the serum-toxin mixture was kept at 37 ' C. for 30 minutes previous to intravenous injection in the rabbit .

It will be seen that demonstrable antiendotoxins had developed in the goat and that the results were encouraging .
After 12 injections of typhoid cell juice , 1/ 50 c.c. of the goat 's serum protected a rabbit against 10 lethal doses of the typhoid endotoxin .
This property was not present in 3 c.c. of normal goat 's serum .
It is not my intention in this paper to refer in detail to the production of agglutinins and bacteriolysins .
It will be sufficient to state that whilst the amount of agglutinins present in the serum varied , the highest titrate obtained was in a dilution of 1/ 1,000,000 .
After 12 injections of typhoid cell juice , 1/ 10000 c.c. of the goat 's serum protected guinea-pigs on intraperitoneal injection against 10 lethal doses of the B. typhosus .
The serum was , therefore , proved to possess marked anti-endotoxic , agglutinative and bacteriolytic properties .
The next step was to control these results by the immunisation of fresh 552 Dr. A. Macfadyen .

Three goats are in process of immunisation by this method of small and gentle dosage and have not up to the present succumbed .
It will be observed that whilst in the case of Goat I the dosage was raised from 1906 .
] Antityphoid Serum obtained from the Goat .
553 1/ 20 to c.c. , tliG dose reached in Goat II when the final test was made-only amounted to 1/ 3 c.c. of juices containing 10 to 12 milligrammes of solid matter .
The figures demonstrate the production in considerable amount of an antiendotoxin .
The highest titrate obtained was a neutralisation of 30 ascertained lethal doses of endotoxin by 1/ 50 c.c. of the serum of Goat II .
The results confirmed those obtained in the case of Goat I , and were equivalent despite the injection of a much smaller gross amount of typhoid cell juice .
The raising of the antiendotoxic value of the serum had likewise been accomplished without any serious disturbance in the health of the animal .
This was the difficulty which had retarded the progress of the initial experiments .
Some tests were made as to the action of the serum on the endotoxin when each was injected separately .
The results were as follows:\#151 ; Babbit I.\#151 ; Fifteen lethal doses of typhoid cell juice were injected into a vein of the right ear and 1 c.c. serum into a vein of the left ear .
A second injection of 1 c.c. serum was given 20 minutes later .
The animal survived .
Babbit II.\#151 ; Received five lethal doses of the toxic juice in the right ear and 1 c.c. serum in the left ear .
The animal survived .
Babbit III.\#151 ; Received five lethal doses intravenous and f hour later at the onset of toxic systems 2 c.c. of serum .
The rabbit survived .
The serum , therefore , acted on separate injection into the blood stream .
The serum of Goat II was also tested against the endotoxin of the cholera organism .
One-half cubic centimetre of typhoid serum was added to three lethal doses of cholera cell juice , and the mixture , after incubation for 30 minutes at blood heat , was injected into a rabbit .
The animal died 2^ hours after the injection .
One-half cubic centimetre of a typhoid serum , which had been found to protect against 30 lethal doses of typhoid endotoxin , did not protect a rabbit against three doses of cholera endotoxin , and was to this extent specific .
The agglutinative power of the serum rose to 1/ 1,000,000 , and 1/ 10000 c.c. protected the guinea-pig against 10 lethal doses of the typhoid bacillus .
The serum was finally tested in dilutions of 1/ 10 , 1/ 100 , and 1/ 500 c.c. for any evidence of a precipitin reaction on the fresh typhoid cell juices .
The result was negative .
There had been no appreciable development of precipitins in a serum containing at the time , when it was tested , marked antiendotoxic properties .

Condusions .
1 .
The intravenous injection of the goat with the toxic cell juices of the B. typhosus ( obtained under the conditions described ) in small and carefully regulated doses resulted in the production of an antiendotoxin .
2 .
The antiendotoxic value , as so far tested , reached a point at which 1/ 50 c.c. of the serum neutralised 30 lethal doses of the toxic typhoid cell juice .
This action was not demonstrable in 3 c.c. of normal goat 's serum , and was obtained after about four months ' treatment of the goat .
The results , after a more rapid method of immunisation , are better qua goat and rabbit than those obtained by Dr. Besredka in the course of two years with dead and living bacilli qua horse and guinea-pig .
3 .
The serum was .also agglutinative for the B. typhosus , the titrate rising to 1/ 1,000,000 .
4 .
The serum was also bacteriolytic , 1/ 10000 c.c. neutralising 10 lethal doses of the B. typhosus .
5 .
The serum did not give a precipitin reaction with typhoid cell juices .
6 .
The serum whilst neutralising the typhoid did not neutralise the cholera endotoxin .
My next step will be to test in how far it is possible to obtain analogous results in the horse .
Analogous results have been obtained indicating the production of an antibody for the endotoxin of the cholera organism .
I am greatly indebted to Mr. E. T. Thompsou for invaluable aid as well as for an important modification which has rendered the grinding process void of danger .
