( Abstract .
) The researches conitained in this paper are in continuation of those upon the Resistance of Wrought-Ironi Tubes to collapse , which have been published in the " Philosophical Transactions ' for 1858 .
The results arrived at in those experiments were so important as to suggest further inquiry under the same conditions of rupture with other materials ; and glass was selected , not only as differing widely in its physical properties from wrought iron , and hence well fitted to extend our knowledge of the laws of collapse , but because our acquaintance with its strength in the various forms in which it is employed in the arts and in scientific research is very limited .
To arrive at satisfactory conclusions , the experiments on this material were extended so as to embrace the direct tenacity , the resistance to compression , and the resistance to bursting , as well as the resistance to collapse .
The glass experimented upon was of three kinds : Specific gravity .

2'5284 Extra white crown-glass 2 4504 Tenacity of Glass-For reasons detailed by the authors , the experiments upon the direct tenacity of glass made by tearing specimens asunder are less satisfactory than those in the rest of the paper ; and it is argued that more reliance is to be placed upon the tenacity deduced from the experiments on the resistance of globes to bursting in which water-pressure was employed , than upon the tenacity obtained directly by tearing specimens asunder .
The r esults obtained by the latter method give the following mean results Teniacity per square inch in pounds .

2346 Resistance of Glass to Crushing.-The experiments in this section were made upon small cylinders and cubes of glass crushed between parallel steel surfaces by means of a lever .
The cylinders were cut of the required length from rods drawni to the required diameter , when molten , and then annealed , in this way retaining the exterior and first cooled skin of glass .
The cubes were cut from much larger portions , and were in consequence probably in a less perfect condition as regards annealing .
Hence , as might have been anticipated , the results upon the two classes of specimens , although consistent in each case , differ widely from one another .
The mean compressive resistance of the cylinders , varying in height from 1 to 2 inches , and about 0 7.5 inch in diameter , is given in the following Table : Height Mean Mean Description of glass .

Cracks were noticed to form some time before the specimen finally gave way ; then these rapidly increased in number , splitting the glass into innumerable prisms , which finally benit or broke , and the specimen was destroyed .

On the Resistance of Glass Globes to internal pressure .
In these experiments the tenacity of glass is obtained by a method free from the objections to that before detailed .
Glass globes , easily obtained of the requisite sizes , in a nearly spherical form , were subjected to an internal pressure obtained by means of a hydraulic pump , uniformly and steadily increased till the globe gave way .
The lines of fracture radiated in every direction from the weakest part , passing round the globe as meridians of longitude and splitting it up inito thin bands , varying from -A-th to -8th of an inch in breadth .

5000=mean tenacity of glass .
Here the mean tenacity is nearly twice that obtained in the experiments upon thick bars ; a result , which perhaps corresponds with the difference between the crushing strength of cylinders and cubes , and is largely attributable to the condition of annealing .
On the Resistance of Glass Globes and Cylinders to an external pressure.-The manner of conducting these experiments did not differ in any essential detail from that pursued in the experiments upon wrought iron .
The globes and cylinders , after having been hermetically sealed in the blowpipe flame , were fixed in a wroughtiron boiler communicating with a hydraulic pump .
In this position an increasing pressure was applied until the globes broke , the amount of pressure at the time being noted by means of a Schiiffer pressure-gauge .
During the collapse the globes were reduced to the smallest fragments , so that no irndication of the direction of the primary lines of fracture could be discovered .
