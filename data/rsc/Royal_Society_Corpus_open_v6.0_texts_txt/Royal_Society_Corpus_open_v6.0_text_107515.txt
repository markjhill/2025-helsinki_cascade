On the developement of exponential functions ; together with several new theorems relating to finite differences .
By John Frederick W. Herschel , Esq. F. R. S. Read December i , 1815 .
NN the year 1772 , LAGRANGE , in a Memoir , published among those of the Berlin Academy , announced those celebrated theorems expressing the connection between simple exponeni tial indices , and those of differentiation and integration .
The demonstration of those theorems , although it escaped their illustrious discoverer , has been since accomplished by many analysts , and in a great variety of ways .
LAPLACE set the first example in two Memoirs presented to the Academy of Sciences , * and may be supposed in the course of these researches , to have caught the first hint of the Calcul des Fonctions Generatrices with which they are so intimately connected ; as , after an interval of two years , another demonstration of them , drawn solely from the principles of that calculus appeared , together with the calculus itself , in the memoirs of the Academy .
This demonstration , involving , however , the passage from finite to infinite , is therefore ( although preferable perhaps in a systematic arrangement , where all is made to flow from one fundamental principle ) less elegant ; not on account of any confusion of ideas , or want of evidence ; but , because the ideas of finite and infinite , as such , are extraneous to symbolic language , and , if we M m. des Savans Etrangers , i773 P. 535p.Mem , de 'Acad .

p. lo2 would avoid their use , much circumlocution , as well as very unwieldy formulae must be introduced .
ARBOGAST also , in his work on derivations , has given two most ingenious demonstrations of them , and added greatly to their generality ; and lastly , Dr. BRINKLEY has made them the subject of a paper in the Transactions of this Society , * to which I shall have occasion again to refer .
Considered as insulated truths , unconnected with any other considerable branch of analysis , the method employed by the latter author seems the most simple and elegant which could have been devised .
It has however the great inconvenience of not making us acquainted with the bearings and dependencies of these important theorems , which , in this instance , as in many others , are far more valuable than the mere formulak .
The theorems above referred to are comprehended in the equation .
{ , UX } no ux ; ( a ) Antx ; E ; ... ... ... ... .
( a ) or , more generally ( 1+A))af { ^aD}ux , ; ... ... ... ( b ) where the A applies to the variation of x , and the D to the functional characteristic u ; and where n may have any value whatever .
Taking these theorems for granted , I shall observe , that , in their present form , they are but abridged expressions of their meaning , and that to become practically useful , their second members must be developed in a series of the powers of Ax .
D. This part of their theory has been most beautifully and satisfactorily treated by LAPLACE in the case of n. --1 Phil. Trans. 1807 .
I , 26 ( one of the most important ) .
Unfortunately , his method turns upon an artifice which , although remarkably ingenious , fails to afford us any satisfaction except in this particular case ; and I am not aware that his researches have since extended beyond it .
The essay of Dr. BRINKLEY ( the only author I have met with who has attempted the general problem ) goes to the bottom of ' the difficulty , and leads to a formula which , considering the complex nature of the subject , must be allowed to be far more simple than could have been expected .
It is often , however , advantageous to undertake the solution of the same problem by different methods .
The excellent geometer I have mentioned , has adopted one which appears at first sight very inartificial .
It consists in expanding the second member of the equation ( a ) reduced to the form { L+ l+ ++ &amp;c. by the well-known theorem for raising a multinomial to the nth power .
The difficulties and apparent obstacles which this method presents , he has overcome or eluded by a singularly acute discussion of the combinations of the various numerical coefficients and their powers .
But it is obvious that this method , applied to the more general equation ( h ) , would lead into details of extreme complexity .
This consideration induced me to begin with that equation , regarding the other as a particular case of it ; and I have thus arrived at a general and highly interesting formula ( equation ( 2 ) of the following pages ) hitherto , I believe , totally unnoticed , and which in the particular case of the equation ( a ) , when n is a positive integer , affords precisely the same result as Dr. BRINKLEY has given : when n , however , is negative , it yields an expresE o 27 sion widely differing from his in point of form ( though of course affording the same numerical results ) and which in the most important case , where nt=i , takes a form of greater simplicity than any I am yet aware of .
I purpose then to consider the second member of ( b ) as developed in a series of powers of A x. D ( which for the sake of brevity we will denote by t ) .
If then we suppose f ( et)=Ao+At +Azt2z + &amp;c. we shall have dxf(et ) x.2 ... x. dtx where t=o after the differentiations .
Now , it is easy to see that ) will , by performing the dt operations indicated , assume the form K , t. Df(et)+ K , . ?
Df ( e )+ &amp;c. K being a certain numerical coefficient , depending on an equation of differences Kx+t .
, +l ( y +( ) Ko + I+Kx , Y whose complete integral is KK C.y yX1 KX , Y =Cy C_ .
+*(-1 ) - , ,C , C being an arbitrary function of y , to determine which we have only to consider that K , is always , necessarily , unity ; and consequently C.c_ lC ( x , )X+ ... ... .
( C , .
Now , we know that XX e_ + &amp; c = i. .
x--x.----+ &amp;c. = ; .2 ... a8 that is , ^I.x ' ( -i)x + &amp; c = 1 ; X12..73 I..,..(-l ) .
I whence it is plain that : nI Cy = and of course that AY ( y_ ) + , &amp; C -___ _ x , .

* , y where AY o denotes the first term of the ytb differences of the terms of a series ox , ,x , x , &amp;c. We have then making t=o , dXf(i ) Df( ) 0+ Dxf(I ) Ax x. ^ -r .
I ... . .
X If we separate the symbols of operation from those of quantity , the second member of this equation may be much more elegantly written as follows : D ( DA ) ( D ... ... ... .
) .
referring the D to the functional characteristicf , and the A to the o and its powers .
-Or , we may throw it into the following form , { f-45 A " fI )lAL2$..DXf(I ) AX } OX { Df(i ) A +D f ( I )A 2+D 0 Upon this , we have to observe-first , that the addition of the termf ( 1 ) at the beginning of the series within the brackets makes no difference in the result ; adding only to it the term f ( ) x o , which vanishes of itself : and , in the next place , that we are at liberty to suppose the series continued to infnity ; as every term beyond D f( ) Ao vanishes , owing v~~~~~ ... .- &amp; " to the well-known property of the functions A+ ox A +2 o &amp;c. , each of which is equal to zero .
Our series then becomes { f(l ) A+ &amp; ( c. }o =f( +A)ot and we have therefore / ( f )=f( 1 )+ f( A)l+1 ) o+ &amp;c. ... .
( ) In applying this series to any particular case we have only to developef ( +A ) in powers of A : then striking out the first term , as well as all those where the exponent of A is higher than that oftt to apply each of the remaining ones immediately before the annexed power of o , and the developement is then in a form adapted to numerical computation .
This formula may be also farther compressed into f(t ) = ( l+A ) e ; ... ... ... ... ... ... .
, ( 3 ) by simply writing it as follows : f(t ) =f(I+A ) { + t.o+t + &amp; c } .
I shall notice one more form in which the same result may be exhibited .
If we continue the series ( 1 ) , as before , to infinity , and add the term i at its commencement , it becomes { ^+ +^ -+ &amp; C , } of( , ) = D.f(1 ) whence , we obtain tJ )~ 'o.()+~ AD 02( ) d ( ) =f &gt; ( )+t 90 f ( l ) + &amp;c. or , attending carefully to the application of the symbols f/ ( tl)=aD + O. + &amp; C. } _A.D+o.r(i ) ; . .
( 4 ) We will now proceed to apply these results to the actual 30 developement of equation ( a ) .
And , first , in the case where n is a positive integer , we have f ( t)(t )f ( )- ; ( t~(t 1 ) .
consequently , f(+A)-=(1+A-1)A =A wherefore theequation ( 2 ) becomes ( tnt no t~ , + tn n*( l ) =-.Io a + , go , +.- &amp; xo 2+ A + &amp;c. ; ... ..(5 ) .
of which the first n vanish of themselves .
Let us next consider the formula ( t--1 ) ' ; -n being a negative integer .
As this function , when developed , must evidently contain the negative powers of t , as far as t-n , we first throw it into the form t '( { }n , or its equal tn tlog .
} supposing thenf ( e ) = log ' " }n we shall have by applying the equation ( 2 ) _t it log .
( I + A ) no. 2 lg .
( I +A ) ( i.I i+ I'tAA &amp;c. ; ... ... . .
( 6 ) .
All that now remains to be done is , to develope the function { log , ( ) } in powers of z. When n= 1 , the developement is well known to be IZ ~~3 -'t ; 3 - &amp; , Hence , if we suppose tt " t t , 1I B +B , .

Bzx Hence this remarkable theorem , s aSS)-t*.gs( 3)+ &amp; C. OZ+= ( 2x+l).B z ; .(1..-.(lo ) which may also be regarded as affording another general expression for the numbers of BERNOUILLI .
LAPLACE has shown that the developement of the function may be derived from that of- , and that , if the coeffil cientof 't in the developemrent of the latter be represented a by a it will be in that of the former .
Now , by the application of our equation ( 2 ) , we find that ~.}=j 7( +T+ 7Z + L ' X n"oI+ &amp;c. ... ... .( ) Making then n=1 , we fnd for the value of ax_ _2 a-2-3 ^ + ... . .

The remarkable form of our equation ( 2 ) enables us to exhibit a variety of properties of the functions comprehended under the expression A " Ox , some of the principal of which I shall now proceed to notice .
Supposef(/ ) =a ax .
t t+ t+ &amp;c. Then , as we have shown , f(I+-A ) )X ax = + : ... ... ..X. .
b. ( 3 ) from which we find f(1 + A ) o= 1.2 ... ..x * x ... ... ... .
( ( 14 ) If then the developement off ( e ) be given , we are enabled to assign the value ofjf ( 4 + A)ox in functions of x , and the converse .
It is scarcely necessary , however , to remark , that the extent of these equations is not limited to cases in which the actual developement off(1 + A ) in powers of A is practicable , or in which the form off is known , or even dependent on analytical relations .
Let us suppose a function F(t ) , and any two othersf ( t ) and f ' ( t ) , so related that F ( t ) =f(t ) f'(t ) Let also F ( t ) =+ AO + A. t+ A^ t+ &amp;c. a'similar notation being used , for f( ) and f ( t ) , changing only A into a and a ' .
It is evident then , that A =-ao aa +. .
a. +* a ' X 0 above explained .
Pursuing this idea , let us suppose F(t ) to be decomposable into any number of factorsf( t ) , J/ ( t ) , j " ( , t &amp;c. , and by executing the same mecllanical process on the expression F ( 1 4A)ox , we resolve it into f( + A)./ o ( + -A ) .
&amp;c. { o+o , +o+ &amp; tc .
} .
A moment 's attention to the method by which ( 15 ) was originally derived , will convince us that ( attending to the proper application of the symbols ) we are at liberty to develope the expression { o + o ' + o " + &amp;c. } " , and thus we have the equation F( l+ )o=f(l+ 1a+ ) '(+A ) .
&amp; c 0o+-o'+ &amp;c. }*o( 16 ) Shouid any one of the functions f( -+A ) , &amp;c. , be of the form ( 1+ -)K any term multiplied by oi in the developement of jo + o ' + &amp;c. } will acquire the coefficient ( x 4A)0 o , which , being , by ( 14 ) , the coefficient of t1 in the developement of ( 1 +-1 )k , or et , multiplied into 1.2.3 ... ..i , is evidently ( -qual to ki .
Now it is the same thing whether we write k1 for ( 14A )k oi after the developement , or at once strike out ( 1 +A )k , and for o write k previously to it .
Hence we conclude that ( I+A).F('1+A)o0=f(t+A)j'( I+A ' ) .
&amp;c. { k+o+o'+ &amp;c. } ; ... ... ( 17).where , as before , F(t ) =f(t ) f ' ( t ) .
&amp;c. The expression f( i4 ) o " is susceptible of a somewhat varied form , deducible fro , m the identical equation The coefficient of ti in the second member of this is equal to that of " inf { ( ) ' } multiplied by In , that is , by ( 13 ) , to f ( i+A)o } ; and thus we obtain _n ' 1.22 .

( o ) Let f(E ) be a rational , integral , finite function of t , and suppose it to contain the powers of t , tP , t , &amp;c. ; it is evident then that we shall have , by ( 14 ) f( + )o=o ; ... ... ... ... . .

Also from the general theorems delivered by Mr. SPENCE , we find for the value off(i + a)on-.z(which comprehends all the excepted cases ) in the third and fourth of the above forms respectively 2xL ( ( ) and 2zx+ C( ) .
It may not be uninteresting to descend to a few more particular applications of these general theorems .

Analogous theorems to those we have deduced respecting functions of one variable may easily be deduced from the value of A , , &amp; C. given in ( 7 ) .
Thus , since f te &amp;c. &amp; ==f = ( ct ) n , ( &amp; C , .
we ought to have , { .(o +A ) ; ( +'I X. &amp;c. o.on .

Similar theorems respecting the product of two or more functions of E , J ' , &amp;c. may be derived .
For instance , if F(t , t ) F(t , t ' ) xf(t t ' ) we shall have F{ ( 1i+A ) , ( r1+A ' ) }o0X .

This , as well as other analogous theorems , flows with such facility from the principles above laid down , that it is unnecessary , as it would lead me beyond the limits I proposed , to enter into any detail respecting them .
Let us now consider the developement of a function of the form J t(t ) f , and 4 , being functional characteristics of a given form , and '( t ) denoting the result of n-i successive substitutions of 4(t ) for t ili the expression of 4 ( t ) .

It seems hardly necessary , after what has been said , to notice that the developement of any function , such as f { 4 ( t ) " ' ( t ) , &amp;c. } in which t , I ' , &amp;c. denote any number of independent variables , 4 , , , &amp;c. , any functional characteristics , and n , n ' , &amp;c. , any indices , may be accomplished by the same means-or , more conveniently , derived from ( 33 ) in the same manner as the formula ( 27 ) was obtained from our equation ( 2 ) ; and the result included in a brief and simple expression .
The cases however are few , where the results afforded appear , if I may so express it , in their natural form , and it would therefore be useless at present to extend our views farther in this direction .
