] After detailing the above , and adverting to two other cases of intestinal concretions , Mr. Children describes the appearance and composition of the calculi .
The nucleus of each was a plumstone enveloped in a compact coating of phosphate of lime and ammoniacomagnesian phosphate , and of a fibrous substance alternating in layers ; the animal matter which they contain is chiefly gelatine and a little resin ; and the fibrous vegetable matter appears to have been derived from the inner coat enveloping the farinaceous part of the oat .
From other cases , which the author mentions at the conclusion of his paper , it appears that oatmeal has not unfrequently contributed to the deposition upon intestinal concretions ; and from the analyses which he quotes , the same fibrous matter has been detected in them by other chemists .
