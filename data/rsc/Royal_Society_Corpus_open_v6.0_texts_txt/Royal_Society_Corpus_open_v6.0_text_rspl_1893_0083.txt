301 traced for many of the lines present in their photographs , which do not appear in the Kensington photographs , and some of these may , therefore , be really due to iron , their absence from the Kensington photographs being due to insufficient exposure , or to the employment of different temperatures .
The almost constant difference of OT tenth-metre between the two sets of measures is a satisfactory indication of the accuracy of both .

The impurities which contribute the greater number of foreign lines to the spectrum of the electrolytic iron employed by the author are Ca and Mn , though there is decided evidence of the presence in minute quantities of various other elements .
This research on the arc spectrum of iron is made in connection with a wider investigation on the arc spectra of the other metallic elements , the results of which will be communicated to the Society in due course .

" Magnetic Observations in Senegambia .
" By T. E. Thorpe , F.R.S. , and P. L. Gray , B.Sc. , Assoc. R.C.S. Received October 31 , 1893 .
On the occasion of the recent Eclipse Expedition to Senegambia we took with us a set of magnetic instruments of the Kew pattern , with a view of making observations in a district for which the magnetic elements have not hitherto been determined .
The instruments employed were magnetometer No. 61 , by Elliott Brothers , dip circle No. 94 , by Dover , and chronometer Dent 1932 .
They were part of the equipment made use of in connexion with the Magnetic Survey of the British Isles .
Observations were made at Eundium , Senegal , and at Bathurst , on the River Gambia .
The results are as follows :\#151 ; .

The observations were made in the vicinity of the Eclipse Camp , and on a partially enclosed piece of ground between the Administrator 's house and the River Salum , about 80 yards from the shore .
The temperature during the force observations was about 30 ' C. 362 Major P. A. MaeMahon .
