292 Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the Effects of Heat " On the Effects of Heat on some Chloro-brom-iodides of Silver/ ' By G. F. Rodwell , F.R.A.S. , F.C.S. , Science Master in Marlborough College .
Communicated by Frederick Guthrie , F.R.S. , Professor of Physics in the Royal School of Mines .
Received April 13 , 1876* .
In a recent communication to the Society I have given the approximate coefficients of expansions of the chloride and bromide of silver , and the coefficients of contraction and expansion of the iodide of silver .
It was thought that some interesting results might be obtained by alloying these bodies together , and thus forming various chloro-brom-iodides of silver , and by investigating the physical properties of such bodies and the effects of heat upon them .
Accordingly these bodies were fused together in the proportions requisite to form the following compounds :\#151 ; Ag I , Ag2 Br2 , Ag2 Cl2 .
Ag I , Ag Br , Ag Cl. Ag2 Ag Ag Cl. Ag3 ^ Ag Br , Ag Cl. Ag4 I4 , Ag Br , Ag Cl. Dr. Matthiessen ( " On Alloys , " Chem. Soc. Journ. 1867 , p. 201 ) states that he believes " in nearly all cases the two metal alloys may be considered as solidified solutions of the one metal in the other ; " and he continues as follows :\#151 ; " By the term solidified solution I mean a solution of two substances which has been allowed to solidify , as , for instance , if a mixture of ether and alcohol were made , and sufficient cold could be produced to solidify it , we should produce a solidified solution of these two substances in one another .
Again , if the chlorides of potassium and sodium , say in equal parts , be melted together and allowed to solidify , the solid thus produced is a solidified solution of the chlorides of potassium and sodium in one another .
Glass is also a good example of a solidified solution ; to produce it , different silicates are fused together and allowed to solidify .
There is , however , an important point in the definition of the term ' solidified solution ' which must not be overlooked\#151 ; namely , that the components are most intimately mixed together ; in fact they are homogeneously diffused in one another , and to that extent that , even in the most powerful microscope , it would not be possible to distinguish the components of a solidified solution .
As examples of this fact glass may be quoted , which presents under high magnifying-power a homogeneous mass ; the silver and gold in the gold-silver alloys cannot be distinguished by the same test from one another .
" Accepting Dr. Matthiessen 's definition , we must regard the chloro-brom-iodides of silver as solidified solutions of chloride , bromide , and * Read May 4 , 1876 .

on some Chloro-brom-iodides of Silver .
iodide of silver in one another .
Such bodies are found native : embolite ( e[u(36\iov ) is a chloro-bromide of silver in which the ratio of the chloride to the bromide varies indefinitely .
Minerals having respectively the composition Ag3 Br Cl2 , Ag6 Br2 Cl3 , Ag4 Br3 Cl , Ag9 Br4 Cl5 , and Ag4 Br Cl3 have been analyzed by Domeyko , Field , Muller , Bichter , and others .
They occur chiefly in Chili , and constitute the principal ore of the silver-mines of Chanarcillo .
They are described as possessing specific gravities which vary between 5*75 and 6-2 ; and according to Dana the colour is " greyish green , and asparagus-green to pistachio or yellowish green , and yellow ; often dark , becoming darker externally on exposure .
" Dana further states that an iodobromide of silver is found native in Chili ; but of this I am unable to find any description .
In examining the following results , we must bear in mind that we are dealing with bodies which are very differently affected by heat .
For while the chloride and bromide of silver have higher coefficients of expansion than the most expansible metals ( such as zinc ) , the iodide of silver contracts slightly when heated to a temperature of 142 ' C. , while between 142 ' and 145'-5 C. it undergoes considerable contraction ; then expands to the .
melting-point , undergoes considerable increase of volume in passing from the solid to the liquid condition , and expands slightly beyond this temperature and the melting-point .
Moreover the iodide passes into an amorphous condition between 142 ' C. and 145'*5 C. , and possesses a point of maximum density at 142 ' C. The following volumes are given for comparison with those of the alloys ( the coefficients for both the bromide and chloride are not given because they are practically the same , and one serves for both ) :\#151 ; Bromide of Silver .

The alloys were examined in the same manner as I have previously described in determining the coefficients of expansion of their constituents* .
They were cast into rods 8 inches long by 5 to S inch diameter in warm glass tubes ; then by means of a fine steel saw they were cut into lengths of 6 inches , and examined in the expansion-apparatus described and * " On the Effects of Heat on the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver , " see p. 280 .
Mr. Gr .
F. Rodwell on the Effects of Heat figured in the above-mentioned paper .
The measurements were made by-means of a micrometer-screw .
The expansions above the point of fusion were determined by the method of the platinum cone described in the previous paper .
The alloys were made by fusing together in a porcelain crucible weighed quantities of the iodide , bromide , and chloride of silver in such proportions as furnished the five compounds described below .

The specific gravity , calculated on the assumption that no change of volume takes place , was found to be 5*836 , showing a condensation equal to *0513 on the calculated volume .
Fusing-point 330 ' C. Specific gravity at the fusing-point = 5*5118 ; at 750 ' C. = 5*057 .
The mass fused to a claret-red liquid , which became brick-red , dull orange , and yellow as it cooled , and when cold had a brownish-yellow colour , a good deal resembling bromide of silver .
The mass contracted on solidifying , and formed a substance with crystalline fracture , not perfectly homogeneous .
A small central core of less dense matter appeared near the upper end of the rod , and was formed during the contraction of the mass .
The alloy gave a bright yellow powder , which turned green on exposure to light .
Loud harsh sounds were sometimes emitted during the cooling of the mass .
The substance was somewhat brittle , and broke as easily as a rod of bromide of silver of the same dimensions .
Heated in paraffine to 250 ' C. , it was found to be incapable of bending , and was as brittle as when cold .
In fracture and general characteristics it closely resembled the bromide of silver .
Placed in the expansion-apparatus the bar expanded regularly up to 125'*5C .
, and more rapidly than the chloride or bromide of silver ; between 125'*5 C. and 131'*5 C. a slight contraction took place ; at 131'*5 the mass began to expand again , and it expanded more rapidly than the chloride or bromide ; at the melting-point and at 750'C .
, however , the volume was nearly the same as that of the bromide .

The mass fuses to a dark bromine-red liquid , becoming a solid of the same colour , which changes to a pink , dull opaque brick-red , and finally when the mass is cold to a dull orange .
The powder is bright orange , becoming bright green on exposure to light .
The fused mass on exposure to light becomes of a dark steel-grey colour .
The mass is compact , hard , and homogeneous ; it is semitransparent in thin layers .

Somewhat lustrous at the surface .
Gives a clear metallic ring when allowed to fall on an anvil , or when short rods of the alloy are shaken together .
It is difficult to break , and has more tenacity than any one of its constituents .
It does not bend when cold ; and taken from the paraffine-bath at 250 ' C. it bends slightly , but breaks easily .
Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the Effects of Heat In the expansion-apparatus the bar expanded as regularly but not quite so rapidly as the alloy No. 1 .
Up to 124 ' C. the coefficient of expansion is nearly the same as that of the bromide of silver .
Between 124 ' C. and 133 ' 0 .
it contracted more than the preceding ; at 133 ' C. the rod began to expand again , and it expanded now both more than the bromide and more than alloy No. 1 during the same ranges of temperature .
At the melting-point the volume is less than that of the bromide , however , and at 750 ' C. it is nearly the same .

The coefficient between these limits appeared to decrease as the temperature rose ; but as the mass , or at least one of its constituents , undergoes at 133 ' C. a molecular change , passing into an amorphous plastic condition , and as of necessity there is some strain on the rod , it was thought that this decrease of the coefficient might be due to increase of plasticity and consequent slight yielding of the bar ; and the first determination ( that is to say at the lowest temperature possible above 133 ' C. ) was taken , and the above coefficient , which may consequently be somewhat too high , was deduced from it .

on some Chloro-brom-iodides of Silver .
301 General Conclusions.\#151 ; There are several questions connected with the chloro-bromo-iodides of silver which require to be discussed , and it may be well to take them under separate headings .
Comparison of the alloys with their constituents.\#151 ; For all purposes of these comparisons we may take the bromide and chloride of silver together , since their coefficients of expansion and certain other relations to heat are very much the same .
It will be noticed that the first alloy contains only 26 per cent , iodide of silver , while the four succeeding alloys contain respectively 41 , 58 , 68 , and 74 per cent. If we compare the percentage of silver we find :\#151 ; No. 1 , 60 per cent. ; No. 2 , 57 ; No. 3 , 54 ; No. 4 , 52 ; and No. 5 , 51 : or , again , in No. 1 we have 14 per cent , of iodine to 25 of Br and Cl ; in No. 2 , 21 of I to 20 of Br and Cl ; in No. 3 , 31 of I to 14 of Br and Cl ; in No. 4 , 36 of I to 11 of Br and Cl ; and in No. 5 , 40 of I to 8 of Br and CL The first alloy is scarcely affected at all as regards its coefficients of expansion by the presence of the iodide , and , in fact , resembles bromide of silver in all its properties ; on the other hand , the alloys Nos. 4 and 5 are very much affected by the presence of the large amount of iodide of silver they contain , and in many respects resemble the iodide .
The greatest divergence from the properties of the constituents is to be found in the alloys Nos. 2 and 3 , in which the iodide varies between 40 and 60 per cent. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the iodide only dissolves to a certain extent in the fused bromide and chloride ; for we notice that certain properties of the iodide are masked so long as the iodide does not exceed a certain percentage , while they become very apparent as the amount of iodide is increased .
Of the point of maximum density of the alloys.\#151 ; While the bromide and chloride of silver expand regularly like any ordinary solid , it has been shown that the iodide contracts slightly up to 142 ' C. , considerably between 142 ' C. and 145'*5 C. , and that it possesses its point of maximum density at the latter temperature .
Now nothing could possibly be more definite or decided than the behaviour of the alloys at the critical temperature at which contraction commences during the heating of the mass .
In the case of the alloys Nos. 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , this contraction invariably commenced at 124 ' C. , and invariably finished at 133 ' C. In the case of No. 1 alloy , in which the percentage of iodide of silver was smallest , the contraction began at 125'-5 C. ( 10,5 C. higher than the others ) .
The action took place with great precision in every instance .
Here , then , we have the curious fact that while the iodide of silver commences its considerable contraction ( which occurs simultaneously with its passage from the brittle crystalline state into the plastic amorphous state ) at 142 ' C. and finishes it at 145'-5 C. , the chloro-brom-iodide alloys commence their contraction 18 ' C. lower , and end it 12'*5 C. lower .
Thus in the iodide it is effected in the heating through 30,5 C. , while in the alloy it requires 9 ' C. We must remember that in the alloy the iodide passes into the amorphous condition while it is disseminated through the mass of the bromide and VOL. XXV .
T Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the Effects of Heat chloride ; and perhaps the same cause as that which lowers the fusing-point lowers also the point of maximum density .
Fusing-point.\#151 ; While the fusing-point of iodide of silver has been estimated at 450 ' 0 .
, of bromide at 380 ' C. , and of chloride at 350 ' C. , that of the alloys is lower than any of the constituents ( except No. 5 , which is the same as that of the lowest of its constituents , while it contains 74 per cent , of the constituent with the highest fusing-point , viz. 450 ' C. ) .
Thus No. 1 melts at 330 ' C. , No. 2 at 295 ' C. , No. 3 at 320 ' C. , No. 4 at 330 ' C. , and No. 5 at 350 ' C. The most distinctive alloy , No. 2 , melts at a temperature which is 155 ' O. below that of the iodide which constitutes 41-5 per cent , of the weight of the alloy , 85 ' C. below that of the bromide which constitutes 33 per cent , of the alloy , and 55 ' C. below that of the chloride which constitutes 25 per cent , of the alloy .
Now it is well known that in the case of numerous alloys the fusing-point is lower than that of the mean fusing-points of the components ; further , it is known that a mixture of the fused chlorides of sodium and potassium has a lower fusing-point than the mean of the constituent salts .
Dr. Mat-thiessen says , " It is generally admitted that matter in the solid state exhibits excess of attraction over repulsion , whilst in the liquid state these forces are balanced ; and in the gaseous state repulsion predominates over attraction .
" Let us assume that similar particles of matter attract each other more powerfully than dissimilar ones .
It will then follow that the attraction subsisting between the particles of a mixture will be sooner overcome by repulsion than in the case of a homogeneous body : hence mixtures should fuse more readily than their constituents .
We are at least reminded of the fact that certain perfectly inert bodies , when mixed with substances which decompose at a certain temperature , lower the temperature of decomposition .
Of the contraction of the alloys between 124 ' C. and 133 ' It is a curious fact that until the percentage of iodide of silver in the alloy becomes considerable , the chief influence of the iodide seems to be exerted between that narrow range of temperature ; and more than this , that so soon as the contraction is over , the mass undergoes far more rapid expansion than do any of its constituents when heated through the same range of temperature .
It is further noticeable that the amount of contraction in some of the alloys exceeds that of the iodide itself , while we know that the other constituents possess high coefficients of expansion .
This is all dependent , without doubt , upon the manner in which the iodide changes its condition within the mass of the alloy .
Let us take the case of one of the intermediate alloys , say No. 3 ; in every 100 molecules between the temperatures of 124 ' C. and 133 ' C. we have 58 molecules undergoing somewhat rapid contraction , while 42 are undergoing expansion ; at the same time other events are taking place within the mass , heat is disappearing as internal work , and is changing the crystalline into the amorphous iodide , converting an opaque , brittle , on some Chloro-brom-iodid of Silver .
highly crystalline body ( I speak of the iodide alone , not of the alloy ) into a transparent , plastic , denser body .
What the precise function of the molecular motion which disappears can be it is difficult to assume , since in this case it not only changes the state of the body , but approximates its molecules .
Of the texture , specific gravity , \lt ; $fc .
of the alloys.\#151 ; It is noticeable that when the percentage of iodide of silver is small , the alloy is brittle while hot , and only slightly more tenacious than its constituents when cold ( No. 1 ) ; as the percentage of iodide increases , the alloy becomes somewhat less brittle while hot , and considerably more tenacious , hard , and compact , than any of its constituents ( Nos. 2 \amp ; 3 ) ; while when the percentage of iodide becomes considerable ( Nos. 4 \amp ; 5 ) , the mass becomes extremely plastic while hot , perhaps more so than the iodide itself , and very brittle when cold .
The specific gravity is in all cases above the mean of that of the constituents ; it may be because the intercrystalline spaces of the iodide are now filled with bromide and chloride .
Thus , while the sp. gr. of Ag Cl is 5-505 , of Ag Br 6*245 , and of Ag I 5*675 , that of the alloys is as follows :\#151 ; No. 1 , 6*152 ; No. 2 , 6*1197 ; No. 3 , 6*503 ; No. 4,5*9717 ; and No. 5 , 5*907 : while the percentage of the bromide , which alone has a higher specific gravity than that of the alloys , in no case exceeds 42 .
In the accompanying curve table ( p. 300 ) the expansion-curves of the iodide and bromide of silver have been added for comparison with those of the alloys ; the curve of chloride of silver has been omitted , because it is [ almost precisely the same as that of the bromide .
I have preferred to call these results " approximate " on account of certain experimental difficulties in the way of very precise determinations , which difficulties I at present see no way of avoiding .
