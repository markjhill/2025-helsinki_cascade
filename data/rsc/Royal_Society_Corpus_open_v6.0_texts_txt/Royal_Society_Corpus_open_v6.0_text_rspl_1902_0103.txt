Electric Conductivity of [ Feb. 14r 29 algebraically independent invariants ; while , if only a single function \lt ; $\gt ; occurs , all the invariants that occur up to the second order can be expressed in terms of 20 algebraically independent invariants .
The significance of these respective aggregates of 29 and of 20 invariants is obtained in connection with curves = 0 , t = 0 , drawn upon the surface .
The investigation reveals new relations among the intrinsic geometric properties of a curve upon a surface .
In particular , up to the second order , four such relations exist for a single curve ; and their explicit expressions have been , constructed .

The following paper contains an account of experiments which bring to greater concentrations the series of measurements on the conductivities of dilute solutions at the freezing point , communicated to the Royal Society in February , 1900.* The work has been carried on at intervals during the last two years , and was made possible by the kindness of Professor Ewing , who placed a room at the Cambridge Engineering Laboratory at the disposal of the writer and his wife .
The earlier experiments were originally planned in connection with the observations undertaken by Dr. E. H. Griffiths on the freezing points of corresponding solutions ; they were therefore conducted in a platinum cell of design similar to that used by Griffiths , with the object of eliminating any solvent action of glass .
Any such action would be quite inappreciable at the concentrations used in the experiments now to be described ; resistance cells of glass were consequently used , and the labour of observation was much reduced .
The structure of the cells is shown in figs. 1 and 2 ; that illustrated in fig. 1 was made of Jena glass , and reserved for the more dilute solutions .
Each cell is so arranged that by applying a slight exhaustion , the whole of the contents can be drawn up into a bulb ; by this means , when water or stock solution is added , complete mixture can be easily secured .
The method of preparing the solutions was usually the same as that formerly employed ; the pure solvent was placed in the cell , and its weight and resistance determined ; weighed quantities * 'Phil .

333 of stock solution were then added successively , the resistance being-measured after each addition .
When , however , the solutions approached saturation , this procedure was reversed ; the stock solution was first examined , and was then diluted by a weighed quantity of water .

) The resistance cell was placed in a tin bath filled with melting ice .
At first , a thermometer was inserted in the cell , and the observations postponed till its readings became steady at 0 ' centigrade ; but it was soon found that the resistance itself gave a more sensitive and convenient means of thermometry .
Measurements were taken at intervals till they became constant ; the cell being always completely immersed in ice , the result thus obtained shows the resistance at 0 ' .
As an example , the following numbers may be given :\#151 ; Time .

Before each addition , therefore , the cell and its contents were raised to some temperature near that of the 334 Mr. W. C. D. Whetliam .
Electric Conductivity of [ Feb. 14 , room by standing the cell for a few minutes in slightly warmed water .
The water used as solvent was first boiled , then distilled in glass from alkaline permanganate , and finally redistilled in a platinum still with a trace of acid potassium sulphate .
It was kept in a large stoppered flask of Jena glass till required for the experiments .
The samples of salt used to make the stock solutions of potassium chloride and copper sulphate were the same as those prepared for the earlier experiments ; details will be found in the account of those experiments to which reference has already been made .
In the cases of barium chloride , potassium bichromate , and magnesium sulphate , the best salt , sold as chemically pure , was obtained , the two salts first mentioned being recrystallised before use .
Any probable impurities would not affect the results to an amount equal to the other errors of experiment .
The measurement of the electrical resistance was performed exactly as in the earlier set of experiments .
The current from one or two dry cells was alternated by means of a revolving commutator , which was driven by a hand wheel and cord , the connections of a D'Arsonval galvanometer being simultaneously alternated by the same instrument .
The alternating currents were passed through a Wheatstone 's bridge , in one of the arms of which was inserted the electrolytic cell .
This apparatus worked with perfect success ; its sensitiveness was enough to enable readings to be taken to an accuracy varying from one part in one thousand to one part in thirty thousand , according to the resistance in the circuit .
The results which were obtained are collected below .
In the table headed Potassium Chloride I , and in the tables for all the other salts , the concentrations , given in the first column under to , are calculated in terms of the number of gram-equivalents of salt per thousand grams of solution , while , for the sake of comparison , under Potassium Chloride II , the conductivities are reckoned per thousand grams of water .
In the second column under m* , for convenience in plotting curves , are tabulated the cube roots of the concentrations ; the third column , R , shows the measured resistances of the solutions ; next comes kjm = y , the equivalent conductivities ; and finally , in the last column , are placed the ratios of y to its value at infinite dilution , which was estimated from the former set of experiments .
It was thought advisable , in view of the freezing point observations now being conducted in Dr. Griffiths ' apparatus by Mr. T. G. Bedford , to include magnesium sulphate in the investigation .
This substance was not examined in the platinum cell , so that it was necessary to extend the experiments to very dilute solutions .
This was done in cell No. 1 , which is made of Jena glass , and therefore is not likely to react appreciably with a solution of the nature of magnesium sulphate .

) Messrs. Bousfield and Lowry in their interesting paper , " The Influence of Temperature on the Conductivity of Electrolytic Solutions , " * have discussed a hypothesis recently advanced by me .
In this I stated the probability that the conductivities of all aqueous solutions approach , with decreasing temperature , a zero value at about the same temperature , and that the cause of this phenomenon is to be looked for in the disappearance of the fluidity of water .
This hypothesis was very briefly mentioned , as it were , in parenthesis , in the midst of the discussion of the numerical data which formed the main portion of the paper . !
