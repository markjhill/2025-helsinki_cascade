] In a former paper which the author communicated jointly with Professor Berzelius on sulphuret of carbon , its remarkable volatility was noticed ; and as it appeared likely on that account to produce a great .
degree of cold by evaporation , Dr. Marcet has been induced to make a course of experiments onr that subject .
474 ?
When the bulb of a thermometer , wrapped in fine lint , has been dipped in the sulphureous liquor , if it be simply exposed to the air it sinks to about zero of Fahrenheit 's scale , although by a similar evaporation of ether the cold produced is not below 20 ? .
If a thermometer , coated as before , and wetted with the sulphuret , be placed in the receiver of an air-pump , a cold of 65 ?
or 70 ?
below 0 ?
is easily obtained , by a vacuum which supports one fourth of an inch of mercury ; and if the air-pump can exhaust as far as one eighth of an inch , the thermometer sinks to -81 ?
or -820 in less than two minutes , even though the thermometer at the commencement of the experiment was as high as 70 ?
above 0 .
Hence the freezing of mercury is an experiment that may be performed at any time , and with no more apparatus than a common airpump , and enough of the sulphuret to moisten the bulb of a thermometer .
Since sulphuric acid has no affinity for the sulphuret , it has no effect in adding to the degree of cold produced upon the principle upon which that is employed by Mr. Leslie , excepting in so far as it removes any moisture that may be present in the air , and which in some measure impedes the process until it is converted into a hoar frost , that may be seen adherent to the bulb of the thermometer .
