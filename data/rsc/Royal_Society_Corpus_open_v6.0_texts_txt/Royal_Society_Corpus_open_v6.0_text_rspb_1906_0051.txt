) The following measurements of the cross-sections of the lumbo-sacral-coccygeal cord of the Macaque monkey { Macacus sinicus ) , with the calculations made therefrom , are here given as the preliminary results of a research made upon the spinal cord of this monkey .
For the purpose of presenting the facts as clearly as possible , the paper is illustrated by a series of curves based upon the above-mentioned records .
The method of using curves to represent the areas of the grey and white substance at different levels of the cord has been adopted by former investigators , namely , by Woroschiloff , * Liideritz , f Krause and Aguerre , } and more recently by Donaldson and DavisS in their paper published whilst this work was in the process of completion .
The above-mentioned curves were constructed from measurements of the human spinal cord ; the curves of Woroschiloff , Donaldson and Davis , and in part those of Liideritz , being based upon the measurements published by Stilling !
in his classical work on the structure of the spinal cord .
It was intended to include a comparison of the human spinal cord with that of the monkey in this paper , but it is now thought advisable to publish the results of these investigations separately .
The work done in this direction was also based upon Stilling'slf measurements of human spinal cords .
Before entering into the details of the monkey 's spinal cord , the methods employed in the research are here described as briefly as possible .

10 c.c. The spinal cord was allowed to remain in the vertebral canal until the following day , when it was removed with the spinal ganglia , and placed in 50 per cent , alcohol .
The cord was then cut at different levels , and the various portions of it were dehydrated through gradual transference to alcohols of increasing strength , cleared in xylol , and embedded in paraffin ( melting-point , 52 ' ) .
The cord was found to be well fixed throughout its length .
The lumbo-sacral-coccygeal cord was cut in serial sections , 10 yu .
and 20 yu .
thick , with the large Cambridge rocking microtome , which cuts flat sections , and the sections mounted on albuminised slides .
} A certain number of serial sections were also cut at each of the levels of the dorsal ( thoracic ) and cervical cord , and similarly mounted .
After the removal of the paraffin by xylol , the sections were treated with absolute alcohol and then with iodine potassium iodide solution to remove the excess of corrosive sublimate and to decompose the albuminates of mercury .
The iodine solution was removed with methylated spirit and distilled water .
The sections were stained with eosin and toluidin blueS ( eosin , 10 minutes ; toluidin blue , 2| minutes ; or for a longer time in similar proportions ) , and mounted in xylol balsam .
Three drawings were made at the level of each pair of spinal nerves , the sections being selected from the upper , middle , and lower portion of the line of entrance of the dorsal nerve root .
The drawings were made with an Abbe Camera Lucida ( Zeiss ) , a Zeiss microscope with the tube at 158 , a No. 4 compensating ocular , and a Wray 3-inch lens .
The magnification was equal to 20 diameters , except in dealing with certain sections in the lower regions of the cord , when it became advisable to use a magnification equal to 40 diameters .
For this purpose a Leitz No. 1 lens was employed .
The drawing paper was placed on a Bernhard drawing board ( Zeiss ) , the board being level .

The Lumbo-sacral-coccygeal [ June 17 , For taking the measurements of the drawings Amsler 's planimeter No. 3 was used , so adjusted that one division on the disc indicated 100 sq .
cm .
, and in those cases where the areas to be measured were very small the planimeter was set so that one division on the disc indicated 20 sq .
cm .
Every care was taken to obtain accuracy .
In the majority of cases the pointer was carried five times round the area to be measured , and ten or more times when the areas were small .
To guard against accidental errors the planimeter reading was always taken after completing the first circuit , and the result compared with that obtained by dividing the final reading by the number of times the pointer had been carried round .
The difference was in all cases within the limits of instrumental error .
In each case the total area of the cross-sections of the cord was first determined .
The sectional areas of the dorsal columns , the ventro-lateral columns , and the grey substance were then each measured separately in each half of the cord , the sum of the two halves being taken as the measurement of the whole .
The total area of the central canal was measured independently of the grey substance , and the results are given in Tables II , YI .
These measurements are not separately represented in the charts , though it is necessary to take them into account in explaining the form of some of the curves .
The difference between the sum total of the measurements of the component parts of the cord and of the total section area was , in each case , noted as " error .
" As a rule the error was negative , its average value being 9'2 per cent. This may be regarded as due to " personal equation .
" The total sectional area of the white substance was obtained by adding together the figures obtained for the dorsal and the ventro-lateral columns .
It must be here stated that the term " ventro-lateral " columns is used in this paper to signify the whole of the white substance ventral to Lissauer 's " marginal zone .
" Lissauer* regarded this zone ( Waldeyer 's " Markbriicke " ) as belonging to the dorsal horn and forming a bridge between the dorsal and lateral strands of the white substance .
It has therefore been used as a boundary between the two portions of the white substance , and has been measured with , and as a part of , the grey substance .
For measuring the grey substance in each half of the cord , the division was made by continuing a line from the dorsal median septum to the dorsal boundary of the central canal , and from the ventral boundary of this to the ventral median fissure .
The grey substance was subsequently subdivided for the purpose of obtaining information as to the relative development of the dorsal and of the " ventral " horns .
Since no actual boundary exists * Lissauer , ' Archiv f. Psychiatrie u. Nervenkrankheiten , ' vol. 17 , 1886 .
1905 .
] Cord of the Macaque Monkey .
between the dorsal and the ventral portions of the grey substance , an arbitrary division was made as follows : In each half of the cord a line was drawn from the middle of the central canal to that point where the white substance projects furthest into the grey substance ( see fig. 1 ) .
The grey substance dorsal to this was designated " dorsal horns , " and that ventral to it the " ventral horns .
" From the seventh lumbar region ( middle portion ) downwards , a modification of this method was rendered necessary by the presence of the fibres of the formatio reticularis .
The lines were therefore drawn from the central canal , in the manner already described , to the corresponding points which were still discernible , and then continued in a horizontal direction through the fibres of the formatio reticularis ( see fig. 2 ) .
The " ventral horns " were measured in each case and the section area of the " dorsal horns " determined by subtracting the figures obtained for the " ventral horns " from the sum of the total grey - substance .
The " dorsal horns " therefore include Lissauer 's " marginal zone , " the substantia spongiosa Owing to the lack of sufficient differentiation , it was not possible to make an additional measurement of the substantia gelatinosa Eolandi .
In a " control " monkey , fixed with picro-corrosive formaldehyde solution containing 20 c.c. instead of 10 c.c. formol for 100 c.c. of picro-corrosive solution , it appears to be possible to do this , but the work has not been carried out as yet .
Each table of figures is accompanied by a chart with curves , representing the same graphically .
In drawing the curves the same type of line and the same lettering have , as far as possible , been used throughout the series to denote the same constituent of the cord .
The curves are to be read from left to right .

The Lumbo-sacral-coccygeal [ June 17 , The number of nerve roots in the spinal cord of the Macaque monkey is as follows : 7 cervical , 12 dorsal , 7 lumbar , 4 sacral and 3 coccygeal .
The portion of the cord from which each pair of nerves arise has been spoken of throughout this paper as the corresponding region .
" The particular portion of the cord examined extended from the upper limit of the region of the first lumbar nerve to the lower limit of the third coccygeal region and measured approximately 6'3 cm .
In the charts dealing with section areas and with percentages ( Charts I to IV and XIII , XIY ) , the length of the cord is expressed along the abscissa line in centimetres and parts of a centimetre .
The uppermost section of the first lumbar region is taken as zero .
The distance from zero to each measured section is given in centimetres or parts of a centimetre in a separate column in each table of figures ( except in those where only mean results are quoted ) , and on the curves the observation points are marked by a dot or cross as nearly as possible in the exact position indicated in the table .
As a matter of convenience , the first drawing made in the first lumbar region was of a section occurring at 0T42 cm .
below that taken as zero .
In the section area and percentage charts which give the complete results obtained ( Charts I to IY and XIII , XIY ) , the numbers I , II , III , IY , etc. , mark on the zero abscissa line the approximate cephalic end of the region of each pair of spinal nerves .
In the charts where the curves are constructed from mean figures ( Charts Y to XII , and XY to XX ) , the length of the cord and of the individual nerve regions has been disregarded , and the calculations referring to the region of each nerve ( marked I , II , III , etc. ) are plotted at equal distances along the abscissa .

] Cord of the Macaque Monkey .
By comparing the measurements of the first lumbar region with the measurements of the twelfth dorsal ( thoracic ) given in the accompanying table , it will be seen , that the increase in the section area of the cord has begun prior to the region of the first lumbar nerve .
The increase is gradual to the lower portion of the third lumbar region .
It becomes very marked in the fourth , for when the maximum is reached the section area of the cord is more than one and a-half times as great as in the first lumbar region .
The section area remains very much the same ( 1.9*5 sq .
mm. ) from the middle portion of the fourth to the upper portion of the fifth lumbar region .
The gradual decrease in section area in the remaining portions of the fifth is followed by a marked diminution in the sixth lumbar region .
The section area in the lower portion of the sixth ( 12*33 sq .
mm. ) is rather less than that in the first lumbar region .
Continuing with rapidity through the regions of the seventh lumbar and the first sacral nerves , the decrease becomes more and more gradual as the lower regions of the cord are reached .
The section area in the lower portion of the third coccygeal region is about 1 / 40th that in the fourth lumbar region ( i.e. , 05\#151 ; 19'88 sq .
mm. ) .
The section area of the grey substance ( G ) ( Charts I , II , Table II ) increases from the region of the first to that of the fifth lumbar nerve , and is the potent factor in the enlargement of the total section area of the cord .
The maximum ( 7*65 sq .
mm. ) is reached in the lower portion of the fifth lumbar region and it is noteworthy that this is found at a lower level than the maximum section areas of the cord and of the white substance .
The grey substance decreases in section area from the fifth lumbar region to the end of the cord .
The increase in section area , though continuous , is gradual from the first to the third lumbar region ( lower part ) , becomes rapid in the fourth , and is again gradual in the fifth lumbar region .
In the middle portion of the fourth and the upper portion of the sixth lumbar region the section area is the same ( ca .
7 sq .
mm. ) .
The decrease is rapid from the fifth to the lower portion of the region of the sixth lumbar nerve , after which the reduction of section , area takes place very gradually .
In the fifth lumbar region ( maximum ) the section area is about three times as great as that in the first lumbar region ( upper part ) 7'6 to ^'6 sq .
mm. ) ; in the second sacral it is much the same as in the first lumbar , and in the third coccygeal region is about l/ 30th that in the fifth lumbar .

The .
Lumbo[June 17 , decreases from the latter region to the end of the cord .
The increase in the white substance ( W ) is not so great as that of the grey substance ( G ) .
There is very little alteration in the section area of the white substance through the first and the greater part of the second lumbar regions , but a marked increase takes place between the lower portion of the third and the fourth and in the fourth lumbar region .
The chief development of the white substance extends through the fourth and the upper portion of the fifth lumbar region .
The maximum ( 12*68 sq .
mm. ) being reached in the lower portion of the fourth , is thus found in the same region as the maximum section area of the cord .
The decrease is rapid in the greater part of the fifth lumbar , the section area of the white substance in the lower part of this region ( 10*48 sq .
mm. ) being about the same as that in the first lumbar .
Attention must be drawn to the fact that whilst this marked decrease is taking place in the section area of both the white substance and of the cord in the fifth lumbar region , the section area of the grey substance is still increasing .
The rapid diminution of the section area of the white substance continues to the seventh lumbar region ; after this the decrease is gradual .
From the seventh lumbar to the third sacral region ( lower ) the section area of the white substance ( W ) is only slightly greater than that of the grey substance ( G ) , whilst from the fourth sacral region to the end of the cord the section areas of the two substances are almost the same .
In Chart I , and in the above description , the white substance ( W ) has been regarded as a whole .
Through the remainder of the paper it is also dealt with in two distinct parts\#151 ; i.e. , dorsal columns and ventro-lateral columns .
The latter term is here used , as before stated ( p. 90 ) , to signify the whole of the white substance other than the dorsal columns .
By this means it is possible to obtain information as to the relative value of the contributions made to the white substance of the cord by dorsal roots and by central grey substances respectively.* The section areas of the dorsal columns and of the ventro-lateral columns are shown in the following chart ( II ) :\#151 ; " * It must be remembered that , owing to the presence of some endogenous fibres amongst those of extra-spinal origin in the dorsal columns , the comparison can only be regarded as of general value .

mm. The maximum thus occurs in the region of the same lumbar nerve as the maximum section areas of the cord and of the white substance ; but it differs in position to these , being found in the upper instead of the lower portion of the fourth lumbar region .
It occurs at some distance , therefore , from the maximum section area of the grey substance ( v. L. , lower ) .
The larger areas of the dorsal columns extend through the fourth and the upper portion of the fifth lumbar region .
The section area in the middle portion of the latter region is much the same as that in the first lumbar .

] to the end of the cord .
The decrease is most marked between the fifth lumbar and the first sacral regions , and becomes very gradual in the lower sacral and in the coccygeal regions .
In the first lumbar region the section area of the dorsal columns ( P ) is greater than that of the grey substance ( G ) .
This is also the case in both the sixth and twelfth dorsal ( thoracic ) regions ( see Tables II and IY ) .
In the second lumbar region , and throughout the remainder of the cord below this , the section area of the dorsal columns is less than that of the grey substance .
It is of interest to note that the section area of the dorsal columns in the greater part of the sixth lumbar region is approximately the same as that in the sixth dorsal ( thoracic ) .
The section area of the ventro-lateral columns ( A ) ( Chart II , Table Y ) remains about the same through the first and the greater part of the second lumbar region ( ca .
7'2 sq .
mm. ) .
It is somewhat larger in the third , and increases rapidly from the lower portion of this and throughout the fourth lumbar region .
The maximum ( 9'25 sq .
mm. ) is reached in the lower portion of the fourth lumbar , and thus occurs in the same region as the maximum section areas of the cord , white substance , and dorsal columns .
The chief development of the ventro-lateral columns extends from the third lumbar ( lower ) to the lower portion of the fifth lumbar region , the section area in the upper portion of the fifth being nearly the same as that in the lower portion of the fourth .
The section area diminishes from the fourth lumbar region ( lower part ) to the end of the cord .
The decrease is rapid to the third sacral region , and is most marked in the fifth , sixth , and seventh lumbar regions .
Prom the first to the fifth lumbar region inclusive , the section area of the ventro-lateral columns ( A ) exceeds that of the grey substance ( G ) , especially in the first three lumbar regions .
The section areas are approximately equal in the sixth lumbar region .
Prom the seventh lumbar region to the end of the cord the section area of the ventro-lateral columns is less than that of the grey substance , but the areas approach each other very nearly in the lower coccygeal regions .
The increase in the section area of the whole white substance ( Chart I , W ) between the first and the fourth lumbar , and the decrease between the fourth and the sixth lumbar regions , is chiefly due to the variation in the ventrolateral columns ( Chart II , A ) .
The actual increase and decrease in the section area of these columns ( A ) being about twice as great as that of the dorsal columns ( P ) .

The percentage of grey substance in the cross-section of the cord ( Chart III , G , Table YI ) rises almost continuously from 20 per cent , in the first lumbar region to 52 per cent , in the first coccygeal ( maximum 52'9 per cent. ) .
A slight fall in the percentage in the second coccygeal region is followed by a marked fall to 47 per cent , in the third coccygeal .
The percentage of white substance , on the other hand , falls almost continuously from ca .
80 per cent , in the first lumbar region to ca .
47 per cent , in the first coccygeal ; and corresponding to the fall in percentage of grey substance , a slight rise in the second coccygeal is followed by a rapid rise to 51 per cent , in the third coccygeal region .
Thus , between the regions of the first lumbar and the first coccygeal nerve , there is an absolute rise in percentage of grey substance and a fall in that of white substance of 32 .
Cord of the Macaque Monkey .
1905 .
] The rise and fall in percentage of grey and white substance respectively is most rapid between the upper portion of the first lumbar region and the lower portion of the fifth lumbar region .
Within these limits the rise and fall is most marked in the fourth and fifth lumbar regions , more particularly in the fifth .
Through the first , second , and the greater part of the third sacral regions , there is very little variation in the percentage values .
In the middle portion of the fourth sacral region the percentage of grey and white substance is equal , and through the first , second , and part of the third coccygeal region the percentage of grey substance is higher than that of white .
The maximum percentage of grey substance and the lowest percentage of white substance is found in the first coccygeal region ( 53 per cent , and 47 per cent , respectively ) .
The maximum percentage of white and the lowest percentage ; of grey substance is found in the first lumbar region ( ca .
80 per cent , and 20 per cent , respectively ) .
( a ) Percentage of the Dorsal Columns ) ( IV , Table VII ) .
The percentage of the dorsal columns ( P ) to the cross-section of the cord falls from the first lumbar region to the end of the cord .
The dorsal columns constitute 22 per cent , of the cross-section of the cord in the first lumbar region , their percentage value being , approximately , the same in this as in both the sixth and twelfth dorsal ( thoracic ) regions ( see Table VII ) .
Through the first lumbar region the percentage value of the dorsal columns is higher than that of the grey substance ; while it is lower than this from the second lumbar region to the end of the cord .
Between the upper portion of the first lumbar region and the lower portion of the third coccygeal region there is a total fall of 14 in the percentage of the dorsal columns .
The fall is most rapid between the upper portion of the first lumbar and that of the sixth lumbar region .
It occurs chiefly in the third , fourth , and fifth , and more particularly in the fourth lumbar .
Prom the sixth lumbar region to the end of the cord the fall is very gradual , the percentage value being approximately the same through the sacral regions .

The area of each cross-section of the cord = 100 .
The ordinates denote percentage value , the abscissae the length of the cord in centimetres measured from the uppermost section of the first lumbar region .

The curve ( A , Chart IV ) shows alternate periods of falling value and a condition of equality or slight rise , especially between the first and seventh lumbar regions.* Speaking generally , the fall in percentage is most rapid between the upper portion of the first lumbar and the lower portion of the fifth lumbar region .
Taking the individual nerve regions , the most conspicuous fall occurs between the lower portion of the region of the third and that of the fifth lumbar nerve , it being most marked in the fifth .
The percentage value of the ventro-lateral columns ( A ) is equal to that of the grey substance ( G ) in the sixth lumbar region .
Irom the seventh lumbar to the third sacral region ( upper portions ) the percentage is practically the same .
This may indicate a segmental factor .

The Lumbo-sacral-coccygeal [ June 17 , The rise , beginning in the middle portion of the first coccygeal , is continued through the second and third coccygeal regions .
The percentage attained in the third coccygeal is equal to that in the fifth and sixth lumbar regions .
Hence it is seen that of the total fall of ca .
32 per cent , occurring in the percentage of the white substance ( W ) to the cross-sections of the cord , between the first lumbar and first coccygeal regions ( upper portions ) , 11 is due to the fall in percentage of the dorsal columns ( P ) , and 21 to that of the ventro-lateral columns ( A ) , and that although the percentage value of both components of the white substance falls rapidly between the first and seventh lumbar regions , it is within these limits that the fall of the ventro-lateral columns so far exceeds that of the dorsal columns .
A further interesting point is the lack of correspondence between the fall of the ventro-lateral columns and that of the dorsal columns in the different nerve regions .
This is especially noticeable between the first and seventh lumbar regions .
The comparatively slight rise seen in the percentage curve of the total white substance ( W , Chart III ) from the first to the third coccygeal region is accounted for by the continuance of the fall in percentage of the dorsal columns counteracting the rise in that of the ventro-lateral columns .
The rise in the ventro-lateral columns ( A ) in the third coccygeal region is , however , more marked than the fall in the dorsal columns .
Comparison Between the Section Area and , the Percentage Value of the Component Parts of the Cord .
For the purpose of comparing the section area with the percentage value of any one component part of the cord , the mean figures of both have been taken in the region of each spinal nerve ( see Tables II to VII ) and the curves plotted in the same chart .
Both the sectional area ( Gf ) and the percentage value ( g ) of the grey substance increase from the first to the fifth lumbar region .
From the fifth lumbar to the third coccygeal region the sectional area decreases , whereas the percentage value increases to the first coccygeal , but decreases slightly in the second , and to a somewhat greater extent in the third coccygeal region .

From the first to the third coccygeal region a very slight increase occurs .
The decrease in the ratio is very rapid from the first to the seventh lumbar region , and is most conspicuous in the first three lumbar regions .
In the seventh lumbar and through the first three sacral regions the decrease in the ratio is scarcely perceptible .
In the fourth sacral region the ratio is as 1 : 1 , and while in the first and second coccygeal regions it is slightly less , equality is again reached in the third coccygeal region .

v ' grey substance ( lx ) The curve ( P ) representing the ratio differs from that of the ventro-lateral columns ( A ) in the total fall being much less pronounced .
The ratio starting as only slightly more than 1:1 in the first lumbar region falls gradually , and is less than 1 : 1 in the second lumbar region , and throughout the remainder of the cord .
Through the first three sacral regions the ratio is approximately the same .
The grey substance being taken as unity , the index of the fall from the first lumbar to the third coccygeal region is only 0'95 , the principal decrease occurring in the lumbar regions ( 0*82 ) and chiefly in those of the first five lumbar nerves .

( a ) Section Area of the Dorsal Horns .
The section area of the dorsal horns ( Chart XIII D , Table XII ) increases from the first to the fifth lumbar region , and decreases from the lower portion of the fifth to the end of the cord .
The actual increase between the first and fifth lumbar regions amounts to 0'87 sq .
mm. ( D1\#151 ; 1-97 sq .

The section area at its maximum ( V L , lower ) is thus almost twice as great as in the first lumbar region .
It will be observed that the maximum is reached in the same region , as the maximum section area of the grey substance ( G- ) .
Doth the increase and decrease in the section area of the dorsal horns take place gradually , but the decrease is more rapid than the increase .
The section area varies very little in the first lumbar region , it becomes rather 122 Miss M. P. FitzGerald .

] Cord of the Macaque Monkey .
The decrease in section area is very slight between the fifth and the middle portion of the seventh lumbar region .
It is accentuated between the seventh lumbar ( middle portion ) and the third sacral region , and , with the exception of being marked between the first and second coccygeal regions , is continued in a regular manner to the end of the cord .
In the first coccygeal region the section area of the dorsal horns ( D ) is almost equal to that of the ventral horns ( Y ) , and is slightly greater in the second and third coccygeal regions .
( b ) Section Area of the Ventral Horns .
The section area of the ventral horns ( Chart XIII V , Table XIII ) increases from the first to the lower portion of the fifth lumbar region , where the maximum ( 5-68 sq .
mm. ) is reached .
The maximum is thus found in the same region ( VL ) as the maximum section areas of the dorsal horns ( D ) , and of the grey substance as a whole ( G- ) .
The section area of the ventral horns ( Y ) decreases from the fifth lumbar-region to the end of the cord .
The increase in section area is very gradual from the first to the lower part of the third lumbar region , but becomes very marked between the latter and the lower part of the fifth lumbar region , three-fifths of the whole increase occurring here .
The most rapid increase is between the third and fourth and in the fourth lumbar region .
Throughout the fifth lumbar the section area is nearly four times as great as that in the first lumbar region .
The decrease in section area is more rapid than the increase , and is very marked between the lower portion of the fifth and that of the sixth lumbar region .
From the seventh lumbar region to the end of the cord , the decrease continues in a more regular manner and is least marked between the third sacral and second coccygeal regions .
The section area of the ventral horns ( V ) in the seventh lumbar region ( ca .
3 sq .
mm. ) is much the same as that in the third lumbar region , and in the second sacral ( ca .
1*5 sq .
mm. ) it is much the same as in the first lumbar region .

The Lumbo-sacral-coccygeal [ June 17 , The relative importance of the dorsal and the ventral horns of the grey substance to the total area of the cross-section of the cord varies considerably between the first lumbar and the third coccygeal regions .
This is shown in Chart XYI .
The calculations were made with the mean figures of each ratio as given in dorsal horns Table XYI .
The ratio in the region of total area of cross-section of cord each nerve is divided by 0*0871 , the value- of the ratio in the first lumbar , -I . !

It will be seen that whereas the ratio ventral hoi ns ( V ) \#151 ; taken as total area or cross-section unity in the first lumbar region increases rapidly to the sixth lumbar , it decreases at the first sacral , remains constant at the second , falls slightly from this to the fourth sacral , and while rising again in the first coccygeal region , subsequently falls rapidly to the third coccygeal .
On the other hand , the value of the ratio dorsal horns ( D ) taken total area of cross-section as unity in the first lumbar region increases slightly in the second lumbar , but falls and has practically the same value in the third and fourth lumbar regions as in the first .
It then increases rapidly from the fifth lumbar region to the end of the cord .
In regarding the curves together it will be observed that the two ratios Y and D , bear roughly the same proportion to each other in the second sacral region that they do in the first lumbar .
A further noteworthy point is that while the dorsal and ventral horns each constitute , relatively , a much larger portion of the total area of the cross-section of the cord in the third coccygeal than in the first lumbar region , the increase is much more important in the case of the dorsal horns ( D ) .

The Lumbo-sacral-coccygeal [ June 17 , Thus it is seen that:\#151 ; ( 1 ) In sectional area , both the white substance as a whole , and the ventrolateral and dorsal columns , increase with the cord from the first to the fourth lumbar region , and decrease together with the cord from the fourth lumbar to the third coccygeal region .
( 2 ) The increase in the white substance is relatively less than that in the cord , whereas the decrease is relatively greater .
( 3 ) Of the white substance , both the ventro-lateral and dorsal columns increase relatively less than the cord , and decrease relatively more to the second coccygeal region .
From this region the decrease in the ventrolateral columns is relatively less than that in the cord , though the decrease in the dorsal columns continues to be relatively greater .
( 4 ) The ventro-lateral columns increase relatively rather more than the dorsal columns , and decrease relatively less .
( 5 ) The decrease in the dorsal columns is relatively greater than the decrease in any other component part of the cord .
( 6 ) In sectional area , both the grey substance as a whole , and the ventral and dorsal horns , increase with the cord and white substance , from the first to the fourth lumbar region , and continue to increase to the fifth lumbar region , whilst the cord and white substance are decreasing .
The grey substance and the ventral and dorsal horns decrease with the cord and white substance from the fifth lumbar to the third coccygeal region .
( 7 ) The increase of the grey substance is relatively much greater than the increase of the cord , and is still greater than the increase in the white substance .
The decrease is relatively less than that of the cord , and much less than that of the white substance and its component parts .
( 8 ) Of the grey substance , both the ventral and dorsal horns increase relatively liiore than the cord , the white substance and its component parts .
( 9 ) The increase in the " ventral horns " is relatively much greater than that in any other component part of the cord , and is considerably greater than the increase in the " dorsal " horns .
( 10 ) The ventral horns decrease in much the same proportion as the cord ( or relatively rather less to the seventh lumbar region and subsequently rather more ) .
They decrease relatively less than the white substance and its component parts , to the second coccygeal region , where the decrease becomes relatively greater thau the decrease in the ventro-lateral columns .
( 11 ) The decrease of the " dorsal horns " is relatively less than that of the cord and of any other part of the same .
The rate of increase or decrease of the section area of the cord , of the grey 1905.J Cord of the Macaque Monkey .
and the white substances and of their component parts , between the region of one spinal nerve and that of the next , is shown in the following chart ( XX ) .
The calculations were made with the mean sectional area figures as given in Tables I to V , and XII , XIII .
Taking the total area of the cross-sections of the cord as the example ( Chart XX , heavy black line , S ) , the method employed was as follows : The mean sectional area of the first lumbar region was taken as unity .
The value of the second point of the curve was obtained by dividing the mean sectional area of the second lumbar regio by that of the first lumbar ; similarly the value of the third point of the curve was obtained by dividing the mean sectional area of the third lumbar region by the mean sectional area of the second lumbar , and so on throughout the remaining regions of the cord .
To render comparison easy , the curves are arranged in three separate groups in the same chart .
The rate of increase and decrease in the section area of the cord , the grey and the white substance is indicated by the curves in Group S , that of the white substance and its component parts , the ventrolateral and the dorsal columns , in Group Z , and that of the grey substance and the ventral and dorsal horns in Group B. All the curves are comparable one with another .

Summary .
From the examination of the cross-sections of the lumbo-sacral-coccygeal cord of the Macaque monkey { Macacus it is seen that:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The maximum section area of the cord , of the white substance as a whole , as well as of the dorsal and the ventro-lateral columns is found in the fourth lumbar region .
( 2 ) The maximum section area of the grey substance as a whole , and of the dorsal and the ventral horns , is found in the fifth lumbar region .
( 3 ) Reckoning the cross-sectional area of the cord as 100 , the maximum percentage of the white substance as a whole , and of the dorsal and the ventro-lateral columns , is found in the first lumbar region .
( 4 ) The maximum percentage of the grey substance is reached in the first coccygeal region .
( 5 ) Reckoning the total area of the grey substance in each cross-section of the cord as 100 , the maximum percentage of the dorsal horns is found in the third coccygeal region , and that of the ventral horns in the fifth lumbar region .
For the furtherance of this research on the spinal cord of the Macaque monkey , a series of drawings has been made of the minute structure of the grey substance , for the purpose of determining the arrangement of the cell groups at the different levels of the cord .
It has been thought advisable to deal with this portion of the research in a separate paper .
In conclusion , I desire to thank Professor Gotch for having allowed me to carry out this research in the Physiological Laboratory , Oxford , and for his kind advice .
I also wish to express my sincere thanks to many others who have assisted and encouraged me , especially to Dr. G. Mann , at whose suggestion the work was undertaken , for his guidance and kind help ; to Dr. G. J. Burch , for his ready assistance in many ways , and to Professor C. S. Sherrington ( Liverpool ) , for his valuable criticism and suggestions .

* The subject of cubic volume has not been entered into , but a passing reference is made to the relatively small volume of grey substance in the sixth lumbar region of the present monkey .
In a region of such great physiological importance this is a matter of surprise , and may be due to error ; but against this view is the fact that , on examining the cord of another Macaque monkey , the volume of the grey substance in the fifth lumbar was again found to be greater than that of the sixth or seventh , though the difference between the fifth and sixth was not so marked as in the present instance .
A further examination of several Macaque cords would be necessary to determine this point .
