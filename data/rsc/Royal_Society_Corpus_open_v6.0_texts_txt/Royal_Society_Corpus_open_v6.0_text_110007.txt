] On the evening of the preceding 28th November , Mr. Fallows observed a luminous spot on the dark part of the moon 's limb , which , by aid of a four-feet achromatie telescope , of a power of 100 , seemed like a star of the sixth magnitude ; three others , much smaller were also remarked , but want of proper instruments prevented Mr. Fallows from ascertaining their situation .
On the 29th , the large spot was as brilliant as on the preceding evening , the other two nearly invisi ? .
ble , and the third and most brilliant of the small spots had disappeared .
On the 30th , the weather prevented further observations .
