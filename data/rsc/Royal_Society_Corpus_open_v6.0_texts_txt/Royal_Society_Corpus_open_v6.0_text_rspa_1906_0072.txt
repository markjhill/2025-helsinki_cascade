( Communicated by Professor J. J. Thomson , F.R.S. Received June 25 , \#151 ; Read June 28 , 1906 .
) In the 'Philosophical Magazine ' for May , 1896 , Professor Brag points out that since the a rays are absorbed by a solid according to the same law as by a gas , it seems reasonable to expect that the atoms of the solid are ionised in the same manner as are those of a gas .
Hence we should expect that slowly-moving negative rays would be given off at the surfaces where the \#171 ; rays enter or leave a solid .
Professor J. J. Thomson has shown* that when a solid is subjected to bombardment by a stream of canalstrahlen , it emits cathode rays .
In the course of some experiments which were undertaken with the idea of determining the velocity of projection and the ratio of the charge to the mass of the slowly-moving negative or 8 rays emitted by polonium , the writer has obtained some results which appear to indicate clearly the existence of slowly moving negatively charged secondary rays which are produced when an aluminium or copper plate is bombarded by a stream of a particles .
The apparatus used in these experiments is shown in the accompanying figure , p. 213 .
A is a circular disc of copper , 4 cm .
in diameter , coated on the side facing B with a thin deposit of polonium .
This was obtained from Sthamer , of Hamburg .
B is an aluminium disc of the same diameter as A , and supported parallel to A by the stiff brass wire F. C is an ebonite stopper fitting into the narrow end of the glass tube G. Through C passes a brass tube E , inside which is fitted a second ebonite stopper J , supporting the wire F to which the plate B is attached .
The dotted lines in the figure show where the tube is silvered inside to render its surface conducting .
The disc A is supported centrally in the tube by means of three small metal feet projecting from its circumference and is rigidly attached by the wire loop L to the brass plate M which fits loosely in the tube .
Contact can be made with the disc A by means of the flexible wire spiral H and the platinum wire terminal 0 .
The distance between the plates A and B can thus be adjusted by tilting the tube and allowing the whole system ALM to slide inside .

Production of Secondary Rays by a Rays from , Polonium .
213 Fig. 1 .
D is a glass bulb filled with pieces of hard charcoal for immersing in liquid air , in order to absorb as much as possible of the last traces of gas in the tube .
The joints at C and H were made air-tight with sealing wax .
The whole apparatus was attached to a mercury pump and evacuated down to a pressure of about O'OOl mm. of mercury , and then sealed off at K. Most of the readings were taken while the bulb D was surrounded by liquid air .
The plate B was connected to the insulated terminal of a quadrant electrometer through a mercury key with sulphur insulation in the manner shown in the figure , all the usual precautions being taken to shield the connections from external electrostatic fields .
The tube E was connected to earth , so as to form a guard ring , and prevent any direct leak from the silver lining of the tube ( which was in metallic connection with the disc A ) to the insulated wire F. The method of taking observations was as follows :\#151 ; The polonium disc was first brought to the required potential by connecting it with a battery of small secondary cells .
The earth connection at R was then broken by raising the wire P. Exactly one minute later the connection between B and the electrometer was broken by raising the bridge-piece Q , and B was earthed again by lowering the wire P. Half a minute was allowed for the spot of light to come to rest , and the reading was then taken .
The tube was placed with the gap AB between the poles of an electromagnet , so that different strengths of magnetic field could be applied at right angles to the line joining the centres of the discs A and B. The sensitiveness of the electrometer was about 800 divisions per volt .

215 It is important to note that ordinary ionisation can have nothing to do with these results , as the pressure in the tube was far too low to allow of any appreciable amount of ionisation .
This is shown to be the case by the fact that when the liquid air was removed and the carbon allowed to acquire the temperature of the surrounding air , the only observable change was a very slight diminution in the charge acquired by B. These results are shown graphically in the three curves on p. 216 .
From these figures and curves it is seen :\#151 ; ( 1 ) That under ordinary conditions , iwhen not acted upon by an electric or magnetic field , the polonium gives off a larger amount of negative than of positive rays .
( 2 ) Under the influence of a gradually increasing electric field more and more of the slowly moving negative rays are stopped , and the charge carried by the a rays becomes more and more predominant .
( 3 ) A potential difference of about 10 volts between the plates is sufficient to stop the last of the 8 rays .
The fact that the Curve No. I goes on rising slightly for values of the abscissm higher than 10 volts is easily accounted for on the supposition that a few of the oblique a rays which previously just missed the plate B get pulled in when the field is increased .
( 4 ) The slowly moving negative rays can also be prevented from reaching the plate B by curling them up in a magnetic field .
The fact that the Curve No. II continues to rise for values of the magnetic field above 100 C.G.S. units is very difficult to account for in view of the results obtained by Ewers , * according to which a field of 100 units should curl up the 8 rays into circles of about 2 mm. diameter or spirals ( in the case of those shot off obliquely ) of still smaller diameter .
( 5 ) The point of special interest for our present purpose is this : The limiting value of the positive current across the gap from A to B when the 3 rays are stopped by a magnetic field is only about one-fifth of that obtained when an electric field is used to stop the 3 rays .
This fact appears to the writer to admit of only one interpretation , viz. , when the potential difference between the plates is 10 volts or more ( A being the positive plate ) the positive current from A to B consists of the following two parts : First , a stream of a particles travelling from A to B. Second , a stream of negatively charged particles travelling from B to A. The magnetic field curls up this latter stream of negative rays , as well as the 8 rays emitted by the polonium .
This theory fits in well with the last two observations given in Table II .
Here we have the polonium plate at a potential of +20 volts and the current between the plates ( consisting of the two parts mentioned above ) is * ' Phys. Zeitschr .

A magnetic field is then brought into play of such strength as to prevent the negative particles which leave B from reaching A , and to make them return to the plate B. The current is thus cut down to a value represented by 31*5 .
Very similar results were obtained when the aluminium disc B was replaced by one made of copper .
There is one other respect in which the above results are difficult to reconcile with those obtained by Ewers .
According to his figures for the velocity and ratio of the charge to the mass of the S rays , a potential difference of 30 volts should be required to stop those shot off normally .
As will be seen , this is far from the case with the sample of polonium used by me .
I hope before long to be able to publish results giving the values of v and e/ m ior the 8 rays from my sample of polonium , and also for the secondary rays , the existence of which is proved above .
In conclusion , I have to thank Professor Thomson for his kind interest , and his readiness to assist me with his advice throughout these experiments .
