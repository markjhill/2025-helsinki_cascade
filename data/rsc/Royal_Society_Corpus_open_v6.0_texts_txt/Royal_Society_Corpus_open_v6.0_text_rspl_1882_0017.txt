" By C. William Siemens , D.C.L. , F.R.S. Received June 7 , 1882 .
In the Bakerian Lecture for 1871 , which I had the honour of delivering before the Royal Society , # I showed that the principle of the variation of the electrical resistance of a conductor with its temperature might be applied to the construction of a thermometer , which would be of use in cases where a mercurial thermometer is not available .
The instrument I described has since been largely used as a pyro-me.ter for determining the temperatures of hot blasts and smelting # " Proc. Roy .

[ June 15 , 1 furnaces , and Professor A. Weinhold , * using the instrument with a differential voltameter described in my paper referred to , found its indications to agree very closely with those of an air thermometer within the limits of his experiments from 100 ' to 1,000 ' Centigrade .
I am not aware , however , that any results have been published of its application to measuring temperatures where a much greater degree of accuracy is required , as in the case of deep sea observations .
My ^ friend , Professor Agassiz , of Cambridge , U.S. , ordered last year for the American Government an instrument designed by me for this purpose , and during the autumn it was subjected to a series of tests on board the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer " Blake , " by Commander Bartlett .
The apparatus consists essentially of a coil of wire T , which is lowered by means of a cable to the required depth ; and is coupled by connecting wires to form one arm of a Wheatstone 's bridge .

connexions of the bridge are shown in figs. 1 and 2 .
The arm CD is the comparison coil S made of the same wire as the resistance coil T , and equal to it in resistance .
This coil is immersed in a copper vessel of double sides , filled with water , and the temperature of the water is adiusted by adding iced or hot water until the bridge is balanced .
The temperature of the water in the vessel is then read by a mercurial thermometer ; and this will also be the temperature of the resistance coil .
To avoid the error , which would be otherwise introduced by the leads to the resistance coil , the cable was constructed of a double core of insulated copper wire , protected by twisted galvanised steel wire .
One of the copper cores was connected to the arm BC of the bridge , and the other to the arm DC , and the steel wire served as the return earth connexion for both .
The resistance coil and comparison coil were made of silk-covered iron wire *15 millim. diameter , and each about 432 ohms resistance at a temperature of 66 ' F. To allow the resistance coil to be readily affected by changes in the temperature of the water , it was coiled on a brass tube with both ends open , allowing a free passage to the water .
Sir W. Thomson 's marine galvanometer with a mirror and scale was employed to determine the balance of the bridge .
Mr. J. E. Hilgard , assistant in charge of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey , has sent me the following results of Commander Bartlett 's experiments .
The apparatus was set up on board the " Blake , " at Providence , in April , 1881 , but owing to there being no ice machine on board , only preliminary experiments were made until the following August .
The " Blake " sailed from Charleston on August 4th , running a line over known depths in the current of the Gulf Stream .
A 60 lb-sinker used in sounding was attached to the end of the cable near the resistance coil , which was allowed to hang freely below .
When well in the strength of the stream a series of temperatures were taken by the Miller-Casella thermometers on the sounding wire , and immediately .after the insulated cable was lowered to the surface , and water from the surface placed around the comparison coil on deck .
The temperature of the attached thermometer read the Same as that determined for the surface by the thermometer attached to the hydrometer case .
Under these conditions the pencil of light from the mirror was on the zero of the scale .
During the experiments the vessel was rolling from 10 ' to 15 ' , and there was a moderate breeze from south-east-The resistance coil was lowered to five fathoms below the surface , and was allowed to remain five minutes , the circuit being closed , the pencil of light remained at zero .
Lowerings were then made to 10r 20 , and 30 fathoms , and in each case five minutes were allowed for- Dr. C. W. Siemens .
[ June 15 , the resistance coil to assume the temperature of the water , and after Adjusting the temperature of the water around the comparison coil , it was allowed to stand five minutes before the final reading was taken .
The rolling of the vessel affected the mirror so as to throw the .
light about 5 ' on each side of the zero point when the circuit was open , and nearly the same when closed ; but as the deflection was the same on either side it was easy to determine the middle point .
While at work in the stream it was necessary to work the engine in order to keep the wire vertical. .
The jar of the engine , however , affected the mirror to such a degree that readings could only be taken when the -engine was stopped .
The Tables I , II , III , IV give the results of the several lowerings .

A serial was taken to a depth of 400 fathoms with two Miller-Casella thermometers .
which had been carefully compared with the standard and found to agree at different temperatures .
Immediately after the serial with the thermometers the insulated cable was lowered into the sea , and the temperature , by the galvanometer and comparison coil , recorded for the same depths as taken in the first serial .
Five minutes was allowed at 5 and 10 fathoms , but there was no deflection of the 1882 .

The temperature of the surface was 76''5 .
Having lowered to 15 fathoms , at end of one minute the pencil of light was 9 ' to the left of zero on the scale .
At the end of five minutes it was 22 ' and at the end of ten minutes still 22 ' .
A number of experiments were made with regard to the time necessary for the resistance coil to assume the temperature of the water .
Five minutes was decided on as being necessary and sufficient , and was adopted in all succeeding lowerings .
, The first lowering was to 400 fathoms , the temperature at that depth being 40 ' .
The cable was then reeled in to 200 fathoms , when the current was made .
There was found to be no deflection , the temperature of the water in the copper vessel having risen from 40 ' to This temperature agreed with that at 200 fathoms when lowering to the same depth .
During the experiments there was a light south-east breeze , and a very smooth sea .
They lasted from 7.18 p.m. until 1.30 a.m. , but special care was taken with every reading , and it is probable that fifteen minutes would be a fair average time for each observation with the electrical apparatus .
The results are given in the Table .

The ship 's engines were not used at all , the vessel lying almost motionless in the water .
The temperature of the comparison coil was reduced by water from a carafe , the water contained therein being frozen i882 .
] On the Coxal Glands of Scorpio .
by a Carre ice machine .
Two carafes were prepared at a time , and there was plenty of time to keep one constantly at hand .
In order to allow the Miller-Casella thermometers to record the high temperature of 50 fathoms in the last series , they were lowered very rapidly to that depth , and after eight minutes reeled back at the rate of 200 fathoms per minute , so that the minimum side had not .time to assume a lower temperature .
The cable was led from a large reel through an 18-inch leading block , and was lowered and reeled in very slowly , and without jerks .
It may be noted in the above Tables that the two instruments gave -precisely the same readings at positions of maximum or minimum temperature , but that in intermediate positions the electrical thermometer , in almost every instance , gave a higher reading .
This discrepancy may be accounted for , I think , by the circumstance that the electrical thermometer gives the temperature of the water actually surrounding the coil at the moment of observation , whereas the reading of the Miller-Casella instrument must be affected by the Tna-rimrim or minimum tempe'ratures encountered in its ascent or descent , which may not coincide with that at the points of stoppage .
A strong argument in favour of the electrical instrument for geodetic and meteorological purposes has thus been furnished .

Received May 25 , 1882 .
In my essay entitled " Limulus an Arachnid , " * I have mentioned .
Dr. Packard 's discovery of the " brick-red glands " of Limulus , situated at the junction of the coxae of the prosomatic limbs with the body in the following terms:\#151 ; " It is true that Packard has assimilated a brick-red coloured structure occurring at the base of the cephalothoracic limbs of Limulus to a shell-gland or renal organ .
In this I cannot agree with him .
It is not even apparent , at present , that this brick-red organ , which I have examined , is of a glandular nature at all .
" Dr. Packard first described these glands in 1874 , and figured them subsequently in his valuable memoir on the " Anatomy , Histology , and Embryology of Limulus Polyphemus , " published in the Anniversary Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History , 1880 .
