) ( Abstract .
) In the first part of the paper of which this is an abstract , an account is given of the apparatus and the method employed in determining the atomic heats of the metals Ea , Al , Fe , Zn , Ag , Cd , and Pb , at various points in the range from 0 ' to about \#151 ; 160 ' C. A new method of maintaining an enclosure for long periods at any desired temperature within this range is described , the Joule-Thomson cooling effect of air on expansion being utilised for this purpose .
Details of the method of controlling the temperature are given ; here it suffices to say that there was little difficulty in keeping the oscillations in temperature of the exterior walls of the copper enclosure within a hundredth of a degree in magnitude .
In the case of sodium special experimental difficulties presented themselves , and the internal portion of the apparatus differed in design from that used with the other metals .
The platinum thermometer was in the centre of the block , while the heating coil , consisting of insulated manganin wire enclosed in fine metal tubing , was distributed throughout the mass of the metal .
This form of heating coil promises to be of considerable service in the investigation of poor conductors of heat .
We may remark that the method employed in this investigation , although differing in fundamental respects from the one used in the previous work , * gave values which closely confirmed those results where the temperature ranges overlapped .
A study of the observations of Eernst on the metals silver and lead has led us to the conclusion that no difference , greater than the probable error of experiment , exists between the values given by his method ( electrical ) and those obtained in our own investigations .
Hencf , for the metals Al , Cu , Zn , Ag , and Pb , it is possible to extend the atomic heat curves through the observations of Eernst at liquid air and hydrogen temperatures .
The only data available , at very low temperatures , for Ea , Cd , and Fe are those of Dewar at about 50 ' Abs .
But , for reasons given in the paper , we * 'Phil .

are unable to attach to the absolute values obtained by Dewar 's method the same weight as to those of Nernst .
In Table I the values of the atomic heats are given at convenient intervals of temperature , so as to facilitate the testing of any theory over an extended range .
These values have been obtained from smoothed curves drawn through our observations from 400 ' to 120 ' Abs .
, and extended through the observations of Nernst or Dewar above mentioned .

Einstein 's theory , based on the conception of the atoms as consisting of a number of Planck 's resonators with a single frequency , gives values which are too small at low temperatures .
Nernst and Lindemann 's formula , which is an empirical modification of Einstein 's expression , taking into account two frequencies , the one the octave of the other , gives values which are , in general , too high at low temperatures .

559 Debye has given a solution of the general case in which there is a continuous series of frequencies from zero to a certain limiting value characteristic of the substance .
The value of this limit frequency can be calculated from the elastic constants .
His theory is based on a number of hypotheses which cannot be accepted as being strictly valid , but of the formulae hitherto published for the representation of the atomic heat curves of the metals , that of Debye gives the closest approximation to the experimental results .
The following three examples show the order of agreement between the observed and the calculated values , and it will be observed that the discrepancies exceed the possible errors of experiment .

In the comparison above given , the limit frequency inserted in Debye 's formula is such that the calculated value coincides with the observed value at about 120 ' Abs .
, this being the lowest temperature to which we carried our investigation .

) The paper deals with the solid condition of alloys containing not more than 5 per cent , by weight of aluminium .
The diagram is a concentration-temperature diagram , the atomic percentage of aluminium being measured horizontally from left to right , and the temperature , in degrees Centigrade , being measured vertically .
The alloys melt at varying temperatures , but below the upper line A abed of the diagram they are wholly solid ; we may say , approximately , that they are wholly solid below 525 ' C. Between this temperature and the level of the point L there is a range of 100 ' .
The diagram shows four compartments in this area and records the following facts:\#151 ; The first area , on the left , indicates the fact that gold can dissolve rather more than 2 per cent , by weight of aluminium to form uniform solid solutions ; these we call a. With rather more aluminium we have the complex alloys of the second area , containing , in addition to a , a second constituent j3 .
In the alloys of the third compartment , / 3 is the sole constituent , while in the fourth a new
