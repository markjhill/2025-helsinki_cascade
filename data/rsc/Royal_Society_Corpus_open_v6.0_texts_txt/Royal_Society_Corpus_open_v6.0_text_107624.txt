On the peculiarities that distinguish the Manatee of the Wrest Indies from the Dugong of the East Indian seas .
By Sir EVERARD HOME , Bart. V P. R. S. Read July 1 , 1821 .
HAVNG received from the Duke of MANCHESTER , Governor of the Island of Jamaica , a manatee preserved in spirit , which is a species of dugong , but very different from that of which an account has so lately been read to the Society , I am desirous to add some observations upon this species , the whole tribe of animals having hitherto been little known with respect to their internal structure .
The manatee differs in its external form from the dugong , the tail being much broader , and the ribs having greater lateral extension .
As this animal feeds upon the plants that grow at the mouths of great rivers , and the dugong upon those met with in the shallows among small islands in the Eastern Seas , this difference of form will make it more buoyant and better fitted to float in fresh water ; while its habits of life place it between the dugong and hippopotamus .
There are no tusks .
The snout is flattened , and upon the ends of its toes there are nails , as is shown in the annexed drawing , ( P1 .
XXVI ) The teeth differ in number from those of the dugong , there being twenty-four molares , six on each side of each jaw .
The skull has the orbit nearly a complete circle ; the intermaxillary bones are curved at their union , but the length ZLZ S/ .Ci , o7r.IMDCC .

The bones of the ear resemble those of the dugong .
The skeleton in the general view is similar to that of the dugong .
The number of vertebraw is forty-eight , seven to the neck , seventeen to the back , twenty-four to the tail , which last have long transverse processes tipped with cartilages .
The ribs are thicker and more massy than in the dugong , and considerably more spread out .
There are seventeen on each side .
The great and little toe have only two phalanges .
The toe next the great one has three , the third fotr , and the fourth toe three plialanges : these are shown in the drawing of the skeleton .
The stomach differs from that of the dugong in the solid glandular part being more pyramidal , and connected to the general cavity by a neck , and the two lateral pouches being wider and shorter , the posterior the largest .
The food was found to be fuel .
The caecum consists of a large globular bag with two finger-like hollow processes , unlike the cxcum in other animals , and therefore is represented in the annexed drawing .
The uterus resembles that of the dugong .
The heart and lungs were not in a state to be examined .
In these two species of this extraordinary tribe of animals , between which there is so great a resemblance , the teeth are totally different , which shows the mode of classing animals from the appearance of the teeth to be very erroneous .
