' Further Experiments on the effect of Diet and Exercise on the Elimination of Nitrogen .
" By E. A. Parks , M.D. , F.R.S. Received January 28 , 1871 .
In the Proceedings of the Royal Society ( No. 89 , 1867 , and No. 94 , 3 67 ) some experiments were published on the elimination of nitrogen , i|B|Pnng exercise and rest , on a nitrogenous and a non-nitrogenous diet .
K~e result hoth series was so far to confirm the experiments which show at the changes in the nitrogen of the urine and faeces are small in extent and afford no measure of the work ; but there did appear to be a slight ettect produced in two ways :\#151 ; v'l .

2 E Dr. Parks \#151 ; Further Experiments on the [ Mar. , 1 .
There was an increased , though slight , outflow of nitrogen after work .
2 .
There was apparently a slight lessening of the outflow during work , not dependent on diminution in the amount of urinary water .
In the state of rest also , when the diet was equal , there was no lessening , but a slight excess , in the excretion of nitrogen as compared with a period both of forced and ordinary exercise .
Professor Karl Yoit , of Munich , who has a worldwide reputation for his numerous and important contributions to this subject , and who denies that exercise produces any change in the nitrogen , has taken exception to some of these experiments , on the ground more particularly that the daily ingress of nitrogen could not have been kept sufficiently stable .
I believe the experiments , showing as they do in two men a remarkable agreement in the amount of nitrogen eliminated , and the fact that the two great articles of diet by which nitrogen enters ( meat and bread ) were selected and weighed with great care* and from the analyses appeared to be of constant composition , prove that the alterations in the daily inflow of nitrogen must have been very small and less than those of the outflow .
Undoubtedly , however , to insure an absolute uniformity in the entrance of nitrogen in men , is a very difficult matter as long as only ordinary diet is given .
The employment of prepared or concentrated food , on the other hand , cannot be considered as good as common diet for such experiments ; for the body is unaccustomed to the particular form in which the food is given . .
' It was determined to repeat the experiments in two or three ways , hirst , not only to use ordinary diet with the usual attention to keep it as unifort\#174 ; as possible from day to day , but to select hours for rest mid exercise when the influence of diet is least perceptible , viz. twelve or fourteen hours after food ; then in a second series to use prepared food in which the amount of nitrogen is absolutely constant ; and thirdly to use a diet withol| nitrogen .
Unfortunately the experiments on preserved food failed on account or the health breaking down in a few days and before any exercise could be taken .
On the ordinary diet also an unexpected difficulty arose , but still the results are worthy of record .
The experiments on the non-mtrogenous diet are confirmatory of the former results , as far as the increased e i nation after exercise is concerned .
, As the details of the experiments would occupy too much space , I bav given only mean numbers when these were sufficient to fairly sho* results , and have omitted all details of the chloride of sodium , free acidity of the urine , and other matters . .

] Effect of Diet fyc .
on Elimination of Nitrogen .
who had never had a day 's illness in his life .
He was 25 years of age , weighed usually 145 lbs. , and is of very temperate habits .
He had been an iron-worker before enlistment , and is an extremely powerful man j the girth of the chest was 37f inches .
First Series of Experiments .
Ordinary regulated diet .
During 20 days the man received daily beefsteak weighing 14 ounces when raw , 1 ounce of fat for cooking , 16 ounces of bread , 1 ounce of butter , 6 ounces of milk , 16 ounces of potatoes , 1| ounce of sugar , 36 fluid ounces of infusions of tea and coffee , and 16 ounces of water .
The amount of nitrogen was determined at 300 grains ; it might be a little more or less , but still from day to day its amount was the same as far as it could possibly be kept so .
This diet was selected in this , as in the former experiments , because it is the usual ration of the Army Hospital Corps to which this man belonged , and therefore there was no fear of a change in the food itself producing any effect .
He took his meals always at the same time ; viz. breakfast at 10 a.m. , dinner at 3 p.m. ( when he took the whole of his meat ) , and tea at | to 6 .
After tea he took 6 ounces of water at 10 p.m. , but no solid food .
The urine was collected from 10 a.m. to 6 a.m. on the following morning ; then from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. As all food was taken between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. , it was expected that the urine from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. ( viz. from the 13th to the 16th hours after food ) would be of tolerably constant composition ; at any rate there would be less chance of error from the effect of food .
In this way , and by keeping as far as possible an equal daily diet , it was hoped to lessen or remove the chances of fallacy from varying ingress of nitrogen .
An unexpected circumstance partly disconcerted this hope .
It was anticipated that the amount of urine passing in the two hours from 8 to 10 a.m. would be less than in the two hours from 6 to 8 , as being further removed from the time when fluid was taken .
But the result was otherwise ; there was always more urine passed from 8 to 10 a.m. than in the previous two hours .
When this was first noted , it was supposed that an error in collecting the urine had been made ; but day after day the result was the same .
It seemed to be owing to the influence of sleep and wakefulness .
From 6 to 8 the man slept , but from 8 to 10 he was not only awake , but his mind was active , and he talked to two men who worked % the room where he slept ; and though his body was kept as quiet as during the previous two hours , the mental condition seemed to cause an increased passage of urine ; at least there seemed nothing else to account 5* the fhct that on every day during ten days while he was still in bed , .there was more urine passed from 8 to 10 than from 6 to 8 a.m. , although no water had been taken except at 10 the night before .
The result was 2 e 2 352 Dr. Parks \#151 ; Further Experiments on the [ Mar. 2 , that the urea did not fall as was expected , though its percentage was lessened .
Liebig 's mercuric nitrate solution ( the chloride of sodium being got rid of and the usual correction for dilution being made ) and Yoit 's plan for the determination of nitrogen by soda-lime were both used , so as to afford a control of the observations .
The daily weight of the body , the temperature of the axilla and rectum , the pulse , the weight of the stools , \amp ; c. were also determined .
Almost all the experiments were repeated , and several were performed three and four times* .
During the first ten days he remained in bed from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. , taking during the day his ordinary exercise .
During the second 10 days he went to bed at 10 p.m. as before , got up at 6 a.m. , worked for two hours , and then went to bed again at 8 a.m. until 10 a.m. The work consisted in dragging a cart weighing 710 lb. 4 miles in two hours .
Supposing the coefficient of traction to he the same as in walking , the amount of work calculated by Haughton 's formula would be equal to about 100 tons lifted one foot .
His weight at the commencement of the experiment was 146 lb. 2 oz. ; it fell regularly during 10 days to 144 lb. 10 oz. , viz. 1 lb. 8 oz. During the second 10 days it fell to 142 lb. 12 oz. , a loss of 1 lb. 14 oz. The following are the mean results in the first and second sections of 10 days .

] Effect of Diet fyc .
on Elimination of Nitrogen .
353 The results show no diminution in the urea during the two hours of exercise ; the slight increase may perhaps be disregarded .
In the two hours of rest , there is equally inconsiderable increase after exercise ; the excess in the 4 hours of the second section of 10 days was 1*58 gramme .
In the next 20 hours there was an increase of *828 gramme , equal to *3864 gramme , or 6 grains of nitrogen .
The differences are so small as probably to fall within the limit of error , and it is impossible to affirm that exercise to the amount of 100-foot tons in two hours made any alteration in the urea .

There was a slight decrease in the 2 hours* exercise and in the 2 hours ' rest after exercise over the corresponding period ; but it is so trifling that I hesitate to draw any conclusions .
The figures show that the slight increase in the urea was , as supposed , an unavoidable error .
Looking to the figures of the nitrogen by soda-lime as more correct , it seems that 2 hours ' additional exercise produced no marked change in the outflow when the inflow of nitrogen was constant .
This result , as far as it goes , certainly bears out Voit 's assertion of the constancy of the nitrogen , but it does not destroy the conclusions formerly drawn that the nitrogen lessens during exercise and increases afterwards , because the amount of exercise was in the present case very much less ; and as the alteration in the nitrogen even in the former experiments , with much more severe exercise , fell within narrow limits , it might easily have been anticipated that work of only one-sixth the amount would be inappreciable .
The method of experimenting also does not appear to me to be so good as that formerly used .

The mean of these hours ( 6 to 10 ) is therefore for 8 days .
354 Dr- Parks \#151 ; Further Experiments on the [ Mar. 2 , On the 8th day there was a large stool , showing previous accumulation .
Taking the weight of all the stools during the two sections of 10 days , and using the percentage composition of nitrogen of the one day in each series , the mean daily excretion of nitrogen was L807 gramme in the 1st section , and 1-766 gramme in the 2nd section of 10 days .

The exercise brought up the pulse 16 beats at 8 o clock o\er the corresponding period ; but the pulse afterwards fell below the beats of the 1st period , and the result was a perfect balance of the day s work , so that the mean pulse of the day was the same in both periods .
This shows how completely the heart , if called on for exertion , compensates itself by subsequent rest .
The exercise made little difference in the temperature of axilla or rectum ; there was a slight rise at 8 a.m. corresponding wit the pulse after exercise in both axilla and rectum , but the mean of the day was the same .
Second Series .
Prepared concentrated food .
It was proposed to give prepared food of uniform composition , so that the daily ingress of nitrogen would be absolutely constant .
I was un to obtain the " pea-sausage " which the German troops are now usm " i the Field , and used instead a concentrated food which had been sent by an inventor to Sir Galbraith Logan , and by him sent to Netley tor report .
1871 .
] Effect of Diet fyc .
on Elimination of Nitrogen .
355 It was composed of bread , meat , potatoes , sugar , spices and salt dried together , \amp ; c. , and was stated to contain everything necessary for nutrition , so that the troops on service would need no other food .
It contained 13*65 per cent , of water and 2*73035 per cent , of nitrogen .
After preliminary trials to know how much would satisfy hunger , 14 ounces were given daily , containing 10*838 grammes of nitrogen .
The food , however , produced such derangement in nutrition ( indigestion , heartburn , and headache ) that after a few days the experiments were discontinued .
In spite of the constant ingress , the elimination of nitrogen varied greatly from day to day , the extreme range being from 7'641 to 15*024 grammes ; and the man felt so ill that he begged to discontinue the experiment .
It was interesting to note that , in spite of the daily variations in the nitrogen , there passed out in the 5 days nearly the same quantity as entered , viz. 54*920 grammes of exit , as against 54*19 grammes of entrance .
He lost weight during the trial .
The experiment must be therefore repeated on some future occasion with other prepared food .
Third Series .
Non-nitrogenous food .
In the experiments formerly related in the * Proceedings ' two men were kept for 2 days at a time without nitrogen .
As it seemed to do no harm , the present experiments were now prolonged over 5 days on two occasions .
The first was after the man had been well fed with nitrogen , the second after the body had become poor in nitrogen from the restricted supply given in the concentrated food .
The non-nitrogenous food consisted of arrowroot , butter ( deprived of casein ) , and lump sugar .
Infusion of tea without milk was allowed , but this contained in the day only ^ grain of nitrogen .
Hunger was perfectly satisfied by this food ; the-man felt quite well and could have continued it .
The heartburn produced by the concentrated food was at once relieved by this starch and fat diet .
First Experiments on Non-nitrogenous Food .
Previous daily entry of nitrogen= 19.5 grammes .
On the first day of non-nitrogenous food he took his ordinary exercise ; on the 2nd took additional exercise , which consisted in digging up potatoes over 576 square feet , lifting the weight ( 16 stone ) into a barrow , and wheeling them home for \ a mile .
On the 3rd day he rested , on the 4th repeated the exercise , on the 5th rested .
He did the 4th day 's work even better than the 2nd , and could have worked on the 5th day .
The amount of work done cannot easily be calculated ; it was a good but not an excessive day 's work .
The weight on the first day was 142 lb. 7 oz. , and on the last 141 lb. 10 oz. He took daily 60 fluid ounces of water ( =1704 cub. centims. ) , and as much arrowroot , oil of butter , and sugar as he liked .

On comparing the 3rd and 4th days ( rest and exercise ) , the nitrogen by soda-lime shows a decrease on the exercise day ; but as the ureal nitrogen is almost precisely the same on the two days , it does not seem possible to affirm a decrease .
The most positive result is the increase of nitrogen ( as shown by both methods ) on the 5th day ( rest after work ) .
There was a decided excess , amounting to .G99 grammes or very nearly 19 per cent. Such an increase occurring on the 5th day after the supply of nitrogen was cut off , seems inexplicable unless on the supposition that it was owing to the previous muscular exertion .
I felt , however , that this experiment might be better conducted .
rl be exercise was commenced too soon , and before the nitrogen had reached its 1871 .

lowest point .
The kind of exercise , too , viz. digging , which is often attended with intervals of rest , was not a good choice .
Moreover , on the 3rd and 4th days he took some common salt , which might possibly have interfered , as it is supposed that chloride of sodium augments the outflow of urea .
The experiment was therefore repeated at the period when the body was poor in nitrogen from the use of the concentrated food .
Second Experiments on Non-nitrogenous Food ( , Oil of Buttery and Sugar ) .
Previous daily entry of nitrogen= 10*838 grammes .
In this series the man did his ordinary work , which was not severe , and tolerably uniform , during the first 3 days .
Then on the fourth day he marched 32 miles on level ground , carrying the new valise equipment , the service-kit , 40 rounds of ball ammunition , rifle , bayonet , and great coat .
In all the weight was 43J lb. , his own weight being 145^ lb. The work done was therefore 712*8 tons lifted a foot , or , in other words , it was an extremely hard day 's work .
He did 26 miles quite easily , but then was greatly fatigued and got very tender about the feet , and had pains in the calves of the legs .
The next day he was , however , quite well , and declared that he did not feel in the least weakened from having been 5 days on starch and butter .
The march commenced at 8 a.m. , and with intervals of 1|- hour for meals , lasted till 7.30 , so that actual muscular work both of arms and legs was going on for 10 hours .
The daily ingress of chloride of sodium was uniform during the 5 days .

On the 3rd day , on the contrary , it was greater than on the corresponding day of the former series .
The amount of nitrogen was actually greater on the 5th day than on the 1st .
Except the excessive exercise of the 4th day , no other obvious cause existed for this elimination on the 5th day .
No mistake seems possible ; for the urinary water on the 5th day was less in quantity than on the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd days , while the nitrogen was 2 grammes more than even on the 1st day after nitrogenous food was left off .
An error in analysis is not possible , since not only were the analyses repeated , but the process by urea gave results corresponding to that by soda-lime .
No constitutional condition which could cause excess in elimination was indicated either by the pulse or body temperature , and the man felt perfectly well .
I need hardly say that no nitrogenous food was taken ; for it is quite certain that it was not .
The increase in the 5th day in the 1st series , though less marked , is still unequivocal , and there seems therefore no rashness in stating that the conclusion of the experiments formerly laid before the Society is affirmed , viz. that severe exercise causes an increase in the elimination of nitrogen in the period of rest after the exercise .
It is noticeable that in this man the increased elimination was not in the hours immediately succeeding , but on the following day , and lasted for some time .
Whether during the period of exercise the nitrogen was lessened is not so clear , as the fall from 4*328 grammes on the 3rd day to 3*812 on the 4th or exercise day might be merely the continuing effect of the depriva tion of nitrogen .
The experiments formerly recorded seem to me better adapted to determine this point , which , however , certainly requires more evidence in confirmation before it can be accepted .
That changes go on in the muscles during exercise which lead to an increase in the outflow of nitrogen afterwards must , I think , be admitte and on this point it seems that the statement of Liebig must be supporte against Voit . .
It may be interesting to give the mean pulse and temperature uring these days of non-nitrogenous feeding for comparison with the norma .

Both these were rest days , when the heart would naturally beat rather less .
Non-nitro-genous diet does not , therefore , materially affect the number of beats of the pulse ; but it decidedly influenced its volume , rendering it smaller , far softer , and more compressible when felt with the finger , and it gave a feeble sphygmographic tracing .
The sphygmographic tracings show this clearly .
Ten tracings were taken at 6 a.m. on successive days , when the man was on nitrogenous food , 15 hours after dinner and 12 after the last food .
They represent , therefore , the tracings of inanition .
Five tracings were taken on successive days at 6 a.m. on the non-nitrogenous food .
The same instrument and an equal pressure were always used .
The height to which the lever was raised ( all conditions of pressure \amp ; c. being equal ) will therefore show the expansion of the artery .
The tracings were carefully measured , and the following is the result:\#151 ; 360 On the Effect of Diet fyc .

This feebleness of expansion shown by the sphygmograph was quite in accordance with the impression given to the finger .
The softness of the pulse proved it was not owing to increased resistance of the arterial wall .
With regard to the temperature , the means are so close to those of the days on ordinary diet , that having regard to the fact that the period was shorter and therefore more liable to error , and that some observations were omitted on the marching-day , it may be concluded that a non-nitrogenous diet continued for 5 days neither raised nor lowered the temperature of the axilla and rectum .
It therefore appears that when the nitrogenous food of a healthy man was reduced to one half for 5 days , and he was then kept for 5 days more without nitrogen , he was able on the 4th day after such deprivation to do a very hard day 's work .
The non-nitrogenous diet , consisting of butter oil , starch , and sugar , kept him perfectly well ; all functions seemed natural , the temperature of the body was unaltered , the pulse became very soft , and the sphygmographic tracings showed very feeble markings ; but it was not materially altered in frequency .
The circulation appeared to be properly carried on , as far as could be judged of by the man 's own feelings .
The health , as judged of by the man 's feelings and the absence of objective signs , was perfect .

action it was not thought right to continue the experiments , which had , I believe , sufficiently proved that force necessary for great muscular work can be obtained by the muscles from fat and starch , though changes in the nitrogenous constituents of the muscles also go on which have as one effect an increased though not excessive elimination of nitrogen after the cessation of the work .

" Magnetic Observations made during a Voyage to the North of Europe and the Coasts of the Arctic Sea in the Summer of 1870/ ^ By Capt. Ivan Belavenetz , I.R.N. , Director of the Imperial Magnetic Observatory , Cronstadt .
In a Letter to Archibald Smith , M.A. , LL. D. , F.R.S. Communicated by Mr. Smith .
Received February 4 , 1871 .
Bear Friend , \#151 ; Last summer I made a very interesting magnetic voyage , being invited by Vice-Admiral Possiet to take part in the Arctic Expedition with the Grand Duke Alexis , Lieutenant of the Navy .
The first part of the voyage , from St. Petersburgh to Arkangeslsk ( 1179 miles ) , by rivers and lakes , I made in a little screw cutter , 27g feet long , 7\ feet wide , and 2S feet deep , belonging to the corvette * Variage ; * the second part of the voyage ( 1716 miles ) in the schooner * Sextant/ I visited the White Sea and the coasts of the Arctic Ocean ; the end of the voyage was in the clipper * Jemchug * ( 2461 miles ) , from Norway to Cronstadt .
\lt ; ' , On the way I made magnetic observations , the result of which I enclose in this letter .
I will ask you to make them known to General Sabine and to the Royal Society .
The observations were made by a small compass which has the edge needle , and which is able to turn from one side to the other .
Each observation , the data of which are given , was made in different directions of the instrument , turning the instrument on 120 ' in azimuth , by which the eccentric errors were taken off .
In each direction the needle was turned , on both sides for correcting the error of the magnetic direction in the needle .
Four observations were made for each position of the needle .
By this mode of observation the error does not exceed more than +F .
In the declination table are given the day and the hour of each observation in order to judge of the daily disturbances of magnetism .
It would be very interesting to compare these observations with those made at the same time by photography at Kew , and thereby to deduce the magnetic disturbance due to the change of magnetic latitude .
The inclination was observed by a Kew Inclinometer belonging to the Compass Observatory , made in London in 1865 , and examined by Mr. Balfour Stewart .
No doubt it is the most useful instrument for this kind of observation .
The horizontal force was observed by " Captain Belavenetz 's Instrument
