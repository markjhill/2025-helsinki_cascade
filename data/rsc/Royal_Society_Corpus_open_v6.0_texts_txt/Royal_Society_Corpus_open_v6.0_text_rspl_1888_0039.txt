On the Change of Potential of a [ June 14 1st , the chemical composition of the liquid ; 2nd , the kind of positive metal ; 3rd , to a less degree with the kind of negative metal ; 4th , the temperature at the surface of the positive metal , and at that of the negative one ; and 6th , with the kind of galvanometer employed .
The order of the degree of sensitiveness or magnitude of the " minimum-point " is manifestly related to that of degree of chemical energy of the liquid , and , therefore , also to the atomic and molecular weights of the dissolved substances , and to the ordinary chemical groups of halogens .
With certain exceptions , it is also distinctly related to the amounts of chemical heat .
The greater the degree of free chemical energy of the dissolved substance , and the greater its action upon the positive metal , the smaller the proportion of it required to upset the balance .
The proportion necessary for this purpose probably represents a fixed amount of voltaic energy in all cases , viz. , the amount necessary to overcome the mechanical inertia of the needle of the particular galvanometer employed .
As the " minimum-point " of a chemically active substance dissolved in water is usually much altered by adding almost any soluble substance to the mixture , measurements of that point in a number of liquids at a given temperature with the same voltaic pair and galvanometer , will probably throw some light upon the state of combination and degree of chemical freedom of substances dissolved in water .

" On the Change of Potential of a Voltaic Couple by Variation of Strength of its Liquid .
" By G. Gore , F.R.S. Received May 31 , 1888 .
Having found a thermo-electric pile ( see ' Birmingham Phil. Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 4 , p. 130 ) convenient in detecting and measuring small changes of voltaic potential ( \#163 ; Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' May 3rd , 1888 ) , I have taken advantage of that circumstance to measure by the method of balance the above phenomenon in various liquids .
The following are a few examples of measurements thus made of the influence of varying quantities of different substances upon the electromotive force of a voltaic couple composed of zinc and platinum immersed in distilled water:\#151 ; 1888 .

Chemical Energy of Electrolytes [ June 14 By regularly increasing the strength of the solution , the electro-motive force at first increased very rapidly , then with decreasing rapidity , and finally remained uniform .
The total increase was 0'38 volt .
The smallest proportion of bromine required to upset the balance lay between 1 in 77,500,000 and 84,545,000 parts of water .
With each of these substances , and with all others which I have examined , a gradual and regular increase of strength of the solution j from the weakest up to a saturated one , was attended by a more or less irregular change of electromotive force .
By plotting the quantities of dissolved substance as ordinates to the electromotive forces as abscissae , each substance or mixture of substances in every case yielded a different curve of variation of electromotive force by uniformly changing the strength of its solution .
With a given voltaic couple at a given temperature , the curve was constant and characteristic of the substance .
As the least addition of a soluble foreign substance greatly changed the " minimum-point , " and altered the curve of variation of potential , both the curve and the minimum proportion of a substance required to upset the voltaic balance may probably be used as tests of the chemical composition of the substance , and as means of examining its state of combination when dissolved .
By varying the strength of the solution at each of the metals separately , a curve of change of potential was obtained for each positive metal , but not for every negative one .
