( Abstract .
) At the close of my last paper " On the Skull of the Common Fowl , I spoke of bringing before the Royal Society another , treating of that of 1571 .
] Skull of the Common Frog .
the osseous fish .
I was working at the early conditions of the salmon 's skull at the time .
I was , however , led to devote my attention to another and more instructive type early in the following year ; for it was then ( January 1869 ) that Professor Huxley was engaged in preparing his very important paper " On the Representation of the Malleus and Incus in the other Vertebrata " ( see Zool. Proc. May 27 , 1869 ) .
In repeating some of his observations for my own instruction , it occurred to me to renew some researches I had been making from time to time on the frog and toad .
The results were so interesting to us both , that it was agreed for me to work exhaustively at the development of the frog 's skull before finishing the paper oh that of the salmon .
On this account Pro * fessor Huxley mentions in his paper ( op .
cit. p. 406 ) that he leaves the Amphibia out of his demonstration , and that they are to be worked out by me .
The amount of metamorphosis demonstrable in the chick whilst enclosed in the egg suggested a much more definite series of changes in a low , slow-growing Amphibian type .
I think that this has been fully borne out by what is shown in the present paper .
The first of the ten stages into which I have artificially divided my subject- is the unhatched embryo , whilst its head and tail project only moderately beyond the yelk-mass .
Another stage is obtained by taking young tadpoles on about the third day after they have escaped from their glairy envelope j a few days elapse between the second and third stages , but a much longer time between the third and fourth , for the fourth stage is the perfect tadpole , before the limbs appear and whilst it is essentially a fish with mixed Chimceroid and Myxinoid characters .
Then the metamorphosing tadpole is followed until it is a complete and nimble frog , two stages ot which are examined ; and then old individuals are worked out , which give the culminating characters of the highest type of Amphibian .
The early stages were worked out principally from specimens hardened in a solution of chromic acid ; and the rich umber-brown colour of these preparations made them especially fit for examination by reflected light .
Without going further into detail as to the mode of working my subject out , and without any lengthened account of the results obtained , I may state that the following conclusions have been arrived at ; namely , that the skull of the adult is highly compound , being composed of:\#151 ; 1st .
Its own proper membranous sac ; 2nd .
Of a posterior part which is a continuation , in an unsegmented form , of the vertebral column ; 3rd .
Of laminse which grow upwards from the first pair of facial arches , and which enclose the fore part of the membranous sac , just as the " investing mass " of the cranial part of the notochord invests the hinder part .
4th .
The ear-sacs and the olfactory labyrinth become inextricably combined with the outer case of the brain .
And 5th .
The subcutaneous tissue of the scalp becomes ossified in certain 248 Mr. H. Mance on the Measurement [ Jan. 19 , definite patches ; these are the cranial roof-bones .
Around the mouth there are cartilages like those of the Lamprey and the Chimeera ; but these yield in interest to the proper facial bars , which are as follows , namely:\#151 ; First pair , the " trabeculae .
" Second pair , the mandibular arch .
Third pair , the hyoid arch .
And fourth to seventh pairs : these are the branchials .
These are all originally separate pairs of cartilaginous rods ; and from these are developed all the complex structures of the mouth , palate , face , and throat .
The pterygo-palatine arcade is merely a secondary connecting bar developed , after some time , between the first and second arches .
Meckel 's cartilage arises as a segmentary bud from the lower part of the second , and the " stylo-cerato-hyal , " as a similar secondary segment , from the third arch .
By far the greater part of the cranium ( its anterior two-tliirds ) is developed by out-growing laminae from the trabeculae , which after a time become fused with the posterior or vertebral part of the skull .
When the tadpole is becoming a frog , the hyoid arch undergoes a truly wonderful amount of metamorphosis .
* The upper part , answering to the hyomandibular of the fish ( not to the whole of it , but to its upper half ) , becomes the " incus , " and a detached segment becomes the " orbiculare , " which wedges itself between the incus and the " stapes .
" The stapes is a " bung " cut out of the " ear-sac .
" The stylo-cerato-hyal is set free , rises higher and higher , and then articulates with the " opisthotic " region of the ear-sac ; in the toad it coalesces therewith , as in the mammal .
The lower part of the hyomandibular coalesces with the back of the pair of the mandibular arch ; and the " sym-plectic " of the osseous fish appears whilst the tadpole is acquiring its limbs and its lungs , and then melts back again into the arch in front ; it is represented , however , in the bull-frog , but not in the common species , by a distinct bone .
This very rough and imperfect abstract must serve at present to indicate what has been seen and worked out in this most instructive vertebrate .
