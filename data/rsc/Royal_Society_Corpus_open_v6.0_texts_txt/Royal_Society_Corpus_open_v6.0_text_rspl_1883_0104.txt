( Abstract .
) In this paper the author describes a fragment of jaw with teeth of a fossil from the pleistocene deposits at the ** Cuddie Springs , " New South Wales , transmitted by E. S. Wilkinson , Esq. , of the Department of Mines , Sydney .
A series of comparisons are detailed with known recent and fossil Saurians , and the microscopic test is applied to the tissues of the bone and tooth .
i The conclusion arrived at is that the fossil was part of a lacertian reptile , equal in size to the Megalania , but of carnivorous habits ; distinct from the largest existing toothed and pleurodont lizard { Hydrosaurus giganteus .
' ) Eor the much larger extinct pleurodont Saurian the author proposes the name Notiosaurus dentatus .
