Account of the Discovery of a new Comet .
By -Miss Caroline Herschel .
In a Letter to Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. K. B. P. R. S. Read November 12 , 1795 .
SIR , Slough , November 8 , Fags .
LAST night , in sweeping over a part of the heavens with my 5-feet reflector , I met with a telescopic comet .
To point out its situation I transcribe my Brother 's observations upon it from his Journal .
November 7 , 1795 .
Oh 33 ' Sidereal time .
Place of the comet 2 , 20 ' np .
37 ( v ) Cygni , in a line continued from 66 ( u ) through y nearly .
It is just visible to the naked eye .
Oh 41 ' .
It is in a line between two small stars at a considerable distance from each other , to which are perpendicular the two extreme stars of three other stars , that form a small arch approaching to a straight line .
oh 49 ' .
The comet precedes the point in the line where the perpendicular of the arch crosses the line of the two stars one-fifth of the distance of the bisecting point from the preceding star .
1h 25 ' .
The comet is visibly moved from the place where it was oh 49t The direction of its motion seems to be towards the south preceding side , and it is about 5 or 6 ' removed from its former place .
1h 51 .
The diameter of the comet is about A ' .
It has no kind of nucleus , and has the appearance of an ill-defined haziness , which is rather strongest about the middle .
2h 16 ' .
The comet is about 2o 38 ' np y , in a line continued from 69 through 37 Cygni .
3h 37 .
The comet is about 2ยง 5o ' np Y , in a line continued from 65 through 37 Cygni , or , perhaps more accurate , in a line from 70 continued through 37 Cygni .
It will probably pass between the head of the Swan and the constellation of the Lyre , in its descent towards the sun .
The direction of its motion is retrograde .
Place of the comet deduced from the above .
h0 hi 0 sXI Nov._7l 33 RA 20 3 48 PD 49 17 18.____ 371 20 o 81 49 37 18 As the appearance of one of these objects is almost become a novelty , I flatter myself that this intelligence will not be uninteresting to astronomers .
I have the honour to be , &amp;c. CAROLINA HERSCHEL .
all Additional Observations on the Comet .
By William Herschel , LL. D. FP .
R. S. November 8 , 1795 .
oh io ' .
The comet is about 42 ' north of 22 Cygni , in a line continued from 21 ( 3 ) through 22 nearly ; it is not quite come to the line .
It is exactly in a line with 22 and a north following star 10 3 from 22 towards 21. .
oh 31 ' .
Distance of the comet from l9 Cygni , 10 1o ' .
From 22 Cygni , about 42 ' .
From 25 Cygni , 20 io ' .
From,1 Cygni , exactly 30 211 27 ' .
The comet is 36 ' from 22 Cygni ; its motion has been very nearly in the line pointed out before .
It will however not pass over 22 , but go by it towards 19 Cygni , having left the line pointed out , a little on the following side .
November 9 , 1795 .
20h 45 ' .
The comet is about 17 or 18 ' from id Cygni .
2lh 59 ' .
The comet is now centrally upon a small star north following 1s Cygni .
It is a small telescopic star of about the 11th or 12th magnitude , and is double , very unequal , the smallest of the two being much smaller than the largest .
With a power of 287 I can see the smallest of the two stars perfectly well ; this shows how little density there is in the comet , which is evidently nothing but what may be called a collection of vapours .
Angle of the small north following star with respect to 15 Cygni , 71O 55 north following .
Position of the small star belonging to the double star , a few degrees south following .
The north following star must be of the 11th or 12th magi nitude at least , for it is not visible in my achromatic finder , and its smaller companion therefore is an extremely small star indeed .
The double star is about 5 or 6 ' from Ad Cygni .
November io , 1795 .
21h 55 ' .
The comet is about 1 ' A ' north of , and a little following , 8 Cygni , and exactly 1 go ' south following 4 Cygni .
2h 16 ' .
The comet is about 4o ' from 8 Cygni , in the line between 8 and 4 , but rather past the line .
It is about 1o 26 ' from 4 Cygni .
