) In a paper recently published by one of us , on some mineral constituents of a dusty atmosphere* as determined both by flame and spark spectra , the lines most commonly occurring were described as either the ultimate groups or simply the ultimate lines of calcium , magnesium , aluminium , lead , manganese , copper , and nickel .
A brief account was given of the method employed in determining the weights of matter necessary to give the calcium and copper lines in the spark , and it was shown that the tests for lead , manganese , and magnesium are more delicate than those for calcium and copper , and these again are more sensitive than either the yellow flame or the spark spectrum for sodium .
M. de Gramont has given a list of the ultimate lines of some of the elements* !
* and remarks that the ultimate rays are generally the same for spectra taken from the condensed spark , with or without self-inductance , for the spark without condenser , for the arc , and for flames at high temperatures when the reaction is a very sensitive one .
There are , however , so many important exceptions that it is necessary to ascertain the ultimate lines of the same elements when the spectra are produced in different ways .
The wave-length of the ultimate line observed in any spectrum depends upon whether the observations are made with the eye only , or by photography , and when by photography , it depends upon the sensitiveness of the photographic plate .
In the oxyhydrogen flame spectra , which seldom extend beyond X 3000 when photographed , the ultimate lines are , as a rule , found to be in a region of less refrangibility than when , with the same element , condensed sparks are employed .
Thus in flame spectra , with the Mecke burner , or oxyhydrogen flame , the ultimate line of calcium is that in the blue , 4226*9 ; in spark spectra , the ultimate line is X 3933*8 , the penultimate line is 3968*9 .
In flame spectra observed by the eye , the ultimate line of lithium is in the red , X 6708 ; by * Hartley , 'Roy .

39 photography , it is in the blue , \4603 , but by using panchromatic plates it is again in the red .
The actual quantities of matter which render the ultimate lines in various spectra are of great importance , as they differ widely .
The differences are due to the emissive intensity of the rays , and to the volatility of the elements in the flame or spark .
The delicacy of the spectrum reaction of flames , though dependent on the volatility of a substance and the intensity of action , chemical or physical , of the emitted rays and the sensitiveness of the plate , is not increased in proportion to the increase of temperature in the flame .
Thus , though the temperature of the acetylene and oxygen blow-pipe flame is higher than that of the oxyhydrogen flame , yet the efficiency of the latter is greater than that of the former , by reason of the greater facility with which it effects the chemical reduction of oxides and oxy-salts.* The Ultimate Lines in the Oxyhydrogen Flame Spectra of Solid Substances Volatilised in the Flame , with the Quantities of the Elements which render the Lines .

Ultimate [ Apr. 15 , The quantities of the elements which render the ultimate lines in the oxyhydrogen flame have been carefully determined ( see table on p. 39 ) .
The foregoing numbers have been applied to the quantitative analysis of minerals , also to slag and flue dust , the by-products of metallurgical operations .
The method of ascertaining the ultimate lines and quantities of matter volatilised in the spark when dry electrodes are used , is somewhat different and requires to be fully described .
Method of Photographing the Ultimate Lines in Spark Spectra of the Elements Obtained from Dry Electrodes .
Attempts were made to ascertain the ultimate line or lines by exposing the plate in the spectrograph to the light from the spark for very short periods , which were regulated by means of a Goerz sector shutter placed immediately in front of the slit of the spectrograph .
It was found , however , that although the shutter measured very accurate intervals of time , yet , owing to the intermittent nature of the spark discharge , it was quite impossible to obtain consistent results .
For example , if the shutter were set to give an exposure of 1/ 20 sec. duration , the plate might receive the light of from one to five discharges the number depending upon the speed of the " hammer " break of the induction coil , and upon the instant of release of the shutter .
In order to obviate these disadvantages an arrangement was made whereby either a single discharge or a definite number of discharges could be obtained .
The contacts of the hammer break of the coil were insulated from each other by a piece of ebonite , and were connected by wires to a switch , which consisted of a copper contact pivoted so that it could be immersed in a mercury cup .
The copper contact and the mercury of the cup were connected to the terminals of the switch , and the copper contact was controlled by a spring in order that the circuit , when completed , might be rapidly broken .
In such an arrangement , each rapid release of the switch causes a discharge at the spark-gap , and the photographic plate can , in this way , be exposed to the spectra produced by any desired number of discharges .
The procedure adopted in most cases was to expose each plate to a number of discharges , descending from 20 or 30 to 1 , and thus eliminate all but the most persistent lines .
In some cases , the effect of inserting a Hemsalech inductance in the secondary circuit was examined with a small number of discharges .
Its effect in such cases was to weaken the whole spectrum 1912 .

without making any notable change in its character , other than the removal of the air lines XX 4035*3 and 3995*3 .
These are the only lines of air ( nitrogen ) which appear in the spectrum given by a small number of discharges .
It is an interesting fact that , while these air lines appear in the case of some metals with the least number of discharges necessary to give the spectrum of the metal , with other metals there may be no trace of them for an even greater number of discharges .
A possible cause of this may be that the nitrogen combines with the metal .
Determinations of the smallest weight of material necessary to yield the ultimate lines of the elements were made in the following manner from dry electrodes:\#151 ; SparJc Spectra.\#151 ; With metallic calcium it was found that the loss of weight from both electrodes was 3-4 mgrm .
in passing the spark for .10 minutes , the number of discharges per second being 50-70 .
Taking the mean weight of calcium volatilised at 3*5 mgrm .
in 10 minutes , and the number of discharges as 60 per second , the quantity volatilised in one minute is 0*35 mgrm .
By further experiments it was found that , from the two electrodes of calcium , 0*004 grm. was volatilised in 10 minutes , this being the average of several weighings , which showed very small variations .
Therefore 0*0004 grm. is the weight volatilised in 60 seconds , or 0*00007 grm. is volatilised per second .
From 50 to 70 discharges occur per second , therefore the weight of calcium volatilised at each discharge from both electrodes is 0*00010-0*00014 mgrm .
From the negative electrode only , the weight volatilised in 10 minutes is 0*0026 grm. , and at each discharge 0*00006-0*00010 mgrm .
The lines in the calcium spectrum photographed were exclusively the following:\#151 ; X ( Eder and Valenta ) .

The metal was obtained by electrolysing a saturated solution of pure manganous chloride , employing a cathode of mercury weighing 1| kgrm .

Ultimate [ Apr. 15 , and a platinum anode .
A current from 4 to 5 amperes passed for about five hours was sufficient to convert the cathode into a stiff amalgam .
This was washed , and freed from an excess of mercury by pressure .
The metallic manganese was isolated by distilling off the mercury in a quartz tube filled with hydrogen , and fusing the residue by means of an oxy-coal-gas flame applied to the tube .
Solid points of the metal were submitted to the condensed spark .
The following list gives the very large number of 27 lines , which are rendered by only one spark discharge .
It includes three well-marked groups , each containing three lines:\#151 ; X. X. 4030*8 2889*5 4018*3 2719*0 3610*4 2701*7 n 3570*2 2672*8 3548*2 2663*3 3532*1 2632*5 ?

2939*4 2933*1 J ^ Group II .
2428*0 J 1 Groups I , II , and III are very well marked .
Group II is the strongest .
Several relatively strong lines occur between 2701*7 and 2576*2 , notably 2576*2 , 2594 , and 2618*2 , but the whole of the manganese lines situated between XA2701*7 and 2576*2 , which are indicated by a bracket , occur feebly .
The ultimate lines , and the quantity of manganese volatilised which is required to render them , was determined as follows:\#151 ; The condensed sparks were from 3 to 4 mm. long , without self-inductance .
The average weight of manganese volatilised from the two electrodes during 60 seconds was 0*00025 grm. , and per second 0*000004 grm. The number of discharges per second was from 50 to 70 , therefore the weight of manganese volatilised by one discharge lies between the limits of 0*00008 and 0*00006 mgrm .
The average weight volatilised from the negative electrode only , per 60 seconds , was 0*0002 grm. , and per second 0*000003 grm. ; at each discharge the quantity is 0*00006 to 0*00004 mgrm .

43 Determination of the Ultimate Lines of Manganese by Means of Manganese Amalgam .
When freed from excess of mercury by pressure the composition of the amalgam was determined by distilling in an atmosphere of hydrogen at a temperature below redness , whereby the mercury was entirely separated , and the manganese left as a metallic sponge .
Two determinations gave the percentage of manganese in the amalgam as 340 exactly .
Assuming the quantity of manganese volatilised in each discharge to be proportional to the concentration in the amalgam , we ascertain from previous experiments that when the amalgam is submitted to the spark about 0,000002 mgrm .
of manganese are volatilised at each discharge .
This quantity gives the group of three lines with wave-lengths 2949'3 , 29394 and 29334 , which are therefore the ultimate lines ; they are identical with Group II on the previous list .
They appear to be very feeble , but 2949-3 is the most distinct , and therefore the ultimate line .
With two discharges taken from the amalgam four groups of lines appear .
The following lines were measured :\#151 ; Manganese .

The Viscosity of Qarbon Dioxide .
By P. Phillips , D.Sc .
, B.A. ( Communicated by Prof. F. T. Trouton , F.R.S. Received April 18 , \#151 ; Read May 23 , 1912 .
) The viscosity of carbon dioxide was determined under considerable variation of \#166 ; temperature and pressure by Warburg and Babo* in 1882 , but their results are rather incomplete .
They determined a few viscosity-pressure isothermals at temperatures above the critical temperature , one such isothermal for the liquid at 25 ' C. , and a few values of the viscosity of the liquid under the pressure of its saturated vapour at different temperatures .
Recently E. N. da C. Andrade , working at University College , began to determine the viscosity of carbon dioxide at different temperatures under the critical pressure by a continuous flow method .
This involved the use of large quantities of CO2 , which he obtained in the usual trade cylinders , and which he kept at the critical pressure by immersing the cylinder in a bath at the critical temperature .
The cylinder communicated with the capillary tube , which was surrounded by water at any desired temperature , and through which the C02 was slowly allowed to escape into weighed potash bulbs .
The mass of C02 absorbed in a certain time gave the quantity of C02 flowing through the capillary tube per second , and a manometer gave * Warburg and Babo , ' Annalen der Physik und Chemie , ' 1882 , vol. 17 , p. 390 .
