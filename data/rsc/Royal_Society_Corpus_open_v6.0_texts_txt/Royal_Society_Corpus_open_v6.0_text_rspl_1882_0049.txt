Hitherto the only experiments concerning this subject have been made on animals , the degree of sensory excitation being estimated by the amount of reflex action produced.* During our experiments on the alteration of excitability in the motor nerves of man we had the * Zurhelle , " De Nervorum Sensitivorum Irritibilitate in Statu Electrotoni , " Berlin , 1864 .

3b7 ( opportunity of noticing the occurrence of apparently similar phenomena in the sensory nerves of the skin .
This fact led us to undertake a preliminary series of experiments , , of which we propose to give here the main results .
The methods we employed were precisely the same as those used for the investigation of the excitability of the motor nerves* One electrode of small size\#151 ; the exploring electrode\#151 ; was fixed over the 'nerve chosen for the experiment ; whilst the other electrode , of large Uze , rested on a distant part of the body .
In order to secure the j coincidence of the zones of polar alteration and of stimulation , the I polarising and testing currents were united in the same circuit .
1 phis is effected , when the induced current is used for testing the excitability , by including the secondary coil in the circuit of the polarising battery .
W^hen galvanic makes and breaks are so used , the current of the testing battery is thrown into the circuit of the polarising current without breaking the latter , by means of the double key of Helmholtz arranged in the usual manner .
The precautions we took for the elimination of errors arising from changes in the resistance of the body and in the current strengths during the experiments were either 1st , the galvanometric control of the currents used j 2nd , the intercalation of large additional resistances in the circuit ( viz. , 10,000 ohms , which is about 8 times the resistance of the human body under the conditions of our experiments ) .
The influence of any changes in that resistance would thereby be diminished in the same proportion , : We usually employed the method of minimal stimuli , first noting the current strength required to produce , by its action on the normal nerve , a reaction in consciousness ; then finding the changes of the current strength necessary to produce the same effect during and after polarisation , anodic and kathodic .
Two points of importance with reference to such experiments may briefly be alluded to here :\#151 ; First , the necessity of carefully distinguishing between the continuous sensation produced by the polarising current when it has reached a certain intensity ; second , the necessity of using a uniform rhythm of excitation , owing to the readiness with which stimuli summate in the sensory nerves of man .
The sensations are referred either to the portion of the skin immediately under the electrode or to the parts supplied by peripheral distribution of the nerve .
In experiments on mixed nerve-trunks care must be taken to eliminate the possible admixture of sensations due to muscular contractions .
Our general conclusion is , that during and after the passage of a galvanic current the alterations in the excitability of the sensory * " Proc. Roy .

[ Dec. 7 nerves of man follow a course essentially similar to those observed ii the motor nerves .
Proof by Makes and Breaks of a Galvanic Current .
1 .
The effect of a make excitation is increased by the kathodic influence of the polarising current .
This effect is , as usual , mor\lt ; marked in the polar zone ( where the density is greater ) than in the peripolar , and increases , within physiological limits , with the strengtl of the polarising current .
Placing the neutral electrode on the back and the exploring electrode over one of the cutaneous nerves at the wrist we obtained the !
following numbers .
No external resistance was used , but the galvanometer showed that no change of resistance in the circuit took place during the experiment:\#151 ; Strength of polarising current 0 2 4 6 f 8 i Strength of current necessary to produce minimal sensation expressed in number of"1 cells ^In polar 1 zone j 9 6 5 4 2 In peri-j3olar zone }io 8 6 5 3 [ 2 .
The effect of a break excitation in the polar zone is rapidly !
diminished and abolished by the anodic influence of the polarising , current .
( Owing to the strength of current required this can scarcely !
be ascertained for the peripolar zone .
) Arranging our electrodes as in the experiment first described , we !
take a current of thirty cells , which gives a distinct sensation ati break .
We then introduce a polarising current gradually increased .
] The sensation becomes rapidly fainter , and disappears altogether when the polarising current has reached five or six cells .
Proof by Induction Currents .
1 .
The effect of induction shocks is increased when the excitation falls upon the kathodic zone of the polarising current .
A series of experiments made with the testing electrode placed ( according to the method above described ) on various superficial nerves gave the following numbers ; they are derived from experiments made with and without additional resistance ( the numbers obtained having been reduced in the latter case ) .
For the sake of comparison we also give the numbers obtained from experiments on motor nerves .

The effect of induction shocks is at first diminished , then m'creases to normal , or above normal , when the excitation falls upon the anodic zone of the polarising current .
We suppose this effect , which is the same as that observed on the motor nerve , to be due to an invasion of the anelectrotonic by the katelectrotonic influence when the polarising current is increased beyond a certain strength .
This invasion takes place more readily from the polar into the peripolar .zone , than in the opposite sense .

The galvanometer showed that the variations in the effect were unaccompanied by any changes in the resistances in circuit .
With reference to the after-effects of which the accurate determination offers considerable difficulties , we content ourselves with stating here that they appear to consist in an increase of excitability both after anodic and kathodic influence , preceded in the latter case by a short but appreciable diminution when the polarisation has been long and strong enough .
