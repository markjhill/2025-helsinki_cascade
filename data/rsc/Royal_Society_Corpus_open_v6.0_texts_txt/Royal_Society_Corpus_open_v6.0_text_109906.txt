] In several species of serpents which were examined by Dr. Davy , the kidneys were nearly as large as the liver , long , narrow and lobulated , and without a pelvis .
Each lobule sends a small duct to the ureter , which terminates in a papilla situated in the cloaca , between the mouths of the oviducts , and having its point directed towards a receptacle for the urine , which , though a continuation of the intestine , may be considered as distinct from the rectum and cloaca , with which it communicates only by sphincter orifices .
The urinary ducts often contain a white matter , visible through their coats , which gradually accumulates in the receptacle till it forms a mass which , when of so large a size as to distend the part , is usually expelled by an extraordinary effort of the animal , most commonly in the act of devouring its food .
The urine , at first soft , gradually hardens by exposure , and then looks like chalk ; it consists of nearly pure uric acid .
The author next relates his experiments and observations upon the urine and urinary organs of lizards .
He examined four species , the gecko , iguana , the kobbera-guion , ( described by Knox , ) and the alligator .
The kidneys vary in size ; each ureter has a papilla situated in the receptacle ; in other respects the structure resembles that of snakes .
The secretion is also nearly similar ; that of the alligator contains , besides uric acid , carbonate and phosphate of lime ; in one case it smelt strongly like musk .
In two species of the testudo , Dr. Davy found the kidneys lobulated like those of the preceding animals .
In the bladder both of the turtle and tortoise he found flakes of uric acid in a transparent liquid , containing mucus and common salt , but no urea .
