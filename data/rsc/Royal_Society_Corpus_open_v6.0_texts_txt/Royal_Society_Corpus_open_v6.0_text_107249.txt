inflammation .
In a case of hemorrhage from one of the sinuses of the brain , a very judicious physician lately prescribed the digitalis : if the effect of this medicine tends principally to diminish the action of the heart , as is commonly supposed , it was more likely to be injurious than beneficial , since a venous plethora must be increased by the inactivity of the heart ; but if the digitalis diminishes the general tension of the arteries , in a greater proportion than it affects the motion of the heart , it may possibly be advantageous in venous hemorrhages .
We have , however , no sufficient authority for believing , that it has any such effect on the arterial system in general .
Although the arguments , which I have advanced , appear to me sufficient to prove , that , in the ordinary state of the circulation , the muscular powers of the arteries have very little effect in propelling the blood , yet I neither expect nor desire that the prevailing opinion should at once be universally abandoned .
I wish , however , to protest once more against a hasty rejection of my theory , from a superficial consideration of cases , like that which has been related by Dr. CLARKE ; and to observe again , that the objections , which I have adduced , against the operation of the muscular powers of the arteries in the ordinary circulation , not being applicable to these cases , they are by no means weakened by any inferences which can be drawn from them .
