( Abstract .
) Attention is drawn to numerous irregularly distributed black lines which are to be seen in gold leaf examined with the microscope by transmitted light .
These lines are shown to depend on the presence of minute wires or threads of the metal , unconnected with its crystalline structure , but produced in the process of gold beating by the stretching , along lines of weakness , of the animal membrane between sheets of which the gold is placed , thus developing minute trough-like Avrinkles into which the soft metal is forced .
The results are given of an examination of the absorption spectrum \#151 ; in the visible , ultra-violet and infra-red regions\#151 ; of metallic gold in a finely divided condition , as found in gold-coloured glass , and as reduced from dilute aqueous solutions of its salts .
