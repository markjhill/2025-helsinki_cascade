Conmmunicated by the Astronomer Royal .
Read March 28th , 18 o. DEAR SIR , Blackheath , 22 d January , 1810 .
THE great advantages we derive from the labours and writings of those learned men , who have preceded us ; the profound researches in physical astronomy by the mathematicians of the last century ; and the improvements in the construction of instruments , effected by the ingenuity of our modern artists : these circumstances should stimulate all those who have inclination and opportunity , to the endeavour of contributing to the common stock of knowledge .
I beg leave to add my tribute of admiration to the general voice , for the large share you , Sir , have taken in the promotion of science , not only by your learned publications , but also by the liberal encouragement and assistance you have given to those who have been honoured with your acquaintance .
I am , therefore , induced to commit to your protection the enclosed paper , acknowledging myself indebted to your friendly communications for much useful information .
I could have wished the task had been performed at an earlier period ; but as you are well acquainted with the labour required in the reduction of so many observations by one person , it will appear to have been impracticable .
I remain , Dear Sir , Your obliged and very obedient servant , STEPHEN GROOMBRIDGE .
To the Rev. Dr. Maskelyne , Astronomer Royal , 4'c .

WAHEN I had fixed my four feet transit circle , made by TROUGHTON , it was my intention to make observations of a sufficient number of circumpolar stars , at different altitudes , to ascertain the latitude of my observatory with the greater precision ; and also to endeavour to settle the true quantity of refraction : especially as my instrument was better adapted for that purpose , both from the construction and convenient size thereof , than those which had been heretofore made .
Being fixed on stone piers , it is not so liable to partial expansion , as those instruments which are supported on brass frames : and having both sides divided , with two microscopes to each face ; the same observation has the advantage of four made with a quadrant .
I have also contrived , by means of sliding shutters in the roof , to prevent the rays of the sun from falling on any part , excepting on the object glass .
By these means I flatter myself that , the observations having been made with great care and attention , the result will prve both satisfactory and useful .
Hlaving proposed to myself the above course of observations , I selected the fifty stars contained in the first table for that purpose , the observations of which , exceed in number Cc G -1 .
1ooo .
On the quantity of refraction to be assumed at 45S , astronomers not having been agreed , and Dr. MASKELYNE having suggested in the precepts to his folio tables , that Dr. BRADLEY having supposed the sun 's parallax 1 o " , from which he inferred the refraction at 45 ?
to be 57 " ; if he had used the true parallax 8 ?
- " , he would have found the refraction at the altitude of 45 ?
to be 56- .
I therefore assumed , and have constantly applied that quantity , correcting the same for the barometer and thermometer : the whole by the formula of Dr. BRADLEY .
In the above table , the third column is the mean of the observed zenith distance corrected by the equations to ist Jan. 1807 ; the fourth is the mean of the computed refraction , for each observation ; the sixth is the sum of the third and fourth columns , which gives the mean double zenith distance of the Pole , according to the assumed refraction in the seventh column ; the eighth is the correction of the assumed refraction by the factor found , o2845 , which is applied to the seventh column , and gives the true double zenith distance of the Pole in the ninth , the half of which is the corrected co-latitude in the tenth column .
It appears that so far as Ursae majoris , the sum or difference of the zenith distances in the seventh column are sufficiently uniform to be used for the correction of thq refraction .
I then proceed to compare the first thirteen stars , where the zenith distance below the Pole is less than 6o ?
, with the twenty-one following .
From the former thirteen , the mean of the seventh column is 770 3 ' 53 " , 0908 ; and the mean sum of the refractions in the fifth column is,949377 ; from the lattertwenty-one the means of the same oluamns arei '77 ? ?

I have preferred the former , from the greater number of observations to be so obtained , as well as from the more accurate bisection of a star , than the application of a wire to the limb of the sun ; I have , however , endeavoured to render the observations of the sun , of equal consequence , by means of two fixed , and one moveable wire ; the latter measures a space to one of the fixed wires , distant 29 451,74 from the other , the sum of which is the diameter ; the suna passing at the same time through the centre of the field .
These wires are applied to the upper and lower linbs .
of the sun , by direct vision , the eye glass having a vertical , as well as a horizontal motion .
The centre of the sun is found , , knowing the distance of the extreme fixed wires , from that in the centre of the field ; but the refraction must be applied ' for each limb , the difference of refraction at the winter sol-P stice being 8 " ; therefore this diminution of the diameter must , be noticed .
The few opportunities I have had to observe the : solstices , have produced only eighteen observations at the summer , and thirteen at the winter , solstice .
The p !

I shall nowx compare the observations of Lieut. Col. MUDGE , made at the Royal Observatory in 1802 , with his zenith sector , to ascertain the dif-erence of latitude between that place and my observatory : the following stars being reduced to the same epoch 3y 45 , 46 , 5 1 , Draconis ; x , , Cygni ; y , q , Urs maj , rs ; , i. reulis , and Capella .
The mean difference of the z.enith distances of these stars , and my own observations , 1is q,49 ; which beig ad ded to my latitude , shows the latitlde of the Royal Observatory to be 51 ? ?
28 ' 37,159 ; 194 and this subtense of the arc agrees very nearly with that of y Draconis , by Dr. MASKELYNE , which he has communicated to me , being 35 , '31 .
Several of those made by Lieut. Col , MUDGE were single observations , with the zenith sector in one position only , and therefore were reduced by the mean collimation , found from the other stars ; but the result shows the accuracy of his observations .
The latitude of Greenwich , when corrected from the mean of circular instruments , as proposed by Mr. POND , and by the refraction for the excess of 57 " , will not differ more than half a second , from the above determination .
Having found by this hypothesis , the mean astronomical refraction at 45 ?
, I shall proceed to cormpare the same , with the observations of other astronomers .
M. PIAZZI has very ingeniously , and with great labour , made his deduction of the mean refraction , from the observations of Procyon , a Lyra : and Aldebaran at equal altitudes , from 38 ?
to 890 go ' zenith : distance , in addition to several circumpolar stars , for his latitude : this advantage having been obtained from his instrument moving in azimuth .
The result thereof gives the mean refraction at 450 ?

therefore , slhews in his table of mean refractions , that at 450-= 5 ; 7 , x tang .
453 r= 57 , " ; which will be = 58 " , o in my table .
On a comparison .
with the present French tables , the latter give 58 , " , at 450 , which is in excess of my own .
The formula of M. DE LA PLACE , as given in his MIecanique Celeste , which is very elaborate and ingenious , being applied ; to a constant quantity , 6o , " 616 , as determinedfrom .
obser.vation , will produce a table of refractions , nearly the same as Dr. BRADLEY 's , though the latter is effected by a more simple formula .
M. PIAZZI has shown from his observations , that the actual refractions , so far as 800 from the zenith , are greater.than those assumed by Dr. BRADLEY ; and thence to the horizon , the formula of the latter produces an excess , therefore requires a reduction in the quantity .
The ninth and tenth columns of the above fifty stars , will show the same result as that of M. PIAZZI ; viz. that below 80 ?
the assumed refraction is greater than will be given from observation : and the mean correction required for the four last stars , from 870 to 89 ?
, will be 0,027 , which he determnineso , o29 .
Those stars from the zenith to 80 ?
, I have already corrected , by assuming a greater constant quantity ; whence it follows , that all those equations will be plus , as compared with Dr. BRADLEY ; but this will not happen with those at lower altitudes , since his formula thence fails : and it is the correction thereof , which I shall next proceed to investigate .
This problem of the mean refractions , so important to practical astronomy , which has occupied the attention of many mathematicians , has always had in view , to reconcile the known laws of the refraction of a ray of light passing through different media , with the actual quantity deduced from observation .
The investigations of various authors are given in the first volume of Mr. VINcE 's Astronomy ; and that of Mr. SIMPSON , in his Mathematical Dissertations .
It has been proved , that the refractions vary nearly as the tangents of zenith distance , into a constant quantity ; and assuming the variation directly as the tangents , the approximation will not be sensibly affected so far as 60 ?
; but comparing these , with those at lower altigtudes , as found from observation , it will appear that the refractions vary , as the tangents of zenith distance , minus some multiple , of r ( the refraction ) , which call y. Now the value of y will be found by the formula drawn from the investigation given at large in Mr. VINCE 's Astronomy , by comparing the observed refraction , at different zenith distances , putting r refraction , a= zenith distance of the highest star ; r ' and a ' of the lowest star : then rX cot .
a r ' X cot .
a lr'r _ rz Applying this formula to the mean refraction of Polaris below the pole = 49",05 , compared with the corrected or observed refraction of each of the last three stars ; the mean value of y= 3,3625 .
Dr. BRADLEY found by comparing the refraction at 60 ?
with that at 0 ?
, which he supposed 33 ' o ' , the value of y=2,996 ; he therefore assumed 3 .
M. CASSINI found the same to be 3,226 ; M. BOUGUER 3,323 ; and Mr. SIMPSON 2,75 : this difference arises from their having supposed the horizontal refraction greater than it appears to be from observation .
In the dissertation of the last author , he proves , that above 7 ?
altitude , it matters not whether you assume the refraction , according as it would be found from the increased density of the air , at the low altitudes , and which would give the refraction at 9o ?
about 52 ' , or by an uniform density , which agrees better with observation ; since , in the former case , it would only affect the refraction about two seconds .
Having thus assumed a greater value of y , than 3 , for the coefficient of r , the mean refraction at 450 will vary inversely , as tang .

45D yr The table of mean refractions by the proposed formula , comn pared with the observed refraction , differs with the lowest star , less than 2 " ; but the refractions at those low altitudes having always been found uncertain , we may presume that the result so nearly approximates the truth , that we may not possibly ascertain the refractions more correctly .
However , since my deduction will soon be submitted to the test of some excellent circular instruments , it will be seen , whether more accurate tables can be formed .
M. BIOT , in the report of the National Institute , observes , that a third correction of the refractions having been supposed to arise from the vapours at low altitudes , and therefore an equation might be found from the hygrometer , he was induced to make some experiments with a prism containing warm air dried by potash , the outside of which was charged with the natural moisture of the atmosphere ; but he could discover no alteration in the refraction .
He consequently infers , that the hygrometrical state of the atmosphere has no sensible effect on the refractions .
Supposing an effect really to exist , a standard hygrometer would be required ; since those instruments , which show the comparative state of humidity or siccity of the atmosphere , give no scale of the velocity of the current of air which causes the change .
The mean astronomical refraction being determined in this manner , it will be further necessary to investigate the equations for the barometer and thermometer ; and I must premise , that I have always applied those for the latter , from the temperature shown by the thermometer attached to the telescope .
Some astronomers have applied the correction for the external temperature , others for the mean of both ; but I believe 198 the majority have adopted the temperature within the observatory .
It is to be regretted , that astronomers have not informed us , by what methods they have deduced these corrections of the mean refractions ; I shall therefore explain that which I have adopted , in order that this hypothesis may be investigated ; and any error therein , be the more easily detected .
I have taken all those stars in the table , below the Pole , from p Ursae majoris to ?
Aurige , both inclusive , having noticed that those observations made in winter , when the correction is additive , the assumed correction by Dr. BRADLEY'S formula appears to be too great ; and this difference will be seen by the comparison in Tables II .
and III .
To these I have added Fomalhaut , containing in the whole 2lo observations .
Having determined the mean place of the star at a certain epoch , I find the apparent place ; the difference between which and the observed place , is the apparent refraction , which call a ; put b= mean refraction , c= to the correction for the barometer , and w -= to the correction for the thermometer : then a-b b The following observation of a Cygni will suffice for an example .

Proceeding in this manner with the above 2 io observations , I obtained equations for the thermometer within , from 1i to and for the thermometer without , from 24 to 8o .
The difference of these extremes being divided by 8 , will show the corrections for the former to every 6 ?
, and for the latter to every 7 ?
; and assuming that the variations are in a reciprocal ratio to the degrees of the thermometer , I propose the following formula .
Putting h for the degree of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer , then 49 ?
-h x,0024 , when below the mean ; 490 h ?
x,00oo3 when above the mean ; will be the correction for the thermometer within ; and 450 hx,0oo2 , the correction for the thermometer without .
The Tables II .
and IlI .
show the near agreement of the observed and the equated factor , found as above .
The barometer at its mean state may continue to be taken at 29,6 inches ; and the mean point of the thermometer without , will then be at 45 ? .
The thermometer within , which has been assumed at 500 for the mean state , from observation , appears to be at 49 ?
; and supposing the barometer and thermometer to vary reciprocally , as the former in inches and the latter in degrees , the mean point of each is in an inverse ratio to the other , and might be changed if thought expedient .
Indeed it appears from the mean of more than looo observations of these circumpolar stars , at all seasons , that the mean state of the barometer is 29,85 , and of the thermometer 52 ?
; yet , as the sum of the two corrections would still be the same , there cannot be occasion to alter the mean point of the former , especially as this might not be a general rule for every climate .
It has very rarely happened , that I could make any observation , when the barometer has been below 29 inches , which causes the mean state to be so high as 29,85 ; but it may be otherwise in places , where the atmosphere is not so charged with vapours , as that of this country .
I have , in the Table IV .
shown the mean refractions , according to various authors ; the first column contains those of Mr. SIMPSON , from the observations of Dr. BEVIS ; the second , those of Dr. BRADLEY , by his formula , tang .
zrx 57 " ; but this quantity having been found , from later observations , to have been too small ; the third column contains the same formula , into 58",107 ; yet the refractions , at low altitudes , will be found too great , and this excess has been corrected by M. PIAZZI , using arbitrary equations , which will bring them nearer to the truth , as shown in the fourth column .
The more uniform correction of the whole will be , as I have proposed in the above theorem , by increasing the coefficient of r ; a corollary from which will be drawn , that the increment of the tangents near the horizon will cause the equations of M. PIAzzI to vanish .
The fifth column contains the refractions of the French tables ; and the sixth , my own ; viz. tang .
z 33625r x 58",119. .
On inspection of this table , it will appear , that the refractions by different formula do not vary considerably , so far as 80 ?
; and thence to 87 ?
, my deductions are rather in excess of the French tables ; below which , mine are rather less .
Whether this arises from the defect of the formula , I cannot determine ; since the wall of Greenwich park being above my horizon , I cannot observe lower than 88- ?
: however , so far as 88 ?
, the formula I have proposed , agrees with observation .
