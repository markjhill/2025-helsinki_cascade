] in Mus , so that the malleus more resembles that of Lepus .
The stapes of this family has generally long , slender , and not very divergent crura , and the intercrural canal is wanting .
In the Hystricidse the great feature is the ankylosis of the malleus to the incus , already well known to zoologists .
It is almost invariable in the adults of that family .
The manubrium is very broad , and the inner edge above the processus muscularis is very thick .
The varieties among the different genera are trifling : the head of the malleus is produced forwards to an extreme degree in -Aula and particularly in Chinchilla , but less so in the porcupines and the agouti .
The stapes is always proportionally small , with stout and not very divergent crura ; a bony intercrural canal occurs in many genera , but is an inconstant feature in individual specimens of the same species .
As the ankylosis of the two outer ossicles occurs in Dipus , whilst the head of the malleus remains small and unproduced , and that bone possesses a wide lamina , it must be considered intermediate , as far as those little bones are concerned , between the Muridae and Hystricidse .
As occurs in other orders , the fossorial members of the Eodentia present great peculiarities in their ear-bones .
In Geomys the malleus somewhat resembles that of Marmotta ; the stapes is remarkable for the large bulla on its base .
Rhizomys and Ellobius approximate most to the rats , Bathyergus to the Hystricidse , which it exceeds in the degree of fusion of the malleus to the incus , which latter bone , however , differs in form from the same in that family .
In Sp the malleus approaches the more central type of Castor or Lepus .
but the stapes is of a very unique type , somewhat similar to that of Chrysochloris , except that one crus is quite straight and very divergent .
In both species of Elephaht the large ossicula appear rather like the modified ear-bones of certain rodents than like any ungulate .
There is neither the lamina or long manubrium mallei , nor the thick and divergent processus brevis incudis , nor the quadrilateral stapes frequent among the large Ungulata ; on the other hand the short , broad-based manubrium , the thin , short , and hardly divergent processus brevis of the incus , and the wide intercrural aperture of the stapes are characteristic in Elephas and common among the Eodentia .
In the Hyraces the ear-bones bear a slight affinity to those of the horse , but none of any importance to the common types among the Ungulata or Eodentia .
The ossicles of the remaining groups of the Mammalia will be described in a subsequent communication .

1.\#151 ; The first of these remarkable minerals contains 28 per cent , of vanadium pentoxide .
It was forwarded to me by Dr. James Blake , Mr. H. E. Roscoe on [ June 15 , of San Francisco , with the following statement:\#151 ; " I discovered it in a gold-mine , and it serves as the matrix for the gold .
It occurs in small bunches , filling cavities in a schistose porphyry .
The mineral occurs in radiating and foliated talc-like masses , greenish grey in bulk , and light greenish yellow when seen in fragments , forming a grey powder .
Its lustre is subvitreous to fatty .
In mass it is opaque , but is translucent in thin splinters .
Its hardness is about equal to that of talc ; its specific gravity is 2*902 .
Blowpipe reactions.\#151 ; When heated in thin splinters the mineral fuses easily to a black non-magnetic bead .
In a closed tube a little water is given off .
With borax and microcosmic salt the reactions of vanadium and silica are obtained .
It is only partially attacked by acids .

] The vanadate of aluminium and the ferric oxide precipitated together by acetate of ammonium are separated by fusion with sodium carbonate and subsequent boiling with water .
The vanadic acid in the acidified solution is then reduced by sulphur dioxide , the liquid well boiled , and the vanadium estimated volumetrically by means of potassium permanganate .
The larger portion of the vanadium remains in solution after the addition of ammonium acetate , and this is precipitated as lead metavanadate by the addition of lead acetate solution .
The lead salt is dissolved in nitric acid , and the lead thrown down by sulphuretted hydrogen , the filtrate on evaporation yielding pure vanadium pentoxide , which after ignition is weighed .
This method was likewise made use of for the separation of vanadium in the portion of mineral which served for the estimation of the alkalies .
A direct assay of the vanadium was made by heating 0*5105 grm. of the mineral with strong sulphuric acid , diluting with water , reducing with a current of sulphur dioxide , and titrating with a standard solution of permanganate of 1 cub. centim.=0*00534 grm. of metallic iron .
Of this solution 17*3 cub. centims. were needed ; this corresponds to 29*5 per cent , of vanadium pentoxide , the change of oxidation being from V204 to Vo05 .
From this must , however , be deducted the amount of vanadium pentoxide equivalent to 1*13 per cent , of ferric oxide ; this leaves 28*21 per cent , of V2Og , an amount closely approximating to that ( 28*6 ) obtained by analysis .
Dr. James Blake , in his communication referred to above , states :\#151 ; " At the suggestion of my friend Professor Gibbs , I propose to name the mineral Boscoelite , should the name not be already appropriated .
" No. 2.\#151 ; The second vanadium mineral , to which I propose to give the name of Mottramite , occurs as a crystalline incrustation on Keuper sandstone found at Alderley Edge and at Mottram St. Andrew 's , in Cheshire , and at other localities .
The incrustation is usually very thin ; but occasionally it becomes 3 or 4 millimetres in thickness , and in one or two cases masses almost the size of a walnut have been found .
Sometimes the incrustation has a black velvety appearance , and consists of numerous extremely small crystals , so minute that their form has not yet been ascertained .
More commonly , however , the mineral possesses a compact character .
The crystals are black by reflected light , but very thin particles are sub-translucent and transmit yellow light .
The compact mineral is purplish brown and opaque .
The lustre of the crystals is resinous .
Streak yellow .
Hardness of compact portion about that of calc-spar .
Specific gravity 5*894 .
Behaviour before the blowpipe.\#151 ; In the closed tube a little water is evolved on heating , and the mineral fuses very easily .
On asbestos it fuses easily and slightly tinges the flame green .
Heated on charcoal with sodium carbonate in reducing flame , a yellow incrustation and grey malleable bead are obtained .

[ June 15 , adding ammonia in excess , a blue solution is obtained .
Heated with borax on platinnm wire in the oxidizing flame the bead is yellow when hot , then becomes green , and when cold is blue .
In the reducing flame the borax bead is bluish green , with a red skeleton of reduced copper .
Analysis.\#151 ; Two complete analyses of this mineral , freed as much as possible from the matrix , gave the following results Vanadium pentoxide I. 16-78 II .

In addition to the above constituents the mineral contains traces of arsenic , cobalt , and sodium .
Mottramite is interesting as forming the third term in a second ( doubtless ) isomorphous group of phosphates , arsenates , and vanadates corresponding to the well-known pyromorphite , mimetesite , and vana-dinite group .

The crystalline form of these three minerals remains yet to be determined .
