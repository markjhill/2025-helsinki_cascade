[ Dec. 5 , the potential difference to be measured .
The general working of the intrnment is also considered , and numerical results and curves are given for the electrometer used by the authors .
In Appendix II is considered the question of the redaction of the readings to absolute measure , or , in other words , the calculation of the effective area of the attracted disk .
Starting from an expression given by Professor J. J. Thomson , a formula is deduced for the effective area of the disk when in the plane of the guard-ring , which is probably more accurate than that given by Maxwell .
It is then shown that , in addition to the well-known advantages of the heterostatic over the idiostatic method of measurement , there is the additional advantage that the error in the ordinary assumption as to the value of the effective area is of far less importance in the former than in the latter method .
Finally an investigation is given in which Schwarz 's method is applied to determine the error in the ordinary assumption as to the value of the effective area for the case w'hen the disk and guard-rihg are not quite in the same plane .
