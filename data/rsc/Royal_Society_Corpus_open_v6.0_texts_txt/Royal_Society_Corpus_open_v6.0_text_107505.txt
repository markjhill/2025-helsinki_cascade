On some new Methods of investigating the Sums of several Classes of infinite Series .
By Charles Babbage , Esq. A.M. F. R. S. Read April i , 1819 .
1 HE processes which it is the object of this paper to explain , were discovered several years since ; but certain difficulties connected with the subject , which I was at that time unable to explain , and which were equally inexplicable to several of my friends , to whom I had communicated these methods , induced me to defer publishing them , until I could offer some satisfactory solution .
These observations refer more particularly to the second method which I have detailed in this paper , and which may not inappropriately be called the method of expanding horizontally and summing vertically .
Some traces of this method may , perhaps , be found in former writers , and particularly in a paper by Professor Vince , " On the Summation of Series , " printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1791 ; but there exists this peculiarity in that which I have employed , that after a certain number of the vertical columns are summed , all the remainder either vanish , or else have some common factor .
This method , which I employed about the year 1812 , gave the values of a variety of series whose sums had not hitherto been known , most of which were apparently correct , but some of the consequences which followed were evidently erroneous .
About this time , Mr. HERSCHEL , to whom I had communicated these anomalous results , by following a very different course , arrived at several general theorems , which , when applied to the series I had obtained , gave the same results .
This coincidence at first increased my confidence in the values so discovered , and I continued to examine the reason why my own formule were in some cases defective .
Mr. HERSCHEL'S method was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1814 ; and it was not until some time after that I perceived , that although the investigations were very different , the fundamental principle was the same in both methods .
This induced me to attempt summing the same series by a direct process , and I succeeded in obtaining their sums by integration relative to finite differences , aided by certain peculiar artifices .
The results obtained by this ilew plan , which is the first treated of in this paper , coincided with those already found , and seemed to confirm their truth , without in the least indicating the cause of the error : this cause however I now began to suspect , and , after some enquiry , I was at length able to detect , I have found that the method of expanding horizontally and summzng vertically , will always lead to correct results , provided a certain series which I have pointed out , is finite .
I have also shown how to express this series by a definite integral ; and when this integral or this series has a finite value , the method may be depended on .
In case this series or this definite integral is not finite , then the value of the series* multiplied by zero , must be added to The investigation of this series is generally a task of considerable difficulty .
f however given an example , wherein the correction thus found , added to the sum indicated by the method we are considering , gives the true value of the series ; which in this case is one whose sum has been found by Euler .
the sum given by this method .
In this latter case , however , the mode of summation which I have proposed , is not well adapted for giving the sums of series ; its greatest advantage is felt when the integral or series alluded to is finite : but even in this case the criterion I have pointed out is not useless , for it serves to except certain particular values of the variables , which would give incorrect results .
Without this criterion , or without something equivalent to it , I am inclined to think that the principle on which this method is founded , although it will probably in many cases give accurate results , will in others produce such as are not only numerically but symbolically untrue .
It is worthy of remark , that the method of expanding horizontally and summing vertically in many instances , gives precisely the same formulae as the direct process of integration ; yet that that method attaches limitations to the'n which are necessary to their accuracy , but which are not indicated by the method last mentioned .
Before I proceed to explain these twoprocesses , it will be convenient to prove that the values o all series of the forms ( sin. O A. ( sin_2)+ in 30 cm Oy AS ( Csin 20 ) ( Sin 3 Ax(+^ + A. + z3f + &amp;c. depend on series of the form A(t+A ( -~ + &amp;c.

For the sake of brevity , I shall make use of the general term of any series with the characteristic S prefixed to it to denote that series .
Beginning then with the series SAx ' ( sin i- ) we observe that when m is an even number , we have { .(cos iOMl } sA s..in ''mi ( cos ( COS i2 ( CO ijsO)'-2 + re , m I ; +,.-iSAx ' - &amp;c. ( a ) 2 , * ?
^ t ( co i#)'~'-4 this series will always terminate when m is an even number ; and if m is greater than n , the last term will have no cosines in its denominator : if m=n , the last term will be SAxi ; and if m is less than n , the last term will be SAxi -..J ; so that in ( cosio ) , all cases when m is an even number , the series in -question will depend on serie of the form SAx or on other whose sums are known , Let us now consider the case of m= an odd number ; then we have , , SAx ( in _ SAi TJ ^ ; ( cn(os ; ( cos if(sin iO m-.sS .

Assuming as before 4Ax = Ax + Ax2 + Ax3 + &amp; c , and put1 2 &gt; 3 ting vT2 for x , we have 4v2=Av + Av2+ Av4 + Av 6+ &amp;c. 123 If we were now to integrate this , we should introduce into the denominator of any term v--i 1 ; but we want to introduce the same expression with the signs of both terms positive .
If we multiply both sides by ( -it ) and then integrate , we shall have first ( -I 2^=Av ( z 3+Av4 ( ) +A ( -I ) + &amp; C I2 3 And since A ( -1 vZ '2 =( 1 ) v:i + 21 i( iz =Z -(v +i)(H )V wefind Integrating each term separately , we have E(- , ) =-{A 1VZ .

( 1,8 ) The integrations here indicated will , as in a former instance , generally surpass the powers of analysis in its present state ; but a contrivance similar to that which has been already stated , will in many cases elude the difficulty : the artifice consists in investigating another similar series arranged according to the descending powers of the variable , integrating it in the same manner as we have that marked ( i,3 ) , and adding these two results , we shall in many cases have a function which is integrable , and the two series become equal in the case of x 1 .
By commencing with the descending e59 series A2 +Av 4+ Av 4+ &amp;c. multiplying by ( --i ) I123 and integrating , we shall get the expression I)()1 ( COS 0 ) 2 ( COS 20 ) +3 ( c0s .

This artifice is only a particular case of a much more general principle , which is of use in discovering certain values of the variable , in which a series admits of sumnmation , but which generally is not expressible in finite terms .

K4 , n--'x On--x+ A2a-+ A 3x A3 x3+ By adding all these together , we shall have K { x + --xx + xa2x + &amp;c. 4 &amp; -'W x } equal to a series whose general term isAn { x+ xx + M2a + &amp;c. + x'-lx } .
Now supposing we cannot perform the operation denoted by K on the function 4x , yet if t4 is of such a form that ?
x + 4ax + &amp;c. + -zn-ia ' is equal to a function on which the operation K can be executed , then calling this new function 4 , , we shall have K4 , x = SAi { x -+ -a+-..nI } And if a is such a function that OXxx , a great variety of forms for , may be found , which will satisfy that condition .
Now let x be determined by the equation x= ax , and r being any root of this , we have r= are ar= r= &amp; = in-r .
Consequently our equation becomes K , x= n SAri--n{ Ar +Ar+A-r3+ A r4 + &amp;c. } I. i~~~~~~~ 4 267 provided we put r for x after the operation K is ; executed ; that is , we have found the values of the series A , x + A2xg + AA3x3+ &amp;c. in the particular cases of x which satisfy the equation x =x .
PART II .
I shall now explain another method of deducing the sums of a variety of series , which comprehend amongst them all those which are contained in the former part of this paper ; it rests fundamentally on the following formula , which have long been known : O= 1O n2 .
+ 322n+ _ 42n + &amp;c. -cos 0cos 206 + Cos 30 &amp;c. = c0os 0+ cos 20 + cos-30 + &amp;c. O= t+ 32zn+ I+ 52n+ I &amp; It is unnecessary to give proofs of these and other similar ones which have been frequently noticed , as they may be very easily demonstrated .
Let fx be any function of x developeable in even powers of x , then f( x)A + Bx-+ Cx4+ Dx6+ &amp;c. Divide both sides by xk , then it becomes f(X ) AB ( - ' == 14)"+ _+ &amp;c. +K+ Lx2+ MX+ &amp;c. For x , put successively:ix , 2x , Sx , 4x , &amp;c. and let the alternate series be taken negatively ; these being arranged under each other , we have +"=+ zkzk-zk k 4 &amp; cz kK + Lx + M14+ 2 k--2k 2k 2 &amp; KC-2 *K Mx4 I +4 -== +A+ _B + &amp;c. +K+L3+ M % AB kz zk zk z-- &amp;c. K Lx'44 &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. If we add the vertical columns , we shall , have on the left side of the equation the series f(x ) f(zx ) f(x)f(4 X ) and the right side of the equation consists of three kinds of terms , those which contain negative powers of x , one which does not contain x , and the remaining ones which contain positive powers of x. With respect to these last , they are all of the form Qx { 1i24i42i+ &amp;c. } and as the series which multiplies Qxi ' is equal to zero , all those vertical columns which contain even powers of ax will vanish : the term which is independent on x is K-K+ KK+ &amp;c. LK and those terms which contain negative powers of x , may be represented by the expression S i &gt; .
All the vertical columns being sumimed , we shall have the equation f(x ) f(zx ) f(3x ) &amp; c AS zle 2k + zk l C. _ A= -71s + BS r++ CS , +4 &amp;c. +1K ( A ) As the operations by which we have arrived at this expression have been given at length , it will be unnecessary to repeat them with the slight modifications which would be required for cases nearly similar .
Thus , if we suppose the function fxa developeable according to the odd powers of z , and if we divide both sides of the equation by z Ik+i and 2069 repeat the same process we have already explained , we shall arrive at the following theorm : f(x ) f(zx ) f(3x ) f(4x ) 2k+ X 22k+1 32k+i zk+ Ie -AxS ]k + Bx3SS k--S + &amp;c. +K ( B ) Let f(0 ) be any function of 0 developeable in the form f(0 ) A-+ B cos 0+C cos 20 +D cos 20 &amp;c. a very similar process to that which has been already explained will give the f( ) f(20 ) + f(s0 ) &amp;c. = f(o ( C ) and if f()= A cos 6+B cos 2+C cos 30 + &amp; c a similar course will produce the equation f(0 ) +f(20 ) + f( ) + &amp; c = f(o ) ( D ) If a function is developeable in even powers of x , then its second function is developeable in the same manner , and so are all its higher functions ; therefore if f , and f are two functions developeable in even powers of x , such that fx = A'+ B'+ Cx+ &amp;c. f , fnx A+ B1x+ Cx4+ &amp;c. Then ( A ) will become .
f , f(x ) ff ) ffn(x ) f -_h -+ X ( ,3 &amp; &amp; cc .
=AS+ BS2 + &amp;c. + iK ( E ) These theorems marked ( A ) , ( B ) , ( C ) , and ( D ) , although they possess a very great degree of generality , are not entirely without restriction ; it appears at first sight that they are applicable to all functions which have the prescribed condition of being expansible in even powers of the variable ; such was my opinion of them when I first discovered them ; but several results which were evidently incorrect , soon convinced me that some limitation existed , of whose nature I was not aware : it was not until some years after , that I found 'out the cause of the fallacies which had perplexed me ; and still more recently , I discovered that the series on whose sum their truth or falsehood depended , might be expressed by a definite integral .
By applying the criterion , which I shall presently explain , we cut off a great variety of series whose sums are erroneously given by the method in question ; whether this criterion does not exclude some series whose sums are correctly given , is a point which I do not consider yet completely decided ; the difficulties to which the application of acknowledged principles have in this instance conducted us , appear worthy of the attention of mathematicians .
A more strict method might have been pursued in determining the sum of that part of the series which is neglected ; but this in general leads to such differential equations , as cannot afford us much assistance .
I have , however , given one example of this method , and I have shown that when the part which had been neglected , as being apparently equal to zero ( but which is in fact a finite quantity , ) is added to the sum furnished by the method of expanding horizontally and summing vertically , the true value of the series results .
This confirms the explanation I have given of the reason of the apparent failure of that method .
It will be sufficient to point out the cause which leads to error , and to determine the conditions on which its existence depends for one only of the series ; suitable modifications of the reasoning will readily suggest themselves for the others .
I shall therefore , at present , consider the theorem ( A ) .
If 271 we turn to the process employed in its investigation , we may remark , that the vertical column Lx % ( i.-2+ 342+ &amp;c. ) has been neglected , because the series which enters into it as a factor is equal to zero ; so also the vertical column Mx4 ( 142+ 34- .
&amp;c. ) is neglected for the same reason , and similarly for all the remaining vertical columns .
Now , although it would be perfectly correct to omit any one , or even any finite number of these vertical columns , as being multiplied by a factor equal to zero , yet it is not legitimate to neglect an infinite number of terms , each multiplied by zero , unless it can be proved that the sum of all the terms so multiplied is not an infinite quantity : this~ then , is the latent cause of the false results at which I arrived at the commencement of these enquiries .
I shall now explain how they may be obviated , or rather how to assign the condition on which the truth of the theorems just deduced depend .
We have considered the series of terms Lx2 ( i-2+ 32 &amp;c. ) +M ( I 42+ 3-- &amp;c. ) ++ MXz ( I62+ 86 % &amp; cc .
) + &amp;c. as equal to zero .
Any one of the series which here multiply the powers of x , may be considered as arising from the series ly-y 22 y+ 3y 3 &amp;c. When y= i , call this series K.(y ) , and instead of making y =1 , let y=1+ o , which differs from unity by the infinitely small quantity o ; then we shall have Kn( + o ) = c , ,n+ c2 , no + c3 , ,np+ &amp;c. Where += oC i^~ ~ &amp; c l+= J+S+2X_-+.- .
&amp; c , by substituting this value of Kn( 1+ o ) in the series we had neglected , we shall find { Lx2c , ,l + Mxc,2-+ Nx6c,3+ &amp;c. }+o { Lx~c21+ Mx4c2 , Z+ Nxc23 + &amp;c. }+ 02 { Lxc3 , + MX4C3+ Nxc,3+ &amp;c. } + o3{ Lxc4 , + Mx4c2+ Nx6c4 3+ &amp; C. + &amp; .
&amp; The first line vanishes on account of the value of c , n , and since o is an infinitesimal , the second line will be larger than the sum of all the rest , provided the multiplicators of the powers of o are finite ; if therefore the series L'c21 , + Mxcc2 , N+ Nx6c2,3+ &amp;c. is finite since it is multiplied by o , we may neglect the whole of the above expression : our next step must be to determnine whether the series 2 i3 23+ 3 &amp;c. Mx4 5 5- &amp;c. ++ { i,727+ s37- &amp;c. } + &amp;c. is finite or infinite .
It has been observed by EULER , that the following relations exist between the direct and reciprocal powers of the natural numbers .
I+ 343+ &amp;c. =2 3 { it +s++ &amp;c. } I~+3 354+ &amp;c. +2 -{t+"+z + &amp;c. } i 2+ + s--+ &amp;c. =+2 7{ X+ -3 ++ &amp;c. }35x 1-2+ 3- .

++ &amp; C , , 9N +y &amp; .+ &amp; C. &amp;c. &amp;c. The series which now multiplies f ach term is in all cases less than 2 , consequently this expression will be finite or infinite , according as the series .
1.2.3 MX4 1 ... 5 _ X6 ... 7 Lx r'+ Mx7 --N N r6 + &amp;c. is so or the contrary : the product i.2 ... n may be expressed by means of a definite integral , thus : 1i.2 ... n =d(Iog ) [ i ] These products being replaced by the integral , we have , fdvj-L()j2(og V)3 + M( X )4(ig )5'-.N( |6(14g o)7 + &amp;c. } -= dv/ l ?
g.-Llog -)2 + M( log )4_ N(log )6+ &amp;c. } Now in order to determine the sum of this series , which evidently depends on the function f(x ) , let us assume f(x ) AB &amp;c. K ( ) x2k sxk ck-2 then we have -(x ) =Lx+ Mx4+ Nx6+ &amp;c. And if we put xV~ log -instead of x , it becomes XS XlogV ) L=-- ? ?
1 V ) +M^ 1g V)4-N xlogg P )+ &amp; c And the sum of the series in question is ~fdv log 'T ' z ( X-1 log I- ) [ : ] If therefore this definite integral is finite , the theorem ( A ) will give correct results .
A more convenient form for integration may however be obtained by the following consideration ; the series L-..e.$ q-+ Mx ... 5+ NT 1..7 + &amp;c. will always be finite , if the following series A+B ( z.2.S+C ( )4.2..5+D )6.2 + &amp;c. is finite , because this series when prolonged to the terms I-= 1 L-=-I Mxt+ Nxn+I 4 &amp;c. will have its terms each greater than the corresponding terms of the other series .
Now this series is equal to fdv f ( -log - ) [ ] ( F ) I shall now apply some of the theorems to the investigation of the sums of series , and then explain a method which ( when the equations to which it leads can be solved ) will in all cases render them correct .
And first let f(O ) = ( cos G ) ?
== ( i+ 04 !
&amp;c. )C this series is capable of being expanded into 1.2.3.4 another , which also proceeds according to the even powers of 0 ; first let k= o , then comparing this with ( A ) , we have 3= ( cos 0 ) ( cos 20)n + ( cos 30)-_ &amp;c. ( $,9 ) Let us now examine if the definite integral is finite , it is in this case .

V " I log I }n-fdvv g_0= Jd+ )7 V 9r.r series ( 3,9 ) is correct ; if n is a fraction the series which expresses the value of the definite integral is finite for all values of 6 , except such as are contained in 0= -.i being any whole number ; if n is negative , then the series is finite for all positive values of 0 ; it appears then that whatever be the value of n ifO is positive , we have 2 ( cos 0 ) " ( cos 20)n + ( cs 30- &amp; c From the theorem ( A ) we may readily determine the value of the series I1I I i(cos 0 ) ' 7^(cos 20 ) + 3(cos 3 ) &amp; C. For let f(0 ) == A+ A 2+ B 4+ C ' 6+ &amp; C t ( cos )CO nnn And the sum of the series required will be A- ' AI S 4i tS+ A0 S S+ B l0S *+ &amp;c. +O K.ik l i2k-2 z , jzk-4+ n* Which is precisely the same sum as we have already found in ( 2,4 ) , except that we now find that it applies to fractional or surd values of n , as well as to whole numbers .
Let us next suppose f(0 ) = ( tan 0)21+1= T01z+1+ T3021+3 + T5021+5+ &amp;c. this give the series ( tan 0)21+1 ( tan 0)21+ ( tan 30)21+ k-+7 ~(tk+n + r-- &amp; C. c* TIS 2+ T3 0S S:_t_ , ) + &amp;c.

In the i rxrer part we could only determine the value of the series ( sin 0 ) ( sin zQ ) + ( sin 30 ) " when n is an even number , nor will the method now employed enable us to find its value when n is odd ; the reason of this is that.n .

xZ23 1.2.3-4-5 is developable in a series proceeding according to the even powers of 0 only when n is an even number , if n is odd , it proceeds according to the odd powers .
The theorens contained in this second part are applicable to a very extensive class of series which have not , I believe , yet been considered .
In ( A ) let f(0 ) cos 0 =cos(cos 0 ) and putting k}o we have ^ -== cos 0 -cos 0+ cos2 30 &amp;c. ( 4,1 ) The definite integral which is the criterion of the truth of this value , is 0 0 , fdv cos -_=A +d +++ &amp; C. 2+ +41+6 BCD++++ + &amp;c. x-2i1-4i-6Ir 9r .
And this is always finite unless 0 is an even submultiple of e r ; if we make k= and k= 2 , we shall have the following theorems , which are true with the same restrictions .

( 4,4 ) and the definite integral is finite in this case , whenever 0 and r are incommensurable : we may therefore in the same circumstance have the value of the series ( cos " 0)m ( cos n20)m ( cos n30)m - .
+ 3zA C. The theorems marked ( A ) and ( B ) in this paper correspond with that marked ( 12 ) in Mr. HERSCHEL'S memoir " On various points of Analysis , " printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1 814 ; with the first of these it coincides when n is an even number , and with the second when it is an odd one : the theorem alluded to is S { ( -I)+.{i __(-4-)}sL)..+2L(52).2x -x+ &amp;c. 2 whereL L= I--1 +i -- &amp;c. = 2xL(9 ) = ( ... -)2 B Now this latter expression is the value of those series which I have expressed by S -i^ .
Both methods give the same result , and as that result is very frequently erroneous , I shall confirm the truth of the explanation I have offered , by showing in a particular case , that if the sum of that part of the series which had been neglected as being equal to zero , is found and added to the other part , the result will no longer be erroneous : the example I shall examine is the series I IG I IG.+3 , + &amp; C. , -'_ -_~ 1+ 3-_ _ " + &amp;c.

o St-I ) or x =+l 1~^ q+ T3 &amp; c ( 4 ) The same series being summed by the theorem ( A ) in this paper gives the same result ; but then the theorem alluded to only declares this to be the true value in case a certain series is finite , which series is + 01.12.3 + 16.12.3..4.5 + 6.1 .
2..7 + &amp;c. but this series can only be finite when 0 is actually equal to zero : the method which I have explained in this paper points out that the equation LI X-- &amp; C. can only be depended on when 0= o , in that case it is known to be correct .
I have already stated that the reason why the value of the series so found is incorrect , is that the series 02(122+ &amp;c. ) + ( 4+ &amp;c. )-'(6+ &amp;c. ) + &amp;c. has been neglected because the coefficient of each term is zero .
I shall now proceed to investigate the sum of this series , and shall prove that it is equal to a finite function of 0 let y =_ C(I 22X_+ &amp;c. ) + C4(V~,42e+ &amp;c. ) + &amp;c. then y is equal to the sum of the series whose value we are seeking ; if c 0= / -1 and x o , differentiatey twice relative to x , and multiply by c9 , and we find Cd c^ ~ ' , + &amp;c. ) + c(\ -~'+ &amp;c. ) + &amp;c. Hence the equation for determining y is C die = C2(lx--J2r'+ &amp; C. ) ( + , C)2 And the value of y is 379 x xxxY _'Z ( , I +EX d+ ( , + ) , 3 These integrals must be taken between the limits x and x o , putting -= v this equation is changed into 1XI V.

hence 2C ncy -^ ------== c2( '--A2+ &amp;c. ) + c4(l424+ &amp;c. ) + C2 Sl_ + 6(6-_ 26+ &amp; C. ) + &amp; C. If c -s/ i we have _---w=.2(ei2 ?

From the value which has been found fory , or for the series a(i22+ &amp;c. ) + C4(i42+ &amp;c. ) + &amp;c. I am inclined to conclude that although the series i2-2+ 83~ &amp;c. is equal to zero for any finite value of n , yet that when n is infinite , the sum of this series is also infinite .
It was my intention to have produced from several of the series whose sums have been found in this Paper , the values of several continued products ; but the length to which it has already extended will prevent me from more than merely noticing , that many very curious ones will present themselves by integrating the series whose sums have been given .
Since this Paper was written , in a conversation with M. POISSON , I mentioned one of the series which it contained , and remarked , that the principle employed led to many erroneous results ; that geintleman observed , that many years before he had been led to series nearly similar , in endeavouring to integrate the equations representing the planetary motions , by means of series arranged according to some other functions of the time than the usual ones of the sines and cosines : he obligingly showed me some of his papers relating to this subject , in one of which was a series which in a particular case became the one I had mentioned ; the mode of investigation by which he had arrived at these series he had however laid aside , because it rested on the sums of the diverging series 12t22n+ 328 &amp;c. on which he observed we canlnot depend .
To the same distinguished analyst I am indebted for some farther information on this subject .
M. POISSON was one of the commissioners appointed by the Institute of France to examine the manuscripts which were left by LAGRANGE , amongst these was one entitled 6 " a method of summing series , " which depended on the values of the same diverging series as those used by M. POISSON and myself ; unfortunately it is very short , and its illustrious author does not appear to have resumed the subject : possibly the erroneous values which it gives for the sum of certain series might have caused him to reject it .
