" On the Fossil Remains of Turtles discovered in the Chalk Formation of the South-East of England .
" By Gideon Algernon Mantell , Esq. , LL. D. , F.R.S. In this paper the author gives a description , accompanied with drawings , of a remarkable fossil Turtle , referable to the genus Emys , and named from its discoverer , Mr. Bensted , the Emys Benstedi , which has been lately found in a quarry of the lower chalk of Kent , at Burham , which is situated near the banks of the Medway , between Chatham and Maidstone .
The specimen discovered consists of the carapace or dorsal shell , six inches in length and nearly four inches in breadth , with some of the sternal plates , vertebrse , eight ribs on each side of the dorsal ridge , a border of marginal plates , and one of the coracoid bones .
It is adherent to a block of chalk by the external surface of the sternal plates .
The marginal plates are joined to each other by finely indented sutures , and bear the impress of the horny scales or tortoise-shell , with which they were originally covered .
The expanded ribs are united together throughout the proximal half of their length , and gradually taper to their marginal extremities , which are protected by the plates of the osseous border .
Mr. Bell considers the species to which it belonged as being closely allied in form to the common European Emys , and as possessing a truly fluviatile or lacustrine character .
The plates of the plastron , however , as also the coracoid bone , resemble more the corresponding bones of marine than of fresh water turtles .
