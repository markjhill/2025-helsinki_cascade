( Abstract .
) The apparatus employed in the present investigations was the same thermo-electric one that was used in the experiments on conduction of heat in bone , brain-tissue , and skin , described in a former paper , * but the mode of application of the thermo-pile to the tissue was somewhat different .
The tissue , whether hard or soft , was placed on a thin copper plate , which formed the floor of a square hole cut in the bottom of a small light wooden box .
The pile , having been applied to the upper surface of the tissue , was held in place by means of a pasteboard collar , which was made fast with pins to the edges of the box .
In the case of the soft tissues , light weights were affixed to the pile to regulate the pressure .
With bone , in order to insure intimate contact between the pile and the tissue , and between the latter and the copper plate , a little marrow was used .
The unoccupied space in the box was filled with finely chopped cotton-wool .
The box had pasteboard uprights attached to its sides , by which it was suspended from the VOL. XL .

Conduction of Heat [ Jan. 7 , sliding arm of a stand .
The inferior surface of the copper plate was brought in contact with water of a temperature lower than that of the air by fractions of a degree of centigrade , as in the former experiments referred to .
1Experiments on Muscle .
The muscles examined were those of the head , thigh , and leg of the sheep .
It soon was noticed that the rate of transmission differed somewhat , according as the muscle was examined in the direction of its fibres or perpendicularly to them ; and this fact led to the division of the experiments , into two classes , according as the line of conduction was parallel or at right angles to that of the fibres .
Tables I and II give results obtained under these two conditions respectively .
The results represent 104 observations on conduction parallel to the direction of the fibres , and 100 observations on conduction at right angles to this direction .

So long as the muscle is kept in a moist state , it seems to conduct equally well whether recently removed from the animal or after decay has commenced ; and when the conductivity has been decidedly lowered by exposure to the air , it generally can be partially , and sometimes completely , restored , by moistening the tissue with water or fresh animal juices .
Experiments on Liver. .
The liver examined was that of the sheep .

Experiments on Kidney .
* The observations were made on sheep 's kidney .
Tables IV and V give respectively the results of thirty experiments on the cortical substance , and of an equal number on the medullary tissue .
The tables show that at every period of the observations , excepting the maximum for the ninth minute , which gives a slight balance in favour of the medullary tissue\#151 ; the cortical tissue is the better conductor .

Experiments on Bone .
The observations were made on the tibia and the ilium of the sheep .
The experiments were divided into three classes , according as the tissue was compact , spongy or combined compact-spongy .
Some 200 experiments were made , which were divided about equally between the three varieties of tissue .
Tables YI , YII , and YIII give the results of these experiments .
According to the tables , spongy tissue stands first in average , maximum , and minimum conductivity , at every period , and the combined compact-spongy tissue comes next , also as regards all three valuations and every period of time .

Both compact and spongy tissues lose their conducting power more or less rapidly after removal from their natural surroundings ; spongy tissue much more quickly than compact .
Spongy tissue may regain the greater part of the loss of its conductivity , after the application of water or fresh animal matter , but this is not the case with compact Prof. Victor Horsley .
[ Jan. 7 , tissue ; however , moisture seems to slightly reduce the rate of loss in the latter .
With regard to the compound tissue\#151 ; compact-spongy , the changes which its conductivity undergoes present simply a varying mean of those of its two components .
After long exposure to the air , the bone being well dried , the conductivities of compact and of spongy tissue are found to closely approximate each other .
Experiments on Brain .
The experiments \#169 ; n this tissue had reference only to the changes of its conductivity , due to exposure to the air , and to the effect of moisture and fresh animal liquids on these changes .
Like liver and kidney , the tissue of brain quickly loses its power of conduction after death , and neither moisture or fresh animal matter can restore this loss , although they may diminish its rate .

" Further Researches into the Function of the Thyroid Grland and into the Pathological State produced by Removal of the same .
" By Professor Victor Horsley , B.S. , F.R.C.S. Communicated by Professor Michael Foster , M.D. , Sec. R.S. Received December 10 , 1885 .
In December , 1884 , I showed that the thyroid gland was intimately connected with the process of mucin metabolism , that if the thyroid gland in monkeys was removed with antiseptic precautions ( the same ensuring healing of the wound in three days ) the consequences to the animal were\#151 ; ( 1 ) symptoms of general nervous disturbance evidenced by tremors , paroxysmal convulsions , functional paralysis , mental hebetude , and finally complete imbecility ; ( 2 ) profound anaemia coupled with leucocytosis ; ( 3 ) all the symptoms of the disease discovered within the last decade and termed myxcedema ; ( 4 ) that just as in the acute form of the disease just named there was found to be a great accumulation of mucin in the connective tissues throughout the body ( mucinoid degeneration ) , and in the blood , and as a consequence the same post-mortem appearances ; ( 5 ) that at the same time there was a great activity in the raucin-secreting glands , and , further , that the parotid gland under these abnormal circumstances secreted mucin in large quantity , the gland cells at the same time disintegrating .
During the past year I have confirmed my previous observations , and greatly extended them , and have firm basis for my original opinion that the function of the thyroid gland is indispensable to the higher animals , and that it is duplex , since , in the first place , it regulates the formation of mucin in the body ; and , in the second
