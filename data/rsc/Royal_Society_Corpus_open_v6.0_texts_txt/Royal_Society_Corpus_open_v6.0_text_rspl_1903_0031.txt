( Abstract .
) If a charged condenser be placed with its plane in the direction of the aether drift , then on the assumption that a moving charge develops a magnetic field , there will be associated with the condenser a magnetic field perpendicular to the lines of electric induction , and to the direction of the motion .
If N be the electrostatic energy of the condenser , the magnetic energy produced when moving with velocity w through the aether with its plates parallel to the motion is N ( w/ v)2 , where v is the usual velocity of propagation .
But when the plates of the condenser are perpendicular to the direction of motion , the effects of the opposite charges will neutralise each other , and there will be no magnetic field produced .
Thus if we have a condenser freely suspended with its plates making an angle \p with the direction of the aether drift , the magnetic energy is N ( w/ v)2 cos2 The couple tending to increase ip is \#151 ; dEijdxp , which is N ( w/ v)2 sin 2 \p .
By utilising the Earth 's motion through space , we can arrange ( generally ) the experiment so that xp = 45 ' and w is the total velocity of the Earth through space .
The couple is then a maximum equal to 10~8 N for the orbital velocity alone , and to 2'3 x 10-8 N when we include the Sun 's proper motion .
A condenser was suspended by a fine wire and charged .
The charges were let into the plates of the condenser by means of this suspending wire , and by a wire which hung from beneath dipping into a liquid terminal .
Observations were made at different times in the day when the plane of the condenser made various angles with the direction of the drift .
The final form of the apparatus is as follows :\#151 ; The suspension is a phosphor bronze strip 37 cm .
long , the finest that could be obtained .
This was soldered at its lower end A to a copper cap , fixed to the condenser protecting the projecting tin foil tags and making contact with them by means of fusible metal .
The upper end of the suspension was wound on a small windlass which was insulated by a mica plate fixed to an annular wooden ring , forming the lid to the inner zinc vessel .
A small glass bell jar covered the windlass , contact being made by a'Wire passing through the small cork at the top .
A small brass tube shields the upper part of the suspension , and a thin metal cylinder protects the point of support .
The condenser is inserted in a celluloid ball , to diminish the effect of convection currents .
Two cylindrical zinc vessels protect the apparatus , the interspace being 1903 .
] On a Charged Condenser moving through Space .
133 packed with cotton wool ; these were earthed together with the ball containing the condenser .
A plane mirror was attached to the condenser , this was viewed by means of a telescope and scale , through small mica windows in the zinc coverings .
The potential was maintained by a Wimshurst machine , to the terminals of which was attached a Kelvin-White voltmeter .
The best conditions under which to make the experiment are calculated .
These include considerations as to the time of day and time of year , and azimuth of the plane of the condenser .
This calculation is made for both the orbital motion and the proper motion of the solar system .
The following table gives the final results obtained .
These were observations taken after many months of experience with the apparatus and were considered by us as conclusive against there being any such effect as we were seeking :\#151 ; 1 Date .

barely exceeds 5 per cent , of the calculated deflection 6*8 cm .
There are also other observations on the electrostatic effects to show that the deflection observed was a purely capricious action and could in no way be attributed to the relative motion of the earth and the rether .
There is no doubt that the result is a purely negative one , as in other cases of possible interaction between sether and matter that have been examined .
As the energy of the magnetic field , if it exists ( and from our point of view we must suppose it does ) must come from somewhere , we are driven to the conclusion that the electrostatic energy of a charged condenser must diminish by the compensating amount N ( u/ v)2 , where N is the electrostatic energy , when moving with a velocity u at right angles to its electrostatic lines of force .
