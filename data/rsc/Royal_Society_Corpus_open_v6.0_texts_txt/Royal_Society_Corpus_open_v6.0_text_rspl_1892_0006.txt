A List of the Presents received was laid on the table , and thanks ordered for them .
The following Papers were read : I. ' Dynamo-Electric Machinery By J. HOPKINSON , F.R. and E. WILSON .
Received February 15 , 1892 .
The following is intended as completion of a paper by Drs. J. and E. Hopkinson ' Phil. Trans 1886 , p. 331 The motive is to verify by experiment theoretical results concerning the eftect of the currents in the armature of dynamo machines on the amount and distribution of the magnetic field which were given in that paper , but which were left without verification .
For the sake of completeness , part of the work is given over again .
The two dynamos experimented upon were constructed by Messrs. Siemens Brothers and Co. , and are identical , as far as it is possible to make them .
They are mounted upon a common base plate , their axles being coupled together , and are referred to in this paper respectively as No. 1 and No. 2 .
Each dynamo has a single magnetic circuit consisting of two vertical limbs extended at their lower extremities to form the polepieces , and having their upper extremities connected by a yoke of rectangular section .
Each limb , together with its pole-piece , is formed of a single forging of wrought iron .
These forgings , as also that of the yoke , are built up of hammel.ed scrap iron , and afterwards carefully annealed .
Gun-metal castings bolted to the baseplate of the machine support the mH , gnets .
The magnetising coils on each limb consist of sixteen layers of copper wire 2 mm. diameter , making a total of 3968 convolutions for each machine .
The pole-pieces are bored out to receive the armature , leaving a gap above and below subtending an angle of at the centre of the shaft .
The opposing surfaces of the gap are cm .
deep .

The armature core is built up of soft-iron discs , No. 24 B.W.G. , which are held between two end plates screwed on the shaft .

The core is wound longitudinally according to the Hefner von Alteneck principle with 208 bars made of copper strip , each 9 mm. deep by mm. thick .
The commutator is formed of fifty-two harddrawn copper segments insulated with mica , and the connexions to the armature so made , that the plane of commutation in the commutator is vertical when no current is passing through the armature .
IBach dynamo is intended for a normal output of 80 amperes 140 volts , at 880 revolutions per minute .
The resistance of the armature measured between opposite bars of the commutator is ohm , and of each magnet coil ohms .
In the machiue , the armature core has a greater than the magnet cores , and consequently the magnetising force used therein may be neglected .
The yoke has the same section as the magnet cores , and is thel.efore included therein , as is also the polepiece .

Bfects of the Current in the Armature .
Quoting from the Royal Society paper , p. 342 , " " The currents in the fixed coils around the magnets are not the only magnetising forces applied in a dynamo machine ; the currents in the moving coils of the armature have also their effect on the resultant field .
There are in two independent variables in a dynamo machine , the current around the magnets and the current in the armature , and the relation of E.M.F. to currents is fully represented by a surface .
In well-constructed machines the effect of the latter is reduced to a minimum , but it can be by no means neglected .
When a section of the armature coils is commutated it must inevitably be momentarily short.circuited , and , if at the time of commutation the field in which the section is moving is other than feeble , a considerable current will arise in that section , accompanied by waste of power and destructive sparking .
" " Suppose the commutation occurs at an angle in advance of the symmetrical position between the fields , and that the total current through the armature be , reckoned positive in the direction of the resultant EMF of the machine , i.e. , positive when the machine is used as a generator of electricity .
Taking any closed line through maguets and al.mature , symmetrically drawn as ABCDEFA , it is obvious that the line integral of magnetic force is diminished by the current in the armature included between angle in front and Dr. J. Hopkinson and Mr. E. Wilson .
[ Mar. 17 , angle behind plane of symmetry .
lf be the number of convolutions of the armature , the value of this magnetising force is 4 opposed to the magnetising force of the fixed coils on the magnets .
Thus , if we know the lead of the brusbes and the current in the armature , we are at once in a position to calculate the effect on the electromotive force of the machine .
A further eflect of the current in the armature is a material disturbance of the distribution of the induction over the bored face of the pole-piece ; the force along BC is by no means equal to that along DE .
Draw the closed curve BCGHB , the line integral along , and HB is negligible .
Hence the difference between force HG and BC is equal to , where is the angle COG To verify this formula is one of the principal objects of this paper .
A pair of brusbes having relatively fixed positions near together , and insulated from the frame and from one another , are carried upon a divided circle , and bear upon the commutator .
The diiference of potential between these brushes was measured in various positions round the commutator , the current in the armature , the potential difference of the main brushes , and the speed of the machine being also noted .
The results are given in Diagrams Nos. 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , in which the ordinates are measured potential differences , and the abscissae angles turned through by the exploring brushes .
The potential differences in Diagram No. 2 were measured by a Siemens ' voltmeter , and each ordinate is therefore somewhat smaller than the true value , owing to the time during which the exploring brushes were not actually in contact with the commutator segments .
But this does not affect the results , becanse the area is reduced in the same tion as the potential differences .
In Diagrams Nos. 3 , 4 , and 5 , the potential differences were taken on one of Sir William Thomson 's quadrant electrometers , and are correct .

At page 345 of the paper on Dynamo-Electric Machinery it is shown that , where I is the characteristic curve when , and is the lead of the brushes .
The following is an endeavour to verify this formula .
The potentials both upon the magnets and upon the brushes were takell by a Siemens ' voItmeter , and are rough .
The speeds were taken by a Buss tachometer , and there is some uncertainty about the precise lead of the brushes , owing to the difficulty in determining the precise posibion of the symmetrical position between the fields , and also to the width of the contacts on the commutator .
It was necessary , in order to obtain a marked effect of the armature reaction , that the magnet field should be comparatively small , that the current in the armature should be large , and the leads of the brushes should be large .
The two machines had their axles coupled so that No. 1 could Dr. J. Hopkinson and Mr. E. Wilson .

The magnets were in each case coupled parallel , and excited by a battery each through an adjustable resistance .
The two armatures were coupled in series with another batter and the following observations were made : From which we infer:\mdash ; nets .
mature As there was uncertainty as to the precise accuracy of the measure ments of potential , it appeared best to remeasure potentials with no current through the armature with the Siemens ' voltmeter placed as in the last experiment .

It has already appeared that experiment gives for I in No. 1 , and in No. 2 .
The difference is probably due to error in estimating the lead of the brushes , which is difficuIt , to uncertainty in the position of the neutral line on open ircuit .

" " On the Clark Cell as a Standard of Electromotive Force By B. T. GLAZEBROOK , M.A. , F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , and S. SKINNER , M.A. , Christ 's College , Demonstrator in the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge .
Received February 17 , 1892 .
( Abstract .
) The paper consists of two parts:\mdash ; In Part I an account is given of experiments on the absolute eJectromotive force of a Clark cell .
This was determined in the manner described by Lord Rayleigh ( ' Phil. Trans 1884 ) in terms of a known resistance and the electrochemical equivalent of silver .
The resistance used was a strip of platinoid about 1 cm .
wide and cm .
thick wound on an open frame .
It was immersed in , bath of paraffin oil , and the currents used , varying from about to rather over amperes , did not raise its temperature sufficiently to affect the result .
It had a resistance of nearly 1 B.A. unit .
This lvas determined in terms of the original B.A. units .
As part of the object of the experiments was to test the memorandum on the use of the silver voItameter recently issued by the Electrical Standards Committee of the Board of Trade , the large currents mentioned above were purposely employed .
The silver voltameters were treated in accordance with the instructions in the memorandum .
The standal cell to which the results are referred is one constructed by Lord Rayleigh in 1883 , probably No. 4 of the cells in his paper already quoted .
The results have been reduced on the that 1 B.A. unit is equal to ohm ; if we take the number as representing the value in B.A. units of the resistance of a column of mercury at , 1 metre long , 1 .
mm. in section , the above is equivalent to saying that the length of the mercury column having a resistance of 1 ohm is cm .
It has also been assumed that mass of silver deposited in one second by a current of 1 ampere is gramme , and that the coefficient of change of E.M.F. with temperature of a Clark 's cell is .
This last result has been verihed by us in Part II .
*Ihis number is the mean of the best recent results .
