] Since the solvent glands in birds are larger than in quadrupeds , Mr. Home lias investigated their structure in different classes of hirds , and has here collected several varieties that he has observed ; and his descriptions are accompanied with drawings of various peculiarities of structure .
Of the birds that live on animal food , the author has examined several kinds of falcon , the Soland goose , the crane , the cormorant , the common gull , and the snow-bird , the last of which differs considerably from the rest .
Among graminivorous birds , the swan and goose are noticed as differing from most others in the situation and structure of these glands .
Others of this tribe here examined are the turkey , the cassowary , the American ostrich , and the African ostrich .
In the three last the solvent glands are in a cavity of unusual size ; and the muscular structure of the gizzard is uncommonly weak , which the author conceives to be connected with the mode of progressive motion , which is the same in these birds , and may serve to grind the food without the assistance of strong muscular action .
