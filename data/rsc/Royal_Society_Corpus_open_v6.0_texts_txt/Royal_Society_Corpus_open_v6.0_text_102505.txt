VIII .
An Account of the Dissection of a Dog that had Mercury injected into one of the Jugulars .
By Dr. Christoph .
Pitt .
THE Mercury was thrown out of the Blood into the Cavity of the Abdomen , as likewise some Appearance of it in the other Cavities of the Body .
All the Glandules were very turgid , and full of Liquor , especially in the Ventricles of the Brain , and all round there was a great Quantity of Serum .
This may be called a true Hyarocephalos .
It being a chance Dog and having no Notice of what had been done on him , I could not so well observe whether it would work on him by Salivation , whether it made him duller than ordinary , or how long the QuickSilver had been in his Body .
