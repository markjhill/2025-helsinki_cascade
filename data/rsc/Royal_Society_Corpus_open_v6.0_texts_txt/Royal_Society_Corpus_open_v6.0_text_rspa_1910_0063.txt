Banded Spectrum\#151 ; Faint hazy patches of light appear upon the plates taken at the highest pressures in regions of the spectrum which at low pressures do not contain spectrum lines ; they constitute an incipient banded spectrum resembling that observed in the silver spectrum at much lower pressures , but are not a marked characteristic of the spectrum and are not accompanied by a disappearance of the line spectrum as in the case of the silver arc .

XI.-\#151 ; The Displacement of Salts from Solution by Various By H. E. Armstrong , F.R.S. , and J. Vargas Eyre , Ph. D. ( Received and read June 24 , 1909 .
) In a previous communication on this subject* we have described a series of observations made at 25 ' with ammonium , sodium and potassium chlorides and a few other haloids , the main result arrived at in the case of these chlorides being that the two precipitants , hydrogen chloride and ethylic alcohol , exercise the same kind of influence\#151 ; a conclusion of some interest in view of the fact that alcohol is a neutral " unionisable " substance .
In all cases , the precipitant appeared to have an exceptionally marked effect when used in relatively small amount .
The results obtained by Engel with hydrogen chloride at 0 ' also appeared to justify this conclusion .
As we could not but recognise that the determinations were subject to a variety of errors and that very small differences were involved in our estimations of the effect of small quantities of the precipitant , in extending the inquiry we have revised most of our earlier work .
We have used not only ethylic alcohol and hydrogen chloride but also methylic and propylic alcohols as precipitants of ammonium , potassium and sodium chlorides , both at 25 ' and 0 ' .
A few observations have also been made on the influence of salts and of glucose as precipitants .
Speaking generally , the results serve to confirm most of the conclusions of our earlier work and even show closer agreement in the behaviour of the different precipitants than was formerly pictured ; it is clear , however , that * These Studies , Paid II , 'Roy .

[ June 24 , the effects produced by relatively small amounts of precipitant are not always so great as was supposed , especially in the case of hydrogen chloride , this conclusion being applicable to Engel 's determinations made at 0 ' as well as to our own at 25 ' .
The differences will be apparent on comparing the graphs now given ( Diagram IY ) with those published previously .
We have satisfied ourselves that the earlier determinations , both our own and Engel 's , were seriously affected by errors which we trust have been minimised in the present series of experiments .
The method followed has been that described in our previous communication , without material alteration .
In operating at 0 ' , a rectangular glass tank , 36 cm .

, was used as the bath ; this was charged with broken ice and water ; by keeping the mixture constantly stirred , the temperature was easily maintained constant and very close to 0 ' C. during several hours .
The tank was enclosed in a stout wooden box provided with a wooden cover , layers of felt being placed between the box and the tank .
Small doors were provided\#151 ; to take the place of the glass front of the tank used in determining solubilities at 25'\#151 ; at opposite sides of the box , through which the solution could be viewed .
The salts used were prepared from the materials sold as " pure .
" As a rule , these were twice recrystallised from water ; the hot , saturated solutions were cooled artificially and well stirred , so as to cause the substance to separate in fine crystals ; to remove the mother liquor from these , they were centri-fugalised in a perforated drum made of Berlin porcelain .
The crystals were washed finally with alcohol and dried ; the purified material was then sifted through rather coarse muslin which had been thoroughly washed .
It should be mentioned that if the substance used be too fine , it is very difficult to prepare clear solutions .
To purify sodium chloride , it was precipitated from a saturated solution by hydrogen chloride , then redissolved and reprecipitated , the subsequent treatment being that followed in the case of the other salts .
The alcohols were carefully dehydrated by means of lime and calcium turnings and fractionally distilled .
The extent to which individual determinations are in agreement is shown in the following table , in which the values given in Columns I and II are the results of separate experiments , A and B representing results obtained with two samples of the same liquid , the one withdrawn an hour later than the other .
The precaution was always taken to make duplicate determinations ; when the two results were not in agreement , the experiment was discarded .

Experience has shown in the case of potassium chloride\#151 ; of which several different samples were used\#151 ; that it is necessary always to make use of the solubility value of each particular sample of salt in reducing the observations made with this salt ; only when this precaution is adopted are the values deduced in satisfactory accordance .

It is only in the case of potassium chloride that this necessity has arisen : it may be that the observed slight differences in solubility were due to the presence of impurity in some samples more than in others ; we are inclined , however , to attribute them rather to differences in the state of division of the various samples .
The general consistency of the results arrived at with various salts and various precipitants may be regarded as proof that the practice we have followed is a legitimate one and that the results may be accepted as affording a generally accurate picture of the effects produced by precipitants .
We do not pretend that they possess absolute value\#151 ; this could only be if the experiments were carried out with all the refinements it is customary to lavish on determinations of atomic weight ; but the end in view scarcely justifies the expenditure of so much time and labour on the inquiry , at all events until the main issues have been developed by a preliminary survey of the field .

As in the previous communication , the effect of the precipitant is]expressed as if it were a dehydrating effect ; in reality , however , our method of treatment involves merely an evaluation of the amount of water thrown out of action as solvent water by the precipitant .
We were careful in our first account of the work to speak of the precipitant as a certain amount of water and of the apparent molecular hydration of the precipitant , the main object in view was said to be to determine the relative concentrating effect of the precipitant in competition with that of the salt ; and at the conclusion we insisted that it was necessary to recognise that the solvent itself , as well as Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Dr. J. V. Eyre .
[ June 24 , the substance in solution , is in a state of continued flux .
It should not be possible to suppose that we ever regarded the results arrived at as true hydration values .
On reference to the relative positions of the graphs on the horizontal axes , it will be seen that , of the three alcohols , methylic is the least and propylic the most active precipitant .
The activity of hydrogen chloride is considerably in excess of that of the alcohols .
Of the three chlorides , ammonium chloride is least affected ; next comes sodium chloride and then potassium chloride .
In all cases , except when used in very small proportion , these precipitants are more effective at 0 ' than at 25 ' ; in the cases of ammonium and potassium chloride the two graphs are approximately parallel and somewhat distant from one another .
In the case of sodium chloride , they are not only closer together but of contrary flexure and they intersect near the origin ; it is clear that the behaviour of this chloride is peculiar .
The marked difference in the behaviour of the three alcohols is of great importance as throwing light on the precipitation process .
It is very noteworthy that methylic alcohol has the least effect , although it is nearest to water , the most soluble and presumably , therefore , that which has the greatest attraction for water , whilst propylic alcohol , which is the least soluble and least attractive of water , has the greatest ; the solubility of this latter alcohol is so slight that it cannot exist in the solution saturated with sodium chloride to a much greater extent than half a molecular proportion to 55*5 molecular-proportions of water .
The extent to which the activity of the precipitants increases and their effect on the several salts in passing through the series of alcohols , ,to hydrogen chloride , as shown by the position which the graphs occupy on the horizon on which the effect of a single molecular proportion of precipitant is indicated are given in the following table :\#151 ; MeOH .

133 It is clear , however , that the precipitant does not act merely by attracting water to itself\#151 ; the condition of the water must in some way be changed by the introduction of the precipitant , especially in the case of a substance such as propylic alcohol .
According to the hypothesis developed by one of us ( compare No. VI of these Studies ) , the addition of any one of the precipitants to a solution would determine the dissociation of the water in the sense of the expression ( H20)rt-^nH20 .
Therefore the effect of adding a precipitant would be to increase the proportion of hydrone ( H20 ) as well as of the other simpler molecules which are present in water , as such molecules would be more or less powerful dehydrating agents ; in virtue of their tendency to polymerise and form water , they would condition the " dehydration " of hydrolated molecules .of the solute and in this way would determine the separation of the substance from solution .
This appears to bte the most probable explanation of the manner in which the precipitant acts mechanically .
From this point of view , the greater effectiveness of the precipitant at 0 ' may be ascribed to the presence at this temperature of a larger proportion of more complex molecules in the water , that is to say , of a larger proportion of molecules which undergo simplification in the manner pictured ; also to the presence of a larger proportion of complex , more easily precipitable salt molecules .
We have included in Diagram VI , representing the behaviour of potassium bromide in presence of ethylic alcohol , together with our own results at 0 ' and 25 ' , values deduced from Taylor's* results at 30 ' and 40 ' .
It will be seen that his results are in complete harmony with ours .
The gradual diminution in activity of the precipitant and the disappearance of backward flexure in the graphs , as the temperature rises , would seem to be clear evidence of a corresponding diminution in the proportion of hydrolated salt molecules .
That the condition of the water is disturbed there can be practically no doubt , as propylic alcohol has so much greater an effect than either of the other alcohols , both of which certainly have a greater affinity for water .
That the condition of the salt in solution is also altered would seem to follow from the fact that , as shown in the following table , the apparent molecular conductivity of the salt is much reduced by the addition of an alcohol to the liquid : it will be noticed , moreover , that there is a striking similarity in the extent to which each of the three alcohols reduces conductivity on the one hand and solubility on the other .
The difference in the condition of the solutions at 25 ' and 0 ' is also indicated , as well as the fact that a considerably greater effect is produced at 0 ' than at 25 ' .

It is improbable that they exist to any extent in an associated state\#151 ; at all events in the more dilute solutions ; to some extent , perhaps to a considerable extent , in the case of propylic alcohol , they may be present as simple molecules unattached to hydrone .
A certain proportion of the molecules are doubtless associated with hydrone molecules in various ways\#151 ; some being hydrolated , some simply hydronated and others poly-hydronated , thus : Me , Me , .H \gt ; 0\lt ; W XOH \gt ; 0=0H , Me , / OH2 \r\/ i r/ W\ OH , The further removed the alcohols are from hydrone , the less such complexes will be likely to simulate the behaviour of corresponding molecules in water itself .
Prom this point of view it is easy to understand that methylic alcohol has little effect on ammonium chloride , behaving almost as water , whilst propylic alcohol has a marked effect .
Similar considerations are applicable to salts .
Salts such as we have dealt * We are indebted for these values to Mr. D. Crothers .
It may be mentioned here that , in making the determinations , he availed himself of a great improvement in the conductivity apparatus effected under the advice of Prof. T. Mather , F.R.S. ; this consists in substituting a vibration galvanometer the latter had devised for the telephone which it is customary to use .

The displacement of haloids-such as we have studied from solution may be regarded as a consequence of the dehydrolation and dehydronation of such molecules , whether derived from monadic or polymerised molecules of the salt .
Our results appear to indicate that precipitants have but relatively little tendency to dissociate the complex salt molecules ; if they had this effect to any considerable extent , the solubility of the salt would be increased rather than diminished .
The increased solubility of potassium chloride in presence of potassium nitrate ( Diagram Y ) is probably a case of this kind\#151 ; the fact that the greater effect is produced at the higher temperature is in harmony with this explanation and affords an argument unfavourable to the conclusion that the two salts combine .
The increased solubility of potassium and sodium chloride in presence of glucose , however , is perhaps due to the formation of a compound of salt with sugar .
It is noticeable that the graphs , in all cases , show a slight backward trend in their upper course .
We are less inclined than we were formerly to regard this as due to the solvent action of the precipitant ; we think that it is at least mainly a consequence of the production of a larger proportion of more soluble simplified molecules of the salt as the amount of the precipitant is increased .
Attention may be called to the various graphs relating to nitrates in Diagram V ; the greater " sensitiveness " of nitrates is clearly indicated .
The results are in accordance with the view which is generally held that nitrates have less affinity for water than chlorides .
The fact that sodium nitrate is less precipitable than the potassium salt is in agreement with the known greater tendency of the former to " assimilate " water .
The similarity in the effect produced on potassium nitrate by ethylic alcohol and by potassium chloride ( from values determined by Bodlander* ) is again an illustration of our contention that no distinction can be drawn between electrolytes and non-electrolytes as precipitants .
It remains to consider the somewhat peculiar behaviour of sodium chloride .
The inferior effect produced by small amounts of precipitant at 0 ' may be a consequence of the greater stability at this temperature of the " hydrated " salt complexes ; the superior effect produced at 25 ' may be attributed , on the other hand , to the lessened stability of these complexes at the higher temperature .
Evidently the salt is in a state of delicate * ' Z. ph .

In conclusion , it may be desirable again to emphasise our view that the phenomena of competitive dissolution are of a very complex character .
It would seem probable , however , that the precipitation of salts from solution is mainly due to what may be termed collectively " dehydration , " conditioned not only by the direct withdrawal of water from the solution by the precipitant but , in the case of neutral solvents particularly , also by the agency of the increased proportion of hydrone molecules brought into being in the water by the mechanical interposition of the molecules of the precipitant .
We desire to express our particular thanks to Mr. D. R Keller , who with unwearied perseverance and care has carried out much of the practical work .described in this communication , thereby rendering us invaluable assistance .

] It is well known that the a-particles emitted from a thin film of radioactive matter of one kind are initially projected at an identical speed .
Ko definite evidence , however , has yet been obtained whether a similar result holds for a substance which emits / 3-particles in its transformation .
Hahn has found by the electrical method that / 3-rays from a simple radioactive substance are absorbed very nearly according to an exponential law , and has utilised this property to decide whether the source ol / 3-rays consists of one or more products emitting / 3-particles .
This method , in the hands of Hahn and Meitner , has proved very fruitful in bringing to light new and unsuspected / 3-ray products.* In addition , it has been assumed by many * Hahn and Meitner , 'Phys .
