" On certain improvements on Photographic Processes described in a former communication .
" By Sir John Frederiek Wiliiam Her ?
schel , Bart , K.H. , F.R.S. , &amp; c , in a letter to Samuel Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. Communicated by Mr. Christie .
The present memoir , which is a sequel to the last by the same author , is accompanied by a series of photographic impressions illustrative of the chrysotype , cyanotype , and other processes formerly described by him .
Some improvements which he has introduced into these processes are given , together with a few remarks on some other points treated of in the former paper , in relation to the influence of thermic rays as distinct from calorific rays ; the former being rays , which in the spectrum accompany the red and orange rays , which are also copiously emitted by heated bodies short of redness , and which are distinguished from those of light by being invisible .
The author thinks they may be regarded as bearing the same rela ?
tion to the calorific spectrum which the photographic rays do to the luminous one , and would propose to designate them by the term paralhermic rays .
He conceives that these may be the rays which are active in producing those singular molecular affcctions determi ?
