" Experiments , made at Watford , on the Vibrations occasioned by Railway Trains passing through a Tunnel .
" By Sir JAMES SOUTH , LL. D. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. , one of the Visitors of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich .
Received June 17 , 1863* .
In the year 1846 an attempt was made to obtain the consent of the Lords of the Admiralty to run a railway through Greenwich Park , distant only 860 feet from the Royal Observatory , which would in the opinion of many competent judges have been most injurious to that Establishment .
Such consent their Lordships refused ; but as I was assured on high authority that this attempt was to be repeated , and that too with the fullest confidence of success on the part of its projectors and supporters , I determined to make experiments which might bear more decisively on the question of railway tremors , as affecting that Observatory , than those previously made by myself and others .
For this purpose it seemed indispensable that the station selected for making them should geologically resemble that of Greenwich , and that the astronomical means employed to detect the existence and determine the intenisity of the tremors should be , optically , at least equal to the telescope of the Greenwich Mural Circle .
As much importance"was attributed by the advocates of this railway to the supposed power of a tunnel to render the vibrations imperceptible , it was also desirable that it should be one of the conditions of these trials .
Having but little more than a popular knowledge of geology , I relied on my old and valued friend the late Mr. Warburton , who had recently been President of the Geological Society , to guide me in the choice of a station ; and it was on his authority that I fixed on the Watford Tunnel and its immediate vicinity .
There , under a light gravelly soil of 18 or 20 inches deep , lies a bed of gravel of considerable but variable thickness , sometimnes compact , at other times loose , and immediately under it chalk with occasional flints .
The tunnel , of which the bearing is 41ยง 19t to N.W. of the meridian , and by my measurement is 1812 yards long , passes principally through chalk ; its arch is about 24 feet in diameter , the crown of it being about 215 feet above the rails .
The thickness of the brickwork is about 18 inches ; the meani thickness of the chalk above the crown of the arch about 50 feet , whilst that of the gravel , though subject to great irregularity , may perhaps be regarded as 14 feet .
If so , we have outside the tunnel above the horizontal plane of the rails 87 feet of chalk , flint , gravel and soil , constituting an assemblage of which the power of transmitting tremors must be comparatively feeble .
There are five shafts in the tunnel , four of which are circular , 8-5 feet diameter , and one quadrangular , about 26 feet by 34 .
The tuinnel runs under the park of the Earl of Essex ; and though I had not the honour of a personal acquaintance with the Noble Earl , nor any introduction to him , yet on learning my objects he transmitted to me by return of post , from Carlsbad , a carte-blanche to erect my observatory wherever I pleased , though it were in the very heart of his choicest game preserves .
To him therefore is mainly due whatever benefit may accrue to science or to the Royal Observatory from the experiments recorded in this communication .
The point I selected was 302 yards distant from the centre of the line ; and the perpendicular from it on the axis of the tunnel meets that at a point 567 yards from the southern or London end of the tunnel , 124.5 yards from the Tring or north enzd , and 594 5 from the fourth shaft .
This is the centre of the Observatory which I erected there : it is of wood , as small as is consistent with the necessary accommodation , both for portability , and that it might be less agitated by the wind .
It is quadrangular , 12 feet by 10 , and its length is in the meridian ; the eaves are 85 feet , and the ridge of the roof 10 feet above the floor , this last-being 4 iilches above the grounid , which is nearly level with that over the tunnel .
The roof is covered with tarpaulins very well secured , so as not to be torn by a gale of wiYd .
In the south and west sides are four wilndows , which can be opened or shut at pleasure , to light the Observatory by day , or to see powder or other signals at night .
In the roof is no opening ; but in its northern side there is one which can be shut as required : it is little larger tihanwhat is absolutelynecessaryto allow the reflected rays from thePole-star to pass uninterruptedly to the observer 's eye through its whole revolutioni .
At its centre , parallel with its sides and resting on the undisturbed gravel 4 feet below the surface , is a mass of brickwork laid in excellent Roman cement , 8 by 3,5 feet at bottom , 7 by 3-5 at top , its length ruinning east and west .
On this stand two piers of similar brickwork , 18 inches by 14 , and 46 inches higher than the floor : they are capped by two Portland stones of similar horizontal section 8 inches thick .
In the interior faces of these stones are firmly fixed the Y-plates , which carry the Is on which the instrument 's pivots rest .
Eighteen inches north of the brick massive , but in the same plane with its base , is the centre of the base of another pier , brought up also in Roman cement , 24 inches from N. to S. , 18 from E. to W. ; and it rises 12 inches above the floor .
The upper surface is perfectly horizontal , and serves to support a vessel which contains mercury .
Both this pier and the massives are insulated from the floor , and touch the ground only at their bases .
The mercury-vessel was 18 inches by 43 , with its length in the meridiani .
The transit-instrument of the Campden Hill Observatory is far too precious to be exposed to the risks of such an expedition ; I therefore had one constructed which might be considered an excellent substitute .
The objectglass ( which under favourable circumstances will bear a power of 1000 ) is 87 inches focus and 4 75 aperture .
The tran-sverse axis is 31 inches ; and the Y has sufficient azimuthal motion to enable me to follow the Pole-star in its whole course , so that at any hour ( if clear ) I could have the reflected image of the star in the mercurial vessel ready to testify against the tremors caused by a train .
Supported by timber passing into the ground , but unconnected with the floor and convenient to a writing-desk which occupies the S.E. angle of the building , stands a journeyman clock .
It is set by my excellent gold pocketchronometer , Molyneux No. 963 , and rarely deviates from that more than oneor two-tenths of a second in three or four hours .
The clock of the Watford Station was compared with the chronometer , going and generally returning , for the purpose of identifying particular trains .
These details will , I hope , suffice to prove that every precaution was taken to obtain accurate results , and that those which I did obtain may be fairly considered as identical with what would have been found in a first-class observatory under the same circumstances of locality and traffic .
I was at my post to commence observations on December 22nd , 1846 ; but that and the three following nights were starless .
The 26th was fine , but , owing to the irregularity of the trains , and the want of well-organized signals , I could only satisfy myself that all was in good working order , and that the trains caused great disturbance .
For thirteen following nights I was at my post , but in vain ; all was dark , with the thermometer from 220 to 310 .
On January 11th , 1847 , it cleared , and I observed seven trains with decisive results , being able to announce their presence before it was known to my assistants , who were on the watch outside the observatory .
The Pole-star 's image as reflected from the mercurial surface , when no train was near , appeared As a very small , perfectly steady disk , thus .
( I. ) which as the train approached broke up into a quin } .
( 2 .
) tuple , thus-As the disturbance increased , the form be- ' came linear at right angles to the length. .
' eo O o. .
( 3 .
) of the mercury-vessel , thus ... j00 When the train was considerablyadvanced I -iu the tunnel , a cross formed , thus- .
( 4 .
) And when near the perpendicular from the ] observatory , three parallel lines of disks ap*0.00 " " .
, ... ( 5 .
) peared , thus.j still parallel to No. 3 .
As the tremors became more distant , these transformations of the image take place in a reverse order , until the star resumes its original disk-like form .
These results were strongly conspicuous even in a fully illuminated field , and equally so whether the magnifying power was 60 , 200 , or 750 .
The phenomena are very striking , from the contrast between the smaller images , which are blue , while the larger ones are reddish , and from the sudden way in which they break out .
The nights of the 13th and 14th were fine , and so thoroughly confirmed my previous observations that I felt it my duty to lose no time in informing the late Lord Auckland , then First Lord of the Admiralty , of the preceding details and of my conclusions from them , that a tunnel did not prevent great tremors from being propagated from it when a train was traversing it , certainly to the distance of 643 yards , and probably much fuLrther .
The impression which these facts -made on his Lordship he expressed in the following letter .
Copy of a Letter from the Earl of Auckland to Sir James South .
" Admiralty , January 26th , 1847 .
" SIn , -I have to return you many thanks for the very interesting report which you sent to me of your experiments upon the distance to which the vibration caused by steam-carriages within a tunnel extend ; and I cannot but admire the enterprise and ability with which these experiments were conducted .
They would be quite conclusive if the question of carrying a tunnel through Greenwich Park were again to be agitated .
" I am , very faithfully yours , " ' To Sir James South , A e. Syc .
" " AUCKLAND .
" The reserve with which I spoke of that further distance arose from the circumstance that I was not in possession of the exact measurements of the tunnel and the position of its shafts .
'I had twice applied for them in vain to the railway authorities , and was obliged at last to execute the measures myself * This consumed some time , and the observations were not completely resumed till February 24 , 1847 .
The process was this .
About 600 yards before the entrance of the tunnel a rocket was fired as a signal for attention .
At the instant that the engine passed the south end of the tunnel , one of Lord Essex 's game-keepers fired one barrel of 'his gun , and the other about a second after , which was necessary to distinguish this from the shots of poachers , who were often at work around me .
Similar shots were fired when the engine was at the centre of the 4th shaft ( which could be seen from above ) .
The times of these signals were taken by an assistant .
During this time I was at the telescope , and noticed the second when any peculiar phase of disturbance appeared .
The computation of the distance of the engine from the eye at a given time is very simple .
From the known distance of the south end of the tunnel and the 4th shaft from the eve , we know the times taken by the sound of the gun to reach the observatory .
The temperature was during the whole series so near 32 ?
that the velocity of sound for that temperature , 36313 yards , may be used without sensible error .
The effect of wind must also have been insensible .
Hence the signal from the south entrance was 15 77 too late , that from the shaft 19-84 .
Correcting the times and dividing by their difference the distance of the shaft from the entrance , 162 yards , we have the velocity of the train ( which , however , I have given in miles per hour , as affording a more familiar measure of the disturbing power ) .
Then the difference of the time of phase and corrected time of entrance gives the place of the engine on the line , and the perpendicular is given .
In the following record of the observations , the first column contains the number , the second the times , the third the facts observed , and the fourth gives the distance , then follow occasional remarks .
In the disturbances , I specially recorded as most definite the cross ( 4 ) , and the arrangement of bars of parallel stars ( 5 ) .
The slighter disturbances which precede or follow the former were seldom entered , though quite sensible .

iii6 S. 45'6 50'5 That these results may be more easily appreciated , I have condensed the most importalnt of them into the preceding Table , which gives in one view the distance at which that amount of disturbance begins and ends which produces the cross , that at which the far greater one occurs causing the appearance ( 5 ) ( a system of three or more parallel rows ) wherever it does appear , and the velocities and weights of the trains when known .
It is evident from this Table that the tremor which is sufficient to produce that disturbance of the mercury which shows a cross of stars is propagated to considerable distances-in one case to 11 76 yards ; and 24 per cent. of the entire are above 1000 .
Such distances do not pass the northern end of the tuninel , but go far beyond the southern .
In the latter case the vibrations are excited while the train is in arn open cutting ; and those who suppose that the tinnel has much power in deadening them would of course expect that they would be sensible at a greater distance than at the other end .
This does not seem , however , to be the case : and the Table shows that in this respect there is very little difference , if we take into account another cause of inequality , namely , that the tremor is manifested further at the exit than at the entrance of the train .
The column headed " Exit " shows by s. that the exit was at the South end , and the entrance at the North .
Now , when the observations are examined where both were noted , we find that the limit of the cross is greater at the exit than at the entrance in 29 out of 39 , or 74 per cent. of s. , and 12 out of 16 , or 75 per cent. of N. The reason of this , I suppose , is that the long-continued action of the train on the rails tends to produce a greater and more prolonged undulation in the mercury .
But the equal percentage shows that there is really no protecting power in the tunnel against the lateral propagation of tremors , whatever may be the case immediately above the crown .
In general one might expect trains to produce disturbance in proportion to their speed and their weight .
To a certain degree this is true ; but the exceptions are sufficient to show that other influences must be taken into consideration .
Examples of high speed with comparatively small effect are afforded by the observations on March 18 , II .
; 19 , III .
; and 29 , V. Others of the reverse conditions are given by February 24 , I. , II .
; March 18 , VI .
; and specially March 16 , III .
, in which with a velocity of only 11 4 miles the cross was shown at 1110 yards .
This it may be remarked is a decisive proof that any plan of protecting an observatory by slackening the speed of trains passing near it is entirely useless , even if it could be enforced .
It is probable that one cause of this high disturbing-power in slow trains is that already referred to , the long-continued accumulation of vibration , the quick ones passing beyond distance before the mercury has got into full vibration , the others having full time to do their work though with less intrinsic force .
On this account also long trains are more disturbing than short .
The engine is not so paramount a disturber as might be expected , the heaviest , and even a pair of them , not causing more tremor than occurs with the smaller ones .
In taking the cross of stars as the test of disturbance , I must observe that I do so , not because it is the earliest which appears , but because it marks distinctly an agitation greater than what is likely to occur at an observatory subject to ordinary perturbations .
These produce in such a mercuiryvessel as I used a single line of stars perpendicular to the length of the vessel .
It should seem that then only one set of undulations fit to produce these images is excited in the mercury , the direction of which is regulated by the sides of the vessel * .
The existence of the cross shows that a secolnd set of waves perpelndicular to the first has been developed : this always happens if the sides of the vessel are equal ; and its occurring when they are so unequal as in the present case seems to indicate a corresponding excess of the power which causes them .
If the agitation be still greater , it seems as if each of the images which form the cross became the origini of a row of secondary images , the result of which is the form ( 5 ) , a series of parallel rows of stars varying from two to ten , or even filling the whole field .
This token of ultra disturbance isconfined between lines making angles of 45 ?
with the perpendicular to the rails-in other words , to distances under 427 yards , and when the train is nearly in the centre of the tunnel .
It is ( except in two instances ) only seen when the cross is visible beyond 1000 vards : when the agitation is still further increased the images vibrate in every direction , and with yet more of it the whole becomes a mass of nebulous light ; of both which some examples may be found in these observations .
The opinion maintained by the late Mr. Robert Stephenson , that much of these railway tremors were due to the sound of the train , although not probable , induced me to try some experiments by firing cannon , maroons , and rockets at various distances .
One of these cannons ( for I had two , each of a pound calibre ) heavily loaded , at 300 yards produced ( 5 ) , cross , and line simultaneously with my hearing the reports ; but all disturbance was over in about 1-5 second .
At 2020 yards there was the cross synchronous with the report , and of the same momentary character ; and even at 3000 yards the cross could be traced .
This seems to have been due to the momentary impulse of the sound-wave , for the continuous roar of two-pound rockets fired at 82 feet from the mercury , though very loud , disturbed it very little ; while the explosions of eight ounces of powder in their heads about 800 yards above the ground produced all , the ( 5 ) , cross , and line .
A still more interesting experiment was , firing the cannon in the tunnel at the point where the perpendicular from the observatory met it .
In this case two disturbances were seen-one propagated through the ground , the other through the air with about a second of time interval .
The sound probably made its way chiefly through the shafts ; but even had they been closed , it seems unquiestionable that the report , and of course the sound of a train , would travel through the earth * .
I should have prosecuted these researches further , especially in reference to the velocity with which these tremors are propagated through the ground , but that Lord Auckland 's letter to me led me to hope that all danger to the Royal Observatory was past , never to return .
I therefore contented myself with reducing the observations I had made .
As , however , the Railway Moloch seems never likely to be satiated with victims , and as the observatories of Oxford , Armagh , and again that of Greenwich have been marked for sacrifice , it seems to me a duty to place before the public the facts which had been collected at a great expense of labour , nand some pecuniary outlay .
They were made without any bias , or any motive but a desire to ascertaini the actual truth ; and in addition to their bearing on practical astronomy , I hope that they may not be without use in reference to some other departments of science .
An interesting fact was observed with the maroons .
They were fired vertically from a mortar twenty feet from the observatory , and had fuses which gave them .
flight for six seconds .
The mercury showed the usual intense disturbance when the mortar was fired , and also at the explosion of the maroons in the air .
But there was also an initerrnediate disturbance which I cannot explain but by supposing it to be as it were an eclio of the earth-wave caused by the dischlarge of the mortar and reflected from the masonzry of the tunnel .
I showed it to the Marquis of Blandford , to Lord Alfred Churchill , and to Professor James MeCullagh ; unfortunately the nights Dr. Robiinson and Mr. Warburton accompanied me to Watford , not a sin-le star was visible .
