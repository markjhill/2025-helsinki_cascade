( Abstract .
) In the paper upon this subject , the principles upon which the theory of interdiffusion of gases depends , are applied to the diffusion of ions produced by Rontgen rays .
When a gas has been left to itself , the conductivity gradually disappears .
When no electromotive forces are acting , the loss of conductivity is due partly to positive and negative ions coming into contact with each other , and partly to the effect of the surface of the vessel , which discharges those ions which come into contact with it .
In order to illustrate in a simple way the principles which are involved , we take the case of a gas contained in a metal sphere , and consider what happens to the ions after the gas has been removed from the influence of the rays .
For present purposes we may neglect the effect of recombination .
The ions may be considered as constituting a separate gas , the molecules of which may be either bigger or smaller than the molecules of the gas in which they are immersed .
When an ion comes into contact with the surface of the sphere it loses its charge , so that the metal may be regarded as a body which completely absorbs the ions .
The reduction in the conductivity by the diffusion of the ions to the sides , is exactly analogous to the removal of moisture from a gas by bubbling it through sulphuric acid .
The more rapidly the water vapour diffuses through the gas , the greater will be the number of water molecules which come into contact with the acid round the bubble .
If the quantity of moisture which is removed be found experimentally , the coefficient of diffusion of water vapour into the gas can be deduced.* It would be impracticable to use this method to find the coefficient of diffusion of ions into a gas contained in a large vessel , as the loss of conductivity due to recombination would be large compared with the loss due to the sides .
The method which was employed was to pass a uniform stream of gas through fine metal tubing , and to allow the rays to fall on the gas immediately before entering the tubing .
The bore of the tubing can be so adjusted that the number of ions which come into contact with the sides will be large compared with the number which recombine .
It is convenient to use tubing of such a length , that the conductivity will be reduced to about one half its initial value .

The Diffusion of Ions Gases .
In order to obtain the coefficient of diffusion when the reduction in the conductivity has been found experimentally , the following problem presents itself :\#151 ; If a small quantity of a gas , A , is mixed with another gas , B , and the mixture passed along a tube , the sides of which completely absorb A , to find what quantity of A emerges from the tube with B. It will be immediately seen that if the gases diffuse rapidly into each other , a large proportion of the molecules of the gas A will come into contact with the surface of the tube and will there be absorbed .
If on the other hand the rate of interdiffusion is very small , the molecules of A will travel down the tube in straight lines parallel to the axis of the tube , and practically none of them will come into contact with the surface .
The complete solution of the above problem may be obtained from the following equations :\#151 ; -pu \#151 ; K + nXe , ax -pv = -li + nYe , k1 die - me = -^r-+ nZe + -k 1 dz K and the equation of continuity ~ ( pu ) + ~ ( pv ) + Jb ( pw ) =0 ; where n is the number of ions per cubic centimetre ; p their partial pressure ; e the charge on each ion ; X , Y , and Z the electric forces at any point ; u , v , and w the velocities of the ions ; W the velocity of the gas B through the tube ; k the coefficient of diffusion of the ions into the gas B. The partial differential coefficient with respect to the time , is omitted from the equation of continuity , as we need only consider the steady state .
The term dp/ dz may be omitted from the third equation , as it is small compared with the other terms .
2Y a2 ( a2 - r2 ) , where Y is the mean velocity of the gas B , defined by the condition mi2Yt= total volume of gas crossing any section in a time t , a the radius of the tube , and r the perpendicular distance of any point from the axis .
The forces X , Y , Z vanish since the electrification is too small to contribute appreciably to the motion of the ions .
The boundary conditions are:\#151 ; p = 0 when r = a , p = constant when = 0 .
Mr. J. S. Townsend .
The solution of the problem requires a somewhat lengthy analysis , so that we give here only the final result .
The ratio of the number of ions ( or molecules of the gas A ) coming out of the tube with B to the number which enter is 7*313rz 44*5kz R = 4[0T952 e + 0-0243 + \amp ; c. ] , where z is the length of the tube .
The other terms of the series are too small to be taken into con sideration .
Haying determined the reduction in conductivity , due to tubes of different lengths , the following values of the coefficients of diffusion of ions into air , oxygen , carbonic acid , and hydrogen , were obtained .

Considering one of the equations of motion ^-pu \#151 ; -\lt ; ~- + nK.e , K. ChtJC we see that when dp/ dx \#151 ; 0 , the velocity u due to the electric force X is nXei(/ p.

195 Let N be the number of molecules in a cubic centimetre of a gas at pressure P , equal to the atmospheric pressure , and temperature 15 ' centigrade , the temperature at which u and k were determined .
The quotient N/ P may be substituted for nip in the above equation , and since the atmospheric pressure P is 106 in C.G.S. units , we obtain \#151 ; T 3 x 10%i No = -----------K The following values of No thus obtained for different gases are Air ... ... ... ... ... ... N( ?

Experiments on electrolysis show that one electrodynamic unit of electricity in passing through an electrolyte , gives off P23 c.c. of hydrogen at temperatures 15 ' and pressure 10 ' C.G.S. units .
The number of atoms in this volume is 2'46 N , so that if E is the charge on an atom of hydrogen in the liquid electrolyte , 2'46NE = 1 electrodynamic unit of quantity = 3 x 1010 electrostatic units .
Hence NO = 1*22 x 1010 , the charge E being expressed in electrostatic units .
Since N is a constant , we conclude that the charges on the ions produced by Rontgen rays in air , oxygen , carbonic acid , and hydrogen , are all the same , and equal to the charge on the hydrogen ion in a liquid electrolyte .
Professor Thomson !
has shown that the charge on the ions in hydrogen and oxygen which have been made conductors by Rontgen rays , is 6 x 10-10 electrostatic unit , and is the same for both gases .
Taking this value for the charge e , we obtain the number of molecules in a cubic centimetre of a gas N = 2 x 1012 .
From this we deduce the weight of a molecule of hydrogen , pfN , 4'5 x 10-24 gram .

On the Premice of Oyxgen Since , as we have shown , the charge on an ion produced by Rontgen rays is equal to the charge on a hydrogen ion in a liquid electrolyte , this latter charge is also 6 x 10 '10 electrostatic unit .
Although the value of No for hydrogen is 25 per cent , less than its value for other gases , we are justified in including hydrogen in the above general conclusion , as we should expect the value of u for hydrogen to be too small .
Professor Rutherford inakes no mention of having corrected for the presence of air in his apparatus , or of having used perfectly dry hydrogen .
If we take the mean value of k for moist hydrogen , we obtain Neji t= 1*15 x 1010 .
In order to prove that the charge on the positive ion is equal to the charge on the negative ion , the ratio of the coefficients of diffusion must be shown to be equal to the ratio of the velocities .
Professor Zeleny* has shown that the negative ions travel faster under an electromotive force than the positive ions , the ratios of the velocities being 1-24 for air and oxygen , 1*15 for hydrogen , and PO for carbonic acid .
The experiments on diffusion show that the ratio of the velocities would be larger in dry than in moist gases ; but as this point has not yet been examined by Professor Zeleny , we cannot expect a very close agreement between the ratios which he gives for the velocities and the ratios of the coefficients of diffusion .
We are led to conclude that the charges on the positive and negative ions are equal from another point of view .
It has been proved that the mean charge is the same as the charge on an ion of hydrogen in a liquid electrolyte .
If the charges differed , one of them would be less than the charge on the hydrogen ion , whereas experiments on electrolysis show that all ionic charges are either equal to the charge on the hydrogen ion or an exact multiple of it .

Mr. Frank McClean draws attention to the grouping of lines other than those of helium and hydrogen in the spectra of ( 3 Scorpii , ( 3 Canis Majoris , ( 3 Centauri and ( 3 Crucis , suggesting that the close correspondence between the grouping of these extra lines and the known lines of oxygen , points to the probable presence of that gas in the atmospheres of these stars .
