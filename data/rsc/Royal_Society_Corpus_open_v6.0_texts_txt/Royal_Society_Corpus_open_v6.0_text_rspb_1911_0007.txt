235 Note upon the Examination , icith Negative , the Central Nervous System in a Case of Cured Human Trypanosomiasis .
By Frederick W. Mott , M.D. , F.R.S. ( Received October 22 , \#151 ; Read November 3 , 1910 .
) This is the first case in which " a chance has occurred of examining a cured case of human trypanosomiasis post according to the statement of C. A. Wiggins , the Acting Principal Medical Officer of the Uganda Protectorate , who has kindly forwarded me the tissues for microscopic examination .
Summary of the History of the Case.\#151 ; Narain Singh , a Sikh , belonging to the 4th K.A.R. ( aged 30 at death ) , was found to be suffering from trypanosomiasis in June , 1905 , and received treatment with inorganic arsenic .
The previous history as far as ascertainable , compiled from extracts of reports and history sheets , is published in the full account , but , in brief , it may be assumed that the drug was given intermittently for 18 months or more , and pushed till toxic symptoms of neuritis , mental dullness , etc. , rendered further energetic treatment impossible ; trypanosomes were then no longer obtained by puncture of the glands .
Unfortunately there is no note of lumbar puncture having been performed until a few months before death , therefore we do not know whether invasion of the sub-arachnoid space ever occurred either before or after the treatment .
But it is probable that trypanosomes were never present in the cerebro-spinal fluid , for if they were , the symptoms of Sleeping Sickness would , in all probability , have come on , in spite of treatment by atoxyl .
Sir David Bruce , in December , 1908 ( that is three and a half years after the trypanosomiasis had been discovered ) , saw this man , and stated that he appeared to be in excellent health .
A year later he was seen by Captains Hamerton and Bateman , who reported no symptoms of Sleeping Sickness .
They made a very careful investigation of the blood , both by microscopic examination and by experimental injection into monkeys ; the results were negative .
In June , 1910 , lumbar puncture was performed , and 17 c.c. of fluid withdrawn ; the centrifuged fluid showed no lymphocytosis or trypanosomes ; and injection of the fluid into a monkey was followed by negative results .
The patient was attacked with pneumonia in August , 1910 , and died three days after admission to the hospital .
At the 'post-mortem examination grey hepatisation of the whole right lung was discovered .
Beyond fibrosis and induration of the cervical and inguinal 236 Dr. F. W. Mott .
Examination of Nervous [ Oct. 22 , glands there was nothing noteworthy in the appearance of the organs and tissues .
The brain was quite normal in appearance , and there was no excess of fluid .
It may be mentioned that this man contracted syphilis on July 27 , 1906 , and he was treated for some time with mercury , and a note on February 15 , 1908 , is as followsCondition the same as August 6 , 1907 , but no trypanosomes found in blood or glands , due to fact of taking mercury for syphilis .
Histological Examination.\#151 ; Sections were prepared of portions of the cerebrum , cerebellum and medulla oblongata , by all the methods which I have previously adopted for the examination of the tissues of Sleeping Sickness cases .
I found no trace of the characteristic meningeal and perivascular infiltration , nor of gliosis .
Sections of the spleen , liver , and kidney were also examined with negative results .
I have shown that there is a parallelism between the intensity of the signs and symptoms of Sleeping Sickness and the diffuseness and intensity of the lymphatic perivascular infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells which is the main cause of the clinical phenomena .
It may be asserted that this case proves that human trypanosomiasis is curable , but it does not prove that Sleeping Sickness is curable , for I contend that the diagnosis of " Sleeping Sickness " can only be made when there is proof that the trypanosomes have invaded the suh-arachnoid space .
The case emphasises the importance of early diagnosis of the infection and the value of early energetic treatment by organic arsenic preparations .
How far the administration of mercury assisted to complete the cure is uncertain .
