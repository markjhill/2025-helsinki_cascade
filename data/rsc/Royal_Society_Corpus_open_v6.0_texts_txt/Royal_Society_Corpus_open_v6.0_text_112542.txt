V. " Observations of the Spectra of some of the Southern Nebulae .
" By Lieut. JOHN HERSCHEL , R.E. Communicated by W. HUGGINS , Esq. Received May 20 , 1868 .
[ Lieut. Iherschel , to whom the observations of the solar eclipse of August next have been entrusted by the Royal Society , has already employed the instruments , placed in his hands by the Royal Society for the observations of the eclipse , to good account by commencing an exa-mination of some of the brightest of the nebulme of the southern heavens .
The first results of this examination , which are contained in the present paper , were obtained at Bangalore , Madras Presidency , during the months of March and April 1868 .
The instruments consist of an equatorially mounted telescope of 5 inches aperture , driven by a clock fuirnished with a pendulum-governor by Cooke and Sons , and a spectroscope by Messrs. Simms furnished with one dense prism of flint glass , and with a micrometer-screw and photographic scale for measuring the lines .
The rtebuloe No. 4390 and No. 2102 have beeni described by me , Phil. Trans. 1864 , p. 439 , and Phil. Trans. 1866 , p. 383 .

A large cluster visible to the naked eye , oval-shaped , brighter towards the central part .

An unsatisfactory observation : to be looked for again .

Found with difficulty in the spectroscope .
After a minuteor two 's examination the tube was accidentally disturbed , and before direction could be again obtained , clouds had gathered anddwork was stopped .
Appearance in teiescope : a nebulous-looking star ; under a higher power a nebuloUs-looking object with a mucb brighter nucleus or centre .
In spectroscope : a continuous streak with a blotch of light nearly in the gniddle of its length , two-fifths , by estimation , from the red end ; slit quite wide .

] April 2 .
A pretty well-defined and bright short line was distinctly visible in the spectroscope , accompaniied by a considerably fainter and more refrangible companion .
Principal line measured with the wires and founed to be D+21=4 4 ( b=3'97 , F=5-03 ) , i. e. 6+0 4 .

; globular cluster , very bright , larg , e , extremelY compressed in the middle .
] April 5 .
Seen in telescope as a slightly oval nebulous ball , easily seen but not very bright ( perhaps owing to mooln , nearly full ) ; found with some difficulty in spectroscope ; a faint contintuotus spectrum of considerable width ; no trace or suspicion of lines .
( No. 4173 .
Seen easily in telescope ; but looked for in spectroscope for two hours in vain .
) No. 4390 .
[ zR 18h 61 : N.P.D. 83ยง 10 ' : planetary nebula ; very bright , very small , little hazy .
] April 6 .
Scarcely recognized as a nebula in the telescope .
Seen in spectroscope : a shorl 6riyht line with a fainter one on the more refrangible side , and a third strongly suspected .
( Knowing so well the relative positions of the " usual " lines , it is impossible that an unprejudiced corroborative opinion can be offered on such slight foundation as I have .
) A very slight extension laterally was giveni in this instance with the cylindrical lens .
No. 2102 .
[ At 1oh 18rn : N.P.D. 107 59 ' : ! !
; planetarynebula , very bright , little extended .
] April 9 .
Seen at once in telescope with low power ; and seen distinctly in the spectroscope as a bright and a faint line ( the third line not seen ) ; prinicipal line measured with wires and found =D+ { 214= 2 15 } , or b+ 0,48 , F=b + 1-06 .
No. 1179 .
Nebula in Orion .
Examined for comparison .
The spectruim of this nebula shows the three lines distinctly , and three only ; they were measured ( with wires ) , and the results were:[2-17 D+ 42:20=2 d19 =6+0.52 , I. 212 D+ { 240-=236 } =6+069 , and D+ 2 78 =b+l 11 .
The places and descriptions of the objects enclosed within brackets are taken from Sir John Herschel 's " General Catalogue of Nebulae " in the Phil. Trans. for 1864 .
P.S.-The other day a storm passed over us .
As there was a good deal of lightning , I took the opportunity to examine its spectrum .
I saw , as I expected , numerous bright lines ; the blue nitrogeni one , I suppose , much the brightest .
A suspicion also of the red hydro( en-line C. I was much surprised at the brightness of the continuous spectrum , in which all the principal prismatic colours were brilliaint .
