] certain Definite Integrats .
I observe that in ( 28 ) and must be odd and even or vice and that in ( 29 ) must be even and odd .

I have selected as examples those which seemed most suitable to be brought before the Royal Society .
P.S.\mdash ; The following were added 13th February , 1877:\mdash ; .
