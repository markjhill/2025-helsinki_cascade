] The ingenious and beautiful application , made by Capt. Kater , of Huygens 's theorem respecting the convertibility of the centres of suspension and oscillation , to the determination of the length of the simple pendulum , is to be considered as a first approximation to the solution of this problem .
The accuracy of this determination , however , may be affected by many circumstances which the theory does not take into account ; and the object of the author in this paper is to investigate the limits of the errors that may arise from neglecting them .
Laplace and Whewell have shown that when the knife-edges are considered as cylinders of small but of equal radii of curvature , their distance is still equal to the length of the simple pendulum .
The author treats the question with the utmost generality , and discusses all the circumstances which may affect the accuracy of Capt. Kater 's method , including all possible deviations and positions of the axes .
He takes , as an example , the pendulum used by Mr. Bailey , and described by him in the Philosophical Magazine of last February ; and investigates the errors which would arise in the length of the simple pendulum corresponding to given deviations of the knife-edges .
He also considers the case in which the agate planes are fixed on the pendulum , and vibrate on a fixed knife-edge ; and finds that the length of the simple pendulum is here also equal to the distance between the planes .
