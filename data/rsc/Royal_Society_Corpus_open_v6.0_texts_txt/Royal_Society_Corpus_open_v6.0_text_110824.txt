" On the Organ of Hearing in Crustacea .
" By Arthur Far , M.D. , F.R.S. The author finds that in the Lobster ( Astacus marinus ) , the organ of hearing consists of a transparent and delicate vestibular sac , which is contained in the base , or first joint of the small antennae ; its situa ?
tion being indicated externally by a slight dilatation of the joint at this part , and also by the presence of a membrane covering an oval aper ?
ture , which is the fenestra ovalis .
The inner surface of the sac gives origin to a number of hollow processes , which are covered with minute hairs and filled with granular matter , apparently nervous .
A delicate plexus of nerves , formed by the acoustic nerve , which is a separate branch supplied from the supra-oesophageal ganglion , is distributed over the base of these processes and around the sac .
Within the sac there are always found a number of particles of siliccous sand , which are admitted , together with a portion of the surrounding water , through a valvular orifice at the mouth of the sac , being there placed apparently for the express purpose of regulating the size of the grains .
The author considers these siliccous parti ?
cles as performing the office of otolites , in the same way as the stones taken into the stomachs of granivorous birds supply the office of gastric teeth .
Several modifications of this structure exhibited in the organs of hearing of the Astacus fluviatilis , Pagurus strebb lonyx , and Palinurus quadricomis are next described , and an explanation attcmpted of the uses of the several parts and their subserviency to the purposes of that sense .
The author concludes by a description of another organ situated at the base of the large antennce , which it appears has been confounded with the former by some anatomists , but which the author conjectures may possibly constitute an organ of smell .
The paper is accompanied by illustrative drawings .
