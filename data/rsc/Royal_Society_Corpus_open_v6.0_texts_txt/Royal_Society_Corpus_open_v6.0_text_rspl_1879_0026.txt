From this it may be shown that if the density of the sphere is greater than the fluid it is attracted , whilst if less it will be attracted or repelled , according as its distance is less or greater than a certain critical distance , which is given by r=-\#151 ; rj-^/ 1~ + 1 1 * ^'r ^ns*ance ' v i1-v -*\#163 ; -1 if p=-9 , this distance = 7'648 , the radius of the free sphere .

( Abstract .
) In its general scope the paper is intended to deal with difficulties in microscopic research , usually found insuperable\#151 ; such , for iustance , as the invisibility of minute closely 'packed refracting spherules , existing in double rouleaux , or promiscuously aggregated , when their individual diameter varies between the 1\#151 ; 80,000th to the 1\#151 ; 200,000th of an inch .

165 These difficulties are principally created by overlapping images\#151 ; due partly to residuary aberrations both spherical and chromatic\#151 ; partly tc tho effects of diffraction , caused by brilliant illuminations of spurious disks of light\#151 ; partly to the constant development of Eidola or false images , which vary the loci of their development according to the nature of underlying structures and according to the object-glasses being over or under corrected ; and they are partly , and indeed very considerably , created by the use of excessively large angular apertures .
The paper discusses also , the relative effects on visibility , of large and small angular apertures in objectives .
It shows that the black margins or black marginal annuli of refracting spherules , constantly displayed by low aperture glasses , are attenuated gradually to invisibility as the glasses employed are endowed with the largest apertures .
That the black margins also of cylinders , tubules , or semi-tubules suffer similar obliterations .
And that , in consequence , innumerable minute details are concealed or destroyed till the aperture is sufficiently reduced .
That minute refracting bodies obey the laws of their refrangibilities and display beautiful phenomena , discoverable by transcendent powers of definition ; but totally unseen by inferior compensations .
And that , in consequence , the so-called achromatism of modern glasses is an illusory approximation to correct vision .
Examples are given of molecular structures , varying in form , trans-lucency , and refrangibility , in which natural pencils are caught and displayed in the order in which , as in a rain drop , iridescent rays are emitted by the decomposed light .
Several examples are also introduced , in which a high order of lenticular correction beautifully discovers structure hidden , according to Dr. Carpenter , E.R.S. , from the great bulk of observers .
As the paper deals so often with magnitudes very much less than the 1-100,000th of an inch , a method is introduced of readily estimating roughly such magnitudes between the 1\#151 ; 80,000th and the 1-500,000th of an inch , by means of a micrometer gauge .
The writer has been emboldened to grapple with these difficult minutiae , in consequence of the sharp and clear definition he has attained of spider lines miniatured down to the fourteenth part of a hundred-thousandth of an inch .
The eye , accustomed to contemplate this subtlety of form , readily appreciates the one-fourth or sixth of this size , i.e. , 1-400,000th or 1-600,000th .
The writer has also ventured to bring before the notice of the Royal Society , a new test for the microscope , displaying bright lines of uniform thickness less than the 1\#151 ; 100,000th , and sharp black lines of much less tenuity than those given by Robert 's celebrated lines ruled on glass , and incomparably more easy of illustration .

[ June 19 The employment of various fluids for immersion lenses is carefully considered ; and the singular property of castor oil discovered by the writer is referred to .
As the Society honoured the writer by inserting in their " Transactions " a paper on " A Searcher for Aplanatic Images , " he now introduces a new form which offers some advantages : by its extended traverse , by its simplicity and economy of light with increase of magnifying power .
Finally , some examples are given of producing transcendent definition in cases found hopeless by a numerous body of observers ; as the papers written in " The Monthly Microscopical Journal " during the last ten years abundantly demonstrate .
The means also of its attainment are minutely described .

In a recent communication to the Royal Society , Mr. Lockyer has criticised our statement of Young 's wave-length identifications of certain chromospheric lines .
As to the wave-length , we have throughout our table omitted all figures after the decimal point merely for the sake of not cumbering the table .
The numbers , Young tells us , are not his own , but taken from Angstrom 's catalogue .
Moreover , as to Young 's identifications with metallic lines , he states expressly that they were taken from the maps of Kirchhoff , Angstrom , and Thalen , and Watts 's " Index of Spectra .
" But our object was not to criticise Young 's work , but only to use it for the purpose of comparing the behaviour of certain metals on the earth and in the sun , and the conditions under which certain lines appear , or do not appear , or are reversed .
We should perhaps have made our meaning clearer if we had given another column with the wave-lengths of the metallic lines referred to side by side with Young 's numbers for the chromospheric lines .
We mentioned , in relation to aluminium , the two lines with wave-lengths 6245'4 and 6237'3 seen by Young , not because we thought their identity with the aluminium lines proved , but because they are the only two lines in Young 's table which are at all close to aluminium lines , and if they be not due to that metal , then we have the remarkable fact that aluminium in the .
sun gives no lines either dark or bright except the two which have been reversed on the earth .
A somewhat similar remark applies to the potassium lirfes , only in that case .
Young 's line has a wave-length very nearly the mean of the two
