V. O On the Actionl of Acids on Glycol " ( Second Notice .
) By Dr. MAXWELL SIMPSON .
Communicated by Dr. FRANK LAND .
Received June 29 , 18590 Since my last communicatioi to the Society , I have discovered a more convenienlt process for the preparation of chloracetinie of glycol .
I have ascertained that the mnonoacetate of glycol is as readily converted into this substance by the action of hydrochloric acid , as a mixture of acetic acid and glycol .
As the monoacetate is easily obtained , and for this purpose need not be quite pure , it is possible by this method to prepare the body in question on a large scale and with great facility .
It is simply necessary to conduct a stream of dry hydrochloric acid gas into the monoacetate , maintained at the temperature of 1000 C. , till the quanitity of oil precipitated on the additlon of water ceases to inerease .
The wihole is then well washed with water , dried by means of chloride of calcium , and distilled .
Almost the entire quantity passes over betweeni 1440 and 1460 C. A portion of liquid prepared in this maanner gave the following numbers on analysis , which leave no doubt as to its identity Theory .

H Cl I have made a determinationi of the vapour-density of chloracetine , and obtained resuilts conifirmatory of the formula I have given for this body : experimental vapour-density 4-369 , calculated 4-231 for 4 volumes .
I have also ascertained that oxide of ethylene is formed , and not glycol , when this substance is acted upon by a solution of potash .
The following equation will explain the reaction C4 H } 02+2 } 02 ?

C4113,02 K J2 Acttion of Chloracetine of Glycol on Butyrate of Silver.-Forrnation of Buttyroacetate of Glycol .
Equivalent quantities of chloracetine and butyrate of silver were exposed in a balloon with a long neck to a temperature ranging between I00 ?
and 2000 C+ , till all the silver salt had been tonverted into chloride .
The product was then digested with ether , filtered , and the filtered liquor submitted to distillation .
As soon as all the ether had been driven off , the thermometer rose rapidly to 180 ?
and between that temperature and 2150 almost the entire quantity passed over .
This was fractioned , and the portion distilling between 2080 and 21 5 was set apart for aiialysis .
The nrmubers obtained lead to 04 114 the formula C 4113 02 04 , as will be seen from the following percentage table Theory .

8'04 8-20 7-97 10000 I also made a determination of the acids by heating a weighed quantity of the ether with hydrate of baryta in the usual malnner .
The quantity of sulphate of baryta obtained indicated 2-2 equivalents of acid for one equivalent of the substance analysed .
The ex cess of acid was probably owing to the presence in the ether of a trace of free butyric acid .

This ether , which I may call butyroacetate of glycol , has a bitter pungent taste .
It is insoluble in water , but soluble in alcohol .
It is specifically heavier than water .
It is a very stable body , -solution of potash , even when boiling , effecting its decomposition with difficulty .
I have no doubt that many analogous compounds may be prepared in the manner I have just described .
Action of Chloracetine of Glycol on Ethylate of Soda .
In the hope of forming a compound intermediate between diacetate of glycol and diethylglycol , I resolved to try the action of chloracetine on ethylate of soda , thinking that probably the body in question might be generated by the following reaction : C 04 114 C ?
C0 H1 C 113031 02+ 4 5}02 Q41H3 02 04 ?
Na Cl. C ] In order to settle this point , I exposed equivalent quantities of these bodies in a sealed balloon to the temperature of a water-bath for about two hours .
My expectations , however , were not realized .
On opening the balloon , I found that the reaction had proceeded too far , acetic ether having been formed along with the chloride of sodium .
Action of Hydrochloric and Butyric Acids on Glycol.-Formation of Chlorbutyrine of Glycol .
This compound is prepared in the same manner as its homologue , namely by transmitting a stream of dry hydrochloric acid gas through a mixture of equivalent quantities of butyric acid and glycol , maintained at the temperature of 1000 C. As soon as the reaction is finished , the product is well washed with water , dried by means of chloride of calcium , and distilled .
The greater part passes over between 1600 and 182 ' .
This must be rectified , and the quantity distilling between 1750 und 1820 collected apart .
This gave , on analysis , results agreeing with the formula C H4 o}Osa will be seen from the following table Cl L. II .

Chlorbutyrine of glycol , as I may call this compound , has a pungent and somewhat bitter taste .
It boils at about 190Q .
Its specific gravity at zero is 1-0854 .
It is insoluble in water , but freely soluble in alcohol .
It is decomposed with difficulty by a boiling solution of potash , but readily by solid potash , ,-chloride of potassium , butyrate of potash , and oxide of ethylene , being formed .
I have ascertained that acetobutyrate of glycol , the ether I have already described , can be prepared from this body as well as from chloracetine , by exposing it to the action of acetate of silver .
The process is the same as that I have already given , with this difference , that the reacting bodies must not be heated above 150 ?
C. The ether prepared in this manner gave the following numbers on analysis e Theory .

Action of Hydrochloric and Benzoic Acids on Glycol.-Formation of Chlorbenzoate of Glycol .
A mixture of equivalent quantities of glycol and benzoic acid , previously fused and powdered , was exposed to the action of dry hydrochloric acid gas for several hours , the mixture being maintained at the temperature of 1000 during the action of the acid , as in the case of the former compounds .
The product tbus formed presented the appearance of a soft white solid , and contained a considerable quantity of uncombined benzoic acid .
This was removed by agitating it with hot water , till , on cooling , it no longer became solid , but remained perfectly fluid .
Filnally it was dissolved in alcohol , and precipitated by water .
The body thus prepared , and without being distilled , was analysed , havring been previously dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid .
Another specimen , prepared in the same manner , at a different tinme , was also arnalysed , having , however , been previously distilled , During the distillation it was observed that not a drop of fluid passed over till the mercury had risen to 2540 , and between that temperature and 2700 the entire liquid distilled over .
What passed over between 2600 and 270 ?
was collected separately ; this was the portion analysed .

17-93 100'00 The portion not distilled contained doubtless a trace of free benzoic acid , which would affect the carbon and chlorine , but not the hydrogen .
Chlor-benzoate of glycol , as I shall call this compound , has a pungent and somewhat bitter taste .
It is insoluble in water , but freely soluble in alcohol and ether .
Boiling solution of potash effects its decomposition with difficulty , solid potash readily , the reaction being the same as in the case of the analogous compounds .
Action of Hydriodic Acid on Glycol.-Formnation of Iodide of Ethylene on lodhydrine of Glycol .
Hydriodic acid gas is absorbed with great energy by glycol .
A considerable quantity of heat is evolved during the passage of the gas , and the liquor becomes black and thick from the separation of free iodine .
On removing the iodine by means of dilute potash , a mass of small white crystals is brought to light , which I at once suspected to be iodide of ethylene .
To remove all doubt on this point , I submitted the crystals to analysis , having previously purified them , by recrystallizing from boiling alcohol .
The numbers obtained agree with the formula of iodide of ethylene : Theory .

That the action of hydriodic acid on glycol shouldI be different from that of hydrochloric acid is doubtless owing to the bond of union between hydrogen and iodine being much weaker than that between hydrogen and chlorine .
If , on the other hand , the temperature of the glycol be prevented from rising during the passage of the hydriodic acid gas , by surrounding the vessel containing it with cold water , a liquid product is obtained , which is coloured dark-brown by free iodine .
This I have not as yet been able to discover any means of purifying , it being soluble in water , and decomposed by distillation .
I believe , however , it is the compound corresponding to chlorhydrine of glycol ( C'4 i ' 02 ) discovered by MI .
Wurtz .
A portion of this liquid , from which I had simply removed the free iodine , by agitationi with mercury , gave , on analysis , numbers agreeing tolerably well with the formula of iodhydrine .
After the analysis , however , I discovered that it containied a considerable quantity of iodide of mercury in solution .
Another portioni , from which I had removed the iodine by means of metallic silver , gave , on analysis , II -I per cent. carbon and 3'5 hydrogen , instead of 13 9 carbon and 30 hydrogen .
After all , an analysis is not necessary to enable us to arrive at the compositioIn of this body .
The products formed by the action of potash on it furnish us with almost as convincing a proof of its composition as any analysis could do .
They are iodide of potassium and oxide of ethylene .
lodhydrine of glycol is soluble in water and alcohol , but insoluble in ether .
It has no taste at first ; after a time , however , it almost burns the tongue , it is so pungent .
It is decomposed by heat into iodide of ethylene , and probably glycol .
It acts with great energy on the salts of silver .
Action of Hlydriodic and Acetic Acids on Glycol.-Formation of Jodacetine of Glycol .
A streamn of hydriodic acid gas was conducted into a mixture of equivalent quantities of glacial acetic acid and glycol , the temperature of which was prevented from rising during the action of the gas .
As soon as a portion of the liquid gave a considerable quantity of an oily precipitate on the addition of water , the passage of the gas was interrupted ; for the prolonged action of the gas is apt to give rise to the formation of iodide of ethylene .
The liquid thus obtained was well washed with very dilute potash , dried in vacuo , and analysed .
The numbers obtained lead to the formula C4 Ho O. , as will be seen from the following table : I Theory .

It is insoluble in water , bit soluble in alcohol and ether .
Its specific gravity is greater than that of water .
It crystallizes in tables when exposed to cold .
Heated with potash , it gives iodide of potassium , acetate of potash , and oxide of ethylene .
It is readily decomposed by the salts of silver .
This compound can also be prepared with great facility by exposing monoacetate of glycol to the action of bydriodic acid gas .
The liquid must be kept cold during the action of the gas , which should be interrupted as soon as the addition of water to a portion of it causes any abundant oily precipitate .
The whole is them washed with dilute potash , and dried in vacuo .
A specimien prepared in this manner gave , on analysis , 22-62 per cent. carbon and 3 43 hydrogen , instead of 22-42 carbon and 3-27 hydrogen .
I hope soon to have an opportunity of studying these iodine compounlds more particularly .
Action of Anhydrous Acetic Acid on Glycol.-Forrnation of MIoo-e acetate of Glycol .
A mixture of equivalent quantities of ainhydrous acetic acid and glycol was heated in , a sealed tube for several hours at a temperature not exceeding 170 ?
C. On opening the tube , and submitting its contents to distillation , it was observed that the mercury remained stationary for a considerable time at about 120 ?
, the point of ebullition of glacial acetic acid , and then rose rapidly to 180 ?
