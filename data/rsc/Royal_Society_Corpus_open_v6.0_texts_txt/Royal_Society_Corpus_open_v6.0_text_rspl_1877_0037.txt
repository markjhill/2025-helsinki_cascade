Observations of the physical properties of chemical compounds have been very numerous ; in many , however , the object aimed at has been merely the definition of the substances in question , and the results lay claim to no great accuracy .
In others , data have been required for the solution of purely physical problems , and but little attention has been paid to the chemical nature of the substances employed .
In comparatively few has equal importance been attached to both the physical and chemical aspects of the question .
If , then , we attempt to compare the physical properties of a series of compounds presenting very similar chemical properties , we find that in the case of one or two members of the series our knowledge is tolerably * By the excellent researches of Dallinger and Drysdale it has been proved that the germs of Monads , as compared with the adult organisms , possess a power of resistance to heat in the proportion of 11 to 6 .

239 jomplete , but that with regard to the others little is known but their approximate boiling-points and densities .
Among the alcohols of the C"H(a\#187 ; +i ) .
OH series , for example , there ire two ( methyl and ethyl alcohols ) with whose physical properties , ve are well acquainted .
The expansion of these bodies has been determined by Kopp , Pierre , Mendelejeff , and others ; the vapour-tensions , atent and specific heats by Eegnault ; the latent heat by Andrews also ; he refractive indices by Gladstone and Dale .
Nearly all these researches , ind many more which might be enumerated , have been accompanied by measurements of density and boiling-point .
When we pass to the other members of the series we find , however , that in the case of normal propyl alcohol , with the exception of numerous determinations of density and boiling-point , experiments have been limited , as far as I am aware , to the measurement of the expansion by Pierre and Puchot .
( The table of vapour-tensions given in the same paper is erroneous , as I hope to prove in a future communication .
) The same is to be said of all the other alcohols of this series , the rates of expansion of some of which have been examined by Kopp , Lieben and Rossi , Wanklyn and Erlenmeyer , and others .
In order partially to supply this want I have undertaken a series of experiments , of which the following pages are the firstfruits .
I. Density , Expansion , and Vapour-tension of Propyl and Isopropyl Iodides .
The selection of these as my first experiments was prompted by the following considerations:\#151 ; If , as is possible , all the particular physical characteristics of a given substance result from one main characteristic , which is , as it were , the fundamental definition of the substance ( at least from a physical point of view ) , then the various phenomena observed must be dependent one on the other , and the measurement of the vapour-tension , for instance , or of the latent heat , of the given substance must involve implicitly all other measurements , such as those of the specific heat , rate of expansion , \amp ; c. ; that this is not without foundation , is proved by the many partially successful attempts to connect the various results obtained for certain bodies by mathematical reasoning .
A connexion between the vapour-tension and rate of expansion of a liquid organic body is rendered probable by the well-known researches of Hermann Kopp and others .
From a large number of observations conclusions were formed which may be thus summed up:\#151 ; The atoms of the various elements entering into the composition of substances of the same chemical type always occupy the same space when the tension of the vapour of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of mercury 760 millims. in height .
Hence the molecules of isomeric sub- Mr. F. D. Brown on the Physical [ May 3 ' stances which differ only in the arrangement of their constituent atom and not in their number or kind , must , when the tension equals 7G millims. , occupy the same space , or , in other words , the molecular voluim of isomers at their boiling-points are equal .
If this relation exists be tween the molecular volumes of two isomers at those temperatures i which their respective vapour-tensions are equal to 760 millims. , should equally hold good at all those corresponding temperatures atwhic the vapour-tensions are equal to any number n of millimetres , since tt ordinary barometric pressure of 760 millims. is a special circumstanc due to our residence on this planet and to the usual position of oi laboratories at no great altitude .
The study of the vapour-tensions , combined with that of the den sit and rate of expansion , enables us therefore to compare the molecula volumes at all those corresponding temperatures at which the vapoui tensions are equal ; should a uniform equality be apparent , it is evideit that a connexion between vapour-tension and rate of expansion would b established .
For , let A and a be two isomeric liquids , D and d thei respective densities , and H and h their vapour-tensions at any tempera ture t , we have D=f(t ) , d=f'(t ) , H=^(\#163 ; ) , h=\lt ; j)'(t ) ; if we hav observed that whenever H=7\amp ; D=\lt ; 7* , it of course follows that for an two values and t2 such that we shall have also f(ty Since the expressions f(t ) and/ ( \#163 ; ) present no peculiarities in the cast of isomeric substances , it would be reasonable to suppose that in the cast of other liquids there is also a relation between and / ( * ) .
A detailed description of the apparatus employed , together with al the precautions taken to ensure accuracy , must be reserved for the future a brief statement on this head is , however , indispensable .
Thermometers.\#151 ; The two thermometers by which all measurements oi temperature were taken are each about 20 inches long , and are divider on the glass into tenths of a degree ; the scale of the one ( A ) ranges from \#151 ; 7 ' to 53 ' , that of the other ( B ) from 46 ' to 102 ' .
These instruments were most carefully compared with a Kew standard which has long been in the possession of the London Institution .
The bath in which the comparisons were made was 22 inches in height and 12 inches in breadth , and was filled with water which was rapidly and constantly stirred ; the readings were marked on paper divided carefully into squares , and the points united by a curved line ; the corresponding readings of the air thermometer derived from Kegnault 's Tables being also marked , the correction for any subse* Y and v being the respective molecular volumes , and m the common molecular Tth weight , we haveV= \#151 ; and v= - ; consequently when Y=vf D \#151 ; d : we may therefore substitute the equality of the densities for that of the molecular volumes .

The temperature having been read , the clamp E was finally raised , carrying with it the density-tube completely full .
On exposure to the cooler air the liquid in the capillaries quickly recedes , and the tube may be wiped dry and weighed .
This slight modification of the ordinary method enabled me to determine easily the density of a liquid at any temperature above that of the atmosphere , however great might be the rate of expansion .
The tube being completely full , the error which in general arises from the adherence of the liquid to empty portions of density-tubes \amp ; c. is avoided .

Rate of Expansion.\#151 ; Dilatometers , similar to those used by Kopr Pierre , and others , were employed , the necessary data concerning thei being obtained in the usual way , slight modifications excepted .
The ir struments , when filled with the liquid to be examined , were compare with the thermometers A and B , in the large bath mentioned above , i : which they were completely immersed ; readings were taken both when the temperature of the water was rising and when it was falling .
'Whe : both dilatometers were filled with the same liquid , the volumes obtain at any given temperature differed only in the fifth decimal place .
Vapour-tension.\#151 ; The apparatus shown in fig. 2 was used in tb case of the iodides .
The vapour of the liquid boiling in the bulb i condenses in the tube BB and runs back by the small tube c ; any coolin ; of the thermometer by the condensed vapour is thus avoided .
It is ; reservoir of air with a tap T , with which an air-pump is connected , whil the tube E is connected with a pressure-gauge formed of two communi eating columns of mercury .
The thermometer is placed in the tube which is closed at the bottom and contains a little mercury .

This fact is in accordance with the modern dynamical hypotheses on the constitution of matter .
Isopropyl iodide is more unstable than the normal iodide ; its instability may be due to the greater velocity of its molecules ; from this greater velocity would follow a greater mean distance between the molecules .
I may here mention that I have made a very complete series of experiments on the vapour-tension of normal propyl alcohol .
The curve representing these observations intersects that which expresses the tensions of normal propyl iodide , so that whereas at 760 millims. the iodide boils at 102'*5 and the alcohol at 97'*3 , at 370 millims. they boil at the same temperature , viz. 79'-5 , and at 120 millims. the boiling-point of the iodide is only 49'-5 , whilst that of the alcohol is 56 ' .
This fact , which probably arises from the much greater latent heat of propyl alcohol , obviously renders useless all attempts to derive the boiling-points from the constitution of chemical compounds , so long as the boiling-points at the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere alone are taken into account .
