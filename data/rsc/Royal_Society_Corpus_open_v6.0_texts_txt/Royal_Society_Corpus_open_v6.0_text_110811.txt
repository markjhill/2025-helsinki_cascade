" By W. Tate , Esq. Communicated by the Rev. Henry Moseley , M.A. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. This paper , which is wholly analytical , contains an investigation of certain general methods for the summation of algebraic series , which have led the author to the discovery of some curious and elegant propositions relative to factorials and the decomposition of fractions ; and also to a new demonstration of Tavlor 's theorem .
