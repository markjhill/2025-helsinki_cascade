] It has been remarked by MIalus , that the action which the first surface of Iceland spar exercises upon light , is independent of the position of its principal section ; that its reflecting power extends beyond the limits of the polarizing forces of the crystal : and that as light is only polarized by penetrating the surface , the forces which produce extraordinary refraction begin to act only at this limit .
He also remarks , that the angle of incidence at which this spar polarizes light by partial reflection is 560 30 ' ; and that , whatever be the angle comprehended between the plane of incidence and the principal section of the crystal , the ray reflected by the first surface is always polarized in the same manner .
Dr. Brewster 's experiments detailed in this paper lead him to opposite conclusions , and indicate an extension of the polarizing forces beyond the crystals .
He also shows that the force of double refraction and polarization emanates from the surface of bodies , though its intensity depends upon the inclination of the surface to the axis of the crystal ; and that the ordinary or extraordinary image may be extinguished at pleasure in any doubly-refracting crystal , which is thus converted into a singly-refracting crystal ; that the change in the angle of polarization , produced by the interior force , depends on the inclination of the reflecting surface to the axis of the crystal , and upon the azimuthal angle , which the plane of reflection forms with the principal section ; and that the change in the direction of the polarization depends upon the angle which the incident ray forms with the axis of the crystal .
