A Letter written to Dr. John Wallis by Mr. Henry Philips , containing his Observations about the True Time of the Tides .
WOrthy Sir , Being desired by Mr. O. to give in , what informations I could , concerning the Tides , I have made bold to present this Paper to your Consideration ; which though it have little or no relation to your more curious Philosophical Experiments , yet , I hope , will be of very good use for the finding out the True time of the Tides at all times of the Moon , which is ( I conceive ) of as great concernment , as any thing in the Motion of the Tides .
For , this time of the Tides , though it be a very necessary thing to be known , yet is very rudely and slightly reckoned up by most Seamen and Astronomers ; most of them reckoning , as if the Moon being upon such a set point of the Compass ( as the Seaman calls it ) or so many hours past the Meridian(as the Almanack-Makers reckon ) it were High-Tide in such and such a Port at all times of the Moon .
And thus they reckon the Tides every day to differ constantly 48 m. As for instance ; A South-West Moon makes a full Tide at London , that must be understood , that it is High-Tide at London when the Moon is three hours past the Meridian .
Now this is true indeed at the New and Full Moon , but not at other times of the Moon , which few take any notice of : only Mr. Booker had wont to give this Caveat , that about the first and last quarters of the Moon , the Neap-tides did not flow so long as the Spring-tides by one point of the Compass ; but he gives no rule to proportion the difference .
But observing this more narrowly , I find , that at London the Tides fall out at the least two points , that is , one hour and an half sooner , in the Quarters then in the New and Full Moon .
Now this being a very considerable difference of time , which might very well make many Seamen and Passengers to lose their Tides , I set my self to watch this difference of the time of the Tides , and to find out some Rule , how to proportion the time of the Tides between the Spring-tides and the Neap-tides , and I found by many trialls , that the true time of the Tides might be found out to be somewhat shorter and shorter , from the New and Full Moon unto the Quarters ; yet not in an equal manner , neither gradually decreasing from the New and Full Moon until the Quarters ; but rather , that there was some little difference of alteration both at the New and Full Moons , and also at the Quarters ; and that the greatest difference fell out in the midst between them , agreeing very well to a Circular proportion , after this manner : ( See Fig. 5 .
) First , Divide a Circle into 12 Equal parts , or hours , according to the Moons motion or distance from the Sun , from the New Moon to the Full .
Secondly , Let the Diameter of the Circle be divided into 90 parts or min. that is , according to the time of the difference of Tides between the New or Full Moon , and the Quarters ; which is one hour and an half .
Thirdly , Make perpendicular lines cross the Diameter of the Circle , from hour to hour .
Fourthly , Reckon the time of the Moons coming to the South in the circumference of the Circle , and observe the Perpendicular-Line , that falls from that point upon the Diameter ; and the proportional Minutes , cut thereby , will show , how many Hours , or Minutes are to be substracted from the time of Hightides at the New and Full Moon , that so you may have the true time of the Tides that present day .
For Example ; At London , on the day of New and Full Moon , it is High-Tide at London at 3 of the Clock , that is , when the Moon is three hours past the Meridian : and so by the Common Rule , the Moon being about four days old , it will be South about three of the Clock , and it will be High-tide three hours afterwards , that is , at 6 of the Clock .
But now by this Rule , if you count this time of the Moons coming to the South in the Circumference , the perpendicular-line , which comes from 3 to 9 , cuts the Diameter in the half , at 45 min. which shows , that so much is to be abated from the time of High-tide in the New and Full Moons ; So that it is High-tide 45 min. before 6 of the Clock , that is , at 5 .
hours 15 min. and not at 6 of the clock , according to the common-Rule .
The like you may do for any other Port or place , knowing the time of High-water at the New and Full Moon in that place : And you may do it the more readily , if you set down the time of Highwater at the New and Full Moon under the Diameter , as I have done for London , where it is high-tide at III .
of the clock .
So that when the Moon is South at III .
of the clock , the perpendicular cuts the diameter at II .
hours 15 .
m. which added to the time of the Southing makes it V. hours 15 .
m. and so when the Moon is South at IX .
of the clock , by adding 2 h. 15 m. you have the time of highwater , which is XI .
of the clock and 15 m. And thus you may easily make a Table , which by the Southing of the Moon , shall readily tell you the time of High-tide at any time of the Moon , as I have done here for London : To which all other places may be reduced to correspond .

If the difference be not so much between the Neap-tides and Springtides in other places , the Diameter must be divided into fewer parts .
As for the higest Tides to happen two or three days after the full Moon , I have not made much observation of it , and see little reason for it , but the time thereof agrees here with .
And high Spring-tides are not always alike ; this year I have not observed any .
I should be glad to hear , how these rules hold in other places , that so this true time of the Tides may be more punctually known .
