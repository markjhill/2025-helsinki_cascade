" On the existence of Phosphoric Acid in Rocks of igneous origin .
" By George Fownes , Esq. , Ph. D. , Chemical Lecturer in the Middlesex Hospital Medical School .
Communicated by Thomas Graham , Esq. , F.R.S. The author has , by careful analysis , ascertained the presence of phosphoric acid in various rocks of igneous origin .
Those which he examined were principally the following ; namely , 1 .
The fine white porcelain clay of Dartmoor , resulting from the disintegration of the felspar of the granite of that district .
2 .
Dark grey vesicular lava from the Rhine , used at Cologne as a building-stone .
3 .
White trachyte from the Drachenfels , near Bonn .
4 .
Dark red , spongy , scoriaceous lava from Vesuvius .
5 .
Compact , dark green basalt , or toadstone from Cavedale , Derbyshire .
6 .
Dark blackish-green basalt from the neighbourhood of Dudley , termed Rowley-ragg .
7 .
Ancient porphyritic lava , containing numerous crystals of hornblende , from Vesuvius .
8 .
A specimen of tufa , or volcanic mud , also from Vesuvius .
The author infers from his analysis that phosphoric acid is a very usual component part of volcanic rocks , and is a principal source of the remarkable fertility possessed by soils derived from their disintegration .
