The formula ( Abstract .
) E = a + 6S ( 1 ) where E is some magnetic quantity such as the amplitude of tin diurnal oscillation of the needle , a and b constants , and S sunspot frequency ( after Wolf and Wolfer ) , was first applied by Wolf to the mean declination range throughout the year .
In a recent paper* mainly devoted to other subjects , I applied it to the ranges , and the sum of the 24 hourly differences from the mean for the day , in the mean monthly and annual diurnal inequalities of declination , inclination , horizontal force , and vertical force at Kew .
Some analogous results were also given for Wilhelmshaven , Potsdam , and Parc St. Maur .
The present paper is entirely devoted to the connection between sunspot frequency and terrestrial magnetism .
It deals with data from Milan ( 1836\#151 ; 1901 ) , Greenwich ( 1841\#151 ; 96 ) , Pawlowslt and Katharinen-burg ( 1890\#151 ; 1900 ) , Batavia ( 1887\#151 ; 98 ) , and Mauritius ( 1875\#151 ; 90 ) .
It aims at ascertaining wherein the results in my previous paper are peculiar to the station or period ( chiefly 1890\#151 ; 1900 ) dealt with .
It investigates what differences may exist between the sunspot connection on ordinary days and on magnetically quiet days , and what differences arise when one applies ( 1 ) to the mean of the differences between the absolutely highest and lowest daily readings , instead of to the range of the mean diurnal inequality .
It also considers various measures of the magnetically disturbed character of the year , and their relation to sunspot frequency .

I he inquiry into the influence of the period selected on the values of a and b in ( 1 ) is based on the above-mentioned Milan and Greenwich results , due respectively to Signor Eajna and Mr. Ellis .
In both cases , unfortunately , there is a want of strict homogeneity in the earlier data .
The Greenwich data suggest a slight progressive increase in b/ a during the last 60 years in the case both of declination and horizontal force ; but this is not confirmed by the Milan results .
The values , however , obtained from in the case of the declination range at Milan from the two periods 1837\#151 ; 50 and 1854\#151 ; 67 are , the one 28 per cent , below , the other 12 per cent , above the value obtained by Eajna for the period 1836\#151 ; 94 .
In more recent years there is less apparent irregularity in the magnetic and sunspot relation .

The extraordinarily large differencesi between the " all " day and " quiet " day ( Wild 's normal day ) results at 1 awlowsk for vertical force presents itself in every month of the year .
Pawlowsk is a station where magnetic disturbances are particularly prominent , and the vertical force there seems particularly sensitive to them .

Except at Mauritius , the values of b/ a for declination and horizontal force are considerably greater in Table III than in Table I. There seems , in fact , a general tendency for to-increase as we pass from a quantity , such as the range of a diurnal inequality , which is comparatively independent of disturbances , to a quantity such as the mean absolute daily range , which is largely dependent on disturbances .
Formula ( 1 ) becomes , however , less and less strictly applicable , the more disturbed the magnetic quantity to* which it is applied .
When we consider quantities such as the mean of the 12 monthly ranges ( maximum and minimum for the month ) , or the annual range ( maximum and minimum for the year ) , we find large differences between observed values and those calculated from ( 1 ) .
In .
all the stations considered , 1893 , though a year of absolute sunspot-maximum , was much less disturbed than 1892 .
At Pawlowsk and Katharinenburg 1893 might fairly be termed a quiet year , while 1892 ' and 1894 were largely and persistently disturbed .
In the case of ranges from mean diurnal inequalities for the year , the agreement between observed and calculated values is about equally good at Pawlowsk , Katharinenburg , Batavia , and Kew .
In the case of declination , the mean difference between observed and calculated values is about 4 per cent , of the mean value of the range during the period dealt with .
On the whole , the agreement is distinctly less good in the case of vertical force than in the case of declination , inclination or horizontal force .

] T'ie Optical Properties of Vitreous Silica .
201 When extracting data from the earlier of the two papers by Mr. Ellis* dready mentioned , I found that he had there advanced evidence\#151 ; though he seems hardly to have considered it conclusive\#151 ; that the difference between the Greenwich declination and horizontal force ranges in years of many and few sunspots was not the same in different Reasons of the year .
Converted into exact mathematical language , this would imply the variability of b throughout the year .
If I had been aware at the time of Mr. Ellis 's remarks on this point I should have referred to them in my preliminary notef on this subject .
" The Optical Properties of Vitreous Silica .
" By J. W. Gifford and W. A. ShenSTONE , F.E.S. Beceived January 12 \#151 ; Bead March 3 , 1904 .
The properties of vitreous silica suggest that it is not unlikely to play an important part in optical work .
Its composition is definite , that is to say , it is not liable to those minute variations which make it impossible , we believe , to produce with certainty two meltings of glass which exhibit no sensible difference in their optical properties when tested by a first-rate spectrometer .
Hardly any corrosive fumes , except those of fluorine and hydrogen fluoride , attack silica , and it is indifferent to most ordinary solvents .
It is as transparent to ultraviolet radiations as quartz , but is not doubly refracting like that substance .
And though it is a little difficult to prepare vitreous silica in large masses , this difficulty can be surmounted , and the supply of the substance is not limited like that of fluorite .
In shoit , vitreous silica places at our disposal a really standard glass .
The refractive index of the new glass is low , it approaches that of fluoiite .
Its dispersive power is sensibly greater than that of quartz .
The measurements given in this paper were made with a prism having faces 41 mm. high by 32 mm. wide , and angles of 60 approximately .
The mass of silica from which this prism was cut was made under the supervision of one of us in conjunction with .
Mr. H. G. Lacell , to whom our thanks are due .
As it was our object to produce a standard substance for optical work , no care was spared at this stage .
In making the mass of silica the spectroscopic traces of lithium and the traces of sodium which occur in quartz were burnt out as completely as possible in the oxy-gas flame .
The prism itself was built up from many hundreds of fine rods of vitreous silica , prepared specially for this purpose by a process which has been * ' Phil. Trans. , 'for 1880 .
