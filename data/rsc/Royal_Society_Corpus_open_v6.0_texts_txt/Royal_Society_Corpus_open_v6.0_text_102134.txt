An Abstract of a Letter from Dr Pierce of Bath , to one of the S. of the R. S. giving an instance of the effects of the Bath in curing the Palsy , and Barrenness .
AMong the many Diseases these waters have been famous for the cure of , Palsys and Barrenness are two ; an instance of both , in one person , I shall now give you .
A Gentlewoman of about 30 or 32 years of age , having been married about 10 or 12 years , and never with Child , was suddenly seized with a Palsy on the left side ; for which after 8 or 10 months trial of other means , to little purpose , ) she was brought to the Bath , where ( after usual preparations , and some internal means , ) she continued that season , about 6 weeks ; the winter coming on she was forced to desist ; but ( by the advantage she received , ) was encouraged to come very early the next year , and did continue with us the whole summer , and recovered , in great measure , the use ofher arm , and hand , leg , and tongue ; and not only so , but ( in a few weeks , after she returned to her husband , ) conceived with Child , and had ( at about a year and halfs distance between them , ) 5 Children , following .
Since I received your Letter , being at Wells ( where she now lives , ) I went to see her ; she showed me 4 of the Children , lusty and strong and well grown for their age ; the fifth dyed .
She her self hath no return of a Palsy but is infirm , I think consumptive ; she is now about 51 years old .
