Presented by the Observer , Dr. Neumnaer , * The entire series of these interesting observations were kindly suipplied to me by Mr. W. Fairbairn , and are published in ' The Coalfields of Great Britain , ' 2nd edit .

resuilt obtained by Professor Phillips , F.R.S. , at the MonkNvearmouth Colliery .
Since the time above referred to , the proprietor of the IRose Bridge Colliery , Mr. J. Granit tlorris , determined to carry down the shafts from the " Cannel " seam to the c ; Arley " seam of coal , which was knoown to lie more than 200 yards below it ; and consequently in the spring of 1868 preparations were commenced for carrying out this project .
In the incredibly short time of one year and two months the Arley coal was struck , and was founid to be of good thickness and quality .
The total depth reached was 808 yards , and the ultimate temperature in the coal itself was found to be 931P F. The manager of the colliery , Mr. Bryham , sensible of the value of observations on the temperature of the strata at such unusual depths ( this being probably the deepest colliery in the world , certainly in Britain ) , made a series of observations with as much care as the circumstances would admit , and has entrusted them to me for publication .
The mode of taking the observations was as follows:-On a favourable stratum , such as shale , or even coal , having been reached , a bole was drilled with water in the solid strata to a depth of one yard from thze bottom of the pit .
A thermometer was then inserted , the hole having been sealed and made airtight with clay .
At the expiration of half an hotur the thermometer was taken up and the reading noted .
It might possibly be objected that the time allowed ( thirty minutes ) was insufficient for the imbedding of the thermometer , and that the readings are liable to error from this cause .
I feel sure , however , that if any error has ariseni it is inappreciable , and does not in the least invalidate the general result .
In fact I am assured by Mr. Bryham that , from actual testing on several occasions , he found less than this time of thilty miniutes sufficient for the purpose required .
While the temperatures of the strata were being measured , observationls were also carried on _par passu on those of the open pit during the deseent .
These are given in the Table annexed .
By a comparison of the results in the two columns , it will be observed that as the depth increased the differences between the corresponding temperatures in the pit and the strata tended to augment ; in other words , the temperature of the strata was found to augment more rapidly than that of the open pit .
The effects of the high temperature and pressure on the strata at the depth of 242.5 feet are , as I am informed by Mr. Bryham , making themselves felt , and cause an increase in the expense both of labour and timber for props .
This colliery , in fact , will be in a position to put to the test our views and speculations on the effects of high temperature and pressure on mining operations .
Itn order to obtain the average rate of increase of heat , as shown by the experiments at Rose Bridge Colliery , we may assume ( in the absence of direct observation ) the positioni and temperature of the invariable stratum to be 50 feet from the surface and 500 F. , which is probablyv nearly the mean temperature of the place .
With these data , the increase is 1 ?
F. for every 54 57 feet , which approximates to that obtainied by Professor Phillips at Monkwearmouth of I ' F. for about every 60 feet .
If , on the other hand , for the purpose of comparison , we adopt the measurements for the invariable stratum as obtained at Dukenfield , we find the rate of increase to be 10 F. for every 47-2 feet as against 1 ?
F. for every 83-2 feet in the case of Dukenfield itself .
So great a discordance in the results is remarkable , and is not , in my opinion , attributable to inaccuracy of observation in making the experiments .
On the other hand , I may venture to suggest that it is due , at least in some measure , to dissimilarity in the position and inclination of the strata in each case .
These I now proceed to point out .
Position of the Strata at Rose Bridge and Dukenfield Collieries .
Rose Bridge Colliery occupies a positioni in the centre of a gently sloping trough , where the beds are nearly horizontal ; they are terminated both on the west and east by large parallel faults which throw up the strata on either side .
The colliery is placed in what is known as " the deep belt .
" Dukenfield Colliery , on the other hand , is planted upon strata which are highly inclined .
The beds of sandstone , shale , and coal rise and crop out to the eastward at angles varying from 30 ?
to 35 ' .
Now I think we may assume that strata consisting of sanidstones , shales , clays , and coal alternating with each other are capable of conducting heat more rapidly along the planes of bedding , than across them , different kinds of rock having , as Mr. I-hopkins 's experiments slhow , differenit couducting-powers .
If this be so , we have an evident reason for the dissimilar results in the two cases before us .
Assuming a constanit supply of heat from the interior of the earth , it could only escape , in the case of Rose Bridge , across the planes of bedding , meeting in its progress upwards the resistance offered by strata of , in each case , varying conducting-powers .
On the other hand , in the case of Dukenfield the internal heat could travel alonig the steeply inclinied strata themselves , and ultimately escape along the outerop of the beds .
I merely offer this as a suggestion explanatory of the results before us , and may be allowed to add that the strata at oionkwearmouth ( olliery , the thermometrical observations at which correspond so closely with those obtained at Rose Bridge , are also in a positioni not much removed from the horizontal , which is some evidence in corroboration of the views here offered .
