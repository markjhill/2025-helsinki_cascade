" Effect of Floor-Deafening on the Sanitary Condition of Dwelling Houses .
" By Miss Etta Johnstone , University College , Dundee , and Thos .
Carnelley , Professor of Chemistry in the University of Aberdeen .
Communicated by Sir H. Roscoe , F.R.S. Received February 7,1889 .
" Deafening " is the material which is laid upon boards fitted in between the joists of a floor to prevent the passage of sound into the room below .
This material is used largely on the Continent and in many parts of this country , especially in Scotland , and is supposed to consist of a mixture of coarse mortar and smith 's ashes , but in general it appears to be of a much more questionable nature , particularly in the case of low-class houses .
It is also supposed by some builders to prevent the passage of smell ; but houses are known to have been rendered uninhabitable by its presence , the cinders , which form the great bulk of the substance , being more or less contaminated according to the place whence obtained and other attendant circumstances .
With the object therefore of ascertaining whether this material was a serious factor in the pollution and vitiation of the air of dwelling-houses , we undertook the analysis of a number of samples from various classes of houses in Dundee , and the results obtained are recorded in the present paper .
Carnelley , Haldane , and Anderson ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' B. , vol. 178 ( 1887 ) , pp. 61\#151 ; 111 ) have proved that the number of micro-organisms habitually present in the air of a dwelling-house increases with the age of a building .
Indeed , some of the older buildings become perfectly infested with them , as shown not only by the results obtained by the above observers in houses and schools in Dundee , but also by those of Miguel in old and new houses in Paris .
Indeed , this floor-deafening when impui*e would appear to be a remarkably good medium for the propagation of bacteria , other conditions being favourable .
Dr. Emmerich , of Leipzig , some years ago ( ' Zeitschr .
f. Biol. , ' 1882 ) made experiments on the effects of this stuff with regard to the air of rooms , and also analysed numerous samples of pure material , some of which were obtained from new buildings on completion , and some from inhabited houses .
He found that on washing the floors of rooms , shutting them up for some time , and then examining the ah'* there was a great increase of carbonic acid , which must have been due to the putrefaction set up by the moisture on reaching the deafening , as all other known sources of carbonic acid were excluded .
As a result of his investigations , he concluded that " there exist\#174 ; 1889 .
] Effect of Floor-deafening in Dwelling Houses .
347 nowhere in nature , not even in the neighbourhood of human dwellings , a ( natural ) soil so highly contaminated with nitrogenous organic substances and their decomposition products as the deafening material under the floor of dwelling-rooms .
" As some of Emmerich 's results appear to have been called in question , and for the purpose of ascertaining whether a similar state of matters exists in houses in this country , we obtained samples of deafening from dwellings in different parts of Dundee , through the kindness of Mr. Kinnear , of the Sanitary Department .
Some of these were taken from ordinary middle-class houses , others from one- , two- , and three-roomed houses of the poorer class , while two were obtained from houses ( in Pish Street , Dundee ) about 200 years old , and occupied by the poorest class of artisans .
The deafening from the lower class of houses , and especially that from the oldest houses , bad a most disgusting and filthy smell .
All the houses examined , even those of the better class , had been built and occupied more than twelve years .
For analysis the material was passed through a wire sieve of -j^-inch mesh , and the percentage of fine dust and coarse lumps noted .
The fine dust was bottled , and the following substances determined therein by the usual methods:\#151 ; ( 1 .

] Effect of Floor-deafening 350 Miss E. Johnstone and Prof. Those .
Carnelley .
[ Feb. fy The above results show r ( 1 .
) That the quality of the deafening , as indicated by the per .
centag9 of chlorine , nitrogenous organic matter , and combustible matter , runs strictly parallel with the class of house , being by far the worst in the one-roomed houses , and the best in the largest houses .
( 2 .
) That the deafening employed in ordinary middle-class bouses is in almost all cases practically free from nitrogenous organic matter and chlorides , and from any disagreeable smell , so that no objection can be raised to the use of deafening of the quality we have examined in this class of house .
( 3 .
) In the poorer class of houses ( of three rooms and under ) nitrogenous organic matter and chlorides are always present , the percentage being especially high in the older houses , while in many cases the smell is very objectionable .
From this it would appear that the air in such houses may be very seriously polluted by the deafening , and thus give rise to ill-health .
In reference to the above results we may remark : ( 1 .
) That the cinders , which form the bulk of the deafening used in better class houses are probably of good quality , owing to their being obtained from a non-contaminated source , whereas in the poorer class of houses inferior materials ( and possibly ash-pit refuse , \amp ; c. ) will doubtless be made to serve for filling up the deafening space .
( 2 .
) The carpets in the better class of houses are not usually lifted oftener than twice a year , and of course the floors can only be washed at those times , so that the necessary condition of moisture for the growth of micro-organisms is not present to the same extent as in lower-class houses , while at the same time the carpet will act as a partial filter to micro-organisms arising from the deafening material .
In the poorer class of houses , however , everything would seem to favour the contamination of the air from this source .
The floor boards are often plain jointed , and simply laid side by side , so that when the floor is washed the water has every facility for trickling down to the material beneath .
Further , all the household operations of washing , cooking , nursing ) \amp ; c. , have to be carried out in the one or two apartments , and hence the spilling of dirty water , slops , \amp ; c. , on the floor , and percolation into the deafening below will be of pretty frequent occurrence .
Tw rooms are often overcrowded , and consequently the air is moist an warm , so that the increase and multiplication of micro-organisms would seem to be inevitable .
It has been shown ( Carnelley , Haldane , and- Anderson , Trans. , * B. ( 1887 ) , p. 61 ) that in passing from many to two- and on\#174 ; " roomed houses the air becomes more and more impure , especially ^ regard to the number of micro-organisms , whilst the death-ra 1889 .

The results of the present paper show that the sanitary condition of the floordeafening follows a similar order , thus :\#151 ; Dundee .

Though our results are certainly not so marked as those of * .
\#174 ; mrnerich , they show , nevertheless , quite clearly that the eafening material may be and is in the poorer class of houses a source of contamination of the air of dwellings , in that it furnishes a f ?
no and suitable medium for the growth of micro-organisms , and gives off foetid gases from putrefaction , provided the necessary factors , is ur , warmth , and nitrogenous organic matter , are present .
