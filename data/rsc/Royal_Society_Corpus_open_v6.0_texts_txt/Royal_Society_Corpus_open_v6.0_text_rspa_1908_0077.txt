) Although the character of the motion of laciers is now well known , and the velocity of their motion has , in some cases , ) measured , calculations do not appear to have been made of the viscosity of either glacier or crystalline nor do there appear to } ) any published figures from which the viscosity be quite ccul ately ascertained .
It is possible , , by estimating ' certain dimensions , to obtain results , although not strictly accurate , figures of the order of nitude .
The property termed viscosity is here used as defined by tallow candle is much softer a f : but , if the candle and the stick of -wax are laid between supports , the .sealing-wax will , in a few weeks in summer , bend with its own weight , while the candle remains straight .
The candle is , therefore , a soft solid , and the -wax a viscous liquid .
A viscous body considered as one which manent and continuous of form under the action of a stress , however small .
plastic body is which requires a definite and often stress to continuous of form .
For ractical purposes , a bstance which continuous of form under very small stresses and yields at a rate to stress be as IGviou s the viscosity of ] uids , did not then ) them to any concrete case .

The Viscosity of Ice .
of the ice surface , these dirt bands become visible lower down , the dirt bands are seen to stretch across the glacier in great parabolic curves .
The downward movement of a ] acier is due to its weight and viscosity .
In the case of a fluid of small viscosity , such as water , inertia efiects cause the stream to be swifter in some places than can be due to the slope there , and slower at other places .
With a glacier , the viscosity of which is enornlous , the great viscosity enables it to transmit thrust to some considerable distance , and for this reason we get velocities at various points which are not wholly due to the effects of gravity at such points .
The surface of olaciers also causes them to compression in many cases , and this again nplicates the question .
Tyndall measured the rate of flow of a number of glaciers , the slopes of the upper surfaces of which can be approximately obtained .
Their thicknesses , however , can only be estimated .
This I have done by the valleys down which the glaciers move with other valle ) of somewhat similar width and length .
I consider it probable that the slip at the bottom is about per cent. of the surface velocity , so the effective rence of velocity between top and bottom is 75 per cent. of the surface velocity .
The rock dense and hard , the probability of the bolacier frozen to its bed does not seem boreat .
The breadth of the glaciers being much in excess of thei1 thicknesses , and it being probable that the slip is much greater at the sides than at the bottom , the assumption has been in the calculations hat the glaciers are of infinite width .
Table I are given both the calculated iscosities for a nnmbcr and the ures upon which the calculations are based .
These fures will be subjected to criticism and modified ii more accurate inlates of the can be made .
As an instance of the method adopted , the calculation for viscosity of the Great Aletsch glacier is given below : bodily force producing motion , downward component ravity ravity density Xradient dynes per cubic cenbinletle .
By observation , maximum velocity is cm .

ft. In many cases glaciers have in my opinion* frozen to beds , and have dragged along with them , and crumpled and contorted , the rocks over which they have passed .
The shear at the bottom of the Great Aletsch glacier , to nearly tons per square foot , is the near the centre .
This may be greatly exceeded at points where a rock projects above the general surface ; for owing to the very boreat viscosity of the ice , thrust can be transmitted very considerable distances .
Although lacier grains are capal ) of deformed easily by a stress producing shear at angles to the optic axis , yet from the fact that these grains have their axes at all angles , the motion of the glacier must be partly due to some other assisting cause .
This I have is the liquefaction and regelation which takes place when molecules pass from crystal to crystal .
An ice crystal may evaporate more freely on one face than another , thus cansin a permanent and continuous ansfer of molecules from crystal to crystal .

Tn the case of the Great Aletsch the 1rity of the slope and the great of the ice stream seem to show is no rock of any depth below the strenm , the value of the viscosity obtained for it is robably the most reliable .

towards the end , and a mean of the three viscosities obtained for this glacier may be considered to be fairly free from error .
Table I.\mdash ; Viscosity of Glacier Ice .
A viscosity of appears to be as near an estimate as can yet be made of the effective viscosity of a Swiss glacier .
In winter the viscosity is probably double this figure to the lower temperature .
J. C. McConnel* appears to have been the first to observe the exact conditions under which ice is capable of being deformed without fracture by stress .
He showed that a crystal of ice can be sheared by very small stresses in a direction at right angles to the optic axis , and that the rate of shear becomes reater as the stress is increased .
His two main conclusions are ( 1 ) that the friction between the particles of ice along the shear planes becomes greater as the temperature falls , ( 2 ) that when the molecules of ice slide over each other the cube of the friction varies as the square of the velocity .
It must be remembered that McConnel died before his paper was quite finished , and that , therefore , his calculations were not completed , nor was his paper subjected to final correction .
It will , consequently , not be out of place to reconsider his experimental results in detail .
In Table II , I have set out a number of the experimental esults he 'Roy .

Although in one place only he states the distance between the supports of the ice bars , it is clear that the distance was 51 mm. the used a solid iron frame placed in a small box to keep the temperature from varying rapidly , and to check evaporation .
In no case is the full length of the ice bar given ; this I have assumed to be 60 mm. He states that during the eriments the bars lost by tion , and as he ives the rate of evaporation , I have calculated the size of the bar at each reading of deflection .

assumed that the is as shown by the full lines .
This assumption much simplifies the calculations , and does not appear to me to introduce any serious error .
When , as shown in fig. 2 , a mass of a viscous substance is distorted by the application of a stress to the plane , and the plane is fixed , the distortion is as shown by the dottedlines , and the stress at all planes between and parallel to the planes XX and is the same .
Now , according to fig. 1 , the ice bar is distorted by shear in exactly the same way , and I have regar the weight on the centre of the bar as a stress parallel and coincident with the upper and lower faces of the bar .

[ May 18 , On Diagl.a I these viscosities are plotted , and tJainst each plotting is marked the shearing stress ( in dynes per square timeGre ) to which the ice was subjected .
The equation to the curve on the is so is parabolic , where is the viscosity in dynes per square centimetre and is the temperature below zero ( considered positive ) .
It will be lolice that out of tests , one of is stated by McConnel to be inaccurate , and two of which also appear unreliable , leaving 2 presumably accurate esults , 14 , or more than half , ve results within units with the .
The want of exact eement w the curve seemb to be mainly due to the varying temperatures experienced during the continuance of expcriments .

the weight had produced .
Many , if not all , soft solids do this .
The recovery was very slow , and almost ceased after a time .
It will be seen , on referring to Diagram I , that the experiments made with the small stresses ooive , in some slight degree , the ) reatest viscosities , but this is not true to anything like the extent McConnel thought .
In this connection he states that when the is changed the alteration in the rate of depression is great out of all proportion , , the alteration in the rate of bendin from to when the weight is changed from to kilos .
In this case , however , there was a change of temperature from C. to , and , as will be seen from the diagram , the change of temperature will account for almost the whole of the change of viscosity .
He should have compared the case in which the temperature was with the one in which it was C. , and he would have found that , with stress .
in the proportion of 1 to 9 , the rate of shear was very nearly proportional to the stress .
found that continuous shear could not be produced in some samples of when very lightly stressed .
It be that the small departure from the rate of shear being proportional to the stress , when the stress is small , is to some extent due to want of ularity in the structure of the ice tested , and may also be in some measure connected with the property ice possesses of slightly recovering its original form after distortion .
There some uncertainty as to the actual behaviour of other viscous substances under stress , I made some experiments a bar of pitch .
It was shaped by heating and pressing into a bar mm. long and 14 mm. square , and placed upon supports 117 mm. apart .
The load at the centre of the bar was , partly due to the weight of the bar itself and the finger used to indicate the .
After the application of the weight , the was allowed to bend until the reached the scale .
The readings then taken are given in Table III .
At 12.19 a veight of grammes was removed from the centre of the ) , which was then stressed only by the upon it and its own .
After the lemoval of the weight , readings were taken for a time every seconds .
On Diagram II some of the taken before and after the was removed are plotted .
The shows that was an elastic unbending of the bar , follol ed a further , which ceased in about 4 minutes .
The bar then again ) to yield viscously under its own weight .
From this it } concluded that a viscous substance under stress requires time after a change in the nitude of the stress been made for the rate of shear to ) ecome proportional to the altered stress .

Vortices Liquid .
which can be produced in an ice-crystal at right angles to the optic axis very closely obeys the laws of viscous flow .
If this view should ) sustained , it is not only true , as Professor H. A. Miers shows , that a liquid of low viscosity may have a crystalline structure , but also that , as in the case of crystalline ice , a solid may be liquid along one plane only .
the equation to the curve on Diagram I , the viscosity of an icecrystal in a direction at right angles to the optic axis is about 2 at the freezing point .
At this temperature the viscosity of a glacier is about , or 6250 times as great .
The effective viscosity of a glacier is therefore due in a great measure to some other consideration .
The optic axes of glacier grains are at all angles and they lock each other .
I am much indebted to Mr. P. H. Parr for the assistance he has rendered in calculating the results from the Vortices / Liquid .

) In a paper\ldquo ; on the Circulation of Air observed in Kundt 's Tubes , and on some Allied Acoustical Problems *I applied the equations of viscous incompressible fluid to show that the effect of the bottom of the vessel was to generate permanent vortices in the vibrating fluid .
It was remarkable that the intensity of the vortical motion , when fully established , proved to be independent of the magnitude of the viscosity , so that the effects could not be eliminated by merely supposing the viscosity to become extremely small .
The expression found for the vortices was simple .
The horizontal component of the primary motion near the bottom being , the component yelocities of the vortical motion are , being measured ) wards from bottom , and the velocity of propagation of waves of the length in question .
