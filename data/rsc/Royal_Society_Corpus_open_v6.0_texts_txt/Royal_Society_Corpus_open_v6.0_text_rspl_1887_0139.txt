The Presents received were laid on the table , and thanks ordered for them .
The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " Notes on the Spectrum of the Aurora .
" By J. Norman Lockyer , h .R.S .
Received January 9 , 1888 .
I exhibited to the Society on November 17,1887 , a tabular statement s owing the bright lines seen in the spectra of various celestial bodies , and I also gave those recorded in the spectrum of the Aurora showing many remarkable coincidences .
I now find that the connexion is closest between the auroral spectrum and that of stars 3a , and in anticipation of a subsequent communication of details I send on the accompanying table , showing the origin of Duner 's bands , so far as I have at present made them out , and their connexion with the spectrum in question .
The individual observations which I have used in the table are those collected by Mr. Capron and Mr. Backhouse ( ' Nature , ' vol 7 pages 182 , 463 ) .

" On the Secondary Carpals , Metacarpals , and Digital Rays in the Wings of existing Carinate Birds .
" By W. K. Parker , F.R.S. Received January 11 , 1888 .
In a paper On the Morphology of Birds , " already sent in to the Royal Society , but not yet published , I have described certain additional parts in the wings of Gallinaceous birds .
One of these lies on the radial side of the first metacarpal ; the other two are on the ulnar side of the second and third metacarpals .
These parts , which at first caused me considerable surprise , being wholly unexpected by me , are only part of what I have since found in other families .
During the past year I have worked out the development of the skeleton in the Duck tribe ( " Anatidae " ) , in the Auk tribe ( " Alcidue " ) , and in the Gull tribe ( a Daridse " ) , and to some degree in some other families .
The subject appears to me to be of great interest , and I have , through various English and American friends , obtained many scores of embryos and young birds , \amp ; c. , that I may be able to trace * This line is seen as a pretty bright line in the spectrum of the Limerick meteorite , but its origin has not yet been determined , although comparisons have been made with most of the common elements .
So far , it has not been observed in any other meteorite .
