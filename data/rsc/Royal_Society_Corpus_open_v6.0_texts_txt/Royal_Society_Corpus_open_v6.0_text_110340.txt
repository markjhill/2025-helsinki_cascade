A paper was read , entitled , " Magnetical Experiments , made prin ?
cipally in the South of Europe and Asia Minor , during the years 1827 and 1832 .
" By the Rev. George Fisher , M.A. F.R.S. This paper is divided into five sections .
The first gives an account of a series of experiments made with a view to determine the relative intensities of the forces soliciting a horizontal magnetic needle , and also the forces in the direction of the dipping needle , at London , Lisbon , and Gibraltarpremising a minute description of the apparatus employed , and a circumstantial statement of the methods used for conducting the investigation .
The second section gives the details and results of similar experiments made at London , Malta , Syracuse , Catania , Messina , Naples , Baia , Constantinople , Egina , and Athens $ and also on the plain of Troy , and at Vourla in Asia Minor .
The third section contains an account of experiments on the diur ?
nal variation in the intensity of the magnetic force soliciting a hori ?
zontal needle in the island of Malta .
In the fourth section , experiments are related on the diurnal va ?
riation of the magnetic needle suspended horizontally at Malta .
The fifth section is occupied by an account of the results of similar experiments made on the bases and edges of the craters of Vesuvius and JEtno . ?
, and also on Gibraltar rock , and the neutral ground below : from which it appears , that the forces soliciting both the horizontal needle and that in the position of the dip , were considerably greater on the elevated than on the lower situations .
From the whole of the observations made in different parts of the Mediterranean , and contained in this paper , it appears that great irregularity exists in the numerical results 5 but whether these arise from irregularities in the distribution of the terrestrial magnetism , or from any active agency of a volcanic nature , or other cause , the author does not venture to decide .
