In the first machines constructed by Siemens and Wheatstone in 186 \lt ; ( see Royal Society 's Transactions ) the power of augmenting the magnetism by successive currents , developed from the original residua , magnetism contained in the iron , was fully demonstrated , and it was shown that the power of the machine could thereby be developed to s great extent ; but the only means for obtaining external work was by the insertion in the circuit of a magnet or coil so that the secondary discharge could be utilized .
Sir Charles Wheatstone also showed thaf a great part of the current could be shunted through a platinum wire , care being taken that the resistance of the platinum wire wras sufficient to compel a large part of the current to pass round the electromagnet .
In the same year the writer designed a machine which was made by Mr. Lad , and described by him in a paper read before this Society ( see Transactions ) , the principle of which was that two separate armatures
