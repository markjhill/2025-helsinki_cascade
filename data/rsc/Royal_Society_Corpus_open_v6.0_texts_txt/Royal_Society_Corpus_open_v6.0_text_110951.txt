" Researches on Physical Geology."--Part I. The Figure and Primitive Formation of the Earth .
By Henry Hennessy , Esq. Communicated by Major North Ludlow Beamish , K.H. , F.R.S. The author 's investigations of the figure of the earth proceed on the hypothesis of its having originally been a heterogeneous fluid mass , possessing only such general properties as those which have been established for fluids ; and independently of the supposition , with which the theory has generally been complicated , that the volume of the entire mass , and the law of the density of the fluid , have suffered no change in consequence of the solidification of a part of that fluid .
Assuming the figure of the mass to be an ellipsoid of revolution , the author obtains general analytical expressions for its ellipticity , and for the variation of gravity at its surface .
He gives a general sketch of the consequences that may result from the improved hypothesis of the primitive figure of the earth , to physical geology , that is , to the changes occurring upon the external crust of the earth during the process of its solidification , resulting both from calorific and chemical changes taking place among its different parts , and giving rise to a process of circulation throughout the fluid portions of the mass .
The present memoir is only the first of a series which the author announces it is his intention to communicate to the Society on the same subject .
