On the influence of the Respiratory Organs in regulating the Quantity of Blood within the Heart .
" By James Wardrop , Esq. Communicated by the Hon. Captain De Roos , R.N. , F.R.S. The author observes that the act of inspiration tends not only to favour the passage of the blood into the vense cavse , but also to detain it in the pulmonary vessels , ?
in consequence of the expansion of the lungs allowing of its more ready ingress into the pulmonary arteries , and impeding its exit by the veins ?
and thus retards its return to the heart .
On the other hand , the collapse both of the lungs and of the parietes of the chest , during expiration , assists the transmission of arterial blood from the lungs into the left cavities of the heart , and promotes its passage into the aorta .
Thus he considers inspiration as an auxiliary to the venous , and expiration to the arterial , circula ?
tion ; the first acting like a sucking , and the latter like a forcing pump , in aiding the power of the heart .
On this principle he explains the influence exerted on the circulation and on the action of the heart by various modes of respiration , whether voluntary or involuntary , in different circumstances .
Laughter , crying , weeping , sobbing and sighing , &amp; c , he considers as efforts made with a view to effect certain alterations in the quantity of blood in the lungs and heart , when the circulation has been disturbed by mental emotions .
