" How charming is divine philosophy !
Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose , But musical as is Apollo 's lute , And a perpetual feast of nectar 'd sweets , Where no crude surfeit reigns !
" -CoMUs .
IN the first section of the ensuing memoir , which is divided into five sections , I consider the nature and properties of the residues which result from the ordinary process of successive division ( such as is employed for the purpose of finding the greatest common measure ) applied tof(x ) and p(x ) , two perfectly independent rational integral functions of x. Every such residue , as will be evident from considering the mode in which it arises , is a syzygetic function of the two given functions ; that is to say , each of the given functions being multiplied by an appropriate other function of a given degree in x , the sum of the two products will express a corresponding residue .
These multipliers , in fact , are the numerators and denominators to the successive convergents to ] expressed under the form of a continued fraction .
If now we proceed &amp; priori by means of the given conditions as to the degree in ( x ) of the multipliers and of any residue , to determine such residue , we find , as shown in art .
( 2 .
) , that there are as many homogeneous equations to be solved as there are constants to be determined ; accordingly , with the exception of one arbitrary factor which enters into the solution , the problem is definite ; and if it be further agreed that the quantities entering into the solution shall be of the lowest possible dimensions in respect of the coefficients of f and p , and also of the lowest numerical denomination , then the problem ( save as to the algebraical sign of plus or minus ) becomes absolutely determinate , and we can assign the numbers of the dimensions for the respective residues and syzygetic multipliers .
The residues given by the method of successive division are easily seen not i to be of these lowest dimensions ; accordingly there must enter into each of them a certain unnecessary factor , which , however , as it cannot be properly called irrelevant , I distinguish by the name of the Allotrious Factor .
The successive residues , when divested of these allotrious factors , I term the Simplified Residues , and in article ( 3 .
) and ( 4 .
) 1 express the allotrious factors of each residue in terms of the leading coefficients of the preceding simplified residues off and p. In article ( 5 .
) I proceed to deternmine by a direct method these simplified residues in terms of the coefficients of f and p. Beginning with the case wheref and p are of the same dimensions ( m ) in x , I observe that we may deduce from f and pm linearly independent functions of x each of the degree ( mI ) in x , all of them syzygetic functions off and p ( vanishing when these two simultaneously vanish ) , and with coefficients which are made up of terms , each of which is the product of one coefficient off and one coefficient of @ .
'rhese , in fact , are the very same ( m ) functions as are employed in the method which goes by the name of BEZOUT'S abridged method to obtain the resultant to ( i. e. the result of the elimination of x performed upon)f and p. As these derived functions are of firequent occurrence , I find it necessary to give them a name , and I term them the ( m ) Bezoutics or Bezoutian Primaries ; from these ( m ) primaries m Bezoutian secondaries may be deduced by eliminating linearly between them in the order in which they are generated , -first , the highest power of x between two , then the two highest powers of x between three , and finally , all the powers of x between them all : along with the system thus formed it is necessary to include the first Bezoutian primary , and to consider it accordingly as being also the first Bezoutian secondary ; the last Bezoutian secondary is a constant identical with the Resultant off and p. When the m times mn coefficients of the Bezoutian primaries are conceived as separated from the powers of x and arranged in a square , I term such square the Bezoutic square .
This square , as shown in art .
( 7 .
) , is symmetrical above one of its diagonals , and corresponds therefore ( as every symmetrical matrix must do ) to a homogeneous quadratic function of ( m ) variables of which it expresses the determinant .
This quadratic function , which plays a great part in the last section and in the theory of real roots , I term the Bezoutiant ; it may be regarded as a species of generating function .
Returning to the Bezoutic system , I prove that the Bezoutian secondaries are identical in form with the successive simplified residues .
In art .
( 6 .
) I extend these results to the case off and p being of different dimensions in x. In art .
( 7 .
) I give a mechanical rule for the construction of the Bezoutic square .
In art .
( 8 .
) I show how the theory of f(x ) and p(x ) , where the latter is of an inferior degree to f , may be brought under the operation of the rule applicable to two functions of the same degree at the expense of the introduction of a known and very simple factor , which in fact will be a constant power of the leading coefficient inf(x ) .
In art .
( 9 .
) I give another method of obtaining directly the simplified residues in all cases .
In art .
( 10 .
) I present the process of successive division under its most general aspect .
In arts .
( 11 .
) and ( 12 .
) I demonstrate the identity of the algebraical sign of the Bezoutian secondaries with 408 that of the simplified residues , generated by a process corresponding to the development of r under the form of an improper continued fraction ( where the negative fX sign takes the place of the positive sign which connects the several terms of an ordinary continual function ) .
As the simplified residue is obtained by driving out an allotrious factor , the signs of the former will of course be governed by the signs accorded by previous convention to the latter ; the convention made is , that the allotrious factors shall be taken with a sign which renders them always essentially positive when the coefficients of the given functions are real .
I close the section with remarking the relation of the syzygetic factors and the residues to the convergents of the continued fraction which expresses f , and of the continued fraction which is formed by reversing the order of the quotients in the first named fraction .
In the second section I proceed to express the residues and syzygetic multipliers in terms of the roots and factors of the given functions ; the method becoming as it may be said endoscopic instead of being exoscopic* , as in the first section .
I begin in arts .
( 14 .
) and ( 15 .
) with obtaining in this way , under the form of a sum or double sum of terms involving factors and roots of f and p , and certain arbitrary functions of the roots in each term , a general representative , or to speak more precisely , a group of general representatives for a conjunctive of any given degree in x tofand p , i. e. a rational integral function of x , which is the sum of the products of f and p multiplied respectively by rational integral functions of x , so as to vanish of necessity when f and p simultaneously vanish .
This variety of representatives refers not merely to the appearance of arbitrary functions , but to an essential and precedent difference of representation quite irrespective of such arbitrariness .
In articles ( 16 .
) , ( 17 .
) , ( 18 .
) , ( 19 .
) , ( 20 .
) , ( 21 .
) , I show how the arbitrary form of function entering into the several terms of any one ( at pleasure ) of the formulae that represent a conjunctive of any given degree may be assigned , so as to make such conjunctive identical in form with a simplified residue of the same degree .
The form of arbitrary function so assigned , it may be noticed , is a fractional function of the roots , so that the expression becomes a sum or double sum of fiactions .
I first prove in arts .
( 16 .
) , ( 17 .
) that such sum is essentially integral , and I determine the weight of its leading coefficient in respect of the roots off and p ( this weight being measured CONJUGArE by the number of roots off and p conjointly , which appear in any term of such coefficient ) .
Now in the succeeding articles I revert to the Bezoutic system of the first section , and beginning with the supposition of m and n being equal , I demonstrate that the most general form of a conjunctive of any degree in x will be a linear function of the Bezoutics , from which it is easy to deduce that the simplified residues of any given degree in x are the conjunctives whose weight in respect of the roots is a minimum ; so that all conjunctives having that weight must be identical ( to a numerical factor pres ) , and any integral form of less weight apparently representing a conjunctive must be nugatory , every term vanishing identically .
These results are then extended to the case of two functions of unlike degrees .
The conclusion is , that the weight of the forms assumed in ( 16 .
) and ( 17 .
) being equal to the minimum weight , they must ( unless they were to vanish , which is easily disproved ) represent the simplified residues , or which is the same thing , the Bezoutian secondaries .
We thus obtain for each simplified residue a number of essentially distinct forms of representation , but all of which must be identical to a numerical factor prAs , a result which leads to remarkable algebraical theorems .
The number of these different formulae depends upon the degree of the residue ; there being only one for the last or constant residue , two for the last but one , three for the last but two , and so on .
The formulae continue to have a meaning when their degree in x exceeds that off or p ; but then , as although always representing conjunctives , they no longer represent residues , this identity no longer continues to subsist .
In articles ( 22 .
) , ( 23 .
) , ( 24 .
) , ( 25 .
) , I enter into some developments connected with the general formulae in question : these , it may be observed , are all expressed by means of fractions containing in the numerator and denominator products of differences ; the differences in the numerator products being taken between groups of roots of f and groups of roots of p ; and in the denominator between roots off inter se and roots of p inter se .
A great enlargement is thus opened out to the ordinary theory of partial fractions .
In art .
( 26 .
) I find the numerical ratios between the different formulae which represent ( to a numerical factor pros ) the same simplified residue , and in arts .
( 27 .
) and ( 28 .
) I determine the relations of algebraical sign of these formulae to the simplified residues or Bezoutian secondaries .
In art .
( 29 .
) I determine the syzygetic multipliers corresponding to any given residue in terms of the factors and roots of the given functions ; but the expressions for these , which are closely analogous to those for the residues , cease to be polymorphic .
They are obtained separately from the syzygetic equation , and it is worthy of notice , that to obtain the one we use the first of the polylnorphic expressions for the residue , and to obtain the other the opposite extremity of the polymorphic scale .
In the subsequent articles of this section , by aid of certain general properties of continued fractions , I establish a theorem of reciprocity between the series of residues and either series of syzygetic multipliers .
410 Section III .
is devoted to a determination of the values of the preceding formulae for the residues and multipliers in the case applicable to M. STURM'S theorem , where j(x ) becomes the differential derivative offx .
It becomes of importance to express the formulae for this case in terms of their roots and factors offx alone , without the use of the roots and factors of f'x , which will of course be functions of the former .
By selecting a proper form out of the polyttorphic scale , the fr actional terms of the series for each residue in this case become separately integral , and we obtain my wellknown formulae for the simplified residues ( STURM'S reduced auxiliary functions ) in temrs of the factors and the squared differences of partial groups of roots .
This is shown in art .
( 35 .
) .
In art .
( 36 .
) the multiplier offx in the syzygetic equation is expressed by formulet of equal sitnplicity , and in a certain sense complementary to the former .
This method , however , does not apply to obtaining expressions for the multiplier of fx in the same equation in terms of the roots and factors offx ; for the separate fractions whose sum represents any one of these factors it will be found do not admit of being expressed as integral functions of the roots and factors .
To obviate this difficulty I look to the syzygetic equation itself , which contains five quantities , viz. the given function , its first differential derivative , the residue of a given degree , and the two multipliers , all of which , except the multiplier of fx , are known , or have been previously determined as rational integral functions of the roots and factors of fx .
I use this equation itself for determining the fifth quantity , the multiplier in question .
To perform the general operations by a direct method required for this would be impossible ; the difficulty is got over by finding , by meatis of the syzygetic equation , the particular form that the result must assume when certain relations of equality spring up between the r'oots of fx ; and then , by aid of these particular determinations , the general form is demonstratively inferred .
This investigation extends over arts .
( 38 .
) , ( 39 .
) , ( 40 .
) , ( 41 .
) , ( 42 .
) , ( 43 .
) .
It turns out that the expressions for the multipliers offx are of much greater complexity than for the multipliers off'x or for the residues .
Any such multiplier consists of a sum of parts , each of which , as in the case of the residues and of the factors of f'x , is affected with a factor consisting of the squared differences of a group of roots ; but the other factor , instead of being simply ( as for the residues and factors before mentioned ) a product of certain factors of f : , consists of the sumi of a series of products of sumns of powers by products of combinations of factors of fx , each of which series is affected with the curious anomaly of its last term , becotning augmented in a certain numerical ratio beyond what it should be , in order to be conformable to the regular flow of the preceding terms in the series* .
The fourth section opens with the establishment of two propositions concerning quadratic functions which are made use of in the sequel .
Art .
( 28 .
) contains the proof of a law which , although of extreme simplicity , I do not remember to have seen , and with which I have not found that analysts are familiar : I mean the law of the constancy of signs ( as regards the number of positive and negative signs ) in any sum of positive and negative squares into which a given quadratic function admits of being transformed by substituting for the variables linear functions of the variables with real coefficients .
This constant number of positive signs which attaches to a quadratic function under all its transformations , and which is a transcendental function of the coefficients invariable for real substitutions , may be termed conveniently its inertia , until a better word be found .
This inertia it is shown in art .
( 26 .
) , by aid of a theorem identical with one formerly given by M. CAUCHY , is measured by the number of combinations of sign in the series of determinants of which the first is the complete determinant of the function ; the second , the determinant when one variable is made zero ; the next , the determinant when another variable as well as the first is made zero , and so on , until all the variables are exhausted , and the determinant becomes positive unity .
In art .
( 46 .
) I give some curious and interesting expressions for the residues and syzygetic multipliers , under the form of determinants communicated to me by M. HERRMITE ; and in art .
( 47 .
) I show how , by aid of the generating function which M. HERMIT employs , and of the law of inertia stated at the opening of the section , an instantaneous demonstration may be given of the applicability of my formulae for M. STURM'S functions for discovering the number of real roots offx , without any reference to the rule of common measure .
; and moreover , that these formulae may be indefinitely varied , and give the generating function , out of which they may be evolved in its most general form .
Had the law of inertia been familiar to mathematicians , this constructive and instantaneous method of finding formulae for determining the number of real roots within prescribed limits would , in all probability , have been discovered long ago , as an obvious consequence of such law .
I then proceed in arts .
( 48 .
) and ( 49 .
) , to inquire as to the nature of the indications afforded by the successive simplified residues to two general functions f and , ; and I find that the succession of signs of these residues serves to determine the number of roots off or p , comprised between given limits after all pairls of roots of either function , contained within the given limits , not separated by roots of the other function , have been removed , and the operation , if necessary , repeated toties quoties until no two roots of either function are left unseparated by roots of the other ; or in other words , until every root finally r etained in one function is followed by a root of the other , or else by one of the assigned limits .
The system of roots comprised between given limits thus reduced I call the effective scale of intercalations ; such a scale may begin with a root of the numerator or of the denominator of , ; and upon this and the relative magnitudes of the greatest root of px and fx it will depend whether in the series of residues ( among which fx and px are for this purpose to be counted ) 412 changes will be lost or gained as x passes from positive infinity to negative infinity .
In art .
( 50 .
) I observe that the theory of real roots of a single function given by M. STURM'S theorem is a corollary to this theory of the intercalations of real roots of two functions , depending upon the well-known law , that odd groups of the limiting function fx lie between every two consecutive real roots of fx .
In art .
( 51 .
) I verify the law of reciprocity , already stated to exist between the residues of fx and px , by an h posteriori method founded on the theory of intercalations .
In arts .
( 52 .
) , ( 53 .
) , ( 54 .
) , 1 obtain a remarkable rule , founded upon the process of common measure , for finding a superior and inferior limit in an infinite variety of ways to the roots of any given function .
This method stands in a singular relation of contrast to those previously known .
All previous methods ( including those derived through NEWTON'S Rule ) proceed upon the idea of treating the function whose roots are to be limited as made up of the sum of parts , each of which retains a constant sign for all values of the variable external to the quantities which are to be shown to limit the roots .
My method , on the other hand , proceeds upon the idea of treating the function as the product of factors retaining a constant sign for such values of the variable .
In art .
( 55 .
) , the concluding article of the fourth section , I point out a conceivable mode in which the theory of intercalations may be extended to systems of three or more functions .
In Section V. arts .
( 56 .
) , ( 57 .
) , I show how the total number of effective intercalations between the roots of two functions of the same degree is given by the inertia of that quadratic form which we agreed to term the Bezoutiant to f and &lt; ; and in the following article ( 58 .
) the result is extended to embrace the case contemplated in M. STURM'S theorem ; that is to say , I show , that on replacing the function of x by a homogeneous function of x and y , the Bezoutiant to the two functions , which are respectively the differential derivatives off with respect to x and with respect , will ser to will serveto deteraine by its form or inertia the total number of real roots and of equal roots inf ( x ) .
The subject is pursued in the following arts .
( 59 .
) , ( 60 .
) .
The concluding portion of this section is devoted to a consideration of the properties of the Bezoutiant under a purely morphological point of view ; for this purposef and p are treated as homogeneous functions of two variables x , y , instead of being regarded as functions of x alone .
In arts .
( 61 .
) , ( 62 .
) , ( it is pioved that the Bezoutiant is an invariantive function of the functions from which it is derived ; nud in art .
( 64 .
) the important remark is added , that it is an invariant of that particular class to which I have given the name of Combinants , which have the property of remaining unaltered , not only for linear transformations of the variables , but also for linear combinations of the functions containing the variables , possessing thus a character of double invariability .
In arts .
( 65 .
) , ( 66 .
) , I consider the ielation of the Bezoutiant to the differential determinant , so called byJACOBi , but which for greater brevity I call the Jacobian .
On proper substitutions being made in the Bezoutiant of the ( m ) variables which it contains ( m being the degree in x , y of f and p ) , the Bezoutiant becomes identical with the Jacobian to f and p ; but as it is afterwards 413 shown , this is not a property peculiar to the Bezoutiant ; in fact there exists a whole family of quadratic forms of m variables , lineo-linear ( like the Bezoutiant ) in respect of the coefficients inf and p , all of which enjoy the same property .
The number of individuals of such family must evidently be infinite , because any linear combination of any two of them must possess a similar property ; I have discovered , however , that the number of independent forms of this kind is limited , being equal to the number of odd integers not greater than the degree of the two functions f and p. In arts .
( 67 .
) and ( 68 .
) , I give the means of constructing the scale of forms , which I term the constituent or fundamental scale , of which all others of the kind are merely numericolinear combinations .
This scale does not directly include the Bezoutiant within it , and it becomes an object of interest to determine the numbers which connect the Bezoutiant with the fundamental forms ; this calculation I have carried on ( in arts .
( 69 .
) , ( 70 .
) , ( 71 .
) ) from m=1to m=6 inclusive , and added an easy method of continuing indefinitely .
In this method the numbers in the linear equation corresponding to any value of m are determined successively , and each made subject to a verification before the next is determined , there being always pairs of equation.s which ought to bring out the same result for each coefficient .
In the next and concluding art .
( 72 .
) , I remark upon the different directions in which a generalization may be sought of the subject-matter of the ideas involved in M. STURM'S : theorem , and of which the most promising is , in my opinion , that which leads through the theory of intercalations .
Some of the theorems given by me in this paper have been enunciated by me many years ago , but the demonstrations have not been published , nor have they ever before been put together and embodied in that compact and organic order in which they are arranged in this memoir , the fiuit of much thought and patient toil , which I have now the honour of presenting to the Royal Society .

In a supplemental part to the third section I have given expressions in terms of the roots of px and fx for the quotients which arise in developing C under the form of a continued fraction , and some remarkable properties concerning these quotients .
In a supplemental part to the fourth section I have given an extended theory of my new method offinding limits to the real roots of any algebraical equation .
This method , so extended , possesses a marked feature of distinction from all preceding methods used for the same purpose , inasmuch as it admits in every case of the limits being brought up into actual coincidence with the extreme roots , whereas in other methods a wide and arbitrary interval is in general necessarily left between the roots and the limits .
414 On the complete and simpljfied residues generated in the process of developing under the form of a continuedfraction , an ordinary rational algebraicalfraction .
Art , ( 1 .
) .
Let P and Q be two rational integral functions of x , and suppose that the process of continued successive division leads to the equations P -MoQ +R1=O0 Q -M1R1+R2=O RI M2R2+R3=0. .
so that PM0-M1M2 &amp; c ( 2 .
) which is what I propose to call an improper continued fraction , differing from a proper only in the circumstance of the successive terms being connected by negative instead of positive signs .
Mo M1 , M2 , &amp;c. , R1 , R2 , R , , &amp;c. are , of course , functions of x : the latter we may agree to call the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , &amp;c. residues ( in order to avoid the use of the longer term " residues with the signs changed " ) ; and by way of distinction from what they become when certain factors are rejected , we may call R1 , R2 , R , , &amp;c. the complete residues .
Each such complete residue will in general be of the form NJ .
, N , and D , being integral functions of the coefficients only of P and Q , but g , an integral function of these coefficients , and of x : p , may then be termed the &lt; th simplified N , residue , and the th allotrious factor .
Suppose P to be of m and Q of n dimensions in x , and m-n=e , the process of continued division may be so conducted , that all the residues may contain only integer powers of x ; and we may upon this supposition make Mo of e dimensions , and MI , MS , M , , &amp;c. each of one dimension only in x ; so that R1 , R2 , R3 , ... .
will be respectively of ( n1 ) , ( n-2 ) , ( n-3 ) , &amp;c. dimensions in x. P and Q are supposed to be perfectly unrelated , and each the most general function that can be formed of the same degree .
From ( 1 .
) we obtain R , =M -o.Q-P R , =M , R , -Q =(MoM , )Q-M .
P ... .
( 3 , ) R3=(MOMMM2+Mo+M2)Q-(M1M21)P &amp;c. = &amp;c. x EXPANDED and in general we shall have R , =Q,.Q+P,.P , ... ... . .
( 4 .
) where it is evident that Q , will be of e+(l1 ) , and P , of ( s-l ) dimensions in x. Art .
( 2 .
) Hence it follows that the ratios P : Q , : R , may be ascertained by the direct application of the method of indeterminate coefficients , for Q , will contain e+i , and P. will contain l disposable constants , making e+2s disposable constants in all .
Again , Q,.Q and P , P will each rise to the degree n+e+21 in x ; but their sum R , is to be only of n-s dimensions in x. Hence we have to make ( n+e+i-l)-(n-- ) , i.e. e+2--1 quantities ( which are linear in respect to the given coefficients in P and Q , as well as in respect to the new disposable constants in P , and Q , ) all vanish , that is to say , there will be e+2 Il linear homogeneous equations to be satisfied by means of e+2s disposable quantities ; the ratios of these latter are , therefore , determinate , so that we may write P , =Xi,.(P , ) Q , =1 , ( Q ) ; ... ... ( 5 .
) R , ,(R ) and when ( P , ) , ( Q , ) , ( R4 ) are taken prime to one another , it is obvious that ( R , ) will be in all of e+2f dimensions in the given coefficients , i. e. of s in respect of the coefficients of Pi , and of e+s in respect of those of Q : , will correspond to what I have previously called the allotrious factolr ; being in fact foreign to the value of R , as determined by means of the equation ( 4 .
) , and arising only from the particular method employed to obtain it through the tmedium of the system ( 1 .
) : it becomes a matter of some interest and importance to detertnine the values of this allotrious factor for different values of i* .

This may be done by the following method , which is extremely simple , and would admit of a considerable extension in its applications , were it not beside my immediate purpose to digress from the objects set out in the title to the memoir , by entering upon an investigation of the special or singular cases which may arise in the process of forming the continued fraction , when one or more of the leading coefficients in any of the residues vanish ; such an inquiry would require a more general character to be imparted to the values of the quotients and residues than I shall for my present purposes care to suppose .
Let us begin with supposing e=1 , and write f=-ax n+bxn-'+ cxn-2+ &amp;c. ( =vxn-I +PX -2+yxZ-3 + &amp;c. ( 6 Let ; be the first residue of f and w of and therefore of 4 , , so that ' is the second residue of Let w=X((w ) , w being entirely integer , and xa function of the coefficients inf and p. N If we make x= , N and D being integer functions , D will evidently be L2 ; where L denotes the first coefficient in the simplified residue a2p , and is evidently of two dimensions in a , ( , &amp;c. , and of one in a , b , &amp;c. ; Dw is therefore of 2X2+1 , i. e. five dimensions in o , f3 , &amp;c. , and of two dimensions in a , b , &amp;c. ; but w ( by virtue of what has been observed of the equations in system ( 5 .
) ) is of three dimensions in a , 3 , &amp;c. , and of two in a , b , &amp;c. Hence N is of two dimensions in a , 3 , &amp;c. , and of none in a , b , &amp;c. This enables us at once to perceive that N=a2 , for 4 is of the formf-(px+q ) &gt; , , 1 ( 7 .
) and w is of the form p-(p'x+q ' ) J( But N=O makes w vanish , and therefore , upon this supposition , f and p would appear to have a common algebraical factor I4 , that is to say , N vanishing , would appear to imply that the resultant of f and p rmust vanish , so that N would appear to be contained as a factor in this general resultant , which latter is , however , clearly indecomposable into factors-a seeming paradox the solution of which must be sought for in the fact , that the equation N=O is incompatible with the existence of the usual equations ( 7 .
) connecting f , p , 4 and c : but this failure of the existence of the equations ( 7 .
) ( bearing in mind that N has been shown to be a function only of the set of coefficients a , i3 , &amp;c. ) , can only happen by reason of a vanishing whenever N vanishes ; a must therefore be a root of N , or which is the same thing , Na power of ( a ) and hence N=='2 .
The same result may be obtained a posteriori by actually perforning the successive divisions ; if the coefficients of any dividend be a , b , c , d , &amp;c. , and of the divisor 3i2 417 ft a , / 3y , y , , &amp;c. , the first remainder forming the second divisor will be easily seen to have for its coefficientsa beabdabe -( .

Hence the entire determinant is of the form 2(A +B ) , showing that a2 will enter as a factor into this and every subsequent coefficient in the second remainder , as previously demonstrated above .
It may , noreover , be noticed , that this remainder , when a2 has been expelled , will for general values of the coefficients be numerically as well as literally in its lowest terms , as evinced by the fact that there exist terms ( ex.gr .

The same explicit method might be applied to show , that if the first divisor were e degrees instead of being only one degree in x lower than the first dividend , a6e+1 would be contained in every term of the second residue ; the difficulty , however , of the proof by this method augments with the value of e ; but the same result springs as an immrnediate consequence from the method first given , which remains good mutatis mutandis for the general case , as may easily be verified by the reader .
Applying now this result to the functions P and Q , supposed to be of the respective degrees n and n-e in x , and calling the coefficients of the leading termls in the successive simplified residues oa , 23 &amp; 3 , , &amp;c. , and the leading coefficient in Q a , and before denoting the successive allotrious factors by xi , ,2 &amp;c. , it will readily be seen that 1111 1e+ 2-2X1 -a2 3X2A X4.X3%-- , &amp;c. , e12 3* e1 aZe+l 2 e+ 1.2 e. h.-+ , .

In addition to these equations we have the ( e ) equations of the form x &amp; .V=bo.xn+P+b,.xe+-+-+ &amp;c. +. .

There will thus be ( e ) equations in which only the ( b ) set of coefficients aplear , and ( n ) equations containing in every term one coefficient out of each of the two sets .
The total number of equations is of course n-e .
Between the ( e ) equations of the second system ( 13 .

Thus suppose U=a0.x4+a.x3'-a,.x2-a,.x+a4a V= boX+blx +b2 .

Every such square it is apparent may be conceived as a sort of sloped pyramid , formed by the successive superposition of square layers , which layers possess not merely a simple symmetry about a diagonal ( such as is proper to a multiplication table ) , but the higher symmetry ( such as exists in an addition table ) , evinced in all the terms in any line of terms parallel to the diagonal transverse to the axis of symmetry being alike* .
Thus for n-5 , the three layers or stages in question will be seen to be , the firstthe secondand the third(0 , 1 ) ( 0 , 2 ) ( 0 , 3 ) ( 0 , 4 ) ( 0 , 5 ) ( 0 , 2 ) ( 0 , 3 ) ( 0 , 4 ) ( 0 , 5 ) ( 1,5 ) ( 1 , 2 ) ( 1 , 3 ) ( 1 , 4 ) ( 0 , 3 ) ( 0 , 4 ) ( 0 , 5 ) ( 1 , 5 ) ( 2 , 5 ) ( 1 , 3 ) ( 1 , 4 ) ( 2 , 4 ) ( 2 , 3 ) .
In general , when ( n ) is odd , say 2p 1 , the ( 0 , 4 ) ( 0 , 5 ) ( 1,5 ) ( 2 , 5 ) ( 3 , 5 ) ( 0 , 5 ) ( 1 , 5 ) ( 2 , 5 ) ( 3 , 5 ) ( 4 , 5 ) ; ( 1 , 4 ) ( 2 , 4 ) ( 3 , 4 ) ; pyramid will end with a single term ( p , ( p+ ) ) , and when even , as 2p , with a square of 4 terms , ( ( P-2 ) , ( p-I ) ) , ( ( p-2 ) , p ) ( ( p-2 ) p ) , ( ( p- ) , p ) .
Each stage may be considered as consisting of three parts , a diagonal set of equal terms transverse to the axis of symmetry , and two triangular wings , one to the left , and the other to the right of this diagonal ; the terms in each such diagonal for the respective stages will he ( 0 , n ) ; ( 1 , n-1l ) ; ( 2 , ( n2-2 ) ) ; ... ; ( p , ( ( p+l ) ) , en -1 p being -1 when n is even , and when n is odd .
22 If we change the order of the coefficients in each of the two given functions , it will be seen that the only effect will be to make the left and right triangular wings to change places , the diagonals in each stage remaining unaltered .
The mode of forming these triangles is an operation of the most simple and mechanical nature , too obvious to need to be further insisted on here .

When we are dealing with two functions of unequal degrees , n and n+e , we can still form a square matrix with the coefficients of the two systems of ( e ) and ( n ) equations respectively , but this will no longer be symmetrical about a diagonal ; it is obvious , however , that if we treat the function of the lower degree , as if it were of the same degree as the other function , which we may do by filling up the vacant places with terms affected with zero coefficients , the symmetry will be recovered ; and it is somewhat important ( as will appear hereafter ) to compare the values of the 'Bezoutian secondaries as obtained , first in their simplest form by treating each of the two functions as complete in itself , and secondly , as they come out , when that of the functions , which is of the lower degree , is looked upon as a defective form of a function of the same degree as the other .
A single example will suffice to make the nature of the relation between the two sets of results apparent .

Hence it is apparent that the secondary Bezoutians obtained by the symmetrizing method will differ from those obtained by the unsymmetrical method by a constant factor a2 ; and so in general it may readily be shown that the secondary Bezoutians , by the use of the symmetrizing method , will each become affected with a constant irrelevant factor awe , where ( X ) is the difference of the degr ees of the two functions , and ( a ) the leading coefficient of the higher one of the two .
When ( a ) is taken unity , the Bezoutian secondaries , as obtained by either method , will of course be identical .

There is another method* of obtaining the simplified residues to anytwo functions U and V of the degrees n and n+e respectively , which , although less elegant , ought not to be passed over in silence .
This method consists in forming the identical equations ( of which for greater brevity the right-hand members are suppressed ) .
V=- &amp;c. xV= &amp;c. xe .
V= &amp;c. U= &amp;c. x.-V= &amp;c. x.U = &amp;c. Xe , +.V= &amp;c. x.U= &amp;c. X2.V_ &amp;c. &amp; c &amp;c. &amp; ..n-.U= &amp;c. xe+-'.V- &amp;c. If we equate the right-hand members of ( e+2 : ) of the above equations to zero , and then eliminate dialytically the several powers of x from xn+e+'l to x'-'+ ' ( both inclusive ) , the result of this process will evidently be of ( e+ ?
) dimensions in respect of the coefficients in V , and of l dimensions in respect of the coefficients in U ; and of the degree x"- ' in x it will also be of the form ( A+Bx+ ... Lxe-1)U+(FGx+ ... +Qxe+ ' ) , and by virtue of art .
( 2 .

The most general view of the siubject of expansion by the rmethod of continued division , consists in treating the process as having reference solely to the two systems of coefficients in U and V , which themselves are to be regarded in the light of generating functions .
To carry out this conception , we ought to write U-=o+al.y+a.y2+ay3+ &amp;c. ad inf .
V= bo + b..y + b , y2+ by3 + &amp;c. ad inf .
, and might then suppose the process of successive division applied to U and V , so as to obtain the successive equations UV -M +Ri =V M2R+R2=O R1-M3R2+R3=0 &amp;c. &amp;c. , M1 , M , , M , , &amp;c. being each severlally of any degree whatever in y , and in general the degree of y in M , being any given arbitrary function p '( ) of i. The values of the coefficients of the residues Ri , R1 , Rt ... , or of these forms simplified by the rejection of detachable factors , becomes then the distinct object of the inquiry , and will , of course , depend only upon the coefficients in P and Q and the nature of the arbitrary continuous or discontinuous function p( : ) , which regulates the number of steps through which each successive process of division is to be pursued .
Following out this idea in a particular case , if we again reduce to our two initial functions the forms previously enmployed , and write U= a , O.+ a.x"- ' + &amp;c. V=bo .
X+-b,.Xn-l'+ &amp;c. ; and if , instead of making , according to the more usual courcse of proceeding , the divisions proceed first through one step and ever after through two steps at a time which is tantamount to making 1-=l1 p(1+X)=2 , we push each division through one step only at a time , and no more ( so that in fact p(i ) is always 1 ) , we shall have U -m , .

R+ R4=0 &amp;c. &amp;c. , 427 f EXPANDED m7n , 2 , m , &amp;c. being functions of the coefficients only of U and V ; and it is not without interest to observe ( which is capable of an easy demonstration ) that the simplified residues contained in R , , R2 , &amp;c. , found according to this mode of development , will be the successive dialytic resultants obtained by eliminating the ( s-l)th highest powers of x between the i first of the system of the annexed equations ( supposed to be expressed in terms of z ) U=O VO v=o x. -0 x.V=0-x2 U0 x2 V=0 &amp;c. &amp;c. X -l.U= x-1.V=o .
If we combine together 2i+ of the above equations , the highest power of x entering on the left-hand side will be Xn"i , and we shall be able to eliminate 2i of these factors , leaving xt"the highest power remaining uneliminated .
If we take 2i , i. e. i pairs of the equations , the highest power of x appearing in any of them will be x"+- ' , and we shall be able to eliminate between them so as still to leave ni-l-(2i-1 i. e. i as before , the highest power of x remaining unelimlinated ; and it will be readily seen that such of the sianplified residues corresponding to this mode of development as occupy the odd places in the series of such residues , will be identical with the successive simplified residues resulting from the ordinary tode of developing V under the form of a continued fiaction .

It has been shown that the sitnplified residues of fx and qx resulting from the process of continued division are identical in point of form withi the secondary Bezoutians of these fuinctions , but it remains to assign the numerical relations between any such residue and the corresponding secondary .
To determine this numerical relation , it will of course be sufficient to compare the magnitude of the coefficient of any one power of x in the one , with that of the same power in the other ; and for this purpose I shall make choice of the leading coefficients in each .
In what follows , and throughout this paper , it will always be understood that in calculating the determinant corresponding to any square the product of the terms situated in the diagonal descending from left to right will always be taken with the positive sign , which convention will serve to determine the sign of all the other products entering into such determinant .
Now adopting the umbral notation for determinants* , we have , by virtue of a much more general theorem for compound determinansts , the following identical equation:ala2a , ... am_l ala2a , ... am+ x 123 ?

We shall have occasion to use this theorem as applicable to the case of a matrix symmetrical throughout , and we may term the progression ( II ) above written a progression of the successive principal determinants about the axis of symmetry of the square matrix ( M ) , and so in general .
Now it is obvious that the leading coefficients of the successive Bezoutian secondaries are the successive principal determinants about the axis of symmetry of the Bezoultian squares ; they will therefore have the property which has been demonstrated of such progressions ; to wit , if the first of them vanishes , the second will have a sign contrary to that of + I1 ; if the second vanishes , the third will have a sign contrary to that of the first , and so on .

Now letfx and px be any two algebraical functions of x with the leading coefficients in each , for greater simplicity Lupposed positive : and in the course of developing Lf under the form of an improper continued fraction by the common process of successive division , let any two consecutive residues ( the word residue being used in the same conventional sense as employed throughout ) be Ax+B'-1+ Cx'-2+ &amp;c. B'x'-~ +C'x'-2-+D'x'-3+ &amp;c. The residue next following , obtained by actually performing the division and duly changing the sign of the remainder will be { ( AD )(AC ' ) &amp; C , which is of the form 2{B'M-AC'2}^XL2+ &amp;c. Thus the leading coefficients in the complete unreduced residues will be A ; B ' ; B , B'M-AC'2 and when reduced by the expulsion of the allotrious factor will become A ; B ' ; B'.M-A C'2 , and consequently , when B ' the leading coefficient of one of the simplified residues vanishes , the leading coefficients of the residues immediately preceding and following that one will have contrary signs .
First , let fx=ax-n+bxn+ &amp;c. , px=ax"-+P"-1+ &amp;c. As regards the numerical ratio of each Bezoutian secondary to the corresponding simplified residue , it has been already observed that there are always unit coefficients in the latter of these , and the same is obviously true of the former ; hence if we call the progression of the leading coefficients of the simplified residues R1 ; R2 ; R , ; R4 , &amp;c. , and that of the leading coefficients of the Bezoutian secondaries B , ; B2 ; B3 ; B4 , &amp;c. , we have B , =:_R , B , = ?
R , B3=-R , B , = ?
R , , &amp;c. It may be proved by actual trial that B , =R , and B2=R2 .
Moreover , since the signs are invariable , and do not depend upon the values of the coefficients , we may suppose B=0O ( which may always be satisfied by real values of the quantities , of which B , is a function ) ; we shall also , therefore , have R2=0 , and consequently B , has the opposite sign to that of B , , and Rs the opposite sign to that of RI , which is equal to B1 ; hence when B , =0 , B , and R3 are equal , and consequently are always equal ; in like manner we can prove that R , and B , have the same sign when R , and B , vanish , and consequently are always equal , and so on ad libitum , which proves that the series B1 , B2 , ... B , is identical with the series R , , R , ... R. , and consequently that the Bezoutian secondaries are identical in form , magnitude and algebraical sign with the simplified residues .
Secondly , when fx and ( x are not of the same degree , it has been shown that the secondaries formed from the non f EXPANDED symmetrical mratrix corresponding to this case will be the same as those formed from the symmetrical matrix corresponding to fx and 4D(x ) ( where &lt; )x is p(x ) treated by aid of evanescent terms , as of the same degree asfv ) , with the exception merely of a constant multiplier ( a power of the leading coefficient of fx ) being introduced into each secondary .
By aid of this observation , the proposition established for the case of two fuinctions of the same degree may be readily seen to be capable of being extended , from the case of f and p being of the equal dimensions in x , to the general case of their dimensions being any whatever .

Before closing this section , it may be well to call attention to the nature of the relation which connects the successive residues of fx and px with these functions themselves , and with the improper continued fractional form into which ^ is supposed to be developed in the process of obtaining these residues .
If px be of n degrees , andfx of n+e degrees in ( n ) , we shall have ~x 1111 fx 1-Q q2q3qn where Q1 may be supposed to be a function of x of the degree ( e ) , and q2 , q3 ... q are all linear functions of x ; the total number of the quotients Q1 , q , , ... q being of course ( n ) when the process of continued division is supposed to be carried out until the last residue is zero .
Upon this supposition the last but one residue is a constant , the preceding one a function of x of the first degree , the one preceding that a function of x of the second degree , and so on .

) we see that - ; , the fraction formed by the component factors to any simplified residue of ( f , p ) , will be identical in value ( although no longer in its separate terms ) with one of the corresponding convergents to f , exhibited under the form of an improper continued fraction .
I shall in the next section show how , not only the successive simplified residues , but also the component syzygetic factors of each of them , and consequently the successive convergents , may be expressed in terms of the roots of the two given functions .
Since the preceding section was composed the valuable memoir of the lamented JACOBI , entitled " 'De Eliminatione Variabilis e duabus Equationibus Algebraicis , " CRELLE , vol. xvi .
, has fallen under my notice .
That memoir is restricted to the consideration of two equations of the same degree , and the principal results in this section as regards the Bezoutic square and the allotrious factors applicable to that case will be found contained therein .
The mode of treatment however is sufficiently dissimilar to justify this section being preserved unaltered under its original form .

On the general solution in terms of the roots of any two given algebraical functions of x of the syzygetic equation , which connects them with a third function , whose degree in ( x ) is given , but whose form is to he determined .

Letf and p be two given functions in x of the degrees m and n respectively in x , and for the sake of greater simplicity let the coefficients of the highest power of x in f and p be each taken unity , and let it be proposed to solve the syzygetic equation,./ f-t+,.po+ , ... ... ... . .

In either case therefore every term included r % +11v+2 J within the sign of summation vanishes when x=ha=-- , i. e. whenever f(x)=O and P=-()=0 .
Hence , , as given by equation ( 19 .

Hence the whole sum of terms in ( 22 .
) which is made up of such pairs of terms , and of other terms in which E1-E2 does not enter , remains finite when El-E2=O , and therefore generally when D =O0 , and similarly when H1 H2=O , and therefore also when A=O ; hence the expression for 5 in ( 22 .

Let us now proceed to determine the dimensions of the coefficient of x ' , the highest power of x in this value of , , when supposed to be expressed under the form of an integral function ( as it has been proved to be capable of being expressed ) of h1 h2 ... h ; 71.2.*n ; X. This coefficient is the sum of fractions the numerators of each of which consist of two factors , which are respectively of vXv and of ( m-v)X ( n-v ) dimensions in respect of the two sets of roots taken conjointly , and the denominators of two factors respectively of v.(m-v ) and vX ( n-v ) dimensions in respect of the same .
Consequently , the exponent of the total dimensions of the coefficient in question =v X " P+(my)(n--v)-v(m--v ) -(v .

I shall now demonstrate that every form in this scale ( to a numerical factor pres ) is identical with a simplified residue to f , p of the same degree i in x. Any such simplified residue is like , , a syzygetic function , or to use a briefer form of speech , a conjunctive of f , &lt; ; and if we agree to understand by the " weight " of any function of the coefficients off and p its joint dimensions in respect of the roots of f and p combined , I shall prove , -1st , that any simplified residue off and p of a given degree in x is that conjunctive , whose weight in respect of the roots off and p is less than the weiglt of any other such conjunctive ; and 2nd , that 5 , , as determined above ( in equation 24 .
) , is of the same weight as the sitnplified esidue , and can therefore only differ from it by some numerical factor .
For the purpose of comparison of weights , it will of course be sufficient to confine our attention to the coefficients of the highest ( or any other , the same power , for each ) in x of the forms whose weights are to be compared .

Now the total number of arbitrary constants in the system ( A ) and ( L ) will be n-1 +-i+e-m+2 , i. e. i+ 1 ; hence the total number of arbitrlary constants in S and ( x , Jx .
X will be i+l +t i. e. q-n+i+2 , which is equal to q+i+e-m+2 , the number of arbitrary constants in the most general values of A and L.

If now we proceed in like manner with the general case of m=n+e , it may be shown , in precisely the same way as in the preceding article , that the most general value of any conjunctive off and p will be a linear function of ( e ) functions , and of the ( n ) functions , K , .

From this we infer that any conjunctive of f and p of the degree i , of which the leading coefficient is of the weight ( m-i)(n-i ) ( all the coefficients being of course understood to be integral functions of the roots off and p ) , must , to a numerical factor pros , be equivalent to any other of the same weight ; and furthermore , any supposed function of x of the , th degree which possesses the property characteristic of a conjunctive of vanishing , whenf and n vanish simultaneously , but of which the weight of the leading coefficient would be less than ( m--)(n--i ) , must be a mere nugatory form and have all its terms identically zero* .

We have previously shown , art .

Moreover , its weight in the roots has been proved to be ( m)(n-- ) , and consequently , if by way of distinguishing the several forms of , we name that one where I in the equation above cited is supposed to be divided into two parts , v and v , v , , we have for all values of v and Y , such that v+v is not greater than n , % , to a constant numerical factor pres identical with the ( v+v)th simplified residue to ( f , p ) , so that the form of k , , depends only upon the value of v+v .

It must be well borne in mind that this permanency of the value of v , for different values of v has only been established for the case where i can be the degree of a residue tof and p , that is to say , when i is less than the lesser of the two indices m and n. When i does not satisfy this condition of inequality , the theoremr ceasets to be tue .
It is clear that when m=n and v+-v=m=n , s , " which always remains a conjunctive off and , p , can only be a numerical linear function off and , ; and I have ascertained when m=n on giving to v and y the respective values successively ( 0 , n ) , ( 1 , n-1 ) , ( 2 , ( n--2 ) ) , ...

The expression a , , , which is universally a conjunctive of f and p , continues algebraically interpretable so long as v+v has any value intermediate between ( 0 ) and m-+n ; when v+v=O , we must of course have v=O and y=0 , and S , , becomes the resultant off and p when v+=mn+n ; we must also have the unique solution -v=m and v =n , and ^2 , becomes necessarily , fx p , which we thus see stands in a sort of antithetical relation to the resultant off and p , say ( f , p ) .
Nor is it without interest to remark thatfx =0O imrplies that a root of f or else of p is zero ; and ( f , p)=0 implies that if a root of the one of the functions is zero , so also is a root of the other , i. e. that a root of each or of neither is zero .
As i increases from 0 to n or decreases from m+n to m1 , the number of solutions of the equation v+v=i in the one case , and the number of admissible solutions of the equation v+v=i in the other case , which is subject to the condition that Y must not exceed n , continues to increase by a unit at each step ; there being thus n+ different forms 5 , , when v+pv=n , and the same number when wy=m1 .
For all values of i intermediate between n and ( m1 ) ( both taken exclusively ) it is very remarkable that av , will vanish , as I proceed to demonstrate .

The weight of the coefficient of the highest power of , , ( v+y being equal to i ) is ( m-i)(n-i ) , and consequently , when i is greater than n , and less than m , , , would contain fractional functions of the roots off and p , if there were in it a power x\ , but a , has been proved to be always an integer function of the roots .
Hence the coefficient of x will be zero , and so more generally the first power of x in 2\ , , of which the coefficient is not zero , will be xc , subject to the condition ( since evidently the weight of the several coefficients goes on increasing by units as the degree of the terms in x decreases by the same ) that w be not less than ( m-i)(i--n ) ; let then y=(m-i)(i-n ) , a , , becomes of the form Axc"+Bx-i-`'+ &amp;c. , where A is of zero dimensions ; but this is imupossible if i-w- &lt; n , for then Ax'-"'+ &amp;c. is a conjunctive of 443 qx , fJ weight lower than the lowest-weighted simplified residue of the degree i--w .
Hence w is not greater than i-n or ( m-i)(i-n ) is not greater than i-n , i. e. m-i cannot be greater than 1 , i. e. i when intermediate between m and n cannot be less than m-1 , otherwise S , , will vanish identically .
Moreover , when i=m-1 , w=i-n , and i-_w=n , and accordingly S , m+i- , is not merely , as we might know , a priori an algebraical , but more simply a numerical multiple of p for all values of v. The same is of course true also , m being greater than n , for every form S. , - , , , since this is always a conjunctive off and ~ , of which the former is of a degree higher than the a in question , so that the multiplier off in this conjunctive must be zero* .

To enter into a further or more detailed examination of the values assumed by e , for the most general values of m , n , i , would be to transcend the limits I have proposed to myself in drawing up the present memoir .
What we have established is , that to every form of , i , _ appertaining to a value of i between 0 and n , there is a sort of conjugate form for which i lies between m+n and m ; that for i=mI or i=n , S _ , , becomes a numerical multiplier of p ; and that when i lies in the intermediate region between n and m-1 , Sv , ivanishes for all values of v. I pause only for a moment to put together for the purpose of comparison the forms corresponding to i and to m+n-i .

Our proper business is only with those forms for which i &lt; n. Art .

It will prbe goesently be seetaking to be necessary to ascertain the numerical relations between S , i and 0 when i &lt; n , and this naturally brings under our notice the 0x , fx .
inquiry into the numerical relations which exist between the entire series of forms , _i- , for a given value of i , corresponding to all values of v between 0 and i inclusive .
In order to avoid a somewhat oppressive complication of symbols , I shall take a particular nurmerical example , i. e. m=7 n=6 i=4 , and compare the values of 40,41,3 ; 1 , ,2 ; 2 , 3 , ; 4,0 , all of which we know to be identical , [ to a numerical factor pres ] with one another and with the second simplified residue tof and p , that being of the fourth degree in x ; our object in the subjoined investigation is to determine the numerical ratios of these several forms of S to one another .
First .
Let v=O v=4 .
The leading coefficient 50,4 is 45 46 Eh , h. h3 h4 hh h7h 41 42 43 74 which we know a priori ( it should be observed ) to be essentially an integral function of the h and the X system .
In this , the term containing 3v will be evidently 45 ( A.)\ , hl h , 3 h4 h5 h6 h7 ( A.).7 -------------45 41 42 43 74 the t system to which the latter summation relates being now reducedl to consist of 14,2 34 4 , 5 .
In this expression , again , the coefficient of 3i is evidently 1 .
Hence , therefore , the leading coefficient in 50,4 contains the ternm 3. .
Secondly .
Let v=l v=3 .
The leading coefficient in l,3 becomes ; ^1 ; 72 43 X4 45 46 Lh Lh2h3hh h ha 14 3 ah7j h2 h3 h4h , s h6 h71 X ?
4 ^5 6~ In this , the factor affecting 36 will be hi J Lh2h3h4h5Ah h2 L h , h ] hK h7 , h h6 h45 46 being now understood to be eliminated out of the X system included within the above summation .
Again , in this latter sum the factor affecting 43 will be X h2h3h4h , hh6 h7 ( B. ) hj LA3 5^7 * [ AS/ ~ ^3 M fiM^562h34h ] h4 ]~ Li 4 Jx L4243 5 , and 46 being now both eliminated out of the n system .
This last sum can of course only represent a numerical quantity .
445 ( x , fx So in like manner , again , if v=2 v=2 , the coefficient of nl .
will be similarly reducible to the form ~ 21 ; 72 n3 44 C h2 L h34 h5 h6 h7 in ~(C.* ) ^~jh hhhkhh4 h h7h r3 1n4 22 hjh2 h h2 , So , again , when v=3 Y=-1 , the coefficient of I.3 will be\h4 h5l 6 h7 F2 43 544 n 63 ( D.)Lhi hh hh6h in 2 iL ; Lh h2 , hX ~1 and finally , the coefficient of n6.n ' will be Fi1 % 4344 h , h6 h7 ( E. ) 3/ jE , Sj h63 I. in Sox 4 , Lh h2 h h4 , out of all which sums it is to be remembered that 45 and6 are supposed excluded from appearing .
All these several coefficients being numbers in disguise , we may determine them by giving any values at pleasure to the terms in the h and v system .

The method employed in the preceding investigation will enable us to affix the proper sign and numerical factor to ao , i or,0o , or in general to , ,_ , ,in order that it may represent the Bezoutian secondary of the degree i in x. [ This latter has been already identified with the simplified residue obtained by expanding fr under the form of an improper continued fraction .
] For this purpose , it will be sufficient to compare a single term of any such a with the corresponding one in the Symmorphic Bezoutian secondary .
Let us first suppose that mn=n , fand ; being of ( x , fx the same dlegree .
A glance at the form of the Bezoutian square will show that if we form the Bezoutian secondary of the degree ( n-i ) in x , the coefficient of its leading term will contain the term ( --)i-01 ( 0 , i)i ; ( 0 , i ) as usual denoting the product of the coefficient of X in f by the coefficient of x"- ' in p , less the product of the coefficient of x in p by that of x-i in f ; and as we suppose the first coefficients in / ' and p to be each 1 , if we term the other coefficients last spoken of a , and ac , respectively , this said coefficient of the leading term of the itth Bezoutian secondary will contain the term ( --)-)(ai--c)i , and consequently ( l)(i-1)2.ai and ( --)ta .
Now by the like reasoning as that employed in the preceding article , the coefficient of the leading term in m_- , ,o i.e. 2(x--h , ,+)(x-hqJ+2 ) ... ( whq , ) 1/ 2 L hq'il hq2i+ * fpx , x. Bat since kZ+ , , k , ,+2. .

If now we return to the syzygetic equation , r.f--t+--=0 , a may be treated as known , having in fact been completely determined as a function of the roots , as well in its most general form , as also so as to represent the simplified residues tof and p in the preceding articles ; it remains to determine the values of r and t as functions of the roots corresponding to any allowable form of a , but I shall confine the investigation to the case where a is the lowest-weighted conjunctive , or which is the same thing , a simplified residue to t and p of any given degree in x ; each value of t will then represent one of the convergents to 1 when expanded under the form of a continued fraction .
If 5 be of the ith degree in x , r is of the degree ( n-i--1 ) and t of the degree ( m-i-1- ) .
This being supposed , and calling n--i--i = , m--i-1=-p , I say that t will be represented by G and r by F , where hq , hq2 ... .hq , G=(-)2(xh )(xh 2 ) ... ( x-hq ) 1 h2 *..h , , L_hq+l hq+ ... .hqJ Lhqt+li h14+2 2hQ'Ymn_ and r is an analogous form F ; h , h2 ... hm , as heretofore , being the roots off ; and , Y , ... , of p. To fix the ideas and nake the demonstration more immediately seizable , give m and n specific values ; thus let m=5 , n=4 , i=2 , so that -=5-2--1=2 .
Put 5 under the form o,0 , so that a in the case before us hq3 hq4 hq5 - &gt; ( x-h V2 h ^L-1 42 43 ; 4 hql hq , J3N2 449 fx , Jx Now make x=h , thenf==O , and 9becomes hq hq hq5 1.(h-hL )(hh h q2 ) h q5 hi i h2 h31 L h4 h5 1h being kept constant in the above sum , but h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 being partitionable in all the six possible ways into two groups , as into h4 , h , , h2 , h3 in the term above expressed .
This sum is evidently identical with h2 h31 h h3 L 41 h2 h,3 ; 74 , i.e. X ] 1~ '34 'ih2h3^l eLU 1 , , ? ?
2~h h3 , F L2 Lh3 ki Lh4 h4 h5 Again , p becomes L 13 Hence t=becomes hpt h2 h Lhh ] ( =(-1)h.t .
Thus when x=hk , t=G .
In like manner , when x--h , , or h3 , or h4 , or h5 , t always =G ; but t and G are both functions of x of the same degree , and of only two dimensions in x. Hence t is identical with G. So in general it may be proved , that whenever x=hl , or h1 or h3 ... or hl , , t and G , which are each of only ( n--1 -i ) dimensions in , x , j fx .
are equal .
Hence universally t=G , as was to be shown .
To find r we must avail ourselves of the symmorphic , or as we may better say ( it being at the opposite extremity of the scale of forms , the antimorphic ) , value of 2 represented by ( , , , taking care to preserve a strictly identical under both forms of representation , in point of sign as well as quantity .

If now we use siubscript indices to ( lenote the degree in x of the quantities to which they are affixed , we have the general syzygetic equation Krm_i-lfm-Kt m--l,.-+Ki-=0 , where K , a constant ( which I have given the means of determining in the first section ) , being tightly assumed K.r , _il , , KrM_1 , become the numerator and denominator respectively of one of the convergents to , expressed as an improper continued tmnfraction , and Kai becomes the denominator to one of the convergents to f- , or , fr , f Tn-1 which is the same thing , to -* .
Conversely , it is obvious that if we adopt as our primitive functions cf(m ) and tm_l , ( c ) being the value of K when i=O , we shall obtain as the general form of our syzygetic equation , bearing in mind that ( mI ) now replaces ( n ) , C. K'()m -fmK'n_iftm_+K'ti-O ; and similarly , if we adopt as our primitive functions _-1 and cp , , we obtain for our general syzygetic equation , observing that ( n1 ) now replaces ( m ) , KWn_-i-1.M ?
cK'.5_._i_.+K%--O ; so that ( nimaking abstraction of the constant factors and looking merely to the forms of the several functions which enter into the equations ) we see that on the first hypothesis , viz. of t_l being substituted for p , the conjunctives of each degree in x change places with the second conjunctive factors , i. e. the original multipliers of p of the same degree in x , and vice versa ; and in the second hypothesis , where a , d takes the place of fn , the conjunctives of each degree in x change places with the first conjunctive factors , i. e. the original multipliers off of the same degree in x , and vice versed ; t_ml and r^_being respectively multipliers of ( and Jf such that the difference of the respective products is independent of x. These results ought to be capable of being verified by aid of ou1 ' general formulae for t , ?
, 5 , and as this verification will serve to exhibit in a clearer light the nature of the reciprocity between the conjunctives and the conjunctive factors , it may be not uninteresting to set it out .

It may be remarked that if n=m1 ( the last syzygetic equation being thus tmi.-im--.fS.m+o-0 ) , when t._and f , are taken as the primitives , the corresponding equation will be of the form t m-1.tmf1m+-M-2fn+a'#O ; these two equations must therefore be identical , and consequently t'm_ , -= m ( to a numerical factor pros ) , so that tm_l and p , _i are reciprocal forms ; this is also obvious from the consideration that t ' , _l must , by the general law of reciprocity ( established above ) , be a residue to ( fm , p_m- ) , which the latter function itself may be considered to be .

It is evident from the form of f'.x that it possesses relative to fx , the same property as fx , I mean the property that when x is indefinitely near to a real root of fx f , x ) fx , and is passing from the inferior to the superior side of such root , x like- ) will ft ft pass from being negative to being positive , or in other words , fx and f'x have always the same sign in the immediate vicinity to a real root of fx .
Hence it follows that f:(x ) might be used instead off'x , to produce , by the Sturmian process of common measure , a series of auxiliary functions , which with fx and f'.x would form a rhizoristic series , i. e. a series for determining ( as in the manner of M. STURM'S ordinary auxiliaries ) the number of real roots of fx comprised within given limits .
The rhizoristic series generated by this process will , it is easily seen , be ( to a constant factor pres ) the denominators ( reckoning +1 as the denominator in the zero f1^ place ) of the successive convergents to thrown under the form of a continued fraction -_ ---** _ ; M. STURM'S own rhizoristic series , on the contrary ( will q1q2 qn-iqn be to a constant factor pr &amp; s ) , the denominators of the convergents to the inverse fractionf , which will be of the form K._ ; accordingly these two fX n qn-q~ rhizoristic series will be equivalent as regards the number of changes and of combinations of sign ( afforded byeach ) corresponding to any given value of x , of which of course the q 's are linear functions .
This result agrees with what has been demonstrated by me by a more general method ( in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine , June and July 1853 ) , where it has been proved , by means of a very simple theorem of determinants , that the two series 1111111111 q1 q q2qlq2q3 q , q2q3 qn and 1 ' 11111111 qn q nqn-1 q-n q-1 qn-2 q qn-qn--2 ql always contain ( for real values of ql , q2 , q3 ... qn ) the same number of positive and negative signs .

Having now determined the general values of 2 and t in the equation tf'(x ) -rfx+9=O as explicit integral functions of the roots of fx , the more difficult task remains to assign to r its value similarly expressed .
This cannot readily be effected by means of substitutions in the general formulae , the method we adopted for finding t and 9 ; but all the other quantities except r in the syzyzetic equation being integral functions of the roots , it is evident that r also must be an integral function tfx of the same , and to obtain it we may use the expression r-= fTo obtain the general form of r by direct calculation from this formula would however be found to be impracticable ; the mode I adopt therefore to discover the general expression for r corresponding to different values of 5 , is to ascertain its value on the hiypothesis of particular relations existing between the roots of fx , and then from the particular values of 'r thus obtained to infer demonstratively its general form , as will be seen below .
The demonstration of r is unavoidably somewhat long , 'r being in fact represented by a double sum of partial symmetrical functions .
Using the subscript indices of each function as the syzygetic equation to denote its degree in x , we have in general tm-i_lf'X-m~_i_2fX +-i 0 , where if we make hl -x= k h2-x=k2 c= ... ... ... h^-xkm , so that hi-h , =ki-k , , and therefore ( hoI h02 ... hop ) =(ko , k2.ekop .

This relationship between the different k 's corresponding to a multiplicity 3 may arise in different ways ; the multiplicity 3 may be divided into 3 units corresponding to 3 pairs of equal roots , or into 2 and 1 corresponding one set of 3 equal roots , and a second set of 2 equal roots , or may be taken " en bloc , " which corresponds to the case of one set of 4 equal roots .
I shall make the first of these suppositions , which will sufficiently well answer our purpose in the case before us .
Thus I shall suppose k-=k4 k2= k , k3=k6 , then , as above remarked , $(kkq kq kq k k ) =O for all values of q3 q4 q5 q6 q7 , and therefore kql2 kq2(kq kq4 q5 k6 k =)= ; also kql kq2 kq3 kq4 kq5 kq6 becomes k , k2 k , ( kl .

Hence 2ckq , lkq kq kq , ( kql kq2 kq kq=2k k kqk q4 ) 2(k k7 k k7c ) , and consequently r , becomes ?
8((kj k2 k k7 ) X { kl k2 , k3+2k7(k , k2+kl k3 + k2 3 ) } .
Hence we are able to predict that the general expression for our r in the case before us will be ( kq4+k+ ( q+6 ) ( kq4+kq5+kq6 ) ( k+ql+ kq+ kq3+kq7)s 1 r3= Z{((kql kq2 ; kq3kq7 ) X &lt; +(kq4+kq5+kq6 ) ( kql*.kq2+ kql .

kq7 ) For in the first place , the fact that the r vanishes when more than three relations of equality exist between the k 's , proves that we may assume , of the form E{ ( kq kq2 kq3 kq7 )X { kql kq2 kq3 kq7 ; q4 Ckq5 q6 } , the semicolon ( ; ) separating the k 's into two groups , in respect of each of which severally p is a symmetrical form .
But if in the expression last above written for 73 we make kl=k4 k2=k,5 k-3=k6 , it becomes ( k3+kI+kl)(kk22+kI)(k , +Ikc+k3+k7 ) T8S(kI k2 k7 ) +(klc+k2+k3)(k1 k2+kl k , +k , k , +kl ki +k2 k7+ ?

Consequently the sum of the terms constituting the second factor in the above expression =(3-4)k,.k , 3+(2-4)k7(k , k2+k , k,3+k , k3 ) .
Hence the above expression becomes ?
8t(k1 I , k , k7 ) { kj,.k,.k3+2(k , k , +kl k , +k k , )k } .
Thus , then , whenever k , k2 k , are respectively equal to any three of the quantities 4k , k , k,7 , which may take place in twenty-four different ways { twenty-four being the number of permutations of four things } , our tr , will have been correctly assumed ; but t(k , c k , k , k , ) being replaceable by ( hl hA hq , h7 ) , the,3 may be treated as a cubic function in ki , k , k , and arranged according to the powers of k , k kS will contain only twenty terms ; hence , since the assumed form is verified for more than twenty , i. e. for twenty-four values of hl , h , , h3 , it follows that the assumed form is universally identical with the form of r , which was to be determined .

Now , again , in order to facilitate the conception of the general proof , let us suppose fx to be of only five dimensions in x , i still remaining 3 : it will no longer be possible when we suppose a multiplicity three to prevail among the roots , to conceive this multiplicity to be distributed into three parts , for that would require the existence of three pairs of roots , there being only five .
But we may , if we please , make hl=h , =h , , and h4=h , , or else Ih1=h , -=k=h4 , or in any other mode conceive the multiplicity to be divided into two parts , 2 and 1 respectively , or to be taken collectively " en bloc .

kql kq , kq kq4X { :kqkl kq , ( klc , I ) } , and t(k , l kq , ) will vanish , except in the case where q1 represent the indices 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 , and q2 the index 5 ; also kl ` k12 kqi kq k,4=ql +4k. .
k. Hence our equation becomes Ict.kS.r= + ( k +4k : k5)4kl.k ( kl , k ) , and r becomes --4 ( k ks)(k +4kr ) .
If , now , we assume for the general value of 7 in the case before us r=2(k , l k5){(k2 +k , +k+)-4(k , f+Aq ) } , when k-=k- , -2=-=k,4 , r becomes + ?
4(kl k , )(3k1-(4k , +k , ) ) , i. e. ?
-4(k , k5)(k , +4k3 ) .
Hence then for the two systems of values of h , h , h , , viz. = h , hi = h , h=-h4 or h2= h5 h , =h4 h3=h , , the form of 'r will have been correctly assumed .
But since the derived form is a linear function of h , , h , , h , , this is not enough to identify the assumed with the general form , since for such verification four systems of values must be taken , four being the number of terms in a function of three variables of the first degree .
If , however , we had adopted a separation of the multiplicity three inlto two parts , and had started with supposing k , =k , =k3 k4=k , , we should have found that r would have become =69(kj , k5)(2k , +3k5 ) .
Moreover , when these equalities subsist , k , k2 k k4+kl k2 , ,+kl k2 k4 k , + k , k3 k4 , k , + , k4 k , becomes 2k3 k , +3^k.k2 , and the commno factor k4.k4 disappears in the course of the operations for finding r , and eventually we have to show ( in order to support the universality of the previously assumed form for r ) that rq2 + 4q3 +4 41(8Q1 + 72 ) becomes -2 24q-35 when 7q2 -rq3 7q 1l and which is evidently true .
Hence then r will have been correctly assumed for the following cases , k1_k.2-k =k k , =k2 , -k , =k4 and also for the cases -k , =k=k , and k5=k4 k=k- , k , and k , =-k4 k,2-k= -k and k , =k4 kl=k , -=k and k , ^k3 k , =k , =k4 and 2 , =k3 I k2=k , = k4 and kl=k3 , i. e. for eight cases in all , whereas four only would have stfficed .
Hence , " ex abundantid demonstrationis , " the form assumed for r , is in the case before us the general form .

( a.)* We have now succeeded in exhibiting the forms of the numerators and fx denorminators of-xf developed into a continuled fraction in terms of the differences of the roots and factors of fx .
It remains to exhibit the quotients themselves of this continued fraction under a similar form .
Lemmra.-An equation being supposed of an arbitrary degree n , there exists no function of n and of less than 2i of the coefficientsf , which vanishesfor all values of n whenever the n roots reduce in any manner to i distinct groups of equal roots ; or in other words , any function of n and the first 2i--1 coefficients of an equation of the nth degree , which vanishes for all values of n in every case where the roots retain only i distinct names , must be identically zero .
To render the statement of the proof more simple , let i be taken equal to 3 .
And let the roots be supposed to reduce to p roots a , q roots b , and r roots c. And let s , in general denote the sum of the rth powers of the roots .
Then we have evidently p +q +r =so pa +qb +rc =s , pa 2qb2+rc"=s , pa3+ qb3+rc'3=S3 pa4 , qb4+rc4-=s , &amp;c. &amp;c. , ad infinitum .
Eliminating p , q , r between the first , second , third and fourth equations , we obtain 111 s , abc s$_ a , b ' c si a ' b ' c ' s , a3 b3 c3 s8 In like manner elinminating ap , bq , cr between the second , third , fourth and fifth equations , we have 111 s , ' abc s2 a2 b2 C2 S=0 3 a3 b3 C3 4 and so in general we have for all values of e , 111 se abc se+l et1oO ; a2 b2 c2 Se+2 a3 b3 3 Se+3 whence it may immediately be deduced , that , upon the given supposition of there being only three groups of distinct roots , we must have the following infinite system of coexisting equations satisfied , viz.sot+s , u+s2vs , w-=O say Lo=0 s , t+s , u+S2v+s 4w=0 L1=0 s2t s , u+s 4+s , w =0 L2==0 S3t + S4u+ +s s -= 0 L3= s4t+s4u+s , v+sw=0- , L4=0 , &amp;c. &amp;c. c. .
, and conversely , when this infinite system of equations is satisfied the roots must reduce themselves to three groups of equal roots .
Let now p be any function of SO s s2 ... s , , which vanishes when this is the case .
Then p must necessarily contain as a factor some derivee of the infinite system of equations above written , i. e. some function of sO s , s , &amp;c. , which vanishes when these equations are satisfied ; i. e. some conjunctive of the quantities Lo L , L , L3 ; but it is obviously impossible in any such conjunctive to exclude sf from appearing , unless by introducing some other s with an index higher than 6 , and consequently 0 cannot be merely a function of so s1 s2 s , s s , , nor consequently of n , and the first five coefficients ; or if such , it is identically zero , and so in general any function of n , and only 2i--1 of the coefficients , which vanishes when the roots reduce to i groups of equal roots , must be identically zero , as was to be proved .

( b. ) It ought to be observed that the preceding reasoning depends essentially upon the circumstance of n being left arbitrary .
Ifn were given the proposition would no longer be true .
In fact , on that supposition , the n roots reducing to i distinct roots would imply the existence of n--i conditions between the n roots ; and consequently n-i independent equations would subsist between the n coefficients , and functions could be formred of i only of the coefficients , which would satisfy the prescribed condition of vanishing when the roots resolved themselves into i groups of distinct identities .

But the Leasoning of the preceding article shows that although these equations are necessary and sufficient , they are but a selected system of equations of an infinite number of similar equations which subsist* , and that , in fact , whatever be the value of ( n ) , we may take r , r2 ... ri perfectly arbitrary and as great as we please , and the equation Dr..2 .
ri=0 must exist by virtue of the existence of the n-i equations last above written .

( d. ) I now return to the question of expressing the successive quotients offas functions of the differences of the roots and factors ; that they must be capable of being so expressed is an obvious consequence of the fact , that the numerators and denominators of the convergents have been put under that form , since if Ni-2 N N , D , -2 Di-_ Di are any three consecutive convergents of the continued fraction 111 QlQ2Qi ' we must have Di_2.NNi_2.DQi .
It would not , however , be easy to perform the multiplications indicated in the above equation , so as to obtain Qi under its reduced form as a linear function of x. I proceed therefore to find Qi constructively in the following manner .
Let Ri_2 , Ri-1 , Ri be three consecutive residues , f'x counting as the residue in the zero place , then Qi= Ri_2and is of the form +P pt Now in general if we call the n roots of fx , where the coefficient of Xn is supposetl to be unity , h , h2 ... h. , and if we use Z to denote 2^(hol h52 ... ho0)* , with the convention that Zl=n , Z , = 1 , we have , employing ( i ) to denote I{ ( -l)+ 1 } , R ?

( e. ) If the process of obtaining the successive quotients and residues be considered , it will easily be seen that each step in the process imports two new coefficients into the quotients , the first quotient containing no literal quotient in the part mnultiplying x and containing the first literal coefficient in the other part , the second quotient containing two literal coefficients in the one part and three in the other , and in general the ith quotient containing 2i-2 of the letters in the one part and 2i-1 of them in the other .
Hence T , being made equal to Li.x+Mi , Li coutains 2i-2 and M , contains 2i--1 of the literal coefficients of fx .
Moreover , we have Pi-2--mPi Zi of the form T. Pi-pI , where Pi_-l , =-(ho , h2 ... ho , )o i , + rl , +2* *.n Pi-_2=Z(hol ho2 ... hoAle-_)s , i oi+..,0n , fand Pi , which is the ith simplified residue , vanishes when the n roots in any manner become reduced to only i distinct groups .

It will be observed that Ai , e is identical with what the simplified denominator of the ( iI)th convergent becomes when we write he in place of x , and consequently , when arranged according to the powers of he , will be of the form , .
hi-l + C2 hei-2 +. .
+ ci where c , , c , ... ci are functions of the coefficients , but containing no more of them than enters into Qji_ , i.e. containing only 2i-2 of them .
Now Ai is made up of terms , each consisting of some binary product of Cl , C2,.- .
Ci combined with some term of the series Zh2i-2 , h2i-3 ... h ?
; and any one of this latter set of terms expressed as a function of the coefficients of f contains at most 2i-2 of them .
Hence only 2i-2 of the coefficients enter into Ai , and in like manner only 2iof them into Bi .
The number of letters , therefore , in Ai and in Bi is the same as in Li and in Mi , viz. 2i-2 and 2i-1 respectively .
Now let the roots consist of only i distinct groups of equal roots , so that T , Pi-1 becomes -Z.p_ .

The cumulant corresponding to any Type remains unaffected by the order of the elements in the Type being reversed , as is evident from any cumulant being in fact lreprtesentable under the form of a symmretrical determinant , fx thus ex. gr. the cumulant [ q , q2 q3 q4 ] may be represented by the determinant ql 1001 q2 1001 q3 1001 q4 , and q4 q3q qq will in like manner be represented by the determinant q41 001 q3 1001 q2 1oo1 ql , which is equal to the former .

The urgency of the press precludes my investigating for the present the more general theorem which must be presumed to exist , whereby q+l can be connected with [ q lq2 q ... q ] , or [ g2q3q ... qi , and with [ q q2 q3..qi+ ] and [ q2 q3 ... q+l ] , when each ( q ) represents a function of an arbitrary degree in x.

SECTION IV .
On some further Formula ?
connected with M. STURM'S theorem , and on the Theory of Intercalations whereof that theorem may be treated as a corollary .
As preparatory to some remarks about to be made on the forme connected with M. STuRM 's theorem , it is necessary to premise two theorems concerning quadratic functions of great importance , one which , notwithstanding its extreme simplicity , is as far as I know very little ( if at all ) known , and the other was given in part many years ago by M. CAucwY , but is also not generally known .
The former of these years ago by M. CAUCH'V but is also not generally known .
The former of Athese two theorems is as follows .
If a quadratic homogeneous function of any number of variables he ( as it may be in an infinite variety of ways ) transformed into a function of a new set of variables , linearly connected by real coefficients with the original set , in such a way that only positive and negative squares of the new variables appear in the transformed expression , the number of such positive and negative squares respectively will be constant for a given function whatever be the linear transformations employed .
This evidently amounts to the proposition , that if we have 2n positive and negative squares of homogeneous real linear functions of n variables identically equal to zero , the number of positive squares and of negative squares must be equal to one another , so that ex. gr. we cannot have ?
{ U JU + &amp;c. ... .
+2 +U 1--u+2 Uf3 &amp;c. --U } identically zero when n of the variables are linear ftunctions of the remaining n ; and this is obviouslythe case , for if the equation could be identicallysatisfied we might make Un+2=ul U1n+3=U2 ... ... 'n UUn-l^ and we should then be able to find u+ , as a real numerical multiple of u , , and consequently should have the equation u2.{l-k"2}-0 , which is obviously impossible ; afortiori we may prove that in the identical equation existing between the sum of an even number of positive and of negative squares of real linear functions of half the number of independent variables , there cannot be more than a difference of two ( as we have proved that there cannot be that difference ) between the number of positive and negative squares .
Hence there must be as many of one as of the other ; and as a consequence , the number of positive squares or of negative squares in the transformi of a given quadratic function of any number of variables effected by any set of real linear substitutions is constant , being in fact some unknown transcendental function of the coefficients of the given function .
I quote this law ( which I have enunciated before , but of which I for the first time publish the proof ) under the name of the law of inertia for quadratic forms .
Art .
( 45 .
) .
The other theorem is the following .
If any quadratic function be represented in the umbral notation* under the form of ( a , xl+a , x2+ ... +a , xn)2 , where a , , a , ... an are the umbrae of the coefficients , and x1 , x2 ... x the variables , then by writing a , a , a , a1 a. +2+ a , a+aa++ a2 =y a , a2 aa , a4 a,. .

a , , aa2a , lan,12 a |I +I y2+ Y3+.+ In l a , al a , a2 a a. an-I aa , a2aa and consequently the number of positive squares in the reduced form of the given function will always be the number of continuations or permanencies of sign of the series al a , a2a al , a2 a3 aa ... a , al a2 al a2 a3 a a2 " .an the several terms of this progression being in fact the determinants of what the given function becomes when we obliterate successively all the variables but one , then all but that another , then all but these two and a third , until finally , the last term is the determinant of the given function with all the variables retained .
This comes to saying that if we call the function ( suppose of four variables ) f , and we write d2f d2f df d2f dlX dxl dx2 dxl dx3 dx1 d d2f d2f d2f d2f d2dx dx dx2d3x dx , dx4 d2f d2f d2f d2f d3 dxl dx3 dx2 dX8 dx , dx4 df d2f d2f d2f d4 d dx4 dX2 d4 dX3 dX2 ' ( where all the terms are of course coefficients of the given function expressed as above for greater symmetry of notation ) , the inertia of f will be measured by the number of continuations of sign in the series formed of the successive principal minor coaxal determinants ( in writing which I shall use in general ( r , s ) to denote d f ) r 1 , 2 I , 3 ( 1 , ) ( 1,2 ) ( 1 , 3 ) ( 1 4 ) in l ) ( l , 2 ) ] ' 21 2 , 2 2 , 3 ( 2,1 ) ( 2,2 ) ( 2,3 ) ( 2 4 ) l , ( 5 l)5 L(25 1 ) ( 2 , 2)_ 2 l3 , 2 3 , 3_ ( 3 , 1 ) ( 3 , 2 ) ( 3 , 3 ) ( 3 , 4 ) 3 , 1 3 , 2 3 , 3 ( 4,1 ) ( 4,2 ) ( 4,3 ) ( 4,4)j and in like manner in general* , Art .

Reverting now to the simplified Sturmnian residues , since by the theory set out in the first Section these differ from the unsimplified complete residues required by the Sturmian method only in the circumstance of their being divested of factors , which are necessarily perfect squares and therefore essentially positive , these simplified Sturmians may of course be substituted for the complete Sturmians for the purposes of M. STURM'S theorem .
The leading coefficients in these simplified Sturmians , reckoningf'(x ) as one of them , will be mZ(h , h , ) , 2E(h , h2 h3 ) ... ( hj h2 ... hm ) , which it is easily seen , as remarked long ago by Mr. CAYLEY , are the successive principal minor coaxal determinants of the matrix 0 , O1 , U2 , 03 's * m-r1 U1 , tr ) , t.3 *r*n*Tm_I t2r3 U3 .

I may add the important remark , which does not appear to have occurred immediately to my friend M. HERMIT when he communicated to me the above most interesting results , that in fact , by virtue of the law of inertia fot ' quadratic forms , we may dispense with any identification of the successive coaxal deteirmiinants of the matrix to the generating function { u+-hl+u2 .
+h..+..--.h+-l.u}2 g-~~~~~~ hm1 .
with my formulae for the Sturmian functions , and prove ab initio in the most simple manner , that the successive ascending coaxal determinants ( always of course supposed to be taken about the axis of symmetry ) of the matrix to the form above written , or to the more general form ( which I shall quote as G , viz. ) E(--h1 ) { pj.(h)u , + 2(h^)u2 ++ ... +.(m ... ..(h .
( G. ) ( where pi , P ... pm are absolutely arbitrary integral forms of function with real coefficients ) , will form a rhizoristic series in regard to fx ( i.e. a series , the difference between the number of the continuations of sign between the successive terms of which corresponding to two different values of g will determine the number of real roots of g lying between such two assumed values ) , provided only that q be an odd positive or negative integer .
Nothing can be easier than the demonstration , for whenever g is greater than any one of the real roots as ( hj ) 1st .
Any pair of imaginary roots will give rise to two terms of the form ( 1+mV/ -i)9.(v+w/ 1)2 and ( l-m/ l).(v-w/ _l)2 ; or more simply , ( L+ MV/ ) .
( v2+w2+2vwV/ I ) and ( LMV/ 1- ) .
( v2 2--2vwV ) , where v and w are real linear functions of ul , u , ... u , .
The sum of which couple will be 2 { L.(u --v2 ) 2Mw}= .
{ ( Lu-Mv ) 2-(L+ M2)v2 } =p2 q2 ; so that each such couple combined will for every value of x give rise to one positive and one negative square .
2ndly .
Any real root of the series h , h2 ... h , , when g is taken greater than such r oot , will give rise to a positive square of a real linear function of u , , u2 , ... un .
3rdly .
Any real root of the same series , when g is beneath it in value ( q being odd ) , will give rise to the negative of the square of a real linear function of the same .
Hence the number of real roots between g taken equal to one value ( a ) , and g taken equal to any other value ( b ) , will be denoted by the loss of an equal number of positive squares in the reduced form of the expression ( G. ) when g is taken ( a ) and when g is taken ( b ) ; i. e. by virtue of art .
( 45 .
) will be denoted by the difference of the number of permanencies of sign in the successive minor determinants of the matrix corresponding to the quadratic form ( G.)* ( which we have taken as ourl generating function ) resulting from the substitution respectively of a and b in place of g , which gives a theorem equivalent to that of M. STURM , transformed by my formulae , when we choose to adopt the particular suppositions q=---1 lIh= 1 p , h=h ~p3.h=h2 ... pmh=hm- ' .
This method of constructing a rhizoristic series tofx by a direct process is deserving of particular attention , because it does not involve the use of the notion of continuous variation , upon which all preceding proofs of STURM'S theorelm proceed .
It completes the cycle of the Sturmian ideas .
Happily this cycle was commenced from the other end , for it would have been difficult to have suspected that the root-expressions for the terms in the rhizoristic series could be identified with the residues , had the former been the first to be discovered , and much of the theory of algebraical common measurle laid open by means of this identification would probably have remained unknown .

I proceed now to consider a theorem concerning the relative positions of the real roots of two independent algebraical functions as indicated by the succession of signs presented by their Bezoutian secondaries ; this more general theory of intercalations or relative interpositions will be seen to include within it as a corollary the justly celebrated theorem of M. STURM .
Let the real roots offx taken in descending order of mragnitudes be h , h2 ... h , , and the real roots of &lt; x taken in the like order 1 , 2 ... fq , so that fx= ( xhl ) ( x h2). .
( x-hp)H pX= ( X 1^ ) ( X 2 ) ... ( .
) K , H and K being functions of x incapable of changing their signs .
Now , as in ( X ) M. STURM'S method , let us inquire what takes place in respect to the sign of f(x ) which I shall call the Indicatrix , as x descends the scale of real magnitude from + oo to --o .
If between +co and h , , i real roots of ?
x are contained , it is obvious that as x travels from +00oo to the superior brink of hl , , the Indicatrix will change its sign from + to and from to + altogether i times , so that at the morment when x is about to pass through h , , it will be positive if i is zero or even , and negative if i is odd ; but the moment after x has passed through the value h , , the indicatrix will be negative on the first supposition , and positive on the other supposition .
Hence immediately after the passage of x through hI the indicatrix will have been once oftener negative than positive on the one supposition , and as often negative as positive on the other .
Again , in like manner as x traverses the interval between h , and the inferior brink of h , , if no v or an even number of 's occupy this interval , the sign which the Indicatrix had at the beginning of this interval will have been reversed once oftener than restored ; but if there be an odd number of k 's so interposed , the number of reversals and restorations will have been identical ; and so for each successive interval , reckoned from a value for x immediately subsequent to one real root offx , down to a value immediately subsequent to the next less real root of the 486 same ; and it is evident that the effect upon the sign of the Indicatrix at the end of every such interval depends , not upon the number of ?
's grouped together in such interval , but upon the form of the group as regards its being made up of an odd or even number of terms [ the first interval will of course be understood to extend from +00 to a value immediately inferior to hl , and the last from a value immediately inferior to hp to -oo ] .
Hence as regards the relation of the signs of the Indicatrix at the beginning to the sign at the end of every such interval , nothing will be altered by taking away any even number of r 's that may be found therein .
If we suppose this to be done , we shall then have in some of the intervals one n occurring and in the other intervals no n ; that is to say , some of the h 's will be separated by single n 's , but other h 's will come together .
Again , by removing any even number of h 's not separated by 's ( and thus removing an even number of intervals ) , it-is clear that as many changes of sign of the Indicatrix will have been done away with from + to as from to + , and no effect upon the excess of the one kind of changes of sign over the other kind of changes of sign will have been produced .
By removing pairs of h 's in this manner , it may happen that n 's will again be brought together , any even number of which , not separated by h 's , may again be removed and then pairs of h 's not separated by ?
's in their turn , and so continually toties quoties until at length we imfust arrive at a reduced system of h 's and n 's , where no two h 's and no two n 's come together , or else all the h 's and all the n 's will have disappeared .
Let the scale of h 's and n 's thus simplified and reduced be called the effective scale of intercalations .
The number of h 's and the number of n 's in any such scale will be equal , or will at most differ from one another by a unit , since at each part of the scale , except at the end , every h is followed by an n and every n by an h. If the scale begins and ends with an h , there will of course be one more h than n ; if it begin and end with an n , there will be one more n than h ; if it begin with an h or an n and end with an n or h , there will be as many of the one as of the other .
1st .
Suppose the effective intercalation scale to commence with an h ; then in passing from + oo to just beyond the first h the sign of the indicatrix.x changes from + to - ; fx it changes again from to + as it passes the first n , then again from + to as it passes the second h , and so on ; that is to say , there will be a change always in the same direction from + to as x passes , from being just greater than to being just less than any h appearing in the effective scale .
2nd .
If the effective scale begin with n , the indicatrix will conversely be negative after passing the first and every subsequent n , and change from to + in the act of passing through the first and every subsequent h. So that on either supposition the changes of sign for the effective scale always take place in the same direction , and the number of h 's in the effective scale will be measured by the number of such changes , and consequently will be measured by the difference between the number of times that the indicatrix Lchanges its sign from + to as x.passes through each in turn of the real roots offx , and the number of times that in passing through any such root it changes its sign from to + ; if the former number be greater than the latter , the effective scale of interpositions will begin with a root offx ; if it be less , the scale will begin with a root of px .
If instead of beginning with +oo and ending with -oo we begin and end with any two limits , a and b respectively ( making abstraction of all roots offx or of px lying outside these limits , and forming the effective intercalation scale with the roots corn prised within these limits exclusively ) , we shall obviously obtain a similar result , but with the condition that the changes from + to will be in excess if an even number of h 's and n 's combined be cut off by the superior limit , and the effective scale begin with an h , or if an odd number of h 's and 7 's combined be so cut off and the scale begin with an i ; and in defect if an odd number of h 's and n 's combined be so cut off and the scale begin with an h , or an even number be so cut off and the scale begin with an v. If , now , supposingfx to be of n , and px of not more than n , say ( m ) dimensions , we form the signaletic series fx , &lt; x , B1 , B2 , ... Bm ( where the B , , B2 , ... Bm are the Bezoutian secondaries or simplified successive residues corresponding to -f expanded under the form of an improper continued fraction ) , it may be shown , in the same way as for STuRM'S theorem , that whenever changes from 4to a change of sign will be gained in the series , and when from to +a change will be lost ; and that no change can be gained or lost except as x passes through the successive real roots offx .
Hence the difference between the number of changes of sign in the above signaletic series when x is taken ( a ) , and the number of the same when x is taken ( b ) , will indicate the number of roots of fx remaining in the effective scale of interpositions formed between such of the roots offx and of px as lie between ( a ) and ( b ) ; calling the one nulmber I(a ) and the other I(b ) , the sign of I(b ) ( a ) depends not on the relative magnitudes of ( a ) and ( b ) , but upon the manner in which the effective scale commences ; if I(a)-I(b ) is positive , the effective scale formed between the ( a ) and ( b ) will commence with a root offx ; if negative , it will commence with a root of p(x ) .

( 49 .

In forming the scale of effective interpositions , it is evidently not necessary to go on reducing the ( h ) series and the n series separately and alternately ; the same result will be effected more expeditiously by eliding simultaneously any even number of h 's that come together without being separated by an ( , and any even nutmber of 4 's that come together without being separated by an ( h ) , and , repeating this process of simultaneous elision , as often as may be required , until no two h 's or y 's come together .
Thus , for instance , denoting the magnitudes of the series of real roots off and of p by the distances of h and n points taken along a right line from a fixed point therein , and supposing such series of roots between the litnits a and b to be hh hrn hrv hv nrh hi h , hh hh h h , our first reduction brings this scale to the form hhhh hh ; A the next reduction brings it to the form h nl hn ; 488 and a third and final reduction brings it to the form and accordingly we shall find for such an arrangement of the h and ti system I(b)-I(a)=+2 .

If we suppose px-= -d , by a well-known theorem of algebra , any two consecutive roots of fx will contain between them an odd number of roots of px , and the number of real roots of f'x greater than the greatest root of fx , and the number of real roots of f'x less than the least root of fx will each be even .
Hence the effective intercalation scale between any two limits ( a ) and ( b ) will be formed by merely reducing the n groups to single units , and the number of h 's in the scale so formed will be the total number of h 's between the limits ( a ) and ( b ) .
Moreover , since such scale commences always with a root offx , or with an even number of roots offx followed by a root offx , if the number of h 's and a 's cut off be even , and with a root offx or an even number of roots offx/ followed by a root offx , if the number so cut off be odd , it follows that for this case I(a ) -I(b ) , ( a ) being the superior limit , will be always positive , and will measure the total number of real roots off(x ) lying between ( a ) and ( b ) ; this , then , is STURM'S theorem , treated as a corollary to the Theory of Intercalations .

If we write down the last syzygetic equation between fx of m and p(x ) of n dimensions , viz. _r-1 ( x)f(x ) -t_lI(x)x+S == it has been shown that the succession of signs in the series formed with fx , px and their successive Bezoutian secondaries will contain the same number of continuations and variations as the series formed with f(x ) , tm-i(x ) , and their successive Bezoutian secondaries .
This indicates that the effective scale of interpositions for fx and px will contain an equal number of roots offx with the effective scale forfx and tm_-(x ) the two scales however will not necessarily be identical , because the roots of $x will not necessarily be in the same order relative to the h 's in the one scale as those of t , _,.x relative to the h 's in the other scale .
This equality is perfectly well explained a posteriori by the form of t,.^ , which by the formula in Section II .
will be represented by ( ( xhj(x -h , ). .
( x-h .
Ahq p^n Now , whenever x is indefinitely near to any one of the roots of fx , as hq , X this sumI reduces to the simple expression ^hq phq , ... , m ={ h.h2h,. .
ph } , and consequently in the immediate neighbourhood of every real root of fx , Q(x ) and tm_.x will have always the same or always a contrary sign , according as pq.phq,.h ... hq , m is positive or negative , which will depend upon the relative disposition of the real roots inf and p ; in either case the effective scale of interpositions forfx with px and 3s2 489 forfx with tm , ,.x must contain the same number of h 's ; but the difference will be , that if ph , l.phk2 ... phr is positive an h will occupy the first place in each scale , or the second place in each scale ; but if negative , then in one scale an ( h ) will occupy the first place , and in the other scale the second place .

The same process of common measure or residues which serves to furnish a rhizoristic series for f(x ) or a synrhizoristic series for fx and px , will serve also to furnish superior and inferior limits to the real roots of any proposed equation .
Thus suppose fx to be any rational integral ftnction of ( x ) of the degree ( rn ) and p(x ) any other function of x , which I shall begin with supposing to be of the degree ( n-1 ) , and let the successive quotients resulting from the process of finding the greatest common measure offx , px continued until the last remainder is not a constant but zero , be supposed to be ( as they may generally be taken , but subject to cases of exception , which will hereafter be alluded to ) n linear functions q , q2 ... q , , then we shall have x__ 1111 fx -ql+ 2+ " 'qn-+ q , and therefore px--K.N fx=K.D , where N is the numerator and D the denominator of the fraction 111 ql + q2 + " q and K is a constant ( the value of which is immaterial to be considered , but in fact equals L2 L2 .
L &amp; c , L1 L3 L5 LO , LI , L2 , L , , &amp;c. being the leading coefficients of the last , the last but one , the last but two , &amp;c. of the Bezoutian secondaries tofx and px ) .
Accordingly , if n=l , let D=q , l = , ; if n=2 , let D=q2 q , +l 1 =pq2+ p. ; if n=3 , let D=q3{qs q , l+1 } + ==q , = p2 + q+ ; and in general let D=--l.P2-.P3 ... .

Then p , is positively or negatively greater than 1 , therefore is a positive or negative fraction , but qy is positively or negatively greater than 2 ; therefore p will be of the same sign in q2 , and also p2 will be positively or negatively greater than 1 ; therefore will be a positive or negative fraction , but q3 is positively or negatively greater than 2 ; therefore 3 will be of the same sign as q3 and also p , will be positively or negatively greater than 1 ; and proceeding in this way , we find that all values of p , , from i= l to i=n1 , will be of the same sign as qi , and positively or negatively greater than 1 .
Finally , iwill be a fraction , and therefore , since q , is positively or negatively greater than 1 , I_=q4 , + will have the same sign as ( q , ) ( but of course is not necessarily greater than 1 , nor would that condition serve any purpose were it satisfied ) .
We infer consequently , that when the conditions ( 0 ) are satisfied , p I , P25 P3 , ... n will respectively have the same signs as q , q2 ... qn ; and therefore D==pliP2,.23 ... .* , has the same sign as q,.q2.q3 ... q. .
Now suppose ql=alx+b , q2=a2.x+b2 ... q=an.x+bn , and solve the 2n equations alx+bl=+c , a2-+b^=+c2 ... a , _.x+b^_-= c , na,.x+b , = c , alx+bl=c1 aX+ b2=--C2 ... a , _j.x+-b+_ , c-c , a , ,.x b , = -ca , where c , =1 c , =2 c , =2 ... ... ... c_-1=2 c , ==l .
Whenever in any one of the n pairs of equations above written the coefficient of x is positive , the upper equation of the pair will bring out the greater value of X ; but when the coefficient is negative the lower equation will give the greater value .
Take the pair ai.+b , =ci aix+ bi= ci ; If ai is positive aix+bi will always be positive , and greater than ci between x=co and x= the greater of the two values of x ; if a , is negative aix+ b , will always be negative , and less ( i. e. nearer to -oo ) than --ci for all values of x between the same limits as before .
So again it will be seen in like manner , that whether a , be positive or negative between x= -o and x= the lesser of the two values of x corresponding to the above pair of equations , ax+6b will always retain the same sign , and will be greater than + ci , or less than c , , according as a , is negative or positive .
If , then , we take the greatest of the greaters of the n pairs of values of x , i. e. the absolute greatest of the 2n values , and the least of the lessers , i. e. the absolute least of the same , say L and A between L and A , q , , q2 ... % will each always retain an invariable sign , and will then fall without the limits +cl +c , ... ... .

It will of course be observed that it is indifferent for the purposes of the foregoing theorem , whether be expanded under the form of a proper or an improper fraction , i. e. whether we employ the ordinary or the Sturmian process of successive division , for changing the signs of the residues will only have the effect of changing q , into ( +)qy , and the pair of equations ( ?

Let us now assume somewhat more generally that px is any number of degrees 06 in x lower than fx , which will cause the first quotient ql , to be of the degree 0 , in x ; and let us further suppose that px stands in such a relation tofx that the following quotients , qo2 , qo , ... qop , are of the degrees 02 , 03 ... 0p in x ( 02 , 03 ... 0Y being supposed not necessarily units , as they would generally be , but any positive integers whatever , as may happen in consequence of one or more of the leading coefficients in any residue vanishing ) , then.x_ l111 fx qo1+ qo2e+ qo3 + qop where,1+02+03+ ... dp=n , and consequently fx will be equal to the denominator of the last convergent above written , multiplied by a constant , so that we have now c.fx=mn.m2 ... .M , where m , = qo m2 , -q= 2+..m.mp=qop+ mp_ nd as in the case previously considered , so long as &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 qol or qo or qo3 or ... qo or &lt; --1 &lt; -2 &lt; 2 &lt; -1 fx will have the same sign as qo1.q2.**.qp .
Let now qo , = ?
c , qo =+-c ... qop=+c , where c= 1 c2=2 ... cp_1=2 c=-1 .
Consider any pair of the above equations as q--c=-O .
1st .
Suppose all the roots of this equation are impossible , q-i-cd must be positive for all values of x , and qo~ can never lie between +ci and -ci ; moreover , since upon the hypothesis made , qoi+-c and qo--c always retain the same sign , viz. that of the coefficient of the highest power of q , , it follows that q0 , must also always retain the same sign ; for if we construct the two curves y , =qo.+ci and dy=-q-ci , these will both lie on the same side of the axis of x , and never cut the axis , consequently the curve y=q , , which lies between them , must also lie on the same side as either of them , and never cut the axis .
Hence , then , if the roots of the equation are all impossible , qv will always retain the same sign , and will never fall within the region bounded on its two sides by +ci and -ci .
2nd .
Suppose the equation to have one or more possible roots , and i , to the greatest , and Xi the least ( which of course , if there is but one possible root , will be identical ) .
If the leading coefficient of qi is positive , the greatest root ( I ) of the equation qi-c=0 will exceed the greatest root of ( 1 ' ) of the equation qoi+ci=0 ; for between x =0c and x= ' , q , , must go through all values intermediate between co and -ci ; hence there must be a qualitylintermediate between 1 ' and +oo , which will make q , ,=cj .
In like manner , if the leading coefficient of qoi is negative , it will be seen that the greatest root of qo , +c , =O will exceed that of qo--c=-O .
Moreover , in the one case q , will be always positive and greater than ci , and in the other always negative , and less than ct .
In every case , therefore , between +oo and li , qoi retains the same sign , and does not fall within the region bounded by +ci and -ci ; the same thing may be shown to be true for all values of x between -oo and X , .
Hence , then , by the same reasoning as that employed in the preceding article , we are enabled to affirm , that if we form the equation ( q~-l )(ql2-4)(q3--4 ) ... ( q_-4)(q-1)0 , ... ... ( , .
) its greatest root will be a superior limit , and its least root an inferior limit to the roots of the equation f=0 , whatever be the value of the assumed function px ; and if the above equation ( 4 .
) has no real root , all the roots offx will be imaginary .

In the preceding two articles it has been supposed that all the quotients are taken integral functions of x ; but the process of successive division may be so conducted as to give rise to quotients of the form dI axI+bx'-+ ... +c+-+ + ... +l .
Suppose then that we have in general aX 111 fxq + q2 + ' " where q , , q2 , ... q , are each of the general form above written ( but of course i and i ' being not necessarily the same for any two of the quotients ) , and suppose that the sum of the degrees in x of q1 , q2 , ... q , is n+t , where t is essentially ( as it must be ) positive .
Then we shall find , as in the last article , that L and A being called the greatest and least roots of ( q-1)(q2-4 ) ... ( q_ --4)(q-1 ) , D the denominator of the last convergent to the continued fraction above written , will never change its sign between + oo and L , nor between A and -o ; but here we shall have fx=KxtxD .
Hence xt .
D will be invariable in sign within each of these two intervals .
1st .
Let t be even ; then f(x ) will be invariable in sign , whatever L and A may be for each such interval .
2nd .
Let t be odd ; then if L is &gt; 0 and A &lt; O , f(x ) cannot change its sign in either interval ; but if L is &lt; 0 or A &gt; 0 , fx will change its sign as x passes through zero , but will be invariable for each of the three regions contained between +co and L , L and 0 , or 0 and A ( as the case may be ) , and A and oo ; so that universally L and A will be a superior and inferior limit to the roots offx , making abstraction of the roots ( if any such there be in fx ) whose value is zero .

I shall close this section with offering ( for what it is worth ) a bare 494 suggestion as to the mode in which the theory of Intercalations may hereafter be found to admit of being extended from a system of two general functions of V. , to a system of three general functions of x , y , four general functions of x , y , z , and in general to a system of ?
general functions of ?
1 variables , or which is the same thing , of s homogeneous functions of s variables .
In the case of two functions of x , f(x ) and px , fx=O and r , v=O may be considered to represent two systems of points in a right line ; and the theory relates in this case to the relative positions of these two " Kenothernes " or point systems ; and of course using x and y to denote the distances of any point in a line from two fixed points therein respectively , instead of fv and px , we may emnploy two homogeneous fulnctions of x and y , as f(x , y ) and p ( x , y ) , to denote these two systems of points .
So , similarly , if we have three functions of two variables , f(x , y ) , g(x , y ) , h(x , y ) , which I shall suppose to be of the same degree , we may consider the niutual relations of the Monothemes , that is to say , the thrbee plane curves , denoted by the equations f(x , y)=O , g(x , y)=O , h(x , y)=O .
Now every two of these will intersect one another in a system of points , which we may call ( f , g ) for the intersections off and g , ( g , h ) for those of ( g and h ) , and ( h , f ) for those of h and f. If we take any two of these systems of intersections , as ( / f g ) and ( g , h ) , they will both lie upon one of the given curves ( g ) .
And by reading off the two systems of points ( f , g ) and ( g , h ) , arranged according to the order upon which they are disposed upon the curve g , we may , by following the course of such curve , form a scale of effective intercalations for these two systems , and in like manner for the two systems ( g , h ) and ( h , f ) ; ( h , f ) and ( f , g ) .
Now I believe that it will be found that when f , g , h represent any algebraical curves consisting of a single continuous line , either extending to infinity in both directions , or returning to itself ( and I have fully satisfied myself of the truth of this for the case of ellipses ) , each effective scale of intercalation will contain the same number of pairs of points ; if , however , the curves consist of more than one branch , as if hyperbolae be considered , such is no longer necessarily the case ; from these facts , conjoined with the light thrown upon the subject by its relation to the theory of combinants explained in the succeeding section , I am induced to infer the probability of the truth of the following law ( which , for avoidance of further uncertainty , I confine to the case of functions of the same degriee ) , viz. that if f , g , h be three homogeneous functions of x , y , and z of the same degree , and if U , V , W be any three linear functions off , g , h , and if IJU==O , V=O , W=O0 be treated as the equations to three cones , and if we form an effective scale of the intercalations of the lines of intersection of U and W , and V and W , according to the order in which they are disposed upon W ( which seenis to require that the lines shall be continuous , in order to admit of a fixed order of reading off the intersections of any two of them upon the third ) ; then whatever value may have been given to the coefficients in the linear functions the number of elements remaining in any such scale will ( as I conjecture ) be constant , and some theory ( to be discovered ) for three functions analogous to that of Bezoutian residues for two functions will serve to determine the number of the elements so remaining .
And so , in like manner , but with a difficulty increasing at each step ( as at the next step we should have to pass into quasi-space of four dimensions ) , a theory of intercalations may be conjectured to exist for any ( n ) general functions of any ( n1 ) variables .
Development of the method of assigning a superior and inferior limit to the roots of any algebraical equation .
Art .
( ac .
) .
Since the articles in the preceding part of this section on the method of discovering limits to the roots of an algebraical equation were written , the method of which the germ is therein contained has presented itself in a much more fully developed form , which I proceed to exhibit : for greater simplicity I shall suppose ( x to be of n1 , and fx to be of n dimensions in x , and that by means of the ordinary process for coimmon measure ( except that as in STURM'S theorem the sign of all the remainders are changed ) T has been thrown under the form of the improper continued fraction 1111 ql-q,2q-'of ' where q , q2 ... qn are all restricted to signify simple linear functions of x. Suppose the series ql , q2 , q3 , ... q to be resolved into the distinct sequences q , q2 ... qi ; qi+1 q+2..qi , ; qi+l'. .
qi ... qi)+l ... .
in such a manner that in each sequence as q , i+ qi+2 ... qi , the coefficients of x have all the same sign , but that in any two adjoining sequences the coefficients of x have opposite signs , so that for instance in qi and q , i the coefficients of x are unlike , as also in qi , and q , + , ; there will of course be nothing to preclude any of these sequences becoming reduced to a single term .
The first theorem is , that the greatest and least roots of the product of the cumulants C[q ql2-q..q]X [ qi+l q+2 ... qit ] ... X [ ( i+l q()+2 ... , n ] are superior and inferior limits to the roots of fx .
To prove this theorem I begin with premising the two following lemmas , one virtually and the other expressly contained in the Philosophical Magazine for the months of September and October of the present year* .
Lemma A. The roots of the cumulant [ q1 , q2 ... q ] , in which each element is a linear function of x , and wherein the coefficient of x for each element has the like sign , are all real , and between every two of such roots is contained a root of the cumulant [ ql q2 ... qi , and ex converse a root of the cumulant [ q2 q3 ... q ] , and ( as an evident corollary ) for all values of g and o ' intermediate between 1 and i the greatest root of [ ql q9 ... qi-1qi ] will be greater , and the least root of the same will be less than the greatest and least roots respectively of [ qp qp , + ... qp , _ , g , ] .
Lemma B. For all values of the elements q q2 ... q , , the cumulant [ qlq2-*.** -l _oq +l qo , +2. .
qnl = [ ql q2 *. .
*qqq ] X [ q , + q , +2 * *.q ] [ 4q* evidently apply if we had supposed the signs of the coefficients of x in the first partial series of elements to have been negative , and in the other series of elements to have been positive .
The greatest and least roots of [ q q2 **.q , ] X [ qg+1 ... qu ] evidently satisfy the condition to which L and A are subject , and may be taken in place of L and A respectively .
They will accordingly be superior and inferior limits to the cumulant [ q1 2 q , ' Xq+1* ... q ] Again , by virtue of theorem ( B. ) it may readily be shown that [ ql q21.q , * ql q , ++2** q2+ ... +1 *** q ] -[ql ?

qx l ] X [ q,1+1 ql+2* ... q2 ] X [ q2+1 ... q. ] -E[q q2*. .
ql ] [ q+l-2-q ... o ] X [ qo2+1-*y q+ [ q1 q2 ... q.l1 ] X [ ql+2 ... 2 -2-1 ] X [ q,2+2..qn ] ; and hence if q , q2 ... q are all linear functions of x in which the coefficients of x have all the same algebraical sign in any one ( taken per se ) of the three series qi qs2-- .
, 1 ; ql + - ... q ; q+ ... q$ ; but so that this sign changes in passing from one series to another , it is easily seen , by the same reasoning as in the preceding case , that the two positive and two negative products on the right-hand side of the equation all give the same sign to the coefficient of the highest power of x , and consequently that if L and A be superior and inferior limits to [ ql ' * qfj [ qw , + 1q,2 ] [ q qn ] X and consequently by Lemma A , to [ q1 q"2'qo-1 ] , [ ql+2 ' *"qJ ] , [ qi+l--.qf2-j ] , [ qw+2 ... qo2-1 ] , and to [ q,2+2 ... q ] , L or A substituted for x will cause [ q1 q2 ... qn ] to retain always the same sign , and will consequently be superior and inferior limits thereto ; and so in general ; whence it follows , returning to the theorem to be demonstrated , that the greatest and least roots of [ qI q2-..qZ ] X [ q+l qi+2 ... q ] *. .
x [ q.+I..q .
] , will be superior and inferior limits to the cumulant [ ql q2 ... q ] , i. e. to C.fx* , and therefore tofx , as was to be proved .
Art .
( y. ) .
The second theorem is the following : if q q2 , ... q , be linear functions of x , say alx+b , , ax+b2b ... ax-+b , in which the coefficients of x have all the same sign , and if we take the quantities 1 , , *.*n-15 all having the same sign as al a , ... , but otherwise arbitrary , and make k1=M , k , =p , +k=3 P3+k-k+-l==+ =1 2i Pe 3-dg F* * So that [ qi q2 ... q ] for all values of x less than A will preserve an invariable sign , and consequently A is an inferior limit tofx .
Art .
( a. ) .
It may be remarked that the quantities P ; +2- ; 1'-+F 1 may be derived successively from one another , according to the same law , from whichever end of the series we begin .
If we take any two consecutive terms as II the e fact of diminishing pi is to decrease the first of these two terms , and pro tanto , to tend to deduce the limit ; but on the other hand , being increased , there is brought into play an opposite tendency , which operates pro tanto to increase the value of the limit .
Art .
( s. ) .
It is of importance to remark , that by a right selection of the system of quantities p , 2- ... p- , , which enter into the composition of k , k2 ... k , , L may be made to coincide with the greatest root of [ q9 q2..f.q ; and so in like manner by a right selection of another system of these quantities , whereby to form k , k2 ... k , , A may be made to coincide with the least root of the same .
Thus let ?
F ... ._be so chosen , that 1--k=0 q2-k2=0- ... q-k=O are all satisfied by the same value of x. I1 Then q=pl q-=p2+ q3= +1 qn=_ exist simultaneously .
11 11 Hence -2 =2 -33-=q3-- , -------3 ^-_ q1 11 ^-qqn-2q -c l11 ' q"-l-q- , -q~2--2'"qwhich is satisfied by making [ q , ) q _ , , n-a2.-* ] =0 .
It remains then only to show that the greatest root of x in this equation substituted for x in qi , 9 ?
2 , Consequently this superior limit will make 1i , ... .nhave all the same sign as that of the coefficients of x in q , , q , ... q , .
And in like manner , the inferior limit to [ ql , q2 , ... qn ] will cause P4l , p2* ... P_-I to have all the contrary sign to that of these coefficients .
fxThus then we see that when the coefficients of a in the partial quotients to n expressed as an improper continued fraction form a single series of continuations of signs , by a right choice of the arbitrary constants pi , P2,..Ftb_ the superior or inferior limit given by this new method may severally and separately be made to coincide with the greatest and least real root , or each in turn with the sole real root offx , if there he but one .
Art .
( g. ) .
The general method of enclosing the roots offx within limits is founded upon the combination of the two theorems above demonstrated .
An arbitrary function px one degree in x below , fx being assumed , and by aid of the auxiliary function px , fx being thrown under the form C[q , , q2,..qi ql , q2 , *.q auxiliary constants , this coincidence may be brought about , so long as there is a single real root infx .
It is rather important to demonstrate this universal possibility of effecting a coincidlence of the limits to the roots with the extreme roots themselves , because it is the most striking feature which distinguishes the method of limitation here developed from all others previously brought to light .
Art .
( O. ) .
Before entering upon this demonstration I may make the passing remark , that every method of root-limitation is implicitly a method of root-approximation .
For instance , let e be any given quantity between which and +oo it is known that a root of fx lies .
Then if we write x=e+-y , and form the equatioyn y ( e+-)=0 , y and( find La superior limit to y , it is clear that e+E will lie between e and the root I1 offx say E , next superior to e. Again , making x=e+L+R , and finding a superior 11 1 limit L ' to y ' , we shall have e+l + , still nearer to E than e+L was ; and so we may proceed advancing nearer and nearer , and always from the same side towards E at E11 1 each step , and finally obtain E under the form e+L , + - , L + &amp;c. And in like manner calling E , the root next below e , we may find E , e-x , -A , &amp;c. Art .

In establishing the theorem of coincidence above adverted to , the following notation will be found very advantageous .
Let Q denote a Type of any number of Elements , as q1 qa ... qi-l qi , and let O ' denote this same type when the last element , and 'O the same type wheil the first element is cut off , and 'Q ' the same type when both extremes are cut off , so that the apocopated type Q ' will mean [ q1 q2 ... qi- , ] ; the apocopated type 'Q will mean [ q , q3 ... qJ , and the doubly apocopated type'Q ' will mean [ q2 *q ... q-1 ] .
If now a type Q be made up of the types O , Q2 ... Q , put in apposition , and if we use in general [ Q ] to denote the cumulant corresponding to the type 0 , there will be a very simple law* connecting [ Q ] with [ Q , ] [ Q2 ] [ 03 ] ... [ Qi-2 ] [ -1 ] [ Q ] [ [ Q ' ] [ '3 ] ... [ Q'l2 [ '-1 ] .
[ 02 ] UQ3 ] [ Qi-I ' * i-1[ li-']['QJ [ Q0 [ Q03]. .

In every one of the above groups forming a product the accents enter in pairs and between contiguous factors , it being a condition that if any Q have an accent on the right the next Q must have one on the left , and if it have one on the left the preceding Q must have an accent on the right , and the number of pairs of accents goes on increasing in each group from 0 to i-1 .
This rule serves completely to define the development in question+ .
For greater brevity let [ Qj [ o2 ] 'Qe ] [ Qe ] be denoted respectively by we , 'e , , , ; , then when the type tQ consists of a single element , =-1 J -==1 '^-=0 .
It should be observed that the two equations oe=0 -oi=0 cannot exist simultaneously , for if 2Q represent qlq2 ... qi we qi-eJe We= qilW'e ' &amp; eC .
so that if oe-=O and e=0 , = we have w-=0 , wi'=0 , &amp;c. , and thus , finally , 1=0 , which is absurd .
Now , if we suppose 1 Q2 ... e to be types every element in each of which is a linear function of x , the coefficients of x in these elements being positive in Q , , negative in Q2 , and so on alternately , and Q is the aggregate of Q ... Q , it may easily be made out that each term in the development of w in terms of w % , wo , 'wI , 'W ; w02,2 , 2 , 'i z ; &amp;c. will have the same sign when we give to xa value which is a superior limit , or an inferior limit to the roots of each of the cumulants w , i w^2 ... we , and consequently to those of the cumulants w1 , 5 , ... o2 ; so , ,5 '2 , ...

Thus , ex. gr. if Q=-Q20 W=I--o.1.tW'-*z2 and the sign of the leading coefficient in '2 will be the contrary of that in W2 , but w , and w , have both the same positive sign ; so again if Q=Q1Q2Q , , XO=--i.f o2.Jza3- .

But the superior limit to the roots of any integral algebraical function of x substituted in place of x causes the signs of the resulting values of the functions to coincide with the signs of the leading coefficients , so that in the example last above given , La superior limit to all the factors in the several products in the equation substituted for x will make w,.2.w , , -wI .

The like will be true of A the inferior limit ; for if Q2 , Q2 , Q3 contain respectively n , , n , , n elements , the values of the four products last above written , when x=oo , will be to the values of the same when x= + co in the respective ratios of ( )M++M3 , 1 ( _ ) 1+m2+m3+3-2.1 ( )l+2+-2 .

Hence we deduce the theorem , that if the total type 0 represent the aggregate in apposition of the partial orders Q12- ... Q , ( the elements being understood to be linear functions of x , which are subject to the law of alternation in the signs of the coefficients of x in passing from one partial type to another ) , no superior limit to w , w,2 , ... w , can Inake w vanish unless each separate product in the expansion of w in terms of w,1 w,..ae and the appurtenant apocopated cumulants vanish separately .

From the above theorem we may deduce the following law , viz. that if the roots of w , , ?
2 ... w , be supposed to be arranged in order of magnitude , and X to be that one of them which is nearest to + oo or to oo , then if e is even it is impossible for x to be a root of w. Thus suppose e=2 , and consequently wa=-.aw2-w.'a2 ; if X be a root of w , and one of the two extremes of the roots of aw ' , a2 put in order of magnitude , X cannot be a root of 'a2 , for the roots of w,2 are confined between the roots of w,2 ; but if X make a and a ' , each vanish , we must have aV.'O2-0 , hence w'==0 as well as w1=0O , which is impossible .
In like manner if a root of wo2 were the extreme root , the same impossibility could be in like manner established .

-**2 ' 'I3 * 4= Since w , and -X1 cannot both be zero together , x cannot make w1 or 'w , zero ; and because x is an extreme to the roots of a2 , 35 , i , , X cannot make wa ' or '2 or a3 or I3 or &amp; 4 or 'a4 zero , so that in fact when x=x none of the singly accented quantities a can be zero .
As regards the doubly accented quantities w , the same thing cannot be affirmed , because if any Q contains only one element the corresponding value of w with a double accent vanishes spontaneously .
Again , any of the unaccented quantities w may vanish , because we may suppose any of these to have an extreme root A. Consequently the first , second and fourth of the equations remaining to be satisfied , might be satisfied on making the necessary suppositions as to the form of the quantities w and the values of the extreme roots ; but the third remaining equation 1.a'2.a3..'O=0 , in which only singly accented quantities w occur , remains incapable of being satisfied on any supposition whatever .
And the same thing would be true if we suppose X to be a root of any other w instead of w , .
Hence X cannot make w=0 when e=4 .
In like manner , if e be any even number 2s , there will be an equation w1. .

Consequently , unless px is so assumed that the number of changes of sign in the coefficients of x in the quotients resulting from expanded as an improper continued fraction is even ( for if the changes from sequence to sequence are odd the number of sequences themselves is even ) , the method of limitation in the text cannot give the means of drawing either limit indefinitely near to one or the other extreme roots offx .
Art .

It now remains to prove the converse , and to show , 1st , that when the number of changes is even , i. e. the number of sequences odd , this coincidence can always be effected ; and 2ndly , that it is always possible when f has one or more real roots , so to assume px that the number of sequences shall be odd .
The first part of the proposition is easily proved .

If we suppose X either extreme of the scale formed by writing in order of magnitude , the roots of c , , w2 , 03 to be a root common to w , and to 03 and if w2=O0 , which last equation may be satisfied by supposing the type Q2 to consist of a single element , the separate equations W10.0 2,3=0 o*2.3 =0 l.1 -4^'30 t.,30.-2 %=0 will all be satisfied ; and so in general it may be shown without difficulty that if e-2s+ 1 , and if X be a root common to w1O=0 3=0 o =--O..o1 , --=0 , and if w , o , ... O,2 be all simple linear unctions of x , so that consequently w2=0 '=0 ... ^6=0 each separate term in the development of w will vanish singly and separately , and consequently X will be a root of ws : for since X makes W , =0 , =0 ... 2 , +i , =0 , every product in the developed form o , in which o , , 3 , ... 2 , , , + do not each bear at least one accent , will vanish ; and if we consider any product in which wo , 03 ... ,2s+i are all accented , if in any two of these immediately following one after the other as 2k-1 , W2k+ , , an accent falls to the right of the first , and to the left of the second , the intervening term w , k will bear a double accent , and will therefore vanish , since f2k is supposed to be a linear function of x ; but it is impossible when every w is accented to prevent two accents of contiguous odd terms in any such product , from falling to the right of the left , and to the left of the right , term of the two , since the contrary would imply that all the accents would fall to the right , or all to the left , which , as above remarked , is impossible , on accoun of the two extreme terms being only simply accentable , i. e. o , only to the right , and w , +1 only to the left .
Hence , when x substituted for A makes co , 02.2+ +1all vanish , and when 2 , , w ... w , , are all linear functions of x , x=X will be a root of w. Art .
( v. ) .
I believe that the remaining part of the proposition may be rigorously demonstrated , viz. that when any of the roots offx are real , and the number of odd integers not exceeding the index of the degree offxt is m , and the number of imaginary pairs of roots infx is p , px may be so assumed that the quotients to f expanded f xpnde under the form of an improper continued fraction , may be made to take the form Q , 2 ; Q23 ; Q ; 24 ; i ... ; 2+ , where Q2 , ; Q4 ; . .
Q2 , are linear functions of x , and i is any number assumed at will , not less than p , and of course not greater than m ; and where w1 ; WI ; ... 2i+1 will have in common a root ?
, which may be made at will the greatest or the least root of w1.W2.W3..2i+1 ; the investigation , however , according to the present light which I possess on the subject , appears complicated and tedious , and therefore , in order that the press , which is waiting for the completion of these supplemental articles , may not be kept standing , must be adjourned to some future occasion .
For the present I content myself with showing the truth of the law for the simple case wherefx is a cubic function of x. Ist .
If gives rise to a single sequence of quotients Q , we know , from the theory of intercalations , that it is necessary that all the roots of fx shall be real , and in order that when this is the case the quotients may form a single sequence Q , it is only necessary so to assume zx , that its roots may be intermediate between those offx .
2nd .
If the roots offx are not all real , or if they are all real , but do not compose the roots offx intercalated between them , and if for greater brevity of ratiocination we .
stipulate that px shall have its leading coefficients of the same sign as that of the leading coefficient offx , the leading coefficients of the three quotients will either bear the respective signs + +- , or the respective signs +-+ , or the respective signs + - ; in the first and last of these cases there would be two sequences , and therefore , by what has been shown above , the method of limitation of the text could not give a limit coincident with a root .
Let us then look to the remaining case , and inquire whether , and how , px may be assumed so thatfx shall become representable to a constant factor prBs by the cumulatt [ p(x-a ) , -q(x-P ) , r(x-a ) ] , where p , q , r are all positive , and a is a root offx .
Let this cuimulant be called hfx .
Nothing in point of generality will be lost if we suppose the leading coefficient of hfx to be -1 .
We then have hfx=:[p(x-a ) , --q(x-- ) ; r(x-a ) ] = -pqr(xa)2(x-b)-(p+r)(--a ) and writing _a=X2+Bx+C and making x=a , we find from the above identity that p+r=a2+Ba+C , i. e. p=a2+Ba+C-r , and pqr(x-)=x+a+B , hence 3+a+B=0 , i.e. 3= -B--a , 1 1_ and pqr=l , and.- .
qr---+ Ba+C-Hence if x be so assumed that the quotients to are p(x-a ) ; -q(x-S ) ; r(x-a ) , we have hqx= [ --q(x-3 ) , r(x-a ) ] =-qr(x+B+-a)(-a)-l.-qr(x"+Bx-a2-aB)1 =--{x2+Bx-a2--aB+p } .
Hence p(x ) is of the form m(x2+Bx-a2-aB+(a2+aB+C-r ) ) =m(x2+Bx+C-r ) .
If we call the three roots offx , a , b , c respectively , we have 11 4=r(aC+'Ba+C-r)'r((a_b)(a-c)+r ) ; and since q and r are both to be positive , we see that ( a ) must be taken the greatest or least of the three roots if they are all real , so that a2+Ba+C may be positive , which it will of course necessarily be if b and c are imaginary ; we must also have a2+Ba+C-r positive , so that the form of &lt; x is m((x2-a2)+B(x-a)-t ) , t being necessarily positive , but otherwise arbitrary , a form containing two arbitrary constants , one of which is subject to satisfy a certain condition of inequality ; whereas when fx is of such a form as to admit , and ; ( x ) is supposed to be so assumed as to cause it to come to pass that the quotients to r form a single sequence , then the three coefficients in px remain exempt from all conditions of equality but are subject to two conditions of inequality .
And so in general when the degree offx is x and the number of sequences 2i+ 1 , it is to be inferred that the n coefficients of px will be subject to satisfy n-i--1 conditions of inequality and i conditions of equality .

The theory of the determination of the minimum interval between either limit determinable by this method and the nearest root , or between the two limits so determinable when ; x is so assumed that r gives rise to a defined even number of sequences ( which will include the theory of the case where all the roots of fx are imaginary ) , must be deferred to an opportunity more favourable for leisurely contemplation .
As regards the application of the theory to the very interesting case of all the roots being imaginary , the principal point remaining to be cleared up is the determination of the least value that can be assigned to the greatest , and the greatest value that can be assigned to the least root of the algebraical product X,.X2.X , ... X2 , where X1 , X , ... X2 , , are all of them real linear functions of x , subject to the condition that the cumulant [ X1 , X2 , X3 ... X2 .
shall ( to a numerical factor prAs ) be equal to a given function of the degree 2n in x incapable of changing its sign , which condition implies , as a necessary consequence , that the coefficients of x in each of the terms X , , X2 , ... X2 .
must be affected with the same algebraical sign .

It should be observed that in the application of the above metod , the division of the series of quotients into distinct sequences governed by the signs of the coefficients of x is introduced for the p'urpose of drawing the limits closer to the roots , 'but is not necessary for the mere object of assigning limits .
Thus , for instance , if there be two sequences so that [ qlq2. .

and qY+1=I qi+2=(2+ ) ... q i+i ( ) the greatest and least roots of x deduced from these equations will be superior and inferior limits respectively to the roots of fx ; from which it is clear that if leaving all the other equations unaltered , except those which contain respectively q ?
and q &lt; +i , we write in place of these q2 the roots of the system of i+i ' equations thus modified will afortiori be limits to the roots offx , but then the quantities 1111 1 , +'1 " , ( + , 2+ ; , 2:_t , 6+ l+ I , V2*+7 ' ' ' -+ ^ -I P'+i-2 iI VI VI form the same single series as would correspond to the two sequences ql q2 ' " qi qi+ l " qi+i ' treated as a single sequence , and the same is obviously the case for any number of sequences .

If we consider a single sequence as q q ... q3 , and write ql=al(x-c1 ) q2=a2(x-c2 ) ... q-=a , ( x--c ) where a , , a , ... , a , are supposed to have all the same sign , and write a , ( x--c1)2= a2(x-c)2= ( c2+-)2 a(x-c)2=( )2 it seems not unlikely that the interval between the greatest and least of the roots of the above equations will be a minimum when the intervals between any pair is the same for each pair , i.e. when 1 .

If n=4 it becomes al.a2.a3.a4 14-(a1.a2+-a3.a4+a.a4)2+ 1=0 .
If n=5 , rejecting the factor j , it becomes aj.a2.a,.a4.a , a 4(a,.a2.a,3+la.a2.a , +a,.a.a+a , ,a.a ) a 2+(a , +a3+a , )=0 , and so in general the equation in g2 being always of a degree measured by the integer nearest to and not exceeding 2 ; and it is easy to be seen that for all values of n , the second coefficient divided by the first will be an inferior limit to 52 ( of course actually coinciding with it for the cases of n=2 and n=3 ) .
Hence we have the following valuable practical rule for finding a superior and inferior limit to the cumulant [ a(x--cO , ) ) a2(X-c a ) , ... , an(x--c , ) , where a , , a2 , ... a , have the same sign , viz. if C be the greatest , and K be the least of the quantities cl , c2 , ... c , , C+A will be a superior , and K-A an inferior limit , A being taken equal to the positive value of A/ 1 '-1 .

and it may be noticed that C and K are the quantities which would themselves be the superior and inferior limits to the given cumulant if the series of terms a , , a , ... a. , instead of presenting only a sequence of continuations or permanencies , presented only a sequence of changes or variations of sign .
SECTION V. On the Theory of Intercalations as applicable to two fJnctions of the same degree , and on theformal properties of the Bezoutiant with reference to the method of Invariants .
Art .
( 56 .

Iffx and px be any two given functions of x of the same degree m , we may form a system of m Bezoutics to f and p ( as shown in the first section ) , the coefficients of the powers of xm- , xt-2 , ... x1 in which will compose a square matrix of m lines of m terms each , which will be symmetrical in respect to the diagonal 510 which passes through the first coefficient of the first Bezoutic and the last coefficient of the last Bezoutic ; and we may construct a quadratic homogeneous function of m new variables , such that its determinantive matrix shall coincide with the Bezoutic square so formed .
This quadratic form may be considered in the light of a generating function .
All its coefficients will be formed of quantities obtained by taking any two coefficients in one of the given functions , and two corresponding coefficients in the other given function , multiplying them in cross order , and taking the difference : each coefficient of the generating function in question will consist of one or more such differences , and will thus be of two dimensions altogether , being linear in respect to the coefficients off , and also linear in respect to the coefficients of p. This generating function I term the Bezoutiant , and it may be denoted by the symbol B(f , p ) : the determinant of B is of course the resultant to f , ~ , and the matrix to B is the Bezoutic square to f , p. Now we have seen that the decrease in the number of continuations of sign in the series 1 , B , ( x ) , B2(x ) ... Bm(x ) ( where Bl(x ) , B2(x ) ... Bm(x ) are the ( n ) Bezoutics to f , p ) , as x changes from a to b , measures the number of roots of fx retained in the effective scale of intercalations taken between the limits ( a ) and ( b ) .
If we take the entire scale between +oand -o the total number of effective intercalations will be the same , whether reckoned by the number of roots of f or of p remnaining ; for these two numbers can never differ except by a unit , since no two of either can ever come together ; but the number of each remaining in the effective scale will be m-2i and m-2i ' respectively , i being the number of pairs of imaginary roots and pairs of unseparated real roots of f and i ' being the similar number for &lt; ; so that we must have i=i ' .
Now obviously this number becomes measured by the number of continuations of sign in the signaletic series 1 , ( B , ) , ( B2 ) , ... ( Bi ) , where in general ( Be ) denotes the principal coefficient in Bi(x ) .
But ( B , ) , ( B2 ) , ... ( B. ) are the successive ascending coaxal minor determinants about the axis of symmetry to the Bezoutic square ; and accordingly the number of continuations just spoken of , measures the number of positive terms in the Bezoutiant when linearly transformed , so as to contain only positive and negative squares , or in other words , measures the inertia of the Bezoutiant , the constant integer which adheres to it under all its real linear transformations .

This inertia is the same number as in the case of a homogeneous quadratic function of three variables , used to express a curve referred to trilinear coordinates , serves to determine whether such conic belongs to the impossible class or to the possible class of conics , being 3 or 0 in the former case , and 1 or 2 in the latter ; or as in the case of a homnogeneous quadratic function of four variables used to denote a surface referred to quadriplanar or tetrahedral coordinates , serves to determine whether such surface belongs to the impossible class or to the class consisting of the ellipsoid and the hyperboloid of two sheets ( which are descriptively indistinguishable ) , or to the hyperboloid of , one sheet , being 0 or 4 in the first case , or 3 in the second , and 2 in the third .
The most symmetrical ( but least expeditious ) method of finding the inertia of any quadratic form is that which corresponds to the method of orthogonal transformations , and is , in fact , the usual method employed in geometrical treatises on lines and surfaces of the second degree .
If we apply this method to the Bezoutiant B considered as a homogeneous quadratic function of the ( m ) arbitrarily named variables ul , u2 , u3 ... u in order to measure its inertia , that is to say , the nurmber of effective interpositions between the two systems of roots , we must construct the determinant rd2.B d2B d2B dB dul ' du1.du2 ' du1.du3I ' " ' dul.du , , d2B d_B d2B dB .

dud uJ All the roots of D(x ) =0 , as is well known , are real ; the inertia of B , being measured by the number of positive roots of D(-X ) , will be equal to the number of continuations of sign in D( .
) expressed as a function of X of the mth degree .
If in fx and qx we reverse the order of the coefficients , and fx and px so transformed become f , ( x ) and p , ( x ) , it is obvious that the roots off , and p , being the reciprocals of the roots off and p respectively , the number of effective intercalations tof/ and p1 must be the same as forf and p. Accordingly we find that the form of the Bezoutiant tof and p is the same as that of the Bezoutiant to f , and p , the sole difference ( one only of names ) being that B(ul , u2 , ... um_i , ur ) for the one becomes B(um , u_i , ... u2 , u , ) for the other .
The equation D(X ) , which determines the inertia of B , remains precisely the same as it ought to do for either of the two systemsf and o orf and p. Art .

The theory in the preceding articles of this section may be made to embrace the case involved in STURM'S theorem ; for if fx=:ao.x'n+ al.x+ ... +am-,.xml+a.xm f'x= ma,.Xnl+ ( n1 )a,.xn-2+ ... and fix=mfx-f'x -=a.x'1~+2a2 .

n. a the Bezoutian secondaries , or which is the same thing , the simplified Sturmian residues tofx and f'x , will evidently be the same as those to f , x and f'x .
Accordingly , if we form the signaletic series fx f'x , BE B2 ... B , , , n512 where B , , B2 ... Bm_i are the Bezoutian secondaries tof , x and f'x , the number of variations of sign between consecutive ternis in this series , when x is made +oo , will measule the number of pairs of imaginary roots infx ; andfr and f'x forming always a continuation , and the coefficient of f'(x ) being supposed positive , we see that the terms of the rhizoristic series will be 1 , ( BI ) , ( B2 ) ... ( Bm_i ) consisting of positive unity , and the successive ascending coaxal determinants of the Bezoutian matrix to f ' and fix .
Hence then the form of the Bezoutiant tof'x andgi will serve to determine the number of pairs of imaginary , and consequently also the number of real roots to fx .
It should be remarked that the form of the Bezoutiant to/ 'x and f , x , considered as a quadratic function of u1 , u2 ... 2u_l and of the coefficients inf(x ) , will remain unaltered when forfx we write f , x , for this will change the signs throughout of fx and fix , and consequently the coefficients in the Bezoutiant , which contain in every term one coefficient fromf'x , and one fromfix , will remain unaltered in sign .

It appears then from the preceding article , that e fo every function of x of the degree m , there exists a homogeneous quadratic function of ( m1 ) variables , the inertia of which augmented by unity will represent the number of real roots in the given function .
Now this inertia itself nay be measured gy the number of positive roots of a certain equation in X formed from the quadratic function ( in fact the well-known equation for the secular inequalities of the planets ) , all whose roots will be real .
Hence then we are led to the following remarkable statement .
" c An algebraical equation of any degree being given , an equation whose degree is one unit lower may be formed , all the roots of which shall be real , and of which the number of positive roots shall be one less than the total number of real roots of the given equation .
" Let us supposefx written in its most general form , the first an( last as well as all the intermediate coefficients being anything whatever : by reversing the order of the coefficientsf/ will becomefix and fix will becomef'x ; the Bezoutiant tof , x and f ' ( which we may term the Bezoutoid to fc ) will remain unaltered except in sign , and the equation of the ( ml)th degree in K formed from the Bezoutoid remain unchanged , consequently the equation in X enables us to substitute , for the purpose of calculating the total numtber of real roots in f(x ) in lieu of STURM'S auxiliaty functions tof(x ) , another set of functions which remain unaltered when the order of the coefficients is completely reversed , i. e. in effect , when we consider the number of real roots of/ f( ) in lieu of those off(x ) .
And of course more generally the equation of the mth degree in K formed from the Bezoutiant to any two functions fx and px of the mth degree each in x , supplies a set of functions for deterrnining the total number of effective intercalations between the roots off(x ) and p(x ) , which do not alter when we consider in lieu of these , the roots off($ ) and p(h ) .
This substitution of functions symmetrically formed in respect to the two ends of an equation for the purpose of assigning the total number of real roots in lieu of the unsymmetrical ones furnished 3x2 513 by the ordinary method of M.

It may happen that the Bezoutiant tof and p ( each of the mth degree ) may become a quadratic function of less than m independent variables , or the Bezoutoid tof ( a function in x of the mth degree ) of less than ( m1 ) independent variables .
This will take place whenever f and p have roots in common , or whenever F has equal roots .
The number of independent relations of equality between the roots of f and p , and the amount of multiplicity , however distributed , among the roots of F , will be indicated by the number of orders thus disappearing out of the general form of the Bezoutiant and Bezoutoid in the respective cases* .
In what particular mode the form of each would be affected according to the manner of the distribution of the equalities and the multiplicity requires a specific discussion , which I must reserve for some fuiture occasion .

I shall devote the remainder of this memoir to a consideration of the properties and affinities of Bezoutiants or Bezoutoids , regarded from the point of view of the Calculus of Invariants .
For this purpose it will be more convenient hereafter to convert all the functions which we are concerned with into homogeneous fortns , and I shall accordingly for the future usef and p to denote functions each of x and y , which I shall write under the form m-1 p= bo , .

In what follows a knowledge of the general principles of the Method of Invariants is presupposed , but a perusal of my two papers on the Calculus of Forms in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathemnatical Journal , February and May 1852 , will furnish nearly all the information that is strictly necessary for the present purpose .
The first point to be established is , that B , the Bezoutian of fx and px , is a Covariant to the systemf , p ; the variables in B being in compound relation of cogredience with the combinations of powers of x and y , mn-i ; xm-2 ; n--3 r 1m-1 X ; X.y ; x ... y e That is to say , I propose to show that if f g , h , k be any four quantities , taken for greater simplicity subject to the relationfk--gh =l , and if on substitutingfx-+gy for x and hx+ky for y , f(x , y ) becomes Ao.xm+mA.x m-'.y+m .
A2 A.xmn 2.y2-+A.ymn , say G(x , y ) , and p ( x , y ) becomes B.:m f+B.x'.y+r m.B2 B m-2 y2+B.y say T(x , y ) , and if B'(ul , u4 ... uL ) be the Bezoutiant to G and T ; B(u , , U2 ... um ) being that tof and p , then , on making u , , u2 ... u , the same linear functions of u , U* ... Um as ( fx-+gy)m ; ( fx +gy)m-l(hIx+ky ) ; ... ... ( f/ x+gy)(hx+ky)n~-1 ; ( hx+ky)m-1 are respectively of x , nW-.y ... y~ X. ; in B will become identical with B ' .
I was led to suspect the high probability of the truth of this proposition concerning the invariance of the Bezoutiant from the following considerations : 1st .
That for the particular case wheref and p are the differential derivatives in respect to x and y respectively of the same function F(x , y ) , the Bezoutiant of f and p , which then becomes the Bezoutoid of F , determines the number of real factors in F , which obviously remains the same for all linear transformations of F. 2ndly .
That takingf and p in their most general form , the invariant to their Bezoutiant , i. e. the detetrminant of their Bezoutiant is an invariant off and p , being in fact the resultant of these two functions ; now as every concomitant ( an invariantive form of the most general kind ) to a concomitant is itself a concomitant to the primitive , so it appeared to me , and is I believe true ( although awaiting strict proof ) , that any form satisfying certain necessary and tolerably obvious conditions of homogeneity and isobarism , a concomitant to which is also a concomitant to a given form , will be itself a concomitant to such form ; this principle , if admitted , would be of course at once conclusive as to the Bezoutiant being an invariantive concomlitant to the functions from which it is derived .

Since the publication of the two papers above referred to on the Calculus of Forms , I have made the important observation that every species of concomitant , however complex , to a given system of functions , may be treated as a simple invariant of a system including the given system together with an appropriate superadded system of absolute functions ; thus an ordinary covariant involving only one system of variables , as u , v , w ... cogredient with x , y , z ... the variables of a system S , is in fact an invariant of the system S combined with the system ux-vy , vz--wy , wx-uz , &amp;c. , u , v , w ... being treated as constants ; so again a simple contravariant of S is an invariant of S combined with the equation ux+ vi +-wz+ &amp;c. ; so again , to meet the case before us , a covariant to the binary system fand p expressed as a function of U1 , u2 ... u , , wheie ul1 u2 ... u , are cogredient with X- ' , X"-2.y..y-l ' , may be regarded as an invariant of the ternary systemf , p , Q , where f=ul.ym~ -mu2.ym-~x+m..y~y3 ... + ( -)~-l.Um_1 , ( u1 , u2 , ... umbeing here to be treated as constants ) , and accordingly the differential equations which serve to define in the most general and absolute manner such covariant off , p , or invariant tof , p , f , say I , will take the form i{ bo db , )+2(al g+ b , -dbd+3U aU 2 ?

An admirable suggestion , well worthy of its keen-witted author , for which I am indebted to Mr. CAYLEY , will enable us to prove the invariantive character of B by a much more expeditious method .

The mode of obtaining the covariant a , used in this and the preceding article , is very remarkable .
I believe that the true suggestive view of the process for finding it , is to consider f(x , y).(x ' , y')-f(x ' , y ) ).P(x y ) as a concomitant capable of being expressed under the form of a function of a and , , w standing for the universal covariant xy'-x , y ; I is then to be considered , not properly as a quotient , but rather as an invariant of the form S.w , a ftlnction of w of the first degree , where a is treated as constant .

B is not an ordinary covariant off and 'p , it belongs to that special and most important family of invariants to a system to which I have given the name of Combinants* , viz. Invariants , which , besides the ordinary character of invariance , when linear substitutions are impressed upon the variables , possess the same character of invariance when linear substitutions are impressed upon the functions themselves containing the variables ; combinants being , as it were , invariants to a system of functions in their corporate combined capacity qud system .
That the Bezoutiant possesses this property is evident ; for if instead off and p we write kf+ip and kf+i'p , any such quantity as are .

We derive immediately from this observation , the somewhat remarkable geometrical proposition , that the intersections with the axis of x made by any two curves of the family of curves u=kf(x)+-z(x ) , ( f and p being functions of x of the same degree ) give rise to a constant number of effective intercalations , whatever values be given to X or b for the two curves so selected .

B(ul u , u ... Um ) being a covariant of the systemf and p , and ul , u2 , ... um cogredient with x -2,.y ... yo l , it follows from a general principle in the theory of invariants , that on making u , , u2 , ... u respectively equal to the quantities with which they are cogredient , B will become an ordinary covariant tof and p. By this transformation B becomes a function of x and y of the degree 2(m--1 ) in x and y conjointly , and linear in respect to the coefficients of f , and also in respect to those of p. The only covariant capable of answering this description is what I an in the habit of calling the Jacobian ( after the name of the late but ever-illustrious JACOBI ) , a term capable of application to any number of homogeneous functions of as many variables .
In the case before us , where we have two functions of two variables , the Jacobian df d@p d ' dx df d df df J(f = jdf_ d\ dyx'dy'd-dy'dy die We have then the interesting proposition* , that the Bezoutiant to two functions , when the variables in the former are replaced by the combinations of the variables in the latter , with which they are cogredient , becomes the Jacobiant .
So in the case of a dF dF single function F of the degree m , the Bezoutiant , i. e. the Bezoutoid to I- , -y- , on making the ( m ) variables which it contains identical with m"-2 ; xm-3.y ; ... .ym"dF dF respectively , becomes identical with the Jacobian to dF , die , i. e. the Hessian ofF , viz. fd2F d2F J dy ' dxdy dxdy ; dy2 J As an example of this property of the Bezoutiant , suppose f= ax3+ bxy + cxy +dy3 p=X3++X2y +yy2+y3 .
The Bezoutiant matrix becomes a , P-e ; aa--c ; ay-co ; -d a da ary-c c ; + ; byc br--c3 at-do b ; by-cq3 ; c--dy .
The Bezoutiant accordingly will be the quadratic function ( a3bo)u'+(a3-dcs+b y-c-)u+ c 2-dyu +2(aycoc)u.u2+2(a-da)u3.ui +2(by-c3)u2.u , , which on making Ul--"x2 U2==XY U=-Y2 , U1=X 2-Xy U3 f , becomes Lx4 + Mxy + Nxy2 + Pxy3 + Q4 , .
( .
) where L , M , N , P , Q respectively will be the sum of the terms lying in the successive bands drawn parallel to the sinister diagonal of the Bezoutiant matrix , i. e. L =af3--bo M=2(ay--ca ) N= 3( ado )+(by c ) P =2(by-c3 ) Q =c-dfy .
The biquadratic function in x and y ( 3 .
) above written will be found on computation to be identical in point of form with the Jacobian tof , P , viz. ( 3a2+2 2 bxy + cy ) ( 3x2+2yxy+3y2 ) ( 3ax2+ 2xy + y2 ( bx2+ 2cxy+ dy2 ) , this latter being in fact 3Lx4+3Mx+3Ny4+3Py+3QY4 .
3Lx4 + 3Mx " y+ 3Nxy2 3 Pxy '+ 3Qyf .
The remark is not without some interest , that in fact the Bezoutiant , which is capable ( as has been shown already ) of being mechanically constructed , gives the best and readiest means of calculating the Jacobian ; for in summing the sinister bands transverse to the axis of symmetry the only numerical operation to be performed is that of addition of positive integers , whereas the direct method involves the necessity of numerical subtractions as well as additions , inasmuch as the same terms will be repeated with different signs .
Thus if f= ax5 + bx4y+ cx"y2 + dxy + exy4 + ly5 = ax5+ Pxy + yx+ r3y2 + x2y3+ y4+ y using ( r , s ) in the ordinary sense that has been considered throughout , we obtain by taking the sum of the sinister bands in ( a.)* for the value of B when we write .
X4 3 2y x4 , x3y , 2y2 , xy3 % y4 in place of u , u2 , u3 , u4 , u5 , ( 0 , 1)8+2(0 , 2)7 ( 3(0 , 3)+(1 , 2))y2+ ( 4(0 , 4)+2(1 , 3)),5y3 +(5(0 , 5)+3(1 , 4 ) + ( 2 , 3 ) ) 4y4+ ( 4(1 , 5 ) +2(2 , 4 ) ) 3y+(3(2 , 5)+(3 , 4 ) ) 3y6 +2(3 , 5)y7+(4 , 5)y .
The direct process requires the calculation of ( 5ax4+4bx3y+ 3cx2y2+2dxy ?
+ ey4 ) ( 3x4+27xy +3x2y2+ 4 exy3+ 5xy4 ) ( 5a4+4P"3y+ 3yx2ys+2 ?
xy3"+gy4 ) ( bx4+2cx3y + 3dx2y2+4exy3+ 5 y4 ) , each coefficient of which will contain the numerical factor 5 ; so that to reduce the Jacobian to its simplest form each coefficient will necessitate the employment of additions , subtractions , and a division , instead of additions merely , as when the Bezoutic square is employed .
For instance , to find the coefficient of x4.y from the above expression ( a. ) , we have to calculate 5(25(0 , 5)+16(1 , 4)+9(2 , 3)+4(3 , 2)+(4 , 1 ) ) , i.e. 5(25(0 , 5)+(16 -1)(1 , 4)+(9 4)(2 , 3 ) ) which is 5(0 , 5)+3(1 , 4)+(2 , 3 ) , agreeing with what has been found above for the value of such coefficient , by a simple process of counting .
The same remark will , of course , also apply to the computation of the Hessian of F by means of its Bezoutoid .

This relation between the Bezouitiant and the Jacobian led me to inquire whether , as would at first sight appear probable , the Bezoutiant were the only lineo-linear quadratic function of ( m ) variables covariantive tof and p ( the word lineo-linear being used to denote the form of coefficients , such as those in the Bezoutiant , linear in respect of the coefficients in f and the coefficients of p ) .
If so , then there would have existed a method of performing the inverse process of recovering the Bezoutiant from the Jacobian , almost as simple as that of deriving the Jacobian from the Bezoutiant .
On investigating the matter , however , I found that such is by no means the caset , but that there exists a whole family of independent lineo* Vide art .

This might have been concluded immediately from the following observation .
Let J , the Jacobian of f and 9 , be expressed under the form 2m-3 AoX2m-2+ ( 2m-2)A.X2m-1.y+ ( 2m--2 ) 2m-3Ax2m-2.ye +. .

I have , moreover , I believe , succeeded in determining the number of such lineo-linear quadratic forms for any value of ( m ) , of which all the rest , in whatever manner obtained , may be expressed as linear functions , the coefficients of the linear relations moreover being abstract numbers ; in other worlds , I have succeeded in forming the fundamental or constituent scale of lineo-linear quadratic forms of rn variables covariantive tof and p ; a result of too great interest , as exhibiting the affinities of the Bezoutiant to its cognate forms , to be altogether passed over in silence .
Supposing the number of linearly independent forms of the kind to be v , then speaking a priori any of the forms taken at random might seem to be equally eligible to form one of the v included in the fundamental scale , combined with any ( v-1- ) others independent inter se , and of which the selected one is also independent .
In fact , however , this is not so ; for it will always be more satisfactory to contemplate the fundamental scale of forms as generated successively or simultaneously by a uniform process ; and in the case before us , the process which I have hit upon , and which I believe is the simplest that can be employed for generating the fundamental scale , will be found not to include directly the Bezoutiant among the number .
There will thus arise two subjects of inquiry ; 1st , the mode of forming the fundamental scale , and proving its fundamental D=O is the condition to be satisfied in order that J may be representable under the form of the sum of the squares of ( m-1 ) linear functions of x and y , and D itself is an invariant to J , and consequently an invariant and ( as is obvious from its form ) a combinantive invariant to f and p. Moreover , which is more immediately to the point , we know that the quadratic form Q ( Aou+ 2A , ( u1 .
( n-l)u ) +A{((m-l ) u2)s+ 2u1 ( ( m 1 2 ) ) 3+ &amp;c. +A22U will be an invariant tof , 9 and a ( this last quantity &amp; 2 being defined as in p. 524 ) , and a combinantive covariant tof and p in the same sense precisely as the Bezoutiant is a covariant to the same , and like the Bezoutiant is lineo-linear in respect of the coefficients off and f. If we operate with the symbol E , where E represents d+ + ?

, dAo dA1 dA 2 dA3m-2 upon K any invariant of f and p , we shall obtain E. K , a quadratic function of vuv ... vy , which by the rules of thhe Calculus of Forms we knowwill be a contravariant tof and 9 , and the matrix corresponding towhich must evidently be persymmetrical .
It is an interesting subject of inquiry , which I reserve for some future occasion , to determine the Co-bezoutiant , the Discriminant of which must be employed for K , so that when this discriminant is operated upon by E , the matrix corresponding to E. K may become identical ( term for term ) with the matrix which is the inverse to the Bezoutiant matrix , which inverse , as JACOBI has so simply and beautifully demonstrated , possesses this persymmetrical character .
Vide the " De Eliminatione , " section 5 .
The investigation of the arithmetical connexion between the Q of this note and the fundamental Co-bezoutiants must be also similarly reserved .
I believe it to be generally true , and have verified the fact for the case of two cubic functions , that E. Q gives a quadratic form such that the corresponding matrix is the inverse to the matrix of Q. The calculations necessary for extending the verification of this remarkable proposition for functions of x , y exceeding the third degree ( notwithstanding that they are much abbreviated by the application of the rules of the calculus ) still remain excessively laborious .
The abbreviation alluded to consists in confining the verification in question to the comparison of either one of the two unreiterated terms at opposite corners of the matrix to E. Q with the corresponding term in the inverse matrix of Q ; if these coincide , it is easy to prove that every other pair of corresponding terms in the two matrices must also coincide respectively with one another .
character ; 2ndly , determining the numerical relations which connect that very important form , perhaps of all of its kind , the most important with the forms comprised in the fundamental or constituent scale .
These questions I propose to consider more fully at a future period .
For the present I shall content myself with giving a method of forming the constituent scale ( without , however , seeking the proof of all the forms extra to such assumed scale being linear functions of these comprised within it ) , and with determining the numerical relations between the forms in this scale and the Bezoutiant for a limited number of values of m. All the forms which we are seeking , besides being lineo-linear quadratics , must also be combinantive invariants to f and ?
p , remaining ( as forms ) unaltered for any linear substitutions impressed either upon the variables or upon the functions containing the variables .

; Ti will then be lineo-linear in respect to the coefficients in f and p , and of the degree 2(m-(2i+l ) ) in respect to x and y. Again , let 1.2 ... 2i Iid2 Ei*'lm(m1 ) ) ...

Ur .
We have thus two forms , Ti and Q , , each of the same even degree ( 2m--(2i+1 ) ) in respect of x , y. Forming between these the lineo-linear invariant Gi , Gi will be a function lineo-linear in respect of the coefficients of f and p , and quadratic in respect of the system u , u2 , ... urm .
Moreover , ( G will ( by the general principle of successive concomitance ) be an invariant in respect to the system f , p , Q ?
, and combinantive in respect to f and p. Thus then Gi for all admissible values of i will belong to the family of forms to which the Bezoutiant is to be referred .
It requires to be noticed , that when i is taken ( 0 ) , so that Ti and Gi are of the degree 2(m--1 ) , Ei for this case must be taken equal to &amp; 22 , which evidently fuilfills the required conditions of being of the degree 2(m1 ) in ( x , y ) , and quadratic in respect of the coefficients of Q2 .
If , now , m be even , we may take for 2i+1 successively all the odd numbers from 1 to ( m-1 ) inclusively , and there will be 22 forms G ; when m is odd we may take for 2i+l successively all the odd numbers from 1 to m , and the number of forms of Gi will be m+It should be observed , that when m is odd and 2i+1-=m , Ti will become identical with the lineo-linear combinant tof and p and Qi with the quadrinvariant to Q ; and no power of x or y will enter into either , so that Gm will become simply TmXQmn I am now able to enunciate the proposition , that Go , G,. .
G_ , when m is even , and Go , GI , ... Gm_ , , when m is odd , 22 form the constituent scale of forms , of which the Bezoutiant and all other lineo-linear quadratic functions of m variables , which are combinants of the system 3f , p , will be numerically-linear functions .
I propose to term the members of this scale Co-bezoutiants .
As regards the present memoir , I shall content myself with exhibiting a partial verification of this law as regards the connection of the Bezoutiant with the G scale of Co-bezoutiants , and a complete determination of the numerical multipliers which express this connection for the cases comprised between m=2 and m=6 taken inclusively .
It is impossible to predict for what ulterior purposes in the development of the Calculus of Invariants these numbers may or may not be required , and it seems 525 to me desirable that a commencement of a table containing them should be made and placed on record .
The remaining pages of this memoir will accordingly be devoted to the ascertainment of them .
The theory of the Bezoutoid being included within that of the Bezoutiant , need not hereafter call for any special attention ; I may merely notice that the Bezoutoid m3 to a function of the degree ( m ) will be a numerico-linear function of2 of the G 's m---4 if m be odd , and 2 of the G 's if m be even .
It will be more convenient hereafter to denote the G 's as G , , G , G , respectively , in lieu of Go , G , G2 , &amp;c. , and to continue at the same time to give to the T 's and Q 's the same subscripts as the corresponding G 's .

These series could if wanted be easily extended , and the calculation of the coefficients reduced to a mere mechanical procedure .
If we suppose m to be 2i or 2i1 , we have the equation B=c,.Gli+C3.G3+- ... +c2iGi-1 ; and it appears from the foregoing instances that the comparison of the coefficients , either of u1 , or of u1.u2 on the two sides of the equation , will serve to give cl and cl ( which is always m being known ) , c , may be found by a comparison of the coefficients either of u,.u , , or of u1.u4 , and so on for c5 ... c,2_ ; all the coefficients in the equation for B above given , thus admitting of being found separately and successively and in two modes , so that there is a check at each step upon the correctness of the computations : the only exception to this last remark is ( when m is odd ) for the last coefficient of which the above condensed method affords only a single determination .
I need hardly add the remark , that in substituting xm- , x"-.y ; ... x.y-2 ... ym " in place of U , u2 , ... u_ , urn respectively , all the G 's become ( to a numerical factor pros ) identical with one another and with the Jacobian to the system ( fp ) .

The foregoing theory took its origin ( as will have been readily imagined ) in meditations growing out of the celebrated theorem of M. STURM .
There appear to be several directions in which a development or extension of the subject matter of that theorem may be sought for .
Thus a theory may be constructed relative to a single function of one or more variables , viewed in all cases as representing a geometrical locus .
In the limiting case , when this locus becomes a system of points in a right line , we have the theorem of STURM ; generally the theory will be that of contours .
Or , again , a theory may be formed in which the number of functions is always kept equal to that of the variables .
We have then a theory of discreet points corresponding to roots , the number of real ones of which comprised within given limits it is the object of such theory to determine .
M. HERMIT , in a memoir recently presented to the Frenedh Institute , appears to have made tia valuable addition to the Sturmian theory extended in this direction , to which the beautiful researches of M. CAUCHY and the joint labours of MM .
LIOUVILLE and STURM , with reference to the disposition of the imaginary roots of equations appear to have led the way .
Finally , the number of variables may be supposed to be atrbitrarily increased , but made always inferior by a unit to the number of the functions in which they are contained , or which comes to the same thing , we may construct the theory of a system of homogeneous functions equal in number to the variables in them , which in its simplest case becomes the theory of Intercalations which has been here partially considered , and which ( as has been shown ) embraces ( not as a particular case , but as an implied consequence and easily extricated result ) the theorem of M. STURM .

The expressions given in art .
( n. ) for the partial quotients of the continued fraction represented by - , are restricted to the supposition of all these partial quotients ( except the first ) being linear in x ; when the first paltial quotient is linear the formula ( B. ) of that article continues applicable on replacing ( Di h0)by 1 .
I was forcibly struck by the peculiarity of these formulae not ceasing to be tlrue in consequence of the first partial quotient being supposed non-linear ; and reflecting upon this , I was soon led to perceive that all the partial quotients imight be supposed to be arbitrary integral functions of x , and the formulae would still continue to apply to any such of them as might happen to be linear , although , as it were , imbedded among a group of other non-linear partial quotients .
From this it was but an easy step to perceive that the formulae A and B must admit of extension to the representation of partial quotients of any form , and that the dimorphismn of the representation of the linear partial quotients could only be a consequence of the equation in integers u+v= 1 having two solutions u=O , v= 1 and u= 1 , v=O .
I now proceed to enunciate the very remarkable general theorem ( or as it may perhaps not inappropriately be termed Algebraical Porism ) , by vir-tue of which any partial quotient of a given degree in x belonging to an infinite continued fiaction , all of whose partial quotients are algex braical functions of x , may be expressed to a constant factor pros , by means of the numerator and denomlinator ( or if we please either one of these ) of the convergent immediately antecedent to and of the numerator and denominator of any convergent not antecedent to the partial quotient which is to be determined .

If in the above expression we should use oa in lieu of a , , where a ' is ai diminished by any integer inferior to wi , we should get other forms of the saine residue , but these will all be of higher dimensions in the roots or coefficients than the one just given , and in fact the forms thus obtained corresponding to the values i , -l , ai-2 , ... .ao--ci+1 substituted for ai in succession , would by aid of the relations of condition between the coefficients of tDx and Fx implied in the value of w , admit of being exhibited as a scale in which each form would be an exact algebraical product of the form which precedes it , multiplied by a function of the coefficients , and did space permit thereof it would be perfectly easy to give the forms of these multiplicators .
But I pass on to the representation of what is more material , viz. the forit of the complete residue in the case supposed , merely observing ( as an obiter dictum ) that the existence of each singular partial quotient ( meaning thereby a quotient non-linear in x ) only affects the form of the single simplified residue in immediate connexion with itself , and not at all the forim of the other residues antecedent or subsequent to that one .

I will merely add a very few words in generalization of the method of limiting the roots offx given in the Supplement to the fourth Section .
As an inferior limit tofx is identical with a superior limit tof(-x ) , we may confine our attention to superior limits alone .

, a superior limit to the superior litnits of the cumulants [ Q Q2 ... .Q ] , [ Q'1 , Q ' ... Q , , ... [ ( Q)1 ( Q)2 ... ( Q)( ) ] will be a superior limit to fi , so that it renlains only to give a rule for finding a superior limit to a cumulant [ Q1 , Q2 , Q3 ... Q ] , which , 2 ?
, is to be found by making Q-M1 =O , Q2-M2=0 , Q3M3=-O..Q.-Mi=O , 111 where Ml=- , M2=2+M M3=(3+ ... Mi-- , _l , P , , p , ... Pibeing any quantities entirely independent and arbitrary except in regard to their being all of the same sign as the leading coefficient in the element Q2 , Q ... Qi We may then find L1 , L2 , ... Li any superior limits to the roots of x in these i equations respectively ; L , the greatest of these , will be a superior limit to the proposed cumulant [ Qi Q2 ... Qij ; and it may be observed that M1 M2 ... Mi are the general values which satisfy the equation 111 M1-MM 3-~.0 , subject to the condition that for all values of e1111 MeMe , Me-2'"- ' shall have a given invariable sign .
The first part of the process , as just shown , consists in separating the type of the total curnulant which represents fx into partial 539 types , the point for each firacture of the total type being marked by a change of sign in the elements of the type for the value x= +x , ; it is easily seen therefore from this , that if x is the generatrix of the cumulant in question , the number of such fractures ( i. e. the number one less than the number of partial cumulants ) will be the number of changes of algebraical sign in the signaletic series , consisting of the leading coefficients in Fx and in each of the odd-placed complete residues respectively , together with the number of changes of sign in the signaletic series , consisting of the leading coefficients in DPx and in each of the evenplaced complete residues r ?

The syzygetic theory of two algebraical functions , and the allied theory of algebraical continued fractions with their principal applications , may , I think , now be said to be completely made out , as well for the singular cases as for the general hypothesis .

Again , if Dix represent the simplified denominator of the ith convergent to the continued fraction equal to qIx ( Fr ) which is to be found , say 1I1 ( Alx+B , )(A2 +B2)-'"An +Bn ' we have Dx=-i= h , h.h 2 ( x-h , )(x-h2 ) ... .(xh , h , h2 ... hi hi+ , hi+2.* it is therefore now known as a rational and integral function of x ; h , h2 ... hn ; ClC2 ... , .
The allotrious factor itself is made up of the product of squares of quantities all of the same form as the leading coefficient in Dix , which , from what has been shown above , is seen to be equal to i-I ( -_ ) 2 ( { ( cc ... cc)~(hh2 ... ( h , ) } .
Hence each term in the continued fraction 1I1 ( A1x + B1)(A2w + B2)(Ax +B which is to be made equal to C1 + C2 4 Cn ( hi ) ( h ' ) ' ( -hn ) is completely assigned in terms of x and the given quantities c and h. Art .

The number of effective interlcalations between the roots of PDx , Fx is easily seen to be equal to the excess of the number of positive real numerators over the number of negative real numerators in the partial fractions of which Fp is the sum , and hence we see a priori , as an obvious consequence of a sirnple extension of the reasoning in art .

The expression for the numerators to the convergents may also , there is no doubt , be obtained by some simple modification ( dependent on introducing the quantities c , c2 ... c , ) of the formula in art .

da , da , 542 Glossary of new or unusual Terms , or of Terms used in a new or unusual sense in the preceding Memoir .
Allotrious.-The allotrious factor to a residue or quotient in the process of common measure applied to two algebraical functions is the constant factor of which such residue or quotient must be divested in order to become an integral and irreducible function .
Apocopated.-Applied to a type in the Theory of Cumulants , denotes a type the final or initial element of which has been taken away .
If both are taken away , the type is said to be doubly apocopated .
Bezoutic.-For definition of Primary and Secondary Bezoutics see first Section .
Bezoutiant to two functions , each of degree n , is a homogeneous quadratic invariantive function of n variables , the form of which serves to assign the index of the scale of the effective intercalations of the real roots of the two given functions .
Bezoutoid.-The Bezoutiant to two homogeneous fulnctions obtained by differentiation from one homogeneous function of two variables .
The Bezoutoid to a given function of m dimensions in the variables is accordingly a quadratic function of ( m-1 ) variables , the form of which is sufficient for determining the number of real roots in the given function .
Characteristic.-The employment of this word has been avoided in the preceding memoir ; but as it contains an idea of capital importance in analysis , and especially in all inquiries of the kind here treated of , I subjoin the definition of its meaning .
The characteristic of a simple condition of any kind is the rational integral function ( in its lowest terms ) whose evanescence necessarily and universally implies and is implied by the satisfaction of such condition .
A simple condition has always a single characteristic , abstraction being made of the algebraical sign , which remains indeterminate .
In like manner , a multiple condition , or a system of conditions , will have for its characteristic a plexus of rational integral functions , whose evanescence necessarily and universally implies and is implied by the satisfaction of such multiple condition or system of conditions .
The number of functions in the characteristic plexus will however in general greatly exceed the index of the multiplicity of the conditions , and need not always be a unique system .
There are however exceptions to this : thus the duplex condition , that a biquadratic function of x shall contain a cubic factor , or that a curve of the third degree shall have a cusp , will each be definitely characterized by a plexus of two functions , and no more .
The spirit of the higher analysis resides , and is to be sought for , in the logic of characteristics .
Co-bezoutiant.-Any homogeneous quadratic function similar in form and in its property of invariance to the Bezoutiant .
Cogredient and Contragredient.-A system of variables is cogredient to another system when it is subject to undergo simultaneously therewith linear substitutions of a like kind , and contragredient when it is subject to undergo linear substitutions simultaneously therewith but of a contrary kind .
Combinant.-A function of the quantities appearing in a given set of functions which remains unaltered as well for linear substitutions impressed upon the variables as for linear combinations of the functions themselves .
Concomitant.-Nomen generalissimum for a form invariantively connected with a given form or system of forms .
Conjunctive.-A syzygetic function of a given set of functions .
Any function which universally , and subject to no cases of exception , vanishes when a certain number of other functions all vanish together must be a conjunctive ( i. e. a syzygetic function ) , or a root of a conjunctive of such functions .
But if its vanishing is subject to cases of exception , then all that can be predicated of it is that it is syzygetically related to such functions , but it may , and usually does happen , that it will be syzygetically related to them in more than one way .
Contravariant.-A function which stands in the same relation to the primitive function from which it is derived as any of its linear transforms to an inversely derived transform of its primitive .
Covariant.-A function which stands in the same relation to the primitive function from which it is derived as any of its linear transforms to a similarly derived transform of its primitive .
Cumulant.-The denominator of the simple algebraical fraction which expresses the value of an improper continued fraction .
See Type , infra .
Determinant.-'This word is used throughout in the single sense , after which it denotes the alternate or hemihedral function the vanishing of which is the condition of the possibility of the coexistence of a system of a certain number of homogeneous linear equations of as many variables .
Dialytic.-If there be a system of functions containing in each term different combinations of the powers of the variables in number equal to the number of the functions , a resultant may be formed from these functions by , as it were , dissolving the relations which connect together the different combinations of the powers of the variables , and treating them as simple independent quantities linearly involved in the functions .
The resultant so formed is called the Dialytic Resultant of the functions supposed ; and any method by which the elimination between two or more equations can be made to depend on the formation of such a resultant is called a dialytic method of elimination .
In such method accordingly the process of elimination between equations of a higher degree than the first is always reduced to a question of elimination between equations which are of the first degree only .
Discriminant.-The resultant of the n differential coefficients of a homogeneous function of n variables .
See Resultant , infra .
Disjunctive.-A disjunctive equation is a relation between two sets of quantities such that each one of either set is equal according to some unspecified order of connexion with some one of the other set .
Effective scale of intercalations is the series of the real roots of two functions of x written in order of magnitude after repeated processes of removing pairs of roots belonging to either the same function ( when not separated by roots of the other function ) : the roots of the two functions follow each other alternately .
Effluent.-From every homogeneous function of any number of variables i of the degree mmf , where mm ' are any two integers , may be formed ( as shown in the Calculus of Forms , Section I. ) a covariantive function of the degree m and of x. variables [ where tf is the number of permutations that can be obtained by dividing mf into i parts ( zeros admissible ) ] , in which all the coefficients are numerical multiples of the given coefficients ; covariants so formed may be termed effluents of their primitive .
An example of this occurs in the foot note to Section V. p. 522 , where the quantity there called Q is a quadratic effluent of the Jacobian .
Element .-A simple component of the type to a cumulant , See Cumulant , supra .
544 Emanant.-The result of operating any number of times ( suppose i times ) upon a given homogeneous function of any number of variables x , y , ... t with the operative symbol { , ddd d\ r+YI +z I a..+Y r ( T die dz d t ) is called the ith emanant of the function operated upon .
Every emanant is a covariant to its primitive , the new variables xf , y ' , zr , ... tt being cogradient with the variables x , y , z ... t with which they are respectively associated .
E2i+if , E2i+iP , page 522 , are emanants off and &lt; .
The process of emanation is one of incessant occurrence in the theory of invariants .
When the order of the emanation is the same as the degree of the function ( supposed to be rational and integral ) from which the emanation proceeds , the form of the original function is reproduced in the final emanant , the names only of the variables being changed .
Endoscopic , Exoscopic.-When the coefficients of the functions concerned in any investigation are regarded as integral indecomposable monads , the method is called exoscopic , and endoscopic when the coefficients are treated with reference to their internal constitution as composed of roots or other elements .
In addition to the examples in the foot note to Section 1 , these words have a marked and most important application in the theory of Invariants , especially of two variables .
Form.-Any function may be regarded as an opus operatum ; the matter operated upon being the variables , and the substance of the operations being the form , which resides in the function as the soul in the body .
A form is always common to an infinity of functions , but for greater brevity may be and frequently is called by the name of some specified function in which it is contained .
Fundainental.-The fundamental scale of a system of Invariants or Concomitants is a set of the same , whereof every other is a Rational Integral Function .
Hessian or Hessean , named after Dr. OTTO HESSE , of Konigsberg ( the worthy pupil of his illustrious master , JACOBI , but who , to the scandal of the mathematical world , remains still without a Chair in the University which he adorns with his presence and his name ) , is the Jacobian to the differential coefficients of a homogeneous function of any number of variables .
It is to a Jacobian what a Bezoutoid is to a Bezoutiant , or a Discriminant to a Resultant .
Hyperdeterminants.-See Memoir of Mr. CAYLEY , Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal , May 1845 , and CRELLE'S Journal of about the same date .
Improper , continued fraction is a continued fraction differing only from an ordinary one in the circumstance of negative signs being substituted for positive signs to connect the terms .
Inertia.--The unchangeable number of integers in the excess of positive over negative signs which adheres to a quadratic form expressed as the sum of positive and negative squares , notwithstanding any real linear transformations impressed upon such form .
Intercalations.-The theory of intercalations is the theory of the relative distribution of the real roots , or point-roots , of two or more equations , but in this theory the number of roots mutually interposed is to be taken only with reference to the number 2 as a modulus .
Invariance.-The property ( under prescribed or implied conditions ) of remaining invariable .
Invariant.-A function of the coefficients of one or more forms which remains unaltered when these undergo suitable linear transformations .
42 545 Inverse.-The inverse to a given square matrix is formed by selecting in its turn each component of the given matrix , substituting unity in its place , making all the other components in the same line and column therewith zero , and finally writing the value of the determinant corresponding to the matrix thus modified in lieu of the selected component .
If the determinant to the matrix be equal to unity , its second inverse , i. e. the inverse to its inverse , will be identical , term for term , with the original matrix .
Jacobian.-The Jacobian to n homnogeneous functions of n variables is the determinant represented by the symmetrical collocation in a square of the n differential coefficients of each of the n functions .
Kenotheme.-A finite system of discrete points defined by one or more homogeneous equations in number one less than the number of variables contained therein .
Limiting Series.-One set of quantities whose extreme values are exterior to the extreme values of a second set is set to limit the latter .
Matrix.-A square or rectangular arrangement of terms in lines and columns .
Minor Determinant.-Any determinant retained represented by a square group of terms arbitrarily chosen out of a matrix is a minor determinant thereto .
The simple terms of the matrix are the last minors , and of course if the matrix is a square , it will itself in its totality represent a single complete determinant .
Monotheme.--A line , or finite system of lines , defined by one or more homogeneous equations two less in number than the numbers of the variables contained therein .
Order.-The orders of a homogeneous function are the linear functions of the variables the least in number by aid of which the function admits of being expressed .
Persymmetrical.-A symmetrical matrix , in which all the terms in the diagonal bands transverse to the axis of symmetry are identical , is said to be persymmetrical .
Ex. An addition table .
Quadrinvariant.-An invariant of which the terms are quadratic functions of the coefficients of the primitive .
Relation ( simple and compound ) .
Vide Substitution , infra .
Resultant.-The resultant of n homogeneous general functions of n variables is that function of their coefficients which , equalled to zero , expresses in the simplest terms the condition of the possibility of their coexistence .
Rhizoristic.-A rhizoristic series is a series of disconnected functions which serve to fix the number of real roots of a given function lying between any assigned limits .
Signaletic.-A signaletic or Semaphoretic series is a sequence of disjunctive terms , considered solely with reference to the algebraical signs of plus and minus which they respectively carry .
Singular.-A proper algebraical function of a given degree , in , in one variable in its most general form , will , in respect to that variable , be of the nth degree in the denominator and .
the ( n-I)th degree in the numerator , and will admit of being represented by a continued algebraical fraction of n terms , all of them linear .
But for particular values of , or relations among , the coefficients entering into the given fraction this mode of representation fails , and the continued fraction , instead of consisting of linear terms 546 n in number , will consist of terms , some of them at least , non-linear , and fewer than n in number .
These then are the singular cases ( or cases of singularity ) in the theory of the development of an algebraical fraction under the continued fraction form ; and it will be seen that according to this definition the case of the development of any proper algebraical fraction in which the degree of the numerator is more than one unit below that of the denominator , belongs ( strictly speaking ) to the class of singular cases ; and this view of the case supposed is perfectly correct and conformable to the analogies of the subject .
Substitution ( linear , similar or contrary).-A linear substitution is said to be impressed upon a system of variables when each variable is replaced by a linear conjunctive of all the variables .
The matrix formed by the coefficients of substitution arranged in regular order is called the Matrix of Substitution , and is of course a square .
When two substitutions ( impressed in two systems of variables ) have the same matrix , they are said to be similar and contrary when their matrices are contrary , i. e. mutually inverse to each other .
When two systems of variables are supposed to be subject to the condition that their substitutions are always similar or always contrary , they are said to be related or in simple relation , the relation being of cogredience in the one case and of contragredience in the other .
When a linear substitution is impressed upon a system of independent variables , a corresponding linear substitution is necessarily impressed at the same time upon every complete system of homogeneous combinations ( i. e. products and powers and products of powers ) of these variables , the matrix to which latter substitution will consist of terms which will be functions ( depending upon the degree of the homogeneous combinations ) of the terms of the matrix to the primitive substitution .
This matrix may be termed a compound matrix , having the primitive matrix for its base .
If , now , two systems of independent variables are subjecttto be synchronously impressed with substitutions , the matrices to which ( not being both of them simple matrices ) have for their bases matrices which are either similar or contrary , these two systems will be said to be in compound relation of cogredience in the one case , and of contragredience in the other .
Syrrhizoristic.-A syrrhizoristic series is a series of disconnected functions which serve to determine the effective intercalations of the real roots of two functions lying between any assigned limits .
Syzygetic.-A syzygetic function or conjunctive of a number of given rational integral functions is the sum of these affected respectively with arbitrary functional multipliers , which are termed the syzygetic multipliers .
When a syzygetic function of a given set of functions can be made to vanish , they are said to be syzygetically related .
Transform.-Equivalent to the French noun substantive " transformee .
" Tvpe.-The type of a cumulant is the series of the simple elements ( or quotients ) , arranged in a fixed order , of which the cumulant is composed .
Umrnbral.-The umbral notation is a notation according to which simple quantities are denoted by syllables , instead of by single letters ( the composition of these syllables being governed by the mode in which the quantities which they express are obtained ) ; and the single letters of such syllables are termed umbral quantities or umnbrce .
Weight .
In this memoir ( throughout the earlier sections ) the weight of any quantity composed of the product of the coefficients of any given function or functions of x is used to denote the number of roots of x appertaining to the given function or functions which must be employed to express such quantity .
More generally , when dealing with a system of homogeneous functions , the weight of a quantity may be defined with respect to any selected variable therein as the sum of the weights in respect to such variable of the several coefficients of which the quantity is composed ( the weight of each several coefficient meaning the index of the power of the selected variable in that term of the given function or functions which is affected with such coefficient ) .
These two definitions of weight may be perfectly well reconciled with each other by understanding the weight of a quantity formed from the coefficients of a function or system of functions of x to mean the weight , in respect to unity , of such quantity when the given functions are treated as homogeneous functions of x and 1 .
Zeta.-The symbol g ( preceding a row of bracketed terms ) is used to denote the product of the squared differences of the terms which it affects .
[ ] .
A bracket of this form , when enclosing a superior and an inferior row of terms m and n in number respectively , indicates the mn prodiucts of the differences obtained by subtracting each term in the second row from each term in the first row ; when enclosing an arrangement of terms in a single line , it is used to denote the cumulant of which such an arrangement is the type .
