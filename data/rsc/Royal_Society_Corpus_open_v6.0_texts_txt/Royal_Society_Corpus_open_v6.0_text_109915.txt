On the Structure of the Poisonous Fangs of Serpents .
By Thomas Smith , Esq. F.R.S. Read June 4 , 1818 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1818 , p. 471 .
] The object of this paper is to explain the existence of a slit in the fangs of serpents , extending from the foramen at the base to the aperture near the point , and to show that this slit is caused by the manner in which the tube through which the poison flows is formed .
After describing the growth of the teeth of poisonous serpents , the author observes , that in those which are not venomous , there are no traces of any furrow or depression .
A drawing , illustrating the author 's description , is annexed to this paper .
