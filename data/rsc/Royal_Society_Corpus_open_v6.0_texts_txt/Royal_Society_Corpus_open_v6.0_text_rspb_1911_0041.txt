) In Primula sinensis the short style is dominant to the long style , and the magenta colour of the flower is dominant to the red colour .
Some years ago a series of experiments was made , in which a red short-styled race was mated with various long-styled plants carrying the factor for magenta colour .
In F2 from these crosses , only three kinds of offspring were obtained , namely : ( 1 ) magenta , short-styled ; ( 2 ) magenta , long-styled ; ( 3 ) red , short-styled .
No red long-styled offspring were produced.* This result shows that , in the gametogenesis of the Fi , complete repulsion took place between the factors for the two dominant characters , magenta and short style .
In another series of crosses which have been made recently , a short-styled race carrying the magenta factor was crossed with two races of long-styled reds .
The results obtained in F2 show that , when the cross is made in this way , a partial coupling occurs between the factors for the two dominant characters .
One of the long-styled races used in these experiments was a red , with double flowers and green stigmas .
In the two F2-families raised from the crosses of this race with the short-styled race , the partial coupling observed is almost entirely certainly of the form 7 :1:1 : 7 .

24 10 12 1 1 47 The second long-styled race used was a dark red with red stigmas .
In the families obtained from the crosses of this race with the short-styled race , the distribution of the offspring in the four classes is much less simple than in the preceding case ; there is an excess of magentas and of short-styled plants , and the form which the partial coupling takes is not certain .
The only family raised from the Fi self-fertilised , containing as it did a large number of plants with colourless fiowrers , was too small to give any indication of the form of the coupling .
The reciprocal crosses between the Fi and the recessive parent race give results which are almost exactly intermediate between the expectation based on the series 7:1:1:7 and that based on the series 15 :1:1:15 .
It is further to be noticed that in these families there is clear evidence that the factor for magenta is partially coupled , not only with the factor for short style , but also with a third factor , which has the effect of suppressing the development of pigment in the stigma , giving rise to the dominant green stigma .
The partial coupling which is shown in this case is of a much lower type than that which obtains between magenta and short style , and , as in previous experiments , * does not exactly conform to any known series .
The fact that the magenta factor takes part in two systems of coupling , one of which is of an undetermined form , renders the results complex .
Further data are required for their complete analysis , particularly in regard to the effect which the twq/ systems of coupling , in combination , may have upon the distribution of the factors for short style and green stigma among the offspring .
When the offspring are classified according to these two characters , the numbers observed are irregular , there being an excess of plants bearing the dominant characters .

64 | 35 n 30 44 173 Another instance of complete repulsion between two factors has been met with this year .
The factors in question are : ( 1 ) a factor which effects 1911 .

15 the partial suppression of colour in the stem , and gives rise to the dominant light stems ( pallifying factor ) , and ( 2 ) the factor , previously mentioned , which completely suppresses colour in the stigma .
The repulsion between these two factors was observed in the progeny of a cross in which a plant having red stems and red stigma was mated with a plant which was almost devoid of colour in the stem and had the dominant green stigma .
The F2 from this cross contained a long series of forms , and included plants having stems much darker in colour than those of the redstemmed parent .
The green-stemmed parent was therefore without the pallifying factor .
Certain individuals of the F2 were tested by self-fertilisation , and three of them , all having light red stems and green stigmas , gave F3 families in which the complete repulsion between the pallifying factor and the factor for green stigma was shown , in the fact that none of the offspring with dark stems had red stigmas .
The numbers obtained in the three families are shown below .
