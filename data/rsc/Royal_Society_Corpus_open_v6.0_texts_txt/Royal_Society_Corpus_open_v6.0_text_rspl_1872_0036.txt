( Abstract .
) The principal obiect of the present Memoir is the establishment of the partial diflerential equalion of the third order satisfied by the parameter of a family of surfaces belonging to a triple orthogonal system .
It first remarked by Bouquet tha a given family of surfaces does not general belong to orthogonal system , but that ( in order to its doing so ) a condition must be satislied : it was afterwards shown by Serret that the condition is that the parameter considered as a function of the coormust satisfy a partial differential equation of the third order ; this equation was not obtained by him or the other French geometers engaged on the subiect , although methods of obtaining it , essentially equvalent but differing in form , were given by Darboux and Levy ; the last-named writer even found a particular form of the equation , .
what the general equation becomes on writing therein the first derived functions , or quantities proportional to the cosine-iucli1873 .
