Observations made with the invariable pendulum ( No. 4 .
JONES ) , at the Royal Observatory , Cape of Good Hope , for the purpose of determining the compression of the earth .
By the REV .
FEARON FALLOWS , F.R.S. Astronomer of the Cape Observatory .
Communicated by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty .
Read February 18 , 1830 .
TIHE important problem of ascertaining the ellipticity of the earth has , for a long time past , drawn forth the talents and labours of some of the most scientific men in Europe ; and it still continues to be deemed an object of especial regard by all who feel an interest in the promotion of natural knowledge .
To attempt to depict the strenuous exertions , the innumerable fatigues , the ardour for the improvement of science , which actuated so many illustrious persons in endeavouring to discover the true figure of the earth , would only be a waste of time ; as learned Societies have always recognised and stamped the due meed of merit to each , and invariably appreciated and published to the world the valuable results which have with so many difficulties been obtained .
The nations of Europe , emulous of each other in a work which particularly distinguishes the acquirements of modern times , have encouraged and laudably given their protection and sanction to eminent individuals engaged in undertakings so conducive to the honour of an enlightened community .
Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the respective values to be attached to observations in the admeasurement of an arc of the meridian , or by the variation in the lengths of the seconds pendulum made in different latitudes , there can be no doubt that the former has this paramount advantage ; that certain fixed points are determined , by which the geography of a country is considerably promoted , and at length brought as nearly as possible to perfection : whilst the latter method possesses a superiority in being able to concentrate under the immediate eye of the observer the results of his inquiries , which are readily obtained , and easily performed and accomplished .
The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having furnished this observatory with the invariable pendulum ( No. 4 .
JONES ) , which had for several years been most strictly examined by Captain SABINE at Mr. BROWNE'S , in Portland Place , London , and subsequently by the same learned gentleman in the course of his inquiries in different parts of the earth , I wished at the earliest opportunity to have a series of experiments made upon it , which might unite every possible degree of accuracy on the part of the observers , as well as the utmost stability in the structure intended for supporting the pendulum .
From many unforeseen circumstances , I found at length that the completion of this observatory would be delayed for a considerable time , though previously I had , too fondly perhaps , anticipated finishing it at a much earlier period ; and I therefore took advantage of a small out-house ( then of no further use ) within a short distance of the building , to erect a stout brick pier , well bonded , for the support of the small transit instrument ; the same which I used in forming my catalogue of 273 southern stars reduced to the beginning of 1824 .
Temporary chases were made for meridian observations ; and the recess for the clock ( MOLYNEUX'S * ) and pendulum was soon constructed in a most substantial manner within a few feet of the transit .
The top of this recess consisted of a thick strong Robben-Island stone , perforated in the middle , and chiselled out at the upper part , for the reception of the brass plate containing the agate planes upon which the knife-edges of the pendulum rest .
This plate was securely fastened to the stone with cement ; and I found that when the agates were once truly adjusted to level , they remained ( with one exception only , and I think this might be attributed to some error in one of the small levels , ) during the whole of the observations that succeeded .
It is hardly worthy of remark that at the end of each day 's work the knife-edges were screwed up from the agates , and remained so till the commencement of another series on the first favourable opportunity .
The clock ( adjusted to sidereal time and corrected for rate by the stars , ) was placed in the recess , having the bottom of the case resting upon a large block of stone embedded in well-wrought clay , and the back of the case was tightly screwed to a strong piece of well seasoned wood let into the wall .
I have little doubt but that the good going of the clock was by these means in a great measure secured .
On each side of the pendulum , somewhat above the middle of it , were suspended two of JONES'S thermometers .
The disk was formed of a small circle of card paper about three-tenths of an inch in diameter , this measure being found to be the best and most convenient .
Instead of the wooden stand for supporting the small telescope , through which the coincidences , or rather the disappearances and re-appearances of the pendulum-rod and the disk are noted , as well as the magnitude of the arc of vibration , a small thick brick pier was raised so as to receive the plate to which the telescope is attached .
The usual adjustments of the clock , pendulum and telescope , being completed , we were now ready to commence .
I here deem it right to notice the very able assistance which I received from Captain RONALD : his exertions were truly praiseworthy ; I cannot recommend them too highly .
I likewise avail myself of paying a just tribute to the aid which was afforded by Lieutenant JOHNSON , of the Honourable East India Company 's Service , now superintendent of the observatory at St. Helena .
This gentleman being on a visit to me , very kindly at my request took an active part in all the observations .
The sheets accompanying this short paper must be considered as the united labours of Captain RONALD , Mr. JOHNSON , and myself , and the responsibility of each as to accuracy must depend upon the papers signed with the observer 's name .
As far as I am able to judge of these things , the near agreement of three independent series of observations is no small argument of their accuracy .
It must not for a moment be conceived that I reckon our results as in any way final in the determination of the compression of the earth , inasmuch as it would be advisable to begin a new series of observations ( say ) in the midst of winter , or what would be better , in different seasons of the year , lest the coefficient for temperature might require some correction ; though even this test can hardly be supposed , from the experiments made by Captain SABINE on this very pendulum in London , to be required .
I have ever been of opinion , ( how far correct or not , I leave others to judge , ) that the invariable pendulum ought x2 to be a standard instrument in an observatory ; that it should be swung at all seasons of the year ; that it would be proper to forward it on authorized occasions to the various fixed observatories now situated in the northern and southern hemispheres ; that the instrument should return again to the same stations as before , and the observations be renewed ; that , finally , after each circuit it should undergo a strict examination at the spot where it was first tried , in order that it might proceed again as before .
Should any harm take place from improper packing or accidental circumstances , the evil would be soon discovered , and the instrument repaired .
The pendulum is of a very delicate construction , and consequently it is the more necessary that it should be as often as possible compared at those points where it has previously been used .
Formulae used in computing the Observations .
a= greater , and b the lesser arc observed at the beginning and end of each set of coincidences .
t= mean of the thermometers immediately adjacent to the pendulum .
H= height of the barometer .
r height of the attached thermometer .
It must be remarked that the sidereal day is reduced to a mean solar day for comparison in London .

am aware that this compression somewhat differs from that obtained in the Southern Hemisphere by Sir THOMAS BRISBANE , at Paramatta , though it is nearly in accordance with M. FREYCINET'S observations in Cape Town .
The documents , however , are here given , and I have every hope that they may meet the public eye , and undergo the usual test of candid and liberal criticism .

P. S. The latitude of the Observatory is not yet ascertained by actual observation with the new mural circle .
This instrument has been attached to its pier for several months past ; but from some discrepancies in reading , the cause of which is not yet discovered , I am under the necessity of assuming 33 ? ?
55 ' 56 " as a very near approximate latitude* .
The examination of the mural will go on , and the conclusions be forwarded home when some definite opinion may be formed of it .

+0.54 Remark.-From the above result , it appears that the rate varied nearly a second in the space of 24 hours : there is reason to suppose that the change was owing to some sudden derangement which the clock might have suffered on the night of the 20th .
From the tolerable accordance with each other of the pendulum observations of the 21st , it may be presumed that the rate was equable during that day .

During the second series , the weather was particularly favourable , both for observations of the transit instrument and pendulum .

= 86097.69 ... =86097.68 _8 _p.sb The observations which Mr. FALLOWS has communicated to the Society in this memoir , having been corrected for buoyancy and expansion , before the volume of the Phil. Trans. had reached the Cape , in which the true value of those corrections is assigned from experiments with a pendulum of the same materials and figuire as that einployed by Mr. FALLOWS , I have re-computed his results with the correct elements of reduction , and find the retardation of the vibrations at the Cape , compared with those in London , to be 67.15 per diem , instead of 67.12 , the difference between Mr. FALLoWS'S calculation and mine amounting only to three hundredths of a vibration per diem .
The small amount of the difference , on the employment of the more correct elements of reduction , is an illustration of the remark , with which I concluded the paper on the reduction to a vacuum of an invariable pendulum ( Phil. Trans. 1829 , page 236 .
) ; that in relative experiments , computed before the true reduction to a vacuum was known , and in which a correction for expansion was employed , derived directly from the vibration of the pendulum at the same spot in different temperatures , ( as is the case in Mr. FALLOWS'S calculation , ) a compensation takes place of the errors of the respective reductions for expansion and resistance , leaving the only uncompensated error in the final result , that arising from barometric differences , which in all cases of comparison between stations not far removed from the level of the sea , cannot be otherwise than extremely small .
In Mr. FALLOWS 's calculation he has taken the rate in London of the invariable pendulum which Captain RONALD took out to the Cape , solely from my observations with it : if , however , Captain RONALD'S observations with the same pendulum in London be added to mine , and a true mean be taken corresponding to the number of observations of each observer , the retardation is precisely that stated by Mr. FALLOWS ; namely , 67.12 vibrations per diem .
