BABBAGE , Esq. , F.R.S. , to Dr. BACHE , of Washington , May 10 , 1852 .

" In reading the account of the great solar eclipse of last year ( 1851 ) I was much struck by the description of the pink excrescences apparently attached to the sun 's disk , and connected with its spots ( see Proceedings of Royal Astronomical Society ) .
They are only visible during a few minutes in a total eclipse .
It occurred to me that it might be possible to render them visible at other times by two different methods:"1st .
By placing in the focus of an equatorial telescope moved by clockwork an opake disk , equal to or a little larger than the sun 's image .
This would represent a continuous total eclipse ; and if every known means of excluding light were adopted , it might be possible to see those faint pink objects , which are probably clouds raised by the eruption of solar volcanoes .
" 2nd .
If this fail , it might yet be possible to render them visible by taking daguerreotype or photographic images .
" It is really surprising that nobody has yet taken such images regularly , for the sake of recording the solar spots and their changes .
I have no clock-moving equatorial myself fit for these observations , nor have I time to spare for them .
" I cannot persuade my countrymen that they are important , so you are at liberty to try them , or publish the plan on your side of the Atlantic .
" Mr. Gould will probably have explained to you an old plan of mine for mapping zones of stars without moving the eye from the telescope .
