In our last communication to the Society , " On the Spectrum of the Compounds of Carbon with Hydrogen and Nitrogen , No. II , " we noticed that a remarkable series of lines , extending over the region between the lines S and R of the s'olar spectrum , were developed m the flame of coal-gas burning in oxygen .
The arrangement of lines and bands , of which this spectrum consists , is shown m the accompanying diagram , * fig. 1 .
It begins at the more refrangible end with two Fio .

] On the Spectrum of cren as well as of hydrocarbons , burning in oxygen , and less strongly in the flames of non-hydrogenous gases , such as carbonic oxide and cyanogen , if burnt in moist oxygen .
Special pains were taken to purify the gases from sulphur .
The same spectrum is given by the electric spark taken , without condenser , in moist hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , and carbonic acid gas , but it disappears if the gas and apparatus be thoroughly dried .
We are led to the conclusion that the spectrum is that of water .
The accompanying diagram , fig. 2 , shows Fig. 2 .
the apparatus used for comparing the spectra of the spark in the gases , dry and moist .
The tube in which the sparks were passed was closed at the end hby a quartz lens cemented to the glass ; c c were platinum wires sealed into the glass .
The gas was introduced through the narrow tube a , provided with a branch closed by a glass stopcock .
The gas was passed from the gas-holder through two long drying-tubes , of which the first was filled with calcium chloride , and the second with phosphoric anhydride .
The joints were all made with dry corks , in order to avoid the hydrocarbons which contaminate gases passed through rubber tubes .
The exit-tube d was armed with a tube of phosphoric anhydride , to prevent moisture entering that way .
It was necessary to pass a current of dry gas for fully an hour through the warmed apparatus before the moisture was sufficiently expelled .
When this was done , photographs of the spark showed either no trace , or only the faintest traces , of the spectrum above described .
On now introducing a drop of water through stopcock in the branch at a , and letting it spread over a plug of asbestos placed in the tube at the current of gas of course passed into the sparking tube moist instead of dry ; and on now passing the spark , the spectrum above described at once imprinted itself on the photographic plate .
The effect was the same , whether the gas used were hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , or carbonic acid .
In the case of nitrogen , some of the channelled bands due to that gas overlap the water spectrum , and partly obscure it , but not so much but that it can be still very distinctly recognised .
When a condenser is used , the water spectrum disappears .
The same spectrum 2 s 2 P ?

[ June 10 , seems to appear in the De Meritens arc , hat is much less fully developed .
The spectrum we have figured does not by any means exhaust the ultra-violet spectra of the flames we have observed , hut it is as much as we have been able at present to observe closely and to trace to water as its cause .
In writing of this and other spectra which we have traced to be due to compounds , we abstain from speculating upon the particular molecular condition or stage of combination or decomposition , which may give rise to such spectra .
The interest of finding an ultra-violet spectrum of water in a flame at all seemed to justify our laying before the Society so much as we have already determined .
It opens up questions as to the emissive power for radiation of short wave-length of gaseous substances at the comparatively low temperatures of flames , with regard to which we are accumulating facts , which we propose to discuss in a future communication .
It is obvious , however , that this opens up a very large and extensive field of inquiry which will necessitate great precautions in the conduct of the experiments ; for instance , we are not prepared to guarantee that oxides of nitrogen from traces of air may not have something to do with some parts of the spectrum here described .
Such facts as we have placed before the Society will completely modify the inferences which have been drawn as to the assumed continuity of flame spectra even under compression , and as to the character of the specific absorption of the vapour of water .
