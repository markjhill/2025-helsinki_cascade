Flannel " On the Mechanical Stretching of Liquids : an Experimental Determination of the Volume-Extensibility of Ethyl Alcohol .
" By A. M. Worthington , M.A. Communicated by Professor Pointing , F.R.S. Received February 1,1892 .
( Abstract .
) After adverting to the three known methods of subjecting a liquid tension , viz. , ( i ) the method of the inverted barometer , ( ii ) the vol. l. 2 G 424 On the Mechanical Stretching of Liquids .
[ Feb. 4 , centrifugal method devised by Osborne Reynolds , ( iii ) the method of cooling discovered in 1850 by Berthelot , and pointing out that the fit-st two afford means of measuring stress but not strain , while the third gives a measure of strain but not stress , the author proceeds to describe the manner in which he had used the method of Berthelot in combination with a new mode of determining the stress , and had succeeded in obtaining simultaneous measures of tensile stress and strain for ethyl alcohol up to a tension of more than 17 atmospheres , or 255 lbs. per square inch .
The liquid , deprived of air by prolonged boiling , is sealed in a strong glass vessel , which it almost fills at a particular temperature , the residual space being occupied only by vapour .
On raising the temperature , the liquid expands and fills the whole .
On now lowering the temperature , the liquid is prevented from contracting by its adhesion to the walls of the vessels , and remains distended , still filling the whole and exerting an inward pull on the walls of the vessel .
The tension exerted is measured by means of the change in capacity of the ellipsoidal bulb of a thermometer sealed into the vessel and called the " tonometer .
" This bulb becomes slightly more spherical , and therefore more capacious , under the pull of the liquid , and the mercury in the tonometer stem falls .
The tension corresponding to the fall is previously determined from observation of the rise produced by an equal pressure applied over the same surface .
The liquid is caused at any desired instant to let go its hold and spring back to the unstretched volume corresponding to its temperature and to its saturated vapour-pressure by heating for a moment , by means of an electric current , a fine platinum wire passing transversely through the capillary tube that forms part of the vessel .
The space left vacant in the tube represents the apparent extension uncorrected for the yielding of the glass vessel .
The measures obtained show that , within the limits of observational error , the stress and this appparent strain are proportional up to the highest tension reached ( 17 atmospheres ) ; but , since the small yielding of the nearly rigid glass vessel must itself be proportional to the stress , it follows that the stress and absolute strain are proportional .
By subjecting the liquid to a pressure of 12 atmospheres in the same vessel , it was found that the apparent compressibility was the same as the apparent extensibility , whence it is deduced that between pressures of +12 and \#151 ; 17 atmospheres the absolute coefficient of elasticity is , within the limits of observational error , constant .
Its actual value is best obtained by observations of compressibility .
The paper concludes with a description and explanation of a peculiar phenomenon of adhesion between two solids in contact when immersed in a liquid that is subjected to tension .
