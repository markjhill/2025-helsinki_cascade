( Abstract .
) This communication contains the results of an inquiry made to -determine the constitution of the heptane which one of them found in the resinous exudation from Pinus Sabiniana .
The pure heptaue was -converted into a mixture of chlorides , and these were transformed into the corresponding primary and secondary alcohols .
The alcohol was then oxidised , and from the analysis of the silver salts it was proved that Pinus heptane had yielded primary heptyl alcohol and methyl-pentyl-carbinol , exactly as in the case of heptane from petroleum .
A second portion of the chlorides was converted into heptylene , boiling at 98*5 ' , which , unlike the hexylene of analogous constitution , combines only slowly with hydrochloric acid .
The heptylene by oxidation was shown to be butyl-methyl- , C4H9CH CH .
CH3 ; it had been formed from the secondary heptyl chloride C4H9\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CHCl .
CHg .
The results of the investigation afford further evidence of the fact that when chlorine acts upon a normal paraffin , not all the chlorides indicated by theory are'formed , but only the primary chloride , and a secondary chloride , which contains the group CHCl .
