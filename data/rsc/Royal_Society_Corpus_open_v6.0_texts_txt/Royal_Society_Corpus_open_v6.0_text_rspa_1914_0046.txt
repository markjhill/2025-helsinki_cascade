The Rate of Solution of Hydrogen Palladium .

) In two recent communications* the view has been advanced that in hydrogen-palladium the dissolved gas cannot be regarded as homogeneously distributed , and that solution takes place through the medium of an amorphous metallic phase which acts as a vehicle for the transference of gas to idle crystalline metal .
Experiments have been described from which it is con eluded that in hydrogen-palladium one is dealing with a case of simultaneous adsorption and solution ( or sorption ) , since as soon as any gas is adsorbed solution begins through diffusion from the adsorbed layer .
The adsorption Equilibrium would be rapidly established , too quickly , perhaps , for any record of its rate to be measured , but could such observation 's be made it might be expected that the following relation would hold dejdt = where C is the concentration in the adsorbed layer and Je and n constants depending on the nature Of the adsorbent and the substance adsorbed , the rate of adsorption of a gas at constant pressure varying with the concentration of the gas in the adsorbed layer .
If , therefore , the adsorbed layer is maintained at constant concentration by surrounding it with an unlimited supply of gas at constant pressure , the rate of inward diffusion from it could be measured .
Thus a complete rate of solution curve should consist of two portions , the first representing adsorption and the second inward diffusion , the two coinciding when the rate of adsorption equals the rate of diffusion .
Should there be no adsorption , or should the dispersivity be so great that the metal may be regarded entirely as surface , then only one phenomenon would be present , and a curve representing the rate of solution of gas should show no discontinuity of curvature .
It might , of course , be impossible to observe the changes of rate with concentration for the initially adsorbed gas , since adsorption is usually regarded as an exceedingly rapid process , and * Holt , Edgar , and Firth , ' Zeit .

The Rate of Solution of Hydrogen hy Palladium .
227 hence a smooth rate-concentration curve need not necessarily imply the absence of all but one phenomenon .
It has already been mentioned that there is evidence that solution of gas takes place through the intermediary of an allotropic and probably amorphous phase of the metal .
The solubility of hydrogen in this phase ( which throughout this paper will be called a-palladium , the other phase being called / 3-palladium ) may be far more rapid than in the stable / 3-variety , though the solubility of hydrogen in the two forms may be nearly the same .
Were this the case , then a rate-concentration curve should at first give values for the solution in a-palladium until this rate had decreased to and equalled that in the / 3-modification , the subsequent portion of the curve representing the change of concentration per unit time in this latter form of the metal .
The graphs obtained under these conditions would resemble in their general form those for simultaneous adsorption and solution , except that the first portion of the curve would be more drawn out , since it is highly improbable that saturation of a-palladium would take place as rapidly as true adsorption .
There is , however , no real distinction except in degree between the two cases .
If one imagines the a-metal as a film on a mass of the / 3-form , then if the rate of solution of gas in a- and / 3-palladium is very different , the phenomenon of adsorption might be simulated .
In the present communication an attempt has been made to determine the rate of solution-concentration curves for hydrogen at constant pressure in different forms of palladium and under different conditions , in order to investigate further the phenomenon of the solution of hydrogen in this metal .
The apparatus employed is illustrated in fig. 1 .
The palladium was contained in the bulb A which , by means of the three-way tap B , could be put into communication either with the pump , or with the supply of hydrogen , or with the long tube CD , which ended in the TO PUMP TO HYDROGEN K SUPPLY Dr. A. Holt .
reservoir F , and was filled with a liquid paraffin of low vapour pressure .
The tube CD had a uniform bore of about 4 mm. , and was somewhat more than 400 cm .
in length .
It was graduated throughout its entire length , and was somewhat raised at one end so as to ensure a sharp meniscus to the liquid running up it .
The method of conducting an experiment was as follows :\#151 ; A weighed amount of metal was sealed in the bulb A , and , the reservoir F being empty , the air through the apparatus was at atmospheric pressure .
The tap K was then closed , and B turned so as to permit the evacuation of the space HKB by the pump .
This being accomplished B was further turned , and the dead space in A evacuated , its volume being determined by reducing the collected gas to N.T.P. The taps H and B being now shut , hydrogen was allowed to fill the space HKB , A meanwhile remaining evacuated .
The reservoir F being now filled with liquid , E was opened , and a stream of hydrogen passed through CD for several hours so as to displace completely the air it contained .
Finally the tap K was shut , and the position of the liquid in CD being noted on the scale , B was turned so as to place the metal in contact With the gas in CD .
The liquid at once moved rapidly along the scale on account of the vacuum ifi A , but the volume of the dead space having been determined in terms of scale divisions along CD , the point at which readings of the rate of solution cduld be commenced was at once ascertainable .
The rate measured was the time taken by the liquid to travel one division oil the scale , and determinations were made throughout its length at points representing known concentrations of gas in the metal .
The gas was maintained at an almost constant pressure during the experiment , since the diameter of the reservoir F was so great that the total volume of liquid required to fill the tube CD did not alter the surface level by more than a few millimetres , and the specific gravity of the paraffin employed being somewhat less than that of water , the small apparent error arising from changes in the level of the liquid in F was diminished .
The solution of gas in the metal caused a rise of temperature in A which operated in two ways , on the one hand hastening the rate of occlusion by heating the metal , on the other hand expanding the gas in A and causing a check to the rate at which the liquid would travel along CD .
The former of these effects was obviated as far as possible by placing A in a water-bath at constant temperature , while the latter was rendered quite negligible by making the dead space in A so small in comparison to the volume of CD that any expansion of the small volume would have no material effect on the total volume of gas in the apparatus .
The Rate of Solution of Hydrogen by Palladium .
229 A further source of error might arise from the viscosity of the liquid causing a lag in the rate of its advance along the scale during a period of rapid occlusion of gas .
Some experiments were therefore carried out with different liquids , hut though the viscosity has an undoubted effect in any one experiment , it caused little error in the relative values of a series .

An examination of these graphs shows that at ordinary temperatures ( 15 ' C ) there is , except in the case of palladium black , a more or less Dr. A. Holt .
pronounced deflection of the curve , not , however , always coinciding with a constant concentration of gas in the metal .
The curves may be considered as composite , two of similar general form being partially superimposed .
Thus in the case of thin foil the initial portion may be taken to represent the region where the first curve merges into Vol. of gas occluded by 1 vol. of metal .

These curves cannot be expressed by any simple formula , but the relation120 240 360 Vol. of gas occluded by 1 vol. of metal .

ship between the rate of occlusion and the total concentration of gas in ' , the metal appears in general to be represented by such an expression as dc/ dt as KC* where n is not a constant , but varies as a function of C Neither has n a constant value for any particular form of the metal , for in the tables of rate 234 Dr. A. Holt .
values given above it is seen that with the same specimen of metal very different rates are obtained .
This variation of rate for the same sample of palladium is no new observation , but taken in conjunction with the fact that in the above expression varies also with C , precludes the possibility of representing the curves by any simple expression which has a definite physical meaning .
Since n is not a constant , no information as to the molecular condition of the dissolved gas is obtained from the rate of solution values , but the view of Travers and Zacharias that one is really dealing with a diffusion column appears to receive support .
The phenomena can be imagined as follows :\#151 ; Initially , a certain amount of condensation on the exterior of the metal may take place very rapidly , far too quickly , indeed , to be detected by the methods employed in this investigation .
The surface of the metal possessing , however , a very porous and irregular structure , an appreciable time would be taken by the gas to diffuse into its interstices , this diffusion representing the initial portion of the curves for palladium foil .
Since , however , after a sufficiently long time has elapsed , gas is found in the interior of the metal , it must be assumed that a more intimate kind of solution must take place immediately beneath the surface .
Here the gas would no longer be merely penetrating into the fissures between metallic grains but would be actually entering the grains themselves , passing into solution , for solution and intramolecular diffusion in such a case as this are the same .
This would represent the second portion of the rate of solution curves .
For convenience , we may call the initial phenomenon surface diffusion and associate it with a-palladium , and the second solution in the / 3-metal , and in both cases the rate would diminish with increasing total concentration of gas in the metal , since the smaller and more sinuous the passages became into which the gas was passing , the longer would be the time taken , and to the diffusion effects would be added those of transpiration .
A simple logarithmic relation between the rate of solution and concentration of gas within the metal could therefore hardly be expected .
Any attempt to explain the observed phenomena of the rate of solution must , however , take cognisance of the fact that , so far as is known , the pressure-temperature-concentration relations of hydrogen in palladium do not greatly change with different forms of the metal ( the experiments of Paal and Gerum* on colloidal palladium excepted ) , and that palladium black is always active towards hydrogen , whereas the stable condition of the crystalline metal is nearly inactive .

The Rate of Solution of Hydrogen by * 235 and solution is added that of an a- and / 3-form of the metal , the observed phenomena can be explained .
In order to account for the constancy of the temperature-pressure-concentration relations , it must be assumed that to each molecule of metal can be associated a Certain definite quantity of hydrogen , such quantity varying with the pressure and temperature of the gas .
The gas may be regarded as a skin on the metallic particles .
Now , if these particles are arranged haphazard , it will be far easier for the gas to diffuse among them and saturate them than if the particles were close packed in some crystalline orientation .
In palladium black , which is believed to be amorphous , the particles probably possess little regular arrangement , so the most favourable condition for rapid saturation is presented , and , unless the particles become close packed through crystallisation , there is no reason why the activity or power of rapid saturation of the metal should diminish .
The more completely crystalline the metal , the greater should be the difficulty experienced by the gas in entering it , a fact of common observation ; a-palladium is therefore imagined as the form with the least regularly orientated and close-packed particles , ^-palladium being truly holOerystalline , but the actual phenomenon of solution is the same in either case .
If in palladium black the particles are loosely and irregularly arranged , there would be little , if any , distinction between surface condensation and intramolecular diffusion , the interstices of the surface becoming narrower and narrower and more and more sinuous , till they became spaces between irregularly arranged metallic particles .
Hence a rate of solution curve should show no break .
When , however , the gas , after condensing in the surface irregularities , finds itself in contact with metal , the particles of which are in the main close packed , the rate of diffusion would change .
It appears from a large number of experiments that the deflection of the rate curve occurs almost invariably after the metal has been exposed to the gas for about the same interval of time , and that it does not depend on the amount of gas already dissolved .
In a series of nine experiments with thick foil , in which the rate of solution varied greatly from one experiment to the next , the time interval before the deflection was found to vary from 13 to 16 minutes , with a mean value of about 15 minutes .
Assuming the view that solution of gas depends on the primary saturation of a-palladium , it must be concluded that , after about a quarter of an hour , the rate of solution of gas by the a-form equals the rate at which / 3-palladium receives gas by diffusion from-that variety .
If the a-phase was uniformly exposed to the gas at constant pressure , it would acquire a definite saturation in a definite 236 The Rate of Solution of Hydrogen hy Palladium .
time , quite irrespective of the amount of phase present , for the actual volume of gas absorbed would increase in direct proportion to the amount of the a-phase .
It is improbable that thermal effects arising from the condensation of the hydrogen have any marked effect under the conditions of the experiment , as , owing to the fact that the bulb containing the metal was kept in circulating cold water , its temperature scarcely rose except during the first two or three minutes .
Turning now to the curves in which the metal was allowed to cool in hydrogen , two distinct types are observed , according as the metal had previously been heated , either in vacuo or in the gas .
When the metal which has been heated in vacuo to a dull red heat , and to which hydrogen has been admitted at this temperature , is allowed to cool in the gas , curves very similar to those already described are obtained .
A deflection in this curve has always been observed .
When , however , the metal , after previous saturation with hydrogen , is heated and then allowed to cool in the gas , there is no indication in the rate of solution curve of any irregularity .
The rate falls extremely rapidly , though after a long enough interval of time the same amount of gas may in each case be retained by the metal .
The hypothesis already put forward provides an explanation of this difference in behaviour .
When the metal is heated in the gas , after initial saturation in the cold , hydrogen is evolved , but the palladium still remains saturated , the solubility of gas decreasing with rise of temperature , so that , when the metal is allowed to cool , it is already saturated , though the actual volume of dissolved gas is but small .
It appears probable that this gas is dissolved in the / 3-metal , for on cooling either this saturated palladium , or metal to which hydrogen has been admitted at a dull red heat , the initial portions of the solution curve are very similar , and are characterised by a rapid diminution of rate .
Now in this latter case the solution curve again shows a deflection , the phenomena being the same as during solution in the cold , where the a-phase is the initial solvent .
The full cycle of the solution phenomena during heating and cooling may be imagined thus : Palladium in the cold first dissolves gas in its a- , and then in its / 3-phase .
Eventually there is complete saturation .
On heating , gas is evolved though the metal remains saturated as regards the / 3-phase .
Solution again occurs in the a-phase on cooling , but the metal already containing a large volume of gas , the diffusion from the a- to the / 3-phase is so slow that it does not produce any marked irregularity in the rate curve .
When , however , hydrogen is initially admitted to the hot metal solution first takes place in the a- and subsequently in the / 8-phase exactly as during , solution in the cold .
Functional Equation employed by Sir George StoJces .
23 If diffusion from the a- to the / 3-phase is slow under even favourable circumstances , it follows that if the / 3-phase already contains gas the rate may become almost unmeasurable , for , as has been shown in this communication , a small change of concentration may produce a great change in the rate of solution .
There appears , therefore , every reason to suppose that the solution of hydrogen by palladium is a phenomenon quite analogous to the cases of sorption of gases by other solids , such as charcoal and celluloid , which have already been examined by various authors .
Conclusion .
The rate of solution of hydrogen by palladium is not a simple function of the concentration of gas in the metal .
The rate curves consist of two portions ( except in the case of palladium black ) , which have been interpreted as referring to solution in two different forms of the metal .
The smooth rate curve for palladium black is taken to mean the almost complete absence of one of these forms .
