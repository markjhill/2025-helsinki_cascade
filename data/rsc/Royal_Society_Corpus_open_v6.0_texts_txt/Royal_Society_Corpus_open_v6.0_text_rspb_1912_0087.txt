) The chemical action of Bacillus cloacae on citric acid and on malic acid has not up to the present been investigated .
Since this organism is a facultative anaerobe , the experiments were undertaken with the object of ascertaining the effect of the presence of oxygen on the course of the fermentation produced .
It was found , however , that the organism could not grow on ammonium malate in the absence of oxygen , so that the observations on this subject were limited to the case of citric acid .
Emmerling ( 1 ) has described the decomposition of malic acid by B.lactis aerogenes ( Escherich ) , a very closely allied organism , and Bosworth and Prucha ( 2 ) have shown that , during the souring of milk , the citric acid present in fresh milk is converted by B. lactis aerogenes into acetic acid and carbon dioxide .
I. In investigating the chemical changes produced by the action of B. cloacae on various media , the determination of the respiratory coefficient was first undertaken .
For this purpose the apparatus described below , and shown diagrammatically in the annexed figure , was used .
Two burette tubes ( a ) and ( 6 ) , fitted with two-way taps ( Ji ) and ( i ) , are connected by a capillary tube ( c ) .
To each are attached by stout rubber tubing the pear-shaped receivers ( d ) and ( e ) .
The incubation tube ( / ) , VOL. lxxxvi.\#151 ; B. \#163 ; Mr. J. Thompson .
Action of [ Aug. 27 , containing the medium under examination , and the flask containing 50 c.c. of a 10 per cent , solution of caustic potash , are connected with the taps of the burettes as shown in the diagram , by stout rubber connections at ( t ) and ( s ) .
The interna ] capacity of the flask and incubation tube and connecting tubes between the taps ( h ) and ( i ) was determined .
Deducting the volume of medium and caustic potash solution , the volume of air contained in them at the beginning of the experiment is known .
The burettes and receivers having been charged with mercury , the c incubation tube ( , / ')\gt ; containing 10 c.c. ot the medium , previously sterilised and subsequently inoculated from a culture of B. cloacce on the same medium , is connected to the burette ( 6 ) and the absorption flask The tap ( i)is removed , and , about 80 c.c. of air having been allowed to flow into the graduated burette , the tap is replaced in connection with the tube ( / ) .
By suitable manipulation of the receivers ( d ) and ( e ) and the two-way taps , the liquid in the tubes ( m ) and ( n ) is brought to the level of the liquid m ( / ) and ( g ) .
The volume of air , thus brought to atmospheric pressure , is then read off on the burette ( b ) , the temperature and barometric pressure being carefully noted .
The tap ( h ) is now opened to the flask ( g ) , the 1912 .
] B. cloacae ( Jordan)on Citric and Malic Acids , 3 receiver ( d ) being slightly lowered to create a partial vacuum in the burette tube ( a ) .
At intervals of 24 hours , the air in the burette is swept through the apparatus into the burette ( a ) through the tube ( )by raising the receiver ( e ) and simultaneously lowering the receiver Then , by reversing the taps , it is returned to the burette ( ) through the tube ( c ) .
By thrice repeating these manipulations , the carbon dioxide produced by the growth of the organism in the medium is removed from the tube ( / ) , and absorbed by the caustic potash solution in ( ).At the conclusion of the experiment , indicated by the non-diminution of the volume of air in ( b ) , the flask ( g ) is disconnected , and the carbon dioxide determined by double titration with N/ 10 H2SO4 , using phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators .
The experiments were carried out at an approximate temperature of 37 ' .
It is essential that the burette taps be perfectly gas-tight .
The form shown in the diagram was found to be the most satisfactory and the taps used were tested against a vacuum .
As a lute , resin ointment proved to be the best for a temperature of 37 ' .
In making the readings , of which the initial and final are , of course , all important , it is essential to be quite sure that no marked alteration of temperature has taken place previous to observation .
To obviate any error from this source , three readings were made in each case at intervals of 30 minutes , and their agreement showed that the experiment was being satisfactorily carried out .
To test the apparatus , a blank experiment was made , 10 c.c. of water being placed in the tube ( / ) .

B 2 Mr. J. Thompson .
Action of [ Aug. 27 , Throughout the experiments detailed below , the air was circulated through the apparatus every 24 hours , readings being taken to check the course of the experiment .
At the conclusion of each experiment , the residual gas in the apparatus was examined gasometrically for marsh gas and hydrogen , which were in each case found to be absent .
II .
For the examination of the products resulting from the action of B. cloacae on citric and malic acids , the general method described below was employed .
The media were prepared from the acids by drying these to constant weight in vacuo over sulphuric acid , dissolving in distilled water , and , after neutralising with ammonia to convert them into their ammonium salts , adding sufficient normal sulphuric acid to give the finished product an acidity of +15 .
Acid potassium phosphate was added in the proportion of OT grm. per litre of medium .
The malic acid was present in the proportion of 6-7 grm. per litre , while , for the citric acid medium , the proportion used was 7 grm. of crystallised acid per litre , this quantity corresponding to 6 4 grm. of the anhydrous acid .
One litre of the medium was placed in a 2-litre flask , fitted with leading and delivery tubes plugged with cotton-wool .
The delivery tube was connected outside the incubator with an absorption flask provided with a soda-lime tube , to allow of exit of the excess of air or nitrogen , and containing 200 c.c. of a 10 per cent , solution of caustic potash for the absorption of the carbon dioxide produced .
After sterilisation , the medium was inoculated from a pure culture of B. cloacae on agar , and a slow current of air , free from carbon dioxide , was bubbled through the apparatus during the course of growth .
In the case of the experiments conducted in the absence of oxygen , the leading tube of the incubation flask was fitted with a three-way tap , by means of which a stream of nitrogen could be passed through the flask , after first displacing the air in the leading tube .
The nitrogen was prepared by the action of ammonia solution on copper turnings , and passed through wash-bottles containing sulphuric acid , chromous chloride solution , and , finally , caustic potash .
Growth in the incubation flask having ceased , which was found to be the case after about four weeks , the amount of carbon dioxide was determined by double titration of the caustic potash solution , and the contents of the incubation flask were examined as follows : The liquid was made up to 1 litre with distilled water , 500 c.c. were taken , made acid with 40 c.c. of normal sulphuric acid , and carefully distilled .
The first 200 c.c. of distillate were collected , titrated with normal potash , using phen olphthalein paper as indicator , and redistilled .
One hundred cubic centimetres of distillate were collected , and its specific gravity determined .
In each experiment this was found to be equal to that of water , proving the 1912.1 B. cloacae ( Jordan)on Citric and Malic Acids .
5 non-production of any notable quantity of alcohol .
The distillation of the original liquid was continued with steam , until titration of the distillate showed no further neutralisation of alkali .
The combined titrated distillates were evaporated to low bulk , made up to 100 c.c. with distilled water , and examined for " volatile acids .
Formic acid , when present , was determined by heating 10 c.c. of the solution for two hours on the water-bath with 10 c.c of a 10 per cent , solution of sodium nitrite and 50 c.c. of a saturated solution of mercuric chloride , and weighing the precipitated mercurous chloride .
From the weight found , the amount of formic acid was calculated .
The identity of the acids was established by determination of the molecular weight by means of the barium salt .
The residue in the distilling flask was concentrated to 100 c.c. , and completely extracted with ether in a continuous extraction apparatus .
The ether was distilled off , and the residue dried at 100 ' and weighed .
The identity of this residue with succinic acid was established by converting it into its barium salt .
A weighed portion was heated for one hour on the water-bath with water and excess of barium carbonate .
After filtration , the insoluble portion was well washed with hot water and the filtrate made up to 200 c.c. ; 100 c.c. of this solution were evaporated to dryness , dried , and weighed .
Conversion of this residual barium salt into barium sulphate showed it to consist of barium succinate , and proved that lactic acid is not produced by the growth of cloacae on either malic or citric acid .
Further proQf that the residue was succinic acid was afforded by the determination of its melting point and by its reaction with ferric chloride .
The amount of residual acid , i.e. the acid not used up by the organism , was determined in the residue from which the succinic acid had been extracted with ether .
This was made faintly alkaline with caustic potash , and evaporated to low bulk to get rid of ammonia .
The residue was then taken up with water , exactly neutralised with acetic acid , and barium acetate added .
Four volumes of 95 per cent , alcohol were then added , and the liquid allowed to stand overnight .
In the case of the malic acid only a faint precipitation took place , showing that all but traces of the malic acid had been used up .
In the case of citric acid , the precipitated barium salt was filtered off , washed with 63 per cent , alcohol , ignited , and finally weighed as barium sulphate , from which the amount of citric acid left was calculated .
In no case did the fermentation liquids give Vosges and Proskauer 's reaction , thus proving that methylacetylcarbinol , which is produced by the action of B. cloacae on mannitol and glucose , is not formed .

Determination of the Respiratory Coefficient .
The following tables show the results obtained with the apparatus previously described .
In each case 10 c.c. of medium were employed .
For Experiment 1 the figures are given in full , in order to show the course of the experiment ; in the following experiments only the inirtal and final readings are given , though it is to be noted that they were similarly conducted .
The day-by-day readings , are essential , as the observation of any marked irregularity in the consumption of oxygen would point to some leak in the apparatus .
The experiments were continued until the readings after an interval of 24 hours were the same .

7 The mean result of the experiments gives for malic acid a respiratory coefficient of 1*63 .
This is in good agreement with the value found from a reaction proceeding as follows :\#151 ; 3C4H605+502 = 2C2H4O2+8CO2 + 5H20 , which gives a respiratory coefficient of 8/ 5 = 1*6 .
Experiments 9 and 10 were carried out with citric acid .
The results are discussed later on ( p. 9 ) .

Chemical Action of Bacillus cloacae on Malic Acid in the Presence of Oxygen .
1 .
The only products of the action of B. cloacae on malic acid in the presence of oxygen were found to be carbon dioxide , acetic acid , succinic acid , a small amount of a fatty substance , the nature of which was not determined , and traces of alcohol .
The following tables give the results obtained .
Table I gives the actual weight , on the malic acid used up , of the various substances produced , while Table II gives the number of carbon atoms per molecule of malic acid represented by each product:\#151 ; Table I.\#151 ; Percentages .

Molecular ratio , C2H.4O2 4-25 4-06 3-21 4-62 1 3-99 The action of B. cloacae on malic acid in the presence of oxygen probably goes on in two ways : the one , an oxidation of the acid to carbon dioxide and acetic acid by atmospheric oxygen , and the other , an oxidation accompanied by reduction of a portion of the malic acid to succinic acid .
The degree of access of the oxygen during fermentation will thus account for the difference in the proportions of succinic acid formed .
Assuming that growth in a sufficient supply of oxygen leads to complete oxidation of the malic acid to carbon dioxide and acetic acid , the following equation may be put forward as representing the changes which take place :\#151 ; 304H605+502 = 2C2H4O2+8CO2+5H2O .
This gives a ratio CO2/ C2H4O2 of 4 and a respiratory coefficient of 8/ 5 = 1*6 , the latter being in good agreement with the results of the experiments previously described .
In these experiments it is to be noted that a small quantity ( 10 c.c. ) of medium is in contact throughout with a good supply of air , so that oxidation may be considered to be almost complete .
If any oxidation were due to the oxygen derived from a second molecule of malic acid , the respiratory coefficient would be increased .
On the other hand , oxidation of the acetic acid would decrease the coefficient .
The numbers actually found were T67 , 1*67 , 1*7 , 1*7 , T64 and 1*4 .
Y. Contrary to the statement of Bitter ( 2 ) , it was found that B. cloacae would not grow on ammonium malate in the absence of- oxygen .

Chemical Action of B. cloacae on Citric Acid in the Presence of Oxygen .
The substances produced from citric acid by B. cloacae in the presence of oxygen were found to be the same as from malic acid .

In contrast with the growth of B. cloacae in the presence of oxygen , that in absence of the latter results in the production of a small amount of formic acid .
There is also an increased production of acetic acid , and the molecular ratio CO2/ C2H4O2 diminishes markedly .

11 The effect of the presence of oxygen is to increase the relative proportion of carbon dioxide with respect to the acetic acid .
This may be due to the occurrence of reactions such as the following:\#151 ; ( 2 ) 4C6H807 + 2H20 + 202 = 8C2H402 + 8C02 + 2H20 .
( 3 ) 4C6H807 + 402 = 7C2H402+10CO2+2H2O .
These give the ratios shown in the following table , which also includes the numbers actually found:\#151 ; .

Summary .
( a ) Malic acid is not fermented by B. cloacoe in the absence of oxygen .
( b ) Malic acid is decomposed by B. cl in the presence of oxygen into carbon dioxide , acetic acid , and succinic acid , with traces of alcohol .
The decomposition probably goes on in two ways ; oxidation by atmospheric oxygen to carbon dioxide and acetic acid , and oxidation at the expense of another portion of the malic acid , which is thereby reduced to succinic acid .
With a good supply of air the respiratory coefficient C02/ 02 and the molecular ratio C02/ C2H402 found agree well with the values given by a reaction proceeding as follows :\#151 ; 3C4H606+o02 = 2C2H402+8C02 + 5H20 .
( c ) In contradistinction to malic acid , citric acid is fermented by B. cloacce in the absence of free oxygen .
In addition to carbon dioxide , acetic , and succinic acids , the products resulting from aerobic fermentation , formic acid is produced , while there is an increased production of acetic acid .
The molecular ratio C02/ C2H402 found agrees with the value for the following equation:\#151 ; ( 1 ) 4C6H807 + 4H20 = 9C2H402 + 6C02 .
12 Action ofB cloacae ( Jordan ) on Citric and Malic Acids .
( d)Citric acid is decomposed by B. cloacae , in the presence of oxygen into the same products as malic acid .
The values found for the respiratory coefficient and for the molecular ratio CO2/ C2H4O2 are intermediate between those required for the following equations:\#151 ; ( 2 ) 4C6H807 + 402 = 7C2H4O2+IOCO2+2H2O .
( 3 ) 4C6H807 + 2H2O + 2O2 = 8C2H4O2+8CO2+2H2O .
This is probably due to the difficulty of maintaining complete aeration of the medium during the experiment , the decomposition being therefore partly anaerobic and partly aerobic in character .
( e ) It is possible that the decomposition of citric acid by B. cloacae takes place in the same way in the presence or absence of oxygen , according to equation ( 1 ) , but that in the presence of oxygen a variable portion of the acetic acid is subsequently oxidised .
( / ) Methylacetylcarbinol , which is produced by the action of B. cloacae on mannitol and glucose , is not formed in the fermentation of malic acid or of citric acid by this organism .
