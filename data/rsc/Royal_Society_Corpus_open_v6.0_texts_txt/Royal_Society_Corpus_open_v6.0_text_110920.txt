" On the Physics of Media that are composed of free and perfectly elastic Molecules in a state of Motion .
" By J. J. Waterson , Esq. Communicated by Captain Beaufort , R.N. , F.R.S. This memoir contains the enunciation of a new theory of heat , capable of explaining the phenomena of its radiation and polarization , and the elasticity of various bodies , founded on the hypothesis of a medium consisting of a vast multitude of minute particles of matter endowed with perfect elasticity , and enclosed in elastic walls , but moving in all directions within that space , with perfect freedom , and in every possible direction .
In the course of these motions , the particles must be supposed to encounter one another in every possible manner , during an interval of time so small as to allow of their being considered infinitesimal in respect to any sensible period ; still , however , preserving the molecular vis viva constant and undiminished .
The author then enters into extensive analytical investigations ; first , of the conditions that determine the equilibrium of such a homogeneous medium , as is implied by the hypothesis , and of the laws of its elasticity ; secondly , of the physical relations of media that differ from each other in the specific weight of their molecules ; thirdly , of the phenomena that attend the condensing and dilating of media , and of the mechanical value of their molecular vis viva ; fourthly , of the resistance of media to a moving surface ; fifthly , of the vertical equilibrium of a medium surrounding a planet and constituting its atmosphere ; and lastly , of the velocity with which impulses are transmitted through a medium so constituted .
In an Appendix , the author enters into a full explanation of a table of gases and vapours , drawn up with reference to the subjects discussed in his paper .
