] The above substance was discovered by M. Julien , of Abo , in Finland , amongst the products arising out of the distillation of calcined sulphate of iron , with crude nitre in iron retorts .
It forms white acicular crystals by sublimation , and when passed through a green glass tube containing red-hot rock crystal , it is decomposed with the deposition of charcoal and evolution of chlorine .
It is not altered by repeated sublimations in chlorine .
It was analysed by passing its vapour over red-hot oxide of copper , by which chloride of copper and carbonic acid gas were produced : the former was decomposed by nitrate of silver , and the proportion of chlorine estimated by that of chloride of silver formed .
From this and other experiments , the authors conclude that this substance consists of one portion of chlorine and two of carbon : they failed in their endeavours to convert it into either of the other chlorides of carbon , to which , in its physical and chemical properties , it bears however a considerable resemblance .
