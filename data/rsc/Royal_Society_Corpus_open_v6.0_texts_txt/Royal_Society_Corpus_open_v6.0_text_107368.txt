TH E Royal Society did me the honour of printing in the volume of their Transactions for last year , a paper of mine on the nature of the salts termed triple prussiates , and on acids formed by the union of certain bodies with the elements of the prussic acid .
In that paper , I endeavoured to prove , that the elements of the prussic acid would combine with a certain proportion of black oxide of iron , and form a peculiar , and hitherto unknown acid , for which I proposed the name of the ferruretted chyazic acid .
I showed that this was the real acid portion of the salts which had received the erroneous appellation of triple prussiates , and that the property of combining with the prussic acid , so as to change its nature , and increase its acid properties , was not confined to the black oxide of iron , but was possessed probably by many other bodies , but certainly by sulphur , which formed with it another acid , for which I proposed the name of the sulphuretted chyazic acid .
The paper also contained some analytical researches into the proportions TABLE showing in what degree the results of my analyses coincide with the atomic r i ?

, : 0O 102 CA 8 fb 01 , t-4 ct2 mN WIJ ici |M CS in which the elements of these new acids are combined in them , and also into the proportions in which they unite with different saline bases .
My object in this paper , is to add to the analyses contained in the former , two analyses which I have since made ; and then to apply to the whole , the admirable theory of Dalton , by which the proportions in which bodies can combine , are conceived to be governed by the relative weights of their chemical atoms , and also BERZELIUS'S addition to this theory , by which the combinations of oxides with one another , are conceived to take place in such a manner , that the oxygen contained in one of these bodies , is either equal to , or is a multiple by a whole number , of the oxygen contained in the others .
I begin with describing the two analyses to which I have just alluded .
Analysis of prussiate of mercury .
A. Fifty grains of this salt finely pulverised , were kept at the temperature of 212 ?
for six hours , at the end of which time , they weighed exactly the same as before .
B. Forty grains of this salt were dissolved in water and decomposed by hydro-sulphuret of potash : the products of this decomposition were prussiate of potash and black sulphuret of mercury ; the quantity of the former could not be ascertained with accuracy , owing to the escape of much of the prussic acid , but that of the sulphuret amounted to 37.2 grains .
C. Disappointed in my attempt to estimate the quantity of prussic acid by the last experiment , owing to its very volatile nature , I availed myself of the property I had discovered 221 in the hydroguretted sulphurets , of converting the prussic acid at the moment they detach it from prussiate of mercury , into sulphuretted chyazic acid ; which being much less volatile , and having a stronger attraction for alkaline bases than the prussic , could not escape from the liquid , and would give me the quantity of prussic acid it represented , by deducting from its weight , that of the sulphur which I knew to exist in it .
I therefore dissolved lo grains of prussiate of mercury in hot water , and poured hydroguretted sulphuret of soda into the solution until it no longer occasioned a black precipitate .
This black precipitate when dry , weighed 9.3 grains ; to the liquid from which it was separated , I added a few drops of diluted sulphuric acid ; these caused a separation of a minute quantity of sulphur , which was got rid of by subsidence , after which I poured into it an aqueous solution of the two sulphates of copper , and of black oxide of iron , in which the former salt was to the latter by weight , as 2 is to 3 , until no farther effect was produced .
By these means I threw down the whole of the sulphuretted chyazic acid contained in the liquid , and collected it combined with protoxide of copper , in the form of an insoluble white salt , which weighed 9.7 grains .
But as ioo grains of this salt contain 40.62 grains of sulphuretted chyazic acid , composed of 26.39 sulphur and 14.23 prussic acid , according to my analysis , Phil. Tran .
for 1814 , page 549 , Exp. C , ( corrected by calculations in the Table facing page 230 of the present paper ) , therefore the before mentioned 9.7 grains represent 1.38 of prussic acid , which according to this experiment is the quantity existing in Io grains of prussiate of mercury .
-0222 D. I had next to ascertain how much red oxide of mercury was represented by the 37.2 grains of black sulphuret obtained in Experiment B , and by the 9.3 grains of the same substance obtained in Experiment C. In order to effect this , I made the following experiment : 35 grains of corrosive sublimate were dissolved in water , and decomposed by hydro-sulphuret of potash ; the black sulphuret thus formed , weighed 21.5 grains , which , therefore , represents 19.94 grains of red oxide of mercury , that being the quantity contained in 25 grains of corrosive sublimate .
Then as 21.5 : 19-94 : 37.2 : 34.48 the quantity of red oxide in 40 prussiate of mercury , And as 21.5 : 19.94 : : 9.3 8.62 the quantity of ditto in 10 of ditto , ioo grains of prussiate of mercury are therefore composed of Prussic acid , Experiment C. -13.8 Red oxide of mercury , Experiment B. C. and D. 86.2 00oo .
Analysis of prussic acid .
Being very desirous of accomplishing the analysis of this acid if possible , I considered very attentively the nature of the difficulties to be surmounted in order to effect it .
The principal ones appeared to me to be the following .
ist .
That of always ascertaining with precision , the quantity which is the subject of analysis .
sd .
That of effecting its combustion with oxygen in such a manner , that while , on the one hand , the whole of its carbon and hydrogen should be oxygenated , so on the other , that none of its azote should undergo this process .
223 That of determining with great accuracy , the quantity of oxygen which combines with the elements of the prussic acid during its combustion , so as after allowing for what has been expended in the formation of carbonic acid , to be able to infer with confidence , from the disappearance of the rest , the quantity of hydrogen which was contained in the acid .
The property which the prussic acid possesses of assuming the liquid form at a low temperature , and that of a gas or vapour at common temperatures , the volume of which is materially influenced by mixture with other gases , and by slight alterations of temperature and pressure ; did not appear to me to be favourable to the employment of it in an uncombined form for the purpose of its analysis .
I therefore determined upon employing it in the state of condensation in which it exists in prussiate of mercury , and this determination made me undertake the analysis I have just described of that salt ; of the correctness of which , having satisfied myself , I conceived that I had overcome the first difficulty .
The second and third difficulties I thought would be best surmounted by employing , for the combustion of the prussic acid , the same oxide with which it is united in the prussiate of mercury , nanlely , the red oxide of that metal ; increasing the quantity of it by multiples of that which the salt contains , until I found that the whole of the prussic acid was decomposed .
I made a number of experiments upon this plan , the results of which proved to me that the quantities of carbonic acid and of azote gases produced , did not arrive at the maximum until five times the quantity of red oxide of mercury contained 324 in the prussiate had been added to it , making together six of that oxide , to one of prussic acid , and that whenever a less quantity of the oxide than this had been employed , there always existed in the gaseous products , a portion of undecomposed prussic acid .
I farther observed , that in all cases the volume of azote gas obtained , was exactly equal to that of the prussic acid decomposed , that the volume of carbonic acid gas produced was invariably twice that of the azote gas liberated in the same experiment , and that the carbonic acid produced accounted for only one third of the oxygen consumed .
The observance of these laws by which the decomposition was regulated , enabled me in constructing the following Table ( facing page 228 , ) to correct the minute and unavoidable inaccuracies of experiment , by the superior accuracy to be acquired by applying to the results so obtained , the corrections necessary to make them correspond with the abovementioned laws .
It enabled me also to represent in the column denoting the measures of prussic acid gas , equal quantities by equal bulks ; which , for the reasons before stated , experiment does not exactly show , and thus to render evident the true progress of its decomposition .
It may be proper before proceeding farther , to describe my mode of operating , in conducting the experiments from which the Table was compiled .
This mode is similar in principle to that invented by GAY LussAc and THENARD in their Analysis of Animal and Vegetable substances , and improved by BERZELIUS .
I am greatly indebted to these two French chemists , for the valuable information respecting this kind of analysis , which I have obtained from their Recherches Physico-Chymiques , and to Dr. BERZELIUS for that which I have received from his Paper on the definite proportions in which the elements of organic nature are combined , published in Dr. THOMSON 's Annals of Philosophy for December last .
It is to this information that I principally attribute the success which has attended the experiments of a similar nature , which I have made .
The method pursued by me , however , differs in several respects from that of either of the chemists just mentioned , ist .
In the apparatus employed , which is much more simple in my process 2dly .
In the nature of the oxygenised body employed to effict the combustion .
$dly .
In the method to which I had recourse , for proportioning the oxygenised to the combustible body , by making the former a multiple of that which ellters into chemical union with the latter .
4thly .
In decomposing a much less quantity of the combustible body at a time , than either of the above chemists .
In the present case , each of these alterations appeared to me to possess very decided advantages over the other methods .
How far they may be applicable to other cases , I do not pretend to determine .
Having thus generally stated in what my process differed from former ones , I proceed to rather a more particular description of it .
I prepare the peroxide of mercury which I employ , by decomposing with pure soda , a solution of corrosive sublimate .
Having weighed out the proportions of prussiate of mercury , and of the peroxide which I intend to decompose , I triturate them together in a small polished mortar of porphyry or agate a2S for several minutes , then collect into the centre of the mortar , what adheres to its sides , and repeat this alternate trituration and collection at least six times .
I then take a tube of glass 41inches long , about the size of a common writing quill and tolerably stout , I close one end of it , and bend the other round , so that nearly an inch of that end forms a right angle with the rest .
I call this the retort tube .
I make a second tube similar to the first , except that instead of being closed at one end , it is open at both .
I call this the adapting tube .
The retort tube is then charged with the mixed materials , by means of a small paper funnel , fixed with sealing wax to the top of the tube ; the charge is introduced in about three equal portions , each of which is separated from the others by the introduction of a little coarsely powdered green glass ; the charge generally occupies about 4 inches of the tube .
After its introduction , the wax which fastened the funnel is softened by heat , and the funnel detached .
A graduated glass tube , capable of containing about es cubic inches , was next filled with mercury , and placed in the mercurial pneumatic trough , not in the usual perpendicular position , but with its upper end raised , but very little , from the horizontal situation , being about an inch above the surface of the mercury , while its lower or open end just dipped below that surface .
In this position , the long leg of the adapting tube was passed up into it , which being open at both ends became filled with mercury ; the short end of this tube was then connected with the short end of the retort tube , by means of a caoutchouc tube firmly tied to both .
The long end of the retort tube when thus disposed , hung over the outside of Gg2 7 the end of the mercurial trough , in a position declining a little from the horizontal one towards the table .
The decomposition was then commenced , by applying the flame of a spirit lamp to the empty part of the tube , and bringing it down gradually , so as to explode in succession the three strata of the mixture .
The arrangement of the apparatus at the commencement of the process , will be instantly seen by an inspection of the annexed sketch .
When the retort tube was cold , it was separated , under the surface of the mercury , from the adapting tube , in such a manner , that any gas remaining in the latter might pass up into the graduated tube ; the volume of gas collected , was then ascertained , making the necessary corrections for temperature , pressure , and the capacity of the retort tube , after which a solution of pure potash was passed up into it , and the diminution of volume which it occasioned was noticed ; from the gas which remained , a deduction was made , for the quantity of atmospheric air in the upper part of the retort tube before the combustion , and which seldom exceeded - !
of a cubic inch ; the residual gas was considered as azote , and found to be so by all the tests to which I subjected it .
The small quantity of solution of potash employed to effect the absorption was then examined , and if , besides carbonic acid , it was found to contain prussic acid , I concluded that I had not employed enough of the red oxide of mercury in the ?

combustion , and repeated the experiment with an increased proportion of it .
Such was my method of effecting the analysis of the prussic acid , and by which as will be seen in the last line of the Table , I succeeded in discovering that 0.3442 gr. of it were composed as follows : Carbon = to that in o.4389 gr. of carbonic acid , or o.i 198 Azote = to the weight of the azote gas collected 0.1401 Hydrogen = to that in o.7S3o gr. of water 0.0843 0.3442 consequently that Ioo grains contain Carbon 34.8 Azote 40.7 Hydrogen 24.5 100.0 Having finished my analytical investigations , I pass on to the last divison of my subject which is the following comparative view of the composition of the prussic , ferruretted chyazic , and sulphuretted chyazic acids , and of their salts , as deduced from my analytical experiments , and as inferred from the atomic theory .
I was very well aware of the probability of my placing some of my analyses in a very unfavourable light , by contrasting the results obtained by the application of a theory , capable of giving the composition of bodies with absolute certainty , with those results which I have obtained by practical experiments , on a class of bodies hitherto little examined , 299 or understood , and the analyses of which were very difficult , : but I would not allow this consideration to have any influence in deterring me from making such a contrast , for as I had not the vanity to give these analyses as perfect , so I feel no mortification in now proving , that they were not so ; and being confident that I had not spared either time or trouble in making them , I expose their imperfections without hesitation , confiding in the candid judgment of those , who , having undertaken similar investigations , are aware of the numerous difficulties , and sources of error attendant upon them .
I have arranged and collected these comparisons into the form of a Table , which I beg leave now to introduce .
I infer from the Table , that the acids and salts included in it , are so composed as to harmonize perfectly with the doctrines of DALTON and BERZELIUS , and to be very compatible with the opinion respecting the compound nature of azote .
I shall be happy if this attempt to elucidate the nature and composition of these bodies , adds in any degree to the daily and rapid progress now making in chemical science .
