) Introduction .
In June , 1913 , one of the members of the Commission went to the Liwonde district to identify and isolate the various species of trypanosomes infecting the " fly " and wild game in the " fly-belt " which extends along the Upper Shire River valley from Lake Pamalombe to the Murchison cataracts .
This " fly-area " is , roughly speaking , 100 miles south of Kasu and the " Proclaimed Area .
" It is separated from the extensive " fly-area " of the plains on the west shore of Lake Nyasa , of which the " Proclaimed Area " forms a part , by a range of hills and high plateaux where the " fly " is absent , although there is nothing to prevent trypanosome-infected wild animals wandering from one " fly-belt " into the other .
The valley of the Upper Shire is thickly populated , and the " fly-area " is crossed by two of the most frequented roads in Nyasaland , the grand trunk road running from Zomba to the north and the main road from Liwonde to Fort Johnston .
Although thickly populated , human trypanosome disease , though probably existing , has not yet been discovered in this district.* The natives , however , can keep no cattle , and their goats and dogs are constantly destroyed by trypanosome diseases , so that they have to continually import these animals from the highlands .
Game is very abundant in this district , particularly in the dry season , when herds of eland , koodoo , waterbuck , and impala concentrate in the vicinity of the river .
In the wet season elephant and buffalo wandering about the country frequently remain for many weeks in the impenetrable thickets and swampy " dam bos " along the river banks .
A characteristic feature of the flora of this district is the extensive forests of " sanya " trees , open forests of medium-sized trees , devoid of undergrowth , but carpeted with short wiry grass .
Large herds of impala are always to be found in these forests , and tsetse flies are everywhere , being particularly numerous * Since this was written cases of trypanosome disease in man have beei\ found .

Nandumba 's village ( 14 ' 40 ' S. lat. , 35 ' 10 ' E. long .
) , on the banks of the Shire Kiver , was selected as the locality for the camp in which to carry out experiments of feeding flies on healthy dogs and goats , monkeys being unobtainable .
The experiments were carried out between the dates of June 19 and July 25 , 1913 .
Methods Employed .
The method employed in the feeding experiments was the same as described in a previous paper in the ' Proceedings/ * except that monkeys were unobtainable , and the flies were fed only twice on each animal .
All infected animals were subsequently taken to Kasu , the usual precautions being taken to prevent re-infection on the way , and the trypanosomes found in them were compared with the species and strains of trypanosomes obtained from human beings , various animals , and the flies in the Proclaimed Sleeping Sickness Area .
Special attention and study were devoted to the comparison of the strain of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland\#151 ; Trypanosoma brucvel \#151 ; from Nandu'mba 's , with strains obtained from human beings , various animals , and the tsetse flies in the Proclaimed Area .
The following Table gives in the first column the date the tsetse flies were first fed on the experimental animals , the second column the number of flies fed , and the signs plus and minus show the result of feeding the flies on the dog and goat .

40 Trypanosomes found in Wild G. morsitans and Wild Game .
It will be seen that the " fly " in the Upper Shire district carries the same four species of trypanosomes as those found at Kasu in flies from the Proclaimed Sleeping Sickness Area : T. vel rhodesiense , T. T. simice , and T. caprce .
Here , in a series of seven experiments , all the animals on which the flies were fed developed trypanosome disease .
In six experiments the flies infected the dogs with T. brucei vel rhodesiense ; in the second and fifth there was a double infection with T. and in the seventh an infection with T. pecorum alone .
None of the goats were infected with T. brucei .
Six goats were infected with T. pecorum , one with T. simice , and five with T. caprce .
It will be noticed that the smallest batch of flies used , a batch of 73 , infected the dog with T. brucei , and the goat with T. pecorum , T. simice , and T. caprce .
Examination of the Blood of Wild Animals in the Liwonde District .
Whenever wild animals were killed their blood was examined for trypanosomes , which were identified by the microscope in stained films of the blood .

T. bruceivel rhodesiensewas found in only one animal out of the sixteen , T. simicein none , and T. caprcc in three .
Conclusions .
1 .
The trypanosomes found in the wild morsitans and wild game of the Upper Shire " fly-area " are identical with those found 100 miles farther north in the Proclaimed Area .
2 .
The trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland\#151 ; T. brucei vel rhodesiense\#151 ; is frequently met with , so that it is probable cases of this form of sleeping sickness will be found among the natives of this district .
The Food of Glossina morsitans .
By Surgeon-General Sir David Bruce , C.B. , F.R.S. , A.M.S. ; Major A. E. Hamerton , D.S.O. , and Captain D. P. Watson , R.A.M.C. ; and Lady Bruce , R.R.C. ( Scientific Commission of the Royal Society , Nyasaland , 1912-14 .
) ( Received April 7 , \#151 ; Read June 18 , 1914 .
) Five hundred flies , freshly caught in the Proclaimed Area , were killed by chloroform and the gut of each was roughly dissected out , smeared on a slide , , fixed by osmic vapour and alcohol , and subsequently stained by Giemsa .
The flies were all caught in the bush , away from the paths , the fly-boys proceeding-in single file and catching the flies with gauze nets as they circled round , or settled on the boys or the grass .
The proportion of male flies to females caught was roughly two to one .
But only 30 females were used in the present experiment , the majority being sent to the breeding-station at Chunzi .
Of the 500 flies examined , 288 , or 57'6 per cent. , were found to contain mammalian blood in a recognisable state .
No measurements were made of corpuscles , which in most cases were much altered by the digestive processes , but the small type of cell appeared to predominate , such as occurs in the hartebeeste , waterbuck , and other antelope .
In only three cases were nucleated red corpuscles found , and in two of these there was only a small proportion of nucleated blood mixed with a large amount of mammalian .
In the third case the blood was all nucleated .
Thus , of those flies which contained recognisable blood , only PO per cent.
