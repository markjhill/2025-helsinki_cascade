When sulphideofphenyl , C6H5 } S , was passed several times in succession 6 5 .
through an iron tube filled with nails and heated to low redness , a considerable amount of carbonaceous matter was deposited , and a portion of the sulphide was converted into an isomeric compound , which I propose to call Parasulphide of Phenyl .
In order to obtain this substance from the dark-coloured distillate which collected in the receiver when sulphide of phenyl was submitted to the action of heat in the manner above described , it was transferred to a copper retort and distilled .
The clear dark-yellow oil was then cooled for several hours in a freezing-mixture , when a considerable quantity of a white crystalline substance separated in nodules ; this is freed from undecomposed sulphide of phenyl by thoroughly draining it on a vacuum filter .
It can readily be purified by repeated crystallization from boiling alcohol , in which it is rather soluble .

C. , and can be distilled at a very high temperature .
It is insoluble in water , but rather soluble in bisulphide of carbon , ether , and benzol .
Parasulphobenzine.-When parasulphide of phenyl was digested for several hours with dilute sulphuric acid and acid chromate of potassium , it was gradually converted into a new substance , having a much higher melting-point , so that the completion of the oxidation was readily observed by the entire disappearance of the fused parasulphide .
The crude parasulphobenzine was then collected , well washed with water , and purified by two or three crystallizations out of boiling alcohol .

Parasulplobenzolene melts at 230 ?
C. , is soluble in boiling alcohol , from which it crystallizes on cooling in the form of long white shining needles .
It is insoluble in water , soluble in benzol , ether , and carbon disulphide .
It dissolves readily in warm sulphuric acid , forming a colourless solution , and does not blacken even when heated to the boiling-point of the acid .
Water precipitates it unchanged .
It is also soluble in hot strong nitric acid without change , and crystallizes out on cooling .
