A new Demonstration of the Binomial Theorem , when the Exponent is a positive or negative Fraction .
By the Rev. Abram Robertson , A.M. F.R.S. Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
In a Letter to Davies Giddy , Esq. F.R.S. Read June 5 , 1806 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1806 , p. 305 .
] This paper is merely an extension of one formerly communicated to the Society by Mr. Robertson , and printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1795 .
It is , the author says , so far as relates to the raising of integral powers , the same as that paper , and is confessedly new only to the extent mentioned in the title , namely , that the present demonstration is applicable when the exponent is a positive or a negative fraction .
The nature of the paper is obviously such , as to render it unsusceptible of abridgement .
