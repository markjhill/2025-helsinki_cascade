These equations , then , show that the hollow vortex is stable for all displacents of its surface , with the possible exception of such as involve sinuous vibrations of slow type .

OF THE PERIODS OF A HOLLOW VORTEX RING .
uoenerically , and hence V. It seems , therefore , that the vortex theory of matteY not much improved in respect of the relations between the velocity and the energy by taking account of the atomic charge , unless the atom is supposed always to have rly the radius corresponding to minimum energy .
electlic charge can , of course , have no direct action on the velocity of the rortex .
The manner of its action may be illustrated by considering what happens a vortex ring is suddenly charged .
The charge will produce two distinct .
It will increase the cross-section of the hollow , and also its aperture .
The effect has no further consequences , but the motion of the fluid involved in the latter effect causes the velocity of the fluid at the front of the hollow to decrease , and at the rear to increase .
This causes an increase of pressure in front and a the rrgy and the aperture of the ring , which is caused by an electric charge , takes only in the potential part of that energy .
The kinetic energy of the fluid is tered ( to our order of approximation ) by the electric charge .

In order to discuss the stability of an electrified vortex , the periods of the small \amp ; flations must be found .
For this purpose we must find the surface of the ffitric force when the surface of the vortex is given by ( 11 ) .
