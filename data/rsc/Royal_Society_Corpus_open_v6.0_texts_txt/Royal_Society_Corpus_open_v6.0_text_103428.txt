V. Observation of an extraordinary Height of the Barometer , December 21 .
1721 .
By Mr. George Graham , Watchmaker , F. R. S. Jan. 11th , 1721 .
UPON Thursday the 21st of December last , observing the Barometer much higher than usual ; that Evening , between Seven and Eight a Clock , I fill da Tube with very clean Quick-silver , and found the Height a little to exceed 30,71/ 2 Inches .
By Eight the next Morning , a Wheel-Barometer , which hung in the same Room , had risen One tenth of an Inch higher than it was the Night before , when the Experiment was made ; at Ten a Clock , One fifth of an Inch more : At which Time it was at the highest , being a little above 30,81/ 2 Inches ; for about Twelve at Noon it was sensibly lower , and continued falling all the rest of the Day .
When the lower End of the Tube was first immersed in the Cistern , the Quick-silver for some Time adhered to the Crown of the Glass , but upon shaking , it fell to the Height above-mention 'd .
