" By Major Cardew , R.E. , and Major Bagnold , R.E. Communicated by Lord Kelvin , P.R.S. Received June 21 , 1894 .
On the 8th January , 1894 , an accident occurred at Bournemouth of an unusual nature .
An omnibus was in the act of drawing up in the roadway outside the Imperial Hotel , when the horses suddenly fell down , and one of them died in a few minutes .
All the men who assisted in extricating the horses felt tingling sensations in their limbs suggestive of electrical shock , and the connexion from the mains of the Bournemouth Electric Light Company to the hotel was known to pass underneath the spot at which the accident occurred .
This Company use the high pressure alternating system at 2,000 volts pressure , and in the case of this hotel the transformers were installed upon the premises .
On investigation , a defect in the insulation of one of the high pressure service lines was discovered , from which sparking had evidently taken place to the enclosing 1^-in .
wrought iron pipe .
This pipe was 32 ft. long , laid at a depth of about 18 in .
, and terminated at a brick junction box under the roadway , and a brick and cement area wall at the hotel .
The ends were thus fairly insulated , while the rest of the pipe was in contact with the earth .
The accident took place during the progress of a thaw , after a very severe frost .
Upon consideration of the case , Major Cardew reported to the Board of Trade that in his opinion the accident was caused by leakage from the short length of charged pipe , affecting the potential of the surface of the ground to such an extent that between the fore and hind feet of the horse a sufficient difference of potential was established to give rise to the current which proved fatal .
At the same time , as the fact of such a result following from a simple contact with ordinary road material was a new experience of J894 .

the possible dangers attending the commercial supply of electrical energy , it was thought desirable to repeat the conditions as nearly as possible , and measure the results obtaiued .
As such an experiment could not , for obvious reasons , be satisfactorily carried out in London , it was arranged that it should be tried at Chatham , where the necessary apparatus was available .
A first experiment was made on the 26th January , 1894 .
In this a lenyth of 33 ft. 3 in .
of 2-in .
iron pipe was buried to a depth of 18 in .
within the salient of one of the demi-bastions at St. Mary 's Barracks , Chatham .
A piece of well insulated 37-strand No. 16 cable was inserted in this pipe so that the ends of the conductors made good contact with the inside of the pipe at its centre point .
Over the centre of pipe two 56-lb .
weights were placed on the surface of the ground , and at a distance of 4 ft. laterally another pair of 56-lb .
weights were similarly placed .
A 16-kilowatt alternator was connected by means of an underground cable laid in stoneware pipes to the piece of cable in the 2-in .
pipe .
The other pole of the alternator was connected to a 1^-in .
service pipe in connexion wkh the barrack water mains .
One end of this service pipe was in connexion with a hydraulic ram set in the ground at a distance of 140 ft. from the piece of buried pipe .
An 800-volt .
Thomson static voltmeter was connected across the terminals of the alternator , and a pair of leads , well insulated , were attached by means of screws to the two pairs of weights situated over the buried pipe .
These leads were run back together to the experiment room , and were connected alternately to a 140-volt static voltmeter and a Cardew voltmeter .
The voltage of the alternator was varied by means of the exciting current which was taken from accumulators .
The readings on both voltmeters are given in Table I. As the earth resistance was rather low , the alternator could not be run up above 400 volts without overheating the armature .
Fig. 1 is a diagram of the arrangement .
The results show a potential difference between points 4 ft. apart on the surface of over 20 per cent , of the whole P.D. used to charge the pipe when measured statically , and even when a current of nearly 1/ 10 ampere was drawn from the ground through a Cardew voltmeter the P.D. was more than 10 per cent , of the whole .
The propinquity of the scarp walls , however , appeared likely to have , to some extent , influenced the direction of the lines of flow of current , and it was determined to repeat it , changing the position of the pipe and extending the tests to a greater distance from the pipe .
The second experiment was carried out on the 16th March , 1894 .

An interesting note made on this experiment is as follows:\#151 ; " The soil in which the pipe was buried was loamy , and when digging the trench no worms were noticed , but towards the conclusion of the experiment it was observed that hundreds of worms came to the surface between 3 ft. and 9 ft. on either side of the pipe ; no worms appeared , however , immediately over the pipe .

The ground was much , drier than was the case in the first experiment , and , probably in consequence of this , it appears that while the statical P.D. between the two first weights is relatively greater in the second than in the first experiment , the P.D. obtained with a current-using instrument is relatively less .

] establishment , of Difference of Potential , observations could be taken beyond a charging pressure of 440 volts , while between weights C and D the P.D. , even with 610 volt charging pressure , was too small for exact measurement .
By interpolating an approximate value for the fall of potential between A and B from the readings obtained on the Cardew voltmeter , a rough curve of the fall of potential on the surface of the ground for a charging pressure of 610 volts is obtained , as shown in fig. 3 , Curve a , the height of the curve above absolute zero being D Distance .
made consistent with the evident approach of the curve to its asymptote at D. In this case , therefore , the effect of the leakage extended to a distance of about 14 ft. from the pipe , and the fall of potential on the surface appears to have been most rapid at a distance from the line immediately above the pipe equal to twice the depth at which it was buried .
A third experiment was carried out on the 22nd May , 1894 , with the same arrangements as in the second experiment .
The objects for which this was undertaken were chiefly to obtain a record of the variation of P.D. on the surface with the charging current , which had not been previously recorded , to obtain results from charging with continuous , as well as alternating , current , and to extend the investigation as regards the latter .
Unfortunately , the continuous current generator could not be used , owing to a mechanical defect , which could not be removed in the limited time available .
Still , the results obtained with alternating current are , it is considered , of some value , especially as the condition of the ground was different from that which existed at the time of VOL. LVI .

Curve 6 in fig. 3 appears to show by its form the effect of this state of the soil , the fall of potential from B to D being approximately indicated by a straight line .
That is to say that the current flow was practically entirely confined to the surface layer .
The curve is deduced from the results of experiments shown in Table III for a charging pressure of 550 volts .

] Viscosity of Water as shown by 259 the charging pressure was connected to these points and observations taken , when the exciting current for the field magnets of the dynamo and the charging current to the pipe were practically the same as in a previous set of experiments , for which the charging volts were known .
Both sets of experiments are shown in the table .
The disturbance of the worms was again very distinct , and they appeared , on reaching the surface , to set their bodies parallel to the pipe , or along an equipotential line .
The experiments , as a whole , show conclusively that , under very different conditions of weather and amount of moisture in the soil , it is possible to produce a fall of potential amounting to 25 per cent , of the whole pressure in the supply between points on the surface of the ground 4 ft. apart , a distance which most horses stand over , and , further , that , although the connexion of such points by a conducting body naturally reduces this potential difference , yet , when this conductor has about the resistance of a horse ( say 400 ohms ) , sufficient current will pass to give a severe shock .
It is hoped that , when opportunity serves , these experiments may he extended to the case of pipes buried to greater depths , and to observe whether any difference is produced by the use of a steady , in place of an alternating pressure .

" On the Viscosity of Water as determined by Mr. J. B. Hannay by means of his Microrheometer .
" By Robert E. Barnett , A.R.C.S. Communicated by Professor T. E. Thorpe , F.R.S. Received May 6 , 1894 .
In a paper entitled " On the Microrheometer , " published in the 1 Philosophical Transactions ' for 1879 , Vol. 170 , p. 275 , Mr. J. B. Hannay describes an apparatus with which he made measurements of the rate of flow of water , and of some aqueous saline solutions through a capillary tube , and he deduces from the observations certain relations between the chemical nature of the salt dissolved , and its effect on the rate of flow of water .
Inasmuch as Mr. Hannay furnishes us with details of the dimensions of his apparatus , I have , at Professor Thorpe 's suggestion , transformed his relative numbers into absolute measure of viscosity in order to compare his results with those of other workers .
The data given are as follows :\#151 ; Diameter of capillary tube = 0*0938 mm. Length " =21 mm. Capacity .of glass bulb = 4*0530 c.c. The time of flow was measured by a stop-watch , and each number recorded was the mean of ten observations .
