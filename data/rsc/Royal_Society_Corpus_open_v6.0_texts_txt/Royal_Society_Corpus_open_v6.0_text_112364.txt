" Supplementary Note on a Spectrum of a Solar Prominence .
" By J. NORMAN LOCKYER , F.R.A.S. , in a Letter to the Secretary .
Communicated by Dr. SHARPEY , Sec. R.S. Received November 5 , 1868 .
SIR , -I have the honour , in continuation of my letter of the 20th ultimo , to inform you that I have this morning obtained evidence that the solar prominences are merely the expansion , in certain regions , of an envelope which surrounds the sun on all sides .
I may add that other facts observed seem to point out that we may shortly be in a position to determine the temperature of these circumsolar regions .
J. NORMrAN LOCKYER .
