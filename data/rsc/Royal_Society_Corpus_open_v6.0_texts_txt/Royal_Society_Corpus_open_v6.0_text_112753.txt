( Abstract .
) The paper commences with a continuation for the years 1864-66 of Tables II .
and III .
of a previous paper by the same authors ; it then proceeds to a discussion of the value of the pictures of the sun made by Hofrath Schwabe , which had been placed at the disposal of the authors , and the result is that these pictures , when compared with simultaneous pictures taken by Carrington and by the Kew heliograph , are found to be of great trustworthiness .
From 1832 to 1854 the pictures discussed are those of Schwabe , who was the only observer between these dates ; then follows the series taken by Carrington , and lastly the Kew series , which began in 1862 .
A list is given of the values of the sun 's spotted area for every fortnight , from the beginning of 1832 up to May 1868 , and also a list of threemonthly values of the same , each three-monthly value being the mean of the three fortnightly values which precede and of the three which follow it .
These three-monthly values are also given for every fortnight .
A plate is appended to the paper , in which a curve is laid down representing the progress of solar disturbance as derived from the three-monthly values ; and another curve is derived from this by a simple process of equalization , representing the progress of the ten-yearly period .
The values of the latter curve , corresponding to every fortnight , are also tabulated .
From this Table are derived the following epochs of maxima and minima of the longer periodcMinimum Nov. 28 , 1833 .
Maximum ... ... ... .
Dec. 21 , 1836 .

This exhibits a variability in the length of the whole period .
Thus we have between 1st and 2nd minimum ... ... 981 years .
2nd and 3rd do ... ... .
12,58 , 3rd and 4th do ... ... .1081 , , Mean of all the periods ... ... . .
11 07 years .
Another fact previously noted by Sir J. Herschel is brought to light , namely , that the time between a minimum and the next maximum is less than that from the maximum to the next minimum .
Thus the times from the minimum to the maximum are for the three periods 3'06 , 4l14 , and 3'37 , while those from the maximum to the minimum are 6'75 , 8'44 , and 7'44 years .
In all the three periods there are times of secondary maxima after the first maximum ; and in order to exhibit this peculiarity , statistics are given of the light-curve of R Sagitte and of 3 Lyra , two variable stars which present peculiarities similar to the sun .
Finally , the results are tested to see whether they exhibit any trace of planetary influence ; and for this purpose the conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus , of Venus and Mercury , of Jupiter and Mercury , as well as the varying distances of Mercury alone in its elliptical orbit , have been made use of , and the united effect is exhibited in the following Table , the unit of spotted area being one-millionth of the sun 's visible hemisphere : Excess or Deficiency .
