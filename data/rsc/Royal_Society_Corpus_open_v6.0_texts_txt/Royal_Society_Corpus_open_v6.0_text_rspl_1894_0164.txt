Lond. Communicated by Professor Armstrong , F.R.S. Received February 7,1895 .
In a former paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 56 ) , the author communicated the results obtained by mingling gases , which were extinctive of flame , with air , until a flame burning in the air was just extinguished .
The gases used in the experiments vjere carbon dioxide and nitrogen .
Each of these gases was separately introduced into the air , and the composition of the atmosphere thus produced , which just extinguished flame , was determined by chemical analysis .
The general results arrived at were:\#151 ; 1 .
That wick-fed flames require atmospheres of very similar composition to extinguish them : while gas-fed flames require atmospheres of widely different composition .
2 .
That nitrogen must be added in larger proportion than carbon dioxide , in order to extinguish the same flame .
3 .
That the minimum proportion of extinctive gas which must be mingled with air in order to extinguish a flame is independent of the size of the flame .
J A supplementary series of experiments has now been undertaken j in order to determine the composition of the atmosphere extinctive | of each flame , which is produced by the flame itself when burning in an enclosed volume of air at atmospheric pressure .
Preliminary trials showed that in order to secure trustworthy 3 results , the atmosphere must not be in contact with water .
It was further found necessary to avoid change of pressure in the enclosed ill atmosphere during the combustion of the flame .
these necessary conditions were- complied with by allowing the U Barnes to burn in a bell-jar , the bottom of which was closed by j fl'PPmg into a sufficiently deep vessel of mercury .
The neck of the .
f hell-jar was closed by a cork bearing a ( J -shaped mercury gauge , and a glass tube with a stopcock .
While the flame was burning , the pressure of the air within the hell-jar was maintained uniform by raising or lowering the bell-jar sufficiently to maintain the mercury levels unchanged in the pressure gauge .
As soon as the flame was extinguished by the atmosphere around it , the vessel was allowed to stand until the atmosphere within had become uniform in temperature with the air around .
A portion of the gases within the bell-jar was then removed by means of the stopcock-tube to a Hempel gas-burette , and was subjected to ordinary , 354 Dr. F. Clowes .
The Composition of the [ Feb. 21 volumetric analysis by absorption .
Each experiment and analysis was repeated in duplicate , and frequently in triplicate .
The results obtained were either identical or closely concordant , except in the case of methane ; but the flame of ethylene could not be maintained under the conditions of the experiment .
The gas was burnt from a tube passing through the mercury and terminating in a jet just above the surface of the mercury .
The liquids were burnt from wicks contained in small shallow vessels floating upon the surface of the mercury .
As in the previous series of experiments cit. ) the combustible substances used were chiefly those which are burnt for ordinary heating and lighting purposes .
The mean results are tabulated below .

Since the proportions of carbon dioxide contained in these atmospheres are small , the composition of the artificial atmospheres consisting of nitrogen and oxygen only , in which the flames were just extinguished when they are inserted , are also stated for comparison .
It will be noticed that the general agreement in composition shown by the two classes of extinctive atmospheres , so differently produced , is well maintained ; and when the conditions of the experiments are taken into account the recent series of results are confirmatory of the general accuracy of those previously obtained .
I have to acknowledge the assistance rendered by M. E. Feilmann , B.Sc. , in carrying out the experimental work involved in this investigation .
[ February 18 , 1895 .
] It is noteworthy that the composition of the extinctive atmosphere produced by the flame of a candle , or of oil , or of alcohol , closely corresponds with the average composition of air expired from the lungs .
The composition of the last portion of air which is expired varies somewhat with the length of time during which the air has been retained in the lungs .
The following percentage composition by volume was determined :\#151 ; 356 Extinctive Atmospheres produced by .

Soc. Proc. , ' December 6 , 1894 ) , an atmosphere of the average composition of expired air , or of that left by the combustion of candles or lamps , although it is extinctive of the flames of candles and of lamps , can be breathed by most people without producing any distinctly noticeable effect .
With some people , the increased proportion of carbon dioxide would cause the inspirations to be somewhat deeper than usual , but in no case would injury to health result from breathing such an atmosphere .
The statement made by the author in a previous paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 56 ) , that men could apparently breathe with safety an atmosphere which just extinguished the flame of a candle or of a lamp , is therefore fully borne out by the above results .
This agrees with the statements made by experienced mining authorities .
Accordingly the extinction of such ordinary illuminating flames cannot be considered as proof that an atmosphere is not respirable with safety .
The residual atmosphere produced by the hydrogen flame is undoubtedly not respirable , on account of the greatly diminished proportibn of oxygen which it contains .
The colour of the hydrogen flame undergoes a distinct change in colour from reddish-purple to blue as the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere is diminished .
Since a similar change of colour is noticed when carbon dioxide is present in the atmosphere , it is probably due to the lowering of temperature of the flame : all attempts to detect the production of carbon monoxide by this flame , when it is burning in air containing carbon dioxide , have failed .
The conclusions which may be drawn from the abovo results are that:\#151 ; 1 .
The flames of the combustible gases and liquids , which were experimented upon , produce , at the point of extinction in an enclosed atmosphere , a change in the proportion of oxygen w the air generally corresponding to that produced by preparing extinctive atmospheres by artificial mixture .

The flames of candles and lamps , when they are extinguished by Presents .

] burning in a confined space of air , produce an atmosphere of almost identical composition with that of air expired from the lungs .
g The extinctive atmosphei'es produced by the combustion of the flames of candles and of lamps , and the air expired from the lungs after inspiring fresh air , are respirable with safety .
4 .
The extinction of an ordinary candle or lamp flame , is not necessarily indicative of the unsuitability of an atmosphere to maintain life when it is breathed .
