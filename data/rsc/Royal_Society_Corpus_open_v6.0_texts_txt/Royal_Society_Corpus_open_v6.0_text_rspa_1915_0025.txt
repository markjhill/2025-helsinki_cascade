( 5 ) The surface conditions are ( i ) that be there zero , and ( u ) that ) ) .
( 6 ) : The first is already virtually expressed in 5 ) .
For the second .
This equation is to hold good to the second order for all values of , and therefore for each Fourier component separately .
The terms in and give The term in gives , ( 10 ) and , similarly , that in gives In like manner , ( 12 ) and so on .
These are the results of the surface condition From the other surface condition ) we find in the same way .
( 13 ) .
( 14 ) .
15 The corresponding terms in represent merely such waves , propagated in either direction , and of wave-lengths equal to an aliquot part of the principal wave-length , as might exist alone of infinitesimal height , when there is no primary wave at all .
When these are included , the aggregate , even though it be all propagated in the same direction , loses its character of possessing a permanent wave shape , and further it has no tendeney to acquire such a character as time advances .
If the principal wave is stationary we may take .
( 21 ) If , vanish , and .
( 22 ) According to ( 22 ) the surface comes to its zero position every heze when , and the displacement is a maximum when Then , ( 23 ) so that at this moment the wave-form is the .
am as for the progressive wave ( 18 ) .
Since is measured downwards , the maximum elevation above the mean level exceeds numerically the maximum depression below it .
In the more general case still with evanescent ) we may with .
