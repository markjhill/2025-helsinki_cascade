" Experimental Rtesearches to determine the Density of Steam at all Temperatures , and to determinie the Law of iExpansion of Superheated Stean .
" By WILLIAM FAIRBAIRN , Esq. , P.R.S. , and THOMIAS TATE , Esq. ( Abstract .
) The object of these researches is to determine by direct experiment the law of the density and expansion of steam at all tenmperatures .
Dumas determined the density of steam at 2120 Fahr. , but at this temperature only .
Gay-Lussac and other physicists have deduced the density at other temperatures by a theoretical formula true for a perfect gas : VIP _459 +T UP , I ' 459+T , .
( 1 .
) Oni the expalnsion of superheated steam , the only experiments are those of Mr. Siemens , which give a rate of expansion extremely high , and physicists have in this case also generally assu-Lmed the rate of expansion of a perfect gas .
Experimentalists have for some time questionied the truith of these gaseous formuhe in the case of condensable vapours , and have proposed new formulae derived from the dynamic theor y of heat ; butt up to the present time no reliable direct exeperime8ts have beenl imade to determinie either of the points at issue .
The authors have sought to supply the want of data on these ( uestions by researches on the denisity of steam upon a new and original method .
The general features of this method consist in vaporizing a known weight of water in a globe of about 70 cubic inches capacity , and devoid of air , and observing by means of a " saturation gauge " the exact temnperature at which the whole of the water is converted into steam .
The saturation gauge , in which the novelty of the experi .
meat consists , is essentially a double mercury colunn balanced upon orne side by the pressure of the steam produced from the weighed portionof water , and on the other by constantly saturated steam of the same temperature .
Hence whern heat is applied the mercury columnls remain at the same level up to the point at which the weighed portion of water is wholly vaporized ; from this point the columins inidicate , by a difference of level , that the steamn in the globe is superheating ; for superheated steam increases in pressure at a far lower rate than saturated steanm for equal iticrements of temperature .
By continuing the process , and carefully measuring the differelnce of level of the columtns , data are obtained for estimating the rate of expansion of superheated steam .
The apparatus for experiments at pressures of from 15 to 70 lbs. )er square inch , consisted chiefly of a glass globe for the receptionl of the weighed portion of water , drawni out into a tuLbe about 32 inches long .
The globe was enielosed in a copper boiler , forming a steambath by which it could be uniformly heated .
The copper steambath was proloniged downwards by a glass tube enclosing the globe stem .
To heat this tube uniiformly with the steam-bath , an outer oil-bath of blowni glass was eniployed , heated like the copper bath by gas jets .
The temperatures were observed by thermometers exposed naked in the steam , but corrected for pressure .
The two mercury columnyiws forming the saturation gauge were formed in the globe stem , and between this and the outer glass tube ; so long as the steam in the glass globe continued in a state of saturation , the inner column in the globe stem remained stationiary , at nearly the same level as that in the outer tube .
But when , in raising the temperature , the whole of the water in , the globe had beeni evaporated and the steam bad becone superbheated , the prcs'tsurc no longer balaniced that in the outer steam-bath , and , in consequelnce , the columun in the globe stem rose , and that in the outer tube fell , the difference of level forming a measure of the expansion of the steam .
Observations of the le.vels of the columns were made by meanis of a cathetometer at different temperatures , up to 100 or 20 ?
above the saturation point ; and the maximum temperature of saturation was , for reasons developed by the experiments , deduced from a point at which the steam was decidedly superheated .
The results of the experiments , which in the paper are giveni in detail , show that the density of saturated steam at all temperatuires , above as well as below 2120 , is invariably greater than that derived from the gaseous laws .
The apparatus for the experiments at pressures below that of the atmosphere was considerably modified ; and the condition of the steam was determined by comparing the column which it supported with that of a barometer .
The results of these experiments , reduced in the same way , are extremely consistent .
As the authors propose to extend their experiments to steam of a very high pressure , and to institute a distinct series on the law of expansion of superheated steam , they have not at present given any elaborate generalizations of their results .
The following formulae , however , represent the relations of specific volume and pressure of saturated steam , as determined in their experiments , with much exactness .
Let V be the specific volume of saturated steam , at the pressure P , measured by a column of mercury in inches ; then v=25-62+ 49513 ( 2- ) P+-72 a ( 2 .
) P= 49513__07.( .
Y25-62 In regard to the rate of expansion of superheated steam , the experiments distinictly show that , for temperatures within about ten degrees of the saturation point , the rate of expansion greatly exceeds that of air , whereas at higher temperatures the rate of expansion ap)proaches very near that of air .
Thus in experiment 6 , in which the maximum temperature of saturation is 1740.92 , the coefficient of expuansion between 174 ? ?
92 and 1800 is 1 or three times that of air ; whereas between 180( ' and 2000 the coefficient is very nearly the same as that of air ( steayf-i , airi54 ) ) , and so on in other cases .
The mea i coefficient of expansion at zero of temperatuire from seven experiments below the pressure of the atmosphere , and calculated from a point several degrees above that of saturation , is , whereas for air it is H Heice it would appear that for some degrees above the saturation point the steam is not decidedly in an a'riform state , or , in other words , that it is watery , containing floating vesicles of unvaporized water .

The authors hope that these experimeints may be continued , and that the results obtained at greatly increased pressures will prove as important as those already arrived at .
