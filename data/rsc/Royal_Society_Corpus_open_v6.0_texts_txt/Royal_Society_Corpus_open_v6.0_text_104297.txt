A Letter from Mr. John Freke , F. R. S. Surgeon to St. Bartholomew 's Hospital to the ROYAL SOCIETY , relating a Case of extraordinary Exostoses on the Back of a Boy .
GENTLEME N. I Would not have troubled you with this Account of a Case which came to my Inspection Yesterday at St. Bartholomew 's Hospital , had I ever seen the same before in my Practice .
I know it may be said to come under the Denomination of an Exostosis , but as all others that I have seen , which have been very many , arose upon some particular Parts , and have not been found to proceed from a general Dissolution of the Bones , as this hath , I think fit to submit it to your Consideration .
The Case is as follows : Yesterday there came a Boy of a healthy Look , and about Fourteen Years old , to ask of us at the Hospital , what should be done to cure him of many large Swellings on his Back , which began about Three Years since , and have continued to grow as large on many Parts as a Peny-loaf , particularly on the Left Side : They arise from all the Vertebrae of the Neck , and reach down to the Os Sacrum ; they likewise arise from every Rib of his Body , and joining together in all Parts of his Back , as the Ramifications of Coral do , they make , as it were , a fixed bony Pair of Bodice .
If this be found worthy your Thoughts , it will afford a Pleasure to , GENTLEME N , Your most humble Servant , Salisbury-Court , April 15 .
1736 .
John Freke .
It is to be observed , that he had no other Symptom of the Rickets on any Joint of his Limbs .
