] I. The Siderites of Cranbourne , near Melbourne , Australia .
Already , in 1854 , it was known that masses of iron lay near Western Port , south-east of Melbourne .
Mr. E. Fitzgibbons , the Secretary of the Municipality of Melbourne , was the first to direct attention to their meteoric characters , and he succeeded in removing enough of the larger mass to have the pieces forged into a horseshoe .
Two masses of meteoric iron were discovered in Victoria , and they were first reported upon by the late W. Haidinger in the ' Sitzungsberichte Akad .
Wien in 1861 .
The smaller block became the property of Mr. Abel , the engineer ; the larger one was purchased for a sovereign by Mr. A. Bruce , now of Chislehurst .
It appears that Mr. Bruce had seen a piece of iron , which had the appearance of being meteoric iron , in the fireplace of a squatter there , and he asked the man if any more of that kind was to he met with in that neighbourhood .
He was conducted to a spot m the adjoining parish of Sherwood , where an irregular spur of iron projected from the surface , and he there and then purchased it with the intention of presenting it to the British Museum .
Later on , when they proceeded to dig round it and uncover its sides , they were astonished at its large size ; various sums of money were offered Mr. Bruce for the splendid block , but his one answer to all such offers was : No !
I have bought it for a sovereign ; and I am going to give it to the British Museum .
" As has been stated , a point only of the iron was above the surface .
Its position in the ground is well shown in a photograph taken on the spot by my late friend , Mr. It .
Daintree , the Agent-General for Queensland , after the tertiary sandstone enclosing it had been removed .
It is the same sandstone which crops out at Broughton ; with basalt from 12 to 15 feet below , as on the coast at Western Port .
Bruce states that the lower bed is silurian , and that the block of iron penetrated a foot or more into it .

Early in 1861 the spot was visited by Dr. Neumayer and Mr. Abel ; one mass was found to weigh several hundredweight , the other from three to four tons .
Their relative position is shown in the accompanying small sketch map of the district .
They were found to be beyond all question native , or rather meteoric , iron covered with a crust of the usual characters , in which the customary hollows were not wanting .
This statement is , however , somewhat misleading ; no crust corresponding to that of magnetite , such as is presented by the Rowton siderite ( see infra ) , is met with , but in place a layer of considerable thickness of hydrated oxides and magnetite , indicating a long period during which the blocks had lain in the earth .
The relative positions of the two masses was S. 34 ' W. and N. 34 ' E. ( magnetic declination ) , and they were 3*6 miles ( 60 miles to a degree at the equator ) apart .
Both lay close to the surface , and were only so deeply imbedded that a point protruded from the soil .
The latitude of the smaller block , which lies north of the other , is 38 ' 8r S. and the longitude 145 ' 22 ' E. ; those of the larger being latitude 38 ' 1 lr S. and longitude 145 ' 20 ' E. of Greenwich .
The height above sea level of the former was 107 feet , and of the latter 127 feet .
nBH \#166 ; pi flyjBM p I l mum SSHhA \#151 ; They showed no polarity beyond that due to the action of the earth .
The under side of each mass was strongly south magnetic , and on the upper side north magnetic .
The longer axis of the Bruce meteorite , the larger mass , is about 5 English feet , and it lay exactly in the magnetic meridian of the place .
Neumayer made a number of determinations of the specific gravity of the nickel-iron of the smaller mass , in the possession of Mr. Abel , ranging from 7'12 to 7'6 , the crust being 3*66 .
This block was sent to the International Exhibition in London in 1862 .
The larger was brought down to Melbourne and placed in the University Grounds there , near the shore , and unfortunately exposed to the action of the seawater .
Efforts were made to delay the shipment of the Bruce meteorite to England , but eventually the smaller block was bought by the Trustees of the British Museum for \#163 ; 300 , and it was presented to the Colonial Museum ; the Bruce meteorite was then sent to this country .
CRANBOURNE , ROWTON , AND MIDDLESBROUGH .
When it reached the British Museum some holes were drilled into its under surface , and it was fixed on a turntable in the first room of the Mineral Gallery .
It was found to decay to a considerable extent ; fragments oxidised and crumbled off , and drops of iron chloride exuded here and there .
This , however , was stopped to a very great extent by injecting it with clear shellac varnish , and keeping it in a glass case provided with trays containing caustic lime .
By this means the destruction has been reduced to a minimum .
It was noticed that the part of the meteorite which was so rapidly decaying presented a very marked crystalline character ; that the tetrahedral structure broke up into plates , and between them were very thin plates of another constituent , which less readily underwent change .
The action of moisture on these series of plates was like that of the exciting liquid of a galvanic cell , and caused the oxidation to proceed very rapidly .
Many of the fragments which came off at this time were selected and reduced again to the firm solid original condition and present beautiful structure .
Of this I shall have more to say later on .
II .
Proportion of nickel and other constituents present in the .
It was at once noticed that the meteorite consisted entirely of metallic minerals , that it contained no rocky matter whatever .
One of the first experiments which suggested itself was to determine whether the iron was only alloyed with nickel , cobalt , copper , \amp ; c. , or whether it contained combined carbon .
A weighed portion was suspended by a platinum wire , carefully covered up with glass and caoutchouc , in a solution of recrystallised salt , and connected with a Bunsen cell , in the apparatus shown in the accompanying woodcut .
The positive cell was kept slightly acid from time to time as it grew alkaline .
Nickel-iron , weighing 5'9989 grms. , was dissolved in this way , MDCCCLXXXII . .
5 X and the greater part of the insoluble ingredients was found to consist of very minute bright apparently square prisms , which pervade all the nickel-iron , and apparently constitute nearly 1 per cent , of its mass .
These prisms are acted upon very slowly and with considerable difficulty by hydrogen chloride , but disappear readily in hydrogen nitrate .
But I shall return to the consideration of the characters and composition of the prisms later on .
The absence of all combined carbon was fully established .
The nickel-iron thus dissolved was found to contain of : Per cent. Prisms . . . .

0-172 Some of the largest nickel-iron crystals , and cleavages of them , were examined for other constituents than iron with the following results :\#151 ; I. was a tetrahedron of iron with cleavages parallel to the faces of the tetrahedron ; II .
was similar to I. but thinner ; III .
were several examples of cleavage plates , firm not pliant , thicker than the paper-like plates which will be described later on ; IV .
were thinner plates , but not pliant ones ; V. were thick cleavage plates ; and VI .
some borings .

The rusted fragments of the meteorite , which were very carefully picked over , yielded many very good crystals of nickel-iron .
These were reduced in porcelain tubes in hydrogen , a large quantity of hydrogen chloride was extracted from them , and dozens of perfectly complete tetrahedra of nickel-iron as well as many cleavage pieces with sharp edges were safely preserved .
III .
Edmondsonite , a well defined mineral species , occurring in the Cranbourne meteorite .
In one of the early notes on the Betjce meteorite published by W. Haidtnger , in 1862 , he wrote : " Vielleicht finden sich in der That innerhalb der Meteoreisenmassen . . . .
selbst manche Sattigungspunkte , welche wirklich verschiedene Mineralspecies CRANBOURNE , ROWTON , AND MIDDLESBROUGH .
darstellen .
" Such an instance presents itself in the thin paper-like pliant plates which lie on the faces of the tetrahedra of nickel-iron and between the large plates of the crystals of nickel-iron ; they are in the form of equilateral triangles or are lozenge-shaped , have the thickness of stout writing paper and , unlike the plates of nickel-iron , are quite pliant .
They are strongly magnetic , are of a pure white colour , and have evidently been extruded from the nickel-iron at the time of formation .
They are soluble in hydrogen chloride and nitrate .
As the examination of them was made in the case of some which had been reduced in hydrogen , a further portion picked direct from the fragments which had come off the meteorite was taken ; both kinds were found to be equally pliant .
The fresh plates taken direct from the meteorite contained O'688 per cent , of phosphorus .
Analysis of the plates showed them to consist of : Iron . . .
70*138-^28 =2*504:5 Nickel . . .
29*744-r-29*5 = 1 *008 : 2 99*882 This is evidently an alloy of very well defined composition , which has been extruded from the nickel-iron under special conditions when the latter was saturated with it and ready to expel it .
It is the constituent of nickel-iron which forms the fine lines constituting the Wiedmannstattian figures , and not schreibersite , as usually stated in writings on the etched figures of meteoric iron .
Tanite is the name which Professor Gustav Pose gave to leaves containing 13*2 per cent , of nickel , and which he stated to form the figures on an etched surface .
Dr. K. G. Zimmermann , in a letter to one of the editors of the 'Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie/ 1861 , p. 557 , proposed the name " meteorine " for a new metal occurring in the Cranbourne meteorite which he found to contain no copper , nickel , or cobalt .
The substance referred to in both cases was evidently the little plates above described .
As the composition of this mineral has now for the first time been definitely made out , I propose to call it Edmondsonite , in memory of the late George Edmondson , the Head Master of Queenwood College , Hampshire , a great lover of science ; a man with whom I had the honour to be long and intimately connected .
A curious accident should here be described which established the fact that the .
alloy is a definite chemical compound .
A number of pieces of nickel-iron from this meteorite which had become rusty were heated in a porcelain tube in a current of hydrogen .
During the progress of the experiment , which was conducted out of doors , it came on to rain , and some drops touched the hot tube and cracked it .
Air slowly entered the crack and oxidised the iron till it acquired a bright blue colour ; while the little plate of Edmondsonite remained colourless ( Plate 53 , fig. 1 ) .
This result accords wTith the conclusion arrived at by Stodart and Faraday some sixty years ago,46- on the oxidation of alloys of iron and nickel .

FLIGHT ON THE METfiORlTMS O with 10 per cent , of nickel made by them in 1820 , in imitation of the Siberian meteoric iron of Krasnojarsk , in which Children found as a mean of three analysis 8*96 per cent.* of nickel , was compared , as regards its powers of undergoing oxidation , with pure iron .
And the authors say : " The colour , when polished , had a yellow tinge .
A piece of the alloy has been exposed to moist air for a considerable time together with a piece of pure iron ; they are both a little rusty , not , however , to the same extent , that with the nickel being but slightly acted upon comparatively to the action on the pure iron ; it thus appears that nickel , when combined with iron , has some effect in preventing oxidation , though certainly not to the extent that has at times been attributed to it .
It is a curious fact that the same quantity of the nickel alloyed with steel instead of preventing its rusting appeared.to accelerate it very rapidly .
" IV .
Troilite of the Cranbourne siderite .
The Bruce meteorite contains many nodules of troilite lying here and there amongst the plates and crystals of nickel-iron , always in rounded masses , only very occasionally an ill-defined cleavage plane being met with .
They vary in size from half an inch to more than two inches in length , are usually covered with a thin layer of graphite , sometimes with some daubreelite surrounding them ; and one nodule , consisting of graphite , was found to enclose troilite which had aggregated inside the graphite in a curious way , so that the section of the nodule suggested the outline of a holly leaf .
Plate 53 , fig. 2 , represents a section of the nodule of graphite , the shaded enclosed part representing the sulphide .
Excepting daubreelite , troilite is the only sulphide found in this meteorite and , it need hardly be said , was not in the slightest degree magnetic .
A specimen of pounded and dried mineral was digested with a quantity of carbon disulphide , which had been twice distilled , for a day and a-half , and sulphur amounting to 0*0207 per cent , was dissolved .
A portion chosen for analysis was found to possess the following composition :\#151 ; I. II .

The next mineral , the composition of which we have to consider , is that forming the prisms which , as we have already seen , are scattered throughout the mass of the nickel-iron and form nearly 1 per cent , of its mass .
They resist the action of hydrogen chloride and are only dissolved after long treatment with very strong acid ; they dissolve , on the other hand , easily in hydrogen nitrate .
They exhibit strong magnetic characters .
They seem to be identical with the mineral to which Gustav Rose gave the name of rhabdite .
They appear to form square prisms , and the terminal faces of the prism could rarely be met with .
The prisms were exceedingly brittle and were rarely , if ever , of their normal length .
It was a difficult matter to obtain the prisms quite free from organic matter ( dried varnish , \amp ; c. ) , but the following very pure material was at last obtained :\#151 ; I. II .

A few years ago Professor Daubr^e^ pointed out the great resemblance which he had traced between the artificial phosphide of iron , Fe8P , which M. Sidot had succeeded in preparing , and the rhabdite of meteoric iron .
I have to offer my hearty thanks to Professor DaubrAe for permitting me to inspect some of M. Sidot 's crystals , which bore the closest resemblance to the above crystals .
More recently , in the spring of last year , M. E. Mallard+ communicated a note to the 'Comptes Rendus , 'on phosphide of iron found among the products of the spontaneous fires in the coal mines at Commentry .

They , of course , contain no trace of nickel ; in all other respects , however , they bear the closest resemblance to the above body .
VI .
Schreibersite in the Cranbourne siderite .
When the crude nickel-iron of the meteorite was treated with hydrogen chloride till action ceased , coarse insoluble particles , mixed with a black powder , and the needles remained : they could both be removed by decantation and repeated washings .
It was then subjected to a thorough cleansing with hydrogen chloride , with dilute nitric acid , with water , with a mixture of ether , alcohol , benzol , and chloroform , and finally , when dried , with the magnet .
In this way the coarse powder was obtained in a pure state ; it consisted of a very brittle , very magnetic , coarse powder , which dissolved easily in strong hydrogen nitrate .
Analysis gave the following results :\#151 ; I. II .

The material , as already stated , consisted of a coarse powder , of faceless irregular fragments of a very brittle constituent of the meteorite .
Search was accordingly made for crystals , and occasionally , but very rarely , larger bodies which might when broken up have formed this powder were hit upon .
One was met with , a large brass-coloured oblique crystal which readily cleaved across the base ; it was but slightly acted upon by hydrogen chloride or nitrate , both of which , however , on long continued boiling dissolve it slowly ; in aqua regia , on the other hand , it quickly disappears .
When heated a fragment of one of these crystals quickly became of a dark brown colour .

does not accord very well with the analysis of the powder , and the relation of one body to the other must be left till fresh material comes to hand .
VII .
Curious crystals with dark centres , occurring in the Cranhourne siderite .
Mention should here be made of a curious crystal which on two or three occasions was met with while searching through the debris of the meteorite .
It consisted apparently of a square prism , which , while the sides were quite bright and metallic , had a square centre of a dull almost black colour ; it very readily broke across the prism .
On Plate 53 , fig. 3 , is represented such a prism broken across , showing the dark centre .

The nickel-iron was further examined for occluded gases .
A portion of the nickel-iron borings removed from the under surface was selected and was heated in a porcelain tube connected with a Sprengel pump .

The metallic mass which I shall next proceed to describe is one of unusual interest in more than one respect : in the first place , before it fell only one iron meteorite was known to have fallen in Great Britain , while eight stony meteorites that have fallen in the British islands are in the national collection ; and , secondly , of the more than 300 meteorites which are contained in the collection in the Natural History Museum , more than 100 are unquestionably iron meteorites , and of these the fall of seven only has been witnessed .
The circumstances attending the fall of the Rowton iron are as follows .
At about 20 minutes to 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the 20th of April , 1876 , a strange rumbling noise was heard in the atmosphere , followed almost instantaneously by a startling explosion resembling a discharge of heavy artillery .
There was neither lightning nor thunder , but rain was falling heavily , the sky being obscured with dark clouds for some time both before and after the incident related .
About an hour after the explosion Mr. George Brooks had occasion to go to a turf field in his occupation adjoining the Wellington and Market Drayton Railway , about a mile north of the Wrekin , when his attention was attracted to a hole cut in the ground .
The land where it fell , it should be stated , is part of the property of the Duke of Cleveland , at Rowton , near Wellington , in Shropshire ; and Mr. Ashdown , the agent of the Duke , exerted himself in the matter , and obtained his Grace 's assent to the meteorite being presented to the trustees of the British Museum .
As regards the hole which was found in the field , Mr. Brooks probed the opening with a stick and discovered a lump of metal of irregular shape , which proved to be a meteorite , weighing 7f^ lbs. It had penetrated to a depth of 18 inches , passing through 4 inches of soil and 14 inches of solid clay down to the gravel .
The hole is nearly perpendicular , but the stone appears to have fallen in a south-easterly direction .
Some men were at work at the time within a short distance , and they , together with many other people in the neighbourhood , heard the noise of explosion .
According to other observers , the sound was heard as of something falling during a heavy shower of rain , accompanied by a hissing and then a rumbling noise .
It is , moreover , stated that when Mr. Brooks found the mass " it was quite warm .
" Mr. Wills described it as being black on the surface and apparently covered with a scale of metallic oxides ; but CRANBOURNE , ROWTON , AND MIDDLESBROUGH .
at the point where it impinged on the earth the oxides had been removed , and the metallic character of the mass had been revealed .
When the meteorite reached the British Museum it was at once seen that it was wholly metallic in structure and was covered with a very thin pellicle of the jet-black magnetic oxide of iron , and only where this had been removed by abrasion with the soil is the bright metallic surface of the nickel-iron revealed .
The depth to which the meteorite penetrated the Soil is proof of how much momentum still remained to it , partly due , no doubt , to the approximately vertical direction with which it entered the atmosphere , and in some degree to the higher density of an iron mass as compared with one of stone , the rocky meteorites rarely penetrating to so considerable a depth .
The meteorite closely resembles the siderite of Nedagolla , in India , as Professor Story-Maskelyne , M.P. , F.R.S. , has pointed out .
XI .
The nickel-iron of the siderite .
Some fragments which had been removed by the lapidary 's wheel were submitted to analysis , with the following results :\#151 ; I. II .

100*203 100*123 This nickel-iron has the composition closely approaching that of what may be called a normal nickel-iron\#151 ; in short , the metals are in the ratio in which they are met with in their oxides when precipitated from an iron solution , containing an excess of nickel oxide , by ammonia , both when a large excess of ammonium chloride is present and when it is absent .
As a result of several analytical determinations it was found to be : Iron ... ... ... ... ... ... ... = 0*1231 =91T2 Nickel ... ... ... ... . .

The troilite of the Rowton siderite .
One of the fragments of nickel-iron devoted to the analytical examination was found to contain a section of a nodule of troilite ; this easily dropped out of the iron ; where it was in close contact with the alloy it was covered with a very thin layer of graphite .
No cleavage planes were noticed on the specimen ; it was examined with a MDCCCLXXXII .
5 Y magnetic needle and found not to be in the slightest degree magnetic .
It was shown on analysis to have the composition : The protosulphide requires Sulphur ... ... ... ... ... = 36-073 36*36 Iron ... ... ... ... ... ... =[63-927 ] 63*64 100-000 100*00 Some fragments of the iron were sawn into very thin plates , and were kept quite cool all the time by a current of methylated spirit ; they were carefully dried and weighed , and the gas drawn from them when at a bright red-heat with a Sprengel pump .
The plates of iron taken measured 1*198 cub. centim. , and the gas collected after many hours ' heating was 6*38 times the bulk of the metal .
This is about double the quantity met with by Graham and Mallet in other meteoric irons which had lain a long time in the ground .
XIII .
The gases occluded by the Rowton nickel-iron .
After subtracting a little oxygen and the corresponding amount of nitrogen , due probably to the entrance of a little air into the apparatus , the gas was found to have the following percentage composition :\#151 ; Carbonic acid ... ... 5*155 Hydrogen ... ... ... ... ... ... .
77*778 Carbonic oxide ... ... 7 '3 4 5 Nitrogen ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
9*722 100*000 Plate 53 shows a drawing of the mass ( fig. 4 , actual size ) as well as a sketch of the figures developed by etching the surface with bromine ( fig. 5 ) ; they show larger figures than are usual , with less of the bright extruded ingredient , doubtless a compound rich in phosphorus .
The small darker-coloured rounded mass near the bottom of the section is a nodule of troilite .
XIV .
The Meteorite of Middlesbrough , Yorkshire .
During the past year a very beautiful specimen of a meteorite fell near Middlesbrough , in Yorkshire .
It struck the earth at a spot called Pennyman 's Siding , on the North-Eastern Railway Company 's branch line from Middlesbrough to Guis-brough , about one mile and three-quarters from the former town .
Its descent was witnessed by W. Ellinor and three platelayers , who heard a whizzing or rushing noise CRANBOURNE , ROWTON , AND MIDDLESBROUGH .
in the air followed in a second or two by a sudden blow of a body striking the ground not far from them : the spot was found to be 48 yards from where they stood .
The fall took place on the 14th March , 1881 , at 3*35 p.m. The wind was from the north-east , and it was a clear and bright but rather cold afternoon .
At more distant places , as Northallerton and four miles to the eastward , the sound resembled the boom of a gun ; no luminous or cloud-forming phenomena are reported .
The character of the hole , according to Professor Alexander Herschel , who at once visited the spot , points to the fall having been vertical or nearly so .
The stone was " new milk warm " when found , and weighed 3 lbs. 8\#163 ; oz. ; the dark surface is entirely fused and crusted , and has scarcely suffered by the fall .
The stone forms a low pyramid , slightly scolloped , inches in length , 5 inches wide , and 3 inches in height .
The rounded summit and sloping sides are scored and grooved deeply with a polish like black lead , in waving furrows running to the base , showing that this side came foremost during the fusing action of the atmosphere which the meteorite underwent in its flight .
The rear or base is equally fused or branded by heat , but is rough , dull brown in colour , and not scored or furrowed .
The meteorite penetrated the soil to a depth of 11 inches , and the penetration line apparently slopes about 10 ' from the vertical from the S.S.E. ; it passed through 7 or 8 inches of coke-ballast , and thereafter brick-earth or coarse clay to the remaining depth .
From experiments made by Professor Herschel on the power of penetration of a cast-iron model of the meteorite , it is calculated that the actual velocity of fall with which the stone struck the ground must have been 412 feet per second .
As it would acquire this velocity by falling freely through half-a-mile , it is clear how little of the original planetary speed with which it entered the atmosphere can have remained to affect its fall .
The interior of the stone has a greyish-white appearance , and is evidently for the most part composed of silicates : frequent bright metallic granules are to be seen , and they appear to be entirely or almost entirely granules of nickel-iron .
The rocky portion varies from grey to pure white , of which there are patches , and while the greater part appears to be homogeneous in structure , there are many enclosed chondra of large size and of a darker grey than the body of the stone .
In the well-developed markings of the exterior of the stone it bears a close resemblance , as Professor Herschel points out , to the meteorite of Karakol ( Kirgis Steppe , May 9th , 1840 ) , of which Professor Goebel gives a figure in his paper of 1866 in the * Melanges physiques et chimiques de l'Academie Imp^riale de St. Petersbourg/ vii .
, 318-324 .
The railway company , who at the time this notice was written retained possession of the stone , kindly permitted a few fragments to be removed for examination ; and I shall now proceed to describe the results of the chemical analysis of them .
It has since been presented to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society , and is now preserved in the museum at York .

The nickel-iron enclosed in the rocky constituents of the meteorite .
A quantity was dried and weighed and treated with mercury chloride , and it was found that 9*379 per cent , of constituents were removed .
As already stated , when examined under a microscope the metallic particles appeared to consist entirely , or almost entirely , of nickel-iron .
The nickel-iron was found to have the following composition :\#151 ; F Iron ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .76*990 Nickel ... ... ... ... ... ... 21*320 Cobalt ... ... ... ... ... ... 1'690 100*000 The remaining constituents , consisting of purely rocky matter , amounting to 90*621 per cent. , are thus composed :\#151 ; A. Soluble silicate . . . .
54*315 B. Insoluble silicate . . .
36*306 90*621 XVI .
The gelatinisable constituents of the rocky portion of the aerolite .
The soluble portion and the silicic acid belonging to that portion the following composition :\#151 ; Oxygen .
was found to have Silicic acid . . . .
41*100 Iron protoxide . . .
27*960 Magnesia ... ... ... ... . .
30*940 21*92 6*213 12*380 100*000 18*593 These numbers indicate the presence of one olivine of the form 2(-|Fe , -S-Mg)0 , SiOa or one closely resembling that which occurs in the Lance stone , which fell July 13th , 1872 , and was examined by DaubrAe .
No lime and no alumina were found in the soluble part , though carefully sought for .

The insoluble silicates in the rocky 'portion of the Middlesbrough aerolite .
The constituents of the insoluble part were as follow :\#151 ; Oxygen .
Silicic acid ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
55*389 29*541 Alumina , and a little chromium oxide 4*770 2*223 Iron protoxide ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 23*580 5*241 Lime ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

... ... ... ... ... ... . . .
11*043 4*417 Alkalies ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... not determined 10*907 99*155 If the chief silicate in the above portion be regarded as bronzite it most closely resembles that met with in the meteorites of Iowa Co. , Iowa , east of Marengo , which fell 12th February , 1875 ; * if , on the other hand , as is more probable , it be regarded as a lime-magnesia-iron augite it is closely allied to the augite of the stones of Stannern and J u yin as .
The aluminous constituent is doubtless labradorite , and is probably present as some of the occasional chondra which are seen in a microscopic section of the meteorite .
In Plate 53 the front furrowed side is shown in figs. 6 and 7 and the back view in fig. 8 .
They require no further explanation .
