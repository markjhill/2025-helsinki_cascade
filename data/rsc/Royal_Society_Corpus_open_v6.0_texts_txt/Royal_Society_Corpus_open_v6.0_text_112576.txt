" Note on the Secular Change of Magnetic Dip , as recorded at the Kew Observatory .

The President of this Society has already called the attention of the Fellows to the annual values of the magnetic inclination at Toronto , as deduced from the monthly determinations .
In doing so he remarked that " the general effect of the disturbances of the inclination at Toronto is to increase what would otherwise be the amount of that element ; therefore , if the disturbances have a decennial period , the absolute values of the inclination ( if observed with sufficient delicacy ) ought to show in their annual means a corresponding decennial variation , of which the minimum should coincide with the year of minimum disturbance , and the maximum with the year of maximum disturbance .
" At Toronto , where the true secular change is very small , the effect of this superimposed variation is very visible , so that the yearly values of the inclination appear to increase up to the period of maximum disturbance and to decrease after it .
At Kew the general effect of disturbances is probably the same as at Toronto-that is to say , tending to increase the inclination ; but the secular change being considerable , and tending to decrease the inclination , the joint effect of the secular change and the superposed variation might be expected to appear in a diminution of the yearly secular change for those years during which the disturbances are increasing from their minimum to their maximum value , and in an increase of the yearly secular change for those years during which the disturbances are decreasing from their maximum to their minimum .
The Kew records appear to exhibit a variation of this nature .
Observations of dip were commenced at the Kew Observatory in 1854 ; and by comparing a good number of observations taken during the latter months of 1854 , with two circles and four needles , with observations taken with the same circles and needles during the same months of 1855 , we obtain a yearly s2cular change of 2'"24 .
During the years from 1856 to 1859 inclusive , monthly observations were made with a circle known as the Kew circle , two needles being always used , and the mean of the two results taken as the true value of the dip .
From this circle we have the following results : Year .
Mean dip .
Yearly secular change .
o 1856 .
68 27-67 1857 .
24'36 3-31 1858 .
22*80 1-56 1859 .
20173 2-07 If we take the mean of these three values of yearly secular change , and also include that between 1854 and 1855 , we have a mean value of yearly secular change , for the period between 1854 and 1859 , amounting to 2'29 , and this value will not be sensibly altered if we omit the observations between 1854 and 1855 .
In 1859 it was resolved to substitute another circle for the Kew circle , as the action of the latter was not considered to be quite satisfactory ; and accordingly since this date Barrow 's circle No. 33 has been employed , and monthly observations have been made with it , generally in the afternooln-two needles being used , as before .
From this circle we have the following results : Year .
Mean dip .
Yearly secular change .
1860 .
68 20-21 1861 .
1821 .
2-00 1862 .
15)58 2-63 1863 .
12-66 2-92 1864 .
9'88 2-78 exhibiting between 1860 and 1864 a mean secular change of 2'"58 .
It will be noticed from this , that the mean yearly secular change of dip at Kew appears to be greater from 1860 to 1864 , a period of increasing disturbances , than from 1854 to 1859 , a period of decreasing disturbances .
Possibly the yearly decrement of dip has again begun to diminish , since the change from 1864 to 1865 is only 1'32 .
It is , however , premature to assert that this is the case , and it can only be decided by continuing the monthly observations .
At all events the Kew observations agree with those at Toronto in indicating that the yearly change of dip contains the combined result of two things-namely , the true secular change and the change due to disturbance ; and this ought to be borne in mind by future observers of this magnetic element .
