S. containing observations of a Comet seen at Valparaiso .
Read January lo , 1822 .
His Majesty 's ship Conway , MY DEAR SIR , Valparaiso , May 4 , i 82 .
I:HAVE much pleasure in sending you some observations which I have just made upon a comet that has been in sight here for 33 days .
It is now almost gone , and I scarcely hope to get another satisfactory observation of its place .
I was unfortunately in the interior of the country when it first appeared , so that it was not until the 8th of April that I was able to make any observation with accuracy .
Since that day I have determined its place , as you will see , for several other days , and I trust there are data enough to work upon .
ever sincerely your 's , &amp;c. &amp;c. BASIL HALL .

last observation made. .
A __:_ , X Vx_r _w_._r The foregoing right ascensions and declinations were determined by means of a wire micrometer attached to a power of about 8o .
The comet was always so near the horizon before it became visible , that on no evening during the whole month that it was observed , could its ARE and declination be measured more than once .
Unfortunately there were few known stars near the comet , so that it was often necessary to wait a considerable time before any one passed through the field of view .
The high range of hills which encircle Valparaiso , also , interfered with these observations , as the comet became hid sooner than it otherwise might have been .
During the first week the nucleus was very distinct , and might have been measured by the micrometer ; but I was then in the interior of the country , and did not commence observing it till the 8th , when the nucleus had become so indistinct as to render any measurements of this kind uncertain .
Lieutenant ROBERTSON of the Conway , assisted by Mr. FOSTER , midshipman of that ship , measured the angular distance of the comet from Aldebaran , Sirius , and Canopus , from its first appearance , until the splendour of the moonlight so far obliterated the comet , as to prevent any good distances being taken .
These distances are given here , as they may serve to determine the comet 's place , if required , for several days before the micrometrical observations were commenced .

On the second evening , the tail subtended an angle of 7 ?
, reaching to p Ceti : the northern part of the tail was the longest .
On the third , the appearance was much the same .
It was hid till the seventh by clouds : the tail then appeared shorter , and the nucleus less bright ; changes which at the time were ascribed to the interference of the moon 's light ; but which , I think , must have arisen from the increased distance of the comet .
The tail at first was nearly at right angles to the horizon , but at each succeeding night it inclined more to the south .
The time of its appearance was always very short , and that time was generally occupied with the adjustment of the micrometer , so that I was not enabled to draw it so frequently as I could have wished ; but these few sketches [ PI .
