259 i)In view of the light-ring Lk , and of the peculiar boiling annulus .\lt ; nd In , which may be called Ln , I have no doubt that Ln was , in fact , j* atinuation of the light-ring Lk , which latter , beyond question , was \#166 ; ..lily visible ; and under these circumstances it may be urged that y Vmsis surrounded by an atmosphere which at the time was made visible \gt ; toae extent of 2 " to under 4 " in breadth .
' ) As a matter of fact , the pear-drop and the ligament were visible at a heht of 2200 feet , but at 6500 feet the ligament was invisible .
The \lt ; .-iience generally of height of station , from this evidence , appears undent t ie ; but the phenomenon still remains to be accounted for definitely , i lowever , an effective atmosphere of breadth around Yenus be conoid , this atmosphere may be supposed to stop a certain amount of dint light from the sun , producing a slight shade around Yenus corre-o riding to the breadth x , This shade would , I conceive , be quite in vista when its outer edge is backed by the sun 's bright light ; but could - v jontract the sun to a diameter equal to that of Yenus plus twice x , mmake Yenus and the sun concentric , it appears likely that we should sea shaded annulus right round Yenus between her limb and that of the st ; further , that the annulus would appear darker at low than at mer altitudes , and would become invisible when the observer was raed above a sufficiency ofr the earth 's atmosphere .
Should these sigestions prove tenable , the ligament seen would break when the \gt ; er edge of the shade , corresponding to x , transited across the sun 's fib .
3 ) Solar light shining through Yenus 's atmosphere , if any , produces .alteration in the lines of the solar spectrum , so far as the dispersion o t single simple prism can show .
Also Yenus 's face , turned towards a reflects no light during transit , subject to the same instrumental test .

" Appendix to Note , dated November 1873 , on White Lines in the Solar Spectrum/ ' By J. B. N. Hennessey , F.R.A.S. Communicated by Professor Stokes , Sec. R.S. Received January 11 , 1875 .
Ifter detection of the white lines 1650 and 1658 ( KirchhofPs scale ) at 'issoorie in November 1873 , I discovered two other such lines before .'ring that station of observation , viz. 2009 and 2068 ( about ) .
On -:h November , 1873 , I packed up the spectroscope , taking particular ce that the prisms should not shift from the position they then c:upied .
On 28th November , 1873 , I set up the spectroscope in the Dome ( iservatory at Dehra , in the valley below , the prisms retaining their f mer position , and my recollection of the white lines seen at Mussoorie 260 On the Number of Figures in Primes .
j being still quite vivid .
I now found that 1650 and 1658 were distinct seen ; but they were no longer nearly of the pure white colour they pr sented at the higher station , while what may be termed the gloss aboi their whiteness , which induced me to describe them as resemblii " threads of white silk held in the light , " had quite disappeared ; indet they were now so decidedly greenish as not to invite attention .
Whi line 2068 I now could hardly see , and 2009 was invisible , notwithstani ing that I was quite familiar with the positions they occupied , and hs made careful notes on the subject .
After this I released the prisms and turned them about various !
without producing any alteration in the white lines as they were no seen .

The further extension of my previous Table HI .
has enabled me t add " 26 " ( see " Determination of a Prime Number , " Proc. Roy .
So\lt ; June 18 , 1874 ) to the list of complete resolutions ; for the factor lfl88| 13049 is smaller than 400002 , and is therefore a prime number .
in the same Table may now have the large factor somewhat redSP\#174 ; and stand as follows , since 34849=99 :\#151 ; 99 | 199.397.34849.36321 69409 21057 80278 45603 26475 97861 29249 67984 25182 29368 83 .
