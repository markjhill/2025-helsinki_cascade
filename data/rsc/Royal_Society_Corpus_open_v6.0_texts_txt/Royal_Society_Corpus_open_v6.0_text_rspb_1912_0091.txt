) In recent years it has become increasingly evident that many of the most important problems of physiology and of experimental pathology cannot be investigated in a satisfactory manner until accurate data have been made available regarding the quantitative differences which are exhibited by the organs , tissues , and fluids of the body in normal animals of different species and of varying weights .
Besults obtained with animals of any given weight cannot be applied , even within one and the same species , to yield conclusions regarding animals of a different weight until it has been determined with precision how the various organs and tissues of the body are related to the size of the individual .
Moreover , it will not be possible to compare one species with another , or to apply the results deduced from any given species to any other species of animal , until we can establish the existence of some kind of quantitative correlation between the measurements in different species .
That this will prove to be possible seems likely from an examination of the results already obtained by us in studying the various factors which influence the circulatory system and determine the size of the heart ( 1 ) .
In connection with our study of the blood and cardio-vascular system under normal and pathological conditions , it was shown that the blood volume of normal animals of any given species is proportional to their body surface , and follows the formula B = W where \amp ; is a constant for the species and n is approximately 0'70-0'72 ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) .
Accordingly it became of interest , in view of the theories which have been put forward regarding the volume of the blood and the size of the aorta in chlorotic conditions , to endeavour to determine how the size of the aorta is related to the weight of the individual in any given species of animal .
For this purpose we have made a series of measurements of the aorta in various mammals and birds ( 4 ) .
In the case of the birds some of the measurements which we have made use of were carried out by Mr. H. K. Fry Messrs. Dreyer , Kay , and Walker .
[ Sept. 30 , in connection with other work undertaken in the department in collaboration with one of us ( G. D. ) , but not yet published .
All the animals used were strong and healthy and in good condition .
They had been kept in the laboratory under as equable conditions as possible as regards food , etc. , and , of course , had not been employed in any previous experiment .
Pregnant animals were naturally excluded .
Methods.\#151 ; The animals were killed , the aorta divided just above the semilunar valves ( care being taken that the section should he accurately transverse ) , and a portion removed from the body by cutting through the aortic arch after careful dissection .
The proximal end of this portion of the aorta was then measured in the following manner:\#151 ; The severed artery is placed in a special holder , closing with parallel limbs by means of which a uniform and gentle pressure is applied to the vessel until its lumen is just obliterated , and the walls meet in a straight line along the middle of the closed vessel .
This straight line is then measured with fine-pointed compasses and the measurement pricked off on a piece of hard glazed drawing paper .
This length represents half the internal circumference ( 7rr ) of the vessel .
The external measurement is recorded in a similar manner .
The vessel is then released completely and the process repeated again and again until from four to eight independent measurements ( both internal and external ) have been recorded .
Great care is taken to avoid squeezing the vessel unduly .
At the same time sufficient pressure must he applied to ensure that the walls lie quite flat against each other .
The lengths thus pricked off upon the paper form a permanent record , and are subsequently measured by means of special callipers , fitted with a vernier scale which allows readings to be made to 1/ 20 mm. From the observed nrrthe radius and the sectional area of the vessel are determined .
The internal measurements are those made use of in the present communication , which deals only with the capacity of the vessel .
It must be observed that while the measurements which we have made give a reliable value for the ( internal ) circumference of the aorta within each species , they do not necessarily afford an absolute measure of the size of the vessel in these animals at any given phase of the circulation during life .
The method here made use of was selected because it proved to yield the best results in our hands , particularly in the case of small animals .
But it is open to considerable experimental error .
This source of fallacy , however , is greatly reduced by multiplying the number of individual observations of each artery .
It also diminishes greatly with increasing experience .
Own Observations.\#151 ; In all the tables the body weight recorded is the natural weight ( in grammes ) of the animal immediately before it was killed , 1912 .

( i.e. increasing more than sevenfold ) .
Prom this table it is at once evident that , as would be Messrs. Dreyer , Bay , and Walker .
[ Sept. 30 , expected , the radius of the aorta increases much more slowly than the weight of the animal .
The area of the aortic cross-section also increases more slowly than the body weight ( though of course much more rapidly than the radius ) , so that the ratio of the sectional area of the aorta to the body weight decreases steadily as the weight of the animal increases .
But it appears on calculation that the body weight ( W ) to the nth power ( where n is approximately O70-O72 ) divided by the sectional area ( A ) is a constant ( 7c ) .
This gives us the formula Wn/ A = which indicates that the sectional area of the aorta is a simple function of the surface of the body since , as was shown in a previous paper , the body surface , which can be calculated from the formula S = kWn is more accurately determined by taking n to be approximately 071 \#151 ; 072 than by taking it equal to 2/ 3 as was done by Meeh ( 5 ) .
Now it has been proved on former occasions that the blood volume is proportional to the body surface , hence it follows that the sectional area of the aorta is proportional to the blood volume of the individual .
Table I further shows that the average value of 7c is 24'9 , corresponding to an n of 0*71 , which is by calculation the best for these individuals , and that if the aortic cross-section be calculated from our formula A = using these values for n and k , the average percentage deviation between calculated and observed values is 16'44 .
If , on the other hand , the sectional area is expressed as a percentage of the body weight ( 078 ) , the average deviation between the calculated and the observed values is 19'68 per cent. It may be stated further that if the value 072 is taken for n , the average value of k becomes 26'5 , and , if the sectional area is calculated from A = W0'72/ 26'5 , the average percentage deviation between the calculated and the observed figures is found to be 16*53 .
In order to bring out the various points more clearly , to get rid of irregularities due to individual variations in the animals , and to diminish the influence of experimental error , the animals have been grouped in Table II .
In this table the guinea-pigs are arranged in five groups according to weight , and the weights , the aortic radii , and the aortic cross-sections of the animals in each group averaged .
The other figures are calculated from these average values .
It is found that , under these circumstances , the best n is 072 ( exactly as we found to be the case in calculating the surface from the body weight ) , and the average value of 1c is 25*6 .
Using these values for n and k , the average deviation between the calculated and the observed figures is 2 97 pei cent. , whereas , if the sectional area be calculated as a percentage ( 0*78 ) of the body weight , the average percentage deviation becomes 14'2 , that is to say , nearly five times as large .
Moreover , it will be observed that , while the k 1912 .

As regards the question of sex , if the males and females be considered separately in Table I , it will be seen that the average for the 18 males is smaller than the k for the 17 females .
Thus , with n equal to 071 , the for the males is 23-9 , and that for the females 26 , while with n equal to 072 , is 25*4 for the males and 27*6 for the females , indicating in each case that the male animals had somewhat larger aortas than had the females of corresponding weights .
But this is a point to which we shall return .
In Table III are given the figures and calculations for the aortas of 27 rats , ranging in weight from SOT to 303 grm. increasing more than tenfold ) .
The average aortic constant ( k ) is 21*37 , with an of 0*71 , which is the best n for these observations , and the average aortic percentage { i.e. sectional area of aorta expressed as a percentage of body weight ) is T27 .
It is seen that , as in the case of the guinea-pigs , the variations of the aortic constant show no periodicity , but the aortic percentage decreases markedly and steadily , although not regularly , as the animals increase in weight .
If the area of the aortic cross-section is calculated by our formula , the average deviation between the calculated and the observed figures is 11*09 per cent. , while it is 19*72 per cent. , or nearly twice as large , when the area is calculated in per cent , of body weight .
If the value 0*72 be taken for becomes 22*36 , and , if these values be used in calculating the sectional aortic area by our formula , the average percentage deviation of the observed from the calculated figures is 11*37 per cent. Messrs. Dreyer , Ray , and Walker .

In Table IV the rats are arranged in six groups according to weight , and the aortic constant and aortic percentage are calculated from the average figures of these groups .
As in the case of the grouped guinea-pigs , the best n is 0'72 , giving an average k of 21-9 .
It will be observed that in these grouped animals the variations in the aortic constants of the groups are very small and are non-periodic , while the aortic percentage falls markedly and very regularly from 1-67 to 0-96 .
Using the values just stated for n and k , the average deviation between the calculated and the observed figures for the aortic cross-section is only 1T8 per cent. , while it is 16'22 per cent , ( nearly 14 times as large ) if the area be calculated in per cent , of body weight .

In this case the best is 0-71 , giving an average Jc of 22-1 .
The variations in the aortic constant are without periodicity , but the aortic percentage falls gradually , though not quite regularly , from 0"856 in the lightest , to 0'484 in the heaviest group .
Using the above values for n and Jc , the average deviation of the observed figures from the calculated is 7'26 per cent. , while it is 26"08 per cent , ( between three and four times as great ) ' if the area be calculated as a percentage of body weight .
We now return to examine the question of sex as regards its bearing on the size of the aorta in these mammals .
Since the number of our observations within any one of the species can hardly be regarded as sufficient to justify a general inference , we have taken all three species of animals together and made the figures comparable , inter se , by reducing them in terms of a common standard .
When this is done , and the male and female animals are taken separately , it appears that the sectional area of the aorta in the male expressed as a function of the body surface is about 3 per cent , greater than it is in a 1912 .

47 female of the same weight .
This is of special interest in view of the fact that a difference of the same size and character was observed b}^ two of us in the blood volume of male and female rabbits .
It may be noted , further , in this connection that , so far as we have yet ascertained from our data , the heart in the male animal is somewhat larger than in the female of the same body weight and species .

That the value 071 for n is very nearly as good as the " best " n ( 070 ) is shown by the fact that while the average deviations per cent , are 2-87 and 3T2 respectively with n = 0*70 and n = 071 , the mean Messrs. Dreyer , Ray , and Walker .

If the value 0*71 be taken for n the value of k becomes 5*55 , and with an n of 0*72 k is 6*13 .
Taking n as 071 the average percentage deviation of the observed values from those calculated by our formula is 3*16 as compared with the deviation of 3'08 per cent , with n equal to 070 .
Or if the appropriate allowance be made for the number of individuals in each of the groups , the figures for the average percentage deviation of the observed values from the theoretical values given by our formula are 2'69 with an n of 070 and 273 with n of 071 , indicating the fact that the value 071 for n is only very slightly less good in these observations than the value 070 .
Thoma himself , who , in his great monograph ( 7 ) on the size and weight of the various parts of the human body under normal and diseased conditions , endeavoured to establish a definite quantitative relation between the body weight and the aortic radius , defined the correlation which he found to exist in the statement that the body weight divided by the cube of the aortic radius was approximately constant over a wide range of weight .
This he expressed in the formula W/ rz = K. The formula was purely empirical , and possessed no special biological significance , though it represented the experimental data in an extremely satisfactory manner .
It will be seen , however , that it is readily transformable into the formula W5/ 7rr2 = k , which is the formula deduced by us from our observations e 2 Messrs. Dreyer , Ray , and Walker .
[ Sept. 30 , upon animals ( Wn/ A = k ) if one gives the value S or 0'67 instead of 0-70-0-72 , as we have found it to be .
This latter formula is a rational formula , since it indicates , as has already been pointed out , that the aortic area ( like the blood volume ) is a function of the body surface .

In Table XIII we have calculated K for Thoma 's figures from the formula W/ rn = K , first giving n the value 3 as in Thoma 's formula , and then giving it the value 2-82 , which corresponds to n = 071 in our formula , and is the best n for Thoma 's observations .
It then appears that if the aortic radius be calculated by means of these values of K the average percentage deviation between r calculated and r observed is 1-70 when n has the value 3 , while it is only 1-56 when n has the value 2-82 .
Moreover , if the appropriate allowance be made for the number of individuals in each group the figures become 1"65 with n taken as 3 , and 1*35 with taken as 2-82 .
It will , of course , readily be apprehended that differences of this amount in the radius assume a considerable importance when calculations are made by area { i.e. nr2 ) , as is necessary in referring the aortic area to the body surface .
In Table XIY are tabulated our main results arranged in such a manner as to show at a glance the range of weight , the best n , the value of the percentage deviation , and so forth for each species of animal .

[ Sept. 30 , our animals together the average percentage deviation for the individual animals between the calculated and the observed figures for the aortic area is 9-9 7 when the calculation is made in terms of the body surface , while it is 24'55 ( two and a-half times as great ) when the area is expressed in percentage of body weight .
The corresponding figures for the grouped animals are 3-15 and 15-35 per cent , respectively , a deviation nearly five times as large .
Attention may further be drawn to the fact that although the technique of these aortic measurements is in the nature of the case much less exact than that employed by two of us in measuring the blood volume , and therefore gives much larger figures for the percentage deviation , yet this deviation is found to be reduced to precisely the same extent in both cases by grouping the animals .
Thus in the present instance the ratio between individual and grouped percentage deviations ( of course reckoning by the body surface ) is 9'97/ 3-15 , i.f. 3-2 , while in the case of the blood volume experiments it was 4-43/ 1-39 , or 3-2 again .
From the table it is also clearly seen that the greater the range of weight of the animal observed the more misleading and erroneous is the result obtained by calculating the aortic area in percentage of the body weight .
Thus , while in the case of the ptarmigan and sparrow , where we have only a small range of weight , the difference is comparatively small , in the case of ducks , fowls , and rats , which show the widest range , the difference may properly be spoken of as enormous , being from 13-5 to 16*7 times as large .
This shows that if one were to attempt to calculate the sectional area of the aorta of a small animal , for example , from the ascertained aortic area of a large one of the same species , expressed as a percentage of body weight , the result would inevitably be grossly misleading , while if it were calculated by our formula a true estimate would be obtained , correct within the limits of the experimental errors .
In Table XV are given the mean deviations as calculated by tne method of least squares for the eight species concerned in these observations , both individually and grouped .
From the averages of these it can be seen that if one were to make only a single observation and this differed by 30 per cent , from the theoretical value given by our formula it would be probable that the aortic area in question was abnormal in size , while if it were expressed as a percentage of body weight it would have to differ from the theoretical area by at least 60 per cent , before one could say with the same degree of certainty that it was abnormal .
If , however , a series of observations were made and averaged , it follows from our figures for the mean deviation for grouped animals that if the difference between this average and the theoretical value given by our 1912 .

But if the measurements were expressed in percentage of body weight it would only be possible to say with the same degree of certainty that the aortic area of an animal was abnormal when it differed from the calculated value by 60 per cent. Conclusion .
Within a wide range of weight in any given species of warm-blooded animal the sectional area of the lumen of the aorta is proportional to the body surface , and can be calculated from the body weight by means of the formula A = W n/ k , where n has the value 0,70-0-72 and is a constant to be ascertained for each particular species .

) The analysis of data collected in connection with the investigation of a number of problems in immunity has led to a series of results , in part already published , bearing upon the blood and circulation .
The conclusion was reached that in certain cases a precise and definite relationship to the body surface exists in warm-blooded animals in accordance with the formula Wn/ a \#151 ; k , where W is the body weight of the animal , a represents the mass of the body fluid , tissue , or organ under investigation , is a constant , and the value of n is approximately 0'70-0'72 .
In view of the fact that the carriage of oxygen is one of the chief functions of the circulation , and that the volume of the blood ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and the aortic area ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( area of cross-section of aorta ) , have been shown by us to be proportional to the body surface in warm-blooded animals , while , as we have also found , the total oxygen capacity is the main factor in determining the size of the heart ( 5 ) , it appeared to be of interest to examine the size of the channel by which the oxygen gains access to the lungs .
Accordingly , the trachea was measured in two species of mammal and one bird , namely , guinea-pig , rabbit , and ptarmigan .
The animals used were healthy individuals in good condition , not previously experimented upon ,
