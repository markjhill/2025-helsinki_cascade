22 Effect of the Spectrum on Haloid Salts of Silver .
[ Dec. 12 , The anatomy of the part and the relation of the fibres to the basal ganglia are then discussed , and a full description given of each of the groups examined .
The general results are next given at length , of which the following is a resume .
Firstly , the rare occurrence of bilateral movement is discussed , and the meaning of the phenomenon defined .
Secondly , the lateral arrangement and juxtaposition of the fibres are considered .
Thirdly , the antero-posterior order in which the fibres for the movements of the different segments are placed is described , and that order found to be practically identical with that observed on the cortex , viz. , from before back .
Movements of eyes .
" head .
, , tongue .
" mouth , " upper limb ( shoulder preceding thumb ) .
" trunk .
" lower limb ( hip preceding toes ) .
The character or nature of these movements is set out in a table giving the average localisation of each segment .
Speaking generally , it may be said that the movements are arranged in the same way as has already been shown by the authors to exist in the cortex ( vide pievious papers in ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1887 , 1888 ) , viz. , that the representation of extension is situated in front of that of flexion for the segments of the upper limb , while for the toes flexion is obtained , as in the cortex , in front of extension .
Numerous tables and diagrams are appended , showing the extent of appropriation of fibres for each movement .
