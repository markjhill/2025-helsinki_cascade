V. " Memoir on the Symmetric Functions of the Roots of an Equation .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received December 18 , 1856 .
( Abstract .
) There are contained in a work , which is not , I think , so generally known as it deserves to be , the ' Algebra ' of Meyer Hirsch , some very useful tables of the symmetric functions up to the tenth degree of the roots of an equation of any order .
It seems desirable to join to these a set of tables , giving reciprocally the expressions of the powers and products of the coefficients in terms of the symmetric functions of the roots .
The present memoir contains the two sets of tables , viz. the new tables distinguished by the letter ( a ) , and the tables of Meyer Hirsch distinguished by the letter ( b ) ; the memoir contains also some remarks as to the mode of calculation of the new tables , and also as to a peculiar symmetry of the numbers in the tables of each set , a symmetry which , so far as I am aware , has not hitherto been observed , and the existence of which appears to constitute an important theorem in the subject .
The theorem in question might , I think , be deduced from a very elegant formula of M. Borchardt ( referred to in the sequel ) , which gives the generating function of any symmetric function of the roots , and contains potentially a method for the calculation of the tables ( 6 ) , but which , from the example I have given , would not appear to be a very convenient one for actual calculation .
