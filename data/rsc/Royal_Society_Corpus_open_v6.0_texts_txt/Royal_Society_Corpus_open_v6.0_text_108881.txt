On a New Series of Bodies in whitch Nitrogen is stubstituted for Hydrogen .
By PETER GRIESS , Esq. Communicated by A. W. HOFMANN .
Received June 2 , -Read June 16 , 1864 .
IN some former papers* I have had occasion to describe a peculiar class of nitrogencompounds , obtained by the action of nitrous acid upon amido-compounds , by the exchange of some of the hydrogen of the latter for the nitrogen of the nitrous acid .
This substitution may be effected in two different ways ; accordingly every amido-compound may give rise to two distinctly different series of bodies .
By viewing the amidocompounds as constructed according to the general formula Q xHy_ ( N B3 ) Qt , the changes may be expressed as follows : I. 2[.C H,1_2(N 1H3)t -Oz]+NH 02 -G 2 H2(Y-2)(N 113 ) " ( N2)"0 2Z+2 H2 II .
-G H(y-2 ) ( N H3 ) " Oz +NH 2=--CH(y_2)(N2)0 " z+2H20 .
In the first equation one atom of nitrogen is substituted for three atoms of hydrogen contained in two atoms of the amido-compound , but in the second the substitution affects only one atom of the latter .
I have hitherto directed my attention more particularly to the members of the first group , whether derived from amido-acids ( such as diazo-amidobenzoic acid ) , or whether corresponding to amido-bases ( diazo-amidobenzol ) .
The bodies which I now shall have to describe in this communication are derived according to the second of the above general equations , and I have restricted myself almost entirely to the study of those which can thus be obtained from aniline and similar bases .
With regard to the chemical nature of these bodies , I may mention generally that they are capable of combining with acids and bases , but that their basic character preponderates .
They are remarkable for the great variety of compounds which they produce , such as is not met with in any other portion of the field of organic chemistry .
When in the free state they are remarkable for their instability ; their compounds , however , are somewhat more stable ; and it is for that reason that the latter have chiefly engaged my attention , and have been employed in the experiments to be described hereafter .
The very striking physical properties of these bodies , as well as the large number of products of decomposition to which they give rise , likewise deserve to be specially noticed .
Altogether they may be looked upon as one of the most interesting groups of organic compounds .
I have avoided , as much as possible , discussing their rational composition , and have abstained from theoretical speculation .
I have , however , come to the conclusion that the two atoms ( or the molecule ) of nitrogen , N2 , they contain must be considered as equivalent to two atoms of hydrogen , and it is in accordance with this view that the names of the new compounds have been framed .
PART I.-COMPOUNDS OF DIAZOBENZOL .
Nitrate of Diabenzol , 6 H4 N , NHO3 This substance can be prepared in various ways ; most readily , however , by acting with nitrous acid upon a solution of nitrate of aniline .
This salt of aniline is not very soluble in cold water ; therefore , in order to obtain a concentrated solution of the new compound , it is best to make a thick paste by grinding up a portion of the nitrate with water and submitting it to the action of the gas , when the undissolved portion of the aniline-salt rapidly disappears , and the whole is converted into the new body .
The reaction being accompanied by considerable increase of temperature , it is necessary to keep the solution cool , and to guard against passing a too^rapid current of the gas .
The temperature of the solution should not rise : much above 30 ?
C. The operation is interrupted as soon as the whole of the aniline has disappeared .
This can be ascertained by adding a little strong solution of potassa to a portion of the liquid on a watch-glass , when , if no more aniline is liberated , it may safely be inferred that the reaction is complete .
The nitrate of diazobenzol is almost insoluble in ether , and even in ether mixed with much dilute alcohol , in consequence of which it may readily be obtained in a crystalline state thus : the solution is first filtered , to remove traces of a brown resin , then mixed with about three times its volume of strong alcohol , and ether added until the precipitation is complete .
The crystals are allowed to subside , and then filtered from the mother-liquor .
The small quantity of the new body which remains in the mother-liquor may be neglected altogether , as its recovery is accompanied with great difficulty .
To remove the last traces of colouring matter , the crystals are taken up with cold dilute alcohol .
and reprecipitated by the addition of ether , when they are obtained as long white needles .
Analysis , as will be shown further , proves that the new compound has the formula C6 H4 N2 , NHO3 .
Its formation may be explained by the following equation:-C6H7N , NHO3 + NHO2 = C6 H4N2 , NHO + 2H20 .

, Nitrate of diazobenzol .
Water .
668 Another method of preparing nitrate of diazobenzol is based upon the action of nitrous acid upon diazo-amidobenzol , a body described in a previous communication to the Royal Society .
On dissolving this latter compound in cold ether , and passing a current of nitrous acid gas through the solution , long acicular crystals of the new substance soon appear .
The action should be continued as long as crystals form .
The compound so obtained is collected on a filter and washed with ether .
The reaction is expressed by the following equation:-12 H11 N3+NHO2+2NHO3=2(C6 4 N2 , NH )+22O .
Diazo-amidobenzol .
Nitrate of diazobenzol .
However elegant and simple this method of preparation of the nitrate of diazobenzol may appear , it will scarcely ever be employed , since it involves the previous preparation of diazo-amidobenzol , a body which it is rather troublesome to obtain in large quantities .
Nitrate of diazobenzol can also be procured by the direct action of nitrous acid upon a mixture of aniline with about four times its volume of alcohol .
The gas is passed into the alcoholic solution till , on the addition of ether to a small portion of it , a copious precipitation of white acicular crystals is produced .
When this point is reached , the whole of the reddish-brown solution is mixed with ether , and the precipitate purified as already described .
This method of preparing the nitrate , however , is not suitable when large quantities have to be prepared .
It is similar in principle to the preparation by means of diazo-amidobenzol , since to all appearance the aniline is first converted into this compound .
The methods just described , although simple , will only give favourable results when strict attention is paid to the directions given above ; for it happens sometimes , and especially when the temperature of the solution is allowed to rise too high , that a copious evolution of nitrogen gas ensues , which cannot be stopped by any means before the whole of the substance has been destroyed .
By employing the first of the above processes , it is sometimes found that , on the addition of ether to the weak alcoholic solution of the crude compound , no crystals separate , but that an aqueous layer is deposited at the bottom of the vessel .
This , however , only happens when an insufficient amount of alcohol has been originally added to the solution , because in this case the ether , not being able to mix with the liquor , causes no separation of crystals to take place .
If this occurs , it is best to remove the ethereal liquor , and to dilute the residuary aqueous solution with strong alcohol , when , on the addition of ether , crystallization invariably ensues .
The nitrate of diazobenzol , by whatever method it may have been prepared , crystallizes in long white needles , which have been obtained several inches in length and are very soluble in water , less so in alcohol , and almost insoluble in ether and benzol .
They can be dried over sulphuric acid without undergoing any change .
Heated even below 100 ?
C. , they explode with unparalleled violence , far surpassing that of fulminating mer4u2 669 cury or iodide of nitrogen .
About a gramme of this substance causes by its explosion a concussion like that produced by firing a pistol .
The destructive action of such an explosion is likewise extreme .
Iron slabs of several lines in thickness were found smashed to atoms when a somewhat larger quantity was exploded upon them .
Friction , pressure , and concussion also cause it to explode .
The smallest particles of this substance , accidentally dropped upon the floor of a room , when trodden upon when dry , gave rise to a series of explosions attended with flashes of light .
The properties of the nitrate of diazobenzol render it absolutely necessary that the greatest precaution should be observed when manipulating it .
The portion of the substance required for analysis having been well washed with ether* , was placed in a platinum crucible and dried over sulphuric acid .
Concussion or pressure had to be carefully avoided , especially with the dry substance , on account of its great explosiveness .
For the above-mentioned reasons I abstained from analyzing this compound in the usual manner , especially as I had opportunities of ascertaining the composition of analogous but less dangerous compounds by the ordinary analytical method .
I have , however , been enabled to arrive at a knowledge of the composition of nitrate of diazobenzol by the very interesting change which an aqueous solution undergoes by the action of heat .
By ebullition the compound is transformed under the influence of the water into carbolic acid , nitrogen , and nitric acid ; and by estimating the quantities of the two latter products I have arrived at the true composition of the explosive substance .
-C6 114 N2 , NH03+H2 O=C6 H6 O+NH03+N2 .
Nitrate of diazobenzol .
Carbolic acid .
The method employed for the determination of the qualntity of nitrogen evolved by thy ebullition of the aqueous solution of the explosive compound is as follows : The solution was introduced into a flask and a stream of carbonic acid gas passed through it .
When the air was expelled , the delivery-tube was placed under a graduated cylinder containing solution of potassa , and the contents of the flask heated to ebullitiont .

of aniline .
On account of the slight solubility of sulphate of aniline , and in ordcler to avoid employing a large quantity of liquid , it becomes necessary to suspend the salt in water , and to expose it in this state to the action of nitrous acid .
The reaction , however , is very slow , and the salt is only gradually converted into the diazo-compound .
I found it therefore more convenient to prepare the sulphate from the nitrate of diazobenzol , by treating a concentrated aqueous solutiont of the latter with a sufficient quatntity of sulphuric acid , previously diluted to avoid rise of temperature upon addition .
The solution thus obtained is then mixed with three times its volume of absolute alcohol , and lastly with a sufficient amount of ether , which causes the sulphate of diazobenzol , together with some water , to separate in a layer at the bottom of the vessel , the liberated nitric acid , together with the excess of sulphuric acid , remaining mixed with the supernatant alcohol and ether .
This latter is decanted , and the solution of the sulphate ( with a view to the removal of a further quantity of water ) is once more treated with absolute alcohol and reprecipitated by means of ether .
The precipitated liquid is then placed in flat dishes over sulphuric acid , when it soon solidifies to a magmia of white crystals .
In order to purify these crystals completely , they are washed on a filter with a mixture of alcohol and ether , which removes any trace of sulphuric and carbolic acids which may have been produced by a partial decomposition of the sulphate of diazobenzol , then dissolved in weak cold alcohol , and precipitated by the addition of ether .
The crystals are separated without delay from the mother-liquor and dried over sulphuric acid .

The aqueous as well as the alcoholic solution is decomposed on boiling with evolution of gas .
Exposed to the air , this compound attracts moisture very rapidly and becomes liquid , and gradually decomposes .
Heated alone , it deflagrates feebly at about 100 ?
C. Hydrobromate of D)iazobenzol , 6 T14 N2 , HBr .
This compound is prepared by the action of bromine upon diazo-amidobenzol .
When an ethereal solution of bromine is gradually added to a rather concentrated solution of the diazo-amido-compound , each drop of the bromine-solution is seen to produce a precipitation of the hydrobromate of diazobenzol .
When no more crystals are formed the precipitate is separated from the mother-liquor , washed with ether till quite white , and then dried over sulphuric acid .
All these operations must be performed as speedily as possible , since the new compound is of a very unstable nature and rapidly decomposes .
Should it be found necessary to recrystallize the precipitate , it must be dissolved in the least possible quantity of cold alcohol , and ether added to the solution till no more precipitation takes place .

The solution of this compound is distinguished by a strong acid reaction .
Heat , friction , and pressure cause the crystals of the hydrobromate to explode with the same violence as the nitrate of diazobenzol .
Even when in a perfectly dry state this compound can only be kept for a short time without undergoing decomposition ( which is accompanied by the production of a peculiar aromatic odour ) , the decomposition being complete in a few days .
It is formed according to the equation C12R 1 N3+6Br--G6H4 N2 , HBr+C6H4Br3N+2HBr .

diazobenzol .
Tribromaniline remains in the ethereal mother-liquor , from which it crystallizes on evaporation .
It is most likely that , by the action of chlorine upon diazo-amidobenzol , hydrochlorate of diazobenzol may be obtained .
An aqueous solution of this latter compound , however , may also be prepared by treating a solution of the hydrobromate with moist chloride of silver .
Perbromide of D)iazobenzol , C6 H4 N2 , HBr , Br2 .
On adding a small quantity of bromine-water to an aqueous solution of the nitrate of diazobenzol , a white crystalline precipitate of tribromophenylic acid is usually obtained , owing to the presence of a small quantity of phenylic acid formed by the spontaneous decomposition of the nitrate by water .
On removing the tribromophenylic acid as quickly as possible by filtration , and on the addition of a large excess of bromine-water containing free hydrobromic acid to the filtrate , the new bromine-compound separates as a brownish-red oil , which solidifies to a crystalline mass soon after the supernatant liquor has been removed .
The crystals are obtained pure for analysis by washing with a little ether .

60 N2 28 8-12 Br3 240 69-56 70-89 345 100'00 Perbromide of diazobenzol , which crystallizes in yellow plates , is insoluble in water , rather difficultly soluble in alcohol , and insoluble in ether .
It is comparatively stable when in a dry state .
Its alcoholic solution , on the other hand , rapidly decomposes , even in the cold , with evolution of gas .
For this reason it is impossible to recrystallize it without loss .
In order to purify this unstable perbromide , it is most advantageous to dissolve it in cold alcohol , and to allow the solvent to evaporate spontaneously in shallow vessels in the open air .
Very fine crystals are usually obtained in this manner , but contaminated with trifling quantities of ain oily product of decomposition , which , however , may be removed by washing with a little cold ether .
On application of heat this compound deflagrates at a comparatively low temperature .
The constitution of the perbromide of diazobenzol seems the same as the periodide of tetrethylammonium and similar compounds of other bases .
Platinum-salt of Hydrockilorate of Diazobenzol , -C6 -14 N2 H C1 , Pt C12 , is obtained by the addition of bichloride of platinum to a rather concentrated aqueous solution of the nitrate of diazobenzol .
The fine yellow prisms which are precipitated are almost insoluble in alcohol and ether .
They are rather stable ; when kept for some time , however , they acquire a brownish colour , and are gradually but completely decomposed .
On heating they defagrate , hence it is impossible to estimate the platinum by simple ignition .

By the addition of terchloride of gold to a dilute aqueous solution of the nitrate of diazobenzol , this compound is obtained in the form of a light-yellow crystalline precipitate , insoluble in water , but soluble in alcohol , especially when warm , from which , on cooling , it is deposited in the form of small golden-yellow plates .
This salt cannot , however , be recrystallized without some loss , especially when the alcoholic solution is heated to boiling .
The decomposition is indicated invariably by an evolution of gas ; continued boiling with alcohol destroys it completely .

4437 44-36 It is well known that when bromine , chlorine , or hyponitric acid is substituted inll organic compounds for certain hydrogen atoms , the product formed is distinguished from the original compound , if the latter be an acid , by stronger acid properties , or if a base , by less pronounced basic characters ; and also that the contrary is observed in the case of substitution of potassium , NH2 , &amp;c. for the same hydrogen atoms .
Nitrogen , however , exhibits in this respect a peculiar double nature , since it is found only slightly ( or not at all ) to affect the basic properties of a compound , whilst at the same time it exerts so decided an acidulating action as to impart to strong bases an acid nature .
I have already clearly shown that diazobenzol has all the characters of an organic base , capable , like aniline , of forming with acids saline compounds .
It possesses , at the same time , the property of combining with metallic hydrates , playing , to a certain extent , the part of an acid .
These metallic derivatives are , as a rule , distinguished by the same instability as the compounds of diazobenzol with acids .
They are less affected , however , by heat .
Their aqueous or alcoholic solutions can be heated to boiling for some time without suffering complete decomposition .
Heated alone they explode , although at a much higher temperature , and not with so great violence as the bodies previously described .
The compounds which are soluble in water are mostly well crystallized , whilst the insoluble ones , such as those formed with silver and lead , are obtained as amorphous precipitates .
Compound of flydrctte of Potassium with _Diazobenzol , -C6 H4 N2 , KHO .
By introducing a very concentrated solution of nitrate of diazobenzol into an excess of an equally concentrated solution of caustic potash , drop by drop , a yellowish liquid is obtained possessing a peculiar aromatic odour , and solidifying , by evaporation in the water-bath , to a crystalline mass .
This is a mixture of the compound of hydrate of potassium with diazobenzol and nitre , together with a brownish-red amorphous bodythe result of a secondary reaction , which a portion of the original substance undergoes , and which is always indicated by the evolution of gas .
In order to separate these bodies it is necessary to remove the excess of caustic potash .
This is best done by putting the crystalline mass into a strong linen cloth and squeezing it powerfully between porous stones .
The dry cake is then treated with absolute alcohol , which readily dissolves the compound of hydrate of potassium with diazobenzol , leaving the nitrate of potassium insoluble ; it is then separated by filtration .
The alcoholic filtrate ( which , on account 3 of the above-mentioned secondary product of delecomposition , possesses an intense reddishbrown colour ) is then evaporated on the water-bath .
The residue is once more pressed and washed with a mixture of alcohol and ether to remove the reddish-brown substance , when the compound is obtained nearly white .
By again pressing and dissolving the dry cake in a small quantity of absolute alcohol , filtering , and adding a sufficient amount of ether , the substance is obtained in white plates , which must be dried at once over sulphuric acid .

The solution has a strong alkaline reaction .
A freshly prepared aqueous solution is but slightly coloured ; but by keeping for a short time it rapidly acquires a yellow colour , and ultimately a reddish-yellow substance is precipitated .
Ebullition does not seem to accelerate this decomposition materially .
The dry substance is very stable , and can be kept a long time unchanged .
Heated alone it explodes at a little above 130 ?
; the explosion is accompanied by a slight report .
Cornpotond of HyIdrate of Silver with Diazobenzol , C6 H4 N2 , Ag HO * .
This is obtained as a white or slightly chocolate-coloured precipitate , by treating a freshly prepared solution of the previous compound with a solution of nitrate of silver .

It is distinguished by great stability ; for even after having been kept for weeks , not the least sign of decomposition could be discovered .
Exposed to a higher temperature it explodes with some violence .
Since the constitution of the two compounds just described affords sufficiently fixed data for establishing the composition of other combinations of metallic hydrates with diazobenzol , I have not thought it necessary to extend my analyses to the other salts .
Their preparation and constitution , moreover , present no important characteristics , and I will therefore describe them very briefly .

It is precipitated in the form of white , microscopic , indistinct needles or plates , which become yellowish in consequence of a gradual decomposition .
It is difficultly soluble in water .
The compound of diazobenzol with hydrate of zinc is a white amorphous powder insoluble in water .
The compound with hydrate of lead is also a white powder , but acquiring rapidly a yellow colour .
With sulphate of copper a brown precipitate changing to green is obtained .
Mercurial chloride gives no precipitate .
Diazobenzol , C6 114 N2 .
This remarkable substance is obtained when an aqueous solution of the compound of hydrate of potassium with diazobenzol is treated with a sufficient quantity of acetic acid .
A thick yellow oil is liberated , which possesses a peculiar odour , and is remarkable for its extraordinary instability .
Its existence is very ephemeral , and after a short time nitrogen gas begins to be evolved , and the oil is rapidly converted into a brownish-red substance .
The heat which is produced when larger quantities of the oil undergo this spontaneous decomposition is sufficient to give rise to dangerous explosions .
The addition of ether to the oil dissolves it instantaneously , producing a red solution , a tumultuous evolution of gas taking place .
It combines with nitric and sulphuric acids , and with hydrate of potassa , terchloride of gold , &amp;c. , forming the compounds previously described .
4 x2 Diazo-amidobenzol , as is well known , is formed by the action of nitrons acid upon an alcoholic solution of aniline , according to the equation 2C6 H7 N+NH-0-2= C2 Hl N3+2H20 .
Aniline .
Diazo-amidobenzol .
By viewing this body as a double compound of diazobenzol and aniline , C12 13 -{C6 H7 NI was led to prepare it by the direct action of aniline upon compounds of diazobenzol .
This reaction proceeds readily on 1ixing an aqueous solution of nitrate of diazobenzol with aniline , when a viscid yellow mass is speedily produced , which becomes crystalline after a short time , and which can be obtained in a perfectly pure state by several recrystallizations * from alcohol .
The formation of the diazo-amidobenzol may be expressed as follows : C6 114 N2 , NH03+2 C6 H7 N= C12 Hll N3+C-6 H7 N NHE3 .

On referring to the equation given on page 669 for the formation of nitrate of diazobenzol from diazo-amidobenzol , C12 Hn N3 + N19I2 + 2NHO3=2(C6 H4 N2 , NHO3)+2H2 0 , it is seen that these two bodies may be readily transformed into one another .
Many other bases deport themselves with nitrate of diazobenzol exactly like aniline , and we may therefore look forward to the discovery of a large number of double compounds analogous to diazo-amidobenzol .
It is not my intention to give a full history of these compounds , as a few short statements will show clearly how closely they are allied to their prototype diazo-amidobenzol .
Diazobenzol-amnidobronmobenzol , C6 42 } HC6H Br N This compound is obtained by the action of bromaniline upon nitrate of diazobenzol .
It crystallizes in very fine small yellow plates or needles , which are rather difficultly soluble in alcohol , but readily soluble in ether .
Its platinum-salt , C1 Ho BrN3 , H C2 , 2Pt Cl2 , is obtained as a buff-coloured precipitate consisting of fine hair-like crystals .
Nitrate of silver produces , in an alcoholic solution , a yellow precipitate similar to that of the compound previously described .
In the formation of the above bodies two atoms of base enter into chemical action with one atom of nitrate of diazobenzol , forming , together with the diazo-amido-compound , the nitrate of the base employed .
Naphtalidine ( amidonaphtol ) , however , combines directly in equal numbers of atoms with nitrate of diazobenzol , giving rise to a compound which has the formula 'C16 1 N4 03 , and which , as will be shown , must be viewed as nitrate of diazobenzol-amidonaphtol .
This compound is obtained in an impure state as a violet crystalline precipitate on adding an aqueous solution of nitrate of diazobenzol to an alcoholic solution of naphtalidine .
It is purified by repeated washings with cold alcohol and recrystallization from the same , forming beautiful green prisms .

The crystals are almost insoluble in water and ether .
Hot alcohol dissolves them freely , and redeposits them almost entirely on cooling .
Diazobenzol-amidonca12ptoi , C6 H4 N2 } This compound is obtained from the previous substance by removing the nitric acid by means of ammonia or potassa .
It crystallizes in very brilliant ruby-red prisms , readily soluble in alcohol and ether , forming yellow liquids .
Acids impart a beautifil violet colour to these solutions .
Bichloride of platinum produces a purple-blue crystalline precipitate ; nitrate of silver a yellow precipitate , which consists of small fine needles .
It is worth mentioning that these diazobenzol-amido-compounds can also be obtained by acting with an aqueous solution of the salts of the respective bases upon the compound of hydrate of potassium with diazobenzol .

COMPOUNDS OF DIAZOBENZOL WITH AMIDO-ACIDS .
Amido-acids are likewise capable of entering into combination with diazobenzol .
One would have expected that the compounds to which this reaction gives rise would deleport themselves in aln analogous manner to the sulphate or nitrate of diazobenzol , which , like the salts of organic bases , are capable of double decomposition .
This , however , is not the case .
The compounds of diazobenzol with amido-acids behave more like simple bodies , exhibiting much similarity to the diazo-amidobenzol , being capable , like the latter , of forming , with bichloride of platinumn , double compounds of the nature of the potassio-bichloride of platinum .
They possess , moreover , the property of combining with metals , giving rise to bodies which correspond entirely to the salts of simple acids .
Diazobenzol-arnidobenzoic acid , { C6 4 N2O This compound is obtained by simply mixing an aqueous solution of the nitrate of diazobenzol ( 1 molecule ) with a solution of amidobenzoic acid ( 2 molecules ) .
It separates as a yellow crystalline precipitate which is readily freed from the mother-liquor , and when dry dissolved in ether and filtered .
The ethereal solution deposits on evaporation yellow crystals , which are obtained pure for analysis by washing with cold alcohol .

Cold dilute mineral acids act upon it but slowly ; on heating , however , speedy decomposition ensues .

All the salts formed are comparatively stable ; those , e. g. , which are soluble in water , as the potassium-salt , will even bear recrystallization .
With the oxide of silver and barium it forms insolubleprecipitates .
A more minute description of these compouinds I must defer to a future time .
Compounds analogous to the diazobenzol-amidobenzoic acid are formed when amidodracylic acid ( isoamidobenzoic acid ) , amidoanisic acid , &amp;c. are made to react in the manner previously described upon nitrate of diazobenzol .
It is my intention to investigate these compounlds more specially , and I therefore abstain from entering further upon their description , only noticing that they possess a remarkable resemblance to diazobenzol-amidobenzoic acid .
IMIDOGEN COMIPOUNDS OF DIAZOBENZOL .
By this name are designated a peculiar class of diazobenzol-compounds obtained by the action of ammonia , ethylamine , and analogous organic bases upon perbromide of diazobenzol ( C4 H4 N2 , HBr , Br2 ) .
All the compounds hitherto described exist in a solid state , and none of them can be volatilized without decomposition ; the new compounds to be described , on the other hand , are liquors which can be distilled , and which possess the narcotic odour of some vegetable bases , such as conidine and nicotine .
Beyond this odour , however , they have nothing in common with these natural bases .
They are indifferent bodies , combining with neither acids nor bases .
681 Diazoenzolinmide , -C6 H5 N6 14 'H }N .
On treating perbromide of diazobenzol with aqueous ammonia , a speedy decomposition ensues with evolution of much heat .
The products of the reaction are , first , bromide of ammonium , this passes into solution ; secondly , diazobenzolimide , which separates as a heavy oil , rather highly coloured by a brown substance simultaneously produced in small quantity .
By repeatedly distilling the oil with water it is obtained perfectly pure , and of a slightly yellowish colour ; the substance which imparts to it the intense brownish colour , not being volatile , is left behind in the retort .
The purified oil is separated from the water by means of a separating funnel , placed over chloride of calcium , and then distilled once more from a water-bath in z vaeo .

Diazobenzolimide .
Diazobenzolimide is remarkable for its narcotic , aromatic-ammoniacal odour .
It is volatilized by distillation with water , and also when heated i3n vacuo , as shovwn above .
Distilled at the ordinary atmospheric pressure , it is decomposed with explosive violence .
Alcohol and ether dissolve it rather difficultly .
I could not succeed in solidifying the oil by using a frigorific mixture of nitre and sal-ammoniac .
Hydrochloric acid , even when concentrated , and aqueous potassa have no effect upon it .
Strong nitric and sulphuric acids dissolve it with decomposition .
Ethyldiazo benzolimide= ( C6 4 2 ) N. This body is obtained in a manner exactly similar to the one employed for the preparation of diazobenzolimide , viz. by acting with ethylamine upon the perbromnide of diazobenzol .
It is likewise a yellowish-coloured oil , having a deceptive resemblance to the previously described compound .
b This decomposition of the perbromide explains the method of analysis adopted for the estimation of the bromine described in page 673 .
682 The transformations which the molecule of diazobenzol undergoes through the influence of various reagents are numerous , and there is probably no other body to be met with in the large field of organic chemistry that surpasses it in this respect .
The products of decomposition to which it gives rise frequently possess new and very distinctive features ; more frequently , however , they belong to the benzol or phenyl group , in which latter case their formation depends upon the great inclination which the two nitrogen atoms of the diazobenzol exhibit to escape and to cede their place to other atomic groups of the same value ( HH ) .
Deportment of Diazobenzol Compounds when boiled in an aqueous solution .
The transformation of nitrate of diazobenzol , under the influence of boiling water , has already been noticed .
A similar change is observed with regard to its sulphate and hydrobromate , as will be seen from the following equations : C6 H4 N2 , $H2 04+H2 0=C6 H60 +-H2 04+N2 Sulphate Phenylic of diazobenzol .

On the other hand , the compounds of diazobenzol with metallic hydrates exhibit a very different deportment with boiling water .
By neutralizing the metal , however , with a mineral acid , the decomposition takes place in accordance with the above equations .
Action of Alcohol upon Nitrate of Diazobenzol .
By gradually and cautiously introducing the nitrate of diazobenzol into a moderate quantity of alcohol ( previously warmed to about 50 ?
C. in order to accelerate the solution ) , and submitting the whole to distillation in a water-bath , a yellow residue remains , which solidifies to a crystalline mass on cooling , and dissolves readily in alkaline solutions , whence it was inferred that it had the character of an acid .
There was , in fact , no difficulty in ascertaining that this body was nothing else than dinitrophenylic acid , possessing all the well-pronounced properties of this compound ; and to prove this most conclusively , it was converted into the characteristic amidonitrophenylic acid .
Dinitrophenylic acid , however , is not the only product to which this reaction gives rise ; for on mixing the distillate with water an oily body separates , which collects upon the fluid , especially when its specific gravity has been increased by the addition of a solution of chloride of sodium .
This oil may be removed by means of a separating funnel and dried over chloride of calcium .
It possesses , when rectified by distillation , all the properties of ordinary benzol .
I have converted it into dinitrobenzol by the action of fuming nitric acid , and have found this latter identical with that prepared from coal-tar benzol .
The fusing-point of the dinitrobenzol was in both instances 89 ?
C. The production of dinitrocarbolic acid and of benzol can be expressed by the following equation : 2(-6 H4 , N , NH03)+2 H -0= ?

Ordinary nitric acid , as well as the fuming acid , has no action upon this compound in the cold .
The diazo-compound was dissolved in the strongest fuming nitric acid , allowed to stand for one hour , and cautiously diluted with water so as to prevent any rise of temperature ; solution of terchloride of gold was then added , which gave an immediate precipitate .

44-37 44-42 On boiling the solution of nitrate of diazobenzol in fuming nitric acid , trinitrophenylic acid is produced .

Action of Sulphuric Acid upon Sulphate of Diazobenzol .
On dissolving the sulphate in a small quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid , and heating in a water-bath , a copious evolution of nitrogen gas ensues , and a brownishcoloured liquid remains , consisting of a mixture of the excess of acid employed and a.new sulpho-acid .
The separation of the two acids is readily accomplished by preparing their barium-salts .
After diluting the brownish liquid with a sufficient quantity of water and adding carbonate of barium as long as the solution exhibits an acid reaction , the insoluble sulphate of baryta may be separated by filtration from the barium-salt of the new sulpho-acid .
The filtrate is evaporated till a pellicle forms , when , on cooling , a large quantity of crystals of the barium-salt of the new sulpho-acid appears .
After separating the crystals by filtration , and then evaporating the mother-liquor further and cooling , a new quantity of crystals is obtained .
A single recrystallization from water renders them perfectly pure .
This salt forms fine , white , well-developed prisms , attaining frequently to the length of half an inch , when the solution is allowed to cool very slowly .
The crystals are readily soluble in hot , rather difficultly in cold water , and 684 almost insoluble in alcohol and ether .
The solutions have a neutral reaction .

13-44 13-89 13-52 In accordance with the analysis of the barium-salt , the free acid must be expressed by the formula C6 H8 S2 O , and I propose to call it disulphophenylenic acid , since it may be viewed as a compound of two molecules of sulphuric acid , with the hypothetical hydrocarbon ( 6 H4 ( phenylene ) , viz..6 H4 S2 H4 QO .
Its formation may be thus expressed : C6 H4 N2SH 204+SH2O4=C6 H4 S2H408+N2 Sulphate of diazobenzol .
Disulphophenylenic acid .
The free acid is easily prepared by dissolving the barium-salt in water , carefully precipitating the barium with sulphuric acid , and concentrating the filtrate on a water-bath till it acquires a syrupy consistency ; when it is placed over sulphuric acid , it crystallizes out in the form of warty crystals , which are exceedingly soluble in water and alcohol , and deliquesce in a moist atmosphere .
Besides the compound just described , there exists yet another barium-compound of disulphophenylenic acid of the composition.6 H4 S2 Ba3 H 8 , formed by the exchange of a third equivalent of the hydrogen for barium .
It is obtained by digesting either the barium-compound with two atoms of barium , or the free disulphophenylenic acid with baryta-water for some time .
The excess of baryta is neutralized by carbonic acid , and the filtrate evaporated till it begins to crystallize .
The new salt forms very thin white plates , which , on being left for some time in contact with the mother-liquor , are likewise converted into well-formed prisms .
This salt differs , moreover , from the salt containing only two equivalents of barium , by its greater solubility in water* , and the strong alkalinity of its solutions , which is not destroyed by the carbonic acid .
' When freshly prepared , the crystals of this compound are clear and transparent ; they soon , however , lose a portion of their water of crystallization , and are reduced to a white powder .

Disulphophenylenic acid is likewise capable of combining in two proportions with other metals ; with lead it seems to combine even more freely , forming apparently no less than five distinct salts , viz. -C6 11 H H3Pb 08 , C6i1H42H2Pb208 , C6 H4 S2 H Pb3 0,8 Q6 H4 S2 Pb4 Q0 , and C6 H4 S2 Pb4 08 + Pb2 0 .
The description of the preparation and properties of these bodies will be reserved for a future communication .
The silver-salt of disulphophenylenic acid , however , may find a place here , since it exhibits the peculiar chemical deportment of the new acid in a striking manner .
Disulphiophenylenate oqf Silver.-.This salt is obtained by treating an aqueous solution of the free acid with carbonate of silver , evaporating the filtrate first on the water-bath , and lastly over sulphuric acid .
It crystallizes either in warty masses or in small plates .
It is easily soluble in water , difficultly so in alcohol , and almost insoluble in ether .
It does not contain any water of crystallization .
After drying over sulphuric acid it does not lose weight , even when heated to upwards of 160 ?

Action of Sulphuretted Hydrogen upon the Gold-salt of Hydrochlorate of bDiazobenzol .
By passing a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through cold water in which the gold-salt has been suspended , all the gold is converted into the trisulphide , whilst the diazobenzol is transformed into a volatile product .
When the reaction is complete , the liquid is submitted to distillation , when a very nauseous , heavy , yellowish oil is found to pass over with the aqueous vapour .
I have not pursued its examination further than to convince myself that it is not the phenylmercaptan ( 06H6S ) described by VOGT , which at first sight it appeared to be .
Its mercaptanic odour and its derivation from the diazobenzol in the gold-compound ( according to the equation C6 H4 N2+SH2= 6116 S+N2 ) rendered this view very probable .
Neither basic acetate of lead , however , nor nitrate of silver , even in the presence of ammonia , gave precipitates with the oil , which proved convincingly that it differed entirely from phenylmercaptan .
On examining the residue in the retort after the oil had been distilled off , it was found to consist of tersulphide of gold and an aqueous liquid ; the latter is found to contain chloride of ammonium , together with a little free hydrochloric acid , and a small e LIiPrIclT , Lehrbuch der Cheinie , p. 1016 .
687 quantity of the hydrochlorate of a base which is no other than aniline .
The occurrence of these bodies shows that a small portion of the diazobenzol is decomposed as follows : X6 14 N2+3SH2=6 H7 N+NH3+ 3S .
The same prodLucts of decomposition are met with when an alcoholic solution of the gold-salt is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen .
On passing the latter , however , over the dry gold-compound , it speedily causes an explosion .
By employing only a very small quantity of the substance , and by spreading it in a thin layer in a glass tube , it is possible to avoid explosion and secure a quiet decomposition .
The reaction is over when no more hydrochloric acid fumes escape with the current of sulphuretted hydrogen .
The black residue which is left behind in the glass tube appears to contain , besides tersulphide of gold , free diazobenzol .
I was not able to isolate this latter .
The explosive nature of the residue and its deportment with ether , which speedily produces a rapid evolution of gas , leave , however , little doubt of its presence .
Hydrochloric acid , tersulphide of gold , and diazobenzol are therefore the products of decomposition of the gold-salt by means of sulphuretted hydrogen .
Action of Nascent Hydrogen upon biazobezolimide .
If hydrogen is generated by means of zinc and sulphuric acid in an alcoholic solution of this body , a point is reached in a comparatively short time when , on the addition of water , no more turbidity occurs , indicating that the diazobenzolimide has completely dlisappeared .
By removing the excess of zinc and evaporating the alcohol on a water-bath , the residue , when treated with potassa , evolves much ammonia , and an oily base simultaneously separates ; this is purified by distillation , and is found identical with ordinary aniline .
The decomposition may be thus expressed:6 H5N3+8H=CG6H N+2NH3 .
Diazobenzolimide .

Action of Carbonate of Barium upon Nitrate of Diazolenzol .
By treating a cold aqueous solution of this salt with levigated carbonate of barium , a feeble evolution of gas is observed , which lasts for several days .
A reddish-brown mass is produced insoluble in water , which remains with the excess of carbonate of barium when the reaction is over .
The residue is a mixture of two distinct bodies .
By filtering off the solution containing nitrate of barium and removing the excess of carbonate by means of dilute hydrochloric acid , these two products can be readily separated by treatment with cold alcohol , in which they are very unequally soluble .
In order to obtain the more soluble one in a pure state , the alcohol is evaporated and the residue treated with ammonia .
An intensely yellow-coloured solution is produced , which must be filtered to remove a small quantity of a resinous substance , and decomposed with hydrochloric acid , when the new compound is precipitated in crystals .
These are obtained perfectly pure for analysis by repeated crystallization from weak alcohol .

New compound .
It may likewise be viewed as composed of phenol and diazobenzol , viz. 2C6 H4 N2+C6 H6 O=Cls H14 N4 0 , and I would therefore propose the name phenol-bidiazobenzol .
This new compound crystallizes in brownish-red needles or plates ; it is readily soluble in ether , difficultly soluble in cold alcohol .
Hot water dissolves it but very slightly .
On heating , it deports itself like the compound previously described .
It fuses at 113 ?
C. Phenol-bidiazobenzol is an almost perfectly neutral body .
Its deportment with potassa ( in which it dissolves readily , forming a ruby-red solution ) reminds one , however , of the properties of an acid .
Ammonia-water dissolves it with difficulty , and aqueous carbonate of potassa not at all .
Dilute acids exert likewise no solvent action ; concentrated acids , however , dissolve it with a blood-red colour .
Decomposition ensues when the latter solutions are heated .
Action of Potassa ztpon Nitrate of lDiazobenzol .
On mixing diluted aqueous solutions of these two bodies* , a yellow liquid is obtained , which possesses a peculiar aromatic odour and soon begins to evolve nitrogen gas , a reddish-brown neutral substance being simultaneously formed .
At the common temperature this reaction is very slow , and requires several weeks to be completed .
If , however , heat is employed , the decomposition proceeds rapidly , and the reddish-brown substance is separated as a resinous , semifluid mass , quite insoluble in water , and only very slightly soluble even in boiling alcohol .
Ether dissolves it readily .
I have not been able to obtain this substance in crystals .
By allowing its ethereal solution to evaporate spontaneously it is left behind in a resinous state .
As a powder it is very electric .
Boiling with nitric acid produces a new yellowish crystalline body .
In order to purify the amorphous product of decomposition , I have first washed it thoroughly with water , then boiled with alcohol , and finally dissolved it in ether ; the substance remaining after the evaporation of the ether was submitted to analysis .

If instead of an aqueous , an alcoholic solution of potassa be added to the nitrate of diazobenzol , dissolved in water , the reaction which takes place is much more complicated .
In this case , in addition to the reddish-brown body , two volatile substances are formed , viz. benzol and phenyl , 12 H1o , the hydrocarbon recently discovered by FITTIG+ .
When the reaction is conducted in a retort , on the application of heat the benzol passes over with the alcohol , and may be separated from it by the addition of water .
The The compound of hydrate of potassium and diazobenzol ( page 675 ) does not seem to be formed in this case , as I was only able to separate this substance when very concentrated solutions of the nitrate of diazobenzol and potassa had been employed in its preparation .

phenyl being less volatile , is obtained after the whole of the alcohol has distilled over ; it condenses into a crystalline mass in , the receiver .

C. These properties leave no doubt as to its identity with the phenyl of Dr. FITTIG , to whom I am indebted for a small portion of his substance , which resembles in every respect the body obtained as mentioned above .
The third product of the decomposition in question , viz. the amorphous brown substance , is left behind in the retort as a resinous mass .
From the foregoing observations it will be seen that potassa , in the presence of alcohol , causes simultaneously three different decomnpositions of the diazobenzol-molecule , which may be expressed as follows : I. C6 H4N2 + 021H60 =6 He6 + C2H40O+N2 .

Action of Anmmonia upon aqueous Nitrate of Diazobenzol .
On adding diluted ammonia to an aqueous solution of this diazo-compound , a similar reaction takes place as when the potassa is employed .
On treating the brown mass , however , with alcohol , it becomes evident that it consists of two bodies .
The difficultly soluble portion is absolutely identical with the nitrogenious body previously described , as was proved by the following analysis : 0245 grm. gave 0-744 grm. of carbonic acid and 0-1237 grm. of water .

This compound is , in fact , no other than the diazo-amidobenzol previously mentioned .
The coincidence with this latter was so complete , that it appeared to me loss of time to analyze it .
With regard to the first of the two products of decomposition , it is clear that its formation must be expressed by the same equation which illustrated the reaction with caustic potassa upon nitrate of diazobenzol , whilst the formation of the latter ( the diazo-amidobenzol ) is explained by assuming that a portion 692 of the original compound is decomposed , in the following manner:2(C6 H4N2 , NH03)+3NH3= C12 H N3+N2 + 2(NH4 , NO3 ) .

Diazo-amidobenzol .
Two atoms of nitrogen in two equivalents of diazobenzol have , therefore , been simply replaced by one of ammonia .
Decomposition of the Platinum-salt of Diazobenzol , and of the Perbromide of Diazobenzol , by the action of heat .
When speaking of the platinum-salt , I had occasion to mention that it detonates when heated .
By mixing it , however , with a large excess of perfectly dry carbonate of sodium * , and heating the whole in a retort on a sand-bath , it is quietly decomposed .
The decomposition begins at a moderate heat , and is marked at first by the evolution of gas , and subsequently by the distillation of an oily body .
The residue in the retort consists of carbonate of sodium , metallic platinum , and chloride of sodium .
The oily distillate contains chlorine .
It is obtained perfectly pure by distilling once with chloride of calcium , and forms an almost colourless oil , which is heavier than water and has the odour of benzol .
These properties , as well as the chlorine determination , which was made by igniting the substance with caustic lime , prove that it is chloro-benzol 6 H5 Clt .

The platinum-salt of the bromide of diabenzol$ is decomposed in an exactly similar manner .
The resulting bromobenzol differs in no way from the bromobenzol obtained by COUPER by the action of bromine upon benzol , as may easily be shown by converting it into nitrobromobenzol , which possesses all the properties of nitrobromobenzol prepared from coal-tar oil .
Bromobenzol can also be produced by the decomposition of perbromide of diazobenzol by heat , according to the equation 6 114 N2 , HBr , Br2 G6 H5 Br+N2+Br2 .
Perbromide of diazobenzol .
Bromobenzol .
In order to decompose larger quantities of the perbromide of diazobenzol in this manner , it is likewise requisite to mix it first with a sufficient quantity of carbonate of sodium , to avoid a violent explosion .
By heating the mixture in a retort bromobenzol is obtained almost perfectly pure .
The perbromide , when heated with alcohol , likewise gives rise to a decomposition in accordance with the previous equations .
Bromobenzol separates as a heavy oil on the addition of water to the alcoholic solution .
It deserves to be mentioned that all these reactions are very well defined , and that the amount of the products of decomposition corresponds almost theoretically with the quantities employed .
APPENDIX .
It may be of some interest to mention an experiment I made to obtain ethylated diazobenzol compounds .
For this purpose I submitted nitrate of ethylaniline to the same reaction which produced from nitrate of aniline the nitrate of diazobenzol .
I obtained a body crystallizing , like the latter , in long needles .
If this body had really been nitrate of ethyldiazobenzol , I expected to obtain , by boiling wilth water , a reaction according to the equation 6 H3 ( C21 H15 ) N2 , NH03+H2 0=H6 H5 ( 0H ) +NHO +N9 .
Nitrate of ethyldiazobenzol .
Ethylphenylic acid .
It soon became evident , however , that the oily body produced was nothing else than ordinary phenylic acid ; and since no other organic product of decomposition could be traced , I had to come to the conclusion that the above-mentioned crystals were nothing else than ordinary nitrate of diazobenzol .
In order to decide this question the gold-salt was prepared , and , after being purified by recrystallization from alcohol , the well-known golden , brilliant crystals were obtained , which gave , on analysis0759 grm. , decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen and ignition of the tersulphide of gold , left 0-337 grin .

694 The peculiar and somewhat remarkable properties of the compounds derived from aniline in the manlner previously described , have induced me to try whether bromaniline , nitraniline , &amp;c. , when similarly treated , would be converted into the corresponding substituted diazobenzols .
This I have succeeded in doing , and the new substances thus obtained exhibited all the properties which I found so characteristic of the normal diazobenzol-compounds .
They are , if anything , more stable , owing , if I may so express myself , to the comparatively larger amount of more solid and stable materials which are more firmly combined with the extremely volatile and easily disturbed nitrogen .
This property renders them more fit for many experiments in which the non-substituted diazobenzol-compounds are liable to give rise to dangerous accidents .
They are likewise remarkable for great beauty , a property which certainly encourages a closer acquaintance .
ANitrcate of Diazobromnobenzol , C6 IH Br N2 , NH03 .
This compound may be prepared either by the action of nitrous acid gas upon nitrate of bromaniline or upon diazo-amidobromobenzol , and in an exactly similar manner to the nitrate of diazobenzol .
If an aqueous solution of nitrate of bromaniline be employed , nitrous acid gas must be passed through very rapidly at first , or else diazo-amidobromobenzol ( even in the presence of much free nitric acid ) begins to separate .
This it is very difficult to convert into the desired compound in an aqueous solution .
Nitrate of diazobromobenzol remaining comparatively constant in aqueous solutions , it is possible to concentrate them , without any great loss , by spontaneous evaporation in the open air .
In this manner solutions which are too dilute may be concentrated before precipitating by means of alcohol and ether .
It can be obtained perfectly pure by repeatedly dissolving in alcohol and precipitating with 'ether , when it is obtained in the form of purely white scales which , when crystallizing out rapidly , present themselves in the form of regular rhombic plates .
These crystals , like those of nitrate of diazobenzol , are exceedingly soluble in water , difficultly so in strong alcohol , and almost insoluble in ether .
They explode when they are heated , struck , or compressed , though not so readily nor with the same violence as the nitrate of diazobenzol , and they can therefore be mixed without danger with oxide of copper and burnt in the usual mode of organic analysis .

The preparation of this compound from nitrate of diazobromobenzol and sulphuric acid corresponds so closely with that of the non-substituted ( abromous ) sulphate , that it may suffice simply to refer to the description already given of the preparation of the latter , and I will therefore restrict myself to a few remarks on its properties .
Sulphate of diazobromobenzol crystallizes in very fine colourless prisms , which are very soluble in water , very difficultly soluble in alcohol , and almost insoluble in ether .
The new body is comparatively stable , and can be crystallized from water without suffering the least decomposition , by allowing its solution to evaporate over sulphuric acid .
Boiling water decomposes the compound , and heat causes it to explode .

In the dry state it can be preserved a long time without undergoing decomposition .
On heating , it explodes 696 almost as violently as the corresponding nitrate .

By treating an aqueous solution-* of any one of the previously-described diazobromobenzol-compounds with excess of bromine-water , a crystalline orange precipitate speedily falls , increasing rapidly till all the diazobromobenzol has been precipitated .
If too , much bromine has been added the precipitate becomes generally of an oily consistency , , solidifying , however , to a yellow crystalline mass as soon as the mother-liquor has been removed and the excess of bromine allowed to evaporate spontaneously .
In order to obtain the perbromide , thus prepared , in fine crystals , it is dissolved in the smallest possible quantity of warm , not boiling , alcohol , from which it separates on cooling in yellow monoclinic prisms .
A small portion only remains in the alcoholic mother-liquor , from which evaporation rarely recovers it , since it usually undergoes decomposition .
It will , however , be seldom necessary to run this risk of losing part of the substance by recrystallization , for the compound is almost perfectly pure from the very first , and at all events quite fit to be employed for the experiments to be described further on .
Under certain circumstances this perbromide is formed during the preparation of hydrobromate of diazobromobenzol from diazo-amidobromobenzol , in which case the two compounds are readily separated from one another by washing with cold water .
Perbromide of diazobromobenzol crystallizes , as has been already remarked , in orange monoclinic prisms , insoluble in water , freely soluble in warm , difficultly so in cold alcohol , and very difficultly soluble in cold ether .

In either case it is necessary to remove it speedily from the mother-liquor , and to dry it rapidly over sulphuric acid .
Diazobromobenzol is an exceedingly dangerous compound ; for the slightest pressure , or even touch with a rough object , causes it to go off in a fiery explosion almost exceeding in violence that of the nitrate of diazobenzol .
Although much more stable than diazobenzol , it can , however , be kept only for a short time in a perfectly unchanged condition .
After being kept for some time , a reddish-brown residue is left , which no longer explodes even on heating , and it seems that the nitrogen has been gradually eliminated .
Ether dissolves diazobromobenzol and causes a violent evolution of gas , frequently of such intensity as to give rise to explosions .

It needs no further proof that both methods furnish a product of identical properties .
The action of aniline upon nitrate of diazobromobeizol gives rise to diazobromo-amidobenzol , which not only has the same empirical composition as the diazobenzol-amidobromobenzol(C12 H1OBr N3 ) ( page 678 ) , but resembles it in every other respect .

Ebullition of nitrate of diazobromobenzol with alcohol gives rise to the formation of bromobenzol , which distils over with the vapour of alcohol , a yellow acid ( probably bromodinitrophenylic ) being left behind .
Ammonia forms a yellow body with the simultaneous production of diazo-amidobromobenzol , which , owing to its greater solubility in alcohol , can be readily separated from the former .

When the addition of water no longer gives rise to a precipitate , indicating that the whole of the imide has been decomposed , the bromaniline is most easily isolated by evaporating the alcoholic solution on a water-bath , and distilling with caustic potassa .

Perbromide of diazoDibromobenzol .
bromobenzol .
A still more convenient method of preparing dibromobenzol consists in the decomposition of the perbromide with alcohol , which is completed after a few minutes ' boiling ; and if too much alcohol has not been employed , a large portion of the dibromobenzol separates at once in the form of crystals .
The remaining portion is precipitated on the addition of water , in the form of a thick oil , which soon solidifies to a crystalline mass .
After washing with a little alcohol and pressing between bibulous paper , this mass , together with the crystals first precipitated , is subjected to distillation .
Dibromobenzol distils over as an almost colourless oil , which speedily solidifies .
Dibromobenzol resembles very much chlorobromobenzol in its various physical properties .
It crystallizes from ether in the form of rectangular prisms or small plates , which are frequently very regular and well formed , sometimes , however , agglomerated in various ways .
It fuses at 89 ?
C. The properties of the dibromobenzol prepared in the manner just described can leave no doubt that it is identical with the dibromobenzol described by COUPER , obtained by the action of bromine upon benzol .
Although large quantities of dibromobenzol can be prepared by COUPER'S method with perhaps greater facility , it is always difficult to obtain the dibromoquite free from tribromo-benzol , which is simultaneously formed .
The above methodcl might be preferred in all cases when absoluttely pure dibromobenzol is required , as , for instance , for certain physical purposes the more so , since it invariably yields theoretical quantities .
The same may be said of several other derivatives of benzol and its homologues , which are obtained from diazo-compounds to be described hereafter .

Perbromide of Diazodibromnobenzol , C6 H2 Br2 N2 , HBr3 .
This compound is formed by the addition of brominle-water to an aqueous solution of the nitrate of diazodibromobenzol , when it is precipitated in the form of fine long needles .
On boiling with alcohol , and the subsequent additionl of water , an oily substance is thrown down which soon solidifies , and can be obtained perfectly pure by pressing the precipitate between bibulous paper , then distilling , and finally crystallizing from alcohol .
Thus purified it presents itself in the form of fine long silky needles .

It will suffice if I give likewise only a short outline of these bodies , owing to the great resemblance which usually exists between them and the compounds of diazobromnobenzol , both in regard to their preparation and chemical deportment , and also with respect to their physical properties .

Diazoiodobenzol , C6 H3 IN2 , is obtained as a yellow explosive precipitate .
DIAZONITROBENZOL COMPOUNDS .
The remarkable isomerism observed between a and / 3 nitraniline , and hitherto left unexplained by any chemical theory , likewise extends , as I have shown upon a former occasion , to the double compounds which I have described as a and 3 Diazo-amidonitrobenzol .
This isomerism , however , is somewhat less striking , since these bodies retain one-half the nitraniline required for their formation in the original condition , as will be clearly seen on examining the rational formula { C6 13 ( NOQ ) N2 C6 H4 ( NO2 ) H2 N which I assign to these bodies .
The simple diazo-compounds derived from these isomeric nitranilines cannot , however , be viewed similarly , and it was impossible therefore to decide ca priori the question of their isomerism .
The experiments presently to be described nevertheless leave no doubt that a similar isomerism exits between the several members of both series , and that , although of identical composition , differences in their physical properties become manifest , which are as striking as those observed between the original bases .
Diazonitrobenzol compounds* .
Nitrate of JDiazonitrobenzol , C6 H3 ( NO ) N2 HN03 .
The preparation of this compound by the action of nitrous acid upon a nitraniline differs in no way from that of the analogous bodies already referred to .
By gradually adding ether to its alcoholic solution till crystallization commences , it is obtained in fine long needles , which , however , do not exhibit any distinct form of crystallization .
This compound , like all the rest of the like bodies , is very readily soluble in water , more difficultly so in alcohol , and insoluble in ether , and explodes with the same violence on heating .
Perbromide of a Diazonitrobenzol , C6 H3 ( NO2 ) N2 , HBr3 , On mixing an aqueous solution of the former compound with bromine-water , this new body is speedily thrown down in slender orange prisms , which are almost insoluble in water , and scarcely soluble in ether .
They dissolve , however , readily in warm alcohol , from which they are deposited , on cooling , in well-defined crystals .
Platinum-salt of the Hydrochlorate of a -Diazonitrobenzol , C6 113 ( N02 ) N2 , HCl , Pt C12 .
On the addition of chloride of platinum to a hot aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate of diazonitrobenzol , this double salt , which crystallizes in long yellow needles , is precipitated .
On recrystallizing it from boiling water , in which it is soluble ( although difficultly ) , the crystals are obtained as prisms , frequently very well formed .
a Diazonitrobenzolimide , ( C6 3( NO2 ) N.}N H This compound is prepared by the action of ammonia upon perbromide of a diazonitrobenzol .
By repeated recrystallization from alcohol it may be obtained in a perfectly pure state in the form of very brilliant yellow , rounded plates , which are so soluble in hot alcohol that a magma of crystals separates on cooling from a saturated solution .
The crystals dissolve as readily in ether .
In boiling water they fuse , producing a yellow oil but slightly soluble in water , the portion dissolved yields very fine , almost white crystals on cooling .

Nitrate of ( 3 Diazonitrobenzol , C6 H3 ( NO2 ) N2 , HN03 , is obtained from the nitrate of p nitraniline .
The 3 does not differ much from the corresponding oc compound in solubility ; they however exhibit perceptible differences in the forms of their crystals , which in the I3 compound are columns , frequently approaching the cubical form , whilst the crystals of the nitrate of a diazonitrobenzol are long needles of a somewhat unpronounced character .
Perbromide of P.Diazonitrobenzol , C 13 ( NO2 ) N2 , HBr3 .
On treating an aqueous solution of the nitrate of 3 diazonitrobenzol with brominewater the new compound is thrown down generally as an oil , which soon solidifies .
It forms small plates or prisms of an orange colour , which seem to differ from the crystals of the os compound by their want of stability when treated with warm alcohol , and which I have scarcely ever been able to recrystallize .
I have obtained the perbromide of ( 3 diazonitrobenzol also by the action of bromine upon 3 diazo-amidonitrobenzol by suspending the latter in water and adding bromine till the whole is converted into a heavy brownish-red oil .
The supernatant aqueous mother-liquor is decanted and the excess of bromine allowed to evaporate spontaneously , when the oil solidifies to a crystalline mass .
Before , however , complete solidification occurs , thick yellowish-red prisms are frequently seen to shoot out , of about an inch in length , which consist of almost pure perbromide containing mere traces of tribromnitraniline , a body which forms in the reaction to nearly the same extent , as will be seen from the following equation C12 H9 ( N02)2 N3+ 8Br=61 H3 ( NO2 ) N2 , HBr3 + C6 3 ( N02 ) Br3 N+2HBr .

Tribromnitraniline .
The adhering tribromnitraniline* can be removed by washing the finely pulverised crystals with ether , in which the perbromide is almost insoluble .
If no crystals are formed after the bromine has evaporated in the manner described , but only a crystalline mass of perbromide and tribromaniline , the latter is pressed between bibulous paper , and then washed with ether in order to separate the two compounds .
This , however , cannot be done without incurring a considerable loss of perbromide , since by the action of the ether it is partly converted into the nitrobromobenzol .

The nature of their products of decomposition may in fact be safely predicted beforehand , as the same isomerism which characterizes the compounds already described is observable .
It appeared of sufficient interest to trace them somewhat more fully .
I could not have given the comparative history of the products of decomposition , however , without deviating too far from the main direction of this investigation , and I must therefore reserve for a future opportunity a more intimate acquaintance with these interesting bodies .
A few illustrations will show how promising a harvest of interesting results may be expected from such an investigation .
One peculiar fact deserves mention here .
I had taken it for granted that the same relations would be exhibited between the isomeric diazonitrobenzol compounds and the isomeric acids of the formula C6 H5 ( NO2 ) 0 ( the nitrocarbolic acid of HOFMANN and the isonitrocarbolic acid of FRITSCHE ) as that observed between the compounds of diazobenzol and carbolic acid , and that their deportment would be represented by the formula C6 H3 ( NO2 ) N2 , NHO3 + H2 0=46 Hs5 ( NO2)0 + NH3 + N2 .

acid .
The assumption has not been verified .
On boiling these diazonitrobenzol compounds with water , they are certainly decomposed , after some time , with evolution of nitrogen gas , but neither the a nor 3 compound furnishes under these circumstances either of the well-known phenylic substitutes .
In both cases a brownish and easily fusible substance is obtained , which readily dissolves in alcohol and ether , but which can in no manner be made to crystallize .
I have not ascertained whether this substance deports itself differently according to its origin ( from the a or ( 3 compound ) , nor have I analyzed it , but I presume that , judging from the progress of its formation , and also from the weak acid properties it exhibits ( dissolving in potassa and being reprecipitated by hydrochloric acid ) , its composition is probably represented by the formula,06H5(NQ2)0 .
On heating an alcoholic solution of the perbromide of a diazonitrobenzol , it is readily decomposed according to the equation C6 H3 ( NO2 ) N2 , HBr3=C6 H4 ( NO2)Br + N2+Br2 a perbromide .
Bromonitrobenzol .
A portion of the bromonitrobenzol formed in this manner separates in crystals on cooling , provided the amount of alcohol employed has not been too large ; the rest is precipitated on the addition of water .
The crystals are purified by pressure between filter paper and distillation , when they pass over as a slightly yellowish oil , which soon solidifies to a crystalline mass .
The bromonitrobenzol thus prepared is , difficultly soluble 711 in cold , readily in hot alcohol and ether .

COUPER'S description of this body appeared to me scarcely conclusive of its nature ; and in order to decide this question I have treated bromobenzol , prepared from coal-tar naphtha , with fuming nitric acid , and have compared the perfectly pure product , after repeated recrystallizations from alcohol , with the bromonitrobenzols prepared by my method .
The striking coincidence between the crystalline form of COUPER'S compound and of the bromonitrobenzol corresponding to the a nitraniline , which I will now call a bromonitrobenzol , became at once perceptible ; and since both compounds crystallize in white needles that could by no means be distinguished from one another , I felt justified in coming to the conclusion that both are identical .
In order , however , to make quite sure I have also determined the fusingpoint of the respective compounds , and have found it uniformly at 1200 C.* They are acted upon in a like manner by various reagents .
When reduced in alcoholic solutions by sulphide of ammonium , they are both converted into bromaniline , which crystallizes in octahedra , and proves itself to be completely identical with that obtained from bromisatine or bromacetanilid by distillation with potash .
Very different from this is the deportment of bromonitrobenzol ( 13 bromonitrobenzol ) prepared from perbromide of / 3 diazonitrobenzol .
On treating this compound with sulphide of ammonium , it is certainly also converted into bromaniline , but this base differs greatly from the abovedescribed bromaniline .
Ordinary bromaniline ( which I would now designate as o bromaniline ) crystallizes , as is well known , in octahedra which fuse at 57 ?
C. The new base , however ( the P3 bromaniline ) , forms an oil which does not solidify even in winter .
The chemical deportment of both compounds is the same ; they form , under like conditions , a series of derivatives which are of the same composition , and differ only in their physical properties .
In order to establish the composition of the 13 bromaniline experimentally , I have analyzed the hydrochlorate and its platinum-salt .
The hydrochlorate of a bromaniline forms white , nacreous , brilliant plates , which are readily soluble in water and alcohol , and which are rapidly coloured red when exposed to the air .

These two bodies differ likewise most characteristically ; M nitrochlorobenzol crystallizes invariably in long , almost white needles which fuse at 83 ?
C. , whilst P nitrochlorobenzol crystallizes from its ethereal solution in thick columns which fuse at 46 ?
C. The former is converted by sulphide of ammonium into the ordinary ( a ) chloraniline , the latter into a new base ( / 3 chloraniline ) , which is distinguished by its remaining an oil at the common temperature .
The platinum-salt presents itself in the form of yellow crystals , which differ likewise considerably in form and solubility from the small slender plates of the platinum-salt of M bromaniline .
713 It may , I think , be safely deduced from these facts that two distinctly different series of compounds are obtained by the substitution of two atoms of hydrogen in benzol by two different elements , or groups of atoms , according as this substitution is accomplished , and that these two series differ most distinctly in their physical properties , although their chemical composition is the same .
The great differences between the fusing-points form one of the most important means of distinction between the members of the two series .
The fusing-points of series a lie considerably higher than those of the 13 series ; sometimes a difference of 70 ?

Now there could be little doubt that the homologues of aniline , and the similarly constituted bases , migh the also converted into diazo-compounds .
This I have confirmed by experiment , the more readily since it was to be foreseen that the decomposition of some of these compounds would give rise to the formation of certain bodies which could not have been obtained by the ordinary methods , e. g. naphtylic alcohol , the existence of which , however , could not be doubted for a moment .
DIAZOTOLUOL COMPOUNDS .
These compounds exhibit considerable analogy with regard to preparation , solubility , and many other properties to the corresponding aniline derivatives .
They seem , however , to be somewhat more constant , and to crystallize more readily .

This substance is best prepared by the action of nitrous acid upon an aqueous solution of nitrate of toluidine , but it can also be obtained from diazo-amidotoluol .

OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRODlUCTS OF DECOMPOSITION OF THE DIAZONAPHIITOL COMPOUNDS .
After being convinced that the products of decomposition of the diazonaphtol compounds so much resembled those of the other diazo-bodies , I could not entertain for a moment the intention of pursuing their study in all directions , especially since known bodies would frequently have formed the subject of such study .
The decomrnposition of the perbromide , for instance , by means of alcohol gives rise to the formationi of bromonaphtaline , that of the platinum-salt when ignited with carbonate of sodium to the formation of chlornaphtaline .
I thought it , however , of sufficient importance to ascertain whether nitrate of diazonaphtol would split up according to the equation 10 H6 N2 , NH03+H20=C10o H80 +N2+NH103 , since the possibility of obtaining the long-sought-for naphtyl-alcohol presented itself .
On boiling the solution of the nitrate of diazonaphtol , an immediate evolution of gas takes place , and a viscid violet-brown mass separates which remains on the filter when the solution is filtered hot .
The filtrate deposits generally small white plates , retaining , however , a portion of the substance dissolved , which can be recovered by shaking the aqueous solution with ether .
On evaporating the ether it remains behind as a violet-coloured oil which quickly solidifies .
This latter , as well as the plates first deposited , is in fact almost pure naphtyl-alcohol , whilst the violet-brown mass on the filter contains , besides naphtylalcohol , a considerable quantity of a reddish-brown body .
In order to purify the naphtyl-alcohol , the united portions are treated with a cold solution of l)otassa , the residuary brown-red body* is filtered off , and the filtrate treated with acetic acid as long as precipitation ensues .
Naphtyl-alcohol separates first as an oil , soon solidifying to a network of small plates , which are still somewhat violet-coloured .
They are thrown on a filter , washed with cold water ( which removes the mother-liquor ) , and then submitted to distillation .
This process must be repeated until the mass of crystals , which is invariably found deposited in the condensing-tube , is quite white , and fuses , on heating , to a limpid oil .
This body gave on analysis the following results : 0 2003 grm. of substance gave 0-6138 grm. of carbonic acid and 0-1047 grm. of water .

C. to a colourless , highly refractive oil which may be volatilized without decomposition .
It is but slightly soluble in water , readily soluble in alcohol , ether , and benzol .
When inflamed it burns with a thick smoky flame .
Its formation and its physical properties prove its relationship with phenylic alcohol ; it possesses , a similar burning taste , and a creosotelike odour somewhat resembling that of naphtaline .
The relation between it and phenylic alcohol is likewise indicated by its chemical deportment .
It stands on the same narrow boundary line between acid and alcohol ; and naphtyl-alcohol may , in like manner with phenol , be classified with alcohols or with acids .
The strong bases form with the new alcohol ( acid ) a series of salts which are as unstable as those of phenylic acid , and are mostly decomposed even by the carbonic acid of the air .
The potassiumor sodium-salt may also be obtained by the action of the respective metals upon the fused naphtylic acid with evolution of hydrogen .
In both cases a crystalline saline mass is obtained which dissolves in water and alcohol .
Basic acetate of lead produces in a solution of naphtyl-alcohol a white voluminous precipitate .
An ammoniacal silver solution is decomposed , metallic silver being deposited .
Nitric acid of sp. gr. 1'4 dissolves naphtylalcohol in the cold with evolution of red fumes .
If the solution be boiled for some time and water added , a difficultly-soluble yellow acid precipitates , whilst a second readilysoluble acid is deposited in yellow crystals on evaporating the mother-liquor .
The latter appears to be the picric acid of the naphtyl group .
By treating the aqueous solution of naphtyl-alcohol with bromine-water , it deposits bromonaphtylic acid in the form of an oil which speedily crystallizes .
Many of the experiments described here and in the previous part of this investigation , have been made in the laboratories of the Royal College of Chemistry , London , and the University of Marburg ; and it gives me great pleasure to express my sincere thanks to Professors HOFMANN and KOLBE for the kind manner in which the laboratories of these institutions have been placed at my disposal 718 All the diazo-compounds which have formed the subject of Parts I. and II .
of this inquiry are derived from monoamido-compounds .
If the composition of the latter be again expressed by the general formula C , H(y2 ) ( NH3 ) " OZ ( see page 667 ) , it is at once perceived that the process of formation of the diazo-compounds is similar to the reaction which takes place by the action of nitrous acid on ammonia : I. H(Y2)(NH3)"Q z+ NHO2 =C H-2 ( N2 ) " +2H2 0* .

By viewing the diamido-compounds in like manner as represented by the general formula Qx H(y.4 ) ( NH3)2 " , Oz , it is evident that the action of nitrous acid may give rise to two decompositions : IQ H(Y4 ) ( NH3 ) O , +NH =x H( NI ( 1NH3 ) " ( N2 ) " +2H2 .
II .
Cx HQV4 ) ( NH3)lV Oz+2NH02= f4 H(Y4 ) ( N4)I+ 4H2 0 .
The hydrogen contained in one atom of ammonia can thus be replaced by nitrogen , or both atoms of ammonia present in the original compound may be replaced by nitrogen , giving rise to a tetrazo-compound .
Although this theory has not been fully confirmed by the action ( presently to be described ) that nitrous acid exerts on benzidine , since an intermediate compound according to equation I. could not be obtained , it is nevertheless highly probable that nitrogenous compounds in accordance with equation I. exist , and that further experiments with other diamido.-compounds will confirm this view .
Action of Nitrous Acid upon Benzidine .
Benzidine , which ZININ , its original discoverer , expressed by the formula 6 H6 N , has been found , on further investigation by P. W. HOFMANN , to have double the atomic weight first assigned to it , and to be a base capable of combining with two molecules of acid .
Very recently FITTIG has shown that it must be viewed as the diamido-compound of his newly discovered hydrocarbon-phenyl , and that it ought to be expressed by the rational formula 12 H8 ( NH2)2 , or 12 H6 ( NH3)"2 .
I entirely abide by FITTIG'S view , but find it necessary to select for both compounds a somewhat modified nomenclature , in order to avoid the use of the same names for some derivatives of these bodies ( which I shall have occasion to describe ) already employed for several long-known derivatives of phenylic acid .
I propose , therefore , to designate FITTIG'S hydrocarbon , C12H11 , as diphenyl , and to call benzidine diamidodiphenyl .
Nitrate of Tetrazodiphenyl , ?
24 H6 N4 , 2NH03 .
This compound is most readily and copiously obtained by passing nitrous acid through a cold concentrated aqueous solution of nitrate of diamidobenzidol , when only traces of a brown amorphous body are formed , whilst from an alcoholic solution the latter is deposited in considerable quantities .
When a sufficient current of gas has been passed through the solution , the brown body is separated by filtration , the filtrate mixed with twice its volume of strong alcohol , and ether added as long as any white crystals are deposited .
By once more dissolving the crystals in a very small quantity of water , and reprecipitating with alcohol and ether , they are obtained perfectly pure : it will be readily perceived that this mode of preparation closely resembles that for the preparation of nitrate of diazobenzol , which body presents a strikling analogy to the nitrate of tetrazodiphenyl .
The latter crystallizes in white or slightly yellowish-tinged needles , which are readily soluble in water , more difficultly so in alcohol , and insoluble in ether .
On heating they explode with the same violence as the analogous diazo-compound .

If alcohol does not completely precipitate it , ether must be added to complete its separation .
It is very soluble in water .
On heating in a dry state an explosion ensues .

It has been my endeavour to study somewhat more closely the compounds which tetrazodiphenyl forms with metallic hydrates , but all my attempts to obtain them more definitely have failed , and their preparation seems indeed to be beset with insurmountable difficulties .
I omit a lengthened description of the unsuccessful attempts , and will merely show by one instance how tetrazodiphenyl can play the part of an acid .
An aqueous solution of nitrate of tetrazodiphenyl , when mixed with caustic potash , yields a yellow liquid exhibiting such properties as might be looked for in aolution of the compound of hydrate of potassa with tetrazodiphenyl .
On treating it with chloride of platinum , it gives rise to the formation of the platinum-compound above described , a proof that the tetrazodiphenyl remains unchanged in the alkaline solution .
It is invariably decomposed on the application of heat , with evolution of gas and separation of a reddishbrown amorphous substance .
PRODUCTS OF DECOMPOSITION OF THE COMIPOUNDS OF TETRAZODIPHENYL .
By applying the laws of classification just now accepted by chemists to the tetrazotized derivatives of benzidine , specially taking into account their manner of formation and combination , these bodies must be classified with the diatomic compounds , whilst the respective diazo-compounds belong to the monatomic bodies .
It has been of late a favourite subject of chemical research to trace the analogies which monatomic bodies exhibit under the influence of certain agents with polyatomic bodies .
In illustration of this I may refer to the results obtained in the comparative study of the products of decomposition of the ethyland ethylene-alcohols in order to show how simple are the laws which regulate these chemical transformations .
The experimental results which I am able to adduce prove likewise that the decomposition of the tetrazo-compound gives rise to derivatives which differ in nothing from those obtained under similar circumstances from diazo-compounds , beyond the distinctive features imparted to them by the polyatomic nature of the compound from which they are derived .
Action of Water upon Nitrate of Tetrazodiphenyl .
An aqueous solution of this body , when left in a cold place , gradually undergoes a spontaneous decomposition .
When heated it gives rise to a copious evolution of nitrogen gas with separation of two substances-one an amorphous brown , and the other a white crystalline body .
An additional quantity of the latter is obtained when the liquid has become quite cold .
It is easy to separate these two bodies by filtering off the acid mother-liquor , pressing the residue between bibulous paper , and repeatedly extracting with dilute alcohol , which takes up the crystalline substance and leaves the brown body undissolved : this latter being very probably identical with the brown compound obtained as a by-product in the formation of nitrate of tetrazobenzidol , and being moreover of a very unpromising nature , I have not pursued its study any further .
The crystalline product of decomposition dissolved by the alcohol is obtained on evaporation as a yellowish crystalline mass , from which the least traces of the brown body are removed by repeatedly dissolving in ether , and lastly recrystallizing from dilute alcohol .
0-3037 grm. of substance gave 0-8603 grm. of carbonic acid and 0154 grm. of water .

Diphenyl-alcohol .
Diphenyl-alcohol ( diphenylic acid ) crystallizes in small white , or slightly tinged plates or needles , which possess slight solubility in water , but are soluble to any extent in alcohol and ether .
It fuses on heating , and can be sublimed in small quantities by heating it cautiously in a test-tube .
It is thus obtained in the form of soft , white , very lustrous plates .
The chemical deportment of diphenyl-alcohol shows it to be most closely allied to the class of compounds the best-known representative of which is phenylic alcohol .
It may in fact be considered as the first biatomic representative of this peculiar group of chemical compounds .
The new alcohol is readily soluble in potash , and can be reprecipitated by the addition of an acid .
Concentrated ammonia also dissolves it .
On heating an ammoniacal solution with basic acetate of lead , a white voluminous precipitate ensues .
Heated with ordinary strong nitric acid it is changed into a nitro-acid , which crystallizes out in yellow roundish crystals ; the ammonium-salt of this acid crystallizes in beautiful long needles .
Action of Alcohol upon Sulphate of Tetrazodipenyl .
On heating an admixture of alcohol and sulphate of tetrazodiphenyl , violent decomposition takes place .
The products formed are nitrogen , sulphuric acid , and a solid subtance , which separates in small indistinct plates on mixing the alcoholic fluid ( after the reaction is entirely over ) with a large quantity of water .
In order to free the precipitate from a ftrace of a brown substance , which likewise forms in the reaction , it is filtered off from the mother-liquor , dried , and then sublimed through paper , according to the method proposed by GORUP-BESANEZ .
The substance is thus obtained in the form of perfectly white plates , which dissolve easily in ether and hot alcohol , and which crystallize from the latter very much like naphtaline .
The new compound fuses at 70 ?
C. to an oil , which distils at a higher temperature without decomposition .
It possesses a peculiar aromatic odour like that of cinnamol and benzol combined .

Nitrate of tetrazodiphenyl is decomposed in a similar manner by boiling alcohol , but simultaneously the formation of a yellow nitro-acid takes place , which stands probably to the diphenylic alcohol in the same relation as the nitrophenol to phenylic alcohol ( compare also the corresponding decomposition of nitrate of diazobenzol , p. 683 ) .
Action of Sulphrc Acid upon Sulphte of Tetrazodhenyl On heating sulphate of tetrazodiphenyl dissolved in a small quantity of oil of vitriol , a violent evolution of nitrogen gas is observed .
The brown liquid which remains after the reaction has ceased contains , besides the excess of sulphuric acid employed , two new sulpho-acids , which can be separated by means of their barium-salts .
For this purpose the brown liquid is diluted with at least thirty times its volume of water , boiled , and saturated with carbonate of barium .
The precipitated sulphate of barium is then filtered off , the saline solution evaporated to dryness on the water-bath , and the residue several times extracted with hot water .
The portion remaining undissolved is the * If the diphenyl , prepared according to my method , has not been previously sublimed through paper as described , it crystallizes only in the form of small indistinct silvery white plates , which are so different from the large naphtaline-like plates described by FITTIG , that they appear at first sight to be crystals of quite a different compound .
5D2 72:5 barium-salt of a new acid which I will call tetrasulphodiphenylenic acid ; the soluble portion contains another new acid , for which the name trisulphodiphenylenic acid may be adopted .
I will first endeavour to give a brief description of the former .
The barium-salt of this acid , obtained as before mentioned , being only very slightly soluble in water , could not well be purified by recrystallization ; I preferred therefore to convert it into the ammonium-salt , which served me as a starting-point for the preparation of all the saline compounds presently to be described .
The ammonium-salt is readily obtained by decomposing the barium-salt with a solution of carbonate of ammonium .
The mixture is heated for a short time , the insoluble carbonate of barium filtered off , and the filtrate concentrated on a water-bath till the ammonium-salt crystallizes out on cooling .
One recrystallization from alcohol renders it in the form of perfectly pure white prisms .
Barium-salt of Tetrasuliphodiphenylenic Acid , 121 , 84 H2 Ba4 O5 To a rather concenltrated boiling solution of the ammonium-salt chloride of barium , is added , when this salt is precipitated as white needles or prisms ; the crystals are allowed to subside , and , after the mother-liquor has been separated by filtration , repeatedly washed with cold water ; in this manner they are obtained quite pure .

Pb ... 68-69 68-14 Tetrasulphodiphenylenic acid is easily to be obtained in a free state , either by decomposing the leador silver-salt with sulphuretted hydrogen , or by treating the barium-salts with an equvalent quantity of sulphuric acid .
The filtered aqueous solution is evaporated on a water-bath to a syrupy consistence , and placed over sulphuric acid ; after some time white needles or plates are obtained , which are very soluble in water and alcohol , but not deliquescent in the air .
I have not yet analyzed this acid ; but according to the above-mentioned salts it seems very probable that it can exist in two different states , as expressed by the formule 1g1 , s8 1H1 and 01216 , H H1 016 .
The second compound ( trisulphodiphenylenic acid ) to which the reaction of sulphuric acid or sulphate of tetrazobenzidol gives rise deserves likewise a few passing remarks .
The separation of its barium-salt from the barium-salt of tetrasulphodiphenylic acid by means of hot water has already been described .
The aqueous extracts thus obtained , sufficiently evaporated and allowed to cool , will generally solidify to a gelatinous mass from which distinct crystals cannot be obtained , even by repeated solution and evaporation .
Crystallization may , however , , be effected thus : The gelatinous salt is converted into the ammonia-compound , by boiling with an aqueous solution of carbonate of ammonium .
The excess of ammonia is removed by evaporation , and the crystalline residue dissolved in a little hot water and treated with a solution of chloride of barium .
On cooling , warty crystals , or globular groups of small plates , of the barium-salt are obtained , which can be freed from the difficultly-soluble tetrasulphodiphenylenate of barium with which it may still be contaminated , and also from the mother-liquor , by repeated crystallization from water .

It is evident at a glance that its composition may also be expressed in two different ways , viz. C12 H6B , 83 H4 011 , or C12 H , -3 H16 012 .
In accordance with the experiment just described , the decomposition which the tetrazodiphenyl undergoes by the action of sulphuric acid may be expressed by the following equations : I. %12H6N4 + S4 Hs 016=W12H6 S4 H -16 + N4 .

Decomposition of the Platinium-salt of Tetrazodiphenyl and of the Perbromide .
On mixing the platinum-salt of tetrazodiphenyl with from four to six times its weight of carbonate of sodium , and heating the mixture in a retort , a copious evolution of gas speedily ensues ; and on increasing the heat an oily body distils , which solidifies in the neck of the retort to a white mass .
By pressing this body between bibulous paper , and by repeated recrystallization from boiling alcohol , it is obtained perfectly pure .
Analogy leads to the supposition that the formation of this body takes place according to the equation 12 H6 N4 , 2H Cl , 2PtCl12C12 1H81Cl2+Cl4+Pt2+N4 Platinim-salt .
New body .
The following chlorine-determination corroborates this transformation : 0-235 grm. gave 0*2938 grm. of chloride of silver = 30-93 per cent. of chlorine .

Chlorine = 31-84 per cent. 30 -93 .
This new body , which I will call dichlorodiphenyl , crystallizes in white , usually wellformed prisms ; it is difficult of solution even in boiling alcohol , but readily soluble in 730 ether , and quite insoluble in water .
It fuses at 148 ?
C. to a yellowish oil , which can be distilled without decomposition .
On heating in like manner the perbromide of tetrazodiphenyl with carbonate of sodium , a mixture of bromine and nitrogen gas is evolved , and on heating more strongly an oily substance distils over , which quickly solidifies .
It is obtained pure for analysis by repeated recrystallization from ether .
0*322 grm. gave 0*5513 grm. of carbonic acid and 0*082 grm. of water .
These numbers correspond , as might be expected , with the formula C12 H Br2 .

The substance separates from the alcoholic solution on cooling in crystals ; it is best purified by distillation .
Dr. FITTIG informs me that he obtained a compound of like composition by acting with bromine upon diphenyl .
The description of this new compound given by him applies so entirely to the dibromodiphenyl prepared by me , that no doubt remains of the identity of the bodies obtained by different methods .
