A DESCRIPTION of the instruments for collecting atmospherical electricity used in the folloswing journal .
fFig .

) represent the apparatus .
AA fig. 1 , is a round deal rod , 20 feet long , twoinches diameter at the lover , and one inch at the upper end : into the lower end of it is celnented a solid glass pillar B , 22 inclaes long ; the lower end of this glass stands in a socket of wood C ) which is screved on the garret floor D , and supports the whole .
About seven feet above the floorn is firmly fixed to the snJall a strong arm of wcrod E , B &gt; hich holds perpendicularly a strorlg glass tube F , through which the rod is slided gently upsvards , till the glass pillar B may be lowered into the socket C. It is thus fixed and stands 12 inches from the wall The tube F is of sufficient width to admit a case of cork , which is fastened in the inside of it , at the part where the tube is sustained by the arm of wood E , so that the rod , when bent by the wind , cannot touch the tube or break it .
Tlae upper extremity of the rod is termirlated by several slaarppointed wires G ; two of them are of copper ) each one-eighth of an inch thick ; and , in order to stiffien the rodn as well as conduct more readily the electric fluids one of them is twisted round the-rod to the right hand , and the other to the eft , as low down as the brass collar H , to which they are soldered , in order to render their contact perfect .
A little above the upper end of the glass plllar B , is placed a brace II of solid glass sticks , to keep steady that part of the rod .
K is a 11ollour cylinder of wood , g=inches ulithin , proceedilzg from the ceiling through the roof LL , above svhicll there is a hollow tin cover M , 24 illCheS within , fxed to the rod ; which serves to defend the open cylinder K from the veather .
At a collvenient distance-frolx3L the foot of the rod is a hole bored through the floor and ceilint , .
This hole receives a glass tube covered with sealingwax ( as are all the other glasses in this apErarattls ) , through which a strong brass wire proceeding from the rod is correyed into the room below , wherein , at a convetlient height from the floor , it terminates with a two-inch brassball N. A strong ring of brass is made to m &lt; ve easy on the wire , and rests on the brass baII ; into this ring is screwed4f a brass wire seven inches long , which keeps suspended at its extremity a pith-ball electrolneter 0 .
At two irsches distaI3ce of the above-mentiolledS brass ball N , a bell P is supported by a strong wirev uthich passing thrcough a hole made in the wall , -is made to communicate , by means of a good metallic continuation Q , with the tuoist ground adjc)ining to the house .
A brass ball , three-tenths of an inch in diameter , is suspended beteZeen the bell P and ball N , by a silk thread fastened to a laail R. This ball serves for a clapper , by striking between the ball and bell , when the electrical charge of the rod is sufficiently strong .
V gives nearly a front view of this part of the apparatusS is:a small table fised to the wall under the bell and ball , at a convenient } : &lt; eight above the floor , upon which Leyden bottles and other apparatus are occasionally placed .
Any person versed in the science of electricity , will easilyunderstand thal ; th:is apparatus is calculated to show the various de-grees of intensity of atmospherical electricity ; and at the same time to avoid the pernicious effiects which may be occasioned by thunder-storms , or in short by any great quantity of electricity ila the atmosphere .
t The uThole perpendictllar height of both parts of this appa ratus taken together3 from the moist earth to the point at the top of the rod , is ( il feet .
If the insulation could be constantly kept in clue temperature , with respect to heat and cold , Iimagine it would always be electrified .
But I fear that ; cannot be done , without the ai(l of common fire ; which in so large an apparatus woulcI be very difficult , so that there might not be too much nor too little of it .
I am inclined to this opitlion , from the success I have had in a number of experimentsn in hich the aid of common fire was applied to ; mprove the insulation , as well as to collect the electric fluid .
When I find that the moisture in the air has so much inJured the insulation of my high pointed rod , that it will not -retain a-weak electricity , sa that case T make use of my hand exploring rod , which is about the length and thickness of a common fishing-rod , with plenty ozf small wire twined round it from end to erld .
The method of using itois simple and easy .
A representatioz of i-t may be distinctly seen in fig. 2 ; JIaving first warmed the glass legs of the stool , I place myself upon it , and raise the rod into a vertical position , keeping it $o for a minute or two ; I then with a finger of the other hantltouch a sensible electromet:ers and Xif the threads opell , it is sufficient .
But should the electrical state of the ttmospherebe too weak to produce that effect , which seldom happens , then in that case I -add to the rod a 7igZted torch T , :and place it as renlotefrom my hand as the strength of the rod will bear , and repeat the experiment ; thus-cir cumsta ; need,0it has never yet failed me .
eI:t will be necessary just to mention the method I have pursued ill forming the journal of atmospherical electricity .
This htas been principally:by means of the signs exhibited by the pith baIls 0 , connected with the rod .
When I::find these. .
closed , and attracted on the approach of my finger , yet not sufficierltly charged to repel each other , I write weak signs of electricity .
When I fitld the balls openg and , on the ap proach of excited glass , the balls close , I write they are electrified pc)sitively ; buty if the balls open wider , I write they are electrified negatively ; and the reverse when I use sealingwax.\Vllen the balls diverge one inch and upwards , visible $parks may be drawn at the brass ball SN.\Yhen sparks -are said to have been perceived in any observation , I have ge nerally on that account omitted to note the variable quan titiesof difirergency ill the pitll balls .
Their utluost l ; tnit of regular divergency seerns to be about five or near sis inches ; above that they are unsteady xand disorderly .
the pith l:alls are near two-te-nths of an inch fin diameter , suspended by very fine flaxell nthreads ( in the state it is ill from the heckle ) five inches longe When I mention the distance of the balls in t-etlths of an inch , it is to be understood as nearly so as my eye can determitze .
Thisfapparatus reqiliresa constant attention especially during a disturbed state of the atmosphere .
From the room in which the apparatus is placed I am seldom absent one hour , excepting the time of sleep ; but , when I leave it , the last thing I do at night is to examine the state of the electricity , and , if I find the rod unelectrified , I then place the Leyden bottle on the table S , with its knob nearly in contact with the ball N. The next morning , if I find this bottle charged , I write the kind of electricity it is charged with against the day in the journal , and add , by the night bottle .
It is presumed , that the table is sufficiently obvious .
The two columns for positive and negative electricity are used only for the first observation of each day .
I use FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer , suspended on the north outside of a bow-window .
The time of making the observation with it , and the barometer , and also of the direction of the wind , has usually been nine o'clock in the morning .
Lastly , it may be useful to observe , that I have always found , when the rod is highly electrified , the lower though uninsulated part of the apparatus ( viz. the metallic connection of the bell P with the moist earth ) to be in a contrary state of electricity to the upper and insulated part .
See the 20th of May .
Having made a memorandum of the several thunder-storms which have happened in divers parts of this island , according to information by letters , and from newspapers , I thought it useful to insert them in this journal , in order to show whether some contemporaneous appearances in my apparatus might not be attributed to them .

A clear fine morning .
One o'clock P.M. a sudden shower of rain fell ; the pith balls O , connected with the lower end of the rod , were now charged negatively , and increased in strength as the rain came on ; in a short time the electricity changed to positive .
Five o'clock , the electricity changed again to negative , I then heard some distant rumbling of thundes .

EIalf afEer nine o'clock A.M. fell a little rain ; as it increased so did the electric charge in the rod , insomuch that it strealued forth from the brass ball N for a short time .
Six o'clock A.M. One o'clock P.M. a low black sky , by which the charge in the rod became negative , with sparks ; after continuing so one hour , the electricity changed again to positive .
The rod has been in charge 16 hours this day ; how much more t cannot say .
A.M. At four o'clock P.M. fell a mild rain , void of the electric fluid .
At five o'clock the rain fell more copiously , and it was strongly charged with negative electricity .
Early this morning I found the humidity of the air electrified negatively .
At ten o'clock , the electricity became more intense , so as to emit small sparks : in half an hour 's time there were four beautiful gradu ; ll changes of electricity .
Afterwards the rod remained negative two hours .
Three o'clock P.M. the electricity changed , and continued near three hours positive .
After this a low black cloud passed over the rod , and let fall a few drops of rain mixed with 66 64 7o 72 72 65 ooooooo neg .

I found the rod elec trified posit-ively , and nearly of the same intensity it was in when I left it last nigllt ; that is to say , capable of emitting small sparks .
The atmosphere this morning is perfectly serene .
There is a dewg or low fog , about five or six feet high , spread over the ground in Hyde-Park , very beautiful to look upon from an upper window For the space of two hours , this vapour graclually iIlcreased , and ascerlded higher and t higher , until it quite intercepted the trees from my slght , and became a pale wet ig ; which veC much injured the insulation of tTie rod .
for during its sncrease in height , the electricity of the rod decreased , insomuch , that I had almost concluded that the pith ballsW touched eaGh other But during this i short suspense the sun rose higher and diminished the fog 7ery fast ; and the electricity in the rod soon increase ed to its fiormer strength 9 and so continued all dayX Five o'clock A*Nte T found the rod elec | trified positively but rather weaker than Days .

Anal as for the relllaining diSerellce , I also attribute a good deal of it to t]Ae accuracy vf my prewnt mode of obtailaing atmospherical electricity with a more complete apparatus ; by which I have been able to collect the electric fluid , in suicient quantity to ascertain the kind which predominates in the atmosphere , even in its weakest state .
I have therefbres founcl it an easy matter to fix the kind of electricity that the aqueous vapours in the air were charged with in each day throughout the year .
Frotn repeated observations , and long experience I am perfectly satisfied that the aqueous vapours , suspended ill the air are constalltly electrified ; requiring OIlly the aid of a proper collector , to render the effects of their electricity at all times sensible .
And for this reason , there mfay be justly said to be , an electrical atmosphere within our aerial atmosphere .
During a courw of moderate weather , the electricity of the atmosphere is invariably positive ; and exhibits a flux and reflux , which generally causes it to increase and decreaw twice in every twenty-four 11ours .
rlthe moments of its greatest force are about two or three hours afker the rising , and some time before and after the setting , of the sun ; those when it is weakest , are fkom mid-day to about fc)ur oclock .
The periodical electricity of the atmosphere seems to be manifestly influenced by 2 ?
eat and cold .
Hence it plainly appears , why we always find warm small rain to be but weakly electrified ; when cold raill , which falls in large drops , is the most intensely electriEed of any The abovementioned eighth day of MaJr , colllpletes my second years journal ; which , agreeable to my promikse , I have now the honour of pressenting to the Royal SocietyX with a L1 e &amp;c. description of the iuproved atmospheric apparatus , which has been used for the foregoing observations .
T must now close that regular account which for the last two years , has daily occupied my attention .
Should any very remarkable appearances , however , in future take place , during a long coLzrse of fiIsosty veather , which is the only state of the atnesphere that I have not yet experienced7 as my apparatus s^rill continue in orderg I shall carefully note them , and present them to the Royal Society : hoping that some more able philosopher may be induced to take his share of labour in this interesting and proznising field in order to investigateX as far as possible , the nature of so activen universal ) and , in all probability , important an agentv as the atmospherical electricity seems to be ; and to pursue the subject ?
with that diligence , and unprqudiced accuracy , which has been my pl incipal ohject in the course of my observations * As I do not lemember that there have been twenty-foul hours of hard iRQStx during $he two last winter* XiGo .
