Polyzoa.\#151 ; By G , ( Plate X. ) Owing to the absence* of any published accounts of the Polyzoa collected at Kerguelen Island by the Challenger , the American Transit of Venus , and the German Surveying and Transit of Venus Expeditions in 1874-75 , the subjoined list treats exclusively of Mr. Eaton 's collection .
The 26 or 27 species comprised in it are all of them inhabitants of the littoral or Laminarian zone , and were obtained with the grapple in Swain 's Bay and Observatory Bay .
Of the whole number 17 or 18 belong to the suborder Cheilostomata , 9 to the Cyclostomata .
No representative of the Ctenostomata was collected .
The collection affords nine or ten forms previously undescribed ; the remainder belong to a fauna which ranges from the southern extremity of S. America ( which may he regarded as its " centre " ) to New Zealand in a westerly direction , one or two species extending even farther , to Australia and the Cape of Good Hope .
It is observable that no Arctic form has been brought from Kerguelen Island , although some have been met with further south , two instances of the occurrence of the Arctic Korneva lichenoides obtained during the voyage of H.M.SS .
" Erebus " and " Terror " having been communicated to me by Sir J. Hooker .
Mr. Eaton suspects their absence may be attributed to the shallowness of the areas searched by him , the greatest depth being not more than 10 fathoms .

In the description of this species given in the British Museum Catalogue ( loc. cit. ) no mention is made of the small avicularium with a semicircular mandible , BE 2 placed ( as in L. verrucosa , a very closely allied form ) on the upper side of the umho .
It should he remarked also that in the Kerguelen Island specimens the cells are much larger than those in examples from Tierra del Euego , and that the avicularia ( which in these last form a prominent feature ) are very few and scattered .
The Kerguelen Island form is in fact altogether a more robust variety than the other .

Lepralia liyalina usually forms very regular circular patches ( most commonly upon seawreeds ) composed of hyaline , elongated , cylindrical or barrel-shaped cells , having the mouth circular and of variable size , sinuated or notched in the lower margin , the peristome thin and usually quite unarmed ( though in some instances there are two short blunt marginal projections on the upper edge , \#151 ; processes rather than spines\#151 ; as in the var .

But with these general characters occur several forms , apparently varieties of one species , which differ very widely from one another in the extremes .
Some of them indeed might ( perhaps more properly ) be regarded as distinct species ; but on the whole , when the intermediate forms are taken into consideration , it seems allowable to treat them as varieties .

In addition to such varieties , then , of this protean species , as are given in the British Museum Catalogue , Kerguelen Island affords what appear to he three others .
These , together with one of those referred to in the Catalogue , which is in Mr. Eaton 's collection , make four forms in the present series doubtfully ascribed to L. hyalina ; viz.:\#151 ; Yar .

Two such specimens of the Idmonea are here figured ( Plate X. , figs. 15 , 16 ) .
The zoooecium springs in the usual way from a small hemispherical vesicle , rising at once in a tubular form , and soon sending forth a lateral bud or secondary tube , and so on .
In no stage does it resemble a , not being adnate except at the extremity , or merely by a few lateral struts from the first cell or two .

M. H'Orbigny 's figure appears to represent the mode of growth of this form ; and as the species is extremely abundant on the kelp at Kerguelen Island , I have little hesitation in applying to it the appellation given by him to the Palkland Islands form .
The manner of growth in narrow , ligulate , dichotomously dividing branches that hardly expand at all at the extremity and which are composed of short irregular series of tubes diverging on either side from the median line , is not unlike the growth of T. serpens ; and I am not certain whether T. organizans might not well be regarded as a variety of that species .
Upon the whole , however , sufficient diversity is apparent between the two to justify their specific distinction .
One marked character which I consider important , is the manner in which the growth of the zoarium commences .
This proceeds as usual from a semiglobose vesicle ; but in the form considered by me to be T. organizans this vesicle or bulla is supported by numerous short processes , which form a kind of denticulate border round its attached base .
Prom this bulla arises a single tube whose mouth expands and gives rise from its interior to a second tube which buds forth laterally in the usual way , \#151 ; and so on .
