The Palaeolithic Deposits at Society , which lead us to hope that borings , to he shortly undertaken for economic purposes , may , either with or without aid from this Society , supply the means of reaching greater depths than that attained at Zagazig , and possibly of reaching the old floor of solid rocks on which the Sub-delta deposits rest .
" The Palaeolithic Deposits at Hitchin and their Relation to the Glacial Epoch .
" By Clement Reid , F.L.S. , F.G.S. , of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom .
Communicated by Sir Archibald Geikie , F.R.S. Received February 15 , \#151 ; Head March 4 , 1897 .
Certain excavations and borings at Hoxne , undertaken in the year 1896 at the cost of the British Association and of the Royal Society , threw much light on the relation of Palaeolithic man to the Glacial Epoch .
It was thought advisable therefore to examine the similar deposits at Hitchin , to ascertain to what extent the conclusions already arrived at were supported by exploration at a fresh locality .
It was desired also to see whether a new locality would aid us in restoring pages in the geological history missing in the Hoxne record .
At the instance of Sir Archibald Geikie , a grant of \#163 ; 50 was made by the Council of the Royal Society towards the cost of the necessary excavations , borings , and incidental expenses , unavoidable if the inquiry was to be carried out satisfactorily .
Of this sum , only about \#163 ; 30 has been expended , for , after reaching a certain stage with good results , it was discovered that any further advance meant a far greater expenditure of time and money than seemed justified .
Work was therefore stopped as soon as the main point under dispute had been cleared up , and a sufficient series of fossil plants had been obtained to determine the climatic conditions that held while the ancient alluvial strata were being deposited .
It is perhaps scarcely necessary under the circumstances to do more than allude to the results of previous work .
Palaeolithic implements have long been known from Hitchin , and their position in and at the base of a stony brickeartli was well ascertained .
It was also known that this brickearth rested on loam and shell marl , with fresh-water mollusca and mammalian remains .
All this had been made perfectly clear , principally by the researches of Prestwich , Sir John Evans , Mr. W. Ransom , and Mr. William Hill .
The most important of the doubtful points were the relations of these ancient alluvia to the widespread sheet of chalky boulder clay , and to the valleys of the existing streams .
In the prosecution of these supplementary researches I have been greatly aided by the local assistance freely rendered by Mr. William and their Relation to the Glacial Epoch .
41 Hill and Mr. W. Ransom .
I have also to thank the different land-owners and tenants , especially Mr. Theodore Ransom and Mr. Jeeves , for the liberality with which they have permitted excavations and borings to be made on their land .
A preliminary examination of the neig'hbourhood of Hitchin convinced me that the Palasolithic and ancient alluvial deposits there found occupied a small irregular valley , which had become silted up and almost obliterated .
It was desirable to construct an accurate geological section across this valley , such as we were able to draw at Hoxne ; but it seemed likely that conditions would prove much less favourable than at Hoxne , and that the coarse , loose , and watery character of the strata would render work difficult .
Such proved to be the case , and , instead of being able to make a connected chain of borings , it was necessary to select sites where the difficulties could best be avoided .
The result of this method of work has been , that while the general structure and relation of the deposit has become perfectly clear , it is impossible to draw an accurate section across the old valley .
Bore after bore was stopped by the closing in of the sides or by the gravelly nature of the beds , and though no doubt with time and money the deposits could have been pierced , previous experience did not encourage me to persevere , or to hope for any very definite results even if the bottom of the old channel were reached .
Attention was therefore mainly devoted to the search for boulder clay beneath the Palaeolithic loams , and to the sinking of a trial pit and bore at the point where the buried valley appeared to be deepest .
This exploration tended to show that the story told by the old valley at Hoxne was repeated at Hitchin .
Indeed the succession of events at the two localities was so similar as to leave scarcely a doubt that we were dealing with an equivalent set of strata , though unfortunately the series was less perfect , and the gaps discovered at Hoxne are still unbridged by any records yet found at Hitchin .
Hitchin yields strong corroborative evidence in favour of the conclusions arrived at in the Hoxne Report , and adds somewhat to our knowledge of the temperate flora of the ancient alluvial strata lying between the chalky boulder clay and the Palaeolithic brickeartli .
I must confess , however , that in other respects the results are somewhat disappointing .
Hitchin lies in the valley cut by the Hiz , a small stream which rises within a mile of the town .
Chalk is seen in the valleys , and rises irregularly through the thick sheet of drift that masks most of the area .
The greater part of this drift consists of coarse flint gravel , partly of Glacial , partly of Palaeolithic age , and one of the greatest difficulties met with is the impossibility of deciding whether any particular pit is in Glacial or in Post-glacial gravel , and whether the gravel passes under or over the chalky boulder clay .
The material 42 Mr. C. Reid .
The Palaeolithic Deposits at being used again and again , the composition of the gravel is practically the same in each case , except for the occurrence of implements in the newer deposits .
It was soon found that Mr. Hill was right as to the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory evidence from a study of the gravels .
Even between clear sections correlation is impossible , and boring in boulder gravels is so difficult and expensive that I did not feel justified in spending money in attempting to penetrate them to the boulder clay .
Even if the boulder clay were reached , it would be fairly open to any critic to say that nothing had been settled , as there is no evidence which of some three or four gravels may be the one represented at that particular spot .
The first thing to be done evidently was to ascertain whether the chalky boulder clay , an undoubted glacial deposit , passes under or over the Paleolithic brickearth .
With this object , borings were made in the pits out of which implements have been dug .
The details of the borings are given in the Appendix ; the results may be shortly summarised thus:\#151 ; In Ransom 's ( New ) Brickyard , after penetrating the Palteolithic brickearth and underlying fluviatile loam to a depth of 60 feet , some blue , chalky clay was penetrated in BH 2 , and in BH 1 derivative fossils from the boulder clay were obtained at about the same level in the lower part of the old alluvium .
In each case boring was stopped by gravelly sand full of water .
Other borings in Jeeves ' Yard and in some old brick-pits on Maydeneroft Farm yielded no trace of boulder clay .
One only ( BH 12 ) passed through undoubted boulder clay .

^ I'-Chalky boulder clay j Loamy chalky gravel The site of this boring is close to the western margin of the old channel , chalk appearing at the surface within a short distance .
The occurrence of the chalky boulder clay at this spot at a high level , and its absence , or representation by derivative material , at lower levels in borings made nearer to the centre of the channel , suggest that the channel was , to a large extent , excavated , or re-excavated , after the deposition of the boulder clay , as was the case at Hoxne .
and their Relation to the Glacial The course of the ancient silted-up channel cannot yet be defined .
Loam with Palaeolithic implements occupies a belt extending for about a mile south of Hitchin .
It has been extensively woi'ked at various times between Windmill Hill and Maydencroft Lane .
According to Mr. Hill , implements have also been found on Thistly Farm , half a mile further south .
The only pits now worked are those known as " Ransom 's " and " Jeeves ' .
" The underlying river alluvium is entirely overlapped and hidden by the Palaeolithic brickearth , and is only to be seen where the brickearth has been dug away .
It is found in Ransom 's and Jeeves ' brickyards , and we have now discovered it , half a mile to the S.S.W. , in two borings on Maydencroft Farm .
It apparently occupies a narrow belt in the middle of the old valley .
The greatest depth of this valley could not be proved , owing to the running sand and gravel , which made boring so difficult .
The bottom lies at least as low as the level of the existing valleys of the Hiz and Pui'well , for five different borings were abandoned at about that level , without having reached chalk .
The trend of the buried channel seems to be from south to north , in this following the general slope of the ground and running parallel to the course of the existing streams .
Work was commenced last November in Ransom 's brickyard , one boring being put down at the east corner and another at the south end .
The section at the east corner showed 30 feet of Palaeolithic loam , resting on 25 feet of carbonaceous loam with freshwater shells , below which came 12 feet of loamy sand and gravel of doubtful age \#151 ; perhaps glacial , perhaps later .
At the south end BH 2 showed\#151 ; Feet .

3 Other borings in Jeeves ' Yard and near Maydencroft Farm yielded 44 Mr. C. Reid .
The PalceolithicDeposits at similar results , but only the one already mentioned ( BH 12 ) reached undoubted boulder clay below the alluvial strata .
The relation of the boulder clay to the alluvial deposits having been settled , attention was devoted to an attempt to penetrate to the bottom of the valley in its deepest part .
A trial-pit was sunk in Ransom 's old brickyard , within a few yards of the spot where a pit had been sunk by Messrs. Prestwich and Evans in 1877 , and samples were taken from various depths for washing and minute examination in London .
In this brickyard a large number of implements had been obtained from the irregular gravelly base of the brickearth , where it rests on the older alluvial deposits .
The newer brickearth , here about 24 feet thick , had been already entirely removed at the spot where the trial-pit was sunk , and it was hoped that the pit could be sunk to the full depth of the old channel .
After sinking 14 feet through brown bedded carbonaceous loam , full of badly preserved shells and plant remains , the weather became so unsettled that there was a fear of the pit caving in , or becoming flooded , before the work was completed .
Boring tools were therefore used , and a further depth of 17| feet of alluvial loam was penetrated before the gravelly sand below was reached .
At the base of the alluvium was found a foot or so of hard black loam with freshwater shells and fragments of Jurassic fossils derived from the boulder clay .
As the quicksand below could not be penetrated without the expenditure of more time and money than could fairly be devoted to such unsatisfactory work , the boring was then abandoned .
In working out the material afterwards , it became evident that from top to bottom the alluvial deposits below the Paleolithic brickearth belonged to one series , the same plants occurring throughout .
W e have therefore only two deposits to deal with a stony brickearth yielding little or nothing but Paleolithic implements , and a series of ancient alluvial deposits below full of plants and shells , but , as far as known , without trace of man .
The mammalian remains all come , I am informed , from the whitish marly silt which occurs locally immediately below the Paleolithic brickearth .
They are mostly in Mr. W. Ransom 's collection , and were determined by Mr. Sanford .
The remainder of the animals and plants , with the exception of two-species of mollusca , were obtained in the trial-pit just described .
For the determination of the fishes , I must thank my colleague , Mr. E. T. Newton ; for the mosses Mr. W. Mitten ; for the mollusca and flowering plants I am responsible .

Such trees as the oak , ash , sloe , cornel , elder , and alder point unmistakably to a temperate climate , and the fauna and flora as a whole suggest climatic conditions not differing greatly from those 46 Mr. C. Reid .
The Palaeolithic Deposits Hitchin we now enjoy .
Mr. Mitten writes of the mosses , that " all these are inhabitants of a sylvan temperate region ... .
and none point to a different environment from that now existing ; they are not arctic .
" The occurrence of Naias marina , now only found in Britain in two of the Norfolk Broads , is singular , though the plant was evidently more common in former times than at the present day .
It has now been discovered in the pre-glacial deposits of Norfolk and .Suffolk , beneath Palaeolithic remains at Hitchin , and in a submerged peat of Neolithic date at Barry Docks , in South Wales .
The resemblance of the Hitchin Palaeolithic brickearth to the Palaeolithic brickearth of Hoxne , and the similarity of the old alluvia beneath , both in fossil contents and in the physical changes they suggest , is so striking that one is compelled to correlate them bed by bed .
If , however , this correlation be correct , it is evident that the intermediate deposit full of leaves of Arctic willows , so conspicuous over part of the area at Hoxne , is missing at Hitchin .
At each locality the same story is told .
Some time after the passing away of the ice the land stood higher than now , so that the streams had a greater fall and valleys were cut to a somewhat greater depth .
Then the land sank and the valleys became silted up with layer after layer of alluvium , to a depth of at least 30 feet , the climate remaining temperate .
The next stage , when an arctic flora reappeared , is only represented at Hoxne .
The third stage in the infilling of the valleys is shown in the curious unstratified decalcified brickearth with scattered stones and Palaeolithic implements , identical in character at Hitchin , Hoxne , Pisherton , and other localities , which irresistibly suggests a mingling of wind-transported material and rainwash .
It may be pointed out that if this hypothesis of the origin of the Palaeolithic brickearth during the reign of " steppe " conditions be accepted , it will account for the non-correspondence of the ancient channels with the present valleys , a thing very difficult to explain if the infilling were caused by ordinary fluviatile action .
If the Paleolithic brickearth is equivalent to the Paleolithic loess of the ancient deserts in central Europe , we can understand how during this period of cold drought the smaller streams ceased to flow and their valleys became so filled with rainwash and dust that when a moister climate recurred the streams had to seek new channels .

" By John Berry Haycraft , M.D. , University College , Cardiff .
Communicated by Professor Schafer , F.R.S. Received February 9 , \#151 ; Read March 4 , 1897 .
The luminosity of the spectrum was determined by what may be termed the method of the " minimal effective stimulus .
" Through the partition separating two dark rooms from each other a hole was drilled 1 mm. across ; this was covered with a piece of ground glass .
From a diffraction grating in room A spectral rays of ascertainable wave-length were cast upon the ground glass .
The observer in room B was placed upon a graduated railway , and moved towards or from the spot of light until he could just see it , and no more .
The distances at which various parts of the spectrum were just seen were thus determined , and their relative potencies calculated by the law of inverse squares .
Under the above conditions\#151 ; the eye being in the condition of dark adaptation\#151 ; the green near E is the most potent , and the violet half of the spectrum is more potent than the red .
These results agree with those obtained by Captain Abney who also worked with the dark adapted eye .
The experiment was then repeated , the room B being whitewashed , and lit with gas light , and the eye of the observer , therefore , in the condition of light adaptation .
Under these conditions the yellow is the most potent , and the red half of the spectrum more potent than the violet .
In the following experiment the eye was in the condition of
