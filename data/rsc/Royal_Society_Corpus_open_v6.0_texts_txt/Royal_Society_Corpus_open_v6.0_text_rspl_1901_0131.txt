During the course of a long series of experiments , designed to seek further information regarding the relations between the host and the parasite , in the case of certain species of Bromus and the Rust-fungus , Puccinia dispersa ( Eriks .
) , it fell out that a simple method of obtaining pure cultures of both host and parasite was attainable .

On Pure Cultures Tube-cultures .
In order to obtain more decisive answers to such questions as\#151 ; Are any of the results obtained on plants in the open , or merely covered with bell-jars and so forth , due to spores accidentally introduced , or to mycelium , \amp ; c. , already in the plant ?
\#151 ; a number of infections were made on seedlings germinated and grown anti-septically in tubes as follows:\#151 ; As a preliminary trial , to test whether grass seedlings would live long enough in tubes and show the results of infection , I placed seedlings , all similar , and bearing three to four leaves , in test-tubes , the roots , carefully washed free of soil , resting on wet cotton wool , and the orifice of the tube plugged .
The results of two series apparently showed that spores from B. mollis infect B. mollis and B. B. secalinusand B.amends , but not B. while spores grown on B. sterilis only infected B.secalinus and B. amends ( see Table I ) .
It is a striking fact that under the conditions afforded by these closed tubes , with their stagnant moist atmosphere , spores from B. sterilis apparently succeeded in infecting B. secalinus and The pustules were small , and it is significant that it took 14 days ' incubation to establish the mycelium , against 9 days in the case of spores from B. mollis .
There are , however , other slight departures from the usual course of events\#151 ; e.g. , spores from B. mollis failed on B. arvensis and succeeded on B. sterilis\#151 ; which may point to the probability that these uprooted seedlings in tubes are not in their normal conditions .
The facts seem worth recording in this connection .
I varied these tube-cultures by placing them , after infection , under cuvettes filled with copper sulphate ( blue light ) or bichromate of potassium ( orange light ) .
The results were somewhat contradictory as regards the blue , but it did appear that the spores coming from B. mollis can infect B.sterilis as well as B. secalinus , as the following Table II shows .
It is important here to bear in mind the origin of the seedlings themselves , however , as a serious source of error was discovered in these uprooted seedlings , previously exposed to possible infection in the open .
The same criticisms , in fact , apply to these transplanted garden seedlings in tubes as I have given elsewhere regarding such experiments in pots , viz. , it was always possible that the seedling was already infected , or had wind-blown spores on it when removed from the beds .
At the same time the long incubation period , 14 days in some cases , , fails to support this .
* An exceptional circumstance , as numerous experiments have shown , and itself sufficient to raise the criticism which follows .

On of a Uredine , Puccinia dispersa ( Eriks .
) .
455 To meet this objection I devised operations as follows :\#151 ; Clean picked seeds were placed singly , by means of forceps , on filter paper at the bottom of Petri-dishes properly sterilised by heat .
When these had germinated , and observation showed that the whole series was free of moulds or other signs of contamination , the seedlings were removed by means of sterile forceps , and transplanted singly into sterilised tubes of various kinds as described below , and the further growth allowed to proceed in the light under conditions varied as will be seen .
I had already shown that seedlings will continue to grow in such tubes , but , as we have seen , in the cases previously described I had no guarantee that the seedlings introduced into the culture-tubes did not already carry on their leaves wind-borne or otherwise transmitted spores .
In the case of these seedlings germinated from clean " seed " in sterile dishes and tubes , it is obvious that the only chance of infection depends on spores attached to the " seed " or on mycelium in the seed .
Experiments with seed gathered even from badly rusted plants and germinated as above , have never given rusted seedlings , although other experiments have shown me that the germ-tubes of attached spores can infect seedlings when the plumule is only 3\#151 ; 5 mm. high .
Nor have I ever been able to discover any trace of mycelium in the seeds .
But if the " seed " of the Brooms is sterilised before germination\#151 ; as can be done by steeping in various antiseptics , or by heating to 60\#151 ; 70 ' C.\#151 ; it is found that pure cultures of the Brome may be obtained in the tubes , and it is then only necessary to infect such a clean seedling with the spores of the parasite to obtain a pure culture of the latter .
Preliminary experiments soon showed that the Brome seedlings thus raised from seeds treated antiseptically , and protected from the first by glass , may be grown for weeks and even for a couple of months in such tubes under proper precautions , and I set myself the task of ascertaining how such cultures would behave in infection experiments .
In the following experiment\#151 ; No. 711\#151 ; eight upright tubes of the kind known to chemists as " drying towers , " were prepared as in the diagram ( fig. 1 ) , so that by means of an aspirator attached to the tubing at G , a continuous current of damp air could be slowly drawn through the whole series , aerating the roots of the seedlings F , which burrowed into the cotton-wool B , day and night .
The tubes were charged each with one seedling , grown from seeds heated to 65 ' C. , and 48 hours after germination had begun , and the latter allowed to grow in the light on a table outside the laboratory .
The tubes were charged on June 14 , and on June 19 , when the first green leaf was well developed , the latter was infected at a definite spot with spores\#151 ; proved Prof. H. Marshall Ward .
On Pure Cultures to be capable of vigorously germinating by cultures in hanging drops \#151 ; and the whole series linked up and aerated .
The growth of these seedlings in the moist air-current was very satisfactory , the plants Fig. 1 .

In this series the liquid employed was the normal Knop s mineral solution ( + ) , so well known as used in water-cultures .
The tubes were charged with this before sterilisation , enough being put in to wet the cotton-wool plug ( B ) , and fill the reservoir ( C ) , the side-tube y being fused at its pointed end during sterilising .

On Pure Cultures Since each tube is linked to its neighbour with clean flexible tubing , and the air bubbles through the liquid in the reservoir ( C ) , and has to pass the cotton-wool plug ( B ) before reaching the leaves ( F ) in the air above , there can be no question of infection from outside , and the results also show that infection only occurs exactly where I place the spores on the leaf in each case .
The spores employed were carefully tested as regards their germinating power , and , as the table shows , the results in the closed tubes fully bear out previous experience .
In the aspirated tubes , however , the second pair of seedlings of B. mollis ( No. 712 ) gave negative results , inasmuch as only flecks , and not pustules bearing spores , were developed .
In the closed tubes , however\#151 ; see below\#151 ; the positive results , especially on B.velutinus and B. were excellent , and subsequent examination showed that the spores germinated well , and were capable of infecting other seedlings .
In order to test further the behaviour in mineral solutions , I prepared , as Table III shows , several series in closed tubes , Nos. 713 , which served as a parallel series to Nos. 711 and 712 , but without aeration .
In No. 713 the sterile seedlings were raised antiseptically as before , but the roots merely penetrated cotton-wool saturated with Knop 's solution , and held by the constriction over the bulb filled with the same , no air being drawn through .
The growth was excellent , and the results very conclusive , as Table III shows .
The seedlings were allowed two days at 22\#151 ; 20 ' C. in the laboratory and then put out side by side with 711 and 712 in full sun during the middle of the day , and after two days ' further growth were infected .
By the 10th day the thin leaf was well developed , and the first pustule was seen on B. mollis and B. secalinus on the eighth day after infection .
The Table III shows the course of events in detail .
The growth of pustules was excellent on B. and B. secalinus especially .
This experiment is interesting , not only as showing that plants can be grown and infected successfully in these closed water-cultures , but especially as showing the contrast between the aerated and non-aerated tubes , for , since the infected seedlings were selected in each case from the same Petri-dish cultures , we must assume that the difference in I'ate of development was due to the difference of ventilation , and perhaps conclude that this interferes with the success of the parasite , as measured by the somewhat longer incubation period .
It is remarkable how dwarfed the continuously aerated plants are , compared with those in closed tubes , owing to the elongation of the leaves of the latter .
It is clear , therefore , that pure cultures of Uredo-spores can be obtained by this method , and it is equally clear that we can also obtain of a Uredine , Puccinia dispersa { Eriks .
) .
45 O ' pure cultures of the host-plants , and since we can do this , there is no reason why the infection of Uredinese should not be conducted as rigorously and exactly as that of bacteria .
As matter of fact , I have succeeded in proving that it can , * though of course the length of time occupied in a large series of cultures and infections will prove troublesome , and it remains to be seen whether we can get such plants to flower .
The following Table IV gives the results of an additional series where B. secalinuswas the host , and spores from the same used as as infecting material .
In this case the tubes used were closed from the first ( see fig. 2 ) .
These results appear to me to dispose effectually of the question as to whether or not pure cultures of Uredinese can be obtained .
A number of isolated tube-cultures were made with spores from B. sterilis , B. mollis and B. secalinus , and arranged similarly , and confirmatory results obtained .
Moreover , I was able in several cases to transfer successfully spores from these pure tube-cultures to other tubes of pure cultures of seedlings , and to prove that the spores raised under strictly antiseptic conditions are capable of germination and infection .
At the same time , it was noteworthy that in several cases the anti-septically raised spores were not always successful in infecting the seedlings , and it remains for further investigation to determine whether this was due to the conditions of culture of the fungus or the host or both .
Experiments with Mineral Supplies .
The question arose during some of the tube-experiments , Do infection and incubation occur normally if the host-plant is suffering from a lack of any particular ingredient in the soil\#151 ; e.cj .
, one of the essential minerals ?
To answer this , I prepared tube-cultures as before\#151 ; as in experiments Nos. 711 and 713 , \amp ; c.\#151 ; substituting for the normal nutritive solution , in some of the tubes , the same solution minus calcium , or minus potassium , or magnesium or phosphoric acid , respectively , with the results shown in the following Table Y. The only positive result was with spores from B. mollis , which infected B. mollis in spite of the lack of Mg salts .
In other cases flecks only were developed .
This experiment cannot be regarded as very decisive , but it at least shows that infection can occur when Mg is lacking , though the incubation period ( 13 days ) was somewhat long .
As the pot-cultures show , no positive results were to be expected with infected from B. mollis .
* I.e. , of course so far as fungi are concerned : the antiseptic treatment adopted does not always exclude harmless bacteria .

The following experiment ( Table YI ) seems at first sight very suggestive in its definite results , but much more work will be needed before we can generalise widely .
Five tubes with bulbs below were charged with a seedling each of B. arvensand five with B. velutinus , one of each five tubes having normal Detmer 's solution , one the same minus K , Ca , \amp ; c. , respectively .
The seedlings were 10 days old , grown antiseptically on moist filter paper , and therefore exhausting the reserves , and would probably come at once under the full influence of the mineral solutions .
Each seedling was infected forthwith with spores from B. , tested , and found to be not very vigorous in germination .
Since all were infected alike , however , on the first leaf and from the same batch of spores , I think we must regard the results as fairly comparable .
As the table shows , every plant of B. velutinus had spore-bearing pustules in 10\#151 ; 11 days , whereas the B. arvensis gave no signs , if we except one doubtful pustule on the 11th day in the tube devoid of potassium .
It seems necessary to conclude from this series that B.arvensis is far less easily infected than B. velutinus under any conditions of mineral supply afforded .
The experiment also shows that in the case of a susceptible plant such as B. velutinus , no appreciable effect is produced by the mineral supply in the short time ( 10\#151 ; 11 days ) occupied in incubation .
Something may turn out to be due to the differences in size of the seeds , however .
Meanwhile I had made some experiments on seedlings started in pots of coir-fibre , under conditions more Table V.\#151 ; Large Tube-cultures of Seedlings , Germinated on Damp Filter-paper for six days , and then placed with their Roots in Mineral Solutions , and infected two days later .

Pure Cult of a TJredine , Puccinia dispersa { Eriks .
) .
463 nearly approaching the normal than , perhaps , the tubes afford , to see if the influence of mineral supplies , or lack of such , at the roots affects the questions before us .
Seeds of four species of Brome were sown in pots of coco-fibre ( coir ) thoroughly steamed in a steriliser .
The seedlings\#151 ; all except B. asper\#151 ; came up satisfactorily , but did not form strong plants eventually .
As the following Table VII shows , infection failed in all cases , in spite of the fact that the seedlings were given a double dose of spores .
It is difficult to explain the negative results with B. mollis .
The temptation is to conclude that the host-plant , being starved of mineral supplies , gave the infecting germ-tube no chance to establish itself , but I think much more work must be done before this is established .
The following experiments , however , yielded results which seem to show that the nature or amount of the mineral supply may after all be not without effect .
Small pots were packed with washed coco-nut fibre and sterilised by steam , and " seeds " of B.mollis sown in twelve of them .
Germination was started at 27c C. in the artificial greenhouse and the pots then placed in a well-lighted , ordinary greenhouse and watered as follows :\#151 ; Two with Detmer 's normal solution , and two each with the same minus K , Ca , Mg , and P205 respectively , while two were kept as controls watered with distilled water .
On the 5th day the spears were up and the first leaf unfolding , and one pot of each pair mentioned infected with spores from B. mollis .
The parallel set were similarly infected , with spores from , two days later , a different crop of spores being used .
After four days ' incubation under wet beakers\#151 ; in the case of the first six pots\#151 ; and two days\#151 ; in the case of the second six\#151 ; all were put out side by side in a sunny place under a large bell-jar .
Two days later the bell-jar was removed .
The pots were placed well apart , each in its own saucer , and equal carefully measured doses of the minerals given at intervals .
The seedlings grew admirably at first , but began to show the effects of the mineral deficiency in a few days .
Meanwhile the incubation period was being completed .
The results appear in Table VIII .
There were , however , very marked points of difference between the appearances in this series 716 and those seen in perfectly normal plants\#151 ; e.g. , series 735\#151 ; 736 and 738 .
In the first place , none of the pustules or disease-flecks were very large or well developed .
They were , curiously enough , best on the seedlings provided with water only .
Next best on those with normal mineral solution , and on those with the same devoid of Ca , and ( another curious fact ) in one case on the plants deprived of Mg .
On those deprived of P205 or of K the development was distinctly worse .

On Physics and Physiology These results also accord with the appearance of the plants themselves .
The want of Pi\gt ; 05 results in a long limp growth , and very pale colour , and the attacked spots show corrosion and collapse instead of normal flecks .
Similarly , in plants deprived of K we have pale collapsing patches in place of normal flecks , though the plant is not drawn and etiolated as in the previous case .
Where Mg was wanting the drawing and paleness of the leaves were not so marked , and the fungus flecks in the positive case were more like the normal .
That a want of supplied Ca should have very little effect on either host or parasite , was no doubt due to there being small quantities available in the soil and pots .
The flecks and pustules were apparently normal , though small .
It is not easy to see why the pots with water only yielded plants with flecks as good as , or even better than those with normal solution , unless the concentration of the salts affects the fungus .
However it is probably not to be inferred that in any of these cultures the grass was totally deprived of the given salt\#151 ; it would get traces from the * pots and coir in any case\#151 ; but the effects of deprivation of salts ought certainly to be felt , and I think were so to some extent in lengthening the incubation period .
So far as the results go they suggest that differences in the supply of minerals affects the development of mycelium and of spores owing to effect on the host\#151 ; in cultivating the host we also cultivate the parasite .
But I would insist that these trials with special mineral-supplies are merely preliminary .
The task in hand was far too extensive for the problems to be solved in one season , and I contemplate carrying the whole matter\#151 ; or persuading some one to do so\#151 ; much farther in the future .
Meanwhile , the results give suggestions for further work , and much remains to be done along the lines I have here laid down , as well as in directions yet to be opened out .
