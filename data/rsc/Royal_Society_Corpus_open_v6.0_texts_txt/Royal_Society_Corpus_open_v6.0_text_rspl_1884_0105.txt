It has long been known* that the solubility of calcium sulphate in rater attains a maximum at about 35 ' C. , also that the solubility of his compound is increased by the presence of common salt .
But iccurate determinations of the extent to which the solubility is thus nfluenced have not hitherto been published .
Having the means of intermining solubilities at temperatures above the boiling point of rater , and considering the interest from both a theoretical and practical point of view attaching to these determinations , we undertook the following experiments .
When our work was nearly completed we observed a paper by Professor Lunge on the same subject a the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry for January fast .
We venture to think , however , that our results are still of nterest as being more systematic , and since every experiment was lone with every precaution and very great care , they are probably nore accurate .
The solubilities at temperatures above 100 ' have aever before been determined .
Our former experiments on solubilities at high temperaturesf were made in a gun-metal tube coated with silver , but in the present series of experiments the silver was not found to resist the action of the solutions , and we have therefore employed a tube of platinum .
The , platinum tube is shown in the accompanying figure .
The part A is 87 mm. , B 123 mm. long .
Both are closed at one send , and the open ends are ground to fit the union piece C , which icon tains a small screen d , and has two small holes at e and / .
The internal diameter of the arrangement is 12 mm. When joined together , the three pieces form a compound tube C ' , 245 mm. long .
I The salt and solvent are placed in B , a small strainer of platinum gauze is introduced at g , and the tubes are fitted together .
The 1 whole is then enclosed in the strong gun-metal tube and heated in the paraffin bath as already described ( " Phil. Trans. " ) .
After four or five hours at the desired temperature the solution is drained into A , and after turning the tube so that the screen may arrest the flow of any subsequent drainings into A , the whole is allowed to cool .
The small hole at e allows any drops of liquid that may be stopped by the screen to escape into the outer tube .

l. In the experiments made at lower temperatures the solutions were placed together with excess of pure calcium sulphate in stoppered bottles or flasks , which were immersed in the hath maintained at a constant temperature for at least five hours with constant agitation .
At temperatures above 20 ' a special contrivance was used for filtering off the solution required for analysis without change of temperature or evaporation .
All the materials employed were pure , and filters purified by acid were alone used .
Two series of determinations have been made , the first with a solution containing a fixed proportion of chloride at different temperatures , and the second at constant temperature with a varying strength of solution .
These results are indicated graphically on the accompanying diagram ( fig. 2 ) , from which it will be observed that whilst the solubility of calcium sulphate in water is increased by the addition of chloride of sodium or of ammonium , probably owing to double , decomposition , it is diminished by the presence of chloride of calcium .
It may also be noticed , however , that the form of the curve is nearly the same in 1885 .

An attempt was made to ascertain the influence of magnesium chloride .
A solution was made by dissolving pure anhydrous chloride of magnesium in water , and the calcium sulphate was digested with this solution at known temperatures .

From this it will be seen that whilst the magnesium chloride is rapidly decomposed and precipitated by the water as the temperature is raised , yet the solvent action of the hydrochloric acid which is thus formed in the solution is partly counteracted , probably by the magnesium chloride which remains dissolved , and which may act in the same manner as calcium chloride .

A larger quantity diminishes the solubility .
Calcium chloride added to solution of calcium sulphate causes steady decrease of solubility , till when the proportion amounts to about 50 to 100 water the sulphate is practically insoluble .
These results are very plainly observable in the accompanying curve ( Fig. 3 ) .

" Contributions to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll .
Part I. " By Edward Schunck , F.R.S. Received April 30 , 1885 .
( Abstract .
) The paper treats of the products formed by the action of acids on chlorophyll .
All who have worked with chlorophyll are familiar with the peculiar effects produced in solutions of chlorophyll by the action of acids .
The colour is changed , and an absorption spectrum makes its appearance which differs from that of chlorophyll .
According to some , these changes are due to a simple modification of the chlorophyll , others consider they are caused by the formation of products of decomposition .
The latter view seems the more probable .
On passing a current of hydrochloric acid gas into an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll , a dark green , almost black , precipitate is formed at once .
The greenish-yellow liquid contains substances extracted along with chlorophyll by the alcohol , .and not connected with the latter .
The precipitate consists essentially of two colouring matters , phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin , bodies that had been previously observed and so named by Fremy , who however did not obtain them in a state of purity .
They are best separated by Fremy 's method , which consists in dissolving the mixture in ether and then adding concentrated hydrochloric acid , when the liquid separates into two layers , a lower blue one containing phyllocyanin , and an upper yellowish-green one containing phylloxanthin .
It is immaterial what
