THE famous theory of the parabolic motion of projectiles was at an early period found to give results not in accordance with practice .
Manifestly , then , the air must offer a very sensible resistance to a body which is moving through it with a high velocity .
This resistance will depend upon theforms of the moving body , and upon the velocity with which it is moving .
Hence , before the path of a projectile can be calculated , it will be necessary to determine experimentally the resistance opposed by the air to the motion of the projectile , corresponding to various velocities .
According to NEWTON'S law , the resistance of the air varies as the square of the velocity .
But the velocities were low in the experiments made under his direction .
In 1719 JOHN BERNOULLI gave equations for finding by the method of Quadratures the path &amp;c. of a projectile , when the resistance of the air was supposed to vary according to any power of the velocity .
But in spite of grave doubts respecting the accuracy of NEWTON'S law , it has been adopted by most of the eminent mathematicians who have written on the subject , such as EULER ( 1753 ) , LAMBERT ( 1765 ) , BORDA ( 1769 ) , BEZOUT ( 1789 ) , TEMPELHOF ( 1788-9 ) , D'EIIRENMALM ( 1788 ) , LOMBARD ( 1796 ) , and POISSON .
The first good experiments made with a view to determine the resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles were those of ROBINS in 1742 .
The projectiles used were leaden bullets of small size .
When we consider the great density of the material used , its liability to change its form in the barrel of the gun , and the smallness of the solid projectiles , it is truly wonderful that ROBINS was able to accomplish so much with his ballistic pendulum .
Afterwards HUTTON carried on ROBINS ' system of experimenting both with the whirling machine and ballistic pendulum , introducing additional precautions , and using iron projectiles of greater size .
In recent times MM .
DIDION , MORIN , and PIOBERT have carried on experiments in France with heavier spherical projectiles , by the help of an improved ballistic pendulum ; but they have done little more than confirm the results of ROBINS and HUTTON , and extend them to spherical projectiles of larger diameter .
ROBINS came to the conclusions:- " First , That , till the velocity of the projectile surpasses that of 1100 feet in a second , the resistance may be esteemed to be in the duplicate proportion of the velocity ; and its mean quantity may be taken to be nearly the MWDeCCLXVIII .
3 M same with that I have assigned in the former paper .
Second , That , if the velocity be greater than that of 1100 or 1200 feet in a second , then the absolute quantity of that resistance in these greater velocities will be near three times as great as it should be by a comparison with the smaller velocities"* .
HUTTON remarks in a note on these conclusions:- " These suppositions are not nearly correct .
In fact , by more accurate experiments with cannon-balls , it appears that the law of the resistance begins to increase above the ratio of the square of the velocity , from the very slowest motions , and thence goes on increasing gradually more and more above what is assigned by that ratio , till we arrive at the velocity of 1600 or 1700 feet per second , where it is at the greatest , amounting in that maximum state to only 2--1 times the quantity resulting from the ratio of the square of the velocity .
And at the velocity of 1100 feet , instead of answering to that law , it amounts to 1 86 times the same .
" EULER , in the remarks which accompany his translation of ROBINS ' 'Gunnery , ' states that , the greater the velocity of the shot , so much the more does theory deviate from the trutht .
HUTTON 's formula of resistance consisted of two terms , one varying as the velocity , and the other as the square of the velocity .
In the year 1836 M. PIOBERT reexamined HUTTON'S experiments , and found that the resistance of the air for various velocities was sufficiently well represented by a formula of two terms , one of which varied as the square , and the other as the cube of the velocity .
In 1839 and 1840 numerous experiments were made at Metz , under the direction of a commission , by means of an improved ballistic pendulum .
The projectiles used were spherical solid shot of 24 , 12 , and 8 , or 26-47 lbs. , 13-38 lbs. , and 8'86 lbs. in weight , and 5-85 inches , 4-66 inches , and 4'06 inches in diameter , and a shell 50171 lbs. in weight and 8-67 inches in diameter .
The distances from the gun at which the pendulum was placed were 49 feet , 82 feet , 164 feet , 246 feet , and 328 feet .
The resistance of the air to these projectiles was found to be represented by the formula 7rR'v2x 0027(1+0 0023v)$ ; and the new calculation of HUTTON'S experiments gave sXR2v2X 0-02786(1+0 0023v)$ .
When spherical balls and smooth-bored guns were used , it was only possible to strike the receiver properly when at a moderate distance from the gun ; and thus the variation of velocity to be measured was confined within very narrow limits .
There was also the disadvantage that , as the velocity of the ball had to be reduced to that of the receiver in order to determine the striking velocity of the ball , only one velocity could be measured for each round fired .
It would therefore be quite impossible to employ ROBINS ' ballistic pendulum to find the velocities of the heavy elongated projectiles in use at the present day .

Various attempts have been made to measure the velocities of cannon-balls by the aid of electricity .
The machines with revolving cylinders were in general failures , because their inventors made their success depend upon the known uniform angular ' velocity of the cylinder .
These failures opened the way for the introduction of M'ajor NAVEZ ' electro-ballistic pendulum , and others of the ' same class , which worked with two screens , and therefore furnished no means for testing the probable accuracy of the velocity determined .
The apparent convenience and portability of these instruments led to their general use both in Europe and America .
Maj6r .
NAVEz ' instrument , in its original complicated form , is now out of fashion ; whilst Colonel BENTON'S two-pendulum instrument and Colonel LEURS ' modification of it are in common use , as they are simpler than Major NAvEZ ' instrument , and give results quite as much to be relied upon .
Even if the electro-ballistic pendulum were perfect in itself as a measurer of time , considerable errors might be expected to arise from the imperfections of the indications of two screens placed at moderate distances apart .
A reference to a paper by Major NAVEZ , " Considerations sir les experiences de balistique en ce qui concern la mesure du temps"* , will show how little had been accomplished when that was written ( 1865 ) .
And Colonel BENET has well remarked:- " Electro-ballistic machines heretofore used have been powerless to solve one of the most important problems in ballistics the law of the movement of a projectile through the air , and this because of the limited number of points of the trajectory that could be determined"t .
From preliminary experiments already made , I feel certain that a simpler , cheaper , and better instrument might be substituted with advantage for electro-ballistic pendulums where such instruments can be used .
The time occupied by a body in falling from rest through a given space , or the time occupied by the sound of the explosion in travelling over a given space , might , be made the foundation of the measurement of a velocity ; or the velocity of the shot might be directly compared with the velocity of the sound of the explosion .
In the spring of 1864 , when I was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics to the Advanced Class of Artillery Officers at Woolwich , and Referee of the Ordnance Select Committee , I strongly recommended the construction of a chronograph capable of recording the time occupied by a projectile in passing over nine or more successive equal spaces .
The principle of the chronograph used at the Greenwich Observatory was plainly the -one to be adopted .
The chief difficulties to be overcome were found ( 1 ) in the arrangement of a proper system of screens , so that the ball in passing might merely cause a momentary interruption ( not a rupture ) of the galvanic current , and that the resistance of the circuit might be kept perfecty constant during the experiment , ( 2 ) in the arrangement of a system of marking , which should give definite records on the surface of the cylinder when moving with a velocity of about 10 inches per second , and ( 3 ) in the compensation for the want of uniformity in the angular velocity of the cylinder , The chronograph was completed in the summer of 1865 , and in November and December of the same year it was tried with ten screens , placed at intervals of 120 feet .
Satisfactory records were obtained for eleven out of eighteen rounds of elongated shot fired from a 12-pounder B.L. gun , which very plainly indicated that the resistance of the air varied as the cube of the velocity .
A full account of the chronograph and of the method of using it , accompanied by a detailed statement of the eleven successful rounds , was printed in the Proceedings of the Royal Artillery Institution , Woolwich , for August 1866 , and was also published in a separate form .
At present it will be sufficient to state that the axis of the cylinder is vertical , and in a line with the axis of the horizontal fly-wheel , to which it is attached .
The fly-wheel is spun by hand .
When the gun is ready to be fired , the markers are brought into contact with the paper ; and after the clock has recorded three or four seconds the gun is fired .
The clock is allowed to record three or four seconds more , and then the markers are raised and the experiment is completed .
The friction on the axis of the fly-wheel , the resistance of the air to the motion of the wheel , and the friction of the markers on the paper tend to reduce the angular velocity of the cylinder .
But as the pendulum of a half-seconds ' clock raises a lever once each double swing , it interrupts the clock galvanic current once a second , and thus the clock-records show what spaces have passed under the markers each second .
The changing angular velocity of the cylinder thus becomes accurately known .
For if we commence measuring from some arbitrary point taken two or three seconds before the screen-records , and measure along the spiral traced by the clock marker , noting each record of the clock , and continuing our measurements two or three seconds beyond the screen-records , and if we difference these quantities , we shall find whether the angular velocity has been sufficiently regular in its change during the experiment .
If so , we can by interpolation find what would have been the records if one had been made every tenth of a second .
It has always been found to be sufficient to suppose the angular velocity constant during each tenth of a second , and to calculate smaller intervals of time by proportional parts .
As the clock goes on all day breaking the current once a second , every record of the clock is made under precisely the same circumstances .
If there be a loss of time between the breaking of the current and the making of the corresponding record , the loss of time may always be expected to remain the same for any single experiment , and therefore there can be no error ; for in experiments on gunnery the exact length of a second , only , is required , and not the exact time of the day .
The galvanic current which works the screen-marker is kept constantly circulating through all the screens , excepting during the momentary interruption caused by the breaking or repairing of a screen , or some accidental rupture of the conducting wire .
Although there is no necessity for this arrangement , it is found to be practically convenient .
The ordinary screens used for other instruments are formed of fine copper wire stretched across a frame repeatedly , and through which the galvanic current circulates .
When , then , a shot passes through the screen the current is permanently broken , unless some of the broken wires happen to rest in contact .
But for my chronograph it was necessary to make provision for the breaking and immediate restoration of the current , and that without changing the resistance of the circuit .
The galvanic current passes along the top of each of the ten screens simultaneously .
Equal weights are attached by long pieces of sewing-cotton to certain wire springs which project through holes in sheet copper .
When the shot cuts one or more threads , the corresponding springs are released and fly from the bottom to the top of their holes .
So long as any single spring is not in contact with the side of the hole through which it projects , the current is interrupted .
This kind of screen secures a perfectly constant resistance to the screen galvanic current .
But it has been objected that if the galvanic current circulated about the screen electromagnet for several minutes , which elapse between successive rounds , the loss of time between the breaking of the galvanic current and its corresponding registration would not be equal for all the ten screens .
This error would be the more pernicious because it might be expected tofollow some law , , and therefore could not be eliminated .
The following arrangements have been made partly to meet this difficulty , and partly for the sake of the convenience of keeping up a constant communication between the instrument and the range .
A self-acting contact-breaker and ringer ( figs. 1 &amp; 2 ) is placed by the side of the gun .
Ordinarily the lever ab is down , as in fig. 1 , in which case the galvanic current takes the direct course , abc d. When the lever ab is raised , the current is permanently interrupted , but the insertion of a metallic pmif ( fig. 2 ) opens a passage through the contactbreaker .
e. when all the bells in the circuit are continue cc Fpi74 ' + , ?
C6+ do r I-I l ously rung .
After the screens have been mended the lever ab is raised to try whether the current is good .
If so , it is lowered and the gun is loaded .
When the range is clear and all is ready , the lever ab is raised and the pin f is inserted .
The fly-wheel of the chronograph is now put in motion .
The rapid interruptions of the current by the contact-breaker are recorded on the cylinder , till a pull at the lanyard , to fire the gun , simultaneously withdraws also the pin f , and so shuts out the contact-breaker .
The screen-records often follow so closely that it is difficult , before measurement , to say which is the first screen-record .
Another improvement , represented in fig. 3 , has recently been introduced .
The two ends of the circuit are at A and B , near the chronograph .
When the tmarkers are being raised from the paper S &amp; ezz -~~~~~~~ rC by a lever , the spring I is simultaneously brought into contact with m , which turns the screen-current from the marker to the bell .
Thus every interruption of the screencurrent caused by the repair of the screens is signaled by the bell .
When the bell rings continuously , it is known that the lever ab ( fig. 2 ) is raised ready for firing .
The flywheel is caused to spin , the markers rare brought down upon the paper , and simult.tneously the spring I is brought into contact with n , when the bell is silenced and the marker registers the breaks of the contact-breaker till the pin f is withdrawn and the gun is fired .
The clock is allowed to make a few beats ; and then the markers are raised ; from the paper , and contact is reestablished between I and m. Thus the galvanic current only circulates for eight or ten seconds about the screen electromagnet for each experiment , and the current is always being rapidly interrupted quite up to the firing of the gun ; so that -there is no opportunity for the development of a varying strength of remaining magnetism .
The whole arrangement is found to work so satisfactorily that on one occasion nine rounds ( 23 to 31 ) were fired in forty-five minutes .
After all possible precautions have been taken , it is found that there are small corrections required in order to make the successive records of both clock and screen consistently regular .
The unit of the scale used in measuring is about half an inch , and the scale is read off to two places of decimals , or to the 21of an inch .
The corrections are carried to three places of decimals of the scale .
The final calculations are carried to four places of decimals of a second .
This is done to secure accuracy to the nearest 707J of a second of time , giving an opening for an error of ?
t2F 'of a second of time , or 6 or 8 inches of space , in finding the time occupied by the shot in passing from the first to any succeeding screen .
These corrections of the readings of the scale are rendered necessary because the screens cannot be practically maintained at perfectly equal distances .
The point of the shot may strike fairly upon a thread at one screen , and between two threads at the next screen .
One spring may act more promptly than another .
One stringmay bend more than another before breaking .
These corrections are often merely nominal , but there are some sufficiently large to warn us to beware of trusting implicitly to any measurement of a velocity by two screens only .
Shortly after the publication of the description of my chronograph , my attention was directed to a chronograph with a cylinder , the invention of Captain SCHULTZ* , of the French Artillery , which had been tried in France and America .
The instrument is adapted for making any number of records ; and , like my own , its success does not depend upon the uniformity of rotation of the cylinder .
My instrument makes the clockand screen-records side by side , on glazed paper which covers the cylinder , so that the original records of the experiments can be preserved for future reference .
Captain SCHULTZ makes his records on the slightly smoked metal surface of his cylinder , which are effaced when they have been read off .
Captain SCHULTZ uses a large tuning-fork , usually called a diapason , the vibrations of which are sustained by electro-magnetism , to effect the mechanical division of the second into 250 or more equal intervals .
The diapason , vibrating as the cylinder turns , traces a sinuous spiral line .
The pendulum in swinging interrupts a galvanic circuit once a second , and causes a spark from a Ruhmkorff 's coil to strike the cylinder and make a record .
Thus it is found how many vibrations the diapason makes per second .
The clock is then taken out of the circuit , and the current is made to pass through the Ruhmkorff coil and the first screen .
When the first screen is broken the coil gives a spark and the galvanic current is made to pass through the second screen* .
When the second screen is broken , a recording spark is given by the coil , and the current is passed on to the third screen , and so on to the end .
All the time , the diapason is tracing its sinuous spiral .
Unless a careful system of compensation be provided , this method of working the screens would cause great variation in the resistance of the circuit .
In the arrangement of my screens , I was careful to maintain a constant resistance to the current , which end is secured by making the current pass through all the screens simultaneously , and by providing for it to be interrupted , but not broken .
I am not aware that Captain SCHULTZ ' instrument has been tried with more than two screens ; but Colonel BENET has given a Table showing the number of vibrations per second made by the diapason as determined at the Frankfort Arsenal .
In this Table there are striking variations in the numbers of vibrations made in successive seconds , as in the second trial , extending to twenty-five seconds , we find 249 1 , 252-0 , 249-5 , 248-5 , 246 0 , 249-0 , &amp;c. The result of the trials is stated as if the constancy of the mean number of vibrations per second was all that was required .
This is not the case .
A succession of equal intervals of time must be marked out by the clock , or diapason , so that , when the gun is fired , the time of passing the screens may be noted by the side of a correct scale of time .
Now it would make an important difference in the resulting velocity , if the gun were fired when the diapason was making 252-0 , 248-5 , or 246-0 vibrations per second .
If the vibrations of the diapason be maintained by the vibrations of a second fork which alternately makes and breaks contact , as described by HELMHOLTZt , it is hardly to be expected that the number of vibrations per second can be maintained with sufficient constancy .
There is another question .
The point from which the spark is discharged cannot be allowed to touch the smoked surface of the cylinder ; and it may be asked whether the spark is not liable to deviate in its passage .
After my chronograph had passed its first trial ( in December 1865 ) , it appeared to be desirable to institute experiments with a view to find the resistance of the air to various forms of heads of elongated shot , but such as were likely to be of practical utility .
The proposed experiments received the sanction of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for War , and ten of each kind of the following elongated shot were prepared for the 40-pounder M.L. gun : ( 1 ) Solid .

Rounds 1-13 were fired on the 25th September 1866 .

32-43 , , , , , , 27th September 1866 .
A barge having anchored in the range , there was no opportunity of firing a single round during the whole of the following day , which interfered with the completeness of the experiment with the solid shot .
As a uniform charge of 5 lbs. of powder was used for all the rounds fired , and as the solid were nearly double the weight of the hollow shot , the hollow shot had a much higher initial velocity than the solid .
Hence the hollow shot had also a much higher initial angular velocity than the solid shot ; and it is probable that the initial angular velocity would be preserved nearly unimpaired throughout the observed range .
This is manifested in the greater steadiness of the hollow ogivals .
For the first round , the method of forming the Time-table , and the mode of using it in the calculation of the times of arrival of the shot at each successive screen , are indicated at full length .
For further details I must refer the reader to the published description of the chronograph .
The screens were placed 150 feet apart , which distance is denoted by 1 .
The first screen was 75 feet from the gun .
t denotes the time occupied by the shot in passing from the first screen to a distance s feet , when t= as+bs2 ; and 0 , t2 , t3 , ... t. will denote the time when the shot passes the first , second , third , ... nth screen , or the times corresponding to the particular values 0 , 1 , 21 , ... n-1 1 of s. where 1=150 feet , and the mean value of b12 so determined from each round may be taken to correspond to the mean velocity of that round .
Since the retarding force is f= 24v ' , acting upon an experimental shot of weight W ' lbs. , the resistance of the air measured in pounds and the resistance will always be the same against a shot of the same external form when moving with the velocity v. If W be the weight of a different shot , then the retarding force f '=-2 XW 2 bw v or b varies inversely as the weight of a shot of given external form .
If we vary the diameter of the shot , it is usual to assume that the resistance of the air varies as the square of the diameter for similar forms of heads of shot .
The values of 2b are given below in terms of R , the radius of the shot in feet , and W , its weight in pounds .
But inasmuch as the diameters of shot are generally given in inches , the same values of 2b have been expressed in terms of d , the diameter of the shot in inches .
Unfortunately there are only three successful rounds for each of the solid ogivals , and one value of b12 in each case is manifestly too large .
This must have arisen from unsteadiness of the shot in its flightL If we reject these two , the values of 612 derived from the solid ogivals agree very well with those derived from the hollow shot of the like forms .
For the hemispherical head we have bl2= 00084 for shot of mean weight 39-34 lbs. , and 4*7 inches in diameter .
To find the value of 26 adapted for hemispherical-headed shot of weight W lbs. , and diameter-d inches=2R feet , we have 2 x.00084 / d\~2 / 39.34\ d~lfl~ d2 2b=2 00024 ( 4d ) ( 9W )=-0000001329 W 26 ( 150)2 Xy:i 7 , ,~w or 2 x'00084 ( 24R\ 2 39.34R2 1 ; 50 4M ) w= 000077 RW ) and so on for the rest .

41I R1 QA AAA w wAAAIA Although the motion of a shot may be well represented by supposing a retarding force = -2bv1 to act through a range of 1400 feet , there is reason to suppose that for velocities ranging from 1500 to 900 feet per second the value of b will be less for the lower velocities with equal degrees of steadiness .
It unfortunately happens , however , that the angular velocity imparted to a shot , which most probably remains little changed during the time of flight , depends directly upon the initial velocity of the shot .
Hence , when shot are fired with low initial velocities with a view to determine the value of b for low velocities , the steadiness of the shot is diminished , and therefore there is an increase of the resistance of the air on this account .
The only way to meet the difficulty is to place screens near the gun to find the initial velocity , and others at a distance of 2000 yards or more , and so compare theory and experiment .
It is worthy of notice that if a body move in a straight line under the action of a force varying as the velocity cubed , the mean velocity obtained by dividing space by time is exactly the actual velocity at the middle point of that space .
Thus space 2s 2s 1 =at distance s. time of describing space 2s-2as + 4bs2 aa+2bsvelocity The date of the Report of the above experiments was October 23 , 1866 .
I have long been aware that Major OTTO had made trial of various laws of the resistance of the air in a work published in 1855 .
The law of the cube of the velocity was tried , but without any definite result* .
It was in April 1867 that I first learnt that M. HtLIEt had proposed the law of the cube of the velocity as the law of the resistance of the air to elongated projectiles in a work dated 1865 , which law he had deduced from experiments made at Gavre in 1859 , 1860 , and 1861 4 .
It will be convenient to quote his own statement of the best series of experiments made at Gavre in 1859 , in order to show the nature of the work done , and the perfect independence of my own methods and numerical results .
M. HfIhE used one of the electro-ballistic pendulums to measure his velocities , but he does not state distinctly which it was .

; so that the value of 2b deduced from my own experiments might be expected to be sensibly greater than its value deduced from I.e HEWE'S experiments made with lower velocities .
There are three or four other tabular statements of less complete experiments given by M. HILIE .
In the present state of the question it is impossible to make any more exact comparison of the two systems of experimentingf .

[ An extended series of experiments just completed at Shoeburyness , with 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9-inch elongated shot , has shown conclusively that , although the motion of a shot may be well represented by supposing the resistance of the air to vary as the cube of the velocity , and to be equal to -2bv3 for a range of 1200 or 1300 feet , still
