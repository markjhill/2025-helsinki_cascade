5 partitions of the pyramid are determined in terms of those of the r-gon and r-ace .
Thus the entire first class of r-gonous x-edra is enumerated , without descending to any classification of polyedra according to the rank of their faces and summits .
The enumeration of the second and higher classes will require such classification , which will introduce so vast a complexity as to render the further prosecution of the theory of the polyedra , in the opinion of the author , practically impossible by any method deserving the name of scientific generality .

" Researches on the Cinchona Alkaloids .
" By W. BiRD HIEIAPATII , M.D. Lond. , F.R.S.E. Communicated by Prof. STOKES , Sec. R.S. Received June 19 , 1857 .
( Abstract .
) PART I.-Critical examination of the ordinary methods employed for the discrimination of the Cinchona Alkaloids , viz. Quinine , Quinidin , and Quinicine and Cinchonine , Cinchonidin and Cinchonicine ; together with the optical and chemical characters of their lodo-Sulphates , upon which new methods are founded .
In consequence of the gradually increasing scarcity of the cortex cinchonce calysayce and its chief product quinine , many other barks have been introduced into commerce , which furnish alkaloids having a strong general resemblance in the physical characters of those preparations of them more commonly employed in medicine , but differing widely in medicinal properties and commercial values .
In order to prevent fraudulent adulterations , it has long been highly desirable to have some ready methods of detecting admixtures of these alkaloids and their salts .
The author having discovered several optical salts of these vegetable alkaloids , proposes to make their well-marked optical characters the means of such detection , and in the second part of this paper has fully developed his views upon this ready method of analysis , whilst in the present part he has passed under review the various existing tests for the different cinchona alkaloids , and the results of ' his investigations may be enu-merated under the following conclusions:6 The following different methods of detecting the various cinchona alkaloids have been proposed : To Bouchardat and Pasteur we are indebted for the use of polarized light as a means of discriminating these alkaloids by the rotatory power which they exercise upon its plane .
Liebig employs the difference of their solubility in ether for the same purpose .
Almost all the other tests proposed have for their object only the discovery of quinine .
Professor Stokes employs fluorescence , combined with the peculiar reaction , in respect to this phenomenon , of hydrochloric acid , alkaline chlorides , &amp;c. Brands , the green reaction produced by the successive addition of chlorine and ammonia , whilst Vogel has modified this latter test in several ways .
Pelletier has employed the agency of a stream of chlorine gas , and Marchand uses nascent oxygen , obtained from puce-coloured oxide of lead and sulphuric acid for the discovery of quinine .
Leers first proposed a combination of Liebig 's ether test , with that of Brandes 's chlorine and ammonia reaction , as a means of establishing the purity of cinchonidin ( miscalled by him quinidin , in common with all German chemists ) .
De Vry has advised the employment of hydriodic acid or iodide of potassium in order to discover the quinidin of Pasteur .
Van Heijningen depends on oxalate of ammonia to discriminate quinine from quinidin .
All these different tests the author has examined most critically , and , as far as it is possible to do so , determined the absolute numerical value of each method experimentally with the following results : He first explains MM .
Bouchardat and Pasteur 's researches on these remarkable alkaloids , from which it appeared that quinine and cinchonidin are powerfully laevogyrate , quinidin and cinchonine pre-eminently dextrogyrate , and that quinicine and cinchonicine are only slightly dextrogyrate upon plane-polarized light .
These eminent experimenters determined also with accuracy the amount of these molecular rotations for each alkaloid .
Yet the expensive nature of the apparatus , the complex formula requisite to reduce the observed amount of angular rotation to the normal molecular standard , and 7 the many interfering actions necessary to be guarded against , effectually prevented this from ever becoming a process for general adoption , either among chemists or manufacturers .
Another method of recognizing the presence of quinine is founded on the optical phenomena of fluorescence , which have been investigated by Professor Stokes .
Whilst endeavouring to turn this process to account in the quantitative estimation of quinine by means of excessive dilution , and marking the points at which the various phenomena of " epipolism , " " fluorescence , " and " internal dispersion " vanish , the author arrived at the following extraordinary results ; premising that he employs the term " internal dispersion " to mean the positive , " fluorescence " the comparative , and " epipolism " the superlative degrees of the same optical power : I. Solutions containing 1 grain in 35,000 of either quinine or quinidin of Pasteur , exhibit epipolism and fluorescence ; solutions with 1 grain in somewhat less than 140,000 grains of water are still fluorescent , with slight internal dispersion .
When diluted with from 3 to 10 gallons of water , these alkaloids continue to exhibit internal dispersion .
Solutions of quinicine are only slightly epipolic , and if the change has been perfect , scarcely at all fluorescent , but nevertheless strongly absorptive of rays of high refrangibility .
Cinchonidin also exhibits optical phenomena , but in a much slighter degree ; about -~ith part of that of either quinine or quinidin .
Cinchonine is also fluorescent about -1 oth part of the same alkaloids .
II .
That on mixing fluorescent solutions of quinine , quinidin , or other cinchona alkaloid with the soluble chlorides , although all traces of optical phenomena are lost to the eye , yet the media still possess powerfully absorbent powers on the rays of high refrangibility , and , if sufficiently concentrated , are wholly opaque to them , , without exhibiting any of the phenomena of dispersion , and greatly impede chemical action .
This was proved by three methods of observation:1st .
By introducing vessels containing fluorescent solutions of quinine into other vessels filled with non-fluorescent solutions of the alkaloids , produced by previous admixture with chloride of ammonium , when all optical phenomena disappeared from the inner vessel , 8 2ndly .
By surrounding fluorescent specimens of fluor-spar with these prepared solutions of the alkaloids , when the blue colour in the spar immediately disappeared .
3rdly .
By photography ; employing concentrated solutions of quinine mixed with chloride of ammonium in troughs to intercept the incident light from any object anterior to the camera , when it was found almost impossible to obtain any image upon the sensitive collodion plate , although the intensity of the visible image received on the ground-glass screen did not suffer any apparent diminution .
4thly .
By photographic printing ; troughs containing these solutions obstructed the chemical rays very considerably , thus interfering with the production of a positive picture from the negative , much longer exposure being necessary to produce any chemical effect , III .
That certain reagents do not destroy fluorescence ; others only mask its appearance by their own colour ; whilst some destroy it by neutralizing the excess of acid ; others do so by producing salts which are themselves non-fluorescent media .
Whilst a third class destroy it by really modifying the alkaloid itself .
IV .
That as so many reagents of common occurrence interfere with the manifestation of fluorescence , and as it is also a property common to all the cinchona alkaloids herein described , its appearance becomes no longer of any value as a test for quinine .
V. Brandes 's chlorine and ammonia test will discover 1 grain of either quinine or quinidin in 1 gallon of water , but shows no difference between these alkaloids , except in very concentrated solutions , when there is a precipitate with quinidin , but not with quinine .
Quinicine is also influenced by this test , but less extensively .
VI .
Dr. Vogel 's first modification of this test is of no apparent value ; but by also employing ammonia , the author has found that it will indicate both quinine and quinidin , detecting readily 1 grain of either in a pint , and showing slight evidence with 1 grain in 10,000 grains of water .
There is scarcely any reaction with quinicine .
VII .
Dr. Vogel 's other modifications of Brandes 's test are unimportant , with the exception of the fourth , viz. excess of chlorine , and very little ammonia .
This detects 1 grain in about 2000 grs. of fluid v4ery readily , if excess of acid be avoided at first .
The test , 9 however , is equally indicative of quinidin ; it gives scarcely any perceptible reaction with quinicine .
VIII .
Pelletier 's chlorine gas-test succeeds very well with the free alkaloids , but does not show any indication with their salts .
It is equally capable of detecting quinidin , and gives the same phenomena .
IX .
Marchand 's test is not a delicate reaction .
X. All the foregoing tests , although specially proposed for the discovery of quinine , possess equal powers and show the same appearances with quinidin .
But they have no reaction on cinchonine , cinchonidin , or cinchonicine .
XI .
Van Heijningen 's test by oxalate of ammonia , produces , after some hours , a crystalline oxalate of quinine , when using a fluid containing only 1 grain of alkaloid in 800 grs. of water , and very readily detects immediately 1 part in 350 .
It does not precipitate quinidin or cinchonidin , but it produces a white precipitate in concentrated solutions of cinchonine .
XII .
De Vry 's test for quinidin by hydriodic acid , or iodide of potassium in neutral solutions , produces a well-marked crystalline precipitate as a colourless salt , when one part of the alkaloid is present in 1000 of the fluid ; the crystals , being short hemihedral prisms , are readily recognized ; the neutral hydriodates of cinchonidin are colourless , silky , prismatic needles , and much more soluble .
If to a solution of the sulphate of quinidin in dilute spirit ( - ) we add hydriodic acid , and expose to the'action of light during some days , there is formed the red iodo-sulphate of the author .
The neutral hydriodate of quinine appears as lemon-yellow prisms .
The neutral hydriodate of cinchonine appears as long , thick , colourless prisms , and is very soluble .
XIII .
Liebig 's ether test dissolves quinine , quinicine , and cinchonicine , and therefore does not discriminate between them , as they are all uncrystallizable .
It dissolves also a portion of the quinidin and cinchonidin .
Should the proportions of these alkaloids not exceed the solvent powers of the ether employed , they will not be indi , cated by this test .
When crystallization occurs , the rhombic prisms indicate cinchonidin ; the long slender aciculse , quinidin ; whilst an amorphous powder is demonstrative of cinchonine .
Ether also extracts cinchonidin from cinchonine ; but its sparing solubility in be the .
necessitates the employment of warmth , and a large quantity of ether .
10 XIV .
Leers ' combination of the ether test with that of Brands can readily detect small portions of quinine , quinidin , or quinicine in cinchonine or cinchonidin , especially when used in the manner as modified by the author .
PART II.-On the Optical and Chemical Characters of the Iodo-Sulphates of the Cinchona Alkaloids , Quinine , Quinidin and Quinicin , and Cinchonine , Cinchonidin and Cinchonicine ; together with the Chemical Analysis of many of the Salts , and new methods of discriminating those Alkaloids , founded upon the production of these remarkable compounds , and the recognition of their optical characters .
In the former part of his paper , the author examined the existing tests for discriminating between the various cinchona alkaloids , and pointed out their insufficiency .
In the present part , he shows that the optical characteristics of the iodo-sulphates of the alkaloids quinine and quinidin are sufficiently well marked to render the existence of either one of these alkaloids certain , and that although the iodo-sulphate of cinchonidin is very closely related optically and chemically to the homologous salt of quinine , yet there are sufficient points of dissimilarity to enable us to diagnose between the two ; and , moreover , that the production of this salt is a beautiful means of deciding readily whether cinchonidin is present in specimens of cinchonine or cinchonicine ; all evidence of quinine or its allies having been decided in the negative by the results of the previous tests , as proposed by Brands , Vogel , Pelletier , Leers , or the author .
The cinchonidin of Wittstein has also , by the same method , been proved by the author to be totally different from the cinchonidin of Pasteur .
Acetic acid and chloroform may also be employed for discriminating between cinchonine and cinchonidin .
The chemical characters of all these iodo-salts furnish no means of discrimination , for as a class they all agree in being more or less soluble in spirit , giving a deep sherry-brown solution , from which water precipitates them in an amorphous form , as dark brown , cin .
namon-brown or purplish-brown coloured precipitates ; they are 11 only very slightly soluble in dilute spirit , and scarcely at all in water , ether , turpentine , or chloroform : acetic , dilute sulphuric , or hydrochloric acid have but little action upon them , whilst concentrated hydrochloric or sulphuric acid decomposes them .
Nitric acid rapidly acts upon them , even in the cold , with violent evolution of nitrous acid and production of heat , iodine being oftentimes liberated in the crystalline form .
Alkalies also decompose them .
Sulphuretted hydrogen , soluble sulphides , sulphurous acid and sulphites , together with chlorine-water , instantly decolour their alcoholic solution , with the production of hydriodic acid .
In dilute alcoholic solutions , starch gives immediate evidence of iodine , and nitrate of silver gives a yellowish-white precipitate of iodide of silver , and some organic basic compound which can only be removed by the action of concentrated boiling nitric acid ; this reaction , although commencing at the ordinary temperature , with violent disengagement of nitrous acid vapours , must be perfected by boiling .
Baryta salts exhibit the existence of sulphuric acid , which in all instances is an essential constituent in their formation .
The quinidin and cinchonine salts dissolve with more difficulty , in consequence of their greater thickness and less extent of surface .
Since the author had the honour of communicating his discovery of the optical salt of cinchonidin to the Royal Society ( a preliminary notice of which was published in the 'Proceedings , ' vol. viii .
No. 24 ) , he has ascertained that its primary form is , like that of the quinine salt , that of a right rhombic prism , and usually very thin , but having for its acute angles 43 ?
, and 137 ?
for its obtuse , with the rectangular axes M.T ; T.-o0 - ; POo--- ?
the quantity for pa being variable and very minute .
In a former communication to the Royal Society , published in the ' Proceedings ' ( Feb. 16 , vol. vi .
No. 24 , 1854 ) , the quinine salt was shown to have a primary rhombus , having 65 ?
for the acute , and 115 ?
for the obtuse angles , with the three rettangular axes , thus related:-M- .
; -T ; T-.-0- ; P ; o-OoT* In both salts the optical characters are usually examined through the shortest axis , Pa : in some recent observations on the quinine salt , the author has discovered that it transmits a blood-red beam of plane-polarized light through the axes Ma and Ta and this is also a beam polarized in a plane parallel to that of the axes Ma and T " .

e 13 In the foregoing comparative Chart of the physical properties of the two salts , the axis has been assumed to coincide with a line drawn through the short diagonal of the primary rhombic crystal , which will coincide with the long diameter of the a-prism , and the plane of the breadth of the 3-prism , and is therefore the Ta of the three rectaifgular crystallographic axes .
It has been compiled from the observations of Professors Stokes and HIaidinger and the author .
It appears to form a complete optical description of the two salts , as far as they are at present known .
Whilst in both salts the indicative body-colours , or those due to the more absorbed pencils ( 3 ) , are only to be seen in the thinnest crystals , it is evident that the reflected rays may be seen indifferently in crystals of all thicknesses ; and the author is inclined to believe that the cinchonidin salt possesses even greater tourmaline absorbent powers upon ordinary light , inasmuch as much thinner plates are required in order to obtain the indicative body-colours , -perfect absorption , and therefore total obstruction , being more early arrived at than in the case of the quinine salt .

One other remarkable difference exists between the quinine and cinchonidin salt , which is , that the optical crystals of the last salt , if allowed to remain in the mother-solution with an extess of less than 1 per cent. of sulphuric acid , undergo a transformation , and become long , golden , silky aciculae , radiating in beautiful globose tufts : this salt has some doubly absorbent powers also , but very feeble .
When this salt is attempted to be redissolved in boiling spirit , in order to be recrystallized , it does not re-form , but the optical crystals are then produced ; when the silky crystals are carefully air-dried , they retain their yellow colour , but if exposed over sulphuric acid at 62 ?
Fahr. , or if attempted to be dried at 212 ?

15 If this olive-coloured residue be boiled in dilute spirit , the optical crystals deposit on cooling .

39-474 39-807 , , Consequently the silky salt will be the optical salt+4 atoms of water , which , under the influence of excess of sulphuric acid and prolonged delay at 62 ?
Fahr. , are assimilated by that salt ; and which additional water , on boiling in spirit , is lost , and the optical salt recrystallized on cooling .
If the temperature be not too high at first , the silky crystals may be produced without the appearance of the optical .
And the silky crystals at 212 ?
, or at 62 ?

The results of the analysis of the cinchonidin salt having been so remarkably different from those of the formulae generally adopted for the pure alkaloid , the author was induced to prepare some perfectly pure quinine , taking especial pains to exclude all cinchonidin ; and having from that prepared some iodo-sulphate of quinine , to submit it to equally rigid analysis .
The results are the following : These optical crystals lose 2'49 per cent. water by prolonged drying at 212 ?

Fahr. over sulphuric acid .
From this it appears that the optical salt of quinine differs in chemical atomic numbers merely in the possession of 1 atom less iodine , the cinchonidin salt having 3 , the quinine salt 2 atoms iodine ; but in each case 2 atoms of sulphuric acid , and 5 water , with an organic base of C57 E11 N2 05 common to both .
How this is derived from C40 1I24 N2 0o ill the one case , or C4I0 -24 N2 02 in the other , it is difficult to point out in the present state of the question .
Were these views correct , it might naturally be imagined that the two salts may be mutually convertible .
The author has undertaken numerous experiments with this object in view ; and whilst he has proved that it is possible ( by boiling the quinine salt in spirit surcharged with iodine ) to communicate the golden tint of the reflected ray and the blue tint of the body-colour to the crystals on their re-formation , yet this modified salt retains the crystallographic forms of the true quinine salt ; whilst , by treating the cinchonidin salt by spirit and aqueous sulphurous acid , that salt is modified also , becomes fibrous in character , and assumes the red body-colour of quinine salt , yet is at once to be distinguished from the true quinine salt even by the naked eye alone ; and on redissolving these in spirit , the blue body-coloured salt again recrystallizes with its ordinary golden reflected tint .
The effect of diluted sulphuric acid in converting the cinchonidin salt into the golden silky fibrous variety , is a striking distinguishing characteristic between the two alkaloids .
These facts lead to the conclusion , that the grouping of the constituent molecules in the two salts differs materially ; that closely as the quinine and cinchonidin salts agree amongst themselves , they differ widely from the quinidin and cinchonine compounds .
The quinidin salt , after recrystallization , presents itself as long quadrilateral acicular prisms , having a deep ruby or garnet-red colour , with a bluish-violet or light purplish reflexion-tint ; it is sometimes deposited in thin flat plates , or long , flat , acicular prisms ; these , when thin , transmit a pure yellow colour , but in thicker plates it becomes reddish , with a tinge of brown .
There is scarcely any appearance of double absorption in this salt ; the thicker crystals alone exhibit it , when their usual tint becomes darkened on analysis with a Nichol .
This salt requires 31 parts of boiling spirit , and 121 parts at 62 ?
to dissolve 1 ; water precipitates it as a cinnamon-brown powder .
Its deep marone-coloured large aciculae had a specific gravity of 1'7647 at 62 ? .
These large crystals , exposed whole to a temperature of 2120 , decrepitate afterwards on exposure to the air , but dried at 212 ?
, they do not appear to lose further water after prolonged exposure to the drying bath .
The author having supplied Dr. Sheridan Muspratt with a quantity of this salt , has been most obligingly furnished with the results of his examination ; from which it will be seen that those previously obtained by the author have been confirmed in the most satisfactory manner by that experienced analyst .

The cinchonine salt differs much from all those previously described ; it exists in long , acicular , quadrilateral prisms , of a deep purplish-black colour , like that of elder-berries .
Thin crystals transmit a yellow tint-pure gamboge-yellow when very thin ; soon passing through a deep sherry-brown to a bloodred colour , then a deep port-wine colour , and then becoming opaque .
These crystals reflect a deep steel-blue colour when analysed with a Nichol 's prism , and generally across the short diameter of the prism , which is the analogue of the a-prism of the quinine salt .
The cinchonine salt possesses doubly absorbent powers , much more powerfully so than the quinidin salt , but inferior to all the others ; the body-colour is deep sienna or bistre-brown .

The cinchonine and quinidin salts further agree in containing only 1 atom sulphuric acid , whereas the quinine and cinchonidin salts contain 2 atoms .
These investigations appear to show that the alkaloids in each instance undergo some modification , but not analogous to substitution ; it appears more like a splitting-up into different molecular groups , and a rearrangement of these amongst themselves , as the formulae of the organic bases differ much from those of the original alkaloids .
All these iodo-salts possess double refractive properties .
When the acid sulphates of the mixed alkaloids , quinine , quinidin , cinchonine and cinchonidin , are dissolved in dilute spirit , and the temperature increased to 80 ?
or 120 ?
, treatment with tincture of iodine readily separates the quinine salt first .
Subsequent further treatment in the same manner produces the cinchonidin salt , more or less mixed with the quinine salt .
On still further treatment , the quinidin salt is formed with its well-marked characters .
The cinchonine salt is by far the most soluble in spirit ; and when a large quantity of cinchonine exists , this compound will also appear along with the quinidin salt .
This test is a beautiful and ready method of proving the presence of cinchonidin in cinchonine , which would otherwise be considered pure , Brandes ' test having shown the absence of quinine and quinidin .
In the same way , this test is an easy method of detecting mixtures of quinine and quinidin , the optical characters of the two salts being so well marked , that no difficulties can exist in their discrimination .
It does not offer such facilities for the separation of quinine from cinchonidin ; the two salts go down together , especially if large quantities of cinchonidin exist with mere traces of quinine .
21 For the success of this test , a small portion only is necessary : with quinine and quinidin a-ooth part of a grain has furnished evidence of the two alkaloids ; one grain would be abundant to detect all the alkaloids .
The foregoing method of examination has enabled the author to prove that the substance which Rosengarten , of Philadelphia , called quinidin , was really the cinchonidin of Pasteur , and the details of his cures of fever , therefore , by quinidin are rather to be ascribed to cinchonidin .
The cinchonidin of Wittstein , of Munich , is a totally different alkaloid , giving , with sulphuric acid and iodine , a salt at once to be distinguished by the eye from either of the two iodo-sulphates described , but yet possessing optically doubly absorbent powers .
This salt has a deep orange-yellow colour by transmitted light , merging into sienna-brown in thicker plates , which are generally flat and much imbricated in the method of crystallization , and also derived from a rhombic prism .
The reflected tints are brownisholive , not unlike dead leaves , or brown beech-leaves .
These crystals are more doubly absorbent than either the quinidin or cinchonine salt , but less powerfully optical as tourmalines than the quinine or cinchonidin compounds .
When polarized , they transmit a siennabrown body-colour if moderately thick , and thicker plates are bistrebrown , but when sufficiently thick , they are wholly impervious to plane-polarized light .
The substance was not in sufficient quantity to admit of any analysis .
All the alkaloids were furnished in a most obliging manner by Mr. John Elliott Howard , to whom the author is deeply indebted for them , and thus publicly desires to express his acknowledgments ; many of these various alkaloids having taken more than ordinary trouble in the preparation and purification .
It is well known that quinine and quinidin , under the continued effect of heat and dilute sulphuric acid , undergo a molecular change into quinicine , which M. Pasteur has asserted to be isomeric with the original alkaloids , but hitherto no complete analysis has been made of the metamorphosed alkaloids .
The author has produced an iodo-sulphate of quinicine , but it is no longer a crystalline compound ; it presents itself as a deep bloodcoloured resin , very soluble in spirit and readily precipitated by water from its spirituous solution .
This substance has not yet been submitted to analysis .
During the production of the iodo-sulphate of quinidin a certain portion of the alkaloid becomes converted into quinicine , as may be demonstrated by the production of this resinous compound from the mother-liquid on the addition of further proportions of iodine .
Cinchonine and cinchonidin become converted into cinchonicine by similar treatment , and this amorphous uncrystalline alkaloid also forms a resinous iodo-sulphate ; its colour is deep purple-black , and it deposits itself on spontaneous evaporation of the spirit , or oi the cooling of a highly concentrated spirituous solution , in small drops , highly tenacious at 1000 Fahr. , but becoming solid at 60 ?
Fahr. This compound has , in a fine state of division , a beautiful purplishblue colour , and such a film generally forms around the edge of the vessel in which it is produced .
Cinchonicine appears to be one of the products during the manufacture of the iodo-sulphate of cinchonidin , but there is a much larger production of it during the formation of the cinchonine salt .
From the foregoing reactions , the author appears to be justified in asmserting that eventually it will be found , when we know more of the rational grouping of the constituent atoms of the vegetoalkaloids , that the construction of the formula for the cinchonidin of Pasteur will have a much greater similarity to the arrangement of the molecular groups of quinine than of cinchonine .
And there is also great probability that the grouping of the atoms of cinchonine and the quinidin of Pasteur will be found to present more points of similarity ; but in each case he sees no reason to doubt the existence of more oxygen in the cases of both quinine and quinidin than there is in cinchonine and cinchonidin .
Ie also ventures to suspect that cinchonicine and quinicine will eventually be found to contain more carbon than the original alkaloid , the elements of water probably being separated by the sulphuric acid during the process of formation .
