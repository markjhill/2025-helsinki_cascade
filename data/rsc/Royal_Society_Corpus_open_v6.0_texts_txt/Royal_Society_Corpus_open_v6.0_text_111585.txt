" On the Action of Acids on Glycol .
" By Dr. MAXWELL SIMPSON .
Communicated by Dr. FRANKLAND .
Received March 24 , 1859 .
The glycol employed in the following research was prepared according to Dr. Atkinson 's excellent method * , to whom is due the credit of having first substituted acetate of potash for acetate of silver in its preparation .
Hle was not the first , however , to prepare it from bromide of ethylene , as M. Wurtz has been in the habit of preparing it from that body for the last two years .
The following slight modification of Dr. Atkinson 's method will be found very convenient , particularly when large quantities of glycol are to be prepared .
Instead of heating the materials for forming the monoacetate of glycol in a close vessel , they are heated in a large balloon , connected with a Liebig 's condenser in such a manner as to cause the condensed vapours to flow back into the balloon .
Action of Sulphuric Acid on Glycol-Sulphoglycolate of Baryta .
-Sulphuric acid forms an acid ether with glycol , which gives a soluble salt with baryta .
This compound is readily prepared by exposing a mixture of equivalent quantities of glycol and sulphuric acid ( S2 H208 ) to the temperature of 150 ?
Cent. , diluting with water and neutralizing with carbonate of baryta .
This liquid , on being filtered , and evaporated on a water-bath to the consistence of a syrup , gives on cooling a white solid mass , which is the body in question .
This was pressed between folds of blotting-paper , dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid , and analysed .
The numbers obtained on analysis lead to the formula C4 115 02 S2 04 O , 4 Ba J as will be seen from the following per-centage Table : Theory .

o10 On neutralizing this compound with carbonate of baryta , the basic hydrogen is replaced by one atom of barium .
I propose to call this salt sulphoglycolate of baryta .
It is analogous in composition to the sulphoglycerate of baryta obtained by M. Pelouze .
This salt does not readily crystallize .
It is almost insoluble in ether and in absolute alcohol , but freely soluble in water .
It is somewhat deliquescent .
Exposure to the temperature of 100 ?
Cent. causes slight decomposition .
From its solution in water , sulphuric acid precipitates sulphate of barytes .
Baryta-water occasions no precipitate , at least in the cold ; on heating , however , for some time , it becomes turbid , from the separation of the same salt .
Action of Hydrochloric and Acetic Acids on Glycol-Chloracetine of Glycol.-A mixture of equivalent quantities of glycol and glacial acetic acid was introduced into a long tube and saturated with dry hydrochloric acid .
The tube was then hermetically sealed , and exposed to the temperature of a water-bath for about four hours .
On * Chromate of lead was employed in this analysis .
r ------opening the tube and adding water to its contents , a heavy oil separated , which was well washed with the water , in order to remove any acetic acid or undecomposed glycol it might contain , dried over chloride of calcium , and distilled .
Almost the entire quantity passed over between 144 ?
and 146 ? .
Specimens obtained at different times gave the following numbers on analysis , which lead to the formula C41 , 14 O C041302 3 2 ' Cl C8 48-00 39'18 38-96 38-98 H7 7'00 5-71 6'05 5'99 04 32-00 26-14 -Cl 35-50 28-97 -27-48* 122'50 100-00 I propose to call this body chloracetine of glycol .
It is the intermediate compound between Dutch liquid and diacetate of glycol .
Its formation may be thus explained : C-1 4 4+ 4 HH3 02 02 + HCl C4 H4 } +4HO .
H2 O , + H CA H3 02 C1 Chloracetine of glycol is a colourless liquid , heavier than water , its specific gravity being 1 1783 at 0 ?
Cent. It boils at 145 ?
, distilling without decomposition .
It is not decomposed by cold water , at least not to any great extent ; even boiling water effects its decomposition with difficulty .
Heated with potash , it gives chloride of potassium and acetate of potash .
It is probable that the ether of glycol is also formed in this reaction , or perhaps glycol itself .
This point I have not yet been able to determine .
Chloracetine is isomeric with a compound I obtained a short time ago , by exposing ordinary aldehyde to the action of chloride of acetyle ( CA E 02 C1)t .
This body differs from the chloracetine in its boiling-point , which is about 23 degrees lower , and in being more readily decomposed both by water and potash .
The products formed by the action of potash also establish a difference between these bodies .
Both give chloride of potassium and acetate of potash , but the body from aldehyde gives , in addition , resin of aldehyde ; whereas from chloracetine no resin could be obtained .
Chloracetine has since been prepared by M. Lorenzo in a manner analogous to that by which I prepared its isomer , namely , by treating glycol with chloride of acetyle .
These compounds find their places in two very remarkable series of isomeric bodies , proceeding from ethylene ( olefiant gas ) and ethylidine ( C4 , H ?
) , supposed to be contained in the chloride of ethylidine derived from aldehyde .

I am still studying the action of acids on glycol , and hope soon to be able to communicate further results .
The foregoing experiments were performed in M. Wurtz 's laboratory .
