Magnetic WorTc.\#151 ; The Magnetograph instruments were dismounted in January 1874 for the purpose of thorough examination and readjustment , as was announced in last Report . .
The necessity for this measure is obvious , when it is remembered that the instruments had been in unintermitted action for the period of fifteen years .
The scale-values were accordingly redetermined , and the instruments handed over to Mr. Adie for examination and repair .
They were returned and remounted in May , but have not been set in continuous action as yet , inasmuch as it is intended that the automatic records should be suspended for the entire year , so as to commence a new series of observations with the year 1875 .
The cost of these operations has been \#163 ; 77 10s .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been continued , as usual , by Mr. G. M. Whipple , who also takes charge of the general magnetic work , in which he has had the assistance , for the first part of the year of Mr. Cullum , and latterly of Mr. Power .
As regards the Magnetic Reductions , the Tabulations of Declination have been completed up to the end of 1873 ; and copies of the results to 1872 have been entrusted , for discussion , to the two Sergeants of the Royal Artillery , formerly in Sir E. Sabine 's office at Woolwich , who have been in constant attendance at Kew since Nov. 1871 .
The Tabulations of Inclination and Horizontal Force have not been effected .
Magnetic data have been supplied to Dr. Wijkander , of Stockholm , in connexion with the Swedish Expedition to Spitzbergen , M. Diamilla Muller , of Florence , and Gapt .
Creak , R.N. A Unifilar and Dip-circle have been repaired for use at the Observatory , and another pair of similar instruments have been lent to the Rev. S. J. Perry , F.R.S. , for use at Kerguelen Island , on the Transit of Venus Expedition , as mentioned in last Report .

o Report of the Kew Committee .
Meteorological Work.\#151 ; The several automatic arrangements for recording respectively the Barometer , the Dry- and Wet-Bulb Thermometers , the Anemometer , and the Bain-gauge , have been maintained in constant action under the superintendence of Mr. T. W. Baker , assisted by Mr. Foster and Mr. Figg ; and the daily standard eye-observations for control of the photographic records have been made regularly .
The instrumental traces with hourly tabulated values are sent monthly to the Meteorological Office as in former years .
The Barograms and Thermograms are obtained in duplicate , and one copy is preserved at Few .
As regards the Anemograms and Hyetograms , the copy is obtained by the method of tracing .
In addition to the regular work of Kew as one of the self-recordinJ| Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological Office , the duty of examining and checking the work of all the seven Observatories of the same character has been carried on , in accordance with the method described in the Beport of the British Association for 1869 .
This portion of the work has been performed by Messrs. Cullum , Hawkesworth , and Deane .
A series of investigations have been conducted with the view of testing the degree of accuracy attainable in the tabulation of the Thermograms by the process described , in the British-Association Beport just referred to .
It has been found to be an improvement to set the glass tabulating-scale by means of fiducial lines traced on the Thermograms by photographic means , in preference to setting it , as heretofore , by standard readings .
The great advantage derived from the new method is the discovery of " bagging " whenever it exists in the curves .
Electrometer.\#151 ; The Self-recording Electrometer , which had been taken to Glasgow , for alteration , as described in last Beport , was returned by Mr. M'hite in February , , and was adjusted for action on March 10 .
It has since continued in satisfactory working order .
{ .
Photoheliograph.\#151 ; A necessity for reexamining the measurements of the series of Kew sun-pictures having arisen , they have been retransferred to Kew by Mr. De La Bue , and their reexamination has been undertaken , at his expense , by Mr. Whipple , assisted by Mr. M'Laughlin , who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose .
The eye-observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , have been made daily by Mr. Foster , when possible , as described in the Beport for 1872 , in order , for the present , to maintain the continuity of the Kew record of sun-spots .
Extra Observations.\#151 ; The Committee , at the request of Prof. Boscoe , !
F.B.S. , undertook to test for a year an instrument which he had devised for measuring the chemical intensity of daylight , as described in the ' Proceedings of the Boyal Society , ' vol. xxii .
p. 158 .
The apparatus was completed for trial in September , but a few preliminary experiments showed that it required further adjustment ; so that operations in this Report of the Ktw Committee .
sa direction are suspended for the present , to be resumed as soon as the nstrument is in a satisfactory condition .
The daily record of temperature from Thermometers at different eleva-ions on the Pagoda in the Royal Gardens , Kew , at the expense of the Meteorological Committee , was continued up to August , when it was nterrupted , to be resumed during the winter months .
Verifications.\#151 ; This department of the Observatory has exhibited ncreased activity , especially as regards the verification of Thermometers ind the construction of Standard Thermometers .
The following magnetic instruments have been verified:\#151 ; Constants have been determined for A Unifilar for Prof. J. Clerk Maxwell , F.R.S. " " Prof. Balfour Stewart , F.R.S. " " Bov .

A set of similar instruments has been ordered by Capt. Pujazon for the Marine Observatory of San Fernando , near Cadiz , The part of this work which relates to Meteorology is entrusted to Mr. Baker .
The meteorological instruments which have been verified are as follows :\#151 ; Barometers , Standards ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... " Marine and Station ... ... ... ... ... ... .

1255 In addition , thirty-six Thermometers have been tested at the freezing-point of mercury , and one metallic Thermometer has been tested .
Eighteen Kew Standard Thermometers have been calibrated and divided at Kew .
The following miscellaneous instruments have also been verified:\#151 ; | Rain-gauges ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

66 A Barograph and Thermograph have been verified for Mr. Kingston for the Observatory at Toronto , and the values of the Scales have been determined as far as practicable .
Experiments have been made with a view to the construction of an apparatus devised by Mr. E. G-alton , E.R.S. , for facilitating the verification of thermometers , and also for rendering it possible to extend the range to which the Kew verifications at present apply .
A large stock of filled Thermometer-tubes for the construction of Standards has been laid in , and the tubes have been annealed .
In the last Report mention was made of certain experiments in pro- * gress with respect to the testing of Anemometers , a piece of ground having been rented in the Park for erecting the instruments .
The experience of a few months was sufficient to show that the exposure in the Park was not nearly sufficiently open to afford facilities for testing the instruments at any but very low velocities , and not very : satisfactorily even in such cases .
Application was therefore made to the Secretary of the Crystal Palace Company for permission to employ a rotary machine driven by steam-power , so as to be able to vary the velo- .
cities at pleasure .
Consent having been most freely given , the experiments were commenced , and the instruments tested at various velocities up to about i 30 miles an hour , the highest attainable by the apparatus .
The investi- j gations were interrupted during the summer , and will be resumed on a future occasion .
It is hoped that by this method of artificial rotation , which .
was that employed by Smeaton in his experiments on windmill sails , | more satisfactory results will be attained than it is otherwise possible to j Report of the Kew .85 get .
The expense of these experiments has been defrayed by a vote of the Government-Grant Fund .
The experiments on the vibration of pendulums , which were conducted by Capt. Heaviside , R.E. , in connexion with the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India , as mentioned in the last Report , were completed at the end of May .
The apparatus employed in the experiments , with the exception of the Russian pendulums and their accessories , was , at the request of Prof. G. G. Stokes , F.R.S. , received at Kew for storage .
The apparatus for testing Sextants , which had been temporarily removed in 1873 to afford space for swinging the Russian pendulums , has now been restored .
The entire cost of this restoration and all other expenses connected with these pendulum experiments have been defrayed by the India Office .
The collimators of the Sextant Testing-apparatus have been arranged so as to be illuminated by gas-jets .
Waxed paper for photographic purposes has been supplied to the Meteorological Office ( 3 reams ) , the India Office ( 1 ream ) , the Magnetic Observatory , Toronto ( 4 reams ) , the Central Observatory , St. Petersburg ( 1 ream ) , the Hohe Wart , Vienna ( | ream ) , the Observatory of Don Luiz , Lisbon ( S ream ) .
It has been found necessary to make a change in the arrangements for obtaining waxed paper .
For many years , through the kindness of a firm , the paper waxed at Kew has been hot-pressed at a nominal charge , but it was not found possible to continue this arrangement for an indefinite period .
Waxed paper has now to be purchased , ready-made , at a considerable increase of cost , and the rate at which it is supplied to observatories has been consequently proportionately increased .
Mr. M'Clatchie and Mr. Beazeley , gentlemen holding appointments in the Chinese Customs Departments , and Mr. Steventon , appointed Assistant to the Observatory at Mauritius , have received instruction in the manipulation and methods of testing both Meteorological and Mag-netical instruments , and the management of the photography of the self-recording apparatus .
In the month of September the Superintendent was informed by the President of the Royal Society that that body was prepared to remove the instruments belonging to it , which had been deposited at Kew for storage in Sept. 1851 .
Accordingly , on the 25th of September , they were handed over to Mr. Lad , Optician , who had been commissioned by the Council to receive them .
The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus , such as the Whitworth Lathe and Planing Machine , procured by Grants from either the Government-Grant Fund or the Donation-Fund , for the use of the Kew Observatory , have been kept in thorough order ; and many of them are in constant and the others in occasional use at the Observatory .
Library.\#151 ; In addition to the usual Donations of English and Foreign Report of the Kew Committee .
Scientific Books , a most valuable present , consisting of twenty-four volumes , chiefly astronomical , has been received from the Athenaeum Staff.\#151 ; The Staff employed at Kew are as follows ; \#151 ; Mr. Samuel Jeffrey , Superintendent ; G- .
M. Whipple , B.Sc. , First Assistant ; T.W. Baker , Second Assistant ; J. E. Cullum , J. W. Hawkesworth , J. Foster , F. Figg , A. B. Deane , C. Power , and E. Constable .
Note.\#151 ; In May Mr. Rigby , whose name appeared in the Report for 1873 , resigned , and Mr. Power was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the promotion of some of the Junior Assistants .
Mr. Robert H. Scott , F.R.S. , continues to act as Honorary Secretary to the Committee .
