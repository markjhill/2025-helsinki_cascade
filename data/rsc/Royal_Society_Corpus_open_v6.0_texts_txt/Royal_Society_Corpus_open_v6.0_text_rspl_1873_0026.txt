( Abstract .
) Until lately it was believed that the atmospheric gases dissolved in sea-water could be extracted from it , as from fresh water , by boiling in vacuo .
The merit of the discovery that such is not the case is due to Dr. Jacobsen , of Kiel , who found that , in order to drive out the whole of the carbonic acid , the water must be evaporated almost to dryness , and that no amount of boiling in vacuo will suffice to eliminate it .
Being particularly interested in the matter , I immediately commenced a series of experiments to determine , if possible , the salt or salts to which seawater owes this property .
Preliminary observations satisfied me , in the first place , that sea-water has this property , and , secondly , that solutions of the sulphates of magnesia and of lime possess the same property .
In order to gain more precise information , two series of experiments were made , the one analytical , the other synthetical .
The former consisted in saturating saline solutions with carbonic acid , and then distilling them , the carbonic acid passing in the various fractions being determined ; the latter , in determining the absorption coefficients of two solutions , the one of sulphate of magnesia , the other of sulphate of lime .
First , the analytical series.\#151 ; Before proceeding to saline solutions , distilled water was saturated with carbonic acid and distilled .
The first eighth of the distillate contained abundance , the second a trace , and the remainder no carbonic acid .
It may therefore be assumed , in the experiments which follow , that the carbonic acid held simply in solution by the water passes almost entirely in the first eighth of the distillate , and that whatever passes afterwards has been retained , in some way or other , by the salt in solution .
Experiments were made on solutions of sulphate of magnesia , of su phate of magnesia and chloride of sodium , and of sulphate of lime , to which were added some on sea-water itself .
In every experiment t e quantity of solution operated on was 300 cub. centims. , which vas boiled in a flask connected by a doubly bored cork with a Liebig s denser , which was fitted at its other end , air-tight , into a tubu a e 1874 .
] Carbonic Acid by Saline Solutions .
193 receiver .
To the tubulure was attached a bulbed U-tube , and , by means of an aspirator , air could be constantly sucked through .
The carbonic acid coming off was retained by baryta-water of known strength distributed between the receiver and the U-tube ; what remained unneu-tralized was determined by oxalic acid , the point of neutralization being indicated by rosolic acid .
The oxalic acid was rather stronger than tenth normal ; it contained 6*478 'grammes C2H204+2H80 in the litre .
One litre baryta-water required 3235 cub. centims. oxalic acid for neutralization .
The method of conducting the operation was as follows:\#151 ; Carbonic acid was passed through the solution until it could be assumed to be saturated .
The object being to determine the carbonic acid retained by the salt , it was necessary to get rid , as much as possible , of the simply dissolved gas .
This was effected by drawing six or seven litres of air through the solution cold , then heating it to boiling , and allowing it to boil for a couple of minutes in a current of air .
The receiver , with the baryta solution , was then attached , and the distillation continued in a current of air , until the contents of the flask were nearly dry .
The amount of carbonic acid was given by the remaining alkalinity of the baryta-water .
Experiments on sulphate-of-magnesia solution , containing 12*3 grammes crystallized salt per litre.\#151 ; As all were conducted in precisely the same way , it will be sufficient to give the results in a tabular form .
The first three experiments were made with one and the same solution ; for the last two a fresh solution , prepared , to all appearance , in exactly the same way as the previous one , was used .
The difference in the results shows the precarious nature of the combination .

Although the mixture was allowed to stand over night , shut off from the influence of the atmosphere , the solution was still very acid .
It is well known that carbonate of magnesia is difficultly soluble in cold dilute acids .
To have heated the solution would have frustrated the object of the experiment , which was , by bringing nascent sulphate of magnesia together with 194 Mr. J. Y. Buchanan on the Absorption of [ Feb. 19 , nascent carbonic acid at ordinary temperatures , to give them the best opportunity of combining .
Two experiments were made with a similarly prepared solution of sulphate of lime .
In this case sulphuric acid was added to the water in quantity sufficient to form , with lime , more salt than would dissolve in the liquid .
Here neutralization took place without difficulty ; and , as might have been expected , the amount of carbonic acid found was considerably greater than in the case of the magnesia salt .
Two experiments were made with an ordinary sulphate-of-magnesia solution , containing 2'05 grammes crystallized salt per litre .
Two further experiments were made with a solution containing 2-05 grammes sulphate of magnesia and 20 grammes chloride of sodium per litre .
All were conducted in the way described above , and the results are given in the following Table .
The experiments with the carbonates of magnesia and of lime were made at a considerably later date than the others ; the value of 10 cub. centims. baryta-water had in consequence become equivalent to 32-0 cub. centims. instead of 32-34 cub. centims. oxalic acid:\#151 ; Nature of solution .

] Carbonic Acid by Saline Solutions .
195 From the large amount of organic matter poured into the Forth in the neighbourhood of Portobello , there must be an abundant production of carbonic acid in the water itself ; and we have seen above the effect of bringing it together in the nascent state with sulphate of lime .
Seawater contains on an average about 8 parts sulphate of lime in 10,000 .
A saturated solution of the same salt in distilled water contains , at 15 ' C. , 24 parts in 10,000 .
Under the most favourable circumstances , then , sea-water might be expected to bind about one third of the quantity-retained by an equal volume of saturated gypsum solution .
We have seen that a litre of this solution is capable of retaining 0*338 grm. C02 , while the same volume of sea-water contained at the most only 0*07 grm. , or very little more than one fifth of that held by the sulphate of lime .
In ocean-water I have never yet found more than 0*064 grm. C02 per litre , including both simply dissolved and half bound .
We have , then , in the sulphate of lime alone an agent capable of retaining much more carbonic acid than is usually found to exist in sea-water ; and there is besides the sulphate of magnesia ; so that whatever may be the function of the other salts , we do not , in order to find a vera causa for the phenomenon under consideration , require to go beyond the sulphates ; and the practical lesson to be learned is that , if we get quit of the sulphates , the carbonic acid will be more easily disengaged by heat .
This is entirely borne out by experiment .
In determining the carbonic acid in sea-water , I always add to it a sufficient quantity of a saturated solution of chloride of barium ; and I find that , after about the first fifth of the distillate has passed , there is rarely a perceptible turbidity in fresh baryta-water .
The synthetical experiment consisted in determining directly the coefficients of absorption of a 1*23 per cent , solution of crystallized sulphate of magnesia and of a 0*205 per cent , solution of Ca S04 + 2H20 .
In Table I. the results of experiments on the magnesia solution are given , where the observations were made without loss of time .
In Table II .
the results of experiments on the same solution are given , only here the duration of the reaction was taken into account .
The first reading was made at the highest pressure after the gas and solution had been together for nine days ; the pressure was then successively reduced , and the other readings made at intervals of twenty-two , forty-one , and twenty-five hours from each other , the last of all being made only after the lapse of some days .
Table IXT .
gives the results of experiments on the gypsum solution , the readings in this case being made without allowing much time for the reaction to take place .

If , however , the gas and solution are left in contact for a considerable time , the difference between the coefficients of water and of the salt solution becomes very marked , that of the latter being less for high pressures and greater for low ones than that of water .
The details of these experiments will be found elsewhere in a more extended paper .

The interest in such compound curves lies in the fact that as a simple harmonic curve may be considered to be the curve of pressure on the tympanic membrane when the ear is in the neighbourhood of a vibrating body producing a simple tone , so a curve compounded of two such simple harmonic curves will be the curve of pressure for the consonance of the two tones which they severally represent , and thus the effect on the ear of different consonances can be distinctly represented to the eye .
If the motion of a point be compounded of rectilinear harmonic vibrations and of uniform motion in a straight line at right angles to the direction of those vibrations , the point will describe a simple harmonic curve . . .

i Thus a pencil-point performing such vibrations upon a sheet of paper moving uniformly at right angles to their direction would draw such a curve . .
.i .The same kind of curve would also be drawn by keeping the pencil fixed and by giving to the paper , in addition to its continuous transverse motion , a vibratory motion similar and parallel to that which the pencil had ; and if the motion of the latter be now restored , a complicated curve will be produced whose form will depend on the ratio of the num
