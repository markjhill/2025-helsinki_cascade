The influence of Tropical Climates on the Kidneys and .
None of the organs of the body are more visibly affected by great changes of climate than these , and their secretions , the urine and perspiration .
As with the lungs + and other internal viscera , the congestion of the kidneys lessens , while that of the skin increases , when the blood is attracted to the surface by heat .
The reverse happens when it is driven inward by cold .
This involves their special and vicarious , waste-product and water-excreting functions alike .
In the tropics the skin doubtless excretes much of the water thrown off by the kidneys and lungs in colder regions , as well as the nitrogen and carbon of the former , and carbonic acid of the latter .
The elimination of surplus water , one of the most important uses of all of the four great depurating organs , is largely effected by these two .
Their intimate relation in this office in cold latitudes is already known .
We shall here attempt to show what it is in the tropics .

During 24 days , from Plymouth to the thermal Equator , drink ( tea or coffee ) being limited to 39 oz. daily , the urine gradually decreased from 39 to 30 oz. , which merely proved that in semitropical , as in temperate climates , free fluid is chiefly thrown off by the kidneys , and that this diminishes as the heat increases .
The following Table gives the results of the two subsequent days , while passing through the equatorial doldrums or greatest heat , the drink being suddenly increased to 88 oz. daily:\#151 ; Takle I.\#151 ; To show the Urine excreted at .

J Si July 15 16# 13 21 8 37# 10* Thus nearly 37 oz. were excreted by the kidneys , leaving 51 oz. to be accounted for .
Now the bile is scarcely if at all increased in the tropics , so that the liver gives little aid .
Dalton* gives -fa of the drink as the average thrown off in this form and by the bowels in temperate latitudes .
, Taking this for the tropics also , allowing a little increase for bile , we have 4*4 oz. And reducing the water exhaled by the lungs in the temperate zone ( which , according to Dalton , is 5 of the drink or 22 oz. ) by the same ratio as the respired air , viz. 11 per cent , or 2*42 oz. , we have 19'58 oz. as that for the tropics .
The sum of these two is 23*98 oz. Then the 51 oz. not thrown off by the kidneys \#151 ; 23*98 oz. excreted by the lungs and bowels gives 27*02 oz. for the skin to exhale .
So that the 88 oz. free fluid were got rid of thus:\#151 ; Urine 37 oz. , skin 27*02 oz. , lungs 19*58 oz. , faeces 4*4 oz. Had the water in the solid ingesta been reckoned , a difficult matter on shipboard , the experiment would have been more satisfactory .
But this gives a fair approximation , inasmuch as any excess from this source would only have- gone to increase the perspiration .
The relative excretion of free fluid by the skin , kidneys , lungs , and bowels , thus , differs in temperate- and tropical latitudes , as they doubtless do in arctic regions ( Table II .
) .

The kidneys are thus the chief eliminators of surplus water in the tropics as in temperate regions ; but in the former it is the skin , as in the latter it is the lungs that rank next .
If suddenly stressed , however , by excessive imbibition , and the safety-valve action of the kidneys or skin be brought into play , these proportions doubtless differ .
Will they hold good for permanent residents in the tropics , foreign or native ?
The increased perspiration in the tropics or in artificial heat , and diminished urinary and pulmonic water-excretion by 22 per cent. , is equal to a proportionate increase in the cutaneous circulation and corresponding withdrawal of blood from the kidneys to the extent of 17 S per cent. , and lungs of 4| per cent. Moreover this diminished exhalation of watery vapour from the lungs , by vicarious action of the skin , still further decreases the amount of blood circulating through them , already shown to be reduced by 12*24 per cent. , or 16*62 fl. oz. by a diminished excretion of carbonf .
The total decrease in the lung circulation is thus 16*62 fl. oz. + 6*42 , , ( 4*72 per cent. ) = 23*04 fl. oz. as the total permanent withdrawal of blood from the lungs by an average temp , of 80\#151 ; 83 ' F. These facts appear highly interesting in the etiology of these and other important internal and external organs , as well as hygienically and therapeutically suggestive .

The decrease in the latter , as well as in the fluid , is due partly to the reduced ingesta , and partly to the vicarious action of other organs , especially the skin and liver and 1871 .

doubtless involves not only the urea and chloride of sodium* , but all of its ordinary ingredients .
Both would be far more regular if the system could be kept day by day in strictly similar conditions as to exercise , clothing , draughts , food , and especially drink\#151 ; a difficult matter at sea , though possible on shore .
So that by limiting the drink and increasing it only as thirst prompted , the quantity of urine would keep at a uniform and perhaps healthier standard .
The individually different quantities necessary to accomplish this may be easily ascertained .
Thus , allowing 25 oz. free fluid to be what my system requires daily in the average temperature of London ( 50 ' F. ) , the addition of 1 fl. oz. for every degree above , or its deduction for every degree below that , would keep the urine pretty equable , even though its specific gravity and solids might alter ( Table IV .
) .

) to Vancouver ( lat. 48 ' N. ) , when the drink was not kept uniform throughout as in Table III .

oz. 36 45-3 44*3 Here both the quantity and specific gravity increased somewhat ; so that the urine is perhaps not so often or much diminished in the tropics as usually believed .
It is so when the drink is stinted , and when , though ample , it is not increased and decreased with the temperature ( Table III .
) ; but when this is done it remains pretty uniform ( Table V. ) , as it often does even when taken in excess .
It is not so much the nephritic as the cutaneous secretion which alters with variations in the amount of drink in the tropics , and in temperate climates the reverse .
The functionally excited skin acts as a * Dr. Forbes Watson and Becker , as quoted in Parkes'e ' Practical Hygiene .
' 300 Dr. A. Rattray on the Effects of [ Feb. 16 , safety-valve for the kidneys in warm , as the latter do for the former in colder ones .
While the perspiration depends much on the temperature , the urine is most influenced by the drink .
Although heat , or its absence ( cold ) , is thus the chief agent in causing these fluctuations , the humidity , velocity , \amp ; c. of the air are not altogether negative .
The first acts by stimulating or checking the sudatory glands , and all three by favouring or opposing evaporation .
Frequent change of climate tends to develope the ordinary and safety-valv.e range of action in both organs .
In these facts lie several important hygienic and therapeutic indications for the tropics , with a view to prevent or lessen distressing hypersemia of the skin and excessive perspiration , both the result of undue imbibition , and the latter highly dangerous when suddenly checked , and a frequent cause of disease .
By them the reason of the eflicacy of tropical , and especially subtropical climates in the prevention when imminent , and cure or relief when actually present , of many diseases of internal organs , not of the abdomen alone , but of thoracic ones , is explained .
The sanatory haematic and secretive derivative action of natural ( tropical ) and artificial heat has been already pointed out with regard to the lungs* .
Might not the practical physician more frequently act on this hint as to the means and extent by which both the circulation and the function of diseased or over-taxed internal organs may be relieved by thus transferring their blood-current and secretion to sounder ones ?
Is not this great and general law of a derivation of blood from internal to external organs under heat , and the reverse under cold , the soundest and most philosophical basis on which to erect a new , safe , satisfactory , and permanent system of therapeutics and hygienics ?
V. The Influence.of Tropical Climates on the Weight and Strength .
Besides the already discussed functional , vascular , and other changes in the lungs , skin , kidneys , and other organs of vegetable life , which follow a transition from temperate to tropical climates , various phenomena affecting those of animal life are also common\#151 ; e. g. languor of body and brain , and generally a loss of weight .
More tardy and less evident , but equally worth study , these are not due , like the former , to the general diversion ?
_in the blood-current from internal to external parts , but to changes in the blood itself and the tissues which it nourishes , to be hereafter investigated .
Occasionally an individual fattens on going to the tropics , and , instead of losing , gains health and strength .
Again , a corpulent person may decrease considerably in weight , while his health , so far from impairing , actually improves .
But such cases are exceptional , and , doubtless , consist merely in vitally unimportant fluctuations in the adipose tissue ; and as a rule the issue includes a loss in both respects , which , if not disease , is closely allied to it .
An opposite result usually follows a contrary change of climate .

301 The following experiments to illustrate this were made in H.M.S. * Salamander , ' during a voyage of five months to , and a subsequent stay of three years on the east coast of Australia , while making triannual trips between Sydney ( lat. 34 ' ) and Cape York , Torres Strait ( lat. 10^ ' S. ) , a distance of 1700 miles in a nearly north and south direction .

Their faulty diet , however , unmodified for temperature , and containing salt meat and other hurtful articles , was an unavoidable disadvantage .
Fortunately this enables us to observe the effect of an agency far more under control for modification or removal than climate .

Lime-juice was given ; but the 36 days of salt meat doubtless added to these results ; and to make the experiment thoroughly satisfactory , fresh meat should alone be issued\#151 ; almost an impossibility in the present transition state of naval dieting .
Still the event is sufficiently decisive to prove the prejudicial influence of tropical climates on the physique , at all ages .
Of 15 officers and men subsequently tested after 17 days more prolonged and direct solar exposure , but with a larger allowance of fresh ( preserved ) meat , 11 had lost from 1 to 9 lbs. ( average 3-^ ) , 1 being unchanged , while 3 had gained , Of the latter , one was a black ( and therefore in his native climate ) , who increased 1 lb. , the other two being healthy boys who gained 1 and 2 lb. respectively .
This shows that the wasting effect of tropical weather in the adult white is not preventible even by a iudicious regimen .

, the record of another trip to Torres Strait , also during the S.E. monsoon , shows that the body is still further affected when a third injurious influence , viz. hard subsolar work , is added to tljese .
Thus , of 103 weighed , 1 per cent , lost flesh to an average of 7 lb. nearly ; the number of boys and young men being large , because most employed , although the average individual loss was greatest among the seniors\#151 ; thus 6 lb. , 7 lb. , and 9 lb. under 25 , 35 , and 45 respectively .
This did not arise from a reduced diet ; for the daily average consumption at the end of the period , when thus losing , had increased by 3^ oz. per man .
A contrast of Tables iy .
and V. further shows that season 'materially influences this reduction in weight .
Table IV .
gives the results of 46 days during the cool dry S.E. monsoon ( aver .
temp. 82 ' F. ) , which lasts for 9 months ; and Table V. of 54 days during the sultry rainy N.W. monsoon ( aver .
temp. 87 ' F. ) , an exaggerated form of tropical weather related to the other as are the winter and summer in temperate latitudes .
While the number who lost flesh during the dry season was 44 per cent. , it was 76 per cent , during the wet monsoon .
The small per centage of gain eveh among the strong and vigorous juniors in the wet season , viz. 10 and 14^ per cent. , is worthy of contrast with that of the dry season , viz. 59^ and 43^ per cent. , as it shows that even the healthiest age cannot long withstand the emaciating influence of the worst season of the tropical year .

) and low percentage of gain , 2^ lb. , during the wet , contrasted with that of the dry monsoon ( 31b. .
and 4^ lb. ) , which equally affects all ages , further illustrates this .
The in*304 Dr. A. Rattray on the Effects of [ Feb. 16 , creased ingesta towards the end of both experiments could not prevent these results ; nor is the difference between the two seasons ascribable to a material dissimilarity in the quantity of the food .

, in strong contrast to the above , shows how much and rapidly the system rebounds under an opposite change of climate , and when removed from excessive warmth info a healthy temperate climate , with a fresh meat and vegetable diet , light work , frequent leave , \amp ; e. Thus after a 54 days ' stay at Sydney in spring , notwithstanding the debilitating effect of 35 salt meat days before and after the experiment , no fewer than 90 per cent , had either gained flesh or lost nothing , the average gain being large ( 6 lbs. ) .
In the 9| per cent , who lost , this was probably due , as it occurred among the juniors , to those excesses so common after long confinement on board .
Thus , during the three years over which these triannual trips from Sydney to Cape York extended , the weight of the crew was continually oscillating , increasing at the former , and again decreasing on returning to the tropics .
Frequent , sudden , and great changes of temperature and climate like this , are doubtless fertile causes in undermining the constitution and inducing premature old age .
But for the re-invigorating influence of the periodic return to cool weather , many more would have succumbed to broken health .
As it is , Table VII .
shows that after years 44 per cent , of those who originally went out in the ship had lost flesh , while other evidence showed that the health and strength of all had declined , there being moreover no proof of the occurrence in any of that doubtful event , acclimatization .
The appetite and consumption of food had also diminished from the same cause .

shows that after a 55 days ' passage from the cool climate of -England across the equator to the south temperate zone , 65 per cent , of the crew had lost flesh to an average of 7 lb. nearly\#151 ; the juniors suffering , though not so much as the seniors .
An increased sick-list at the close corresponds to this .
These results were not due to a decrease in the ingesta , as the daily consumption during the last averaged 6 oz. more than during the first week .
The cause was therefore partly climatic and partly dietetic , salt meat being issued most of the time .

106=80*30 per cent. 308 Dr. A. Rattray on the Effects of [ Feb. 16 , Very different was the effect of the 44 days ' continuation of the voyage to Sydney along the 40th parallel of south latitude , after a health-infusing stay of fifteen days at Simons Ray ( Table X. ) .
Although the usual sea dietary was continued , the exit from the tropics was an evident relief to the system , which , but for the diet , would have retained its vigour throughout .
As it was , only 26 , =19*69 per cent. , lost flesh slightly .
All the boys , who had the strong vital resilience of youth in their favour , gained in weight , and also the younger men , while the seniors lost .
An increase in the ingesta of 7 drams daily towards the end of the period is too trivial to have influenced these results .
This shows how long the system will ward off the scorbutic diathesis when opposed by no other serious adverse agency , provided lime-juice is given as a prophylactic .
The increased sick-list and intensity of the ailments , however , towards the end of the period , show that the immunity was passing off .
The difference in the percentage of those who lost flesh in this and the former part of the voyage ( Table IX .
) , is evidently the effect of climate , and indirectly confirms Tables I. and II .
To the bracing effect of the S. temperate zone we must chiefly ascribe the recovery of the crew .
Wasted while crossing the equator , only 29 per cent , were below their original weight in England on arrival at Sydney .
This loss , though evident among the juniors , was chiefly among the adults and older men ( Table XI .
) .
The superior health and efficiency of a crew in cool climates is an evident indication in planning long voyages .
And we have only to recollect the position and direction of the chief winds and ocean-currents usually followed , to see how much these favour the maintenance of health as well as rapidity of progress .

The passage to Cape York , however , again increased the general symptoms of an impaired physique ( Table XII .

36=35 per cent. Thus , though 55 days in all were spent at Madeira , Simons Bay , Sydney , and Brisbane , on a health-giving fresh meat and vegetable diet ( see Table YI ) , and lime-juice freely given , the monotony and confinement of 175 days at sea , with 156 salt-meat days , a double exposure to the tropics , and frequent changes of temperature , had increased the number who had lost weight since leaving England to 65 per cent.\#151 ; a decided index of failing health and near approach to disease , and perhaps the scorbutic climax .
Similar fluctuations in weight , subsequently observed in the larger crew of H.M.S. 'Bristol ' during a voyage of 88 days from England to Bahia ( lat. 11 ' S. ) and back , are equally interesting and instructive ( Table XIII ) .
Thus the warm weather and salt-meat diet of the first 57 days caused 85 per cent , to lose weight , which rose to 88 per cent , as the time lengthened to 88 days .
The return to the north temperate zone , however , speedily reduced this to 47 per cent. As the diet was the same , the latter event must have been purely climatic\#151 ; an opinion confirmed by the subsequent effect of 28 days ' harbour-life in England , when the number who lost went down to 10-7 per cent. , no fewer than 89 per cent , regaining flesh and more than making up for the previous loss .

Thus 85 per cent , of the men lost flesh during the first 57 days , but only 56 per cent , of the boys , and 58 per cent , of the cadets .
Again , during the first 88 days the percentages were\#151 ; men 88 , boys 60 , cadets 65 .
Further , while 53 per cent , of the men began to recover weight on reentering cool weather , 73 per cent , of the boys and 58 per cent , of the cadets did the same .
Lastly , in England , while 89 per cent , of the men gained , among the boys we find 90| per cent. , and among the cadets 100 per cent. The advanced age , greater strength , and rougher early life of the boys enabled them to bear the voyage better , and recover sooner under genial agencies than the younger delicately-reared cadets .
On the other hand , a generous diet and better regulated life caused the latter to increase more in England .
Under favourable conditions , as to climate , diet , \amp ; c. , the weight of men , and particularly boys , should not fluctuate thus .
Nor can such changes be salutary .
As a rule adults , with fully developed frames , should remain pretty stationary in weight .
Boys , however , should increase not only in weight , but in height and breadth of chest .
For the former to emaciate , or the latter to grow taller and broader , while the weight remains the same or lessens , is a sure sign of present or impending mischief .
The average of l\#163 ; lb. per week by which these cadets increased at home , may be considered the healthy rate of growth for boys of their age .
And we may give Table XV .
to show the effect of subsequent longer leave in England on the physique of a larger number of cadets .

Thus , of 52 cadets , 93 per cent , either did not lose or gained flesh to the average of 1 lb. per week , while 63 per cent , increased in height , and no doubt in capacity of chest ; but the time was too short to obtain satisfactory results as to this .
Obviously , therefore , if cadets are long subjected to influences which retard their growth , even if disease does not ensue , their future strength , both of body and brain , is apt to be impaired ; while ship 's boys and young seamen are not likely to become physical athletes , nor adults to retain their vigour as fighting men .
These conclusions necessarily apply to all similarly situated .
Dr. A. Rattray the Effects of [ Feb. 16 , If we can isolate the effects of tropical weather so as to contrast them with those of other health-impairing agencies , it will be both interesting and practically useful .

Life under the healthiest conditions , in which the highest gain ( 90| per cent. ) and lowest loss ( 9S per cent. ) occurs , is first given as a standard for comparison and index of what should be aimed at in all latitudes and circumstances .

Thus fewest emaciate when the influences are altogether genial , viz. 9*64 per cent. An injurious diet raises this to 19*69 percent .
Under tropical climate it rises to 64*71 .
Under the latter and salt meat combined , it again rises to 65*22 per cent. , and in the rainy season to 76*34 per cent. When , besides this , hard work is undergone , it mounts to 91*26 per cent. The average gain and loss columns show a similar though less regular increase and decrease .
Tropical climate is thus by far the most injurious influence ; and its effects are materially aggravated by other adverse agencies .
[ And the Tables show that these facts apply to the junior as well as the senior ages , though occasionally more apparent in the latter.\#151 ; Feb. 27 .
] We must know the nature of these universal and marked changes in the weight , and the tissues involved , before we can decide whether they aie physiological or pathological , and , if the latter , satisfactorily direct our hygienic or therapeutic efforts to prevent or remedy them .

which carry on the functions of animal life being most affected , especially such as form the great bulk of the body .
It would be difficult to say whether the watery part of the blood and body generally is reduced by excessive perspiration .
The osseous system and thoracic and abdominal viscera are probably little changed .
The fibrous and gelatinous are perhaps more altered ; but it would be difficult to separate this from the change in the fatty muscular and nervous tissues , the three doubtless most of all affected .
In warm latitudes less fat is required than in cold ones to keep out cold and generate internal heat or muscular force .
Hence nature uses it up in its vital processes , and thus first gets rid of what does not itself play a vital part in the human economy , or materially influence health by its removal , and would only prove an encumbrance .
The prevalent languor of body and mind no doubt arise partly from diminished energy in the nervous and muscular tissues ; but are they not also , and perhaps principally , due to a decrease in their bulk , similar to that in other tissues ?
Strength is the manifestation of muscle acted on by nervous influence ; and , from several experiments made on the officers and crew of H.M.S. 'Bristol , ' strength decreases and increases with the foregoing changes in weight\#151 ; a fact which goes far to prove that though loss of strength may be partly of nervous origin , the muscular tissue is also largely involved in its production , and is probably both physiologically weakened and physically altered in texture* .
The cause of this reduction in weight in the tropics is threefold:\#151 ; first , a diminished necessity for surplus fat , which becomes absorbed ; second , that peculiar and not easily explained physiological effect of heat , which causes the tissues to decay faster than in cold latitudes ; third , diminished lung-work and blood-oxygenation , and thereby an imperfect renew'al of tissue .
On the other hand , the languor and weakness are due , first , to loss and relaxation of the muscular substance ; second , to a similar loss of nervous tone and matter ; third , to suboxidation of the blood")* , which impairs the activity not only of the muscles , but of the nerve-centres which originate , and nerve-cords which transmit motor and sensory impressions ; [ and , fourthly , in their early stage , to a reduced supply of their vital stimulant the blood , diverted from the internally situated nerve centres , nerves , and muscles , to the cutaneous surface.\#151 ; Feb. 27 .
] The early and primary results of tropical warmth on the tissues are probably chiefly physical and quantitative ; but when prolonged , especially if conjoined with an erroneous diet , their composition is affected , and they are also chemical and qualitative .
What are the true bearings and diagnostic value of this closely-allied loss of weight and strength ?
Are they solely physiological ?
or when do they become pathological ?
Do they always , or at what stage do they indicate * These data were scarcely ample enough for tabulation .
The ship 's motion , imperfect testing apparatus , and difficulty of finding one equally suited for all men , in whom the best-developed sets of muscles often differ , make this a troublesome inquiry .

2 B 314 Dr. A. Rattray on the Effects of [ Feb. 16 , a loss of vitality or health ?
If decreased weight originates merely in an absorption of fatty tissue , and no strength is lost , the result is at least not unhealthy .
But when other tissues are involved ( and it would be difficult to decide when they are , as this doubtless varies even in the same individual ) , it is then , if not disease , closely allied to it\#151 ; and certainly an indication of an impaired and debilitated physique , prone to succumb to other morbific agencies , and ultimately to induce premature decay and old age .
Physiological in their earlier stage , they soon become of doubtful nature , and finally decidedly pathological .
And that there is a special and not merely a general relation between these phenomena and the health appears , first , from the results being so marked , uniform , and generally prevalent ; second , from concurrent indications of debility , shown by a progressive increase in the amount and severity of sickness ; and , third , by a marked decrease in the loss of weight and strength in the tropics , when some of the agencies which indirectly augment its influence are removed , as will be proved by the following Table , which shows the effect of an improved diet .
During a similar voyage from England to the South Atlantic , in two of Her Majesty 's ships , both crews were subjected to a corresponding amount of tropical weather ; but the number of salt-meat days in H.M.S. * Bristol* was twelve fewer than in H.M.S. * Salamander ' * , the result being that in the former the number of those who lost flesh and strength was reduced by 22 per cent.

Thus , o 58 , the number who lost weight became reduced from 65| to 40 per cent , by a removal from the tropics , combined with a limited use of salt meat .

] These experiments were carried out in super-oceanic climates .
It would be interesting to know how the weight and strength are affected in continental ones , where the range of temperature and humidity \amp ; c. are greater , as , for example , when troops are moved from the cool hilly regions of India to its sultry lowlands .
These facts suggest important hygienic and therapeutic indications ; for example:\#151 ; First .
That the tropics , especially during the rainy season , should be avoided by natives of colder latitudes .
Second .
That the young , the debilitated , and the diseased should especially shun warm regions .
Third .
That none but full-grown healthy adults should go there .
Fourth .
That with all , even the latter , a speedy exit should be made therefrom , when great loss of flesh and strength give warning of approaching disease .
Fifth .
That such injurious agencies as may increase the weakening or disease-inducing influences of tropical climates , of themselves irremediable , should be avoided , e. g. faulty diet , over fatigue , impure air , \amp ; c. Sixth .
That , to preserve health , a tropical climate should be frequently changed for the more temperate ones of higher altitudes or latitudes .

Conclusion .
The ultimate object of these varied functional and organic changes induced in the human frame by change of climate , is to accommodate it to altered meteorological and other conditions , and assimilate it to those of native races .
It is the ease or difficulty with which different varieties of mankind , ages , sexes , and idiosyncrasies become accustomed to this that indicates their capability for what we term acclimatization .
[ Would not a more intimate acquaintance than we yet possess with the differences in the minute anatomy and functions of the various tissues and organs of these different races and families , and also their correlation and capability or not of assimilation under change of climate , go far to decide the long-vexed questions as to the unity or plurality of species and of creative centres ?
\#151 ; Feb. 27 .
] In these important changes , moreover , especially that in the current of the blood from the interior to the surfaceof the body on proceeding to the tropics , there is an evident analogy with certain great operations which take place under similar circumstances in the inorganic world .
The air and ocean likewise heat as they proceed towards the equator , and finally overflow to form those beneficent winds and sea-currents which play so important a part in the economy of the globe , and influence its hygiene , therapeutics , and etiology , not less than its commerce .
And although in these it acts on what may be termed the centre of their circulation , whereas in the human frame it operates on its periphery , the agent in all three is the same , viz. the sun s heat , as is the primary effect , viz. a change in the direction of original currents , as well as the final results , viz. purification and modification ot temperature .
The general physical and general hygienic and curative schemes of nature are thus evidently connected .
Without these phenomena the heat of tropical lands and seas , and cold of other regions , would be intolerable , and that of the skin and body too high or too low for the maintenance of their vitality ; while both the air , ocean , and blood would rapidly become impure and unfit to sustain life .
Deriving its first and chief impulse from the heart , the blood mere y undergoes redistribution\#151 ; the current in cold and temperate climates being directed towards internal , and in the tropics towards external organs , especially the skin .
In either case it flows from cooler towards more h gh y heated regions .
Is not this vital process , therefore , in this respect also , a least partly akin to the allied phenomena in the air and ocean , and physical as well as physiological ?
The blood generally being probably somewhat warmer in the tropics than elsewhere , does not the heating of the surface and contents of the turgid cutaneous capillaries act as a vis in inducing it to flow towards and accumulate here , as the warm interior o in cold regions ?
