CHAPTER V. Of the Causes and Form of Ejection .
I. IF any Fellow of the Society shall contemptuously , or contumaciously , disobey the Statutes or Orders of the Society or Council ; or shall , by speaking , writing , or printing , publicly defame the Society ; or advisedly , maliciously , or dishonestly , do any thing to the damage , detriment , or dishonour thereof , he shall be ejected out of the Society .
II .
Whenever there shall be cause for the Ejection of any Fellow out of the Society , the President shall , at some meeting thereof , propose the Ejection of such Fellow ; which being put to the Ballot , and two thirds of the members voting for it , the President shall cancel his name in the Register , and at the same time pronounce him ejected in these words : I do , by the authority and in the name of the Royal Society of London , for improving natural knowledge , declare A. B. to be now ejected , and no longer a Fellow thereof .
And the Ejection of every such person shall be then recorded in the Journal-book of the Society ; and his name , as ejected , be also read at the next Anniversary Election .
