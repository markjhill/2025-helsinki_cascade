The peroxide of benzoyl , C14 H 00 , or carbon 69-42 , hydrogen 4'13 , oxygen 26'45 , was discovered by Professor ( now Sir B. C. ) Brodie , and described by him in the 'Proceedings ' of the Royal Society , vol. ix .
p. 361 .
The crystals were obtained from a solution in ether of the product of the mutual decomposition of equivalent proportions of chloride of benzoyl and peroxide of barium mixed in water .
The faces of the crystals , though brilliant , were not very even , so that , in order to obtain a moderately accurate result , it was necessary to measure a large number of crystals. .
The column headed 'observation ' contains the means of the observed angles ; the column headed 'calculation , ' the most probable values of the angles , taking into account the quality of the faces containing them , and the number of the observations in each case .

The minimum deviations of the brightest part of the solar spectrum were observed through the faces 01 2 , 01 2 , through the faces 10 1 , 1 01 , and through the faces 1 10 , 1 10 , the crystal being immersed in water contained in a vessel bounded by plates of glass parallel to the plane bisecting the dihedral angle formed by the refracting faces in each case .
From these observations it appears that for a ray in the plane 10 0 , and polarized in that plane , the index of refraction is about 1*837 ; for a ray in the plane 01 0 , and polarized in that plane , the index of refraction is between 1'545 and 1*546 ; and for a ray in the plane 00 1 , and polarized in that plane , the index of refraction is about 1'545 , Hence the optic axes are in the plane 01 0 , and they make with each other a small angle which is bisected by the line [ 1 0 0 ] .
A crystal having two opposite faces of the form I10 much larger than the two remaining faces , being immersed in oil for which = 1'4793 , and placed in a polarizing apparatus , the rings surrounding the optic axes were seen through the large faces of the form 11 0 .
The angle included between the directions of the optic axes within the oil was about 4 ?
