On Anomalous Trichromatic Colour Vision .
443 Several types of correction are shown that are new to lens optics .
The high order central corrections of L. A. J. and P. G. N. are accompanied by decreased violet but normal red correction .
L. E. J. shows no correction except in the extreme red and violet , where the correction is normal .
M. B. H. is slightly corrected except in the extreme regions .
C. H. B. is fairly well corrected over a wide region from 480 to 780 .
Tests were made for residual chromatic spherical aberration ( departure from Gauss condition ) by placing half of a half-tone screen over the test slit .
The writer could detect no residual in his own eye in the region from 500 to 650 .
Beyond 700 in the red and beyond 480 in the blue it is noticeable , while at 406 in the violet it amounted to fully 20 times the normal diffusion .
L. A. J. agreed with the writer but L. E. J. could detect little loss of definition at 406 .
I wish to record my indebtedness to Mr. Eastman and Dr. Mees for apparatus and to those of my assistants who served as subjects .

) Having occasion to examine a large number of persons who have abnormal colour vision , the author has found that the so-called anomalous trichromates are clearly divisible into two groups , which groups can be sharply differentiated by quite simple experimental means .
By anomalous trichromate is meant a person who , while not a dichromate , i.e. , a person who can match all colours of the spectrum by a mixture of two suitably chosen monochromatic lights , has not got normal colour vision .
Such cases were first investigated by Lord Rayleigh , and have since been investigated by many observers .
It has already been noticed by several investigators that there are two classes of anomalous trichromates .
These are distinguished by the fact that when a monochromatic orange ( D-light ) is matched by a mixture of green and red light one class , the protanopes , take more red in the mixture than the normal , while the other class , the deuteranopes , take more green than the normal .
The following paper is intended to prove that both of these classes require to be subdivided , or rather that anomalous trichromates ought preferably to be divided into two other classes , and then each of these classes subdivided into protanopes and deuteranopes .

As has been pointed out by Sir W. Abney , if white light is transmitted through a thickness of about 08 cm .
of a saturated solution of chromate of potash the colour of the resulting light can be matched by a single spectral colour , and , further , in the case of persons having abnormal colour vision the wave-length of the spectral colour differs from the one which matches the chromate light for the normal .
As a result of applying this .test to a large number of persons who have not got normal colour vision , the author noticed that , while for some observers the monochromatic colour which matches the chromate light is of quite definite wave-length , for others a band of the spectrum matches the chromate light ; further , that one edge of this band always coincides with the position which matches the chromate light to the normal eye .
Thus if a slit is traversed through .the spectrum and the light which passes is received on a screen alongside the light which has traversed the chromate solution and the position noted when the two lights match , the slit being moved alternately first from the red end of the spectrum and then from the green end , in the case of persons having normal colour vision the settings will lie between 578 and 580 / qu , when the source of the white light is the electric arc .
With one class of abnormals , which will be called class A , the setting coming in one direction will agree with the normal setting , but the setting coming in the other direction will differ markedly from the normal setting .
This class is divided into two subdivisions , one , Are , in which the abnormal setting , and hence the whole of the band of the spectrum which matches the chromate light , lies on the green side of the normal match , and the other , A^ , where the band lies entirely on the red side of the normal .
It must be remembered that the match with the chromate appears to be equally good throughout the band included between the extreme settings , and , further , that one edge of the band always coincides with the normal setting .
In the case of the other group of abnormal trichromates , which will be called class B , the match with the chromate light differs from the normal , but whichever way we move the slit the position for which the match is satisfactory is the same .
Of course individual settings differ slightly , but the differences are no greater than those obtained when a normal makes the .settings .
Up to now all the members of this class which have been met with obtain a setting which lies on the red side of the normal setting .
If , however , further investigation should bring to light persons who obtain a definite point of setting which lies to the green side of the normal , then this class would have to be subdivided as is class A. Another method of distinguishing the two classes is to match white by means of a mixture of violet ( 400 fifi ) and yellow , that is to determine the On Anomalous Trichromatic Colour Vision .
complementary to the violet .
Thus if a slit is moved through the spectrum in the neighbourhood of the yellow and the light is mixed in suitable proportions with violet light which passes through a second slit a match with white can be obtained , and the procedure adopted when making a test is exactly the same as with the chromate light .
In the case of the normal the position of the yellow slit will vary between 574 and 577 / qu , , the white being the light from an electric arc .
With class A the setting for the yellow slit when approaching in one direction always agrees with the normal , but the setting obtained when approaching in the other direction differs markedly from the normal setting , for a position of the slit anywhere between these two limits the match appearing equally good .
This region again is always bounded on one side by the position of the normal setting , but while for members of class Are it stretches towards the green , for members of class kg it stretches towards the red .
Persons belonging to class B have a complementary to violet which differs from the normal to various extents , but they differ from class A in that whichever direction we move the slit when making the match the position of setting is the same , the accuracy with which this position is located in the spectrum being , if anything , greater than that with which the corresponding setting can be made by normal observers .
The Table on p. 446 gives the results of the examination by these two methods of a number of persons who all possessed abnormal colour vision .
In each case two settings were made with the slit moving in each direction , and in the table are given the means of each pair of settings , i.e. , the mean of the two settings when the slit was moved up the spectrum , and the mean of the two settings obtained when the slit was moved down the spectrum .
In the table the results have been subdivided according to the classification given above , but in each class they are arranged in chronological order .
When examining the numbers it must be remembered that in every case the observer was quite unused to making colour matches or any other measurements of the kind .
The slit was in every case moved at a fairly uniform rate by the author , and the observer was asked to say " Stop " when the two patches of light , which were alongside one another , appeared to him to be of exactly the same colour .
On the Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory we can explain the classification given above .
Thus all members of class A are persons with defective red or green sensation .
In the case of Are the red sensation is defective , and this class would include as an extreme case that where the red sensation is completely absent , that is a protanopic dichromate , while at the other extreme we should have the normal .

On Anomalous Trichromatic Colour Vision .
The members of the division Ag have in the same way a defect in the green sensation .
In this case the amount of the defect varies greatly , though the greater proportion seem to have a green sensation which amounts to about half the normal .
Here again the luminosity values agree with those calculated on the assumption that the green sensation is defective .
Members of class B are such that the red-sensation curve is exactly the same as the normal .
The green sensation is as strongly developed as in the normal , but the green-sensation curve appears to be displaced towards the red end of the spectrum , the displacement varying to a certain extent in the case of the different persons .
The result of this displacement is that the point in the spectrum where the red- and green-sensation curves intersect is displaced towards the red .
Hence the complementary to the violet is displaced to an equal extent .
A typical case of such a displaced green-sensation curve has been described in detail in a paper by Sir W. Abney and the author.* If the Rayleigh match of spectral orange with a mixture of green and red is used to test these anomalous trichromates , it will be found that while members of class B make a very definite match , which differs from the normal in that it contains much more green , yet the accuracy with which they make the match is as great as in the case of persons having normal vision .
On the other hand , members of class A often make matches which differ from the normal , but yet their successive settings will differ considerably , and will , in general , approach the normal setting as one limit .
This test is not , however , nearly as convenient as those described in this paper , owing to the fact that the orange produced by mixing green and red is less saturated than the spectral orange , and different observers , or even the same observer at different times , seem very uncertain as to the allowance to be made on account of this want of saturation .
Although the settings obtained by members of class B in the two tests described above are satisfactorily explained by a displacement of the green-sensation curve , the explanation of the settings obtained by members of class A is not so obvious .
It is fairly evident that in the case of class A we have to do with a reduction form of normal colour vision , so that in Are the red sensation , and in Ag the green sensation , is less well developed than in the normal .
Because in the case of such reduction forms we should expect a want of definiteness in making the colour matches .
Hence the fact that in class A a considerable band of the spectrum is matched with the chromate light or can be combined with a given violet to form white supports the view that this class is a reduction form , yet it does not explain the position - * 4 Boy .

of this band .
For the band does not extend on both sides of the position corresponding to the normal setting , but lies entirely on one side .
At present the author is not in a position to offer any explanation of this fact .
The distinction between classes A and B appears to him , however , of such fundamental importance , when considering the connection between heredity and colour blindness and also when studying the incidence of this condition in different peoples , that he has decided to publish the results he has obtained up to now without waiting till , by further experiments , more light has been thrown on this particular difficulty .
Note on Mr. MallocJc 's Observations on Intermittent Vision .
By Silvanus P. Thompson , F.R.S. ( Received May 21 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1914 .
) In the paper communicated by Mr. Mallock on December 11 , 1913 , * in order to account for the intermittences seen when watching a revolving disc of black and white sectors , at the moment when a slight mechanical shock is given to the head or body , he advances the hypothesis that a slight mechanical shock of any kind produces a periodic but rapidly extinguished paralysis of the perception of light , and that the nerves on which seeing depends cannot bear more than a certain amount of mechanical acceleration without loss of sensibility .
This hypothesis of a momentary paralysis of the sense of vision seems unnecessary .
The sector disc revolving at from two to six revolutions per second presents a uniform grey tint .
At the moment when the intermittence occurs , by stamping the foot or tapping the head , the most prominent effect observed by the writer was not the momentary appearance of stationary grey or black sectors , but the enhanced brightness of stationary white sectors .
A momentary paralysis , if it occurred , should produce momentary blackness of the entire disc , which is not what happens .
To put the phenomenon to further test , a revolving sector disc , driven uniformly by a small electric motor , was arranged so that it could be observed either directly from a distance of a few feet or by reflection in a small sheet of mirror-glass held in the hand or clamped elastically between two india* 1 Roy .
