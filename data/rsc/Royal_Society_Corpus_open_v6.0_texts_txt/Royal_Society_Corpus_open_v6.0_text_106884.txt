ing D-E , may be-come a pendulum .
Thus we shall procure a ... pendulum of the same length , whatever be the degree of heat .
Let the rodi AB and the rocl DC be of different species of matter , so that the rod AB shall be lengthened by being heated to the same degree , more than the rod DC ; then if they be both of the same length , heat would carryup the erld of the rod CD at D , hi\#171 ; er than the fixed point A ; but if a part be cut of from AB at -G , so that the whole of the expansion of the remaining part GB shall be equal to the whole of the expansion of the whole rod DC , and that in every inerease of heat , then the same thing would happen ; and the part of the rod DC , cut offby the apparatus at E , would always remairl of the same length .
If , therefore , it is wished to render DE always equal in length , the fixed point A must be brought nearer to B7 so as to shorten the rod AB , that is at G , so that the whole of the expansion of GB by heat , shall be equal to the whole of the expansion of DC by the same degree of heat .
Hitherto : I have supposed that the substance which connected the points A and E was incapable of being expanded or contracted by heat : but no such substance is to be found .
I shall now auppose that the substance which connects the points A and E is capable of being expanded byE heat .
If it was capable of expansion equal to the matter of which the rods AB and CDtconsist , then it xs evident that no advantage could be gained so as to rezlder the part of the rod CD opposite to the point E down to D always equal .
But it is clear that the expa-nsion of AE , supposing the point Aa fixed one , would carry the point E higher up towards C , if the heat was greater , so that EDt would by this means be renclered longer ; and the contraction of AE , when exposed to a greater degree of cold , would brin$ down the point E so as to render ED shorter , just as much as the expansion of AB would raise up the rod ED , or as its contraction lower it .
But if the materials connecting the points A &lt; and E were less expansile and contractile by heat and cold , than the matter of the rods AB and CD , then upon the-whole expanding although the point E would be raised higher towards C ; yet it would not be raised so high as the expansion of AB would raise the point C , and the whole rod CD .
The sameL is tru-e if the whole of them contract , but in an opposites direction .
That is to say , the pointiE would not descend so far towardfs D , as the point C would descend towards D , andwith it the wholewrod CD w by this means although the part ED would not be always equal , yet it will be much more equal than if the point C were a fisedgpoint , and not capable of being affected with the contraction or expansion of the rod AB .
-If then the part of the frod CDa from opposite to the point E to D was a perldulum , it would not be always of the same length , but it would be more nearly so than a simple pendulum made of the same materials of which the rod CD consists , , and it would be nearly of the same length as if Sthe penduhxm had been made of the materials which connect A and E. In order then to render ED always of an equal length , some other principle must be employed .
Now let BA ancS CD consist-of the same materials- ; and the matter connecting A and E consist of a substance that expands by heat , and contracts fiby coldS less than the materials of which AB and CD are formed , -if the rod AB be-brought down to H , and the fixed pointbe at H , and the points HE be connected ; together by the same materials which formerly connected the points AFX in the rodt EH , take a point X , equal in height with the points A D , and in the line AD which is parallel to the horizon , as it has already been taken-in the construction ; then the rod AH shall expand , upon being heated , in perpendicular height more than the rod HK , and therefore the expansion of AH shall carry the poi:nt B , gand in consequence the point C , higher than the expansion of the rod HK shall carry the point E0 ; but if the expansion of the rod AH be as great as the expansiotl of the whole rod HE , then the poirlt C will be carried as much higher than the point E , as the point E is carried higlaer than it was before the heat was ap-plied , and therefore the point E shall be at as great a distance from the point C , as it would have been if the materials connecting AE had been .
incapable of being altered by heat : and therefore if EI ) be a petldulum , it will be rendered of the same length .
If then the rods AB , and CD , be of the same materials , and the substance connecting A and E is capable of expanding and contracting less by heat than the matter of the rods AB and CD , then , by adding to the rod AB , + a part AH , under the circum- &gt; stances already described , and making the fixed point at H , we can obtain a pendulum always of equal length ; or if the materials of which the rodHAB consists be capable of being expallded by-heat as -much as the materials of which CD consists , together wit-h the expansion of the materials that connect A and ES in that case likewise the point C shall be carried as much higher than the point E , as it would be when they are expanded by heat , as if the materials connecting A and E had not been affected by heat at all 0r , lSastly , if we take a rod GB7 of materials which expand much more than the expansion of the matter of the rod CD , and the 'connecting matter of the rod EG by heat , then likewise upon the rod GB expanding it *will carry the point B , and consequently the pointA C , as much higher than the point E ?
as it would have been if the materials connecting G and E had been incapable of being ; expanded by heat , and therefore ED will always continue of the same length .
The same reasoning will hold in cases o\#163 ; contraction from cold .
Therefore , if materials be employed in the rod GB , which contract considerably more than .
those which compose.the rod. .
CD , then the fixed point G is to be taken at a distance frotru4 B , in an inverse ratio to the inferior expansile povrer of the-materials of wl}icli the rod .
CD consists , and in a direct ratio ; of the expa.nsi.le power of the .
materials which connect E andM G. That is , supposing tha.t it was taken in the inverse ratio of theinferior e-xpansilepower of CD , then it would be at G , .
but to counteract the eexpansile pourwer of the materials GE , it must be somewhat lowerat I. If then thej proportion of the exparsion of the materials dfs the rod AB , or GB , the rod GD and thez m-aterials which con nected AE or G1\#163 ; were known , and the length of a pendulumswE i:ngingt any proportion of -timeS in that case the distanceand perpendicular height between GE andO IE : might be taken at oncej and a pendulum might be always made which would always b-e of the same length , therefore swing equal arches in equals tim-e$.But these not being perfectly known , and it bes rlg extremely difficult , if not impossible7 to measure oWlength perfectly ; it is necessary to^have the power-ofvarfngthe dist-ancesand perpndicular height between I and E , A and E , or H and E , --so that it maybe tound from trial whether these ; fixed points I , Ay or X , btproperly taken .
For ifS on.construcxt ing a pendulunn on : these principles either of the fixed points , according to the circumstances , IA or H be placed too high or too lowf then the pendulim will vary in tsle &gt; ngth , and of consequence swing different times in different degrees of heat That is to sayn suppose the case be taken mrhere the rod BG is made of lnaterials which exparld more than CD if in stead of relldering I the fixed pOillt , it iS made G , nearer to B then the point C will not be raised suffi-ciently above the point E , the pendulum will become longer by heat , and malie fewer vibrations in a givela time .
But if the fixed point in this case be brought lonver than I to the point , then the point C will be raised higher when the whole is expanded by heat from the point ES ED will be rendered shorter , more vibrations will be performed in a given time , and e boStrai Therefore if there be a power in the apparatus of alterlng the fixed point I , if found too high or too low by experiment , we shall be able to find out a true point , and make an adjustment aconrdingly .
That is , -if heat occasions a pendulum to make fewer vibrations the fixed point is too high r if , on theecontrary , it makes too many vibrations , then the fixed point will be too low .
I GOllle now to show how these princples may be applied in structlre As it is more convenient in practice to have the fixed point higher than A , which is equal in height to D the bottom of the pendulum , a substance should be thosen for the rod AB which expands and contracts more by heat and cold than the matter of which the rod GD consists so that the fixed point should be at -G if the-materials connecting A and E were illcapable of being expanded or contracted by heat or cid : but if their expan$ion and contraction is to be comperlsated for , the fixed point will be at I , as h ; as already been shown ... If the expansion and contractiorz of the rod IB by heat and cold , in proportion to the expansion and contraction of CD were knowrl , and the expansion and contraction in perpendicular height of IE , then the length IF ; should be to the length DC , as the contraction of the materials of CD i$ to the contraction of the ma-terials of which IB is constructedD added to the contraction in perpeladicular height of the materials of which IE is constructed .
These lengths , in this caseo might be taken at Qnce ; but it is much more collvenient to haare the power of fixing them by esperiment , after takingthem from measure as nearly as may be Thereforen to have a mearls of raising the point I higher or lower in proportion to EDs whose ends are always to be at the same distal-X+ from one another , fig. .
represents the means of altering the point I in proportion in height to E. the frame AAAX is fixed to the substance which connects the point-s I and E by any Ineans .
In the clock which I have constructeds the material which connects I and E is wood , as will be described afterxvards .
The frame is brass ; it is fised to the wwd by the screws BB and two other opposite orles which are hid ; 11 the drawing They are so fixed that the point I shall be ne-arly in the nziddle between the upper screw B7 and the iower screw-Bf and so that the part of the frame DDD : D shall pro3ec.t backwards , and carry the patt of the frame EEER behind the frarne which forms the connection between I and E , so as to be rparallel to it r of consequence perpendicular to the horizon .
In this frarne tIlere is seen , aSt the upper part , in the drawingn a dove-tail groove7 in which , on botEL sides , anvther frame MDGCXCIV .
CGGGG slides , in the same manner as in that part of a transit instrument which renders one end of the asls higher or lower .
This second frarne is brought higher or lower by the screw HH The rod IB , fig. , is a brass t.ube , represented by I I. 'rhere is a semicylindric cavity in the frame GGGG of the same diameter wXth the brass tube Sa piece is applied over this franie , which is likewise a semicircular cavityn forming with the other cavity a whole cylinder , equal in diameter to the tube I I. This piece is attached:.to the frame GGGG by the screws LLv when these are screwed in tightf they occasion the tube II to be embracetl perfectly by the piece KK , and the semicylindric cavity in the frame G , so that the screw HH could not act if the tube II was fixedf but if the screws LL are loosened , then they would leave the frame GGGG capable of being heightened or lowered by the screw HH .
Now , if II represent the rod IB , Sg .
, then if the centre of the screws LL be in arl horizontalline , that line will cut the point I in arl horizontal direction The centres of these screws , therefore , may be considered as the point I in perpendicular laeight X wherefore if the point B , fig. - , should become a fixed point , the point I may be lowered or heighterled by bringing up or carrying down the centres of the screws LL by thescrew HH .
If it be wishedf therefore , lie this apparatus to raise or depress the point I , fig. o it is necessary during the time of altering its height by the screw HHn that B , fig. should become a fixed point ; but that at all other times it should be a part perfectly free in its motion upwards or downwards .
In order to fix the point B fig , in fig. g AAAA represents the frame of the clock , BB another frame fixed to this frame .
, and projecting backwards to such a distance-as to ca:rvrzr a tabe { ised to it CC so far back and-in such direction , as to exactly coincide on its insido with vile cylinder formed btr the semicirem ; lar cavity in the frame ( ; C ; , fig. 2 and the cylindric part of the piece KK9 so-that if they were ; continued theywould form the sanne cylinder when the screws LL fig. tf ale screwed hcalue .
This tube is made exactly to fit the tube I I , in the sane manner that the outer brass tube of a telescop\#162 ; is fitted to the inner one .
This tube CC is split operl on one side , and is of such a. .
degree of elasticity as to open when left to itself at this slit , so as to leave the tube II entirely-free .
&gt; fo the frame B is fitted a piece D , which consists of two setnicylinders , connected tofgether by one being screwed to the piece B at E , the other to the frarne B at E on the other side .
They are also connected by a part F , where they can be brought together orseparated by the screw G. ; Now if the screw G be undone , then the two semicylinderswill separate from one anotherf and allow the tube CC to open by its elasticity , and the tube II to be at perfect liberty in expanding upwart1s or downwards .
But if the screw G be screwed honne , then the twofsides of the piece F will embrace the tube C , and shut it upon the tube Ig so that it shall become fixed at this point .
This apparatus lmay be placed any where between B and I , fig. 1 .
In the clock I have con-structed , it is placed at the point F opposite to E , fig. 1 .
If the point I be placed then too high the clock will be found to go too slow if the heat be greater , too fast if it be less .
If this should be found the case , then the screw G , fig. , is to be screwed hozne , the screws L Ln fig. 2n are to beF loosenesd , and the frame GCkGG must be screwed downward ( by the screw H , which will carry along with it the piece KK , therefore the centres of the screws LL which form the point I figs , in perpendiclllar height Then the screws L L , fig. 2 are to be screwed home , the screw G , fig. , is to be loosenetl so as to leave the tube I I , which is the same in both figuresS perfectly free and untouched by any of the apparatus excepting at the point I , the fixed point .
The same thing is to be done , only in the rearerse , if the clock be found to go too fast in a greater degree of heat , too slow in a greater degree of cold. .
In the clock which I have constructed , the bar B:C , fig. is considered as inflexible If it were flexibley a weight hurxg at C would occasion it to fall lower , and in consequence bring the rod CI ) lower , and a greater part of it below the point E ; thus the pendulum would be lengthenecI .
It is therefore necessary to make this rod as inflexible as possible ; for this reason it is made of a strong brass bar HK , fig. , which is irther strengthened by a brass bar LK , supported by the upright HL .
If a weight were hung at K , it would tend to draw the tube I out of the perpendiclllar towards K. To prevent this another bar HM is carried exactly opposite , so that MHK shall f-orm the same bar , the under surface of which is parallel to the horizon .
At the erud of this bar M , is appended a weight 0 , so that , supposing the line LH to be the axis of the tube II continued , and perl)endicular to the horIzon , then the whole of the weight on the side of LtI towards Mn shall be equal to the whole of the weight on the sid-e of LLI towards 1 ) .
P is the head of a screw , t ; o the centre of whicttl t* ; e rod ?
CD , fig. is attached ; this screw passes through the end of the bar -HP , in the same manner asi the wire sustaining th@ weight O passes through then end of the bar HM at N. The uses of this screw are to be seen in fig. 4 , where HK represent the end of the bar HK , fig. &gt; through which the screw A passes The head of thisscrew P is tootlled and divided To the teeth there is a catch at Kwhich allows it to be turned backwards and forwards with a tolerable force , but keeps t.t in the same place arltil thatirce be applied to it The upper part of the screw C fig. 4 , is a cylinder which passes through a cy lindric hole in the end of the bar HK7 fittedzto it so as to allow of being turned round without shaking The screw stself passes through a female screw at D in the frame OF .
This frame as well as the screw itself , is maade of brass , and consists of a bar OF , which is perpendicular to the horizon o from which arise two pieces GG and EL , at right angles therefore parallel to the horizon .

On considering the several different methods of finding a measure of lengtlls which could be always and universally as-certained I am persuaded that the taking the difference of the length of two pendulumsf vibrating different timesS appears not only to be the most perfect , but the easiest attainable .
EA{r .
WHITEHURST contrived an apparatus for the purpose of ascertaining this difference , an account of which was read in the Royal Society , anal afterwards withdrawn and published by the author himself .
After his death , I purchased this apparatus .
There was no means in it whate-ver of keeping the pendulum of the same lerlgth when the heat should vary ; consequently it was impossible that any accurate admeasurement of the different lengths of two pendulums keeping different times could be ascertained .
Mr. WHITEHuRsT , indeecI , had endeavoured to keep his pendulum of the same degree of heat , but I kraow from tnany experitllents , among which some were for-hatching eggsn how extretalely diffictllt it is to maintain the same heat in arly considerable mass , and sthat the means which may be employed to keep it within four or five degrees are almost totally inapplicable to pendulums so that his experiments must have been defective .
: I:therefore endeavoured to contrive a means of rnderirtg the pendulum in his machine always of the same length : , whatever the heat might be , by some addition to Sit .
I thought of the principle , and formed the apparatus aboure described for this purpose .
It wollld be improper:for me to repeat what has already been laid before this learned Society ; therefore I shall only mention briefly , that the frame of Mr. WHITEEIURST'S machine was formed o35 two piecesof very clean well seasoned deal to which was fixed the apparatus for rendering the wire flexible of 87vhich his pendulum was formed at the point Q , fig. 4 , but there were no semicylondric pieces ; the two square pieces came together , so as to make the top of the pendulum at their urlder surface ; these pieces could bebrorlght awayfrom oneanotherbythe screw Y , so as to leave the wire free .
The use of this was by the screr L , lSg .
4 , to ad just the pendulum to its proper length , which has in this apparatus a considerable Xadvantagf , as it is not necessary , in the form I have given to this apparatus , to stop the clock in order to adjust it .
These pieces of wood are mortisedSinto a transverse piece of deal at the top and at the bottom firmly .
Before I attelupted to make a s7ery perfect machine on these principles , I resolved to try how fir this frame of wood might serve to connect the points I and , fig &lt; , and procured the apparatus for altering the point I screwed Q11 to one of theseperpendicular pieces of wood on 07ae side , and to the other on the other side .
The pendlllum itself serves as a plulnmFet to place them perpendicular .
In Mr. WHITEHURST}S ulachine the screw at L , fig. 4 , went through a piece of brass , and rested llpon tit , Sxed to the top of the clock-case .
But in my construction of it when the length of the rod IB , fig. i , is adjusted , the clock has nothing to do with the clockcase , excepting with that part of the svooden frame vstllich connect-s the point I with the point E , fig 1 .
If I had been , or were to construct a machine for this purpose D origin , insteaGIwof these two pieces c)f fir , I should employ a solid piece of brass .
, and make two cyrlindric caxri-ties into it , parallel to vne rawtller and in these cavities place two glass tubes , about tvvt anches diameter , ; I3erpendicularly upwards , which may bedo &lt; e iby vatious meanss and , while in this situation11aving heated. .
-them gradu:ally to the kat of meltFed lead , -I sllotlld pour irt meltedlead , so as to fix them izthtir p]aces when it cooled The apparatus Evr fixing the point Ia and that fr lSsing the tube iI I , fig. 2 and g at F , firg i1 being also of brass , n ; heat they xYould always expand , and in cold con-tract , *equally , so that the glass tubes would k-eep alvays at an equal distance from one another , and equally perpelldicular .
Glass is not only very little apt tocontract and expand by heat , kut free frozn any such dispositiora from moisture or dryness wl*ich iis not the case with v$Zood ... . .
Having added the apparatus I have d^escribed to Mr. WIol TE HURST)S ma\#163 ; hine , I set it a going , expectingS in the situation I placed ot , only some approach towards accuracy in the lengsth of the pendulum .
I fised bveside it a trarssit which b@longed to Mr. LUDLAM the principal parts of which were macle by Mre 1RAM8DEN , the object-glass was a four-feet focus achromatic by DOLLOND .
I found-my meridian mark at about three quarters of a tnile distance .
I likewise borrowed , Dom my-f-riend Mro STEVENSF a clock with a gridiron pendlllum , made-by G:RAHASq for hls father Drs STEVENS ) Ir1 order to compare them toge there when I had no observations .
There were several trivial circumstances whoch baffled the experinents for some time not worth relating , one only excepted u which was , that the curvature of the wire , acquiwd by its bei-ng wound ; round a pirn , was not entirely u-nfolded for some months ; so that the clock went slower and slower during that time .
At length this difficulty was overcorne ; I tin began to observe withn occxc^l .
D CRAHAM &gt; S clock , in order to adjust thGlength of the pendulum , but found irregularities frequently take ; place .
I then adjusted it by obseraration , and soon found that GRAHAM'S clock went. .
much more irregularly than my own .
I adjusted it by turning the head of the screw at Ln fig. 4 , until the clock came to lose seven-tenths of a second in 244 hours .
I did not think it Aworth while to bring it nearer ; I then began-to observe , and carried on the observationss when the weather permitted , for about nine months , during which the thermometer had fallen so low as 5Q of FARRENSEIT , in the clock case , and risen as highSas S+ ; and with cotisiderable variations .
Unfortunately I have mislaid or lost the particulars of each observation ; but I have preserved the greatest difference from the rate of its gomg .
Courlting on ?
accordlng to the rate of its going , during the whole time it never exceeded the sumf half a second , nor was ever less than half asecond , whether it was taken from day to day , month to months or from any one to any other period during the observation .
Undoubtedly , thereforef notwithstandling the errors thal ; m-ight have arisen from the expaIlsion of the wood btr moisture , and from the unsteadiness of the building in which it was pla\#163 ; ed , it certainly performed-better than any ol:her time-piece that has been made ; and perhaps a5ords a principte which may be u-sed in fixedW observatories for keeping t ; irne wiLh certaiilty9 lby evsy and not very expensive mearlsS and of determinil^ , , with the rest of Mr. WHITESURST'S apparatus , the diSerence betweerl the lengths of two pendulurns swinging.* equal archo of circles of different cliameters , in any tw givertw different times .
The as-tronofmer royal has alsosu$gested : an improv@nzent * viz. instead of grinding the two crystalline pieces in a cylindric fornl , the lower part should nbe ground in acycloidal forma then it would have the advantage of cycloidal clleeksb which no contrivance hitherto has been able to attain .
There are some farther observations necessary to be made , to enable workmen to construct clocks according to tYhis prinw ciple , and so-me r-eflections upon its operation .
The manner of hanging a leaden weight to the pendulumb ts proportion to the maintaining power , the manner of apply ing the pendulum to the clock , and the structure of the clock are to be:foutld in Mr. WHITEHURST &gt; S parnphlet ; with -only this difference , that the\#162 ; steel wire should go through a tube placed in the axis of the spherical lead weight , and be fixed at the bottom instead of the top of it .
This , however , is of no great consequenc^e if there be a power-of altering the height of the fixed point I , fig 1 ; because Mr. WHITEHURST'S pendua lum consisting partly of steeln partly of lead , therefors the point IS must be adjusted to the joint expansions of lead and steel , if the wire be fixed at the top of the ball .
The first reflection that I shall make is , that the st-eel wire the brass tube , and the materials which connect the poirlts I Ee being of diSerent sizes , and different in their disposition to be heated or cooled , some one of them might be heated or cooled faster than anothe:r .
Bu-t where good clocks are kept7 the changes of the heat of the atmosphere are so slow , that no ugreat difFerence ca:n take pla-ce i-n the time that each of the parts rises to the heat of the atmo-sphere iJa the room where the clock is kept none that could -make any sensible error- .
As the difference of the time when they acquired the heat , wsould be corn ?
ensated.by the difference of the time when they D g acquired the cold- , it could hardly happen that any sensible dif terence ill the golng of the clock could arise in any period ofx twenty-four hours , whether transits of the sun or of any of the fised stars were taken .
lGhe wire in each vibration laangs , during a certain por tion of that vibration , between the two cylinders , and touches aeitoher of them q cIuring that time , the point Q NlUSt be considered as the top of the pendulum , not the slit between the cyliders but this part of the vibration may be so very small a proportion of it , aXs not to makef any sensible error X and it is accompanied on the other hand by a very great advantage ilixcept in Mr. -RNOLD'S compensation for heat in watches , in all the other modes a surface or surfaces necessarily slide over one another X whenever this-happens , if heat , by expanding one of the-bodiesn is to male its surface slide over the other , it has twothings to accomplish , to overcome the vis insita of theX matter , and the atEra\#163 ; tion of the two surfaces to one anozthe-r When then thereis heat enough applied j.ustSo overcome the ztis insita , i-t would not be suicient to overcomXe the attraction likewises excepting the matter was iXnfinitely hardw and inelastic .

In consequenceS the rod DC will have its end D in a lineexactly parallel to the horizorl , and cut-ting the end of the rod AB at A , as it did before the heat was applied ; and the same thing will betrlle if the mds AB , DC , be shortelled by exposure to cold 9 ^so that ill all cases of heat or cold the end of the rod C:D at D , and the etld of the rod 13A at A , shall be in a ; line parallel to the horizon .
Take a point E near any part of the rod CD , and let that point E be connected with the point A where the end A of the rod AB is fixed , and let the matter whi( h unites them be perfectly inflexible , and incapable of being altered by heat then , I say that the part of the rod CD intercepted at ; the point E , axldforming ED , will always beXof the sam-e length whether the temperature of heat is greater or less For stlpposing a point F be taken near the rod AB , and of the same perpendicular height with E , so that a line drawn from E to F shall be parallel to the horizon ; if &gt; the part of the rod ABy czpposite to F , should rise up in consequence of being expanded by heat above F5 it will carry up the point of the rod DC , mIhich was opposite to E , to : an equal height vzFith itself , and therefore would cut off from the length-of that part of the rod which was formerly opposite to E , a length eq-ual to-that which was added to whEat was formerly ED by the heat .
Therefore the point opposite to E , in the rod DCD , will form EDX which will always continue of the same lengthS if thexheat be increased ; and vby-similaEt reasoning , it will likewise continu-e of the same length if the part of the rod A13 AF is shortened by cold S therefore the part of the rod DC cut off by the point EJ so as to form ED , will always be of an equal length , and the point D will always be of an equal heigh.t .
At the point E let there be arl appar-atus which will render that part of the rod DC which is -opposite to the point E flexible , wha-tever part of it shall be opposite to the point E. Then the part of the rod DCn cut offat the point E and formeB2
