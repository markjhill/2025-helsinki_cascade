Part IX.\#151 ; On the Cholesterol Content of the , other than Liver , of Rabbits under Various Diets and during Inanition .
By G. W. Ellis and J. A. Gardner .
( Communicated by Dr. A. D. Waller , F.R.S. Received May 9 , \#151 ; Read June 20 , 1912 .
) ( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , South Kensington .
) In Part VIII of this series of papers , we published analyses of the livers of rabbits fed on various diets , and also of rabbits kept in a state of inanition .
The results appeared to lend support to the hypothesis previously suggested with regard to herbivora , that when cells are broken down in the normal life process , their cholesterol is not excreted as a waste product , but is utilised in the formation of new cells .
A function of the liver is to break down dead cells and eliminate their cholesterol in the bile .
After the bile has been passed into the intestine in the process of digestion , the cholesterol is re-absorbed , possibly in the form of esters , along with the bile salts , and is carried in the blood stream to the various centres and tissues , for re-incorporation into the constitution of new cells .
In*this paper we give the cholesterol contents of some of the other tissues of the animals dealt with in Part VIII , in which paper we gave a full account of the methods used in extracting the tissues , and for estimating the free and ester cholesterol .
That paper also contained the detailed protocols , giving the weights of the animals during the various dietetic periods and during inanition , so that it is not necessary to refer to them in detail again .
The tissues examined are blood , muscle , brain , kidney , and lung .
The other organs of the rabbit were too small to be dealt with in individual animals .
The investigation comprises the following experiments , the data of which we have given as concisely as possible .
Fuller details of the diets and conditions of the animals under experiment are given in our previous communication above mentioned .
The Cholesterol Content of Blood , Kidneys , Muscle , Lungs , and Brains of Babbits Fed on Green Food .
Experiments I and II:\#151 ; Babbit A was fed , for a period of about 30 days , on a diet of cabbage and Messrs. Ellis and Gardner .
Origin and [ May 9 very small quantities of extracted bran .
It retained a healthy condition and constant weight .
The blood , of which 101*3 grin , were obtained , yielded as total cholesterol 0*2440 grm. of digitonin cholesteride , and as free cholesterol 0*2302 grin , of the compound .
These figures represent a percentage of 0*0552 free cholesterol and 0*0033 ester cholesterol .
The kidneys were cut in a few pieces , rinsed with saline , and freed from adhering moisture by means of blotting paper .
They weighed 20*72 grm. , and yielded as total cholesterol 0*1390 grm. of digitonin cholesteride , and as free cholesterol 0*1080 grm. of the compound .
These figures represent a percentage of 0*2534 free cholesterol and 0*0728 ester cholesterol .
Muscle .
100 grm. were taken for the estimation , the sample being cut away from the body wall and limb muscles .
The total digitonin cholesteride was 0*1545 grm. and the free was 0*1360 grm. , corresponding to a percentage of 0*0661 free and 0*0090 ester cholesterol .
The lungs were also washed with saline and freed from adhering moisture by means of blotting paper .
Their weight was 9*11 grm. The total digitonin cholesteride was 0*0765 and the free was 0*0473 grm. , corresponding to a percentage of 0*2524 free and 0*1558 ester cholesterol .
The brain , dissected out as completely as possible , weighed 10*592 grm. It was dried with sand and plaster of Paris in the usual manner .
One-quarter of the ether extract was taken for the free cholesterol estimation , and half of the extract was saponified , of which one-half was taken .
This was found advisable as it was more convenient to deal with small quantities of the compound .
The total digitonin cholesteride was 0*2110 grm. and the free 0*2310 .
The free cholesterol was thus 2*12 per cent. , and no ester was present .
Babbit B received the same diet as A of the previous experiment .
It was fed for a period of about seven weeks , and appeared in a normal healthy condition when killed .
As the organs were treated in a precisely similar manner to those of the previous experiment , we shall merely give the figures obtained from the analysis .
The blood ; 89*6 grm. were taken for the estimation .
Half the ether extract yielded 0*1285 grm. of cholesteride , which corresponds to 0*0697 per cent , free cholesterol , and the saponified half yielded 0*1429 grm. of cholesterol , corresponding to a total of 0*0775 per cent , cholesterol and , by difference , 0*0078 ester cholesterol .
The kidneys weighed 15*65 grm. Half the extract yielded 0*0505 grm. of cholesteride , equal to 0*1568 per cent , free cholesterol .
The saponified half yielded 0*0857 grm. of cholesteride , equal to 0*2661 per cent , total cholesterol and , by difference , 0*0093 per cent , ester cholesterol .

There was no ester cholesterol .
Bile.\#151 ; Attempts were made to estimate the cholesterol content of the bile of the rabbits under different diets and during starvation .
In the case of the normal animals , whether fed with green food or extracted bran , it was possible to detect cholesterol , but quite impossible to estimate gravimetrically with any approach to accuracy .
The amount of bile in the gall bladders in each case was only 0*5\#151 ; 1 grm. in weight .
In one or two cases the results were interesting .
The contents of the gall bladder of the cholesterol and olive oil injected rabbit was found to be quite solid .
Its weight was 1*72 grm. and contained 1*266 per cent , free cholesterol and no ester .
The bile of the rabbit injected with olive oil only weighed about 3*66 grm. and contained 0*081 per cent , total cholesterol with a trace of ester cholesterol .
In the former case the large excess of cholesterol in the bile was not wholly re-absorbed ; an examination of the faeces from the animal showed that 7*3 mgrm .
of cholesterol was excreted per day , as mentioned in our previous communication .
The biles from the two rabbits kept in a state of inanition contained 1912 .

391 a higher percentage of cholesterol than the normally fed rabbits .
From Rabbit I were obtained 1*18 grm. of bile , yielding 05457 per cent , free and 0-3151 per cent , ester cholesterol .
From Rabbit J the bile weighed 139 grm. , yielding 0-1678 grm. free and 0*1329 ester cholesterol .
Discussion of Results .
Blood.\#151 ; In Table I we gather together the results of estimations of cholesterol and cholesterol esters in the blood of rabbits under the various diets given in this and in a former paper .
The results show that the cholesterol-content of the blood after food depends on the sterol-content of the food taken .
In the case of animals in a state of inanition , which are living on their own tissues , the blood , just as in the case of the liver , contains an increased amount of both free and compound cholesterol .
The results throw no light on what governs the relations of free and combined cholesterol .
Muscle.\#151 ; The cholesterol-content appears to bear no relation to the sterol-content of the diet .
In the cabbage-fed and in the starving animals , the mean total cholesterol in each case is 0*0693 and 0 0718 .
The total cholesterol appears to vary from 0*0437 to 0*0751 per cent. The results throw no light on the variations of the relative proportions of free and combined cholesterol .
Brain.-*\#151 ; The percentage of free cholesterol varied in different animals from 2*02 to 2*88 .
The mean of eight experiments was 2*315 per cent. In no case was any evidence of the presence of cholesterol-esters found .
Kidney.\#151 ; The results do not indicate that the content of this tissue depends in any way on diet .
The average values for the animals fed on cabbage and extracted bran , which were apparently in good health , are free cholesterol 0*2466 per cent , and ester cholesterol 0*0596 , figures which are not very dissimilar from the mean of those given by Windaus* for normal human kidneys , viz. , free 0*24 , and ester 0*02 per cent. In the case of the starved animals the total cholesterol is much higher .
The average figures in the two experiments are total cholesterol 0*5211 per cent. , free 0*3937 per cent. , and ester 0*1274 .
The increase above normal is very marked in the case of the ester .
In the case of the two rabbits which had had oil injected into the peritoneal cavity , and which were not in normal health , a similar increase in the ester cholesterol , compared with the free , is noticeable , the average * " tiber die quantitative Bestimmung der cholesterin und der cholesterin colic in einigen normal und pafchologischen Nieren , " A.

393 with the diet .
It is interesting to note , however , that this tissue has a higher cholesterol-content than any we have examined , with the exception of brain .
In six animals the average total free and combined cholesterol is 0*5022 per cent. , the free cholesterol 0*4493 per cent. , and ester cholesterol 0*0529 .
The ester cholesterol was v.ery variable and , in two cases , nil .

A Note on the Protozoa from Sick , with some Account of the Life-Cycle of a Flagellate Monad .
By C. H. Martin , M.A. , late Demonstrator in Zoology at Glasgow University and at the Imperial College of Science .
( Communicated by Prof. E. A. Minchin , F.R.S. Received May 10 , \#151 ; Read June 20 , 1912 .
) [ Plate 10 .
] Of recent years a great deal of attention has been attracted to the subject of sick soils , i.e. soils of which the produce has fallen off without the decrease being definitely attributable to the lack of plant-food in the soil .
In this preliminary note I should like to deal shortly with some aspects of this question from a zoological point of view , and also to describe the life-cycle of a flagellate monad which happened to be one of the organisms from this source , of which I have succeeded in obtaining pure animal cultures .
I hope to describe cultures of this and other forms in greater detail in a forthcoming paper .
The literature on this subject from a botanical and chemical standpoint will be found in a paper by Dr. Russel and Dr. Hutchison " On the Effect of Partial Sterilisation of Soil on the Production of Plant-Food , " * and it is particularly to this work that we owe the insistence on a hypothesis which is full of interest to the zoologist , namely , that the activity of protozoa in these soils may in many cases be a factor in bringing about soil-sickness .
It is obvious that one of the first steps in the discussion of this problem must be the elucidation of the normal protozoan population of a soil .
