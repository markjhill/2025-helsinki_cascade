" A few remarks on the Helm Wind .
" By the Rev. William Walton , of Allenheads , near Hexham .
Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. On the western declivity of a range of mountains , extending from Brampton , in Cumberland , to Brough , in Westmoreland , a distance of 40 miles , a remarkably violent wind occasionally prevails , blowing with tremendous violence down the western slope of the moun ?
tain , extending two or three miles over the plain at the base , oiten overturning horses with carriages , and producing much damage , especially during the period when ripe corn is standing .
It is accompanied by a loud noise , like the roaring of distant thunder : and is carefully avoided by travellers in that district , as being fraught with considerable da.iger .
It is termed the helm wind ; and its presence is indicated by a belt of clouds , denomisated the helm bar , which rests in front of the mountain , three or four miles west of its summit , and apparently at an equal elevation , remaining immovable during twenty-four or even thirty-six hours , and collecting or attracting to itself all the light clouds which approach it .
As long as this bar continues unbroken , the wind blows with unceasing fury , not in gusts , like other storms , but with continued pressure .
This wind extends only as far as the spot where the bar is vertical , or immediately over head ; while at the distance of a mile farther west , as well as to the east of the summit of the mountain , it is not unfrequently almost a perfect calm .
The author details the particulars of an expedition which be made with a view to investigate the circumstances of this remarkable meteorological phenomenon , and proposes a theory for its explanation .
