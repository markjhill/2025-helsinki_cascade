Report of the Kew Committee for the Year ending October 31 , 1883 .
The operations of the Kew Observatory , in the Old Deer Park , Richmond , Surrey , are controlled by the Kew Committee , which is constituted as follows : Mr. De La Rue , Chairman .
Captain W. de W. Abney , R.E. Prof. W. G. Adams .
Capt. Sir F. Evans , K.C.B. Prof. G. C. Foster .
Mr. E. Galton .
Mr. E. Vice-Adm .
Sir G. H. Richards , C.B. The Earl of Rosse .
Mr. R. H. Scott .
Lieut.-General W. J. Smythe .
Lieut.-Gen .
R. Strachey , C.S.I. Walker .
The Committee regret to announce the decease of their venerable Chairman , the late Sir E. Sabine , K.C.B. , who died on the 26th of June at the very advanced age of ninety-four years and eight months .
Sir Edward was one of the chief promoters of the Observatory , and took a leading part in its direction from its first establishment as a Physical Observatory in 1841 .
Up to within a few weeks of his death he was constant in his inquiries after its condition , although for the last eight years he had been prevented by infirmity from taking an active part in the meetings of its Committee .
The instruments employed for the absolute observations of terrestrial magnetism , " as well as several less important pieces of apparatus used in the regular work of the Observatory , were originally provided by Sir E. Sabine .
To speak of that branch of their late Chairman 's scientific work , with which the Kew Committee has been more particularly concerned , they may say that , in their opinion , the science of terrestrial magnetism owes more to Sir Edward Sabine than to any man who ever studied it , Gauss alone perhaps excepted .
The work at the Observatory may be considered under six heads:\#151 ; 1st .
Magnetic observations .
2nd .
Meteorological observations .
Report of the Kew Committee .
3rd .
Solar observations .
4tli .

I. Magnetic Observations .
The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout the year .
The values of the ordinates of the different photographic curves determined in January were as follows :\#151 ; Declination : 1 inch=0 ' 22',04 .
1 mm.=0 ' 0'*87 .
Bifilar , January 9 , 1883 , for 1 inch \#163 ; H=0*0221 foot grain unit .
, , 1 mm. , , =00004 mm. mgr .
unit .
Balance , January 12,1883 " 1 inch cV=0*0376 foot grain unit .
" 1 mm. " =0*0007 mm. mgr .
unit .
It having been decided to attempt to re-adjust the Bifilar and Vertical Force instruments so as to bring their scales more closely in accordance with the generally adopted values , the necessary alterations were made in the adjustments , and on redetermining the scale values on January 17th the following results were obtained:\#151 ; Bifilar for 1 inch \lt ; 5H=0*0277 foot grain unit .
, , 1 mm. " = 0*0005 mm. mgr .
unit .
Balance " 1 inch BY =0*0261 foot grain unit .
, , 1 mm. " =0*0005 mm. mgr .
unit .
The tabulation of the traces of the three elements was temporarily suspended at the conclusion of the year for which the observations were promised to the International Polar Commission .
Attention is now being devoted to the revision and reduction of the results .
A common gas-jet has been substituted in the* Vertical Force instrument with advantage for that formerly employed , but on trial the results obtained by a similar substitution in the case of the other instruments were not satisfactory , and the old burners with chimneys are retained for the present .
Gelatino-bromide paper has been used for all three instruments with great success and economy of time throughout the whole year , and an examination of the curves shows that not a single hour 's trace has been lost since its adoption , from purely photographic causes , rapid and minute movements of the needles being recorded .
Several magnetic storms have been observed , the principal being that of November 17th and 18th , 1882 , which , together with its accompanying aurora and meteor , excited considerable attention .
Report of the Kew Committee .
Owing to long usage the points of the Dip-needles Nos. 1 and 2 of Circle No. 33 , used for monthly observations , were very blunt ; they were accordingly re-ground by Mr. Dover in August , and the axles at the same time repolished .
The Committee have to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of photographic copies of magnetic curves from the Observatory at Batavia .
The magnetic instruments have been studied , and a knowledge of their manipulation obtained by\#151 ; Dr. Doberck .
Lieutenant A. P. Pinheiro .
Dr. O'Reilly .
Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism , and various data , have been supplied to Dr. Buys Ballot , Padre Denza , the Rev. F. Howlett , M. l'Abbe Philippe , and others .
The Unifilar Magnetometer returned by Rev. S. J. Perry , F.R.S. , on his arrival in this country from Madagascar was lent to Professor W. G. Adams , F.R.S. , for use in the Wheatstone Laboratory , King 's College , London .
Another Unifilar and Dip-circle have been lent to Professor 0 .
Lodge , for use in the University College , Liverpool .
A Dip-circle with bar-magnets has been lent to Dr. E. van Rijckevorsel for use in an expedition to Central America .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been made as usual , and the results are given in the tables forming Appendix I of this Report .
The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations made during the year:\#151 ; Determinations of Horizontal Intensity ... ... 35 " Dip ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 123 , , Absolute Declination ... ... ... .
29 At the request of the Rev. S. P. Ferrari , of the private astronomical observatory on the Janiculan Hill , Rome , the superintendent designed a set of Magnetometers , for eye observations , on a new pattern , much less costly than the Kew magnetographs .
They were erected in the Verification House , and after a satisfactory trial , were dismounted and forwarded to M. l'Abbe Philippe for the Observatory at Lyons .
A set of Magnetographs has been ordered on behalf of the American Government , and is now in process of construction .
II .
Meteorological Observations .
The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of atmospheric pressure , temperature , and humidity , Report of the K Committee .
wind ( direction and velocity ) , sunshine , and rain , have been main-tained in regular operation throughout the year .
A summary of these observations is given in Appendix II .
Owing to the necessity of delaying the construction of the new tabulating scales for the wet bulb thermograph until a somewhat lengthened series of observations had been obtained , the work of tabulation became some months in arrear .
These , however , have now been worked up , and the tabulations are up to date .
The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records have been duly registered during the year , together with the daily observations at 0 h. 8 m. p.m. in connexion with the Washington synchronous system .
Owing to the high quality of the photographic records , the Committee considered that the maintenance of the noon eye observation in addition to that at 0 h. 8 m. was superfluous , and accordingly it was discontinued on July 1st .
The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly carried on , and copies of these , as well as of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine have been transmitted weekly to the Meteorological Office .

With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to , and published by " The Times , " " The Illustrated London News , " " The Torquay Directory , " and " The Torquay Standard , " and data have been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the Report of the Kew Committee .
editor of " Symons 's Monthly Meteorological Magazine , " the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers , Messrs. Banner and Co. , the late Mr. Greaves , and Messrs. Gwilliam , Mawley , Rowland , Dr. Radcliffe , and others .
The cost of these abstracts is borne by recipients .
Tracings of rain-gauge curves have been supplied to Mr. Symons for the months of October , November , and December , 1882 .
Electrograph.\#151 ; This instrument has been in continuous action through the year .
In May it was dismounted from the 16th to the 20th , to allow of structural alterations in connexion with the new stairs .
The tabulation of the curves is at present in arrear , not having been completed beyond February 28 , 1882 .
The portable Thomson Electrometer has not been employed in systematic observations during the year , but has had its scale value experimentally determined , at Mr. De La Rue 's laboratory , for tensions ranging from \#151 ; 1240 to +1030 volts .
Information as to the working of Atmospheric Electrometers has been given to Professor Atwater , of Middleton , U.S.A. , Dr. H. B. Baker , Lansing , U.S.A. , and M. Leon Descroix , of Paris .
III .
Solar Observations .
The sketches of Sun-spots as seen projected on the photoheliograph screen , have been made on 214 days , in order to continue Schwabe 's enumeration , the results being given in Appendix No. II .
The sun 's surface was found to be free from spots on seven of those days .
Solar Negatives.\#151 ; The correction to the area-measurements for foreshortening , which , at the date of the last report , had not been applied to the reductions of sun-spot observations for the last two years of the series , has since been made under Mr. De La Rue 's direction .
The whole series is at the Royal Society , and is now being revised and arranged for reference by Mr. Marth , on behalf of the Council of the Royal Society , who made a grant of money for that purpose .
With the view of utilising the instrument in the transit of Venus of December 5 , 1882 , the Committee obtained the services of Mr. Reynolds , so long associated with Astronomical Photography , who made every preparation for taking a series of pictures of the transit .
The adverse atmospheric conditions which prevailed at the time of the phenomenon , however , prevented any results being obtained .
Dr. Terby , of Louvain , requested a number of photographs , which were selected from the Kew series and sent him on loan .
He has since returned them to the Observatory , having embodied the results 02 Report of the Kew Committee .
of his investigations in a work entitled " Sir l'Existence et sir la Cause d'une Periodic !
te mensuelle des Aurores Boreales .
" Three typical negatives have also been selected , in reply to Professor Pickering 's request , and forwarded to the Harvard College Observatory , to be deposited in the collection of astronomical photographs being formed there by the Director .
At the request of Professor Balfour Stewart , some measurements were made by Mr. Whipple and Mr. McLaughlin , in the Library of the Royal Astronomical Society , Burlington House , of Carrington 's original sun-spot drawings , with a view of checking the accuracy of the values of solar-spotted areas determined at the Observatory in 1866 , and published by Messrs. De La Rue , Stewart , and Loewy in their " Researches on Solar Physics , " second series .
The work has not yet been completed .
Transit Observations.\#151 ; One hundred and fourteen observations have been made of sun-transits , for the purpose of obtaining correct local time at the Observatory ; 224 clock and chronometer comparisons have also been made .
Shelton 's clock , K.O. , has been used as the standard timepiece of the Observatory .
IV .
Experimental Work .
Actinometry.\#151 ; Observations have been made on favourable occasions with the Stewart actinometer on the Observatory lawn , and the results communicated to the Meteorological Council , who defray the cost they entail .
Owing to the rarity at Kew of the occurrence of periods of perfectly clear sky sufficient in duration for a satisfactory experiment with Stewart 's apparatus , the Superintendent has instituted inquiries with a view to obtaining one of Professor Langley 's bolometers for comparison with it .
t Solar Radiation Thermometers.\#151 ; With a view of investigating the causes of the differences in the readings of black bulb thermometers in vacuo , the Superintendent obtained on loan from Messrs. Negretti and Zambra six of these instruments constructed according to his suggestions .
They were after verification arranged on a stand on the Observatory lawn beside the Observatory standard of reference , and read daily during the summer months .
The observations have been discussed , and the results indicate that the discrepancies observed in the readings of this class of instrument are in part to be attributed to want of uniformity in the -sizes of the thermometer bulbs , and also in the amount of lampblack with which they are covered .
Photo-Nephograph.\#151 ; At the request of the Meteorological Council , a series of experiments have been commenced with Captain Abney 's Photo-Nephograph , described in the Report of the Council for 1881 .
Report of the Kew Committee .
Two of the cameras , with their tripod stands , have been received at the Observatory , a base line of 180 yards has been marked off on the level path leading across the park from the Observatory , and a carriage for conveying the battery and reels of wire constructed .
A. code of signals has been arranged to enable the observers at the cameras to work in accordance with each other , and several successful pairs of cloud negatives have been obtained , both on the plates prepared by Captain Abney and also on gelatino-bromide paper .
No steps have yet been taken towards the permanent installation of the apparatus at the Observatory .
Water Surface Temperature.\#151 ; The observations of the maximum and minimum temperature of the surface water of the pond which were taken for the late Mr. Greaves , C.E. , daily at 9 A.M. , were discontinued at his request on May 1 , and the results forwarded to him .
Mr. Greaves applied to the Committee for permission to excavate a tank in the ground attached to the Observatory , in order that continuous registration of water surface temperature might proceed in the immediate neighbourhood of the thermograph .
The Committee , however , were unable to afford him the facilities he desired , the time of the Observatory staff being fully occupied with their existing duties .
Nocturnal Radiation.\#151 ; The experiments on the fall of temperature of the lower layers of the atmosphere at sunset , instituted at the suggestion of Professor Tyndall , were terminated on February 16 , on the resignation of the assistant by whom the readings of the thermometers were made , the grant devoted by the Meteorological Council to the purpose being almost expended .
Graphic Reductions.\#151 ; The Superintendent , having made some experiments on the deduction of mean values , \amp ; o. , from curves by a graphic method , based on Mr. Galton 's composite portraiture* has communicated a paper on the subject to the Royal Meteorological Society , which has been published in the " Quarterly Journal , " vol. ix .
Artificial Horizon.\#151 ; Some experiments have been made with a view of testing an attachment to sextants answering the purpose of an artificial horizon , which has been invented by Mr. T. Tennent , of San Francisco , and constructed by Messrs. Elliott Brothers .
The results appear to indicate that the invention will prove a useful addition to a sextant under certain conditions .
Watcli-rating.\#151 ; The Committee , having decided to make a trial of a system of watch-rating for the public , have granted \#163 ; 100 for the preliminary expenses .
In accordance with a scheme prepared by the Superintendent , they have fitted up at the Observatory a first-class burglar- and fire-proof safe for the safe custody of the watches , and with a view to the obtaining of star-transits , have permitted Mr. Whipple to fit up a temporary transit-house at his residence in the Report of the K Committee .
neighbouring town of Richmond , where he has erected a Sheepshanks ,33-inch transit ( No. 27 ) lent by the Royal Astronomical Society .
I The apparatus used for determining the temperature correction of aneroids is being fitted up to receive the watches for rating them at extreme temperatures , and arrangements are in progress for their reception and delivery at the Meteorological Office by Mr. Strachan , and at the Horological Institute , Northampton Square , by Mr. Britten , the Secretary .
A circular has been drafted , which will be issued to watchmakers on the completion of these arrangements , and it is hoped that operations will be commenced early in the new year .
Pendulum Experiments.\#151 ; Professor 0 .
S. Pierce , of the United States Coast Survey , who made a series of pendulum observations at Kew and elsewhere in 1876 , visited the Observatory in July last , and made a subsidiary series of experiments with a view of determining the flexure of his stand when on the Kew piers , using for the purpose an instrument termed a " noddy .
" Major J. E. Herschel , R.E. , F.R.S. , and Mr. Chaney , of the Standards Department , visited the Observatory and witnessed some of his experiments .
V. Verification of Instruments .
The following magnetic instruments have been verified , and their constants have been determined:\#151 ; 6 Unifilar Magnetometers for Elliott Brothers , London .
2 Dip Circles for Casella , London .
1 Dip Circle for Dover , Charlton .
There have also been purchased on commission and verified:\#151 ; A Unifilar Magnetometer for Professor Brioschi , Naples .
A Unifilar Magnetometer for Professor Ferrari , Rome .

The Committee have recently revised the regulations for the verification of graduated instruments , fixing a linear value equal to 0*01 inch or 0*25 millim. as the limit to which corrections are to be assigned to scales intended to be read by the unassisted eye .
Report of the Ke Committee .
With a view of facilitating the examination of the dark glasses and mirrors of sextants , of which a large number are now tested and marked for makers before mounting in frames , the Superintendent has devised a special apparatus for the purpose , an illustrated description of which appeared in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society " ( vol. 35 , p. 42 ) .
Redeterminations have been made of the angles between the collimators of the Cooke sextant apparatus , which show that they retain their positions with a satisfactory degree of constancy .
The Committee have been offered the loan of the apparatus employed by Mr. J. M. Crafts , of Paris , for the comparison of mercurial thermometers at high temperatures , but have not yet been able to avail themselves of his offer .
Standard Barometers.\#151 ; From time to time comparisons have been made between the two Welsh Standard Barometers and Newman No. 34 , the working Standard of the Observatory , and their relative values have been found to remain unchanged .
Mr. F. Waldo , of the United States Signal Department , being instructed by Major-General W. B. Hazen , Chief Signal Officer , United States of America , to compare the Standard Barometers of Iheir Department with the European Standards , visited the Observatory in July , and made a lengthened comparison of two Standards by Fuess , which he brought with him , with the Observatory Working Standard , Newman No. 34 .
The results of his comparison have not yet been communicated to the Committee , but Dr. Chistoni , of the Italian Meteorological Service , having published in the " Annale della Meteo-rologia " an account of the results of his comparisons of Kew and other Standard Barometers , the Committee desire to publish an abstract of that part of his paper which more especially refers to the Observatory Standard .
Taking the absolute standard barometer of St. Petersburg as the basis f6r his comparisons , Dr. Chistoni finds that the corrections of the Continental standards , referred to this instrument , are as follows :\#151 ; Barometer .

i His first comparison with the Kew Standard was an indirect one , Report of the Kew .
made by means of a Negretti and Zambra 's Standard , No. 1042 , which he found at Pesaro , and which had been compared at Kew in 1877 .
By means of an indirect comparison of this instrument with the Standard , Deleuil No. 6 , at Borne , he found the correction of the latter , so referred to the Kew Standards , to be \#151 ; 0'23 millim. ( _0-009 inch ) .
Subsequently , Professor Tacchini conveyed another barometer directly to Kew , and this when compared with the Boman Standard , indicated the difference between the two instruments to be \#151 ; 0'19 millim. ( \#151 ; 0'008 inch ) .
Prom these two comparisons he assumes the true correction of Deleuil No. 6 to be \#151 ; 0'21 millim. ( \#151 ; 0-008 inch ) .
Having already determined the correction of that instrument referred to the St. Petersburg Standard to be \#151 ; 0*22 millim. ( \#151 ; 0-009 inch ) , he concludes that the two absolute Standard Barometers of Kew and St. Petersburg perfectly agree , and taking into account the possible error of reading the instrument at Borne , " they cannot differ between themselves more than half the tenth of a millim. ( 0002 inch ) .
" With the absolute Standard of the College de France he found the correction of Deleuil No. 6 to be \#151 ; 0'18 millim. ( \#151 ; 0-007 inch ) .
Hence he also concludes that the absolute Standard Barometer of the College de France perfectly agrees with the absolute standards of Kew and St. Petersburg within the limits of the half-tenth of a millim. ( 0"002 inch ) .

I -------Magnetic Observations made at the Kew , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " Long. 0h lra 15s 1 W. , for the year October 1882 to September 1883 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnets N D and N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 84 inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the unit in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 046108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C. G.S. measure are also given .
The value of log 7t2K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at temperature 60 ' F. The induction-coefficient y is 0'000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' F. is 0*0001194(*o-35 ) + 0-000,000,213\amp ; -35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1*0 foot and 1*3 feet , are 1*000075 feet and 1*300097 feet respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction i s=x(1-\#163 ; )""0-oom In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , was determined by the late Mr. Welsh , and has since been carefully verified .
The observations have been made and reduced by Messrs. F. 0 .
