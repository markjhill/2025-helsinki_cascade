The origin of the following experiments was due to observations made in jelly tubes with red phenolphthalein , prepared according to the directions given in Dr. Liipke 's " Elements of Electro-Chemistry , " * being a modification of Sir Oliver Lodge 's original method .
After tracing , for some time , the bleaching progress from opposite ends of the tube , under the electro-motive influence of eight storage cells , the current was stopped and the subsequent bleaching progress was observed from either end .
The ends of the tube dipped respectively into hydrochloric acid and cupric chloride solution , and assuming the original bleaching to be due to hydrogen and to chlorine ions , it appeared probable that the subsequent bleaching was due to the same cause .
The mean relative rates of the ions under electro-motive stress of the battery were\#151 ; H : 01 s : 5*7 i 1 , and the mean relative rates when the current was stopped\#151 ; H : 0 U :5T : 1 .
The actual rates , in the second case , were naturally much slower and closely followed Stefan 's law for diffusion , viz. , distance covered varies as v time .

It occurred to the author that it should be possible to trace an advance motion of hydrogen ions in ordinary diffusion of acids into jellies , if the jellies were suitably prepared as indicators , and thus to illustrate , and perhaps to extend , the theory originally propounded by W. Nernstf and M. Planck .

On Ionic Migration in Natural Diffusion .
The nature of the experiments and their more important results were as follows ( 1904):\#151 ; ( a ) By allowing acids to diffuse into jellies , suitably prepared and tinted with litmus , certain zones appear and become wider as time goes on .
( b ) The foremost zone is in advance of the " diffusion front , " and is well seen in a blue jelly having the following composition , calculated as grammes per cubic centimetre:\#151 ; Gelatine , 0*058 ; KHCO3 , 0*00128 ; KOH , 0*0002 ; Litmus , 0*0008 ; or " 0*06 ; " 0*0006 ; " 0*0002 ; " 0*00084 .
The gelatine was Coignet 's " Gold Medal , " and the " litmus " was simply the ordinary blue extract , twice filtered , and its weight found by evaporating a sample at 100 ' C. in a platinum dish .
This zone ( ad in the tables ) is purple .
It starts from the diffusion front and fades away into blue higher up the tube .
Its growth can be traced approximately ( under good conditions ) until it is 30 mm. long .
( c ) The next zone ( ac in the tables ) is separated from the last by the diffusion front only .
It is observable in the same jellies , and also in jellies containing more potash .
This zone is pale yellowish red , and at first is sharply marked at each boundary .
It widens less rapidly than does the purple zone .
Its back boundary , after about a week , becomes less clearly defined .
( d ) After about 400 hours a third zone appeared in five cases , well behind the yellowish red and separated from it by red litmus , Like the purple zone , this was clearly defined at its back boundary and merged into red at its front .
o e f c a d Fig. 1 .
This zone becomes absolutely colourless .
Its growth was noted from 426 to 760 hours in the cases of N/ 6*51 HC1 , and N/ 6*51 HBr ( p. 370 ) .
Also from 623 to 961 hours in the cases of N/ 5 HC1 , N/ 5 H2S04 and N/ 2 H3SO4 ( p. 378 ) .
The cause of this zone was not understood at the time , but the more recent results with silver nitrate , and also with calcium chloride ( to be given later ) , show that it was probably due to the action of accumulating anions ( Cl , Br , and SO4 ) which had their origin at the concentration difference surface ; in these cases , therefore , the origin was the bottom of the jelly tube dipping into the acid .
2 a 2 Mr. R. G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , As a general result of the other observations it may here be noted\#151 ; ( i ) The foremost purple zone ( ad ) was obtained with hydrochloric , hydro-bromic , sulphuric , nitric , and formic acids .
( ii ) The contiguous yellow-red zone ( ac ) was obtained with HC1 , HBr , H2S04 , and HNO3 , but not with formic acid ; neither could it be obtained with oxalic nor with acetic acid , though these three acids were subject to exactly the same circumstances as were the first four .
The anions of HC1 , HBr , H2SO4 , and HNO3 are , on reacting , all of them bleaching agents , while the other three anions , CH02 , C204 , and C2H3O2 , are not .
The author therefore believes that this yellow-red zone is due to these " bleaching " anions which are left behind when hydrions separate from the advancing diffusion front .
The hydrions themselves , on reacting , produce the purple zone .
( The yellow-red zone never becomes bleached completely , because the action is constantly occurring in fresh litmus .

Experiments on the Diffusion of Acids into Eerric Solutions WITHOUT THE USE OF JELLIES .
The earlier experiments with ferric solutions were made in the following simple apparatus:\#151 ; A tube ( ah in figure ) was fitted to a tap by means of an indiarubber joint .
The ferric solution was drawn up short of this joint , and the lower ( contracted ) end was dipped into the acid as shown , the whole being surrounded by cold water and left for about 20 hours in a room where there was but little change of temperature .
The tube was about 30 cm .
long , and contained just over 5 c.c. After 20 or 24 hours the tube ab was taken out and its contents run out , usually in six portions , into shallow porcelain cups , and there tested with potassium ferricyanide .
At the same time blind experiments were made with other portions of the original ferric solution which had not been subjected to diffusion from the acid , and also with other portions which had been mixed with the same acid during the period of diffusion .
The upper portions of the ferric solution indicated distinct reduction by giving a blue tint .
The following experiments were made :\#151 ; Four experiments with normal sulphuric acid into a dilute ferric chloride solution .
Three experiments with stronger sulphuric into the same solution .
Two experiments with this stronger sulphuric into iron alum solution .
All these showed considerable reduction .
1906 .
] On Ionic Migration Natural Diffusion .
It was found , however , that a slow reduction does take place in all cases where sulphuric acid is used or where iron alum is used with other acids , though the difference in tint showed that greater reduction occurred after diffusion .
Preliminary experiments showed that no reduction occurs when ferric chloride solution is left mixed with hydrochloric acid ; whereas in three experiments with 6N hydrochloric acid diffusing into ferric chloride ( 7'8 grammes per litre ) , distinct evidence of reduction occurred , as also in an experiment with 4N HC1 into the same ferric chloride , and , later still , normal hydrochloric acid into a solution of ferric chloride , containing 1*4 grammes of iron per litre , gave two unmistakable cases where reduction had reached the top of the tube .
Only two experiments gave negative results , and in these the ferric chloride was taken from a bottle in the laboratory which had , for a long time , been in contact with air .
Mr. R. G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , In order to make sure of observing this reduction , the ferric chloride ( hydrated solid ) should be dissolved in distilled water which has been previously well boiled .
The potassium ferricyanide also should be free from dissolved air ; in the later experiments ( with hydrochloric acid and with nitric acid ) the ferricyanide was delivered from a fine nozzle , and one drop only ( = 0-015 c.c. ) was used in each experiment .
In order to experiment with oxidising acids , another form of tube ( fig. 3 ) was employed consisting of a syphon whose longer limb , dipped into the oxidising acid , while the shorter limb , ( with a ground glass tap at c ) , was connected with a burette .
A glass plug e fitting an indiarubber tube made it easy to regulate the exact level of the ferric chloride solution as indicated in diagram by ff .
This syphon ( over 40 cm .
long ) held 9 c.c. from to 2 c.c. to c , and 1*8 c.c. c to d. It was filled completely with the ferric chloride , and the burette completely with wrnter , ab was then placed in a tube containing chromic or nitric acid , c was opened , and the burette tap very carefully turned so as to draw the acid up to about 30 mm. in ab .
After 20 hours or so the acid in its tube was removed ; e was opened , which left the portion ac undisturbed .
The branch ab was repeatedly rinsed with distilled water and the contents of the portion ac were tested .
Distinct reduction was found in every experiment , two with chromic acid and three with nitric acid ; in the two last experiments the nitric acid was 2*7N and the ferric chloride 2'24 grammes of iron per litre .
In all these experiments with acids diffusing into ferric chloride solution there is , therefore , evidence that hydrogen ions advance and cause some reduction of iron from the ferric to the ferrous state .
'(There appeared also to be some evidence of an independent reduction on a smaller scale occurring at the free surface of the ferric chloride solution .
Further experiments on this subject are contemplated .
) 5 .
Three independent investigations , have been attempted which bear on the results cited already .
They were :\#151 ; ( i ) A set of experiments on the nature of the hydrogen occluded by palladium .
These will be extended ; the results up to the present seem to show that this hydrogen on leaving the palladium in purple litmus or red phenolphthalein is accompanied by hydrions sufficient to show acidity , amounting , however , to not more than 3 x 10-7 gramme of " acid hydrogen available from the palladium helix employed .
( ii ) An investigation to ascertain the best conditions for manipulating the erricyanide reaction and to determine the maximum delicacy of the test .
1906 .
] On Ionic Migration in Natural Diffusion .
( iii ) An investigation of the sensitiveness of the litmus reaction\#151 ; as compared with the ferricyanide reaction\#151 ; since on these two reactions the evidence of hydrions advancing in front of diffusion hitherto depends .
( ii ) The Ferricyanide Reaction .
The preliminary results of this investigation went to show\#151 ; ( a ) The blue or bluish green tint actually observed is due to the reaction K3Fe , , , ( CN)6 + Fe"Cl2 = 2KCl + KFe , ,Fe'/ , ( CN)6 . .
" Soluble blue .
" ( b ) The reaction when observed on a surface of porcelain exposed to the air is more delicate in presence of large excess of ferric solution than it is when little or no ferric solution is present .
This result is probably due to the excess of ferric iron obstructing the oxidation of ferrous iron by the air .
( c ) The rapidity of the reaction is greatly increased by admixture of hydrochloric acid , a result analogous to that of acceleration in hydrolysis .
The method of experimenting , in the final work , was as follows :\#151 ; Eather more than a litre of normal hydrochloric acid was kept simmering for an hour and a-half , while pure hydrogen gas was bubbling through .
This was allowed to cool in the hydrogen atmosphere .
Then 24T grammes of iron alum were dissolved in the acid , so that the solution became at once normal hydrochloric and N/ 10 ferric , counted as 0'0028 gramme of ferric iron per cubic centimetre .
Two flasks had been prepared and fitted with short capillaries .
Into the first , A ( fig. 4 ) , a portion of this solution was introduced till it was full to the 435 cubic centimetre mark , while another portion was introduced into the similarly fitted flask B ( to a mark = 426 cubic centimetre ) .
Hydrogen gas was bubbled through each to drive off air from above the mark .
Into the flask A 0*0612 gramme of ferrous sulphate crystal was quickly dropped and was rapidly mixed and dissolved by passing more hydrogen through .
Both flasks were kept closed and , when used , the liquid was slowly forced out of the tube either by hydrogen or nitrogen gas .
The flask A contained finally\#151 ; N.HC1 ( app .
) 1ST / 10 ferric iron \gt ; N/ 1000 ferrous iron J The flask B contained N.HC1 and N/ 10 ferric iron .
Fig. 4 .
Mr. R. G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , Experiments with the two solutions dropped into phials with N/ 10 potassium ferricyanide at once showed very marked colour differences .
But as the test is usually made on porcelain , the volume of each drop as it fell from the capillary under nitrogen pressure was ascertained .
This was 0*095 c.c. ( practically OT c.c. ) , and therefore each drop contained 0*0000028 gramme of ferrous iron from the flask A. A tube with a fine nozzle was made to allow very small drops of the ferricyanide ( N/ 10 ) solution to fall ; each drop corresponded to 0*015 c.c. Thus the volumetric ratios used in all the experiments* were easily calculated with fairly good approximation .
In all the ratios of ferricyanide to ferrous iron ( within very wide limits ) the tints , as compared with the non-ferrous solution , were quite distinct , but the ratio which gave the most marked difference was when the ferricyanide added was ten times that required for the reaction K3Fe ' ' , ( CN)6 + Fe , 'Cl2 - 2KCl + KFe''Fe , , , ( CN)6 .
By mixing one drop from flask A with nine drops from flask B , and then adding the ferricyanide to portions of the mixture and comparing with the non-ferrous solution alone , a distinct green appeared in the former case .
But when the ferricyanide was diluted to become N/ 100 , and added to the now lST/ 10,000 ferrous solution in the same volumetric ratio as was found best before , a very distinct green-blue colour resulted .
Thus , 0*00000028 gramme of ferrous iron , in presence of 1000 times its weight of ferric iron , and 10,000 times its equivalent weight of hydrochloric acid , appeared to show the " soluble blue " very clearly when 10 times its equivalent reacting weight of potassium ferricyanide was added .
( iii ) Sensitiveness of the JReaction .
Approximately pure red litmus had been prepared early in 1905 .
Blue litmus solution , obtained by the action of water on the solid extract , was first mixed with considerable quantities of hydrochloric acid , and then was repeatedly dialysed through parchment paper into large quantities of distilled water , until long after all recognisable traces of chloride had disappeared .
There was practically no passage of litmus through the parchment paper , but there was evidence of osmotic pressure at the parchment surface .
The parchment was stained blue , possibly on account of a polarity change occurring within the material of the parchment .
The purest sample ( " No. 4 dialysed litmus " ) had been largely used already in other experiments .
It appeared to contain 59 times as much red litmus as mineral matter ; this mineral matter consisted of colloidal ferric hydroxide and possibly aluminium hydroxide .
1906 .
] On Ionic Migration in Natural Diffusion .
349 The sample " No. 3 dialysed litmus , " which was used in the present case , contained\#151 ; red litmus : mineral matter : : 17 :1 .
Ten cubic centimetres of this solution contained 0*0055 gramme of solid residue , of which 0*0003 gramme was left after ignition , consisting chiefly of FegOs .
A carefully prepared N/ 10,000 solution of potash ( KOH ) was titrated against this litmus solution .
Five volumes of the potash against one volume of the litmus just gave the full blue coloration .
The litmus solution was now made one-fifth strength , and then it was found that equal volumes of potash and of litmus produced the distinct blue .
It was easy , also , to perform the experiment on porcelain , as in the case of the ferricyanide reaction , and so to obtain strict comparison .
It appears that the litmus and the ferricyanide reactions are of the same order of sensitiveness , both giving obvious colour changes in N/ 10,000 solutions , even when less than a tenth of a cubic centimetre of the solution is placed on a white porcelain surface .
6 .
A Note on Certain Properties of Litmus .
Experiments with the ''No .
4 dialysed litmus " showed\#151 ; ( i ) That it is an electrolyte ( with an anion which , on reacting at the positive platinum electrode , became nearly colourless , as finally did the whole solution ) .
( ii ) That this sample of red litmus will keep in a stoppered bottle for 16 months without apparent change and without any appreciable deposit .
( iii ) That its rate of diffusion into water or jelly is exceedingly slow .
( iv ) ( already cited ) That it dialyses very slowly indeed .
The experiment already cited with N/ 10,000 KOH and " No. 3 dialysed litmus " would suggest that the equivalent weight of red litmus acid is in the neighbourhood of 1000 , but this would involve the assumption that equivalent reacting weights of litmus and of potash are those present , when the blue colour is reached , in these very dilute solutions , and this assumption is not necessarily correct .
However , the facts that litmus ( i ) is an electrolyte and ( ii ) appears to form a true solution are arguments against its being of a colloidal nature , and therefore ( iii ) the exceedingly slow diffusive rate is probably due , partly to its being a very " weak " acid , and partly to its possessing a very high molecular weight .
( " Soluble blue , " on the other hand , is colloidal .
A solution , however dilute , will , on standing for a few days , deposit all colour .

Experiments on the Diffusion of Concentrated Salt Solutions .
( i ) The Diffusion of Sodium Chloride Solution .
It was found that a concentrated solution of pure sodium chloride , after boiling , became slightly alkaline .
To 10 c.c. of this solution five drops of a purple litmus solution were added1 and the mixture was placed at the bottom of a burette , the colour now being a light purple-blue .
To 20 c.c. of distilled water ( previously well boiled ) 10 drops of the same litmus solution were added , and by means of a platinum wire sufficient potash was also added to make the tint identical with that of the salt solution .
The water litmus solution was carefully placed over the salt litmus solution in the burette , which was then corked .
After 23 hours a blue band was noticed just above the contact line , while the top portion of the water litmus became pinker .
In a similar burette a similar experiment was made , in which distilled water was placed above a salt solution which had been previously mixed with a few drops of phenolphthalein .
The phenolphthalein was not reddened by the salt solution , but immediately the distilled water came in contact a pink layer appeared which developed into a band .
These experiments , which in themselves admit of more than one explanation , led to experiments with concentrated calcium chloride and with concentrated silver nitrate solution , the results of which appear to be of sufficient importance to justify a publication of results at this stage .
( ii ) The Diffusion of Concentrated Calcium Chloride Solution .
Almost saturated calcium chloride solution occupied 14 mm. in a test-tube placed in a rather larger graduated cylinder surrounded also by water .
Above it was placed a solution of purple litmus ( the same as was used after dilution in most of the experiments to be described with silver nitrate ) .
After one day five or six long spiky crystals ( CaCl2.6H20 ?
) formed at the bottom of the tube and were visible for three days ( the corked bottle containing the stock solution of calcium chloride , placed close by , gave no crystals ) .
Litmus gradually coagulated as a blue semi-solid deposit and covered these crystals , but left the supernatant solution colourless .
The diagram represents the state of affairs after seven days .
The band boundaries were very sharp indeed , and were accentuated ( as was shown eventually ) by a deposit on the glass .
If the top boundaries of these bands\#151 ; viz. , 41 mm. and 21 mm. , are multiplied by 1*7 , they become\#151 ; 1906 .

33*25 " On analysis , calcium chloride was found to have advanced beyond the bleached band .
These results would imply that some accumulation of chlorine and of calcium ions had reacted ( as shown ) on the litmus .
On removing the solution carefully , no crystals were to be found beneath the deposit of blue litmus .
It would therefore seem that a temporary increase in concentration had occurred at the bottom of the tube , and , if so , this might be accounted for by supposing that the foremost layers of calcium chloride , on diffusing upwards , had , by mechanical reaction , forced back other molecules\#151 ; the phenomenon being somewhat analogous to the evaporation of liquid carbon dioxide , whereby a freer and a less free state ( the solid ) are coincidently produced .
( iii ) The Diffusion of Silver Nitrate Solution .
Crystals of silver nitrate were dissolved in a small quantity of distilled water , and two drops of a purple litmus solution were also added .
This mixture was placed at the bottom of a 50 c.c. measuring tube , and altogether occupied 6*9 c.c. ( fig. 6 ) .
The tint was light pink , and the concentration was subsequently ascertained to have been 0*6689 gramme of AgNOs per cubic centimetre ( nearly a 4N solution ) ( = 3*93N ) .
Some of the same purple litmus was mixed with well boiled distilled water .
This was allowed to drop very slowly ( sliding down the tube ) on to the silver nitrate surface .
A sharp blue line instantly appeared , which soon became convex upward .
The total height reached up to the 30 c.c. mark .
The concentration of the litmus was calculated approximately by subse* Given on p. 95 of Lehfeldt 's ' Electrochemistry , ' ( 1904 , Longmans ) .

Expressed in grammes per cubic centimetre , it was roughly\#151 ; Alkali = 0*000007 , calculated as OH .
Chloride = 0*000008 , " Cl. Mineral matter ( Fe20aAl203 , etc. ) = 0*00006 .
" Organic " matter , including litmus = 0*00009 .
The tube was corked and surrounded by water in a cylinder .
Careful observations were made at intervals from the start of 3 , 28 , 47 , 77,100 , 123 , and 143 hours .
All the readings were taken from the division marks ( in 0*25 c.c. intervals ) of the containing tube ; these readings were subsequently 1906 .

353 translated into millimetre readings , starting from the original 6*9 c.c. mark .
The number 6*9 was subtracted from each reading , and the difference number was then multiplied by 100/ 15 , since 100 mm. happened to be the distance between 15-c.c .
divisions .
One advantage of this enforced correction was to eliminate the influence of personal equation ; moreover , each set of readings was made on a separate sheet of paper with no reference to , or recollection of , previous values . .
The first observation was in itself of a somewhat startling nature , for after the first three hours three very sharply marked bands appeared\#151 ; bright red , blue , and colourless\#151 ; while immediately below the colourless band a deposit of silver was clinging to the glass , and more silver had dropped through the pink nitrate solution to the bottom of the tube .
The blue band , though sharply defined at each boundary ( especially the lower boundary ) , was quite pale blue at its extremities , but near its centre a sharply marked deep blue band appeared .
This deep blue zone persisted in the subsequent observations as the most striking feature in the general appearance .
On translating the readings into millimetres , as explained , it was found that the top of the red , the bottom of the deep blue , and the bottom of the colourless band were distant from the starting point ( 0 mm. ) 40*3 mm. , 22 mm. , and 8*6 mm. , while the top of the silver deposit was about 2 mm. behind .

285*8 154*3 58*3 49*9 The above millimetre readings if multiplied by seven become\#151 ; 282*1 154 60*2 and although no reading was actually recorded of the position of the top of the silver deposit , a diagram was made at the time which would place it at about 2 mm. behind the 8*6 mark .
This would give an approximate value of 6*6 x 7 = 46*2 .
Subsequent observations made it clear that at first the silver deposit , after accumulating to a certain extent , dropped from the lower regions of its deposition on the glass , but that after the point 14 mm. had been reached , the silver ( now less quickly forming ) continued to adhere .
Possibly by a coincidence this point , 14 mm. , was ( in the first reading ) the point marking the top of the bleached band .
From the readings observed after the first three hours it appeared , Mr. R. G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , therefore , that four distinct bands were formed , and were due to reactions caused by ions of hydrogen , OH , NO3 , and silver , and that the top limits of the two positive tracks ( H and Ag ) and the bottom limits of the two negative tracks ( OH and JST03 ) were then in positions , when measured from the concentration-difference-surface , which were directly proportional to the relative velocity of these ions . .
The results of the subsequent observations gave continuous curves for the four bands .
The chief points of interest are\#151 ; 1 .
The rate of movement in the first three hours for all the bands was much greater than in former experiments .
2 .
A considerable concentration difference was maintained , since in the final examination of concentrations it was found that the last 7 c.c. had only fallen in strength from 0'6689 to 04352 gramme of silver nitrate per cubic centimetre .
3 .
The individual movement of the ions ( as indicated by the bands ) was probably due to high osmotic pressure in the silver nitrate , but a secondary influence may have been the attraction of congeries of H ions for OH and of NO3 for Ag .
4 .
In the first observation ( after three hours ) the sharply marked bands were quite close to each other , and here this secondary influence must have been an important factor .
It would appear that a set of sharply defined ( though moving ) fields of potential difference gave rise to the observation .of those division lines which marked , almost exactly , the relative velocities .of H , OH , N03 , and Ag.* 5 .
In the later observations the red and blue bands were less sharply marked and were much further apart ; both also were considerably removed from the source of energy .
The following calculations show that the tops of these two bands and also of the two others were , after 123 hours , at distances from the diffusion start approximately in the ratio of the square roots of the four ionic mobilities .
Calling the square root of the mobility of the silver ion = 100 , the values ( for 1000 L dilution ) become\#151 ; * Subsequent experiments with silver nitrate showed evidence of discharges occurring at certain periods .
In this case it is probable that discharges occurred at about the three-hour period .

Gfreat care was taken in the final syphoning ( performed with a special apparatus ) and in estimating the silver present in the four portions selected .
Standard solutions of sodium chloride N/ 100 and N/ 10 were employed with chromate indicator .
The last portion , 7*25 c.c. of still concentrated AgNO3 , was diluted 100-fold before estimation .
The results show that a very high fall in concentration occurred in the three portions taken from above the original silver nitrate solution .
For whereas the mean concentration of this lowest portion was finally 0'4352 gramme AgNC\gt ; 3 per cubic centimetre = a , that in the next portion ( 10*25 c.c. ) was 0T934 per cubic centimetre = b , that in the next portion ( 4*8 c.c. ) was 0*00618 per cubic centimetre = c , that in the top portion { 7*5 c.c. ) was 0*00024 per cubic centimetre = d ; or b was 1/ 2*25 of a , c was 1/ 31*45 of b , d was 1/ 25*66 of c. These data are insufficient for a curve , but they indicate a geometrically progressive fall , so that the last few cubic centimetres at the top probably approximated to infinite dilution as regards AgNO^ It is interesting to notice that silver nitrate was found in advance of the three lower bands .
( The late-forming bleached band , obtained in the diffusion of HC1 , HBr , and H2SO4 , similarly occurred well within the region which had previously become acid .
) Six further experiments on diffusion of silver nitrate into litmus have been made since this paper was originally communicated , and one parallel .experiment was started on March 23\#151 ; in which " No. 3 " dialysed litmus was used\#151 ; with the same silver nitrate solution .
In this parallel experiment the only apparent result after three hours was a slightly darker red band 2 mm. above the diffusion start , whereas with the common litmus , after three hours , the dark blue ( bottom ) was at 22 mm. and top of red was 40*6 mm. Here after 19 hours the top of this band had risen to 5 mm. ; the band Mr. H. G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , appeared now to be a more concentrated red than the red dialysed litmus above it .
Referring to the curves for the original experiment , it appears that the top of the red should , at 19 hours , have been at 68 mm. It would seem , therefore , that the effects , at any rate in this parallel experiment , were much less marked , and were about 13 times as slow as in the case where litmus containing small amounts of salts was employed .
No silver deposit occurred .
The note made at the time was as follows :\#151 ; " It therefore appears that diffusion will not appreciably occur when water practically free from ionisable matter is used , unless some action other than diffusion previously brings about the introduction of ionisable matter into the water .
" .
I must at this point express my very great indebtedness to Professor Larmor , who , at an exceptionally busy time , not only made many valuable suggestions from the theoretical standpoint , but also examined the work of Planck and of H. Weber , which bears on the subject .
In reference to the results of the parallel experiment just cited I quote from his memorandum the following:\#151 ; On the Theory of Ionic Migration in the Process of Natural Diffusion .
The following theoretical considerations must enter into the interpretation of results of experiments such as those described , of which a complete analysis would appear to be very complex:\#151 ; ( i ) Consider cases of diffusion starting from an initial state which involves no space measurements , e.g. , diffusion between long columns of salt solutions , ionised or not , which are separated initially at an abrupt plane surface .
The theory of physical dimensions requires that , as time goes on , corresponding lengths will vary proportionately to the square roots of the times which have elapsed since the beginning .
( ii ) In all cases of natural diffusion it is a necessary condition that in each part of the volume positive and negative ions must be present in amounts electrically compensating , the very slight volume charge producing the potential gradient , which is involved on Nernst 's theory in all cases of diffusion of electrolytes , being in this connection negligible .
This principle requires , as is known , that when only one electrolyte is present in solution in an absolutely non-ionisable solvent , its two ions must diffuse in company , whether we consider them to be dissociated or free ; but when more than two ions are present they diffuse in virtual independence subject only to electric compensation everywhere in the aggregate .
( iii ) If the liquid into which the ions diffuse is itself of sufficient conducting 1906 .
] On Ionic Migration in Natural Diffusion .
357 power , we can consider each such wandering ion to be electrically compensated by an opposite charge accumulating round it as the result of electrolysis of this liquid , and all electric gradients as thus neutralised ; it is only in such a case that each kind of ion present would diffuse at a rate determined by its own intrinsic mobility alone .
In a very dilute portion of the solution , or with slight diffusion-gradient , proportionately small conductivity of the solvent ( such as the litmus solution infra ) might suffice to realise this state of affairs .
( iv ) When the conductivity of the upper liquid is slight , its ions diffuse down into the lower liquid , just as those of the latter diffuse up .
Thus with impure litmus over AgNOs the H and OH ions travel rapidly down to meet the Ag and NO3 which travel more slowly up ; while with pure litmus there are only Ag and NO3 and the colour effects travel much more slowly , in each case subject to the condition in ( ii ) .
In the following experiments a fresh stock of silver nitrate crystals ( triple crystallisation ) was used .
If a little concentrated solution of this was placed in red dialysed litmus or in purple-red ordinary litmus the solution became blue ; but if a little purple litmus or just blue litmus was placed in the same concentrated silver nitrate solution it became red .
These results , probably depending on the ionisation of the litmus , made it difficult to say if the silver nitrate solution was really acidic , neutral or alkaline , but the results of all the diffusions ( except the last , where nitric acid was mixed with AgNOs ) made it appear that the solution was not acidic , because the rates of band movement in their earlier stages were almost exactly half those of the March 23 experiment and H mobility : OH mobility : : 1 : 0*54 .
In the first of these diffusions ( April 30 ) 9'9 c.c. of 4*76 normal AgNOs diffused into a more concentrated solution of the same litmus as that used in the original experiment ( March 23 ) .
The diffusion was watched for 47 hours only and the curves made out as before .
At the end of three hours the following readings were made:\#151 ; .

Since the tops of the blue and the colourless bands were almost as the ionic mobilities of OH and NO3 , and as their rates were about half those VOL. LXXVIII.\#151 ; A. 2 B 358 Mr. R G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , of the March 23 experiment , it was possible to calculate from the curves that the top of the red ( though faint ) should be at 19*7 mm. Taking this value , the results come out thus\#151 ; mm. Ionic mobilities .

4 x 14= 56 58*3 = N03 In the March 23 experiment all the readings after three hours were multiplied by 7 to give the Kohlrausch values .
The important difference to be noted is that here there was no sharp red band and that the above values were calculated for the tops of the bands , whereas , in the March 23 experiment , the top of red , bottom of deep blue , bottom of colourless , and top of silver deposit were proportional to the Kohlrausch values .
In the present case there was no evidence of sharp discharge occurring at this time , nor in the subsequent observations .
The faint red was probably due to hydrions coming down from the litmus above toward the upward moving hydroxyl .
The further features were very similar to those which will be given in more interesting cases .
Nine sets of readings were taken and the curves were very regular .
The red , having reached a maximum intensity soon after three hours , became fainter and fainter .
After 47 hours the top of blue and top of colourless band were at 57*3 mm. and 34*4 mm. respectively , the ratio being 1 : 0*600 , while mobility OH : 4/ mobility NO3 : : 1 : 0*613 , a result which is in accordance with that in the later stages of the March 23 experiment .
An experiment with the same silver nitrate was started on May 2 into dilute " No. 3 " dialysed litmus made blue by passing it through well washed moist silver oxide , AgaO ; this blue colour , however , soon became grey and finally left a thin film all over the tube above the silver nitrate .
After 18*3 hours there was a fairly well marked yellow-brown band , the top of which was at 41 mm. and the bottom at 35 mm. On referring to the curves of the last experiment ( April 30 ) , at 18*3 hours the top of red was at 42 mm. and the top of blue at 34 mm. , the centre in both cases was at 38 mm. The conclusion drawn was that the top and bottom of this yellow-brown band corresponded to the top of red and top of blue in the previous experiment ( the colour below was strongly brown ) .
The litmus in this experiment was much more dilute than in the previous experiment .

359 nitrate was syphoned off slowly , and fresh 4*76N AgN03 added to reach the 10 c.c. mark .
Then ( May 3 ) very dilute litmus from the March 23 original bottle ( 1/ 50 strength ) was added to reach the 40 c.c. mark on the tube , the whole being surrounded by water in a tall cylinder as before .
The concentration of this litmus ( by analysis of 40 c.c. from the bottle ) was:\#151 ; 0*0058 OH ( alkali ) 0*0072 chloride ( Cl ) 0*048 mineral ( Fe203 , etc. ) f Per litre* 0*085 organic matter , including litmusJ , The results of this experiment are represented in the accompanying chart and the only comments will be in reference to some of the letters given at the bottom :\#151 ; Fig. 8 .

As a general inference it would seem that in this medium of very dilute ordinary litmus solution the products of accunlulated ions only discharge after a considerable lapse of time and that the discharge ( judging from the abnormal movements following and from the rifts formed ) is more acute than 1906 .

361 it was after three hours in the first experiment ( March 23 ) , where the litmus was more concentrated .
The concentration curve for AgN03 , obtained from analysis of eight portions , after 142 hours was very regular , showing a geometrical fall in concentration .
The next diffusion was made with the 4*7 6N AgN03 into litmus l/ 40th instead of l/ 50th of the bottle concentration .
The results of this experiment ( May 20 ) confirmed the inference just made .
No very sharp surfaces appeared and the line showing the top of the blue moved abnormally at the same periods , but in a less marked degree .
After three hours\#151 ; Top of red _ 20 mm. _ 1 Top of blue 11*3 mm. 1 H mobility _ 285'8 mm. _ 1 .QKO When OH mobility " 154-3 mm. " r852 ' The most remarkable point of interest was the formation , after 24 hours , of a black bramble-like aggregation of crystals , exactly resembling those formed at the anode wire when silver nitrate solution is electrolysed in a porcelain dish ( AgaOg ) .
The nucleus of these crystals was due to a minute drop of silver nitrate which touched the perfectly dry surface of the tube on removing the capillary pipette ; the litmus was slowly allowed to trickle down , and , when the small drop was reached , a brown stream of AgaO detached itself from the glass and soon formed minute descending vortex rings ; these stopped at a certain point and moved up as diffusion proceeded\#151 ; till the above mentioned crystals formed and absorbed the brown deposit\#151 ; and then continued to grow , ascending with the strong blue for the next 68 hours .
At 101 hours from the start they were found broken into 16 fragments .
These fragments continued to ascend as long as the observations lasted ( up to 143 hours ) , but the fragments gradually moved apart , some rising well above the deep blue , and others , though still rising , actually taking up positions lower down in the blue .
This result was important because it proved the similar charge ( no doubt negative ) on the fragments causing mutual repulsion , while the actual rise of the cluster and finally of the fragments against gravity for 119 hours would point to a charge repelled upward by the negative N03 following , and at the same time attracted upward by , the positive H still higher up .
It was possible in this case to trace the blue throughout the experiment , since these crystals took the place of the cloud in the former ( May 3 ) experiment .
Streamers appeared also at 100 hours and were observed at 117 and at 143 hours .
362 Mr. R. G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , ( Note.\#151 ; The specific gravity of Ag202 is greater than that of very concentrated silver nitrate solution .
) Since the diffusion in all these cases where the triple crystallised silver nitrate was employed gave the earlier bands approximately with half the velocity of that observed on March 23 , an experiment was started on May 23 in a smaller tube ( 25 c.c. graduations ) , when a little nitric acid was mixed with the AgNC\gt ; 3 solution , 4*5N AgN03 + 0-019N HNO3 being the concentration at the diffusion start .
The chart of these observations is given ( fig. 10 ) .
The litmus was the same as that used in the last experiment .
Here the nitric acid molecules were only 1/ 240 of the silver nitrate molecules .
At first ( after five minutes ) the red band , apparently shaped as in diagram ( fig , 9 ) , drew down blue from the purple litmus ; this blue was soon removed by reaction with the red .
Red only was apparent after one hour .
After five hours an orange-red colour was seen below the top of the red .
After hours the red had reached the top of the liquid in the tube .
The approximately straight line from these observations shows that the top had only just been reached at 21\#163 ; hours .
This distance ( 159*5 mm. ) evidently traversed by the hydrions in this time was far greater than had been the case in any previous experiments , except those of the ferric ch loride red uctions .
Still more rapid colour ^transferences , however , had been obtained by silver nitrate diffusing into litmus containing considerable quantities of potassium nitrate , and there , as in this case , subsequent chemical action had been abnormally great .
( The experiments with potassium-nitrate-litmus are not otherwise cited in this paper .
) The chart ( p. 363 ) will explain most of the phenomena observed during 94 hours .
The hydrions , as shown in chart , would appear to descend from the free surface more rapidly than they went up and to influence the three other ions thus:\#151 ; ( i ) The hydroxyl , which showed by blue tint at the very top , on meeting with the continued stream of hydrions ( from the original HNO3 ) reacted to form water , so that the blue colour was gradually reduced to purple .
( ii ) The NO3 , which showed ( by bleaching ) strongly at 30 hours and still sharply at 47^ hours , reacted with the hydrions to form HNO3 , i.e. , the ions ( H and NO3 ) again were brought into close proximity .

Since blue ( first appearance ) was at 155*5 mm. to 159*5 mm.\#151 ; mm. Sharp top of yellow-red was at 59*1 .

( iii ) The positively charged silver particles , urged upward by the main diffusion and by following negative NO3 , were repelled downward by the returning stream of hydrions and the effect of horizontal strise , resembling cirrus clouds , seen for the first time in these experiments , must have been due to these opposing forces from above and below .
General Remarks on Silver Nitrate Diffusion .
Concentrated silver nitrate solution gives results such as have been indicated above .
The phenomena differ largely according to whether the solution is slightly acid or slightly alkaline , also according to the concentration of the litmus solution and according to the concentration of electrolytes in that solution .
364 Mr. R. G. Durrant .
[ May 2 , The chemical changes which occur when " acid acting " silver nitrate is allowed to diffuse appear to be as follows :\#151 ; + ( a ) Advance hydrions produce litmus acid ( red ) .
( h ) Hydroxyl ions manifest their effects , provided the hydrions are not in considerable excess .
Subsequent analyses show that silver nitrate advances with hydroxyl , and the blue colour gradually degrades through grey-blue to grey , on account of AgaO and , later , Ag202 being formed .
This deposit appeared to be negatively charged .
When nitric acid was mixed with silver nitrate ink the molecular ratio AgNC\gt ; 3 : HNO3 : : 240 :1 , these hydroxyl reactions were not apparent .
* ( c ) NO3 ions , which follow OH , gradually bleach the blue litmus in front ( when hydrions are in excess the red litmus is bleached ) ; the oxidising action of these NO3 ions may also account for the change of brown Ag20 into darker Ag202 evident in the lower portions of the deposit .
+ ( 1 d ) Ag ions readily tend to assume the metallic form , as they are known to be endothermic .
It is probable ( though not yet proved ) that a silver-litmus salt is formed as long as litmus is in the neighbourhood of the deposit .
The first deposit at the bottom of the tube is cherry-red , then chocolate , then brown , and finally dark grey .
When " alkali acting " silver nitrate diffuses , the modifications in phenomena are as follows :\#151 ; ( a ) No advance red appears at first , that which appears later is induced \#151 ; _ + by OH drawing H toward it from the purple litmus above .
( b ) The- early stage of band movement here is almost exactly half as rapid as it is with " acid acting " silver nitrate .
( c ) The hydroxyl effects are much more marked\#151 ; the deep blue degrades more rapidly to brown and finally to black ( Ag202 ) unless , as was the case in one instance , the silver peroxide crystallises .
The main deposit at the bottom is finally much darker .
Otherwise NO3 bleaches as before and silver forms , partly settling as a granular deposit on the glass .
It is highly probable that this silver deposit is positively charged at first though the charge may be rapidly conducted away .
There is , therefore , strong evidence that H , , OH , NO3 and Ag ions accumulate in this order , while at certain critical periods ( depending on the circumstances of concentration and admixture ) these ions produce sharp 1906 .
] On Ionic Migration in Natural Diffusion .
bands whose boundaries , when measured from the diffusion-start , are at distances almost exactly proportional to the known mobilities of the ions .
The author believes that the sharp bands are produced by a balance of forces\#151 ; viz. , those due to osmotic pressure and accumulating charges .
The phenomenon is somewhat analogous to the " flickefing " which occurs when the actual velocity of a mixture of air and coal gas ( due to pressure ) is nearly equal to the explosion velocity , as has been demonstrated by Prof. Smithells .
In this case there is a " flickering " of ions over definite spaces , and therefore local chemical action evidenced by sharply marked effects .
In conclusion I would say that the experiment of May 23 and that of May 3 seem to have some bearing on the effects observed in atmospheric electrical discharge , the effects being slowed down here to a very great extent .
I believe also that the general result , viz. , the demonstration that ionic separation does appreciably take place in natural diffusion , will have some interest for the physiologist , because these conditions are fulfilled in the processes of diffusion in the body .

In the next four tubes\#151 ; H , IT , I , I'\#151 ; the following mixture was used :\#151 ; Ten grammes gelatine , 130 c.c. water , 10 c.c. neutral litmus , 0*3 gramme KHCO3 , the whole kept below 70 ' C. and filtered .
The same acids and of the same strength were allowed to diffuse , using 25 c.c. of the acid in each case .
In no case did a band ac ( yellow-red ) appear until after 110 hours .
Nine observations were made for each tube , extending over 426 hours .
The band ad ( due to hydrogen ) was seen at once , and grew regularly from 4 mm. to 26 mm. for the N/ 2T7 acids and from 5 mm. to 25 mm. for the acids of 1/ 3 of the concentration ( N/ 6'51 ) .
After 141 hours in each case a band ac was observed which , though it became more distinct as time went on , did not grow appreciably .
It widened from 4 mm. to 5 mm. only with the N/ 2T7 acids and from 4 mm. to 6 mm. with the acids of 1/ 3 concentration .
The mean diffusion constants were\#151 ; N/ 2-17 HC1 , 6-55 , N/ 2T7 HBr , 6-65 , N/ 6-51 HC1 , 4*85 , N/ 6*51 HBr , 4 65 , whence the ratio of diffusive rates for the HC1 N/ 2*17 to N/ 6'51 were T35:1 , and for the HBr N/ 2*17 to N/ 6'51 , 1*41 : 1 .
Details of the tubes I and I ' are given on next page , and show the further formation of bands , which began to appear after 426 hours .
As the actual weight of litmus was not known in the H and I tubes , a third set of tubes , J , J ' , K , K ' , were filled with the following mixture , calculated for 1 c.c. of the jelly : Gelatine , 0*0666 ; KHCO3 , 0*00066 ; litmus , 0*0006 .
This solution was purple and did not show the band ad .
The four tubes were watched for 159*5 hours , seven readings each .
The band ac showed at once , increasing regularly .
It was of the same dimensions for HC1 and HBr throughout , and in the 1/ 3 concentration kept almost exactly 1 mm. wider than in the stronger acids .
Tables appended on p. 371 .
As the result of 76 readings of these 12 tubes in which the diffusion constants ( ab ) were taken\#151 ; half for HC1 and half for HBr\#151 ; it seemed worth while to compare the results , allowing for differences of the mean temperatures during the periods of observation .

It would therefore appear that the diffusion constant for HBr is slightly less than for HC1 .
Taking the mean readings ( each representing 19 observations ) and calling the diffusion rate of HC1 == 100 , the results are\#151 ; For N/ 2*17 acids ... .
HC1 = 100 , HBr = 99*42 .
" N/ 6*51 " ... . .
HC1 = 100 , HBr = 98*64 .
It would also appear that the diffusion constant for HBr is reduced by dilution rather more than is the case with similarly diluted HC1 .

] On Ionic Migration in Natural Diffusion373 It will be seen that the H2S04 behaved in a similar way as regards formation of bands\#151 ; the band ac being better marked than with HC1 .
This band , on the theory of ionisation , would be due to the ion S04 bleaching by oxidation .
In order to see if the band ac is only produced in cases where by theory an ion capable of bleaching is produced , the tubes J , J ' , K , K ' , were inverted and tested simultaneously with normal solutions of HC1 , H2S04 , oxalic and acetic acids .
Though these two last acids are believed to ionise slightly* their ions , C204 and C2H302 , would not be oxidisers .
In neither case did any band corresponding to ac appear .
The observations , give the relative diffusive rates .
The tubes were now called Q , E , S , and T ( see p. 374 ) .
In order to find the best proportions of ingredients for showing the bands ac and ad , several jellies were prepared\#151 ; the ingredients were calculated as weight per 1 c.c. Grelatine .

It appears from these comparative experiments in " a " jelly\#151 ; ( i ) That the purple hand ad was independent of the nature of the acid 1 and of its concentration\#151 ; indeed the readings for N/ 2 H2S04 were less than j for N/ 5 H2SO4.* ( ii ) That the yellow-red hand ac was apparent in all the acids except | formic acid ( whose ion , CHO2 , is non-bleaching ) .
( iii ) That addition of ammonium chloride to N/ 5 HC1 , to an extent \ equivalent to making it a 4 N solution as regards chloride , increased the 2 diffusion rate in the ratio of nearly 3 : 2 .
Arrhenius has previously shown | that with very concentrated ammonium chloride the rate may be increased * as 2'24 :1\#151 ; and the result is believed to be due to the higher concentration fl of hydrions , NH4CI = NH3 + H + Cl occurring to a certain extent.f ( iv ) Comparing the N/ 5 acids only , the relative diffusion rates come out # : HC1 , 100 , HN03 , 96-7 , H2SO4 , 81*6 , formic acid , 64-5 .
* Although the band ad seemed rather shorter with N/ 2 than with N/ 5 H2S04 , the : * total distance bd was considerably greater , and again was almost identical with the jH distance bd for N/ 5 HC1 .

377 ( v ) It would seem that an H/ 2 H2S04 solution becomes , in the jelly tube , approximately " isohydric " with an 1ST/ 5 HC1 solution .
A seventh determination with H/ 2 H2S04 was made , at the same time , in which the acid was placed in a wide tube above the jelly , the tube being corked .
The object of this determination was to see if by any chance the , purple band ad , hitherto assumed to be due to hydrions , was really due to C02 ascending .

The diffusive rate appears to be slightly increased , but otherwise to be identical in its phenomena .
It is highly improbable , if carbonic acid gas is set free from the bicarbonate used in these experiments , that this gas would act to form the purple band equally whether it ascends or descends .
After a further interval these tubes with the " \#171 ; " jelly were examined , and the late forming bleached band began to develop in the H/ 5 HC1 , H/ 5 HC1+AmCl , H/ 5 H2S04 , and H/ 2 H2S04\#151 ; but not in the H/ 5 formic acid .
In the case of the H/ 5 HHO3 the lower part of the jelly dissolved so that observations were impossible .
In the H/ 5 HCl + AmCl tube , though the band was observed after 623 hours , later on a gas was formed which forced the jelly out from the lower end of the tube .

The chief interest attaching to these observations taken on the 26th , 33rd , and 40th day after the diffusion was started is\#151 ; ( i ) The N/ 2 H2SO4 continued to keep pace with the N/ 5 HC1 .
( ii ) The lower , sharply-marked boundary of the bleached band e made its first recorded appearance at points nearly identical in each case , \#151 ; for N/ 5 HC1 at 90 mm. , for N/ 5 H2SO4 at 90 mm. , for N/ 2 H2SO4 at 88 mm. , from the bottom of the tube .
( iii ) The progress of this point e , however , varied , and its position after the 40th day ( 961 hours ) was for N/ 5 HC1 at 127 mm. , for N/ 5 H2SO4 at 104 mm. , for N/ 2 H2SO4 at 114 mm. , from the bottom of the tube .
If , as it has been already suggested , this late forming bleached band is due to the anions Cl and SO4 , then the rates of progress here observed are what would be expected , because SO4 is known to have a lower mobility than Cl. The table due to Kohlrausch and Holborn , and given on p. 102 in Lehfeldt 's " Electro-Chemistry , " shows that the relative molecular conductivities for HC1 and H2SO4 at 200 L dilution ( 18 ' C. ) are\#151 ; HC1 : H2SO4 : : 1 1*77 , or HC1 : \#163 ; H2S04 : : 1 : 0-885 .

379 The values for e on the 40th day for N/ 5 HC1 and for N/ 2 H2S04 were 127 mm. and 114 mm. , or\#151 ; HC1 : \#163 ; H2S04 : : 1 : 0'898 .
This comparison is made on the assumption that the 1ST/ 5 HC1 and the IST/ 2 H2S04 became , in the jelly tubes , practically isohydrie , because their diffusion rates were equal .
If this was the case , then the movement of the anions Cl and S04 in the dilute acid jelly would be equally affected by the movement of the hydrions also present , and thus the progress of the anions would be comparable .
A number of experiments ( not all cited ) were made with litmus jellies not containing salts other than those in the jelly and litmus employed .
In these experiments there was hardly any appearance of the bands ad and ac .
This npn-appearance would seem to be in keeping with the conclusions arrived at by Walker , McIntosh , and Archibald :\#151 ; * .
The conclusion we feel justified in drawing from these observations is that in at least a great number of cases , if not in all , combination with the solvent is the necessary precursor of ionisation , although such combination does not necessitate ionisation .
" Conclusions .
The results as given in the present paper would appear to afford a considerable body of data tending to support the theory of Nernst and Planck .
So far as the author is aware , the method of studying band boundaries has been almost entirely confined to experiments in which batteries have been employed , as in the work of Orme Masson and of Steel .
The earlier experiments in jellies and the later experiments with silver nitrate and calcium chloride show that very fairly sharp bands are obtainable without batteries .
The evidence goes to show that hydrogen ions move in advance of the diffusion front , whereas other ions produce thief various " effects " in the rear of the diffusion front .
