" Research on the Smallpox of Sheep .
" By E. Klein , M.D. , Assistant Professor at the Laboratory of the Brown Institution , London .

Variola ovina , or smallpox of sheep , is a disease which , although it is not communicable to man , and possesses a specific contagium of its own , very closely resembles human smallpox , both as regards the development of the morbid process and the anatomical lesions which accompany it .
This correspondence is so complete , that it cannot be doubted that the pathogeny of the two diseases is the same .
The present investigation was therefore undertaken in the confidence that the application of the experimental method to the investigation of the ovine disease would not only yield results of value , as contributory to our knowledge of the infective process in general , but would throw special light on the pathology of smallpox .
The paper consists of four sections .
In the first , the author gives an account of his experimental method , which consisted in communicating the disease by inoculation to a sufficient number of sheep , and in investigating anatomically ( 1 ) the pustules produced at the seat of inoculation , and ( 2 ) those constituting the general eruption .
The lymph employed was obtained by the kindness of Prof. Chauveau , of Lyons , and Prof. Cohn , of Breslau .
In the second section , the organisms contained in fresh lymph , and the organic forms derived from them by cultivation , are described .
The author finds that fresh lymph contains spheroidal bodies of extreme minuteness , which correspond to the micrococcus of Hallier and to the spheroids described by C.ohn and Sanderson in vaccine lymph .
It also contains other forms , not previously described , which in their development are in organic continuity with the micrococci .
The third section contains a complete anatomical description of the skin 1874 .

of the sheep , with special reference to those particulars in which it differs from that of man .
The remainder of the paper is occupied with the investigation of the changes which occur in the integument at the seat of the inoculation , and with the anatomical characters of the secondary pustules .
The most important results are the following :\#151 ; 1 .
The development of the primary pock may be divided into three stages , of which the first is characterized by progressive thickening of the integument over a rapidly increasing but well-defined area ; the second , by the formation of vesicular cavities containing clear liquid ( the " cells " of older authors ) in the rete Malpighii ; the third , by the impletion of these cavities with pus-corpuscles and other structures .
It is to be noted that the division into stages is less marked than in human smallpox .
2 .
The process commences in the rete Malpighii and in the subjacent papillary layer of the corium\#151 ; in the former , by the enlargement and increased distinctness of outline of the cells , and by corresponding germi-native changes in their nuclei ; in the latter , by the increase of size of the papillse , and by germination of the epithelial elements of the capillary blood-vessels .
3 .
It is next seen that the interfascicular channels ( lymphatic canali-culi ) of the corium are dilated and more distinct ; that the lining cells of these channels are enlarged and more easily recognized than in the natural state ; and that , in the more vascular parts of the corium , the channels are more or less filled with migratory , or lymph , corpuscles .
At the same time , the lymphatic vessels , of which the canaliculi are tributaries , can be readily traced , in consequence of their being distended with a material which resembles coagulated plasma .
4 .
About the third day after the appearance of the pock , the contents of the dilated lymphatics begin to exhibit characters which are not met with in ordinary exudative processes .
These consist in the appearance , in the granular material already mentioned , of organized bodies , which neither belong to the tissue nor are referable to any anatomical type\#151 ; viz. of spheroidal , or ovoid , bodies having the characters of micrococci and of branched filaments .
These last may be either sufficiently sparse to be easily distinguished from each other , or closely interlaced so as to form a felt-like mass .
5 .
The process , thus commenced , makes rapid progress .
After one or two days , the greater number of the lymphatics of the affected part of the corium become filled with the vegetation above described ; and on careful examination of the masses , it is seen that they present the characters of a mycelium , from which necklace-like terminal filaments spring , each of which breaks off , at its free end , into conidia .
In most of the filaments , a jointed structure can be made out , and , in the larger ones , the 390 Dr. E. Klein on the Smallpox of Sheep .
[ June 18 , contents can be distinguished from the enclosing membrane by their yellowish-green colour .
6 .
At the same time that these appearances present themselves in the corium , those changes are beginning in the now much thickened rete Mal-pighii which are preparatory to the formation of the vesicular cavities already mentioned .
By a process which the author designates horny transformation , having its seat in the epithelial cells of the middle layer of the rete Malpighii , a horny expansion , or stratum , appears , lying in a plane parallel to the surface , by which the rete Malpighii is divided into two parts , of which one is more superficial , the other deeper than the horny layer .
Simultaneously with the formation of the horny layer the cells of the rete nearest the surface of the corium undergo very active germination , in consequence of which the interpapillary processes not only enlarge , but intrude in an irregular manner into the subjacent corium .
At the same time , the cells immediately below the horny stratum begin to take part in the formation of the vesicular cavities , some of them enlarging into vesicles , while others become flattened and scaly , so as to form the septa by which the vesicular cavities are separated from each other .
7 .
The vesicles , once formed , increase in form and number .
Originally separate , and containing only clear liquid , they coalesce , as they get larger , into irregular sinuses , and are then seen to contain masses of vegetation similar to those which have been already described in the lymphatic system of the corium\#151 ; with this difference , that the filaments of which the masses are composed are of such extreme tenuity , and the conidia are so small and numerous , that the whole possesses the characters of zooglsea rather than of mycelium .
However , the author has no doubt that these aggregations are produced in the same way as the others , viz. by the detachment of conidia from the ends of filaments .
In the earlier stages of the process the cavities contain scarcely any young cells .
Sooner or later , however , so much of the rete Malpighii as lies between the horny stratum and the papillae becomes infiltrated with migratory lymph-corpuscles .
The process can be plainly traced in the sections .
At the period of vesiculation , i. e. at a time corresponding to the commencement of the development of the vesicles in the rete Malpighii , the cutis ( particularly towards the periphery of the pock ) is infiltrated with these bodies .
No sooner has the coalescence of the vesicles made such progress as to give rise to the formation of a system of intercommunicating sinuses , than it is seen that the whole of the deep layers of the rete Malpighii become inundated ( so to speak ) with migratory cells , which soon find their way towards the cavities , and convert them into microscopical collections of pus-corpuscles , the formation of which is proved to be due to migration from the corium , not only by the actual observation of numerous amoeboid cells in transitu , but by the fact that the corium itself , 1874 .

391 before so crowded with these bodies , becomes , as the pustulation advances , entirely free from them .

The concluding section of the paper is occupied with the description of the secondary eruption , the anatomical characters of which very closely resemble those which have been already detailed .

( Abstract .
) Maps of the spectra of calcium , barium , and strontium have been constructed from photographs taken by the method described in a former communication ( the third of this series ) .
The maps comprise the portion of the spectrum extending from wave-length 3900 to wave-length 4500 , and are laid before the Society as a specimen of the results obtainable by the photographic method , in the hope of securing the cooperation of other observers .
The method of mapping is described in detail , and tables of wave-lengths accompany the maps .
The wave-lengths assigned to the new lines must be considered only as approximations to the truth .
Many of the coincidences between lines in distinct spectra recorded by former observers have been shown , by the photographic method , to be caused by the presence of one substance as an impurity in the other ; but a certain number of coincidences still remain undetermined .
The .question of the reversal of the new lines in the solar spectrum is reserved till better photographs can be obtained .

In many diseased conditions of the body , occasionally also in perfectly healthy individuals and in many of the lower animals , careful investigation of the blood proves that , in addition to the usual elements , there exist pale granular masses , which on closer inspection present a corpuscular appearance ( Plate V. fig. 1 ) .
There are probably few observers in the habit of examining blood who have not , at some time or other , met with these structures , and have been puzzled for an explanation of their presence and nature .
