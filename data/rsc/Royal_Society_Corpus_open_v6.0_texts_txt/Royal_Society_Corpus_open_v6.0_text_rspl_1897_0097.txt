202 Anniversary Meeting .
following particulars The borehole is , roughly speaking , rather over 100 yards from the margin of the ocean , and about 165 yards from that of the lagoon ; it is about 240 yards from the spot where a sounding of 10 fathoms was obtained , nearly 400 yards from a 66-fathom sounding , and rather more than a quarter of a mile from one of 130 fathoms .
After this the submarine slope , for a considerable depth , is not quite so steep .
He also states that , at Funafuti , the vigorous growing portion of the reef appeared to be limited to within about 40 feet of the surface .
It would be premature , as Professor David remarks , to express an opinion as to the theoretical bearing of these results until the core has been thoroughly studied .
But two things seem clear , ( 1 ) that true reef has been pierced at depths down to more than 600 feet , and ( 2 ) that throughout the whole of the time represented by the mass which has now been tested , coral must have grown in great abundance in some part or other of the locality now represented by Funafuti ; for the atoll , it must be remembered , is surrounded by water about 2,000 fathoms deep , what would completely isolate it from any other coralliferous locality .
