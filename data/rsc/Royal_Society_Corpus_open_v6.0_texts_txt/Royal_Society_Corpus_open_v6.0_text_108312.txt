Theorem .
IF u be a function of x and y satisfying the equation d2u where ddy ce= 0 then the solution will be u=D , die where Dd -e-7 , where v=J , e AXydy +4 Xy and 4x arbitrary functions ofy and x , and and Pn=(Aa- , -c)( are _nc ) ... .
where A ?
r= a,.+-a and an is a function of n vanishing for n=O and for n= --1 .
I will proceed to demonstrate this curious theorem as briefly as possible .
According to the notation , we may write the given equation du D d+oU=0o Then if vn=D"u we have v+i.=Dn+'u=Dv , .
Suppose that D+zDvn=Dn{ + 4 ... .
( a. ) where z is a function of x and y to be determined , also P3n a function of u. Writing n+1 for n in equation ( a. ) , we ought to have D dl +Pn+ zDv++=D+lD d.+. .
( .
) dx TXj This circumstance will serve to determine z and P , as follows : we have identically +1{du +o+u}D+'{ dC u }aDn+1u D 'D + =D +tD + anuf + AanD+ -D2 d +P3D zDvI n+ An. Dv , by ( m ) dv D2:+InD tzv1+A^. .

un +1 .
But = dDvndye dd day die d dv ed dvedp dvy =d Dvn+D dv ; D2n D J+dv1+ +v + Hence D +D ( un +)+D(z )+Anv .
ought to be identical with D+ j3+zDv , +t , , and hence the conditions dp~ T +PnZ=PIn3iz D{ +0z}-A .
Eliminating z , we have d^ Aa !
, apn D n-~ ^ =--c , or die +ce Q=o , a_ Aan and c3+'-=A , { , + +-3J , or n^A^X a , ,I .
Aa , -2 ... .
Pn ( A=ian , -c)(a~_-2-C ) ... .
: by these determinations we establish the formula ( 3 .
) as a consequence of ( a. ) , and therefore if the formula ( a. ) be true for any value of n , it will be ( subject to the above conditions ) true for the next superior value .
Now , when n=O , ?
o=D ?
u=-u , and provided c and a_ , are each =0 , % and Ac_ , will be each 0 , and. .
co and 30 each =0 , and the equation ( a. ) reduces to D du --=D- , and is therefore true for u=O .
Under these restrictions it will therefore be d true for any positive integral value of n. Now the symbol D represents e , and therefore if U=O , D"U=O , so that we have dv , D ~ : +P , zDv=-O,.dVn , _O d_ -ddv_ 0r e dxdy + An , d ~dy= d dv , dx die _n dp or dT dx ' dv , die . .
integrating with respect to x , dv , n -ALp =e Agn -e ny vn=f e ^n idy+^x , and u=Dvf of e. .
dydy ... .
the integral sign repeated n times .
The theorem is therefore demonstrated .
It may be easily shown that the equation of LAPLACE'S coefficients is included in the class here considered .
The equation of LAPLACE by a proper choice of independent variables assumes the form d2u n.n+ 1 dxdy +co"Y-xu 2 Hence with reference to the preceding investigation , y-x d , n.n+l D=cos2Yd an 2 '~and -4 Hence e---cos 2y-x 2 dq t y-x dp -tan dx 2 d ; + eO=O .
dxdy 21n +1 Hence c= , Also Ac= j- ; A -c=.n=n and A-P , =l .
Inserting these values in the final formula , we have vn=cos2 Y ydy + x , and ucos-2 Y-J fcos-2Y j ... .
v , dydy ... n times , which agrees with Mr. HARGREAVE'S solution .
