Radium is known to emit three types of radiation .
These are\#151 ; ( 1 ) The a rays , very easily absorbed by solids , and carrying a positive electric charge .
( 2 ) The / 3 rays , more penetrating than these , and negatively charged .
( 3 ) The y rays , intensely penetrating , and not conveying an electric charge at all .
In a paper published in the 'Phil .
Trans.'for 1901 , I investigated the relative ionisations of gases by the a and ( 3 rays .
The present communication may be regarded as a sequel to that one , and deals with the y rays .
The radium employed was of activity 1000 ( uranium = 1 ) , and was contained in a glass cell , over which was cemented a piece of thin aluminium .
The cell was placed in a cavity in a block of lead , and over it was placed a disc of lead 1 cm .
in thickness .
This it was considered would suffice to suppress all but the y rays , which are much the most penetrating .
In measuring the electrical leakage , the electroscope method was employed .
The apparatus was that described in a paper published in the 'Philosophical Magazine ' for June , 1903 , p. 681 .
The radium , covered by the thick lead , was placed under the apparatus , and the rate of leak determined when the different gases filled the testing vessel .
The conditions were , of course , arranged so as to use a saturating E.M.F. The y rays are so penetrating that there can be no question of their being appreciably absorbed in a moderate thickness of gas .
For the methods of preparation of the gases I must refer to the former paper.* The results were as follows ; the rates of leak are given in scale divisions per hour , and are corrected to 30 inches pressure :\#151 ; * 'Phil Trans. , ' A , vol. 190 , 1901 , p. 508 .

5 -31 5-34 5-83 5-67 45-3 The determinations for the y rays are less accurate than the former ones for the a and / 3 rays , on account of the very much smaller rates of leak which have to be measured .
I think , if this be taken into account , , there is no reason to doubt that , within the limits of experimental error , the y rays give the same values as the fi rays .
These values are nearly proportional to the density of the gas , except in the case of hydrogen .
The law which holds in the case of Rontgen rays is totally different .
This conclusion throws some light on the nature of the y rays .
The view seems to be gaining ground that these are Rontgen rays , produced by the impact of the / 3 rays on the radium itself.* This theory seems * See , for instance , Madame Curie , 1 Theses presentees a laFaculte des Sciences , ' 1903 , p. 83 .

[ Aug. 5 , to have much to recommend it .
The rays should , by analogy with the cathode rays in a vacuum tube , produce Rontgen rays when they strike a solid obstacle , and these Rontgen rays should be much more penetrating than the ft rays themselves .
The y rays seem at first sight to be just what should be expected .
But the present paper shows that in one respect , at all events , the y rays behave quite differently to Rontgen rays , while , on the other hand , they resemble the a and ft rays .
There seems to be a possibility that they too are of a corpuscular nature , though uncharged with electricity .
This would account for the absence of magnetic deflection I do not think that the absence of conspicuous Rontgen radiation is very hard to understand , if we consider that the current emitted in cathode rays by a square inch of intensely active radium is only 10~u amperes ; the current through a focus tube is of the order 10-2 amperes , and probably a great part of this is carried by the cathode rays .
