[ June 10 , These experiments show that in enclosed spaces , when there is little or no aerial commotion , the number of suspended organisms is very moderate , but as soon as any atmospheric disturbance is occasioned either by draughts or by the moving about of people , the number rapidly rises , and may become very large indeed .
This is a fact very familiar to all who have had much experience in the cultivation of micro-organisms , and it is of particular importance in connexion with the process of plate cultivation with gelatine .
The experiments made in the railway carriage afford a very striking example of the enormous number of micro-organisms which become suspended in the air when a large number of persons are crowded together .
In my own laboratory , where every care is taken to prevent the circulation of dust , the number of organisms did not amount to more than 13 in 10 litres , and of the comparative purity of this air I have had the most abundant evidence in the almost inappreciable amount of aerial contamination which is exhibited by the plate cultivations prepared there .
In conclusion , I have to express my thanks to the Deans of St. Paul 's and Norwich , General Festing , Professor Flower , Dr. Theodore Williams , and Mr. F. E. Colenso , through whose courtesy I have been enabled to carry out many of the experiments recorded in the above paper .
I must also acknowledge the valuable help which I have received from my assistant , Mr. Hart , A.R.S.M. , who is now proceeding with these investigations , the results of which we shall hope to have the honour of communicating later .

In a previous communication " On the Removal of Micro-organisms from Water " ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 38 ( 1885 ) , p. 379 ) , I had occasion to point out the extraordinary rapidity with which micro-organisms may become multiplied even in ordinary distilled water .
It was there shown that if a few drops of diluted urine-water be added to ordinary distilled water and kept in a sterilised bottle plugged with sterilised cotton-wool , the number of micro-organisms remaining suspended in the water became multiplied in the following manner : 1886.7 On the Multiplication of Micro-organisms .

48,100 These numbers represent the number of micro-organisms found in the upper layers '\#169 ; f the water without agitating the contents of the bottle .
More recently -this subject has been touehed upon by Dr. T. Leone ( " Gazzetta Chimica Italians , " xv , 385 ) , who found that the micro-organisms present in the water supplied to the city of Munich became multiplied in the course of five days from 5 per cubic centimetre to upwards of half a million in the same volume of water .
As this subject is one which is of much importance , from many points of view , I have carried onto , number of experiments with the object of throwing some light upon these phenomena .
Methods of Experiment .
The number of micro-organisms present in the liquids employed was determined by means of Koch 's method of plate cultivation with gelatine peptone .
The apparatus used was substantially the same as that described in my previous paper ( Zoc .
cit. ' ) , a few modifications of the process having , however , been since then introduced .
The sterile plates are now plaeed upon a levelled glass slab , resting upon a dish containing iced water , and covered with a glass shade , the latter being'momentarily raised whilst the inoculated and fluid gelatine is poured upon the plate .
With this arrangement the solidification of the gelatine is almost instantaneous , and the plate can be at once transferred to the moist chamber for ( incubation , thus enabling the preparation of a very-much larger number of plates in a given time than was .formerly possible , when the rate of solidification of the gelatine was dependent upon the temperature of the room .
Instead of a solution of mercuric chloride in the moist chamber , I now simply employ sterilised distilled water , as I have found that the presence of the mercuric*chloride in the moist chamber may exercise a prejudicial effect *upon the full development of the colonies on the plate .
When these modifications of the process are carried out with care in a room in which the distribution of dust is scrupulously avoided , the aerial contamination is altogether insignificant , but the process should in all cases be checked by pouring blank plates , in order to ascertain whether the precautions employed have been adequate or not .
When , however , sufficient experience has been acquired in the management of the process , the preparation of these blank plates becomes rather a matter of form than of any practical importance , nevertheless when mixtures 52$ Dr. P. F. Frankland .
[ June 10 , of organisms and not pure cultivations are being dealt with , it is a check which should on no account be neglected .
Scope of the Experiments .
The bacteriological examination by plate cultivation of a large number of natural waters showed that practically all waters contain micro-organisms in greater or less abundance , but that the number found in such natural waters varies within exceedingly wide limits .
Thus whilst the number found in the rivers Thames and Lea usually amounts to thousands in the cubic centimetre , that found in certain deep well-waters , which I have had under continual observation , rarely exceeds ten in the same volume .
It appeared to me , therefore , of interest to study the further history of the organisms present in these waters of different origin and character .
In the second part of the paper will be found a description of a number of experiments made upon the power of multiplication possessed by certain pathogenic organisms , when placed under similar conditions .
I. Experiments with Micro-organisms present in Natural Waters .
The waters which were made the subject of study are those supplied by the eight Metropolitan Companies to London , and which for various reasons are well adapted for purposes of experiment .
Firstly , they include waters derived from various sources , viz. , from two different rivers\#151 ; the Thames and Lea\#151 ; and from deep wells in the chalk ; secondly , their chemical composition is well known , and is made the subject of a very complete monthly investigation ; and thirdly , their biological character has now been under periodical observation for eighteen months past .
Micro-organisms in Crude River-water .
Samples of unfiltered river-water ( temp. 2 ' C. ) collected in sterile stoppered bottles were submitted to plate cultivation the day after collection , whilst duplicate samples were allowed to stand at a ternperature of about 20 ' C. for five days , and then similarly examined .

[ June 10 , Thus in the one case there is a slight diminution in the number , and in the other case increase ; but in neither is the alteration very considerable .
Similar samples collected on the 19th February , 1886 , .were examined after exposure to various conditions , as specified on p. 528 .
Further experiments were made with a view of testing this behaviour of the micro-organisms present in river-water .

From the experiments made with these river-waters , it would appear that there is a decided tendency for the micro-organisms which they contain to become reduced in number when the waters are kept at the ordinary temperature of the air ( 20 ' C. ) , whilst the numbers may be temporarily enormously increased by exposing them to an incubating temperature .
A very large number of experiments was also made with the filtered river-waters , as supplied to the metropolis .
These waters have substantially the same chemical composition as the rivers from which they are derived , but the number of micro-organisms which they contain at the time of collection rarely exceeds on the average 5 per cent , of that present in the raw river-waters .
The results obtained are recorded in the following tables :\#151 ; 1886 .

It is 2 w 2 Dr. P. F. Frankland .
[ June 10 , further seen that when allowed to stand at a temperature of 20 ' C. , the multiplication which takes place in the course of a few days is generally very considerable indeed , whilst at the temperature of the incubator ( 35 ' C. ) the multiplication , even in the course of a single night , is enormous .
On the other hand , when the storage is continued for a sufficient length of time , the number of micro-organisms diminishes , and may become reduced below that which was present at the outset .
It would appear , however , that the micro-organisms in these filtered waters become multiplied at 20 ' C. with far greater rapidity than those in the unfiltered waters , which , as already pointed out , have rather a tendency to become diminished , unless raised to the temperature of the incubator .
It now became a matter of interest to compare with the above the power of multiplication which is possessed by the micro-organisms found in deep well-waters .
Similar experiments were , therefore , made with the waters obtained from one of the wells in the chalk at Deptford , belonging to the Kent Company .

Experiments were also made to ascertain the influence of the temperature of the incubator upon the organisms in these well-waters .

7 21 495,000 These tables show the enormous capacity for multiplication which is possessed by the micro-organisms present in this deep well-water .
This is the more surprising , at first sight , when it is borne in mind that this water contains the merest trace of organic matter .
It must , however , be remembered that this water is at the outset almost wholly free from micro-organisms , and that it has never before been inhabited by such living matters ; it is only reasonable to infer , therefore , that those of its ingredients which are capable of nourishing the particular micro-organisms which flourish in it are wholly untouched , whilst in the case of the river-waters , the most available food supply must have been largely explored by the numerous generations of micro-organisms which have inhabited them .
It should also be mentioned that the number of different varieties of micro-organisms is far greater in the case of the river-waters than in the deep well-water , as is at once evident to the naked eye on inspection of a plate cultivation , the deep well-water plates having generally the appearance of a pure culture ; in the latter case , then , the organisms present will probably have a freer field for multiplication than in the presence of competitors , some of which may not improbably give rise to products which are hostile to others .
This would also explain the greater capacity for multiplication which we find , as indicated above , in the filtered as compared with the unfiltered river-waters .
By the process of filtration the number of different varieties of micro-organisms is largely reduced , as is at once seen by the inspection of the plate cultivations , and those varieties which remain have apparently a more favourable opportunity for reproduction than in the presence of more numerous varieties .
II .
The Multiplication of Pathogenic Micro-organisms .
The remarkable phenomenon of multiplication which is exhibited by the micro-organisms found in most natural waters obviously leads us to a consideration of the behaviour of parasitic micro-organisms when accidentally introduced , as they frequently must be , into waters of different composition .
Dr. P. F. Frankland .
[ June 10 , In studying the behaviour of parasitic micro-organisms under these conditions , I have selected three forms which are recognisable with particular facility , owing to the highly characteristic appearances to which they give rise when cultivated in the gelatine-peptone medium .
These forms are\#151 ; 1 .
Bacillus pyocyaneus .
2 .
Finkler-Prior 's Comma Spirillum .
3 .
Koch 's Comma Spirillum .
The pure cultivations of these organisms were obtained directly , in the case of the first two mentioned , and indirectly , in the case of the third , from the laboratory of the Hygienic Institute of Berlin .
i. Appearance of the Bacillus 'pyocyaneus in Gelatine-tube Cultivations .
At 20 ' C. , within twenty-four hours of inoculation , the path of the needle is indicated by incipient liquefaction at the surface , which as growth proceeds undergoes funnel-shaped depression , the fringe of which soon exhibits blue-green fluorescence .
The diameter of the liquefied portion increases until the whole width of the tube is affected , the downward extension of liquefaction proceeding in the form of an inverted cone , in the apex of which a flesh-coloured precipitate is formed .
The blue-green fluorescence is seen only on and near the surface .
Ultimately the whole of the gelatine becomes liquid , and of a dirty green colour .
Appearance of the Bacillus pyocyaneus in Gelatine-plate Cultivations .
At 20 ' 0 .
the colonies are generally distinctly visible on the second day as small opaque light green disks , the whole plate presenting a blue-green fluorescence when viewed by reflected light .
The size of the colonies is dependent upon the number present on the plate , being exceedingly minute when the latter is densely crowded , and reaching several millimetres in diameter when only a few are scattered over the surface .
The amount of liquefaction also varies inversely as the number of colonies , but even after considerable liquefaction has taken place over the surface of the gelatine , the individual colonies remain perfectly distinct , and do not become confluent , and so lose their identity , as is the case with many liquefying organisms .
Hot unfrequently , especially when there are comparatively few organisms on the plate , those situated on the surface give rise to a remarkable and very beautiful flocculent expansion of irregular contour and sometimes several millimetres in diameter .
The plates possess a highly characteristic and very nauseous odour , which is at once apparent on opening a dish in which they have been .

Magnifying power nearly 1000 .
Magnifying power about 100. .
2 .
Appearance of the Finlcler-Prior 's Comma Spirillum in tube Cultivations .
The growth of this organism very much resembles that of the Bacillus pyocyaneus , only that no colouring-matter is produced .
The liquefaction , which is at first funnel-shaped , rapidly extends across the whole tube , and the downward extension into the solid gelatine becomes filled with a plug of a yellowish viscid material .
In the course of a few weeks the whole gelatine , or at least as far as the needle at the time of inoculation has reached , becomes liquid , the yellowish precipitate resting on the bottom , but the liquefied portion also remains turbid .
Appearance of the Finlcler-Prior 's Comma Spirillum in Gelatine-plate Cultivations .
The plate cultivations of this organism are very characteristic .
The colonies making their appearance already on the first or second day as small milky white disks , which increasing in size cause rapid liquefaction of the gelatine , the depressions being filled with a white fluid resembling thin milk .
If the centres are at all closely approximated they very soon become confluent , and lose their identity , the whole plate becoming fluid .
Viewed under the low power of the microscope the colonies appear as brownish very finely granular disks , with a highly refracting edge , which is also granular and not perfectly sharp .

Appearance of Koch 's Comma Spirillum in Gelatine-tuhe Cultivations .
The growth of this organism in gelatine is slower than that of the other two .
At 20 ' O. , within a day or two of inoculation , the path of Dr. P. F. Frankland .
[ June 10 , the needle becomes visible as a fine thread , which sooner or later is followed by a conical depression at the surface ; this depression is filled with air at its wider upper extremity , and slowly increases in width ; as growth proceeds the track of the needle becomes thicker , and the air-cavity at the surface becomes partially filled with clear liquid , at the bottom of which there is a whitish somewhat flocculent precipitate .
The growth in peptone-broth is very rapid , the liquid becomes turbid , and on the surface there is formed a tough pellicle which increases in thickness , whilst the subjacent liquid is again clarified .
Appearance of Koch 's Comma Spirillum in Gelatine-plate Cultivations .
The plate cultivations exhibit in the course of two or three days minute whitish spots , each situated at the bottom of a small depression on the surface .
The colonies remain small , but when very numerous the substance of the gelatine becomes largely liquefied .
Magnifying power nearly 1000 .
Magnifying power about 100 .
Under the low power of the microscope the colonies present the appearance of somewhat irregular disks , with a more or less irregular and jagged edge , the interior of the disk being filled with coarsely granular matter .
Multiplication Experiments with Specific Organisms .
The pure cultivations of the three specific organisms mentioned above were introduced into the experimental waters in the following manner , so as to secure a degree of attenuation which admitted of satisfactory examination by plate cultivation .
One or more needlefuls of the cultivation are first inoculated into about 50 c.c. of sterilised distilled water contained in a sterile stoppered bottle ; this first attenuation is then well shaken , so as to distribute the introduced organisms evenly throughout .
From this first attenuation a certain number of drops are withdrawn by means of a sterilised pipette , and introduced into the sterilised experimental water contained in another sterile stoppered bottle .
The latter is then in turn well shaken , and the number of organisms in a given volume determined by plate cultivation .
This second attenuation is then exposed to any desired conditions of temperature , \amp ; c. , and the number of organisms determined in it at suitable intervals of time .

537 Experiments with the Bacillus A large number of experiments were made upon the vitality of this organism when introduced into various kinds of water .
The results of these experiments show that on introducing this organism into purer water , such as distilled water , deep well-water , or filtered Thames water , in the first instance a greater or less reduction in the number of organisms capable of development often takes place , but sooner or later a considerable increase in their numbers generally follows , and only in very exceptional cases was the complete destruction of their vitality observed .
On the other hand , when the same organism is introduced into sewage a rapid and large multiplication was observed in every case .

The great-vitality of this organism is Well illustrated by experiments No. 1 , 2 , and 3 , with distilled water , in which after fifty-three .days there were in each case a great many more colonies obtained than at the outset , although in each case the number was greatly reduced immediately after the inoculation .
For experiment No. 5 , with distilled water , the number of organisms was in the first instance so largely reduced that on the third day there were no organisms demonstrable even in a whole cubic centimetre , and even on the seventh day the number had only risen to nineteen in that volume .
The corresponding sample ( No. 4 ) placed in the incubator multiplied much more rapidly , showing 6200 colonies on the third day and 56,000 on the seventh in 1 c.c.

In the sewage again the multiplication of the organism was in each case very great .
Experiments with .
Koch 's Comma Spirillum .
The first experiments were made with comma Spirilla from feeble cultivations in gelatine .
In these cultivations the organisms appeared to grow with difficulty , producing little or no liquefaction , but only a deep depression on the surface of the gelatine at the point of inoculation .
On subsequently inoculating into broth a powerful growth was obtained , and from this again a strong growth in gelatine was procured .
It was with comma Spirilla from this broth cultivation that the subsequent experiments were made .
When the comma Spirilla from the weak cultivations were introduced into various waters , including sewage , their presence was , with one exception , no longer demonstrable after the first day , whilst the waters inoculated from the broth cultivation not only yielded colonies of comma Spirilla on plate cultivation after seven days , but during this time slight multiplication was exhibited in the potable water , and very extensive multiplication in the sewage .

The first attenuation ( in distilled water ) from which Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 above were inoculated was also examined on the ninth day , and 15,650 colonies obtained from the cubic centimetre .
Thus , although still alive , the reduction in number must have been very great , as originally this attenuation must have contained upwards of 1 million per cubic centimetre .
Dr. Koch ( Second Cholera Conference , May , 1885 , " Brit. Med. Journ. , " January 9 , 1886 ) mentions that Nicati and Rietsch have demonstrated the vitality of the comma Spirilla in the harbour water of Marseilles after a period of eighty-one days , and that he himself has proved them to be still alive in different kinds of water over periods of time varying from twenty-four hours to thirty days .
From my experiments it appears that the behaviour of the Spirillum in different waters is largely dependent upon the source from which they are obtained , but that under favourable circumstances a large amount of multiplication may take place when they are introduced into sewage 542 Dr. P. F. Frankland .

Experiments with Finkler-Prior s Comma Spirillum .
Similar experiments to those described above were also made with this organism .
These experiments show that although it possesses such far greater vital activity in gelatine cultures than Koch 's comma Spirillum , yet when introduced into different kinds of water , including sewage , its vitality is so rapidly lost that in no single instance have I been able to demonstrate its presence even after twenty-four hours , still less to obtain evidence of any multiplication in these media .
In fact so perishable does this organism appear to be when placed in water , that I have very frequently been unable to demonstrate its presence even on the day of inoculation , whilst with the Bacillus pyocyaneus I have never failed in this manner , and with the comma Spirillum only rarely .

From the differences which these three organisms present in their behaviour in water , and in different kinds of water , it is evident how fallacious must be any conclusions as to the vitality of pathogenic micro-organisms in general , more especially when such conclusions are based upon observations made with organisms which are the natural inhabitants of natural waters , as has often hitherto been the case .
It is obvious that each individual organism must be made the subject of separate investigation as to its vitality .
To render such investigations complete , it is necessary also that the organisms under examination should be taken from different sources , as from the experiments which I have quoted in the case of the comma Spirilla it is evident that an initial weakness of the growth from which the inoculation is made renders the organisms less capable of withstanding the conditions of the experiment .
It would also appear probable that this initial difference in vitality may be the cause of some of the many discrepant results which have been obtained by different observers in the study of antiseptic action .
That there exists a difference in resisting power according to the virulence or initial vitality of the organisms themselves has already been drawn attention to by Dr. Klein ( " Micro-organisms and Disease , " 1886 ) .

" Observations on Pure Ice and Snow .
" By Thomas Andrews , F.R.S.E. , F.C.S. , Wortley Iron Works , near Sheffield .
Received June 10 , 1886 .
The recent very severe winter afforded favourable opportunity and material for investigating some of the properties of ice and snow .
The object of the following observations was to obtain information on the relative conductivity of ice and snow , the dilatation of pure ice , and its relative hardness or penetrability at various temperatures .
Set I.-\#151 ; The Relative Conductivity of Pure Ice and Snow .
The experiments on the conductivity of the ice were made as follows :\#151 ; 47 gallons of distilled water at a temperature of 48 ' F. were placed in a large circular iron tank , A , of the internal dimensions given on fig. 1 .
Around this tank was built a brick enclosure , of 4 feet 2 inches internal diameter ; an opening was left near the bottom for easily removing the expended freezing mixtures , \amp ; c. The intermediate space between the iron tank and the brickwork was filled with a freezing mixture of snow and salt , maintaining a constant temperature of \#151 ; 4 ' F. throughout .
18 cwts .
of this mixture was required for each charge , and the charge was entirely renewed every 12 hours during the 115\#163 ; hours needed to freeze the above volume of water .
Thus about 8 tons of freezing mixture was used
