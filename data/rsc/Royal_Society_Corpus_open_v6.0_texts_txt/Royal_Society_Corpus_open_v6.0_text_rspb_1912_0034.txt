So far as the possibility of interplanetary bacterial life is concerned , then , it is evident that bacteria in the fully dried state , if free in the interplanetary vacuum , would be killed by the solar light and ultra-violet rays .
And , as Sir James Dewar 's experiments have demonstrated that the ultra-violet rays will kill undried bacteria whilst in the frozen condition , at the temperature of liquid air ( \#151 ; 190 ' C. ) , there is little to support the hypothesis that the living protoplasm on the earth originally immigrated from interplanetary space in a free or unincluded condition\#151 ; that free , particulate life has entered the earth 's atmosphere as a result of light propulsion , from extra-mundane space .
An Improved Method for Opsonic Index Estimations , involving the Separation of Red and White Human Blood Corpuscles .
By Charles Buss , M.B. Bond .
( Communicated by Dr. A. D. Waller , F.B.S. Eeceived February 21 , \#151 ; Bead March 14 , 1912 .
) Opsonin is the name given by Sir A. E. Wright to the substance in human blood which mainly influences phagocytosis .
In order to measure the opsonin , equal volumes of normal serum , of a bacterial emulsion , and of leucocytes are incubated to promote phagocytosis , and the number of bacteria visible in a random sample are counted in a stained film preparation .
By repeating the experiment with a pathological serum , a ratio is obtained which is known as the opsonic index .
The method , however , has been found inaccurate , and consequently fallen almost into disuse .
Drs. Greenwood and White pointed out the error of random sampling and , after elaborate mathematical analysis , adjudged the " liability to error " on a single count to occasionally exceed 20 per cent , from the mean or true figure .
Clearly , when the counts from two films are contrasted , the liability to error may be doubled .
This liability to error is due to the variation in content of different leucocytes in the same film ranging from 0 to 25 bacteria , and the resulting total in 50 leucocytes will vary according to the field in which the operator happens to make his count , i.e. , one rich in high or low contents .

] Method for Opsonic Index Estimations .
In my work this error has been studied and largely reduced .
The first idea was that the number of leucocytes in the mixture might vary in the successive sets of materials .
To test this point I repeatedly estimated the opsonin of normal serum to staphylococci , and also counted the leucocytes per cubic millimetre in each opsonic mixture .
The results are shown in Table A. Table A.\#151 ; Opsonic Index .

All the materials were identical in each series , and the opsonic estimations by the same operator , and the observations made at about half-hour intervals .
\lt ; 40 [ Feb. 21 , Mr. C. Huss .
Improved The following points are apparent from these experiments:_ ( 1 ) The leucocytes did vary in the series used for the opsonic estimations .
( 2 ) No definite relationship was apparent to a high or low couiit from this leucocyte variation .
( 3 ) The opsonic count often showed large variations from the mean value , i.e. a large experimental error .
( 4 ) There appeared to be the all-important constancy of the opsonic figure when the numbers of blanks met during a 50 count was the same or nearly so .
This last feature suggested that this large content variation might be due to uneven access between leucocytes and bacteria .
However , the outstanding fault of the process is this large variation in the leucocyte content , and its occurrence could only be due to differences of ( 1 ) appetite or ( 2 ) , or a combination of these factors .
( 1 ) Appetite.\#151 ; If the leucocytes have equally as good chances to pick up bacteria in the opsonic mixture , and yet show this variation , it must be presumed physiological , and there is no remedy .
( 2 ) Opportunity .
It may be that all the leucocytes have similar appetites , but get very different opportunities to pick up bacteria , owing to their uneven distribution in the mixture .
A scrutiny of the materials used in the old method showed two important \#166 ; defects .
The Presence of Bed Corpuscles.\#151 ; Although white corpuscles only are concerned in the process , both red and white blood corpuscles are used ; but , since a bacterial suspension not exceeding 500M per cubic centimetre is used , and washed blood corpuscles contain 5000M red and 10M white corpuscles per cubic centimetre , it is evident that for every leucocyte there are 50 bacteria provided , but surrounding this all-important leucocyte are 500 obstructing and useless red corpuscles .
I therefore decided to abolish the red corpuscles , and this involved the separation of red and white human blood corpuscles .
The methods which were tried unsuccessfully included\#151 ; Haemolysis of the red corpuscles ; agglutination by ferric chloride and filtration of the red groups ; filtration of decalcified blood .
; sedimentation of decalcified blood after artificially raising the specific gravity .
However , Dr. Ponder 's work on leucocytes furnished the nucleus of a successful method .
He found that when blood is enclosed in a cell between two glass plates and incubated , there occurs a swarming of polynuclear leucocytes to the glass surfaces , to which they adhere firmly and appear remarkably distorted .
1912.1 Method for Opsonic Index Estimations .
141 My first problem was to get these leucocytes off the glass .
This was found to be effected by citrate saline solution 1*5 : 08 per cent. , by disodium hydrogen phosphate , and by hypertonic salt solution , and also by serum .
After obtaining a large number in a test-tube in the citrate solution ( to make films ) , I found they were highly unstable osmotically and , when transferred to normal saline , the majority burst .
After experimenting with over 200 Ponder plates , I realised that the leucocytes could only be obtained in bulk if favourable chemical conditions were ascertained ( since incubation aggravated the bursting ) .
The following method succeeded in supplying a majority of polynuclear leucocytes ( the lymphocytes do not appear on the plates ) in good condition , which could be-incubated for 15 minutes , as in the opsonic index process .
The detailed method is as follows :\#151 ; Blood is shed into a rubber ring ( cell ) sandwiched between two glass-plates .
This cell is incubated for 20 minutes at 37'4 ' C. , removed from incubation , the cell is opened , the clot and ring removed , the plates washed with 1'25-per-cent , saline , to free them from red corpuscles and serum .
After wiping the ring margin clear of more red corpuscles and dried serum a few drops of cold NaCl ( 1'25 per cent. ) are poured on the leucocyte-laden area of each plate .
These are replaced on the metal shelf of the incubator for 15 minutes ; when the plates are inspected the previously distorted and stretched out polynuclears will be seen under a low objective to have become almost spherical and loose from the plate .
By means of a long glass rod the fluid and floating leucocytes are swept into a small tube and concentrated by the centrifuge at moderate speed .
After syphoning off the supernatant fluid a very large number of human polynuclear leucocytes were obtained , which stand incubation with equal volumes of serum and the bacterial emulsion , the latter being made with 1'25-per-cent .
NaCl instead of normal saline .
But before proceeding to test the opsonic process for the anticipated increased accuracy the second defect of opportunity in the old method had to be attended to .
In the old method the opsonic mixture ( serum , bacteria , and washed blood corpuscles ) was incubated for 15 minutes , but even at the end of 10 minutes the bulk of the corpuscles had settled to the bottom of the glass pipette , the supernatant fluid being clear .
Since equality of opportunity cannot exist when this is permitted this defect was remedied by keeping the mixture in slow rotary motion during incubation by means of the opsonic mill ( fig. 1 ) , and by this device no sedimentation occurs , but there is some-degree of active mixing .
A mechanism to prevent sedimentation of the opsonic mixture was devised by Bosenow , 1906 , and by Glynn and Cox , 1912 .
Mr. C. Huss .
An Improved [ Feb. 21 , The latter used a mechanism which rotated the pipette on its long axis in a horizontal plane , and their experiments showed no reduction of the error by its use when tested .
Only a small benefit is to be expected from such an improvement , but it is probably inappreciable when the entire experimental error may be large , as in the old method .
Moreover , their method of rotation is not ideal , for though sedimentation This clockwork-driven instrument standing in the incubator rotates the opsonic mixture and prevents sedimentation of the corpuscles .
Speed of rotation = 1 min. 45 secs , per revolution .

( 2 ) Indiarubber collar .
( 3 ) Copper tube lined with fine copper wires .

is prevented , there is no active mixing ( from end to end of the pipette ) induced by such a roller movement .
In the device illustrated in fig. 1 , not only does no settling occur , but experiments showed that the corpuscles pass up and down in the opsonic fluid during the changing positions of the pipette in the slowly moving wheel .
After a few trial experiments with the new materials I proceeded to test the opsonic index of the same serum repeatedly , as in the experiments recorded ( Table A ) , to ascertain whether the more even access and mixture of bacteria and leucocytes now improved the experimental error .
The results are shown in Table B. Fig. 1 , \#151 ; The Opsonic Mill .

Believing that still higher accuracy might be obtained I undertook a further series of tests , matching the emulsion used in Experiment 3 , Table B ( which had been fixed by heat ) , as a standard .
I also decided to count 100 leucocytes , 50 from each of the two films made from the mixture .
Mr. C. Russ .
Improved [ Feb. 21 , The results are shown in Table C , and show a still higher level of accuracy than those of Table B , though visual matching of the emulsions ( to produce an average phagocytosis of three bacteria per leucocyte ) was not very successful , though it can be assured in future by a preliminary count .

Summary .
The improvements described have produced :\#151 ; ( 1 ) A striking reduction in the liability to error of opsonic estimations when repeatedly tested .
( 2 ) The results recorded by the new method ( Table C ) showed a liability to error of about one quarter the magnitude of those recorded in Table A ( old method ) , the experimental conditions being almost comparable .
( 3 ) The enhanced accuracy is associated with a much reduced range of microbic content of the leucocytes ( 0 \#151 ; 14 ) .
( 4 ) The improved results are attributable to the more even distribution of bacteria amongst the leucocytes ( by the removal of the red corpuscles ) and by its maintenance during incubation in the opsonic mill .
( 5 ) No observations were made of any variations in opsonin in health or pathological states .
I am indebted to Dr. Cavendish Fletcher for his valuable assistance with this work , which unfortunately he had to abandon .
