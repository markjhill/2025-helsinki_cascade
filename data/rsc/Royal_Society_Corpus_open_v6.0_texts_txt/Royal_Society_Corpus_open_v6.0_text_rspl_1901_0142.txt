Changes undergone by Chlorophyll in passing .the Bodies of Animals By EDWARD SCHUNCK , F.R.S. Received November 29 , \mdash ; Read December 12 , 1901 .
Considering the large quantity of food containing chlorophyll consumed by animals feeding on green herbage , it seemed to me it might be of interest to ascertain whether any , and if so what , changes undergone by the chlorophyll of the food during its passage through the animal body .
It is stated in works on physiological chemistry that the solid excrements of ani1nals contain chlorophyll ; but this statement refers apparently to human faeces , and is certainly not correct as regards those of herbivora if unchanged chlorophyll is meant .
It would indeed , a priori , seem very improbable that chlorophyll , after exposure at a somewhat elevated temperature to acids and other agents , such as it would meet with in its passage through the animal system , would remain unchanged , though , on the other hand , chlorophyll products of decom-
