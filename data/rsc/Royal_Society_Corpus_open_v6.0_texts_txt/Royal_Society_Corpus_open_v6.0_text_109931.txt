An Account of the Fossil Skeleton of the Proteo-Saurus .
By Sir Everard Home , Bart. V.P.R.S. Read March 4 , 1819 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1819 , p. 209 .
] After reverting to the contents of his former papers on this subject , Sir Everard describes in the present communication a specimen of the animal nearly in an entire state , and of which most of the parts are in such good preservation , as to enable him to correct and complete his former accounts , the only parts wanting being the bones of the pelvis and the lower part of the sternum .
A drawing of the natural size accompanies this paper , in which , says the author , the parts are so clear and distinct , as to render any verbal description superfluous .
