a On the Employment of a Planimeter to obtain Mean Values from the traces of continuously Self-recording Meteorological Instruments .
" By Robert H. Scott , M.A. , F.R.S. Received May 23 , 1874 .
It is hardly necessary to remind the Fellows that the self-recording instruments employed by the Meteorological Committee at their Observatories for the continuous registration of pressure and temperature furnish their results in the form of photographic traces .
The usual method of dealing with these barograms and thermograms , as they are respectively called , is to measure them at certain intervals by appropriate scales , and to treat the numerical values so obtained by arithmetical processes so as to arrive at mean results .
This method is naturally very laborious , and its accuracy is to some * The author uses this word to denote that which in the calculus of finite differences takes the place of differentiation in the differential calculus .
Mr. R. H. Scott on the [ June 18 , extent affected by certain peculiarities found to be very commonly present in such photographic curves , and of which no satisfactory explanation has as yet been discovered .
The most important of these is what is termed by us " bagging , " the result of which is that the base or fiducial line of the curve is no longer a straight line , but exhibits a certain degree of curvature , so that the difficulty of determining the hourly or other values by means of an engraved scale , bearing parallel straight lines , is very considerable .
At the suggestion of Mr. Francis Gialton , the Meteorological Committee gave instructions that measurements should be made of the curves by means of the instrument called Amsler 's Planimeter , of which a full description , by Mr. F. J. Bramwell , F.P.S. , is printed in the 'Report of the British Association ' for 1872 .
The object of this invention is defined , in the paper quoted , to be " that the area of any figure , however irregular , can be recorded in definite standard units of measurement by the mere passage of a tracer along the perimeter of that figure .
" It is perfectly obvious that the measurement of the area of the curve , if it can be executed with sufficient accuracy , must give a far more satisfactory mode of ascertaining the value of the mean ordinate of the curve than the calculation of the average of any number of measured individual ordinates , while the economy of time ensured by the use of the planimeter forms a most important recommendation for its use .
The mode of employing the instrument is as follows :\#151 ; The entire perimeter of the curve , down to the base-line , is measured , and the value noted .
Then using the same base-line , a rectangle of known height , in units of the scale of the curve , is next measured in the same way , and the value noted again .
The ratio of these two values is the mean value of the ordinate of the curve , or the mean pressure or temperature for the interval embraced by the curve .
It may be remarked that I have learnt within the last few days that the present occasion is not the first on which a planimeter has been used for the deduction of meteorological means .
Mons. van Pysselberghe , Professor at the School of Navigation , Ostend , has employed it in connexion with his new electrical Meteorograph .
The subjoined Table shows for a period of eight months the means of temperature for Kew Observatory obtained by the planimeter , as well as those yielded by the old method , both for daily and for five-day means .
It will be seen that the difference in 242 determinations of daily means only amounted to 0''5 on six occasions , and to 0o,6 in one instance ; while out of 49 cases of five-day means the greatest difference was only 0'-4 , and this was only once attained .
At the end of the Table the column headed " Wr .
Pep .
Plates " gives the values obtained by measurement of the plates published in the ' Quarterly " Weather Peport ' for the period embraced by the measure- 1874 .
] Meteorological Use of a ments to which I have just alluded .
It will be seen from it that the five-day means so obtained hardly differ from those which are yielded by the direct measurement of the photographic curve by means of the planimeter .
The plates in question are obtained by the use of Mr. Francis Galton s Pantagraph , which transfers the records at a reduced time-scale to zinc plates , which plates are subsequently further reduced and transferred to copper by Wagner 's Pantagraph , as explained in the Report of the Committee for 1870 .
I therefore hope that the Society will allow me to remark that such a test as this affords a satisfactory proof of the accuracy of the reproductions of our automatic records which are executed in the Meteorological Office .
The result of these preliminary experiments is that the planimeter means are practically identical with those obtained by treatment of the values of the hourly ordinates .
It is found that the mean from the photographic record of temperature for one day can be obtained in about the same time as is required for the calculation of the hourly values ; while in the case of pressure the saving of time would be considerable .
In both cases the hourly values are supposed to have been previously measured .
If , however , the five-day mean from one of the plates of the 'Quarterly Weather Report be admissible , the economy of time would be very great indeed .
It does not appear that the liability to error in following the course of the curve with the tracer of the planimeter is greater than that of measuring the ordinates of the curve by a glass scale ; while we escape one serious cause of uncertainty in the latter operation , the difficulty of assigning the exact ordinate to the hour at a period of rapid change of temperature , \amp ; c.\#151 ; a case of frequent occurrence ; and we almost entirely dispense with arithmetical calculations .
It is very unfortunate that the use of the planimeter will not enable us to dispense with the necessity of taking hourly readings , inasmuch as it affords us no means of averaging any but consecutive values , and so renders us no assistance in any determination of the march of meteorological phenomena .
A further series of planimeter measurements , for pressure and dry-and wet-bulb temperature , for all the observatories for three months is nowin progress ; and if , as wre hope , the results will prove as satisfactory as those which I have the honour to submit to the Society on the present occasion , it would appear that there is no further reason why planimeter means should not be published in future by the Office .
