] I ntroduction .
In July , 1912 , Dr. A. Theiler , C.M.G. , Director of Veterinary Research ( Union of South Africa ) , Pretoria , sent this Commission several blood preparations taken from horses and dogs supposed to be suffering from nagana .
Much to the surprise of the Commission , a large percentage of these trypanosomes showed posterior-nuclear forms .
This disposed of the contention that the so-called Trypanosoma rhodesiense could be distinguished from other species of trypanosomes by this peculiarity , and first led the Commission to suspect that T. rhodesiense was in reality T. brucei .
Dr. Theiler was then asked to send the living strain through to the Commission in Nyasaland , and this , after several failures , was at last successful .
The history of the strain is as follows : Mr. A. W. Shilston , Veterinary Research Division , Pietermaritzburg , writes that it originated in a mule which was naturally infected at Somkele in Zululand .
A dog was inoculated from this mule and brought to the Veterinary Research Laboratory at Pietermaritzburg , where sub-inoculations into a series of animals were made .
Mr. Shilston says there is no possibility of this strain having been mixed with any other , as , at the time he was working at it , it was the only species of trypanosome maintained at the laboratory .
He also states that he\#151 ; in order to prove that he was dealing with a single species of trypanosome and not with a mixed infection\#151 ; infected rabbits with single parasites , and the resulting infections showed the same morphological characters as the original strain .
From Pietermaritzburg the strain was transferred to Pretoria .
Mr. William Robertson , acting director during the absence on leave of Dr. Theiler , informs * Major Harvey , R.A.M.C. , resigned from the Commission and left Kasu , September 16 , 1913 .
He was succeeded by Captain Watson , R.A.M.C. , who arrived November 2 , 1913 .
VOL. LXXXVII.\#151 ; B. 2 Q the Commission that the strain was kept going in Pretoria in horses and cattle , in which animals it produced the typical clinical symptoms and 'post-mortem lesions associated with nagana , and that it was always regarded as a pure uncomplicated strain of T. fomcei .
The thanks of the Commission are due to Mr. Robertson for his perseverance in sending inoculated animals to their camp at Kasu .
Like the Japanese general outside Port Arthur , as one batch succumbed he sent on another , until at last he succeeded .
The exact length of time this trypanosome was kept going at Pretoria before being sent to Kasu is not given , but the information has been asked for , and will be placed on record as soon as obtained .
In the opinion of the Commission , the trypanosome dealt with in this paper is the same as that discovered by Bruce in Zululand in 1894 , and named T. brucei by Plimmer and Bradford .
Somkele is in the same district in Zululand as that in which this species of trypanosome was first discovered .
In this paper the old Zululand strain will be called the 1896 strain , that being the year in which it was first described ; the new strain , the 1913 .
strain , the year in which it was received from Pretoria .
The Zululand trypanosomes were described by Bruce in his original paper* as hsematozoa which vary among themselves a good deal in size and shape .
Photographs were also given , which show a distinct dimorphic type .
In a later paperf Bruce gives measurements of 200 trypanosomes taken from preparations which had been made in Zululand in 1896 , and also gives six figures taken from the same source .
From these it will be seen that the trypanosome dealt with in Zululand in 1896 was a markedly dimorphic form , with long and slender , intermediate , and short and stumpy forms .
From the above measurements and figures there cannot be the slightest shadow of doubt about this .
In 1896 Bruce sent this trypanosome to England , and it was at once placed in the hands of Kanthack , Durham , and Blandford by the Royal Society to be reported on .
Their investigation lasted two years , and was published in vol. 64 of the ' Proceedings ' of the Royal Society .
In regard to the shape of this trypanosome they state that " the Nagana parasites vary considerably both in size and form ; they may be long and pointed or bluntended and somewhat stouter ; some individuals are short and thick , with a short flagellum , their protoplasm being crowded with rounded granules .
" No one who reads Bruce 's * Progress Report ' and compares it with Kanthack , Durham , and Blandford 's 1898 report can doubt that the same trypanosome was being dealt with .
This trypanosome was distinctly dimorphic .

Description of a Strain of T. brucei froZululand .
495 About this time ( 1898 ) the trypanosome was handed over to Bradford at the Brown Institute and named T. brucei in a paper written in 1899.* That the trypanosome named hy Plimmer and Bradford was the same as that sent to Kanthack , Durham , and Biandford in 1896 there can be no reasonable doubt .
There was no other species of pathogenic trypanosome in any English laboratory at the time , with the exception , perhaps , of T. lewisi , with which there could be no confusion .
Now , having shown that the original Zululand strain was a well-marked dimorphic type of trypanosome , let us see how it compares with the 1913 strain .
Mr. Shilston kindly sent the Commission a description of this strain made immediately after it had come from Zululand .
He states that in the living condition the variation in size and shape of the organism can be observed , the long , slender flagellated forms being readily distinguished from the short , stumpy forms , while all gradations between these two can be found ; that the circular vacuole close to the micronucleus is very distinct ; and that , although the organisms are actively motile , their progression is not rapid and frequently they simply travel in a small circle .

Description of a Mr. Shilston also made a large number of measurements of this strain .
One of his charts gives the percentages in respect to length of 400 trypanosomes occurring in the mule , dog , and guinea-pig , the measurements being made at varying periods of the disease .
This chart is reproduced on p. 495 .
In a previous paper* a curve will be found representing the percentages in respect to length of 200 individuals of the original strain of T. measured from old Zululand preparations which had been made in 1896 and were still extant .
The numbers making up these two curves are doubtless small , but they are fairly comparable .

Again , when the action of these two strains on various animals is compared , the same likeness is seen .
Bruce 's 1896 strain killed two horses in 30 and 49 days.f Shilston 's * ' Boy .

1913 strain killed one horse in 35 days .
, The former strain killed five dogs in an average of 21 days , the la tte r four dogs in an average of 19 days .
Taking these various arguments into consideration , it may be assumed that the strain of trypanosome which forms the subject of this paper belongs to the species T. brucei , a well-marked dimorphic type of trypanosome .
The object of this paper is to describe as fully as possible the morphology of this new strain of T. brucei from Zululand , in order to try to prove identity with the trypanosome causing disease in man in Northern and Southern Rhodesia , Nyasaland , and German and Portuguese East Africa .
The importance of this cannot be overrated .
It has been the habit in the past to consider T. brucei harmless to man , but if the above conjecture proves to be true , then all Glossina morsitans areas where wild game and T. brucei co-exist must be looked upon as dangerous .
Evidence is accumulating that this is so .
Recently two Europeans have fallen victims to the tsetsefly disease in the Sebungwe district in Southern Rhodesia , a remote , savage , unfrequented spot swarming with game and G- .
morsitans .
This year also 1913\#151 ; as had been anticipated , several cases have been found in the Nyasaland fly-areas to the north and south of the " Proclaimed Area , " one case occurring in a native village within a few miles of Zomba , the official capital .
In future papers , the Susceptibility of Animals to this Strain , its Development in G. morsitans , Sera Reactions and Cross Inoculation Experiments will be dealt with .

505 From this curve it will be seen that three passages through has had little or no effect in changing the character of this trypanosome as regards distribution of length .
It has usually been thought that a trypanosome kept under laboratory conditions , and without the opportunity of passage through its invertebrate host , the tsetse fly , would tend to change in morphology .
These curves , on the other hand , show that a trypanosome , after passage through horses and cattle for some years\#151 ; exact time unknown \#151 ; is unchanged by three passages through its invertebrate host , G. morsitans .

| These two curves are undoubtedly much alike , and as the wild-game strain in Nyasaland is supposed to be identical with the human strain , then it might be said that T. brucei , Zululand strain , 1913 , is also identical with the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland .
Others will say that the Zululand trypanosome and the Nyasaland wild-game strain are both T. brucei , but that this does not prove that T. brucei is identical with the human strain .
No , but if it is shown that T. brucei , Zululand , is absolutely identical in morphology with this Nyasaland human strain , that it also has exactly the same disease-producing power on the various experimental animals , this will VOL. LXXXVII.\#151 ; B. 2 R go a good long way to make the ordinary unprejudiced man chary of exposing himself too carelessly to the so-called harmless nagana .
His serum may save him as a rule , but there may come a time when\#151 ; his resistance being lowered either by fatigue , or some other cause\#151 ; the trypanosome may gain a footing , and then his belief in the written word of the text-book will receive a rude shock .
Breadth.\#151 ; The long and slender average 2*76 microns in breadth , the intermediate 3'25 , and the short and stumpy 3'53 .
This measurement was made across the broadest part of the trypanosome and includes the undulating membrane .
Most previous measurements of breadth have not included this .
In regard to the shape of this trypanosome , contents of cell , nucleus micronucleus , undulating membrane , and flagellum , it is not proposed to describe these characters separately for this strain as was done in the case of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland .
Suffice it to say that , after the most careful comparison , no difference whatever can be made out in the morphology of the two trypanosomes .
At the end of this paper three plates are given , one representing the short and stumpy , another the intermediate , and a third the long and slender forms .
If these plates are compared with those given in previous papers* it will be seen that in morphology the Nyasaland and Zululand trypanosomes are identical .
Conclusions .
1 .
The trypanosome described in this paper under the name of the " Zululand strain , 1913 , " is the same species as that discovered by Bruce in Zululand in 1894 ; reported on by Kanthack , Durham and Blandford in 1898 ; and named T. brucei by Plimmer and Bradford in 1899 .
2 .
As regards its morphology , this trypanosome is absolutely identical with the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland , the T. rhodesiense of Stephens and Fantham .
