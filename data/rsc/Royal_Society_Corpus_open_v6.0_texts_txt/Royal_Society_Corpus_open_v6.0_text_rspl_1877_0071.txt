512 Dr. R. A. Smith on the Examination of Air .
[ Dec. 13 , ( 6 ) We have seen in ( 4 ) that metals may be deposited on a thermometer bulb and then deprived of a determinate part of their electro-strictive power , and that there is an experimental possibility of depositing them with none of this effect .
We are therefore in a position to compare , one with the other , the two states of the same metal .
The electrostricted metal ( submitted , as may have been the case , to more than a hundred atmospheres ' compression ) must oppose the effect of a solvent much more than that which is soft and no longer the subject of electro-striction .
In other words , a gramme of the former should require more of a reagent to dissolve it than should the latter , under the same conditions .
But this excess corresponds to a known amount of electro-strictive effect , which , again , is known in atmospheres pressure .
We ought therefore to be in a position to measure chemical effect in atmospheres pressure .
My best thanks are due to Professor Sir William Thomson for the loan of an Andrews 's apparatus ; to Professor George Forbes , for a pressure machine ; and to Mr. W. H. Walenn for much practical advice in connexion with electro-metallurgy .

" The Examination of Air .
" By R. Angus Smith , Ph. D. , F.R.S. Received August 11 , 1877 .
It is now many years since I first began to examine air so as to obtain decidedly those bodies which have from the earliest times been supposed to exist in it , bringing with them , on certain occasions , some of the worst results .
About eight years ago ( that is , in 1869 ) , after giving a short summary of some of my work in the Journal of the Scottish Meteorological Society , I used these words :\#151 ; " For a satisfactory investigation of the subject , one must look to the multiplication of these experiments , and perhaps to the establishment of a department at some Observatories for Chemical Climatology and Meteorology .
" Afterwards , in 1872,1 published an octavo volume on Chemical Climatology , embodying many of my results , and intended to be a beginning of work to be continued by a public body.* Indeed some of the work was done whilst I was acting under the Government and was published in Government Reports .
It was often my intention to begin a movement which might result in a fuller recognition of the claims of Chemical Climatology ; but I have not gone further than speaking of it to Mr. Scott , and proposing it to the Local Government Boards since the time when I published the proposal alluded to ; at least I may say I have not gone further in a distinct public manner .
I should have been glad had my work caused in this country a beginning such as has been made lately at the observatory of Mont Souris , at Paris , or at least resembling it ; and I blame myself for not pushing forward the idea , 1877 .

513 although my numerous engagements may well form a kind of apology .
My present object is partly to draw attention to the fact of my proposal and not to let it be forgotten , and it is also combined with another object , namely , to speak of methods of study or experiments which have been tried .
In obtaining specimens of any soluble or insoluble body from the atmosphere , I have washed the air with pure water\#151 ; that is , I have shaken the water in a vessel of the air to be examined .
The other method , chiefly , and I may almost say universally , used , except by me , has been to pass the air through water .
It is of great importance to obtain the characteristics of each method .
It is now many years since I passed air through water for three months and obtained so little of a result , that I gave up the matter for some time in despair .
I passed air which I knew to contain acid and salts through water ; but I obtained scarcely any of either , and I afterwards found both in the tubes through which the air passed before entering the water .
This little incident made an era in all my inquiries .
I tried minutely pointed tubes , but did not succeed , and for the same reason , or rather for that and an additional reason , viz. the minuteness detained the air longer in the tubes , and the result was worse .
A considerable number of small holes pierced in a bulb at the end of a glass tube having been recommended , I obtained , by the kindness of Mr. Dixon , of Glasgow , a few which he had got made in a beautiful and ingenious manner .
I knew from my previous results that the success would be imperfect ; but I thought it well to try any new method and to overlook all my work , quite willing to find that I had been doing in a laborious and imperfect manner that which could have been done with ease and rapidity .
I did not find that Nature had altered her habits since my previous and numerous trials ; but I found that the small holes prevented still more the exit of particles which floated in numbers in the bulbs .
The tubes retain not merely visible particles but those invisible , although by accumulation some of the latter also become visible , and give a turbid character to the liquid or a dimness , according to the amount of moisture and the hygrometric character of the substances .
The washing of the air is laborious , because the water must be shaken up violently within the bottle .
In order to refill the bottle with air , an air-pump must be used until the required point is obtained on the mercury gauge , this being found to indicate a known amount of air , which is now .allowed to enter so as to be washed exactly as the former quantity .
To obtain the hydrochloric and sulphuric acid only in the air of Manchester , this operation must be repeated fifty times ; with some pure air as much as 200 bottles have been used .
It is not to be supposed that in such laborious measurements the fullest accuracy is attained ; but , as I have said elsewhere , at least good comparative results are found .
I know well the great importance of obtaining a ready method , and I am not Dr. U. A. Smith on the Examination of Air .
[ Dec. 13 , surprised at others clinging to it , even when imperfect ; but it is no less important that I should give my experience .
For ordinary cases I obtain sufficiently accurate results by apparently less exact measurements .
" With carbonic acid it may be possible to use aspiration with good results , because this acid does not adhere to the tubes ; and by an increase of bottles for absorption all may be safe ; but the increase of absorbing vessels is troublesome .
With salts and acids , such as hydrochloric and sulphuric , the difficulty of absorption is not so great ; but the adherence to the tubes is remarkable , and there is no hope of any good result without washing out the tubes which give a passage to the air .
With organic substances both the difficulties occur , adherence to the tubes and passage through the solutions .
I doubt if it is possible to wash out the tubes sufficiently ; in such cases , the result is worse according to the length of the passage .
I have tried various ways to overcome the difficulty , but have found only one way , and that is a very laborious one .
These points have long been known to me , and for some time have been spoken of ; but I add a few results so as to impress them on others .
The importance of having a chemical department to our observatories cannot be long overlooked .

It is clear from these experiments that a series of three washing-bottles containing barium hydrate are not sufficient to absorb the carbonic acid from the air aspirated through them ; with a series of six bottles it is troublesome to work , but more , and perhaps all , is obtained .
Equal speeds are compared here and equal solutions .
With the three absorbents the strong baryta solution gave still too little .

It was thought better to examine them by what is called Wanklyn 's process for organic nitrogen .
My reason for that is given elsewhere .
I never did receive it as a method of obtaining all the nitrogen in every substance ; but I did receive it , and do so still , as a method of obtaining the ammonia of that which is easily decomposed ; and only such substances are capable of producing fermenting disease according to theory .
No other person , so far as I know , has entered on this part of the subject ; and it is the more interesting , as I have sufficiently shown that , in the places examined , the organic ammonia has been in intimate relation with the gross death-rate .
At the same time I do not find by this method the form of organic matter in the air .
It may be true that oxygen is the prime mover , in man producing animal life\#151 ; a favourite idea for a chemist ; but it may also be true that minute organisms cause a peculiar class of decomposition connected with mental or other activity , diseased or otherwise .
But my present object is explained .

Received August 13 , 1877 .
In the ' Proceedings ' of the Royal Society for 1877 , April 26 , there is a short paper by M/ r. Huggins , in which some views of mine on this subject are called in question .
Mr. Huggins 's objections are threefold : 1 .
" There are not found in the spectra of different nebulae the differences of relative brightness of the bright lines and of the continuous spectrum which would be expected on Mr. Stone s hypothesis .
2 .
" The star-clusters which are just within the resolving-power of the largest telescope do not give , even faintly , a spectrum of bright mes .
