In the first part of this paper the influence of carbon dioxide in inhibiting the germination of moist seeds was described .
The results obtained are summarised on pp. 623-625 of this paper .
In the present paper the relation of this inhibitory effect of carbon dioxide to temperature and oxygen supply is first to be examined , and then will be studied further narcotic or inhibitory effects of C02 as 610 Mr. F. Kidd .
The Controlling Influence of exemplified in the natural inhibition of maturing seeds in the ovary , and the artificial prolongation of the dormant life of seeds which cannot survive naturally unless germination occurs soon after ripening .
Section I.\#151 ; The Relation to Temperature of the Inhibitory Effect of Carbon Dioxide on Germination .
A large number of experiments were conducted to determine this relation .
Brassica alba seeds were used .
The result would appear to establish the conclusion that at low temperatures inhibition is caused by very small pressures of C02 , while conversely at high temperatures high pressures of C02 are necessary to maintain continued dormancy .
It would seem probable that this relation to temperature is significant in natural seasonal conditions .
The technique in these experiments was the same as before described , the details of each experiment in full are unnecessary and a summary of the results obtained is given .
The usual retardation effects were observed throughout , but the numbers in the table indicate only the final total germination out of 20 seeds .

The temperature of 3 ' C. obtained with melting ice varied to the extent of 1 ' C. The other two , 7 ' and 17 ' C. , are averages of outdoor and indoor winter temperatures .
The experiments were continued till no more seeds germinated .
It is necessary to consider the possibility of these results being due not to a decrease with rising temperature in the effectiveness of pressures of C02 in causing inhibition , but to an increase of oxygen stimulus caused by an increased permeability of the testa under the action of higher temperatures .
The following series of experiments were therefore conducted with Brassica alba seeds from which the testas had been carefully removed .
In these experiments with bare embryos , it was difficult in the early Carbon Dioxide in Maturation , etc. , of Seeds .
611 stages to tell by eye whether germination had begun or not .
The bare embryos in the first stages of germination could not be differentiated , but had to be described as either all germinating or all not germinating .
In order to bring the results given in the following Table more into relation with those formerly obtained , small figures have been inserted to express the relative condition of growth at the end of the experiment , and the delay in germination as compared with the controls .

The temperatures 16 ' C. and 20 ' C. were maintained accurately within a variation of 0*5 ' C. In the case of the experiments at 5 ' C. the temperature was less accurately controlled , being obtained by melting ice .
It will be seen from the foregoing Tables that a rise of temperature of 10 ' C. necessitates roughly the presence of three times as high a partial pressure of C02 to cause inhibition .
Thus in Table I at 10 ' C. no germinations occurred with C02 pressures above 12 per cent. , while at 20 ' C. germinations occur up to 36 per cent. Similarly at 7 ' C. no germinations occur above 6 per cent. , while at 17 ' C. germination proceeds with pressures up to 18 per cent. It must be remembered that the actual partial pressures of C02 in the tissues of the embryos is probably higher , especially where the testa remains intact , than the values expressed in the tables for the partial pressures of C02 in the atmospheres used .
The result of this series of experiments , both with whole seeds and with bare embryos , thus clearly indicates that a rise in temperature necessitates an increase in the amount of C02 necessary to produce inhibition in the seeds of Brassica alba .
Conversely , a fall in temperature reduces the necessary amount of C02 to cause inhibition .
This relation of carbon dioxide inhibition to temperature may be emphasised .
In the case of drugs acting chemically on the protoplasm the expectation is that their action will be more effective at high than at low temperatures .
Here with carbon dioxide the reverse result has been 612 Mr. F. Kidd .
The Controlling Influence of obtained .
The fact must be borne in mind that we are dealing in this case with a gaseous agent more soluble at low than at high temperatures .
This implies that to maintain in solution in the tissues the same concentration of carbon dioxide at a low temperature as at a high temperature necessitates a greater partial pressure of C02 in the atmosphere at the low temperature .
Further work upon this relation of carbon dioxide inhibition in seeds to temperature is needed.* Section II.\#151 ; Relation to Oxygen Pressure of the Inhibitory Effect of Carbon Dioxide on Germination .
The presence of the testa between the embryo and its gaseous environment , as a membrane , only permeable with some difficulty , will , as has been pointed out , cause ( 1 ) a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the embryo , and ( 2 ) a relative rise in the actual C02 pressure in the embryo tissues .
It has been shown by the removal of the testa that temperature has , nevertheless , a direct effect in determining the inhibitory value of a given pressure of C02 .
The following experiments were made to determine whether a varying oxygen supply might not also influence the inhibitory action of carbon dioxide .
A large number of experiments wrere conducted at the same temperature , but with varying pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmospheres used .
The testas were not removed in these cases .
With a given pressure of C02 , the temperature being fixed throughout , no variation in permeability in the testa was looked for .
It is possible that an increased oxygen supply may cause a corresponding increase in the actual C02 pressure in the embryo tissues .
The results show , however , that for the main purpose of the experiments this possibility may be neglected , as it clearly appears that an increase of oxygen supply decreases the inhibitory value of any given pressure of C02 , while correspondingly a decrease in oxygen supply intensifies it , so that with small amounts of oxygen very low percentages of C02 will induce complete inhibition .
* In a critical consideration of the actual pressures of C02 in the embryo tissues at any temperature we should have to take into account not only the external partial pressure of C02 , but also the rate of C02 production in the tissues and the rate of the escape of this C02 from the tissues by diffusion .
Roughly , in relation to different temperatures , these two processes tend to cancel one another , and their combined effect to give the same value at all temperatures .
In the above experiments no account has , therefore , been taken of any change with temperature of the rate of C02 production in the tissues or of the rate of diffusion from the tissues .

It will be noticed from the preceding Table that the effect of decreasing the oxygen supply is to intensify the inhibitory action of carbon dioxide .
Thus , with a decrease of oxygen to 8 per cent. , the inhibitory effect produced by 6 per cent , of carbon dioxide is very marked .
With a decrease of oxygen in the atmosphere to 4 per cent. , complete inhibition is produced by 6 per cent , of carbon dioxide .
Here again it must be remarked that this relation may very likely be significant in many cases of delayed germination under the influence of C02 in natural conditions .

614 Mr. F. Kidd .
The Controlling Influence of It will be seen that the amount of oxygen present has a definite effect upon inhibition by C02 .
Where there is only a pressure of 5 per cent , oxygen , complete inhibition is obtained by 15 per cent. C02 , but , with 30 per cent , oxygen present , as much as 30 per cent. C02 is scarcely sufficient at the temperature used to cause inhibition .
The result of these experiments , therefore , indicates that a rise in the partial pressure of oxygen within the limits experimented on necessitates an increase in the amount of C02 necessary to produce inhibition in the seeds of Brassica alba .
Conversely , a fall in the partial pressure of oxygen reduces the necessary amount of C02 to cause inhibition .
Section III.\#151 ; Carbon Dioxide as a Factor the Dormancy of the Maturing Seed on the Plant .
( a ) Arrested Development of Maturing Seeds not due to Lack of Moisture\#151 ; Retarding Influence of the Testa.\#151 ; The maturation of the seed in normal conditions has certain features upon which it is desirable to dwell briefly .
The growth of the embryo proceeds continuously after fertilisation .
In some cases it quickly reaches an advanced stage , and the radicle , plumule , and cotyledons may be formed very early .
This growth , moreover , appears to resemble in some respects the growth which takes place subsequently , after germination , but in others it has the appearance of partial inhibition , the radicle apparently being not free to sprout as in germination .
This appearance of inhibition increases in the cases of most seeds , until at the stage of complete maturation growth is apparently arrested or suspended .
That there is some restraining cause tending to prevent growth present in the seed during the series of changes which is producing maturation may be proved , as in the experiments following , by the fact that the embryo , often at a comparatively early stage , though the seed be far from ripe , can be caused to sprout if removed to air .
The following experiments were conducted in order to show that neither lack of water nor any physiological insufficiency in the embryo can be considered as the cause preventing the still maturing embryos of beans and peas from sprouting , and so becoming cases of viviparity:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Two lots , 10 peas and 10 beans , were taken from pods which were still perfectly green and hardly yet fully swelled .
These two lots were set to germinate at 20 ' C. on damp sand , with the result that all the seeds germinated perfectly .
From these experiments it is clear that , in the case of the bean ( Vida faba ) and of the pea ( sativum ) , for some considerable period before the natural drying process commences , and while the growth of the pods is continuing , the seeds , if removed and placed in Carbon Dioxide in Matur , etc. , of Seeds .
615 germinating conditions , are capable of immediate germination .
In this and similar experiments it was noticeable , especially in the case of peas , that removal of the testa greatly increases the rate of this germination .
The following experiment was typical:\#151 ; % Table " V.\#151 ; Increased Rate of Germination in Maturing Seeds of Peas when Testa is removed .

All these six then sprouted within two days .
3 8 ( 2 ) Further experiments to test the power of the embryo of the ripening bean and pea , before drying has commenced , to grow without the addition of moisture , were necessary .
To this end 10 bean embryos taken from seed in immature condition were placed in glass tubes closed at both ends with bored rubber corks .
They were placed at such distances as to avoid contact with each other .
In six days the radicles of all had sprouted ; similar results were obtained with embryos taken from immature pea seeds .
These experiments were repeated another year with confirmatory results .
The bare embryos germinate readily in the above conditions .
In parallel experiments made with whole immature seeds , the presence of the testa still intact was found to retard sprouting constantly .
This retarding effect of the testa was more marked in these cases where no water was added to the green seeds from the pods than in the experiments above , in which such seeds were germinated in the ordinary way on damp sand .
In connection with this action of the testa it is of great interest to find that Guppy , in a recent book containing the results of a wide series of studies upon seeds , remarks that " it is noteworthy that the viviparous habit is associated with the absence of seed coats .
" ( 3 ) Experiments with germinating beans after complete air-drying in the laboratory showed that , at the moment of sprouting , these seeds might actually contain less water than they did when originally removed from the pod .
These experiments were conducted both with whole seeds and with Mr. F. Kidd .

The following are representative examples taken from a series of experiments:\#151 ; Table YI.\#151 ; Showing that Beans germinated after Complete Air-drying may actually contain at the moment of sprouting less water than they did when originally removed from the fresh green pod in the last stages of maturation before drying on the plant had commenced .

Finally , the action of the testa as a retarding influence on germination has to be noted .
In addition to experiments already given with seed still immature , the following experiments were made with dried seeds:\#151 ; Table VII.\#151 ; Retarding Influence of the Testa in Germination of Dried Seeds .

617 of the maturing seed , while still upon the parent plant , may he due directly to 002 inhibition 01 narcosis .
In order to obtain evidence here an endeavour was made to ascertain the actual C02 content of ripening seeds .
The method adopted was suggested by Dr. F. F. Blackman , for whose advice and direction during these researches I am deeply indebted .
The technique of this method for determining the amount of C02 present in the tissues of seeds was as follows:\#151 ; Two lots of material of equal weight were taken in each experiment .
One lot was crushed to thin paste in a mortar and left exposed to the air for 40 to 80 minutes .
It seemed from experiments that this time was sufficient to allow the escape of the C02 present in the tissue mash .
A known quantity of baryta was then added and a titration made with HC1 .
The second parallel lot was crushed immediately under an equal quantity of baryta and a similar titration made .
The difference between these two readings invariably showed that more baryta had been neutralised where the tissues had been crushed immediately in contact with it than where the tissue was first exposed for some time to air after crushing to a mash .
These differences were taken as roughly expressing the relative C02 contents of the tissues used in these experiments .
The results obtained in a series of experiments made by this method to ascertain the C02 content of maturing peas and beans from fresh green pods and of the same seed during its drying in laboratory air , are given in the following table:\#151 ; Table VIII.\#151 ; The C02 Content of Maturing Peas ( Pimm sativum ) and Beans { Vidafaba)when removed fresh from the Green Pod and during the first few days of drying .

In short , so far as these experiments have gone , it would seem that where the C02 content of the tissues is above a certain point germination does not occur and that the C02 content must fall below this point before germination takes place .
Section IV.\#151 ; Contrast of Depressant Action of High Partial Pressures of Carbon Dioxide with Stimulatory Effect of Low Partial Pressures .
Carbon Dioxide considered as a Narcotic Agent .
From the experiments already described it is definitely shown that the phenomenon of non-germination induced in the seed by C02 is one of temporary inhibition resulting in a condition strikingly similar to that of narcosis .
The interesting question therefore presents itself as to how far this depressant action of carbon dioxide can be regarded as true narcosis .
Looking back , in the first place , through the history of previous work , it has to be noticed that the following results have been recorded as to the effect of carbon dioxide on the growth activity of plants :\#151 ; De Saussure ( 3 ) in 1804 found that an atmosphere containing 8 per cent. C02 restrained the growth of peas .
Montemartini ( 4 ) found that over 7 per cent. C02 depressed the growth activity in the roots of peas .
Chapin ( 5 ) in 1902 confirmed this .
Bohm(6 ) , Dr. Drabble ( 7 ) , Prof. Farmer ( 1 ) , and Carbon Dioxide in Matur , etc. , of Seeds .
Brown and Escombe ( 2 ) have also conducted experiments tending to show the restraining effect of carbon dioxide on growth .
Dr. Drabble and Miss Bake in 1905 demonstrated the stimulation effect of small partial pressures of C02 , observing that the growth in the length of pea roots was more rapid in 4 per cent. C02 than in air and than in percentages greater than 7 per cent , of C02 .
Here it will be observed that there are two classes of effects recorded \ an effect of retardation by higher percentages , and an effect of stimulation by lower percentages of C02 .
The stimulatory effect of small doses is a general property of narcotic agents .
A further series of experiments was therefore arranged to test the effect of C02 in various proportions below the inhibitory percentage on the germination and growth of Brassica alba and vulgar .
The results* obtained with Brassica alba are shown in the following Table .
Hordeum vulgar gave similar results .

This increases to a * The rate of germination was not increased by the low percentages of C02 in this experiment , but as has been shown in the case of beans and peas in Table IX , the actual C02 content of the seeds is high and falls from an initially inhibitory value as germination proceeds .
We should not expect , therefore , small doses of C02 in the atmosphere to have a marked stimulatory effect , if any , upon the rate of germination , though their effect upon growth after the escape of the initial high partial pressures of C02 in the seeds is clear .

The Controlling Influence of maxim am which , at the temperature used , is obtained at about 3 per cent , or slightly over , and then declines again through a restraining effect to complete inhibition .
We appear , therefore , to have in view results confirmatory of the hypothesis that we are here dealing with the effect on germination and growth of a true narcotic agent , and that the results induced by C02 in the resting seed are a phase of narcosis .
Section V.\#151 ; Influence of C02 in Enforcing Dormancy in Certain Seeds which do not Naturally have a Long Dormant Phase .
Seeds of Hevea brasiliensis .
A considerable amount of work has been done in the past\#151 ; work which is well summarised by Becquerel(8)\#151 ; upon various effects produced in dry seeds by sealing them in various gases and vapours , including C02 .
Becquerel discounts the value of part of this work on the ground that it has been conducted on seeds with impermeable testas , so that the gases used could not be considered to have reached the plant embryo .
In a number of experiments conducted during this inquiry on seeds with naturally permeable testas , and on rapidly deteriorating seeds in which the testas may be assumed to be at least partially permeable , carbon dioxide was found in nearly all cases to have certain definite effects , such as might have been expected from the foregoing experiments conducted upon wet seeds in germinating conditions .
The results of this work , which is still in progress , have not yet been correlated , but one aspect of them may be referred to here , as bearing directly upon the central problem discussed in this paper .
One of the most rapidly deteriorating seeds is that of Hevea brasiliensis .
In planting in the tropics it is found that it is always desirable to put the seed in the ground within a fortnight , and Mr. C. Curtis , late director of the Botanical Gardens , Penang , from whom the seeds used were obtained , writes that even in such circumstances 70 per cent , germination is considered good .
This rapid deterioration of the seed has been a difficulty in the recent extension of rubber plantations , and the question of the best conditions for preservation in packing and export has been an important one , leading to practical research .
The seeds are at present usually packed in ground charcoal and ashes .
Their size is about that of an average acorn or larger .
They have easily permeable testas and a high water content , and while living they were found to be respiring very rapidly .
They were also found to be very intolerant of drying .
The seeds in the experiments considered in this research were enclosed in hermetically sealed flasks under various conditions , Carbon Dioxide in Maturation , etc. , of Seeds .
621 and it was found as the outcome of a number of experiments that when they were sealed in the proportion of 40 to 50 seeds to 1200 c.c. of air the following results were obtained :\#151 ; ( l ) A partial pressure of C02 of 40-45 per cent , was created in the flasks by the life processes of the seeds , and ( 2 ) there was a marked prolongation in their period of vitality .
In the following Table the results of two experiments are given .

The Controlling Influence of germinations were obtained with seeds sealed in air in the proportion mentioned against nil with seeds kept in commercial packing , nil with seeds kept in open air , and nil with seeds sealed in nitrogen.* In the foregoing experiments it will be observed that large seeds enclosed in permeable seed coats and sealed with a definite proportion of air in an impenetrable outer envelope were being dealt with .
In these conditions , where the life processes of the seeds resulted in the creation in the flask of a partial pressure of C02 of 40-45 per cent , the vitality of the seeds was markedly prolonged .
A conclusion which Becquerel reaches , as the result of his researches , is that in all cases of longevity in dry seeds the testas are exceptionally strong and impermeable .
The problem of the dry seed enclosed in an impermeable or almost impermeable testa has certain striking affinities\#151 ; in that gaseous exchange in either direction is hindered or prevented\#151 ; to that of the wet seed , though in apparently good germinating conditions , which does not germinate .
But with the former problem we are not at present directly concerned in this research .
Section VI.\#151 ; Biological Importance of Dormancy in Moist Seeds .
The seed is a comparatively late arrival in geological time , and the perfecting of its function has of necessity been a great point in the struggle for existence amongst plants .
A leading cause in the success of the Angiosperms , as Prof. Seward has pointed out , has consisted in the efficiency of the arrangements for nursing the embryo .
There can be no doubt that a ruling factor in this efficiency has been the adjustment of all the life processes of the moist resting seed to the end of attaining a fit time for germination .
It is suggested by these experiments that the presence of carbon dioxide in the tissues of the embryo acting as a restraining and inhibiting agent on the life processes of the seed , and as a dominant factor in relation to the oxygen stimulus , has been utilised in attaining this efficiency of the latent seed for which fit conditions of germination have not yet arrived .
The various structures of the testa and its behaviour under different conditions in regulating the gaseous exchanges * The favourable results obtained in these experiments in prolonging the vitality of these rapidly deteriorating seeds were greatly in excess of those which are secured by present commercial methods of packing for transport and import .
In experiments on a large scale the seeds might be simply sealed ( in the proportions of air mentioned ) in large carboys , such as are used for the transport of distilled water , covered with wicker or wire netting .
In case of too high an internal pressure , arising from overfilling with seeds , a simple form of safety valve might be inserted in the sealing .
Carbon Dioxide in Maturation , etc. , of Seeds .
623 appear to be important factors in obtaining the necessary adjustments to natural conditions .
Emphasis may properly be laid on the fact that it is these adjustments of the moist seed when in apparently suitable conditions of temperature , moisture , and oxygen supply , while awaiting the fit time for germination , and not so much the adjustments of the resting dry seed , that have formed the central problem of seed life in conditions of nature .
The maintenance of latency when the moist seed is in conditions of medium temperature , oxygen supply , and moisture , has been the problem of the maturing seed on the parent plant .
It has been the problem of a large proportion of native seeds which fall upon the ground in summer and autumn , but whose fit time for germination does not arrive till the following spring .
It has , beyond doubt , been the problem also of many species of plants in the struggle for existence whose chances therein must have often been increased many-fold by the capacity of their seeds to lie dormant in the ground for indefinite periods , ready to resume activity with sporadic germination when suitable conditions arise such as , for instance , occurred in the case of the Brassica alba seeds of these experiments when the testas became dry or ruptured .
Section VII.\#151 ; Summary and Conclusions .
Part I.\#151 ; Experiments were conducted showing that the germination of seeds is retarded or inhibited by high partial pressures of CO2 in the atmosphere .
This retardation and inhibition produced by CO2 was shown to be unaccompanied by injury .
The seeds used in these experiments fall into two classes .
In the first class the seeds germinated at once after removal from the inhibitory CO2 pressures ( beans , cabbage , barley , peas , onions ) .
In the second class the inhibition continued indefinitely after the removal of the inhibitory CO2 pressures , and is terminated only by complete drying ( and rewetting ) , or by the removal of the testa .
In this class a lowering of the permeability of the testa to gases under the influence of CO2 is indicated , a change which would have two results : ( 1 ) a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the embryo ; and ( 2 ) a relative rise in the actual CO2 pressure in the embryo tissues .
The condition of prolonged inhibition after removal to air produced in Brassica alba is strikingly suggestive of the condition of seeds often met with in nature , the germination of which is delayed in spite of suitable conditions of temperature and water .
The results obtained in the laboratory with Brassica alba seeds were reproduced in the soil in natural conditions by CO2 arising from decaying vegetable matter .
The high C02 content of the soil air in these experiments was found to 624 Mr. F. Kidd .
The Controlling Influence of continue for a considerable period .
Attention was called to the importance of these facts in agriculture .
Part II.\#151 ; A long series of experiments was carried out to determine the relation of carbon dioxide inhibition in seeds to temperature and to oxygen supply .
Low temperatures and low oxygen supply were both found to increase the inhibitory value of given partial pressures of C02 , while inversely the inhibitory value of given carbon dioxide pressures diminishes with a rise of temperature and with a rise of oxygen pressure .
The probable relation of these facts to the dormancy of the moist seed in natural conditions was pointed out .
The arrested development of maturing seeds on the plant was shown not to be due to lack of moisture or to any physiological insufficiency .
The seeds in this stage were shown to contain in their tissues more C02 than seeds normally germinating contain at the moment of sprouting .
The presence of the testa was shown constantly to retard the germination both in seeds taken from the parent plant before natural drying and in seeds after complete drying and storing .
Attention was drawn to the correlation found to exist between the viviparous habit and the absence of seed coats .
Carbon dioxide has been considered as a narcotic agent .
Previous work on the action of C02 upon growth has been quoted .
The stimulatory effect of low partial pressures , rising to a maximum with increasing pressures and then declining to inhibition with higher pressures of C02 , has been demonstrated by experiments with Brassica alba and Hordeum germinated in the dark .
In the case of certain rapidly deteriorating seeds ) the carbon dioxide naturally produced by respiration of the seeds in a closed flask rose to 40 per cent , and the presence of this was found to be accompanied by a marked prolongation of vitality in the seeds .
This prolonged vitality was far in excess of that reached with the present commercial method of packing these short-lived seeds for export .
When we correlate the results of these different lines of experiment we seem to get in various directions evidence of the importance of carbon dioxide pressure as a controlling influence in the biology of seeds .
This influence may be formulated briefly in the following principles:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The resting stage of the moist seed is primarily a phase of narcosis induced by the action of carbon dioxide .
( 2 ) Both the arrested development in the case of the moist maturing seed on the plant , and the widely occurring phenomenon of delayed germination in the case of the moist resting seed , which does not germinate although in apparently suitable conditions of .
temperature , moisture , and oxygen supply , Carbon Dioxide in Matura , etc. , of Seeds .
625 are related to an inhibitory partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the tissues of the embryo .
( 3 ) Germination when it takes place is related to a lowering of the value of this inhibitory partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the tissues .
( 4 ) The inhibitory value of a given carbon dioxide pressure diminishes with a rise of temperature .
( 5 ) The inhibitory value of a given carbon dioxide pressure diminishes with a rise of oxygen pressure .
