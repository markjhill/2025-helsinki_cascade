( Abstract .
) The symmetrical properties of plane triangles have been fully expounded in a series of six papers dated 1835 , 1836 , 1842 , 1843 , 1845 , and 1848 respectively , in the ' Lady 's and Gentleman 's Diary , ' published annually by the Stationers ' Company of London .
Either from being the work of different hands , or from the earlier papers having been written before the importance of symmetry in mathematical formulae was duly appreciated , the series of papers leaves much to be desired as to uniformity of method .
By assuming the usual expressions for the area of a triangle , as in the present paper , with a few other expressions of an equally elementary nature , all the well-known symmetrical properties of plane triangles may be readily deduced , by a little skill in the combination of algebraical symbols , without leaving the plane of the triangle .
But the author has preferred to use a method which is at once general , simple , and uniform .
This consists in referring the symmetrical points connected with a triangle to an indefinite plane , and establishing by an elementary process certain general formulae , each of which can be made to yield several cognate plane properties when different definite positions are assigned to the plane of reference .
