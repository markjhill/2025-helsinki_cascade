Two wellknown vectors play the principal parts in any such optical discussion\mdash ; the displacement of the medium and its curl , in the electro-magnetic theory the former is proportional to the magnetic force and the latter to the electric " " displacement To give precision to the discussion we shall deal thoughout with the displacement of the medium , there being no difficulty in , in a similar fashion with the Let the displacement in the incident light be of unit amplitude and polarised in a plane making an angle with the plane of incidence .

At the foot of p. 218 , in quoting the formula from the previous paper , the first factor was left out .
When it is inserted , the modulus of is no longer large , and the follow ing modification becomes necessary .
We have ( E-1 ) If both the terms ( E\mdash ; 1 ) and ( F-E ) ) are to be retained , we would lequire two complex constants to specify the layer of transition , which the experimental knowledge would hardly be adequate to detelmine When , however , snlall , term will 1ible compwison with and en if is not small , the term ill not usually be more than one tenth of the second , the modulus of the factol in the latter being large .
The neglect of the first term may therefore be expected to produce an error of about one-tenth in the estimated co1rection due to the layer of transition for lalge incidences , and practically no elror at all small incidences .
This degree of app1oxima- tion tunately remains adequate , in relation to the exactness of the data utilised in the argument .

These , of course , are the cases of plane polarisation , or S being azimuths in or perpendicular to the plane of incidence , and or being direct or grazing incidence at any azimuth .
For any given azimuth begins at zero for direct incidence , and ends at zero for grazing incidence .
It must pass through certain maxima or minima in this interval .
From the equation for V we see that is stationary when sin2 This is satisfied at the Principal Incidence where , and since is stationary with .

For substances such as diamond , for which the variation of is very rapid in the neighbourhood of the Principal Incidence , the variation of will be mainly controlled by that of , and we shall have a maximum at the Principal Incidence .
With other substances , such as , for which the variation of is less rapid , the increase in may more than counterbalance the decrease in .
In such circumstances will be a minimum at the Principal Incidence , and there will be two maxima on each side of this and not far from it .
Especially with substances of high refractive index , the increase of beyond the Principal Incidence is much more rapid than its decrease before , so that the maximum beyond the Principal Incidence will be further from it than the one below that incidence .
For azimuths greater than , we have , so that diminishes with the increase of .
In this case , therefore , diminishes as the incidence increases beyond the Principal Incidence .
There can thus be no maximum beyond that incidence , the only maximum possible being one very near the Principal Incidence and below it .

For brevity , write , so that we have an equation obviously satisfied by , corresponding to , and clearin of fractions and of the root , we get ; The process of squaring introduces an irrelevant root .
To exclude this the sign of is to be positive , and as is necessarily positive this requires to be positive .
The value of given above makes and as is positive or ative according as the incidence is less or greater than the Principal Incidence , we must take the lower sign below the Principal Incidence and the upper sign beyond it .
Thus below the Principal Incidence we have But is positive , and is also positive , except very near the Principal Incidence .
Hence , except in the immediate neighbourhood of the Principal Incidence , would be negative if were stationary , so that there is no real value of for which is stationary .
Beyond the Principal Incidence our formula gives .
The numerator of this fraction is positive and the denominator negative , except very near the Principal Incidence .
We see then that is negative throughout , except in the immediate vicinity of the Principal Incidence , that diminishes as the azimuth increases for all incidences outside a small region near the Principal Incidence .
This extends on each side of the Principal Incidence from to .

Hence , after passing the azimuth increases from to It is , therefore , a minimum at the azimuth .
It must be remembered , however , that in passing through this azimuth , the angle which the major axis makes with the plane of incidence suddenly changes irom to This means , of course , that the axis is perpendicular to the plane of incidence , instead of being in that plane .
At the Principal Incidence the axis in the plane of incidence is throughout , while the axis perpendicular to that plane is .
As the azimuth increases , the first axis diminishes steadily from to zero , while the second increases steadily from zero to We have still to consider the variations of with the incidence for a given azimuth .
