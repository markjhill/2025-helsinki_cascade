A paper was read , entitled , " Tables of the Variation , through a cycle of nine years , of the mean height of the Barometer , mean Temperature , and depth of Rain , as connected with the prevailing Winds , influenced in their direction by the occurrence of the Lunar Apsides , with some concluding observations on the result .
" By Luke Howard , Esq. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. From the Tables here given , the author draws the following conclusions : ยง 1 .
The barometer is higher under the lunar apogee , than under the perigee ; the mean height in the former case being 29*84517 , and in the latter , 29'75542 .
2 .
The mean temperature is lower under the apogee than under the perigee ; that of the former being 48 ?
#7126 , and of the latter , 49 ?
*0356 .
The mean of the whole year was 48 ?
-7126 .
3 .
The rain of the weeks following the apsis exceeds that under the perigee ; but with two striking exceptions in the annual result of nine year3 , the one in the wettest , and the other in the driest year of the cycle .
With regard to the winds , the author remarks that those from the north , north-east , and east , prevailed under the apogee on 38 days , under the perigee on 21 days ; and those from the south , south-west , and west , prevailed under the apogee on 20 days , under the perigee on 38 days .
It appears , therefore , that in the climate of London , the moon in her perigee brings over us the southern atmosphere , which tends to lower the density and raise the temperature of the air , occasioning also a larger precipitation of rain .
In the apogee , on the contrary , there is a freer influx of air from the northward , a higher barometer , a lower temperature , and less rain ; subject , however , to a large addition of rain under this apsis twice in a cycle of nine years , at the times when also the extremes of wet and dry take place on the whole amount of the year .
