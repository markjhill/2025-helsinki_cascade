two Eyes .
" By T. Wharton Jones , Esq. Communicated by Ri ?
chard Owen , Esq. , F.R.S. The author animadverts on the doctrine which Mr. Wheatstone , in his paper on the Physiology of Binocular vision , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1838 , p. 371 , has advanced , in oppo ?
sition to the received theory of single vision being dependent on the images of objects falling on corresponding points of the two retinse .
He maintains that , under these circumstances , the two impressions are not perceived by the mind at the same instant of time , but sometimes the one and sometimes the other .
If one impression be much stronger than the other , the former predominates over , or even excludes the other ; but still the appearance resulting from the predominating image is nevertheless in some manner influenced by that which is not perceived .
He supposes that there are compartments of the two retinae , having certain limits , of which any one point or papilla of the one corresponds with any one point of the other , so that impressions on them are not perceived separately ; and considers that this hypothesis , combined with the principle above stated , is required , in order to explain the phenomena in question .
