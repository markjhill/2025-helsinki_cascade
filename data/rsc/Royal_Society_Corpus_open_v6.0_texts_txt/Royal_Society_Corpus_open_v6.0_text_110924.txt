" On the Muscularity of the Iris .
" By Professor Maunoir , of Geneva .
Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. The author has satisfied himself , from the result of 'his own dissections , as well as from the concurrent testimony .
of a great number of anatomists , that the iris is provided with two sets of muscular fibres , the one orbicular , immediately surrounding the pupillary margin and acting as a sphincter ; the other , extending in a radiated direction from the exterior circumference of the former to their insertions into the ciliary ligament , their action being to enlarge the pupil .
One-fourth of the disc of the iris is occupied by the orbicular , and the remaining three-fourths:by the radiated muscle .
The author has examined the structure of the iris in a great number of animals , and states the results obtained by M. Lebert , whom he applied to on this occasion , from numerous dissections of the eyes of animals belonging to each class of vertebrata .
He also refers to a work which he published in the year 1812 , entitled " Memoir sir l'Organisation de l'Iris , " for evidence of the muscularity of the iris which he obtained by applying galvanism to the human eye immediately after decapitation ; and he concludes with the narrative of the case of a woman in whose iris there had been formed , by an accidental wound with the point of a knife , a triangular aperture below the pupil .
This aperture became dilated when the pupil was contracted , and vice versed ; thus furnishing a proof that its movements were effected by muscular action.-
