Since our last communication we have continued our experiments , using the electric arc as a source of heat , in lime and in carbon crucibles as described before .
Success depends on the getting a good stream of vapour in the tubular part of the crucible .
This is easily attained in the lime crucibles , which quickly reach a very high temperature , but are very soon destroyed ; not so certainly in the carbon j crucibles , which are good conductors of heat .
The latter , however , j last for a very long time .
In our experiments with tubes heated in a furnace we used a small spectroscope with a single prism , which gave a good definition and plenty of light ; but in the experiments here described we have used a j larger spectroscope by Browning , with two prisms of 60 ' and one of j 45 ' , taking readings on a graduated circle instead of on a reflected scale .
Both in the lime and in the carbon crucibles we have found that the finely channelled spectrum , extending with great uniformity from end to end , always made its appearance so long as the poles were close together .
A few groups of bright lines appear on it .
We have not at present investigated this remarkable spectrum further .
In several cases we have observed the absorption lines of the metals put into the crucibles on this channelled spectrum as a background , but generally when the vapours in the crucibles become considerable , the channellings give place to a spectrum of bright lines on a much less bright continuous background ; we have used generally thirty cells in the galvanic battery , sometimes only twenty-five , once forty .
The calcium line with wave-length 4,226 almost always appears more or less expanded with a dark line in the middle , both in the lime crucibles and in carbon crucibles into which some lime has been introduced ; the remaining bright lines of calcium are also frequently seen in the like condition , but sometimes the dark line appears in the middle of K ( the more refrangible of Fraunhofer 's lines H ) , when there is none in the middle of H. On throwing some aluminium filings into the crucible , the line 4,226 appears as a broad dark band , ancWaoth H and K as well as the two aluminium lines between them appear for a second as dark bands on a continuous background .
Soon they appear as bright bands with dark middles ; gradually the dark line disappears from H , and afterwards from K , VOL. xxviii .

27 while the aluminium lines remain with dark middles for a long time When a mixture of lime and potassium carbonate ( to produce a stronger current of vapour in the tube ) was introduced into a carbon crucible the calcium ( ?
) line with wave-length 4,095 was seen strongly reversed , and the group of three lines with wave-lengths 4,425 4,434 , and 4,454 were all reversed , the least refrangible being the most strongly reversed , and remaining so the longest , while the most refrangible was least strongly reversed and for the shortest time .
Besides these reversals , which were regularly observed , the following were noticed by us as occurring in lime crucibles but with less certainty , perhaps only at the highest temperatures .
Dark ' bands appearing for a short time and dwindling into sharp dark lines with wave-lengths about 6,040 and 6,068 ( perhaps due to the oxide ) ; a dark line replacing the most refrangible of a well-marked group of several bright lines with wave-length 5,581 ( or possibly the brighter line 5,588 ) ; and the lines with wave-lengths 6,121 and 6,161 reversed simultaneously for an instant and reappearing bright immediately ; and the line with wave-length 5,188 reversed .
When aluminium was put into the crucible only the two lines of that metal between H and K were seen reversed .
The lines at the red end remained steadily bright .
When some magnesium was put into a lime crucible , the b group expanded a little without appearing reversed , but when some aluminium was added , the least refrangible of the three lines appeared with a dark middle , and on adding more magnesium the second line put on the same appearance ' ; and lastly , the most refrangible was reversed in like manner .
The least refrangible of the three remained reversed for some time ; and the order of reversibility of the group is the inverse of that of refrangibility .
Of the other magnesium lines , that in the yellowish-green ( wave-length 5,527 ) was much expanded , the blue line ( wave-length 4,703 ) , and a line still more refrangible than the hitherto recorded lines , with wave-length 4,354 , was still more expanded each time that ' magnesium was added .
These last two lines expanded much more on their less refrangible than on their more refrangible sides , and were not seen reversed .
The bright blue line ( wave-length 4,481 ) seen when the spark is used , was not visible either bright or reversed ; and this seems to be in agreement with Capron 's photographs , which show this line very strong with the spark but not with the arc .
The following experiments were made in carbon crucibles:\#151 ; When strontia was put in the lines with wave-lengths 4,607 , 4,215 and 4,079 were all seen with dark lines in the middle , but no reversal of any strontium line less refrangible could be seen .
After adding some aluminium and some potassium carbonate to increase the current of vapour , no reversal of any strontium red line could be detected , though momentary cloudy dark bands were seen in the red when L879 .

369 - ifjj \#166 ; resli strontia was thrown in .
Two dark lines were seen in the ixtreme red , which proved to be the potassium lines reversed ( wave-engths 7,670 and 7,700 ) .
With a mixture of barium and potassium carbonates the line with vave-length 5,535 was strongly reversed , and that with wave-length i,933 distinctly so .
When barium chlorate was dropped into a cruci-ale , the four lines with wave-lengths 4,553 , 4,933 , 5,535 , and 5,518 , were reversed , and as they remained so for some time , it is probable that the action of the oxygen of the chlorate had nothing to do with the \#187 ; esult .
The last-named line ( 5,518 ) was the least strongly reversed .
To observe particularly the effects of potassium a mixture of lime ind potassium carbonate previously ignited was thrown in .
The violet lines of potassium , wave-length 4,044 , came out immediately as a broad black band , which soon resolved into two narrower dark bands having n wave-lengths nearly 4,042 and 4,045 .
On turning to the red end the : two extreme red lines were both seen reversed .
No lines of potassium between the two extremes could be seen reversed , but the group of m three yellow lines were all expanded though not nebulous , and other lines in the green were seen much expanded .
These observations on potassium were more than once repeated with the same results .
Using sodium carbonate only the D lines were seen reversed though the other lines were expanded , and the pairs in the green had each f\#174 ; become a very broad nebulous band , and D almost as broad a black band .
When sodium chlorate was dropped into a crucible , the pair of fifi with wave-lengths 5,681 , 5,687 , were both momentarily reversed , is* the latter much more strongly than the former .
up 11 When a very little charred rubidium tartrate was put in , the two fa violet lines were sharply reversed , appearing only as black lines on a into continuous light background .
Turning to the red end , the more refran- ?
ii* gible of the two lines in the extreme red ( wave-length 7,800 ) was seen i t have a decided dark line in the middle , and it continued so for some ib time .
The addition of more rubidium Tailed to cause any reversal of 10 !
the extreme red line , or of any but the three lines already mentioned .
On putting some lithium carbonate into the crucible , the violet line cit lithium appeared as a nebulous band , and on adding some aluminium piDjj this violet band became enormously expanded , but showed no reversal .
.'B\#174 ; The blue lithium line ( wave-length 4,604 ) was well reversed , as was also the red line , while a fine dark line passed through the middle of the orange line .
On adding now a mixture of aluminium filings , and carbonates of lithium and potassium , the red line became a broad black band , and the orange line was well reversed .
The green line was exceedingly bright , but not nebulous or reversed , and the violet :rt\lt ; i line still remained much expanded , but unreversed .
With regard to the green lithium line , we may remark that we have no doubt whatever that it belongs to lithium , and that there must have been some tcttl * !

Living and Dewar [ Feb. 27 , mistake in Thalen 's observation , which ascribed it to caesium .
W\#171 ; have never detected this line with caesium , which , on the other hand seems always to give the characteristic blue lines , both in the spark and in the flame , as well as to give the same lines reversed when its ' vapour is used as an absorbent .
When metallic indium was introduced into the crucible , both the lines with wave-lengths 4,101 and 4,509 were at once seen stronglj reversed , and so continued for some time .
No other absorption lint of indium could be detected .
It is apparent that the expansion of lines , so often observed when fresh materials are introduced , must be ascribed to increase in the density of the vapours , not to any increase of temperature .
Moreover , the length of tube which reaches a very high temperature in the experiments above described is very short in the lime crucibles , and still shorter in the carbon crucibles , so that the reversing layer is also short in many cases .
We are , therefore , directing our attention to the means of heating up a longer length of the tubes , either by introducing oxy-hydrogen jets , or additional electric arcs one above another ; and also to the introduction of reducing gas ( hydrogen or carbonic oxide ) to counteract the oxidising action of the air which is drawn in through the lateral openings .
The curious behaviour of the lines of different spectra with , regard to reversal has induced us to compare the bright lines of the chromosphere of the sun , as observed by Young , with those that are reversed in our crucibles .
It is well known that some of the principal lines of metals giving comparatively simple spectra , such as lithium , aluminium , strontium , and potassium , are not represented amongst the dark lines of Fraunhofer , while other lines of those metals are seen : and an examination of the bright chromospheric lines shows that special rays highly characteristic of bodies which appear from other rays to be present in the chromosphere are absent , or are less frequent in their occurrence than others .
In the following tables the relation between our observations on reversals and Young 's on the chromospheric lines is shown .

In a subsequent communication we intend to examine carefully the contents of the preceding table .
In the meantime we may remark that the group calcium , barium , and strontium , on the one hand , and sodium , lithium , magnesium , and hydrogen , on the other , seem to behave in a similar way in the chromosphere of the sun .
