] The instrument described by Mr. Ritchie in this paper , consists of two hollow cylinders of tin-plate , of large diameters in proportion to their height , placed with their bases parallel to each other , and at a moderate distance , and connected by a glass thermometer-tube , containing a coloured liquid , and in the form of an inverted syphon , after the manner of the photometer described by the same author in the Philosophical Transactions for last year .
This instrument being placed between two sources of radiant heat ; at such distances that the coloured liquid shall remain stationary in the tube , fixes the distances of equal radiation , from whence the radiations at equal distances may be calculated , supposing the law of the decrease of heat by radiation known , and vice versed , supposing the ratio of the heats radiated at equal distances known , the law of radiation may be experimentally investigated .
As instances of the application of this instrument to experimental purposes , the author relates several experiments on iron balls , equally heated , and exposed at such distances as to subtend equal apparent diameters at the faces of the cylinders .
From these he concludes that the law of the decrease of heat , as the inverse squares of the distances , is founded in fact .
When , however , the heated bodies exposed had flat surfaces corresponding to those of the surfaces of the cylinders , he found a less rapid law of decrease to hold good ; from which he concludes , that a constant portion of heat is radiated directly out from the surface without divergence , because an equal quantity , added to both terms of a ratio of greater inequality , as is well known , diminishes the ratio .
