A Report on the Stomach of the Zariffa .
By Sir Everard Home , Bart. V.P.R.S. Read December 24 , 1829 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1830 , p. 85 .
] In common with other ruminant quadrupeds , the Zariffa has a stomach consisting of four cavities .
The efflorescence which lines the paunch is similar to that of the bullock , but is more prominent ; the second cavity is destitute of the cellular structure met with in other ruminants , but the third and fourth cavities exhibit no peculiarities ; the cud formed from the leaves and twigs of the acacia , which are the natural food of the Zariffa , is so succulent , as not to require being again moistened in passing through the second stomach , as is the case with grass ; this cavity is therefore not furnished with the cells which are provided for this purpose in herbivorous quadrupeds .
Three drawings of the structure of the parts described accompany the paper .
