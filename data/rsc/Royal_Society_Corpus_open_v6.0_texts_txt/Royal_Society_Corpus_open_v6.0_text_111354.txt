( Abstract .
) The resultant of two equations such as ( a , b,..*X y)Y0 ( P , ( 7,. .
2 , Yr= 0 is , it is well known , a function homogeneous in regard to the coefficients of each equation separately , viz. of the degree n in regard to the coefficients ( a , b,. .
) of the first equation , and of the degree m in regard to the coefficients ( p , q,. .
) of the second equation ; and it is natural to develope the resultant in the form kAP + ktAtPt + &amp;c. , where A , At , &amp;c. are the combinations ( powers and products ) of the degree n in the coefficients ( a , b,. .
) , P , P ' , &amp;c. are the combinations of the degree m in the coefficients ( p , q,. .
) , and k , k ' , &amp;c. are mere numerical coefficients .
The object of the present memoir is to show how this may be conveniently effected , either by the method of symmetric functions , or from the known expression of the resultant in the form of a determinant , and to exhibit the developed expressions for the resultant of two equations , the degrees of which do not exceed 4 .
With respect to the first method , the formula in its best form , or nearly so , is given in the 'Algebra ' of Meyer Hirsch , and the application of it is very easy when the necessary tables are calculated : as to this , see my " Memoir on the Symmetric Functions of the Roots of an Equationi .
" But when the expression for the resultant of two equations is to be calculated without the assistance of such tables , it is , I think , by far the most simple process to develope the determinant according to the second of the two methods .
