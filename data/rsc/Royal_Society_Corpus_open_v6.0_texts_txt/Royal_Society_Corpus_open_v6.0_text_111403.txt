Although zincethyl and its homologues are now well known to be capable of replacing electro-negative elements by ethyl , &amp;c. , yet it could scarcely have been anticipated , that substitutions of an almost opposite character would be effected by the same reagent ; nevertheless I find that zincethyl is capable of removing one of the atoms of hydrogen in ammonia and its analogues , and of replacing it by zinc , thus forming a series of bodies which strongly remind us of the amide and nitride of potassium .
The general nature of this reaction by which the compounds described below are produced , may be thus expressed : N { Y+ =N { +4}H C4 zn H When dry ammoniacal gas is passed through an ethereal solution of zincethyl , it is rapidly absorbed , and soon afterwards torrents of a combustible gas free from nitrogen begin to be evolved .
After the current has been continued for more than an hour , the absorption altogether ceases , and the ethereal liquid deposits a copious white amorphous precipitate , which yielded on analysis numbers leading to the formula fH NH Zn .
The analysis of the combustible gas proved that 1 vol. consumed 3'43 vols .
oxygen , and generated 1'95 vol. carbonic acid ; numbers almost identical with those yielded by hydride of ethyl , with which the gas is also identical in specific gravity .
These results prove that zincethyl acts upon ammoniacal gas in the following manner : H [ II J Zn Zn5 N4C Ho N =N{z +I H } }H 4{ Zn The solid product of the reaction , for which I propose the name zincamide , is a white amorphous body insoluble in ether , and instantly decomposed by water and alcohol , with evolution of great heat , and in such a manner as to regenerate ammonia .
Thus with water the following equation expresses the reaction : N { H + H } ?

Zincamide can bear a temperature of 200 ?

Nitride of zinc is a grey pulverulent body , which is neither fused , decomposed , nor volatilized at a red heat out of contact with air .
It is decomposed by water with great violence ; in fact , if the nitride be merely moistened with water , it becomes red-hot .
Several analyses prove that the formula of nitride of zinc is N Zn Zn .
The study of the products of its decomposition by water shows that the reaction may be thus expressed:fZn f Zicnphenylimide .
N 11 ( Zn .
This body is produced by the action of zincethyl upon anhydrous aniline , The reaction is so violent that it requires to be moderated by diluting the zincethyl with ether .
Heat is evolved , and a large quantity of a combustible gas is rapidly generated .
At length the liquid becomes a white , semisolid , opake mass .
Analysis proved the gas to be pure hydride of ethyl , whilst the solid body regenerated aniline in contact with water .
The production of zincphenylimide may therefore be thus expressed N{I2 fl C4 }-N { l + E4 ยง 5 } in ylimide a hit am o bodyverysimilar to zin Zincphenylimide is a white amorphous body:very/ similar to zineamide .
Like the latter body , it is instantly decomposed by water , aniline being regenerated:iN I1 +I 2=N H+2 Zn It1 Diethylzincamine .
N { C4H5 Zn .
This body is produced by the action of zincethyl upon diethylamine .
The reaction requires to be aided by heat .
Pure hydride of ethyl is evolved , and the following equation expresses the reaction : C{45 1n C45 11 N C4 I-I+ H } =N C4 04 , 4 } , Its reactions are quite similar to those of the bodies above described .
Zincoximide .
C 0 , NH Zn .
Dry oxamide and pure zincethyl are without any action upon each other at ordinary temperatures , but the heat of a water-bath is sufficient to establish a violent reaction , torrents of pure hydride of ethyl are evolved , and zincoximide combined with zincethyl remains in the retort .
The following equation expresses the reaction:c2 ( 2 { I2 O Zn }C I}.N g+2 ( ZnC4 H5=N N1+ nJ+ +CH R Zii 4 5~~~~~~-l Zincacetimide .
C4 H1 02 N 11 Zn , Aceta-mide and zincethyl act upon each other very violently ; a large quantity of gas is evolved , which analysis proves to be hydride of ethyl .
Zincacetimide is contained in the residue as a white , amorphous , pulverulent solid , which is reconverted into acetamide by contact with water .
These reactions establish the fact , that by the action of zincethyl one of the atoms of hydrogen , in ammonia and analogous nitrogen compounds , combines with ethyl and becomes replaced by zinc .
It will be interesting to extend this reaction to the nitryles , especially such as contain electro-negative radicals of the othyl family , since we may thus expect to obtain a new series of double radicals , amongst which the ketones will perhaps find a home .
1 hope soon to lay the results of this extension of the investigation before the Royal Society .
