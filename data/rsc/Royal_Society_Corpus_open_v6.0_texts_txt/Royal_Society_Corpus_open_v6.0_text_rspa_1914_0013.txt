) The spectrum of the gases of atmospheric air which were not condensed at the temperature of liquid hydrogen was first investigated by Living and Dewar* who found a large number of lines which did not belong to the spectra of hydrogen or helium .
The spectrum of the glow from the negative pole was photographed , owing to the fact that the secondary spectrum of hydrogen was predominant in the capillary .
It was found that , whilst the secondary hydrogen spectrum disappeared when a jar discharge was used , the greater part of the lines of unknown origin were also obliterated .
Stassanof has enumerated about one hundred lines of the spectrum of the aurora , from the results of different observers , two-thirds of which he has found to be identical , within the limits of experimental error , with the lines of unknown origin recorded by Living and Dewar .
Neon in a state of great purity was subsequently prepared at University College , London , and its spectrum was measured by Baly , | who observed that the spectrum was not appreciably altered when the discharge from a Leyden jar and spark-gap was used .
Five years later the spectrum was again measured by Watson , S who confirmed the measurements of Baly , and added a considerable number of lines which had not been previously observed .
Watson was unable to find any trace on his plates of a large number of the lines found by Living and Dewar ( loc. cit. ) , and no satisfactory explanation for the origin of these lines has been found .
In the present investigation 1 have examined the spectra obtained under different conditions with two vacuum tubes which had been filled at University College with neon , which was presumably as pure as that used by Watson and Baly .
No trace of any impurity could be detected in the spectrum from the capillary , though the hydrogen lines could be faintly seen in the glow around the electrodes .
The spectra were photographed with a large Hilger wave-length spectro* 'Roy .

scope with a camera attachment , and with a grating spectrograph having a inch concave grating of 4 feet radius , ruled with 20,000 lines to the inch .
The latter instrument had the advantage of a high dispersion and consequently increased accuracy , with the disadvantage that long exposures of upwards of 10 hours were required to obtain satisfactory photographs .
A comparison was made of the spectra obtained with a weak discharge from an induction coil ( equal to about a half-inch spark in air ) and with the same discharge when a small Leyden jar and a spark-gap of about 2 mm. were used .
The intensity of the discharge was not great enough to bring out any lines due to the electrodes or the glass walls of the capillary .
The neon tubes , which are known to deteriorate , were not at all rapidly destroyed by the strength of the discharge used .
With the jar discharge the lines of the ordinary neon spectrum in the red and orange were much weaker , but no new lines could be detected .
In the more refrangible region , however , the spectra were entirely different , consisting of a large number of lines which were not present in the ordinary neon spectrum , while the strongest of the ordinary neon lines were only just visible .
The most refrangible rays measured , having wave-lengths 3218 A.U. and upwards , must have been of very considerable intensity , since they had to pass through the glass walls of the capillary .
The wave-lengths of most of these lines have been measured from photographs taken with the grating spectrograph , using the helium lines as standards , but some of the lines in the green were so feeble that this was not possible , and their wave-lengths were accordingly measured with an accuracy of +1 A.U. from photographs taken with a very long exposure on the prism spectrograph .
A comparison of measurements made on three plates shows that the differences between the mean wave-length and the least concordant measurement are on the average 0'04 A.U. In a few of the fainter lines , however , which were also somewhat diffuse , the differences were as great as 0T A.U. ( and in one case 0T2 A.U. ) .
The measurements are therefore given to five significant figures , the probable error being less than 0T A.U. In the following table are given the wave-lengths of the lines , together with their intensities expressed in the usual way on an ascending scale from 1 to 10 .
In the third column are given the corresponding values found by Living and Dewar , and in the fourth the values of lines which possibly correspond , given by Watson .
The latter only correspond in a few cases , the strongest lines in the ordinary spectrum being feebly visible in the new spectrum .
The red yellow and yellow green lines which occur in both spectra have not been included in the list .

On the other hand , about 50 per cent , of the lines given by Living and Dewar have not been found .
This may be due to some differences in the spectra from the wide part of the tube and the capillary , but more probably to the fact that the illumination with the concave grating used in the present investigation was far less than with the calcite prism spectrograph used by Living and Dewar .
There can be little doubt , however , that the lines in question correspond , and there is no Anniversary Address by Sir A. Geikie .
systematic agreement between the wave-lengths of the lines found and those of any probable impurity .
It would appear , therefore , that neon , like argon , krypton and xenon , is capable of giving two different spectra according to the manner in which it is electrically excited .
I should like to express my sincere thanks to Sir James Dewar for the kind advice he has given me .
Address of the President , Sir Archibald , K.C.B. , at the Anniversary Meeting on December 1 , 1913 .
On these annual occasions it is usual to begin the retrospect of the year by discharging the melancholy duty of taking note of the losses which death has inflicted on our Society since the last Anniversary .
On the present occasion we are fortunate in not having to deplore the passing away of any of the distinguished men who form the remarkable band of our Foreign Members .
But on the other hand , the blanks which have been made in our Home List are exceptionally heavy , for no fewer than twenty of our Fellows have died , and among these some whose places it will for many years be hard to fill .
Especially numerous and serious have been the losses among those who represent the various departments of the Physical Sciences .
In George Howard Darwin we mourn the departure of one of the most brilliant and most estimable of our colleagues , who by the originality and distinction of his researches amply sustained the scientific renown of our publications and enhanced the prestige of the Society .
He was elected a Fellow in 1879 , served repeatedly on the Council , and was Vice-President during the last year of his presence there .
He was awarded a Royal Medal in 1884 , and only two years ago received as the crowning mark of our appreciation of his achievements in science the award of the Copley Medal .
There was a widespread hope among the Fellows that he would this year be elected to the Presidential Chair of the Royal Society .
But , while still with the promise of further years of fruitful work before him , he was attacked by a fatal disease which carried him off on December 7 last in the 68th year of his age .
With admiration and pride we recall the keen insight and the laborious but brilliant calculations which culminated in the production of George Darwin 's memorable essays on the history of our planet and its VOL. LXXXIX.\#151 ; A. 2 N
