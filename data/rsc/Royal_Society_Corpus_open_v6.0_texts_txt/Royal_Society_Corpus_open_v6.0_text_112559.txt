Stockholm , June 7th , 1868 .
SIR , --I had last night the honour of receiving your letter , and hasten to express my gratitude for the offer of some magnetical instruments .
As an able eleve of Prof. Edlund , Dr. Lemstrom , will join the expedition , exclusively for studying the meteorology and terrestrial magnetism of these remote regions , I hope that these instruments will be often and advantageously employed .
But the expedition will start from Gottenburg the 1st July , orfrom Tromso the 9th July .
The boxes can be addressed to Count Ehrenward , Gottenburg , or Consul Aagaard , Tromso .
Excepting myself and two officers of the Navy ( Capt. Baron v. Otter and Lieutenant Palander ) , the expedition will consist ofDoctor Malmgren , , , Smitt , Smitt , * }Zoologists .
Nystriom , Mr. Iolmgren , J Doctor Fries , B eren r Botanists .
, , ergren , j Doctor Lemstrom , " Physiker .
" A Geologist , a Conservator , and about 20 Mariners .
464 [ June 18 , Almost all the zoologists and botanists will , however , return in September , with a ship hired for the purpose , and the remaining party will try to go further northward , west , or eastward , from the north-west part of Spitzbergen , where the expedition can obtain a sufficient dep6t of English coal .
We will also try to employ the brown coal of King 's Bay ; but I fear this supply is not to be relied upon .
