An Account of the improvement of Optic Glasses .
There came lately from Paris a Relation , concerning the Improvement of Optic Glasses , not long since attempted at Rome by Signor Giuseppe Campani , and by him discoursed of , in a Book , Entitled , Ragguaglio di nuoue Osservationi , lately printed in the said City , but not yet transmitted into these parts ; wherein these following particulars , according to the Intelligence , which was sent hither , are contained .
The First regards the excellency of the long Telescopes , made by the said Campani , who pretends to have found a way to work great Optic Glasses with a Turne-tool , without any Mould : And whereas hitherto it hath been found by Experience , that small Glasses are in proportion better to see with , upon the Earth , than the great ones ; that Author affirms , that his are equally good for the Earth , and for making Observations in the Heavens .
Besides , he uses three Eye-Glasses for his great Telescopes , without finding any Iris , or such Rain-bow colours , as do usually appear in ordinary Glasses , and prove an impediment so Observations .
The Second , concerns the Circle of Saturn , in which he hath observed nothing , but what confirms Monsieur Christian Huygens de Zulichem his Systeme of that Planet , published by that worthy Gentleman in the year , 1659 .
The Third , respects Jupiter , wherein Campani affirms he hath observed by the goodness of his Glasses , certain protuberancies and inequalities , much greater than those that have been seen therein hitherto .
He adds , that he is now observing , whether those sallies in the said Planet do not change their scituation , which if they should be found to do , he judges , that Jupiter might then be said to turn upon his Axe ; which , in his opinion , would serve much to confirm the opinion of Copernicus .
Besides this , he affirms , he hath remarked in the Belts of Jupiter , the shaddows of his satellites , and followed them , and at length seen them emerge out of his Disk .
