] The great loss formerly experienced by the mustiness of imported grain , led the author , some years ago , to the means now described of removing the taint , and which he conceives may be advantageously applied to the large quantities of corn which were unavoidably housed in a damp state , in consequence of the unpropitious weather , during the late harvest .
The author considers the mustiness to be confined principally to the exterior amylaceous part of the grain , and the process proposed consists in pouring upon the tainted grain thrice its quantity of boiling water .
When cold , the water and floating grains are to be poured off ; the corn is to be washed with cold water , drained , and carefully kiln-dried .
It will be found perfectly sweet , and the loss of weight is inconsiderable .
The advantages of this process are its simplicity and cheapness ; and although the author has hitherto only applied it to wheat , there can , he observes , be little doubt that oats and other grain may be deprived of must with equal success .
