( Abstract .
) I. On Cholophaeine or Bilirubine and its Compounds .
Sect. 1 .
The paper commences with a short historical retrospect on the literatureof the subject under consideration , in which the researches of Berzelius , Scherer , Hein , Marchand , Heintz , Maly , and Stadeler are mentioned .
Sect. 2 .
The author then describes the mode of obtaining a red colouringmatter from ox-gallstones .
These concretions have to be extracted with water , alcohol , ether , dilute hydrochloric acid , and ultimately , after repeated extraction with boiling alcohol and ether , with chloroform .
This agent dissolves bili'ubine or cholophceine , and deposits it , on concentration and the addition of absolute alcohol , in an amorphous condition , or in a crystallized state .
Sect. 3 .
The crystals are dark brown , and have a splendid blue lustre .
They are rhombic plates , as represented by a drawing in outline taken from a specimen magnified about twenty times .
The amorphous or only crystalline modification is a powder of a splendid red , nearly orange-colour .
Sect. 4 .
The elementary analysis of several specimens yielded results which led to the formula C9 H , N 02 .
Sect. 5 .
Bilirubine dissolves in ammonia , but does not form any permanent compound with it .
Its combinations with fixed caustic alkalies are insoluble in an excess of lye .
The neutral alkali solution , mostly the one in ammonia , yields neutral salts with monodynamic metals , half-acid salts with didynamic ones .
The neutral monohydcrated cholophceinate of silver , C , H1 , Ag NO3 , Ag=37'5 per cent. , is a reddish-brown precipitate , which does not lose the atom of water at 110 ?
C. As a hydrated silver-salt it is anomalous ; but a few other animal products , such as hippuric acid , are known also to form such hydrated silver-salts .
By means of this compound , the formula of bilirubine , or cholophaeine , above given , is shown to express its atomic weight .
The basic anhydrous cholopheinate of silver , C , H , Ag , NO2 , Ag =57'29 per cent. , is obtained from an alkaline solution of cholophaeinc and silver nitrate in ammonia , by cautiously reducifig the amount of free alkali by means of nitric acid .
The compound is analogous to a lead-salt , C9 HT P-b NO , described lower down .
The neutral cholophceinate of barium is precipitated from an alkaline solution , and has the composition C H1 , ,2 Ba N , 0 , , Ba=27'56 per cent. The half-acid cholopheeinate or sesquicholophceinate is C27 H2 , Ba N3 08 , Ba=-2075 per cent. , and precipitated by neutral Ba salts from a neutral solution in ammonia .
The differences between these salts were established in all their details by analyses , the means of which compare with theory as follows : Neutral salt .

10 10-17 710 6-91 The calcium compound , on the basis of which Stideler had assumed C16 H118 N2 03 to be the atomic formula of bilirubine , had yielded him ( one analysis ) 91 per cent. of calcium oxide , therefore less calcium than was found in the analysis of the half-acid salt , or 6-5 per cent. There is no doubt that Stddeler had this half-acid compound before him .
He unfortunately obtained the most unstable and uncertain of all the compounds of bilirubine , and mistook it for a neutral salt , abandoning his former correct analysis and formula of free bilirubine .
With Stadeler 's last formula of bilirubine fall the formule of all other substances described by him under the names of biliverdite , biliprasin , bilifuscine , and bilihumine .
The half-acid cholophceinate of zinc , C27 H29 Zn N3 O , , with 11 05 per cent. of Zn , and the neutral cholophaceinate of lead , C18 H20 Pb N20 , Pb=36-50 per cent. , were also obtained .
Basic cholophceinate of lead is analogous to the basic silver-salt , as in it two atoms of hydrogen are replaced by one didynamic atom of lead .
Formula=C H7P-b NO2 , -Pb=56'25 per cent. Some copper compounds were also obtained .
A new reaction for cholopheine is given .
It consists in dissolving the dry powder in fuming sulphuric acid .
A splendid green is at once produced .
The substance is not biliverdine , but a product which , when isolated , contains an atom of water more than bilirubine , and is C9 IIn NO3 , and is named cholothalline by the author .
Cholothalline colours wool of a fast green , indestructible by acid , discharged by ammonia .
Cholophoeine also yields a blue-coloured substance by treatment with nitric acid ( cholocyanine ) , of which the peculiar spectrum was determined .
A great number of green , blue , violet , and red bodies can be produced by appropriate agents , which , if they could be obtained on a large scale , might find technical application .
II .
On Biliverdine or Cholochlorine and its Compounds .
Sect. 1 treats of the mode of obtaining biliverdine .
Cholophaeine is dissolved in carbonate of potassium , and warmed while a current of air is passed through it .
When the solution is green , it is precipitated with hydrochloric acid .
The precipitated biliverdine is easily soluble in alcohol .
Sect. 2 describes the physical properties of biliverdine , as a non-crystalline splendidly green substance , the solution of which gives no particular absorption phenomena in the spectrum .
Sect 3 gives the elementary analyses and theory of biliverdine , which led to the formula C , HJ NO2 .
Thus it was shown that it originated from cholophaeine by the addition of oxygen and subsequent subtraction of carbonic acid .
C9 H , NO2+20=-8 HN O+ CO , .
Sect. 4 .
treats of the compounds of biliverdine .
The calcium-salt was not obtained pure .
The barium-salt appeared to be G2 , II,7 Ba N3 , O , and was precipitated by baryta-water from an alcoholic solution of biliverdine .
It consequently consisted of one atom of the neutral salt with an atom of biliverdine and one of water .
Lead and copper compounds were also obtained .
No insoluble silver-salt could be obtained .
The addition of oxide of silver to an alcoholic solution caused a reaction , consisting in an oxidation of the biliverdine .
A new reaction for biliverdine is stated .
When dissolved in alcoholic ammonia , and boiled with an ammoniacal solution of silver nitrate , silver is deposited , and on addition of an acid a splendid purple matter is produced ( bilipurpine ) .
Of these new substances and others the author hopes to treat in future communications .
Chlorine and other substitution-products are also mentioned .
The foregoing contributions will make the chemistry of the bile in the main complete .
Human bile contains cholophleine , but most commonly by the side of it bilifuscine , a brown substance to be treated of hereafter .

Uromelanine is a product of decomposition of the yellow-coloured ingredient of the urine , urochrome .
Its atomic weight ( 733 ) is higher than that of any other product of decomposition of animal or organic matter ; it contains neither sulphur nor iron .
While the analyses of 219 cholophmeine and biliverdine have shown that they have no apparent relation to hematine , as was formerly supposed , the analyses of uromelanine have made it probable that this substance is a derivative of the coloured part of the blood , cruorine or hematocrystalline , not , however , of hematine , for the atomic weight of hematine is apparently smaller than that of uromelanine .
But crystallized cruorine has an atomic weight of about 13,000 ( -Fe=0'45 per cent. ) .
From such a body urochrome , including as it does uromelanine , uropittine , omicholine , and perhaps other matters ( to be described in future communications ) , might be derived with an atomic weight of perhaps 1500 , being itself near that of albumen ( 1612 ) , but unable to derive from it .
The author thinks it possible that the quantity of blood-disintegration might be measured by determining the amount of uromelanine obtainable from given quantities of urine excreted in given times .
In any case uromelanine is one of the most remarkable substances in the whole domain of organic and animal chemistry , and the further study of its metamorphoses cannot fail to yield highly interesting results .
