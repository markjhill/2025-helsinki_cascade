1047 18 9 \#163 ; 2265 18 9 Report of the Kew Committee for the Year ending October 31 , 1873 .
The only change of consequence affecting the management of the Observatory during the year has been caused by the resignation by Mr. Spottiswoode of his seat on the Committee .
The vacancy thus Occasioned has been filled up by the appointment of Major-Gen .
Strachey , while the Earl of Rosse has been nominated as an additional member of the Committee .
Magnetic Worlc.\#151 ; The series of automatic records of the several Magnetographs , viz. Declinometer , Horizontal-E orce , and Vertical-E orce instruments , have been continued , and the independent absolute determinations have been , as usual , made monthly .
This latter duty has been , as heretofore , performed by Mr. G. M. Whipple , B.Sc. , First Assistant , who also takes charge of the'General Magnetic Work , in which he has the assistance of Mr. Cullum .
The salaries of these two gentlemen , whose time is chiefly devoted to magnetic work , amounted during the period under consideration to \lt ; \#163 ; 249 12s .
6d .
, leaving a balance of about \lt ; \#163 ; 350 out of the sum of \lt ; \#163 ; 608 0s .
7 d.received from the Royal Society to meet the general expenses ( \#163 ; 1979 10s .
7 d.)of the Observatory .
\#163 ; 673 4s .
5 of this amount has been defrayed by the Meteorological Office ; and \#163 ; 613 0s .
1 has been obtained from other sources , such as fees for verification of instruments , and payments for new instruments for foreign observatories , leaving a balance in hand of \#163 ; 522 3s .
Id. on the 31st of October .
Report of the Keiv Committee .
21 On the 2nd of December the suspension-thread of the Declinometer gave way and was replaced by a new one .
Arrangements have been made to dismount the Magnetograph instruments in the course of the ensuing year , on the occasion of painting the basement story , in order to have them thoroughly examined and readjusted\#151 ; a step which has become necessary , as their continuous action has not been interrupted for 15 years .
As regards the Magnetic Seductions , the Tabulations of Declination have been continued to the end of 1872 ; and copies of the results have been entrusted , for discussion , to the two Sergeants of the Eoyal Artillery who are located at Kew , as explained in the last Eeport .
Magnetic data have been supplied to Prof. Balfour Stewart , F.E.S. , Owens Coll. , Manchester , Prof. Atkinson , B. Mil .
Coll. , Sandhurst , Mr. W. Gee , Cheetham Hill , Manchester , Mr. H. Proctor , N. Shields , Mr. Beid , and to Dr. Stein of Frankfort .
The stock of forms having become exhausted , care has been taken in ordering a fresh supply to procure a quantity sufficient to meet possible requisitions from other observatories .
A Unifilar and Dip-circle , formerly in store at the Observatory , have been repaired and set to rights , preparatory to their being lent to the Eev .
S. J. Perry for use on the expedition to observe the Transit of Venus .
Meteorological Work.\#151 ; The several self-recording instruments , registering respectively the Pressure , Temperature , Vapour-tension , Eainfall , and Wind , have been maintained in constant action under the superintendence of Mr. T. W. Baker , Second Assistant , aided by Mr. Figg ; and the daily standard eye-observations for control of the photographic records have been made regularly .
The instrumental traces with hourly tabulated values are sent monthly to the Meteorological Office as in former years .
The Barograms and Thermograms are printed off in duplicate , and one copy is preserved at Kew .
As regards the Anemograms and Bain-records , the copy has been obtained by the method of tracing .
In addition to the regular work of Kew as a Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory , the duty of examining and checking the work of all the seven Self-recording Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological Office has been carried on , in accordance with the method described in the Eeport of the British Association for 1869 .
This portion of the work has been performed by Messrs. Eigby and Foster .
A series of experiments are being carried on at the expense of the Meteorological Committee , at the Pagoda in Kew Gardens , to test the influence of height above the ground on temperature .
The thermometers are placed at three different levels , viz. 22 feet 6 inches , 69 feet , and 128 feet 10 inches above the ground .
Copies of Meteorological data have been supplied to Mr. G. J. Symons and the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers .
Report of the Kew Committee .
Photoheliograph.\#151 ; As soon as the experiments with this instrument mentioned in last Report were completed it was taken down , and , on application from the Astronomer Royal , entrusted to him for use at Greenwich , in taking sun-pictures pending the return of the new instruments to be used in observing the Transit of Yenus .
The scale of equal parts , erected on the Pagoda in Kew Gardens , in order to test the optical distortion ( if any ) of the Kew Photoheliograph , has been taken down by the direction of Mr. De La Rue , and any slight damage done to the building has been made good at the expense of that gentleman , and to the satisfaction of the Clerk of the Works at Kew .
The scale itself has been made over to the Astronomer Royal by Mr. De La Rue .
The thanks of the Committee have been conveyed to H.M. 's Office of Works for the facilities kindly afforded for the above experiments .
The eye-observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , have been made daily by Mr. Poster , when possible , as described in the last Report , in order , for the present , to maintain the continuity of the Kew record of sun-spots .
An additional series of positives , from the Kew negative pictures , is now being printed by a photographer , at the expense of Mr. De La Rue .
A statement , embodying the usual data respecting the spots \amp ; c. on the sun 's disk , has been , as usual , published in the ' Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
' Prof. Spoerer , of Anclam , has applied for the measurements of sunspots for the months of January and Pebruary 1872 , during the period of his own illness ; and Mr. De La Rue has kindly promised to furnish them as soon as their reduction has been effected .
Electrometer.\#151 ; This instrument , the property of the Meteorological Committee , which was returned for readjustment to the maker , Mr. White , of Glasgow , in September 1872 ( Report , 1872 ) , is still in his hands .
The instrument , a self-recording one , has never yet been in working order .
Verifications.\#151 ; This department of the Observatory has been in full activity ; and the work has increased largely as regards barometers and clinical thermometers , so that almost the entire time of Mr. Baker and a junior assistant is occupied therewith .
The following magnetic instruments have been verified and constants determined:\#151 ; A TJnifilar for the Observatory at Manila .
" " Prof. Clifton , P.R.S. , Oxford .
" " Dr. E. van Rijckevorsel , of Rotterdam .
And in addition:\#151 ; A Dip-circle for the Observatory at Manila .

Report of the Kew Committee .
3 Dip-circles for Mr. L. P. Casella , London .
2 Dipping-needles for H.M.S. * Challenger .
' An Azimuth Compass for Mr. Ney Elias , F.R.G.S. Determinations of the Moments of Inertia have been made of two magnets used by Capt. F. J. Evans , C.B. , F.R.S. , when swinging iron ships .
Several instruments are on hand awaiting verification .
Among them may be mentioned a Unifilar and Dip-circle received from Prof. Stewart , for use abroad , and a set of Magnets , for determination of their constants , destined for the observatory of Don Luiz at Lisbon .
At the request of the Rev. S. J. Perry , a complete set of Magnetographs have been ordered for transmission to Zi-ka-wei , near Shanghai , to the Rev. A. M. Colombel , who received instruction at Kew in the year 1868 .
The meteorological instruments which have been verified are as follows :\#151 ; Barometers , Standards ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

1233 In addition , nine Kew Standard Thermometers have been calibrated and divided at Kew , and two glass tubes have been graduated to millimetres .
The following miscellaneous instruments have also been verified :\#151 ; Rain-gauge , 1 , with graduated glass .
Robinson 's Dial-anemometer , 1 .
Allusion was made in the last Report to the difficulty of testing anemometers , owing to the limitation of space at disposal for the purpose .
In the course of the year a grant was obtained from the Government-Grant Committee for the purpose of carrying on a series of such experiments ; and a piece of ground in the Park has been rented .
Several anemometers , of various constructions , have been erected therein , and experiments are still in progress .
A Pressure-plate Anemometer , by Mr. Oxley , of Manchester , has been tested , but not with satisfactory results .
Report of the Ke Committee .
Experiments were made with a spare Barograph belonging to the Meteorological Committee , in order to ascertain the amount of optical distortion , if any , produced by the lenses .
Waxed paper for photographic purposes has been supplied to the Meteorological Office ( 3 reams ) , to the India Office ( 1 ream ) , and to the Radcliffe Observatory Q ream ) .
Instructions the use of magnetical or meteorological instruments has been given to the following gentlemen:\#151 ; Dr. E. van Rijckevorsel in magnetical work .
Nav .
Lieut. Dixon , R.N. , H.M.S. ' Nassau , ' in magnetical work .
Staff Comr .
Creak , R.N. , made observations with a Fox 's Circle for H.M.S. ' Challenger , ' and with a Fox 's Circle for H.M.S. ' Nassau .
' Capt. Evans , C.B. , F.R.S. , made some observations with a magnetometer constructed after his own design .
Photographs of the portable magnetic instruments , of the most approved patterns , have been taken for the use of persons seeking information .
In the month of May a request was received from Col. J. T. Walker , F.R.S. , Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India , through the Chairman of the Committee , for provision to be made at the Observatory for vibrating pendulums .
In the year 1865 two pendulums lent by the Royal Society for use in India had been vibrated at Kew by the late Capt. Basevi ; and it was necessary that these pendulums should be vibrated again on their return , and that at the same time two pendulums obtained from the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg should also be vibrated .
The Committee at once complied with the request ; and at the expense of the Indian Government preparation was made for the experiments in the south hall on the basement story , by removing for a time the apparatus for testing sextants , and building up from the foundation-arches two solid isolated supports for the Russian clock and pendulum .
Capt. Heaviside , R.E. , the officer charged with the duty of making the pendulum experiments , arrived in England in July , and , finding all the arrangements satisfactory , at once commenced his experiments , which are still in progress .
Endeavours were made , in connexion with the arrangements just mentioned , to obtain an electrical time communication between Kew and the Royal Observatory at Greenwich ; but the proposal failed of success .
Instruments.\#151 ; The Kew Standard Barometer , Newman 34 , has been cleaned by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra .
In January a new Minimum Thermometer by Casella was obtained to replace the old instrument , which had been accidentally broken .
The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus , such as the Whitworth Lathe and Planing Machine , procured by Grants from either the GovernReport of the Kew Committee .
meant Grant Fund or the Donation Fund , have been kept in thorough order ; and many of them are in constant use at the Observatory .
A supply of filled thermometer-tubes , of various ranges , has been procured for ultimate graduation as required .
The Committee have , through their Hon. Secretary Mr. Scott , who was present at the Meteorological Congress at Vienna in the month of September , as one of the Delegates from this country , professed their readiness to graduate standard thermometers for any of the Continental observatories which may require them , on condition that the tubes supplied for graduation are sufficiently old .
Library.\#151 ; The usual Donations of English and Foreign Scientific Publications have been received , and a few standard works purchased .
Staff.\#151 ; The Staff employed at Kew is as follows:\#151 ; Mr. Samuel Jeffery , Superintendent ; G. M. Whipple , B.Sc. , First Assistant ; T. W. Baker , Second Assistant j A. J. Bigbv , J. E. Cullum , J. Foster , F. Figg , E. Constable .
Note.\#151 ; Mr. F. J. Page resigned his appointment in January , and B. Bensted was appointed as Junior Assistant .
This gentleman has also left , and his place has been filled by E. Constable .
In accordance with a precedent established by the Kew Committee of the British Association , by a Be solution passed in October 1867 , Mr. B. Loewy was employed to give instruction to the Assistants .
The present Committee , in March last , resolved to resume this practice , and Mr. G. M. Whipple was appointed to give a course of instruction in Mathematics ; and he commenced his Lectures in April .
Mr. Bobert H. Scott , F.B.S. , continues to act as Honorary Secretary to the Committee .
