( Abstract .
) The objects contemplated in this paper are the following:1 .
The reduction to a symmetrical form of the well-known theorem by Clairaut for the integration of differential equations in a single independent variable , and the simultaneous determination of the singular solutions , if such exist ; the generalisation of the transformed types , and the application of the result to the integration of a large variety of partial differential equations in any number of independent variables , and the simultaneous determination of their singular solutions , where such exist .
2 .
The examination of the general theory commonly attributed to Laplace .
3 .
The indication of certain desiderata .
