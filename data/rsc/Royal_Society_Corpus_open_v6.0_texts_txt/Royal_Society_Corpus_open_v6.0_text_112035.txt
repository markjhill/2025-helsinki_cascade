In applying , the calculus of symbols to partial differential equations , we find an extenisive class with coefficients involving the inldependent variables which may in fact , like differential equations with constant coefficients , be solved by the rules which apply to ordinary algebraical equations ; for there are certain functions of the symbols of partial differentiation which combirie with certain functions of the independent variables according to the laws of combination of common algebraical quantities .
In the first part of this memoir I have investigated the nature of these symbols , and applied them to the solution of partial differential equations .
In the second part I have applied the calculus of symbols to the solution of functional equations .
For this purpose I have worked out some cases of symbolical division on a modified type , so that the symbols may embrace a greater range .
I have then shown how certain functional equations may be expressed in a symbolical form , and have solved them by methods analogous to those already explained .
