By Professor CAYLEY , F.R.S. Received November 12 , 1868 , -Read January 14 , 1869 .
THE present Memoir contains some extensions of Dr. SALMON'S theory of Reciprocal Surfaces .
I wish to put the formulae on record , in order to be able to refer to them in a " Memoir on Cubic Surfaces , but without at present attempting to completely develope the theory .

The notation made use of is that of SALiMON'S ' Geometry , ' pp. 450-459 , with the additions presently referred to ; the significations of all the symbols are explained by way of recapitulation at the end of the Memoir .
I remark that my chief addition to SALMON'S theory consists in a modification of his fundamental formule ( A ) and ( B ) ; these in their original form are ac(n-2)= z+ '+21J ( n2)+2t0+3 3+3t , c(^-2)=2ar+4 , Q+ r , a(n-2)(n-3)=2 &gt; +3[ac]+2[ab ] , b(n-2)(n-3)= 4k+ [ ab ] + 3[bc ] , c(n-2)(n-3)=6h+ [ c ] +2[bc ] , where [ ab ] =ab-2g , [ ac ] =ac3o , [ bc]=bc3-32y--i .

1 take account of conical and biplanar nodes , or , as I call them , cnicnodes , and binodes ; of pinch-points on the nodal curve ; and of close-points and off-points on the cuspidal curve : viz. I assume that there are C , cnicnodes , B , binodes , j , pinch-points , X , close points , 0 , off-points , X This addition to the theory is in fact indicated in SALMON , see the note , p. 445 ; the i there employed , which is of course different from the i of his text , is the j of the present Memoir .

2 F deferring for the present the explanation of these singularities .
The same letters , accented , refer to the reciprocal singularities .
Or using " trope " as the reciprocal term to node , these will be C ' , cnictropes , B ' , bitropes , j ' , pinch-planes , ' , close-planes , f , off-planes ; but these present themselves , not in the equations above referred to , but in the reciprocal equations .
3 .
The resulting alterations are that we must in the formulae write x-B , 3-C in place of z , respectively ; and change the formule for c(g--2 ) , [ ab , ] [ bc ] , into c(n--2)--2o+ 413+y+O , [ ab]=ab6-2g -j , [ ac]=ac-3o-X respectively .
4 .
Making these changes , and substituting for [ ab ] , [ ct ] , [ be ] their values , the formulae become a(n-2)= zBf +2- , b(n-2)= g +23+3y+3t , c(n-2)=2a-+43+ y+ 8 , a(n-2)(n-3)=2(c ) + 3(ac-3~ )+-2(ab-2 - ) , b(2)(i 3)= 4k+ ( ab-2 j~)+3(be3-2y- ) , c(n-2)(n-3)= 6h + ( ac-3---%z)+2(b -33-2y-i ) , which replace the original formulae ( A ) and ( B ) .
5 .
For convenience I annex the remaining equations ; viz. these are a ' n(n-1)-2bc , z'= 3n(n-2)-6b-8c , -'=_n(n -2)(A2--9)-(n-n -6)(2b+3c)+2b(b-1)+6+c+ 9 c(c-1 ) ; the equations q=b2-b-2k-3y-Gt , r=c-c-2h3P , ( q , r in place of SALMON'S R , S respectively ) ; the equation a=d ; and the corresponding equations , interchanging the accented and unaccented letters , in 202 all 23 equations between the 42 quantities n , a , ,x ; b , k , c , t , , , j ; c , h , r , , , X ; 3 , , y , ' ; B , C , n , a ' , ' , ' ; b ' , t ' , , ' , ' , ; c , 1J , r ' , ' , Y , X ' ; y'y , i ; B ' , C'..Developments .

-C ) -8k--18h--6(bc-33-27y-i ) ; .
and substituting these values of , iz in the formula n'=a(a--1)2--3z , and for a its value , =-n(n--1)-2b3c , we find n'=n(n1)2'-n(7 +12c)+ 4b2+8b+ 9ct 15c 8k-18h +-18+3 +127+12i-9t -2C3B--30 , where the foregoing equations for a-b c and a-2b-3c show clearly the origin of the new terms -2C-3B 38 ; these express that there is in the value of n ' a reduction =2 for each cnicnode , =3 for each binode , and =3 for each off-point .
7 .
We have ( n-2)(n-3)=n2-n+(-4n+6 ) -a+2b6+3c+(-4n+6 ) ; and making this substitution in the equations which contain ( n2)(n3 ) , these become a(-4n+6)=2(--C)--4 --9-2j--3X , b(--4n+6)4-2b2_-93--6y3i+2g -j , c(-4n+6)= 6h-3c2-63-4y-2i--3a(SALMON'S equations ( C ) ) ; and adding to each equation 4 times the corresponding equation with the factor ( n-2 ) , these become 2--2a=2(--C)+ 4(z-B)-2j3X , 2b2 -2b 4k(3+6y7+12t-3i+ 2--j , 32-2c 6h +103 + 402i+ 5- .
Writing in the first of these a22a=a(a-l)-a , =n ' +2 ; +3z--6a , and reducing the other two by means of the values of q , r , the equations become n'a=-2C-4B +z-a2j-3X , 2q+t+ 3i+j=2 , g 3r+c+ 2i+ , =5a+3+ 4d0 , ( SALMON'S equations ( D ) ) .
attend in particular to the first of these , or rather to the reciprocal equation , which will be '=a-n+z'-2j3z'-2C4B ' , which , writing therein a=-(n--1)23c , and z= 3n(n-2)-6b-8-c , becomes '=-4n(--2)8b11c2j3'-2 2C'-4BI .
The singularity a ' is not explicitly defined in SALMON ; a ' is the reciprocal of O , and ( as such ) it denotes the number of common tangent planes of the spinode torse and of the torse generated by the tangent planes along a plane section of the surface ; or , what is the same thing , it is the number of the spinode planes which touch the plane section ; that is , it is equal to the number of points of intersection of the spinode curve and the plane section ; or , finally , ' is the order of the spinode curve .
The spinode curve is in fact for a surface of the order n without singularities the intersection of the surface by the Hessian surface of the order 4(n--2 ) , and is thus a curve of the order 4n(n-2 ) , which agrees with the formula .
8 .
But the formula shows that there is in the order a reduction 86b+ll arising from the nodal and cuspidal curves of the surface , or , what is the same thing , that the Hessian surface meets the surface in the nodal curve taken 8 times , and in the cuspidal curve taken 11 times-a result which I had arrived at by other means , and also as appears post , No. 44 .
The formula shows further that there is a reduction 2j'+3-'+2C'+4B ' , or say there are reductions =2 , 3 , 2 , 4 , for the reciprocals of a pinch-point , a close-point , a cnicnode , and a binode respectively .
Geometrically this must signify that the surface and its Hessian partially intersect in certain curves which are not regarded as belonging to the spinode curve .
It will at once suggest itself that for the reciprocal of a cnicnode this curve is a conic , and for the reciprocal of a binode it is a line counting 4 times ; while for the reciprocal of a pinch-point it is a line counting 2 times , and for the reciprocal of a close-point , a line counting 3 times .

It is clear that g ' will in like manner denote the order of the node-couple curve .

I remark that if there be on a surface a right line which is such that the tangent plane is different at different points of the line , the line is said to be scrolar : the section of the surface by any plane through the line contains the line once .
But if there is at each point of the line one and the same tangent plane , then the section of the surface by the tangent plane contains the line at least twice ; if it contain it twice only , the line is torsal ; if three times the line is oscular ; and the tangent plane containing the torsal or oscular line may in like manner be termed a torsal or an ' oscular tangent plane .
These epithets , scrolar , torsal and oscular , will be convenient in the sequel .

Explanation of the New Singularities .
Article Nos. 13 to 39 .
I proceed to the explanation of the new singularities .
13 .
The cnicnode , or singularity C=1 , is an ordinary conical point ; instead of the tangent plane we have a proper quadricone .
14 .
The cnictrope , or reciprocal singularity C'=1 , is also a well known one ; it is in fact the conic of plane contact , or say rather the plane of conic contact , viz. the cnictrope is a plane touching a surface , not at a single point , but along a conic .
15 .
Consider a surface having the cnienode C=l , and the reciprocal surface having the cnictrope C'=1 .
There are on the quadricone of the cnicnode six directions of closest contact , and reciprocal thereto we have six tangents of the cnictrope conic , touching it at six points .
The plane of the cnictrope meets the surface in the conic twice , and in a residual curve which touches the conic at each of the six points .
It would appear that these six contacts are part of the notion of the cnictrope .
16 .
We may of course have a surface with a conic of plane contact , but such that the residual curve of intersection in the plane of the conic does not touch the conic six times or at all ; for instance the general equation of a surface with a conic of plane contact is PM+-V2N=O , where P=0 is a plane , V-=0 a quadric surface ; and here the conic P=0- , V=O does not touch the residual curve P=0 , N=0 .
The reciprocal surface will in this case have a cnicnode , but there is some special circumstance doing away with the six directions of closest contact which in general belong thereto .
I do not further pursue this inquiry .
17 .
For a surface having the cnictrope C'=1 , the Hessian surface passes through the conic , which is thus thrown off from the spinode curve ; or there is a reduction =2 in the order of the curve , which agrees with a foregoing result .
18 .
The binode , or singularity B=1 , is a biplanar node , where instead of the proper quadricone we have two planes ; these may be called the biplanes , and their line of intersection , the edge of the binode .
The biplanes form a plane-pair .
19 .
The bitrope , or reciprocal singularity B ' -l , is the plane of point-pair contact ; but this needs explanation .
20 .
Consider a surface having a binode , and the reciprocal surface having a bitrope .
We have the bitrope , a plane the reciprocal of the binode ; in this plane a line , the reciprocal of the edge ; in the line two points , or say a point-pair , the reciprocal of the biplanes : these points may be called the bipoints .
There are in each biplane three directions of closest contact ; the reciprocals of these are in the bitrope three directions through each of the two points .
The section of the reciprocal surface by the bitrope is made up of the line counting three times ( or the line is oscular ) , and of a curve passing in the three directions ( having therefore a triple point ) through each of the two bipoints .
The bitrope contains thus an oscular line ; but it is part of the notion that Q ' Taking for greater simplicity coordinates xy , z , 1 , then for a surface having a cnicnode at the origin , the equation is 1U12+U3+ &amp;c. =0 , the suffixes showing the degree in the coordinates ; the equation of the quadricone is U2=O , and the six directions are given as the lines of intersection of the two cones U2=0 , U'3=0 .
206 there are on this line two points each a triple : point on the residual curve of intersection .
21 .
We may however have on a surface an oscular line without upon it two or any triple points of the residual curve of intersection .
Such a surface is Mx+Ny3=0 ; the intersections of the line x=0 , y=-O with the curve x=0 , N=0 will be all of them ordinary points .
The reciprocal surface will have a binode , but there will be some special circumstance doing away with the existence of the directions of closest contact in the two biplanes respectively .
I do not at present pursue the question .
22 .
For a surface having a bitrope B'-1 , it appears from what precedes , that the oscular line must count 4 times in the intersection of the surface with the Hessian ; for only in this way can the reduction 4 in the order of the spinode curve arise .
23 .
The pinch-point , or singularityj=l , is in fact mentioned in SALMON ; it is a point on the nodal curve such that the two tangent planes coincide , or say it is a cuspidal point on the nodal curve .
If , to fix the ideas , we take the nodal curve to be a complete intersection P=0 , Q=0 , then the equation of the surface is ( A , B , C3(P , Q)2=0 ( A , B , C functions of the coordinates ) ; we have a surface AC-B2-0 , which may be called the critic surface , intersecting the nodal curve in the points P=0 , Q=0 , AC-B2=0 , which are the pinch-points thereof ; or if there be a cuspidal curve , then such of these points as are not situate on the cuspidal curve are the pinch-points : see my paper .
" On a Singularity of Surfaces , " Quart .
Math. Journ. vol. ix .
( 1868 ) pp. 332-338 .
The single tangent plane at the pinch-point meets the surface ( see p. 338 ) in a curve having at the pinch-point a triple point , cusp+2 nodes , viz. there is a cuspidal branch the tangent to which coincides with that of the nodal curve ; and there is a simple branch the tangent to which may be called the cotangent at the pinch-point .
In the particular case where the nodal curve is a right line the section is the line twice ( representing the cuspidal branch ) , and a residual curve of the order n-2 , the tangent to which is the cotangent .
24 .
The pinch-plane , or reciprocal singularityj 1 , is in fact a torsal plane touching the surface along a line , or meeting it in the line twice and in a residual curve .
Let the line and curve meet in a point P ; for the reason that the section by the plane is the line twice and the residual curve , the section has at P two coincident nodes ; that is , the plane is a node-couple plane with two coincident nodes .
The plane meets the consecutive node-couple plane in a line / passing through P and touching at this point the residual curve .
Considering now the reciprocal figure , the reciprocal of the pinch-plane is thus a point of the nodal curve , and is a pinch-point ; the tangent plane at the pinchpoint is the reciprocal of the point P ; the tangent to the nodal curve is the reciprocal of the line p , that is , of the tangent at P to the residual curve ; and the cotangent at the pinch-point is the reciprocal of the torsal line .
25 .
There is in this theory the difficulty that for a surface of the order n , the torsal plane meets the residual curve of intersection in ( n-2 ) points P , and if each of these be a point on the node-couple curve , then in the reciprocal figure the pinch-point would be 207 a multiple point on the nodal curve .
I apprehend that starting with a pinch-point , a simple point on the nodal curve , we have in the reciprocal figure a pinch-plane or torsal plane as above , but with some speciality in virtue of which only one of the ( n--2 ) points of intersection of the torsal line with the residual plane curve is a point of the nodecouple curve of the reciprocal surface .
In the case of a pinch-plane or torsal plane of a cubic surface , n-2 is =1 , and the question of multiplicity does not arise .
26 .
: For a surface with a pinch-plane or torsal plane as above ( j'=1 ) , the Hessian surface not only passes through the torsal line , but it touches the surface along this line , causing , as already mentioned , a reduction =_2 in the order of the spinode curve .
That the surfaces totuch along the line is an important theorem* , and I annex a proof .
27 .
Let x=0O , y=O be the torsal line , x=0 being the torsal plane ; the equation of the surface therefore is xp +yl2 O= 0 ; and if A , B , C , D be the first derived functions of ( a , , c , d , 4 , g , h , 1 , , n , n ) the second derived functions , and if ( A ' , B ' , C ' , D ' ) , ( al , b ' , c ' d'f ' , g ' , h ' , 1 ' , in ' , n ' ) refer in like manner to 4 , then the equation of the Hessian is 0= 2A+sxa+ya , B +.xh +2yAl'+y2f ' , C +xg +y2g ' , D +xl +-y21f B +x h+ 2yyA , x6 +2+ 4yB ' +y26 ' , f+ 2yC'+y2f ' , xm + 2yD'+ym2 !
C+xg+yfg ' , xf+2yC'+yf ' , xc+y2c ' , xn+y2n ' D+xl+y2 , 2xm+yfn ' +2yD ' , xn+yzn ' , xd +yd ' ; and representing this for a moment by A , H , G , L -0 , H , B , F , MG F , C , N L , M , N , D then in the developed equation D(ABCAF2BG2CH2+ 2FGH ) -(BC-F2 , CA-G2 , AB--H2 , GH-AF , HF-BG , FG-CH-L , M , N)2-=O observing that C , F , M , N , D are of the first order in x , y , the only terms of the first order are contained in B(--DG2--CL2+2NGL ) ; and since C , D , N are of the first order , we obtain all the terms of the first order by reducing B , G , L to the values 2 ?
4 , C , D ; viz. the terms of the first order are 24(C2dxD2cx+2CDnx ) , =-2 ( C2d+D2c-2CD)z ) .
Hence the complete equation is of the form -2 ( C2d+D2tc-2CDn)xL+(xs y)2i0 , or , what is the same thing , xI-+y2r=0 ; the Hessian has therefore along the line x=0O , y=0 the same tangent plane x=0 as the surface ; or it touches the surface along this line ; that is , the line counts twice in the intersection of the two surfaces .
28 .
If instead of the right line we have a plane curve , say if the equation be xp + P2 = 0 , then the value of the Hessian is x(4 + Pi =0 ( viz. the second term divides by P only , not by P2 ) , " so that , as before mentioned in regard to a conic of contact , the surface and the Hessian merely cut but do not touch along the curve x=0 , P=0 .
To show this in the most simple manner take the equation to be + -P2 = 0 ; let A ' , B ' , C ' , D ' be the first derived functions of p , and ( A , B , C , D ) , ( a , b , c , d , J ; gI h , 1 , rn , i ) the first and second derived functions of P ; then if in the equation of the HIessian we write for greater simplicity x-0 , the equation is 2A'+Pa+A2 , B'+Ph +AB , C'+Pg+AC , D+-Pl +AD -0 .
B'+Ph+AB , Pb +B2 , Pf +BC , Pm+BD C ' +Pg+AC , Pf +BC , Pc+C2 , Pn +CD D'-+ PI +AD , Pm+BD , Pn+ CD , Pd + ID2 The equation contains for example the term -(D ' + P+ AD)2 { P2(bc -/ 2 ) + P(C2+ cB22fBC ) } , dividing as it should do by P , but not dividing by P2 ; and considering the portion hereof -D'2P(bC2 +c B2--2fBC ) , there are no other terms in D'2P which can destroy this , and to make the whole equation divide by P2 ; which proves the required negative .
29 .
For the off-point or singularity 0=1 ; this is a point on the cuspidal curve at which the second derived functions all of them vanish .
In further explanation hereof consider a surface U=0 , and the second polar of an arbitrary point ( ca , y , ) ; viz. this is ( o3t+-3fy+3^+3+r-f )2U=0 , or say for shortness A2U=0 , where the coefficients of the powers and products of ( cs , P , y , 3 ) are of course the second derived functions of U ; this equation , when reduced by means of the equations of the cuspidal curve , may acquire a factor A , thus assuming the form A(cP+-3Q+ yR+ -S)2= 0 , and if so the intersections of the cuspidal curve with the second polar ( =2+f0 , if , as for simplicity is supposed , there is no nodal curve ) will be made up of the intersections of the cuspidal curve with the surface A=0 , and of those with the surface czP+PQ+yR+8S=0 each twice ; the latter of these , depending on the coordinates ( cc , / 3 , y , 6 ) of the arbitrary points , are the points f each twice ; the former of them , or intersections of the cuspidal curve with the surface A-=0 , are the points 0 , or off-points of the cuspidal curve .
If there is a nodal curve,.the only difference is that the off-points are such of the above points as do not lie on the nodal curve .
30 .
As the most simple instance of the manner in which this singularity may present itself , consider a surface FP+ GQ'-=0 , where the degrees of the functions are f , p , g , _ , andtherefore n=+f 2p=g +3q , if n be the order of the surface .
This has a cuspidal curve P==0 , Q= 0 of the order ; q ; the equation A2(FPt GQ)= 0 of the second polar , when reduced by the equations P -0 , Q= 0 of the cuspidal curve , becomes simply F(AP)2=0 ; and we have thus the off-points F=0 , P=0 , Q=0 , consequently ==fjgq .
31 .
But suppose , as before , the case of a surface ( A , B , C)3P , Q)2=O having a cuspidal curve P=-0 , Q=0 , and therefore AC-B2 being =0 for P=0 , Q=0 .
The equation of the second polar , writing therein P=0 , Q=0 , becomes ( A , B , C3(AP , AQ)2=0 , and if for any given surface this assumes the form A(MAP+NAQ)2-=0 ( observe that M , N may be fractional provided only the MAP+NAQ is integral ) , then there will be on the cuspidal curve the off-points A=0 , P=0 , Q==0 .
32 .
An interesting example is afforded by a surface which presents itself in the Memoir on Cubic Surfaces : the surface 4y6 4y3x(Xa+ 3zw ) + zw(3x2+zw)2=0 has the cuspidal conic y=O , 3x2+-zw=O , and ( as coming under the form FP2+ GQ3=0 ) has the off-points zw==O , y=0 , 3x2+zw-=0 ; that is , the points ( x=0 , y=O , z==0 ) , ( x=O , y=0 , w=0 ) each twice ; =04 .
But writing the same equation in the form ( 4 , 6x , 8x2+zw)f3--2x3 , X2-zw)2=0 , where 4.(82 + zw ) -(6x)2 4(x w ) , it appears that there are also the three cuspidal conics y2x = 0 , x2 -zw 0 .
Reducing by means of these two equations , the equation of the second polar is at first obtained in the form ( 4 , 6x , 8x+zwX3yfAy-6x2Ax , 2xAx--ZAW--Az)2= 0 ; but further reducing by the same equations and writing for this purpose y=-x(w3=2 ) , the equation becomes ( 4 , 6x , 9x2X2(32Ay-6Ax ) , 2xAx-zAwwA2)2=0 , that is 2[2x(3w2Ay6A ) 3(2Ax zAw-wAZ)]2=0 , and we have thus the off-points x2-=0 , y3-2x3=0 , x2_zw=0 , in fact the before-mentioned two points each 6 times ; and the complete value of 0 is --(4 +12 =)16 ; viz. the off-points are the points ( =0 , y=0 , z==0 ) , ( ==0 , y=0 , w=-0 ) each 8 times .
On account of this union of points the singularity is really one of a higher order , but equivalent to =16 .
I am not at present able to explain the off-plane or reciprocal singularity 0'=1 .
33 .
As to the close-point or singularity X=1 .
I remark that at an ordinary point of the cuspidal curve the section by the tangent plane touches , at the point of contact , the cuspidal curve : the point of contact is on the curve of section a singular point [ in the nature of a triple point , viz. taking the point of contact as origin , the form of the branch in the vicinity thereof is y34--0 , where y=0 is the equation of the tangent to the 210 cuspidal curve ] , such that the point of contact counts 4 times in the intersection of the cuspidal curve with the curve of section .
At a close-point the form of the curve of section is altered ; viz. the point of contact is here in the nature of a quadruple point with two distinct branches , one of them a triple branch of the form y3 x4 , but such that the tangent thereof , y= 0 , is not the tangent of the cuspidal curve ; the other of them a simple branch , the tangent of which is also distinct from the tangent of the cuspidal branch : the point of contact counts 3+1 times , that is 4 times , as before , in the intersection of the cuspidal curve and the curve of section .
The tangent to the simple branch may conveniently be termed the cotangent at the close-point ; that of the other branch the cotriple tangent .
34 .
We may look at the question differently thus : to fix the ideas , let the cuspidal curve be a complete intersection P-=O , Q-0O ; the equation of the surface is ( A , B , C)3P , Q)2=0 , where AC-B'=0 , in virtue of the equations P=0 , Q=0 of the cuspidal curve , that is , AC--B2 is --MP+NQ suppose .
We have ( as in the investigation regarding the pinch-point ) a critic surface AC-B2= 0 , this meets the surface in the cuspidal curve and in a residual curve of intersection ; the residual curve by its intersection with the cuspidal curve determines the close-points ; the tangent at the close-point is I believe the tangent of the residual curve .
Analytically the close-points are given by the equations P-0 , Q=0 , ( A , B , C:)N , -M)2=0 .
It is proper to remark that if besides the cuspidal curve there be a nodal curve , only such of the points so determined as do not lie on the nodal curve are the close-points .
35 .
I take as an example a surface which is substantially the same as one which presents itself in the Memoir on Cubic Curves , viz. the surface ( 1 , w , xy _w2_-xy , z)2=0 , having the cuspidal conic w2--xy=O , =0 .
Since in the present case AC-B2-P , we have M=-1 , N=0 , and the close-points are given by P=0 , Q=O , C=0 ; that is , they are the points ( z=O0 , w=O0 , 0=O ) and ( z-0 , w=-0 , y-0 ) .
36 .
I first however consider an ordinary point on the cuspidal curve , or conic w2-xy:0O , zz=O ; the coordinates of any point on the conic are given by x:y:z:w=l:2 : 0 : 0 where , is an arbitrary parameter ; we at once find 02xSy-d(z+2w)= 0 for the equation of the tangent plane of the surface or cuspidal tangent plane at the point ( 1 , 02 , 0 , O ) .
Proceeding to find the intersection of this plane with the surface , the elimination of z gives ( 2 , Ow , xyw 2xy , 02x+y , --20w)=0 , which is of course the cone , vertex ( x-=0 , y= 0 , w=-0 ) , which passes through the required curve of intersection .
In place of the coordinates x , y take the new coordinates 2x--y=2p , and 02x+y--2Qw=-2q ; we have 2-= Ow +y--q , y=--ow+2--p , and thence 2xy p2 ( q + Ow)2 =2 q 2Oqw W , ?
wY=^2-(g+ @W)2 p2-22-20gw-62w2 " ( w"xy ) 2 q2 20gw , 22 211 and the equation thus is ( O4 , 3w , -p22 + 20w + v2W2(p2 : -20gw , 22g)-=0 , or , what is the same thing , ( 1 , Ow , -p2+g2+20qw+62w2)p2-20gw , 2q)2=0 ; viz. this is ( p2_ 92_2 w)2+4Oqw(p2-2_ 20W)+4g2(-jp2+q2+ 20w+ 02w2 ) =0 ; or reducing , it is ( p2_2)(p2-_ 5g2)+ 803w=-0 , the equation of the section in terms of the coordinates p , q , w. The equation is satisfied by the values p=-0 , =0 which belong to the assumed point ( 1 , a2 , 0 , 0 ) of the conic , and in the vicinity of this point we have p4 + 803w =0 , which is a triple branch of the form y3=x4 , the tangent =O-0 being , it will be observed , the tangent of the conic .
But at the close-points , or when 0-=0 or =o , the transformation fails ; and these points must be considered separately .
37 .
At the first of these , viz. the point z-=0 , w=0 , x-0 , the tangent plane of the surface or cuspidal taingent plane is x0 and this meets the surface in the curve x= 0 , w3(w+-2z)=-0 , that is in the line x=0 , w=0 three times , and in the line x==O , w+ 2z-O ( that the section consists of right lines is of course a speciality , and it is clear that considering in a more general surface the section as defined by an equation in ( w , z , y ) , the line w-0 represents the tangent to a triple branch w3==Z4+ &amp;c. , and the line w+2z-=0 the tangent to a simple branch ) ; these lines are each of them , it will be observed , distinct from the tangent to the cuspidal conic , which is x=O0 , z=O .
And similarly the tangent plane at the other of the two points is y=0 , meeting the surface in the curve y=0 , w3(w+2z)-0 , that is in the line 0y=O , w=0 three times , and in the line y=O , w+2-=0 .
38 .
The close-plane or reciprocal singularity '-=1 is ( like the pinch-plane ) a torsal plane , meeting the surface in a line twice and in a residual curve ; the distinction is that the line and curve have an intersection P lying on the spinode curve ; the close-plane is thus a spinode plane ; it meets the consecutive spinode plane in a line , passing through P , and which is not the tangent of the residual curve .
In the reciprocal figure , the reciprocal of the close-plane is on the cuspidal curve , and is a close-point ; the reciprocal of the point P is the cuspidal tangent plane ; that of the line u , the tangent of the cuspidal curve ; that of the tangent of the residual curve the cotriple tangent : that of the torsal line the cotangent .
39 .
The tOrsal line of a close-plane is not a mere torsal line ; in fact by what precedes it appears that the surface and the Hessian intersect in this line , counting not twice but three times , and it is thus that the reduction in the order of the spinode curve caused by the close-plane is ==3 .

Consider the surface FP2+ GR2Q3= 0 , where f , p , g , r , q being the degrees of the several functions , and n the order of the surface , we have of course nf=f+2p =yg+ 2r + 3q .
There is here a nodal curve , the complete intersection of the two surfaces P -0 , R0 ; hence b =pr , k=-pr(p-l)(r-1 ) , =b(b-p-r+ 1 ) ; t=0 ; whence ( q)=pr(p+r2 ) .
There is also a cuspidal curve the complete intersection of the two surfaces P= 0 , Q-= 0 ; hence c=pq , h=p-(p"1)(q-1)= , c(c-p-2 , -q+1 ) ; whence ( r)*=p(q(p+q-2 ) .
The two curves intersect in the pgr points P=0 , Q-=0 , R =0 , which are not stationary points on either curve ; that is , 3=0 , y=0 , i=pqr .
There are on the nodal curve the j=(f+g)pr pinch-points F-0 , P-0 , R=0 , and G=0 , P_=0 , R=0 .
There are on the cuspidal curve =jq off-points F=O , P=0 O , Q=0 ; and there the gpq singular points G:-0 , P=O , Q=O .
I find that these last , and also the d points each three times , must be considered as close-points , that is , that we have --(y+ 3f)pq .
41 .
We ought then to have 6(n-2 ) =p , c(n-2 ) =2a-+d ; 2(q)+ 3i+j =26 , 3(r)+c +2i+-z=56 +40 ; the first two of which give g , a , and then , substituting their values , the other two equations should become identities .
In fact , attending to the values 2pr= b , pqc , the equations become 2(p +r-2)+ 36+b(f+g)=22b(2 ) , 3c(p+q-2)+c+2cr+b(g+3f)={(-2 ) cf } +4cf .
The first of these is 2n=2p + 2r+3q+f+g , =(2p +f)+(2r+ 3q+g ) , and the second is n=3p+ 3q+2r+g+-f ; = ( 2p + )+(2r+3q+g ) , so that the equations are satisfied .
The Flecnodal Curve .
Article No. 42 .
42 .
A point on a surface may be flecnodal , viz. the tangent plane may meet the surface in a curve having at the point a flecnode , that is , a node with an inflexion on one of the branches .
SALMON has shown that , for a surface of the order n without singularities , the locus of the flecnodal points , or flecnodal curve , is the complete intersection of the surface by a surface of the order lln-24 , which may be called the flecnodal surface , the order of the curve being thus =n((lln-24 ) .
I have succeeded in showing , in a somewhat peculiar way by consideration of a surface of revolution , that if the surface of the order n has a nodal curve of the order b , and a cuspidal curve of the order c , then that the order of the flecnodal curve is =n(lln24)22b-27e ; before giving this investigation , I will by the like principles demonstrate the above-mentioned theorem that the order of the spinode curve is 4n(n--2)-8b-llc .
Ssurfaces of Revolzution , in connexion with the Spinode Curve and the Flecnodal Cturve .

Consider a plane curve of the order m with 8 nodes and z cusps , and let this be made to revolve about an axis in its own plane , so as to generate a surface of revolution .
The complete meridian section is made up of the given curve and of an equal curve situate symmetrically therewith on the other side of the axis ; the order of the surface is thus =22m .
The two curves intersect in m points on the axis and in m--m points , forming -}(m2-- ) pairs of points , situate symmetrically on opposite sides of the axes ; these last generate -(nm2-m ) circles , nodal curves on the surface ; the nodes generate 6 circles , which are nodal curves on the surface , and the cusps generate X circles , cuspidal curves on the surface .
There are m2-m--2-3-3z circles of plane contact corresponding in the plane curve to the tangents perpendicular to the axis .
Each of the qm points on the axis gives in the surface a pair of ( imaginary ) lines ; and we have thus two sets each of m lines , such that along the lines of each set the surface is touched by an ( imaginary ) meridian plane ; viz. these are the circular planes x+iy= 0 , --iy= 0 passing through the axis .
I assume without stopping to show it that these 2m lines are lines notj ' but X ' , that is , that they each reduce the order of the spinode curve by 3* .
The inflexions generate 3m2-6nm6--8 circles which constitute the spinode curve on the surface .
44 .
And we can thus verify that the complete intersection of the surface with the Hessian is made up in accordance with the foregoing theory ; viz. Order of surface =-2m , Order of Hessian ==4(2m-2 ) , whence order of intersection =16nmz2-16m Nodal curve , L(m2--m)+ circles , 8 times 8m2-8mn+168 Cuspidal curve , z circles , 11 times +22z Circles of contact m--m-2--3z , 2mn-2m4-6z Lines 2m , 3 times + 6m Spinode curve , 3m2--6m6-88z circles , 6m2-_12m--12-16z 16m2-16m 45 .
We may by a similar reasoning show that the surface and the flecnode surface intersect in the nodal curve taken 22 times , and in the cuspidal curve taken 27 times ; and consequently that the order of the residual intersection or flecnodal curve is =n(lln24)22b-27c .
To effect this , observe that at any point whatever of a quadric surface the tangent plane meets the surface in a pair of lines , that is , in a curve having at the point of contact a node with an inflexion on each branch , or say , a fieflecnode .
Imagine in the plane figure a conic having its centre on the axis of rotation and its axis coincident therewith , and the conic having with the curve of the order ma 4-pointic intersection at any point P ; the point P generates a circle , such that along this circle the surface is osculated by a quadric surface of revolution in such wise that the meridian sections have a four-pointic contact ; the circle in question is thus on the surface a flefleenode circle ; and I assume that it counts twice as a flecnode circle .
Hence if the number of the points P be =0 , we have on the surface 0 fleflecnode circles , =20 flecnode circles , that is , a flecnode curve of the order 40 .
I wish to show that we have 0=5m2-99m--10 1--12x .
46 .
The problem is as follows : given a curve of the order m with nodes and z cusps ; it is required to find the number of the conics , centre on a given line , and an axis coincident in direction with this line , which have with the given curve a 4-pointic intersection , or contact of the third order .
This may be solved by means of formule contained in my " Memoir on the Curves which satisfy given Conditions"* .
Taking x=0 for the given line , the conic ( a , b , c , f , g , h(x , y , 1)2=0 will have its centre on the given line and an axis coincident therewith , if only h=0 , g=0 ; and denoting these two conditions by 2X , it is easy to see that we have ( 2X.'.)=1 , ( 2X:/ )=2 , ( 2X./ /)=2 , ( 2X/ // )=1 .
But in general if the conic satisfy any other three conditions 3Z , then the number of the conics ( 2X , 3Z ) is =( -47+ 2 ) + ( -8+ 16+ 16 ) +Y'( 1M ) , where a , 3 , y , 3 denote ( 2X. .
) , ( 2X:/ ) , ( 2X / / ) , ( 2X/ // ) , viz. in the present case the values are 1 , 2 , 2 , 1 respectively , and where c ' , / 3 ' , y denote ( 3Z : ) , ( 3Z / ) , ( 3Z/ / ) respectively .
47 .
Substituting for a , 3 , y , ?
their values , the number of the conics in question is =I !
, that is =(3Z / ) Suppose that 3Z , or say 3 , denotes the condition of a contact of the third order with a given curve ( mn , , ) , or say with a given curve ( mn n , ) , ) ( m the order , n the class =m2--2--3z , a=3n+x ) , then we have ( 3 : )=-4m-3n+3 &amp; , ( 3 .
/ ) =-8m 9-8n+6a , ( 3/ /)= 3i -4nS+3a ; and from the second of these the number of the conics in question is = 4m4n+ 3a , that is , it is =--4m+5n+ 3z , or finally it is =5n2-9--10lO-12x .

For a surface of the order n without singularities this equation is n'(11'24)-22b'-27c ' =n(1)(11n24 ) ; to explain the meaning of it , I say that the reciprocal of a flecnode is a flecnodal plane , and vice versa : the reciprocal of the flecnodal torse of the surface n ( viz. the torse generated by the flecnodal planes of the surface ) is thus the flecnodal curve of the reciprocal surface n ' ; and the class of the torse must therefore be equal to the order of the curve .
The fleenodal torse is generated by the tangents of the surface n along the curve of intersection with a surface of the order 11n-24 ; the number of tangent planes which pass through an arbitrary point , or class of the torse , is at once found to be n(n 1)(1ln-24 ) ; for the reciprocal surface the order of the flecnodal curve is by what precedes n'(11--24)-22b'-27c ' ; and the equation thus expresses that the order of the curve is equal to the class of the torse .
See last foot note : the same remark applies to the present terms in m , which cannot be got rid of by an alteration of the numbers 22 and 27 to which the investigation relates .

The value -'=2n(n-2)(11n-24 ) for a surface without singularities was obtained by SALMON by independent geometrical considerations , viz. he obtains 2P'=4n(n-2)(11n-24 ) as the number of intersections of the spinode curve ( order =4n(n2 ) ) by the flecnode surface of the order lln-24 .

The value of ( 3 ' must be obtainable in the case of a surface with singularities , and I have been led to conclude that we have -3'= 2n(n-2)(11--24 ) -(110n-272)b+44q -(116n-303)c+ 23r + 6'3 + 2487+198t + linear function ( i , j , 0 , X , C , B , i ' , I j , ' , C ' , CB ' ) , but I have not yet completely determined the coefficients of the linear function .

As regards the general theorem , we know ( SALMON , p. 274 ) that if two surfaces of the orders p , v partially intersect in a curve of the order m and class r , and besides in a curve of the order m ' , then the curves m , in ' meet in m(l +y 2)-r points .
Suppose that the curve m is a-tuple on the surface pi ; then to find the number I of the intersections of the curves n and in ' , we may imagine through ma surface of the order g ; the surfaces p , v intersect in the curve ma times , and in a residual curve of the order p--ma , this last meets the surface g in g(p--ma ) points , and thence the three surfaces meet in Ypv--ma-I points .
But since m is a simple curve on each of the surfaces Y , g , the three surfaces meet in p( , g-m)[m(Yv+g-2)-r ] points , whence equating the two values I=--m(-+v--2ca)-r .
Next , let the curve mr be a-tuple on the surface ^ , 3-tuple on the surface o. Considering the new surface g through mn , then { , v intersect in the curve In a3 times , and in a residual curve of the order pv--map ; this last meets the surface g in g(pv-minp ) points ; whence the three surfaces meet in g(pv-maf)-I points .
But the curve In being a F-tuple curve on y , and a simple curve on g , these meet in the curve n ( 3 times and in a residual curve of the order vg-p3m , whence the three surfaces meet in { vg( W-3mn)-c[m(y+f(gv 2-23)-f3r1 points ; and equating the two values , we have I=m(p , u+av-2cc ) -2ac3r .
Lastly , if the curve mn be y-tuple on g , then the surfaces ~ , e meet in may times and in a residual curve of the order pg--may ; this last meets v in v(p acym2 ) 3[im(y6 +c 2ay ) ayr ] points , that is , the number of points of intersection of the three surfaces is t-PI ?

For a cubic surface n=3 , and for a cubic surface without singular lines ( in fact for all the cases except the cubic scrolls XXII and XXIII ) , the formula is ' =54 hC gB -*j''x 'v ' ' h'C''B ; and applying this to the several cases of cubic surfaces as grouped together in the Table , and referred to by the affixed roman numbers , the resulting equations are 54=54 , ( I ) 30=54h , ( II ) 18=54g-16v ' , ( III ) 13=54 -2h-- ' , ( IV ) 6=54h-g--'--8 ' , ( VI ) 3=54-3h-3x ' , ( VIII ) 0=54-2g-16'-g ' , ( IX ) 1=542h--'2p ' , ( XIII ) 0=54-4h6x ' , ( XVI ) 0=54--2g--2 , ' , -g ' , ( XVII ) 0=54-3g3y ' , ( XXI ) which are all satisfied i.f only h =24 , g+l6 ' =36 , g+ 2b'=12 , g+ g'=18 , '= 7 .
61 .
If we apply to the same surfaces the reciprocal equation for j3 , or , what is the same 222 thing , apply the original equation to the reciprocal surfaces , as given by interchanging the upper and lower halves of the Table of Singularities , we have another series of equations , viz. this is 0 --54432-54432 , 0=27851-27846-h ' , 0=18180--18318-g'--16v , 0=11765-11756 -2h'-- , 0= 69176584h--g'--.---8y , 0= 35343522-3hJ'-3x , 0= 30243144-2g'-16--gy , 0= 14331386-2h'-g'--X-2p , 0= 518504-44h'-6x , 0= 383322h'--2y'-g-2p , 0= 54 -3g 3g , g'+16v=--138 , 2h ' +X -= 9 , h'+g'+--+ 8y=45 , 3h'+3 .
-12 , 2g'+16y+g= -120 , 2h'+ +- ' X+-22=47 , 4h ' +6 =14 , h'+ 2g'+gq 2j = 61 , 3g+ 3g ' =54 , ( I ) ( II ) ( III ) ( IV ) ( VI ) ( VIII ) ( IX ) ( XIII ) ( XVI ) ( XVII ) ( XXI ) all satisfied if only g'+16v= -138 , g'+2p 38 , g+g ' = 18 , x --1 .

I remark however that the cubic scroll XXII or XXIII gives 0=54-(330272)-2(x+x ' ) , that is , A+X'= -2 , instead of +-x'= -8 .
The investigation is in fact really inapplicable to a scroll , for every point of a scroll has the property of a fiecnode ; whence if U0 be the equation of the scroll , that of the flecnodal surface is M. U= 0 , containing U as a factor , and there is not any definite curve of intersection constituting the flecnodal curve ; but I am nevertheless surprised at the numerical contradiction .
63 .
Combining the two sets of results , we find h =24 , x == , X. =_-1 , h ' =15 , 223 5 g ' -18-g , ' =x ' , ' =--7 , ,'=64-9 1 and the formula thus is Y= 22n(-2)(11n-24 ) -(llOn-272)b+44q -(1162-303)c+A-2r + 6p-93 +248y+198t -24C+j-10 + 39 -5C'-18B'6X'9 --i--i ' + g(16B-8+16B--8-B'-8'- ' ) , where x , , g are constants which remain to be determined .
The cubic surfaces fail to determine them , for the reason that in all of them we have i=O , i'=0 ; and 1G6BS+ S+ =1B ' +S-8 ' + : this last is a very remarkable relation , for the existence of which I do not perceive any priori reason .
Substituting herein for g , r their values from No. 11 , this may be written in the form '=2n(n-2)(llln-24)+b(-66n+184)+c(-3-9--n+240 ) +1413+3-59y+66t --X ' i ' + 7j'k'-95C'-18B ' -(x +8 7)i --21 j --4-%+50 --24C + ( -1 i B-td ad 8+16B'a+ed l rs + ' ) .

We have of course by interchanging the unaccented and accented letters , the reciprocal equation giving the value of 3 .

It is hardly necessary to recall that a spinode plane is a tangent plane meeting the surface in a curve having at the point of contact a spinode or cusp ; the envelope of the spinode planes is the spinode torse , and the locus of their points of contact the spinode curve .
And similarly a node-couple plane is a double tangent plane , or plane meeting the surface in a curve having two nodes ; the envelope of the planes is the node-couple torse , and the locus of the points of contact the node-couple curve ; the other terms made use of are all explained in the present Memoir .
226 Addition , August 3 , 1869 .
As in the theory of Curves , so in that of Surfaces , there are certain functions of the order , class , &amp;c. and singularities which have the same values in the original and the reciprocal figures respectively ; for convenience I represent any such identity by means of the symbol 2 , viz. p(n , a , b , ... )= denotes that the function $(n , a , b , ... ) is equal to the same function &lt; p(n , a , b ' , ... ) of the accented letters .
By what precedes we have a=- ; and it is moreover clear that any function of the unaccented letters which is =0 , or which is equal to a symmetrical function of any of the accented and unaccented letters , or to a function of a , is =X ; for instance , from the equations of No. 5 we have 3d -= 3nc , and thence 3n-c-x=3a'--x-x ' , that is , 3n-c--z=2 ; and from one of the equations of No. 11 we have n-2C-4B+x---a--2j-3X=n+n't-a , =- ; we have thus the system of eight equations , a= 3n-c-X ~ , a(n-2)z+B2-27 == , b(n-2)g-2p-3y-3t =- , c(n-2)--2a-4Pty0 =- , n+ zca-2C-4B-2j-3X= : , 2g-2fq+ 3+3i +j = , 3r+ c-5/ 3-40 +2i+ X=- .
Or if from these we eliminate z , g , o , then the system of five equations , a =s n(c-8)-4I3-y+4C+8B+6X+4j = ( ab)(n2)ll n+ 3c+ 4C 9B +23 +3y+ 3t+ 6+ 6 4j= 3r-20n+-6c-p +2i+1OC+20B+-16GQL+0j4 =4 , 2 --2b(n-2)+5 + 6y + 6t+S3i+j = .
By means of a theorem of Dr. CLEBSCHr'S I was led to the following expression for the " deficiency " of a surface of the order n having the singularities considered in the foregoing Memoir : Deficiency= -( 1-l)(n-2)(n-3 ) ( n-3)(b+c)+{q +r)+2rt ) ?
2 + 5-y+i -$ ; This should be equal to the deficiency of the reciprocal surface , viz. we must have 2(2-1)n-)(-2)(n-3)-12(n--3)(b+c)+6f+6r+24t+42p+307+12i---O=2 ; but from a combination of the last mentioned five equations we have -2n3+6n2+4n+ ( 12n36)b +(12n48)c66r-24t -41P-30y-13i-7j--8x+20--4C-10B== ; 22 227 and adding to the last preceding equation we have 26n-12c+P -i7j8X+10-4C1OB=- : .
Substituting for ' its value in terms of the accented letters , we obtain for 3 ' the value / ='-3+26n -12c +i'+7j+8'0'+4C'+-10B ' -26n'+12c'-i-7j-8Z +60 -4C -10B .
We have c'-3a++3n ' , and thence 12c--26n'= 36a+12z+10n ' ; writing herein -'=-a---2C-4B-2j3X-o , the value is = -26a+22z-20C40B20j30-10- .
Or substituting for z its value -a(n2)+B----2a , we have 12c'-26n =a(229-70)-20C-18B-20j30x22e-44a- ; or substituting for a , 6 , o their values , this is ={ -(n-1)-2b3c}(22n-70)-20C-18B-20Qj-30 -22b(n-2)+ 44/ 3+667+66t -27c(n-2)+1083+27y +270 , and adding hereto the remaining terms , -3+26n--12c+i ' + 7j'+ 8'r--0'+ 4C'+10B ' ---7j--8Z +0 4C -10B , we have 3'=_2n(n-2)(1ln-24)+ ( 66n+184)+c(93n+252)+1533+93y+ 66t +i'+ 7j'+ 8X'10'+ 4C'+10B ' -i 27 -38 --250 24C -28B .
Comparing this with the value of 3 ' , No. 63 of the foregoing Memoir , we should have O -= 1n--12c-12-3 --(xf+ 1)i ' -14%-'7r_9C'28B ' -(x+86)i+ 6j+3 5i20 +28B +-%-g(--16B8G8+16B'+ 8X'4 ' ) , or , what is the same thing , 0=13cn 48c-48P-13y + , if for shortness 4_=_-(4x'+ 4)i ' 56'-7-36C ' -112B ' -(4x +344)i +24j+70z -80 +112B +q-t(16B 8--+ -16B'+ 8x'+- ' ) .
do not attempt to verify this equation , but I will partially verify a result deducible from it ; viz. if V is the like function of the accented letters , then we have where n=(4x'4x340)i+ 24j+126X+224B + 36C-2g(16B+8Z+0 ) ; and H ' is the like function of the accented letters .
And this being so , we should have 13cn48c-48B-13-y+ I=13c'n'48c'483- ' 13r ' +H ' , or , as this may be written , 13cn-48c-48 --13-y+=-= .
We have 26n12c+3-i7j8+ 4C -10'B= ; and multiplying by --4 and adding , the equation to be verified is 13n(c-8)--13(4 +y )+In+4i+28j+3220+16C+ 40B= .
But we have from the Memoir --13n(c-8)+13(43+y ) -52j 78x+13052C-2-lI04B , which reduces the equation to H+4i-24j-46%+ 110-36C64B=- ; or substituting for II its value , this is ( 4x'4x336)i+ 80+ 10+ 160B2X(16B+ 8Z+-)=Z , that is 4('84 )i-( g2-10)(16B + 8x+ ) = , an equation which is satisfied if i'=i , X=-x , and g=20 , or else 16B+8G+0=16B'+8X'+ ' .
