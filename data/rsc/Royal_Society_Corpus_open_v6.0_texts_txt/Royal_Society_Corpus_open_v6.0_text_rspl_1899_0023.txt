" On the Chemical Classification of the Stars .

] In the attempts made to classify the stars by means of their spectra , from Rutherford 's time to quite recently , the various criteria selected were necessarily for the most part of unknown origin ; with the exception of hydrogen , calcium , iron , and carbon , in the main chemical origins could not be assigned with certainty to the spectral lines .
Hence the various groups defined by the behaviour of unknown lines were referred to by numbers , and as the views of those employed in the work of classifying differed widely as to the sequence of the phenomena observed , the numerical sequences vary very considerably so that any co-ordination becomes difficult and confusing .
Recent work has thrown such a flood of light on the chemistry of the stars that most definite chemical groupings can now be established , and the object of the present communication is to suggest a general scheme of classification in which they are employed , in relation to the line of cosmical evolution which I have developed in former papers communicated to the Society .
The fact that most of the important lines in the photographic region of the stellar spectra have now been traced to their origins renders this step desirable , although many of the chemical elements still remain to be completely investigated from the stellar point of view .
The scheme is based upon a minute inquiry into the varying intensities , in the different stars , of the lines and fiutings of the undermentioned substances:\#151 ; On .
the Chemical Classification of the Stars .
187 Certain unknown elements ( probably gaseous , unless their lines renresent " principal series " ) in the hottest stars , and the new form of hydrogen discovered by Professor Pickering ( which I term " proto-hydrogen " for the sake of clearness ) , hydrogen , helium , astenum , cakium , magnesium , oxygen , nitrogen , carbon , silicium , iron itannun copper , manganese , nickel , chromium , vanadium , strontium , the spectra being observed at the highest available spark temperatures The lines thus observed I term " enhanced ' lines , and I distinguished the kind of vapour which produces them by the affix " proto , protomagnesium , for the sake of clearness.* Iron , calcium , and manganese at arc temperatures .
Carbon ( flutings ) at arc temperatures .
Maganese and iron ( flutings ) at a still lower temperature .
In a communication to the Society !
I stated the results arrived at recently with regard to the appearances of the lines of the above substances in stars of different temperatures , and the definition of the different groups or genera to be subsequently given are based upon the map which accompanied the paper , together with more minute inquiries on certain additional points , the examination into which was suggested as the work went on .
^ So far as the inquiry has at present gone , the various most sa ion differences to be taken advantage of for grouping purposes are represented in the following stars , the information being derived from the researches of Professor Pickering !
and Mr. McClean , S as well as from the Kensington series of photographs .

Dr. Budge has been good enough to make inquiries for me , which show the change of word to have been brought about by a transcriber 's error , and that the meaning of the Arabic wor is a belt of spheres or pearls .

] In order to make quite clear that both an ascending and a descending series must be taken into account , I give herewith ( Plate 7 ) two photographs showing the phenomena observed on both sides of the temperature curve in reversing layers of stars of nearly equal mean temperatures , as determined by the enhanced lines .
The stars in question are :\#151 ; Sirius ( descending ) .
1 a Cygni ( ascending ) .
J Procyon ( descending ) .
" 1 7 Cygni ( ascending ) .
J The main differences to which I wish to draw attention are the very different intensities of the hydrogen lines in Sirius and a Cygni , and the difference in the width and intensities of the proto-metallic and metallic lines in Procyon and y Cygni .
These differences , so significant from a classification point of view , were first indicated in a communication to the Society in 1887 f , and the progress of the work on these lines has shown how important they are .
I have based the group\#151 ; or generic\#151 ; words upon the following considerations .
As we now know beyond all question that a series of geological strata from the most ancient to the most recent brings us in presence of different organic forms , of which the most recent are the most com- * ' Sir l\#169 ; s Eloifes a spectres de la troisieme classed t ' Roy .

On the Chemical Classification of the Stars .
plex , it is natural to suppose that the many sharp changes of spectra observed in a series of stars from the highest temperature to the lowest , bring us in presence of a series of chemical forms which become more complex as the temperature is reduced .
Hence we can in the stars study the actual facts relating to the workings of inorganic evolution on lines parallel to those which have already been made available in the case of organic evolution .
If then we regard the typical stars as the equivalents of the typical strata , such as the Cambrian , Silurian , \amp ; c. , it is convenient that the form of the words used to define them should be common to both ; hence I suggest an adjectival form ending in ian .
If the typical star is the brightest in a constellation , I use its Arabic name as root ; if the typical star is not the brightest , I use the name of the constellation .
The desideratum referred has to a certain extent determined the choice of stars where many were available .
I have to express my great obligations to Dr. Murray for help generously afforded in the consideration of some of the questions thus raised .

We may take for granted that as time goes on ndw intermediate genera will require to be establishedj the proposed classification lends itself conveniently to this , as there are no numerical relations to be disturbed .
A still more general chemical classification is the following , it being understood that in it only the most predominant chemical features are considered , and that there is no sharp line of separation between these larger groups .
The peculiar position of calcium and magnesium renders this caveat the more necessary .

The detailed chemical facts to be gathered from the definitions of the several genera indicate many important differences between the order of appearance of the chemical substances in the atmospheres of the stars and that suggested by the hypothetical " periodic law .
" Special investigations are in progress by which it is hoped some light may be thrown on this and other points of a like nature .
