" Appendix to a former Paper on Human Osteology .
" ByWalter Adam , M.D. Communicated by Dr. Prout , F.R.S. This appendix contains linear representations of various dimen ?
sions of the bones of the human body , both male and female , with a view to facilitate the comparison of the human frame with that of other animals , and reduce it to definite laws .
The author states that many of the rectilinear dimensions of human bones appear to be mul ?
tiples of one unit , namely , the breadth of the cranium directly over the external passage of the ear ; a dimension which he has found to be the most invariable in the body .
No division of that dimension was found by him to measure the other dimensions so accurately as that by seven , or its multiples .
Of such seventh parts there appear to be twelve in the longitudinal extent of the back , and ninety-six in the height of the whole body .
