" The Eetardation of Combustion by Oxygen .
" By Henry E. Armstrong , Ph. D. , E.R.S. Received June 9 , \#151 ; Read June 16 1904 .
In the course of his researches on gaseous explosions , H. B. Dixon has laid stress on the fact that carbon monoxide , rather than the dioxide , is the initial product of the combustion of carbon and of its gaseous compounds ; moreover , he has shown that water plays a peculiar and all-important part in the combustion of the monoxide \ and he has proved , in a number of cases , that oxygen is by far the most effective diluent in retarding combustion .
These , in some respects , paradoxical conclusions have not yet been sufficiently explained .
Recent researches* emanating from the Manchester school have brought new facts to light , however , * which have an important bearing on the interpretation of explosive changes\#151 ; so much so , indeed , that it is no longer difficult to paint a consistent and fairly complete picture of the mechanism of combustion , f 1 .
It would seem that , in the case of hydrocarbons , there is no preferential combustion either of hydrogen or of carbon : initially , the hydrocarbon merely undergoes hydroxylation .
As hydroxylation proceeds more readily when it has once taken place\#151 ; owing to the attraction of oxygen for oxygen\#151 ; the first product may easily escape observation : thus , Bone and Wheeler were unable to detect the formation of hydroxy methane ( methyl alcohol ) from methane ; Bone and Stockings , however , succeeded in obtaining ethyl alcohol , C2H5OH , from ethane , C2H6 .
2 .
A stage in the hydroxylation is soon reached when thermoschisms begin to take place .
Thus , dihydroxymethane breaks up as soon as it is formed into water and formaldehyde , which is in turn easily resolved into hydrogen and carbon monoxide : CH2(OH)2 \#151 ; ?
CH2O + OH2 \#151 ; ^ CO + H2 + OH2 .
Dihydroxyethane , in like manner , gives rise to acetaldehyde , which , under some conditions , breaks up into methane and carbon monoxide : C2H4(OH)2 \#151 ; ?
CH3.COH + OH2 \#151 ; CH4 + CO + OH2 .

It is to be supposed that the more complex hydrocarbons are , to a large extent , resolved into simpler thermoschists prior to oxidation , e.g. , CeHi4 \#151 ; C3H8 + C3H6 C2H6 \#151 ; C2H4 + H2 .
The change may extend even to the formation of carbon , when a relatively small proportion of oxygen is present .
In high temperature changes ( explosions ) , such thermoschisms probably play an all-important part .
4 .
The precise manner in which oxygen is introduced into the hydrocarbon molecule is a matter of some interest .
If oxygen molecules were directly active as wholes and the actual , immediate and sole cause of the oxidation , there would seem to be no reason why the dihydroxy-derivative should not be directly produced rather than the monhydroxy : the observation made by Bone and Stockings , that ethyl alcohol is producible from ethane , therefore , is of crucial importance .
But , on general grounds , regarding the change as electrolytic in character , it is probable that the electrolyte , i.e.y conducting water , is the immediate source of the oxygen ; and that the oxygen molecule* plays the part of depolariser .
From the same point of view , it appears probable that the water molecules contribute hydroxyl rather than oxygen .
The process may be formulated as involving the conjugation of hydrocarbon ( probably through its carbon ) with water ( acting primarily as the catalyst or associating agent ) and oxygen , thus : H3C OHH O _________ CH3.OH HO h+ohh+o ^ hoh+ho 5 .
According to the view here advocated , carbon dioxide is necessarily a later product of change than the monoxide\#151 ; in fact , the final product .
It is to be supposed that , in its formation from the monoxide , the latter is first converted into formic acid .
On this assumption , it is easy to understand that the presence of so large a proportion of water is required in order that the explosive wave may attain to its greatest velocity , as the affinity of water for carbon monoxide is relatively slight and the reversible change one which takes place mainly in the direction : HCO(OH ) CO + OH2 .
* The need of distinctive names for oxygen-stuff or atomic oxygen and of the molecular oxygen we handle is very obvious in discussing such a point as this .

38-4 1266 The gradual retardation observed when the proportion of steam is increased beyond 5'6 per cent , may be due to a variety of causes : to the steam acting as a diluent ; to an increase in the extent to which water is unburnt by the carbon monoxide ; and , perhaps , in no slight measure , also to the tendency of the steam to hold back the oxygen .
6 .
It is to this last circumstance that the marked influence of oxygen in retarding combustion is probably attributable .
This influence is especially noteworthy in the case of electrolytic gas , inasmuch as excess of hydrogen has precisely the opposite effect and nitrogen retards the explosion less than does an excess of oxygen .
According to Dixon , the rates , in metres per second , at which various mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen and of electrolytic gas and nitrogen explode , are as follows :\#151 ; 4H2 : 1IO2 3532 3H2 : 4O2 3527 \lt ; N O \lt ; M H \lt ; M 3268 H2 : \#163 ; 02 2821 H2 : 02 2328 H2:i02+ JN , 2426 H2 : 202 1927 H2 : ^02 + 1*N2 2055 H2 l 302 1707 H2 ' .

Trans. , ' A , 1893 , vol. 184 , p. 97 .

89 and water is an endothermic process .
In fact , it is to be supposed that water is readily oxidised at temperatures such as prevail in combustions .
If , however , the formation of water be regarded as involving the changes H OHH 0 HOH HO h+ohh+o^ ' hoh+ho 2H20-2 \lt ; ---- ?
2H20 + 02 it follows that water and oxygen will mutually hold each other in check : so that when electrolytic gas is exploded there will be a deficiency of oxygen , as it were , owing to its conversion into hydrogen peroxide , which may be regarded as relatively , if not entirely , inoperative as an oxidising agent at high temperatures in presence of oxygen .
On the other hand , when excess of oxygen is present , the water\#151 ; which is the effective catalyst\#151 ; will be more or less held back , also in consequence of its oxidation to hydrogen peroxide .
The marked influence of hydrogen in promoting the combustion of electrolytic gas is in full harmony with this conclusion ; indeed , it is difficult to explain it in any other way than by supposing that , when present in excess , the hydrogen serves to promote the dissociation of the peroxide by diminishing the proportion of active oxygen present : in other words , according as hydrogen or oxygen is in excess , equilibrium is disturbed in one direction or the other .
The interaction of hydrogen and oxygen may , perhaps , be supposed to be incomplete at high temperatures , less because the steam is partially dissociated than on account of the division of the oxygen between the hydrogen and water .
[ Note added June 29.\#151 ; The experiments on the oxidation of ethane at so low a temperature as 300 , recently described by Bone and Stockings , have shown that change proceeds with surprising rapidity in the case of mixtures containing ethane and oxygen in the ratio 2:1 or 1:1 , the oxygen disappearing within 30\#151 ; 45 minutes ; whereas when sufficient oxygen was present to burn the hydrocarbon completely to steam and carbon dioxide ( 1 : 3'5 ) , a considerable quantity of oxygen and some ethane remained unchanged even after 2 days .
There can be little doubt , therefore , that oxygen has a specific retarding effect even at so low a temperature as 300 ' ; and there would seem to be no reason to suppose that the changes which occur at low temperatures are in any essential respect different from those at high temperatures .
