An Account of the Organs of Generation of the Mexican Proteus , called by the Natives Axolotl .
By Sir Everard Home , Bart. V.P.R.S. Read June 17 , 1824 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1824 , p. 419 .
] The specimens described in this paper were taken in the month of June , in a lake three miles from Mexico , at an elevation of 8000 feet above the level of the sea .
The usual temperature of the lake is 600 , and they are in such abundance as to form a principal article of food of the peasantry .
By the assistance of annexed drawings by Mr. Bauer , Sir Evrerard fully describes the male and female organs of these animals , and is enabled to decide that they are a full grown and perfect tribe .
" The attack therefore , " says the author , " made upon Mr. John Hunter 's sagacity by Mr. Rusconi , in his work sir les Amours des Salamandres Aquatiques , retorts upon himself .
