( Abstract .
) The author has prismatically examined various flames containing carbon .
He finds that certain rays of light are common to ignited oxycarbons , hydrocarbons , nitrocarbons , and sulphocarbons , and concludes that these common rays are those emanating from ignited carbon vapour .
By special manipulation he obtains the carbon spectrum with olefiant gas , cyanogen , carbonic oxide , and bisulphide of carbon .
Observed by the naked eye , the prevailing colour of ignited carbon is light blue .
