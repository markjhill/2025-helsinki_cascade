( Abstract .
) In the memoir " On Tschirnhausen 's Transformation , " Phil. Trans. vol. clii .
( 1862 ) pp. 561-568 , I considered the case of a quartic equation : viz. it was shown that the equation ( a , 6 , c , d , ex , l)4=0 is , by the substitution y= ( ax+b)B+(ax2+46+ 3c)C +(ax3+46x2+ 6cx+3d)D , transformed into ( 1 , 0 , I , C , y( , 1)4=0 , where ( ?
, M , @ ) have certain given values .
It was further remarked that ( Q , , , e ) were expressible in terms of U ' , I ' , d ' , invariants of the two forms ( a , , c , c , , ejX , Y)4 , ( B , C , W ) -Y , -X)2 , of I , J , the inva2s riants of the first , and of o ' , =BD--C , the invariant of the second of these two forms , -viz .
that we have =H ' -210 ' , @= IU"3-3 '3 -+ I'20 + 12J'0'U ' +2 I'eO'H ' .
And by means of these I obtained an expression for the quadrinvariant of the form ( 1 , 0 , C , X , @yI , 1)4 ; viz. this was found to be =IU'2+ 4-IO 2+12JO'U ' .
But I did not obtain an expression for the cubinvariant of the same function : such expression , it was remarked , would contain the square of the invariant 4 ' ; it Was probable that there existed an identical equation , JU'3--IU'2H'+4H'3"+Me'= --'2 , which would serve to express 4,1'2 in terms of the other invariant ; but , assuming that such an equation existed , the form of the factor M remained to be ascertained ; and until this was done , the expression for the cubinvariant could not be obtained in its most simple form .
I have recently verified the existence of the identical equation just referred to , and have obtained the expression for the factor M ; and with the assistance of this identical equation I have obtained the expression for the cubinvariant of the form ( 1 , 0 , C , l , @y , 1)4 .
The expression for the quadrinvariant was , as already mentioned , given in the former memoir : I find that the two invariants are in fact the invariants of a certain linear function of U , I-I ; viz. the linear function is =U'U + -O'IH ; so that , denoting by I* , Jthe quadrinvariant and the cubinvariant respectively of the form ( 1 , 0 , C , , @y )4 , we have I=I ( U'U t 41'1H ) .
J$=J(U'U+40'11 ) , where I , J signify the functional operations of forming the two invariants respectively .
The function ( 1 , 0 , C , D , e5jy , 1)4 , obtained by the application of Tschirnhausen 's transformation to the equation ( a , b , c , d , e x , 1)4=0 , has thus the same invariants with the function U'U+4O0'H =U'( , 6 , c , d , e(x , 1)4+40'(ac-6l , ad-bec , ae+26d-3c2 , be-cd , ce-d27p , 1)4I and it is consequently a linear transformation of the last-mentioned function ; so that the application of Tschirnhausen 's transformation to the equation U=0 gives an equation linearly transformable into , and thus virtually equivalent to , the equation U'U+40'H=-0 , which is an equation 40 ' involving the single parameter : this appears to me a result of considerable interest .
It is to be remarked that Tschirnhausen 's transformation , wherein y is put !
equal to a rational and integral function of the order 54 n--1 ( if n be the order of the equation in x ) , is not really more general than the transformation wherein y is put equal to any rational function vw whatever of x ; such rational function may , in fact , by means of the given equation in x , be reduced to a rational and integral function of the order n-1- ; hence in the present case , taking V , W to be respectively of the order i1 , =3 , it follows that the equation in y obtained by the elimination of x from the equations =(a , 6 , c , d ex , l ) =40 , Y ( a , ' , i't , 6'wx , 1 ) is a mere linear transformation of the equation AU+-BH==0 , where A , B are functions ( not as yet calculated ) of ( a , 6 , c , d , e , a , / S , y , C , o ' , y ' , y , ')4 .
