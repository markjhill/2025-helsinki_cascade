" A Mathematical Theory of Magnetism .
" By William Thomson , M.A. , F.R.S.E. , Fellow of St. Peter 's College , Cambridge , and Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Glasgow .
The theory of magnetism was first mathematically treated in a complete form by Poisson , Brief sketches of his theory , with some simplifications , have been given by Green and Murphy in their works on Electricity and Magnetism .
In all these writings a hypothesis of two magnetic fluids has been adopted , and strictly adhered to throughout .
No physical evidence can be adduced in support of such a hypothesis ; but on the contrary , recent discoveries , especially in electro-magnetism , render it extremely improbable .
Hence it is of importance that all reasoning with reference to magnetism should be conducted without assuming the existence of those hypothetical fluids .
The writer of the present paper endeavours to show that a complete mathematical theory of magnetism may be established upon the sole foundation of facts generally known , and Coulomb 's special experimental researches .
The positive parts of this theory agree with those of Poisson 's mathematical theory , and consequently the elementary mathematical formule coincide with those which have been previously given by Poisson .
The paper at present laid before the Royal Society is restricted to the elements of the mathematical theory , exclusively of those parts in which the phenomena of magnetic induction are considered .
84.6 The author expresses his hope to lay before the Society a continuation , containing some original mathematical investigations on magnetic distributions , and a theory of induction , in ferromagnetic or diamagnetic substances .
