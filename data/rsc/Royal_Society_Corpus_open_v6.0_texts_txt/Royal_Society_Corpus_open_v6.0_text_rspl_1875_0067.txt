PREFACE TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS .
Page The Preliminary Reports have been prepared at the request of Professor WyYille Thomson .
They have been compiled during the past three weeks from notes taken daily during the past three years .
In only a few cases has it been possible to refer to the objects remarked upon , they having been sent home for greater safety , or packed a , my beyond reach .
When specimens taken early in the cruise can be placed side by side and compared with the more recent revelations of the trawl , dredge , or sounding1 ube , many of the statements herein made may require to be modified .
Reports on three years ' work , prepared under the disadrnntages above mentioned , must necessarily be very incomplete ; and indulgence may be asked till the final Report can be issued .
To all my coadjutors , ua-i , al and ciYilian , I am indebted for much assistan@e , especir~lly to Mr. Wild for his drawings , to l\fr .
Buchanan for much information concerning the chemical constituents of the bottoms , and to Professor Thomson for assisfance and aclYice , not only in preparing these Reports , but also while carrying on the investigations of which they are intended 1.o gfrc some account .

Preliminary Report on Specimens of the Sea-bottoms obtained in the Soundings , Dredgings , and Trawlings of H.l\l.S .
'Challenger , ' in ihe years 1873-75 , between England and Valparaiso .
Method of }Voi\#183 ; 7.:.-During ihe first six months of the expedition the sounding-apparatus in use on board was proYided wi1.h a rnry narrow cylinder , which brought up only a very small quantity of the bottom .
In July 1873 Capt. Nares had a much larger cylinder fitted to the instrument , one with a 2-inch bore ; and later on he caused the weights to be so arranged with respect to the cylinder that the latter projected some 18 inches beneath the former .
This arrangement , the cylinder of which is ahrnys provided with the common butterfly-valve , usually gives us a very large quantity of the 472 Mr. J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined bottom in each sounding .
Sometimes the tube has been forced fully 18 inches into the bottom , and has brought up frequently as much as a quart of the ooze , mud , or clay .
When the tube arrives on board the contents are carefully removed , and the colour , extent , and arrangement of the section* is noted .
A portion is washed seveml times in distilled water and dried , a portion is submitted to a rough analysis , and the remainder , if any , is preserved in spirit .
The analysis consists in determining so far as possible :1 .
The kin .
else of organisms present , and their relative abundance , whether carbonate of lime or siliceous , and whether alive or dead .
2 .
The kin.cl and quantity of amorphous an.cl mineral matter , and its ratio to the remains of the above organisms .
This is accomplished by decanting the finer from the coarser particles , and examining each with the microscope .
When carbonate of lime is present this is removed by weak acid , and the specimen is again examined .
When manganese is present in great quantity this is removed by strong hydrochloric acid , an.cl again an examination is made .
Very frequently portions of the upper layers are placed in colouring solutions ( as carmine , magenta , \amp ; c. ) , for the purpose of rendering more distinct any organized material , should any be present .
When the dredge or trawl brings up much , a considerable quantity is preserved for future work , and what remains is c , ; 'trefully sifted .
The siftings are examined and preserved .
Lately it has been the custom to send clown tow-nets loosely attached to the trawl or dredge and at the weights in front of the trawl .
'rhese often bring up specimens of the bottom when the trawl fails to do so .
As these nets clo not probably sink deep into the ooze , they give us a surer idea of the nature of the surface-layers than previously obtained by the trawl alone .
List of the Soundings ctncl D1\#183 ; eclgings , with an ctbsti-act of the nctture of the bottom in each case where ct set1nple has been p1\#183 ; ocured .
Explancttory Note.-The following remarks under each sounding or dredging have been abstracted from notes made daily during the cruise .
In making the abstract the object in view has been to indicate so far as possible the relative abundance in each sample of-Remains of carbonate-of-lime organisms ; Remains of siliceous organisms ; Mineral particles , as quartz and mica ; Glauconite , pumice , manganese , \amp ; c. ; and Amorphous clayey and calcareous matter .
It has been thought that , howeyer incomplete , such an abstract 11ill in the mean time be useful to naturalists and geologists .
It will give some * i.e. the vertical section , which is always greater the further tho tube has been forced into the ooze or clay .
on board H.M.S. 'Challenger .
' 473 idea of the nature and distribution of the deposits which are taking place in the oceans and seas we have visited .
It will also furnish some data and serve as the basis for speculations on the mocle of origin 0\#163 ; The deep-sea clays ; The formation 0\#163 ; the manganese nodules ; The presence of the remains of surface animals ( consisting 0\#163 ; siliceous and carbonate-of-lime organisms ) in some deposits , and their absence in others , \amp ; c. By pelagic Foraminifera are meant species of Globigei\#183 ; inct , Orbulinct , pqdvinulinct , and 0\#163 ; one or two other genera which are still undescribed , but which have been found abundantly in the surface-waters 0\#163 ; the Pacific and South Atlantic oceans .
When the final Report is prepared , the genera or species 0\#163 ; the organisms whose remains occnr in each sample will be given .
So also for the mineral particles , and the ratio 0\#163 ; these to each other and to the amorphous , clayey , and calcareous matter will be more accurately stated .
At the present moment such an undertaking is in no way possible .
Those things which are most abundant in the sample are generally mentioned first .

No bottom came up in the tube .
I here copy in extenso from my Journal notes so far as they relate to the bottom in the trawl : " The trawl came up in the afternoon fouled , but in it were three or four quarts of m:mganese nodules varying from the size of a hen 's egg to that of a pea .
" The weights ( 300 fathoms from the trawl ) were all scored and marked on board H.M.S. 'Challenger .
' 517 with streaks of black , as if they had been dragged over lumps of manganese .
" The tow-net just behind these weights had in it very many Globige1\#183 ; in ; e , Pulviniilinr ; e , and one or two Orbiilinr ; e ( all dead ) , a good many manganese pellets and a very little mud .
" This net would seem to have caught the particles knocked up by the weights in front .
One of the tow-nets at the trawl was foll to the brim a\#163 ; a yellow or , rather , light-brown-coloured mud , in which were many manganese nodules .
Being so full of mud , not much of the finer portions of the bottom could have been washed away ; hence this tow-net of mud gives us information from which some idea may be formed of the ratio which the manganese nodules bear to the ooze .
Iu a peck of the mud there was a little over a quart of manganese nodules .
The nodules were all nearly round .
Some of the smaller ones were composed of the black manganese to the centre , while some had just a small yellow spot in the centre .
Some of the larger ones had a yellow or dark green nucleus of about half an inch in diameter , which was surrounded by concentric layers 0\#163 ; peroxide of manganese of half an inch in thickness .
The yellow or green nucleus was soft , and could be cut with the knife like new cheese .
Under the microscope it presented a mottled appearance , with yellow and light- and dark-green spaces , many 0\#163 ; these being partially surrounded with agate bands .
" Foramini\#163 ; era could also be seen imbedded in the mass ; but all the carbonate of lime had been removed , strong nitric acid having no effect on any part 0\#163 ; this nucleus .
Bi.rds'-feet-like extensions of the black manganese ramified into the yellow nucleus ; and it seemed as if the mangane~e was extending into the nucleus as well as being deposited in concentric layers around it , as in those instances where pumice forms the nucleus of a nodule .
There were lumps of the bottom in the tow-net which seemed to show the beginning of this process of nodule-formation .
These lumps , which were 0\#163 ; a redder colour than the rest of the bottom , seemed to be cemented by a reel substance ( ?
) .
" Examined a portion 0\#163 ; the bottom in the same way as usual with the soundings .
It contained :-many Globigerinas , Pulvinuliuas ( the pyramidal variety ) , and a few Orbulinas ; one or two U vigerinas , and some Biloculinas and others ; two arenaceous forms of Foraminifera , the tests composed of particles of manganese and a red mineral ; many Coccoliths and Rhabdoliths ; only two portions of siliceous spines and three lfacliolaria were observed .
" Removing the manganese from the washing there remained :-A good many mineral particles ( those were almost all of a dark lead-colour and very areolar structure , reminding one of yolcanic ash and 1:1coria ) ; onG small yellow crystal , several pieces of a red cherty-like mineral , and 0110 quartz-like particle were noticed ; manganese grains were abundant .

RE)'[.A.RKS ON TUE FOREGOING LIST .
Several kinds of deposits have been indicated in the foregoing list .
]for the present these may be classed under the following heads:1 .
Shore-deposits .
( a ) Blue and green muds.-hlet with near the shores of most of the great continents and islands .
( b ) Grey muds and sancls.-1\ Jet with chiefly near oceanic islands of volcanic origin .
( c ) Reel much.-Met with on tho eastern coast of South America .
( cl ) Coral-much.-Met with near coral reefs .
2 .
Globigerina-ooze.-An abundant oceanic deposit not met with south of latitude 50 ' S. 3 .
Racliolarian ooze.-An oceanic deposit met " \#183 ; ith only in the Western and Miclclle Pacific .
4 .
Diatornaceous ooze.-An oceanic deposit mot with only south of 50 ' S. latitude .
5 .
Reel and Grey Clays.-The most abundant oceanic deposit .
The above names haYo been selected as indicating those elements which give tho predominating character of the deposit .
As a rule , when the debris of continents or islands , the dead shells of Foraminifera , the exuviro of Radiolarians \amp ; c. , the frustules of Diatoms , or reel or grey clayey matter-when any of ihese have appeared to make up considerably more than one half of the specimen under examination , it has been called a shore-deposit , a Globigerina , Radiolarian , or Diatom ooze , or reel or grey clay .
Sometimes it has been doubtful whether a specimen should be placed under one of the aboYe heads or another , on account of the nearly equal ratio of constituents , or where one deposit overlies another of a different kind .
In these cases iho specimen has been placed under that head with which , on a general Yiew , it has seemed to have most in common , or to which the surface-layer belonged , and a detailed description has been added in the list .
A sixth kind of deposit or formation might have been added , to embrace those bottoms in which a great quantity of the peroxide of manganese occurs .
This substance , in the form of nodules or concretions , of incrustations or in grains , has been found in nearly all on board H.M.S. ' Challenger .
' 519 sea-deposits and at all depths in more or less abundance .
However , for the present , it bas been considered best to treat of its occurrence separately , at the some time pointing out those regions , Yhere we have found it in greatest abundance .
A few remarks may now be made upon each of the kinds of deposits indic:1ted .
I. Sho1\#183 ; e-cleposits.-It bas been found that the deposits taking place near continents and islands have received their chief characteristic from the presence of the debris of adjacent lands .
In some cases 1.bese deposits extend io :1 distance of owr 150 miles from the coast .
Sernral .-arieties can be recognized amongst these shore-deposits .
( a ) Bliie and Green 1\fiicls .
In the great majority of cases the deposits near continents and large islands , containing the older and crystalline rocks , have been of a blue or green colour ; the only exception :1ppears to be the east coast of South America , where we have :1 reel mud , to be presently referred to .
In from 100 to 700 fathoms these deposits are often of a green colour , due to the presence of green amorphous clayey matter , and dark and pale green glauconite particles .
Beyond 700 fathoms they are usually of a blue or dark slate-colour , having a thin upper layer of a reel or brown .
This reel layer is a soft ooze , whilst the blue mud or clay beneath is very compact and tenacious .
Much amorphous clayey matter and fine particles of mica , quartz , and other minerals are found in all these deposits , the mineral particles increasing in size as we approach the land .
Down to 1500 fathoms , we have generally found that Pteropod , larval Gasteropod , and Lamellibranch shells , Year tolerably abundant , and that there were many of the shore forms of Foraminifera , as Textularias , Rotularias , N odosarias , U vigerinas , Lagenas , \amp ; c. Pelagic Foraminifera occur throughout the deposit , but not in such abandance as in a true oeeancleposit .
The frustules of Diatoms and their broken parts are numerous .
1\Ianganese grains are found in many of the bottoms , usually in the deeper soundings .
We have also found im bedded in these muds pieces of wood , fruits , portions of fruits , and leaves of trees .
Largo pieces of ~\#183 ; ock , as pumice and granite , and rounded pebbles also occur .
Our sounclmgs near the southern ice-barrier were muds of a blue colour , containing 111~ny granitic and other pebbles and blocks , mostly rounded , and many Diatoms , and resembled in most respects the deposits we found off the east coast of North America , Halifax to New York .
Beyond 1500 or 1700 fathoms , Pteropod and IIeteropod Rhells are usually not found , and in 3000 fathoms hardly a Foraminiforous or other carbonate-of-lime organism remains .
Siliceous organisms occur at all depths , but aL times their remains would seem to be completely removed .
'Ihese green and blue muds have been found to prevail in all the en520 Mr. J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined closed seas we have visited , as Arafura , Banda , Celebes , and China Seas , Inland Sea of Japan ; and in all these the carbonate-of-lime organisms would appear to be removed from the bottoms in depths less by some 400 or 500 fathoms than on open coasts .
In the green muds from 50 to 700 fathoms we have found those beautiful casts of Foraminifera , Pteropods , Echini-spines , and other carbonateoflime organisms frequently in great numbers .
These are of a dadc green , pale green , and dirty white colour .
In all cases where these green internal casts occur we have many glauconite grains in the bottom .
Beyond 700 fathoms these casts seldom occur , and when they do they are very sparingly distributed ; and the same may be said of the glauconite grains which accompany them .
River-muds , in which Pteropocls , Racliolaria , and pelagic Foraminifera are usually wanting , are included in these deposits .
The following are the localities in which we have found the blue muds ( an * before the locality indicates that the glauconite casts and grains have been found there ) :~ , Off coast of Portugal .
, , Virgin Islands ( ?
) .
* , , Coast of North America , Halifax to Now York .

fms. 5GO 200 10 255 152 ( b ) G1\#183 ; ey Jluds and Sctnds.-Near volcanic islands , ve have found that the deposits have a distinctive character , from the presence of the debris of yolcanic rocks .
The presence of pieces of pumice , scoria , \amp ; c. prevents this deposit having that clayey character so characteristic of the blue mud .
The colour is generally grey , but occasionally is a black sand or a more or less slate-coloured mud .
In some places the shells of oceanic organisms make up a large part of these muds .
Down to about 1500 fathoms we have Pteropocl , Heteropod , and surface Gasteropod shells , and the shore forms of Foraminifera are common .
Deeper than 1500 fathoms , Pteropod shells are rare or entirely removed .
Pelagic :Foraminifera are found at all depths ; but occasionally they and the siliceous organisms are quite absent at a depth of little over 2000 fathoms , and then we have a clay or mud with many small particles of pumice , scoria , \amp ; c. Manganese appears to be intimately associated with some of these bottoms , especially where the debris of augitic lavas are present , as at Sandwich Islands , Canaries , and elsewhere .
Off the Desertas , in 670 fathoms , all the dead shells , pieces of Polyzoa , \amp ; c. had a slight coating of this substance , and we have had indications of the same thing in even less depths .
In 1100 fathoms off the Canaries some pieces of shell had rather a thick coating ; and in 1575 fathoms , not far from this place , the dredge brought up a great quantity of a Gorgonoid axis deeply imbedded in or coated with this black oxide of manganese .
In some localities this deposit extends to a great distance from the islands , as at Hawaii , 200 miles or more .

'oraminifera have been observed of a 522 Mr. J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined reel colour .
These were usually Yery rougb , and bad not the delicate hues of the green glauconite casts .
One very remarkable exception occurs :-off the Crozets there were ( in 600 fathoms ) many beautiful casts of the carbonate-of-lime organisms of a pale straw-colour .
None of the glauconito grains wore noticed in the same sounding or locality .
( c ) Reel Mucl.-It bas already been stated that tho deposit along tho east coast of South America , from Cape San Roque to Bahia , differed from the deposits found along the shores of other continents and large islands in being of a reel colour .
There can be little doubt but that this xecl colour is clue to the presence of the ochreous matter carried into the Atlantic by the South-American rivers .
There are reasons for thinking that the reel colour of some of the deep-sea clays in this region of the Atlantic may hay a like origin .
The soundings near the shore and in shallow water have a deeper reel colour and contain larger mineral particles and fewer organic remains than those further from land and in deeper water .
The minernl particles are chiefly quartz and mica .
In all these soundings there are many pelagic and other Foraminifera , Heteropod , Pteropod , larrnl Gasteropod , and Lamellibranch shells , Coccoliths , and Rhabcloliths .
Siliceous organic remains , as of Diatoms and Racliolaria , are almost quite absent in these bottoms .
In some of tho shallower depths a few reel-coloured casts of I\lt ; 'oraminifera were observed ; but these were rare , rough , and more or less imperfect .
The follo\ving are the depths of the soundings along this coast :fins .
fms. fms. 500 32 poo ( cl ) Ooml-J1ucl.-This is a deposit found in the neighbourhood of coral reefs .
It is characterized by a large quantity of amorphous calcareous matter , by the debris of coral reefs , by many large calcareous forms of Foraminifera , and by broken pieces of Polyzoa , \amp ; c. All the deposits about Bermuda are of this nature , extending from the edge of the reef clown to a depth of 2500 fathoms .
At 1000 fathoms the much assumes a rose tinge ; this deepens into a reel colour with greater depth and tho accompanying decrease of carbonate of lime and increase of clayey matter , until the coral-mud merges into the red and grey clays of the surrounding ocean .
About Bermuda very few mineral particles were found .
In some of the soundings to the S. w .
of the island there were some small pieces of a green rock like those at St. Paul 's Rocks , and probably serpentine .
Ono or two pieces of quartz , or saniclin , a piece of mica , and a small piece of pumice ( ?
) wore also noticed .

Ex:cept at Cape York , these muds appeared to exist as a narrow band arouncl the lancl , and had usually a considerable admixture of clayey matter and mineral particles .

Globigerina-oo::e.-After the deep-sea clays , this is the most abundant deep-sea deposit .
It has occurred at all depths from 250 fathoms to 2900 fathoms .
The Globigerince , which give at once the name and the chief characteristic to this deposit , are really found all ornr the bott'om of the ocean .
Even in our deepest clays , if the surface-layers be selected and all the amorphous matter be washed away , one or two shells of some yariety of pelagic Foraminifera can usually be detected .
By pursuing this method I have only failed on one or two occasions .
They appear to be quite absent in the Arafura Sea .
It is , however , when they occur in vast numbers that they form the deposit known by this name ; at least such is the sense in which it is here used .
We did not find a Globigerina-ooze in any of the enclosed seas , in ihe Southern Ocean south of lat. 50 ' S. , nor in the North Pacific norlh of lat. 10 ' N. In the Southern Ocean only one small species of Globigerina was found in the surface-\#183 ; waters ; but in the North Pacific many yaricties of pelagic l\lt ; 'oraminifera abound near the surface of the ocean .
In other parts of the preceding oceans , and in the other oceans we have Yisited , it occurs in irregular patches , being a1'Yays present in 1.he open ocean when we have depths of less than 1800 fathoms .
Its presence or absence at depths beyond 1800 fathoms is , howewl ' , determined by conditions at present unlmo , n1 .
A number of yarici.ies occur both as to colour and composition .
Some Rpecimcns are nearly pure , , hite , others ha Ye a rose-colour , and others are reel or dark bro , , n. The reel and brown colour arises from the presence of tho oxides of it-on and 524 Mr. J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined manganese .
In the white varieties the sediment , after dissolving awai the carbonate of lime , is in some specimens abundant , in others no abundant , and is either of a red or slate-blue colour .
We find th former colour to prevail in those soundings far from continents and large , islands , and the sediment is not abundant except where pumice or scori : is present .
The latter , or slate-blue colour , is found in those sounding , more or less near continents and large islands ; and it is suspected tha\#183 ; this sediment has its source chiefly from the disintegration of these ( adjacent lands .
Mica , quartz , pumice , scoria , and other mineral particles are met with but in those soundings furthest from land a little piece of pumice OJ scoria may be the only trace of mineral particles .
In some specimens there are very many remains of organisms wit } siliceous shells , as Radiolaria , Diatoms , and Challengerias ; but in othen these remains are almost entirely wanting .
In three soundings in midAtlantic between the Canary and Virgin Islands , and in seyeral soundingf in the South Pacific , manganese in the forms of grains and nodular concretions is very abundant .
As a rule , however , this substance occurs rather sparingly in Globigerinct-ooze .
In some instances we get little nodules of these bottoms , the shells as it were being run together by a siliceous cement .
J\fany small pieces of cherty-like mineral also occur , which are angular and soft , and do not look as if they had been transported .
Manganese nodules occurring in the Globigerina-ooze ham often a nucleus of a yellow and green colour , in which Globigei\#183 ; ina-shells can be seen ; but their carbonate of lime has been entirely r emove d , and replaced by a silicate .
There are reasons for thinking that these indications of flint ( ?
) occur only in those samples where the siliceous shells of Radiolaria , Diatoms , \amp ; c. are wanting , and do not occur where these organisms are present .
A reexamination of all the bottoms must be made before this statement can be definitely affirmed .
Casts of Fornminifera occur very sparingly in Glob1'g erina-ooze ; in the purest samples not at all .
In those with an admixture of clayey matter , ro have frequently one or two partial casts of a very rough character .
In two soundings , Nos. 211 and 301 , in the Pacific , we found the Foraminifera not only filled , but also coated with a reel substance , so that we bad both an internal and an external cast , the two being connected by little rods representing the foramina of the shell .
In these soundings there was much clayey matter and disintegrating pumice and scoria .
In a few soundings in the Pacific , as No. 304 , we have Jiad n , Globigerina-ooze on the surface of the bottom , and a foot beneath a nearly pure reel or brown clay .
.Again , as in Nos. 2G8 and 307 , .re hnYe the reY erse arrangement , a clay occupying the surface , and the deeper byers h::wing many Globigerinm .
In all these cases the surface-fayer }ins been normal with the other soundings in the same region us to .

In the first case we might bring in elevation to account for the on board H.M.S. ccliallenger .
' 525 Gfobigerina-ooze ornrlying the red clay , or we might suppose that chemical changes are going on in the deeper layers which remove the carbonate of lime .
In the second ca8e we may account for a red clay owrlying a deposit with many Globigei\#183 ; ince in it by supposing a depression of the bottom after the latter had been laid down ; or we may helieve that agencies are now removing carbonate of lime from the surface-layer , and that these were not active in some past time .
This deposit occurs , in one sounding , in the Pacific at a depth of 2925 fathoms in mid-ocean .
In the eastern part of the Atlantic it occurs also at great depths .

Rctdiolarian Ooze.-Organisms with the siliceous skeletons abound in the surface-waters , and apparently also in the deepest waters , of all the oceans and seas we have visited it'_ The skeletons of these organisms are found in all , or almost all , the sea-bottoms .
Even in those cases where at first sight they would seem to be quite absent , a more careful examination ( by dissolving away a large quantity of carbonate of lime where this exists , and examining the sediment by careful ,.-ashing in tlrn case 0\#163 ; clays , \amp ; c. ) will usually reveal a Racliolarian skeleton , a Diatom frustule , or broken portions 0\#163 ; these .
It is , however , only in some limited areas that these exuyifc rise into such prominence as to be characteristic 0\#163 ; the deposit taking place .
Such is the case in the Antarctic , where we have a Diatom-ooze , and in the Western and Middle Pacific , where we have ihe above deposit .
* They arc , however , much more numerous in tho Pacific than in the Atlantic , especially in tho equatorial waters .
526 Mr. J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined Our deepest sounding ( 4475 fathoms or 4575 , seep .
504 ) was a Radio larian ooze ; with the exception of a little amorphous matter , manganes particles , a few yello\Y cberty-like particles , and some pumice pieces , thi bottom was entirely composed 0\#163 ; the exuvirn of organisms with siliceou skeletons-as Radiolaria , one or two Diatoms , and some organisms which seem to be undescribed ( Ohallengerias ) , but which are numerous in th deeper waters of the Pacific ( see notes on surface animals , p. 536 ) .
A section of about 3 inches came up .
The upper two were of a re , colour , clue to the presence of much manganese ; the lower one was : pale straw-colour , and contained relatively few manganese grains .
In our trip from the Sandwich Islands to the Society Islands we agai1 met with Radiolarian ooze .
Between 7 ' and 12 ' north of the equator w , came on a patch represented by four soundings , some of these containin~ not a single Globigerinct ; then just on the equator , in two soundings , orn at a depth of 2925 fathoms , we got a Globigerinct-ooze containing a good many Racliolaria .
Between 2 ' and 10 ' south we again bad a patch o Racliolarian ooze represented by three soundings , and containing only r few pelagic Foraminifera or their broken parts .
The occurrence of thif patch of Globigerinci-ooze in the position indicated ( see map , Plate 20 ) and the comparative or total absence of the Globigerina-shells in thE deposits a little to the north and south of it , is sufficiently curious and significant .
It will be well to note that , in the Globiger\#183 ; inct-patch , manganese and other mineral particles are much lesa abundant than in thE adjacent Radiolarian .
Note also the presence of the south equatoria\#183 ; current and the clip of some isotherms over the Globigerina-patch .
Onc or two soundings to the east of Japan might have been classed unde1 this head ; but in them the siliceous remains do not make up over one third of the sample in bulk .
Generally it may be said that in tht Was tern and Middle Pacific the siliceous remains of R.acliolaria and Diatoms are abundant in the deposits , whereas in the South Pacific and Atlantic they are much less so , or absent in the bottoms .
The following are the depths of the soundings placed under the head of Radiolarian ooze :fms .

R ed and G1\#183 ; ey Olays.-By far the most abundant oceanic deposits are the deep-sea clays .
These are of a grey , red , or dark chocolate-colour , and are found at depths greater than 2000 fathoms .
The red and chocolatecolours 0\#163 ; many of these clays is due to the presence of the oxide of iron in the first and of oxide of manganese in the latter instance .
l\Iost of them contain some carbonate 0\#163 ; lime in the form of Globige1\#183 ; ina-shells ; in one or two instances , however , I have not been able to find a single shell , nor has acid caused the least bubble of effervescence .
The remains of siliceous organisms occur also in great numbers in the clays 0\#163 ; some regions-so much so that , as I have stated , some of those soundings in the North-west Pacific which have been classed as clays might have been called Radiolarian ooze .
In most places , however , they are nearly or quite absent .
These clays are not amorphous in the true sense 0\#163 ; the word-not amorphous in the sense in which a chemical precipitate is amorphous .
They all contain small white and other coloured mineral particles in great abundance- exceedingly small particles , so as to be recognized only under the high powers of the microscope .
1'hey contain amorphous matter , it is true ; but it is doubtful if this eyer makes up so much as a half of any sample in bulk .
They also contain larger mineral particles , as quartz , mica , pumice , scoria , peroxide of manganese , and other mineral particles .
Quartz and mica particles appear to be present only in some localities , as the Nor th Atlantic aml elsewhere .
Peroxide of manganese is perhaps always present in the form of grains or nodules , sparingly cli~tributed in _some regions , in others making up nearly a half of the ctepos1t or formation .
Pumice ( the common felspathic or the highly vesicular angitic variety ) and scoria appear to be univer sally distributed oyer the bottom of tho ocean , and to be abundant in most of the derp-sea rlays and present in thorn all .
In those clays furthest from continents and islands sharks ' t cot h , car-bones of whales , other bones of whales , and bones of turtles ( ?

The peroxide of manganese , in the form of minute grains , concretions , nodules , aggregations , or incrustations , occurs widely distributed in ocean-deposits .
It has been met with most frequently in the deep-sea clays ; indeed it seems to be present in all of them , sparingly in some localities , abundantly in others .
It is , however , not confined to these clays ; it has been found in most of the other deposits and at all depths greater than 500 fathoms .
In the Globigerina- and Radiolurian ooze and in the clays it usually assumes the forms of minute grains , pellets , and nodules .
In those bottoms to which it gives a chocolate-colour , the higher po , verse of the microscope show small , round , red-brown grains of manganese , often with a dark spot in the centre .
The nodules vary from little pellets to masses of a large size and of seyeral pounds in weight .
In some regions every thing at ihe bottom , even the bottom itself , would appear to be overlaid by and impregnated with this substance .
In the foregoing list , as at No. 318 and elsewhere , some of the nodules have been described with a little detail .
The \#183 ; ntrieties which are most commonly procured may be here mentioned : Nodules of a black-brown colour throughout , the manganese being laid d.own in concentric layers , which are evident from their enclosing lines of reel clay .
Nodules having a nucleus of pumice \Yhi.rh is surrounded by concenon board H.M.S. 'Challenger .
' 529 tric layers , the original nucleus being often very deeply impregnated by spider-like ramifications of i.he manganese , or nearly ihc whole pumice may be replaced by manganese .
" \Vhen pieces of bone have formed the nucleus we have much the same state of things .
The compact bone of the tympanics of cetaceans docs not , howeyer , appear to alter so rapidly as other bone ; and hence it may be that , rn get car-bones in such great numbers .
Sharks ' teeth of all sizes ( one was 4 inches across the base ) are frequent , and are sometimes surrounded by concentric layers of nearly an inch in thickness .
A siliceous sponge ( Fmnci ) , rns found imbcddccl in two inches .
A mass of red clay may occupy the centre of the nodule .
The nucleus is occasionally a mottled yellow-and-green substance , with agate bands in some parts , and Globige1\#183 ; inci , the carbonate of limo being replaced by silicate in these last .
This nucleus can be cut with a knife , like uew cheese , or it is hard and brittle , breaking with a conchoidal fracture .
Large flat aggregations occur which seem to hay been formed on hardened flat portions of the bottom .
The Globige , \#183 ; inci-shells and Radiolaria are at times covered by small specks of the manganese ; and in the former those are deposited in i.ho substance of the shell .
In several som1dings and dredgings to the south- , Yest of the Canaries we got Yery many large pieces of a branching Gorgonoid which were deeply coated and impregnated with manganese .
This was in a depth of from ll00 to 1575 fathoms .
In 670 fathoms , off the Desertas , the dead shells , pieces of coral , Polyzoa , \amp ; c. were all coated with a thin film of i.he peroxide of manganese ; and we hay had indications of the same thing in still shallower water .
In some of the Radiolarian oozes , and in other deposits , we have found the manganese more abundr.nt in i.he upper layers i.han in the lower , and vice ve1\#183 ; sa .
The following are the localities \#183 ; where we bay mot tho manganese in greatest quantities :Off the Canary Islands .

Abyssal Bhizopocls ( Ba !

The mm1ganese nodules , sharks ' teeth , \amp ; c. " hid1 we got m our 2Q:3 530 Mr. J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined deepest trawlings have very frequently small branching tubes , composed of clay and sanely particles , rnnning over their surfaces .
These belong to a Rhizopodal organism .
The sarcocle which fills these tubes contains many large brown pigment-cells , and small bioplasts are collected in clumps at distances along the length of the tube , or are scattered throughout it .
Tubes of a similar nature , but composed of pieces of Globige1\#183 ; ina , Racliolaria , \amp ; c. , , voulcl appear to be rather abundant on some of the oozes , and to run irregularly over the bottom .
In the clays we always get some arenaceous forms of Foraminifera when there has been a suecessful haul with the trawl .
Their shells are made up of pieces of manganese , clay , and small mineral particles , aml they contain the same kind of sarcodie substance as the tubes abore referred to .
An attached calcareous form ( c. f. Oarpente1\#183 ; ict ) has been found in rather deep water , and Biloculinas , Noclosarias , Triloculinas , and other forms have been frequently procured alive .
These last have orange-coloured pigment-cells , in which respect they resemble surface Rhizopods .
A living specimen of Orbulinct or Globigerinct undoubtedly from the botto !
n has not yet been met with .
In the early part of the cruise many attempts were made by all of tho naturalists to detect the presence of free protoplasm in or on the bottoms from our soundings and dredgings , but with no definite result .
It was undoubted , howeyer , that some specimens of the sea-bottom preserved in spirit assumed a Yery mobile or jelly-like aspect , and also that fl.occulent matter was often present .
1\Ir .
Buchanan determined that the flocculent matter was simply the amorphous sulphate of lime precipitated by spirit from the sea-water* .
Subsequently a number of experiments were made upon the behaviour o this amorphous precipitate when precipitated with different quantities of spirit and when treated with colouring-solutions .
The precipitate was also examined alone and mixed up with some of the ooze .
The ooze was examined at the same lime , and in the same manner , but without having been treated with spirit .
The results were shortly these : , Vhen sea- , -vater is treated with twice its volume of spirit or less , nearly the whole of the amorphous precipitate assumes the crystalline form in a short time .
\#183 ; when treated with a great excess of spirit the precipitate remains amorphous , and assumes a gelatinous aspect .
This gelatinous-like sulphate of lime colours with the carmine and iodine solutions , and " \#183 ; hen mixed with the ooze has , under the microscope , the appearances so minutely described by Jiac-kel .
The ooze washed with distilled water , or taken just as it comes up , and treated in the same manner with colouring-solution , does not * See Mt\#183 ; .

' 531 show these appearances .
The jelly-like aspect and tho maUer coloured with carmine can al\rnys be remoyed from the spiritpreserved specimens of the ooze by treating with distilled water .
In all cases the jelly-like or mobile aspect of the oozes is found to be due to the presence of the flocculent precipitate from the seawater associated with the ooze .
No free albuminous matter could be detected.1 When it is remembered that the original describers \Yorked with spiritpreserved specimens of the bottom , the inference seems fair that Bathybius and the amorphous sulphate of lime are identical , and that in placing it amongst liv:i11g things , the describers have committed an error .
ORIGIN OF DEEP-SEA CLAYS .
REL .
A.THE R.A.TE OF DEPOSITION OF DEPOSITS .
CONCLUSIOX .
The very wide distribution of pumice , yesicular laYa , or light scorirr has been already alluded to .
Some of the bottoms which have bee11 classed under the head of clays , as 2900 fathoms south of Tongatabn , are largely made up of pumice in a fine state of cliYision .
Pumice or Yesicular lavas have , in short , been found in all the kinds of deposits , most abundantly in the vicinity of volcanic islands and in the deep-sea clays .
It appears to be unirnrsally present , and its disintegration is most probably the chief source of the clayey matter found in oceanic deposits .
North of the Sandwich Islands we for scn\#183 ; ral clays got small pieces of pumice floating on the surface , most of the pieces being coyered \Yith a fungoid growth .
In this connexion it may be well to remember that Mr. Bates states somewhere that he found pumice rather common , floating on the surface of the Amazons , oyer a thousand miles from the nearest volcanic region .
l\Iany instances arc giYen by Sir Charles Lyell of volcanic ashes having been transported to great distances by the wind .
At Honolulu Mr. Green informed me that Pele 's hair had been picked np in his garden there after an irruption of Kclauca in Hawaii , a distance of about 180 miles from the crater .
I\#163 ; there be an ash after the carbonate 0\#163 ; lime is removed by carbonic acid or other agent , this will be another source of the clay .
Mr. Buchanan has determined in the clays the presence of copper , cobalt , and nickel , in addition io iron and manganese .
Remembering ~his , one is tempted to suggest the presence of meteoric or cosmic dust m these deposits .
When we have had a good haul from a red-clay bottom , " -hen the bag comes up foll of nodules , tympanic bones , and sbarkH ' teeth , '"c cannot resist the idea that we are dealing with things of a rnst ::mtiquil_r , and that we hay evidences of a very slowly accumulating deposit .
-\\.hen there has been no reason io suppose that the trawl has sunk more than one or two inches in tho clay , we hay Lall in tho b:ig oyc1\#183 ; a hundred sharks ' teeth and bcL\men thirty and forty car-bones of cetaerans : so ' !
'e 532 Mr. J. Murray on some Surface Organisms examined o these have been imbedded in over an inch of the manganese , arrangcc in concentric layers , while others have had just a trace of manganese 01 , them , or none at aJl .
We have every reason to suppose that the aggregation of the manganese around these relics is a very slow process , anc that consequently the occurrence of these deeply imbedded and recent t eeth and tympanics in the same surface-layers argues strongly in fayom of an exceedingly slow rate of deposition .
These vertebrate remains arE most abundant where the manganese abounds , but occur also in the red and grey clays , especia11y in those the furthest from the land , and wherE we may suppose the rate of deposition to be reduced to a minimum .
In the Globigerinct , Radiolarian , and Diatom oozes we have found during the whole cruise only one or two shark 's teeth and perhaps one tympanic bone .
In shore-deposits they were even more rare .
These facts , taken with others that will at once suggest themselves , go to show , as might be expected , that the shore-deposits accumulate faster than the organic oozes , and these last faster than the deep-sea clay .
The organisms in our Radiolarian ooze appear to resemble very closely and in their relative proportions those described from the Barbadoes earth .
ThosA described from the Oran deposit in Algeria are very like those in the blue muds taken along the course of the Japan stream .
The Globi , gei\#183 ; inaoozes which we get in shallow water resemble the chalk much more than those in deeper water , say over 1000 fathoms .
It is possible that deposits similar to those taking place in deep water , far away from the great continental anticlines , may never have been elevated into dry land .
In conclusion , large quantities of the various bottoms have been stored with a view to future work , and a large amount of material bearing on the subjects treated of in this Preliminary Report have been accumulated .
When these come to be carefully examined and compared , with the aid of appliances and conveniences not to be had on board ship , many of the statements herein made may require to be altered and amended , and other facts and relations , more curious 1.1.nd interesting than any hinted at , may be revealed .

Preliminary Report on some Surface Organisms and their relation to Ocean Deposits .
Throughout the cruise of the 'Challenger , ' and especially during the past two years , tow-nets have been dragged through the surface and deep waters of the sea on every possible occasion .
The contents of the nets , so far as known , have been carefully noted , and many hundreds of preparations have been made with the Yiew of illustrating the organisms occurring in different regions and at yarious depths .
Many new animals have been discovered , and many curious relations brouo-ht .

b b is not now possible to giYe any descriptions or to report fully with auy success or satisfaction on such an extended series of obserrntions .
on board H.M.S. 'Challenger .
' 533 A. .
few remarks on those organisms which have an interest in relation to the deposits taking place at the bottom of the se:t is all that will be attempted .
Soon after the arrival of the Expedition at home I hope to be able to give a more complete report on surface organisms .
Diatoms .
In the Southern Ocean , south 0\#163 ; Kerguelen , in the Arafura Sea , off the coasts of Japan , New Guinea , N orlh America , and in enclosed bays and river-deltas , in short , wherever tho specific gravity of the sea is low from an admixture 0\#163 ; fresh water , we have met with very muny Diatoms on the surface .
'raking the maps which J\Ir .
Buchanan has prepared , showing areus of low specific gr:wity , and comparing these with the records of the occurrence 0\#163 ; Diatoms in great abundance , it is significant how often thesA agree .
Again , excepting the are:i of tho Diatom-ooze , those places where Diatoms are abundant , and where iho specific gravity of the water is low , coincide generally with the areas where the blue muds are found , i. e. along the continents and great islands .
It may be stated generally that close to these shores we have in the surface-waters organisms more or less distinct from those occurring in the open sea .
Besides many forms 0\#163 ; Diatoms , the true Noctilucet , several Pe1\#183 ; iclinia , larvro of Annelids , and }follusca , Hydroid !
Iedusro are more or less characteristic of these shore waters .
In the Antarctic , in the Arafura Sea , at Hongkong , off J :ipan , and elsewhere the tow-nets were frequently filled with a yellow slime in a short time , whfoh consisted chiefly of Diatoms .
In the Southern Ocean , as has been stated , the Diatoms form a peculiar deposit .
In other deposits they are at times also well preserved , but occasionnJly are either completely masked by shore-debris or removed from the bottom .
In the open ocean , in the region marked out by the north edge of the N.E. trade-wind and the south of the S.E. trade , small forms of Diatoms clo not occur in any numbers .
They are represented , however , by three large species , which are undescribed so far as is known .
Mr ... Wild has figured two of these in Plate 21 .
These organisms have an exceedingly thin coating 0\#163 ; silica and are true Diatoms , though they have been confounded with Noctilucct .
The nuclei of both these forms are highly phosphorescent , and to them the diffused phosphorescence of the oceau within the tropics is generally due .
A third large Diatom has a cylindrical shape and a much thicker coat of silica , and is not phosphorescent .
These three forms are highly characteristic of the presence of tropical oceanic Yl ; aters .
The provisional generic name of I'yrocystis is proposed for the organisms figured in this PlnLC ' .
Coccosphel'es cmcl RhabdospheNs.- Those minute orgaui.nns , , Yhieh arc regarded as algm , have been found all over 1he ocean , except south of the latitude of Kerguelen and in some of tho enclosell seas .
Their remairn , , in the forms 0\#163 ; Coccoliths and Uhabcloliths , make up a ycry considerable portion of the bottom in some 0\#163 ; t.hc Glvbigerina-oozcs .
They are always 534 Mr. J , Murray on some Surface Organisms examined associated with the pelagic Foraminifera ; and when these are absent from the bottom so also are the Coccoliths and Rhabcloliths .
Pelagic ]{()rct1ninife1Yt.-All the observations which have been or may yet be made upon these animals will be collected at the encl of our cruise , and published with those which have been made by Professor vVyville Thomson .
It is here proposed to record shortly those results which it is belieYed have already been attained .
Calcareous Foraminifera have been found in the surface-waters of all the oceans and seas we have visited , excepting the Arafura and Japan inland seas .
In the tropics they are most abundant , both as to species and numbers , nncl are more numerous in the open ocean than near land .
Our tow-nets have perhaps in no single instance been dragged down to 200 fathoms without yielding some forms .
At times they occur in vast numbers on the surface , and with a bottle can be picked up from a boat .
In one specimen thus procured the sarcode of the animal was found thrown out into bubble-like extensions between the spines of the shell , and oYer these expansions of the sarcode and along the spines the pseudopodia moved freely and rapidly .
Mr. Wild has figured this specimen in Plates 22 and 23 , and Professor W yville Thomson proposes to describe it under the generic name of IIcistigerinct .
This is the only instance in which we have seen one of these creatures fu1ly expanded ; however , those taken in the net can , when the ship is steady , be got to expand partially .
Almost always when they come up in the net the sarcocle is found to adhere to and surround closely the outside of the shell , so much so that the pigment-cells and oil-globules obscure the shell , especially in the Pulvinulinas .
Those species without spines apparently throw out bubble-like expansions of the sarcode in 1he same manner as Hastigerina .
They haYe , however , been seen only partially extended .
The sarcode matter of these organisms includes very many orangecoloured pigment-cells and oil-globules , the shape and size of these yarying with the species .
The sarcode has also many small bioplnsts scattered through it , which quickly colour , Yith carmine .
These are generally found congregated in the smaller chambers of the shell when the a11imal is at rest .
About a dozen species of these organisms ham been found on the surface ; some are more or less tropical , others extend into the region of the westerly winds north and south , and one species is found in the Antarctic Ocean .
The shell of the species represented in the Plate has been obsened only once from the bottom , and then only in a broken state .
This is to be accounted for by the fact that the shell is exceedingly thin , delicate , and fragile .
The specimens of these Foraminifera taken in the surface-net are of on board H.M.S. 'Challenger .
' 535 nil sizes , from the smallest ones to those which have been desrribed with an exogenous growth .
Species only occur on the bottom in those places where they are found on the surface .
These organisms are found in rnst numbers on the surface over regions where there are only a few traces of them .
or their broken parts on the bottom .
No liYing specimen of a Globigerina , an Orbidinct , a Pulviniilina , or of the new genera found on the surface , which undoubtedly came from .
the bottom , bas yet been met with .
The foregoing observations appear to justify the opinion that these organisms live only in the surface and subsurface waters of the ocean .
The most potent agent concerned in the removal of these shells from the majority of the deep-sea deposits is very likely that suggested by Professor Wyville Thomson , viz. carbonic acid ; yet t , here may be others .
Why these shells should be almost entirely absent in some places at a depth of 2000 fathoms , and be abundant in some other few places at a depth of 2900 fathoms , has still to be explained .
The to"\#183 ; -net seemed to show that they were as numerous in the surface-waters of the ono region as of the other .
Two varieties of large cells are occasionally noticed in the pelagic Foraminifera , not unlike the reproductive cells which have been described as occurring in some Infusoria .
Racliolaria.-Radiolaria polyzoa , Acanthometrre , or Polycystinro occur almost universally in the surface-waters of the ocean .
As has been stated , they ( in a few places in the Western , Northern , and Middle Pacific ) make up a large or principal part of the deposits at the bottom .
In very many places they appear to be nearly or quite absent in the bottoms .
In some Globigerinct-oozes they are present in considerable numbers , in others they cannot be detected .
What agents are concerned in the rem.oval of these organisms is at this time a matter of conjecture .
Deep-Sect Rhizopods .
In April 1875 a plan of sending dmm tow-nets to a great depth was adopted .
These were either attached to the dredge and trawl-lines , or sent down separately to a depth of 2000 fathoms or more .
This method has been repeatedly practised since , and with these results .
On every occasion organisms were found in the deep nets which had not hitherto , nor have since , been observed in the nets used near the surface .
These appear to have a wide distribution , as the same forms have been taken in the deep nets in the N ortb , Middle , and South Pacific , whilst the surface organisms have varied in these regions to a considerable extent .
These organisms are :Many small crustaceans , usually of a bright orange-colour-Copepncls , Amphipocls , and Cypriclinas principally .
Many large-sized Radiolaria , resembling in most respects those forms described by Hiickel under the generic name of Galoclenclrum , 536 Mr. J. Murray on some Surface Organisms examined Many other Rhizopods , with more or less flask-shaped or bivalrnd siliceous shells , which aro undescribed , so far as is known .
Mr. Wild has figul'ed six of these last in Plate 24 ; for the sake of convenience we Jrn , ve been accustomed to call the organisms Challengericlro .
This provisional name will be retained if it be found that these organismo are new to science and universally distributed in deep water .
The shells of all have an exceedingly beautiful tracery , a fenestrated appearance often , which was at first supposed to be clue to perforations of the shell , but which a closer examination shows to be caused by pitlike depressions .
Some have only one , others have several openings through which the sarcode flows .
The sarcocle of all these deep-sea Rhizopods has many large bbck-brown pigment-cells .
Small bioplasts are scattered through the sarcode .
These collect into capsular-like clumps when the animal is at rest , and are quickly coloured by carmine .
At times these Challengeridre come up with a good deal of the sarcocle outside of the shell ; and two specimens have been seen to throw out elongated pseudopodia .
I should think that not less than fifty species of these organisms ham been taken in the deep nets already .
They all resemble more or less those forms drawn by Mr. \#183 ; wild .
It will be interesting to learn if future investigations will show these organisms to be present in the deep waters of the Atlantic as " \#183 ; ell as the Pacific .
In the Radiolarian oozes the remains of these Challengeridre make up a considerable portion _of the deposit , and in some other deposits of tho North-west Pacific they are well preserved .
In the majority of bottoms , however , they appear to be quite absent .
Pteropocls , Hete1\#183 ; opocls , Pelagic Gasteropocls.-Species of these orders occur everywhere in the surface-waters of the ocean .
Their shells make up a large portion of some deposits in shallow water , where there is relatively little land-debris .
In depths less than 1500 fathoms they abound ; deeper than this th0y become more and more rare .
At 2000 fathoms and deeper the only trace of these shells in the deposits is an occasional Diacrici or Iantltina of a large size .
Those shells which are thin and delicate , as Atlanta , Oarinaria , and Styliola , disappear first from the bottoms .
GENERAL REMARKS .
Everywhere we have found life abundant in the surface and subsurface waters of the ocean .
If living creatures are small in number on the surface , the tm7-net will usually yield many forms if dragged at a depth of 100 fathoms or more .
" \Ve have not met with any really barren regions .
Onr observations appear to show that there are several regions of the surface of the ocean , each of which is characterized by a number of peculiar organisms :on boa1\#183 ; d H.M.S. 'Challenge1\#183 ; .
' 537 1 .
A region roughly marked out by the northern edge of tho N.E. , rade-wind and the southern edge of the S.E. tmcle-wincl .
2 .
A region lying along the coasts of great islands and continents , where we haYe usually a mixture of fresh and salt water .
3 .
A region in the Southern and Antarctic Oceans south of tho latitude of 50 ' S. In all depths less than 1500 fathoms there would seem to be a direct relation between the organisms occurring on 1.hc surface and ihe deposits taking place on the bottom .
Where , ,.e have Diatoms on the surface , there we haYe their frustules on the bottom .
" \Vhere we have GlobiJel'inci and Pteropods \amp ; c. on the surface , there also we get their dead , hells or broken parts of them ; and so also for the Racliolaria , Coccospheres , and other organisms .
In some areas within the depths referred to we occasiona1ly do not find ihe remains of some of the surface organisms so numerous as we should expect .
In these cases , howeYer , I suspect they are rather masked or obscured by an abundance of : : ; hore debris than remoyed from the deposit .
\#183 ; when we consider the specimens of the bottom from depths greater than 1500 fathoms , the relation is by no means so constant .
IL still holds good that when pelagic :Foraminifera , PteropodR , Diatoms , Radiolaria , or Coccoliths are found on these bottoms , the same Yarietics of each of these are found on the surface ; but perhaps in the majority of bottoms , in depths greater than 1500 fathoms , the exuYire of some or all of the organisms found on the surface are partially or wholly absent .
When these haYe been carefully reexamined , the results tabulated and compared with other obserrntions recorded at the same place , it is likely some light will be thrown upon the subject .

Preliminary Report on Vertebrates .
Of the Vertebrate animals collected during the cruise , the chief interest is very naturally attached to those fishes on which our special investigations might be expected to give some information .
]\Jany specimens have been taken in our trawlings and dredgings .
Other than the British Museum Catalogue , we have with us no literature on this subject .
]\fany of the specimens which we regard as new\#183 ; may be described , and somo of those which are believed to be identical with described species may tum out to be distinct ; therefore for the present it is considered best to girn a list of the fishes , with the determinations which were made at the time of their occurrence , and not to cumber this RqJort " \#183 ; ith descriptions .
Besides the fishes taken in the trawl and dredge , many small larrnl and adult forms have been obtained in the io\\"-nf't , ; .
These last have chiefly been preserved as microscopic preparation ; .
In cycry case notes have been taken at the time ihe spocimcm ; 1nTc procured , and all ha , c been labelled and preserved with great care .
538 Mr. J. Murray on Vertebrates collected In the following List the depths to which the trawl had been dow1 are given .
Of course it is not asserted that the specimens came from these depth : ; ; ; indeed we know that many of the Sternoptychidm and Scopeliclm are surface creatures .
It will be seen from the list that all the fishes taken in the trawl 01 dredge have been relegated to known families .
The definitions of som( families will require to be altered in order to admit some of the ne " forms ; but it is not thought that a new family will require to be established .
There are many new genera and species .
The list includes the dredg .
ings in all the depths greater than 100 fathoms .
I\#163 ; we had given only the trawlings in depths greater than 500 fathoms , all the shore fonm which appear in the list would have been eliminated .
Our dredgings and trawlings in less than 100 fathoms do not once give a specimen of the species so characteristic of the hauls in deep water .
The deep-sea and oceanic forms belong to very few families .
Stemoptychiclce .
These occur at 40 stations , and over a hundred specimens baYc been taken .
Besides those from the trawl , small species have continually been taken in the nets in warm regions .
South of the latitude of 50 ' S. we did not get a single species of this family .
Many of the pelagic species occur both in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , i. e. identical species .
Mctcruriclce occur at 24 stations , and about one hundred specimens have been taken .
They have been met with in all latitudes , and most frequently in depths between 200 and 1000 fathoms .
In this family we have many species which cannot be referred to existing genera .
These fishes were almost always blo , vn out and at times even burst when taken from the bag of the trawl .
Some of the species appear to be universally distributed .
Ophicliiclce occur at 18 stations , and 20 specimens have been taken .
These fishes would seem to inhabit deeper water than the Macrurids , as they have in most cases been present in the t.rawl when it bas been down to depths greater than 1000 fathoms .
All of them appear to be undescribed , excepting Bythites fuscits ( ?
) .
One specimen is quite blind ; in another , which is semitransparent , the eyes are represented by small black dots .
These fishes are apparently universally distributed .
Scopeliclce occur 24 times , and_ 41 specimens have been taken .
Many of these are truly pelagic fishes , while others haYe characters which mark them by H.M.S. 'Challenger .
' 539 out as deep-sea .
The majority of the forms cannot be referred to existing grnera or species .
Perhaps the most curious fish which we have obtained belong to this family .
Two or three species have the upper rays of the pectoral fins greatly elongated , these rays being much longer than the fish in some cases .
These rays arch over the head , and when erected simulate in a wonderful way Umbellnlarias , Virgularias , or Crinoids .
Another species has a large white ( phosphorescent ?
) organ situated on the head between the eyes .
These fishes have occurred in all regions , and when the trawl has been down to depths varying from 255 to 2385 fathoms .
Stomiatidce occur at 13 stations , and 15 specimens have been taken .
These haYe been present only when the trawl has been clown in deep water , and all have more or less deep-sea characters .
There are two or three new generic forms , and new specimens of Malacosteus and Echiostonrn have been secured .
Pediculati occur at 7 stations , and 7 specimens havo been taken .
A Ohctunax from 360 fathoms at the Fijis appears to be identical with that described from the sea off Madeira as Ohaimctx pictus .
The other fishes of this family all belong to the same little group with l , Ielcmocitus , One1\#183 ; oicles , and Oemtias .
One , which I propose to describe under the name of Oei-cttias itmnoscopus , came up from 2400 fathoms in the North Atlantic , the only living thing in the dredge on this occasion .
Halosauriclce .
Ilctlosetu1\#183 ; us Owenii occurs at 5 stations , and 5 specimens have been taken .
These seem all to be referable to the described species , and occur both in the Atlantic and Pacific .
Notocctnthi .
One specimen was taken off the coast of Japan .
It is a new species .
Munenidce occur at 10 stations , and 20 specimens have been taken .
This family in our deep-water hauls is represented by Nwiichthys and Synaplwbl'(tnclrns .
The .1Yemichthys in the Atlantic is identical with the one described ( scolopcicect ) .
One taken in the Pacific is generically distinct .
All the specimens of Synaphob1\#183 ; anchus can , I think , be referred to the species described ( pinnatus ) .
They have occurred widely boLh in the Atlantic and Pacific , and generally with the l\Iaerurids .
Trctchiniclce .
A species referable to the genus Ohccnichthys , but with deep-sea characters , occurred in one of the deep hauls in the Southern Ocean .
540 Mr. J. ~urray on Vertebrates collected Only one small specimen of the Sphyrrenida:i and one of the Trichuridro have been taken duripg the cruise .
, Ve haYe while at sea captured only two species of sharks .
One occurs widely distributed in the Atlantic and Pacific ; the other was taken off the coast of Japan .
" \Vhenever the ship has been at anchor , and wherever possible , collections have been made of Fishes , Amphibians , Reptiles , Birds , and Mammals .
Collectively these now form a large collection . .
They have been preserved as skins , spirit specimens , and skeletons , and all with a view to future work .
In the former three classes we have met with a good many new species .
In Birds we may have some new species .
In Mammals it is not likely we have any new species except amongst the Cheiroptcra .
Of the Petrels and Penguins \Ve have very extensive collections , both as skins and spirit , chromic acid , and other preparations .
Two or three skeletous of very large specimens of the Sea-Elephant have been preserved , and many specimens of the Southern Seals .

a Preliminary Report to Professor WYVILLE THOMSON , F.R.S. , Director of the Civilian Scientific Staff , on the true Corals dredged by H.M.S. 'Challenger ' in deep water between the dates Dec. 30th , 1870 , and August 31st , 1875 .
" By H. N. MosELEY , Naturalist to the Expedition .
( Published by permission of the Lords of the Admiralty .
) Received February 14 , 1876 .
Read March 16 .
The following Report is to be r egarded as merely preliminary , and will be followed by a full account of the corals dredged by the ' Challenger , ' which can be prepared only after the termination of the present voyage .
Many specimens have been sent home for greater security , and are thus not available for comparison .
Moreover , in the case of corals , it is impossible to determine , with any accuracy , specific relations without making comparisons with museum collections , which , of course , bas been impossible in the present instance .
The list of corals obtained h ere given has been made as accurate as circumstances would p ermit .
The amount of corals obtain ed by the 'Challenger ' in deep water has been small , considering the very .
large number of dreclgings which have been made .
Corals have been yielded by on lie a.bout forty .
: eight of the npmerous dred gi11gs and t.rawlings .
