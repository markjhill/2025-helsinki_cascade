" On Combustion in Rarefied Air .
" By Dr. EDWARD FRANKLAND , F.R.S. Received February 28 , 1861 .
In the autumn of 1859 , whilst accompanying Dr. Tyndall to the suminit of Mont Blanc , I undertook at his request some experiments on the effect of atmospheric pressure upon the amount of combustible matter consumed by a common candle .
I found that , taking the average of five experiments , a stearin candle diminished in weight 9'4 grammes when burnt for an hour at Chamounix ; whilst its ignition for the same length of time on the summit of Mont Blanc , perfectly protected from currents of air , reduced its weight to the extent of 9'2 grammes .
This close approximation to the former number under such a widely different atmospheric pressure , ; goes far to prove that the rate of combustion is entirely independent of the density of the atmosphere .
It is impossible to repeat these determinations in a satisfactory manner with artificially rarefied atmospheres , owing to the heating of the apparatus which surrounds the candle , and the consequent guttering and unequal combustion of the latter ; but an experiment in which a sperm candle was burnt first in air under a pressure of 28'7 inches of mercury , and then in air at 9 inches pressure , other conditions being as similar as possible in the two experiments , the consumption of sperm was found to be , At pressure of 28'7 inches 7'85 grrns .
of sperm per hour , , , 9'0 , , 9'10 , , , , thus confirming , for higher degrees of rarefaction , the result previously obtained .
In burning the candles upon the summit of Mont Blanc , I was much struck by the comparatively small amount of light which they emitted .
The lower and blue portion of the flame , which under ordinary circumstances scarcely rises to within a quarter of an inch of the apex of the wick , now extended to the height of -th of an inch above the cotton , thus greatly reducing the size of the luminous portion of the flame .
On returning to England , I repeated the experiments under circumstances which enabled me to ascertain , by photometrical measurements , the extent of this loss of illuminating effect in rarefied air .
The results prove that a great reduction in the illuminating power of a candle ensues when the candle is transferred from air at the ordinary atmospheric pressure to rarefied air .
It was , however , found that , owing to the circumstances mentioned above , no satisfactory quantitative experiments could be made with candles in artificially rarefied air , and recourse was therefore had to coal-gas , which , although also liable to certain disturbing influences , yet yielded results , during an extensive series of experiments , exhibiting sufficient uniformity to render them worthy of confidence .
The gas was in all cases passed through a governor to secure uniformity of pressure in the delivery tubes .
A single jet of gas was employed as the standard of comparison , and this was fixed at one end of a Bunsen 's photometer , whilst the flame to be submitted to various pressures , and which I will call the experimental flame , was placed at the other .
The experimental flame was made to burn a uniform amount of gas , viz. 0'65 cubic foot per hour in all the experiments .
The products of combustion were completely removed , so that the experimental flame , which burnt with perfect steadiness , was always surrounded with pure air , the supply of which was , however , so regulated as to secure a maximum of illuminating effect in each observation .
In all the following series of experiments , the illuminating power given under each pressure is the average of twenty observations , which accord with each other very closely .
In each series , the maximum illuminating effect , that is the light given by the experimental flame when burning under the full atmospheric pressure , is assumed to be 100 .
The following is a summary of the results 1st Series .

In order to attain greater delicacy in the pressure readings in these experiments , a water-gauge was used , but its indications are translated into inches of mercury in the following tabulated results , each of which represents , as before , the average of twenty observations .

30-2 100 ' 29-2 95'0 28-2 89'7 27-2 84-4 It is thus evident that the combustion of an amount of gas which would give a light equal to 100 candles when the barometer stands at 31 inches , would give a light equal to only 84'4 candles if the barometer fell to 28 inches .
An inspection of all the above results shows that the rarefaction of air , from atmospheric pressure downwards , produces a uniformly diminishing illuminating power until the pressure is reduced to about 14 inches of mercury , below which the diminution of light proceeds at a less rapid rate .
The above determinations give approximately 5'1 per cent. as the mean reduction of light for each diminution of 1 inch of mercurial pressure down to 14 inches .
The following Table exhibits the actually observed light , compared with that calculated from this constant .
