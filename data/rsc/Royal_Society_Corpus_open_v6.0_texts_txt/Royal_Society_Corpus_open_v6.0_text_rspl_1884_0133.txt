344 Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observations .
[ May 7 , Philosophy in the University of Glasgow , who also assisted me in th detemination of the rigidity modulus ; they are as follows:_ Young 's Modulus , ( PZ/ ae where P is the stretching weight , l the length of wire used , a the cross sectional area , and e the elongation produced by the pull P ) 1222 4 x 10\#174 ; grammes weight per square ' centimetre .
The breaking weight is about 6'029 x 10\#174 ; grammes per square centimetre .
I have also determined the specific gravity of a specimen of platinoid wire , and find it to be 8*78 , compared with water at 20 ' 0 .
Platinoid when drawn hard , is softened like copper by heating and sudden cooling .
