" Considerations on the Laws of Life , in reference to the Origin of Disease , " by Adair Crawford , M.D. Communicated by T. J. Pettigrew , Esq. F.R.S. The scope of this paper is to show the insufficiency of all theories which attempt to account for the phenomena of the living body , either in health or disease , by an exclusive reference either to the solids or to the fluids which enter into its composition ; or to the influence of an abstract and unknown principle of life ; or to that of physical or chemical agents ; or to the functions of the nervous , or of the vascular systems .
For the establishment of the sciences of physiology and pathology upon the most solid foundations , the author is of opi ?
nion that all the circumstances above mentioned should be duly taken into account , and allowed their respective and proportionate degree ofinfluence .
