A paper was also read , entitled , " Further Particulars of the Fall of the Cold Bokkeveld Meteorite ; " by Thomas Maclear , Esq. , F.R.S. , in a letter to Sir John F. W. Herschel , Bart. , K.H. , V.P.R.S. , &amp;c. communicated by Sir John Herschel .
This communication , which is supplementary to the one already made to the Society by Mr. Maclear , contains reports , supported by affidavits , of the circumstances attending the fall of a meteoric mass in a valley near the Cape of Good Hope .
The attention of the witnesses had been excited by a loud explosion which took place in the air , previous to the descent of the aerolite , and which was at ?
tended by a blue stream of smoke , extending from north to west .
Some of the fragments which had been seen to fall , and which had penetrated into the earth , were picked up by the witnesses .
One of them falling on grass caused it to smoke ; and was too hot to ad ?
mit of being touched .
The mass which was sent to England by H.M.S. Scout , weighed , when first picked up , four pounds .
The paper is accompanied by a map of the district , showing the course of the aerolite .
