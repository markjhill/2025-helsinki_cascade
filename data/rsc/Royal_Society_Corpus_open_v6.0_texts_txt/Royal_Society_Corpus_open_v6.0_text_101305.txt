A Note About the small Empty Tubes , formerly described .
I have made shift to shuffle up for the Carrier the Patterns of our Optical Aids .
I had gotten the Tubes in Beaver , but they proved so slippery , that the Spectacle-bones would not hold them .
When those , which I send to you , are blackt with Ink , they will become stiffer and rougher , and hold firmer in any posture , as your occasion requires .
At the first they should be drawn in the bone within the third part of an inch of the very top ; and then , as by use you find them more agreeable .
I did redouble it upon you , that the greatest discouragement would arise from the difficulty of using them at first ; and that I could not expect , that any Man would have the patience to learn the right use of them , except he were constrained by necessity ; and that my self , though I was filled with joy enough at the first discovery , could not endure the trouble above two hours at a time : But by the practise of a week or a fortnight , I found them an ease and pleasure to me for twelve at least of each 24 hours .
And by all the trials , which I have yet made upon others , whether pore-blind , or of faint-sight decayed by Age , or however weakened , it proves a very great aid .
For the poreblind , they must be made shorter : For the decayed by age , they may be longer .
