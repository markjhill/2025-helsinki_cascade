An Account of two Monstrous Births , not long since produced in Devonshire ; communicated by M. Colepresse .
1 .
One Robert Cloak a Joiner ( whom I know ) of Clamick in the Parish of Beer-Ferris in Devonshire , had on Febr. 24 .
last , a Monstrous black Ram-Lamb fallen with one Head , but two distinct Bodies , with eight Legs ; which Bodies were joined in the Neck : It had two Eyes , and as many Ears , in the usual places ; and one extraordinary Eye in the Niddock , with one single Ear , about an inch distant from the Eye backwards : Its Dame , which was White , usually brought forth two Lambs every year , as she did this year also a White one , which with the Ewe remains alive .
But whether this Monster was produced dead or alive , is not known , it being found dead by the hedge , and soon after put into the Earth .
There were ten White Ews accompanied with three White Rams .
2 .
One John Cauce , Servant to Mr. William Knighton of Lockridge , likewise in Beer Ferris ; had among his Sheep , on the seventeenth of Febr. last , a White Lamb fallen on a Common in the said Parish , with two distinct heads and Necks , Joined at the shoulders , but one only Body , and that well formed , yet having double entrails in all respects .
The Ewe remains well .
The Monster dyed , and is now in my Custody , after it hath been dried in an Oven , and By the Sun .
