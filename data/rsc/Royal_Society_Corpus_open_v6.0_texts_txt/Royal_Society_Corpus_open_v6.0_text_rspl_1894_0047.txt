Report of the Incorporated Kew Committee for the Year ending December 31 , 1893 .
The operations of The Kew Observatory , in the Old Deer Park , Richmond , Surrey , are controlled by the Incorporated Kew Committee , which is constituted as follows :\#151 ; Mr. F. Galton , Chairman .
Captain W. de W. Abney , C.B. , R.E. * Prof. W. G. Adams .
Captain E. W. Creak , R.N. Prof. G. C. Foster .
Admiral Sir G. H. Richards , K.C.B. The Earl of Rosse , K.P. Prof. A. W. Rucker .
Mr. R. H. Scott .
Lieutenant-General R. Strachey , C.S.I. General J. T. Walker , C.B. Captain W. J. L. Wharton , R.N. On February 9 the Kew Committee became registered under the Companies Acts , 1862 and 1867 , as the " Incorporated Kew Committee of the Royal Society .
" The Memorandum and Articles of Association are given in Appendix A. It is with deep regret that the Committee have to report the decease of the late Superintendent of the Observatory , Mr. G. M. Whipple , B.Sc. , which occurred on the 8th of February , after a serious illness of more than seven months .
He had been connected with the Observatory in various capacities for thirty-four years , and had filled the office of Superintendent since 1876 .
Under his efficient management the work at the Observatory had been largely augmented in amount and variety , and the funds at its disposal for purchase of apparatus and extension of its premises had steadily increased .
Mr. Whipple was the author of numerous papers on Meteorological and other subjects connected with the work of the Observatory , which appeared in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society , ' the ' Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society , ' and other scientific publications .
Report of the Kew Committee .
During the year there also occurred the death of Mr. H. McLaugh .
lin , Librarian and Accountant , whose connexion with the Observatoi*y had extended over twenty years .
The Committee having invited applications for the vacant post o !
Superintendent , selected from amongst the candidates Mr. Charles Chree , M.A. , Fellow of King 's College , Cambridge , Sixth Wrangler 1883 , First Division Part III of the Mathematical Tripos , and First Class in Part II of the Natural Sciences Tripos , 1884 .
Mr. Chree entered on his duties on May 15 .
During the earlier part of the year the work of the Observatory was carried out by Mr. Baker , the Chief Assistant , to the entire satisfaction of the Committee .
They desire that his services should be specially recorded , and they are glad to state that the routine , work of the Observatory has in no way suffered owing to the en\#171 ; forced absence of the Superintendent for the early months of the past year .

L Magnetic Observations .
The magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout the year , and the scale values of all the instruments were determined " in January .
The ordinates of the various photographic curves were then found , to be as follows :\#151 ; Declinometer : 1 inch = 0 ' 22*04 .

309 a new one was obtained from Adie , London , and fitted to the cylinder on July 5 .
On August 10 the clock was dismounted and cleaned As regards Magnetic Disturbances , no very large movements have been registered during the year .
The principal oscillations that were recorded took place on the following days:\#151 ; February 4\#151 ; 5 , March 14\#151 ; 15 , April 26 , June 18\#151 ; 19 , July 16 , August 6\#151 ; 7 and 18 , November 1\#151 ; 2 .
The hourly means and diurnal range of the magnetic elements for 1893 , for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer Royal , will be found in Appendix I. The following are the mean results for the entire year:\#151 ; Mean Westerly Declination ... ... ... 17 ' 28''8 Mean Horizontal Force ... ... ... ... .

Mean Inclination ... ... ... ... ... . .
67 ' 26'*3 Mean Vertical Force ... ... ... ... . .
0'43896 C.G.S. units .
The observations of Horizoutal Force , Inclination , and Declination with the absolute instruments have been made in accordance with the usual practice .
Captain Schiick visited the Observatory in July , and made a series of absolute magnetic observations in order to compare his own instruments with those of Kew , prior to his continuing his magnetic survey on the banks of the Elbe .
The temperature coefficients of the magnets employed by Captain Schuck were determined at Kew .
The magnetic instruments have been studied and a knowledge of their manipulation obtained by Lieutenants Parry and Tancred , of the Royal Navy , who visited the Observatory from December 4 to December 20 .
II .
Meteorological Observations .
The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of Atmospheric Pressure , Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb , Wind ( direction and velocity ) , Bright Sunshine , and Rain , have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year , and the standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records duly registered .
The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly made , and these , as well as copies of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine , have been transmitted , as usual , to the Meteorological Office .
311 ) ; Report of the K Committee .
A summary of the results for the year is given in Appendix 11 , = Tables I , II , and III .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , data have been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the Institute of Mining Engineers , the editor of 'Symons 's Monthly Meteorological Magazine , ' Dr. Rowland , and others .
Detailed information of thunderstorms observed in the neighbourhood during the year has been forwarded to the Royal Meteorological Society .
Anemograph.\#151 ; The " worm " on the direction fan-spindle had become very thin through wear , causing considerable " hack-lash ; " a new one has been put , in hand by Munro , and will be fitted up at an early date .
The new square-headed pricker , mentioned in the last Report , has been rather unsatisfactory in its action , and will be shortly replaced by a round one , made of specially hardened stpel .
Rain-gauge.\#151 ; The Willesden prepared papers have been in daily use on the self-recording Beckley gauge , and although the curves obtained are clear and distinct , yet the defect of the lengthening of the sheets in wet weather has not been entirely overcome .
Circular letters were sent to several prominent paper makers asking for samples of material , specially prepared , to be used in a very damp atmosphere ; but of those thus obtained , only one sample ( supplied by Messrs. Waterlow and Sons ) showed no appreciable lengthening in the dampest atmosphere producible artificially .
It has , however , some counterbalancing defects , which render its superiority to the Willesden paper for the purpose in view somewhat doubtful .
Barograph.\#151 ; At the request of the Meteorological Office an investigation has been carried out as to the causes of fluctuations that present themselves in the value of the residual correction to the barograph readings , which is deduced by comparison of simultaneous readings of the barograph and a standard barometer .
An analysis was made of the value of the residual correction between May , 1892 , and October , 1893 , while numerous measurements were taken of the width of the temperature compensation to the barogram at different temperatures .
The data obtained accounted , for a very considerable part , at least , of the irregularities observed ills the residual correction .
A report embodying an analysis of the results has been sent to the Meteorological Office . .
'Electrograph.\#151 ; This instrument has been in regular action during the year , but its performance on the whole has been rather unsatis*| factory .
Early in the year the needle-suspension being accidentally broken , another was fitted without delay , and a new determinations an Report of the Kew Committee .
made of the scale value .
Subsequent re-determinations were carried out in May , July , and November .
It is intended to take advantage of the first spell of frosty weather to dismount and thoroughly overhaul the instrument , and to open out the scale , which has for some time past been too contracted .
Inspections.\#151 ; In compliance with the request of the Meteorological Council , Mr. Baker visited and inspected the Observatories at Stony-hurst , Glasgow , Fort William , and Aberdeen , and the Anemograph Stations at Yarmouth , North Shields , Alnwick Castle , Deerness ( Orkney ) , Fleetwood , and Holyhead ; while Mr. Constable inspected the Observatories at Oxford and Falmouth .
III .
Solar Observations .
Sun-spots.\#151 ; Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 155 days , and the groups numbered , after Schwabe 's method .
Particulars will be found in Appendix II , Table IV .
The marked exhibition of solar activity noted in last report has continued , and although no phenomenally large group of Sun-spots has appeared , yet no one observation has been recorded in which the Sun 's surface was entirely free from spots .
Time Signals.\#151 ; These have been regularly received from Greenwich through the G.P.O. , with the exception of a few days , on which occasions supplementary signal^ were transmitted at later hours .
IY .
Experimental Work .
Richard 's Anemo-cinemograph.\#151 ; This ' instrument , which has been at the Observatory since May , 1891 , was at the end of the year returned to Mr. Casella , by request of the makers .
Cloud Photographs.\#151 ; Operations connected with cloud photography have been suspended during the past year .
Fog and Mist.\#151 ; The observation of a series of distant objects referred to in the last report has been continued ; ' A note is taken of the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each observation hour .
An analysis of the results for the period May , 1892 , to December , 1893 , is at present being carried out .
During the thickest fog experienced in the past year , at one of the hours of observation the most distant object visible was only 12 feet off .

18 Report of the Kew Committee .
S Standard Thermometers have been supplied during the year .
There were at the end of the year in the Observatory undergoing verification , 6 Barometers , 571 Thermometers , 18 Sextants , 45 Telescopes , and a Sunshine Recorder .
VI .
Rating of Watches and Chronometers .
A large increase has taken place in the number of watches sent for trial during the year , 1,521 having been received , as compared with 1,044 during the previous twelve months .
This increase , however , has been largely in watches entered for the class B test , and for various reasons a future falling off in the number of such watches is not unlikely .
It is a gratifying fact that the number of high-class movements attaining the distinction especially good has been greater than in any previous year .
The watches were entered for trial as below :\#151 ; For class A , 376 ; class B , 885 ; class C , 251 ; and 9 for the subsidiary trial .
Of these 5 passed the subsidiary test , 299 failed from various causes to gain any certificate ; 238 were awarded class C certificates , 722 class B , and 257 class A ; of the latter , 34 obtained the highest form of certificate , class A , especially good .
In Appendix III will be found a table giving the results of trial of the 34 watches which gained the highest number of marks during the year .
The first place was taken by Messrs. Stauffer , Son , and Go .
, London , with a keyless , going-barrel , chronometer- watch , No. 147,625 , with the " tourbillon " escapement , which obtained 88'0 marks out of a maximum of 100 .
The best performance of lever watches during the year was that of No. 33,884 by Jos .
White and Son , Coventry , which gained 84'9 marks .
Non-Magnetic Watches.\#151 ; Twelve watches thus designated have been examined during the year , both as to their ordinary time-keeping and also as to their non-magnetic properties , and although the trial to which they are submitted is severe\#151 ; the movement being tested in an intense magnetic field , both in vertical and horizontal positions , and gradually approached to and removed from the poles , whilst its behaviour is critically watched\#151 ; in the majority of cases the watches were found to perform very satisfactorily .
Marine Chronometers.\#151 ; The Committee having been requested by the Naval Attache to the Royal Italian Embassy to undertake trials for Marine chronometers on the Greenwich plan , Mr. Constable visited the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , by kind permission of the Astronomer Royal , and was afforded every facility to make himself 314 Report of the Kew .
familiar with the system of rating chronometers carried on there for many years past .
The Greenwich trial lasts for twenty-nine weeks , the movements being tried during alternate periods of seven and four weeks at the ordinary temperature of the air , and in a hot room at temperatures of from about 75 ' to 100 ' Fahr. This gives a total of twenty-one weeks at atmospheric temperatures and eight weeks in the oven .
The difference , in seconds , between the greatest and least weekly rates of a chronometer during the trial being denoted by a , and the greatest difference , in seconds , between the rates of two successive weeks by b , the smallness of the quantity + 26 has been adopted at Greenwich as the measure of the excellence of a chronometer .
At the request of the Italian Naval Attache the test at Kew was to be directed to ascertain in which of the chronometers sent for trial the value of a + 26 did not exceed 38 .
It was decided to utilise for the trial the Pendulum Chamber in the basement and the North room in the new wing .
The former is constructed of wood , double walled , with a 6-inch air space all round , and having been originally designed with , a view to reducing temperature variations to a minimum , it was admirably suited for conversion into a hot chamber .
A gas furnace , made of copper to avoid the risk of disturbing the magnetographs , was specially built by Messrs. Fletcher , Russell , and Co. , of Warrington .
It has given entire satisfaction , being perfectly under control , so that any desired temperature up to 100 ' Fahr. can be reached and regularly maintained .
By means of two copper flues the products of combustion are taken into the outer air , and the atmosphere of the hot chamber is at all times pure and free from fumes , while the presence of several open vessels of water prevents undue desiccation .
The North room referred to above is used for the ordinary temperature tests , and in it temperatures as low as 37 ' Fahr. have been observed .
In addition to- the ordinary maximum and minimum thermometers a " Richard " thermograph is used , which supplies a continual record of the temperature .
Two sets of trials were started during the year : the principal\#151 ; for which 30 chronometers were entered\#151 ; commencing on June 1 , while the subsidiary\#151 ; for which there were 12 entries ; \#151 ; commenced on November 1 .
Of the 30 chronometers sent for the first trial only 14 attained the limit prescribed by the Italian Government .
A brief summary of their performance will be found in Appendix III , Table III .
During the year 10 chronometers have been received for the ordinary trials .
Of these 1 obtained the A certificate and 3 B certificates , while 2 failed to pass and 4 are still under examination .
\#166 ; Report of the Kew Committee .
A mean time Astronomical Regulator has also been rated at temperatures of 40 ' to 80 ' Fahr. , and a statement of its performance issued .
VII .
Miscellaneous .
Lens Testing.\#151 ; During the year 31 lenses have been tested ; of these 13 received class A and 18 class B certificates .
These numbers though small show a gratifying increase on the two previous years .
The testing apparatus has been the subject of a good deal of interest , several practical opticians of eminence and others interested in photography having inspected it and enquired into the details of the various tests .
\#166 ; Library.\#151 ; During the year the library has received as presents the publications of\#151 ; r 26 Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and Ireland , and 108 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments , as well as of numerous private individuals .
During the summer a partition was removed which used to divide the library into an outer and an inner portion .
The conversion into a single room has greatly improved the appearance of the library , and has been found advantageous in various other ways .
Loans , fyc .
, Repaid.\#151 ; The Royal Society have been repaid half their loan of \#163 ; 400 made last year towards defraying the cost of the new building , and also the unspent balance\#151 ; \#163 ; 117 1$ .
Id.\#151 ; of the pendulum account .
Paper.\#151 ; Prepared photographic paper has been procured and supplied to the Observatories at Aberdeen , Oxford , Stonyhurst , Lisbon , Mauritius , St. Petersburg , Toronto , and through the Meteorological Office to Batavia , Fort William and Valencia .
Plain Papier Saxe has been sent to Coimbra Observatory , anemograph sheets to the Hong-Kong and Mauritius Observatories , and blank forms for the entry of magnetic observations to the Observatories at Falmouth and Valencia , and to the Science and Art Department , London .
Souse , Grounds , and Path.\#151 ; These have all been kept as usual during the year .
In view of the increased and increasing extent to which the Old Deer Park is now allotted to athletic clubs and other associations having for their object the public amusement , negotiations have been entered upon with the Office of Her Majesty 's Woods and Forests for the purpose of securing ampler protection to the Observatory .

The results given in the following tables are deduced from the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations 'of deflection and vibration .
These were made with the Collimator Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Inclination was observed.with the Inclinometer by Barrow , No. 33 , and needles 1 and 2 , which are 3| inches in length .
The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing Magnetic Observations .
The following is .
a list of the days during the year 1893 which were selected by the Astronomer Boyal , as suitable for the determination of the magnetic diurnal variations , and which have been employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables :\#151 ; January ... ... ... ... 7 , 8 , 15 , 25 , 26 .
