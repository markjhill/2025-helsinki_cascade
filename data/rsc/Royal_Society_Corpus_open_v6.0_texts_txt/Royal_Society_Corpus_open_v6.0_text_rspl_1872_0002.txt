The following observations were made in 1871 , during a passage from England to the Cape of Giood Hope and back , to verify and extend those published in the ' Proceedings ' of this Society for 1869-70-71 .
I. The Effect of Tropical Climate on the Respiration .
Table I. To show:\#151 ; First , that in four healthy adults the spirometric measurement of the lungs gradually rose and fell four times successively in migrating between tropical and temperate climates , and we may therefore conclude that it invariably does so ; second , that the second rise and fall are the greater , partly owing to an increased range of temperature ( 8 ' F. ) , but chiefly to the freer respiratory action of the skin* .

| The tropico-temperate spirometric range varied in these from 10 to 31 , average 23 cubic inches ; i. e. from 4* to 11 , average 8*7 per cent , of the spirometric measurement of the lungs .
The range might have been greater had the thermometric range been so ; but it doubtless has its healthy physiological limits .
The tropico-frigid spirometric range is probably not much higher , as the bodily temperature in cold regions is usually maintained by food , fires , \amp ; c. at about the same standard as in the temperate zone .
This altered spirometric measurement is permanent , i. e. lasts as long as the residence in the new zone .
* This and subsequent facts appear to warrant a conclusion formerly expressed , viz. that one effect of frequent change of climate is to increase , within certain bounds , the vicarious capabilities of excreting organs .

Table II .
shows :\#151 ; First .
That this law prevails between the ages of 14# and 62 , and therefore doubtless at all ages .
Second .
That the rise and fall are greatest at the prime , and decrease towards either extreme of life .
Third .
That at all ages , and for the same reason , the rise and fall are greatest in those of largest frame and most full-blooded .
Fourth .
That for the same reason this rise and fall are greater , cceteris paribus , above than under puberty ( marked * ) , and subsequently increase with the growth of the frame .
Fifth .
That the normal expansion of the lungs and chest from growth only lessens slightly the spirometric reduction under cold , which often falls below its original standard .
Sixth .
That after mid age the rise and fall , like the spirometric measurement itself , diminish with the progressive decay of the frame ( cases 68 to 73 ) .
Seventh .
That in extreme old age ( case 74 ) the shrivelling and less vascular lungs , skin , body , diminishing chest ( cases 68 , 71 ) , respiratory and circulatory functions lessen and finally counterbalance the law .
Eighth .
That obesity , i. e. an increased bulk of body , does not interfere with the last-mentioned effect of advancing age ( case 69 ) .
Ninth .
That the rise and fall are not materially interfered with by an ordinary catarrh ( case 55 ) or asthma ( case 56 ) .
The only exceptions to the law among the 47 cadets were ( case 16 ) a suspicious chest , which gave no primary increase under heat ; and case 41 , which , instead of decreasing under cold , increased by 4 cubic inches by unusually rapid chest expansion from growth .

cubic inches .
266 249 243 This gives a difference of 18 cubic inches from a 10 ' F. reduction of temperature .
Summer heat and winter cold in temperate latitudes , and also the atmosphere of artificially heated or cooled rooms or wards , have corresponding results .
That this spirometric law of climate has little except perhaps a secondary and minor connexion with an increase or decrease in the capacity of the bony chest is shown :\#151 ; 1st .
By the usual absence of any change in the circumference of the adult chest when the rise and fall are greatest ( Table I. , cases 1 and 2 ) .
2nd .
By the slight interference of growth of chest with the manifestations of the law , both in the adult ( Table I. , cases 3 and 4 ) , and especially the cadets ( Table II .
, cases 1 to 47 ) and junior officers ( Table II .
, cases 48 to 60 ) .
The spirometric measurement of the lungs is probably occasionally increased by actual chest expansion when an increased respiratory function is suddenly required in health or disease .
But this is exceptional ; and in emergencies , in cold and warm climates alike , this result is usually effected in a more natural and easier way , viz. by increasing the frequency of the respiration .
The only theory that will satisfactorily explain this tropical increase in the spirometric measurement of the lungs , with its peculiarities , and correlate it with other apparently opposed respiratory phenomena , such as slower and gentler inspiration , and also the mortem lightness of the lungs observed by Francis and Parks , is that it arises not from enlargement of the chest , but merely from a change in the relative quantity of blood and air in the lungs .
The law of the lungs is merely a sequel of the greater law of the circulation , by which the entire blood-current is redistributed , and either attracted surfaceward by heat or driven inward by cold .
The lungs , unaltered in size , contain less blood , actually and relatively , and more air in the tropics ; they are less vascular , but more inflated .
The oscillation in the relative proportion of blood and air follows an inverse ratio , the one rising , for an obvious reason , as the other falls .
It is the rise or fall in the air , and not in the blood , which corresponds with the rise and fall of temperature .
Blood is the dis 6 Dr. A. Rattray on the Effects of [ Nov. 21 , placing , and air the displaced agent .
It is in the blood that the fluctuation originates : when heat attracts this surfacewards , the amount drawn from the lungs is replaced by an equivalent bulk of air ; under cold , which repels the blood inward , the air is again displaced by an equivalent of blood* .
Contrary to previous conviction , based on limited experiment , this variation in the spirometric measurement of the lungs is no index of the effect of change of climate on the ordinary .
Table III .
shows that the latter , instead of deepening by heat like the former , does the reverse , and becomes gentler .
As part of the same general physiological process , reflection points to this as the more likely sequel , and reconciles these apparently conflicting though allied phenomena .

Ordinary slow and prolonged exercise does the same by drawing blood to the functionally active muscles ; and under violent exorcise and a perspiring skin it rises from 10 to 15 cubic inches , even when the second result is taken in the evening , when the reduced temperature should have lessened it in accordance with the law of climate .
This effect of exercise , however , is not so marked in the tropics as in temperate regions .
t This experiment was made by means of an easily inflated bladder , from which the air was measured by a graduated glass cylinder .
1872 .
] changes of Climate on the Human Economy .
Thus in three adults it fell from an average of 17'3 per minute in 56 ' F. to 16-1 in 82 ' F. , and again rose to 17'5 in 53 ' F. To close observation it was perceptibly slower and gentler* * * S. However , as in temperate so in warm regions , the frequency of the respiration varies with the activity of the skin , purity of the blood , and need of the tissues for oxygen .
Thus my tropical respirations ranged from 11 to 15 , average 12-74 per minute ; the range for the temperate zone being 13| to 18 , average 15-68 .
These three well-marked tropical phenomena , viz. diminished lung vascularity , slower respiration , and gentler breathing , are closely related , and together indicate reduced lung -work , the reverse for the temperate zone marking an increased function\#151 ; thus proving that this varies with temperature , as with age , sex , height , \amp ; c. Their aggregate results vary with individuals , and perhaps races ; but the following is a fair average of the reduction in the air respired and carbon excreted:\#151 ; Table YI .

Thus 239 cubic inches of air were respired per minute in the temperate zone , against 195 cubic inches in the tropics , = a difference of 44 cubic inches per minute , or 36-85 cubic feet per day , =18-43 per cent. Then , taking 10 oz. as the average amount of carbon thrown off by the lungs in the temperate climate of England S , this reduction of 18 43 per cent , gives 8-157 oz. as the amount for the tropics .
The pulmonary excretion of watery vapour is doubtless correspondingly diminished .
* The experiments further proved that , like the circulation ( pulse ) , the respiration increases towards infancy .
Is the latter function , though actually less , relatively greater then from the rapid renewal and deoxidation of tissue and food ?
t Corrected for heat in accordance with Dalton and Gay Lussac 's law , the difference here being 27 ' F. . .
, , + Former calculation ( Proceedings , June 16,1870 ) made this as 27*81 cubic inches less of air per minute , =10*9 per cent. = minus 1*1028 oz. of carbon per day .
But t ns was based on limited data , in which the respiration was inaccurately fixed , and its depth calculated not from direct observation , but from the increased spirometnc measurement of the lungs .
S Mean of three estimates by Lavoisier and Seguin , Davy , and Allen and ePJs* 8 Dr. A. Rattray on the Effects of [ Nov. 21 , But this and the 1*843 oz. less carbon are perhaps partly excreted by the vicariously active skin and liver ; but how far has yet to be determined .
But it must be remembered that less carbon has usually to be eliminated in the tropics , both from the reduced and often altered ingesta , and lessened brain and body-tissue waste .

The Effect of Tropical Climate on the Bodily Development .
The following experiments prove that tropical climate , per se , interferes with the normal growth of the body .
During the voyage forty-eight cadets , of the impressionable age of to 17 , were weighed and measured in height six times at intervals of sixty days , i. e. after four successive changes of climate , their diet being abundant , fresh , and healthy .
If lads stop growing , and still more if they lose flesh , it proves that some unhealthy influence is at work .
Table YII .
shows:\#151 ; First , that tropical heat interferes much with the bodily growth and development , as indicated by the weight , retarding it in most , and stopping it in some ; second , that temperate climates have an opposite influence ; third , that a second exposure to heat increases its wasting effect , and also lessens the subsequent building-up results of cold .

An increasing weight , with either an increasing ( Table IX .

J j j / J v 10 Effects of Climate on the Human Economy .
[ Nov. 21 , Both , the number who grew and the amount of increase were thus least in the tropics .
These detrimental fluctuations necessarily affect both body and brain .
If , therefore , we would produce strong , healthy , long-lived officers and seamen , fit for any work or climate , we should not send them unnecessarily to warm regions while as yet undeveloped lads .
The following are the chief results and inferences of these experiments:\#151 ; 1st .
The primary effect of great changes of climate is on the circulation , the blood being drawn surfaceward by heat and driven inward by cold .
2nd .
The secondary and local results are an increase or decrease in the vascularity and function of the various tissues and organs of the entire body\#151 ; the external increasing under heat , internal under cold , and vice versa .
3rd .
Hence in the tropics the vascularity of the adult lungs is reduced by an average of 12 or 13 fluid oz. ; their spirometric measurement by an average of 23 cubic inches ; their function by 18*43 per cent. , i. e. the use of 36*85 cubic feet less of air daily , excretion of 1*84 oz. less carbon , and 6* 57 per cent , less of watery vapour .
4th .
Hence , also , the nephritic vascularity and secretion are reduced in the tropics by 17| per cent. , and those of the skin increased by 24 per cent. 5th .
In unison with the respiration the circulation is more languid in the tropics , as indicated by the reduced ( several beats ) and perhaps less forcible pulse .
6th .
Notwithstanding the reduced circulatory and respiratory functions , and increased cutaneous exhalation , the temperature of the surface , and perhaps that of the blood and body generally , rises about 2 ' T. under tropical heat .
7th .
The organs and functions of animal , like those of vegetable , life are affected by great changes of climate , \#151 ; heat impairing the weight , strength , and health , i. e. the physique , at all ages and retarding growth in youth ; while cold has an opposite effect .
8th .
Bor obvious reasons these results vary with sex , temperament , size , \amp ; c. ; and are most evident in the adult , decreasing towards either extreme of life .
9th .
Collectively these changes are salutary , and meant to assimilate the various organs , functions , and body of the inhabitants of one zone to those of native races , to meet the requirements of the foreign climate , for which they are not , and perhaps never can be altogether , physiologically fitted .
