441 The liquid in contact with a growing crystal of sodium nitrate has at 19 ' C. the index 1*38991 , and contains about 48'45 grammes of salt in 100 grammes of solution ; a saturated solution at 19 ' C. has the index T38905 , and contains about 48*1 grammes of salt in 100 grammes of solution .
In each case the liquid in contact with the growing crystal is slightly supersaturated .
It was not found to exhibit double refraction even in the case of sodium nitrate .
No experiments seem to have previously been made upon the nature of this liquid .
G. Wulff has suggested that vicinal faces are due to concentration streams in the solution .
In order to test this view , crystals of alum were measured after growing for several hours in solution kept continually agitated in order to eliminate the action of the concentration streams .
Almost no effect was produced upon the angles of the vicinal faces .
In sodium chlorate and sodium nitrate the solute is about 45 times more dense in the crystal than in the adjacent liquid .
Now planes with high indices in a space-lattice contain fewer points in unit area than planes with simple indices .
The author suggests that vicinal faces grow upon a crystal in preference to simple forms because the \#166 ; crystallising material descends upon the growing face in a shower which is not very dense .

( Abstract .
) The investigations of Professor Mascart on this subject are perhaps the most extensive of any up to the present time .
He examined the effect in several gases , and found that in general the temperature coefficient exceeded the theoretical coefficient given by Gladstone and Dale 's law .
The range of temperature was , however , comparatively small , and his results for air do not agree with those of Lorenz , von Lange , and Benoit .
In fact these four observers disagree .
Lorenz and Benoit found a coefficient agreeing wTith the above law , while von Lange obtained a coefficient less than the theoretical value .
A repetition of the measurements therefore seemed desirable .
The gases examined were air , hydrogen , carbon dioxide , ammonia , and sulphur dioxide .
The range of temperature was from 10 ' C. to 442 Dependence of Refractive Index on Temperature .

100 ' C. The method used was the well-known one of Jamin , but special precautions were taken to obtain accuracy , and to be sure that the gas had not changed in composition during the various-changes of pressure and temperature to which the containing tubes were subjected .
An accuracy of about one part in 600 has been obtained .
The results are briefly shown in the following table , and it will be-observed that the temperature coefficients obtained are substantially less than those obtained by Mascart .
