" Experimental evidence in support of the secretion of Carbon by animals .
" By Robert Rigg , Esq. , F.R.S. The author finds that the mean of the results of different experimentalists as to the quantity of carbon excreted by respiration from adults , during twenty-four hours , is 5963 grains ; whereas the weight of the carbon contained in the whole of the food , both solid and liquid , received into the body duting the same period , as ascertained by the analysis of each article of diet , made by the author , falls very short of that quantity ; varying in different cases from 3002 to 4800 grains .
The same inference is drawn from experiments made on a mouse , weighing 181 grains , confined in a wire trap for twenty-eight days ; during which time it consumed food containing 544'5 grains of carbon , and gave out , in the respired air , $10 741'2 grains of carbon , being 196'7 grains more than it had received ; and it had also gained in absolute weight 27 grains .
The conclusion which the author deduces from these experiments is , that carbon is actually formed or secreted by animals .
