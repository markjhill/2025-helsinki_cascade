\#166 ; .
# ^ A specimen of argon , the lightest fraction obtained from Professor Ramsay 's diffusion experiments , was treated in the manner just described .
After several hours ' circulation it was found that the gas absorbed by the platinum consisted only of argon , and no trace of helium could be detected .
This process has also been applied to the analysis of the gases from certain mineral springs ; the results of these experiments form the subject of another paper .

It has long been known* that many crystallised minerals contain gas enclosed in cavities in which drops of liquid are also frequently visible .
The liquid often consists of water and aqueous solutions , occasionally of hydrocarbons , and not unfrequently of carbon dioxide , the latter being recognisable by the peculiarities of its behaviour under the application of heat .
The liquid supposed to be carbon dioxide has been found in some cases to pass from the liquid to the gaseous state , and therefore to disappear , and to return from gas to liquid at temperatures lower by two or three degrees than the critical point of carbon dioxide .
This seems to indicate the presence of some incondensable gas , and as H. Davy found nitrogen in the fluid cavities of quartz , it seemed probable that the alteration of the critical point was due to that gas .
My attention was drawn to this subject by the observation that Peterhead granite , when heated in a vacuum , gives off several times its volume of gas , consisting , to the extent of three-fourths of its volume , of hydrogen ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 59 , p. 218 ) .

Gases enclosed Since this observation , I find that the presence of hydrogen in crystalline rocks has been recognised by other observers , notably by A. W. Wright ( ' Amer .
J. Sci. , ' Ser. 3 , vol. 12 , p. 171 ) .
In the course of a study of the gases from meteorites , Wright obtained from a certain " trap " rock , the origin and character of which is not stated , at a low red-heat , " about three-fourths of its volume of mixed gases , which were found to contain about 13 per cent , of carbon dioxide , the residue being chiefly hydrogen .
Another specimen of trap containing small nodules of anorthite was examined at the request of Mr. Gr .
W. Hawes , who had observed gas cavities in a thin section of the mineral prepared for microscopic examination .
This gave off somewhat more than its own volume of gas , which was found to contain some 24 per cent , of carbon dioxide .
" Professor Dewar and Mr. Ansdell have also examined one or two rocks in the course of their researches on meteorites ( ' Roy .
Inst. Proc. , * 1886 ) .
They found that both gneiss and felspar , containing graphite , yield gas , which , upon analysis , was found to have the composition stated below .

P27 94-72 0'81 2-21 061 P40 Dewar and Ansdell remark that " the small quantity of marsh gas , no doubt , comes from the disseminated graphite , but the presence of the hydrogen is more difficult to explain , and requires further investigation .
" I have lately been following up this question , and have obtained results which present some points of considerable interest .
For materials I have been indebted chiefly to my colleague , Professor Judd , who has also supplied information as to the probable geological age of the specimens of rocks and minerals tested .
All that I have examined yield permanent gas when heated in a vacuum .
This gas varies in amount from a volume about equal to that of the rock or mineral to about eighteen times that volume .
It usually consists of hydrogen in much larger proportion than that found by the observers just quoted , together with carbon dioxide and smaller quantities of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons .
Every specimen has been examined by the spectroscope for helium , but in no case could D3 be recognised , or any other line which would lead to a suspicion of the presence of this substance .
The gas is very frequently , but not always , accompanied by water in notable quantities .
The gas is apparently wholly enclosed in cavities which are visible-in thin sections of the rock when viewed under the microscope , but as they are extremely minute , very little gas is lost when the rock is .
in Crystalline Bocks and Minerals .
reduced to coarse powder , and as a result of experiment in one or two cases , I find that practically the same amount of gas is evolved on heating the rock whether it is used in small lumps or in powder .
In the first series of experiments undertaken with the object of a rapid survey of the materials , the gases were not completely analysed .
They were collected , measured , the carbon dioxide l-emoved by potash , and the residue examined by the spectroscope .
When ignited in the air it always burned with a pale flame resembling that of hydrogen .
The table ( p. 456 ) shows the results of these experiments .
A selection of these was then subjected to more careful and exact analysis .
For this purpose fresh masses of the rock were taken , and the gas extracted in the usual way .
The following are the results :\#151 ; CO , .

Of the substances capable of so acting , carbon , a metal , or a protoxide of a metal , present themselves as the most probable .
The reduction of carbon dioxide or of water vapour by carbon gives rise to the formation of carbon monoxide , and if carbon had been the agent the proportion of this gas in the mixture must have been greater than is found to be the case .
It is , of course , well known that carbon dioxide and water vapour are both dissociated at moderately high temperatures , but the greater part of the liberated oxygen recombines at lower temperatures , though a small portion may remain free in the presence of a large quantity of an indifferent gas or vapour .
No free oxygen has been found in any of the gases analysed .
Direct experiments , made with ferrous oxide ( obtained by gently heating pure chalybite ) and with magnetic oxide of iron , show that while the former , at a red-heat , decomposes both steam and carbon dioxide quite freely , liberating hydrogen and carbon monoxide , and becoming itself oxidised into magnetic oxide ; the latter has no action vol. lx .

457 at all upon either steam or carbon dioxide .
Magnetic oxide of iron is the final product of the action of steam or of carbon dioxide at a high temperature upon metallic iron :\#151 ; 3Fe 4- 4H20 = Fe304 + 4H2 .
3Fe+4C02 = Fe304+4C0 .
Now , metallic iron has been detected in basalts and some other rocks by Andrews ( ' Brit. Assoc. Rep. , ' 1852 , Sections , p. 34 ) , and by other observers ( e.g. , G. W. Hawes , ' Amer .
J. Sci. , ' Ser. 3 , vol. 13 , p. 33 ) , and I have verified this observation in the case of the gabbro of Locli Coruisk .
But it must be remembered that both the reactions indicated in the equations just given are reversible , and therefore the presence of metallic iron along with the magnetic oxide in such rocks cannot be taken by itself as final proof that the oxide and the associated gases , hydrogen and carbonic oxide , are the products of the action of steam and carbon dioxide upon metallic iron .
The presence of marsh gas in these rocks and the production of large quantities of hydrocarbonous gases , as well as liquid petroleum , in many parts of the earth 's surface , tend to support the view , which is apparently gaining ground , that in the interior of the earth 's crust there are large masses , not only of metal but of compounds of metals , such as iron and manganese , with carbon .
Assuming the existence of such material , it is easy to conceive how , by the action of water at an elevated temperature , it may give rise to metallic oxides and mixtures of hydrogen with paraffinoid and other hydrocarbons .
This view was put forward some years ago by Mendelejeff ( " Principles of Chemistry , " Translation by Kamensky and Greenaway , vol. 1 , 364\#151 ; 365 ) , and it has lately received further support from the results of the study of metallic carbides , which we owe especially to Moissan ( ' Roy .
