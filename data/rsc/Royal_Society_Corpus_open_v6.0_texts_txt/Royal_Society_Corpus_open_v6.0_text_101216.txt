Account of a great number of Stones , found in one Bladder , by the same .
Mr. Goodrick Surgeon of Bury St. Edmunds affirmed to me , that himself Cutting a Lad of the Stone ( for which he hath a great name ) took out thence , at one time , 96 small Stones , all of them of unlike shape , Size , Corners , Sides ; some of which were so bestowed as to slide upon others , and had thereby worn their flats to a wonderful slikness .
He assured me also , that in the same place , another , when dead , had a Stone taken from him , almost as big as a new-born Childs head , and much of that Shape .
