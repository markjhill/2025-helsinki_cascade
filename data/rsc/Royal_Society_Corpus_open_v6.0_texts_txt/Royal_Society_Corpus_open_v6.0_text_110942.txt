" Experiments relative to Animal Temperature , showing that there must be some source of animal heat besides the combustion of the Carbon and the Hydrogen contained in the Food of Animals .
" By Robert Rigg , Esq. , F.R.S. The subject of these experiments was a labouring man in the employment of the author , living on his ordinary food , and working at his usual employment .
A strict examination was instituted into the quantity and chemical constituents of the ingesta and egesta during ten days ; at the end of which time he had gained one pound in w-eight .
He infers from the results of this experiment , that the carbon and hydrogen contained in the food of animals , which enter iilto combination with the respired oxygen , forming carbonic acid and water , do not generate sufficient heat for the purposes of animal life ; and that:consequently there must be some other sources of heat in the animal economy , one of which he believes to be the secretion of carbon .
