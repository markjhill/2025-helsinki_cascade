IN 1834 the existence of an period of earthquake frequency lvas out by MfiRIAN , and his discovery has been fully confirmed by the work of seismoIogists .
No result of equal importance was , however , added to our knowledge until fifty years afterwards , when a valuable memoir*was presented by Dr. C. .
KNOTT to the Seismological Society of Japan .
As the present paper follows so1llewhat closely in the lines laid down by Dr. KNOTT , I will first give a short account of the results obtained by him , and in the next SeCtion will describe his method of investigation .
One of the objects of DR. KNOTT'S work was to ascerbain whether any could be detected of a six-monthly , as well as of an annual , period .
He examined for this purpose lists of earthquakes in Japan from to 1880 ( MILNE ) , Europe and the adjacent parts of Asia and Africa from 306 to 1843 ( PERREY ) , the Grecian Archipelago from 1859 to 1873 ( SCHMIDT ) , the East Indian Archipelago from 1873 to 1881 ( BERGSMA ) , New Zealand from 1869 to 1879 , and Chili from 1873 to 1881 ( VARGARA ) .
The chief results obtained from this discussion are the following : ( 1 ) In five of the six districts selected there is a well-marked annual period , the about December or January in Europe , the Grecian Archipelago , and Japan , and between June and September in New Zealand and ; i.e. , during the yinter season in every case : while in the East Indies , close to and on either side of the equator , no such period could be discerned .
( 2 ) With the exception of the East Indies there seems to be in the earthquakes of each district a ) eriod the maxima occurring about January and June or July in nrope , about September in the Grecian Archipelago , about June and , about uary and August in New about ( for the first ) in Chili , the second not being clearly defined .

com'pared with the others " " almost suggests says Dr. KNOTT , " " that this semi-annual characteristic is ] most accidental , and that with a sufficient number of observations it might vanish altogether\ldquo ; ; " " and yet , " " it seems too general to be accidental lt appears to me , therefore , desirable to examine the seismic records of other countries besides those which were at the disposal of Dr. KNOTT in 1884 , and this I shall endeavour to do in the present paper .
The relation of seismic periodicity to intenslty will also be considered , though the are somewhat inadequate for the purpose .
In the closiug paragraphs , a summary is given of the principal lclusions arrived at , and an attempt is made to show hat the annual variation in barometric pressure may be the cause of bhe annual seismic period .
With regard to the origin of the period , I regret that I am unable to offer any definite suggestion .
METHOD 0F INVESTIGATION .

Dr. KNOTT'S Method.\mdash ; If be a periodic function of a variable , we may write , from which it ] that . .

and ; where in all terms are absent which involve multiples of , in all those involving multiples of , while , in the third expression , bhe terms involving and all nlultiples of disappear .
If , then , we take to represent a period of one year , epresents the result of taking three-monthly means , and the effect of this is to eliminate bhe three-monthly period , if there be one , and all periods which are fractions of three months , and also to diminish the amplitudes of all other periods relatively to that of the annual period .
In like manner , represents the result of taking six-monthly means , the effect being to eliminate the six-monthly period , if there be one , and all periods which are fractions of six months , and also to diminish the amplitudes of all other periods relatively to that of the annual period .
The result of the third operation is to eliminate the annual period , and to give special prominence to the six-monthly and four-monthly periods , if such exist .
Now , if we have a record of all the earthquakes felt during a given intefval ( containing an exact number of years ) over a definite area , and if we group together all the earthquakes felt during each month of the year , we may regard the numbers so obtained as representing the average number for each month felt on the middle day of that month .
The mean of the numbers for the months of December , January , and February , will be the three-mo1lthly mean corresponding to the middle of January ; and the mean of the numbers for the montbs of November , December , January , February , March and April , will be the six-monthly mean corresponding to the end of January .
If three-monthly and six-monthly means be calculated in this manner for each month , and if the be plotted in the usual way , the first of the curves so obtained will show no trace of a three-monthly period , and the second none of a sixmonthly period .
To eliminate the annual period , arithmetic means are interpolated between each pair of numbers in the two series , the means of the first series giving the three-monthly means corresponding to the end of each month , and those of the second series the six-monthly means corresponding to the middle of each month .
Multiplying each number of the first series by , or 707 , and subtracting it from the corresponding number of the second series , the curve obtained by plotting the resultir1g differences will show no trace of an annual period , and will give special prominence to the six-monthly and monthly periods , if such exist .
Lastly , if each of the twenty-four differences be divided by the average of all , the curves so obtained for different intervaIs and for different areas of observation will be more directly comparable with one another .
3 .
If the third and succeeding terms in the expression for may be neglected in comparison with the first and second , it is evident that will be a maximum when the second term ( which determines the six-monthly period ) is a minimum , and vice versed .
By a slight , Dr. KNOTT has reversed the sign of this term , and consequently the epochs which he obtains for the maxima of the sixmonthly period are in reality those of the minima , and vice versed .
4 .
Method dopted in this have described in some detail the method employed by Dr. KNOTT , for , in principle , it is the same as that adopted in this Paper .
The chief differences are that I have used the same method in investigating both the annual and semi-annual periods , have also taken into account the variable length of the month .
Whenever possible I have grouped the earthquakes in half-monthly , instead of in monthly intervals , the first half of February containing fourteen days , and of all other months fifteen days .
The numbers so obtained are then reduced to equal half-monthly intervals of fifteen days .
In investigating the annual period , the reduced figures for the halves of each month are added together , giving the numbers of earthquakes corresponding to equal monthly intervals of thirty days .
Six-monthly means are then taken of these numbers , as in Dr. KNOTT'S method , and the mean thus obtained for the end of each month is divided by the average of all twelve means .
For the semi-annual period , the reduced figures for the first half of January and the first half of July are added together , and so on .
Six-half-monthly means are then taken of these numbers , and the mean thus obtained for the end of each half-month is divided by the average of all twelve means .
5 .
Seismologists generally group earthquakes in monthly intervals , and in some cases I have only been able to make use of such tables .
In a few others , also , for reasons which will be obvious , I have used them though having access to the catalogues on which they were founded .
The results obtained in this way are not of equal value for purposes of comparison , as they probably depend on different definitions of the unit earthquake .
In all these cases the monthly numbers are first reduced to equal intervals of thirty days .
The discussion for the annual period is then continued as before .
For the semi-annual period the numbers for January and July are added together , and so on .
Three-monthly means are then taken of these six numbers , and the mean thus obtained for the middle of each month is divided by the average of all six means .
The method , of course , chiefly differs from the preceding in giving fewer points upon the curve .
6 .
Again , in takin e six-monthly means for the annual period , and dividing each by the average of all twelve , it is evident , from the expression for in , that every * In ating the semi-annual period by this method , it is obvious that the annual period is eliminated ( see S 10 ) .
AND SEMI-ANNUAL SEISMIC PERTODS .
ordinate in the curve so obtained is reduced in the ratio 2 : .
It is also further reduced by the methoa1 of grouping the earthquakes in monthly intervals .
For , instead of using the actual ordinate for , we use the average ordinate over an interval that is , Now , the value of 12 sin is 9886 .
Hence the difference between eacb reduced six-monthly mean and unity must be multiplied by the factor or .
The same remark applies to the case of taking six-half-monthly means for the semi-annual period .
In like manner , in investigating the latter period by means of monthly and taking three-monthly means , the corresponding augmenting factor is 7 .
of the Methods of Investigating the Period.\mdash ; The method here employed for investigating the semi-annual period seems to me to possess several advantages .
( 1 ) It is less laborious to apply than Dr. KNOTT'S method ; ( 2 ) it avoids the interpolation of arithmetic means in the series of three-monthly and sixmonthly means ; and ( 3 ) it eliminates , or diminishes more completely , the effect of shorter periods , if any such should exist .
The latter point requires a brief examination .
Taking Dr. KNOTT'S method first , we have to evaluate the atio for different values of .
If , the value of this ratio is 943 ; if , it is zero ; if , it is 566 ; if , it is .
Hence , compared with that of the sixmonthly period , the amplitude of the four-monthly period is slightly decreased , that of the period of one-fifth of a year is diminished by nearly one-half , while that of the two-monthly period is diminished by two-thirds .
In the met , hod adopted in this paper we have to evaluate the ratio for different values of .
If , its vahle is zero ; if , it .
Hence , the three-monthly period is eliminated , and , compared with that of the six-monthly period , the amplitude of the two-monthly period is diminished by two-thirds .
More- over , as will appear from S 10 , both the four-monthly period and the period whose length is one-fifth of a year are eliminated , provided the interval over which the seismic record extends consists of an integral number of years .
8 .
The curves in fig. 1 exhibit the close agreement in the results obtained by the different methods of determining the semi-annual period , the seismic record chosen being that by Professor MILNE of the earthquakes felt in Tokio during the years 1873-1881 and 1883-1890 .
The continuous curve is that obtained by Dr. KNOTT'S nletbod , every ordinate being first , however , multiplied by , so as not to alter the ratio of the amplitude to , hat of the annual period .
The broken curve is that obtained by the method used in this paper , the earthquakes being grouped in half-months , while the dotted curve is that obtained by the same method when the earthquakes are grouped in months .
9 .
Connection between Amplitude of the Period and the Winter.toSummer Ratio in the Number of Earthquakes.\mdash ; In discussions on earthquake frequency , it is usual to estimate the ratio between the number of shocks felt during the six winter months ( October to March ) to the number felt during the six summer months ( April to September ) .
The ratio so obtained is , of course , only valuable when , as is frequently the case , the maximum of the annual period occurs either at the end of June or the end of December .
Greater uniformity would be secured by evaluating the ratio of the number of shocks felt during the six months bisected by the maximum epoch to the number felt during the six months bisected by the minimum epoch .
In the present paper , I have substituted the amplitude of the annual period for the lastnamed ratio , and it seems desirable to point out briefly the connection between them .
In fig. the distance AC represent the average number of earthquakes per month , and let the curve represent the annual seismic period .
Let PM and QN represent the average length of the ordinates during the maximum and minimum halves of the year respectively .
Then the ratio of the number of shocks felt during the maximum half to the number felt during the minimum half of the year is equal to PM : , i.e. , to the ratio of to , where is the amplitude of the annual period , the average number of shocks felt during each month of the year bein taken as unity .
For instance , in the case of the European earthquakes of 1865-1884 as tabulated by FUCHS ( see S19 ) , the maximm of the annual period occurs at the end of AND SEMI-ANNUAL SEISMIC PERIOI ) December , the number of shocks felt during the six winter lnonths is number during the six summer months 2142 , and the ratio of one to the other The amplitude of the annual period is 35 , and the value of the ratio : is 1.56 .
10 .
Duration of the Seismic Record.\mdash ; It has been assumed in the preceding paragraphs that the curve obtained by plotting the number of earthquakes felt in each month is not affected by periods of longer duration than one year , or by periods which are not exact fractions of a year .
The assumption may be tested by considering a period of months , where is either zero or a positive integer .
The number of earthquakes belo.nging to this period felt during the month of each year may then be represented by where , and is the number of years over which the seismic record extends .
Then ; and the value of is zero whatever be the value of if , where is all integer , i.e. , when .
Hence , is zero for all values of , and consequently our method of investigation is not affected by the period considered , provided the interval over which the seismic record extends includes an exact number of these periods .
But whatever be the number of such periods included in the seismic record , the absolute error introduced by a given ated portion of a period will be constant , and , therefore , the relative error will be the less the greater the mterval over which the record extends .
On another account , also , it is desirable that this should be as as possible .
For , owing chiefly to orogcnic causes , there are often of frequently recurring shooks , lasting for one or more months , which , if , record be a short one or imperfect , would unduly increase the numbers felt during those months .
The record shouId therefore be an extensive one in order to eliminate the effects of occasional variability in the rate of orogenic action to into } ) } ) minence those of a periodic character .
11 .
Definition of the Unit .\mdash ; The difficulty of deciding what constitutes an earthquake attends all work on seismic periodicity , and , unless some uniform and natural system is followed , our conclusions cannot possess much value .
For example , every great earthquake is preceded and followed by a large number of minor or secondary , which are no doubt intimately associated with the principal shock .
In such a case , are we to count every shock that is recorded , however slight , or are we to regard the whole series as a single earthquake ?
Again , the distinction ween an earthquake and earth-tremor is a purely arbitraly one .
Are we to include every earth-tremor recorded by a most delicate instrument , and rank it equally with the most destructive shock ; or , if not , where are we to draw the line between the two It must be admitted that these are serious difficulties , but I do not think they would be met , as has been proposed , by taking the intensity of the shocks into account as well as their frequency .
Even supposing it possible to estimate the intensity correctly , it may be doubted whether the results obtainable in the finite time at our disposal would possess much value , at any rate from the periodicity point of view .
For , whatever be the causes of seismic periodicity , it seems highly probable that they are merely auxiliary , and determine the epoch when an earthquake shall take place rather than that there shall be an earthquake at all .
The intensity is probably determined almost ntirely by orogenic causes , the frequency partly by the same causes , and partly by certain others which are possibly variable and periodic in their action .
I believe , then , that , in the present state of our knowledge , it is desirable to regard each shock felt and recorded as one earthquake .
Moreover , an approximate uniformity in estimating the minimum intensity of an earthquake will be attained if we consider special districts of comparatively small ] , for example , like Italy and Switzerland , rather than continents or hemispheres .
There is still room , however , for some arbitrariness of treatment , owing to the imperfection of nearly all our seismic records .
The following principles have , therefore , been adhered to throughout this paper : ( 1 ) whenever the entry in a catalogue is " " several shocks about this time some equivalent expression , without any attempt made to give the time of occurrence of each shock , I have always reckoned such as a single earthquake ; ( 2 ) when the shocks have been considered important enough to be entered separately , the time of occurrence of each being given , every such shock has been counted , provided the interval between any two or more was not less than five minntes ; and ( 3 ) 9hocks entered as doubtful and earthquakesounds unaccompanied by any shocks have been omitted .
12 .
of the Tables , Figures , .\mdash ; Table I. contains the number of earthquakes for the different districts investigated during each half-month or month .
The reduced six-monthly obtained in the annual period , as described AND SEMI-ANNUAL SEISMIC PERIODS .
in and 6 are given in Table II .
; and in Table III .
the reduced six half-monthly means , three-monthly means , obtained in investigating the semi-annual period .
At the end of the section relating to each record examined , are given the maximum epoch and amplitude of each period .
The epoch mentioned is the end of the month or half-month indicated , the letters and denoting the first and second halves of the month .
The date of the maximum and the amplitude have been taken as those of the greatest mean .
It would not have been difficult to have given the result more minutely , but it is doubtful whether the appearance of greater accuracy would have any value , considering the unavoidable imperfections of most seismic records .
In the same place , I have also given the date of the maximum epoch of the annual barometric period over the greater part of the district considered , excluding high-level stations .
For this purpose I have made use of Dr. BUCHAN'S great work on Atmospheric Circulation.$ The method of investigation is the same as that employed for the annual seismic period , except that its application is much simpler in this case .
An asterisk placed before the name of a record , either in the ables or detailed indicates that the results obtained are probably more reliable than in cases .
The series of six-monthly and six half-monthly means calculated from these records are illustrated by the curves in figs. .
, the continuous line representing the annual , and the dotted line the semi-annual , period .
THEi REALITY 0F THE ANNUAL PERIOD .
13 .
It is well known that many more earthquakes are recorded as felt during the night than during the day , and that this is due partly to the stillness of the night , but more , perhaps , to the position of the body during repose being more favourable for the detection of slight tremors .
Now , the maximum of the annual period occurring during winter , it may seem possible that the periodicity may be apparent only , and due to the greater number of shocks observed during the longer nights of winter .
The question is one that deserves examination , and the following facts seem to me conclusiye in establishing the reality of the annual period .
In the case of the earthquakes recorded at Tokio by the Gray-Milne seismograph , there can , of course , be no doubt .
But this is the only case treated in this paper in which the shocks are registered entirely by instrumental means .
The hours of rest may be taken roughly between 10 .
and 8 A , and we therefore divide the day into two parts , day-time from 9 .
to 9 , and night-time from 9 .
to 9 .
Using FuCHs ' kStatistik der Erdbeben , ' I have counted the number of shocks , whose time of ence is recorded , in Austria , * ' ' Report on Atmosph culation , basod on the Observations made on HMS Challellger during the years 1873-1876 , and othel .

Hungary , and zerland during the years 1865-1884 , and in I during the years 1865-1883 .
The total number is 2253 .
In the six summer months ( April to September ) the number of shocks felt during the night was 545 , and during the day 358 .
In the six winter months ( October to ) the number felt during the night was 821 , and during the day 529 .
Thus , the ratio of the number of shocks observed during the night to that observed during the day was in summer and in winter .
These ratios agree so closely that we may feel confident as to the reality of any marked annual period observable in these countries .
Again , the annual period is well marked in several tropical districts where the length of the night is nearly constant throughout the year .
And , also , as will presently appear , there is an annual period , though of slight amplitude , in earthquakes which produce damage to buildings , and shocks of intensity so great could not possibly escape observation at any time of the night or day .
SEISMIC PERIODICITY 1N RELAT10N To 14 .
If the causes of seismic periodicity are in the main auxiliary , as has been suggested above , it seems possible that the periodicity might be more marked in the case of very slight , than of very severe , earthquakes .
An attempt is therefore made in the present section to classify earthquakes according to their intensity , so far as it is possible to do so with the incomplete materials at our disposal .
For this purpose I have in the first place used MALLET'S well-known catalogue , have selected from the shocks recorded by him : ( 1 ) those which may be regarded as slight , and ( 2 ) those which are strong enough to damage buildings ; the latter class corresponding to intensities 8 to 10 of the Rossi-Forel scale , and the former , probably , to intensities 3 and 4 .
Both classes contain earthquakes felt in the northern hemisphere only .
Slight Earthquakes.\mdash ; The shocks included under this heading are those which , from MALLET'S description , can have been hardly more than perceptible even at the places where the intensity was greatest .
When two or more such shocks are felt within the same area on the same day , these have been omitted , for they may be regarded as equivalent to a single shock of greater intensity .
And , for the same reason , I have excluded isolated slight shocks which are members of a long and continuous series of earthquakes of variable intensity .
This has been done in four * ' ' of recorded Earthquakes ' Brit. Assoc. Rep 1852 , pp. 1-176 ; 1853 , pp. 117-212 ; 1854 , pp. 1-326 .
The following are the terms employed by MALLET which I have taken to characterize a slight shock:\mdash ; A trcmor , a trembling , a slight trembling , a slight tremor , a slight tremulous shock , a trembling shock , a very feeble shock , a feeble vibration , a very slight shock , a slight shock , a slight vibration , slight earthquake , a scarcely perceptible shock , a slight vibratory shock , rather slight , of importance , a feeble shock , a trifling shock , a little shock , a slight undulatory , a very slight subterranean commotion , a slight undulatory shock , a slight oscillating motion .
AND SEMI-ANNUAL SHiISMIC PERIODS .
ases , namely , the series felt at Tiflis Georgia 1804 , at Pignerol and other places Piedmont durlng 1808 and followlng years , at Lunroe in Norway , be inning in 1819 , and at Pesaro Italy the year 1826 .
The period is that embraced by the third part of catalogue\mdash ; the years 1785-1842 inclusive .
Slight rthqu nkes .
It seemed desirable to limit it thus closely in order to avoid any considerable variability in the estimation of a " " slight\ldquo ; hock .
The total number of such shocks is 187 .
The curves of the annual and selni-annual periods are in fig. 3 .
Destructive \mdash ; Only those earthquakes have been counted in which is expressly stated that some damage was done to Tiue whole of the Christian era is included , but the first earthquake on which the month and day are .
Destructive earth definitely stated occurred in the year 528 , and in everal succeeding centuries the year is frequently the only date given .
The total numbel of recorded by MALLET is 641 .
The curves of the annual and semi-annual are shown in fig. 4 .
It follows from this examination , imperfect as it is , ( 1 ) that in slight earthquakes both periods are more marked than in destructive ones , but that this is especially the case with the semi-annual period , the amplitude of the annual period being increased times , and that of the semi-annual period times ; and ( 2 ) that the maximum epochs of the annual period are almost reyersed .
1 of 1885-1889.\mdash ; The organization of earthquake statistics in Japan is under the direction of the Imperial Meteorological Bureau .
Reports are issued yearly , and abridged translations of these for the years 1885-1889 , have been published by Professor S. SEKIYA and Professor J. MILNE ( see S51 ) .
Professor fiLNE has classified the earthquakes in monthly groups according to the areas disturbed by them .
The results are given below , but it should be that the duration of the record is short ; ] that the areas given are land areas only , and many Japanese earthquakes originate beneath the sea .

AND SEMI-ANNUAL SEISMIC PERIODS , Thus , ( 1 ) the amplitudes of both periods in all three classes are nearly the same , though somewhat less for the slight shocks than the others ; and ( 2 ) in the case of the annual period , the maximum epoch for the slight shocks agrees nearly with the minimum epoch for the more severe ones .
16 .
In nearly every case examined below , in which we have two or more records for the same area , it will be seen that amplitude increases with the number of registered shocks per annum .
Now , two records can only differ in this respect by the omission or inclusion of slight shocks , for severe ones are almost certain to find a place in every list .
Thus , in these cases , the slighter the earthquakes the greater is the amplitude of each period .
This is especially evident when , with the same catalogue , we use different definitions of the unit earthquake .
This has been done in three cases , namely , Zante ( SS45 , 46 ) , California , \amp ; c. , ( SS59 , 60 ) , and New Zealand ( SS76 , 77 ) .
Again , for Zante , the somewhat scanty list compiled from the catalogues of SCHMIDT and FUCHS ( S47 ) gives the maximum of the annual period in Decernber , and the amplitude.29 ; the much fuller catalogue of BARBIANI ( SS45 , 46 ) gives the maximum in August , and the amplitude.10 , or , using BARBIANI'S definition of the unit earthquake , the maximum in , and the amplitude .
Thus , the effect of the first inclusion of slight shocks is to reverse approximately the maximum and minimum epochs , but to reduce the amplitude ; the effect of including a larger number of still slighter shocks is to maintain the reversal of epoch nd to increase the amplitude .
17 .
of Results 1 ) There appear to be two distinct classes of slight shocks , one having the maximum of its annual period in winter , the other in snmmer .
Of t , he two the former probably contains the stronger shocks , for .
effect is evident in the results obtained from the less incomplete of two lmperfect catalogues ; while the effect of the latter is only the results obtained from the fullest records , for example , those of the Imperial Meteorologlcal Bureau for Japan , and of M. BARBIANI for ante , or from the list drawn up from catalogue in which only very slight shocks are included .
( 2 ) In both classes of slight shocks the annual period is more marked than for strong shocks , for he effect of including the first class of slight shocks is to keep he wllter epoch unaltered and to increase the amplitude ; that of including some only of the second class is to interchange the maximum and minimum epochs approxlmately , the amplitude of the period being diminished ; while the effect of including a large number of slight shocks of the second class is to keep the epochs interchanged and to increase the amplitude .
( 3 ) With regard to the semi-annual period , the results , as a rule , show that strong and ight shocks have the same maximum epochs , but that the amplitude for the latter is somewhat greater than for the former .

Some of the shocks counted by him are omitted on account of the rules laid down in S 11 , others , because they were felt in Jersey and Guernsey .

It may be interesting to compare with these results the observations made by P. T. BERTELLI on the relative microseismic intensity at Florence .
These are summarized for the interval December , 1872 , to November , 1887 , in his paper , " " Dell variazioni dei valori d'Intensita Trotnometrica relativa osservata alla Querce di Firenze dell ' anno meteorico 1872-73 al 1886-87.\ldquo ; Observations were made with two tromometers which are termed the " " old tromometer\ldquo ; and the " " normal tromo- meter\ldquo ; ; with the first for the whole period of 15 years , and with the second for the last 11 years .

The results obtained above for Italy are somewhat discordant .
We may conclude , however : ( 1 ) that the maximum of the annual seismic period occurs some time during the last three months of the year , and the maxima of the semi-annual period in April and October ; the amplitudes of both periods being approximately equal ; ( 2 ) that the maximum of annual period in the two volcanic districts occurs during the summer months ; and ( 3 ) that there is a marked annual microseismic period , with its maximum occurring at the end of December , the semi-annual microseismic period being comparatively very slight .

These figures show that , 011 an ayerage , at least 34 earthquakes were felt eyery year .
This number is , however , too small , for the number of shocks following the disastrous earthquake of October 30 , 1840 , was so great that M. BARBIANI found it impossible to record them all .
According to the report issued by the Lord High Commissioner , Sir HOWARD DOUGLAS , 95 shocks , some very severe , were felt between October 30 and November 4 .
M. BARBIANI gives estimate of the total number of shocks ( p. 103 ) , and in the next paragraph I have discussed the figures given by him .

M. estimate of the monthly number of shocks differs from the pre , owing to his including several slight shocks which he counted , without giving the time of occurrence of each , as well as to his estimate of the number of shocks in the early part of November , 1840 .
AND SEMI-ANNUAL SEISMIC PERIODS .
Thus , the effect of including these slighter shocks is to increase the amplitude of both periods , and to place the maximum epoch of the semi-annual period a month earlier .

Duration of record , 1859-1878 .
Number of earthquakes , 246 .
The list on which this discussion is founded is compiled from those given by SCHMIDT and FUCHS for the south-east of Europe .
The former extending from 1859 to 1878 , the latter from 1865 to 1884 , though not recording any shocks later than 1874 .
For the years 1859 to 1863 , SCHMIDT'S records , with only seven exceptions , are all taken from BARBIANI'S catalogue .
For the remainder of the tinle , SCHIIIDT and FUCHS do not seem to have made use of the same authorities , for their dates agree in only a compare .atively small number of cases .
Now , the average number of earthquakes felt in Zante every year is 348 or according to BARBIANI , and according to the list compifed and FUCHS ' catalogues .
M. BARBIANI'S catalogue may perhaps relate to a more than usually disturbed interval , but it was compiled by a resident in the island , and therefore probably includes a much greater number of slight shocks than ] other list .
This may account for the erence in the maximum epoch of the annual period ( see S17 ) .

From the end of 1875 until the present time , the earthquakes were all registered by instrumental means .
seismograph was used until April , 1885 , and the Gray-Milne seismograph after that date .
At the end of the year 1882 , observations were suspended during the removal of the instrument ; this year accordingly omitted .

During the remainder of the time it is evidently very incomplete , there being five years ( 1875 , 1877 , 1878 , 1881 , 1882 ) , without any disturbance recorded .
This deprives the list of much of its value for statistical purposes .
The figures for both periods are very irregular .

AND SEMI-ANNUAL ISMIC PERIODS .
82 .
Period.\mdash ; The number of seismic records examined is , 45 belonging to the northern hemisphere , 14 to the southern , and 3 to equatorial countries .
Only five fail to indicate a fairly well-marked annual period , namely , South-east Europe ( PERREY ) , East Indies ( BERGSMA ) , New Zealand , Districts .
and VI .
( HECTOR ) , and Chili ( FUCHS ) ; and in all these cases the failure may , I think , be attributed to incompleteness in the seismic record .
Different lists for the same district do not always give the same date the maximum epoch , though in most cases they agree closely enough .
The principal exceptions are Italy , Zante , Japan , West Indies , and the Southern Hemisphere ; and in the three first of these districts the discrepancy may , perhaps , be explained .
Excluding these somewhat doubtful cases , the distribution in time of the maximum epochs is given in the following table:\mdash ; MarchJanuary .
April . . . . .
1 May . . . . . .
1 1 2 June . . . . .
1 July .
3 These figures strongly support the view that the of the period occurs during the in hemIsphere .
The evidence for equatorial countries is somewhat scanty , but it shows that in also , there is a well-marked annual period .
If we were to include the two districts of India and Peru , Bolivia and Quito as equatorial , this conclusion will be further strengthened , the date of the maximum epoch being variable .
83 .
amplitude , the results given by different lists for the same districts are more variable ; and this is due in a great measure , I believe , to drfferent definitions of the.unit earthquake .
This is especially shown in three cases in which the periodicity has been investigated both with my own definition and with that adopted by the cataloguer ( SS45 , 46 , 59 , 60 , 76 , 77 ) .
The amplitude of the annual period ranges from ( New Zealand ) to 67 ( Sicily and Algeria ) .
The average amplitude obtained from records .
is sponding ratio of the number of shocks in the lmum and ves year is , or , roughly , 3 : 2 .
84 .
It will be seen , on examining the above tables , that the amplitude of the annual period is small in several countries which are generally regarded as earthquake countries .
In some cases , this is no doubt due to the definition of the unit earthquake .
Again , when the area is a wide one , the amplitude may be small , owing to the maximum epoch for different districts occurring at different dates .
Partly to this , perhaps , is due the apparently small amplitude in the Northern Hemisphere ( MALLET ) , Italy ( FUCHS ) , and New Zealand ( HECTOR and HOGBEN ) .
Lastly , the amplitude is small in some insular districts , for example , Japan and New Zealand ( or 06 ) .
85 .
.\mdash ; Of the 62 records examined , only three fail to show a fairly well.marked semi-annual period , namely , France ( FUCHS ) , Spain and Portugal RREY ) , and Chili ( FUCHS ) ; these failures also being probably due to incomplete- ness in the seismic record .
Different records for the same district do not always agree in giving the same epoch for the maximum of the semi-annual period ; for example , those of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres , Europe and the West Indies .
As a rule , however , the agreement is close .
And this is also especially true in the case of districts adjoining and overlapping one another ; for example , Austria , Hungary , and Switzerland and the Tyrol ( FUCHS ) ; South-east Europe ( PERREY , SCHMIDT ) and the Balkan Peninsula ; California , San Francisco , and San Jose and kSanta Clara ( HOLDEN ) ; India ( OLDHAM ) and the Malay Archipelago ( FUCHS ) ; the different districts of New Zealand ( HECTOR ) ; and also Tokio ( MILNE ) and Yokohama ( STREETS ) , for the short period 1878-1881 .
Excluding doubtful , the distribution in time of the maximum epochs is given in the following table:\mdash ; In New Zealand and the south-east of Australia , the maximum epoch falls most frequently in February or March , and August or September ; in North America it usually occurs in March or April and September or October .
I have not been able IIC RIODS .
to find any general rule in other cases , and it is possible that the terials are too imperfect to allow any law to be deduced .
86 .
The amplitude of the semi-annual period ranges from .
( Southern Hemisphere , FUCHS ) to 79 ( Mexico ) , the average value being24 .
In fifteen cases the amplitude of the semi-annual period is greater than that of the annual period , and in three others the amplitudes are equal ; the amplitude of the annual period in the former cases from05 to 43 , on an average being 19 .
It is worthy of notice that different talogues for the same district generally agree in this respect ; especially is this the case with the Balkan Peninsula , Zante , and the south-easb of Europe , and in New Zealand .
Moreover , eleven of these fifteen records include the following insular districts , which are among the most well-marked seismic regions in the world , namely , the Grecian Archipelago , Japan , the Malay , New Zealand , and the West Indies .
The average amplitude of the annual period in these cases is , and that of the semi-annual period ; that is , the average amplitude of the annual period is just half that of all the districts examined , while , in the case of the semi-annual period , the two average amplitudes are exactly the same .
* ORIGIN 0F THE ANNUAL SEISMIC PERIOD .
87 .
The most probable theory of the of the lnajority of non-volcanic earthquakes is that they are due to the impulsive friction occasioned by the slips which are the elements in the growth of faults .
These slips are due , in the first instance , to endogenic causes , and , were there no external phenomena of a periodic nature to affect them , would take place equally at all times of the year .
In nearly evel.y part of the world , however , there is a well-marked annual barometric period , the maximum epoch oyer the land-areas being somewhat variable , but occurring as a rule during winter .
The range , or double amplitude , is small , the maximum being about one inch , and in some districts less than one-tenth of an inch .
The distortion of the earth 's surface by parallel waves of barometric elevation and depression has been investig by Professor G. H. DARWIN .
The vertical displace meant is where the axis of is vertically downwards and the axis of horizontal and perpendicular to the barometric undulations , gravity , the modulus of rigidity , the * This phenomenon shows that the annual and semi-atlllua !
periods must have } irely d origins .
" " On Variations in the due to asticity of the 's Snrface ' Brit Assoc Repor , ' 1882 , pp. 106-119 ; 'Phil , Mag vol. 14 , 18 pp. 409--427 specific gravity of mercury , the maximum range of the barometer , and the wave-length of the barometric undulation .
To obtain an estimate of the maximum displacement at the surface , namely , , Professor DARWIN takes centims. , miles centims. , nearly , and which is equivalent to assuming that the rficial layers of the earth are more rigid than the most rigid glass .
With these data he finds the maximum displacement of the surface to be centims. , so that the ground is 9 centims. higher under the barometric than under the elevation .
The ratio of the vertical displacement at depth to that at the surface is or Thus , the displacement at first diminishes very slowly as the depth increases , and is independent of the modulus of idity and the barometric range ; , with the above value of , only one-fifth per cent. less at a depth of fifty miles than it is at the surface .
Now , since most or all earthquakes probably originate at a depth much less than this , and since the fault-slip which produces even a modsrately strong shock must be very small , for even in the most violent earthquakes it is rarely perceptible at the surface ; also , since the work to be done is , not the compression of solid rock , but the slight depression of a fractured mass of rock whose support is very nearly , but not quite , withdrawn ; on these accounts it seems possible that the annual variation in barometric pressure may be competent to produce the annual variation in seismic frequency .
It is not to be expected that the amplitude of the annual seismic period in different districts should be proportional to that of the annual barometric period ; but if there is a connection between the two periods the epoch of the seismic maximum should coincide with , or follow closely after , that of the barometric maximum .
88 .
Over the greater part of the northern hemisphere , the annual barometric maximum occurs as a rule either in November or Deceffiber , except at lofty stations or in high latitudes .
In Europe the maximum occurs nearly everywhere in November , except along the western border in latitudes north of about , over which the Atlantic conditions prevail for some distance nland .
In Asia the maximum is nearly always in December .
In North America it occurs in November and December , and along part of the western coast in January .
In the seismic districts of the Southern Hemisphere , the maximum occurs as a rule in the corresponding months : New Zealand in April , in the south-east of Australia in May or June , in South America in June or July , with some few exceptions in each case , depending either on the altitude or neighbourhood to the coast .
AND SEMI-ANNUAL ISMIC PERTODS .
89 .
Comparisons between the dates of the maximum epoclJs of the seismic and barometric annual periods can be made in thirty-one of the districts treated in this paper .
The epoch of the seismic maximum approximately coincides with that of the barometric maximum in ten districts , and follows it by about one month in , and by about two months in four district , .
In four others ( Japan , Tokio , India , California ) , the seismic epoch precedes the barometric by about two months ; but , in the first two of these at least , this may be due to the inclusion of slight shocks having their maximum in summer .
To the same cause , perhaps , may be due the four exceptional cases ( Scandinavia and Iceland , Great Britain , the district ronnd and including Vesuvius , and Sicily ) , though many of Vesuvian and Sicilian earthquakes are obviously of volcanic origin , and are probably more frequent with a low barometric pressure .
Thus , as a general rule , the epoch of seismic maximum either coincides with that of the barometric maximum , or follow it by a month or two .
If the epoch of the barometric or seismic maximum were constant in either hemisphere , this general agreement might not possess much significance , but it continues when the epochs vary .
For example , in the southern hemisphere , we have the following dates:\mdash ; Again , while both North and South America the maximum epochs of both periods fall in the winter months , in the Sandwich Islands lat. the epoch of the seismic maximum occurs in June , and that of the barometric maximum at Honolulu in April or May .
90 .
Lastly , supposing the view here suggested to be correct , the annual variation in barometric pressure cannot have any influence on seismic frequency when the earthquakes inate entirely beneath the sea ; for , as the barometric pressure changes , the sea will have time to take up its equilibrium position , and the total pressure on the sea-bottom will be unaltered .
Hence , if some of the earthquakes felt in a district originate beneath the sea and some beneath the land , the amplitude of the annual period will be less than it would be if all were to eath the land .
Qince some of the foci of the earthquakes felt in Japan and New Zealand known to lie beneath the ocean , it seems not improbable that the small ] amplitude of the annual period in these two , as well as in , insular districts ) thus accounted for .
