Determination of the North Polar Distances and proper Motion of Thirty fixed Stars .
By John Pond , Esq. Astronomer Royal , F.R.S. Read June 15 , 1815 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1815 , p. 384 .
] In the former catalogue which the Astronomer Royal gave in 1813 , he estimated the probable extent of error at not more than one fourth of a second ; and his present catalogue , which may be presumed to be improved by a greater number of observations , confirms the justness of that estimate ; since the greatest difference observable is not more than two tenths of a second .
A comparative catalogue is also given of the places of the same stars in 1756 , as deduced from the observations of Dr. Bradley ; and thence is added a column of annual proper motions for each of the stars in the collection .
