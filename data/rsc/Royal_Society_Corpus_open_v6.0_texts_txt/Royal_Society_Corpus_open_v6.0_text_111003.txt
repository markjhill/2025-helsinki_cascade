S. The author has devoted nearly four years to the investigation of the quantities of rain falling in the lake districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland ; and he commenced , two years ago , a set of experiments specially directed to ascertain the amount of rain deposited at great elevations above the sea , such as the summits of our highest English mountains .
As the investigation proceeded , some remarkable results were obtained , which coming to the knowledge of the Royal Society early in last year ( 1847 ) , the Council contributed a sum of money from the Donation Fund towards the current expenses attending this inquiry , of which the results are given in the present communication , comprising extensive tables of observations relative to the quantity of rain in different situations within the above period of time .
