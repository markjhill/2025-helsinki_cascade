In this Paper a method is given of developing the disturbing function , in which the coefficients of the inequalities corresponding to any given order , are expressed in terms of the coefficients of the inferior orders ; so that , for example , the coefficients of the terms in the dis ?
turbing function , multiplied by the squares of the eccentricities , are given analytically by means of the coefficients of those independent of the eccentricities , and of those multiplied by their first powers .
As the theorems , to which this method gives rise , are of great simplicity , the author considers them as deserving attention .
