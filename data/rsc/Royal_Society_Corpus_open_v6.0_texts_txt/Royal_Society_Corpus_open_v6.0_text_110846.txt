" On the production of Ozone by Chemical Means .
" By Pro .
fessor Shoenbein , in a letter to Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. Communicated by Dr. Faraday .
The author conceives that of the two gaseous principles which are simultaneously produced during the slow action of phosphorus upon atmospheric air , and which have opposite voltaic characters , that which exerts electro-positive properties is composed of vaporized phosphorus , conjoined with particles of phosphatic acid ; and the other , which is electro-negative , is identical with ozone , or the odoriferous principle which is disengaged at the positive electrode during the electrolysis of water .
His opinion is founded on the odour of the one not being distinguishable from that of the other .
