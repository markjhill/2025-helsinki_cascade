( Abstract .
) The object of this paper is to prove to meteorologists that they may apply , without misgiving , the results which the author has already announced , regarding the relation of aqueous vapour to radiant heat .
The author describes new experiments made with dry and humid air , first , with an experimental tube stopped by plates of rock-salt ; secondly , with an open experimental tube ; and thirdly , with an arrangement in which both the plates and the tube were abandoned dry air being caused to displace moist , and moist air dry , in the open atmosphere .
He considers and removes objections , and points out the bearing of his experiments on various questions in meteorology .
The formation of cumuli and the cause of the tropical rains are considered ; the effect which the absence of aqueous vapour must have upon climate is pointed out ; and the a priori conclusions to be drawn from the experiments are shown to agree with observation .
Reference is made to anomalies of observation which have been hitherto unexplained , but which admit of easy solution by reference to the radiant and absorbent power of aqueous vapour .
The author endeavours to supplement the views hitherto entertained regarding the action of mountain masses as condensers of the atmospheric moisture .
He accounts for the enormous radiation observed at great elevations , and concludes by showing the possible bearing of his results on the theory of " Serene " and of hail .
