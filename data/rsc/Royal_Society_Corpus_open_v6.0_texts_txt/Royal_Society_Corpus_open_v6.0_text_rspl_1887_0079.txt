The Influence of [ June 16 ; deeply furrowed in a plane parallel to the axis of rotation , so as to be shaped like a dumb-bell , and although this result can only be taken to represent the truth very roughly , yet it cannot be entirely explained by the imperfection of the analytical method employed .
It appears then as if the smaller body were on the point of separating into two masses , in the same sort of way that the Jacobian ellipsoid may be traced through the dumb-bell shape until it becomes two masses .
M. Poincare has commented in his paper on the possibility of the application of his results , so as to throw light on the genesis of a satellite according to the nebular hypothesis , and this investigation was undertaken with such an expectation .
He remarks , however , that the conditions for the separation from a mass , which is strongly concentrated at its centre , are necessarily very different from those which he has treated mathematically .
However , both his investigation and the considerations adduced here seem to show that , when a portion of the central body becomes detached through increasing angular velocity , the portion should bear a far larger ratio to the remainder than is observed in our satellites , as compared with their planets ; and it is hardly probable that the heterogeneity of the central body can make so great a difference in the results as would be necessary , if we are to make an application of these ideas .
It seems then at present necessary to suppose that after the birth of a satellite , if it takes place at all in this way , a series of changes occur which are still quite unknown .

( Abstract .
) The principal object of the investigation was to ascertain whether the values of the moduli of torsional and longitudinal elasticities , as determined by statical methods , would be the same as when determined by kinetical methods , provided the deformations produced were very small .
The method of determining the modulus of longitudinal elasticity statically has been already described.* This method was applied with * ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1883 , Part I. 1887 .

The wires of copper , silver , and platinum were obtained from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey as chemically pure .
The same wires were also tested for the value of the modulus of longitudinal elasticity by the method of longitudinal vibrations .
In this method the wires were fixed at both ends , and corrections , which are fully described in the paper , were made for the want of rigidity in the supports at the ends .
The same method served for determining the velocity of sound in the metals piano-steel , iron , copper , German-silver , platinum-silver , silver , and platinum , with considerable accuracy .

The general results of the whole investigation may be expressed as follows :\#151 ; 1 .
The value of the modulus of longitudinal elasticity for hard-drawn metals , as determined by the statical method of loading , accords with the value obtained by the method of longitudinal vibrations , provided the deformations are sufficiently small .
2 .
The velocity of sound in a metal wire is independent of the load on the wire .
3 .
The velocity of sound in a metal wire is not sensibly altered by permanent extension of the wire .
4 .
The value of the modulus of torsional elasticity , as determined by the statical method , accords with the value obtained by the method of torsional vibrations for most metals in the hard-drawn condition , provided the deformations produced are small .
For annealed iron the value of the modulus obtained by the second method slightly exceeds that obtained by the first method , and by an amount which is greater than can be attributed either to the heating and cooling effects of contraction and expansion , or to errors of observation .
