Elements of Captain Hall 's Comet .
By J. Brinkley , D.D. F.R.S. and M.R.I.A. and Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin .
In a Letter addressed to W. H. Wollaston , M.D. V.P.R.S. Read January 10 , 1822 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1822 , p. 50 .
] Dr. Brinkley remarks that the comet observed by Captain Hall is interesting to astronomers on account of its small perihelion distance , for there are only three , out of 116 , in M. Delambre 's catalogue , that pass nearer to the sun .
On the 8th of April it was distant from the earth 1-41 , and on the 3rd of May , 2*64 , the sun 's distance from the earth being unity .
Dr. Brinkley also remarks that it is probably the same comet that was observed in 1593 ; it agrees with that in its small perihelion distance , and great inclination .
Of that comet , the inclination was 88 ?
, and the perihelion distance '089 ; of this , the inclination is 106ยง 44 ' , and its perihelion distance -093 .
To the proximity of this comet to the sun , when on the north side of the ecliptic , in February and March last , before it passed its perihelion , Dr. Brinkley -attributes its having escaped European observers .
It was never more than a few degrees from the sun , and therefore could not have been visible .
The author then points outl the unusual circumstances relative to this comet , which have involved the computation of its elements in difficulties not often met with , and which induce him to request Dr. Wollaston to lay the method by which he proceeded before the Royal Society .
