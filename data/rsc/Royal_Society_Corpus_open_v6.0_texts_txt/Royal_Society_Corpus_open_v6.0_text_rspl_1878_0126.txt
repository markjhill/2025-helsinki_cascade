Although lactin , or sugar of milk , has been investigated by nume-hetnists there are many problems connected with it which still r0ttS , fC lution .
We have accordingly undertaken a series of experi-a nts in connexion with this remarkable compound , in the hope , not l f obtaining special results , but such as may be made available ft studies of a more general nature .
As our work throughout has been for the most part optical as well as chemical , we have first to state our methods of obtaining the constant of Jellett 's ' polarimeter , the instrument employed in our investigations .

Three sets of experiments on solutions containing respectively 16*3500 , 8*1750 , and 4*0875 grms. in 100 cub. centims. , and embracing five , four , and four readings , gave a general mean reading 21'*74 , equivalent to a specific rotation 66'*48 .
This is to the generally accepted number ( 73'*8 ) as 1 to 1*11011 .

Two sets of experiments with solutions containing respectively 4*9156 and 2*4578 grms. in 100 cub. centims. , and each embracing three readings , gave a general mean reading 4'*92 , equal to a specific rotation 50'*046 .
Bouchardatf gives 55''832 , which is to the number got by Jellett 's instrument as 1*11561 to 1 .
The average of the three numbers , 1*10096 , 1*11011 , and 1*11561 , gives 1*10889 as an experimental factor for converting our Jellett readings into ordinary readings .
The relation of the two scales may also be seen by examining the arc divided to read percentages of cane sugar with a solution containing 16*35 grms. in 100 cub. centims. In the Jellett instrument , an arc of 21'*666 is divided into hundredths for this purpose ; and as 16*35 grms. pure cannose read 100 on this scale , the specific rotation * " Count .

[ Jan. 23 is 66'-256 , which is to 73'-8 as 1 to 111386\#151 ; a factor which differ from the above experimental one by 045 per cent. All the specific rotations given by ns are corrected by this factor , and are comparable with those in general use .
In all our experiments the specific rotation is calculated by tht formula Where [ o]= specific rotation , a = the reading h degrees , V the volume of solution containing the weight and l = the length of the column in decimeters ( in the above experiments 2 ) .

The number given by Berthelot* is 59'*3 .
In every experiment , care was taken that the rotatory power of the solution had i become constant .
Three different samples of lactin were employed .
Experiments ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , were on sample I , ( 4 ) on sample II , and ( 5 ) on sample III .
As the samples were prepared at different times , and by a method varying slightly each time , the very small differences in the results show that the lactin contained little or no impurity .
III .
Examination of the Law for the Change of Potation in a freshly I prepared Solution of Lactin.\#151 ; If the rotatory power of an aqueous j solution of lactin be examined at short intervals of time , it soon I becomes apparent that a change is taking place , the angle through which the plane of polarization is rotated becoming gradually less .
The object of the following experiments is to quantify the phenomenon j in question .
Five grms. of lactin were dissolved as rapidly as possible ( time c taken , 1 hour 15 minutes ) in cold water , and the solution made up to 100 cub. centims. The polarimeter tube ( 2 decims .
long ) was filled with the liquid , and a first observation taken 15 minutes after complete solution , or 1^ hour after first contact .

] me made at intervals of 2 hours , the results being given under table I , No. 21 .
See Table I. -J In order to increase the total change and lessen proportionally the lat error of experiment , it became necessary to use a stronger solution , to ^increase the length of column , and to reduce the interval elapsing ''between first contact and first observation as far as possible .
To i t attain these conditions the following method was adopted:\#151 ; About -*'10 grms. of powdered lactin were rubbed in a mortar with about * 60 cub. centims. of water for half an hour , the solution filtered , and a the first observation taken one hour after first contact .
The metal jijtabe belongingto the polariscope was also discarded , and a glass one .
constructed from a piece of tubing 17 millims. wide , by sealing on a side piece for the introduction of a thermometer , and grinding the ends carefully until it measured 242 millims. , the greatest length admitted by the polarimeter .
Two glass disks were cemented on the extremities , and the tube covered from end to end by a helix of thin tin tubing , through which a current of water might be passed to keep the temperature constant ; to guard further from variations in temperature the tube was covered with cotton wadding .
With these precautions three experiments were made ( Table I , Nos. 1 , 2,3 ) , the result being that the total change was nearly doubled .
In all the other experiments the method was slightly varied , the lactin being placed in a bottle with a ground glass stopper , 60 cub. centims. water placed on it , and the whole shaken vigorously at intervals for half an hour , filtered , and the first observation taken as before .
Each experiment extended over six hours , and included ten observations .
For each observation three or four readings were made , and the average taken .
In Nos. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , of the accompanying table , varying weights of sodic and potassic chloride were introduced .
In every experiment the thermometer was read at the same time with the rotation ; and .
the average temperature , as well as its extreme variation , is given in the table .
That the different experiments might be compared , we have expressed them by the equation\#151 ; y=a+hx+ca58 , in which y is the angle of rotation , x the time in half-hours , counting from the first contact of the lactin with water , and a , b , and c , are constants .
The values of a , 6 , and c , were calculated by the method of least squares .
In Table II are given the equations , accompanied by the probable error of a single comparison of the calculated and experimental values 'f y. The sum of the \#177 ; actual errors is in nearly all cases zero .

An increase of temperature evidently hastens the change ; but the exact relation of temperature to the rate of change has not been discovered .
The presence of sodic or potassic chloride increases the amount of lactin in solution , but has no apparent effect on the rate of change .

Action of Hydric Nitrate on Lactin.\#151 ; We made an attempt to trace this action , but did not succeed in overcoming experimental difficulties .
The first of these was the impossibility of completing the action with the quantity of acid required for the first change .

By addii the acid in small successive portions , we nevertheless succeeded obtaining an outline of the reaction , of which the curve drawn belc is an accurate general expression .

Dubrunfaut , who has also examined this action , * asserts that tl rotatory power first rises to -j-o of the original amount , then fal gradually to zero , again rises to ^ of the original rotation , and one more falls to zero : the highest rotation corresponding to galactosi the first point of inactivity to mucic acid ; the second rise probably i dextro-tartaric acid ; and the second fall to the formation of oxali acid .
Our experiments show the formation of a laevo-rotatory sub stance , perhaps laevo-tartaric acid .
The general form of the curv constitutes it an interesting and novel addition to chemical curves .
V. Note on Solubility.\#151 ; The mutual relations of water and lactin ii solution undergo a change upon which the change of rotation mos probably depends .
Water shaken with a large quantity of very finel ; powdered lactin at a temperature of 17 ' C. , takes up a quantity o lactin corresponding to a solubility of 1 part lactin in 10 64 part water .
With four hours ' contact , the solubility increases to 1 par lactin in 7'49 parts water .
The permanent solubility got by thi analysis of the mother-liquor of lactin crystallized over oil of vitriol ii 1 part lactin in 3'23 parts water .
In the solution of the lactin a fal of temperature of 0o,45 C. was observed .
Pohlf also found a de pression of temperature ( 0''88 C. ) ; while Dubrunfaut alleges thai heat is evolved .

( Abstract .
) In this paper the author reviews the work done by chemists and He physicists in determining the relation between the chemical composi-a I lion of a liquid and its rate of flow through a capillary tube .
Poiseui lie * \#171 ; oa iscertained , in a very accurate manner , all the physical laws relating kto co the rate of flow , as regulated by temperature , pressure , and dimen-iNri sions of the tube ; but on examining saline solutions he could make on nothing of *the numbers presented , because he used percentage solutions Tilt instead of solutions proportional to the equivalent of the body dissolved , c\#174 ; Graham , f noticing that Poiseuille had discovered a hydrate of alcohol by running various mixtures of alcohol and water through the tube , .tin !
examined mixtures of the various acids with water , and found that the ml hydration proceeded by distinct steps of multiple proportions .
Several Sml others , notably Guerout , J have since worked on the same subject , but jtrj as they have only worked on organic liquids , and have done all the pail rates at the same temperature , the results throw no light on the phe-pjt nomena .
Thus water runs about five times as quickly at 100 ' as at .
tii 0 ' ; and in a series of alcohols , such as Guerout experimented upon , jj the differences between their boiling points were very great , so that , ji their vapour tensions or molecular mobilities being quite incomparable , jt while at the same temperature , the experiments do not admit of any jj| real interpretation .
The author reserves the organic part of the investigation , which requires the determination of vapour tensions , till a future paper , and in the present deals with saline solutions .
