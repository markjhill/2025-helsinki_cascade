) ( Abstract .
) In the present determination of the surface-tension of water the method of jet-vibration proposed by Lord Rayleigh is used ; this method has the fundamental advantage that a perfectly fresh new-formed surface can be examined .
In the theoretical part of this investigation it is shown how Lord Rayleigh 's theory of infinitely small vibrations of a jet of a non-viscid liquid can be supplemented by corrections for the influence of the finite amplitudes as well as for the viscosity .
In the experimental part it is shown how it seems to be possible , in a simple manner , to secure that the jet-piece used for the measurements satisfies the assumptions on which the theoretical development rests .
As the final result of the experiments , the author finds the surface-tension of water at 12 ' to be 73*23 dine / cm .
