] Part II.\#151 ; THE DISCHARGE IN EXHAUSTED TUBES .
We cannot flatter ourselves that we have done more during our three-and-a-half years ' work than contribute a few facts towards the data necessary for the solution of the problem , " What is the cause of the beautiful phenomenon of stratification produced by electric discharges in vacuum tubes ?
" which , having been first noticed by M. Abria in 1843 , was independently re-observed by Mr. ( now Sir William ) Grove in 1852,1 * These researches have been prosecuted independently and without the knowledge of much that has been done by other workers in the same field .
Subsequently to the communication of this memoir we have diligently searched the papers of other physicists , and have extracted from them many interesting passages which , by permission of the Council of the Royal Society , we have added in the form of footnotes at various parts of the paper .
As it is quite possible that some papers may have escaped our notice , a list of those consulted is given in the Appendix , note A. Mascart , in his valuable ' Traite d'Electricite Statique , ' t. ii .
, pp. 128-141 , 1876 , has given a succinct account of the phenomena of the discharge in vacuum tubes , and the various hypotheses which have been proposed to account for them .
f Gassiot ( Bakerian Lecture , Phil. Trans. , 1858 , pp. 1-16 ) gives the following history of the stratified discharge:\#151 ; " The striated condition of the electric discharge in vacuo which takes place when the terminal wires are inserted in a well exhausted receiver in which a small piece of phosphorus has been previously placed , was first announced by Mr. Grove in his communication to the Royal Society , 7th January , 1852 ; his paper is printed in the first part of the Transactions for that year , and was subsequently published in the Phil. Mag. , December , 1852 , with a supplementary note , dated 9th June , wherein Mr. Grove states ' that he found the transverse dark bands could be produced in other gases when much attenuated , probably in all .
' " The phenomena of stratification in the discharge in vacuo were subsequently observed in Paris by Ruhmkorff , who obtained the effect by using the vapour of alcohol ; they were again noticed by Masson , Du Moncel , Quet , and other continental electricians , who all describe the intense white light without stratification produced in the barometrical vacuum .
" It appears , however , that Grove was anticipated by Abria ( Ann. de Chim .
vii .
, 1843 , pp. 477-478 ) , who , experimenting with the secondary current of an induction coil , obtained in air at a pressure of 2 m.m. , in an exhausted receiver , a brush-discharge from the positive ( a ball ) which did not quite reach the x 2 and has since engaged the attention of so many physicists .
Our excellent and highly esteemed friend the late Mr. Gassiot , working at first with an induction coil , but more recently on the same lines as ourselves ( voltaic batteries of high potential-5 ' ) , has published results of great interest , many of which are confirmed by our own experience ; while , on the other hand , we have enjoyed pleasurable intercourse and exchange ot thought with our contemporary , Mr. W. Spottiswoode , who is still pursuing with great acumen and originality a similar investigation , both with the induction coil and the Holtz machine , with which he has recently used condensers of great capacity , like those we employ and have described in Part I. If we arrive at the same results by different paths , the one investigation will support the other , and for each may be claimed more reliance than if unconfirmed .
Throughout our labours we have felt so strongly the necessity of obtaining numerical results as data for the foundation of a theory , that we have not hesitated to risk much in this cause .
By the fusion of terminals , or the sudden discharge of the condenser , we have lost a vast number of very beautiful tubes ; but gradually , by the adoption of various devices , and by the employment of instruments specially constructed and insulated to suit the high potentials we deal with , we have succeeded in overcoming the various impediments , so that we can now readily obtain values for the physical quantities that enter into consideration in our experiments .
There is a serious trouble connected with the study of the discharge in rarefied gases , for , after a very short time , the tubes completely and permanently change , so as no longer to present the splendid stratifications witnessed on a first trial .
We believe these changes occur much more rapidly with the battery , in consequence of the greater amount of current , than with the induction coil ; but the fact appears to be well known to Dr. Geissler , of Bonn , who , on the occasion of a visit to our laboratory , brought with him some tubes through which no current had previously passed ( virgin tubes , as he calls them ) , which presented most beautiful phenomena lost for ever after too brief a period .
Tube 123 ( Cyanogen ) , for example , when first connected with the battery , presented strata which completely filled the tube without leaving a dark space near the negative , negative ( a point ) , where there was a dark interval : he says , " De plus , cette flamme ou aigrette qui part du pole positif present notamment a sa party superieure ( en supposant la point negative en haut ) des zones alternativement obscures et lumineuses .
Ces zones sont concaves verse la boule quand la point ( negative ) est rapproch.ee de cette derniere ; else deviennent convexes verse la boule lorsque la point en est tres-eqartee .
" * Mr. Gassiot made several batteries of different kinds in the course of his experiments ; on the occasion of a visit to his laboratory , January 26 , 1875 , the current of his Leclanche battery was measured by us with a voltameter .
The current of 1000 new cells was found to be 0'07464 w ; that of the whole 3000 cells , 1000 of which had been a long time in use , 0'04718 W. Taking the Leclanche as 1'48 volt the internal resistance of the new battery must have been 19'83 ohms per cell ; that of the whole 3000 , 31-37 ohms per cell .
The striking distance of the whole 3000 between a conical point and a disc 0'125 inch diameter was only 0'025 inch ; whence the inference is that the insulation was , at that time , imperfect .

157 some threading themselves on it , as shown on the left of fig. 33 ; but after a lieu seconds the strata widened out as on the right-hand figure , then other changes occurred , and .
the first phases have never been reproduced .

Another case is presented by the nitrogen tube fig. 34 , the right-hand figure showing the first phase , and the left-hand figure a second phase , which in its turn has for ever disappeared , and has been replaced by the ordinary disc-form of strata .
Fig. 34 .
After spending much time in experiments with tubes prepared for us by Dr. Geissler , Messrs. Alvergniat Frkres , of Paris , and Mr. Hicks , of Hatton Garden , with the vexation of finding that we could not often enough repeat our experiments , we ultimately came to the conclusion to have others made , but not exhausted , and to perform ourselves the charging and exhaustion.'* The tubes we usually employ have a glass stop-cock fitted to them at each end ; they are 32 inches long , and from 1'75 to 2 inches in diameter ; the terminals are of aluminium , and about 29 inches apart , one being a ring , the other a wire bent at a light angle , so as to point in the direction of the axis of the tube ( see No. 144 , fig. 37 ) , for we have found that the phenomena vary according as the ring or wire is made positive .
These we exhaust and fill with any gas we may wish to experiment with , and gradually exhaust again , noting the phenomena presented at different pressures , different potentials , and with different amounts of current .
We re-fill and exhaust the tube again and again , and mostly obtain , under the same conditions , as nearly as possible the same phenomena , of which we are careful to make sketches and , if possible , to obtain photographic records .
In some cases we make use of tubes provided with a calibrated chamber between two stop-cocks , as a\#151 ; b , No. 145 , fig. 37 , the chamber in this particular case having a 2*oo^1 of the capacity of the tube .
After a tube has been exhausted so as to * Gassiot was driven to the same conclusion ; he says , in speaking of Geissler 's tubes : " I reluctantly laid them aside , and for all experiments I have to describe each tube was charged and exhausted by myself or in my presence , " produce a particular phase , and in the course of the experiment the exhaustion has been carried beyond that degree which permits of the production of that phase , one or more charges of gas may be successively admitted into the tube by filling the calibrated chamber with gas at any particular pressure , and then opening the stop-cock communicating with the tube ; the lost phase is thus reproduced .
The apparatus which we have found it advantageous to adopt for the exhaustion of our tubes is shown in fig. 35 ; it comprises three means of exhaustion which are successively employed as the vacuum becomes more perfect , The first is an Alvergniat Fig. 35 .
high-pressure water trompe in connexion with the high-pressure water-main of the West Middlesex Water Company , the head of water being 106 feet ; it produces a vacuum to within half-an-inch ( 0'47 in .
= 12 millims. ) of the height of the barometer .
The pipe leading to it is so marked in the drawing ; it is attached , through a cock , to a four-way-junction-piece F , provided with three more cocks , communicating :\#151 ; one to one end of the tube T , one to the last drying bottle of the gas generator G G/ and one to a mercurial gauge .
The other end of the vacuum tube T communicates by means of a Y-piece to both , an Alvergniat mercurial pump , on the right of the figure , and a Sprengel pump , on the left .
After the trompe has done its work , the Alvergniat is used for rapid exhaustion , and then shut off by means of the glass cock C , ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE O SILVER BATTERY .
159 leaving ' the exhaustion to be completed by the Sprengel ; we have thus obtained , by the pumps alone , in tubes 32 inches long and 2 inches in diameter , vacua of* only 0'002 millimetre pressure , equal to 2'6 millionths of an atmosphere \#151 ; a vacuum so perfect that the current of 8040 cells would not pass .
The apparatus is in connexion with a McLeod gauge , * by means of which pressures to 0'00005 m.m. can be determined .
Besides this gauge , the Sprengel and Alvergniat pumps have their own gauges , which read to a millimetre .
M is a rotating mirror consisting of a foursided prism mounted on a horizontal axis and provided with a multiplying wheel ; on each face of the prism is fastened a piece of looking-glass .
The reflection of the tube in the mirror enables one to examine whether an apparently nebulous discharge consists really of strata , also whether and in what direction there is a flow of strata which may appear quite steady to the eye .
The observations are facilitated by covering the tube with a half cylinder of cardboard having a slit in the direction of its axis about yqinch wide .
B is a radiometer attached to the Sprengel ; d , d , a drying tube containing sticks of potash used when gas is introduced from a reservoir through the Alvergniat .
In fig. 37 , to which is attached a scale of feet and inches to enable a judgment to be formed of their dimensions , tubes of various forms are represented .
It will presently be seen that the resistances of these tubes bear no exact relation to the distance between the terminals , but that it is affected greatly by the bore of the tube ; the small spectrum-analysis tubes , 83 , 93 , and 95 , a portion of which has a capillary bore , offer generally great resistance to the battery current , while much longer tubes , 1 and 2 , of larger bore , offer far less .
In order to test how much of this depends on the length of the constriction , we had made two tubes , 154 and 155 , fig. 36 , of nearly the same length , 16 inches , and internal Fig. 36 .

The distances between the several terminals of tube 154 are respectively between * ( Phil. Mag. , Aug. 1874 .
) When the mercury cistern is raised , a portion of gas at the same pressure as that in the tube is shut oil ' at b , and compressed in the small graduated chamber , at the top of the bulb , to different degrees , in our gauge , from t 8 3~ to , a 5 ' , according as the gas is less or more rarefied ; the mercury at the same time rises in the pressure column , p , and its height affords the means of determining the pressure of the gas in the tube .

and x 4*375 inches , between x and y 5*75 inches , and between y and z 4*25 inches ; the length of the constricted part being 3*75 inches , and its diameter 0*125 inch .
The distances for tube 155 are respectively between and x 5*25 inches , between x and y 2*375 inches , and between y and z 5*25 inches ; the constricture in this case is a glass diaphragm 0*03 inch thick with a hole 0*125 inch in diameter .
The following results were obtained from observations made January 25th , 1878 :\#151 ; Terminal z-\- ; terminal w\#151 ; ( to Earth ) .

It is evident , therefore , that the main effect is due to the simple constricture of the tube .
Among the tubes depicted in the diagram fig. 37 , only the following require any special allusion being made to them in this place :\#151 ; Tube 145 has at the right hand a chamber for holding an absorbent substance ( spongy palladium , charcoal ) ; the vertical tube is for connexion with the pump , and the left hand small tube for connexion with the supply of gas ; by using spongy palladium with hydrogen , a vacuum has been obtained in which 11,000 cells could not produce a current.* Tube 19 is one of the so-called induction tubes , the tube enclosing one of the wires ending in a closed chamber ( a globe ) surrounded by that portion of the tube enclosing the other terminal , so that there is not any continuous gas space from one terminal to the other .
Tube 81 has a carbonic acid vacuum , with an absorption chamber containing hydrate of potash , which produces so good a vacuum that the current from 11,000 cells will not pass continuously , but there is a flash of light on making contact in one direction but not in the other .
Tube 143 is a tube so thoroughly exhausted that a spark from an induction coil will not pass between two terminals only 0*1 of an inch apart , although of sufficient tension to jump across the wires outside the tube several inches distant ; this communicates with a radiometer .
* Gassiot ( Phil. Trans. , 148-150 ) describes several " non-conducting vacua " produced by absorbing substances ( caustic potash , and chloride of calcium ) .

The diagram , fig. 38 , shows the arrangement by which , in our earlier experiments , we measured the resistance of a tube .
The tell-tale tube ' ' ' had to be substituted for the galvanometer in the ordinary Wheatstone bridge , as the difference of potential between C and D fluctuated greatly in the course of the experiment , causing violent swings of the needle , t A Z is the battery , the A terminal of which is connected at A ' , in the bridge arrangement , with two equal fluid resistance tubes , Fit and Fit ' , of 420,000 ohms , placed in vessels containing ice , to keep them at a constant temperature ; an adjustable coil resistance is inserted between B and D ; the tube T T ' , to be tested , is placed * A tube selected for the readiness with which it permits the passage of a current of 440 cells , t Proc.

between D and C , the Z terminal of the battery being connected to D. When the resistance is greater or less than that of the tube to be tested there is an illumination in the detector tube between B and C ; but when a current passes in T T , balanced by a proper adjustment of the coil resistance , then the glow in the detector ceases .
It was ultimately found that the detector tube might be suppressed because , as Eig .

B soon as the resistance in B D is a little in excess of that of the tube , the latter gives evidence by its illumination of the current passing .
After the current in a tube has commenced it is generally found that it will continue to glow , even when some of the balancing resistance , B E\gt ; , is plugged out in the coil box , showing that when once started the working resistance becomes less .
If , on the other hand , the current has been stopped entirely , it requires generally a greater balancing resistance in the coil box between B D to start it again than it did in the first instance .
After standing for a short or long time it regains its normal condition , but the interval required may amount to several days .

We not only save time in this way , but obtain the resistance at the actual moment of the occurrence of any particular phase .
From measurements thus made with a tube having several wires about 1 inch apart ( No. 25 , fig. 37 ) , or a Spottiswoode tube* with a shifting terminal ( No. 147 , figs. 39 and 40 ) , we found that the resistance of a vacuum tube , unlike that of a wire , does not increase in the ratio of the distance between the terminals for the same gas at the same pressure . !
* Recently , by permission of Mr. Spottiswoode , we have bad made tube Ho. 147 , with the ingenious arrangement , suggested by his assistant Mr. P. Ward , of a movable terminal , attached to a spiral of fine copper wire , which permits of its being brought into actual contact with the opposite terminal , or placed at any required distance from it ; this tube is marked out into eight equal spaces by slips of paper pasted outside .

The degree of exhaustion of these two tubes is not known , but the internal pressure is , probably , less than 1 millimetre .
In making these experiments it was noticed that the resistance for equal distances appeared to be greater in proximity with the negative pole than in other parts of the tube , and fresh experiments were in consequence undertaken to ascertain the potential at the several rings by means of a delicate Thomson- Becker quadrant electrometer furnished with an induction plate , I , fig. 41 , which may be adjusted to any required distance from the quadrant beneath it .
The tubes employed among others were No. 25 , described above , and two other longer tubes , namely , No. 149 ( C02 ) with 12 rings 2 inches apart , and No. 150 ( C02 ) with 17 rings also 2 inches distant .
The current was led through a metallic resistance to the first ring , the last ring and the other pole of the battery being to earth .
It was found that the greatest difference of potential occurs between the last ring and the last but one on the negative side , the next greatest difference being between the last and the last but the influence cf distance between the terminals varied according to the degree of rarefaction .
For instance , he joined , side by side , two similar tubes , in which the distances between the terminals were relatively 12 : 1 , and exhausted them together .
The two terminals of the one tube were connected respectively to the two terminals of the other , and a galvanometer could be thrown into the circuit of either tube .
He found that at notable pressures the discharge was exclusively across the smaller space : but at 0*5 m.m. his galvanometer did not show any difference in the currents which traversed the two tubes .
Schultz ( Pogg .
Ann. cxxxv .
, 1868 , pp. 249-260 ) states that about that pressure which requires least difference of potential to produce discharge , the influence of distance between the electrodes is such that this difference of potential varies nearly in direct proportion to this distance ; but when rarefaction is carried beyond that point , and the difference of potential necessary to produce discharge rapidly increases , the influence of distance between electrodes rapidly becomes inappreciable .

165 one on the positive side , but the difference in the former case is far greater than in the latter ; in some cases there is little or no difference in the last but one and the last but two on the negative side ; in these cases the last but one on the negative side was dark , * while all the others had a luminosity about them .
The difference of potential between the rest of the rings is sensibly uniform .
The following observations , made December 21st , 1877 , with tube 150 , may be taken as an illustration of the method of measurement adopted .
Batteries 6 and 7 ( 2400 rod cells ) were employed , and adjustable resistances were inserted in circuit for the double purpose of affording the means of readily varying the strength of current without interruption , and of enabling a measurement of that current to be made with the electrometer .
The connexions are shown in the diagram , fig. 41 .

As these batteries had but small internal resistance , the difference between these two readings was scarcely perceptible .

The current was then reversed and similar observations were made .
Next* for the purpose of making a better examination of the tube in detail , the induction plate I was lowered to that distance which gave as large a deflection for the difference of potential between the two ends of the tube as was convenient .
After the potentials of the several rings had been measured in succession with both currents , the induction plate was restored to its original position , and one or two of the first observations were repeated for confirmation .
The current was then varied by altering the resistance in circuit , " ' ' and fresh measurements made in the same order .

This was caused by torsion in the suspension arising from an imperfection in the arrangement of the instrument not at that time discovered .
This does not , however , sensibly affect the following deductions :\#151 ; In case I. we have for the currents in Webers\#151 ; C4 fW ) X 2400X1-03 ^ w , -i^r X 2400 X 1 '03 160 =0-0007261 , and ( j\#151 ; = 194 .

These differences of potential would be reproduced if for the tube were substituted metallic resistances in ohms ( R)\#151 ; ( C+ ) R=WX 1,000,000 = 2,383,000 , and ( C \#151 ; ) R=W X 1,000,000= 1,954,000 .

W.DE LA RUE AND H. W. MULLER ON THE Selecting the observations with the current positive in each case and placing these in j uxtaposition thus\#151 ; c Y II Case I. 0-0007261 1730 2,383,000 " II .
0*0003674 1756 4,780,000 we see that when C is varied in the ratio of 2:1 , V remains sensibly constant , E varying as 1:2 ; that is to say , though the current is halved the difference of potential between the ends of the tube remains constant\#151 ; a condition which could only be brought about when metallic resistance is substituted for the tube , by doubling this resistance .
This points to the important conclusion that other things being Jcept constant and the current alone varied , we should find the value of V strictly constant for all values of C ; but it may readily be imagined that in experiments with ' vacuum tubes ' it is not easy to ensure perfect constancy of the accompanying circumstances .
To test this conclusion we extended the range of our observations by varying the value of C as much as from 1 to 135 .
We give below the original measurements themselves , not the mean results , in order that the discrepancies in the readings obtained for Y when C was kept as constant as our powers of control permitted , may be compared with the variations , such as they are , in the values of Y when the circuit was purposely varied so as to produce currents of different strengths .
These observations show clearly that discharge through rarefied gases cannot be at all analogous to conduction through metals ; for a wire having a given difference of potential between its ends can permit one\#151 ; and only one\#151 ; current to pass ; whereas , we see from the following measurements that with a given difference of potential between the terminals of a given vacuum tube , currents of strengths varying from 1 to 135 can flow .
We are therefore led to the conclusion that the discharge in a vacuum tube does not differ essentially from that in air and other gases at ordinary atmospheric pressures\#151 ; that it is , in fact , a disruptive discharge/ " ' Fig. 42 .

By fixing small rings of tinfoil to the glass near the places where the metal terminals are fused into the tube and connecting these rings to earth , we were able to cut oft the leakage over the surface ( which , in spite of precautions , is considerable , ) and prevent it from interfering with our measurements of the potential of the gas inside the tube .
The condition of the outside of the tube appears to have been the subject of much investigation by other observers : our experience points to the absolute necessity of cutting off leakage in order to obtain correct information concerning induced charges on the outside of the tube .
In a paper published in 1870 ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. vol. xix .
p. 237 ) , Mr. C. F. Varley stated : " The following laws were found to govern the passage of the current:\#151 ; 1st , each " tube requires a certain potential to leap across ; 2nd , a passage for the current having " been once established a lower potential is sufficient to continue the current ; 3rd , " if the minimum potential , which will maintain a current through the tube , be P , and " the power be varied to P+1 , P+2 , \amp ; c. to P+n , the current will vary in strength , " as 1 , 2 , \amp ; c. n. . . .
It thus appears that a certain amount of power is necessary to " spring across the vacuum ; after that it behaves as an ordinary conductor , excluding " that portion of the battery whose potential is P , and which is used to balance " the opposition of the tube .
" Laws 1 and 2 are confirmed by our daily experience , but the experiments which then led Mr. Varley to the conclusion that , with a certain reservation , a " vacuum ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
171 tube " behaves as an ordinary conductor , lend themselves as additional proof of the constancy of the difference of the potentials of the terminals of the tube .
The essential part of Mr. Varley 's arrangement being a battery , of internal resistance joined by a resistance It to one terminal of a tube , the other terminal of which is connected to the other pole of the battery , then if P be the difference of potential produced by the battery , and P the constant difference of potential between the ( P 1 7l ) \#151 ; P terminals of the tube , the current must vary as \#151 ; 'r , if R be kept constant and large enough to render variations in r negligible , C varies as From these results recently obtained , it follows that what , in the following account of experiments of earlier date , is termed the " resistance of a tube , " must not be considered as analogous to metallic resistance : it indicates merely that the difference of potential between the terminals of the tube was the same as that between the ends of a wire of the given resistance when substituted for the tube in the particular circuit .
The History of some Tubes .
No. 129 , Hydrogen , We now give an account of the very great variety of phenomena presented by the same tube charged with hydrogen , No. 129 , under different conditions of exhaustion when used in connexion with batteries of various potentials , and traversed by currents of different strengths .
This tube is 32 inches long and 1*6 inch in diameter , the terminals are a bent wire and a ring , about 1 inch in diameter , both of aluminium ; it is furnished with a glass stop-cock at each end as represented in fig. 37 , No. 144 .
The glass stop-cocks are connected with the mercurial pumps ( Alvergniat and Sprengel ) and with the gas generator respectively , as shown in fig. 35 .
During the course of the experiments about to be described several casualties occurred to the tube ; for example , the partial fusion and distortion , first of the ring , then of the bent wire terminal ; and by an accident the glass cocks were broken off and reattached .
Notwithstanding these accidents , the same phenomena were again and again obtained under like conditions .
The experiments with 129 were commenced on July 1 , 1876 ; great precautions were taken to thoroughly rinse out the air by completely exhausting the tube and filling it with dry hydrogen several times .
The hydrogen was obtained by the solution of very pure rod zinc , like that used for the batteries , in diluted pure sulphuric acid in the proportion of 1 part of acid to 10 of water .
It was dried by pumice moistened with sulphuric acid , and then with rods of hydrate of potash .

The current of 1080 powder cells would not pass , but that of 1200 rod cells did so , producing strata , and the peculiar discharge entering the negative ring , as shown at , fig. 43 , ( C. ) 0*007631 W , with 200,000 ohms external resistance , ( C. ) 0*003414 W , there were 25 strata 300,000 " yy ( C. ) 0*002675 W , " 24 " .

ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
173 pumps , we cannot give the precise pressure ; with 1200 rod cells , and an external resistance of 500,000 ohms ( C. ) 0'02414 W , there were 21 strata , as b , fig. 43 , composed each of three differently coloured layers , the convex one , a , being blue bordered by a line of green , the middle , b , white , and the concave layer , c , reddish.* To the eye these strata were quite steady , but when examined with the rotating mirror , the blue convex layer was steady , while the reddish layer was shown to be flowing towards the negative .
This phenomenon was better seen with 2400 rod cells , and an external resistance of 6,700,000 ohms , ( C. ) 0'000368 W. 5 .
\#151 ; 2400 cells and no external resistance , ( C. ) 0*014210 W. The illumination completely filled the tube , but with 500,000 ohms external resistance , ( C. ) 0'004718 W , there was a dark space of 7 inches between the last stratum and the negative pole .
6 .
\#151 ; The exhaustion carried further .
The current of 1200 cells passed intermittently , but with 2400 cells broad strata seven in 6 inches , were produced as in c , fig. 43 , which , without resistance , at first extended to within 2 inches of , and then reached the negative pole.t With 5,670,000 ohms resistance the stratification became confused towards the positive pole .
7 .
\#151 ; On carrying the exhaustion still further , the strata were fainter , bluer , and wider .
8 .
\#151 ; After three more cistern-fulls of mercury had run through the Sprengel , the current of 2400 cells would not pass , and 3600 only gave a faint blue glow which pervaded the whole tube with indications of strata 2 inches broad , which the rotating mirror showed to be flowing towards the negative .
Air having through inadvertence been allowed to enter the tube , it was refilled with hydrogen and again exhausted .

The ring being positive , curiously formed luminous entities shot at intervals from it , remained stationary for a time , and then disappeared , to be replaced by others : the flow , as seen in the mirror , was towards the negative .
The phenomena are depicted in 1 , fig. 43 .

Luminosities were produced as the right hand diagram in 2 , fig. 43 ; these were very blue , accompanied with great heat in their neighbourhood .
In the rotating mirror the flow was seen to be towards the negative .
12 .
\#151 ; The following day , the pressure being still 13 m.m. , 8040 cells gave intermittent worm-like luminosities , 4 , fig. 43 , with the point negative : these did not occur when the point was positive .

The luminosities still more pointed ; there was heat in the vicinity of the luminosities : 3240 just passed but the luminosities were confused .
17 .
\#151 ; At a pressure of 1 m.m. , 1316 M , the most beautiful phase of all was produced as shown in fig. 44 , in some of its chief features ; the current used was that of 2160 powder cells , ( C. ) 0,011520 W. The strata grouped themselves in threes and reached to within 6 inches of the negative ring ; when 200,000 ohms resistance was introduced , ( C. ) 0'005658 W , the dark space extended to 9 inches .
Only a portion of the luminosity about the negative ring is shown in the diagram ; besides this , the ring was surrounded with a * De la Rive ( Archives Sci. Phys. Not .
, xxvi .
, pp. 202-207 ) investigated the temperature of rarefied gases during the electric discharge .
He employed a tube 160 m.m. long and 40 m.m. in diameter , with copper balls 10 m.m. in diameter for terminals .
A pair of thermometers , whose mercury reservoirs were cylinders 30 m.m. long and 2'5 m.m. in diameter , were inserted each at a distance of 10 m.m. from its terminal .
The conclusions drawn by him from his experiments are ( i ) that a sensible elevation of temperature accompanies the discharge in rarefied gases ; ( ii ) that this elevation is sensibly less in the neighbourhood of the negative than near the positive electrode , provided that the gases are sufficiently rarefied , that the discharge passes easily , and that the light is stratified ; ( iii ) that the absolute elevations near the two terminals and the differences of elevation vary with the density and nature of the gas .
De la Rive remarks that these investigations are not to be confounded with those which have been made by Gassiot concerning the temperature of the terminals themselves .

Strata produced resembling the four on the right of 58 , fig. 46 ; the convex part being blue and the concave part pink ; the last stratum , nearest to the negative , had two points ; the negative ring was enveloped in a cylindrical nebulosity , pink close to the terminal , the strata reached within 5 inches of the negative terminal .
There was seen in the rotating mirror a rapid flow towards the positive .

39 strata were produced as in 14 , fig. 43 , when 400,000 ohms resistance was in circuit , the convex side being blue and the broader concave side reddish , they extended to within 5 inches of the negative .
With 50,000 ohms resistance , ( C. ) 0*005830 W , there were 34 strata .
The luminosity at the negative is correctly shown in the diagram ; no flow of strata could be detected by the rotating mirror , the image remaining steady .

21 strata as 14 , fig. 43 , very blue on the convex face , pink on the concave , the glow on the terminals pink .
Observed with the rotating mirror the strata were steady , but from time to time secondary strata formed as 18 , fig. 43 , which were seen to flow towards negative .
22 .
\#151 ; The vacuum carried further by running -grd of a cistern-full of mercury through the pump ; 1200 cells .
21 very blue strata , like a. fig. 43 ; with 100,000 ohms , still 21 strata ; with 500,000 ohms , 22 strata ; with 900,000 ohms the strata became like spheroids , being bounded on both sides by a convex face .
23 .
\#151 ; The exhaustion was carried further , but the pressure was not measurable with our then means , the gauge appearing to stand higher than the barometer .
The current of 1200 rod cells , ( C. ) 0*00763 W , did not pass very readily , and the strata were unsteady ; the introduction of 50,000 ohms resistance , ( C. ) 0*005830 W , rendered them steady ; they were 19 in number , and from time to time narrower strata introduced themselves between those first formed , as shown in 18 , fig. 43 .
The introduction of 900,000 ohms caused the strata to widen out and to fill the space occupied by the secondary strata .
24.\#151 ; After 10 cistern-fulls had run through it required a potential of 2400 cells to pass , the strata were 1^ inch wide , and a sort of hour-glass luminosity appeared at the negative , as shown in 20 , fig. 45 .
At times the luminosity left the centre of the negative ring and jumped towards the wall of the tube , as shown in 22 , fig. 45 .

The phenomena are shown in 22 , fig. 45 .
After a while 2400 rod cells only faintly illuminated the tube , and it required 3600 to continue the phase .

\#151 ; At the 14th cistern-full the current of 6960 cells would not pass at first , but , after the charge of 8040 had been sent through , 5880 were sufficient .
With 500,000 resistance 8 strata were produced as in 24 , fig. 45 .
With 8040 cells the broad strata were crossed by bright lines not more than 0T inch apart .
On the end of the central point of the negative discharge there was produced a pink half hour-glass addition , the point of which joined onto it at the centre of the ring .
The two points of the negative discharge close to the tube were very sensitive to the approach of the finger .
" 28 .
\#151 ; At the 16th cistern-full it required 6960 cells to pass at first , but after- wards the tube became hot , f and the current of 2400 passed , the discharge taking place most readily when the point was negative .
The phenomena were as in 20 , fig. 45 .
The flow was from positive to negative .

\#151 ; At the 17th cistern-full 5880 cells passed , but 6960 gave the best effect : 9 strata like 24 , fig. 45 , slightly pink , near the negative .
The F line was seen with the spectroscope .
A slow flow from the positive was seen with the rotating mirror .
The next day the current of 2400 cells passed , producing a confused stratification ; 3600 produced a more steady one .
The negative discharge left the centre of the ring and hugged the side of the * * In his 'Notice snr l'appareil d'induction de Ruhmkorff , et les experiences qu'on peut fair avec cet instrument , 3me edition , Paris , 1857 , ' Du Moncel claims to have been the first to announce the attraction of the luminous discharge to the wall of the vacuum chamber when this is touched by the finger .
Quet et Sequin ( ' Comptes Rendus , ' xlvii .
, 1858 , pp 964-967 ) describe the effect of approaching the hand or a ring of tinfoil to a vacuum tube : the bright strata widen out on that side of the hand or tinfoil which is towards the positive terminal , and at the edge of the tinfoil , on the same side , a large dark space occurs\#151 ; the phenomenon being best seen when the hand or tinfoil is near the positive terminal ; on sliding the hand towards the positive the strata re-enter each other , but on sliding the hand from the positive they issue out again .
Gassiot ( Brit. Assoc. , Aberdeen , vol , xxix .
( sect. ) , p. 155 ) , in speaking of strata being very sensitive to the finger in a cylinder 4| inches in diameter and with the terminals 20 inches apart , says : " On the four fingers being placed in succession on the stratification they disappear in succession , and may be separated to a considerable distance by placing both hands on two separate portions of the cylinder .
" t Frequently during the course of experiments with the tube 129 and others , when highly exhausted , it has required many cells to pass in the first instance , but when the tube had become heated a much smaller number sufficed .
Gassiot has also found that -warming the tube promotes the passage of a current , and with regard to very low temperatures makes the following statement ( Phil. Trans. , 1859 , p. 146 ) :\#151 ; " In a Torricellian vacuum which gave good cloud-like strata no change occurred when cooled to +32 ' Fah .
, but at \#151 ; 102c Fah .
all traces of strata disappeared as well as the red glow around the negative ; a glow throughout the tube remained .

the strata were likewise destroyed .
When the mercury was frozen the stratifications disappeared , but a magnet made them reappear .

On approaching the finger it was repelled to the opposite side of the tube , and sometimes split into two portions , one on each side of the finger .

\#151 ; At the 19^ cistern-full 3600 would not pass , 4800 sufficed when the point was negative ; 7 broad strata crossed with lines of narrower strata not more than 0'02 inch wide and distant .
A zone of intensely blue light , 0'25 inch broad , lined the inside of the tube around the point when negative .
With 8040 cells the discharge was rustling when the point was positive , and if the primary of Apps 's induction coil 819 was connected in circuit , a tell-tale tube being connected to the secondary , the tell-tale became illuminated , indicating an intermittent current .

\#151 ; At the 22nd cistern-full , 4800 cells , noTnaterial change , except that between the blue zone and the end , the tube was filled with a pink glow , and that after a time even 8040 cells would not pass except when the point was negative ; but the next day 2400 cells passed in either direction even with an external resistance of 4,900,000 ohms , gas having probably been given off " from the glass walls .
32 .
\#151 ; At the 29th cistern-full 8040 cells passed only when the point was negative , a milky light filling the whole tube ; heat was generated at the negative , very great in proportion to the light .
33 .
\#151 ; After 39 charges of the cistern had been sent through the Sppengel pump ( since the vacuum had attained 0*2 m.m. ) the current of 8040 cells would only pass after the contact with the battery had been maintained for some time and both ends of the tube alternately breathed upon ; in fact , the current had to be coaxed through it.t There were 9 barrel-shaped strata produced as shown in 38 , a and b , fig. 45 ; the illumination was very feeble , and no lines could be made out with the spectroscope either in the strata or the luminous glow around the negative terminal , in this case the straight wire .
Examined with the hand spectroscope the spectrum appeared indeed to be nearly continuous .
In the course of our experiments we have often observed great changes in the spectrum of hydrogen as the exhaustion became greater , the C line , for example , is the first to get faint and then to disappear .

\#151 ; The tube had now a small charge of hydrogen let into it , which raised the pressure to 0'5 m.m. , 658 M. 2400 rod cells with 500,000 ohms resistance in circuit , ( C. ) 0'004718 W , produced 54 beautiful steady strata , some of which threaded themselves on the straight wire when it was made negative , exactly as in the case of Geissler 's tube 123 before alluded to ; b , \#163 ; 9 , * The phenomenon was re-observed at a pressure of 0*038 m.m. , 50 M , C. 0*00631 W. t The limit of 8040 was subsequently attained at a pressure of 0*016 m.m. , 21 M. The variation in the spectrum of the same gas under different circumstances has engaged the attention of several physicists\#151 ; notably of Hittorf and Plucker ( Phil. Trans , civ .

For a few seconds about 15 strata at the positive end became pink , all the others being grey ; afterwards the strata in the middle of the tube were grey , those at each end being pink .
The spectroscope did not show the F line distinctly .

At first only 1 entity was formed , then 2 , then 3 , and lastly 4 , the heat was great in their immediate vicinity ; they flowed from positive to negative , and when the hand was approached as if to grasp them they receded from it towards the positive .
After a short time a few strata were formed in the luminosities , as in 104 , fig. 46 .
Ultimately 8040 cells were necessary , and the current only passed when the point was negative .

From time to time there arose in the centre of the tube a concave spindle-like formation , 49 , fig. 45 , which gradually extended itself to both poles , and absorbed all the luminosities .
Examined with the spectroscope the C and F lines were brilliantly seen in the glow around the negative terminal , but were not visible in the spectrum of the nebulosities , notwithstanding that they were brighter than the negative glow ; there were blue , green , and red visible , but not the characteristic green and red lines of hydrogen .

An agitation was afterwards visible , and the strata arranged themselves diagonally as in 52 , fig. 46 , and almost immediately an agitated spiral* was formed , as 50 , fig. 46 , at the positive , extending nearly the whole length of the tube , but there were at the negative two or three saucer-shaped steady strata convex towards it .
In the rotating mirror it was seen that there was a steady flow towards the negative .
The characteristic hydrogen lines were very brilliant when the spectroscope was directed to the glow around the negative terminal , but quite a different spectrum was seen on a bright stratum , with mercurial lines in the orange .
Shortly after this , the current being very great , the bent wire was heated to redness and fell down as in 56 , fig. 46 .

The tube was now removed from the pump and retained the characteristic property of showing blue strata with a large current , and changing to pink as resistances were introduced.45 .
Unfortunately , one of the glass cocks was accidentally broken off from 129 , but the tube was repaired and again attached to the pumps on November 18 , 1876 .

_Pressure 13'7 m.m. , 18,026 M , 8040 cells .
There was one luminosity at the ring positive .
Connected with the secondary of an induction coil instead of a battery , there was a streamer discharge like that produced under similar circumstances in tube 129 , 106 , fig. 47 .

\#151 ; Pressure carried down by successive steps to 5*6 m.m. , 7368 M , 8040 cells .
The tube was filled with a nebulous discharge crossed by paper-like stratifications , the current was intermittent .
The C , F , and G lines visible with the spectroscope in the nebulous illumination of the negative terminal , but the C and G lines were not visible in the strata ; with 700,000 to 900,000 ohms resistance the nebulous discharge broke up into three distinct luminosities .
101 .
\#151 ; Pressure 2'4 m.m. , 3158 M , 3600 rod cells , strata like 17 , fig. 49 , in shape , but closer and agitated ; a flow seen in the mirror towards the 102 .
\#151 ; Without any external leakage , the pressure had increased the following-day to 3 m.m. , 3947 M , 3600 rod cells ; luminosities as depicted in 14 , fig. 49 , extended half the length of the tube towards the positive , the second half on the positive side being filled with nebulous ill-defined strata ; the discharge on the ring , negative , being cylindrical .
103 .
\#151 ; Pressure 1*2 m.m. , 1579 M , 3600 rod cells .
This was the first occasion of regular steady strata being observed with this tube , as shown in 15 , fig. 49 , resembling those seen in tube 129 , 55 and 56 , fig. 46 , at the same pressure .
It is curious that up to this pressure tube 130 had throughout only given agitated discharges , and had shown no signs of distinct well-formed luminosities .
The only difference between tubes 129 and 130 is that the latter has a diameter of 175 inch , or 0'125 inch less than that of the former ; it is 32 inches long , 28 inches between the terminals .
The strata were blue , with the exception of the first and second from the negative , which , as well as the cylindrical glow on and about the negative , were pink .
With 1,000,000 ohms resistance the strata turned pink .
It was noticed that on first closing the circuit the strata were agitated , but after a while they became steady , the tube in the meantime becoming heated .

105 .
\#151 ; Pressure 0'2 , 263 M , 2400 cells , C. 0'04686 W , 34 steady blue strata were produced , which extended to within inches from the negative , this space being dark , see 17 , also a , fig. 49 .
On introducing 200,000 ohms resistance , C. 0*00879 W , the strata turned pink and assumed the form 18 , fig. 49 .
With 500,000 ohms resistance the number was reduced to 21 , and with a megohm to 16 .
The calculated resistance of the tube at the above pressure was 22,170 ohms .
106 .
\#151 ; Photographs were taken of the tube , which had been separated from the pump and which underwent some changes ; with 3600 cells the strata were blue and 61 in number , as represented in fig. 1 , Plate 16 , which is copied from a photograph obtained in 11 seconds .
107 .
\#151 ; With 700,000 ohms resistance in circuit the strata were reduced to 18 , and turned pink .

\#151 ; Subsequently another change occurred in the phenomena of the tube with * 3600 rod cells , the phase being most splendid , and showing 21 double strata intensely blue , but with a carmine line between the components.'5 ' The tube * Gassiot ( Brit. Assoc. , 1865 ( sect. ) , p. 15 ) : " On the change of form and colour which the stratified discharge assumes when a varied resistance is introduced in the circuit of an extended series of the voltaic battery .
" [ 4000 cells carbon and amalgamated zinc , in each cell a table-spoonfull ( 24 c.c. ) of sulphate of mercury ] .
The resistance in the circuit was a tube \ an inch in diameter and 3 feet long , filled with water , in which two platinum wires could be inserted to different depths:\#151 ; " On depressing the wire small crescent-shaped disks of red light are observed to be rapidly produced in quick succession from the positive pole .

2 c 2 In consequence of a crystalline deposit having formed in the tube it was detached from the pump in order to ascertain its nature : it was insoluble in bisulphide of carbon , water , alcohol , nitric , hydrochloric , or strong sulphuric acids , but by heating the tube with a spirit lamp , a little strong sulphuric acid having been previously inserted , the substance came off in yellow flakes and proved to be sulphur which was now soluble in bi-sulphide of carbon .
It had existed in the first instance in one of its allotropie conditions .
It was ascertained that the source of the sulphur was the vulcanized india-rubber junction tube from which it was gradually taken up by the current of hydrogen .

Gass lot Tube 342 , Hydrogen .
171.\#151 ; This most interesting tube was a favourite of our friend the late Mr. Gassiot , and was presented by him , with many others , to Mr. Spottiswoode .
It retains , in a remarkable degree , the record of old stratification by bands of dark deposit with clear spaces between them .
It was a matter of interest to ascertain whether the lines of deposit coincided with the position of the spaces or with that of the strata .
This tube is composed of a cylinder 13 inches long and l-x % inch in diameter , having at one end a bulb 2 inches in diameter , from which project at right angles to the main tube two short lengths of tube 1^- inch in diameter , the whole resembliug in form the letter T. At the end of the tube opposite the bulb is a straight brass wire y qinch in diameter screwed on to a wire of platinum , and in the head of the T a brass wire , 4S inches long , reaching axially right across .
The bulb and short tubes attached to it are completely coated withi a dense black metallic deposit , and for a space of 5 inches from the bulb the main tube is stained with eight dark bands .
2400 cells gave a current 0*02289 W , the straight wire being positive and the cross wire in the bulb negative ; there were produced beautiful double strata intensely blue , like those in fig. 3 , Plate 16 , completely filling the tube .
Strips of paper were fastened over these strata in the region of the stains ; these were found to occupy the unstained spaces ; the stains therefore marked the intervals , or cooler parts , between former strata/ " ' The insertion of 500,000 ohms changed the colour of the strata to pink and the form to that shown in fig. 6 , Plate 16 , but their position remained unaltered .

* * Gassiot ( Brit. Assoc. , 1869 ( sect. ) , p. 46 ) : " In one of Geissler 's tubes with which I have for some time experimented I obtained , by using my extended series of the voltaic battery , not only a very dense opaque deposit on the glass round the negative electrode , but five or six bands of dark deposit along the tube ; in carefully examining their position 1 find they exactly coincided with the dark band between the striae , that they did not increase in density by continuing the discharge like the deposit round the negative , but remained without further change .
" I have not any record from Geissler of the nature of the gas , \amp ; c. , and have not been able to obtain similar results with other tubes obtained from Geissler .
" In one of Cetti 's originally charged with arseniuretted hydrogen there was such a deposit .
" This result appeared to me to explain that the deposit in Geissler 's tube did not arise from particles of the negative electrode but from the gas with which it was originally charged ; their being deposited exactly in the dark portions between the luminous disks may lead to a correct explanation of a phenomenon that has hitherto baffled the ingenuity of the experimentalist .

As the charge ran down after the condenser had been disconnected from the battery , a most beautiful series of phases was obtained during the two minutes and a half which elapsed before the potential had fallen so low that the current ceased to pass .
The first phase is shown in 3 , fig. 56 , consisting of groups of three bow-shaped strata with a disc between each group .

This tube at first gave a beautiful stratification , but after several experiments , it merely showed a tendency to stratification towards the period of cessation of the current .
At nearly the full potential one luminosity formed at the positive , a considerable dark interval existing between it and another luminosity which formed in the centre of the tube , and there was a great interval between this and the glow at the negative .
As the tension fell , the negative glow became globular , then elongated , and lastly reached the central luminosity ; suddenly the central luminosity disappeared , and left a dark interval in its place .

With the full potential a splendid phenomenon of 18 steady strata was produced ; as the potential fell more strata gradually crowded in from the positive until they reached 43 in number , after which they became confused .
With 6,150,000 ohms resistance in circuit there was a rapid flow in which alternating greenish and reddish cross markings were seen ; the rotating mirror resolved these into strata alternately pink and greenish .
The resistance of the tube was found to be * Gassiot ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. , vol. xii .
, 1862-3 , p. 336 ) describes a similar phase : " Depressing the wire very gradually ( lessening the resistance ) the positive became sharply defined , the negative retaining much of its irregular termination , but each separated by a dark interval of about one inch in length .
" Mr. Spottiswoode informs us that at an early stage of his experiments he noticed the formation of large cylindrical blocks of light or luminosities , terminated by flat ends , and separated by dark intervals often as long as themselves .
These were most frequently found in tubes from 2 to 3 inches in diameter , containing coal-gas residua , at 05 to 075 m.m. pressure ; they were from 2 to 3 or even 4 inches in length , and sometimes shot out from the positive terminal , then travelled along the tube , and finally disappeared in the dark space towards the negative terminal .
They could be produced either by the Holtz machine with a very small air-spark , or with a coil furnished with one of the rapid contact breakers described in a paper ( Roy .
Soc. Proc. xxiii .
, 1875 , pp. 455-462 ) referred to above .
When observed with a revolving mirror these blocks usually showed striae in a state of flow .
He is of opinion that , at all events when produced under the circumstances here described , these blocks are essentially stratified , and that they are sections of flow , even when the velocity is too great to allow the separate stilus to be detected in the mirror .

On letting in part , by opening the stop-cock connected with the calibrated chamber , the pressure was increased to 2 m.m. , 2632 M , and the strata became much wider .
The exhaustion was then carried gradually further , until it required 3240 cells to pass , and ultimately 4800 ; the pressure was so low that we could not then determine it .
There were only ten strata produced , as in the right hand of fig. 61 , a large dark space intervening between the last stratum and the negative terminal .
This tube , unfortunately , cracked near the negative terminal before the contemplated experiments could be completed .
This occurred some days after an experiment during which the negative terminal had become overheated .

In the small tubes were produced closely-packed strata , in the large central bulb were three umbrella-shaped strata much fainter ; these moved towards the negative on introducing 50,000 ohms , a fresh stratum pointed at the apex entering the bulb from the right-hand tube ( positive side ) , C. 0*00672 W.

The negative terminal is a platinum wire 19 inches long , and about 0*025 inch in diameter , coiled into a horizontal spiral of four complete turns , concentric with the tube ; it is supported in its position by three fine glass rods running parallel to the axis of the tube .
The positive terminal is straight , and extends vertically to the common axis of the tube and spiral .
The distance between the last ring of the spiral and the positive terminal is -S inch .
As the strength of the current is increased , the glow which , with a current of 0*00238 W , illuminates only the 2 inches of the negative nearest ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .

202.\#151 ; The difference of the strata in tubes of different diameter* at the same pressure and with the same current is very clearly brought out in tube 161 , composed of two portions , one being 18 inches long and 1*65 inch internal diameter , the other 17'5 inches long and 0'975 inch diameter , the ratio of the sectional areas being 2'864 to 1 .
The terminal in the small tube is a point ; in the large one a ring .
With 4800 cells , the point ( small tube ) positive C. 0*02825 W , there were produced in the small tube 62 disc-shaped strata , and in the large tube twelve saucer-shaped strata occupying half of the length of the large tube ; beyond these the discharge was dark .
With the point negative , C. 0*02451 , there were produced in the small tube 54 discs , and in the large tube thirteen saucer-shaped , completely filling it .
The number of strata does not therefore appear to be in the inverse ratio of the areas .
The strata in the small tube were blue , but at times , with a large current , carmine , as in the capillary part of a spectrum-analysis tube , the strata in the large tube being much fainter and pink .

203.\#151 ; It will be seen on reading the foregoing histories , especially those of tubes 129 , 139 , 130 , that the strata all take their origin at the positive terminal , and that first one , then two , three , and so on , make their appearance as the pressure of the gas is diminished .
A glance at Plate 15 will render this evident , all the strata having their origin at the positive terminal .
But Mr. Spottiswoode 's elegant contrivance of a moveable terminal shows this to be the case in the most conclusive manner ; * we give in Plate 17 , figs , a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , a representation of the strata obtained , in eight different positions of the terminal , in a tube we had made after his model by his permission ; it is 56 inches long and 1'375 inch diameter , and is shown in figs. 39 and 40 , page 164 .
Plate 17 does not give the first phase\#151 ; a single stratum\#151 ; formed on the positive terminal a certain distance from the negative , which distance remains constant , as is shown in the plate .
3240 powder cells were used with a resistance of 200,000 ohms to produce a steady discharge .
* Gassiot ( Phil. Trans. , 1858 , p. 12 ) used a tube attached to a mercurial cistern which was connected with an air-pump ; as the pressure was reduced in this cistern , mercury , which originally filled the tube supported in a vertical direction , descended , producing a Torricellian vacuum of less or greater length .
The surface of the mercury acted as the negative terminal .
He says:\#151 ; " It is curious to observe the stratifications retreating from the negative as the mercury ascends the tube , or following it as they descend when the vessel is being exhausted , the dark line of discharge being compressed or expanded in proportion as the length of the stratification is increased or decreased .
" Also in speaking of the stratified discharge as affected by a moveable glass ball ( Brit. Ass .
Aberdeen , vol. xxix .
, 1859 , sect , p. 11 ) , he says:\#151 ; " I have already stated that the stratifications near the positive wire are indistinct ; but if the glass bead is placed near the positive wire and then allowed slowly to descend towards the negative , the stratifications at the positive are at first clearly defined near that terminal as at the negative , and as the bead rolls gently down , they have the appearance of following the bead and issuing one after the other from the positive wire until the bead reaches to within a few inches of the negative , when this action gradually ceases .
If the tube is now inclined so as to allow the glass bead to return in the contrary direction the stratifications appear to recede , becoming more and more clearly defined , until the bead passes the positive terminal wire , when the entire discharge returns to its normal state , " ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .

The resistances of the tube for the several distances between the terminals are given in page 164 .
When the primary of coil 819 was in circuit , as fig. 69 , page 227 , the advent or retreat of a stratum produced a deflection of the galvanometer in* connexion with the secondary of the coil , thus indicating a pulsation in the current .
We have already stated * that the discharge is frequently flowing and unsteady , but that 'perfectly steady strata may be produced by properly regulating the current by the gradual introduction of resistance in the circuit , t In Plate 17 we give three cases by way of example , thus :\#151 ; Tube 73 , 22 '5inches between the two straight terminals , diameter 1'5 CcH6 .

The discharge under certain conditions is continuous and under others it becomes intermittent .
These conditions are , that without resistance introduced in the circuit , except that inherent in the battery , the discharge cannot be resolved by the rotating mirror , and so far must be considered continuous , but when a certain given and described resistance is introduced in the circuit the discharge becomes intermittent .
" And at p. 339 : " The form in figuration of the striae and the positions they occupy in the vacuum tube appear to depend on two separate and distinct conditions , 1st , the power- and energy of the battery ; 2nd , the state of tension of the highly attenuated matter through which the discharge is visible .
" " The striae can be controlled , their number increased or reduced , and their places or positions in the tubes altered by the introduction of measurable amounts of resistance in circuit .

213 was reduced to 27 , and just before the current ceased to pass after the battery had been disconnected from the condenser the number fell to 21 .
In the case of tube 124 the strata decreased the decrease of current .
The introduction of any substance in the tube , such as rings or flags of metal , produces an interruption of strata very much as if they acted as distinct terminals .
Tube 120 , Carbonic Acid .
209.\#151 ; This tube is 28 inches long between the end straight terminals , and 1*75 inch diameter , with two lightly suspended aluminium flags .
Nine strata produced from the positive , then a dark space between them and the first flag , which is brightly illuminated .
This seemed to act as a fresh terminal , from which started ten strata , beyond which there was again a dark space between them and the second flag , which in its turn appeared to act as a new terminal , being illuminated by a glow .
' " ' Five other strata were formed on the other side of this , and beyond them there was a dark space , and the negative terminal was brilliantly illuminated .
Fig. 5 , Plate 17 , copied from a photograph shows the phenomena ; no motion of the flags could be detected during the passage of the current , 0'01158 W. Tube 101 , Carbonic Acid .
210.\#151 ; This tube is 25 inches long between two straight terminals , and 1*5 inch in diameter ; beginning at the positive terminal on the right , at 1*25 inch is a fixed flag 0'5 inch square , beyond this at 1*5 inch another , at the middle of the tube a ring 1 inch in diameter ; on either side of this ring at 1*375 inch distance are two balls about 0*375 inch in diameter , then two other square fixed flags at the same distances from the left hand ( negative ) terminal and from each other .
It will be seen by referring to fig. 6 , Plate 17 , that a close stratified discharge is shown with an illumination of each of the impediments except the last two flags near the negative , as in tubes referred to at page 165 .
This figure is copied from a photograph taken when the tube was connected with 2400 cells and 150,000 ohms resistance , C. 0*00504 W. * Gaugain ( ' Comptes Rendus , ' xli .
, 1855 , pp. 152-156 ) compares the behaviour of gases in this respect with that of liquid electrolytes where the introduction of a metal diaphragm between the electrodes increases the resistance , and the two faces of the diaphragm act as opposite electrodes .
Gaugain further remarks that if the metal obstruction be pierced it ceases to act as a double electrode in gases , a fact confirmed by our many experiments with tubes fui'nislied with metal rings ( tig .
41 , p. 165 ) .
In the preceding pages it has been shown that the number of strata varies with the pressure of the gas , beginning with one luminosity , then increasing in number up to a certain point as the pressure is diminished ; as the gas becomes gradually attenuated the strata become thicker and fewer ; lastly , the current passes with increasing difficulty , and the strata have a tendency to run together .
With the mercurial pump alone we have not been able to obtain a lower pressure than 2*6 M. but with the employment of spongy palladium in a hydrogen vacuum we have reduced the pressure to 0*000055 m.m. , 0*066 M. Tube 145 , Hydrogen .
Length 25 inches , 20 inches between the terminals , one a wire , the other a , diameter If This tube is represented at 145 , fig. 37 .
It has an absorption chamber containing spongy palladium , obtained by heating its cyanide to redness ; this chamber is 5-| inches long , .S inch in diameter , and is about half-full of palladium , which is held in its place by plugs of palladium-foil .
At one end of the tube is a short capillary calibrated tube contained between two glass stop-cocks , the first communicating with the tube , the second with the hydrogen generator .
The tube was repeatedly exhausted and filled with dry hydrogen , while the absorption chamber was being heated in a copper air-bath to a temperature above the range of the mercurial thermometer ; a double saddle-screen of tinned iron , placed on the small tube connecting the absorption chamber with the glass cock , effectually protected the latter from excessive heat .
At various pressures from 35 m.m. , 46,053 M , ~* at which the current of 11,000 cells just passed where the ring was positive , most of the phenomena recorded for tube 129 were obtained , but the following are the experiments for which the tube was specially constructed .
In the first instance , in order to test the absorbing power of the palladium , it was heated for some hours , and the tube was very completely exhausted ; it was then filled with hydrogen at the atmospheric pressure , and kept at this pressure while the palladium cooled .
The tube was exhausted again , and it was found that at 10 m.m. the palladium gave off hydrogen sensibly at ordinary temperatures ; then the air-bath was heated above the range of the mercurial thermometer , when the gas filled the * Morren , A. ( ' Comptes Rendus , ' liv .

, which caused a deviation of 1 ' of his galvanometer ; at a pressure of 2*8 m.m. the deviation was at a maximum 46 ' , and at 0'06 m.m. the current was less , the deviation being 30 ' .
He gives the currents also in carbonic anhydride , nitrogen , and carbonic oxide .

215 tube , both pumps , and the McLeod gauge to a pressure of 410 m.m. , 539474 M , thus showing that it was capable of absorbing a large volume of gas .
211 .
\#151 ; The tube was now exhausted , first with the Alvergniat pump , which was subsequently shut off at the cock C , fig. 35 , afterwards with the Sprengel , the cock between the absorption chamber and the tube being left open .
When the pressure had reached 0*005 m.m. , 6*58 M , the current of 11,000 cells would pass only when the straight wire was negative .
When the pressure was 0*00137 m.m. , 1*8 M , the current would not pass in either direction .
The exhaustion and absorption were carried on until the pressure fell to 0*000055 m.m. , 0*066 M , at which pressure there was , of course , no current .
The Apps 's induction coil 821 , set to produce a 1-inch spark , would not pass at first , but did so after the current had been made to pass with a 6-inch spark .
The pressure rose to 0*0024 m.m. , 3*2 M. 212 .
\#151 ; Exhaustion to 0*00016 m.m. , 0*2 M , having been again obtained , the absorption chamber was shut off , and a charge of gas from the calibrated tube , the capacity of which is withat of the main tube , was let into the tube and Sprengel pump ; it increased the pressure to 0*226 m.m. , giving -6-490 for the ratio of the capacity of the calibrated chamber to that of the tube plus the Sprengel pump and McLeod gauge .
When the gas was let in the current of 11,000 cells , 0*04201 W , immediately flashed through the tube , and produced twenty blue strata , like those in fig. 9 , Plate 16 , reaching to within 7 inches of the negative .

In 45 minutes the pressure had decreased to 0*00137 m.m. , 1*8 M , and 11,000 cells would not pass .

\#151 ; The absorption chamber was now connected with the tube .
With 3600 cells , phenomena in the reverse order were obtained .
The pressure was observed to have fallen in a few minutes to 1*003 m.m. , 1318 M ; in 10 minutes to 0*1245 m.m. , 164 M ; and in 45 minutes to 0*0217 m.m. , 28 M , when it required 4800 , and subsequently 6300 cells to pass .
At first when the saucer-shaped strata had disappeared , twenty-one disc-shaped strata presented themselves ; these widened out , and there were successively sixteen , fourteen , and twelve , becoming like figs. 8 , 9 , 11 , and 12 , Plate 16 , respectively .
When the two last phases were produced , the hydrogen lines could not be seen either in the strata or the glow on the negative ring , but , instead of them , mercury lines came out strongly .
* There is reason to think that at this stage there was little gas , except mercury vapour , in the tube .
It is to be observed that , with a very high degree of exhaustion , the tongue- , and saucer-shaped strata are no longer produced in a hydrogen vacuum , and that the strata assume the disc-form usual with carbonic acid , air , and .

On heating the potash bulb gas is given off , and then the current of 2160 is sufficient , the maximum current with this battery being 0*00238 W. On heating the bulb still more it required 3240 cells to pass , and ultimately this was insufficient ; by allowing the potash bulb again to cool the current of 3240 cells passed , and very close strata were produced , nine in an inch ; then , as it still further * Hittorf ( Pogg .

\#151 ; This is a tube with a diaphragm of glass having a hole in it 0'25 inch diameter , the length between the terminals being 11 inches ; it also has a potash chamber for the complete absorption of moisture , 9 , fig. 37 ; with 21 GO cells , the potash chamber having been previously heated , about three strata were produced in the compartment near the positive ; as the chamber cooled and the vacuum became more perfect , six strata formed in this compartment , completely filling it , and one after the other appeared to squeeze through the small hole in the diaphragm into the negative compartment , where two strata formed , each double , like those in fig. 3 , Plate 16 .
Tube 116 .
224 .
\#151 ; This is one of the so-called induction tubes , like , in some respects , that shown in 19 , fig. 37 ; it consists , however , of three chambers , the distance between the terminals being 37 inches .
It is composed of a large central tube 18'5 inches long , 2'25 inches diameter , terminating at each end in a bulb 2-5 inches in diameter , and containing carbonic acid .
Enclosed in these bulbs are two smaller bulbs 2'125 inches in diameter , connected each with a spheroidal bulb , the major axis of which is 3'375 , and the minor 2'5 inches ; these contain nitrogen .
In these spheroids the terminals are placed , so that each is enclosed in a separate chamber ( see Plate 18 , fig. 5 ) .
On connecting this tube with 6960 cells a flash is perceived in the several compartments of the tubes ; on reversing the current another flash , but no continuous illumination as with the induction coil .
As in an induction coil there is a series of rapid reversals of current , it is evident that it illuminates induction tubes by an alternate charging up and discharge of the leyden jars formed by the contained bulbs , on each side of which is residual gas , which acts as the carrier of electricity .
By rapidly reversing the current of the battery by means of the key , figs. 2 and 3 , page 59 , Part I. , the tube becomes illuminated , but not so well as with an induction coil .
On , however , employing the rapid commutator shown in fig. 8 , Part I. , which alternates the current 352 times or less in a second , a most splendid illumination of the tube takes place , producing an appearance shown in fig. 5 , Plate 18 , copied partly from a photograph obtained when 6960 cells were used and with about 150 reversals of current in a second .
The two spheroidal chambers communicating with the enclosed globes became illuminated with pink and red streamers , and the long central tube with olive grey strata , apparently convex in both directions , but which the rotating mirror separated into two components , one convex m one direction , the other in the other .
In the photograph only a continuous light is seen in the central tube , so that the detail , there shown , is from eye observation .
Sensitiveness to External Injluence .
225.\#151 ; In the preceding description we have alluded to the sensitiveness of tubes to the approach of the hand , or touch of the finger ; the tube shown in fig. 63 , containing cyanogen , is an example of an extreme case : it gave tongue-shaped strata , and these entirely disappeared on the touch of a finger , all the tongues running into a continuous wave-discharge constricted near the finger .

219 Tube No. 8 , 14 inches long , diameter 1*5 inch .
226.\#151 ; This tube was placed in a metallic trough , 15 inches long , 4*5 inches deep , and the same wide ; the trough was insulated on four paraffin cylinders p p , and filled with water , and also with a solution of common salt .
The resistance of the tube was 60,000 ohms , 1200 cells would pass , but 2400 were used with a resistance of 200,000 ohms , giving eight strata , C. 0'00259 W. On connecting one pole of the battery , and one terminal of the tube to earth , and the other pole to the other terminal of the tube , it was found that the difference of potential between the two terminals of the tube was the same , 1131 volts , whether the tube was in air , water , or a solution of common salt , and whether the trough was insulated or connected to earth .
The experiment was repeated , but with the addition of the employment of a second battery A ' 7/ of 3240 cells , which was used to charge up the trough alternately + or \#151 ; whilst the current of a battery of 1460 cells passed continuously through the tube .
At each reversal of the charge of the liquid in the trough , a flash of light passed through the whole length of the tube , and the strata made a slight movement towards the negative terminal and back again to their original position .
It was thought that the discharge , under the influence of induction , might take a hollow cylindrical form , but this did not occur .

The tube is 40 inches long and 1*875 inch in diameter , and has a stop cock 2 f 2 at each end ; near one of the ends is a small tube , 0*75 inch in diameter , fastened to the main tube at right angles , and fitted with a glass stopper , in which two stout platinum wires , 0*043 inch diameter , are melted ; there is soldered , with gold , to the two platinum wires a spiral of palladium made of wire 12 inches long and 0'0125 inch diameter , Pcin the diagram .
The palladium coil was charged to saturation with hydrogen , by immersing it in dilute sulphuric acid and making it the negative pole of a bichromate battery of six elements ; after it had been washed in distilled water it was dried and inserted in the tube .
The two stout wires of platinum , to which the palladium coil is attached , are connected to a condenser of 10*9 m.f. , charged with 3240 cells .
One of the wires leads to K ' so that no current can pass from the condenser until this key is pressed down , when this is done the charge passes and by suddenly igniting the wire drives off the hydrogen .
On first making the experiment , through inadvertence , the condenser was not connected with the palladium coil , but the current in the tube heated it and drove off the hydrogen , producing the effect to be described .
Pressure 1*003 m.m. , 1320 M , 5120 cells , 300,000 ohms resistance , saucer-shaped strata as shown in the diagram .
As soon as the palladium coil became heated it suddenly drove back the strata about one-third the length of the tube from the negative , and the current subsequently became agitated .
After the liberation of the gas the pressure was increased to 1*088 m.m. , 1432 M or by 112 M , the pressure before and after discharge being as 1 to 1*08 .
This experiment was repeated with 4800 cells without external resistance , Pressure 0*9965 m.m. , before the discharge of the condenser , " 1*0381 , , after , , " " Difference 0*0416 " 55 M , double strata were produced from the positive to the palladium coil which was on the negative side .
On liberating hydrogen by the discharge of the condenser these were driven back 14 inches towards the positive , and subsequently only a confused discharge was produced .
When the terminal near the coil was positive the same phenomena were not produced on the discharge of the condenser .
When , instead of liberating gas from the palladium coil , calibarted charges of hydrogen were let in during the passage of the current , the strata were narrowed radially for a few seconds , then again occupied the whole diameter of the tube , but were confused and agitated .
Each fresh puff of gas was accompanied by a fresh radial collapse , and , at the same time , by a repulsion ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
221 of the strata from the negative , whether the puff of gas entered from the negative or from the positive end .
' " ' The wires of this tube had been enclosed nearly up to their extremities in capillary glass tubes ; after repeated discharges these tubes fuzed and enclosed the wires nearly completely , only leaving a section of them free .
When this had happened a very striking phenomenon was observed at the negative terminal on sending a current of 5120 cells through the tube , numerous sparks were thrown off from the extremity of the wire in a very thin sheet at right angles to the axis of the tube , producing the appearance of spokes of a wheel ; the discharge throughout the tube was not stratified .
Not the slightest projection occurred either backwards or forwards in the direction of the length of the tube , showing that there is a lateral force existing at the negative terminal .
The axial direction of the positive impulse , combined with the radial direction of the negative , at right angles to it , may play an important part in the production of stratification . !
* De la Riye ( Geneve Mem. Soc. Phys. xvii .
, 1863 , p. 75 ) made similar experiments ; he introduced during the passage of a current in a vacuum a charge of the same gas that it contained , in quantities sufficient to lower the column of mercury \#163 ; or ^ a millimetre .
If the gas were introduced at the negative end striae well defined were immediately formed in the dark space of the same diameter ( that of the tube ) as the striae already existing , but much closer and narrower .
These gradually extended the whole length of the tube , entangling the original striae in their course .
When the admission of gas had been stopped the luminous column gradually receded Horn the negative and the tu , be took up its normal appearance .
If the gas were introduced at the positive end , instead of striae occupying the whole length of the tube a narrow jet of brilliant light was seen to advance along the axis of the tube in the interior of the luminous column , which immediately extended through the dark space near the negative .
When the admission of gas had ceased the tube returned to its normal condition .
In the same paper ( pp. 73-74 ) the author describes some experiments in which he had a gauge attached to the vacuum tube : the mercury column was observed to oscillate during the discharge through a range of , under favourable circumstances , 04 m.m. ; De la Rive considers that these two experiments support the opinion of Reiss , of Berlin , that these phenomena are purely mechanical .
Spottiswoode showed a similar experiment at a recent meeting of the Royal Society .
t Varley ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. , xix .
, 1871 , p. 239 ) constructed a tube in which a slip of talc , 1 inch long , Ay mch broad , and weighing Txo of a grain , was attached in the middle to a fibre of silk stretched diametrically across the tube ; the position of the vane was not between the terminals , two rings , but between one end of the tube and one of them .
When the discharge , which was in the form of an arch , passed between the two terminals no effect was produced on the vane ; when , however , the arch was influenced by an electro-magnet and made to play upon either the lower or upper end of the vane that part of the vane was repelled , no matter in which direction the current was passing , in some cases as much as 20 ' .
The author states that in his opinion the arch is composed of attenuated 'particles of matter projected from the negative pole in all directions , but that the magnet controls their course .
The view that the strife are aggregations of matter , and that their formation is a mechanical process , appears to receive some support from the fact described by Spottiswoode in a paper on the rapid-contact-breaker ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. xxiii .
, 1875 , pp. 445-462 ) .
In the case of the double discharge the striae of the one discharge fit exactly into the spaces of the other , indicating thereby that the distribution of the residual gas at the close of one discharge is such as to favour a similar distribution in an immediately succeeding discharge , and that time is necessary for a fresh distribution .
See also Appendix , note C. The two tubes about to be described present some very remarkable phenomena , which show that the terminals in some cases are able to absorb the gases of the vacuum tubes and to give them off again under the influence of the current .

Both wires before the experiment were bright and metallic ; there were produced six strata at the positive and a glow around the negative , a copious mirror-like translucent deposit forming on the tube about the negative , which , examined by the microscope with a power of 260-570 linear , appeared to consist of cubes or four-sided prisms ^2oo~o in'li across .
If the current was continued for about a minute a central zone was cleared by the heat and the deposit carried further along the tube .
Gradually there was formed a similar deposit , but not so dense , on the tube round the positive terminal .
The curious part of the phenomenon is that the negative and positive terminals , having become mat and black as if covered with a deposit of spongy palladium , resume their metallic appearance on laying the tube aside for a week or two ; in the mean time the deposit is entirely re-absorbed by the terminals , which become white like frosted silver , and the glass is left quite clear .
This experiment has been repeated very many times with the same result .
Is the deposit a definite compound of palladium and hydrogen ?

ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
223 Throughout our researches we have not seen in a carbonic acid vacuum any umbrella- , saucer- , or tongue-shaped strata as shown in Plate 11 , figs. 2 , 6 , and 7 , respectively ; so far as our experience goes they are always of the disc-form shown in figs. 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , Plate 16 , and fig. Ill in Plate 17 .
On the other hand , hydrogen , phosphoretted hydrogen , and arsenetted hydrogen will give the umbrella- , saucer- , and tongue-like strata .
Some tubes containing sulphurous acid give these forms of strata , while cyanogen gives the disc-shaped as in carbonic acid .
Tubes prepared by Dr. Geissler , containing a mixture of gases , such as phosphoretted hydrogen and hydrogen , carbonic acid and bromine , nitrogen and bromine , as a rule give a most beautiful stratification and point to the desirability of a more extended study of the effect of mixture of gases on the electric discharge .
In 1875 we made a communication to the Poyal Society , in connexion with our friend Mr. Spottiswoode , on Electrical Discharges in Vacuo , * in which were described some phenomena bearing on the cause of stratification in vacuum tubes ; we have recently repeated the experiments obtaining the same phenomena , and we have , this time , recorded them by photography , as shown in Plate 18 , fig. 6 , a and fig. 7 , a and b } and fig. 8 , a and b. The diagram , fig. 66 , exhibits the arrangement of the Fig. 66 .

The secondary wire S S ' of the induction coil was connected to a tell-tale tube V2 .

the circumstances just described , it will be remembered that a nebulous discharge occurred in V without stratification , and that no illumination of the tell-tale tube took place .
The battery was also connected at the S terminal , without any intervening resistance , to one side A A/ of a condenser , the Z terminal to a key K ; when this was pressed down , then , and only then , the other side of the B B ' condenser was connected with the battery , and it became charged .
With the condenser in action strata were produced in V , and the tell-tale tube V2 was illuminated , showing that an induced current was produced in the secondary wire ; this we ascribed to a periodic overflow from the condenser , in addition to the current which was passing continuously from the battery .
230.\#151 ; One of the most beautiful examples of the difference of discharge , with and without the condenser , was presented in December , 1874 , by tube 53 , which is represented in fig. 67 , half-size .
The negative wire lies in the axis of the tube , and reaches to within 0*25 inch of the positive terminal which enters the tube at right angles to it .
Oil the negative wire are several glass beads or bugles , kept in place by expanding the wire in one direction by a slight blow with a hammer ; the resistance of the tube , which was charged with carbonic acid , was found to be 50,000 ohms .
With 980 powder cells , without the condenser , a beautiful tuft of violet light appeared on each of the spaces of uncovered wire , without the slightest indication of stratification , but on pressing down the key K in fig. 66 , so as to connect the battery with a condenser of 0'5442 m.f. capacity , the tell-tale tube lighted up , and the discharge throughout tube 53 was stratified , as shown in fig. 67 , the strata on the uncovered portions of the wire being violet , and those on the glass-covered part salmon coloured , and much fainter .
Fig. 67 .
TUBE 53 In order to produce these effects , we find that it is essential to use an induction coil , the primary of which presents very little resistance ; for example , Apps 's 815 , the particulars of which are given in Part I. , page 106 , the resistance of the primary being only 0'245 ohm .
They cannot be obtained by using the induction coil 819 , Part I. , page 64 , this offering too much resistance , 316 ohms .
In order that the copies of the photographs in Plate 18 , referring to the phenomena , may be understood , we insert fig. 68 , which shows the disposition of the tube T T ' , ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .

and the tell-tale tube which is placed close to T T ' , so that it may be photographed at the same time as T T. The A terminal of the battery is connected to the primary of the coil at P ' , the other end of the primary being connected through the wire P to the tube ; the second wire of the tube is connected to the Z terminal of the battery ; the ends of the secondary wire of the coil to the terminals of the tell-tale tube .

In the a series there is no stratification in the vacuum tube and no illumination of the tell-tale tube , in the b series there is stratification , and the tell-tale tube is illuminated in consequence of an induced current , produced by the periodic overflow of the condenser and consequent pulsation of current , which coincides with the production of strata .
Tube 42 , Coal Gas .
231.\#151 ; Tube 42 is represented in fig. 37 , its extreme length is 12'5 inches , between the terminals 2'125 inches , its greatest diameter 3 inches , the resistance 85,000 ohms .
1080 cells , C. 0'00912 W , without the condenser , produced a nebulous light around the cup-shaped negative and reaching the heart-shaped positive , but without any strata being visible in the discharge ; the tell-tale tube was not illuminated , thus showing that there was no detectable pulsation in the current , fig. 6 , a , Plate 18 .
When , however , the condenser was connected with the battery by pressing down the key K , fig. 66 .
then the discharge was a stratified one , and the tell-tale tube indicated by its illumination that the current through tube 42 was a pulsating one , fig. 6 , b , Plate 18 .

By charging up the condenser of 44*8 m.f. and allowing it to run down through the tube , it was ascertained , by measurement with the electrometer , that the current of 415 cells would just pass .
The battery of 1080 cells gave a current of *03754 weber in short circuit ; the condenser employed in all cases was -g-th of G , Part I. , page 99 , having a capacity of about 0*66 microfarads ; when brought into action , by pressing down the key K , fig. 41 , there was no intervening resistance between it and the battery , and supposing it to be completely discharged automatically as soon as it was charged to the full potential , the current was sufficient to effect this 52*77 times in a second.'* To pass through the tube , however , the battery-current had to expend a certain amount of electro-motive force to overcome the impediments offered by the residual gas in the tube , and also the small resistance of the primary of the induction coil , so that the potential in the condenser might become somewhat higher than that necessary to overcome these impediments , and therefore from time to time an extra current from the condenser could pass through the tube , producing pulsations in the current through the primary of the induction coil , which are rendered evident by the glow in the tell-tale tube connected with the secondary wire of the coil .
These * The time required to charge the condenser to the potential of 1 volt Avould be 0\#166 ; 0 3* 7 $ q x 0*00000066= 0*00001758 second , or it would be charged to the potential of 1080 cells ( assuming them to be equal to volts ) = 52'77 times per second .
ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
227 intermittent extra currents would in all probability occur when the potential of the condenser had risen only a very little above that of the terminals in the tube , and would consequently take place very many times more rapidly than 52*77 times in a second of time , as nothing approaching the full charge of the condenser passes on these occasions .
The phenomena do not occur when a very large condenser , 42*8 microfarad for example , is employed in the way shown in fig. 26 , Part I. , page 100 , for then no current passes through the tube until the condenser has become charged to a sufficiently high potential , and this occupies a sensible time , about thirty seconds , and when it passes it does so continuously and steadily .
On the other hand with a small condenser , used as shown in fig. 66 , the current commences to pass almost instantaneously through the tube , and in all probability divides itself as soon as the key K is pressed down , part continuing to pass through the tube , and paid entering the condenser and discharging itself intermittently through the tube .
\#171 ; , In order to test whether it would be possible to render evident pulsations , in the current , too feeble to cause the illumination of the tell-tale when perfectly steady strata are produced in tubes containing residual gases , we arranged the detector apparatus as shown in fig. 69 .
Fig. 69 .
coil 819 MECOHNT A Z is the battery ; A being connected through the fluid resistances Fit Fit ' ( which can be plugged out of circuit by means of P and P ) , the megohm , and the primary of coil No. 819 , to the terminal T ' of the tube ; A is also connected direct to one plate of the condenser C. Z is connected through the key K to the fluid resistance FR " ( which can be plugged out by pressing down the key K ' ) , thence to 2 g 2 the other plate of the condenser , and through the safety wire to the other terminal T of the tube .
The secondary wire of coil 819 is connected to a delicate Thomson galvanometer T. The apparatus being so arranged , if K is pressed down the condenser charges up ( more rapidly when K/ is also pressed down than when the current is allowed to pass through the resistance FR " ) , and when it has reached a certain potential the current commences to pass steadily through the tube and the primary of the induction coil 819 , and will continue to do so after the connexion with the battery is interrupted by raising the key K. The condenser discharges itself more or less rapidly through the tube according to its resistance , and the external resistance introduced into the circuit at FR , FR ' , and the megohm .
The fluid resistance FR " has no effect upon the time occupied by the charge running out of the condenser , as the current does not pass through it when the key K is allowed to rise so as to disconnect the battery , as will be easily seen by referring to the diagram .
The only use of FR " is to regulate the rate of inflow of the charge , and it may be so adjusted as to feed the condenser exactly as fast as it loses its charge .
By pressing down the keys K ' and K the condenser is maintained at the highest potential possible with a given number of elements , a given tube , and a certain external resistance .
It is quite evident that even if pulsations do take place in the current through the tube , no effect would be produced on the galvanometer in connexion with the secondary of the induction coil , provided the rise and fall of the current were equal and in equal periods .
The case would , however , be different provided either the rise or the fall were more rapid relatively to the other , and one might expect under these circumstances that there would be some movement of the needle of the galvanometer , notwithstanding that its period of oscillation was not synchronous with the pulsations of the current .
A dynamometer would evidently be a much better instrument for detecting pulsations in the primary current , because the reversal of the current does not affect its deflection , which is cumulative in the same direction .
We had one constructed as delicate as possible in which the moveable coil was suspended by a platinum wire only O'OOl inch in diameter , but it was found to be far too sluggish for our purpose .
Between the terminals of the Thomson galvanometer is inserted a shunt-box , by which the current of the secondary wire may be reduced to njth , y^th , or x'ooof^1 part before passing through it ; this shunt-box also has a short-circuit plug , by means of which , when so desired , the current may be entirely shut off from the galvanometer .
The shunt-box is not shown in the diagram .
In order to ascertain the direction of the current in the secondary wire , the condenser was disconnected in the first instance , the short-circuit plug of the galvanometer being removed , and contact made with the battery so as to send the current through the tube , the swing of the galvanometer indicated the direction , ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
229 say to the right , for the make-contact or inverse current ; the contact was then broken and the swing , say to the left , was that for break-contact or direct current .
It is almost needless to state that the primary current was suitably reduced by inserting resistances in the circuit , and that of the secondary by the use of suitable shunts to prevent injury to the Thomson galvanometer .
Having thus ascertained the direction of swing for direct or inverse currents , the condenser was connected up , the short-circuit plug having been previously inserted between the terminals of the galvanometer so as to prevent any disturbance of it on making contact ; as soon as the condenser had acquired a sufficiently high potential the short-circuit plug was removed .
If the battery were left on there was frequently a slight inverse ( make-contact ) current indicated by the swing of the galvanometer .
If the battery was now ( after the insertion of the short-circuit plug ) disconnected , there was a continuous direct current observed as the charge of the condenser ran gradually down so soon as the short-circuit plug was removed .
The first of the two cases was equivalent to an infinite number of make-contacts , the second to an infinite number of break-contacts .
Many observations were made with coil No. 819 , which we had taken to pieces several times during the course of our trials on account of suspected leakage from the primary to the secondary wire .
It was ultimately entirely remade in February , 1878 , and the secondary wire coiled on a separate ebonite cylinder to ensure efficient insulation , which was accomplished .

In every case where the strata are to the eye or rotating mirror perfectly steady , slight deflections of the needle are seen ; these generally indicate a resultant direct current ( break-contact ) , and in the fewer number of cases an inverse current indicating , in the first case , a sudden decrease and slow increase of current through the tube .
These deflections , though very manifest , do not amount to more than about three or four divisions of the galvanometer scale , a deflection which indicates a current of only 0*00000000023 W. At the advent or retreat of a stratum at the positive pole there is frequently produced a deviation of 300 divisions , indicating a current of 0*00000001812 W ; before a stratum leaves the positive terminal or dies out on it , there is usually a tremulous motion of that stratum visible to the eye and indicated by rapid pulsations of the galvanometer .
On the suggestion of Professor Clerk Maxwell we have recently introduced the telephone into the primary current , as shown in fig. 70 , and also in the secondary current of coil 819 .
In all cases where the condenser C was discharging itself gradually through the tube a low rustling sound was distinctly audible to sensitive ears so long as the stratification remained apparently perfectly steady .
When the phase of confused stratification , which immediately precedes extinction , was reached , the sound in the Eig .
70 .
TELEPHONE MECOHM telephone became very loud and rose in pitch , with some tubes becoming quite shrill .
These results , therefore , confirm the conclusion already arrived at from other experiments , namely , that the discharge in vacuum tubes is intermittent ; but we do not pretend that they make it manifest that stratification is dependent upon intermittence .
" In the course of our experiments we have arrived at the following facts :\#151 ; 1 .
The discharge in a vacuum tube does not differ essentially from that in air and other gases at ordinary atmospheric pressures ; it cannot be considered as a current in the ordinary acceptance of the , but must be of the nature of a disruptive discharge , the molecules of the gas acting as carriers of electrifcation .
* * Mr. Spottiswoode informs ns ( June 3 , 1878 ) that he has also tried the telephone inserted in the circuit , both from the Holtz machine and from the great condenser , and found that the rushing noise was coincident with well developed striae .
The sound , however , occasionally became inaudible ( to human ears , D. and M. ) , and afterwards recovered its strength .
When the tension in the condenser fell below a certain point , or the speed of the machine was reduced below a certain rate , indicated by a sudden change in the configuration of the striae , the rushing noise was replaced by a musical note , the pitch of which fell with the tension .
The range of this note was in some cases considerably greater than an octave , and its pitch fell more often by semitones than gradually .
The range both in pitch and in duration was increased by resistance introduced in the circuit .
The pitch of the note was lowered by bringing the finger near to the tube , and thereby constricting the discharge .
ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
231 The gases in all probability receive impulses in two directions at right angles to each other , that from the negative being the more continuous of the Metal is frequently carried from the terminals and is deposited on the inside of the tube , so as to leave a permanent record of the spaces between the strata .
2 .
As the exhaustion proceeds the potential necessary to cause a current to pass diminishes up to a certain point , whence it again increases , and the strata thicken and diminish in number , un a point is reached at which , notwithstanding the high electromotive force available , no discharge through the residual gas can be detectedAThus , when one pole of a battery of 8040 cells , was led to one of the terminals of tube 143 , fig. 37 , which has a radiometer attached to it , the other terminal of the tube , distant only 0T inch , being connected through a sensitive Thomson galvanometer to the other pole of the battery ( earth ) , the current observed was not greater than that which was found to be due to conduction over and through the glass .
Although no current passed , the leading wires acting inductively stopped the motion of the radiometer , as has been observed by Mr. Justice Grove .
3 .
All strata have their origin at the positive pole .
Thus , in a given tube , with a certain gas , there is produced at a certain pressure , in the first instance , only one luminosity which forms on the positive terminal , then , as the exhaustion is gradually carried further it detaches itself , moving towards the negative , and being followed by other luminosities , which gradually increase in number up to a certain point .
4 .
With the same potential the phenomena vary irregularly the amount of current .
Sometimes , as the current is increased , the number of strata in certain tubes increases , and as it is diminished their number decreases ; but with other tubes the number of strata frequently increases with a diminution of current .
If the source of the current is a charged condenser , the flow being from one of its plates through resistances and the tube to the other : then , as the potential of the condenser falls and the current diminishes , the number of strata alters ; if the strata diminish in number with the fall of potential , then the stratum nearest the positive wire disappears on it , the next then follows and disappears , and so on with others ; if , on the other hand , the charge of the condenser is very gradually increased , the strata pour in , one after the other , in the most steady and beautiful manner from the positive .
5 .
A change of current frequently produces an entire change in the colour of the strata .
For example , in a hydrogen tube from a cobalt blue to a pink .
* De La Rue and Muller , Phil. Trans. , 1878 , Vol. 169 , p. 90 and p. 118 .
t From observations with pressure varying from 6-4 to 145'1 millims. , Wiedemann and Ruhlmann conclude that the accumulation requisite to produce discharge increases with the pressure at first quickly , then more slowly ; towards the upper limit of their experiments it becomes nearly proportional to the pressures .
It also changes the spectrum of the strata ; moreover , the spectra of the illuminated terminals and the strata difler .
6 .
If the discharge is irregular and the strata indistinct , an alteration of the amount of current makes the strata distinct and steady .
Most frequently a point of steadiness is produced by the careful introduction of external resistance ; subsequently the introduction of more resistance produces a new phase of unsteadiness , and still more resistance another phase of steady and distinct stratification .
7 .
The greatest heat is in the vicinity of the strata .
This can be best observed when the tube contains either only one stratum , or a small number separated by a broad interval .
There is reason to believe that even in the dark discharge there may be strata ; for we have found a development of heat in the middle of a tube , in which there was no illumination except on the terminals .
8 .
Even when the strata are to all appearance perfectly steady , a pulsation can he detected in the current ; hut it is not proved that the strata depend upon intermittence .
9 .
There is no current from a battery through a tube divided by a glass division into two chambers , and the tube can only be illuminated by alternating charges .
10 .
In the same tube and with the same gas , a very great variety of phenomena can be produced by varying the pressure and the current .

At the same pressure and with the same current , the diameter of the tube affects the character and closeness of the stratification .
Our special thanks are due to Professor Stokes for many valuable suggestions and criticisms during the course of our investigation .
We have very great pleasure in stating that during the last twelve months we have had the benefit of the zealous assistance of Mr. W. Sharpey Seaton , formerly in the service of Professors Sir Wm. Thomson and Fleeming Jenkin , and that we have found his familiarity with electrical measurements , and his resources in devising methods of overcoming the many impediments we have encountered in connexion with them , of the greatest value .
Mr. Fram has continued to give us zealous , intelligent , and patient assistance , and has helped us over many difficulties .

233 facts to contribute to the general stock of knowledge ; but the field before us is so inexhaustible , that we think it better to offer the small amount of produce we have collected , with much labour , rather than wait , and by slightly increasing the offering , make it more acceptable .
We are now engaged in determining the differences of potential between the terminals corresponding to different pressures with a given gas and a given vacuum tube .
We defer for the present the suggestion of any theory to account for stratification , in the hope of being able to confirm experimentally certain views which we entertain as to the cause of this phenomenon .

Grove ( Phil. Trans. , 1852 , p. 87 ) makes the following conjecture on this subject in his paper on the Electro-Chemical Polarity of Gases : " Whether gases at all conduct electricity , properly speaking , or whether the transmission is not always by the disruptive discharge , the discharge by convection , or something clearly analogous , is perhaps a doubtful question ; but I feel strongly convinced that gases do not conduct in any similar manner to metals or electrolyte .
" Becquerel made a most elaborate series of experiments on the " conductivity " of gases at high temperatures\#151 ; red heat , and beyond .
These are described very fully in the Annals de Chimie , xxxix .
, 1853 , pp. 355-402 , and in abstract in the Comptes Bendus , xxvii .
, 1853 , pp 20-24 .
The discharge was obtained between two concentric cylinders , namely , a strained wire in the axis of a tube , both being of platinum ; the tube was capable of being closed at the ends so as to permit experiments at any pressure down to about 3 or 4 millims. , the limit of his pump .
He found that by heating the tube to incandescence he could produce a discharge with one cell even at atmospheric pressure , and that the current was still further increased if the pressure were diminished .
This result applied to all gases , pressures and temperatures tried , commencing at incandescence .
The order of " conductivity " at a red heat at atmospheric pressures with one cell was , hydrogen , oxygen , chlorine , ^ nitrogen } car^on^ ' anhydride ; but with very high temperatures and small pressures there seemed to be a tendency to equal " conductivity .
" He introduced a " rheostat , " consisting of a U tube filled with fluid into which wires could be inserted to a less or greater depth , and having adjusted the resistance so as to obtain a given deflection when the tube was in circuit , he subsequently put the tube out of circuit and again adjusted the rheostat so as to obtain the same deflection ; the difference between the two readings was taken by him as the resistance of the tube in terms of the rheostat .
Although he interprets his results differently , and is inclined to consider that gases at high temperatures really conduct electricity , they seem to us to support our hypothesis that the discharge is a disruptive one in all cases , even at the high temperatures he experimented with .
For his measurements show that when he employed a definite potential and adjusted the external resistance to produce different currents , the resistance of the gas appeared to decrease with the increase of current , this agreeing so far with our results .
But we are quite at a loss how to reconcile the following experiments with ours:\#151 ; " La second serie de determinations experimentales met en evidence un fait assez curieux : c'est qne pour la meme intensity electrique ( the same amount of current ) , la resistance de Fair chauffe au rouge est d'autant plus grande que le nombre des elements de la pile est aussi plus grand .
" Being unable to render an account to ourselves of this very remarkable result , we have , May 28th , 1878 , made some experiments with tube 31 , employing 1200 , 2400 , 3600 , 4800 , and 6300 cells , and by the introduction of wire resistance maintained a constant deviation of the galvanometer of 29 ' , we found that the apparent resistance of the tube was represented in each case by about 30,000 ohms .
Our experiment differed from that of Becquerel , in that we employed rarefied gas at ordinary temperature instead of heated gas at atmospheric pressure , and our rheostat consisted of wire and not of a liquid electrolyte .
Wiedemann and Ruhlmann ( Poggend .
Ann. , cxlv .
, pp. 235-259 , 364-399 ) by very different means have apparently arrived at the same result as our own .
They started from the ground that the observations of one of them ( G. Wiedemann ) on the amount of heat generated in a Geissler-tube had demonstrated that rarefied gases did not behave like metallic conductors as had been asserted by other experimentalists ( Morren , Ann. de Chim .
et de Phys. , 4e serie , iv .

Ann. , cxxxvi .
, p. 201 , \amp ; c. ) ; for the heat generated in the tube was far from varying as the square of the current .
Wiedemann and Ruhlmann selected for their source of electrification the Holtz machine , which was driven by a hydromotor , so as to give a constant current , and had so great an internal resistance as to render negligible the resistance of the external part of their circuit .
By ingenious contrivances they succeeded in measuring the time-interval between the rapidly-succeeding flashes of which the discharge in rarefied gases , under the circumstances of their experiments , was proved to consist .
They found that , when other things were kept constant and the current alone varied , the time-interval between a pair of successive discharges was inversely proportional to the current : in other words , the quantity which flowed across the tube at each discharge was constant for all the values of current investigated by them .
Hence , as fast as a certain definite accumulation of electricity ( density ) was attained on the terminals , these discharged themselves , became recharged to the same accumulation and discharged themselves again , and so on .
So far , therefore , as their observations extend , they seem entirely accordant with our own result stated above , for it is obvious that as the interval between the discharges in their experiments did not exceed 0'002 second , the effect on any electrometer as yet devised would be practically the same as if the terminals were kept constantly charged to that potential which they have when the accumulation is sufficient to cause discharge ; a fortiori , would this be the case when a battery of small internal resistance is substituted for the Holtz machine .
The range of Wiedemann and Ruhlmann 's observations on this point appears , however , to have been very limited ; in their illustrations of the constancy of the quantity flowing across at each discharge when the current is varied , the relation between the maximum and minimum currents employed is 40 : 24'5 .
ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
237 Note C , relating to Page 221 .
In support of the observation as to possible dependence of stratification upon the concurrence of axial and radial impulses from the positive and negative terminals respectively , we quote the following experiments :\#151 ; Gassiot ( Phil. Trans. , pp. 1-16 ) used tubes supported in a vertical position , in which were produced Torricellian vacua , with an arrangement for causing the mercurial column to rise and cover one terminal or fall , and leave it exposed .
" When the upper wire is negative and the lower positive , if the mercury in the globe is allowed to ascend the tube , the stratifications collapse , but the dark band between them and the negative glow remains ; as the mercury rises the stratification merges into a series of rings on the surface of the mercury , which when the circuit of the primary is broken is not found to be tarnished , but as bright as when the experiment commenced .
On reversing the direction of the current , when the mercury is permitted to ascend immediately it covers the negative wire the stratifications disappear and the interior of the globe is filled with bluish light ; a bright spot of light is visible on the end of the positive wire , but the mercury no longer exhibits the red glow , its entire surface , until it ascends to within an inch of the positive wire , being covered with a brilliant white phosphorescent film about one-eighth of an inch in thickness .
" He also ( Phil. Trans. , 1859 , pp. 137-160 ) had constructed a tube in which a moveable terminal might be made to drop into a brass tubular case surrounded by a glass protecting tube of small bore which projected beyond the brass case , so that the point could at will be made to project beyond this glass sheath or to fall within it .
" When both wires were exposed the stratified discharges show the clear cloudlike appearances so often described , whether A ( the moveable terminal ) is positive or negative ; but if A is made negative and the tube inclined so as to let the wire drop into the brass tubing , almost all trace of stratifications immediately disappear .
" He found that if he enclosed the terminals in a glass tube of very small bore projecting about an eighth of an inch beyond the end of the wire , the emanation from the negative might be constrained to take a forward direction .
" The negative discharge issuing through the orifice as from a jet ... ... ... ... ..If the wire ( negative ) is inclined a little the discharge will impinge against the side of the vacuum tube , brilliantly illuminating the spot on which it impinges ... ... ... .If the discharge is continued for a few seconds that portion of the tube on which the discharge impinges will be sensibly heated .
" Gassiot also states ( Phil. Trans. , 1858 , p. 10 ) that : " The emanation of particles only proceeds from the negative , not in a direct line from the positive , but laterally .
" Again , p. 11 : " Such particles being always deposited in a lateral direction from the wire , and not beyond the line on the glass tube even with the end of the wire .
" p. 13 : " The force from the positive is not accompanied by the transfer of particles from the metallic terminal .
" Hittorf ( Pogg .
Ann. cxxxvi .
, 1869 , pp. 1\#151 ; 31 and 137-194 ) describes various experiments bearing on this point .
Thus , in a tube having two parallel electrodes at 4 m.m. distance , the negative glow radiated in all directions through the tube , but the positive discharge appeared only on the side of its terminal which was remote from the negative electrode .
In another tube it was observed that when one of the terminals was bent back upon itself , if this is made positive , the discharge curls round so as to present itself towards the negative ; but when the bent terminal is made negative the glow remains directed away from the positive .
He also describes an interesting experiment which exhibits in a striking manner the influence of the size of the space surrounding the electrodes , but it is complicated by the influence of the distance between the terminals , which latter influence has a value varying with the degree of rarefaction as shown by other experiments of the same physicist ( see footnote , p. 163 ) .
A vessel consisting of two spherical glass bulbs joined by a short glass tube of 1 m.m. in diameter had two straight wires , for terminals , running horizontally one through each bulb and extending into the junction-tube so as to leave a space of only 1 m.m. between their extremities .
The bulbs were also connected at the upper ends of their vertical axis by another long glass tube of the same bore as the short junction-tube .
As the gas within the double vessel was rarefied , the discharge which , at higher pressures , had passed exclusively through the short tube began to divide itself and passed through the long circuitous route in proportion increasing with the decrease of pressure until a degree of rarefaction was attained , at which it passed exclusively through the long junction tube .
It has been noticed by ourselves and others that the size of the negative terminal has considerable influence upon the general character of the discharge , and that with a very small negative it is difficult to produce striae at all .
With a view of testing this further , Spottiswoode constructed a tube in which the length of one terminal could be altered , while the total distance between the extremities of the two terminals remained unchanged .
With this contrivance it was found that when the negative terminal was lengthened the dark space was shortened by a prolongation of the positive column .
Thus the tube being about 12 inches in length , an increase in the length of the negative terminal from 3 to 6 inches caused a diminution in that of the dark space from 3 to 1'5 inches .
The importance of size of the negative terminal was also illustrated by Spottiswoode in a striking manner with a tube 18 inches in length and l-75 in diameter , containing from 30 to 50 cubic centimetres of mercury .
When the tube was laid on its side so as to leave the negative terminal , which was small , free from mercury , the tube was filled with an unbroken glow of light ; but as soon as the mercury touched the terminal , a fine column of strife was developed .
When the mercury spread along any considerable part of the tube , the column still stretched out towards the negative terminal ; but it was repelled to the side of the tube opposite to that occupied by the mercury , and the individual striae assumed an oblique position , as if under the influence of two forces , one along the other at right angles to the axis of the tube .
