) The problem of waves in conducting tubes has already been treated by various authors .
* Nevertheless , the solutions here proposed , offering certain peculiarities with respect to the velocity of the corresponding waves , and partly also with respect to the shape .
and distribution of the lines of orce , seemed worthy of notice .
Let be measured along the axis of an infinite right cylindrical tube of circular section .
The material of the tube is assumed to be a perfect conductor , its interior being empty or filled with air .
The electromagnetic waves will be assumed throughout to be axially symmetrical and of permanent type , i.e. to conserve all their features while proceeding along the tube .
If be the distance of a point from the axis , further , and the * J. J. Thomson , 'Recent Researches in Electricity and Mgnetism , ' 1893 ; Lord Bayleigh , 'Phil .
