A. Wright on Opium those of the medullary cylinder .
The bark of the fossil plants is compared with those of Lycopodium chamcecyparissus and Selaginella which two combined represent the former .
These discoveries necessitate some changes in generic nomenclature , since the several parts of the plant not only represent the three genera above mentioned , but also several others .
Meanwhile some other errors require correction .
Corda erroneously defined his genus Diploxylon as having no medullary rays , and Brongniart relied upon this distinction in separating Diploxylon from Sigillaria ; but no difference exists between the ligneous structures of the two genera , so far as Sigillaria is illustrated by Brongniart 's 5 .
elegans .
Corda , Brongniart , and King all agree in regarding Diploxylon ( which is identical with Witham 's Anabathra ) as belonging to the Gymnospermous Exogens .
The necessity for abandoning this separation of the plants in question from the , urged in the author 's previous memoir , is now made more obvious than before , the distinctions upon which the great French botanist relied in his classification being now shown to be such as mere differences of age can produce .
The author concludes from his own observations that the genera bathra , Lomatophloios , and Leptoxylon must be united .
Brongniart had already brought into one generic group Corda 's genera , Leptoxylon , and Calamoxylon , Goppert 's genus Pachyphyllum , and Sternberg 's genus Lepidophloios , giving the latter name to the whole .
Hence no less than six obsolete generic names are disposed of .
The author finally follows Brongniart in adopting the term Lepidophloios , and temporarily assigns to the plant described the trivial name of L. brevifolium .
The further relations of this genus to more ordinary forms of Lepidodendron require further investigation .
Much credit is due to G. Grieve , Esq. , of Burntisland , for the energy with which he has worked amongst the deposits at Burntisland ; and the author acknowledges his great obligations to that gentleman for liberal supplies of specimens for examination .

On the Action of Hydriodic Acid on Morphia in presence of Phosphorus .
It has been shown in Part III .
of these researches* that when hydriodic s acid acts on codeia in presence of phosphorus , a series of products are ulti# Supra , p. 8 .
204 Dr. C. R. A. Wright 's Contributions to the [ Mar. 14 } mately obtained which may be considered as formed by the following train of reactions:\#151 ; Codeia .
c " HS1 NO , + HI = cn3i Morphia .
+ C"H"NO " Morphia .
C"H1 , NOa + 2III = i. Hypothetical new base X. + C"HslNO " Hypothetical new base X. C,7 H2l no , + 2III = i , Hypothetical new base Y. + H20 + C1iII,1N0j .
These two hypothetical bases , X and Y , then serve as the foundations of two series of new products expressible by the general formulae 4X+wHI 4Y + ^HI+pH20 .
In accordance with these views , it might be anticipated that , on treating morphia with hydriodic acid and phosphorus , either the same products , or at least products belonging to these same series , would ultimately result , which is in fact the case .
The morphia used in these experiments was presented for the purpose by Messrs. Macfarlane of Edinburgh , to whom the writer has already been so much indebted for similar acts of liberality ; the hydriodic acid was prepared as described in Part III .
, and contained 50 to 55 per cent , of HI .
On dissolving morphia by the aid of heat in about four times its weight of this acid , a marked brown coloration is visible , indicating the separation of iodine ; on adding phosphorus and continuing to heat , this colour ultimately disappears , a colourless syrupy liquid being obtained , which is freed from amorphous phosphorus and the phosphorus acids produced during the reaction by filtration through asbestos while hot , precipitation by water \amp ; c. , precisely as in the case of the similar codeia products .
On thus treating codeia , one or other of three products appear to be formed , according to the temperature employed , viz.:\#151 ; At 100 ' ... ... ... 4X + 6HI .
At 110'-115 ' . .
4X +6HI\#151 ; 2H2 O. Boiled up to 130 ' 4Y + 6HI-2H20 .
In the case of morphia , however , the resulting product is the same at whatever of these temperatures the reaction ensues , and has the composition 4X + 6III \#151 ; 2II2 O. Thus the following numbers were obtained after complete drying at 100':\#151 ; ( A ) Digested four hours at 100 ' .

In physical properties and qualitative reactions the substance thus got is indistinguishable from the product of the same composition obtained from codeia ; like the codeia product , too , it loses the elements of HI on long-continued boiling with water , S 2 .
Action of Water on the foregoing Compounds .
When the original substance C63H82I2N4O10 , 4HI is boiled for five hours with about three hundred times its weight of water , a liquid is obtained from which white flakes separate on cooling ; these have the same curious microscopical structure as the body similarly obtained from codeia , and gave the following numbers after drying at 100':\#151 ; 0-3680 grm. gave 0*6220 C02 and 0"1770H20 .

160 9 19 C63H8lIN4Ol0,4HI 1752 100 06 Hence this substance is formed by the reaction cs8 H8212 N4 O10,4HI=HI + c68 H811N4 O10 , 4HI* identical with that which takes place with the corresponding compound in the codeia series .
When the compound C68 HS11N4OJ0 , 4HI from codeia is further treated Dr. C. R. A. Wright 's Contributions to the [ Mar. l4( with excess of water and boiled for several hours , a further elimination of tbp elements of HI has been shown to take place , the end product having CO " position C.s H , .
K. O. 4HI , as stated in Pact III .
, how\#153 ; , , it i , very difficult to push this reaction to its extreme .
Piecisely the same facts are observable with the above morphia product ; by boiling this with three hundred times its weight of water for three hours , halt the basic iodine it contains is eliminated as HI , forming a product which may be either a mixture of equivalent quantities of C68 H311 N4 Ol0 , 4 III and C II N O10 , 4HI , or a single substance of the formula O)30H101IN4O10 , SHI .
If this latter be the case , the formulae hitherto attributed to the derivatives from codeia and morphia obtained by the action ot III are only halt the true ones ; and the formation of this substance may be expiessed by the equations C133H1MI4N8O20 , 8HI=2HI + CiaeH16212N8O20 , SHI , C136H1G3I3N8O20 , SHI= HI+C13aH16llN3O20 , 8III .
The following considerations tend to show that this body is a single substance and not a mixture 1st .
By treating the compound hitherto described as C68HtjlIN4O10,4HI from codeia with water , a body which has the composition of C13BH161IN8O20 , SHI is produced previously to the production of the substance hitherto described as C68 Hso N4 O10 , 4HI .
Now it is not probable that in two separate instances one compound should split up into mixtures of two bodies of analogous though slightly different constitutions , these two being formed in each case in equivalent quantities .
2nd .
A body which is without doubt a single compound , and which has the formula C]36 II1331 Ns O20 , 8III , has been produced ( as will be described in a subsequent communication ) by the simultaneous action of III and P on a polymeride of codeia obtained from that base by the action of phosphoric acid : in physical and chemical properties this product much resembles the two bodies thus obtained from morphia and codeia products by the action of water ; and hence these two bodies probably contain , like it , C13e associated with I in the base .
In order to show the resemblance between , or rather the identity of the codeia and morphia products , the formulae given in Part III .
have been adopted in this paper ( viz. those containing C6S ) ; but the author has no doubt that each of the substances has really double the formula ascribed to it ( i.e. that each contains C136 ) .
The substances of composition Cl30 IIm I N8 O20 , 8III obtained , as above-mentioned , from codeia and morphia products by the continued action of water gave the following numbers on analysis after drying at 100':\#151 ; 11872.1 History of the Opium Alkaloids .

The physiological experiments of Mr. Stocker given in the next section show that no particular difference is discernible in this respect also ; hence it is concluded that the codeia products are not merely isomeric , but are identical with the eorre-[ sponding morphia derivatives .
From the fact that hydriodic acid alone does not eliminate methyl from codeia in the form of methyl iodide , but causes the separation of free iodine , it appears more probable that the formation of the compound C68 H82 Ia N4 O10 , 4HI , obtained by the action of hydriodic acid in presence of the phosphorus on codeia , is brought about in accordance with the equations:\#151 ; ( 1 ) 4C18 H2l N03 + 14HI = 4I3 + 2HaO + CT3 H0012 N4 O10,4HI , ( 2 ) C72 H9012 N4 O10,4HI + 4HI=4CHSI + C68 H8212 N4 Ol0,4HI , rather than the equations ( 3 ) c18h21no3+hi=ch3i+c17h19no3 , ( 4 ) C17H19N03 + 2HI=I2+C17H31N03 , ( 5 ) 4Cn H2l N03 + 6HI=2H2 0 + C68 H82 Ia N4 O10 , 4HI ; * .
e , that the action does not consist in the production of morphia from ( codeia and its subsequent alteration by addition of Ha , polymerization , addition of 2HI , and subtraction of 2HaO ; but that these alterations take j| placje in the codeia molecule before the elimination of methyl as CH31 , this elimination forming the last stage instead of the first .
This circumstance may account for the non-production from morphia of compounds belong-I ing to the series 4Y4-nHI+pH2 O , which are formed from codeia when i temperature of the reaction reaches 130 ' , and under other circum-1 stances ; for it might naturally be expected that the elimination of thq 208 Dr. C. R. A. Wright 's Contributions to the [ Mar. 1^ methyl group would place a portion of the molecule in a quasi-nascent condition , thereby rendering further changes more easy .
The foregoing experiments , taken into consideration together with those formerly obtained in conjunction with the late Dr. Matthiessen* , lead to several noteworthy conclusions and speculations .
( 1 ) The actions of hydrochloric , hydrobromic , and hydriodic acids on morphia and codeia are not precisely analogous ; thus the action of HC1 appears to give rise more especially to products derived from non-polyme-rized bases ; e. g. , chlorocodide , which regenerates ordinary codeia by the action of waterf .
By the action of HBr , codeia yields not only bases apparently formed from non-polymerized codeia ( bromocodide , deoxy .
codeia , deoxymorphia ) , but also bases derived from polymerized codeia and accordingly containing at least C72\gt ; and piobably C144 ( chloro- and bromotetracodeia ) .
Hydriodic acid , on the other hand , yields no body whose formula can be written as containing less carbon than C34 ; and from the physical characters of the first products of the action and the constitution of their derivatives ( many of which contain at least C68 and some apparently C13(i ) , this proportion of carbon must certainly be doubled and probably quadrupled .
Hence HC1 yields single-molecule derivatives chiefly ; HBr yields single-molecule derivatives , and also polymeride derivatives , the polyme-rides containing at least Cc8 or CT2 ( possibly the formulae attributed to bromotetracodeia and analogous bases may require doubling , as the physical character of the bases and their salts indicate that they belong to the same rank as the iodine derivatives ) ; HI yields polymeride derivatives only .
( 2 ) It being assumed that the molecules of codeia and morphia contain respectively either C33 and C17 or C36 and C34 ( which latter is probably the case , experiments now in progress indicating that the molecular formulae of these bases are double those usually ascribed to them ) , the above experiments lead to the conclusion that there exist polymerides of these alkaloids containing C72 , C144 , ... ... ... or C68 , C18 " , ... ... ... these polymerides being formed by the action of strong acids , and serving as starting-points for new series of derivatives .
Experiments to obtain these polymerides in an unaltered condition are , as has been previously stated , in progress , and apparently with success .
This facile disposition to form polymerides is not an unknown feature in alkaloids , the experiments of Anderson having shown that the pyridine bases are characterized by this property .
This fact would appear to warrant the speculation that morphia and codeia contain carbon groups analogous * Matthiessen and Wright , Proc. Roy .
Soc. vol. xvii .
pp. 455 , 460 ; and vol. xviii* p. 83 .
f Experiments are in progress which appear to show that the action of IIC1 on both codeia and morphia is capable of giving rise , when pushed to an extreme , of bases insoluble in ether , and of characters similar to chloro- and bromo-tetracodeia , with less ease , however , than HBr* j 872 .
] History of the Opium Alkaloids .
to , if not identical with , those contained in the pyridine bases ; and , in fact , experiments now in progress , in conjunction with Herr L. Mayer , apparently lead to the conclusion that pyridine is obtainable from morphia derivatives by treatment which , though energetic , is nevertheless far short of destructive distillation : indeed it may be doubted whether the carbon groups contained in the pyridine series of bases do not preexist in the bodies from which these bases are obtained by destructive distillation .
( 3 ) A comparison between the formulae of the products obtained by the three hydracids HC1 , HBr , and HI shows that while the action of HC1 is simply to replace OH by Cl , or to remove the elements of H2 O ( sometimes also replacing CH3 by H ) , that of HBr is ( in addition to the changes produced by HC1 ) to cause the addition of hydrogen to that one of the two resulting products that is derived from the nou-polymerized molecule .
Thus HC1 and codeia give C17 H17N02 apomorphia , HBr , , , , C17H19N02 deoxymorphia , which may be represented as Cl7 H19 N03\#151 ; H2 0 + H2 .
This hydrogenizing action is carried still further in the case of the derivatives obtained by HI ; thus the expressions 4C17 H19 N03 - 2H2 O + 2HI + Ha , 4C17 H19 N03- 6H2 O + 2III + Hie represent the composition of the bases obtained respectively from morphia and codeia at 130 ' .
( 4 ) Codeia appears to be a species of methylic ether of morphia , their relative constitutions being probably C " H " NO { and C " H " NO { g\#174 ; ( doubling the formulae will not alter their relations in this respect ) .
Adhering to the formula hitherto employed , the production of the same apomorphia from both alkaloids is readily accounted for thus:\#151 ; Codeia .

According to this view morphia should contain two hydroxyl groups for every C17 , and codeia only one .
Experiments are contemplated , with reference to this point , on the action of aniline , acetyl chloride , and glacial acetic acid on these alkaloids , whereby it is hoped that definite information may be gained as to the presence , or otherwise , and the number of the groups CHO ( aldehyde group ) , OH , \amp ; c. 210 Messrs. Warren De La Hue , Stewart , and Loewy [ Mar. 1^ ( 5 ) It appears not improbable that codeia and morphia may contain in their molecules benzene residues .
Schiff has pointed out* that phenols give colorations with ferric chloride , whereas the corresponding ethers or anisols do not do so ; the well-known distinction between morphia and codeia in this respect , therefore , gives some support to the idea that both may be benzene derivatives .

On the Physiological Action of some of the foregoing Derivatives .
By Reginald Stocker , 31.B .
, Pathologist in St. Mary s Hospital 31edical School .
Doses of 1 decigramme of the compound CesH811 N4O10 , 4HI from codeia , and of the similar compound from morphia , were given to an adult terrier by the mouth without producing any perceptible effect whatever ; when the dose was increased to 3 decigrammes , in each case repeated defsecation in the course of a few hours was produced , the stools being more loose than ordinarily and frequently of a dark greenish colour ; no other symptom was noticeable , and no appreciable difference in the action of the two compounds was perceptible .
Doses of 5 decigrammes of the compound CC8 H8212N4 O10 , 4III from each of these sources were given to the same dog by the mouth , with the result of producing similar repeated defsecation in the course of two or three hours ; the sole difference discernible between these and the former experiments being that the effect was produced somewhat sooner and was of longer continuance in the latter cases , a result probably pro-duced solely by the larger dose .
No material differences were observed between the codeia and morphia derivative .
The same dog was employed throughout , two or three days being allowed to intervene between each experiment , so that the animal had recovered from the effects of a former dose before the administration of another .
t 1 It would hence appear that the derivatives of polymerized C1tII211nU3 are less active than those of polymerized Cl7H19 N03 ; and also that there is no reason for considering the derivatives from codeia as different from those of morphia , the corresponding bodies having respectively the same quantitative composition and the same physical , chemical , and phy siological properties .
