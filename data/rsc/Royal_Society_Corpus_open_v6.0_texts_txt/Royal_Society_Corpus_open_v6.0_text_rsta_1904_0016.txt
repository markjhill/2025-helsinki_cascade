The question turns upon the relative nitudes of the wave-length the radius ( c ) of the sphere .
If be small , where , the of the } ) here has but little effect upon the sound to be perceived at a distance .
The following was given , showing the effecf , in directions of somewhat larger spheres:\mdash ; Here resents the tellsity of sound il sphere in directions such that is cosine of between thelll that dins which passes through the source .
Upon the scale of for values of , lvhen , that is , when the prop ] is undisturbed by any tacle .
The increased values under show that the sphere is beginning to act as a flcctor , intensity eing already more than doubled when .
In looking at these figures , the first point ( 362 .
) attention is coml ) deviation from uniformity in the intensities different directions .
Even when the of the sphere nnts to twice bhe , there is scarcely anything to be called a sound .
But is , , still more unexpected is that in the first two cases the inten , ) sphere I. ] exceeds that in a transverse direction result ) ends minly on the ) onderance of the of the first , which vanishes .
The ( of the more terms increases ; when is 2 , the ) ] is of the second order .
to a oint tmentation of will ease t total enel.gy elnitted , because source emits twice as much energy when close to a plane ( when entirely in open .
Within ) limits of table this masks the obstruction due to an , so that when , the intensity is when circumference is twice the -length when it is lJalf the source itself elnaining constant solution of the when is very cannot be obtained by this ethod , it is to expected that the intensity will be quadrupled , ( when the ) ] ) becomes a , and that when is ative the tensity will tend to vanish .
It is of interest to trace somewhat more closely the approach to this state of ) mple , case of case where it be out the I double interest , since in virtue of the law of reci)ocit iplies when , n source nd point of observation interchanged , thus the intensity oint on the ) ) due to source situated a reat distance .

This increase , corresponding to the bright point in experiment of the shadow of a circular disc , is probably the most interesting ture of the results .
A plot is yiven in fig. 1 , the elatio between le measured from the pole , and the int pp.tional to it should , perhaps , be emphasised that the dealt with is the intensity of the ) variation , to which some percipients of sound , , sensitive , are obtuse .
at the antipole a sensitive flame close to the would not ) to a distant source , since there is at that place no iodic m , as is evident from symmetry .
I now proceed to consider the case the source , as well as the ) of observation , are situated upon the sphere ; but as is more difficult the preceding , I shall not attempt so complete a treatment .
It will be supl ) osed still that 9 .

We find The product above tabulated shows signs of approacl ] the limit , as increases ; so that the series ( 17 ) is divergent when , when , as of course to be expected .
The interpretation may be followed further .

Thus , when is small , and the series tends to be divergent , we get from ( 17 ) ( 23 ) ; and this is the correct value , that represents the distance between the source and the point of obsel.vation , and on of sphere the value of is twice as great in the hood of the source as it would be were the source situated in the open .
When , at the point on the sphere immediately opposite to the source , the series converges , since takes alternately the values and .
It will be convenient to re-tabulate continuously these values from onwards without regard to sign and to exhibit the diffel.ences .

The remainder is to be found by the methods of Finite Differences .

Thus and for the actual remainder this is to be taken negatively .
The sum of the infinite series for is accordingly . . . . .

Referring to ( 17 ) , we see that the amplitude is in this case ( 26 ) .
We may compare this with the amplitude of the vibration which would occur at the same place if the sphere were removed .
Here ( 27 ) , since .
The effect of the sphere is therefore to reduce the intensity in the ratio to 03237 .
Iu like manner we may treat the case of , i.e. , when the point of observation is on the equator .
The odd vanish and the even 's take signs alternately opposite .

For other angular positions than those already discussed , not only would the arithmetical work be heavier on account of the factors , but the remainder would demand a more elaborated treatment .

OF THE METHODS OF CoMPILlNG AND CHECKTNG THE ABOVE TABLES .
Calculation the Evcn The Zonal Harmonics of even order in the foregoing tables were calculated from the formula obtained by nding ( by means of the form - ? . .

whence To culate the coefficients , an auxiliary table of values of was formed from to , to 8 decimal places ; and a similar table of from to ; so as readily to combine them to form ( to 7 decimal places ) the logarithms of the required coefficients for rent values of 7 ? .
The coefficients were then calculated to 7 decimal places from their logarithms , and checked for each value of by seeing that they added up to unity in each case .
Next , a table of values of , . .
to 7 decimals , was formed for all values of , at intervals , from to The addition of these to the logarithms of the corresponding coefficients gave the logarithms of the various terms ( except as regards sign ) in the above expansion of .
From these logarithms the terms themselves were calculated to 7 decimals and tabulated , the positive terms in black , the negative terms in red ink .
The accuracy of these terms was checked by making use of the identities ( 1 .
) ( 2 .
) ( 3 .
) This , in addition to the primary identity checked all the terms effectually except those which were multiples of These were checked by adding a number of them together and comparing their sum with sum of the coefficients multiplied in a lump by VITH AN APPENDIX BY SSOR A. In these all the to be rors due to carelessness in taking proportional parts , or any other rors .
Then the terms were added together for value of in a given value of , so obtainin the values for the actual table .
By include also subtracting , the artifice of putting } ) ositive terms in black and negative terms in red being a great in this of the work .
in this work were corrected by adding all the values of to a value of , and comparing the result with the sum ined in a differe1lt way ( see note at the end of the second auxiliary table appended ) .
Up to .
the additions and actions and checkings were all done without lnechanical , but the later values of from to , I made use of an DMONDSON 'culating machine was very kindly lent to me by In this way all the evell harmonics calculated and were ensured to be free from errol .
S , except those incidental to the last figure , which is , of , ouly approximate , as the terms used in ] calculation were lu ted to 7 ls only .
I am confident , however , that the last figul.e is nevel from the real value , and that it would be more accurate in every case to retain it in numerical work with the tables than to omit it .
The error is not usually more than in the 7th place , and I am confident that it never exceeds , whereas omitting it would lead to a possibility of in addiil 0 to its .
actual error , i. e. , to a maximun errol of I have assumed that there are very few numerical calculations requiring an accuracy greater than an approximate decimal place , and that , therefore , the vastly difliculty which would have been caused by working throughout with 8 decimals would have been wasted labour .
nlntion of Odd When the even orders were calculated , the question arose as to the best way of calculating the odd orders .
, of course , gay no difficulty , being also , was quite easy to calculate directly from its value , EDMONDSON'S machine being used for the purpose .
The emaining odd iunctions were calculated from the even ones by means of the identity The accuracy of the results was checked by the even 's from the odd ones by means of the same formula .
This ched everything .
The mode of using this formula which I adopted , betweell and inclusive , was different from that adopted between and ) inclusive , so as to minimize the effect of 7th-figure inaccuracies as much as possible .
Up to I used it in the where to ; each being thus dependent on its immediate Pdecessor and successor .
Beyond I thought it better to use it in the gressive form each thus calculated from the two orders .
believe that in this way the maximum risk of a -iigure .
occurs at when , and is not very great even there , whereas the exclusive use of either method would have greatly magnified the error at one end or other of the table .
