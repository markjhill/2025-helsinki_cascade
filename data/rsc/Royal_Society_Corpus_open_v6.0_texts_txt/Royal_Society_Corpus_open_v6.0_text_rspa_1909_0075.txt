) This memoir is concerned with continuous symmetric functions for which the double integral is either not ative , or not positive , for each function which is continuous in the interval ; in the former case the function is said to be of positive type , while in the latter it is said to be of negative type .
The importance of these classes of functions in the theory of integral equations will be gathered from Part The greater portion of the second part is devoted to a proof of the theorem that the necessary and sufficient condition , under which a continuous symmetric function , ) , is of positive type , is that the functions should never be negative , when the variable , % , are each confined to the closed interval .
This leads to several interesting properties of such a function ; for instance , if , the functions , are identically zero .
The following parts are devoted to the application of the theorem just quoted in two different directions .
Part III contains investigations of certain functions of positive type .
In particular , the necessary and sufficient conditions , under which the function is of positive type , are obtained .
Another theorem proved is to the effect that , when is of positive type , so also are the functions , where , are constant numbers lying between , or coinciding with , and
