] On July 23 a Kiel telegram announced that the comet discovered by Brooks was of the tenth magnitude .
During the next few weeks its faintness , combined with the bad state of the sky at Kensington , made it impossible to obtain any satisfactory observations .
On August 30\#151 ; the comet having got considerably brighter by this time\#151 ; an attempt was made to photograph its spectrum with the calcite prismatic camera .
No trace of spectrum could be found on the plate .
On August 31 an exposure of three hours was given , and two lines , evidently the carbon radiations X3883 and X 4737 , wTere feebly shown .
Every available opportunity has since been taken of getting a photographic record with the same instrument .
More or less successful photographs\#151 ; the degree of success depending on the state of the sky on the various evenings\#151 ; h^ve been obtained on the nights of September 6 , 11 , 16 , 20 , 26 , 28 , and 30 , October 4 .
9 , and 31 .
Between October 9 and October 31 the comet was not available , having changed in the interim from an evening object to a morning one .
The lines in the various photographs are all very broad and diffuse , and the reduced wave-lengths of the lines are probably only approximately correct .
On September 6 two weak radiations were found far in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum .
The positions of these were approximately obtained by constructing a curve from the series of hydrogen lines in an excellent photograph of the a-Cygni spectrum taken with the same instrument .
As the comet lines fall beyond this hydrogen series their wave-lengths had to be estimated by extrapolation .
In some of the later photographs these lines are much better shown , and other lines are seen when the sky conditions have been favourable .
Thus a line whose position was at first estimated to be X3183 is well seen in the photograph of September 30 between the two ultra-violet lines previousl ) mentioned .
The values obtained from the curve for the latter lines were X 3126 and X 3369 .
The Spectrum of Comet Brooks ( 1911 c ) .
Subsidiary Bands between the Bright Radiations X3883 and X4737 .
Whenever the cometary spectrum was photographed with any degree of success , three subsidiary bands were shown between the lines at X 3883 and X 4737 .
Their intensities are comparatively low and the lines are of such a diffuse nature that it is impossible to determine the wave-length of the middle of the lines with any great accuracy , especially as the lines are practically lost if any magnification is brought to bear on the spectra .
The estimated wave-lengths , obtained by comparing the cometary spectrum with that of an iron arc photographed with the same instrument , are XX 405 , 421 , and 436 .
With regard to the middle one of these it is very likely identical with the carbon band whose main head is at X4216 .
In a paper* on the spectrum of Comet 1907 d ( Daniel ) , Prof. Campbell gives a reproduction of the spectrum and a tabular list of lines which occur in it .
There is a bunch of bright lines extending from X 4020 to X4074 , the mean position of the group being about X 4047 .
There is little doubt that the broad diffuse line of the Kensington photograph is identical with the bunch of lines in Campbell 's slit spectrum .
Another well-marked , isolated , and sharply defined line in Campbell 's spectrum is X4216 , and this is probably the same line as is seen in the Kensington photograph , though in the latter it is of a very diffuse nature .
The third line , approximately at X 436 , also appears to agree in position with another well-marked bunch of lines in Campbell 's photograph .
The strongest radiations in the latter are the carbon groups , XX 3883 , 4737 , and these are the outstanding lines in the Kensington photographs .
Thus , allowing for the difference in dispersion between the Lick and Kensington spectra , and for the fact that one was taken with a slit spectroscope , while the other was photographed with an objective prism , there seems little doubt that the spectrum of Comet Daniel , at the time Campbell photographed it , was practically of the same nature as that of Brooks ' Comet during September and October .
Wave-lengths of the Ultra-violet Lines .
Assuming the middle of the strong radiation near X 388 to be X 3883 , which is the head of the so-called cyanogen group , a comparison of the comet 's spectrum with an arc spectrum of iron taken with the same instrument shows that the two stronger ultra-violet bands fall respectively on the iron r qi a a , .

[ Dec. 14 ( 1 ) from an extrapolation curve , ( 2 ) by calculation from Hartmann 's formula , were X 3104 and X 3359 .
The position of the faint line between these two which comes in in the best photograph ( September 30 ) has been estimated by comparison with the iron spectrum to be X316 .
The mean of the previous estimates was X 3164 .
The uncertainty of setting the middle of the strong diffuse line near X 388 on its exact position amongst the iron lines in the comparison spectrum , combined with the very diffuse nature and comparative weakness of the ultra-violet lines , makes it impossible to give the wave-lengths of the latter with any great accuracy , and it will be well to adopt only three figures in the wave-lengths and refer to them as the lines X 310 , X 316 , and X 337 respectively .
In order to determine , if possible , the origin of the ultra-violet bands , a series of comparison spectra was taken with the ealcite spectrograph provided with a collimator .
Long exposures on the spectrum of C02 have been made , but this has not given any clue to the origin of the cometary lines .
Other modifications of carbon are now being tried .

The difference in sky conditions on the various nights probably accounts for the fact that more lines were detected in some photographs than in others .
On the other hand , the photograph of October 31 , the first one taken after the comet had become a morning object , shows most decided changes in the 1911 .

relative intensity of some of the lines .
Of the three subsidiary bands* A 405 , \ 421 , \436 , the middle one was , in the series of spectra taken between September 16 and October 4 ( the only spectra in which it was visible while the comet was an evening object ) , invariably the weakest of the three .
In the spectrum of October 31 , however , it is the strongest of the three .
Another notable change was in the relative intensities of lines A , 3883 , A 4737 .
In the first series these two were of about equal intensity .
In the later photograph A 3883 is decidedly stronger than A 4737 .
The ultra-violet lines A 310 and A 337 , which are visible in nearly all the spectra taken when the comet was an evening object , are not seen in the spectrum of October 31 .
The changes mentioned can be seen by reference to the plate at the end of the paper .
Probable Origin of the Cometary Lines .
The identity of the cometary lines AA3883 , 4737 , 5165 , and 5635 with lines of carbon or its compounds has previously been well established .
With the object of determining the origin of the remaining lines , reference has been made to published records of laboratory spectra , especially those appertaining to carbon .
No success has attended this search .
The series of laboratory spectra recently taken here with the same object in view appears to throw no light on this point .
With regard to the origin of line A 337 , it may be said that there is a line at A 336 given under the head of cyanogen by Living and Dewar , Eder and Valenta , and by Deslandres , but as the equally strong cyanogen band , the head of which is at A 359 , is apparently entirely lacking in the cometary spectra , it cannot be claimed that the identity of A 336 with the cyanogen line of nearly corresponding wave-length has been established .
The reduction to wave-lengths and the discussion of the lines in the various cometary spectra has been undertaken by Mr. F. E. Baxandall , who has also taken part in the preparation of the paper .
The series of photographs of laboratory spectra for comparison with the cometary spectra was taken by Mr. C. P. Butler .
The wave-lengths of the ultra-violet lines were separately estimated both from an extrapolation curve and from Hartmann 's formula by Mr. T. F. Connolly .
The photographs of the comet 's spectrum were taken with the 2-inch quartz-calcite prismatic camera by Messrs. W. Moss and T. F. Connolly .

A Chemically DESCRIPTION OF PLATE .
The Kensington photographs shown on the Plate have been directly enlarged from the original negatives , the magnification being five-fold .
The upper illustration shows a comparison of the spectrum of September 30 , when the comet was an evening object , and that of October 31 , when it was a morning object .
The chief differences between the two are referred to in the paper .
The lower illustration is a comparison of a portion of the Kensington spectrum of Comet Brooks , and the Lick spectrum of Comet Daniel* ( 1907 d\ the latter having been taken with a slit spectrograph .
There can be little doubt that the two spectra are nearly identical , bunches of individual lines in the Lick spectrum being represented in the Kensington spectrum by wide and diffuse lines .

Effect of Temperature on the Duration of Active Nitrogen .
In the first paper ( S 2 ) it was mentioned that a stream of glowing nitrogen led through a tube cooled in liquid air glowed out with increased brilliancy , and then became extinguished .
There is some ambiguity in the interpretation of this experiment , since the density of the gas is locally increased by cooling ; and increased density may ( and does ) make the nitrogen expend its glowing power more quickly .
A hermetically sealed bulb containing rarefied nitrogen was excited by the electrodeless discharge .
Allowed to expend itself at room temperature , the glow in this bulb was conspicuous for more than a minute .
But if the bulb was immersed completely in liquid air immediately after excitation , and after 15 seconds withdrawn and examined , it was found to be quite dark .
The glow was very brilliant as seen under the surface of the liquid air .
This experiment proves that the glow-transformation really occurs more quickly the lower the temperature , apart from changes of density .
The same experiment was repeated , substituting boiling water for liquid air .
Again the life of the glow was shortened , but this time its brilliancy * Part I , 'Boy .
