" Tables of the Sturmian Functions for Equations of the Second , Third , Fourth and Fifth Degrees .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received December 18 , 1856 .
( Abstract .
) The general expressions for the Sturmian functions in the form of determinants , are at once deducible from the researches of Professor Sylvester in his early papers on the subject in the 'Philosophical Magazine , ' and in giving these expressions in the memoir " Nouvelles Recherches sir les Fonctions de M. Sturm , " Liouville , t. xiii .
p. 269 ( 1848 ) , I was wrong in claiming for them any novelty .
The expressions in the last-mentioned memoir admit of a modification by which their form is rendered somewhat more elegant ; I propose , on the present occasion , merely to give this modified form of the general expression , and to give the developed expressions of the functions in question for equations of the degrees , two , three , four and five .
