active physiologically , but the action diflers in kind from that simple bases , and resembles the action of natural bases or having an approximately similar chemical composition .

All the substances mined in this research are remarkable no possessing any specific paralytic action on the heart likely to syncope ; but they destroy life , in lethal doses , either by exhaustive vuIsions or by gradual paralysis of the centres of respiration , thus sphyxia .
8 .
There is no immediate action on the sympathetic system of nervea although thers is probably a secondary action , because , after large doses the vaso-motor centre , in common with other centres , becomes involved .

There is no appreciable difference between the physiological of the bases obtained from cinchona and those derived from tar .
The action of the substitution derivatives of these sub stamces will be in a further communication .

Let denote Legendre 's coefficient of the order , and tha of the order : it is required to find the need not consider the case in which ; for it is an establishsd resul that the value of the integral taken between the limits \mdash ; 1 and 1 is equal to , and the value between the limits and 1 will be half this .
We suppose now that and are different .
It is that . . .
( 1 and also that Similar expressions , of course , hold for .
Now , by a well-known process of integration by , we deduce ; this formula can also be immediately verified by differentiation and tb use of ( 2 ) .
Thus and are both eYeu or both odd , the member of tl last formula will vamsh by ( 1 ) ; thus the only case we have to consid
