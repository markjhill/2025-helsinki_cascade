]\gt ; \amp ; which it is converlient to take the density to be unity , so that it shall be expressed terms of the current , at the same time treating the Sisplacement of the medium as continuous , we shall have practically reduced it to a rfa.ce integral along the wire .
To effect this , Jet be the potentials , roughout the region , of ideal mass-distributions of densities : so that here r is the distance from the element of volume to the point considered ; then , as is null .
