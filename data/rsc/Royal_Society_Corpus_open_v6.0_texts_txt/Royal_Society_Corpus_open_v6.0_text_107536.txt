Farther observations on the feet of animals whose progressive motion can be carried on against gravity .
By Sir EVERARD HOME , Bart. V. P. R. S. Read June 27 , i816 .
irNCE my observations on the foot of the lacerta gecko and fly were laid before the Society , Mr. BAUER , of Kew , has made drawings of the feet of both these animals ; in the hands of an artist who has attained such excellence in the correct representation of objects highly magnified , the mechanism by which the feet are fitted for supporting the weight of the animal against gravity , is much better shown .
Mr. BAUER has not confined his labours to these objects , but has applied the powers of the microscope to the examination of the feet of other insects , and has enabled me to show , that the principle on which progressive motion against gravity depends , is very extensively employed by nature in the structure of the feet of insects ; indeed the means employed for this purpose are so various , as to form characters by which many genera may be distinguished .
I shall not enter farther into this enquiry than to show some of the varieties of the structure .
My friend , Dr. LEACH , whose researches in entyinology fit him so admirably for the purpose , will , I trust , prosecute this subject , and ascertain the peculiarities that belong to the feet of different insects , fitting them for their peculiar habits , of life ; which will assist him in giving a better arrangetment of the subdivisions of this numerous class than has been hitherto done .
This structure of the feet of insects , now that it is known , can be very readily demonstrated by looking at the movements of the feet of any insect upon the inside of a glass tumbler , through a common magnifying glass ; the different suckers are readily seen separately to be pulled off from the surface of the glass , and reapplied to another part .
The pockets on the under surface of the toes of the lacerta gecko , as they are represented in Plate XVII , show that what looked like a pectinated edge when seen through a common magnifying glass , consists of a complex structure , composed of rows of a beautiful fringe , which are applied to the surface on which the animal walks against gravity , while the pockets themselves are pulled up by the muscles attached to them , so as to form the cavities into suckers .
In the blue bottle fly , it will be seen , in Plate XVIII , that the suckers are two in number , that they are connected to the last joint of the toe , immediately under the root of the claw , and have a narrow infundibular neck attached to the toe , which has the power of motion in every direction ; when these suckers are to be applied , they are separated from each other , and the membrane of each is expanded so as to increase the surface ; but when disengaged , they become nearly closed , and are brought together , so as to be confined within the space between the two claws , The external edge of each sucker is beautifully serrated , and the concave surface is granulated .
When the fly is walking against gravity , and its motions are observed , they all appear to be the result of muscular action , regulated by the will of the animal .
All the six toes are supplied with suckers .
In the horse fly , the tabanus of FABRIcIUs , the suckers differ from those of the blue bottle fly in being three in number , in all other respects they are the same .
In this fly , when the suckers are not used , the two outer ones close in before the other , and are only spread out when they are to be brought into use .
In the yellow Saw fly , the cimbex lutea of FABRICIUS , the suckers are differently situated from those of the fly ; they are placed upon the under surface of the four first joints of the toes , one sucker upon each .
These suckers are spoon shaped ; they are represented in Plate XIX .
The exterior part is thin and pellucid , but at half their depth they suddenly become thicker in their coats , forming a ridge at this part which gives the appearance of an inner cup , but this is a deception ; the exterior membranous portion is alone expanded on the surface to which the sucker is applied , and the neck of the sucker forms the vacuum .
All the six feet have suckers .
The apparatus which has been described to support the animal in its progressive motion , is also applied to other purposes .
In the great water beetle , the dytiscus marginalis , in which there is no appearance of suckers on the under side of the feet of the female , they are placed on the three first joints of the first and second pair of feet of the male , as is shown in Plate XX .
; from which it is evident , that such suckers are used to retain the female in the embrace of the male .
In the male , the three first joints of the feet of the 834 fore legs have the form of a shield , the under surface of which is covered with suckers , one very large , a second one-third smaller , and all the rest very small .
In the second pair of feet , the corresponding joints are much narrower in proportion , and are covered on their under surface with very small suckers .
All these suckers , as is seen in Fig. 13 , 14 , and 15 , have long tubular necks , which show more plainly than in the others the mode in which the vacuum is produced ; it is exactly similar in its effect to that of a piece of leather with a string in the centre , applied in a moistened state to the surface of a stone .
Having explained this apparatus , so beautifully contrived to attach the feet to the surface on which the animal moves , I shall conclude this Paper by an account of a structure of a very different kind , for the purpose of taking off the jar when the body of the insect is suddenly brought from a state of motion to a state of rest : this is met with in the grylli and locustae .
Some of them have suckers at the ends of the toes , others have not .
In a species of gryllus with a corcelated thorax , brought from Abyssinia , by Mr. SALT , the feet are made up of three joints ; on the under surface of the first are three pair of globular cushions , filled with an elastic fibrous substance , looser in its texture towards the circumference , which renders it still more elastic ; under the second joint is one pair of similar cushions , and under the last joint , immediately between the claws , is a large oval sucker .
A similar sucker is met with between the claws in a British grasshopper , the acrydiurm biguttulum ( LATR .
) These are common to all the six feet .
They are represented in Plate XXI .
U lu2 325 In the locusta varia , whose feet have four joints , under the first are two very small globular cushions , and two large oval ones ; under the second , a corresponding pair of oval ones ; and under the third , a pair of cushions different from the others , in being much larger , globular , and semi-transparent ; there is no sucker between the claws , and this insect has no power of supporting itself against gravity .
As the flea has powers of jumping not exceeded by any other insect , it was natural to expect a similar apparatus under its feet ; but as no such cushions are met with , we must conclude that the lightness of its body rendered them unnecessary .
