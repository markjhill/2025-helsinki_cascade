~ from Dr. Turbervile of Salisbury containing some considerable Observations in the Practise of Physic .
Sir !
I will now proceed in communicating more of my Observations to you ; at present be pleased to accept these which follow .
I had a Gentlewoman my Patient , who was much troubled with the falling Sickness ; in her Water I saw a great number of short Worms , full of legs , and like Millepedes : I gave her two or three purges , first with Pil : Agaric : ~ Rhubarb ; but I still perceived , in every Water was brought me , eight , or ten , or more , of the Worms ; they appeared lively , and full of Motion ; and the fits continued daily : at last I gave Her half an ounce of Oxymel Helleboratum in Tansy Water ; which wrought well and was successful ; so that she had a complete cure .
I shall leave you to judge of the cause of the Malady .
About six or seven years since , I had a Gentleman ( Mr. Oyliff by name , ) in cure of his Eye ; which was as big as my fist , black , fleshy , and full of bluish bladders ; this I judgd to be a Cancer : after purging , and bleeding , I cut out the ball , and ulcerd flesh , by many Cuts , which were all insensible to Him , till I came to the Optic Nerve : at the last Cut He complaind , and bled a little ; the Wound was healed in about a fortnight ; He now wears a black patch over the place .
Not long after this , a young man ( my Patient , ) had an Eye as big as a Hen 's Egg , very fair , without blemish , Rheum , or redness ; and his sight was pretty tolerable ; I judgd these Symptoms to proceed from thin humors fallen on the Eye , and Extending its Coats : I cured this distemper by applying drying Medicines to the head , and Eyes , and making an Issue in Nuch a , appello Morbum Oculum Bovinum , sive Oculi Hydropem : If these Observations are acceptable to you , you may command more of a like nature from .
Sarum Your very humble Dec. 10th Servant 1684 .
Dawbeney Turbervile .
