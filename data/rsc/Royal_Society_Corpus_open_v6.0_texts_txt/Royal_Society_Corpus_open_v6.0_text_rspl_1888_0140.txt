102 On the Properties of Sulphur .
Presents .
[ Dec. 6 , The formation of a film of lower refractive index on the glass would account for the defect in the reflected light ; but to account for the excess , it seems necessary to assume that the polishing has increased the optical density of the surface-layer , and the changes produced in the amount of light transmitted and in the angle of polarisation support this view .
After being polished , the surface of flint glass seems to alter somewhat readily , the amount of the reflected light decreasing , and the amount of the transmitted increasing , whilst with crown glass the change , if any , proceeds very slowly .
There is no evidence to show to what particular cause these changes are due .
The values of the transmission coefficients for light of mean refrangibility for the two particular kinds of glass are given , and show that for 1 cm .
the loss by obstruction amounts to 2'62 per cent , wiih the crown glass and 115 per cent , with the flint glass .
