Second Memoir on Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls .
By A. CAYLEY , F.B.S. Received April 29 , -Read May 26 , 1864 .
THE principal object of the present memoir is to establish the different kinds of skew surfaces of the fourth order , or Quartic Scrolls ; but , as preliminary thereto , there are some general researches connected with those in my former memoir ' On Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls"* , and I also reproduce the theory ( which may be considered as a known one ) of cubic scrolls ; there are also some concluding remarks which relate to the general theory .
As regards quartic scrolls , I remark that M. CHASLES , in a footnote to his paper , " Description des courbes de tous les ordres situees sir les surfaces reglees du troisieme et du quatrieme ordres " t , states , " les surfaces reglees du quatrieme ordre ... .admettent quatorze especes .
" This does not agree with my results , since I find only eight species of quartic scrolls ; the developable surface or " torse " is perhaps included as a " surface reglee ; " but as there is only one species of quartic torse , the deficiency is not to be thus accounted for .
My enumeration appears to me complete , but it is possible that there are subforms which M. CHASLES has reckoned as distinct species .
On the Degeneracy of a Scroll , Article Nos. 1 to 5 .
1 .
A scroll considered as arising from any geometrical construction , for instance one of the scrolls S(m , n , p ) , S(m2 , n ) , S(m3 ) considered in my former memoir , or say in general the scroll S , may break up into two or more inferior scrolls S ' , S",. .
; but as long as S ' , S",. .
are proper scrolls ( not torses , and afortiori not cones or planes ) , no one of these can be considered , apart from the others , as the result of the geometrical construction , and we can only say that the scroll S given by the construction is the aggregate of the scrolls S ' , S",. .
; and the like when we have the scrolls S ' , S " , ... , each repeated any number of times , or say when S S'S"P ... Suppose however that the scrolls S ' , S " , .
are any one or more of them a torse or torses-or , to make at once the most general supposition , say that we have S= ES ' , where 2 is a torse , or aggregate of torses ( I= a ... ) and S ' is a proper scroll or aggregate of proper scrolls ; then , although it is not obligatory to do so , we may without impropriety throw aside the torse-factor 2 , and consider the original scroll S as degenerating into the scroll S ' , and as suffering a reduction in order accordingly .
2 .
As an illustration , consider the scroll S(m , n , p ) generated by a line which meets three directrix curves of the orders m , n , p respectively ; and assume that the curves m , , p are each of them situate on the same scroll Z , the curve m meeting each generating line of 2 in cz points , the curve n each generating line in f3 points , and the curve p each generating line in y points .
Each generating line of X is o37p times a generating line of S , and we have S= Y$S ' , where S ' may be a proper scroll ; it is however to be noticed that if the curves n , n , p any two of them intersect , S ' will itself break up and contain certain cone-factors , as will presently appear .
And if X , instead of being a proper scroll , be a torse , then we may consider S as degenerating into S ' , the reduction in order being of course =C3c yX order of : .
3 .
But this is not the only way in which the scroll S(m , n , p ) may degenerate ; for suppose that two of the directrix curves , say n and p , intersect , then the lines from the point of intersection to the curve mn form a cone of the order m which will present itself as a factor of S ; and generally if the curves n and p intersect in a points , the curves p and rn in f3 points , and the curves m and n in y points , then we have a cones each of the order mn , j3 cones each of the order n , and y cones each of the order _p , or say S=CS ' , where C is the aggregate of the cone-factors ; and the scroll S degenerates into S ' , the reduction in order being =n+ , m-3+yp .
It is hardly necessary to remark that if a point of intersection of two of the curves is a multiple point on either or each of the curves , it is , in reckoning the number of intersections of the two curves , to be taken account of according to its multiplicity in the ordinary manner .
4 .
There is yet another case to be considered : suppose that the curves n andp lie on a cone , and that the curve m passes through the vertex of this cone ; this cone , repeated a certain number of times , is part of the locus , or we have S=C0S ' , so that the scroll S degenerates into S ' , the reduction in order being =0 order of cone .
If , to fix the ideas , the curves n and p are respectively the complete intersections of the cone by two surfaces of the orders g , h respectively ( this implies n=gk , p=hk , if 7e be the order of the cone ) , which surfaces do not pass through the vertex of the cone , and if , moreover , the vertex of the cone be an a-tuple point on the curve m , then 0=agh , and the reduction in order is = aghik .
5 .
The foregoing causes of reduction , or some of them , may exist simultaneously ; it would require a further examination to see whether the aggregate reduction is in all cases the sum of the separate reductions .
But the aggregate reduction once ascertained , then writing S(m , n , p ) for the order of the reduced scroll , we shall have S(m , n , p)= 2mnnp -Reduction .
In particular , in the case above referred to , where the curves n and p , p and mn , m and n meet in a , 3 , y points respectively , but there is no other cause of reduction , S(m , 2z , p)= 2mnp--am nyp , which is a formula which will be made use of , The foregoing investigations apply , mutatis mzttandis , to the scrolls S(m2 , n ) , S(nm3 ) ; but I do not at present enter into the development of them in regard to these scrolls .
Scrolls with two directrix lines , Article Nos. 6 to 11 .
6 .
Consider now a scroll having two directrix lines : it may be assumed that these do not intersect ; for if they did , then any generating line , qzta line meeting the two directrix lines , would either lie in the plane of the two lines , or else would pass through their point of intersection ; that is , the scroll would break up into the plane of the two lines , considered as the locus of the tangents of a plane curve , and into a cone having for its vertex the point of intersection of the two lines .
Each generating line meets any plane section of the scroll in the point where such generating line meets the plane of the section ; the plane section constitutes a third directrix ; or the scrolls in question are all included in the form S(1 , 1 , m ) , where m is a plane curve .
The order of the scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) is in general =2m ; but if the one line meets the curve a times , that is , in an cs-tuple point of the curve , and the other line meets the curve f times , that is , in a 3-tuple point of the curve , then by the general formula ( ante , No. 5 ) the order of the scroll is =2m-----3 ; and in particular if a+-3==m , then the order is =nm .
7 .
We may without loss of generality attend only to the last-mentioned case .
To show how this is , suppose for a moment that the two lines do not either of them meet the curve ; the scroll is then of the order 2m2 .
Call the point in which each line meets the plane of the curve the foot of this line , then the line joining the two ' feet meets the curve in m points ; and it is in respect of each of these points a generating line of the scroll ; that is , it is an m-tuple generating line : the section of the scroll by the plane of the curve m is in fact this line counting in times , and the curve mn ; m+m=2m , the order of the scroll .
And in like manner the section by any plane through the nm-tuple line is this line counting m times , and a curve of the order m not meeting either of the directrix lines .
But the section by any other plane is a curve of the order 2m meeting each of the directrix lines in a point which is an m-tuple point of the section ( each directrix line is in fact an m-tuple line of the scroll ) ; and by considering , in place of the particular section m , this general section , we have the scroll of the order 2mn in the form S(1 , 1 , 2m ) , where the two directrix lines each meet the section m times ; so that the order is 4mn-m-m-2m .
8 .
And so in general , m being a plane curve , when the scroll S(l , 1 , m ) is of an order superior to m , say =a+k , this only means that the section chosen for the directrix curve m is not the complete section by the plane of such curve , but that the line joining the feet of the two directrix lines is a k-tuple generating line of the scroll , and that the complete section is made up of this line counting k times and of the curve m. So that taking , not the section through the multiple generating line , but the general section , for the plane directrix curve , the only case to be considered is that in which the section is a proper curve of an order equal to that of the scroll ; or , what is the same thing , we have only to consider the scrolls S(1 , 1 , m ) for which the order is depressed from 2m to m in consequence of the directrix lines meeting the plane section Va times and ( 3 times , that is , in an ac-tuple point and a P-tuple point respectively , where c+ --=mn .
561 It is clear that in the case in question the directrix lines are an a-tuple line and a j3-tuple line respectively .
The generation is as follows : Scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) of the order m ; the curve m being a plane curve of the order gn having an a-tuple point and a 3-tuple point , where a+p3=m : the directrix lines , say 1 and 1 ' , pass through these points respectively , and they do not intersect each other .
The generating lines pass through the directrix lines 1 and 1 ' and the curve m , and we have thence the scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) .
Taking at pleasure any point on the curve m , we can through this point draw a single line meeting each of the directrix lines 1 , 1 ' ; that is , the curve m is a simple curve on the scroll .
Taking at pleasure a point on the directrix line 1 , and making this the vertex of a cone standing on the curve mn , this cone has an a-tuple line ( the line 1 ) and a 3-tuple line ( the line joining the vertex with the foot of the line V1 ) ; the line 1 ' meets this cone in the foot of the line 1 ' , counting 3 times , and besides in nm-P3 , =M points ; the lines joining the vertex with the last-mentioned points respect ively ( or , what is the same thing , the lines , other than the 3-tuple line , in which the plane through the vertex and the line 1 ' meets the cone ) are the oc generating lines through the assumed point on the line 1 ; and the line 1 is thus an oa-tuple line of the scroll .
And in like manner , through an assumed point of the directrix line 1 ' , we construct / 3 generating lines of the scroll ; and the line 1 ' is a / 3-tuple line of the scroll .
, 10 .
The scroll S(1 , 1 , gn ) now in question has not in general any multiple generating line ; in fact a multiple generating line would imply a corresponding multiple point on the section m ; and this section , assumed to be a curve having an a-tuple point and a '3-tuple point , has not in general any other multiple point .
But it may have other multiple points ; and if there is , for example , a y-tuple point , then the line from this point which meets the two directrix lines counts y times , or it is a y-tuple generating line ; and so for all the multiple points of mn other than the os-tuple point and the t3-tuple point which correspond to the directrix lines respectively .
It is to be noticed that the multiplicity y of any such multiple generating line is at most equal to the smallest of the two numbers OG and 3 ; for suppose y &gt; a , then , since a+-3=-m , we should have y+i3 &gt; n , and the line joining the y-tuple point and the 3-tuple point would meet the curve m in ry+3 points , which is absurd .
In the case of several multiple lines , there are other conditions of inequality preventing self-contradictory results ~ .
11 .
The general section is a curve of the order mn , having an x-tuple point and a 3-tuple point corresponding to the directrix lines respectively , and a y-tuple point , &amp;c. ... .
corresponding to the other multiple points ( if any ) .
A section through the directrix line 1 is in general made up of this line , counting ac times , and of j3 generating lines passing through one and the same point of the directrix line 1 ' ; if the section pass * Suppose , for example ( see next paragraph of the text ) , that there were a y-tuple generating line and a.-tuple generating line lying in piano with the line 1 ; these lines counting as ( y+ ( ) lines , must be included among the t3 generating lines through the plane in question ; this implies that y+ +/ &gt; 3 , a conclusion which must be obtainable from consideration of the curve m irrespectively of the scroll .
also through a y-tuple generating line , then , of the P generating lines in question , r ( which , as has been seen , is : &gt; |3 ) unite together in the y-tuple generating line ; and so .
for the sections through the directrix line 1 ' .
The general section through a y-tuple generating line is this line counting y times , and a curve of the order m--y , which has an ( a-y)tuple point at its intersection with the directrix line 1 , and a ( / 3-y)tuple point at its intersection with the directrix line 1 ' ; it has a 8-tuple point , &amp;c. .
at its intersections with the other multiple generating lines , if any .
Scrolls with a twofold directrix line , Article Nos. 12 to 16 .
12 .
But there is a case included indeed as a limiting one in the foregoing general case , but which must be specially considered ; viz. the two directrix lines 1 and 1 ' may coincide , giving rise to a twofold directrix line .
To show how this is , I return for the moment to the case of the scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) with two distinct directrix lines 1 and 1 ' , and , to fix the ideas , I suppose that the directrix lines do not either of them meet the curve m , so that the order of the scroll is =-2m .
Through the line 1 imagine the series of planes A , B , ( C , ... meeting the line 1 ' in the points a ' , 6 ' , c. .
; the generating lines through the point a ' are the lines in the plane A to the points in which this plane meets the curve m ; the generating lines through the point b6 are the lines in the plane B to the points where this plane meets the curve m ; and so for the generating lines through the points c , d ' ... .
And it is clear that the points a ' , b ' , ',. .
correspond homographically with the planes A , B , C , ... This gives immediately the construction for the case where the two directrix lines come to coincide .
In fact , on the twofold directrix line I=1 take the series of points a , 6 , c. .
, and through the same line , corresponding homographically to these points , the series of planes A , B , C,. .
; the generating lines through the point a are the lines through this point , in the plane A , to the points in which this plane meets the curve m ; and so for the entire series of points b , c,. .
of the line 1-=1 ' ; the resulting scroll , which I will designate as the scroll S ( 1 , 1 , n ) , remains of the order =n2m .
If there is given a point of the curve m , then the plane through this point and the directrix line is the plane A ; and the point a is then also given by the homographic correspondence of the series of planes and points , and the generating line through the given point on the curve gn is the line joining this point with the point a. 13 .
We may say that , in regard to any point a of the line 1 , the corresponding plane A is the plane of approach of the coincident line 1 ; and that in regard to the same point a and to any plane through it , the trace on that plane of the plane of approach is the line of approach of 1 ' ; that is , we may consider that the coincident directrix line IV meets the plane through a in a consecutive point on the line of approach .
In particular if the point a be the foot of the directrix line 1 ( that is , the point where this line meets the plane of the curve m ) , and the plane thiough a be the plane of the curve m , then the intersection of the last-mentioned plane by the plane A which corresponds to the point a is the line of approach , and the foot of the coincident directrix line 1 ' is 563 the consecutive point to a along the line of approach .
The expression " the line of approach , " used absolutely , has always the signification just explained , viz. it is the intersection of the plane of the curve m by the plane corresponding to the foot of the directrix line .
14 .
Suppose now that the line 1 meets the curve m , or , more generally , meets it a times , that is , in an c-tuple point ; it might at first sight appear that the coincident line 1 ' should also be considered as meeting the curve a times , and that the resulting scroll should be of the order 2m--a--a-2m--2a .
But this is not the case ; so long as the direction of the line of approach is arbitrary , the line 1 ' must be considered as a line indefinitely near to the line 1 , but nevertheless as a line not meeting the curve at all ; and the order of the scroll is thus =2m--s .
If , however , the line of approach is the tangent to a branch through the a-tuple point-that is , if the plane corresponding to the a-tuple point miet the plane of the curve in such tangent , then the coincident line V ' is to be considered as meeting the curve qn in a consecutive point on such branch , and the order of the scroll is =2m-----1 .
And so if at the multiple point there are 3 branches having a common tangent , then the coincident line 1 ' is to be considered as meeting the curve in in a consecutive point along each of such branches , or say in a consecutive P-tuple point along the branch , and the order of the scroll sinks to 2m---a-/ 3 .
The point spoken of as the a-tuple point is , it should be observed , more than an z-tuple point with a P-fold tangent ; it is really a point of union of an ac-tuple point and a 3-tuple point , or say a united c(+I3)tuple point , equivalent to 1(a1)+ ?
2(1 ) double points or nodes ; and the case is precisely analogous to that of the scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) , where the two directrix lines pass through an a-tuple point and a P-tuple point of the curve sn respectively .
It may be added that if at the multiple point in question , besides the P branches having a common tangent , there are y branches having a common tangent , then the point is , so to speak , a united cc(+3 , )+y)tuple point equivalent to ( a2(a-)+i/ 3(3---l)+2y(y -1 ) double points or n ; bt tr nodes ; but the order of the scroll is still =2m--c-j3 .
15 .
In the same way as the scrolls S(1 , 1 , m ) are all included in the case where the order of the scroll , instead of being =-2n , is =m , so the scrolls 8(1 , 1 , m ) are all included in the case where the order of the scroll , instead of being =2nm , is =rn .
That is , we may suppose that the curve m has a united a( +/ 3)tuple point ( as+3=m ) , and may take the directrix line to pass through this point , and the line of approach to be the common tangent of the 3 bralnches ; and this being so , the order of the scroll will be 2m--c3- , ==q .
It may be added that if the curve m has , besides the a(+-3)tuple point , a y-tuple point , then the scroll will have a y-tuple generating line , and so for the other multiple points of the curve m. 16 .
We may , in the same way as for the scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) , consider the different sections of the scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) of the order m. The general section is a curve of the order nm , having an a(+3)tuple point at the intersection with the directrix line , and a y-tuple point , &amp;c. corresponding to the multiple generating lines , if any .
A section through the directrix line is in general made up of this line counting a times , and of 3 generating lines through the point which corresponds to the plane of the section ; if the section pass also through a y-tuple generating line ( y &gt; / 3 , in the same way as for the scroll S(1 , 1 , m ) ) , then , of the / generating lines , y unite together in the y-tuple generating line .
The general section through a y-tuple generating line breaks up into this line counting y times , and a curve of the order m-y , which has on the directrix line an a--y(+3--y)tuple point and a -tuple point , &amp;c. at its intersections with the other multiple generating lines , if any .

Taking for the equations of the directrix lines ( x=0 , y=O ) and ( z=O , w=0 ) , and supposing that these are respectively an c-tuple line and a 3-tuple line on the scroll c+-=-nm , it is obvious that the equation of the scroll is ( *Ix , y)(Z , W)= 0 .
In fact starting with this equation , if we consider the section by a plane through the line ( x=0 , y=0 ) , say the plane y=xx , then the equation gives Sx(*X19 , X ) ( 5 , W ) O ; that is , the section is made up of the line ( x=0 , y=O ) reckoned M , times , and of d other lines in the plane y=hx ; and the like for the section by any plane through the line ( z=0 , w=0 ) , say the plane z=vw .
Hence the assumed equation represents a scroll of the order i , having the two lines for an a-tuple line and a 3-tuple line respectively , and conversely such scroll has an equation of the assumed form .
Case of a y-t'ple generating line .
18 .
The multiple generating line meets each of the lines ( x=0 , y= 0 ) and ( z = 0 , w 0 ) ; and we may take for the equations of the multiple generating line x+y=0 , z+w=O .
This being so , the foregoing equation of the scroll may be expressed in the form ( tx , y)"( , Xz+W)=o0 , or say ( U , V , W,..)(+ , +qv)=-0 , where U , V , W , ... are functions of the form ( #*x , y ) &gt; .
Hence ( yao ' or / ) , if the functions UI , V , W , ... contain respectively the factors ( x+y)Y , ( X +y)Y- ' , ( x +y)7-2. .
, the equation will be of the form ( *Xx+y , z+w)y=0 ( the coefficients being functions of x , y , z and z+w , or , what is the same thing , x , y , z , w , of the order a+f3-y ) , and the scroll will therefore have the line x+y=0 , z+w=O as a y-tuple generating line .

19 .
We may take x=0 , y-=O for the equations of the twofold directrix line , z-0 for the equation of the plane of the curve m ( an arbitrary plane section of the scroll ) .
Then ( a+1P3=m ) , if the curve m have at the point ( =0 , y=O ) , or foot of the directrix line , an c &amp; ( +P)tuple point , and if moreover we have y=0 for the equation of the common tangent of the p branches ( viz , if the plane y= 0 , instead of being an arbitrary plane through the directrix line , be the plane through this line and the common tangent of the 3 branches ) , the equation of the curve m will be of the form 4(yw)6(*X , y)+P-2P = 0 , where the summation extends to all integer values of 3 ' from 0 to 3 , both inclusive .
20 .
Talking y=_Xx for the equation of any plane through the directrix line , then the corresponding point on the directrix line will be the intersection of this line ( x=0 , y-O0 ) by the plane z= w , where 0= cx +d ' the foot of the directrix line is given by the 6 6d value 0=0 , or X=-b and the equation of the line of approach is therefore y=--b ; this should coincide with the line y= 0 , which is the common tangent of the P branches ; that is , we must have b=O ; I retain , however , for the moment the general value of b. 21 .
The equations of a generating line will be y=X , z=d-w-x ; and then taking X , Y , ( Z=0 ) and W for the coordinates of the point of intersection with the curve m , we have Y= X , 0=W--pX , S(Y W)'( +3X , Y)a -32P=O , and thence X(- ) ( *X1 , 1)oa+P-1= 0 , or , what is the same thing , E -O'(yP ) ( +X1 , x ) + -2= 0O ; which equation , substituting therein for d its value in terms of X , gives the parameter p which enters into the equations of the generating line ; or , what is the same thing , the equation of the scroll is obtained by eliminating.7 , 4 , p from the equation just mentioned and the equations ax+b y=-X , z=6w-px , = c-d 22 .
These last three equations give ___ y..ay+bx _Gw-z_(ay+bx)w-(cy+dx)z .
Gx cy+ dx x and substituting these values , we find for the equation of the scroll I(ay+ bx)'y'[(y + bx)w-(cy+ d'v)z]I'(*Xjx , y)a+P2_'=0_0 which is of the order a+2f3 , =2mn- , so that the a(+P3)tuple point , in the case actually under consideration , produces only a reduction == .
If however the line of approach coincides with the tangent of the P branches , then b=O ; the factor yo divides out , and the equation is ( ayw -cyzdxz'(*x , y)+2-2 ' , =0 , which is of the order a+i3 , =m , so that here the reduction caused by the a(+3)tuple point is =oa+(3 .
We may without loss of generality substitute ax for cy+-dx , and then , putting also a=1 , we find that when the equation of the curve m is as before Z(yw)'I(*j , y)+P-2P1 -o , but the plane through the directrix line ( x=O , y=O ) , and the point on this line , are respectively given by the equations x=Xy , z=-xw , the equation of the scroll is:(yw-xx)/ '(~x , y)+ " 2'=0o .
23 .
The result may be verified by considering the section by any plane y=Xx through the directrix line .
Substituting for y this value , we find xQXP-P'(Xw-z)P'(*X1 , )X+P-P '=0 , which is of the form x ?
( tXx , xwz)=O ; so that the section is made up of the directrix line ( x= 0 , y=0 ) reckoned a times and of p lines in the plane y- .
x= 0 , the intersections of the plane y-x= 0 by planes such as z= w-ffpx .
Case of a y-tuple generating line .
24 .
The equation of the scroll may be written ( U , V , W , ... ) , yw-xz)p=0 , where U , V , W , ... are functions of x , y of the forms ( *3x , y)M ( *x , y)m- , ( * , y)m ... Assuming that these contain respectively the factors ( yx ) ' , ( y-x ) , -1 ( yx)y--2. .
, where y , m , then the equation takes the form ( U ' , v ' , W ' ... Yx , w(y-ZX)+x(xw-z))y=-O , where the coefficients U ' , V ' , W ' , ... are functions of x , y , z , w of the orders m-y , m-y--l , m-y--2 , ... ; or , what is the same thing , the equation is ( U " , V " , W",. .
Iy-x , w --z)Y=0 , where U " , V " , W",. .
are functions of x , y , z , w of the order m--y .
The scroll has thus the y-tuple generating line y--zx=0 , zw--z=0 .

In the case of a cubic scroll there is necessarily a nodal* line ; in fact for the m-thic scroll there is a nodal curve which is of the order n m-2 at least , and of the order -(m--l)(m--2 ) at most , and which for m= 3 is therefore a right line .
And moreover we see at once that every cubic surface having a nodal line is a scroll ; in fact any plane whatever through the nodal line meets the surface in this line counting as 2 lines , and in a curve of the order 1 , that is , a line ; there are consequently on the surface an infinity of lines , or the surface is a scroll .
We have therefore to examine the cubic surfaces which have a nodal line .
26 .
Let the equations of the nodal line be x=0O , y=O ; then the equation of the surface is Uz+Vw+Q=O , where U , V , Q are functions of ( x , y ) of the orders 2 , 2 , 3 respectively .
Suppose first that U , V have no common factor , then we may write Q=(x+fPy)U+(yx+ y)V ; and substituting this value , and changing the values of z and w , the equation of the surface is of the form Uz+Vw=O , or , what is the same thing , ( *Ix yx , ,wz)0 ; so that , besides the nodal directrix line ( x=0 , y= 0 ) , the scroll has the simple directrix line ( z=0 , w= 0 ) : it is clear that the section by any plane whatever is a cubic curve having a node at the foot of the nodal directrix line ( Ix=0 , y= 0 ) , and passing through the foot of the simple directrix line ( z=O , w= O ) ; that is , it is a cubic scroll of the kind S(1 , 1 , 3 ) ; and since for m=3 the only partition m=a +P3 is m=2+1 , there is only one kind of cubic scroll S(1 , 1 , 3 ) , and we may say simpliciter that the scroll in question is the cubic scroll S(1 , 1 , 3 ) .
27 .
If however the functions U , V have a common factor , say ( xx+ pie ) , then zU+V wV will contain this same factor , and the remaining factor will be of the form z(x ?
+iPy)+w(yx+ y ) , =y(3z + Pw ) + yw ) , or , changing the values of z and w , the remaining factor will be of the form yw-xz , and the equation of the scroll thus is ( ?
a+P y)(yw-_Z:)+( nL=2+1 , there is only one kind of cubic scroll ( 1 , 1 , 3 ) , and we may say simpliciter that the scroll in question is the cubic scroll S(1 , 1 , 3 ) .
The conclusion therefore is that for cubic scrolls we have only the two kinds , S(1 , 1 , 3 ) and S(1 , 1 , 3 ) .
The foregoing equations of these scrolls admit however of simplification ; and I will further consider the two kinds respectively .

Starting from the equation ( *(x , y)(z , w ) = 0 , or , writing it at full length , z(a , b , c)Xx , y)2+w(a ' , ' , x , y)2=0 , we may find 0 , , 02 so that ( a , cx , CX , y)2+ , , b ' , c'x , y)=(P+qlY)2 ( a , b , cjx , )2+(a , b ' , c'Xx , y)2= ( p2x+q , y)2 , d0 and 02 being unequal , since by hypothesis ( a , b , c(x , y)2 and ( a ' , b ' , c')x , y)2 have no common factor .
This gives ( a , b , c x , y)2 =C(p1X+q , y)2+-(p2-q2+f)2 , ( a ' , 6 ' , bcX y)2= y( p1 qly)2 + ( p2x+y)2 ; or the equation becomes ( xz+ Vrw)(px + , lie )2++( p+ + , y ) ; or changing the values of ( x , y ) and of ( z , w ) , the equation is xz2 +y2w= 0 , which may be considered as the canonical form of the equation .
It may be noticed that the Hessian of the form is x2y2 .
29 .
We may of course establish the theory of the surface from the equation x2z+y2w =0 ; the equation is satisfied by x=-y , w= --Xz , which are the equations of a line meeting the line ( x=0 , y=O ) ( 1 ) and the line ( z=0 , w=0 ) ( ' ) .
The generating line meets also any plane section of the surface ; in fact , if the equation of the plane of the section be cx+3y+yz+w 0--O , then we have at once x : y W : : w=X3--_ : 2--y : aX+3p : _m3-X2 for the coordinates of the point of intersection .
30 .
The form of the equation shows that there are on the line 1 two points , viz. the points ( x=0 , y=0 , z=0O ) and ( x=O , y=0 , w==O ) , through each of which there passes a pair of coincident generating lines : calling these A and B , then , if the coincident lines through A meet the line 1 ' in C , and the coincident lines through B meet the line 1 ' in D , it is easy to see that x=0 , y=O , z=0 , and w=0 will denote the equations of the planes BAG , BAD , BCD , and ACD respectively .
569 We obtain also the following construction : take a cubic curve having a node , and from any point K on the curve draw to the curve the tangents Kp , Kg ; through the points of contact draw at pleasure the lines pAC and qBD ; through the node draw a line meeting these two lines in the points A , B respectively , this will be the line 1 ; and through the point Ka line meeting the same two lines in the points C and D respectively , this will be the line 1 ' ; and , the equations x =0 , y=O , z = , w-=0 denoting as above , the equation of the surface will be 2z+-y2'w-O .
The points A and B are cuspidal points on the nodal line ; any section of the scroll by a plane through one of these points is a cubic curve having at the point in question a cusp .
32 .
It is to be noticed however that the cuspidal points are not of necessity real ; if for x , y we write x+iy , x-iy , and in like manner z+iw , z-iw for z , w , then the equation takes the form ( x2-y2)z2yw= 0 , which is a cubic scroll S(1 , 1 , 3 ) with the cuspidal points imaginary .
In the last-mentioned case the nodal line is throughout its whole length crunodal ; in the case first considered , where the equation is x.z--y2w= , the nodal line is for that part of its length for which z , w have opposite signs , crunodal ; and for the remainder of its length , or where z , w have the same sign , acnodal .
There are two different forms , according as the line is for the portion intermediate between the cuspidal points cru .
nodal and for the extramediate portions acnodal , or as it is for the intermediate portion acnodal and for the extramediate portions crunodal .
Cubic Scroll S(1 , 1 , 3 ) .
33 .
Starting from the equation ( xx+ y)(ywX)+( X , y)3 = 0o , then putting w--pz for w and Xz for z , this may be written ( x+y){yw z(x+y)}+ ( x+j y , y)3= , or , what is the same thing , x(ywxz)+ ( *Xx y)3= 0 ; and then , if ( *xI , y)3=( 3 , y , r , S , y)3 , this may be written x { y(w+ px+ry)-x(z-_x ) +y3=0 ; or changing the values of w and z , we have x(yw-xz)+y3=O for the equation of the scroll S(1 , 1 , 3)* .
The Hessian of the form is x4 , and it thus appears that the plane x=0O is a determinate plane through the double line .
But y=O is not a determinate plane ; in fact , if for y we write y+ ?
x , the equation is z +xw(y +)+ ( y +)3=0 , that is , -x2(z-_w3x2y-x3x).+xy(w+ 3x , ) +y3 0 , which , changing z and w , is still of the form x(yw--z ) +y3= 0 .
The planes z=0 , w=0 will alter with the plane y=O , but they are not determined even when the plane y==0 is determined ; in fact we may , without altering the equation , change w , z into w+-y , z+-Ox respectively .
35 .
In the equation x(yw-)-tz)fy3= , writing y=Xx , we find for the equations of a generating line , y =x , z=w +x3x .
Considering the section by the plane oaX+-3y-+yz+-w-=0 , we have x : y : z : w=-_yX : -y2-x .
_ : -3+x2+~x : yx3+x+c for the coordinates of the point where the generating line meets the section .
The generating line meets the nodal line at the intersection of the nodal line by the plane z= ?
uw ; that is , the points z=Xw on the nodal line correspond to the planes y=kx through the nodal line .
In particular the point w=0 on the nodal line corresponds to the plane x-0 through the nodal line : the point yrz+w=0 on the nodal line ( that is , the point where this line is met by the plane xS-+3y+yz+-w-=0 ) corresponds to the plane yxr+y=O through the nodal line ; the intersections of the plane ao+x3y+yz+-w=0 by this plane yx+y--=O , and by the plane x=0 , are the tangents of the section at the node .
Quartic Scrolls , Article Nos. 36 to 50 .
36 .
We may consider , first , the quartic scrolls S(1 , 1 , 4 ) .
The section is a quartic curve having an oc-tuple point and a 3-tuple point , where a+,3=4 ; that is , we have a=2 , 03=2 , a quartic with two nodes ( double points ) , or else c=3 , 3=1 , a quartic with a triple point .
But the case c=2 , [ 3=2 gives rise to two species : viz. , in general the quartic has only the two double points , and we have then a scroll with two nodal ( 2-tuple ) directrix lines , and without any nodal generator ; the section may however have a third double point , and the scroll has then a nodal ( double ) generator .
For the case a=3 , 3=41 , the section admits of no further singularity , and we have a quartic scroll with a triple directrix line and a single directrix line .
37 .
Next for the quartic scrolls S(1 , 1 , 4 ) .
The section is here a quartic curve with an a(+-P)tuple point , where a+/ =4 ; that is , a=2 , / 3=2 , or else a-=3 , 3=1 .
In the former case the section has a 2(+2)tuple point , that is , a double point where the two branches have a common tangent-otherwise , two coincident double points : say the curve has a tacnode ; the line of approach is the tangent at the tacnode .
We have here a scroll with a twofold double line ; there are however two cases : viz. , in general 571 , the section has , besides the tacnode , no other double point ; that is , the scroll has no nodal generator : the section may however have a third double point , and the scroll has then a nodal ( double ) generator .
In the case c= 3 , 3=l1 the section has a triple point , and the line of approach is the tangent at one of the branches at the triple point ; the scroll has a twofold , say a 3(+l)tuple directrix line : as the section admits of no further singularity , this is the only case .
The foregoing enumeration gives three species of quartic scrolls S(1 , , 4 ) , and three species of quartic scrolls S(1,1 , 4 ) , together six species , viz. these are as follows : Quartic Scroll , First Species , S(12 , 12 , 4 ) , with two double directrix lines , and without a nodal generator .
38 .
Taking ( x=0 , y=0 ) and ( z=0 , w==0 ) for the equations of the two directrix lines respectively , the equation of the scroll is ( *3X 0y)2(Z )2 0 .
Quartic Scroll , Second Species , S'(12 , 12 , 4 ) , with two double directrix lines , and with a double generator .
39 .
This is in fact a specialized form of the first species , the difference being that there is a nodal ( double ) generator .
Supposing as before that the equations of the directrix lines are ( x= 0 , y=O ) and ( z=O , w=0 ) respectively ; let the equations of the nodal generator be ( x+y=0- , z+w=O ) ; then , observing that for the first species the equation may be written ( *)x , y)2(z , z+w)2=0 , it is clear that if the terms in z2 and z(z+w ) are divisible by ( x+y)2 and ( X+y ) respectively , the surface will have as a new double line the line ( x+.y=0 , z+w=0 ) , which will be a double generator ; and we thus arrive at the equation of the second species of quartic scrolls , viz. this is ( ( Xy)1 ( X+y)(X , 9y ) , ( xy y ) , X Z+w)2= 0 .
Quartic Scroll , Third Species , S(1 , , 1 , 4 ) , with a triple directrix line and a single directrix line .
40 .
Taking ( x=0 , y= O ) for the equations of the triple directrix line , and ( z=0 , w=0 ) for the equations of the single directrix line , the equation is ( *$x , y)(Z , w w)= .
Quartic Scroll , Fourth Species , S(12I12 , 4 ) , with a twofold ( 2(+2)tuple ) directrix line , and without a nodal generator .
41 .
Taking ( s=0 , y= 0 ) for the equations of the directrix line , z= for that of a plane section of the scroll , y=O for the equation of a plane through the tangent at the tacnode of the section , and supposing ( see ainte , No. 22 ) that the plane through the directrix line and the corresponding point on this line are respectively given by the equations x=--y and z=Xw , the equation of the scroll is ( yw-xz)2+(yw_-xz)( , )2+( , y)4=0 .
572 Quartic Scroll , Fifth Species , S'(2 , 12 , 4 ) , with a twofold ( 2(+2)tuple ) generating line , and with a double generator .
42 .
Let the equations of the double generator be x+y=O , z+w=0 ; then the line in question must be a double line on the surface represented by the last-mentioned equation , and this will be the case if only the second and third terms contain the factors ( X+y ) and ( x+y)2 respectively .
The equation for the fifth species consequently is ( yw-x)2 +2(yw-xz)(x+y)(x , y)+(x +y)'(x , y ) =0 .
Quartic Scroll , Sixth Species , S( , , 1 , 4 ) , with a twofold ( 3(+l)tuple ) generating line .
43 .
Taking ( x=0 , y=O ) for the equations of the directrix line , z=0 for the equation of a plane section , and assuming that the plane y=O passes through the tangent which is the line of approach , and that the plane through the directrix line and the corresponding point on this line are respectively given by the equations x='hy and z= ?
.w , the equation of the scroll is ( yw-xz)(x , y)2+(x , y)4=0 .
I refrain on the present occasion from a more particular discussion of the foregoing six species of quartic scrolls .
I establish two other species , as follows : Quartic Scroll , Seventh Species , S(1 , 2 , 2 ) , with nodal directrix in , and nodal directrix conic which meet , and with a simple directrix conic which meets the nodal conic in two points .
44 .
We see , priori , that the scroll generated as above will be .
of the order 4 , that is , a quartic scroll .
In fact using the formula ( ante , No. 5 ) , Order = 2mnp amfn--p , we have here Nodal conic , m=2 , a =0 , Simple conic , n =2 , P3=1 , Line , = , py=2 , , and hence Order =8-2-2 , =4 .
45 .
Take ( x=0 , y=0 ) for the equations of the directrix line , z=O for the equation of the plane of the simple conic , w=0 for that of the plane of the nodal conic ; since the conics intersect in two points , they lie on a quadric surface , say the surface U=0 ; the equations of the simple conic thus are z=0 , U =0 ; those of the nodal conic are w=0 , U=0 .
The directrix line x=0 , y=O0 meets the nodal conic ; that is , U must vanish identically for x=0 , y=0 , w 0 ; and this will be the case if only the term in z2 is wanting ; that is , we must have U=(a , b , 0 , d f , g , h , 1 , m , nXx , y , z , w)2 .
But we may in the first instance omit the condition in question , and write U=(a , b , c , df , g , h , 1n , in , n , z , w)2 ; this would lead to a sextic instead of a quartic scroll .
The equations of a generating line ( since it meets the directrix line x-0 , y==O ) may be taken to be the condition in order to the intersection of the generating line with the nodal conic is at once found to be a &amp; c2+2hc +b+2j(f+gc ) +c032=0 and that for its intersection with the simple conic ac2+2h+b+2(++2m+a ) +d2==0 ; and writing the equations of the generating line in the form Y.w x py-z ' the elimination of a , pf , from these four equations gives the required equation of the scroll .
Writing for a moment 0 =a2+2ha+3 , F =go +f M=zIm +m we find c32 +2FP +o=0 , ( 0ey+2Myw + dw2)f2-2(yz +Mwz)t+ 02=0 ; 0 or , introducing at this place the condition c=0 , the first equation gives 3=---F , and we thence obtain O(Oy2+2Myw+dw2)+4F(Oyz+Mwz)+4F2z=O , or , what is the same thing , ( Oy+2Fz)2+ 2Mw(Oy+2Fz)+ Odw2=0 ; whence , observing that we have ax + 2hxy + by2 F +Xfy I xmy 0= ~- , Fg gx , [ --- , y2 Yy the equation of the scroll is ( aax+2hxy+b y2+2gzx+ 2fyz)2 +2(ax +2hxy +6 +2gzx + 2fyz)(lx+my)w + ( ax , +2^hxy+ &amp; y)dw2= 0 .
And we see from the equation that the surface contains the line ( x=0 , y=0 ) as a double line , the conic w=0 , ax2+2khxy+by.f+2gzx+2fyz=0 as a double curve , also the conic z=0 , ax2+2hsy+by2+212xw+2myw+dw2=O0 as a simple curve on the surface , the complete intersection by the plane z=0 being in fact the last-mentioned conic , and the pair of lines z=o , ax+2hxy+by2=0 .
Quartic Scroll , Eighth Species , S(1 , 32 ) , with a directrix line , and a directrix skew cubic met twice by each generating line .
47 .
We see , priori , that the scroll is of the order 4 , that is , a quartic scroll ; in fact for the scroll S(1 , m2 ) the order is =[mn]2+M ( first memoir , p. 457 ) , and we have here m--3 , M-h--I[m]2=1--3=-2 ; that is , order =6-2 , =4 .
48 .
The equations of the cubic curve may be taken to be X yA z =0 , y , z , W or , what is the same thing , xz-y2-O , xw-yz=0 , yw-z2=0 ; those of the directrix line may be represented by cX + pie +7z +6w =0 , a'x+P'y+1'z+ ; w=O ; or , what is the same thing , if / 3'-3yr=a , aY'o =f , y ' , --y'=b , 3 ' --P3 ' =g , Op'-d/ P=c , 7~'/ =h ( and therefore identically af+bg+ch =0 ) , the line is defined by means of its " six coordinates " ( a , b , c , f , g , h ) .
49 .
The equations of the cubic curve are satisfied by writing therein x:y:z:w=l : .
t : t2 : t , and therefore the coordinates of any two points on the curve may be represented by ( 1 , , 2 , 03 ) and ( 1 , p , 2 , p3 ) ; hence , if , y , z , w are the coordinates of a point in the line joining the last mentioned two points , we have x : y : z : w =l+m l+M-p : 12+m-p2 : -J3 p3 lO which equations , treating therein 1 , m as indeterminate parameters , give the equations of the line in question .
And putting moreover p=yw--25 , q=yz-xw , r=xz-y2 , we have identically p : g : r=-O:--(d+p ) : 1 .
50 .
In order that the line in question may meet the directrix line , we must have l(c +P3+y 0+ 2+ 3)+ +m(o +p p+y2+93)=0 , 1(a'+3'O+ Y'2+ '13)+m(o'+ 3 ?
+ +yr'2+ )= o ; 575 that is , eliminating I and m , we must have +pjSrO+6y ; 2+ +V3y3 p+r 3 I=+ 1 -H+PI'dr'+0+,2+z'03d Ic+P !
p+rIp2+6p3s or , developing , ( f3'-P)(-0)+ ( r')(f-2 )+ ( &amp; r '-_ 7)(-0 ) +(p , tr')(~2 -8)+(~'-t ( p )(8~3 )+( 7ry)(02p3-0)2)=o ; the several terms in ( d , p ) , each divided by p-- , give respectively 1 , p+0 , ( +0)2_-O , ,0( , ( + ) , 0)22 , which are equal to ( r2 , -qr , q2-pr , pr -pq , 2 ) ; hence replacing also ap'-a-d , &amp;c. by their values c , &amp;c. , we find ( c , -b , f , a , g , )(r2 ) -r , p-r , r , -pP , 2)=O , or , what is the same thing , ( h , f , , a-f , -gp , , r ) , =o , where the coefficients ( a , b c , f , g , h ) satisfy the relation af+bg+ch=O ; p , g , r stand respectively for yw--_ 2 yZ_-2 , z--y2 .
Writing for greater convenience ( h , f , , b , a -f , -g)=(a , b , c , 2f , 2g , 2h ) , or , what is the same thing , ( a , 6 , , , g , h)=(b+2g , 2f , c , b , -2h , a ) , then we have af+bg+ch=ac+b2+2bg-4fh=O .
And hence finally we have for the equation of the scroll S(1 , 32 ) , ( a , b , c , f , g , hyw-z , yz--xw , xz-zy2)2=0 , where the coefficients satisfy the relation ac+b2+2bg-4fh=O .
The equations of the directrix cubic are of course yw--z2=Q , yz--xw=O , xz-y==0 ; and the directrix line is given by its six coordinates , ( b+2g , 2f , c , b , -2h , a ) On the general Theory of Scrolls , Article Nos. 51 to 53 .
51 .
I annex in conclusion the following considerations on the general theory of scrolls .
Consider a scroll of the nth order ; the intersection by an arbitrary plane , say the plane w=0 , is a curve of the nth order ( *( , y , z)n=O ; any point ( x , y , z , 0 ) where ( x , y , z ) satisfy the foregoing equation , is the foot of a generating line ; and we may imagine this generating line determined by means of the coordinates ( X , Y , Z , W ) , given functions of ( x , y , z ) of a point on the line .
This being so , the " ' six coordinates , " say ( p , q , r , s , t , u ) , of the line are X , Y , Z , W X , y z , O0 viz. p=Yz--Zy , s=-Wx , q=Zx-Xz , t=-Wy , r=Xy-Yx , u=--Wz ; or , writing for greater convenience -vt in the place of W , the six coordinates of the line are p , qg r , vx , vi , vz , where p , q , r are functions of ( x , y , z ) , connected by the relation px+-qy+vz=O ; and v is also a function of ( x , y , z ) .
52 .
Consider the intersection of the surface by an arbitrary line the six coordinates whereof are ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) ; then for the generating lines which meet this line we have v(Ax+By+Cz)+Fp+Gq+Hr=0 .
And this equation , together with the equation ( *Xx , y , z)= 0 , determines ( x , y , z ) , the coordinates of the foot of a generating line which meets the arbitrary line ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) .
Since the order of the scroll is equal n , the number of such generating lines should be =n , that is , there should be n relevant intersections of the two curves , v(Ax+By+Cz)+Fp+Gq+Hr=O , ( ,3X y , z ) =0 .
But if ( p , g , r , vx , vi , vz ) are each of the order k , the number of actual intersections is =kn , which is too many by ( k--1)n .
53 .
Suppose that the curves p=O , q=0 , r==0 , vx=O , vy=O , vz=0 , or say the curves p=0 , q=0 , r=0 , v=0 have in common 0 intersections , and let these be points of the multiplicities a , , a2 , 3 &amp; . .
MO on the curve ( *Xx , y , z)n=0 ( viz , .
according as the curve does not pass through any one of the intersections in question , or passes once , twice , &amp;c. through such intersection , we have for that intersection ca= , 1 , 2 , &amp;c. , as the case may be , and so for the other intersections ) ; then the kn points of intersection include the ac , + a , ... +Mo , or say the Xa intersections ; but these , being independent of the line ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) under consideration , are irrelevant points , and the number of relevant points of intersection is kn-$-a ; that is , if we have oa=(k--l)n , then the scroll in question , viz. the scroll generated by a line which meets the plane w=O in the curve ( *x , , z)= , , and which has for its six coordinates ( p , v , r , vx , vi , vz ) will be a scroll of the nth order .
