" On the Respiration of the Leaves of Plants .
" By William Haselcline Pepys , Esq. , F.R.S. The author gives an account of a series of experiments on the products of the respiration of plants , and more particularly of the leaves ; sclccting , with this view , specimens of plants which had been previously habituated to respire constantly under an enclosure of glass ; and employing , for that purpose , the apparatus which he had formerly used in experimenting on the combustion of the dia ?
mond , and consisting of two mercurial gasometers , with the addi ?
tion of two hemispheres of glass closely joined together at their bases , so as to form an air-tight globular receptacle for the plant subjected to experiment .
The general conclusions he deduces from his numerous experiments conducted during several years , are , first , that in leaves which are in a state of vigorous health , vegetation is always operating to restore the surrounding atmospheric air to its natural condition , by the absorption of carbonic acid and the disengagement of oxygenous gas : that this action is promoted by the influence of light , but that it continues to be exerted , although more slowly , even in the dark .
Secondly , that carbonic acid is never disengaged during the healthy condition of the leaf .
Thirdly , that the fluid so abundantly cxhaled by plants in their vegetation is pure water , and contains no trace of carbonic acid .
Fourthly , that the first portions of carbonic acid gas contained in an artificial atmosphere , are taken up with more avidity by plants than the remaining portions ; as if their appetite for that pabulum had diminished by satiety .
