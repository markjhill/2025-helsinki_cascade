The reading of a paper , entitled " On low Fogs and stationary Clouds .
" By Wiliiam Kelly , M.D. Communicated by Captain Beaufort , R.N. , F.R.S. , &amp; c , was resumed and concluded .
The object of the present paper is to point out the circumstances which influence the formation of low fogs , and to show what ana ?
logy exists between the causes that produce them and those that occasion certain forms of clouds , which may be considered as differ ?
ing from fogs only in position .
Having been attached for several years to the naval party employed in the survey of the gulf and river of St. Lawrence , the author had ample opportunities of observing the phenomena in question .
He concludes that the fogs described oc ?
cur chiefly when the air is nearly saturated with moisture , and when at the same time the temperature of the water on which they rest either exceeds that of the air , or is considerably below it .
These fogs are generally very dense , often limiting the sphere of vision to a few fathoms ; but seldom extend to any considerable height .
They do not often cover the land to any distance from the shore ; and the tops of the hills , close to the water*s edge , are clear , while the bases , or sides , are enveloped in the mist .
