Consideration of various Points of Analysis .

On th Calkcuus of Generatig Functions .
IN whatever point of view we consider the theory of gene- .
rating functions , whether as the fertile source of new discoveries , or as a medium for exhibiting , in the most comprehensive and uniform point of view , results already known ; we shall find fresh cause to admire the profound and original genius of its author .
To the latter of these objects it is , however , more peculiarly adapted , and perhaps , in the present state of analytics , this may even be considered as the more precious advantage of the two .
Such has been the indefatigable activity of those illustrious men , who have devoted themselves to the pursuit of mathematical science , that analysis must be considered as already adequate to every purpose to which we can reasonably hope to see it applied .
The attention of the scientific observer must now be directed to those elevated stations , from which distinct and extended views of its arrangement as a whole can be obtained .
The calculus of generating functions affords such a station , and commands a wider and more magnificent prospect than any which has yet been opened to the view of the speculative philosopher .
It becomes interesting then to extend its application as far as possible int this line , and to introduce it on every occasion where there seems any probability of its coming successfully into play .
Such have been in part the considerations which determined me to adopt it as a vehicle in laying before the Society some results of a singular and interesting nature , derived indeed originally from other principles , but which , like all the rest , flow with the utmost facility from the first elements of this calculus .
In the following pages I have uniformly made use of the functional or characteristic notation ; together with the method of separating ( where it could conveniently be done ) the symbols of operation from those of quantity .
This method I have , perhaps , extended and carried somewhat farther than has hitherto been customary ; but , I trust , without losing sight of its grand and ultimate object , the union of extreme generality with conciseness of expression .
To avoid the necessity of continual explanation , I shall here set down the leading points of the system .
I. The signs x ( ) are used to separate the symbol of opeA ration from that of the quantity operated upon , thus : f ( { ) , P : log r , 1x1 ( x ) .
II .
1 .
The combination of two operations is represented by placing their symbols together in their proper order .
Thus , p ( 4/ ( x ) ) is simply written '4 " ( x ) .
For example , if , ( x ) i+ x , and 4^ ( x):=x2 , then , ( x ) =1 + x2 , and 4q ( x ) -(I + x ) ' .
s. When several operations combined are considered as one , their characteristics are inclosed in parentheses ( ) .
Thus flog q ( x ) = ( f log ( p ) x. 3 .
The repetition of the sae operationf being denoted ( by the first rule of this article ) by , ff , ,ff , &amp;c. may be more con44x cisely represented thus , f , f3 , ... .f ; and this furnishes us with a general and very simple notation for the reverse operation of that denoted byf .
For sinceJmfn ( x ) _fm+n ( x ) , if we make m= i , n=+ i , we findf-'Jf(x ) =j ?
( x ) =x with the operationf no times performed , = x. ThusJ:- ' is the characteristic of that operation which must be performed onf ( x ) to reduce it to x : that is , of the reverse operation .
This is surely a simpler and more expressive method than that of inverting the characteristic , * accentuating it on the left side , t or below ; t or other similar contrivances .
For instance , log 'x ==+I++ &amp;c. ?
-1 x.* T ' xS tan x T-j - &amp;c. 4 .
If a combination of operations , as I &amp;c. be n times repeated in their order , thus ; pkp ... ?
( x ) , it will , by the second and third rules of this article be denoted by ( ( pJ)n : x. It must be observed , however , that ( )4 ) is not the same as " I , except in some particular cases .
III .
i. If any number of functions of a symbol x be added , subtracted , or otherwise combined , the resulting function is expressed by the same combination of their characteristics , observing the following conditions .
2 .
The actual multiplication of two functions qp ( x ) and 4 ( x ) is expressed by inserting a full point between their characteristics , thus , e. 4 ( x ) =p ( x ) .
4 ( x ) .
$ .
The actual elevation of a function to any power is thus ?

Part I. expressed , { f ( x ) }"n= { f }n : , to distinguish it fromfn ( x ) , whose signification has already been explained .
4 .
If F ( x ) be developable in any series of the form axc + bx " + cx7 + &amp;c. the following abbreviations are used ( F : ) : x =a .
" ( x ) b. c ( x ) + c. *P ( x ) + &amp;c. and , ( F { }):x=a .
{ cp ( x ) } + b. ( x ) } + &amp;c. Thus ( for example ) = , die + ' d:'y I 'd Xyy+d da + &amp; C. dx lXx =x= + Ex + Ez + &amp; C. I-log .
1 IV .
i. D is used as the sign of derivation .
It is , properly speaking , the sign of an operation performed , not on quantity , but on the characteristic which it immediately precedes ; by which the operation denoted by that characteristic is altered .
For instance : D sin. = cos. ; D cos. =sin .
But it must be observed that D log .
= log .
- .
a. The sign D affects only the characteristic next following it , thus , Dqpf ( x ) = ( D():f ( x ) .
If it be intended to affect a combination of operations , the rule II , 2 must be observed .
Thus , D ( f ) : x , Dn ( t log.-'):log .
x. V. Every functional characteristic is affected by all the characteristics preceding it , in the same manner as if it were a symbol of quantity .
VI .
Every characteristic of operation performed on quantity affects all which follows it , as if it were one symbol .
Thus if f ( x ) = ax~ + bxf + &amp;c. ; we shall have 443 fDp ( x ) =a .
{ D ( X ) } " + b. { D ( x ) } 3+ &amp;c. This rule does not extend to the signs D , d , A , ,f , f , according to the remark in IV .
i. These rules will suffice to explain whatever may appear obscure or capricious in the following sheets .
We shall now proceed to their practical application .
If pq ( t ) be a function of t , developable in a series A_ t ? ? ? ?

( t ) is said to be the generating function of Ax , and it may be said to be taken with respect to t. To this we shall appropriate a peculiar symbol Gt , as follows : ( t ) = G{A } When only one symbol t is used , the index below the G may be understood , and our equation will be ( t ) =G { A.

For t let ht be written , and we obtain p ( ht ) =S { Ax ( t ) }=S { A 4X .
tx } G { Azh } Thus , if the generating function of A be ( p ( t ) , that of AxhX will be q ( ht ) .
Let this equation be multiplied by t-r , and we get tr ( ht)=S { A hx .
tx-r } S{A + , hX+r t } -G { Ar .
h+r } If then the generating function of Ax be ( t ) , that of Ax+r h'+r will be t-r ( ht ) .
Again , it is easy to see that a.G A , x +b.G { Bx + &amp;c. G { aAx + bB + &amp;c. } and thus we have ( at^- ' ++ ct+ &amp;c. ) ( ht ) =G aA .
% h++ + bA + h+h + &amp; .

( t)=G aAx + , + bA+ + &amp; c } ; ( i ) .
Let us express the function aA , x+ +bAx+g + &amp; c by the symbol VA , and let at " + btf + cty + &amp; .
=-f ( t ) vAx then will be the same asf ( Ax ) , provided that in the developement off(A ) , A.+i be every where written for Ax } } , and to derive the generating function of vAZ from that of Ax , we have only to multiply the latter byf ( + ) , thus G { VA = ( t)f ( ) ; ... Let now V2A , V3A &amp;c. denote the respective values of the expression aA+ + bA + &amp;c. When instead of A. we write vA , v2A .
, &amp;c. that is , v '1 A =av'Ax+ , + by Ax+ + &amp;c. and it is easy to see that we shall have G{vA}= .

Let us now denote by t( et ) expression l. t+ ' .

( ) .
Thus we may always develope V'Ax in a series containing only the successive orders of 'VAx , such as 'v'A , , &amp;c. If the developement of { fjf- ' ( t)}i contain no negative powers of t , we have { fS I'l oi a- ; 1.2 AA =Ax +I,.A+ , + --A '- &amp; c ; . .
( 8 ) But to proceed .
We have , G{xi A VS SAx tx tdt dd ... ... d*(t ) or which is the same thing , G{ }= d* d{lo dglog ogt } Now , d log : log t1 D( log ' ) : log ) : tx dlog td log td log t { D D( log- ' : log tl fV 'og t ' D2(c log ):logt and so on .
Thus our equation becomes G{'A .

Conceivef ( t ) and F ( t ' ) to be developed into the two series S { ax tr } and Sy iy t ' } , and let us consider the double series S2 a Ax hxy t : t ' } -rS x , y ? ? .
First , -r may be expressed as follows , r S= sa xt.x Sy{ .
( hx t)Y } S , a , t. F(t h ) } But by a similar mode of reasoning , we should also find , = Sy { Ayty./ f(h^ ) } or , =S{ A , t f( thz ) } for since x and y vary through all th ir values , these two sums are identical .
Equating then the values of aS { A t.f(thx ) }=Gt ( a , .

The equation we have just arrived at affords us a method of exhibiting , in a finite form , the sum of the series in its first member , provided we possess the means of obtaining the second ; and it appears , by what we have before remarked , that this can be performed , whenever F ( hD ) ?
F ( h-D ) is a rational integral function of D. Tills includes among the forms of F those remarkable functions denominated by Mr. SPENCE , " Logarithmic Transcendents , " and we shall now proceed , by the help of the general property demonstrated by that authrtl in his"Essay &amp;c. " to derive from these principles the summation of one of the most extensive classes of series which has yet received discussion .
Adopting Mr. SPENCE 's notation , we will represent the series 1 ' 2t 3 " &amp; c by the symbol rL ( i + x ) .

On Functional Eqltations .
The determination of functions from given conditions is a point of such importance , not only in the partial differential calculus , but also in a variety of other branches , that it has occupied the attention of the most eminent Analysts , and it mnlst be confessed , not without considerable success .
Their researches , however , have hitherto extended no farther than to such conditions as involve only the unknown function , p without any of its superior or inferior orders , ( p , 3,. .
&amp; c , " ' , &amp;c. It is to equations of this latter kind , therefore , that we now propose to direct our attention .
The successive orders of any function f ( x ) may be produced , either by actually writingf ( x ) for x in the expression of f ( x ) , in which case the general value of j ' ( x ) must be concluded from induction ; or more elegantly by the following method .
AssumefZ ( x ) U= and we havef'+ ' ( x ) =uo == ZI -fJ ( UZ ) an equation of differences whose integral will be of the form =F ( , C ) C being an arbitrary quantity independent on z. Let z= o , and we have F ( o , C ) U =j ( x ) = an equation which gives C in functions of x. For example ; letJ ( x ) --= i , and we have 20=i ng --i +and integrating , uz =f i- " " +I C-2 }X2{ C+ c- } Now , if we make uo = x , we get C=+x and consequently , f ( x ) = { x( +V - ) + ( X vX~ ) } .
If we suppose q ( x , y ) to denote any function of x and y , and conceive this expression substituted for x , as follows ; ( p ( x , y ) , y } , we shall have the second partialfjnction , taken with respect to x , which we may denote thus , 2 , ' ' ( x , y ) .
If we repeat , or conceive repeated , this operation m times , we shall have the mth partial function with respect to x : m , ' ( X , )=p *m-y ' ( x y ) y } .
If the mth partial function with respect to x be in like manner successively substituted n times for y in the expression q ( x , y ) , we shall obtain a result , mn(x y ) lX --.n l ( x y } and so on for more variables , z , w , &amp;c. - .
An equation containing any number of the successive orders q ?
( x ) = x , p ( x ) , ... .
q ( x ) , of a function q , and from which v is to be determined , is called a functional equation of the nth order , in q. Thus the equation o= x2 ( x ) -( + b ) .
p ( x ) + bx is a functional equation of the second order , and is satisfied by the following p ( x ) =a+ bx. An equation between any number of the partial functions m , n &amp; c ( x , y , z , &amp; c ) for determining the form of p ( x , y , z , &amp; c ) is called an equation of partial functions , and its order may be denoted in the same manner .
Thus o= 2 " ' ( x , y).+.P " ( x , y ) ( a -+ b ) .
( x , y ) +c is an equation of partial functions of the second order with two variables , and is satisfied by the equation q ( x , y ) ==ax + by +c Let ~ ( x ) be a function of x , and a certain number of constants a , b , c , ... And from this expression conceive $ ' ( x ) , q ( x ) &amp; c to be successively formed which will be functions also of a , b , &amp;c. If the number of these constants be n , we may thus produce n+i such functions of them , which will be respectively equal to the several orders of p which they represent .
Thus we have n+i equations involving the n quantities a , b , c , &amp; c which may therefore be eliminated , and the resulting equation between x , ( x ) , ~ ( r ) &amp; c will therefore be independent onthem .
As far then as regards this equation they are arbitrary , so that in reascending from a functional equation which contains n+i different orders of , ( not including po ( x ) or x ) n arbitrary constants must be introduced .
The reasoning here made use of is sufficiently plausible , and in fact , no other than has been adduced in demonstratioh of well known and important truths .
The conclusion too , to the extent of its literal meaning , is correct .
But we have here to notice a paradox of a very singular nature , viz : that even in the simplest cases imaginable ( such as 2 ( x ) = x ) the general expression for t ( x ) may contain , not one or two , but an unlimited numer of arbitrary constants , nay even one or more arbitrary functions .
A nearer attention to every step of the above reasoning will explain this paradox .
But what has been said will serve to make us cautious in trusting implicitly to all its other applications .
Problem I. To determine p ( x ) from the equation qp ( x ) = x. Assume za function of x , and ua functional characteristic , which shall satisfy the following conditions x=u " , ( x)=u^+ .
X UZx ' ( ) = z+ U I ' From these , we obtain p ( x ) , that is , p ( uz ) or()u ) = u ; ... .(a ) and q2 ( x ) or q { t ( x ) } ( , ,+ , x u= ; ... .
( b ) and , subtracting , ( , u)+I(pU ) =-(Uu+ U ) that is , A{ ( u ) + u } = o ; ... ... ... ( c ) and integrating , o= ( ( PU ) ++ C. Now by cross-multiplication of the equations ( a ) and ( b ) we find , U'a.= .
( pu)u ) Thus the function u. ( pu)z does not vary when z changes to z -+ , and of course must be considered as constant in the integration of ( c ) .
C therefore may be any function of u( ( u ) } and thus our equation becomes o=u+ ( pU ) f { u. ( u ) } oro= x+ cp ( s ) +f { Z. ( )}x an equation from which X ( x ) may be obtained for any asp signed form of the functionf .
Thus iff ( x ) =a+ bx , o =a x+ ( 1 + bx ) * .
( x ) and p ( x ) = +-i+bx which satisfies the condition proposed ; and by givingf other forms , we should obtain other values of p ( x ) .
The subsidiary function z , and the characteristic u are not then necessary to be known but as a matter of curiosity .
They may however be found when p is determined , by the resolution of the equation of differences p ( uZ ) =u which gives the form of the function u in z , and z is given by the equation x= u , or z= u-1 ( ) Aliter .
Assume as before , x= ue , q ( x ) = u+ then we have p ( UZ , ) = ; ... ... ... ( d ) .
Now , x u= therefore q ( x ) = , p ( ui ) , that is , u+ = , ( uj and for z writing z i , u= xu which being substituted in ( d ) gives P ( uZ+ , ) = ( P( ) Now this is a perfect function q on both sides , and of course , taking the inverse function p , -1 on both sides u =u %Z+i ZI whence , == C{ COS z{ + ( -+ .

Now u= x , and consequently X =C COS c2z + ( -l ) .

This method applies also to the more general equation ( x ) =-f(x ) , by the substitutionsf ( x ) -= u , ( x ) = uz but , owing to the transcendental equations it introduces , must be regarded as totally ineffectual and useless .

Let the general expression ofj ( x ) in functions of z and x found according to the method above explained be F { z , x : I we have then n " = f , and q =Jf ' , that is ?
P(w )f nf ( XE)= F-F { Ex. 1 .
Letf(x ) = sz2--i , or q2 ( x ) = 2x--l , and we find ( X ) ={ ( X +^ I1)2 )Z } and of course Jn ( X ) -= ( = { ( xJ + J/ v-1 ) @(_ t " ^ / 2 } We may here observe that any one of the n values of ivt will equally afford a satisfactory value of qp ( x ) .

To take an instance of the application of these equations to geometrical problems , let AM be an hyper/ bola whose axis is CP and centre C , and let it be required to find a curve am such that drawing the ordinate PMm , making Cd = _ .

Lety =x ( x ) be the equation of am and y== ( 1 e2 ) ( a2--x2 ) that of AM , then dl =p ( Cd ) qP ( Pm ) = p2 ( x ) and in like manner , fk_ q ( x)= PM , that is , n ( x ) =f ( x ) = v/ ( e2 ) ( a ?

Ifn ( X)---p(X ) { ( e2 ) x*2~ { l ) t } " Thus we see , that am is also an hyperbola , whose centre is C , and calling a ' and e ' its semiaxis and excentricity , we have 1 ez--I e'= e--1 +1 , and a'=a .

If AM be a right angled hyperbola , or e -= V , we shall have e ' =V ' and a ' = -=-- ; that is , am is also a right angled hyperbola , having its axis = part of that of AM .
If e Un to ht fA~I 464 be &lt; , and n odd , we shall have e ' als &lt; 1 .
Thus if the curve AM be an ellipse , am is also a concentric ellipse .

In the case when X=o and 'A,. .
