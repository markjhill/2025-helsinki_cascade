On the Attractions of an extensive Class of Spheroids .
By James Ivory , A.M. Communicated by Henry Brougham , Esq. F.R.S. Read November 14 , 1811 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1812 , p. 46 .
] In his second paper , Mr. Ivory investigates the attractions of that particular class of spheroids mentioned in the former ; for though it is to these that the theorems of Laplace may strictly be applied , it is liable to the important objection , that the terms of his series near the beginning cannot be found without previously computing all the rest .
T'he analysis of Mr. Ivory , on the contrary , is direct ; and every term df his series is deduced directly from the radius of the spheroid .
In an appendix to these papers , Mr. Ivory adds some remarks upon a memoir of Lagrange , upon the same subject , published at Paris in December 1809 , but which had not till lately been received in this country .
