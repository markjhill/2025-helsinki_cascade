and Brochantite with Atacamite , the streak of which is of a characteristic apple-green .
M. Pisani has published analyses of the two above-described minerals .
In the former ( possibly from having driven off part of the water in the preliminary desiccation of the mineral ) he has found less water than I consider it really to contain , and he has consequently given to Langite the formula of Waringtonite .
The green mineral which he has analyzed and described as Brochantite seems , from his analysis , to have contained a slight admixture of the ferruginous matrix , and also differs from mine in the estimate of the water .
I confined my preliminary desiccation to a careful treatment of the bruised mineral with dried and warm blotting-paper , as many hydrated minerals of this class yield up part of their water when long exposed to a perfectly dry air , or to a temperature of 100 ?

( Abstract .
) On a small fragment of Killas from Cornwall , I discovered , several months ago , a new mineral in the form of minute but well-formed crystals .
The specimen had come from Mr. Tailing , of Lostwithiel , a mineraldealer , to whose activity and intelligence I am indebted for the materials that form the subject of this paper .
After a little while he found the locality of the mineral , and sent me other and finer specimens ; but these specimens proved to contain other new minerals besides the one already mentioned .
Two of these minerals are described in this paper , and a third will form the subject of a further communication .
I. Langite .
The first of these minerals which I proceed to describe is one to which I have given the name of Langite , in honour of my friend Dr. Viktor von Lang , now of Gratz , and lately my colleague in the British Museum .
It occurs in minute crystals , or as a crystalline crust on the Killas , of a fine blue with a greenish hue in certain lights .
The crystals are prismatic .
The forms observed are ( 1 0 0 ) , ( 0 0 1 ) , ( 1 1 0 ) , and ( 2 0 1 ) &amp; ( 0 1 0 ) , the normal inclinations giving the following angles , which are the averages of many measurements : O 1I0 fl0=56 16 100 1 10=61 52 001 201=51 46 conducting to the parametral ratios a:b : c= 1:0-5347:0-6346 .
The crystals are twinned after the mariner of cerussite , the twin axis being normal to the plane ( 11 0 ) .

The planes 001 and 100 are very brilliant .
The plane of the optic axes , as seen through a section parallel to the plane 00 1 , is parallel to 10 0 .
The normal to 001 would seem to be the first mean line , and it is negative .
The optical orientation of the mineral is therefore 6 , c , a. The crystals are dichroic .

The specific gravity of Langite is 3'48 to 3'50 .
Its hardness is under 3 .
It will not abrade calcite .
Before the blowpipe on charcoal it gives off water , and fumes and becomes reduced to metallic copper .
Insoluble in water , it is readily dissolved by acids and ammonia .
Heated , it passes through ( 1 ) a bright green , and ( 2 ) various tints of olive-green , till ( 3 ) it becomes black .
Water is given off the whole time , and finally it has a strongly acid reaction .
The first stage corresponds to the loss of one equivalent of water ; the second reduces its composition to that of Brochantite ; at the third it loses all its water .
The chemical composition of Langite is represented by the formula 3Cu " IIH ' 02 + Cu " S04 + 2H'2 0 , which requires the following numbers : Calculated Average percentage .

] 87 To a Cornish mineral associated with Langite , emerald to verdigris-green in colour , occurring in incrustations generally crystalline , and seen occasionally in distinct individual crystals aggregated loosely on the Killas , I have given the name of Waringtonite , in honour of my friend Mr. Warington Smyth .
The crystals are always of the same form , that , namely , of a double-curved wedge .
A narrow plane , 00 1 , is very brilliant and without striation .
It appears to be a cleavage-plane .
A second , but scarcely measurable plane , 10 0 , occurs at right angles to it , truncating the thin ends of the wedge .
The prism planes in the zones 01 0 , 00 1 , and 01 0 , 100 are uniformly curved .
The planes of two prisms seem to exist in the zone 01 0 , 00 1 , but the angles , as approximately measured by the goniometer , are not very reliable ; one of them , however , may be pretty confidently asserted to be very near 28 ? ?
30 ' , which is the mean of many measurements on four crystals .
Seen in a microscope fitted with an excellent eyepiece goniometer , planes of polarization in the crystals are evidently parallel and perpendicular to the planes 10 0 , 00 1 ; but whether a plane of polarization bisects the acute angle of the wedge , i. e. is parallel to 010 or to 10 0 , or whether 100 is equally inclined to the planes forming the wedge-in short , whether the crystal is oblique or prismatic , it is very difficult to determine .
The mineral frequently presents itself , moreover , in what appear to be twinned forms ; but the angles between the planes 100 in the two individuals are not sufficiently concordant , as measured on different crystals , to justify a speculation on the symbols of a twin face .
Several analyses of Waringtonite concur in establishing its formula as 3Cu"H t2 2+ Cu " SO , + H2 0 , as is seen by the following numbers : Percentage as Average calculated .

Its specific gravity is 3-39 to 3'47 .
Its hardness is 3 to 3-5 , being harder than calcite , and about equal in hardness to celestine .
The entire difference of its crystallographic habit , the absence of the striation and marked prismatic forms so characteristic of Brochantite , its habituallypaler colour , lower specific gravity ( in BrochantiteG=3 87 to3'9 ) , and hardness sufficiently distinguish it from that mineral .
