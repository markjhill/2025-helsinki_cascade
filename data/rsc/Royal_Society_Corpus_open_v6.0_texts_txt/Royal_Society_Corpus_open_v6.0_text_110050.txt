On the apparent Magnetism of Metallic Titanium .
By William Hyde Wollaston , M.D. V.P.R.S. Read June 19 , 1823 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1823 , p. 400 .
] Adverting to his statement respecting the action of the magnet upon metallic titanium , published in the first part of the Philosophical Transactions for this year , which refers it to adhering iron , Dr. Wollaston observes , that in subsequent examinations he has found the crystals of that metal slightly attractable , although he had formerly considered them as not thus influenced when apparently perfectly pure .
From some comparative trials , however , he finds that the magnetic power thus exhibited would be conferred by the presence of about 4--th part of iron alloyed with the titanium ; and there is every reason to suspect that the latter metal might be thus contaminated .
This is rendered additionally probable by the action of tests upon the solutions of the supposed pure titanium ; and upon the whole , Dr. Wollaston thinks that we should not be warranted in classing titanium with the magnetic metals .
