Communicated by Professor G. G. Stokes , Sec. R.S. Received May 29 , 1885 .
In a paper last session " On the Electromotive Force during Diffusion in Tidal Streams " ( see " Proceedings Royal Society , " No. 232 ) , the author recorded the electrical part of this investigation .
The present communication contains the concluding gravimetric experiments of the research .
The effects attending the diffusion of the salt and fresh water in tidal estuaries , on parts of the same metal , were estimated in each case for a period of one , during which the metals were constantly exposed to conditions of galvanic action similar to those obtaining in some tidal streams .
The results demonstrate that electric disintegration of the nature alluded to in this and the former paper ( viz. , the galvanic destructive action on parts of even the same metal , arising from difference of potential during diffusion between the surface and lower waters in a tidal stream ) is , on comparison with other investigations by the author , apparently of much greater extent than the loss either from simple corrosion in sea water alone , or than that which ensues from the action on each other of dissimilar metals of this group ( such as wrought iron , cast metals and steels ) in galvanic connexion in sea water .
The wrought iron , steels , and cast metals used were from the author 's standard samples of known composition in the form of 1885 .

There was , however , a shank ( 3 inches long by S- inch square ) left in the centre of each plate for connecting purposes .
The method of experimentation was as follows , see sketch , fig. 1 : various interesting results were obtained by this arrangement of the cells .

Sketch of one set of the Diffusion Cells .
Four plates , A , B , C , and D ( cut from one large plate of each of the metals , so that the four experimental plates of each set were practically of the same composition , molecular structure , \amp ; c. ) , were arranged as shown in fig. 1 , each plate having been previously dried at 212 ' F. , and weighed on the balance .

Action of Tidal Streams on [ June 18 The plate A standing alone and unconnected was immersed in the vessel S containing a measured quantity of sea water .
The plate D also stood unconnected in the vessel F , and the action on this plate was similar to that on plate C , though somewhat modified in extent .
This plate , although standing isolated , afforded another confirmatory indication of the extensive corrosion of metals exposed in water less saline at the surface than near the bottom , notwithstanding that the total salinity of the water in vessel F was greatly below that of the sea water .
The plate B was immersed in the sea water , but galvanically connected with the plate C in the vessel F. In the case of the last two plates B and C , circuit was completed , and slow but continuous diffusion between the two solutions accomplished by means of a triple fold of soft moistened chamois-leather L ( 1 inch wide ) , one end of which was immersed deeply in the sea water , the other to an equal depth in the distilled water , see fig. 1 .
The sea water was obtained regularly from Filey Bay .
The vessel was filled at the commencement with 25 fluid ounces of sea water , the vessel F with the same volume of distilled water .
Both were emptied by siphon ( without disturbing the plates ) and each carefully refilled with their respective waters periodically every fourteen days for a total period of fifty-two weelcs .
Seven pairs of such diffusion cells of equal size were employed in the investigation .
At the termination the plates were taken out , washed , carefully cleaned , dried at 212 ' F. , and again weighed on the balance , and the corrosive effects determined by their relative loss in weight\#151 ; the results are summarised in Table C. The arrangement , fig. 1 , was made so that the plate C , from its position , was exposed near the bottom at ( a ) to the action of water containing rather more salt than the water adjacent to the top at ( 6 ) , whilst constant diffusion was at the same time proceeding , the salt water from vessel S also coming over into the distilled water at an increasing ratio , by means of the soft moist leather connexion ; the water , however , about the position ( 6 ) nearer the surface , maintained a less saline composition than at ( a ) , and the estimation of this difference between top and bottom water during the periodic slow diffusions , is shown in the following analysis , selected as an example from a number of similar observations taken at intervals during the progress of the investigation .
It will be seen that the diffusion cell arrangements allowed equilibrium of composition between bottom and surface to be restored in about fourteen days .
As there was easy communication ( about inch ) around the edges , not only of the plate C , but of the others , the fluid during diffusion in vessel F would probably arrange itself in layers of fairly equal density therein .
These diffusion results also 1885 .

The samples of water for analysis were carefully taken from vessel F by pipette at points indicated on fig. 1 for convenience and accuracy , so as least sensibly to disturb the solution .
The electric action between the plate ( which was the positive metal throughout the whole period ) in the sea water and that in the other water , was in course of the research ascertained by occasionally introducing in the circuit a delicate galvanometer of known resistance and constants , and the resistance of the cells having been regularly determined , the highest E.M.F. , in the case of two representative plates , was found to be about 0*14 volt , which gradually reduced as diffusion proceeded .
The loss by simple corrosion in the sea water alone , as compared with that taking place in the diffusing salt and fresh water , is shown by the relative behaviour of the two plates A and C , of the same 376 Mr. T. Andrews .
Action of Tidal Streams on [ June 18 metal in each case , from which it is manifest that a diffusing mixture of salt and fresh water , although containing a comparatively small proportion of saline matter , is capable of setting up an amount of corrosive mischief far greater than that arising from the action of sea water only , the increased loss varying from about 15 up to 50 per cent4 according to the nature of the metals .
From a reference to column 3 it will also be seen that the combined action of the sea and distilled water ( " although showing only such a slight saline composition and difference of salinity as indicated on Table B of analysis ) whilst diffusing , produced an amount of local galvanic action in the same plate C , sufficient to induce therein much greater corrosion than in the case of plate B , although the latter was constantly immersed in the seawater ( containing 2276'8 grains per gallon of sodium chloride ) and was at the same time metal positive , as indicated by the galvanometer .

[ June 18 metal thus exposed to the simultaneous action of top and bottom waters ) considerably more destructive in its nature and character than the action of sea water alone .
Moreover , the author has found it ( in other experiments extending over long periods ) to considerably exceed ( in some instances varying from about 55 to 120 per cent. ) the loss caused by galvanic action between dissimilar metals of the iron and steel group , in circuit iffi sea water .
The arrangement of the waters in tidal streams and various effects consequent thereon form an intricate study ; the author trusts , however , that the limited observations recorded in the present and the former paper may have afforded some information on the metallurgical aspect of the subject .
Appendix* The gradual rise and consequent inward flow of salt water and the outward flow of fresh water , has a general tendency to arrange the waters of a tidal stream into long , overlapping , wedge-like , layers or formations , the lower containing denser salt water and the upper more fresh water .
This disposition of the waters is modified very considerably by currents , inter-diffusion , and numerous other conditions .
The arrangement and diffusion of the salt and fresh water may not necessarily , at all places in the stream , be of an even character , almost isolated bodies of salt and fresh water not improbably accumulating in the numerous creeks , basins , or other indentations along the shores .
The general contour of a stream , the influence of rainy or dry seasons ( affecting the proportion of fresh water ) , the fact of its estuary being either long , deep , and narrow , affording little fall , or , on the contrary , of a wide shallow character , the states and times of tide , \amp ; c. , and many other circumstances , also-variously modify the diffusion results .
Tcf illustrate further the basis and nature of this investigation , the author gives on Table D some typical analyses , selected from information relating to the disposition of the waters of tidal streams , kindly furnished by Dr. H. Clifton Sorby , F.R.S. ; reference may also be made to the recent very interesting research " On the Salinity of the Firth of Forth , " by Mr. Hugh Robt .
