Atmospheric Electrical Variations at Sunrise and Sunset .
401 percentage of oxygen is reduced ; methane is ignited by the same spark whatever the percentage of gas may be , acetylene and cyanogen have the stepped atomic type of ignition , ethylene is more inflammable in rich mixtures .
Hydrogen and methane in equal volumes are ignited as methane in type , hydrogen in magnitude .
The limits of inflammability of the paraffins are shown to be reached , the upper limit when there is twice the volume of combustible gas to that in the mixture for perfect combustion , the lower limit when the volume of oxygen is twice that for perfect combustion less 1 atom to the molecule .
The ignition of coal gas is through methane .
Four types of electrical ignition are given , covering all from the most rapid to the slowest rate of discharge from the poles .
The work gives direct evidence that ignition begins by ionisation of the oxygen of the mixture .

) The scheme of investigation described in the following paper was suggested by the scheme of sunrise and sunset observations formulated in 1913 by the British Association Committee for Radiotelegraphic Investigation .
As the phenomena of wireless transmission are supposed to be primarily associated with the upper atmosphere , any intimate connection between the phenomena here detailed and those exhibited by wireless is unlikely , but it is possible that the two sets of results may throw some light on one another .
As the periods near sunrise and sunset are attended by more conspicuous variations in the intensity of atmospherics or " strays , " special observations were taken at these times .
The instruments used were the Wilson compensating gold-leaf electroscope* and two Ebert electrometers.f The former gave the conductivity , and the air-earth current was obtained by combining this with the potential observations obtained from the Kelvin water-dropper .
The conductivity measured is usually considered to be due to the positive * ' Proc. Camb .

Investigation of Atmospheric vertical current flowing to earth , and thus only about one half the total conductivity ; * but there is some difference of opinion on the subject .
The two Ebert instruments were used to record the simultaneous values of the positive and negative charges per c.c. of air .
About 100 observations at sunset have been obtained , each consisting of three 5-minute periods before , and three 5-minute periods after , sunset .
Monthly mean values have been worked out , and these are compared with the values obtained at 3 p.m. on corresponding days , which will indicate the general effect of diurnal variation on the electrical quantities ( Table I ) .
The experiments were made at Kew Observatory , except during August and September , 1914 , when they were performed at Eskdalemuir .
The winter results , being few in number , are grouped together , and include one observation in October , three in November , three in December , and one in February .
The figures in the column " Before sunset " refer to the mean value for the 15 minutes preceding sunset ; and similarly " After sunset " denotes the mean for the 15 minutes following sunset .
The natural inference from the Table is that at Kew the ionic charges are practically the same during 15 minutes before sunset and at 3 p.m. It would have been more satisfactory to have corrected these sunset observations for diurnal variation by a similar process to that adopted later for the potential gradient data , but the corrections would have been small , and could not be found with sufficient precision from the limited number of hourly observations of diurnal variation that have been obtained at Kew .
There is , generally speaking , a marked decrease in all the electrical quantities after sunset .
If we investigate the summer and winter results , the average sunset effect shows little difference for the two seasons , there being a mean decrease of about 20 per cent , after sunset ( see Table II ) .
These results show that the solar effect at sunset is at least as strong in the winter months as in the summer .
The value of the conductivity was also calculated for each 5-minute observation from the Wilson instrument , and similar values were also obtained for the electric charges , which for convenience were expressed in arbitrary units .
The mean values of these quantities obtained at Kew and Eskdalemuir ( fig. 1 ) show that there is no sudden change at any definite period in the 15 minutes preceding or following sunset , but there is a gradual decrease in all the elements .
The curves for Eskdalemuir are not so smooth as for Kew , owing to the fewer number of observations .
As regards the monthly results , fche conductivity variation was most regular for July , 1914 , and winter , 1914-15 , while June at Kew and September at Eskdalemuir are remarkable * Lutz , ' Luftelektrischer Messungen in Munchen/ p. 342 .

405 in that the decrease in the negative charge is so pronounced , especially before sunset .
A number of sunrise observations have been taken ( Table III ) , including six at Kew and seven at Eskdalemuir , in a similar manner .
After sunrise there appears to be a slight increase ( 5 per cent. ) in the conductivity , a decrease in the positive charge of 9 per cent. , and the negative charge of 23 per cent. , of the value before sunrise .
This indicates that the solar effect is not so pronounced at sunrise as at sunset .
Sunrise observations are subject to more uncertainty owing to the high relative humidity , which causes trouble with the insulation .
It was found that the most definite change took place in the negative charge for August , 1914 , at Eskdalemuir , showing a general decrease for the sunrise period .
Otherwise there appears to be a tendency for the electrical quantities to decrease till sunrise , and then increase .

The data for 1913 were not used , as the results were not considered reliable owing to disturbances introduced by structural alterations in the main building .
The curves were measured at the exact time of sunrise and sunset , and at 15 , 10 , and 5 minutes before and after each event .
This was done for every day of the month except when there were obvious disturbances due to rain , or defects in the record .
In a few cases , when fog is recorded with abnormal variations of potential , readings have been omitted .
The means for the month , first obtained in millimetres from the curves , are converted into volts per metre in the open by the appropriate factor , and from these the annual mean for the years 1912 and 1914 is deduced .

406 Mr. E. H. Nichols .
Investigation of Atmospheric was to plot the values of potential gradient for the three hours nearest the sunrise or sunset time , and to draw a smooth curve through the three points \#151 ; e.g. , if sunrise was at 6 h. 10 m. , the hours plotted would be 5 h. , 6 h. , 7 h. The correction at the hour of sunrise or sunset is supposed to be zero , as relative values are all that is required .
The ordinates of the curve are measured for the three 5-minute intervals before and after sunrise or sunset , noticing that the correction is reversed in sign .
The corrections are larger in the winter months , the explanation being that the range is much greater at this time .
For June no correction is necessary .
The mean correction for the year is a few volts : but as it is of the same order as the actual sunrise and sunset change , it is important to see if the correction obtained from using other years , 1912 and 1914 , produces any appreciable difference .
Although the monthly means for these years are much less regular than for the series of years , they give similar corrections , the summer correction being smaller than the winter , while the annual mean correction is practically identical in all three cases .
The monthly mean values indicate generally an increase in potential both for sunrise and sunset , this being more noticeable in the winter months .
Considering the results of the two years for sunrise , an increase in potential after sunrise is found for 15 months , when the means of values before and after sunrise are compared .
For seven months there is a decrease , and lor two months ( July , 1912 , and July , 1914 ) there is no change in potential .
For the sunset observations there are 20 months giving an increase of potential , and four months a decrease .
Thus the increase in potential is more marked for sunset than for sunrise , and agrees with other observations which show a more definite decrease of conductivity and electric charge at sunset than at sunrise .
It is generally observed that in wireless investigation of " strays , " while there is usually a tendency to increase during sunset , anomalous results are more frequently obtained near sunrise .
One would expect a priori that any change would be more marked in summer .
Although this is the case for the electric charges and conductivity , it is not true for the potential .
This is clearly shown in the seasonal means ( Table IV ) .
For the winter there is a well marked increase in the potential .
For the equinoxes it is less marked , especially in 1914 , while for the summer it is either negligible or there is a decrease of potential , as appears in the corrected value for sunrise .
The mean annual variation for sunrise and sunset ( fig. 2 ) shows a small but definite increase in potential , even when corrected for the diurnal variation .
There iSjio indication of any sudden change near sunrise or sunset , but the potential appears to be very steady just at sunrise and a few minutes before sunset , while it increases most rapidly just after sunset .

On the Motion of Solids in a Liquid Possessing Vorticity .
By J. Proudman .
( Communicated by Prof. H. Lamb , F.R.S. Received March 28 , 1916 .
) 1 .
The following investigations were undertaken at the suggestion of Mr. G- .
I. Taylor as an extension of some of his own.* The equations of motion of any system of solids in a liquid which moves without vorticity were obtained by Lord Kelvin by a method based on that of ignorable co-ordinates in ordinary dynamics .
They are of Lagrange 's type , and were afterwards obtained by various writers !
by an adaptation to hydrodynamics of Lagrange 's original method .
Lamb 's work leads to some hydrokinematical relations which we shall put in evidence below .
For the rotational problems discussed in the present paper , an attempt to obtain a Lagrangian function has only been successful in one case .
This case is that to which Taylor 's principal results refer , viz. , the two-dimensional motion , with uniform vorticity , which at infinity reduces to a rotation about an axis .
That a Lagrangian function exists in this case is obvious from Taylor 's results . .
* An account of these investigations has not yet been published .
The subsequent references are to a MS .
which Mr. Taylor very kindly showed the author .
