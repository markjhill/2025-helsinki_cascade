] Changes in the Blood consequent upon Inflammations .
487 Conclusion:\#151 ; 1 .
Sugar when taken alone is a muscle food .
500 grams ( 17^ ounces ) of sugar increased in my case the amount of muscular work done on a fasting day from 61 to 76 per cent. 2 .
The muscle energy-producing effect of sugar is so great that 200 grams ( 7 ounces ) added to a small meal increased the total amount of work done from 6 to 30 per cent. 3 .
That when sugar was added to a large meal it increased the total amount of work done from 8 to 16 per cent. 4 .
That the work done during a period of eight hours can be increased from 22 to 36 per cent , by taking 250 grams ( 8f ounces ) of sugar .
5 .
That when sugar is taken at 3.50 p.m. it not only obliterates the normal diurnal fall in the muscular power , which usually occurs at 5.30 p.m. , but even causes an actual increase in the total amount of work done .

" Note on some Changes in the Blood of the general Circulation consequent upon certain Inflammations of an acute local character .
" By C. S. Sherrington , M.D. , F.R.S. Received December 11 , 1893 .
( Abstract .
) This note describes , and attempts to interpret , in a preliminary manner certain anatomical alterations in the blood noted in experiments on the acute local inflammation of various tissues .
The contents of the communication are as follows :\#151 ; I. ( 1 ) Description of the method employed for the induction of the local inflammation .
( 2 ) Description of the methods followed in examining the composition of the blood .
II .
Summary of the alterations observed .
The chief of these alterations are ( 1 ) inspissation of the blood ; ( 2 ) reduction of the number of haemic leucocytes followed by increase of the number of them , followed in some cases by a final decrease of their number to below the original normal ; ( 3 ) disturbance of the mutual ratios normal between the different kinds of heemic leucocytes .
The summary is illustrated by quotation of protocols from certain of the experiments\#151 ; a. When the site of inflammation is in the limb .
8 .
When the site of inflammation is primarily peritoneal .
\#171 ; / .
When the site of inflammation is primarily in a mucous surface .

Interpretations offered for the heemic changes found\#151 ; ( 1 ) For the inspissation observed in the blood .
( 2 ) For the fall , and subsequent rise , of the number of leucocytes in the blood .
( 3 ) For the disturbance of the ratios normal between the numbers of the different kinds of leucocytes in the blood .
This last subsection is preceded by a brief account of the cell characters upon which reliance has been placed in the sorting of the hsemic leucocytes into the following groups:\#151 ; a. Finely granular leucocytes .
/ 3 .
Coarsely granular leucocytes .
7 .
Hyaline leucocytes .
