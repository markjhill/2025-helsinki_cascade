, F.R.S. Received April 17 , 1890 .
Eight different alloys have been examined , distinguished here by the letters of the alphabet .
All the samples were given to me by Mr. Riley , of the Steel Company of Scotland , who also furnished me with the analysis given with the account of the experiments with each sample .
The methods of experiment were the same as were detailed in my paper on " Magnetic and other Physical Properties of Iron at a High Temperature .
" The dimensions of the samples were also the same .
For this reason it is unnecessary to recapitulate the methods adopted .
I confine myself to a statement of the several results , dealing with each sample in succession .

In this case a magnetisation curve is all that I have obtained free from doubt ; the sample was heated and its magnetisation determined at various temperatures for a force of 0'50 , hut the higher temperatures must be taken as a shade doubtful , as the secondary broke down before cooling , and I cannot be sure whether or not the resistance of the secondary may have changed .
Table I gives the results at the ordinary temperature for the material before heating ; these are plotted in Curve 1 together with the curve for wrought iron , for comparison .

3 The only noteworthy features are that the coercive force is obviously somewhat considerable , and that the maximum induction is great\#151 ; greater than that of the more nearly pure iron .
In Curve 2 are shown the results of induction in terms of the temperature for a force of 0'50 .

The experiment with rising temperature was made by simply observing with a watch the hour at which the temperature attained successive values whilst the piece was in the furnace ; the cooling experiments were made in exactly the way described in 1 hil .

; 1 1 the logarithms of the excess of temperature above the room , as in Curve 5 .
The most remarkable feature in Curve 3 is that the material has two critical temperatures , one at which it ceases to be magne-tisable with increase of temperature , the other , and lower , at which it again becomes magnetisable as the temperatures fall , and that these temperatures differ by about 150 ' C. Between these temperatures , then , the material can exist in either of two states\#151 ; a magnetisable and a non-magnetisable .
Note , further , that the curve for decreasing temperature returns into that for increasing temperature , and does not attain to the high value reached when the temperature is increasing .
From Curve 4 we see that there is absorption of heat about 750 ' C. , and not before ; and from Curve 5 that heat is given off at 632 ' C. , and again at a lower temperature .
Comparing these temperatures with Curve 3 , it is apparent that the 1890 .

5 absorption and liberation of heat occur at the same temperature as the loss and return of the capacity for magnetism .
From Curve 5 also we may infer that the latent heat liberated in cooling is about 150 times the heat liberated when the temperature of the material falls 1 ' C. Concerning the latent heat absorbed in heating , nothing can be inferred from Curve 4 , excepting the temperature at which it is absorbed .

The material appears to be capable of considerably higher magnetisation than wrought iron .
In Curve 7 is shown the relation of induction and temperature for two forces , 26-5 and 0'5 , the results being obtained on two different days , to the same scale of abscissae but different scales of ordinates .
These curves show the same ieatures as the alloy B , but at a rather lower temperature .
D. This sample contains 22 per cent , of nickel .
It was not thoroughly tested , as the supply of C02 which happened to be available was insufficient .
Its magnetic properties , however , were similar to the next sample .

The ring on being heated remained non-magnetisable up to 700 ' C. or 800 ' C. A block of the material did not recalesce on being heated to a high temperature and being allowed to cool .
On being placed in a freezing mixture , the material became magnetic at a temperature a little below freezing point .
The material was next cooled to a temperature of about \#151 ; 51 ' C. by means of solid carbonic acid .
After the temperature had returned to 13 ' C. the curve of magnetisation was ascertained as shown in Curve 8 ; from this it will be seen that the ring of the material which was previously non-magnetisable at 13 ' C. is now decidedly mag-netisable at the same temperature .
On heating the material , it remained magnetisable until it reached a temperature of 580 ' C. At this temperature it became non-magnetisable , and , on cooling , remained non-magnetisable at the ordinary temperature of the room .
Curve 9 shows the induction at various temperatures for a magnetis* The results with this sample have already been presented to the Royal Society ( ' Proceedings , ' vol. 47 , pp. 23 and 188 ) , but are repeated now for completeness .

These curves show that , through a range of temperature from somewhat below freezing to 580 ' C. , this material exists in two states , either being quite stable , the one being non-magnetisable , the other magnetisable .
It changes from non-magnetisable to magnetisable if the temperature be reduced a little below freezing ; the magnetisable state of the material does not change from magnetisable to non-magnetisable until the temperature is raised to 580 ' C. The same kind of thing can be seen in a much less degree with ordinary steel .
Over a small range this can exist in two states ; but in changing its state from non-magnetisable to magnetisable a considerable amount of heat is liberated , which causes rise of temperature in the steel .
It is observed in samples B and C of nickel steel , as we have just seen , but at a higher temperature .
As might be expected , the other physical properties of this material change with its magnetic properties .
Mr. Riley has kindly supplied me with wire .
The wire as sent to me was magnetisable as tested by means of a magnet in the ordinary way .
On heating it to a dull redness it became non-magnetisable , whether it was cooled slowly or exceedingly rapidly , by plunging it into cold water .
A quantity of the wire was brought into the non-magnetisable state by heating it and allowing it to cool .
The electric resistance of a portion of this wire , about 5 metres in length , was ascertained in terms of the temperature ; it was first of all tried at the ordinary temperature , and then at temperatures up to 340 ' C. The specific resistances at these temperatures are indicated in Curve 11 by the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 .
The wire was then cooled by means of solid carbonic acid .
The supj\gt ; osed course of change of resistance is indicated by the dotted line on the curve ; the actual Curve 11 .
10 Dr. J. Hopkinson .
[ May 1 , observations of resistance , however , are indicated by the crosses in the neighbourhood of the letter A on the curve .
The wire was then allowed to return to the temperature of the room , and was subsequently heated , the actual observations being shown by crosses on the lower branches of the curve , the heating was continued to a temperature of 680 ' C. , and the metal was then allowed to cool , the actual observations being still shown by crosses .
From this curve it will be seen that in the two states of the metal ( magnetisable and non-magnetisable ) the resistances at ordinary temperatures are quite different .
The specific resistance in the magnetisable condition is about 0000052 ; in the non-magnetisable condition it is about 0'000072 .
The curve of resistance in terms of the temperature of the material in the magnetisable condition has a close resemblance to that of soft iron , excepting that the coefficient of variation is much smaller , as , indeed , one would expect in the case of an alloy ; at 20 ' C. the coefficient is about 0'00132 ; just below 600 ' 0 .
it is about 0 0040 , and above 600 ' C. it has fallen to a value less than that which it had at 20 ' C. The change in electrical resistance effected by cooling is almost as remarkable as the chauge in the magnetic properties .
Samples of the wire were next tested in Professor Kennedy 's laboratory for mechanical strength .
Five samples of the wire were taken which had been heated and were in the non-magnetisable state , and five which had been cooled and were in the magnetisable state .
There was a marked difference in the hardness of these two samples ; the non-magnetisable was extremely soft , and the magnetisable tolerably hard .
Of the five non-magnetisable samples the highest breaking stress was 50'52 tons per square inch , the lowest 48 ' 75 ; the greatest extension was 33 per cent. , the lowest 30 per cent. Of the magnetisable samples , the highest breaking stress was 88 12 tons per square inch , the lowest 85'76 ; the highest extension was 8'33 , the lowest 6-70 .
The broken fragments , both of the wire which had originally been magnetisable and that which had been non-magnetisable , were now found to be magnetisable .
If this material could be produced at a lower cost , these facts would have a very important bearing .
As a mild steel , the non-magnetisable material is very fine , having so high a breaking stress for so great an elongation at rupture .
Suppose it were used for any purpose for which a mild steel is suitable on account of this considerable elongation at rupture , if exposed to a sharp frost its properties would be completely changed \#151 ; it would become essentially a hard steel , and it would remain a hard steel until it had actually been heated to a temperature of 60(P C. F. This sample contains 30 per cent , of nickel .
Curve 12 shows the relation of induction to magnetising force at the ordinary temperature , and Curve 13 the relation of induction and temperature for 1890 .

The remarkable feature here is the low temperature at " which the change between magnetisable and non-magnetisable occurs , whether the temperature is rising or falling .
Comparing it-with the last sample , we see that the character of the material with regard to magnetism is entirely changed .

It is curious to remark that the induction for considerable forces is greater than in the steel with .33 per cent , of nickel , and that it is greater than for a mechanical mixture of iron and nickel in the proportions of the analysis , however the particles might he arranged in relation to each other .
The critical temperature of the material is 600 ' C. ; it shows no material difference between the critical temperatures for increasing and diminishing temperatures .
