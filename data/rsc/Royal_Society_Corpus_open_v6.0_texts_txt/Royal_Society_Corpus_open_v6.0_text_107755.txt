W HENEVER any difference of opinion exists on philosophical subjects depending on experiment or observation , it is much more useful simply to state facts , than to reason on them prematurely .
Having this principle in view , I am induced to transmit to the Society the annexed small Table , which contains the annual variations of ' some of the fixed stars , as deduced both from Dr. BRINKLEY'S observations and my own , and by which each may be compared with the annual variations determined by very distant observations , according to the more usual method .
Of sixteen stars south of the zenith , observed at Dublin , it will be seen , by the table , that thirteen of them either indicate , or at least are not inconsistent with that irregularity which I have noticed under the name of southern deviation ; of these thirteen , about half indicate rather a greater deviation than I have assigned to them , the other half deviate less .
The three remaining stars , Castor , ac Aquile , a Cygni , deviate in a contrary direction .
The difference in a Cygni is considerable , and not easily to be accounted for , as this star is one of those most frequently observed at each observatory , and is so near the zenith as not to be easily affected by the uncertainty of astronomical refraction .
I fear the examination of these tables will rather increase than diminish that tendency to scepticism which does and indeed ought to exist , relative to the determination of such very small quantities by astronomical observation ; but I deem it peculiarly incumbent on any one , placed in the situation which I hold , not to be influenced by these considerations : on the contrary , the difficulty and perplexity of the subject should only act as an incentive to contrive more powerful methods of investigation .
Nothing has ever been farther from my intention , than to place this subject in a controversial point of view .
It would be worse than useless so to do , since the difficulty will in the space of a very few years in all probability be satisfactorily explained .
