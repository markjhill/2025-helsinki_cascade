" On the Graduation of the Thermometers supplied from the Kew Observatory for the use of the Arctic Searching Expedition under Sir Edward Belcher .
" These instruments were twelve in number , seven mercurial and five spirit thermometers , graduated for low temperatures , The pro cesses adopted for the.two kinds of instruments being different , I shall describe them separately .
I. Mercurial Thermometers.-These were divided into degrees of Fa-hrenheit 's scale in the following manner:-The tubewas first calibrated in the way already described in my former report on the construction of thermometers ( dated March 22 ) ; marks being made on the tube at each extremity of the calibrated space . ?
The bulb was then made and the mercury introduced by the glass-blower , the dimensions of the bulb and the quantity of fluid beingmade as nearly as possible to correspond with the scale proposed to be made .
The thermometer was then placed in melting ice and the freezing-point approximately set off with an ink mark ; a similar mark being also made for a temperature of between 95 ?
and 100 ? .
A short arbitrary scale of four or five divisions was then divided at each of those points .
The thermometer was then again placed in ice and the freezing .
point determined accurately with reference to the lower short scale : ; and comparisons with two standard thermometers in water determined the value of the upper short scale .
Let OP be the calibrated poition of the tube , 0 being the point of commencement , F the 0FHPIII1 _. .
-* , ... L[ ... ... freezing-point as determined by means of the short arbitrary scale , and H the higher point of the scale similarly obtained .
Let the distances OF , FH , HP be measured by the screw of the dividing engine .
Let R1 , R , R , &amp;c. , Rf , &amp;c. , Rh , &amp;c. be the lengths in revolutions of the dividing screw , of the calibrating column of mercury for each successive step in its progress along the tube during the process of calibration ; Rf being the length of the step in which the point F occurs , and Rh that in which H occurs .
The values of R1 , R a , &amp;c. have been registered in the process of calibratioi ; OF and OH have been obtained independently ; the second measurement of OP , when compared with the sum of all the R 's , will show with what exactness* the column of mercury has been passed through its own length in its progress along the tube .
Let rf be the number of revolutions between the first end of the step f and the point F , and similarly r , for the step h. We have then OF =R+R2+R3+ &amp;c. + Rf+ r and OH=R1+R2+ ... .
-+R^_+r , ; whence we obtain r and r^ .
Let K be the number of degrees equivalent to one length of the calibrating column , -this being of course constant for each length along the tube on the supposition of equal increments of volume for equal increments of temperature .
Also , if we suppose that the capacity of the tube does not:vary throughout the length of a single calibrating step , Rf and r will ft , R give the fractional parts of a step by which the points F and H are respectively in advance of the first ends of the stepsf and h. We l}ave then OF=(f=1+ f)K , OH ( -1+ r^)K ; and FH = ( hI-ft rf K=r=K , , the higher temperature-320 ; whence K - .
The degree corresponding to the point y9 a-f+rk f ; R , Rf O is 32 ?
0 f-1++ )K .
The length of one degree for any individual step x is Z. From the quantities thus obtained , a table may readily be formed showing the value in revolutions of the dividing screw of one degree at all parts of the scale , and the graduation may then be proceeded with accordingly .
The graduation is carried from -40 ?
to + 120 ?
or 130 ?

Spirit Thermometers .
In the graduation of mercurial thermometers , the practice is to consider the increments of volume to be proportional to increments of temperature .
If this were assumed in the case of spirit thermometers , very serious errors would be the result , even within moderate ranges of temperature .
Dr. Miller having considered alcohol , as on the whole , the best fluid for thermometers intended to measure very low temperatures , I was supplied by him with some which he had himself prepared with great care , its specific gravity being 0-796 at 60 ?
Fahr. The first step to be taken was the determination of the law of expansion of the fluid in glass , as compared with that of mercury .
For this purpose a tube was calibrated and divided with an arbitrary scale according to Regnault 's process : its divisions were found , upon verification , to be of exactly equal capacity throughout .
The tube was then furnished with a bulb of the same dimensions as those intended to be supplied to the Admiralty , and filled with the alcohol .
This thermometer was marked S. 9 E. Comparisons were then made between the readings of this instrument and those of a standard mercurial thermometer , through as large a range of temperature as was found practicable .
The comparisons above the freezing-point were taken in water , in the apparatus described in my former report ; those below 32 ?
were taken in freezing mixtures of ice and salt or chloride of calcium .
The following Table contains the results of two series of experiments ; the numbers ins the first two columns are differences from the freezing-point ; those in the first being Fahrenheit 's degrees ; and in the second and third columns , the arbitrary scale divisions of the .

) where T is the number of Fahrenheit 's degrees from 32 ?
, N the corresponding number of divisions by thermometer S. 9 E. , A and B being the constants whose value is to be ascertained : the constants depending on higher powers of T than the second , were not considered .
The values of A and B were obtained from the equations by the method of least squares , and were as follows : From first series ... ... .

A= 38377 ... ... B =0'002221 The mean of both series giving. .
A=2829 ... ... B=-0002338 The numbers in the columns " Observed minus calculated , " are obtained by taking the difference between the observed readings of the spirit thermometer , and the numbers calculated from the mean , values of A and B just stated .
Having determined upon the adoption of the law of expansion stated above , the graduation of the spirit thermometer was proceeded withi as follows.:The process of calibrating the tubes was the same as for the mercurial thermomteters ; as in these , also , the freezing-point and a ternperature of 90 ?
or 95 ?
were.determined with reference to short scales on the stems : ; the distances OF , OH ( figure , page 184 ) were also measured ; and by comparing these measurements with the numbers obtained by calibration , they were expressed in terms of lengths of the calibrating column .
The equation ( l. ) may be put under the form N-A(T+ 0Tj ) by making 0=- .
Letf and h be the distances OF , OH expressed in A steps of the calibrating column ; FH= h-f .
Let T ' be the number of degrees above 32 ?
corresponding to H , and let ao be the value , in terms of a calibrating step , of one degree at the ternperature 32 ?
: we have then , according to the fundamental equation ( i. ) , h-f=ao ( TA+0Th2 ) or o=--+ 0h .
We may in general , without sensible error , assume that the value of one degree is uniform throughout the length of a single calibrating step , or if the column of mercury has been rather too long , we may subdivide the steps by interpolation .
From the value of ao , now obtained , we can find with sufficient exactness the temperature corresponding to the middle of the stepf .
It will now be convenient to make use of a table , derived from the values of A and B , showing the relative lengths of one degree at different temperatures on the supposition of uniform capacity of the tubes .
The following are the values for every ten degrees , from -70 ?
to + 100 ?

Then calling the numbers in the table X , since __.=^ , we find Kf=1 X : Ko .
ff Xao fa Xf This gives us the temperature corresponding to each end of the step f , and we may then proceed in like manner to find the values of the neighbouring steps , and so obtain successively the values throughout the whole range of the thermometer .
The temperature corresponding to the point 0 in the figure is found by subtracting the sum of all the values of K between 0 and F from 32 ? .
The length , in turns of the dividing screw , for any degree x is - , where R is the length of the step in which x occurs , and K , ?
the equivalent number of degrees .
A table can then be constructed , showing the lengths of each successive degree , commencing from the point 0 , by the aid of which the graduation may be performed .
The scales extend to 75 ?
Fahr. The time at my disposal was scarcely sufficient to test the thermometers supplied to the Arctic Expedition so completely as I should have wished .
The mercurial thermometers were after their graduation compared incidentally at two or three different temperatures , and found to agree generally to 0 ? ?
1 Fahr. They were all placed in melting ice , when it was found that four of them read exactly 32 ?
, the other three , viz. No 's .
34,46 , 47 , were about 0 ?
'1 too low .
In a few of these thermoneters the column of mercury could be readily broken : when this column was moved to different portions of the scale , it was found to occupy precisely the same number of divisions .
This was the case with four of the instruments ; the other three not having been tested in this way .
The five spirit thermometers were compared at four different temperatures with a standard mercurial thermometer. .
The comparison at 00 being taken in ice and salt , is not very trustworthy .
Their errors were as follows : Temp. by Mean of mer. stand .

In the case of Nos. 2 and 7 , the index error is very large : this , it is believed , is owing to some of the vapour of alcohol having become condensed in the upper portion of the.tube before the fixed points were determined , and having escaped my notice ; in fact the greatest attention is required to avoid errors from this source .
These spirit thermometers cannot by any means be considered as standard , although they are doubtless more trustworthy than most of those ' usually made .
The limited time at my command for the completion of the instruments , prevented the possibility of rectifying any blunders into which I might have fallen , owing to my inexperience in such work , and the intricacy of the problem .
