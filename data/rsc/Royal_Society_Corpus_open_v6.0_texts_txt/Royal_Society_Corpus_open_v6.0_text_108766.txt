BEFORE commencing a research on the law of the conducting ptwer for electricity of alloys , it was considered necessary to determine their specific gravities ; to ascertain whether they expand or contract , so as to be able to account for differences which might be obtained in their conducting powers .
The metals used for the alloys were those which were easily obtained in a pure state in large quantities , and were purified as follows:1 .
Antimony.-By LIEBIG'S process .
2 .
Tin.-Commercial metal dissolved in nitric acid , and the binoxide reduced by charcoal .
3 .
Cadminum.-Commercial metal dissolved in hydrochloric acid and precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen ; the sulphide dissolved in hydrochloric acid and precipitated by carbonate of soda ; the carbonate heated , a part of the oxide reduced by hydrogen , and the rest distilled with charcoal .
4 .
Bismuth.-Commercial metal dissolved in nitric acid , precipitated by water and reduced by charcoal .
5 .
Silver.-Reduced from the pure chloride by fusion with carbonate of soda .
The greater part of the silver used for making the alloys was procured in a state of purity from Messrs. JOHNSON and MATTHEY .
6 .
Lead.-Commercial acetate recrystallized three times and heated .
7 .
Mlercury.-Commercial metal treated with nitric acid , and allowed to stand with it about a month , being at intervals well-shaken .
8 .
Gold.-Prepared by precipitating chloride of gold by algaroth powder , &amp;c. , and also by precipitation of the chloride of gold by protosulphate of iron* , &amp;c. Some of the gold employed was procured pure from Messrs. JOHNSON and MATTIIEY .
The quantity of each alloy made was about 20 grms. ; the two metals were weighed out accurately in proper proportions , and fused together in a porcelain crucible ; a jet of gas being allowed to play in the same from above to prevent the oxidation of the metals .
The alloys were cast in a wooden mould , a porcelain slab ( previously blackened by holding it over a gas flame to prevent the adhering of the metal ) forming the bottom .
They were always re-fused and re-cast , at least three times , before the first determination was made , then re-fused before they were determined a second time , and again before the third determination ; often being re-cast several times , as the castings did not always succeed .
To prevent as much as possible the formation of internal cavities from crystallization , the alloys were cast very thin , the thickness of the casting being in most cases about 3 to 4 millims. The method employed for taking the specific gravities , was that of hanging the alloys by a very fine platinum wire in distilled water , which had been boiled to free it from air , and allowed to cool in vacuo .
This method gave better results than that of weighing the metal or alloy in a bottle filled with water , on account of the difficulty of perfectly drying the bottle when full , and obtaining the same weight twice following .
The amalgams which were liquid , and those not sufficiently hard to hang by the platinum wire , were weighed in a glass tube to which a platinum wire was soldered .
The weight of the tube alone in air and water was determined at the temperature at which the experiments were made , and therefore , in calculating the specific gravities , these values had only to be subtracted from those found .
The balance used was one of LIEBIECH'S , which turns to the 01 mgr .
when loaded with 100 grms. in each pan ; and when the alloy was weighed in water , it turned to the 0'2 mgr .
The air adhering to the alloy , when weighed in water , was removed by a soft brush , the alloy being brushed until its weight became constant .
In calculating the specific gravities , the weight of the water displaced was corrected for the temperature , so that the unit is in all cases distilled water at 0 ?
C. A similar correction could not be made for the temperature of the alloys , as their coefficients of expansion are not known .
All the weighings were reduced to a vacuum , and a correction was made for that part of the platinum wire which dipped in the water .
The length of wire dipping in was about 60 millims. , which weighed 8 mgrs .
; these would lose in water about 0'35 mgr .
Supposing , as is really the case , that sometimes 10 millims. more or less dipped in , the error made would be about 0'06 mgr .
; but as the 0'3 mgr .
only make an error , if not brought into calculation , in most cases of about 0*001 per cent. of the specific gravity found , the error made in this way may be overlooked .

197 Table I. gives the specific gravities of the pure metals employed , and the temperature ( T. ) in the Centigrade scale : the values given are the results of three consecutive determinations .
On account of the number of alloys experimented with , it was considered as well , in order to save space , only to give the mean of the three determinations ; and where they did not agree amongst themselves to 0O1 per cent. of the value , a+ will be placed by the alloy , and the value there given is the mean of a number of experiments ( generally six or more)* .

Table II .
gives the mean of the three determinations made with the alloys , the mean of the temperatures ( T. ) , and the specific gravity calculated from the first of the following formulae : S ns+nAs1 S As + Alsl A+A , .
( 3 .
) where S=the specific gravity of the alloy , V and V =the volumes of the metals , taking n and n , = the numbers of the equivalents of the metals , and A and A their respective weights .
s and sl=their specific gravities .
The specific gravity of an alloy is calculated from the above formulae , under the supposition that the specific gravity of the metals employed take part of that of the alloy in the ratio of their relative volumes ( 1 .
) , equivalents ( 2 .
) , or weights ( 3 .
) .
Of these formulte only the first is for all cases correct , supposing the alloy neither contracts nor expands ; the second only when the volumes and equivalents of the metals employed are in the same ratio with each other , as in the case of gold , silver , &amp;c. ; and the third only when the specific gravities of the two metals are equal .
The two last methods of calculation are here mentioned , as several chemists have calculated their results from these formule .

, which gives in the fourth column the ratio of the sum of the volumes of the two metals to the volume of the alloy , it appears that the alloys of antimony are generally greater in volume than the aggregate of the constituent metals ( expand ) , while those of bismuth , silver , gold , and mercury , generally are less ( contract ) ; and we find that the maximum expansion or contraction generally takes place about that point when the alloy contains equal volumes of each metal .
The gold-tin and gold-lead alloys are all very brittle , except those very rich in lead or tin:-Sn Au2 to Sn3 Au are not at all crystalline , and have a glassy fracture ; Sn4 Au begins to show a crystalline structure , and has a crystalline fracture ; Sn , Au to SnO00 Au are exceedingly crystalline ; and Sn , Au to Sn , , Au all show a fracture like the cleavage plane of a crystal .
The gold-lead alloys appear all to be crystalline , that is , their surface is very much so , but their fracture is glassy .
The following alloys expand greatly on cooling , so much so , that the liquid metal breaks through the crust , forming large or small globules , viz. all those of bismuth-antimony , bismuth-gold , and bismuth-lead , which were experimented on ; those of bismuth-tin , from Bi210 Sn to Bi2 Sn , the rest of the series very slightly ; and bismuth-lead , viz. Bi,0 Pb to Bi4 Pb ( Big Pb slightly ) , the rest apparently not at all .
Of the bismuth-cadmium series , Bi Cd6 and Bi Cd4 expand very slightly , the rest not at all .
No concordant results could be obtained with any zinc-tin or zinc-cadmium alloys , on account of their very crystalline structure .
In conclusion , my best thanks are due to Dr. M. HOLZMANN , Mr. C. LONG , and Mr. M. CARTY for their assistance in carrying out the foregoing determinations .
