I. Description o the Photographs .
In February , 1890 .
I communicated to the Royal Society a preliminary note on some photographs of the spectrum of the Orion Nebula , taken at Westgate-on-Sea.# The detailed discussion of the photographs has been reserved with the hope of securing others , but owing to other pressing work no further photographs have been obtained .
As the photographs in question show a greater number of lines than others which have been described , and especially as they appear to have an important bearing on the study of certain types of stellar spectra , I have thought it desirable that the publication of the results should no longer be delayed .
The instrument employed was the thirty-inch reflector , and a spectroscope by Hilger , having one prism of 60 ' and two half-prisms of 30 ' .
Mawson 's instantaneous plates were used .
The exposures were carried up to four hours , and five photographs were taken , some of them with shorter exposures than that named , in consequence of the sky becoming clouded or irregularities in the driving * 'Roy .

L clock , which was not then completely finished .
One plate was exposed for four hours , on February 11 , 1890 , but , unfortunately , in consequence of the high wind , the slit was covered for an unknown part of this time by the velvet used to keep out stray light , and this was not at once discovered , as the finder for directing the telescope is at the lower end of the reflector tube , away from the spectroscope .
This photograph only shows three or four of the more prominent lines , but they are all sharply defined .
The other photographs were taken on February 2 , 8 , 9 , and 10 , the last with an exposure of three hours .
As a collimator has not yet been fitted to the tube of the reflector , the exposure of the plate to the flame of burning magnesium was made by closing the mirror cover , and burning magnesium at its exact centre .
One half of the slit was exposed to the nebula , and the other half to the burning magnesium .
The part of the nebula photographed was the bright portion in the region of the trapezium .
In some photographs , in consequence of clock irregularities , the stars of the trapezium have imprinted their spectra upon the plates , but these in no way interfere with the spectrum of the nebula , since a longish slit was used , and the spectra of the stars are narrow .
There is a remarkable and almost absolute similarity between the photographs obtained .
The best one , taken on February 10 , shows all the lines of the other photographs with others in addition , and this has therefore been selected for the determination of wave-lengths .
The probable mean position of the slit during the three hours ' exposure of this photograph is shown in fig. 1 , but the irregularities in the driving caused all the stars in the trapezium to cross the slit at different times .

hydrogen at Hy , Hs , He , and H^ , and the strong line in the ultra-violet near A. 373 .
Hy is by far the strongest line in the spectrum .
The wave-length of the least refrangible line on the photograph was taken as 5006*5 , as determined at Kensington , and this , together with the hydrogen lines , the line at A. 4471 , and the ultra-violet magnesium triplet in the comparison spectrum , formed the basis of the curve for determining the positions of the fainter lines .
The photograph was measured with a micrometer reading to 0*00001 inch .
All the lines are shown in the table which follows .
In all , fifty-four lines have been recorded , and , of these , about twenty are seen without difficulty .
The remainder require a favourable light , but no line has been inserted in the table which has not been measured several times by two observers .
The spectrum extends from the ultra-violet to the green , and the intensities of the lines on the photographs naturally do not correspond to the visual ones ; the F line , for instance , appears stronger than the brightest line in the visible spectrum at A. 5006 .
The photographic intensities are recorded in the table , six representing the strongest and one the feeblest line .
Some of the wave-lengths referred to in the preliminary paper have been slightly changed by the new reduction .

The Origins of the Lines .
It will be seen from the table , that hydrogen enters largely into the composition of the vapours of the nebula .
Hy , Hs , He , and the ultra-violet series , certainly as far as Hk ( new notation ) , * are all present .
It is worthy of remark , however , that while , as previously stated , Hy is the strongest line in the whole spectrum , and H^ , Hs , and He are also strong , the ultra-violet hydrogen lines are amongst the weakest .
Next to Hv , the line X 373 is the most intense .
In 1887 , I suggested that this line was one of the members of the triplet seen in the spectrum of burning magnesium .
As I stated in a preliminary communication , the wave-length could not be finally determined from the photographs already obtained , but it was probably near X 3729 .
This value , however , will require correction for motion in the line of sight .
If Mr. Keelers values !
for the motion be accepted , and .the earth 's orbital velocity be allowed for , the correction will be about 0*22 tenth metres towards the red .
This will bring the nebular line slightly nearer the least refrangible member of the magnesium triplet .
Further measures of photographs taken with higher dispersion are necessary in order to settle this point .
The lines next in importance to those already mentioned , are near wave-lengths 4471 , 4495 and 3868 .
The first of these , the strongest between and Hy , is probably the line observed by Dr. Copeland in 1886 .
With reference to this line , I wrote as follows in a paper communicated to the Loyal Society on Nov. 9 , 1889.J " The observations of Dr. Copeland have now , I think , established the identity of the yellow line , in the nebula of Orion at all events with D3 .
In a letter to Dr. Copeland , I suggested that the line at X 447 was , in all probability , Lorenzoni 's f of the chromosphere spectrum , seeing that it was associated both in the nebula and chromosphere with hydrogen and D3 .
This he believes to be very probable .
The line makes its appearance in the chromosphere spectrum about 75 times to 100 appearances of D3 , or the lines of hydrogen .
" For the other strong lines near X3868 and X 4495 , no origins have been found .
From the final reduction of the photographs , as given in the table , it appears that the line formerly saidS to be " near X4027 , " is at X 4025 .
It can , therefore , no longer be attributed to manganese .
Its origin is at present unknown , but , as will appear later , it is a line frequently met with in the spectra of other celestial bodies .
The line at X 4690 referred to above , does not appear in the revised list , which only contains lines measured without great difficulty .
Further , only a small proportion of the lines now mapped can be ascribed to metallic origins , but these , it will be seen , are * * * S * Vogel , ' Ast .

The table shows that a large number of the lines appear to have no terrestrial equivalent , but they are present m the spectra of other celestial bodies .
These coincidences are discussed in a subsequent part of the paper .
The Variation of the Spectrum in Different Regions of the Nebula .
The earlier investigations ot the photographic spectrum of the Orion Nebula seemed to indicate that the spectrum was different for different legions .
In my own observations in 1891 , with the 30-inch reflector at Westgate , the variations were very striking .
I stated in a paper communicated to the Royal Society in December , 1889 , * " I obtained momentary glimpses of many bright lines between and Hy , on October 31 .
" These were also seen by Mr. Fowler , and it was observed that , as the nebula was swept across the slit , in some parts the lines were seen together , while in other parts first one group and then another made their appearance .
In the same paper I referred also to the variations in the same field of view of some of the lines .
These observations were made with an enlarged form of pocket spectroscope , with a dispersion that does not split D. I found that in certain parts of the nebula , in the same field , certain lines were knotted , as often seen in prominences on and off the sun , and in other parts broken ; in the former case , whilst the F line thickened equally on both sides , the chief nebular line thickened only on the more refrangible side.t This result is shown in fig. 2 .

t In another paper ( 'Phil .
Trans. , 'A , 1893 , vol. 184 , p. 714 ) , 1 wrote as follows with regard to the chief line : I have convinced myself of the fluted nature of the line by new observations made with instruments best fitted to show it , while the Lick telescope is , perhaps , the ideal telescope not to employ in such an inquiry .
Hence , although the visibility of magnesium is not fundamental for my argument , I still hold that it is more probably the origin of the nebular line than an unknown form of nitrogen .

Phys. , ' January , 1894 , p. 61 ) , and Mr. Campbell ( Ast .
and Ast .
Phys. , May , 1894 , p. 385 ) , as to the relative efficiency of telescopes in regard to tli .
observation of spectium lines , seem to indicate that the matter has not been sufficiently thought out .
I have not seen a statement as to the percentage of light utilised in the case of the Lick telescope , bu may say that at the time my observations were made , the mirrors of my telescope were newly-silvered , so that probably only a small percentage of light was lost .
Neglecting the loss of light due to absorption in the case of the refractor , and to reflection in the case of the reflector , the brightness of the image formed on the sht of the spectroscope by the Westgate telescope is about sixteen times that of the image formed by the Lick telescope , and it is scarcely necessary to add that having this great 'f the sPec\lt ; \#153 ; scope has been designed to take full advantage of it .

Difference in the appearance of the lines at 4862 ( F ) and 5006'5 .
It is also recorded in the Observatory note-book that at times these lines appeared of unequal length , the spectroscope employed in the observations having a long slit , and that sometimes 500 and 495 were seen without H^ .
In the photographic investigation of variations in the spectrum , the question is complicated by differences in sensitive films , and in the case of a silver-on-glass reflector by the conditions of the mirrors .
My own experience has shown that when mirrors are tarnished , the ultra-violet portion of the spectrum is weakened in greater proportion than the violet and blue .
One of the most striking variations previously recorded is that of the strong line in the ultra-violet near \ 373 .
This was the strongest line in the photograph taken by Dr. Huggins in March , 1882 , * but it was not shown in Dr. Draper 's photograph taken in the same year.t Dr. Draper says : " I have not found the line at 3730 , of which he ( Dr. Huggins ) speaks , though I have other lines which he does not appear to have photographed .
This may be due to the fact that he had placed his slit on a different region of the nebula , or to his employment of a reflector and Iceland spar prism , or to the use of a different sensitive preparation .
Nevertheless , my reference spectrum extends beyond the region in question .
" A later photograph ( 1889 ) , taken by Dr. Huggins , ^ did not show the line in question , the slit being placed on a different part of the nebula .
As already stated , the line is one of the strongest in my photographs , though it is not quite as strong as Hy .
The spectrum photographed by Dr. Huggins , in 1889 , differed entirely from those photographed by him in 1882 and 1888 , the slit being again placed on a different region of the nebula .
My own photographs are specially interesting , as they indicate differences even in the small area of the nebula which is covered by the slit during a single exposure .

go professor j. n. lockyer on the PHOTOGRAPHIC Some of the more important variations are indicated in fig. 3 .
The stars , the spectra of which are registered on the plate , will be readily identified by a comparison of figs. 1 and 3 , the spectra of the trapezium stars being shown at the bottom of the diagram , and that of the star G. P. Bond 685 ( Herschel 's e ) at the top .
It will be seen , for example , that the line near A. 495 falls off in intensity about the middle of its length , while the lines of hydrogen show no such reduction in the same part of the nebula .
If we first consider the phenomena , in the neighbourhood of the star G. P. Bond 685 ( Herschel 's e ) , near the trapezium , it will be seen that here the lines 4471 and 4495 are most intense .
In this region there is also a distortion of the two lines at 4471 and 4495 ; they are sharply bent towards the red end of the spectrum , whilst the other lines remain straight .
Unfortunately , the spectrum of this star is only shown on the photograph of February 10 , and , in the absence of other photographs , it is possible that the displacement of the two lines in question may be due to a distortion of the gelatine film .
The displacement of the lines , if real , would indicate a velocity of about 200 miles per second , in the line of sight .
Both lines are brightest where they are most disturbed .

IN ORION .
Coming now to the region of the nebula about the stars of the trapezium , it will be seen from fig. 3 that the bright lines are considerably widened where they intersect the spectra of the trapezium stars .
In this case the hydrogen line at 4340 is widened very little on the less refrangible side , while , on the more refrangible side , the widening is nearly as great as its own breadth .
Further , on each side of the line there is a decided break in the continuous spectrum of the stars , giving the appearance of a broad absorption band , with the bright hydrogen line running through it .
This appearance is almost exactly reproduced at Hg .
Dr. Draper* appears to have noticed a peculiarity in the hydrogen lines where they crossed the spectra of the trapezium stars in his photographs of 1882 .
He says :\#151 ; " The hydrogen line near G , wave-length 4340 , is strong and sharply defined ; that at h , wave-length , 4101 , is more delicate ; and there are faint traces of other lines in the violet .
Among these lines there is one point of difference , especially well shown in a photograph where the slit was placed in a north and south direction across the trapezium ; the Hy line , X 4340 , is of the same length as the slit , and , where it intersects the spectrum of the trapezium stars , a duplication of effect is noticed .
If this is not due to flickering motion in the atmosphere , it would indicate that hydrogen gas was present even between the eye and the trapezium .
" I think the same is true of the Hs line , X 4101 .
" The line at 500 is only feebly impressed in the neighbourhood of the trapezium stars , and no reversal is visible .
It is clear , therefore , that the spectrum of the nebula varies very considerably in different regions .
Y. Discussion of Results in Relation to the Meteoritic Hypothesis .
In my paper , " On the Photographic Spectra of some of the Brighter Stars , " communicated to the Royal Society in November , 1892 , t I made reference to the spectra of nebulae in relation to the meteoritic hypothesis .
The statements were based upon an incomplete reduction of the photographs of the spectrum of the Orion nebula , and I now proceed to show how the hypothesis bears the test when the filial reductions are considered .
On the hypothesis :\#151 ; ( a ) The normal spectrum of the nebulae , including planetary nebulae !
, should have a complex origin .
( b ) The bright-line stars are simply nebulae further condensed .
( c ) With further condensation a group of stars of increasing temperature , with spectra consisting of mixed bright and dark fiutings , is produced .
( d ) Still further condensation results in a group of stars of increasing temperature , with spectra of dark lines , differing from the solar spectrum .

M 32 PROFESSOR J. N. LOCKYER ON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ( a ) The Complex Origin of the Spectra of the ? .
As pointed out in the paper referred to , the bright lines should have three origins , namely:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Non-condensable gases driven out of the meteorites .
( 2 ) Low temperature vapours produced by a large number of feeble collisions .
( 3 ) High temperature vapours produced by a small number of end-on collisions .
It will be seen from the tables that the requirements of the hypothesis in this respect are fully satisfied .
The lines of hydrogen and the flutings of carbon are what we should expect from the large interspaces ; the flutings of magnesium and the low temperature lines of iron and calcium bring us face to face with phenomena connected with low temperatures , and they may be ascribed to the partial collisions ; while the lines coincident with chromospheric lines must be regarded as high temperature products , since the solar chromosphere may be taken as indicating the spectrum we might expect to be associated with the high temperature vapours produced by the end-on collisions .
The undoubted presence of the lines D3 and X4471 left but little doubt as to the chromospheric relationship of some of the lines in the nebular spectrum , but the flood of new light thrown by the photographs taken with the prismatic cameras during the total eclipse of the sun on April 16th , 1893 , put the matter beyond all question .
The discussion of the eclipse photographs will form the subject of a separate communication , but it may be here stated that the spectrum of the nebula shows a number of coincidences with lines seen in the spectrum of the chromosphere and prominences .
( 6 ) The Passage to the Bright-Line Stars .
The association of the nebuke with the bright-line stars in the classification of the heavenly bodies was , I think , first suggested by me in 1887.# So far as the planetary nebulae are concerned , this grouping has been abundantly confirmed by Professor Pickering 's work on the bright-line stars , and by the visual observations of Professor Keeler .
Professor Pickering !
tabulates the lines , and concludes with the statement that , " Owing to the similarity of the spectra of the planetary nebulae and the bright-line stars , they may be conveniently united in a fifth type .
" It is clear then , that in this particular , Professor Pickering accepts my proposed classification Mr. Keeler writes , * " The spectra of the nuclei of the planetary nebulae have a remarkable resemblance to the Wole-KAYEt and other bright-line stars , and an * 1 Roy .

SPECTRUM OF THE GREAT NEBULA IN ORION .
intimate connection between these objects , if established by further observations , would place the bright-line stars first in the order of development .
The D5 line appears in the central condensation of a number of bright nebulae , and with sufficient light would probably be seen in many of them , and this line is also predominant in most of the bright-line stars .
" One of the main points of this paper is to show that the relationship indicated between the planetary nebulae and bright-line stars also holds good for such a nebula as that of Orion .
The bright lines seen in the visual spectra of the two classes of nebulae have long been known to be identical , and a comparison of the Westgate photographs with the results obtained by Professor Pickering , and the more recent work of Gothard , # and of Professor Campbell , at the Lick Observatory , on the spectra of the planetary nebulae , t has shown that the similarity also extends to the photographic region .
The fact that some of the nebular lines were apparently coincident with lines in the bright-line stars , was recognized at an early stage in the reduction of the Westgate photographs , and in the preliminary note I wrote as follows : " It is a very striking fact that some of the chief lines are apparently coincident , although the statement is made with reserve , with the chief bright lines in P Cygni , a magnificent photograph of which I owe to the kindness of Professor Pickering ; it is one of the Henry Draper Memorial photographs .
" The bright lines here referred to were those of hydrogen , and lines at 4025 and 4471 .
All these have since been photographed at Kensington , in the spectrum of P Cygni , and there is no longer any doubt as to their identity with bright lines in the nebula .
Additional bright lines in the spectrum of P Cygni , photographed at Kensington , are also seen in the nebula , as shown in the following table ; \#151 ; Table II.\#151 ; Comparison of Orion Nebula with P Cygni .

( c ) Relation to Stars of Groups and With farther condensation , the interspaces between the meteorites will be reduced , and the bright-line stars will pass to stars with absorption spectra in which the dark lines correspond with the bright lines of the nebulae .
There will , however , be intermediate stages ( Group II .
and the early stages of Group III .
) , as I have already pointed out.# At these stages , some of the high-temperature lines do not appear either as bright or dark lines , and this , no doubt , for the reason that the radiation from the interspaces is masked by the absorption of the vapours in the immediate neighbourhood of the meteoritic stones .
In these stars the hydrogen lines are normally feeble dark lines , but the amount of radiating area in a cross section is so nearly equal to the amount of absorbing area that disturbances which , according to the meteoritic hypothesis , produce the increase of light in the variable stars of the group , are sufficient to make the hydrogen lines appear bright .
When we pass to the more condensed bodies , we find a group of stars , of which y Cygni is a typical case , in which the dark lines are very numerous , !
but different from those which appear in the solar spectrum .
This difference , however , is not taken account of in Yogel 's classification of stellar spectra .
It may be added that photographs of the spectra of other stars resembling y Cygni have been obtained since the date of the paper referred to .
At a still further stage of condensation we get stars in which there are only a relatively small number of lines , and these are lines which appear in the nebulae .
This similarity became evident at an early stage of the discussion of the photographic spectrum of the Orion nebula , and a comparison with the spectrum of a Andromedae was given in the paper communicated to the lioyal Society , in November , 1892.J The first suggestion of such a relation appears to have been made by Dr. Scheiner , of Potsdam , S who pointed out that the strong line at X 4471 , which had been observed in the Orion nebula by Dr. Copeland , was also seen in the Potsdam photographs of the spectrum of Rigel .
This line is one of the brightest in the nebula photographs now under discussion , and is seen in the spectra of a large number of stars of the type of Uigel and Bellatrix .
The spectra of such stars in the region between K and A 472 are described in my paper referred to above ; and in Table IY .
they are compared with the spectrum of the Orion nebula .
It will be seen that out of 31 lines in the nebula in the region compared , 20 are coincident with stellar lines .

|| It may be added that D3 , which appears bright in the nebula , was observed by Mr. Fowler as a dark line in the spectrum of 7 and g Orionis , on Dec. 12 , 1893 , and in Rigel on March 4 , 1894 .
It does not , however , appear in the spectrum of Sirius or \#171 ; Lyrse .
D3 has also been photographed as a dark line in the spectra of ( 3 and e Orionis , by Mr. Campbell at the Lick Observatory .

* 4714 ( 3 ) In the accompanying map ( fig. 4 ) an attempt is made to show the gradual change of the bright lines of the nebulae and bright-line stars into dark ones as condensation proceeds .
Not all the lines seen in the various spectra , but only those which best illustrate the results of progressive condensation , are dealt with .
In the spectrum of the Orion nebula and planetary nebulae , the lines shown in the map are those which afterwards appear as bright lines in the bright-line stars , or as dark lines in some of the more condensed bodies .
The lines mapped as belonging to the bright-line stars are those which appear twice in Professor Pickering 's lists , to which reference has been made , except in the case of the important line at A 4471 , which has been included because it appears in P Cygni as well as in one of Pickering 's types of bright-line stars .

The approximate intensities of the various lines in the map are represented by their thicknesses .

they thicken pretty regularly ; but other causes besides temperature may possibly affect their apparent thickness , as I have previously pointed out.t In addition to the lines of hydrogen , other lines , including the H and K lines of * See ' Phil. Trans./ vol. 184 , 1893 , p. 725 .

are based on wave-lengths of the ultra-violet lines of hydrogen on Howland 's scale , according to Professor Hale.1 ' The wave-lengths have been left in these different scales , because the differences are only minute , and , in general , in the ultra-violet region , less than the assumed accuracy of the wave-lengths as determined by the instruments at our disposal .

General Conclusions .
( 1 ) The spectrum of the nebula of Orion is a compound one consisting of hydrogen lines , low temperature metallic lines and flutings , and high temperature lines .
The mean temperature , however , is relatively low.* ( 2 ) The spectrum is different in different parts of the nebula .
( 3 ) The spectrum bears a striking resemblance to that of the planetary nebulas and bright-line stars .
( 4 ) The suggestion , therefore , that these are bodies which must be closely associated in any valid scheme of classification is strengthened .
( 5 ) Many of the lines which appear bright in the spectrum of the nebula appear dark in the spectra of stars of Groups II .
and III .
, and in the earlier stars of Group IV .
; and a gradual change from bright to dark lines has been found .
( 6 ) The view , therefore , that bright-line stars occupy an intermediate position between nebulae and stars of Group III .
is greatly strengthened by these researches .
I have to express my great obligations to Mr. Fowler for the zeal and patience which he displayed in taking the photographs under somewhat unfavourable conditions .
He is responsible for the determination of the wave-lengths of the lines and has assisted in the discussion .
Messrs. Baxandall and Shackleton , computers to the Solar Physics Committee , have assisted in the preparation of the tables and the map illustrating the changes of spectrum with increasing condensation .
