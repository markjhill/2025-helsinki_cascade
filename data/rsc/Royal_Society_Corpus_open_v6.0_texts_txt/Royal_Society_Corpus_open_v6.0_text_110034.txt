On the Chinese Year .

] After stating his opinion that the Chinese are possessed of no original astronomical knowledge , but that that which they possess is entirely of foreign origin , since in former times they even adopted the errors of European astronomers ; and that the instruments mentioned by Du Halde as having been found by the missionaries on their first entrance into the country , were constructed by the Arabians ; the author proceeds to confirm this opinion by an account of the division of the Chinese year , and a comparison of the Chinese with the European zodiac .
The former is divided into twenty-eight constellations , and Mr. Davis has represented these in an annexed drawing , with the number of degrees affixed to each ; from which it appears that they are extremely unequal , the largest consisting of 30 ?
, and the least of not more than 5 ? .
Of these constellations , Kio , which corresponds to a part of Virgo , is considered as the first in order ; which is perhaps a proof , says the author , that in some former period their year commenced at this point .
As far , however , as Mr. Davis 's information , the Chinese have no solar year , their year , properly considered , being a lunar year , consisting of twelve months , of twenty-nine and thirty days alternately , with the occasional addition of a thirteenth month , to make it correspond more nearly with the sun 's course .
