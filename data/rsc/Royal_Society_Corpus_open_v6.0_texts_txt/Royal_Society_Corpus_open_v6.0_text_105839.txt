Account of the Transit of Venus over the Sun 's Disk , as observed at Norriton , in the County of Philadelphia , and Province of Pennsylvania , June 3 , 1769 .
By William Smith , D. D. Provost of the College of Philadelphia ; John Lukens , Esquire , Surveyor-General of Pennsylvania ; David Rittenhouse , A. M. of Norriton ; and John Sellers , Esquire , one of the Representatives in Assembly for Chester County ; the Committee appointed for that Observation , by the American Philosophical Society , held at Philadelphia , for promoting useful Knowledge .
Communicated to the said Society , in Behalf , and by Direction , of the Committee , by Doctor Smith ; and to the Royal Society of London , by Nevil Maskeline , B. D. Astronomer Royal .
GENTLEMEN , AMONG the various public-spirited designs , that have engaged the attention of this Society since its first institution , none VOL. LIX .
Pp does Read Nov. 23 , does them more honour than their early resolution to appoint Committees , from their own members , to make as many observations , in different places , of that rare phenomenon , the transit of Venus over the Sun 's disk , as they had any probability of being able to desray the expense of , either from their own funds , or the public assistance they expected .
As the members of the Committee above mentioned live at some distance from each other , I am therefore now , by their direction , and in their behalf , to collect , and lay before you , the whole of the Norriton observations ; distinguishing however , so far as may be necessary , the part of each observer ; and going back to the first preparations .
For I am persuaded that the dependence which the learned world will place on any particular transit account , will be altogether in proportion to the previous and subsequent care , which they find hath been taken , in a series of accurate and well-conducted observations , for regulating the time-pieces , and ascertaing the latitude and longitude of the place of observation , &amp;c. And I am the more desirous to be particular in these points , in order to do justice to Mr. Rittenhouse , one of our Committee ; to whose extraordinary skill and diligence is owing whatever advantage may be derived in these respects to our observation of the transit itself .
It is further conceived , that the learned and curious will be desirous to have not only the work relative to each particular transit account , but the materials also , that they may have an opportunity to examine and conclude for themselves .
And it is a pleasure to us that we are able to communicate so complete a set of observations in every material article .
The great discouragement which the different Committees laboured under , at their first appointment by this Society , was the want of proper apparatus , especially good telescopes .
The generosity of our Provincial Assembly soon removed a very considerable part of this discouragement , not only by their vote to purchase one of the best reflecting telescopes , with Dollond 's micrometer , but likewise by their subsequent benefaction of one hundred pounds , for erecting observatories , and defraying other incidental expenses .
It was foreseen that , on the arrival of this telescope * , added to other private ones that could be procured in this city , and the fitting up the instruments belonging to the honourable Proprietaries , viz. the large astronomical sector , and the equal altitude and transit instrument , nothing would be wanting for the city observatory , erected in the Statehouse Square , but a good time-piece , which was easily to be procured .
We remained , however , still at a loss how to furnish the Norriton observatory .
But this difficulty gradually vanished .
Early in September , 1768 , soon after the nomination of the Committees , I received a letter from that worthy and honourable gentleman , Thomas Penn , Esquire , one of the Proprietors of this province , expressing his desire that we would exert ourselves in observing the transit , for which our situation was so favourable ; and enclosing some copies of Mr. Maskelyne 's directions for that purpose .
* This telescope came to hand in April , 1769 .
It was made by Nairne , 41/ 2 feet , and its greatest magnifying power 400 times ; with an excellent micrometer .
This gave an opportunity , which I embraced immediately , to inform Mr. Penn , that this Society , before the receipt of his letter , had appointed two * Committees for the business he proposed ; that the Assembly had generously ordered one hundred pounds , sterling , to purchase one telescope , as above set forth ; but that we should be at a great loss for a telescope and micrometer , of the like construction , for the Norriton observatory ; requesting him to order a reflector of 21/ 2 feet , with Dollond 's micrometer , to be got ready in London ; which I was in hopes I should prevail on our College to pay for , and take for their own use , as soon as the corporation should have an opportunity of meeting .
It was not long before I had the pleasure to hear that Mr. Penn had ordered such a telescope .
which came to hand in due time , with a most obliging letter , expressing his satisfaction in the spirit shown at Philadelphia for observing this curious phenomenon , and concluding as follows : I have sent by Captain Sparks a reflecting telescope , with Dollond 's micrometer , exact to your request , which I hope will come safe to hand .
After making your observation with it , I desire you will present it , in my name , to the College .
Messieurs Mason and Dixon tell me , they never used a better than that which I formerly sent to the Library Company of Philadelphia , with which a good observation~may be made , although it has no micrometer.''* A third Committee was afterwards appointed , to observe at or near Cape Henlopen .
~ Mr. Owen Biddle , who was appointed by the Society to conduct the observation near Cape Henlopen , had this telescope ; We were now enabled to furnish the Norriton observatory , as follows : 1 .
A 21/ 2 feet Gregorian reflector , with a Dollond 's micrometer , made by Nairne , its magnifying powers 55 , 95 , 135 , and 200 times .
The gift of the honourable Thomas Penn , Esquire , to the College of Philadelphia .
Used by Doctor Smith .
2 .
A refractor of 42 feet , its magnifying power about 140 .
The glasses sent to the Assembly , with the large reflector , from England .
Used by Mr. Lukens .
3 .
Mr. Rittenhouse 's refractor , with an object glass of 36 feet focus , and a convex eye glass of 3 inches , magnifying about 144 times .
Used by himself .
4 .
An excellent clock ; a transit telescope , nicely moving in the plane of the meridian ; and a very accurate equal altitude instrument , supported , in the observatory , on a stone pedestal .
These three articles were also Mr. Rittenhouse 's private property , and made by himself , whereof some mention is made below .
5 .
An astronomical quadrant , 21/ 2 feet radius , made by Sisson ; the property of the proprietors of East New Jersey ; under the care of the right honourable William Earl of Stirling , surveyorgeneral of that province , who kindly permitted us the use of it .
nothing being desired here but the contacts , and their exact time , which he obtained to great satisfaction , as by his report may appear .
As Mr. Rittenhouse 's dwelling at Norriton is 20 miles N. W. of Philadelphia , our other engagements did not permit Mr. Lukens , or myself , to pay much attention to the necessary preparations ; but we knew that we had entrusted them to a gentleman on the spot , who had , joined to a complete skill in mechanics , so extensive an astronomical and mathematical knowledge , that the construction , use , and management of all the necessary apparatus are perfectly familiar to him .
The dull and rainy weather prevented our setting out for his house till Thursday , June 1 ; and we found , on our arrival there , every preparation so forward , that we had little to do but to examine and adjust our respective telescopes to distinct vision .
Mr. Rittenhouse had completed his observatory , fitted up the different instruments , and made a great number of observations , for fixing the latitude and longitude of the observatory , and ascertaining the going of his time-piece .
The laudable pains he has taken in these material articles will best appear from the work itself , which I received from him a few days ago , with the following very obliging letter ; giving me a liberty which his own accuracy , care , and abilities leave me no room to exercise ; and therefore what follows is entirely as he drew it up , viz. To the Reverend Doctor SMIT H. Dear Sir , The enclosed is the best account I can give of the contacts , as I observed them , and of what I saw during the interval between them .
I should be glad you would contract them ( and the other papers ) into a smaller compass , as I would have done myself , if I had known how .
I beg you would not copy any thing merely because I have written it , but leave out what you think superfluous .
I am , with great esteem and affection , Yours , Norriton , July 18 , 1769 .
` ` DAVID RITTENHOUSE .
' ' Mr. Rittenhouse ' account of the observations made by him , at Norriton , before and after the transit of Venus , June 3 , 1769 ; for determining the longitude and latitude of his observatory , regulating his clock , &amp;c. Early in November , 1768 , I began to erect an observatory , agreeable to the resolutions of the American Philosophical Society ; but , through various disappointments from workmen and weather , could not complete it till the middle of April , 1769 .
I had for some time expected the use of an equal altitude instrument from Philadelphia ; but finding I could not depend on having it , I fell to work and made one , of as simple a construction as I could contrive .
It has a good telescope of 31/ 2 feet focal length , with two horizontal and one vertical wire , in the focus , and is very easily adjusted to a plummet wire , 4 feet in length , by two screws ; one of which moves it in a north and south , the other in an east and west direction .
The 20th of March this instrument was finished , and put up out of doors , the obserservatory being not yet ready .
I had , however , for some weeks before this , with my 36 feet refractor , observed eclipses of Jupiter 's first satellite , in such a manner , that though my equal altitude instrument was not finished , and consequently I could not set my timepiece to apparent noon , I should , notwithstanding , be able to tell the true time of those eclipses afterwards , when the instrument should be finished .
For this purpose , I observed , almost every fair evening , the time by the clock , when the bright star in Orion disappeared behind a fixed obstacle , by applying my eye to a small sighthole , made through a piece of brass , fastened to a strong post .
The observations were as follows:1769 .

Care , however , was taken to observe equal altitudes of the Sun on the day preceding and following any visible eclipse of the 1st satellite .

It had no provision for preventing the irregularities arising from heat and cold ; nor could I find leisure to apply any contrivance of this sort .
It had been made some time before , to determine the variations arising from those causes .
The pendulumrod is a flat steel bar , with a bob weighing about twelve pounds , and vibrates in a small arch .
It goes eight days , beats dead seconds , does not stop when wound up , and is kept in motion by a weight of five pounds .
The ill state of my health would not permit me to sit up at nights , to take equal altitudes of the stars .
I was therefore obliged to content myself with those of the Sun only .
I had , some time before this , viz. May 12 , got a telescope fixed in the meridian , on an axis with fine steel points ; so that the hair in its focus could move in no other direction than along the meridian .
I set up two marks , north and south , about 60 rods distant each , to which it can readily be adjusted , in a horizontal position , by a screw ; as it can likewise by another screw in a vertical position .
The two marks were shifted from day to day , until they were found within less than one second of time of the true meridian .
May 20 , I likewise put wires , instead of hairs , in the telescope of the equal altitude instrument ; and the following are the observations taken both with it , and with the meridian or transit telescope , in the order wherein they were made : Hence the Sir Observed eclipses Observations with the meridian ~ the Equal altitudes of the Sun~ on meridiao .

The difference of the above observations is greater than might be wished .
All that I can offer to excuse them is the want of better instruments ; although I think the differences were much owing to the action of the Sun on the wooden frame , which supported the quadrant .
For I always found , that when the shutter in the roof was opened , the plummet-wire would , in a minute or two , leave the point , although it had stood quietly over it all the forenoon .
Nevertheless , a mean from so many observations may be supposed very near the truth ; since , if we leave out that of June 6 , which differs most from the others , the mean of them will be but 2~ greater than the latitude set down above.''So far I have given Mr. Rittenhouse 's account of his observations , previous and subsequent to the transit ; for regulating his time-piece , and fixing the latitude and longitude ; containing many months work , viz. from February 15 to July 8 .
More observations have been taken since , but the above are thought sufficient .
It hath been already mentioned , that it was not till Thursday afternoon , June 1 , that Mr. Lukens and myself arrived at Norriton , with a design to continue with Mr. Rittenhouse till the transit should be over .
When we set out , the prospect before us was very discouraging .
That day , and several preceding , had been constantly overcast with clouds , and frequent heavy rains , a thing not common for so long a period at that season of the year , in this part of America .
But , on Thursday evening , by one of those sudden transitions which we often experience here , the weather became perfectly clear in less than the space of one hour , and continued the day following , as well as the day of the transit , in such a state of serenity , splendor of sunshine , and purity of atmosphere , that not the least appearance of cloud was to be seen in the whole heavens .
June 2 , and the forenoon of June 3 , were spent in making the necessary preparations ; such as , examining and marking the foci of the telescopes , particularly the reflector with and without the micrometer , and in its different powers .
The reflector was also placed on a polar axis ; and such supports were contrived for resting the ends of the refractors , as might give them a motion as nearly parallel to the plane of the equator as such hasty preparations would permit .
Several diameters of the Sun were taken during this time , and the micrometer examined by such other methods as the time would allow .
The Sun was so intensely bright on the day of the transit , that it was found best , early in the forenoon , to lay aside the coloured glasses , brought with the reflecting telescope from England ; and to put on deeply-smoaked glasses , which Mr. Lukens prepared , in their room ; and which gave a much more beautiful and well-defined appearance of the Sun .
Mr. Rittenhouse , on a supposition of the Sun 's horizontal parallax being but 8~ , had , in one of his calculations of the time of the transit , made in September , 1768 , brought out the first external contact , at Philadelphia , to be June 3 , 2h 11~ , mean time .
It happened , that he was not many seconds wrong in this , although most other calculations made it from 6~ to 8~ later for Philadelphia .
We thought it prudent therefore , at one o'clock , to take off the micrometer from the reflector , which had been used with a magnifying power of 95 times ; and , after adjusting the focus , continued the same power for the reasons mentioned * below , in order to observe the transit ; and lest the external contact might happen still sooner than the earliest predicted time , it was resolved , during the hour from one till two , to keep an alternate watch , through the reflector , on that half of the Sun 's limb where the contact must happen ; while those not thus employed were making all other preparations as follows , viz. 1 .
That each of us might the better exercise our own judgment , without being influenced , or thrown into any agitation or surprise by the others ; it was agreed to transact every thing by signals , and that one observer should not know what the others were doing .
The situation of the telescopes , the reflector being within the observatory , and the two refractors , mounted at some distance from each other without it , favoured this purpose .
Wherefore , 2 .
Two persons , viz. Mr. Sellers , one of our committee , for whom no telescope could be pro* As the refracting telescopes gave but a small field , and were very unmanageable , on account of their length , and the Sun 's great altitude , it was thought best to use a smaller power and larger field with the reflector , that if the contact should happen at a different part of limb than where it was expected , one of us , at least , might be sure not to miss it , but give notice to the others .
It was agreed , however , that if the contact happened at or very near the part of the limb where we did expect it , no such notice was to be given .
It was , although , thought best to have some difference in the magnifying powers ; and the vision with the reflector was so distinct and well defined , that I am well pleased I used no higher power .
vided , and Mr. Archibald M`Clean , both men of abilities , and accustomed to astronomical observations , were placed in one window of the observatory , to count the clock , and take the signals from Mr. Lukens .
Two others , who live in Mr. Rittenhouse 's family , and have been trained by him to services of this kind , stood in another window , within the observatory , to count the time , and take his signals .
I was within hearing of the beats of the clock , and was to count and set down my own time .
These preliminaries thus settled , at two o'clock , each of us applied to our respective telescopes ; but as there was a great concourse of many of the principal inhabitants of the county , we were apprehensive , that our scheme for silence and order might be interrupted by the impatience and curiosity natural on such occasions .
We therefore informed the gentlemen , who had honoured us with their company , that the accuracy and success of our observations would depend on our not being disturbed with the least noise , till the contacts were over .
And to do the company justice , during the 12 minutes that ensued before the first contact , there could not have been a more solemn pause of expectation and silence , if each individual had stood ready to receive the sentence that was to give him life or death .
So regular and quiet was the whole , that , far from hearing a word spoken , I did not even hear the feet of the four counters , who had passed behind me from the windows to the clock ; and I was surprised , when I rose up and turned to the clock , to find them all there before me , counting up their seconds to an even number ; as I imagined , from the deep silence , that my associates had yet seen nothing of Venus .
As the contacts are reckoned to be one of the most essential articles relative to this phenomenon , it is material , before we set down their times , to give a particular account of the manner in which each observer judged of them , and the other circumstances attending them .
Mr. RITTENHOUSE'S Account of the CONTACTS .
At 2h 11~ 39~ per clock , the Reverend Mr. Barton , of Lancaster , who assisted me at the telescope , on receiving my signal , as had been agreed , instantaneously communicated it , by waving a handkerchief , to the counters at the window , who , walking softly to the clock , counting as they went along , noted down their times separately , agreeing to the same second .
And three seconds sooner than this , to the best of my judgment , was the time when the least impression made by Venus on the Sun 's limb could be seen through my telescope .
When the Planet had advanced about one third of her diameter on the Sun , as I was steadily viewing its progress , my sight was suddenly attracted by a beam of light , which broke through on that side of Venus yet off the Sun .
Its figure was that of a broad-based pyramid ; situated at about 40 or 45 degrees on the limb of Venus , from a line passing through her center and the Fig. 2 .

See TAB. XV .
fig. 1.-About the same time , the Sun 's light began to spread round Venus on each side , from the points where their limbs intersected each other , as is likewise represented in fig. 1 .
As Venus advanced , the point of the pyramid still grew lower , and its circular base wider , until it met the light which crept round from the points of intersection of the two limbs : so that when half the Planet appeared on the Sun , the other half was entirely surrounded by a semicircular light , best defined on the side next to the body of Venus , which continually grew brighter , till the time of the internal contact .
See fig. 2 .
Imagination cannot form any thing more beautifully serene and quiet than was the air during the whole time ; nor did I ever see the Sun 's limb more perfectly defined , or more free from any tremulous motion ; to which his great altitude undoubtedly contributed much .
When the internal contact ( as it is called ) drew nigh , I foresaw that it would be very difficult to fix the time with any certainty , on account of the great breadth and brightness of the light which surrounded that part of Venus yet off the Sun .
After some consideration , I resolved to judge as well as I could of the co-incidence of the limbs ; and accordingly gave the signal for the internal contact at 2h 28~ 45~ by the clock , and immediately began to count seconds , which any one , accustomed to it , may do , for a minute or two , very near the truth .
In this manner , I counted no less than 1~ 32~ before the effects of the atmosphere of Venus on the Sun 's limb wholly disappeared , leaving that part of the limb as well defined as the rest .
From this I concluded , that I had given the signal too soon ; and the times given by the other observers confirm me in this opinion .
' ' Mr. LUKENS'S Account of the CONTACTS .
The telescope I used , being a refracting one of 42 feet , giving but a small field , and something difficult to manage ; I was obliged to move often , and apprehend that I did not discover the first external contact exactly .
For , after one of those movements , on bringing the glass to bear again on that part of the Sun 's limb where Venus was expected , I saw a large tremulous shadow , already somewhat advanced , and seeming to press still inwards on the Sun 's limb .
Having contemplated this for a few seconds , and perceiving the appearance grow more dark , and make a better-defined impression on the limb , I gave the signal to the persons who counted time for me , which they noted down separately at 2h 12~ 3~ by the clock .
When Venus was near one half her diameter advanced on the Sun , I saw a border of light encompassing that part of her which was yet off the Sun .
This was so bright , that it rendered that part of Venus visible , and pretty well defined , although off the Sun .
But , towards the internal contact , the circular border of light became of a more dusky colour , especially at the two points where the luminous segments of the Sun 's limb were ready to close round the Planet .
This duskiness did not seem to part wholly from the Sun 's limb , at the time I apprehended the body of Venus to be wholly entered on the Sun , and when I gave the signal for the internal contact ; which was noted at 2h 28~ 58~ by the clock .
And I judge from 6~ to 8~ more , before I saw the Sun 's limb clear of this dusky surrounding shadow , and as well defined as before the first contact .
' ' Dr. SMITH'S Account of the CONTACTS .
Having , for reasons already assigned , determined to continue one of the smaller powers of the Gregorian reflector , for observing the contacts ( viz. that which we had been using , and were again touse , with the micrometer , magnifying 95 times ) , I had a large field , taking in , at least , one half of the Sun 's disk ; and the telescope was so firmly supported ( with its axis in a polar direction ) , that it could not be shaken by any motion on the earthen floor of the observatory , and required only a small movement of one of the handles of the rack-work to manage it .
With these advantages , it was easy to keep any part of the Sun 's limb in the middle of the field , without neglecting to cast my eye , every three or four seconds , on every other part of the limb on both sides , where there was any possibility of the contact to happen , It being now within about half a minute of the time which Mr. Rittenhouse had calculated for the first contact , I called to the four counters at the windows , to be very attentive to those who were to give the signals from the telescopes without doors ; and turning my eye to that part of the limb where the contact was expected , I had been , for several seconds , viewing it steadfastly , when , all at once , I saw something strike into it like a watery pointed shadow , appearing to give a tremulous motion to that part of the Sun 's limb , although the telescope stood quite firm , and not the least disturbance or undulation was perceptible in any other part of the limb .
The idea I had formed of the contact wasthat Venus would instantaneously make a welldefined black and small dent or impression on the Sun .
But this appearance was so different , the disturbance on the Sun 's limb so undulatory , pointed , ill-defined , waterish , and occupying a larger portion of the limb than I expected , that I was held in a suspense of five or six seconds , to examine whether it might not be some small skirt of a watery flying cloud .
But perceiving this shadow , or whatever else it was , to press still forward on the limb , with the same tremulous , pointed appearance ( the longest points towards its middle ) , I began to count the clock for either fifteen or sixteen seconds , when a well defined black dent , occupying a less space on the Sun 's limb , became plainly visible .
I then quitted the telescope , and turned to the clock , to note this time for the contact , which was 2h 12~ 5~ .
About 22~ sooner than this ( being doubtful to two or three seconds at first ) was the first impression I saw on the limb ; which I have marked accordingly at 2h 11~ 40~ to 43~ .
If this first impression is to be taken for the external contact , I think it might be judged of to a single second of time ; which one could not do by several seconds , either with respect to the internal contact , or even with respect to the moment of the distinct black dent made at the external contact , both which are far from being instantaneously perceptible .
Whether a telescope of larger powers than what I used might not have shown this first impression sooner ( be it an atmosphere or whatever else ) , I will not determine ; though from Mr. Rittenhouse 's time I think it probably would .
But I am sure that I saw the first stroke that was perceptible through my telescope , and might have noted it to a single second , had I expected it in that way .
As to the internal contact , the thread of light , coming round from both sides of the Sun 's limb , did not close instantaneously , but with an uncertainty of several seconds , the points of the threads darting into each other , and parting again , in a quivering manner , several times before they finally adhered .
I waited for this adherence with all the attention in my power , and noted it down for the internal contact at 2h 29~ 5~ , a few seconds later than Mr. Lukens , who took the same method of judging .
Having quitted my telescope to note down the time , the gentlemen who counted for us , as well as several others now come into the observatory , were anxious to see Venus on the Sun through the reflector , as it was easily manageable ; an indulgence not to be denied ; and therefore I did not sit down to it again till about four or five minutes before the internal contact , and then not with much attention till the contact was at hand ; so that I saw none of those appearances , on the part of Venus off the Sun , mentioned by my associates .
But their account may be depended on ; for Mr. Rittenhouse 's abilities have been spoken of before ; and few persons have a better judgment , a correcter eye , or have been more accustomed to view objects , both celestial and terrestrial , through telescopes , than Mr. Lukens .
As to the small differences in the times of our contacts , it is presumed , they may be easily reconciled , partly from the different powers of the telescopes , and partly from the other circumstances mentioned in the manner of judging of them .
At any rate , we have set them down faithfully .
As to the first disturbance made on the Sun 's limb , it may he worth considering , whether it was really from the interposition of the limb of Venus , or of her atmosphere ?
The former , one could not easily imagine it to be , unless her limb and body were much more uneven than they appeared to be when seen on the Sun .
An atmosphere it might more probably seem to be , not only from the faintness of the colour , but the undulatory motion , which might arise from the growing density of the atmosphere , as it pushes forward on the Sun , varying the refraction of the rays .
If such an atmosphere be allowed , then it probably gives the same tremulous motion , at the internal contact , to the thread of light creeping round Venus ; and prevents its closing quietly till the atmosphere ( or at least its densest part ) be wholly on the Sun ; and consequently the true coincidence of the limbs be past .
For though the atmosphere of Venus cannot be seen on the Sun , yet that part which is surrounding , or just entering on the Sun 's limb , having , as it were , a darker ground behind it , may be visible .
But these are only little conjectures submitted to others ; though if they have any foundation , it would make some difference in the time estimated between the contacts .
' ' General Table of the contacts of the limbs of the Sun and Venus , as observed at Norriton , June 3 , 1769 , reduced to apparent time .
N. B. June 3 , by the preceding Tables of the work , the Sun 's center was on the meridian , at 11h 58~ 49~ by the clock , and June 4 , at 11h 59~ 2~ , and therefore gained 13~ in 24 hours of apparent time .
Wherefore at noon June 3 , the clock being 1~ 11~ slow of apparent time , it was only 1~ 10~ slow at the observation of the contacts .

Such of the micrometer measures as were taken by Mr. Rittenhouse or Mr. Lukens , are marked with the initials of their names .

Our observations being thus finished , Mr. Rittenhouse was pleased to undertake the projection of the transit from them ; and his account of the work follows : Delineation of the transit of Venus over the Sun , according to the Norriton observations , with the principles of the work .
By Mr. Rittenhouse .
See Tab. XV .
fig. 4 .
The Sun 's horizontal parallax is assumed 8~,65 at his mean distance from the earth ; from which , and the observed least distance of the centers of the Sun and Venus , the chord for the transit line was laid down .
The semi-diameters of the Sun and Venus are taken as by the above observations .
One point in the transit-line was then fixed by the first micrometer distance of the limbs at 3h 7~ 19~ apparent time .
This line was carefully divided into hours and minutes , on the supposition that Venus moves 240~,36 over the Sun 's disk in an hour , according to a calculation I had formerly made from Halley 's Tables .
The place of Venus 's center in the transit-line was then marked to the times of each of the micrometer observations , and from thence the apparent place of her center found , by setting off the quantity of her parallax from the Sun in its proper direction .
About each of the centers so found , a circle is described with the rad28~,6 , her observed semi-diameter .
Blank lines were next drawn through the Sun 's center , and the apparent place of the center of Venus .
On these the red lines were drawn from the Sun 's limb , precisely of such length as we found them by the micrometer ; so that it may be seen at once how far the micrometer measures agree with each other , by observing how much they exceed or fall short of reaching the limb of Venus .
Out of the 18 that were taken , 14 of them correspond so well that I am convinced they may be depended upon .
The 4th which I have set down , and only one other , which will be found omitted , differ something from what they ought to be ; which might easily happen , either from any mistake in noting the time , or in reading the vernier of the micrometer , or not fixing it exactly in the direction of the nearest distance of the limbs ; tho ' great care was taken in this part , by sweeping it constantly round to try the truth of the contacts that were formed .
The measures intended to be taken in chords parallel to the equator , are very near the truth , considering that , in setting the micrometer to that direction , we had only the truth of the polar axis to depend on , which was constructed hastily to answer the purpose of the day , and was not exactly true , as a small mot on of the rack work that raites or depresses the telescope was sometimes necessary to keep the Sun in the field .
Three of these measures , parallel to the equator , agree with each other , and with all the rest of the micrometer observations , on supposing the chord in which they were taken inclined half a degree to the plane of the equator .
The fourth of these measures is still more nearly parallel to the equator , but diverges a little the other way .
These chords are delineated in the * projection , and serve to confirm the other work .
* It was intended also to have confirmed the projection still further , by the observations made of the appulses of the limbs of All the parallaxes of Venus from the Sun were taken from a large projection on a scale of half an inch to one second , and then reduced to the scale of this delineation .
After calculating some of those parallaxes , and finding those given by the projection constantly true to the first decimal place , any further nicety was thought needless .
~~~ The angle of Ventus 's visible way 8 28 27 with the ecliptic , I find The angle of the ecliptic with a parallel of declination at 3h 75 13 decreasing 53~ per hour .
P. M. The latitude of the observatory , as 40 9 56 above laid down Hence the parallaxes were fitted to each of the micrometer observations , as above .
If a computation be made with the 1st micrometer obser~ ~~ vation of the distance of the limbs , we shall find the 5 26 16time of the least distance of the centers of the Sun and Venus , as seen from the earth 's center ; to have been the Sun and center of Venus to the cross-hairs of the equal altitude instrument ; but it was found that so many lines would confuse the figure .
And the micrometer observations answering so well , more were thought needless .
Basides this , no fractions of seconds could be got in the other observations ; though , nevertheless , a good separate projection may be made by them .

In order to find the error of the micrometer ( if any ) , Jupiter 's diameter was measured to the right and to the left ; and Mr. Rittenhouse afterwards took the trouble to measure the diameter of a white painted circle both ways ten times .
This work was performed early in the morning before sun-rise , when the air was still , and free from all tremulous motion ; the result of which , on a mean of those to the right , and a like mean of those to the left , was an error of adjustment for the micrometer of 1~ , 12 to be subtracted ; which was accordingly allowed for in the reduction of all the micrometer measures .
Thus we have given a full and faithful account of our work .
We could have wished to have comprised it in less room .
Had our latitude and longitude been well fixed , as they had been at Philadelphia , by able mathematicians , beforehand , a considerable part of our work might have been saved .
But as it was necessary to show , that such pains have been taken in these material articles , that they may be depended on ; and as we had opportunities portunities of observation , from the goodness of the weather , and other circumstances , which cannot have happened to the generality of observers in many parts of the world , we thought we should be the easier excused by men of science , for the insertion of twenty superfluous things , than the neglect of any thing material in the account of a phenomenon , which will never be observed again by any of the present generation of men .
I am , GENTLEMEN , with great respect , Your most obedient , humble servant , Philadelphis , July 19 , 1769 .
