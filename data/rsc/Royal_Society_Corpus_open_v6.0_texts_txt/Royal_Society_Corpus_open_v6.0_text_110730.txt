A paper was also read , entitled , * ' On a remarkable property of the Diamond .
" By Sir David Brewster , K.H. , D.C.L. , F.R.S.L. , V.P.R.S. Ed. On re-examining the phenomena of parallel bands of light and shade exhibited by reflexion at the plane surface of a diamond , which the author had noticed some years ago , he concludes that they result from the reflexions of the edges of veins or laminse , of which the visible terminations are inclined at different angles , not exceeding two or three seconds , to the general surface .
He gives an account of several analogous facts observable in other crystals , more especially those of carbonate of lime , artificially polished in surfaces inclined to the natural planes of cleavage .
