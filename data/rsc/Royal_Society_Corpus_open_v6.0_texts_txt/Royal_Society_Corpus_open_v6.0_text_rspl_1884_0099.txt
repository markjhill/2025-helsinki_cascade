The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " Magnetisation of Iron .
" By John Hopkinson , M.A. , D.Sc .
, F.R.S. Received March 30 , 1885 .
( Abstract .
) The paper contains an acconnt of the results of experiments which have been made on a considerable number of samples of iron and steel of known composition , including samples of cast iron , malleable cast iron , wrought iron , ordinary steels , manganese , chromium , tungsten , and silicon steels .
The electrical resistance and the magnetic properties are determined in absolute measure .
Amongst the electrical resistances the most noteworthy fact is the very high resistance of cast iron , as much as ten times that of wrought iron .
The fact that manganese steel is almost non-magnetic is verified , and its actual permeability measured .
The action of manganese appears to be to reduce the maximum magnetisation of steel , and in a still greater ratio the residual magnetism , but not to affect the coercive force materially .
It is shown that the observed permeability of manganese steel containing 12 per cent , of manganese would be accounted for by assuming that this alloy consists of a perfectly non-magnetic material , in which are scattered about one-tenth part of isolated particles of pure iron .
Some practical applications of the results are discussed .
