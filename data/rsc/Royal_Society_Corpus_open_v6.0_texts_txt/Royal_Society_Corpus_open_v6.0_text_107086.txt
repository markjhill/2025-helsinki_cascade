AMONGST the various objections urged against , mathematical science , few oppose its evidence and logical accuracy ; and , since its demonstrations have been acknowledged to proceed by a series of the strictest inferences , from the most evident print ciples , the study of abstract science has generally been deemed peculiarly proper to habituate the mind to just reasoning .
But of late , the dissentions of mathematicians have subjected to doubt , even this collateral and intervenient use ; ' for , not only has the mode of applying analysis to physical objects been controverted , but certain parts of the pure mathematics have become the subject of dispute .
Much has been heard of the science of quantity being vitiated with jargon , absurdity , and mystery , and perplexed with paradox and contradiction ; so that , from the very complaints of the patrons of mathematics , its opponents may derive their most potent arguments , and abundant matter for triumlnphant invective .
The introduction of 'impossible quantities , is assigned as a great and primary cause of the evils under whicL mathematical science labours .
During the operation of these quantities , it is said , all just reasoning is suspended , and ' the mind is bewildered by exhibitions that resemble the juggling tricks of mechanical dexterity The arguments that seem to render all operations performed with impossible quantitihs unintelligible , may be included under the following statement .
Algebra is a species of short-hand wnriting ; a language , or system of characters or signs , invented for the purpose of facilitating the comparison and combination of ideas .
Now all demonstration by signs , must ultimately rest on observations made on individual objects ; and all the varieties of the transformation and combination , of signs , except what are arbitrary and conventional , must be regulated byproperties observed to belong to the things of which the signs are the representatives .
Demonstration by signs is shown to be true , by referring to the individual thin .
, gs the signs represent ; and is shown to be general , by remarking that the operation is the same , whateveris the thing signified , or , in other words that the operation is independent of the things signified .
Yet , against this statement , from the very concessions of the matheematicians that have opposed the use of impossible quantities , is ; to be derived a powerful argument , an argument sufficiently satisfactory to the mnind , that operations with impossible quantities are really regulated by the rules of a logic equally just , with the logic of possible quantities .
It i 's conceded , and mentioned as a paradox , that the conclusions obtained by the aid ' of imaginary quantitiesare most true and certain .
Now , , if operations with any characters or signs lead to just conclusions , such operations must be true by virtue of some principle or other ; and the objections against imaginary quantities , ought to be diverted upon the unsatisfactory explanation given of their nature and uses .
It would indeed be a singular para &amp; .xz , or a rare felicity , if truth , not always attained by meditation , should unexpectedly result from unzideal opexrations conducted without principle , purpose , or regularity .
The paradox , that a process in which no idea is introduced conducts to truth , and that operations by unintelligible characters lead to certain and just conclusions , has been expressly treated in a paper presented to the Royal Society .
The ingenious author , confining his enquiry concerning impossible quantities to their use in calculating the values of sines , cosines , &amp;c. has attempted to show , that operations with such quantities are true , on the principle of analogy .
He is of opinion , that , " The operations performed with imaginary chan tacters , though destitute of meaning themselves , are yet notes of reference to others which are significant .
They , point out indirectly a method of demonstrating a certain property of the hyperbola , and then leave us to conclude from analogy , that the same property belongs also to the circle .
All that we are assured of by the imaginary investigation is , that its conclusion may , with all the strictness of mathematical reasoning , be proved of the hyperbola ; but if from thence we would transfer that conclusion to the circle , it must be in consequence of the principle just now mentioned .
The investigation therefore resolves itself ultimately into an argument from analogy ; and , after the strictest examination , will be found without any other claim to the evidence of demonstration .
" By this explana .
tion , the operations of imaginary quantities , before disorderly and confused , assume some appearance of purpose and regularity ; and the assent of the mind , if not compelled by certain proof , is at least solicited by probable arguments .
But , to matheN iro maticians , who , in questionsof abstract science , profess never to rest contented with " ca rational faith and mooral persuasion , " the principle of explanation just adduced must needs be unsatisfictory ; for , whatever extension of meaning be allowed to the term analogy , still this is certain , that a proof by analogy is , inferior to strict demonstration .
What is it that determines the nature of this analogy ?
Or how can its several coincidences , interruptio-ns , andlimitations be ascertained , except by separate and direct investigations of the properties of the circle and hyperbola . ?
If the analogy between the two curves depends on investigation , and is limited thereby , then all operations with imaginary expressions are perfectly nugatory ; since we are not warranted to adopt a single conclusion obtained by their aid , except such conclusion be verified by a distinct and rigorous demonstration .
Theauthor of the principle of analogy allows that it is imperfect and I perceive no sure method of ascertaining the restrictions to which it is subject , except by the forms that result from actual investigation .
To show that the principle of analogy ought to be abandoned , and a more natural and satisfactory one sought for , an argument maybe used , similar to the one employed against those who maintain operations by imaginary symbols to be perfectly unintelliible ' ; that , since arguments have been invented , which , if they do not satisfy , yet afford the mind a glimpse and indistinct perception of the reason why certain processes lead to truth , it may be presumed possible to convert such probable arguments into certain proofs , and to discipline a vague , perilous , and irregular analogy , into a strict , sure , and formal demonstration ; Convinced in my own mind , that there can be neither paradoxes nor mysteries inherent and inexplicable in a system of characters of our own invention , and combined according to rules , the origin and extent of which we can precisely ascertain , I have endeavoured , in the present memoir , to show why certain conclusions obtained through the means of imaginary quantities are necessarily true : to effect this is my prime object ; a subordinate one is , to show that the method founded on imaginary symbols is commodious , and proper to be adopted , because of easy and extensive application .
It has been already observed , that demonstration ultimately depends on observations made on individual objects , and that a conclusion expressed by certain characters and signs , if general , must be true in each particular case that presents itself , on assigning specific values to the signs .
After affixing a signification to the symbols x , + , &amp;c. the product of ( a + b ) and ( c + d ) can be proved equal to ( ac ) + ( ad ) + ( bc ) + ( bd ) ; b if na= b , a can be proved equal - , a , b , c , &amp;c. being the signs of real quantities but nothing can be affirmed concerning the product of ( a +b V.-1 ) , and ( c +d 4/ nor concerns ing the form na= b_ -.-i ; and all that can be meant by the form ( a 4b V-i ) x ( c +d V-i ) is , that the characters are to be combined after the same m anner that the signs of real quantities are ; so that ( a +bV xJ ) X ( c +d VcT ) , and ac + ac VdI+ cbV-1--bd , are two forms equi.s valent to each other , not proved equivalent , but put so , by extending the rule demonstrated for the signs of real quantities to characters that are insignificantt In like manner ( a + b)x can never be proved equal to a+x a/ -1 ab+ &amp;c. it is only an abridged symbol for the series ; there can be no ambiguity in the meaning of ( a + b)x , since it is intended to represent the series which arises from developing ( a + b ) , after the same manner that ( a + b)I is developed .
The symbol V might arise from translating questions of which the statement involved a contradiction of ideas into algebraic language , and reasoning on them , as if they really admitted a solution .
For instance , if it were required to divide the number 12 into two such parts , that their product should equal 3"7 this question in algebraic language would be 12 X -37 ; an absurd statement , since no real number can be assigned to x that verifies it ; but , according to the rules for transposition , the equation 12x -x = 37 , is equivalent-to xi2X+ 36= .
If x were the sign of a real quantity , x.6 , or 6x , would be the square root of x212 X+ 36 ; if therefore ?
:( 6 ) be put for the square root , it is put so by extending the rule proved for real quantities to this case ; and the radical placed over the symbol1 , shows that such extension has been assumed ; hence x6_+V -i is an expression of which the origin is known , being derived from x12 x+ 36 36 1 .
In the present inquiry , it is immaterial how the symbol 1/ _7 originated : J think its origin most probably accounted for thus .
The determination of general rules for the combination of algebraic quantities , -was probably posterior to the actual solution of many problems , effected by particular artifices .
During the solu .
tions , certain similar parcels of characters presented themselves , which it was necessary either to combine or separate ; and , to obtain general rules for their combination and separation , the first algebraists feigned forms similar to what really presented themselves in specific cases:* thus , in questions producing quadratic equations , forms such as x2 7x+ 10 , X+3X0 appeared ; and therefore , to obtain a general rule for the solution of all like forms , x ax z2 b was invented ; and the solution , being made general , was necessarily extended to those cases which admitted no real answer .
When such an extension is assumed , it is always indicated by the symbol -v 1 ; and hence , to know what operations are to be performed with the symbol V a , it is necessary to recur to the quadratic forms from which it is arbitrarily derived .
I -now proceed to show how sines , cosines , &amp;c. may be expressed by means of exponential expressions ; and , for the sake , of perspicuity , I avoid all fluxionary operations , and adhere to a purely algebraical calculus .
To find the form for the developement of ex , let y e= , x ory 1 He -1 +e m , n being any quantity which disappears of itself in the value of y. NTOW l+ e11 I+ it ( en -a ) + ( ea + &amp;c. ( arranging the -terms according to the powers of n ) I+ An + BIn+ Cn + , &amp; C. A+ ( .

&lt; y ) , are perfectly ink telligible by means of their equivalent equations x =a , yx=b_ a , to which they can be immediately reduced .
The tendency of the reform proposed to be introduced into algebra is , it appears to me , to destroy the chief advantages of that art ; its compenndious and exp , -ditious methods of calculation .

To remove all doubt and occasion of cavil , it is to be understood , that ex + e-m means , that the terms of the series which ex A_ I represents , are to be connected with the terms of the series that ex -_ represents , according to the rules obtaining for the addition of real quantities : again , that xVI -x V/ i1 is put equal O , not by bringing xV -i under the predicament of quantity , and making it the subject of arithmetical computation , but by giving to + and their proper signification when used with real quantities , and then they designate reverse operations : again , that X , is equal to x , not because it is true that a quantity multiplied and divided by the same number remains the same , but because .
w7h Imeans , that X is to be combined with vi after the manner that real quantities are in multiplication , and then divided after the manner that real quantities are in division ; and therefore , since the two operations are the reverse of each other , XVX V1x 2 and x must be equivalent expressions .
* To facilitate the solution of the propositions demonstrated by means of imaginary quantities , I previously observe , that , A being any symbol whatever , Ax ( exI/ I+es IeYV -1 and A ex +A ex vA ey , are equivalent ex-* After this manner ought to be interpreted what MACLAURIN and BERN OU TLI have indistinctly expressed , concerning the compensation that ought t ; } take place when real quantities are represented by means of imaginary symbols.-Ba N.

I think it superfluous to give more examples , since the object of this memoir is rather to show the logical justness of a method , than its commodiousness or extent : all other propositions relative to lines drawn in a circle , when expressed by aid of the symbol V ... , the same principle of explanation regulates ; the principle once understood , the operations become mnechanical , require attention , but are attended with no real mental difficulty x v/ I_ X V-x-vI It is inaccurate to call Ii i an imaginary value of the cosine of an arc : the expression expanded is a real one .
By use of the symbol V-i , and of the forms proved to obtain in the combination of real quantities , a mode of notation is obtained , by which we may express sines and cosines , &amp; C. relatively to their arc , If the process by which the foregoing propositions have been established require illustration , I would ask what demonstration is , when the characters employed are signs of ideas , or repreo sentatives of real things- ; and demonstration would be defined to be , a method of showing the agreement of remote ideas by a train of intermediate ideas , each agreeing with that next it ; or , in other words , a method of tracing the connection between certain principles and a conclusion , by a series of intermediate and identical propositions , each proposition being converted into its next , by changing the combination of signs that represent it , into another shown to be equivalent to it .
Exactly according to this plan have the foregoing propositions been demonstrated : the symbol for the sine of x is eXV IiI -XV eYV + e-YVI __ for the cosine of y 's 2 , and the connection was traced between ( e =x ( V ?
ziI ) and e(X +Y)X ILe _ + ?

e(X- ) _x _ , by a series of transformations , each of which was shown to be lawful , by referring to what et &amp;c. was made to represent , and to the nature of the operations directed to be performed by the signs x , + , &amp;c. thus , the transformation of ex Ix ( eY s " + eSY ) into et x ey + e/ x eis lawful , because the same series results whether ey and eYY be first expanded , and then each term of their sum be combined -with ex / IV or whether e* V/ be separately combined with each term of the developements for eY Y and eY A/ and then the resulting terms added together : again , the transformation of ex Ix eY s into e ?
( y + Y ) V is lawful , because the same series results , whether ex and eY i-I be expanded , and then their terms com-o bined according to the rules for the multiplication of quantities or whether e(x + Y ) $be immediately expanded , by writing ( x + y ) V/ -i for x , in the series for el .
The other demonstrations examined will appear conducted on the same principle , which is simple , and of easy and immediate application : hence , although the symbol Vi be beyond the power of arithmetical computation , the operations in which it is introduced are intelligible , and deserve , if any operations do , the name of reasoning .
It is almost superfluous to observe , that if the operations by means of imaginary symbols have appeared to be necessarily true , the arguments founded on the analogy subsisting between the circle and hyperbola must be abandoned , as unsatisfactory .
What has been proved concerning the properties of lines appertaining to a circle , has been so without any mention of the hyperbola ; and I may say , without danger of refutation , that the demonstrations would be strictly true , if such a curve as the hyperbola had never been invented .
Add to this , that imaginary expressions are useful in leading to just conclusions , in investigations purely algebraical .
rfhe chief purpose of this Paper is fulfilled , if it has appeared that the operations with imaginary symbols possess the evidence and rigour of mathematical demonstration whether it is convenient to use imaginary quantities in analyticaltinvestigation , mast be determined on the grounds of abridgment and extensive application .
In the cases that I have considered , imaginary expressions are not , I know , indispensably necessary : they are excluded from each of three different methods for the solution of propolog sitions relative to lines belonging to a circle , given by M. LAGRAVE , by EULER , ( Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum , p. 198 .
) and by BOSSUT .
( Mem. de 1VAcad .

) I am , however , of opinion , that the method of representing sines , cosines , &amp;c. by their abridged algebraical symbols , ( such as is given in this Paper , ) is the most easy and extensive in its applacation .
* It will be consistent with the purpose of the present memoir , to consider some of the expressions which I imagine are alluded to , by those who complain of the abuses , paradoxes , &amp;c. introduced by negative and impossible quantities .
The quany , I which JOHN BERNOUILLI proved to be the circumference of a circle , is merely an abridged symbol , founded on a form proved for real quantities : the sense in which it is to be understood is this , that if in the scries for log .
XI viz , ( X aX ( % Zz ) &amp; C. substituted for x , and the terms multiplied by 4 and divided by %/ 1 the resulting series expresses the circumference of a circle .

I(eb-e b)COS a , ( 2 ) cos. ( a +b 1 ) + Cos. ( a b V.-v -1 ) ( el + e- ) coS .
a , are due to EULER : the sense in which alone they are to be understood is this , that the series which results from substituting ?
M. BoSSUT does not sum any series beyond that of the fourth power of sines and cosines of arcs in arithmetical progression : he contents himself with saying , that the general law for cos.q + COS. n &amp;c. may easily be discovered .
a Jr b s/ -for x , in the series x3 4 .
&amp; cX..2.-3 -1.72.-3.45 proved for the sine of an arc x , is the same as what results from expanding eb , ebb , cos. a , sin. a , &amp;c. and combining the terms after the manner directed by the signs + , x , &amp;c. A like explanation is to be given of the second expression .
If m be an integer , c the semi-circumference , and a= ( 4 C then cos. a= o , and the first expression becomes sin. ( a + bV -T ) 2 ( eb + e~ &amp; b sin. a. According to the explanation I have given , this expression is very perspicuous and intelligible ; but EULER , inattentive to its true meaning , gives it an air of mystery and paradox , when he says that an impossible arc may have a real sine .
The symbol ( V T1f)^ I , EULER proved equal to 0.20787957 , &amp;c. To understand its meaning , we im ust recur to the form from which it was derived : now , according to the definition that has been given of equality between imaginary expressions , itmay be shown that ( a 4 bV/ l)1flrflV1 ==rt2e n2(cos.(mx+n xl.r ) ?

Or the meaning of the symbol may be thus explained , xx is the same as xlog e.ifV/ be put forx I= eV log .
V but it has appeared that log .
Vi is an abridged symbol for ill.4 ; Xhence ( V/ -2)"= e c , or ( V'-)- ' , is an abridged symbol for the series i + , C* 2I+ -c3 I do not pretend to say , that such expressions as the above are likely to occur in investigation , and to be practically useful ; my sole concern is to show , that they are perfectly intelligible , and the necessary consequences of certain assumptions .
The paradoxes and contradictions mutually alleged against each other , by mathematicians engaged in the controversy* concerning the application of logarithms to negative and ilm possible quantities , may be employed as arguments against the use of those quantities in investigation .
The paradoxes and contradictions will quickly disappear , by adopting the same mode of explanation that has been already employed in this paper .
The memoir of EULER is in some parts erroneous , and frequently unsatisfactory .
The use of a mathematical definition is , to deduce from it the properties of the thing defined ; and , whatever definition of logarithms be ' taken , we'either have immediately , or may deduce for the purpose of computation , an expression such as y e ' , in which x is the logarithm of et to the base e ; the developement of ex has been proved to bei +Ax++ Ax3 + &amp; C. I ben = ( I Now the question concerning the logarithms of negative quantities , is a precise form , and freed from its verbal ambi guities , is this ; is the symbol which , substituted for x in the developement of e ; makes y or e =1 , the sign of a real quantity or not . ?
In the expression e,4 x 'is the logarithm of ev , and , by exten_ J~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ , sion , x _V I is to be called the logarithm of ex &lt; ZI Now e-x ?

EULER , certainly too much attached to mere calculation , instead of directly opposing them , sought to divert their force .
D'ALEMJIERT asserted , that the two progressions i , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. -1 , 2 , n3 , &amp;c. might have the same series of logarithms , a , p , qg r , &amp;c. This is true , if -2 means 2x ( i ) , 3x ( i ) , &amp; c , or the progression 1 , 2 , -3 , cc .
is the same as 1x ( -1 ) , 2 ( -i ) , 3 ( i ) , &amp;c. wherein ( -i ) is considered as an unit , or as ( x ) a sign of a real quantity .
But the question is thus evaded ; since 1 , 2 , -3 &amp;c. is brought precisely under the same predicament as i , 2 , 3 , 4 , &amp;c. The only real point of inquiry could be , whether , consistently with the system of logarithms established for positive quantities , the logarithms of negative quantities were real .
A second argument brought by BERNOUILLI andX DCALEMBERT was , thatsin cea-a : aa *(a ) ( -(a ) " *. .

( a)* log .

This proposition , affirmed byD'ALEMBERT to be strictly true , viz. ( a -a a : a ) , was granted to be so by EULER , although it ought to have been denied ; since , thus abstractedly proposed , it is absurd and unintelligible , and impossible to be proved .
If , however , * ( -a ) " be assumed = ( a ) ` , ( )i = HI ( i )4 , then the equality log .

( a)2 becomes intelligible ; since it means that the measure of the ratio between -a ) ' and ( i ) , is equal the measure of the ratio between ( a ) and ( -I )b ; but then this argument becomes the same as the former , and is equally illusory ; for a and 1 are in fact made a and i. If logarithms be defined , the measures of ratios existing between real quantities , then it is absurd to attempt deducing the logarithms of negative quantities from any reason .
ing on the relation that i has to -1 ; since there is no necest sary connection between i and i ; and , independently of certain assumptions , the ratio of 1 -1 is perfectly unintelligible .
Indeed the question admits no other meaning than that I originally assigned it : if a form demonstrated for positive quantities be extended , then certain symbols may be exhibited , which , agreeably to such extension , are called the logarithms of negative quantities .
Other arguments than those I have mentioned , were drawn from the theories of curves and fluxions , not only foreign to the question , which was purely algebraical , but of small weight ; had they been of greater , the inquiry would necessarily have been diverted on the nature of the connection existing between these theories and algebra .
In thiscontroversy , the predominance of the c " Esprit Geometrique " is remarkable ; if , in an inquiry purely mathematical , any ambiguity or paradox presents itself , the most simple and natural method is , to recur to the original notions on which calculation has been founded .
Instead of pursuing this method , the controvertists sought to derive illustration from obscure doctrines , or to discover the latent truth amidst the complex forms and involutions of analysis .
My inquiry concerning impossible quantities , has been confined to their use in representing lines belonging to the circle , and to the necessary truth of the conclusions obtained by their means ; led by the connection of the subjects , I have made a small deviation , to examine the true meaning of certain symbols , and the contradictions said to embarrass the doctrines of logarithms when applied to negative quantities .
The use , however , of impossible quantities has been extended to all parts of analysis .
By their aid are determined , the values of formulas that occur in the science of the motion of fluids , the numerators of partial fractions as ( A xj I+2 ) the developement of forms as ( e ?
r r ' cos. z+ rz ) , and the integration of many differential equations .
If , in these cases , the operation , * By means of impossible quantities , CARDAN 's rule , in the irreducible case , when .
the three roots are real and incommensurable , may be applied .

in some particular cases , the algebraic value may be obtained , , when the serifs that results from adding the terms of the developements of Va+b anaand - &amp; A/ = -I can be summed ; as M. NiCOLE ( Mem. de l'Acad .
1738 , pages 97 , 24{ , ) has shown , who first proved the expression , Va+b V-= +/ a bV s , -J^ when expanded , to be real .
I am of opinion , that CARDAN'S solution , in the irreducible case , cannot be extended so as to obtain the general linear value , or in particular cases the algebraic value , except by operations with impossible quantities ; and that when , by aid of impossj ale quantities , the general , linear value or particular algebraic values are exhibited , such with imaginary symbols are intelligible and just , the only arguiment for their exclusion must be founded on the existence of methods more general and expeditious .
The application of imaginary quantities to the theory of equations , has perhaps been made more extensively than to any other part of analysis .
To consider the propriety of this application on the grounds of perspicuity and conciseness , a long discussion would be necessary .
I may , however , be here permitted merely to state my opinion , that impossible quantities must be employed in the theory of equations , in order to obtain general rules and compendious methods .
The demonstration , of the principal proposition , that every root of an equation is come prised underthe form M+NV 1 , and that consequently every equation of 2X dimensions , is always divisible into n quadratic factors , appearsto me , I confess , deficient in evidence and mathematical rigour .
To establish this proposition , and to prove likewise , that every imaginary expression derived from transcendental operations is always comprised under the form M+N v , ~ is the object of two Memoirs by D'ALEMBERT and EULER .
( Mem. de Berlin , 1746 , 1749 .
) M. FONCENEX , ( Mem. de Turin .
) LAGRANGE , ( Mem , de Berlin , 1771 , 1772 , 1773 , ) LAPLACE , WARING , and ' .
other mathematicians , have directed their inquiries towards the same subject , * values are.necessarily and by strict consequence true , ; and not true because they may .
be verified by a distinct or , more rigorous investigation , nor because the operations have a tacit and implied reference to other more legitimate operations .
None of the demonstrations go farther than to show the possibility of resolving an equation of 2n dimensions into n quadratic factors .
The actual resolution of equations that pass the fourth degree , has not hitherto been executed .
Of the labours of such learned men as those I have mentioned , I speak with the greatest diffidence ; the mere knowledge , however , of the possibility of the resolution of equations , appears to The nature of the subject has obliged me to give this paper , in several of its parts , somewhat of a controversial cast : for having used the freedom of discussion in matters of pure sci- .
ence , an apology is unnecessary ; the memoir of the ingenious -person whose opinion I have formally controverted , I can most sincerely commend for every thing , except the justness of the principle of explanation .
To excuse the prolixity that may appear in the explanation of the operations , and in the proofs of their justness , I wish it to be considered , that it was necessary to examine the notions on which calculation ultimately rests ; to explain the meaning of imaginary symbols , by tracing their derivation ; to establish by separate and independent proofs , rules for the combination of impossible quantities , and not by inference from their similarity to rules for like combinations of real quantities ; and carefully to distinguish between what is proved on evidentprinciples , and what is only consequent from arbitrary asvsumptions .
Mathematical science has been at times embarrassed with -contradictions and paradoxes ; yet they are not to be imputed to imaginary symbols , rather than to any other symbols invented for the purpose of rendering demonstration compendious , and expeditious .
It may ; however , be justly remarked , that me unimportant .
A useful consequence from this possibility of resolution , is said to be the integration of the form ( ; -x ) , P and Qbeiflg rational functions of x ; now , when -i is expressed by a series of fractions , a form as x=+ , ) .
presents X~+ 2 aX ao pesnt itself to be integrated ; but the actual value of the integration cannot be assigned , without knowing what A , B are ; and A , B , cannot be determnined , except a , le , are known .
119 mathematicians , neglecting to exercise mental superintendence , are too prone to trust to mechanical dexterity ; and that some , instead of establishing the truth of conclusions on antecedent reasons , have endeavoured to prop it by imperfect analogies or mere algebraic forms .
On the other hand , there are mathematicians , whose zeal for just reasoning has been alarmed at a verbal absurdity and , from a name improperly applied , or a definition incautiously given , l have been hurried to the precipitate conclusion , that operations with symbols of which the mind can form no idea , must necessarily be doubtful and uning telligible .
*I have endeavoured to establish a logic for impossible quat -n tities ; to fix the meaning of certain ambiguous expressions ; and to reconcile the contradictions in the doctrine of logrithms .
I iv-dulge the hope that what I have said may deter mathematicians fromattempting to found demonstration on so frail and narrow a basis as analogy ; or from reposing in the dangerous notion , that there are either unaccountable paradoxes , or inexplicable mysteries , in .
a system of characters entirely of their own invention .
, It is to be desired , that the charges of paradox and mystery , said to be introduced into algebra by negative awid impossible quantities , should be proposed distinctly , in a precise form , fit to be apprehended and made the subject of discussion .
