" On the relative dynamic value of the Degrees of the Compass ; and on the Cause of the Needle resting in the Magnetic Meridian .
" By Sir Graves C. Haughton , K.H. , M.A. , F.R.S. , Foreign Associate of the Institute of France .
By ascertaining the distances at different azimuths at which a bar magnet placed with its axis directed to the centre of a magnetic compass needle caused the needle to assume the position in which its axis was in the same line with that of the magnet , the author found that these points of distance form a peculiar curve , which was nearest to the centre of the magnet at the east and.west azimuths , and receded from it as it advanced to the north and south ; and was twice the distance from it at the north than at the south azimuths .
From this and other experiments he infers that the value of every degree of the compass is inversely as the square of the length of the ordinate or co-ordinate passing through it , the abscissa being considered as zero ; and that the magnetic needle does not rest in the magnetic meridian in consequence of polar attraction , but is impelled in that direction by the effect of repulsion , from the east or west , and that its natural position is the result of an equilibrium between the eastern and western repulsions .
On the other hand , the return of the needle , when it is placed in the reverse position , that is , when made to deviate 180 ?
from its natural position , is the .
result of an attraction towards the east and west positions ; the force of attraction in that case being quadruple the force of repulsion in the former case .
He is consequently led to the conclusion that the operation of terrestrial magnetism is totally different from that of an artificial magnet , in which latter case the attractive and repulsive forces are exactly equal .
