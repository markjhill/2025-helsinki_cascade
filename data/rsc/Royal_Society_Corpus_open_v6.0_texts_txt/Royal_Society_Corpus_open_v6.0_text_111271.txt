" On the Existence of Multiple Proportion in the quantities of heat , or equivalent alteration of internal space of bodies , caused by definite changes of state as produced by Chemical Combination or otherwise .

( Abstract .
) Gay-Lussac having shown that the combining proportions of gases and vapours are either equal in volume or some multiple of each other , and other chemists , particularly Playfair and Joule , having extended the same law to solids and liquids , it is evident that specific volume of its combining equivalent is characteristic of matter .
But as every substance is composed of matter and space , or of particles with some distance between them , as is shown by expansion and contraction , whenever volume is altered there must be either an addition to or subtraction from the internal space of the body .
This alteration of volume is evident in the case of bodies expanding or contracting by gain or loss of heat ; but in chemical combination , where alteration of internal space must take place also ( as shown by change of temperature , and because specific volume being characteristic of matter , this volume must change when the matter changes , by a substitution of a mixture of two kinds of matter for one ) , in chemical combination , I say , this alteration of internal space is not so plainly demonstrable .
Still , in the change of temperature , we have not only an evidence , but a measure of the change of state of combining bodies .
For , the phenomena of heat being produced by a dual force acting equally in opposite directions , one body cooling or contracting as another becomes heated or expands , it may be taken for granted that whenever heat or expansion is found in one body , the opposite change is occurring in some other .
Now , regarding this proposition as true , it is intended to be proved from the combinations of oxygen that the internal space of a substance is lost and gained in multiple proportion , in the definite changes of state of bodies , such as in the condensation of vapours into liquids , and liquids into solids , and the reverse ; and also in chemical combinations and decompositions ; and therefore that the space as well as the matter of which volume is composed can be only added to or taken away in what is called its combining equivalent .
In order to find whether the heat of chemical combination , which is taken as equivalent to the alteration of internal space , is equally produced by the same substance uniting with others , or if not , if it is given out in multiple proportion , oxygen is made to combine with several other simple bodies , and the alteration of temperature noted .
The method of oxidizing these substances , the details of each process being given in the paper , consisted in dissolving them in some suitable menstruum , -for instance , in sulphuric acid , liquor of potass , and nitric acid .
When the two former are used , water is decomn posed to oxidize the dissolved body ; in the last case , the nitric acid is resolved into oxygen and binoxide of nitrogen , the former of which unites with the substance to be oxidized , the latter escaping .
Other combinations and decompositions at the same time take place ( as detailed in the paper ) , and being taken into account ( decompositions absorbing as much heat as is produced by the combination of the constituents ) , the alteration of temperature by the oxidation alone is arrived at , In this manner eighteen different metals were oxidized , but the heat of oxidation was obtained satisfactorily only with twelve .
Other experimenters ( Favre and Silbermann and Andrews ) have , with a different object in view , found the heat of oxidation of fourteen other substances ; their conclusions are added as being from un .
prejudiced sources , and the result of all the experiments is brought together in a table , in order to see whether the law of multiple proportion exists .
The numbers found by the different experimenters are all calculated to the same standard .
The unit of heat is the amount necessary to raise the temperature of 1000 grains of water 1 ?
Fahr. , and the quantity of the metal oxidized is an equivalent of each , oxygen =1 .
To find whether the law extends to change of state when no chemical combination takes place , the amount of heat given out by the condensation of an equivalent of steam , and by the solidification of an equivalent of water , is given .
The following is the table giving the thermal equivalents of the several substances , the names of the experimenters , and the ratio of proportion , It is to be remarked , that the condensation of steam being in multiple proportion with the other thermal equivalents , the expansion of all other bodies into vapour must be included ; for I showed in the Philosophical Magazine for January 1852 ( page 48 ) , that all bodies expand into vapour in some multiple of their atomic volumes , and their atomic volumes being in ratio also , their expansion or gain of internal space in this definite change must be in multiple proportion .

Note.-I proved in a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for October 1851 , that " the decomposition of a compound body absorbs as much heat as the combination of the elements originally produced .
" I believe I was the first to prove this as a general proposition , and , by so doing , laid the foundation of almost all the thermochemical researches since carried on ; for , as far as I am aware , no process which took decomposition into account was used before my paper was published .
In a paper read to the British Association at Belfast , and published in the Philosophical Magazine for November 1852 , I proved that the intensity of chemical affinity might be measured by the quantity of heat produced by the combination .
As regards the first of these papers , Mr. Joule published in the Philosophical Magazine for June 1852 , a memoir proving exactly the same proposition , but giving me the merit of priority in a preliminary remark .
It is , however , singular that Favre and Silbermann bring forward in 1853 ( Annals de Chimie et Physique , vol. xxxvii .
p. 507 ) the very same experiments to prove the same fact , and give it as their own .
As regards the second paper .
In six months after its publication , Messrs. Favre and Silbermann ( Annals de Chimie et Physique , vol. xxxvii .
p. 484 ) prove the same truth with the same experiments , using exactly the same metals , and give their memoir as producing an original idea .
I notice these coincidences here as being remarkable , and because the propositions contained in the paper referred to are the groundwork of the present experiments , and also with a view to prevent an unconscious repetition on the part of Messrs , Favre and Silbermann .
