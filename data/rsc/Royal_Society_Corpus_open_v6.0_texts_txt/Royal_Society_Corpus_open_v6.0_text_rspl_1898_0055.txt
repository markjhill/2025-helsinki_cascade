The modem populatiot occupying the same districts of Europe as Palaeolithic and Neolith man appear to be taller , but in the case of both south Germany an Prance there appears to be a slight , but sensible , decrease of statui since prehistoric times .
Modern English do not seem to ha\ decreased in stature since the ancient Anglo-Saxons .
In the est mates of stature for the above races , the author differs , in son cases very considerably , from previous writers .

Beyond the range of normal population ( say from 157 t 175 cm .
for $ ) , the line of regression ceases to " be linear .
A attempt is made , such as existing data will allow of , to express tl line of regression by the equation to a curve .
The constants of th curve are determined for measurements of the four chief long bone and the results exhibited in a diagram , from which it is possible 1 deduce the probable stature corresponding to a given length of an long bone by inspection .
The prediction of the stature of dwar !
from the curve obtained from the data of giants shows only 2'25 cn mean error , and must be considered satisfactory .
Application i then made of the results to reconstruct the stature of Bushmei Andamanese , and Akkas .
These give sufficiently good results 1 lead us to believe that a fair estimate can be made of the stature c European neolithic dwarfs . .
The memoir concludes with a table of reconstructed statures an sexual ratios .

In the ' Deutsche Med. Wochenschrift ' for 1894 appeared a contro versy on this subject between Behring and Buchner .
Behrinj maintained that the antagonism was of a chemical nature , and th\#174 ; the antitoxin neutralised the toxin much as an alkali neutralised ai acid .
Buchner , on the other hand , adduced results opposed to thi view , pointing to the interpretation that the action was an indirec one , due to the antitoxin operating in some indirect way through tfcj medium of the cells of the organism .
Since this controversy man ' investigations have been made with the-object of deciding this funds mental point .
At the present time , however , opinion is still divided The Antagonism between Toxins and Antitoxins .
421 ehring , Ehrlich , and Kanthack being principal exponents of the rect chemical view , whilst Buchner , Roux , and Metchnikoff still aintain that the interaction takes place only through the interven-on of some cells in the body .
We will briefly review the more important observations which bear Irectly upon the subject of our paper .
( 1 ) Observations favouring the Interpretation that the Action of Antitoxins is indirect .
Calmette* in 1895 made experiments with the toxin of cobra poison ad its antitoxin , which he had recently succeeded in producing , obra poison is not apparently attenuated by heating its solutions to 8 ' C. for ten minutes .
The antitoxin is , however , completely de-oroyed by this treatment .
Mixtures of cobra poison and antitoxin 'hich produced no symptoms when injected into a rabbit , killed imilar rabbits in a few hours.if after the mixture had remained in ontact for ten minutes it were heated for another ten minutes to 8 ' 0 .
before injecting .
From his experiments Calmette concluded bat the toxin of snake venom does not interact with its antitoxin in itro , but only in corpore , and therefore that its action cannot be xplained as a simple chemical operation between the two .
j Wassermannj " found that the toxin produced by the bacillus pyo-yaneus was not destroyed by boiling , whereas its antitoxin was .
''he amount of toxin and antitoxin which neutralised each other was irst determined by experiment , then the same quantities and propor-ions of these substances were allowed to remain in contact and dter wards heated to boiling .
The animals receiving an injection of his heated mixture died , whereas the controt^nimals which received m equal dose unheated recovered .
From these experiments Wasser-nann concluded that the toxin of pyocyaneus does not interact with ts antitoxin in vitro , but only in corpore , and therefore that it cannot be explained as a simple chemical operation between the two .
I , Rikanorow J discovered that the precipitate formed by the addition if a 1 per cent , solution of cupric acetate was possessed of antitoxic properties and the filtrate not .
A. 1 per cent , solution of cupric acetate does not , however , precipitate the toxin .
Mixtures of the two could thus be separated by the use of this reagent .
Experiments conducted along the lines mentioned in the experiments above led to identical results .

In this case , however , it is the toil which is destroyed at the lower temperature ( 60 ' C. Roux jtf[ Yersin ) , whereas the antitoxic properties still remained after heath the serum to 70 ' C. Mixtures of the two in such proportions as'\gt ; cause no symptoms when injected into a guinea-pig were mai After heating such mixture to a temperature sufficient to destroy tj toxin , the mixture was discovered now to possess antitoxic property which could be titrated against a fresh amount of toxin .
f 2 .
Observations favouring the interpretation that the action is direct .
The view that the operation is a direct one has always receiv ' support from the general truth of the " law of multiples , " on whi indeed the antitoxin notation has been founded .
It is furtfr strengthened by the observations of Kanthack and Ehrlich .
Kanthack , * in 1896 , demonstrated that the influence of cob poison in preventing the coagulation of shed blood , observed 1 Cunningham , was prevented by the previous admixture of some i Calmette s antivenomous serum to the solution of cobra poison .
| Ehrlichf found that if a solution of ricin , be added to defibrinati blood ( p animal ) the corpuscles are precipitated in a clump .
* , ricin solution of the same strength , but containing a little seru from an animal immunised against ricin , failed to produce this resul Within the last few days we have received a short account \lt ; some experiments by Stephens and Meyers , J bearing upon the sam point .
Cobra poison exercises a haemolytic action upon blood ?
vitro .
After admixture of the poison with antivenomous serui this haemolytic action was absent .
The necessary precaution c making the solution of the venom with saline solution approximate !
isotonic with blood serum was taken .
Before relating the results of our own experiments we may poir out one source of fallacy in the conclusions drawn by Wassermam Calmette , Nikanorow , and Marenghi , viz. , that they take no accour of the factor , time , which may be a very important element in an ; possible chemical interaction between toxins and antitoxins .
Ever ; chemical reaction has a certain definite velocity coefficient , and thi rapidity of action under any circumstances where the reacting com pounds are in solution depends upon this coefficient , and also upoi * Demonstrated at meeting of Physiol.

As we shall later show , the experiments quoted by these observers , n easily be repeated and the same results obtained .
Nevertheless -air conclusions are quite unjustified , and by modification of the jtors , time , temperature , and active masses , exactly opposite results a , y also be obtained .
Experimental results obtained by the Authors .
Our experiments have been conducted with the toxin of diphtheria , id one of the constituents of the poison of the Australian tiger sake ( jE oplocephaluscurtus .
) The diphtheria toxin was prepared by cultivating the organisms broth made from well hung beef , after the method of Spronck.* | was filtered through a sound Pasteur-Chamberland filter , and the xin strength of the filtrate determined by injection into a series ?
guinea-pigs .
That with which most of our experiments were mducted , had a minimum lethal dose of 0*12 c.c. per kilogram in 3 hours .
The antitoxins used were Behring 's No. 1 and serum from the asteur Institute , Paris .
The constituent of the venom used was the one which is not istroyed by heating a solution of venom to 90 ' C. This consti-lent resembles most closely , if indeed it be not identical with , the " incipal constituent of cobra poison ; and , as shown by one of us , f almette 's antivenomous serum possesses a small but decided counter-oting action upon it .
This action , though unfortunately of little or 0 practical importance , is sufficient for our present purpose , for in ar experiments we could mix comparatively large quantities of the arum with small fatal doses of the venom in vitro .
Under these reumstances one could easily neutralise the poison .
1 The antitoxin was the antivenomous serum prepared by the Pasteur astitute at Lille , and bore date November , 1896 .
i\ We endeavoured at the outset to determine whether the action of ntitoxins upon toxins were chemical or physiological , by a direct hysical method .
In 1896 one of usj published an account of a aethod of separating substances of large molecular size from those of mailer , in solutions containing both .
This method was simply by ltering through a film of gelatin , supported in the wall of a 'asteur-Chamberland filter .
The filtration was accomplished by a pressure of 50 atmospheres .

Drs. C. J. Martin and T. Cherry A standardised solution of diphtheria toxin was filtered throng such a filter .
The filtrate was found to contain diphtheria toxi .
This filtrate was then tested to ascertain whether it were as toxic* the original solution .
As will be seen from the protocols it somewhat diminished in toxic power ( Protocol I ) .
The antitoxin of diphtheria , as was shown by Brodie , * does xsi pass through such a filter .
When antitoxic serum is filtered throuji gelatin , the whole of the proteids , and together with them all ant toxic virtue , are absent from the filtrate ( Protocol II ) .
As the tosL is not held back by the filter , whereas the antitoxin is , one is provide with a simple physical means of separating them , provided they ha not reacted upon one another .
We mixed a solution of toxin containing eight fatal doses p-kilogram of guinea-pig in each c.c. , with sufficient Behring 's an-toxin to more than completely neutralise all the toxin .
This mixta* was allowed to remain in contact at 30 ' G. for two hours , and thi .
filtered through the gelatin filter .
Varying quantities of tl i filtrate were injected into guinea-pigs up to nearly 4 c.c. per kill -gram of body weight , that is a quantity originally containing fatal doses .
The filtrate was quite innocent .
The guinea-pij# suffered no inconvenience , and gained weight while under observe \gt ; tion in small cages .
The injections produced no local oedema .
If the toxin had remained unaffected beside the antitoxin the i was nothing to prevent it passing through the filter in virtue of i t\lt ; relatively small molecular size .
As , however , it did not do so , v can only conclude that it had entered into some sort of chemicsa relationship with the relatively large molecules of the anti-toxi \gt ; ; during their sojourn together prior to filtration .
Having obtained results so definite , and in apparent contradictio n to those of the authors quoted in the beginning of this paper , v ' next experimented with snake venom in order to repeat Calmette s | observations .
We took a series of rabbits ( Protocol V ) and injected them wit r\gt ; mixtures containing one constituent of the venom of Hoplocsphah ^ curtus and Calmette 's antivenomous serum .
On reference to to 1 protocols of this series of experiments it is seen that 2 c.c. of thu sample of serum was sufficient to counteract an amount of the poiso ; i\lt ; contained in *0002 gram of the dried venom .
This amount killed control rabbits in about eight hours ( Protocol IV ) .
In some of the experiments this amount of venom and serum wa allowed to remain in contact for fifteen minutes at the laboratory | temperature ( 21 ' C. ) and then heated to 68 ' C. for ten minutes $ I destroy the antitoxin .
In Calmette 's experiments the rabbits ft * * Journ. of Path./ 1897 , p. 460 .

425* jected with this heated mixture died , whereas the controls injected ith the mixture which had not been heated lived .
From this he ncluded that the serum and venom were merely existing side by " le , and had not re-acted upon one another .
In our experiments , on e contrary , the rabbits injected with the heated and unheated ixtnres of venom and serum alike lived , nor did any of them suffer om symptoms such as loss of appetite , loss of weight , or diminished mperature .
The only conclusion to be drawn from these experiments is that during the time which elapsed between the mixture of le venom and serum the latter had acted upon the former , so that , ere was no longer a fatal dose of venom present .
The protocols ill show that heating for ten minutes to 68 ' C. has no influence upon le venom .
( P. VI , experiment 4 .
) These results , while they lead to results in entire agreement with lose drawn from the filtration experiments with diphtheria toxin ad antitoxin , are diametrically opposed to the results obtained by almette .
As the experiments are so simple as not to leave any ossibility of experimental error , we turned our attention to any listing difference in the conditions under which Calmette and our-slves worked .
As previously pointed out , Calmette absolutely eglected the possible influence of time , temperature , and the relative roportions of the active masses of the toxin and antitoxin present i his mixture .
Up to the present we have investigated the value of he factors , time , and proportion of active masses , and have shown hat these are most important .
Indeed , by altering either the one or he other we can produce results which , if these factors be neglected , , rould lead to diametrically opposite conclusions .
) The toxin and antitoxin of this venom are both of great molecular ize and complexity .
The former is a deqjbero-albumose and the ttter probably a globulin , * or at any rate its molecular size is of the :\amp ; me order .
A priori one would expect the velocity coefficient of any \#169 ; action between such complex molecules to be a high one , and in ddition , from their great molecular weight , the solution will contain elatively few molecules : so that it is not surprising that any hemical operation in which they are concerned should occupy a very ppreciable time .
| The value of the factors time and influence of proportion of active masses will be best seen in reference to the table below , which is otnpiled from Protocols VII , VIII , IX , and represents the results f twenty-one experiments .
On reading along any horizontal line trill be seen the influence upon the result of the time during which he toxin and antitoxin were allowed to operate upon each other , frith proportion of active masses constant .
On reading any vertical 1 in the influence of varying proportions of active masses with time * Brodie , loc. cit. Drs. C. J. Martin and T. Cherry .

The thick line separates off t ] fatal results from those in which the rabbits lived .
All oth factors were kept constant .
The solutions were mixed in the var ing proportions and stood at laboratory temperature ( 20\#151 ; 23 ' C At stated intervals , by a stop watch , portions were pipetted off , ai the reaction terminated by rapidly raising the temperature to 68 ' I in a water bath .

In our experiments with diphtheria we allowed abundance c time , 2 hours , for the reaction between the toxin and antitoxin t take place .
The surplus of antitoxin was also large , so that tb active masses were considerable and the temperature was favourabb viz. 30 ' C. ( Protocol III ) .
We have not yet determined the it fluence of temperature upon the rapidity of the reaction , but on results so far seem sufficiently conclusive to decide the question an leave no room for doubt that the antagonism between the toxins o diphtheria and snake venom and their relative antitoxin is due t a direct chemical action which takes place between them .
Further that the opposite conclusion come to by Calmette , and presumablj those of Wassermann , Nikanarow , and Marenghi were due to theii disregard of the value of time as a factor in such chemical action .
