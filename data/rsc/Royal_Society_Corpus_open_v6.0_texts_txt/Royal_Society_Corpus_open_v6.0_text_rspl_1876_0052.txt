314 Rev. S. J. Perry on Magnetic [ Nov. 16 , When either of these four radiometers is heated by a hot shade or plunged into hot water , rotation is always produced in the opposite direction to that caused by the light .
On removing the source of heat the motion rapidly stops , and then commences in the opposite direction ( .e .
as it would rotate under the influence of light ) , the rotation continuing as long as the fly is cooling .
Chilling one of these radiometers with ether has the opposite action to exposing it to dark heat .
The vanes of radiometers have also been formed of metal cones , and of cups and cones of plain mica , roasted mica , pith , paper , \amp ; c. ; and they have been used either plain or blacked on one or both surfaces .
These have also been balanced against each other , and against metal plates , cups , and cones .
The results are of considerable interest , but too complicated to explain without great expenditure of time and numerous diagrams .
The broad facts are contained in the above selections from my experiments .
The action of light on the cup-shaped vanes of a radiometer probably requires more experimental investigation before it can be properly understood .
Some of the phenomena may be explained on the assumption that the molecular pressure acts chiefly in a direction normal to the surface of the vanes .
A convex surface would therefore cause greater pressure to be exerted between itself and the bounding surface of glass than wrould a concave surface .
In this wTay the behaviour of the cup-shaped radiometer with both surfaces bright , No. 1035 , can be understood , and perhaps also that of Nos. 1038 and 1039 .
It would not be difficult to test this view experimentally , by placing a small mica screen in the focus of a concave cup where the molecular force should be concentrated .
But it is not easy to see how such an hypothesis can explain the behaviour of No. 1037 , where the action of the bright convex surface more than overcomes the superior absorptive and radiating powder of the concave black surface ; and the explanation entirely fails to account for the powerful attraction which a lighted candle is seen to exert on the concave surfaces in Nos. 1035 , 1037 , and 1039 .

" Magnetic Observations made at Stony hurst College Observatory from April 1870 to March 1876 .
" By the Rev. S. J. Perry , S.J. , F.R.S. Received July 31 , 1876 .
A double series of magnetic observations are being carried on continuously at this Observatory .
The monthly determinations of the absolute elements date from the year 1863 , but the uninterrupted photographic record of the variations of the Declination and of the components of the Intensity w as only commenced in 1867 .
The photographic curves of the Declination and Horizontal Force have all been measured , and are in course of reduction ; and the Vertical-Force curves will soon be taken in hand .
The results of the first seven years ' observations of the Dip and Horizontal Force appeared in the Ihilosophical Transactions for 1871 , and the 1876 .
] Observations made at College .
present paper contains a precisely similar , and therefore comparable , reduction for the following six years of all the elements of terrestrial magnetism .
In the former paper the general result was somewhat at variance with the conclusions arrived at by Sir Edward Sabine from a discussion of the Kew observations ; and hence the necessity for this second paper , to discover whether local influences or mere accidental errors would account for the discrepancies .
The change of the station of observation during the period from 1863 to 1870 introduced a probable source of error into the first Stonyhurst series ; but that uncertainty is now removed , as all the observations since 1868 have been taken in the fixed magnetic hut .
It will be unnecessary here to repeat what was said in the former paper on the subject of the instruments used in the observations , as these have remained unchanged since 1863 .
The only alteration in the observations themselves has been the substitution of weekly in lieu of monthly readings of the Declination from the beginning of the year 1872 .

Rev. S. J. Perry on Magnetic [ Nov. 16 , Prom the above Table we have for the epoch April 1st , 1873 , The mean Horizontal Force =3'6342 , With a secular acceleration of +0-0053 .
Comparing this with results of previous years , we find the secular acceleration to be on the increase , having been only 0-0042 for October 1st , 1866 , and 0-0047 for January 1st , 1870 .
The above value of the secular acceleration is almost identical with that found by Mr. Whipple from a similar discussion of the Kew observations .
With the values given in Table I. we can readily calculate the semiannual inequality .

Stewart , and afterwards by Mr. Whipple , shows no semiannual inequality , whereas the first Kew series gave the value 0-0026 , which is almost double the above number .
The previous series of Stonyhurst observations led to a contrary result ; but considerable uncertainty was attached to those observations on account of the correction for change of observing station , which objection cannot be urged against the present series .

This Table gives the winter period an excess of 1 ' 1 " over that of summer , which agrees well with the mean of the values l'*31 and 0'*80 found by Gen. Sabine and by Mr. Whipple from the Kew observations .
The value obtained by Dr. Stewart for the period 1863 to 1869 is less than any of the above , and the result from the Stonyhurst observations taken during the same period is considerably below that of Dr. Stewart ; but still every series makes the winter number greater than that for the summer .

The Total Force .
We are now in a position to test the semiannual variation of the Total Force , or the Intensity of the earth 's magnetism .
Referring back to Table I. , we find for the summer periods the mean Horizontal Force = 3*6321 , and the mean Dip = 69 ' 30 ' 8 " ; whilst for the winter periods we get 3*6362 and 69 ' 29 ' 35 " .

0 0015 1 1 00119 0-0128 Contrary to the results of the former paper , these figures show a very large excess in the intensity for the winter months , thus strongly confirming the conclusion of the increase of the earth 's magnetic force with the nearer approach of the sun .
The late Kew reductions lead to the same conclusion , but the difference for the seasons is not so large .
The Magnetic Declination .
To complete the reduction of the absolute magnetic elements , I will now subjoin a discussion of the Declination observations , although the Dip and Intensity were alone included in the former paper .
It has been thought advisable not to apply any correction to the observed Declinations , either for disturbances or for diurnal range , especially as the readings were always taken within a short interval from 9 a.m. Table I.\#151 ; Monthly mean values of the Declination .

The weekly readings that are now being taken will , it is hoped , sufficiently reduce the probable error of the monthly means .
Summing up the general results of the observations with respect to the main point at issue , viz. the existence of a semiannual inequality in the magnetic elements , it is satisfactory to find a complete confirmation of the conclusion of Sir E. Sabine , that a nearer approach of the sun in the winter months produces a very sensible increase in all the elements of terrestrial magnetism .

Introduction .
In presenting this communication to the Royal Society I wish to state that it is only an abstract of a more extensive paper on the same subject which I hope to publish shortly , and which contains an account of experiments with nearly seventy substances , most of which were never used before for such an investigation .
I tried also nearly all the liquefied gases , and a considerable time was spent in preparing them for this kind of research , that was often interrupted by fearful explosions .
The invaluable opportunity which Mr. Warren La Rue , F.R.8 .
, granted me some time ago to try the same compounds with his very powerful battery , led to results which I hope the Society will not consider devoid of interest .
I entered on these experiments with the purpose of establishing , if possible , a relation between electrical conductivity and chemical consti-
