81 derived from our standard thermometer , denoted by \#151 ; 196*7 ' .
This would show , therefore , that the temperature coefficient as usually defined is 0*000884 between \#151 ; 35 ' and 0'.* These observations are specially interesting as giving additional proof that in the case of a metal of known purity the variation of resistivity , as the metal is continuously cooled , is such as to indicate that it would in all probability vanish at the absolute zero of temperature .
In the case of mercury , we are able to obtain a metal in a state of almost perfect chemical purity , and which , when continuously cooled , passes into the solid condition under circumstances which are entirely favourable to the prevention of stresses in the interior of the metal , due to cooling .
These measurements , therefore , afford a further confirmation of the law which we have enunciated as a deduction from experimental observations , that the electrical resistivity of a pure metal vanishes at the absolute zero of temperature .

Although considerable attention has been paid to the changes produced in the magnetic properties of iron , particularly its magnetic permeability and hysteresis , at ordinary and at higher temperatures , but little information has been obtained up to the present on the behaviour of iron and steel as regards magnetic properties when cooled to very low temperatures .
By the employment of large quantities of liquid air we have been able to conduct a long series of experiments on this subject , the results of which wre propose here briefly to summarise , leaving for a future communication fuller details and discussion of the results .
The experimental work has consisted in making measurements , chiefly by ballistic galvanometer methods , of the permeability and hysteresis loss in certain samples of iron and steel , taken in the form of rings or cylinders .
The first experiments were concerned with the variation of the magnetic permeability of soft iron under varying magnetic forces , the iron being kept at a constant low temperature , obtained by placing it in liquid air in a state of very quiet ebullition in a vacuum vessel .

On Experiments on Annealed Swedish Iron .
A cylinder of iron was formed by winding up a sheet of Sankey 's best transformer iron ( 'Swedish).* The width of the strip was 4'895 cm .
, the thickness 0-0356 cm .
; three complete layers of the sheet iron were used in forming the core .
The area of cross-section of the side of the cylinder so formed was 0"5229 sq .
cm .
The mean diameter of the cylinder was 3"612 cm .
This cylinder of iron was placed in a clay crucible packed with magnesia , the lid luted on with fire-clay , and the crucible then raised to a bright red heat in a forge , after which it was allowed to cool very slowly .
The iron cylinder was thus carefully annealed out of contact with air or any material containing carbon .
This soft annealed iron ring was then wound over with silk ribbon , and two windings of silk-covered copper wire placed upon it ; the first or primary circuit consisted of 131 turns of No. 26 double silk-covered wire ; the secondary circuit consisted of 112 turns of No. 36 silk-covered copper wire .
The magnetising force to which the ring is subjected when a current is sent through the primary coil is measured by the value of 47r/ 10 x the ampere-turns per unit of length of the mean perimeter of the ring , and this , in the case of the present ring , reduces to the number 14-507 times the ampere current .
The magnetising force in absolute units is therefore very closely given by the number obtained by multiplying the current flowing through the primary coil in amperes by 14"5 .
The resistance of the primary coil at about 15 ' C. was 0"92 ohm , and the resistance of the secondary at the same temperature 8"98 ohms .
The secondary circuit of this ring coil or transformer was then connected through appropriate resistances with a ballistic galvanometer , having a resistance of 18 ohms .
The primary circuit was connected through suitable resistances and a current reverser with a circuit of constant potential .
By these arrangements it was possible to reverse a definite current passing through the primary coils , and by observing the throw produced by the ballistic galvanometer , to calculate the induction in the iron core .
The galvanometer was calibrated by reversing a known current passing through a long solenoid , in the centre of which was placed a secondary coil of known turns and dimensions , which was always kept in series with the secondary coil of the transformer .
In this manner a series of observations was taken with gradually increasing magnetising forces .
Before commencing each series of observations , the ring was carefully demagnetised by passing through the primary coil an alternating current , which was gradually reduced in strength to zero , the ring coil being thus brought into a magnetically neutral condition .

83 series of primary currents was successively passed through the primary coil and reversed , the throw of the ballistic galvanometer being noted in each case .
In the first set of observations the ring was kept at the ordinary temperature of the air , 15 ' C. , and in the second set it was immersed in liquid air , and the following table shows the results , both for the high and for the low temperature observations .
After taking a complete magnetisation curve at the ordinary temperature , the ring was immersed in liquid air , bringing its temperature down to about \#151 ; 185 ' C. , and a complete series of observations taken again in the same manner , previously having first carefully Table I.\#151 ; Magnetisation Curve of Annealed Soft Iron ( Sankey 's Transformer Iron ) .

The ring was then taken out of the liquid air , allowed to warm up again to the ordinary temperature , and another complete set of observations taken at the ordinary temperature .
In this manner a series of eighteen complete sets of observations were taken , about half of them being at lo ' C. and half of them at \#151 ; 185 ' C. In cooling the ring in liquid air , it was found to be important to cool it slowly by holding it some time in the dense gaseous air lying over the liquid air .
If suddenly plunged into liquid air the iron becomes hardened .
It was found that after the first five sets of observations , which were some84 Profs .

On what variable , the annealed iron ring was brought into a completely stable condition , in which the curve of magnetic induction plotted in terms of magnetising force taken at the low temperature was different from that taken at 15 ' 0 .
by a perfectly constant amount , the observations at the low temperature always lying on one curve , and those at the higher temperature always lying closely on the other curve .
In the diagram in fig. 1 the two magnetisation curves are shown , the firm line curve being the magnetisation curve at 15 ' 0 .
, and the dotted curve being the magnetisation curve taken at \#151 ; 185 ' C. in the liquid air .
The figures in Table I are the mean values obtained from the curves plotted from the thirteen sets of closely consistent observations .
These curves show that the permeability of soft annealed iron is reduced when it is cooled to about 200 ' below zero , for the whole range of magnetic forces between zero and 25 C.G.S. units .
The permeability curves for the two states are likewise similarly shown on the same chart .
The maximum permeability for this iron corresponds with a magnetising force of about 2 C.G.S. units ; the maximum permeability at the ordinary temperatures for this iron is 3400 , being reduced to 2700 when the iron is cooled to the temperature of liquid air .
The percentage reduction in permeability becomes less as the magnetising force is increased beyond or reduced below this critical magnetising force .
These experiments were repeated , as above stated , many times very carefully with this ring of annealed soft Swedish iron , and also with a second ring of the same kind , and have invariably shown the same results , viz. , that the permeability of soft annealed iron is decreased by being cooled to this low temperature within the range of magnetising forces from 0 to 25 .
It will be seen that the highest induction reached in the case of this iron is 14,500 C.G.S. units , corresponding to a magnetising force of 25 .
This iron is of very high magnetic quality , and is of the same character as that which is much used for the construction of alternating current transformers in commercial use .
A series of experiments was then made with the same transformer , keeping the magnetising forces constant , but allowing the iron to rise gradually in temperature up from the temperature of liquid air to 15 ' C. In these experiments the transformer was embedded in a mass of paraffin wax with a platinum wire resistance thermometer also embedded in the same mass in close contact with the ring coil .
The paraffin wax encasing the ring coil and thermometer having been cooled down to the temperature of liquid air by immersing it in a large bath of the liquid air , it was then lifted out and placed in a vacuum-jacketed test-tube , so as to heat up with extreme slowness , and a series of observations taken by reversing a constant magnetising force at intervals , and observing at the same instant the temperature of the ring coil as given by the platinum thermometer .

In the next place , we have examined the hysteresis of the same soft iron ring at different temperatures and for different maximum inductions .
These observations were carried out by taking a complete series of hysteresis curves with the ballistic galvanometer , gradually increasing the inductions from zero to 12,000 .
After the complete hysteresis curves were obtained , their areas were carefully integrated with an Amsler planimeter , and the values , reduced so as to express the hysteresis loss in watts per lb. per 100 cycles per second , and these values plotted in terms of the maximum value of the magnetic induction per square centimetre of the iron core corresponding to each particular hysteresis loss .
Nothing would be gained by giving the full details of all the observations by which these hysteresis curves were obtained .
They were exceedingly numerous , and the tedious nature of the ballistic observations made it a matter of prolonged observation to secure the whole series necessary , but the final results are shown in Table III .

the with certain conclusions of Messrs. Laws and Warren ( see ' Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences , ' vol. 30 , p. 490 ) .
These observers made a series of experiments on a material which was practically a very soft steel , and employing a differential watt meter , measured the hysteresis loss in the iron at varying and increasing temperatures up to 600 ' or 700 ' .
They found that the hysteresis loss in this material did not begin to decrease sensibly until about 150 ' C. ; after that it decreased regularly in accordance with the simple linear function of the temperature .
In one experiment which they tried with the same material cooled to \#151 ; 78 ' C. in solid carbonic acid and ether , they found no difference between the hysteresis loss of this soft steel at that temperature and at the ordinary temperatures .
Our results , which have been carried to the much lower temperature of liquid air , indicate that in the case of soft annealed Swedish iron the hysteresis loss is not changed by cooling from ordinary temperatures to the temperature of liquid air .
As we kuow that the hysteresis loss of soft iron decreases when the temperature is increased , from the ordinary experience with transformers in commercial use , the matter that requires further investigation is to discover the temperature at which the hysteresis loss sensibly changes and begins to diminish .
j Experiments on Unannealed Swedish Iron .
We have also carried out a series of experiments of the same character with unannealed iron and steel .
A ring coil was constructed of sheet iron of the same quality as that forming the core of the soft iron transformer above described , but no special pains were taken to anneal the iron , and as it was " hardened " in a magnetic sense by being bent into shape , this difference in quality showed itself in the magnetic observations .
A ring coil was constructed of the following dimensions:\#151 ; The thickness of the strip was 0 031 cm .
, width of the strip P24 cm .
, the ring was formed by 23f layers of this sheet iron wound up closely into the form of a ring .
The outside diameter of this ring was 4 cm .
, the ' inside diameter 2T3 cm .
, the cross-section of the iron in the ring was therefore 0'9032 sq .
cm .
, and the mean perimeter of the ring 9-62 cm .
This iron ring was not annealed in any way , but it was simply wound over with silk ribbon , and then had placed upon it two coils of wire .
The primary coil consisted of 150 turns of No. 26 wire , having a resistance of 0 383 ohm , and the secondary coil consisted of 240 turns of No. 36 wire having a resistance of 8'092 ohms .
As the diameter of cross-section of the ring was not very small compared with the mean diameter of the ring , it was necessary to calculate by a proper integration the mean value of the mean magnetising force in terms Magnetic Permeability , #\lt ; ? .
, of Iron at Loiv Temperatures .
91 of the current passing through the primary coil , and it was found that the mean magnetising force to which the iron was exposed was closely expressed by the value 20-219 , multiplied by the ampere current flowing through the primary coil .
This coil had its secondary circuit connected up to the galvanometer , as above described , and a series of observations were taken with this coil by reversing a constant magnetising current passing through the primary coil , and observing the throw of the ballistic galvanometer connected with the secondary cii'cuit .
The ring coil , together with the platinum thermometer , was embedded , as above described , in a mass of paraffin wax , and the whole mass , after having been cooled down to the temperature of liquid air , was slowly allowed to heat up again .
Observations were taken with two different magnetising forces over the range of temperature from \#151 ; 185 ' C. up to the ordinary temperature , and from the calculated induction in the ring determined for each magnetising force , the permeability was found corresponding to each particular force and temperature .
The results of these observations are given in Table IY , and are delineated in fig. 2 , ' in the form of two curves marked unannealed iron .

The difference , also , between the two materials is very marked 92 Profs .
J. A. Fleming and J. Dewar .
On the at low temperatures .
The soft annealed iron if cooled slowly to \#151 ; 185 ' 0 .
recovers its original permeability when heated up again to ordinary temperatures .
The unannealed iron , however , after cooling to the same low temperature , retains some of its increased permeability when heated up again to 15 ' C. The unannealed iron cannot be taken over the temperature range again and again with the same definite permeability values at each recurrent temperature , as in the case of the soft annealed iron .
The unannealed iron is more or less permanently changed in magnetic character every time it is heated or cooled .
With this transformer , a long series of observations were taken to determine the hysteresis loss corresponding to different inductions when taken at the ordinary temperatures , and the temperature of liquid air .
The hysteresis cycles were taken with the ballistic galvanometer , over wide ranges of maximum induction , the transformer being alternately at the ordinary temperature and in liquid air , but no constant magnetic condition could be obtained .
In one set of observations , at a given maximum induction the hysteresis loss was increased when the transformer was raised in temperature , and for another series of observations at the same induction it was diminished .
It is therefore impossible to make any definite statement with regard to the magnetic hysteresis loss in this unannealed iron ring coil at the two temperatures .
The mere fact of immersing the unannealed iron in the liquid air changes its magnetic qualities to such a degree that it is no longer the same material , magnetically considered , after , as before its immersion .
One curious fact , however , was noticed very soon with regard to unannealed iron , and that is , that if the unannealed iron ring coil has a small magnetising current passed through its primary coil , the secondary coil being connected to the galvanometer , the sudden immersion of this ring coil into liquid air invariably causes a deflection of the ballistic galvanometer , even when the primary magnetising current remains perfectly constant in value , thus showing a sudden and very large increase in the permeability of the unanneaied iron .
Whilst the iron is in the liquid air it retains this increased permeability .
If brought suddenly oixt its permeability again diminishes , but not with equal rapidity .
This is partly accounted for by the fact that the iron is cooled with immense rapidity when it goes into the liquid air , but it heats up again much more slowly when it is brought out .
The definite fact , however , remains , which has been repeatedly observed , that the cooling of this unannealed iron to a low temperature always increases its permeability , as far as we know , no matter whatever may be the magnetising force employed .
One difficulty experienced in dealing with unannealed iron is the fact that in taking it up to the high magnetising forces , and by the process required to remove residual Magnetic Permeability , $c .
, of Iron Low Temperatures .
93 magnetism by the application of an alternating current , the iron is so altered in magnetic qualities that it is impossible to repeat two sets of observations under precicely similar circumstances .
With regard to the unannealed iron , it may be noted that if an ordinary magnetisation curve is taken up to very high magnetisation forces , and the iron then demagnetised by the application of an alternating current gradually reduced , the first magnetisation curve can never be repeated exactly again on applying increasing magnetisation forces , but a curve is obtained which lies slightly inside the first curve , and which indicates that the permeability has been reduced .
The subsequent repetition of this process will give a series ( of curves which occupy different positions , but which do not precisely repeat any of them .
Hence it is impossible to repeat at a constant temperature with this unannealed iron exactly any magnetisation or permeability curve .
In the case of the annealed iron it is quite different .
A. magnetisation curve can be obtained after having carefully de-magnetised the iron , if this magnetisation is pressed up to nearly its limit and the iron then de-magnetised by the application of an alternating and decaying magnetising force , a second magnetisation curve can be obtained on again applying an ascending magnetising force , but it will not coincide exactly with the first curve .
The annealed iron cap , however , be brought back into its original condition by dipping it a few times into liquid air .
Under these conditions , we have been able to repeat as frequently as required the observations with the annealed iron taken at the different temperatures .
In the case of the unannealed iron the changes produced in it by immersing it in the liquid air and by magnetising and demagnetising it , are such as to render it almost impossible to obtain results capable of precise repetition , with respect to the hysteresis loss and permeability for varying magnetising forces .
Experiments with Hardened Iron .
A third set of experiments were taken with a ring coil of the same dimensions as the ring coil made of soft annealed transformer iron first described .
This third coil was constructed of the same sample of Sankey 's transformer sheet iron as the above described soft annealed ring , but it was treated subsequently to its formation in the following manner :\#151 ; A short piece of iron gas-pipe was made red hot in a forge ; the ring coil , having been constructed , was dropped into the red-hot pipe , and the ends of this pipe loosely plugged up with slag wool ; the red-hot pipe was then covered over with cinders , and the mass allowed to cool .
Under these conditions the ring coil was annealed in an atmosphere of carbonic oxide and in contact with hot carbon ; the sheet 94 Profs .
J. A. Fleming and J. Dewar , On the iron was , therefore , under these circumstances , case-hardened , and will he referred to as the hardened iron ring .
Having been formed into a transformer in the above-described manner , a long series of observations were taken with this coil to determine its permeability at different temperatures and with different magnetising forces .
The results of these observations are shown in the Table V below , and are delineated graphically in the curves in fig. 2 , marked Hardened Iron .
The results show in a remarkable manner that the iron so treated undergoes a very considerable increase in magnetic permeability when it is cooled to the temperature of liquid air ; for certain magnetising forces the permeability at the lowest temperature reached may be increased as much as five times .
In this respect , therefore , this iron presents in an exaggerated degree the same qualities found in the unannealed iron .
