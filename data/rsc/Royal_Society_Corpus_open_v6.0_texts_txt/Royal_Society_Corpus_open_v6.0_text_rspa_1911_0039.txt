) During the past 12 months I have had occasion to ascertain the nature of the mineral constituents of an ordinarily turbid atmosphere .
By means of a small portable quartz spectrograph several series of spark spectra were photographed with graduated exposures of 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , and 60 seconds , all on the same plate .
The electrodes in the first series were cadmium , iron , nickel , and copper , a self-induction coil being interposed to eliminate the air spectrum and the short metallic lines .
Several plates taken from only the cadmium electrodes exhibited features of particular interest when minutely examined .
Though the spectra are small , the instrument gives fine definition from the red potassium line about \7665'6 to that of cadmium A.2194'7 .
With Wratten and Wain wright 's panchromatic plates , an exposure of one second renders all the principal lines of cadmium , including W 4800 and 2265 , with 10 seconds all the rays from X 6438 are obtained .
The solar spectrum from b to M is faintly visible at all exposures from 1 to 60 seconds inclusive .
The conspicuous H and K lines seen in the first three exposures have their usual appearance ; but , on the third spectrum , exposed 20 seconds , the K line has , at its exact centre , an extremely narrow sharp black line ; in succeeding exposures this line becomes longer and intensified .
With 40 seconds ' exposure a similar black line is just discernible on H , and it is stronger with 60 seconds .
Other parts of the solar spectrum are overlaid by exceedingly fine dark lines which it was proved do not belong to the cadmium spectrum , but were caused by solid matter in suspension in the atmosphere being vaporised by the spark .
The dark lines on H and K are easily explained by the presence of calcium carbonate in very minute particles of dust suspended in the air .
I have called attention to this in former publications.* It was proved in these experiments that the lines did not originate from impurities in the metallic cadmium , because the same electrodes with longer exposures yielded spectra without any impurity lines , when the sparks were passed in an atmosphere of hydrogen .
It was also found that whether in the open air , or in a quiet room near a window , the most prominent lines of calcium were always present .

On Mineral [ Apr. 4 , A line , rather more refrangible than G , was carefully measured , and proved to he that of calcium , X 4226'9 ; it is the ultimate line of the element in oxyhydrogen flame spectra .
There are two lines just on either side of M ; there is no doubt that these are the calcium lines XX 3737'2 and 3706*3 .
It has been shown by Hartley and Adeney 's wave-length determinations* that the line of cadmium measured by Mascart ( No. 12 ) is a triple line , the components being distinguished by the following letters and wave-lengths:\#151 ; a 3261*2 , / 33252'6 , and 7 3250-5 .
With a self-induction coil the ft line disappears .
On examining plates photographed on three successive days , with exposures varying from 1 to 60 seconds , it was seen that two plates showed only two lines a and 7 .
The third plate showed , at an exposure of one second , an extremely fine and very sharp black line , more refrangible than the other two , which , by very careful measurements , was proved to be the ultimate line of copper , X 3274 .
With five seconds ' exposure this and all other succeeding spectra on the plate showed another line less refrangible than the cadmium group , which was proved to be the penultimate line of copper , X 3247'7 .
A comparison of the plates of spectra showed that with the same exposures on each succeeding day the five lines of calcium and the two lines of copper became stronger ; in other words , the increased strength of the lines showed that the outside air became more dusty .
This was seen to be actually the case , under the conditions of a dry atmosphere and a hot sun continuing for six or seven days in the month of May .
To ascertain the origin of the copper was an enquiry attended with some difficulty , the quantity diffused in the atmosphere of the city being comparatively large .
Copper has been proved to be a constituent of coal ashes , and of the flue-dust from gasworks and chemical works , of soot , and of dust from the clouds in hail , snow , and sleet.f These sources , however , contain other constituents , notably lead , nickel , and iron .
The constant traffic of tram-cars and motor-cars in the street raised dust , which caused an increased haziness of the atmosphere day by day , and corresponding increase in the number and intensity of the calcium lines in the spectra .
While making these observations , the prevalence of copper in the dust was accounted for by the repeated flashes on the overhead cable , which is in the centre of a wide street ( St. Stephen 's Green ) at a distance of 54 feet from the * 'Phil .

The condensation of the vapour of copper after each discharge must yield a dust of extreme tenuity such as could not arise from mechanical action , such as scraping or abrasion of the solid metal .
The lines identified from their proximity to , or coincidence with , solar lines , are as follows ; the wave-lengths of calcium are taken from Eder and Valenta 's spark lines :\#151 ; X X Near G 4308 4226-9 Calcium .

Near M 3727 3737-21 3706-2 Calcium .
Near Q 3284-7 3274-01 3247-7 I Copper .
Of seven plates of spectra photographed in the months of April and May two were very carefully measured with the micrometer .
Twenty-two lines were positively identified with those of elements known to be contained in atmospheric dust .
The lines are principally the ultimate lines of the respective elements .

274 On some Mineral Constituents of a Dusty Atmosphere .
Spectra were photographed from portions of the same cadmium electrodes , six months later , in a part of the college as far removed from the frontage as possible , close to a large garden , and with no street thoroughfare within 100 yards .
There had been heavy rain , which had washed out much of the dust from the air .
Not withstanding , the wave-length measurements of two feeble strange lines identified them with copper , and the five calcium lines were very distinct .
Spectra were photographed from cadmium electrodes in hydrogen with exposures of one , two , three , and four minutes ; cadmium in air exposed one minute .
The spectrum taken in the hydrogen atmosphere , and exposed minutes , Avas in all respects of similar intensity to that taken in air in minute , except beyond \ 2418'5 , where the continuous rays between the lines commenced to fade away .
The spectra taken in hydrogen showed no trace whatever of the lines of either copper or calcium , and many other feeble lines were entirely absent which undoubtedly are representative of the other constituents of atmospheric dust .
It is thus proved , absolutely , that .
the copper and calcium were the constituents of dust diffused through the atmosphere of the city .
Determinations of the weight of material necessary to give the lines of these spectra in the manner described , and with such short exposures , have been completed .
From the loss of weight of the dry electrodes by the passage of the spark during successive intervals of 10 minutes , the weight of metallic calcium volatilised in one minute , and in one second , was calculated .
The number of spark discharges per second was accurately determined , and likewise the number of discharges necessary to render the lines of calcium , as photographed from atmospheric dust , with an exposure of 60 seconds .
Similarly with copper , the number of discharges necessary to render the ultimate line and the two lines respectively , as measured on plates exposed to atmospheric dust for one second and for five seconds , was ascertained , and the weight of copper volatilised at each spark discharge was accurately determined .
It was found that , in order to render the five principal lines in the spectrum of calcium , the weight of the metal passing between the electrodes in 60 seconds was from 00001 to 0-00014 mgrm .
, or , as calcium carbonate , from 0-00025 to 0-00035 mgrm .
Similarly , the quantity of copper which passed between the electrodes in one second was from 0-0005 to 0-0007 mgrm .
, and in five seconds from 0-001 to 0-0014 mgrm .
These quantities yield the spectra photographed , and the proportion of copper in the dust thus appears to be 10 times as great as that of the calcium .
Both the calcium and copper reactions in the spark are more delicate than On the Absolute Measurement of Light .
the sodium test by the yellow flame , or even by the photography of the ultimate lines of sodium in the oxyhydrogen flame and spark .
Metallic sodium renders no lines with one spark when photographed , and with five sparks the lines X 3301*1 and X 3302*5 are both stronger than the yellow lines ( mean X 5893*2 ) .
These lines do not appear on any of the cadmium plates .
The reactions of lead , manganese , and magnesium in the spark are much more sensitive than those of sodium , calcium , or copper .
For instance , 0*00003 mgrm .
of manganese is volatilised by one spark discharge , and yields a spectrum with the following ultimate group of lines : 2949*3 , 2939*4 , and 2933*1 .
As no atmosphere is free from dust , and that of cities is particularly dusty , these mineral constituents must be regarded as possible reagents in cases where there is evidence that very minute quantities of basic substances can initiate chemical reactions and isodynamic changes , such as have generally been considered as spontaneous , and in all cases where a solution in contact with air is liable to be affected .

) The measurement of the intensity of a source of light is , it is well known , a somewhat unsatisfactory process .
The eye cannot estimate light intensity ; it can only tell when the illumination of two adjacent surfaces is equal .
If , for example , we desire to measure the intensity of a metal filament lamp , we compare it with a Hefner lamp and say that the intensities are inversely as the squares of the distances from the photometer head , when equal illumination is obtained .
In strictness , however , this method is applicable only when the colours of the two sources , or more accurately when the distribution of energy in the spectra of the two sources , is exactly the same ; for the relative luminosity of the different colours of a spectrum varies with the intensity of that spectrum .
