" By Major Sabine , R.A. , V.P.R.S. , in a letter to Baron von Hum ?
boldt , For .
Mem. R.S. , dated Oct. 24th , 1839 .
These letters relate to communications which Professor Lloyd and Major Sabine have had , conformably to a resolution of the Council of the Royal Society , with the scientific authorities at G ottingcn , Berlin , and St. Petersburg , respecting the organization of a simultaneous system of magnetical observations .
It* appears , from these letters , that the system proposed by the Royal Society is viewed with general interest and approbation ; and nineteen stations are cnumerated at which there is reason to expect that magnetical observatories , acting in concert , on that system , will be established .
