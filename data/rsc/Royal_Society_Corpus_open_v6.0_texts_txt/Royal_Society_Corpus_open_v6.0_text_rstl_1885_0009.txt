Many of the poisonous alkaloids give no distinctive chemical reactions by which they can be identified , and in certain cases the means of recognising them are restricted to observations on their crystalline form and physiological action .
Some of the alkaloids have never been crystallised , and even such as are usually obtained in crystals are not always recognisable , because their shape is not invariably a well-marked or characteristic feature ; moreover the form and grouping of crystals is occasionally modified by such reactions or treatment as may be necessary in the extraction of an organic base .
Small admixtures of foreign substances also modify crystalline character , and not infrequently cause a crystalline substance to become amorphous .

) can be placed upon the mere appearance of crystals ; they must be submitted to recrystallisation by sublimation or some other process .
The physiological action of certain alkaloids of an extremely deadly character is remarkable enough to prove a means of identifying the substance when the effect on the human subject is under observation ; but it is to some extent capable of being modified by the extent of the dose , the administration of other drugs , or the idiosyncracy of the patient .
These facts are well known , and are generally made use of by the counsel for the defence in medico-legal cases .
When the identification of an alkaloid is a necessary part of the evidence of the administration of poison , experiments of a physiological character have necessarily to be made on the lower animals .
It has been objected that the action of drugs on creatures of a smaller size and different organisation may be , and , in certain cases , indeed is , unlike that produced in the human organism , and comparative experiments are necessary in which the suspected substance is compared with authentic specimens before its identity can be established .
But in such comparative experiments an element of uncertainty is introduced , because various preparations supposed to be the same alkaloid may differ in physiological action to such an extent that reasonable doubts may be entertained as to whether they consist of the same substance or , indeed , of one substance only .
The whole subject of the modification of alkaloids by the reagents used in their extraction , variations in their crystalline character and in their physiological action , can be well illustrated by reference to the researches of Dr. C. It .
A. Wright on the various preparations known as aconitine .
The evidence given at the trial of George Henry Lamson , a surgeon , at the Central Criminal Court in 1882 , for poisoning with aconitine , conferred greatly increased importance upon any method of absolute physical measurement which might be substituted for the ordinary tests in the identification of the dangerous alkaloids .
Almost all active alkaloids have a complex chemical constitution , and every complex molecule in which carbon is in a certain state of condensation has a definite absorption spectrum in the ultra-violet if not in the visible region .
In most cases the absorption curve is peculiar and often strikingly characteristic , and only minute quantities of material are actually required for obtaining measurements of spectra from which such curves may be plotted .
The interest that attaches to an examination of the absorption spectra of the alkaloids is not alone the fact that a means of recognising , detecting , and estimating , such substances may be devised , but still more that we may learn something of their chemical constitution .
The experimental details .
The method of examination employed was that described in the Phil. Trans. , Vol. 170 , p. 257 , 1879 , but the spectroscope was the short focussed instrument employed for photographing the spectra published in the 'Journal of the Chemical Society , ' vol. xli .
, p. 84 .
ABSORPTION SPECTRA OP THE ALKALOIDS .
Several modifications were introduced with the object of gaining accuracy and reducing the amount of labour entailed by a large series of observations .
1st .
The solutions were as far as possible made up to the same strength , and cells of definite thickness were employed in series as 5 millims. , 4 millims. , 3 millims. , 2 millims. , and 1 millim. This obviated the necessity for repeatedly diluting the solutions , and so greatly facilitated the work ; while it diminished the possibility of errors , especially in the descriptions of the spectra .
2nd .
The measurements were all reduced to wave-lengths , and the absorption curves were plotted accordingly .
As the curves have been made continuous the necessity for shading has been avoided .
3rd .
While the absorption curves serve for the comparison of one alkaloid with another , as a ready means of distinguishing them and of estimating the quantity present in a solution , a very careful description of the spectra from which the curves were drawn has been furnished , so that no essential details have been omitted such as were found to be imperfectly represented by the drawings .
4th .
The rays intended to give a suitable spectrum were obtained from metallic points , which , for the purpose , are superior to all others .
In previous researches , electrodes of cadmium or of nickel alloyed with a small quantity of copper , in certain cases metallic indium and iron have been used .
None of these are quite satisfactory .
The cadmium and indium lines are not sufficiently close together or numerous , the wave-lengths of the iron and nickel lines had not been determined when these experiments were in progress ; moreover , they were deemed unsuitable because there is too great a difference between the intensity of the lines in different parts of the spectrum , so that deceptive results are obtained when feeble absorptions occur .
The electrodes I prefer to all others are cadmium , tin , and lead ; the lines of tin and lead are numerous and well distributed throughout the whole spectrum ; they are distinctive in character , and therefore easily recognisable , which is not the case with the iron and nickel lines .
The cadmium lines preponderate in intensity , hut the emissive power of the cadmium is purposely reduced by diminishing the quantity of that metal in the spark .
Thus I take for one electrode an alloy of tin with 25 per cent , of cadmium , for the other an alloy of lead with the same proportion of cadmium .
When the two are used as opposite electrodes a spark spectrum is obtained every line in which can be easily recognised ; the tin lines are on one side , and stretch half-way across ; the lead are on the other side ; while the cadmium contained in both electrodes causes the lines of that metal to stretch across from point to point .
A somewhat longer exposure than usual fills the intervals between the lines with a weaker continuous spectrum .
The period was three minutes .
The extent of the continuous rays is always noted in the descriptions of the absorption spectra .
To secure well-defined spectra the photographs were taken with the solutions placed in front of the slit , and the rays were concentrated by a condensing lens of two inches diameter and three inches focal length .
Method of determining the wave-lengths .
It was usual to take a series of five or six photographs of each solution on one plate and thus the spectra represent the rays transmitted by 1,2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or more millimetres of the absorbent liquid .
The wave-lengths referred to are derived from those given in the Phil. Trans. , Yol .
175 , p. 63 , 1884 , for cadmium , tin , and lead The scale numbers in hundredths of an inch are arbitrary , and quite different from those given beside the wave-lengths in the paper quoted ; they were actually read off from photographs of the electrodes by means of an ivory scale , the end of which coincided with the end of the glass plate .
The scale originally used was a photograph of the spectrum of the electrodes with divisions etched on the glass , the gelatine film being scraped off just below the lines to admit of the glass being etched .
The divisions were hundredths of an inch , and every fifth line was distinguished by the corresponding wave-length being written on the back of the plate opposite to the longer line .
The figures , however , are too small , and , otherwise , from the transparency of the glass difficult to read when applied to the face of another photograph .
It was found more satisfactory to apply an ivory scale with a bevelled edge , divided as aforesaid , so that- the scale numbers arbitrarily fixed first for the cadmium lines are read off on all the other lines .
The scale is held in position by a pair of wooden spring clips .
Supposing an absorption hand occurs near the line 120 ( A.= 3245\5 ) , then 120 on the scale is brought over this line on the photograph ; if it he seen to extend to 240 or thereabouts ( \=2593 ) , the reading on the scale is brought up to this line , and a more exact measurement is made .
If the adjustment is not further from the correct number than y^th of an inch , it is sometimes not worth while to alter it ; but whenever it is necessary to make accurate measurements , the scale is capable of easy and perfect adjustment to any part of the spectrum .
For the purpose of converting the scale measurements into wave-lengths and their reciprocals , two curves have been drawn on one sheet of paper .
The scale numbers , wave-lengths , and oscillation frequencies of the fiducial lines employed for the interpolation curves are stated on p. 475 .
Fractions of a tenth-metre have been omitted as being unnecessary in dealing with absorption spectra .
On the diagrams the scale of wave-lengths is reduced to millionths of a millimetre .

The mode of proceeding after a series of photographs had been taken was , after measuring , to record and reduce the measurements to wave-lengths .
The numbers obtained were then laid down on suitably ruled paper for the absorption curve to be plotted .
It was then generally found necessary to execute a further series of photographs , and sometimes two or three series of the absorptions caused by more dilute or stronger solutions , in order to obtain the maximum and minimum effect of the absorbent suostance as well as the coefficients of absorption for all intermediate wave-lengths .
The curves drawn are continuous , so that the necessity for shading is obviated ; the unshaded diagrams are not such true representations of the photographs , but these less exact diagrams are supplemented by very careful and accurate descriptions .
Authentic specimens of alkaloids and other substances in a state of great purity were for the most part obtained from the chemists by whom they were prepared , namely , Messrs. T. and H. Smith and Son , of Edinburgh , Dr. C. R. A. Wright , and Mr. David Howard .

2573 1 Continuous 2747 Very weak 2746 to 2614 Weak to 2547 This solution , which had been prepared with dilute alcohol ( proof spirit ) , was kept two years to ascertain whether it would undergo any change likely to make an alteration in its spectrum .
About 20 cub. centims. were contained in a bottle holding 50 cub. centims. , it was freely exposed to air in this manner , by occasional removals of the stopper , in order to subject it to the conditions which might affect an ordinary pharmaceutical preparation .
It yielded the same spectrum before and after this period of keeping .
In order to test whether violent chemical treatment might affect the spectrum , it was boiled with concentrated sulphuric acid for fifteen minutes , till all the alcohol was expelled ; it was then diluted with a known volume of water and again examined , but it was found quite unaltered .
It was not subjected to treatment with alkalies , though it is known that it may be thus converted into benzoic acid and a new base .
If the treatment with sulphuric acid is sufficiently prolonged it equally effects this transformation , and there is less liability to darkening of the solution by the formation of resinous products than by saponification with alkaline solutions .
The liquid should then show the absorption band characteristic of benzoic acid .

Unfortunately , no exact measurements of this spectrum can be given , but the diagram which was made at the time when that of the previous sample of aconitine was drawn , was precisely the same , hence it may be inferred that the measurements were the same .
It is as well to mention here that the whole of this work was executed in 1882 , some of it even at an earlier date , and curves were plotted according to the method described in the paper in the Phil. Trans. , Yol .

Curves have been drawn of these .
Morson 's preparation , the crystals of which were one and even two millimetres in length , was found to absorb the rays at two points , the two absorptions being equally strong .
The measurements and descriptions of the transmitted spectra are here given , together with the curves .
It is noticeable that the most active aconitines are those with strongest absorption bands ; and of the commercial samples scarcely two yield the same absorption spectra .
The variations in the curves indicate that not only may there be considerable differences in their composition , but also in their chemical constitution .

2544 Should there appear to be any discrepancy between the measurements of absorption bands seen in the spectra of strong and weak solutions of the same substance which might be expected to give the same readings on the scale , they may be accounted for by the fact that two series of photographs were taken by different persons and the measurements made and recorded by different observers , the later observations being made after the lapse of several months .
In no case have the differences between any two sets of measurements been sufficiently great to affect the curves .

Three solutions of oxynarcotine were examined , this solution , which was kept for some time after the notes written below had been taken , yielded a spectrum from which the curve was drawn .
It was found however that the liquid had undergone great change , so a second solution was made which yielded the dotted curve when quite fresh .

Having recently examined the spectra transmitted by pyridine , piperidine , quinoline , tetrahydroquinoline , and the hydrochlorides of these bases , it has been found that the absorption band of pyridine does not appear in the spectrum transmitted by piperidine , and that quinoline and jbetra-hydroquinoline exhibit selective absorption very strongly , the curves differing from each other and from those of their hydrochlorides .
Observations made on simple bases differ from those made on substitution products in this way that the bases are the more diactinic , while addition products are more diactinic than the bases .
Summary .
Many alkaloids are capable of saponification , the products of the reaction are a new base and an organic acid which is frequently of the aromatic series .
The acid is not invariably of the aromatic series , otherwise its presence would probably be evident in the absorption spectrum of the alkaloids .
Xh\#169 ; re are , However two conditions under which an aromatic derivative would certainly not affect the spectrum in a characteristic manner , and these are , when the acid is a hydrogenised body like hydrophthalic acid , or when the basic portion of the molecule has so powerfully absorbed the rays that the band of selective absorption is obscured .
The spectrum of narceine is undoubtedly of this character , and so likewise is that of oxynarcotine .
In order to comment upon the nature of the various absorption spectra described , it will be advantageous to refer briefly to what is at present known concerning the constitution of some of the alkaloids .
Alkaloids may be divided into two groups : those which exhibit spectra with absorption bands ; and ( b ) those which transmit continuous spectra .
Alkaloids and derivatives exhibiting spectra with absorption bands .
Aconitine Pseudaconitine Japaconitine Morphine Narcotine Codeine Thebaine Papaverine Oxynarcotine Apomorphine-hydrochloride T etra-acetyl-morph in Di-acetyl-codeine Quinine Quinine-sulphate Cinchonine-sulphate Quinidine-sulphate Cinchonidine-sulphate Veratrine Piperine Brucine Strychnine Alkaloids yielding continuous spectra .
Narceine Solamine Aconitine ( foreign ) Hyoscyamine Cevadine Digitaline Atropine Picrotoxine Nicotine Caffeine The properties of the aconitines .
By saponifying the aconitines with acids , alkalies , or even with water at a high temperature under pressure , aconitine , japaconitine , and picraconitine yield benzoic acid and a new base , while pseudaconitine furnishes di-methyl-protocatechuic a-cid It was thought probable that by the action of bromine on the alkaloids substitution would occur in the benzene nucleus , and a definite absorption of a pronounced character would result .
This was however not the case , probably because the alkaloids were altogether altered , for after treatment they exhibited no absorption bands .
In comparing the diagrams it is interesting to note the difference between pseudaconitine and the other aconitine bases , it evidently possesses a nucleus with a similar constitution , but the acid residue which is different modifies the absorp tion curve .
ABSORPTION SPECTRA OF THE ALKALOIDS .
It has been shown by the researches of Dr. C. R. A. Wrtght that the aconitines all yield apo-derivatives with such facility that to obtain the bases free therefrom is not an easy matter , and further they undergo saponification by acids and alkalies , very readily yielding an inert base in each case .
Hence different preparations yield different absorption curves .
The aconitine and japaconitine of Dr. Wright have practically the same absorption spectrum and yield similar curves , but that of japaconitine is just what we might expect from a body with a nucleus of a similar constitution but twice the molecular weight of aconitine , namely , a much greater absorptive power .
It has been shown that japaconitine has such a difference , for it is in fact a sesqui-apo-aconitine .
* The English aconitine of Messrs. T. and H. Smith and Co. appears to be a modified form of japaconitine , and it is possible that the modification of tlqe spectrum curve is in part due to an admixture of another body .
Foreign aconitine is doubtless an entirely different substance , since it yields no absorption bands , and it is known to be comparatively inactive physiologically .
On two separate occasions it was found necessary to estimate the strength of solutions of aconitine , and this was in each case successfully accomplished by taking a series of photographs and constructing a curve therefrom .
That the results so obtained were correct was proved by a discovery of some missing notes giving particulars of the preparation of the solutions .
The constitution of the cinchona bases .
The examination of these bases was made by me five years ago , and although there were no means of obtaining accurate measurements of wave-lengths of the absorbed rays at that time , owing to the requisite data being wanting , yet some idea of the constitution of quinine and cinchonine was derived from a comparison of the absorption bands seen in the spectra of the substances themselves and of their derivatives and decomposition products .
The bands in the case of quinine and cinchonine extend into a region of less refrangibility than the absorption caused by pyridine , at the same time the position of the band agrees with that of quinoline .
In one of a series of papers contributed to the ' Transactions of the Chemical Society/ vol. xli .
, p. 45 ( " Researches on the Relation of the Molecular Structure of Carbon Compounds to their Absorption Spectra."\#151 ; Part VI .
) , I remarked that the quinine spectrum was probably due to the conjugation of four pyridine or two quinoline nuclei .
Since then , several researches on the cinchona alkaloids have extended our knowledge , and formulae have been proposed for quinine and for * Vide the structural formulae in the papers by Weight and Luff , and Wright and Menke , J. Chem. Soc. , vol. xxxiii .
, p. 173 ; vol. xxxv .

cinchonine by Wischnegradsky , Wejdel , Kcenigs .
and Skraup , in all of which a more or less modified quinoline nucleus plays a part .
Spectrum observations cannot at present decide upon the respective merits of their formulae .
The constitution of the opium bases .
It is easy to see that the opium bases , morphine , codeine , and their derivatives , apomorphine-hydrochloride , di-acetyl-codeine , and tetra-acetyl-morphine , all have a similarly constituted nucleus .
This nucleus is a benzene or a pyridene derivative , as shown by the absorption band , extending from about wave-length 3000 to 2600 ; the effect of alkyl and acetyl substitutions upon the curve of absorption is well exemplified by codeine , and the acetylated derivatives of codeine and morphine .
In apomorphine-hydrochloride the intensity of the general absorption is greatly increased , but the position of the band is but little altered , as it lies within wavelengths above mentioned .
In the greatly increased length of the curve of thebaine , we have evidence which is not in harmony with the comparatively simple formula C19H21N03 .
The substances narceine , narcotine , and oxynarcotine are all considered to be derivatives of hemipinic acid ( Wright and Beckett , J. Chem. Soc. , vol. xxviii .
, p. 629 , and vol. xxix .
, p. 461 ) , the relationship between the substances being expressed by the following formulae :\#151 ; Hemipinic acid .

CH3 O.CHg From these expressions it may be seen that the same benzenoid grouping is common to all , and the narcotine and oxynarcotine stand to each other in the relationship of aldehyde and acid as far as this grouping is concerned .
In attempting to trace a connexion between the absorption spectra and the formula ?
given above , one is met by a difficulty caused by the large number of oxygen atoms in the molecules , and particularly in those portions which have hitherto yielded no clue to their constitution .
The difficulty is due to the fact that carboxyl and COH groups on side-chains , or as forming a portion of the substituted benzene nuclei exhibit great absorptive power .
The occurrence of several oxidised radicals may cause the following variations in spectra : ( a ) , the absorption bands become so widened as to extend into the region of rays affected by naphthalene , quinoline , and their derivatives ; ( 6 ) or the absorption is so powerful that it extends to rays less refrangible than ABSORPTION SPECTRA OF THE ALKALOIDS .
those in which the band is situated , and continues so far down the curve that the selective absorption is not made manifest .
Narceine appears to be a good example of this ; its absorptive power is very great , extending into the region of such low refrangibility as wave-length 3000 when 1 millim. of liquid is examined containing only YoVo of substance , so that no band is visible .
In the case of narcotine and oxynarcotine it is difficult to arrive at any conclusion , but , from the extension of their absorption bands , it is probable that the portion of the molecule which has a constitution hitherto undetermined is the principal cause of the absorption .
In the case of apomorphine the loss of water appears to cause two molecules of morphine to coalesce , the result being that the band does not suffer displacement to any great extent ; it still absorbs rays of approximately the same wave-length , but the band appears far down the curve , or , in other words , the intensity of the absorption , is increased .
The remarks on narceine are also applicable to papaverine in every particular .
Cevadine .
Cevadine yields on saponification a new base , provisionally called cevine and cevadic or methyl-crotonic acid ; its formula therefore as shown by Wright and Luff ( J. Chem. .Soc .
, vol. xxxiii .
, p. 351 ) is the following :\#151 ; ( C-7H\#171 ; n'6)\lt ; ( o.C0.C(CH3)=CJ-Ij Veratrine .
Veratrine [ ( C^H^NC^)\#151 ; O.CO .
C6H3(0.CH3)2 ] when saponified decomposes into a new base and di-methyl-protocatechuic acid .
Its curve greatly resembles that of codeine and morphine with their derivatives { ibid. , p. 355 ) , and is distinctly different m character to that of cevadine , as the latter shows no absorption band .
At the present time , however , no inference is to be drawn from this , for we have no knowledge of the constitution of the basic portion of the molecule which is the major part in veratrine .
Brucine and Strychnine .
The absorption curves of brucine and strychnine are interesting , the former being essentially different from the latter , as it extends into a much less refrangible portion of the spectrum .
It will be observed that the brucine shows two absorption bands , the second , however , is very like that of strychnine , so much so indeed as to cast suspicion upon the purity of the specimen of brucine examined .
This , however , cannot be questioned .

3 x The constitution of piperine .
According to researches of A. W. Hofmann ( Berl .
Berichte , vol. 12 , p. 984 ) and of Kcenigs ( idem , p. 2341 ) piperine has a constitution somewhat similar to that of atropine , that is to say , it is a derivative of a hydrogenised pyridine and of piperie acid , which is a benzene derivative , thus:\#151 ; Pyridine .
Piperidine .

OH Unlike atropine , piperine shows a very powerful absorption and a persistent absorption band extending from wave-length 3600 to 2740 .
The constitution of nicotine .
According to Wischnegradsky ( Ber .
13 , p. 2315 , 1880 ) , nicotine is an alkyl derivative of a di-hydro-pyridine in which the hydrogen united to the nitrogen is fC H replaced by ethyl , and the second hydrogen is replaced by allyl , thus :\#151 ; C5H4-j .\#174 ; \#174 ; .
L IN 02-0-5 The spectrum is quite in accordance with such a constitution , as it yields no absorption bands .
The constitution of atropine .
The constitution of atropine is that of tropine and tropic acid , less a molecule of water , thus :\#151 ; C5H7(C3H4.OH)N.CH3 Tropine C6H6.CHjCH2-OH ] .
Tropic acid 6 6 l CO. OH / F C17HfflNO( Atropine According to Ladenbtjrg tropine is probably an ethylene derivative and a hydroABSORPTION SPECTRA OP THE ALKALOIDS .
genised addition-product of methyl-pyridine .
A pyridine nucleus hydrogenised would yield no absorption band and would be very diactinic .
In tropic acid we have a substance capable of manifesting the benzene nucleus by giving a banded spectrum ; if however it be modified by hydrogenising , this property disappears .
As atropine not only exhibits no absorption band , and is , moreover , a remarkably diactinic substance , it is highly probable that both the pyridine and benzene residues are hydrogenised .
( Compare hyoscyamine and piperine .
) Hyoscyamine is isomeric with atropine ; on treatment with baryta water it yields tropine and tropic acid .
Like atropine it is remarkably diactinic , layers of solutions 20 millims. in thickness , which contained one part of the substance in 200 of alcohol , transmitted all rays in the case of atropine to wave-length 2700 , and of hyoscyamine to wave-length 2740 .
Caffeine , or methyltheobromine , C8H10N4O2+H2O , has been shown to have the constitution of a tri-methyl-xanthine .
According to Emil Fischer its structure is represented thus:\#151 ; ch3n-ch I I CO CN .
CH .
I I )\gt ; C0 ch3n-c=n There are no reasons for believing that such a body would yield an absorption band , indeed there is much evidence to lead one to think that it would not .
We may therefore say that its supposed constitution is in accordance with its absorption spectrum .
Pyridine , quinoline and derivatives .
The absorption band characteristic of pyridine is strongest between wave-lengths 2700 and 2300 , with diminished intensity it extends from 2570 to 2400 .
It appears highly probable that this substance enters into the constitution of morphia and some other of the opium bases .
As was predicted piperidine shows no absorption band , but still , like the terpenes , it possesses considerable absorptive power , which is exerted on the more refrangible rays , extending continuously to wave-length 2420 .
The absorption spectra of two specimens of quinoline yield curves which are precisely similar .
The band of absorption is strongest between wave-lengths 3170 and 2600 , continuing with diminished intensity it lies between 2980 and 2830 .
There is m addition a remarkable narrow band of absorption which is very well defined , it lies between 3085 and 3039 , and continues with but slightly diminished intensity between 3078 and 3039 .
Quinoline hydrochloride yields a spectrum differing from that of the base inasmuch 3x2 as it exhibits two absorption bands lying between ( 1 ) 3320 and 2740 , ( 2 ) 2418 and 2199 .
Tetra-hydro-quinoline is a more diactinic substance than quinoline , it is characterised by two absorption bands\#151 ; ( 1 ) between 3180 and 2750 , and continuing to 2870 ; ( 2 ) between 2700 and 2300 , extending further to between 2650 and 2370 .
Substances , such as any of the natural alkaloids , which may be derived from di-hydroquinoline or tetra-hydroquinoline , by replacement of the hydrogens by other elements or radicals in such a manner as to have the nucleus of the compound unchanged , must be expected to exhibit absorption bands .
Strychnine.\#151 ; Strychnine appears to be a derivative of pyridine .
Brucine.\#151 ; The substance brucine is most .
probably a derivative of tetra-hydroquinoline , or an addition product of quinoline of the same character , since there is a remarkable similarity between the curves of the two substances .
I cannot close this paper without acknowledging indebtedness to the great skill and care that my assistant Mr. W. It .
Barnett has bestowed on these later observations .
Conclusions .
The conclusions to be drawn from this investigation are the following :\#151 ; 1 .
The absorption spectra offer a ready and valuable means of ascertaining the purity of preparations of the alkaloids and particularly of establishing their identity .
The quantity of some of the alkaloids present in a solution may be estimated by means of the absorption curves .
The difference in character of the various specimens known as aconitines may be recognised ; thus the comparatively harmless base known as foreign aconitine may be distinguished from those of great physiological activity by its transmission of a continuous spectrum , while the three active specimens of aconitine are distinguished from one another by their characteristic absorption curves .
That each of the three active aconitine bases are substances with a different constitution is a conclusion confirmed by optical examination .
The purity of quinine and absence of any admixture of cinchonine can be readily determined , by reason of the latter substance being much less diactinic than the former , but for the same reason quinine cannot be directly estimated in a mixture of the two bodies .
Drugs of such potency as aconitine , morphine , quinine , strychnine , \amp ; c. , which ought to be prescribed only when of absolute purity , should be submitted to spectroscopic examination , so that their exact nature and degree of purity may be guaranteed .
2 .
In comparing the spectra of substances of similar constitution it is observed that such as are derived from bases by the substitution of an alkyl radical for hydrogen , or of an acid radical for hydroxyl , the curve is not altered in character , but may vary in length when equal weights are examined .
ABSORPTION SPECTRA OP THE ALKALOIDS .
This is explained by the absorption bands being caused by the compactness of structure of the nucleus of the molecule , and that equal weights are not molecular weights , so that by substituting the hydrogens of the nucleus by radicals which exert no selective absorption , the result is a reduction in the absorptive power of a given weight of the substance .
Examples are afforded by morphine and codeine ( methyl-morphine ) , diacetyl-codeine and tetra-acetyl morphine .
3 .
Bases which contain oxydised radicals , as hydroxyl , methoxyl , and carboxyl , increase in absorptive power in proportion to the amount of oxygen they contain .
This is exemplified by papaverine , narceine , narcotine , and oxynarcotine .
The apo-derivatives are less diactinic than the parent bases .
Examples are apo-morphine and pseudaconitine .
