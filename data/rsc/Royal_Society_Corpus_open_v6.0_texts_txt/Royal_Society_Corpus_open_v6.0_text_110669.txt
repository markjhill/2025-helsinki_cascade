A paper was read , entitled " Observations on the Blood-corpuscles of certain species of the Genus Cervus .
" By George Gulliver , Esq. , F.R.S. , Assistant Surgeon to the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards .
The author has found that the blood of the Muntjac* , the Porcinef , and the Mcxican Deer J , contains , together with corpuscles of the ordinary circular form , a still larger number of particles of less regular shape ; some curved and gibbous in the middle , and acutely pointed at the ends , with a concave and convex margin , like a crescent ; others approaching more nearly to segments of a circle ; some shaped like a comma , being obtuse at one end and terminated by a pointed curve at the other ; others having an acute projection of the convex part , so as to constitute a triangular , or even quadrangular outline ; some having the figure of the head of a lance ; while a few presented a double or sigmoid flexure , as if they had been twisted half round at the middle .
Like the ordinary blood-discs , these pe ?
culiar corpuscles are deprived of their colouring matter by water ; but with only a small quantity of water they quickly swell out , and assume an oval or circular figure , forming long bead-like strings by the approximation of their edges .
In saline solutions they become rather smaller , but presve their figure tolerably well .
In an appendix , the author gives an account of his observations of the blood-corpuscles of a new species of Deer inhabiting the mount ?
ains of Pcrsia , of which a sj)ecimen has been lately received by the Zoological Society .
Many of these corpusclcs presented the singular forms above described .
