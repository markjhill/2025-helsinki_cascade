" Note on an irregularity in the Height of the Barometer , of which the argument is the Declination of the Moon .
" By Sir John William Lubbock , Bart. , V.P. and Treas .
R.S. In the Companion to the British Almanac for 1839 , the author inserted some results which were obtained with a view of ascertain ?
ing the influence of the moon on the barometer and on the dewpoint .
Mr. Luke Howard 's researches on this subject having recalled his attention to that paper , he found that some of the results he had given appeared to indicate that the moon 's position in decli ?
nation influences the barometer .
In order to render this more manifest , he combines in the present paper all the observations he gave in the Companion to the British Almanac in three categories .
These observations correspond to different angular distances of the moon from the sun , or times of transit ; but as the inequality of the ocean , of which the argument is the moon 's declination , is independent , or very nearly so , of the time of the moon 's transit , it is probable that so also is that in the height of the barometer .
In this case we may with propriety combine in the same category observations which correspond to similar declinations , although to different times of transit .
The results stated by the author seem to indicate an ele ?
vation of nearly one-tenth of an inch for 17 degrees of declination .
