Catalogue of Nebulcc and Clusters of Stars .
By Sir JOHN FREDERICK WILLIAM HERSCHEL , Bart. , F.B.S. Received October 16 , -Read November 19 , 1863 .
Introduction .
THE study of the Nebulae has , within the last quarter of a century , attracted much more of the attention of observers than heretofore-as well on account of the singularity of the phenomena presented by many of these objects , as in consequence of the increased optical power of the telescopes which the skill and industry of modern inventors and artists have placed within their reach .
The brighter nebulae cannot be viewed to any advantage , and the fainter cannot be seen at all , except by the aid of telescopes of large aperture ; and , thanks to the exertions of Lord ROSSE , Mr. LASSELL , Messrs. NASMYTH and DE LA : RUE in England , and Messrs. STEINHEIL , FOUCAULT , and PORRO in Germany and France , as regards reflecting telescopes , and to those of FRAUNHOFER , MERZ , CAUCHOIX , CLARKE , COOK , SECRETAN , Ross , and DALLMEYER as regards refractors ; instruments of abundantly sufficient optical capacity not only to repeat and verify the earlier observations , but to disclose new and more interesting features in many cases , have now come into the hands of many observers , both professional astronomers and amateurs , and may be had by any one who is willing to incur a cost which may be considered moderate when it is remembered that instruments of similar dimensions and goodness could not be obtained fifty years ago at any price .
In consequence we find a continually increasing attention directed to this department of astronomy .
Not to insist on the observations of the Earl of RossE and Mr. LASSELL with their transcendent reflectors , we find a systematic examination and review of them undertaken by M. D'ARREST in the year 1855 , by the aid of a refractor of 6-feet focal length and 41 inches aperture in the Leipzig Observatory , whose results , consisting in the carefully determined places , by repeated observations , of about 230 nebulie , were published in 1856 , in a work entitled " c Resultate aus Beobachtungen der Nebelflecken und Sternhaufen " ( Erst Reihe , Leipzig ) .
This review has since been carried on by the same excellent astronomer , with the great refractor by MERZ of 11 inches in aperture and 16-feet focus , erected in the year 1861 at the Royal Observa tory of Copenhagen .
Again , from the Observatory of the Collegio Romano , under the direction of Signor SECCOHI , have emanated many valuable observations , and from that at Harvard College , Cambridge , U.S. , under the late and present Professors BOND , some of the most striking pictorial representations of particular nebule which we possess .
Neither ought a short but very valuable memoir by the late Jt MASON , printed in the 7th volume of the Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , to be passed in silence ; containing as it does a very elaborate and minute examination , and some excellent delineations of several highly interesting nebulae , particularly those in the great nebulous region of Cygnus .
To M. AUWERs also we owe many accurate and valuable observations , besides a Catalogue comprising the whole series of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL'S nebulae arranged in order of right ascension and reduced to a common epoch , of which more hereafter .
Should the efforts which are now making to procure for the University of Melbourne in Australia a reflector of the first magnitude prove , as is to be hoped , successful , it is understood that one of the principal uses to which it will be devoted will be the examination and exact delineation of the numerous and wonderful objects of this class which the southern he6misphere presents .
These circumstances , but more especially the last-mentioned , render it extremely desirable to have presented in one work , without the necessity of turning over many volumes , a general catalogue of all the nebulae and clusters of stars actually known , both northern and southern , arranged in order of right ascension and reduced to a common and sufficiently advanced epoch which may serve as a general index to them , and enable an observer at once to turn his instrument on any one of them , as well as to put it in his power immediately to ascertain whether any object of this nature which he may encounter in his observations is new , or should be set down as one previously observed .
For want of such a general catalogue , in fact , a great many nebulae have been , from time to time , in the 'Astronomische Nachrichten ' and elsewhere , introduced to the world as new discoveries , which have since been identified with nebule already described and well known .
Many a supposed comet , too , would have been recognized at once as a nebula , had such a general catalogue been at hand , and much valuable time been thus saved to their observers in looking out for them again .
Besides these there are other considerations which have weighed with me in undertaking the task of compiling such a general catalogue .
Having , in the course of my own observations , received the greatest possible assistance from the possession of a Manuscript Catalogue of all the nebulae and clusters discovered by my Father , brought to the common epoch 1800'0 , and arranged in zones of 1 ?
in breadth in polar distance , by his sister the late Miss CAROLINA L. HERSCHEL , it seemed to me nothing less than a debt of gratitude , not merely to acknowledge that assistance , but to avail myself still further of it to complete the list of his nebulae by supplying from that catalogue the places of all those nebulae among them which had escaped my own observation ( a very numerous list ) , and by inserting from it all those places of nebulae observed by myself which were deficient in either element ( of R.A. or P.D. ) , or in which I had reason to apprehend 2 greater errors than those which probably affected her results .
This I have accordingly done , But , to do it effectually , and at the same time to effect a thoroughly correct identification of the objects in my catalogues with those of the older series , involved , as , a necessary preliminary step , the reduction to 1830.0 of the whole of her catalogue , an operation in which I received the assistance of my sons ; the computations being executed for each nebula in duplicate and checked by myself , and which , taken leisurely , zone by zone , as time and circumstance permitted , proved less onerous and wearisome than might have been expected .
The Catalogue thus reduced to the same epoch as my own , afforded the means of detecting and rectifying a great many errors of nomenclature in the latter .
And it was in the course of this part of the inquiry , in which many cases of considerable intricacy and difficulty occurred ( as will be evident on a perusal of the notes appended to this Catalogue ) , and in which it became necessary to recur both to the original sweeps and to a series of registered extracts from them ( the nature of which will be more distinctly stated hereafter ) , that I learned fully to appretiate the skill , diligence , and accuracy which that indefatigable lady brought to bear on a task which only the most boundless devotion could have induced her to undertake or enabled her to accomplish .
Arrived at this stage--that is to say , the mean results of all the observations in my own Catalogues taken , and all the deficient or imperfectly observed nebulae in my Father 's list supplied , as above stated , and the whole arranged , not in zones , but in general order of right ascension , -it then became necessary , in order to produce a work available for future observation , to bring the whole up to a still more advanced epoch .
The work required for this purpose , calling no , longer for any discussion , or collation of the original observations or registers , but being one of simple arithmetical computation from a definite formula the Royal Society , at my application , very liberally undertook to supply , from the funds at their annual disposal , the amount necessary to procure its execution by an experienced computer ( Mr. KERSCiKER , one of the occasional computists for the Royal Observatory of Greenwich ) .
, This work the Astronomer Royal most obligingly offered to superintend , affording at the same time his advice as to the general principle on which the computation should be conducted .
The plan suggested by him and adopted in effect was this .
Each object in the Catalogue was first roughly brought up to the year 1880 by the application of approximate precessions in R.A. and P , D. The places so obtained were then employed to compute the exact precessions in both by the usual formule , with coefficients for the year 1880'0 , viz. Precession in R.A.= 3s072 +1-337 .
sin R.A. cotan P.D. Precession in P.D.= 20"'06 cos R.A. And the precessions , so calculated , were then used to bring up the places from 1830 to 18650 , the epoch of the Catalogue ; so that , the places being given for 1860 and the precessions for twenty years in advance , the application of those precessions to those places shall give dependable places for any year up to the year 1930 , at which time the small error : in excess or defect of the true precession consequent on using the fifty years ' B2 3 antecedent place of the object will be exactly compensated by the further change of place in the same direction in the subsequent fifty .
Two cases of excessive proximity to the poles , northern and southern , viz. those of the nebulae Nos. 2043 and 1652 of the present Catalogue , are excepted , the precessions changing so rapidly , and with so much deviation from uniformity , that a rigorous computation , at least in R.A. , will always be necessary .
In the case of No. 2043 , the effect of precession in the thirty years from 1830 to 1860 has been to change the R.A. from 211 32m to 10h 8m .
This computation was completed , and a fair copy of the resulting places , arranged de novo in their order of R.A. for 1860 , forwarded to me on the 6th of February last ( 1863 ) .
The nomenclature of the objects having in the interim been settled satisfactorily by myself , and a description of each nebula , from a careful comparison of all the descriptions given , prepared , it remained only to fill in the columns left blank for these and the other necessary particulars , and to complete the Catalogue by the insertion in their proper places of the places and descriptions of all such other nebulae , non-observed by either my Father or myself , similarly reduced , of which I could gather any accounts .
These will be found enumerated further on in the " Explanation and arrangement of the Catalogue .
" On the 23rd of February last , while engaged in this work , I received , by the kindness of the Astronomer Royal , a copy of the important work of M. AUWERS before alluded to , entitled " WILLIAM HERSCHEL'S Verzeichnissen von Nebelflecken und Sternhaufen , bearbeitet von ARTHUR AUWERS .
K6nigsberg , 1862 , " of whose existence this was my first notice .
It contains a complete and most elaborate reduction to 1830 , from the observed differences in R.A. and P.D. with known stars , recorded in the Philosophical Transactions , of all the nebulae and clusters in my Father 's three Catalogues ; together with a separate catalogue of all those collected by MESSIER from his own observations , or those of MECHAIN and others ( 101 in number ) , similarly reduced ; another of LACAILLE'S southern nebulae , and one of 50 " new nebule , " comprising nearly all those observed by other astronomers ( Lord ROSSE excepted ) in this hemisphere-all brought up to the same epoch .
It may be readily supposed that I lost no time in comparing my own previous work with this of M. AUWERS ; the places of which having been obtained by the aid of far better and more dependable catalogues of stars , to give the true positions of the zeropoints or determining stars in the differential observations , as well as of more exact precessions , and doubtless , a much more systematic process of treatment , would be entitled , observationfor observation , to be considered as representing the original sweeps more faithfully than could be expected from my own preparatory catalogue .
On the other hand , however , the Zone Catalogue from which that was derived possessed the advantage of having been deduced , not from a single difference of R.A. and P.D. between each nebula and a single determining star , but from all the observations of each nebula ; often in many different sweeps , and in the same sweep often from more than one star ; thus eliminating , no doubt , a great deal of casual error .
In that catalogue , too , as in my own catalogues of 1833 and that of the southern nebulae , the individual results of each observation , or , to speak more exactly , of each differential comparison , is separately recorded , so that any suspiciously large deviation from the mean of all may be at once noticed and traced to its origin in the sweeping books .
My reduction was of course based on the means of all these ( rejecting such as were obviously and grossly faulty ) , and might therefore , pro tanto , be regarded as of superior authority .
This consideration , joined to that before adduced , decided me to retain those places in the present Catalogue which haA been derived from this source , except in a few instances ( specified in the notes ) when it proved , by careful examination of the causes of discordance , that actual mistakes had been committed .
And I must not omit to add that the comparison so instituted with M. AUWERs 's results has led me to the detection of several grave errors in my own work which would certainly have otherwise escaped notice ( and in some cases have caused the loss of future observations by missetting the telescope ) , and whose rectification has added materially to its value .
On the other hand , as no human work is perfect , I have been led to notice some errors in M. AUWERS'S work itself , which are set down in a list of errata and corrigenda at the end of this Catalogue ; and besides , a good many cases in which , owing to mistakes in the printed catalogue in the volumes of the Philosophical Transactions ( many of which stood corrected in MS .
in the margin of the copy of those Transactions in my possession , and many more have been silently detected and rectified by Miss C. H. in her subsequent computations ) , his calculations have been founded on erroneous data , and have therefore led him to assign erroneous places to the objects so affected .
Thus on every account the result has been what may be considered a complete expurgation of both our catalogues .
It remains for me to say a few words on the way in which the reduction to 1860 and the calculation of the precessions have been performed by Mr. KERSCHNER , the computist employed by the Astronomer Royal for that purpose .
The whole work has been executed on printed forms , which being preserved may at any time be referred to .
Since error in computation , however practised the computer , and however checked , is always possible , and occasional error of copying , especially when the order of the entries has to be rearranged is absolutely unavoidable , I considered it incumbent on me to recalculate , seriatim from my original MS .
Catalogue for 1830 , and taking for granted the precessions set down in the fair copy , for 1880 , the places both in R.A. and P.D. of every object included in the Catalogue ; keeping an eye meanwhile to the precessions themselves , and their signs , to seize the least indication of error in that quarter .
It would have been too laborious to recompute these .
As for the precessions in P.D. , their regular progression of itself ensures their correctness , as far at least as the integer seconds and the first decimal place .
A pretty considerable number of errors ( most of them of little moment ) was thus detected and corrected-not more , however , than might reasonably be expected in the work of the most expert computist in so extensive a work , consisting of between nine and ten thousand computed entries ( taking both elements ) , and traceable moreover in many instances to obvious misreading , and in some to actual misentry on my part , of figures in the original MS .
, which but for this further examination would also have escaped notice altogether .
The correction of these and the other errors already spoken of necessitated , in a great 5 mwy instances , ai change in the order of R.A. , and a consequent erasure and interlineation in the MS .
The introduction , too , of the other nebulae ( those of M. AUWERS'S catalogue of " nove , " those communicated to me for insertion by M. D'ARREST , and those noticed by Lord ROSSE in his memoir of 1861 , amounting altogether to 433 objects ) necessitated many more interlineations , often occurring very inconveniently , two or three together , in a way to disfigure the MS .
considerably .
Unfortunately , too , in the MS .
itself the column headed " No. in the Catalogue , " which I had intended to have been left blank till all the rest of the work was completed , had been filled in by the transcriber with a series of numbers in regular progression , from 1 to 4629 , the actual number of lines of which it then consisted .
This made it necessary to renumber the whole ab initio in red ink , striking out the former numbers , and thus producing a still more unsightly appearance .
Under these circumstances , I debated whether or not to recopy the whole .
But , to say nothing of the sacrifice of time ( since I could have entrusted it to no other hand ) , I believe it impossible to copy so voluminous a mass of figures and abbreviated writing without numerous errors .
And being satisfied , from the repeated and careful revision it has undergone , of its present correctness , and equally so that with ordinary care on the part of the compositor ( should the Council of the Royal Society decide on printing it ) no mistake can arise from any of the alterations and interlineations it contains , I have decided in favour of presenting it as it stands , with the exception of two sheets which it was absolutely necessary to recopy owing to the extreme closeness of the interlineations , the smallness of the writing , and the transpositions needed .
These have each been twice carefully read with the original .
In presenting to the Royal Society this , Catalogue , it will be accompanied by the following series of records and documents which it may become desirable hereafter to refer to in elucidation of any point which may arise respecting the history or reduction of such of the objects as occur in my Father 's classes and numbers printed in the Philosophical Transactions , viz.1st .
A series of " register sheets , " in which are entered up all the observations of each nebula or cluster copied verbatim from the sweeps , the nebulae , &amp;c. being arranged in the order of their dates of discovery .
These are the " register sheets " referred to in the notes on this Catalogue , and cited by their general ( i. e. current ) number , as H , 1 ; H , 2 ; ... H , 2508 .
2nd .
A similar set of register sheets of all the observations of each of MESSIER'S nebulae , arranged according to MESSIER'S numbers .
3rd .
A general index of the 2508 nebulae in classes and numbers , to find the " general number " of each to facilitate reference to the register sheets .
( This index was drawn up by myself .
) 4th .
An index list of the same nebulae , &amp;c. arranged according to the " general number , " to find the class and number of each .
5th .
A more complete ditto ditto , containing also the rough approximate R.A. and P.D. of each object for 1800 , and the determining stars as in the Philosophical Transactions .
6th .
A catalogue in zones of P.D. of all the said nebulae and clusters arranged in each 6 aone in rder of , ARE .A , and reduced to the year 1800 by Mis C. HER E , exhibiting the reduced result of each separate observation of each nebula together with the determining star or stars in each case , and the differences of R.A. and P.D. from such star , with references to the current number of the sweep in which the observation is contained .
7th .
The original sweeps withco a the 20 t reflectoratlough in wh the nebul were observed , contained in three small quarto and four folio voliees of MS .
All these manuscripts , with exception of the index No. 3 , are in the original handwritings of my Father and his Sister , in most cases easily distinguishable , in some others not so readily .
The Zone Catalogue No. 6 is entirely the autograph of the latter .
Explanation and arrangement of the Catalogue .
The Catalogue is arranged in twelve columns , of which the first contains the general or current number in order from 1 up to 5063 , the total number of objects comprised , including six supplementary ones , whose insertion in their proper order in .
A. would have involved altering all the numbering both of the cataloue and the annotations , &amp;c. , and would have proved a source of confusion and unavoidable error .
Nevertheless , to prevent their ing overlooked by any observer who may consult these catalogue for the purpose of a general review of the nebule , or for the verification of a new one , their numbers are interpolated into the general series so as to catch the eye , and a reference made to the supplementary catalogue in each case in the column of descriptions .
Column 2 contains the numbers of those nebulae of which observations are given in my two former catalogues , and those of the two nubeul the onumbers from 1 to 2307 inclusive being from that in Philosophical Transactions 1833 , and from 2308 to 4021 from my ape observations .
Where a number in this column is enclosed in hooks thus [ ] , it is taken from the Catalogue of Objects in the Nubecula minor in pp. 153 to 155 of that work .
Where in parentheses thus ( from those in the Nubecula major , pp. 156 to 163 .
Column 3 contains the classes and numbers of nebulae as given by my Father in his three Catalogues in the Philosophical Transactions for 1786 , 1789 , and 1802 .
One only is omitted , viz. V. 35 .
It is an immense diffused nebulosity , extending from 5h 27 " to 51 42m in R.A. , and from 98 ? ?
6 ' to 87 ? ?
43 ' in P.D. A special list of these great diffusions of nebula is given by M. AUWERS in p. 42 of the work above cited .
Column 4 contains references to other authorities , and gives either the name of the first discoverer of the nebula , or a reference to the particular list or catalogue of nebulae which has been taken as the authority for the place set down .
The principal of these are -1st .
The list of " new nebulae " ( Verzeichniss never Nebelflecke ) , in pp. 73 to 76 of the work of M. AUWERS already cited .
These are referred to in the following form:-Auw .
N. 1 , Auw .
N. 2 , &amp;c. 2ndly .
Under the form D'Arr .
1 , 2 , &amp;c. , are given a series of objects contained in a MS .
list of 125 nebulae , kindly communicatedto me by their discoverer , M. D'AIREST , Director of the Royal Observatory of Copenhagen , and reduced by him to the epoch ( 1860-0 ) of this Catalogue , with their precessions for 1880,.3rdly .
A great number of nebulae cited under the form " R. novae , " whose places have been approximately obtained from the diagrams accompanied by micrometrical measures of position and distance , or from more loose and general indications contained in Lord ROSSE'S paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1861 , the comparisons being in all cases made with those nebule in my Catalogue of 1833 whose numbers stand annexed to them in column 2 , with an italic letter appended , thus : 322 , a R.nova ; 319 , a R. 3 nova .
In cases of which latter kind it is intended to express merely that nebule to the number indicated , not otherwise identifiable , will be found on due search in the immediate neighbourhood of the place approximately set down .
Lastly .
The names of Professor G. P. BOND , Mr. S. COOLIDGE , and Mr. J. T. SAFFORD in this column of the supplementary list of nebulae refer to the places of nebulae and clusters in a list of objects of that description discovered at the Observatory of Harvard College , obligingly communicated to me by Professor BOND , Director of that establishment , too late for their introduction into the body of the Catalogue .
Besides these references , in which the places set down have been adopted from the catalogues above mentioned , column 4 also contains synonyms or identifications of objects observed by myself with those contained in MESSIER'S lists communicated to the French Academy , or to the Connoissance des Temps for 1783 and 1784 .
These are cited by the number they bear in MESSIER'S own list , thus , M. 1 , M. 2 , &amp;c. They have , with very few exceptions , been observed and described by myself or my Father , and their places here set down are given as results from our observations .
In the few excepted cases they are taken from M. AUWERS'S catalogue already spoken of .
The nebulae also whose identity has been ( sometimes satisfactorily , but for the most part very doubtfully ) made out with objects in Mr. DUNLOP'S Catalogue of Southern Nebule , are indicated by the letter A , thus , A. 169 , &amp;c. In a few cases , chiefly those of nebulous stars , planetary nebulae , or very star-like objects , which have been set down as stars in catalogues of authority ; these are also referred to by name and number in column 4 .
Many of Mr. DUNLOP'S nebulae are contained in LACAILLE'S catalogue , as also some of MESSIER'S , but of that catalogue two objects only , not so identifiable , viz. Nos. 38 and 40 of M. AUWERS'S catalogue of LACAILLE'S nebule , have been considered as definitely enough described ( nebuleuses sans etoiles ) by that astronomer to be inlcuded in the present Catalogue .
Column 5 contains the Right Ascension in time for 1860'0 of each object in the Catalogue .
When this is given to decimals of seconds , it is to be understood as having been brought up from the mean of the observations given in my former Catalogues , or from the mean of those ( where not observed by myself ) in Miss C. HERSCHEL'S Zone Catalogue above mentioned * .
When the R.A. is given only to the nearest minute or degree , it will of course be understood that the place is too loosely determined to render further precision of statement other than illusory .
This is the case with the greater part of those set down as " R. nove .
" Column 6 contains the precession , in seconds and decimals , in R.A. for 1880'0 .
Column 7 contains the number of observations in R.A. which have been actually used in concluding the R.A. for 1830 , from which that for 1860 has been computed .
In all cases ( unless where the contrary is especially indicated in a note , or otherwise as by the letters B.A.C. or A.S.C. , Au .
, &amp;c. inserted in place of a number in the column itself-which indicate that the R.A. is that of a star in one of those catalogues , or rests upon that other authority ) , the observations used for all objects included in my former catalogues are brought up from the data there registered , to the exclusion of all others ; and in such cases ( the vast majority ) no parenthesis or other distinctive mark is applied .
When , however , no satisfactory R.A s en th .
is there expressly stated to have been set down from the " working list , " the R.A. adopted is that brought up from the Zone Catalogue of C.H. , and in such cases the number of observations used is enclosed in parentheses ( ) .
Dots attached ( : ) indicate some uncertainty in the R.A. ; ( : : ) a very considerable doubt , extending , perhaps , to a whole minute ; , and T ?
express still wider limits of uncertainty .
In those nebulae of my Father 's catalogues which have no number corresponding in column 2 ( indicating the absence of any of bservations of my own ) , the places set down both in R.A. and Declination are te those brought up from th the Zone Catalogue of is C. H. , and te numbers of observations on which they rely are set down in the appropriate column without any parenthesis or distinctive marks , the absence of any number in column 2 being a sufficient indication .
In the case of M. D'ARREST'e nof M.umbers in column 6 encloseule , thus in column 6 enclosed thus ]inndicate the number of his observations of the nebula employed by himself to give the place .
Columns 8 , 9 , and 10 contain , in like manner , the North Polar Distance for 1860 , the precessions for 1880 , and the numbers of observations used for P.D. in the case of each object ; and the same remarks apply to these as to columns 5 , 6 , and 7 .
In column I1I is given a short description of the nebula or cluster in abbreviated words , made out from an assemblage and comparison of all the descriptions of each object given in my Father 's and my own observations .
As regards the former , recourse was had , not to the printed account in the Philosophical Transactions ( which gives only a single description ) , but to a series of manuscript sheets in the nature of a REGISTER ( and as such cited in the notes which follow this Catalogue ) , into which have been transcribed , verbatimn , from the original sweeps , all the descriptive parts of each and every observation of each cluster or nebula in the order of their dates , and the data for computing their places , derived from the sweeps by applying the index and clock corrections pertaining to each .
In this Register the nebulae are entered , each with its class and number , and each on a separate sheet ; the whole series being arranged , however , not in the order of their classes and numbers , but in the order of the dates of their discovery , from No. 1 , corresponding to October 28,1783 , to No. 2508 , corresponding to September 30 , 1802 .
Of these , the first 2500 only are included in the catalogues com municated to the Royal Society ; the other 8 are printed in the form of an Appendix to my Cape Catalogue , in p. 128 of the " Results of Observations , " &amp;c. A similar and separate Register in sheets has been kept for my Father 's observations of MESSIl'S nebulae , and these have in like manner been collated with my own observations of the same objects in framing the ultimate , or , as it may be termed , the average description of each .
In making out these descriptions , it was found to a certain degree practicable , in the particulars of brightness , size , and extension , to make a kind of arithmetical approximation to a mean conclusion , by arranging the degrees of brightness , &amp;c. in a progressive upward scale from I to 10 , and taking a mean of these numbers in each case , as indicating the designating words to be finally adopted .
Thus , taking the extreme degree of faintness when a nebula was declared to be " excessively faint , " or " barely visible , " or " hardly more than suspected " for 1 , and " extremely " or " excessively bright " for 10 , the intermediate degrees , such as very faint , faint , considerably faint , pretty faint , pretty bright , considerably bright , Bright , very bright , were denoted by the intermediate numbers 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ; and similarly for the scale of sizes , exchanging the words Small and Large for Faint and Bright .
In the case of extension , the scale 1 to 10 was supposed arranged in the order , Pound , very little extended , elliptic or oval , considerably extended , pretty much extended , much extended , very much extended , extremely extended , or a long ray .
It is obvious that the qualifying words , such as " pretty ' and " considerably , " admit of a good deal of latitude of interpretation , and that , in reference to brightness or faintness , greatness or smallness , their meaning is rather relative than absolute ; and especially , that as between bright or faint , and " considerably bright " or " considerably faint , " for instance , there is so little real distinction of an absolute kind , that it is impossible to say which is to be accepted as indicating the superior degree .
In the case of extension there is the same indistinctness as to precedence between the qualifying phrases " considerably " and " pretty much .
" Nicety , however , in this respect would be misplaced , when it is considered that when several descriptions of the same nebula , observed at different times , come to be compared , they can hardly ever be reconciled except by allowing to each qualification a latitude of meaning extending over several degrees of our arbitrary scale .
In many instances , indeed , the discordance , or rather contradiction is so great , as to authorize a strong suspicion of variability in the object itself .
In a few cases where , from the low altitude of the object in England , coupled with corresponding discordances of description , it was evident that it must have been seen to much greater advantage from the Cape station ( as , for example , in that of h. 3375 = H. III .
754 ) , additional weight has been attributed to the Cape observations .
In the descriptions , I have found it absolutely necessary to abstain from any specification of the estimated sizes of nebule or clusters in angular measure .
In comparing estimations of this kind I find the discordance so great , and ( to speak only of my own practice ) so little evidence of adherence to any definite standard of estimation , that nothing but confusion would have arisen from introducing such estimates .
Nevertheless , as in the use of such a catalogue as the present some guide is necessary for the 10 observer , to advertise him of what sort of object he may expect to see , the following scale may be taken as conveying a general idea of the magnitudes intended by the conventional words used .
Thus , a round nebula of 3 " or 4 " in diameter would be called extremely small ; one of 10 " or 12 " , very small ; 20 " or 30 " , small , or considerably small ; 50 " or 60 " , pretty small , or pretty large ; 3 ' or 4 ' , considerably large , or large ; 8 ' or 10 ' , very large ; 20 ' and upwards , extremely large .
In estimating clusters of stars ( that is to say , of well separated and scattered stars ) a wider acceptance must be understood , so that , for instance , a cluster of only 1 ' in extent would be considered extremely or very small ; one of 15 ' or 20 ' large , and one of 30 ' or 40 ' very large .
This amplification of scale , however , must not be held applicable to those resolved or resolvable clusters of a " globular " character marked in the descriptions as E , which must be understood as belonging to " nebule " and not to " clusters , " so far as the conventional terms used in the descriptions are concerned .
I should observe also , that when in making out the average appropriate phrase in size I have found any extravagant discordance between the estimate in words and that in figures , as , for instance , where a nebula has been described in words as very large , and the diameter then set down as 2 ' , a compromise has usually been made , and the word modified , as , for instance , to large or considerably large .

Thus esf means that the nebula described " has a globular cluster following and to the southward of it .
" When , however , the description of a cluster ends abruptly thus , * , it is to be understood that " the place taken is that of a conspicuous double star .
" The 12th column of the Catalogue contains the number of times that each nebula has been observed by both my Father and myself , whether its place were taken or not , comprising all the cases in which the object has been seen , and whether described or not .
Since attention has been drawn to the real or supposed variability of nebulae , and since it can hardly be doubted that comets have occasionally been observed as nebulae , this enumeration is not without its importance .
In this column the abbreviation " mon " occasionally occurs .
In such cases the nebulae have been so often and diligently observed for the purpose of exact delineation or " monographing , " that a special enumeration of the observations would be impossible or useless .
Finally , at the end of the line allotted to each nebula occur occasionally one or both of the marks .

The former refers to the notes appended to the Catalogue , the latter to the list of figured nebule in which the publications wherein are contained figures of the nebulae are referred to by plate and figure-those at least which seem entitled , in the present state of astronomical instrument-making and pictorial representation , to be pointed out to the observer as conveying any idea of their appearance .

In P.T. the determining * is omitted , and in the statement of the places of these nebulae , as well as of II .
239 , 240 , 242 , and III .
199 , there is much confusion , for the correction of which see the list of errata subjoined .
Auwers has threaded the intricacies of this maze with singular felicity , but has been misled in the case of II .
243 into assigning to it a totally erroneous place ( 22h 48m R.A. , 73 ? ?

These constitute Lord Rosse 's group seen in or near the place of h. 103 , and 2767 marked in his diagram as A , f3 , , s , and another unlettered ( which call y ) .

171 , neither is h. 120 .
Both places and descriptions 325 , disagree .
313 h. 119 was taken for III .
556 , but no R.A. was obtained , that set down being the 314 ) R.A. brought up from C.H. The descriptions differ so materially , especially in the particular of extension , that they are most probably distinct nebulae .
330 h. 124=VII .
48 .
Auwers remarks in his ' Verbesserungen zu h , ' that this cluster , h. 124 , is not nova , but VII .
48 .
This is correct .
Re-examining sweep 216 , I find an error of 1 ?
committed in reducing the P.D. 358 This is not in M. D'Arrest 's final list , communicated to me in MS .

This nebula , though set down by W.H. as of the 1st class ( i. e. as a bright nebula ) , could not be seen by D'Arrest with the Leipzig Fraunhofer of 6-feet focus and 4 ?
inches aperture .
It is marked in this Catalogue , however , by a mean of 4 observations , only as " F. " 428 55 Andromedue .
Although this star has been eight times examined by Lord Rosse without perceiving any nebulous atmosphere , yet as my observation is corroboSIl J. F. W. HERSCHEL'S CATALOGUE No. 4421h .

169 , II .
221 .
The places agree almost exactly , but the descriptions are irreconcilable .
One makes the nebula round , the other much extended .
They are therefore almost certainly distinct nebulae , and there is therefore probably some error in the R.A. of II .

The neighbourhood is rich in nebulae ( see the next note , however ) .

Though Lord Rosse on one occasion did not find this nebula , its existence cannot be doubted , having been found by h. nearly in the place assigned by C.H. 487 h. 193=1 .

M. D'Arrest found this nebula too faint for observation with the Leipzig refractor , though placed by W.H. in Class I. , and standing in this Catalogue ( from a mean of 3 observations ) as a " bright " nebula .

246 .
Singularly enough , h. and H. are at issue about the two adjacent stars .
h. makes the stars south of the nebula ; H. , on the contrary , places the nebula south of the stars , and says expressly that both this nebula and III .
201 , observed just previously , were similarly situated with regard to their attendant stars .
Now in h. 's obs .
of III .
201 ( No. 513 ) the attendant star is stated to be sf the nebula , and in that of II .
246 the larger of the two stars is south and only a very few degrees preceding .
I believe the error to lie on the side of the older observations , as I have a diagram of the small star nearer to II .
246 , sf , which shows that I made no mistake of n and s. 536 I. 153 .
Auwers makes the R.A. for 1830 Ih 28m 45s , whereas C.H. makes it 2h 15m 13s .
The cause of the discordance lies in an erratum in P.T. ( see list of errata ) .
In C.H. 's reductions the error is corrected , and I find the correction verified on reference both to the Register ( H. 1488 ) and the original sweep ( sw .
596 ) .
The nebulafollows ( not precedes ) the determining star .

Auwers makes the R.A. of this for 1830 , 2h 231 8s ; C.H. No. 2h 20m 57 '8 , by the observations in different sweeps differing only 18s in R.A. The latter is the more correct ; so that M. Auwers 's remarks on this nebula are not confirmed .
The cause of the disagreement lies in a misprint in P.T. ( See List of Errata .

M. D'Arrest found this nebula , when examined with the Leipzig refractor , not entitled to rank above the 2nd class .

The position of ay , instead of 2 ?

C.H. , by 2 observations in sweeps 608 , 638 agreeing to 3s in R.A. and 2 ' in P.D. , gives a place which , brought up to 1830 , gives R.A. 311 37m 58s ; P.D. 94 ? ?

This is the remarkable variable nebula discovered by Mr. Hind on Oct. 11 , 1852 .
M. D'Arrest testifies to its complete disappearance on the 3rd and 4th of Oct. 1861 , " Hujus nebule ... .

Nebula reverd deest .
" ( In 1855 and 1856 it was found by M. D'Arrest within 2 ' of Mr. Hind 's original place .
) On Dec. 29 , 1861 , it was seen by M. Otto Struve with the great Pulkowa refractor , but so excessively faint as to be barely within the power of that instrument .
On March 22 , 1862 , with the same telescope , it was again seen , but considerably brighter , so as to bear a faint illumination of the wires .

975 h. 343 .
A very large diffused nebulosity , distributed in zigzags .
This has been looked for seven times by Lord Rosse and not found .
Its existence is therefore very doubtful .

The place graphically determined by measurement of a diagram , as : compared with h. 2710 .
981 III .
453 .
This was erroneously identified with h. 335 in my Catalogue of 1833 .
By an unlucky coincidence , its place per working list , roughly brought up from C.H. , agreed so well with the latter nebula as taken in sw .
322 ( h. ) , that it was unhesitatingly assumed to be the same .
It appears , however , that in C.H. 's reduction an error of lOm in R.A. has been committed , the star of comparison being 10 Orionis , and the nebula following the star by 5m 7s ( as ascertained by reference both to the register sheet ( tH.1160 ) and the original sweep(sw .
462 , H. ) ) .
M. Auwers , misled by my erroneous identification , has assumed that the nebula must have preceded the star , which would ( nearly ) account for the difference , and in consequence , his R.A. of this nebula is 10m too small .
C.H. 's error probably arose from misapplying in like manner the sign of the A. R.A. 998 III .
268 .
Auwers 's R.A. ( 4h 57 " 23s , 1830 ) is adopted in preference to 5h Om 28s , that brought up from C.H. to the same epoch .
In the sweep 367 ( H. ) three stars of comparison are given , 58 Eridani , : Leporis , and 19 Leporis .
The A. R.A. of a and 19 comes out correct , but that of 58 from each is wrong by 3m 5s , so that the star must have been mistaken .
C.H. has used 58 and a , and has rightly brought out the place of the nebula by the former ( the wrong star ) , and wrongly by the right one ; and by an odd coincidence the two results agree well , though both wrong .

Lord Rosse 's account of this nebula is extremely remarkable .

Polarissima Australis .
This nebula is so near the south pole that its precession in R.A. varies from year to year with great rapidity , so that its R.A. cannot be computed correctly by the ordinary approximate method .
1666 The four nebulae h. 508 , 510 ; 510 , a ; 510 , 6 evidently include among them that 1667 third nebula referred to by Lord Rosse as the accompanying " nova " " forming 1668 ) a triangle with h. 507 , 508-of the last degree offaintness .
" h. 507 , however , is 30 ?
distant in P.D. , so that in the observation of Feb. 9 , 1850 , the P.D. of h. 507 must doubtless have been read as 36 ?
instead of 66 ?
, giving rise to a mistaken identity with one of the two really new nebulae at that time in view .
1696 III .
50 .
I find a memorandum to the effect that this nebula is lost , and was probably a comet ; but I cannot recover my authority for the statement .
It is described by H. as " of the last degree of faintness , " and it is therefore no way 21 CATALOGUTn No. surprising that it should not have been again perceived without some time and trouble bestowed , and in clear weather .
1707 h. 527=II .

M. Auwers , owing to an erratum in P.T. ( see List of Errata ) , makes the R.A. of II .
48 two minutes too great , and is thus led to doubt its identity with h. 527 .
There still remains the rather considerable disagreement of 5 ' in P.D. D'Arrest found neither of these nebulae ; but there can be no doubt of the existence of one at least , in or near the place here given .
This is not the nebula seen by Lord Rosse " nearly in contact with h. 526 .

The descriptions are irreconcilable , and they must be two 1736 ) distinct nebulae .

The great nebula about n Argus .
According to a letter from Mr. Eyre B. Powell of Madras , a most extraordinary change has taken place in this nebula since my figure of it was delineated .
He states that the southern end of the curious oval vacuity close to the great star , which was decidedly closed when I depicted it , is now decidedly open .
Should this be established , it will be the most extraordinary fact that has yet appeared in the history of a nebula .

118 and h. 779 .
The degree of P.D. is probably mistaken in I. 118 .
Marth , 2236 according to Auw .
, suggests that the determining star 46 Ursae ( which though 24 No. not so called in B.A.C. , is doubtless No. 3741 of that catalogue ) was mistaken , and should have been called 46 Leonis minoris .
Consulting the original sweep ( sw .
487 , H. ) , I find this surmise not corroborated ; for the nebula , when reduced by the star next preceding it ( 37 Leonis minoris ) , gives the same Polar distance , and , within a few seconds , the same.t.A .
But there is some faint indication of the figure 6 in the reading of the Polar distance piece 56 ? ?
55 ' having been written over a 7 , which would have thrown the nebula somewhat below the southern limit of the sweep , and might have caused a suspicion of error at the time .
I found no nebula in the catalogued place in my sweep No. 337 ( h. ) , so that the probability of an erroneous degree is strengthened .
At the same time , it is not impossible that this nebula may be identical with No. 2236=h .
779 , the mistake in the degree lying the other way .
2238 h. 780=1 .
172 .
h. , in Ph. Tr. , suggests that this nebula may have moved .
There is , however , no ground for this supposition , as its place agrees quite remarkably with that brought up from C.H. But query if the double star have not moved , since one of the observations places it " in the middle , " and a subsequent one makes the southern extremity of the nebula touch the large star of the double star .

Auwers deduces his R.A. for 1830 ( 11 " 12m1 21s ) from the statement in P.T. " following 68 , B Leonis , 6m 30s .

The latter is ( within 2s ) the correct result .

These are very probably the same .
But as , after all , the difference of the observed R.A. 's is sufficient to have allowed one to escape while observing the other , so that they may be different , and as moreover one is described as " Round , " and the other as " extended , " both are retained .

Auwers has reduced this nebula by the star given in P.T. p , 74 Leonis .
But I find a MS .
note that this star was not dependable , and that Mayer 's No. 510 is the proper determining star .
The nebula was subsequently looked for and found , not in the place given by p , but 8 ' from the P.D. concluded from Mayer 510 .
A mean of these two determinations is therefore used in this Catalogue .
2440 h. 907=III .

Auwers doubts the identity of these nebulwe .
But this is in consequence of a misprint in P.T. ( see List of Errata ) , 53m for 43m .
The error is found also in the Register Sheet ( H. 937 ) , but C.H. has avoided it and used 43m in her reduction so as to give a R.A. agreeing within 35s with that of h. 907 .

The places set down 2689 26 for the nebulae of this extensive group are made out by a most careful consider2690 ' 3 ation of all the observations and records in the sweeping books which seem irreconcilable with a group of six nebulae only .
The group , however , needs a 2694 thorough re-examination .
2697 2699 ; 2701 , 2702 , 2730 II .

Owing to an erratum in P.T. ( see ist of Errata ) Auwers gives quite an erroneous place for this nebula ( 1h1 39m 27s R.A. , 81 ? ?
9 ' P.D. 1830 ) .
2747 h. 1103=1II .

Auwers suspects some error of the press , since his P.D. for 1830 comies jot 36 ? ?
58 ' , while hat of h. 1103 is 35 ? ?
56 ' .
There is , however , 17'f No. no error , either of printing , registry , or reduction in any part of the older work .
The determining star is rightly set down as 5 Canum , whose P.D. for 1800 ( the epoch of C.H. 's catalogue ) is 37 ? ?
19 ' 42 " , and III .
814 is declared to be 1 ? ?
32 ' north of it , so that 35 ? ?
48 ' , the P.D. of C.H. , is correct , and reduced to 1830 ( = 35 ? ?
58 ' ) agrees with my place within 2 ' .
Neither is there any error of the press or of reduction , or any apparent mistake of a clerical nature in all the process of h. 1103 , and the nebula observed is set down in the sweeping book ( of course from the working list ) as III .
814 .
I consider their identity therefore as fully established .

H. describes I. 31 as " between two bright stars .
" The places differ 15 ' in P.D. ; h. describes I. 38 ( the place well agreeing with that of H. ) in one observation as having a large star f , and in two others as having a star 9m , p ; that is , in effect , as lying between two bright stars .
N.B. The star used for I. .
31 is 31 dl Virginis , and for I. 38 , 32 d2 Virginis .
The declination of 31 d1 is 30 ' wrong in A.S.C. ( No. 1469 ) .
In B.A.C. it is right .
The P.Di 's of the two nebule of H. differ , as already remarked , by 15 ' .

47 ' ( see List of Errata ) .
The correction of the place in P.T. is not , properly speaking , an erratum , but the substitution of a good observation for a bad one .
In the obs .
sw .
177 ( H. ) , where 20 Comae was used as the determining star , the place is given only by description .
In a sweep long subsequent ( sw .
944 ) it was compared with 26 Comae in the regular form of observation , and this is of course to be preferred .
Auwers 's place is deduced from the earlier , and that of C.H. from the later observation , rejecting the other .
3079 h. 1322=8 Canum .
This very remarkable object occurs among the list of those observed by Lord Rosse in his paper in P.T. 1861 , but without a word of remark or description ; and it does not occur among his list of nebulosities looked for but not perceived .
Surely it might be inferred from this that the nebulosity surrounding the star was seen , or its absence would have been noticed , as in the instance of 55 Andromede .
Yet Mr. Lassellsaw no nebulosity about 8 Canum .
3097 h. 1348=M .
89 .
Lord Rosse has h. 1343 and 1348 , and in his account of them says , two others , about 2f0 s. of 1348 ; " one of these must have been h. 1343 , and the other h. 1349 .
3103 h. 1353=- .

This nebula was barely perceptible , with straining the attention , by M. D'Arrest with the 42-inch Leipzig refractor .
It is described in this Catalogue as " considerably bright " by two observations .
3108 h. 1358 , 1359 , 1363=IV .

The obs .

DIArrest is sure that there is no other double nebula in this neighbourhood .
3111 M. 90 .
The place is from two observations by W.H. , as also the description .
3127 h. 1374=1 .
273 .
The descriptions of H. differ so much that it is not impossible three may be another bright nebula near this place .
3138 h. 1379=II .
577 .
Two diagrais by h. in sweeps141 , 14,14 agreeing , represent this nebula as making a considerably.acute-angled , nearly isosceles triangle with aLISEIES OFT STRS .
No. two following stars .
I. says , " Between two Bright stars , making a trianigl with them .
" No one now , looking at those diagrams , would call the sitution of the nebula between the starss .
A suspicion of proper motion arises in such a case .
3148 h. 1384=II .
148 .
In my Catalogue of 1833 this nebula is idenfied with II .
20 , and in the Register Sheets ( H. 320 ) , under the head of II .
148 , there is a memorandum , " Probably the same as II .
20 ( H. 47 ) .
" But on examining all the observations of both nebulae , I arrive at the conclusion that they are different , II .

Auwers 3179 remarks , and justly , on the great apparent discordance of the observations of h. 3206 and his places of II .
794 , 5 , 6 , and those of W.H. The fact is that the places 3216 of these in the P.T. all rest on comparisons with g Ursee in sweeps 921 and 3224 ) 1001 ( H. ) ; and the observation of that star has been erroneous or mistaken in sw .
921 by about 11 ' in P.D. , as appears from an obs .
of 73 Ursee in the same sweep .
The nebulae affected by this error are those here enumerated , and it requires very careful consideration to disentangle all the observations of each nebula by both stars , and to decide on their identities .
My final conclusions are , -lst , that in these sweeps two distinct nebulae , II .
794 , 1 and II .
794 , 2 , were observed , and confounded together under one number ( =H .
2079 register ) .
These are my h. 1406 , 1407 .
2ndly , that h. 1407 and III .
778 , II .
795 , 796 are correctly determined in sw .
1001 ( H. ) .
3rdly , that in sw .
921 ( H. ) the nebula set down as II .
794 was not the same as that called II .
794 in the reduction of sw .
1001 ; i. e. that it was in fact h. 1406 , and that in this observation there is also an error of 6 ' in P.D. , or that , if not , there must be still another nebula in P.D. 33 ? ?
54 ' ( 1860 ) .
Finally , that the place of III .
778 given in Phil. Tr. , which is affected by the same general cause of error , requires a correction of +9 ' in P.D. 3180 h. 1405=III .
44 .
This is the companion of M. 60 , and is placed by M. D'Arrest in the first class , even with the 41-inch Leipzig refractor .
Perhaps the very superior light of M. 60 may have led both H. and h. to under-estimate that of its , anyhow , much fainter companion .
3189 h. 14144,1415-=1 .
176 , 177 .
These two , according to Lord Rosse , are connected 3190j by faint nebulosity .

The case of this nebula is a very odd one .
H. has two observations of it .

Many of the st. visible .
" So that it may be called a cluster .
Both the places of H. and that of h. agree so well , that the object in all must have been the same .
Here seems evidence of change .

His place is from P.T. 3358 r 53 Virginis n. 1 ? ?
4 ' , whereas C.H. in her reductions uses n. 10 11 ?
, and my 3420 observations of this and the other nebulae in this list justify the departure .
I 3483 subjoin her note on this nebula ( in zone 103 ?
C.H.):"I .
68 , I. 69 , III .
282 are each 7 ' more north than they are given in the " printed Catalogue .
The disagreement is the result of the recalculation , and " is probably owing to my attempting more accuracy in valuing the ' numbers " to a degree , ' &amp;c. &amp;c. " ( i. e. in the index reductions of the Polar distance readings which were parts of an arbitrary scale ) .
And in the next zone ( 104 ?
C.H. ) occurs , " II .
299 and II .
301 require the same memorandum .
" In point of fact , comparing my own observations with those reduced by M. Auwers , the differences , as stated by him , run thus : I. 68 ... A.P.D. H-h= +5 ' I. 69 ... .
+7 III .
282 ... ... . .
+7 ' II .

C.H. is to be preferred on every account to P.T. Her A.P.D.

In almost every case I find her corrections ( or rather interpretations ) to be justified ; and I have no doubt that in this particular instance such will prove the case , though here I confess myself , after consulting the original sweep , unable to perceive the reason for the deviation .

All that can be certainly affirmed is that , within a degree one way or the other in P.D. , and from 5 to 10 minutes of time in R.A. of the place set down , there exists a fine cluster of the 6th class which should be looked for .
Fortunately it is the only nebula observed in the sweep , a very short one .

O wing to an erroneous designation of the -determining star in P.T. ( see F2 35 No. List of Errata ) , Auwers has given the place of this nebula ( 1830 ) as R.A. 14h 41m 3s ; Decl. +60 ? ?

Mr. P. in that statement says that Sir J. Herschel ( among others mentioned ) had described it as either " cometary " or " nebulous .

The comparison of the place here set down with that of Auwers is curious for the great number of perfectly accidental errors which have heaped themselves together .
The place ( C.H. ) is rightly reduced by her from a Herculis , f 16m 11s ; n 0 ' 14 " , which is that given in P.T. , and which , reduced to 1830 , gives for the R.A. 16h 44m 46S'8 and for the P.D. 47 ? ?
58 ' 16 " , differing +8SS8 and 4-11 " from the exact result .

127 ; R.A. 161B 14m 47s ; Decl. +43 ?

59 ' ) .
That is to say , there is a misprint in each of the three particulars .
This is not to be taken as a specimen of M. Auwers 's work , which is an admirable example of painstaking devotion , and far beyond any eulogy in my power to offer .
But it is a striking instance of the way in which , in the great run of chances , unlucky coincidences will happen .

There is a singular statement respecting this cluster by Cacciatore in No. 113 of the Astronomische Nachrichten .
Hie observed it as a nebula , he says , on the 19th of March , 1826 ( of course , therefore , Dunlop has the priority in point of date ) .
But where he saw it Lacaille , he says , noted his star 1483 ( Ccelum Australe ) .
Also , Piazzi in 1794 and 1801 in the same place saw only a star .
Cacciatore in 1809 and 1810 observed the same star , but saw no nebula , only a star 9m following it ( P. xvii .
341 , 346 ) .
In looking for the comet of 1826 , however , " fui colpito , " he says , " da questa bella nebulosa .
" Unfortunately for this curious history , the place of Piazzi 's star referred to ( and which he identifies with 1483 C.A. ) differs by no less than 18 ' in P.D. from that of the nebula in question , which was therefore out of the field of view , both of his own and of Piazzi 's telescope , when observing the star .

H. 's two observations hardly consist with this description , and their deviation in R.A. of nearly 4m from Messier 's place makes it very doubtful whether he really saw this object .

This is the nebula discovered by Tuttle on Sept. 1 , 1859 , and it would appear to be variable , for M. D'Arrest says ( in a letter of May 8 , 1863 ) , " La nebuleuse de M. Tuttle ( Astron. Nachr .

According to an observation of Olbers , cited by Auwers , this 4586J is identical with No. 4585=1 .

This had escaped my notice until the nebule in this Catalogue had been finally numbered and much other work accumulated on them ; and it was considered better to let No. 4585 stand , though erroneous , than to hazard confusion by striking it out and altering all the subsequent numbering .
