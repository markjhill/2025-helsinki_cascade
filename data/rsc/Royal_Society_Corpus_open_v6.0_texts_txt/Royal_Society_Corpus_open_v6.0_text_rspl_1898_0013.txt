( Second Paper .
) In a paper communicated to the Royal Society in the year 187 !
and printed in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1880 , I con pared the diurnal range of magnetic declination and horizonh force , as observed at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , during th years 1841 to 1877 , with the corresponding numbers of sun-spc frequency as determined by the late Dr. Rudolf Wolf , of Zurich A I then said , I conceived that the long series of Greenwich observa tions , made throughout on the same general plan and with instru ments of the same kind , might be applied as a valuable independen test of the reality of the relation generally understood to exis between the phenomena in question .
And the comparison appear* to be distinctly confirmatory thereof .
For it was to be observec at , although the sun-spot period , commonly called the eleven-year period , varied in length to the extent of several years , tht correspon ing magnetic periods varied in a similar manner .

I will therefore proceed to describe the new work , extending from 1878 to 1896 .
before the mean j Magnetic Declination and Horizontal Force and Solar Spots .
65 liurnal range of declination in each individual month is taken to .epresent ( relatively to other months ) the magnetic energy of the nonth , and similarly for horizontal force .
By the mean diurnal *ange is to be understood a number formed as follows .
Means of .he indications at each separate hour of the day being taken through i month ( omitting days of extreme disturbance ) the difference aetween the leasli and the greatest of the twenty-four mean values is -he monthly mean diurnal range .
The numbers are obtained from -he Greenwich annual volumes , but those for the years 1895 and 1896 not having been yet published , the Astronomer Royal has kindly allowed me to use them as necessary for the purposes of this paper .
The very small correction for temperature required by the horizontal force results from 1878 to 1882 as printed , has been duly applied : beginning with 1883 , the values are printed corrected for temperature .
Thus is obtained , both for declination and horizontal force , results strictly comparable with those of the previous paper , giving in all a series of results for fifty-six years .
In any graphical representation of unexplained phenomena , it is most important that there should be ready reference to the numerical data on which it is founded , to enable those who might wish to test the work the means of so doing without great inconvenience , otherwise the graphical representation alone can carry no proper conviction .
The numbers for the years 1841 to 1877 are to be found in the previous paper ; it is therefore necessary to give here only the corresponding numbers from 1878 to 1896 .
These are contained in Table I. The numbers for horizontal force are given , as in the previous paper , in parts of the whole horizontal force taken as unity .
The relation in magnitude of the westerly force ( declination ) to the northerly force ( horizontal force ) will be understood by considering that one minute of arc of declination corresponds to ( H)0029 , that is 29 of the horizontal force unit of Table I. Examining now this table , it will be seen that there is an annual inequality in the magnitude of the diurnal range , the summer numbers being much greater than the winter numbers .
In order , therefore , to estimate progressive change , it is convenient to form a number for each month that shall be free of annual inequality , to allow the progressive change better to appear .
Assuming the different months to be of the same length this is done , as before , by taking the mean of each twelve consecutive monthly numbers , beginning successively with each individual month , first , say , with January , next with February , and so on , taking afterwards the mean of each two consecutive numbers so found , thus producing annual values free of annual inequality , which may be presumed to apply to the middle of each successive month .
The process is equivalent , suppose for the number for o 2 66 Mr. W , Ellis .
Relation between Diurnal Range of January , to adding together half the sum of the numbers for th preceding and following July , and the sum of the numbers for th intervening eleven months , August to June , and dividing the who !
by twelve .
These new monthly numbers , each expressing an annua i mean , are given in Table II , both for declination and horiz'onta force , and they are used with those of Table II of the previous papei to form the two lower curves of the accompanying plate .
I remarket in my previous paper that the indications of vertical force were foi : the present purpose not very manageable ; several different instru-i ments had been employed , and the results presented anomalies j Certain beneficial alterations were , however , made in 1882 , in the !
instrument still in use , since which time it has worked better .
It !
showed a maximum diurnal range in 1883 , the descent to a minimum in 1889 , and the subsequent rise to a maximum , although there j remains still some degree of irregularity of action .
As- regards sun-spot frequency , Dr. Wolf 's monthly values , as derived directly from observation , are given for the years 1841 to i 1877 , in Table VI of my previous paper .
Those for the years fob !
lowing 1878 to 1896 are to be found in different numbers of his I * Astronomische Mittheilungen , ' the values in the later years , after the death of Dr. Wolf , in 1893 , having been similarly prepared by Professor Wolfer , his successor at Zurich .
I am not aware that these have been before given in a collected form ; they will be found in the annexed Table III .
For the purpose of smoothing the acci-fl dental irregularities of these observed sun-spot numbers , Dr. Wolf J treated them in the same way as the numbers of our Table I ( expressing4 magnetic range ) were dealt with to form those of Table II .
Though !
the process was here employed for a reason different to that which\#174 ; rendered its application necessary in the case of magnetic range , the | similarity of treatment happily makes the resulting numbers strictly I comparable with the magnetic numbers .
The smoothed sun-spot* numbers , from 1841 to 1876 , June , are to be found in a table con-\#187 ; tained in Dr. IVolf s paper , " Memoire sur la Periode commune a lal Frequence des Taches Solaires et a la Variation de la Declinaison I Magnetique."* Those from 1876 , July , to 1896 , added in ourl Table III , have been in part taken from the ' Astronomische Mit-1 theilungen and in part calculated from the observed numbers con- 1 tained in the same table .
These smoothed values , with those of the I preceding series taken from the paper above mentioned , are used to a form the upper curve in the diagram of collected sun-spot and jfl magnetic curves .
It may be asked why the Greenwich magnetic 1 variations are not compared with the Greenwich sun-spot record , But this record having been maintained only for some twenty years , 1 it was deemed better to adhere throughout to the long Wolf seines I * ' Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society , ' to 43 , p. 199 .

Examination of the collected curves will , I think , show that the ^tension of the period previously employed by inclusion of the new ssults , extending from 1878 to 1896 , has produced curves that offer diking points of interest .
Selecting the extreme points of the 3veral curves , or , which is better , taking the successive least and reatest values from Table II , and from the corresponding table f the previous paper , for magnetic values , and from Table III , and rom the corresponding table in vol. 43 of the ' Royal Astronomical Society Memoirs , ' for smoothed sun-spot values , the following epochs f minimum and maximum are obtained :\#151 ; Table of Epochs of Magnetic and Sun-spot Minima and Maxima .

These values differ slightly from those above given , owing to the numbers becoming here combined in a little different way .
Fig. 2 suggests a suspicion that the period decreases in length through sevei'al periods , then increases for several periods , and so on .
But what may be the order of such variations is a question to which at present it does not seem possible to give any reliable answer .
Examining further the collected curves , it is seen that the maximum points of the curves have at different epochs very different degrees of intensity .
If for each curve we arrange the epochs of maximum in order , with reference thereto , we find as follows 70 Mr. W. Ellis .

for the epochs of 1848 and 1860 , which in horizontal force are !
reversed in position , although otherwise falling in with the general !
order of the other curves .
The horizontal force observations have to be corrected for the effect of temperature ( a correction not required for declination ) , and in the years 1848 and 1860 the magnets were in !
the original upper magnet room , in which the diurnal range of temperature was considerable , rendering difficult the determination of the actual temperature of the magnet ( a bar 2 feet in length ) , and this may possibly account for the apparent displacement of the 1848 and 1860 epochs of maximum in horizontal force .
In 1864 an underground basement was specially constructed for the magnets , in which the variation of temperature is small , and in this apartment the magnets have since remained .
As regards the minimum points !
of the curves , the sun-spots at the epochs of 1856 , 1867 , 1879 , and ; 1890 practically disappear , but not so at that of 1843 , at which epoch : the most elevated of the magnetic minima , both in declination and !
horizontal force , occurs , being so far in harmony with what has been| pointed out as to the behaviour at maximum .
Considering that the irregularities in the length of the sun-spot ; period so entirely synchronise with similar irregularities in thej magnetic period , and also that the elevation or depression of the !
maximum points of the sun-spot curve is accompanied by similar elevations and depressions in the two magnetic curves , it would j seem , in the face of such evidence , that the supposition that such ] agreement is probably only accidental coincidence can scarcely be| maintained , and there would appear to be no escape from the conclu-j Sion that such close correspondence , both in period and activity , !
indicates a more or less direct relation between the two phenomena , j oi otherwise the existence of some common cause producing both* !
The sharp rise from minimum epoch to maximum epoch , and the !
moie gradual fall from maximum epoch to minimum epoch , may be j pointed out as a characteristic of all three curves .
The similarity of 1 Magnetic Declination and Horizontal Force and Solar Spots .
71 lie little drop shown in all the carves in 1882 and 1883 is also striking .
Observation has been supposed to indicate that the magnetic effect follows the snn-spot effect , so that a retardation , or what has been jailed a " lagging , " of the magnetic effect exists , but the evidence for -his has never appeared to me to be quite satisfactory .
The fewer comparisons of sun-spot and magnetic epochs given in my first paper seemed to give support to such supposition .
But taking the more extended comparison contained in the preceding table of epochs , it is seen that the declination epoch is on the whole retarded by 0T8y ( fraction cf year ) , whilst that of horizontal force is accelerated by 005y .
Mean retardation = 0'06y .
Looking at the irregularities in the numbers on which these means are founded , it seems doubtful whether , without a yet more extended comparison , any real difference or definite lagging can be said to exist .
Two things , however , may be noted .
One is , that the differences in the early part of the table are inclined to positive , and in the later portion to negative values .
What will happen when further results are included ?
Considering , however , the strength of the evidence for some form of relation that has been shown by what has preceded to exist , it seems in every way probable that the individual differences of epoch represent in great part accidental residuals .
Rather , indeed , is it not likely that to some extent small differences or irregularities may be expected to appear , when it is remembered that we are comparing together solar and terrestrial phenomena , to us probably only incomplete manifestations of involved actions , about which little is known and of which the cause is obscure .
Especially , too , when , as regards the terrestrial effect , the magnetic variations are deduced from the observations at a single station , Greenwich .
Consider also the composite character of the sun-spot phenomena at about the time of minimum epoch .
After a maximum , as the following minimum epoch is approached , sun-spots become in successive years fewer in number i and smaller in magnitude , the regions north and south of the solar ( equator in which spots appear tending , as the spots become less i numerous , more and more towards the equator , until at the minimum I epoch the spots disappear .
At the same time , spots of , as it were , a I new cycle come into view in high latitudes , and become rapidly more Pi numerous and important until another maximum is passed , after * which the spots become again less numerous , the regions in which I they appear approaching as before the solar equator , until at the 0 following minimum again the spots disappear .
Thus the curve at \#166 ; the minimum epoch seems to be produced by the junction of an 6 expiring cycle with a new outburst becoming rapidly active .
In tabulating the magnetic records at Greenwich , it has been the 1 practice to include all days ( except those of extreme disturbance ) , 72 Mr. W. Ellis .
Relation between Diurnal Range of consequently on many that are retained considerable disturbance exists .
Now abnormal disturbance is more frequent , as well as greater in magnitude , towards the epochs of maximum sunspot frequency , and tends almost to disappear at the epochs of / minimum frequency .
For instance , the sun-spot minima of 1856 and 1879 were both remarkablei for little irregular disturbance especially the latter , whilst at the sun-spot maximum of 1870 , disturbance was unusually frequent and considerable in amount , the difference in this respect being very striking , as a mere inspection of the photographic records for the epochs mentioned would abundantly show .
Iu preparing the former paper the question^ therefore , did arise whether and to what extent the increased diurnal magnetic range , about the periods of sun-spot maximum , might be due to the greater prevalence at such periods of abnormal disturbance , but I then satisfied myself , by examination of the records , that this circumstance exercised no important influence on the results4 Now , however , I can substantiate that conclusion by numerical dataJj It is known to those acquainted with magnetic work that in order the better and more readily to compare together the diurnal magnetic inequalities for different places it has been the practice , since the year 1889 , to tabulate the records at British observatories for five selected quiet days in each month , the selection of days being made by the Astronomer Royal .
These quiet day results , unaffected by magnetic disturbance , show only the solar diurnal variation , and are ' now available for Greenwich , from 1889 to 1896 .
Mean hourly !
values being formed in each month from the indications on the five i quiet days , the diurnal range of declination and horizontal force was | ound in the same way as before described for the full monthly !
values , the resulting numbers being given in Table IY .
These were I treated for rem'val of the annual inequality , in the same way !
that the numbers of Table I were treated to form those of Table II .
i ihe values so found are contained in Table Y , and are those repre-I sen e grap ically in fig. 3 , adding thereto the graphical representa- J ' , 6 San'sP'^ and magnetic phenomena , for the corresponding ] years from the long series 1841\#151 ; 1896 , in which all days ( excepting I those of extreme disturbance ) were included .

And secondly , that the effect of I including disturbed days ( thick line ) alters the solar diurnal range 1 Magnetic Declination and Horizontal Force and Solar Spots .
73 Fig. 3.\#151 ; Sun-spot Frequency and Diurnal Range of Declination and Horizontal Force compared .
The upper curve is that of sun-spot frequency .
The middle and lower curves are those of diurnal range of declination and horizontal force respectively ; the thick line is that resulting from the employment of all days , and the thin line that found from five selected quiet days in each month .
( thin line ) in a small degree only as compared with its variation with sun spots , from which it follows that the diurnal range as found from employing all days ( thick line ) , as in the 1841\#151 ; 1896 series , may be taken to represent the solar diurnal range ( thin line ) the variation of the former being essentially that of the solar diurnal range .
The explanation of the circumstance that the difference in the amplitude of the magnetic range , as found from five selected quiet days , and from all days , is so small as compared with the variation in amplitude of both with variation of sun spots , would seem to be that the effect of irregular magnetic disturbance is such as sometimes to increase the value of the magnetic element and sometimes to decrease it , these opposite effects combining to neuti'alise each other to such an extent as to influence the solar diurnal range in an unimportant degree only , as compared with its considerable variation with that of sun spots , which is the point that is here material .
Although the change produced in the character of the diurnal magnetic movement by including disturbed days is not a matter that possesses significance as regards the purposes of this paper , it becomes in other respects one for consideration .
It is , however , a question related toothers that would be better discussed in a separate communication .
