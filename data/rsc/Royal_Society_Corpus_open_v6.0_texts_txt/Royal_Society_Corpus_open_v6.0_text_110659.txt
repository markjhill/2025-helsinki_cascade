" Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope , in the year 1838 , with Bradley 's Zenith Sector , for the verification of the amplitude of the Abbe de la Caille 's Are of the Meridian ; by order of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty .
" By Thomas Maclear , Esq. , M.A. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. Communicated by Sir John Barrow , Bart. , V.P.R.S. , &amp;c. The author gives an account of the precautions taken in putting together the different parts of the zenith sector , which he received on the 9th of December , 1837 , in erecting it in the central room of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope , and in afterwards transferring it to the southern station of La Caille , in Cape Town .
Fle then proceeds to describe La Caille 's observatory , and the particular circumstances of its loculity , with relation to the object in view , namely to determine the influence of Table Mountain on the direction of the plumb-line .
He next reiates his progress to Klyp Fonteyn , where he arrived on the 24 &lt; th of March , 1838 , and describes the operations resorted to for erecting the sector at that place .
IIe then enters into the details of observations made at different sta ?
tions , and especially with comparative observations at the summit and foot of the mountain of Pequet Berg .
The instrument was lastly conveyed back to Cape Town , and again examined , and the observations made with it repeated .
The reduction of the observations occupies the remainder of the paper ; and in conclusion , the author remarks , that although these labours have not altogether cleared up the anomaly of La Caille 's are , yet they show that great credit is due to that distinguished astronomer , who with imperfect means , and at the period in which he lived , arrived at a result , derived from sixteen stars , almost identical Avith that from 1139 observations on forty stars , made with a celebrated and powerful instrument .
