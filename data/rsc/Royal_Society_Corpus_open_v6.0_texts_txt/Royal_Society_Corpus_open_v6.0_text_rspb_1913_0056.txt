Plasmodium Conclusions .
I The trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland is fatal to goats , sheep , dogs , and the smaller laboratory animals , killing them , without exception , in a few weeks .
It is less virulent to cattle , many of which evidently escape .
2 .
No difference in virulence can be made out in these five Human strains .

It is not satisfactorily proved yet to what species this trypanosome belongs , but the Commission at present leans to the opinion that it is T. brucei ( Plimmer and Bradford ) .

] It would appear from a perusal of the available literature that malaria of antelopes has not hitherto been described ; it is therefore proposed to place on record the discovery of a plasmodium found in the blood of two of these animals in Nyasaland .
This parasite was first seen in the blood of a young duiker grimmi ) , and was subsequently discovered in another young animal of the same species .
Both these small antelope were at the time in captivity , and it was therefore possible to examine slides from day to day , and by this means a large number of parasites at various stages of development were observed , and some of these are figured in Plates 4 and 5 .
The acute attack in one antelope , however , only lasted four days , and the parasites soon disappeared entirely from the peripheral blood , whereas in the other only a few parasites were seen , and these have persisted in the blood for some months .
The parasites resemble somewhat Plasmodium of man , in that the gametocytes are circular and the schizonts have from eight to twelve merozoites ; also amceboid movement is sluggish .
They differ , however , in the marked enlargement and paleness of the red cell and in the arrangement Sir I ) .
Bruce and others .
and appearance of the pigment , which is not scattered throughout the parasite , but is collected in a single mass , and is pale yellow in colour ( Plate 5 ) .
Schuffner 's dots have never been seen , hut in some instances ( Plate 4 , figs. 5 , 6 , and 7 ) pseudopodia were seen with a scar in the red cell recalling the formation of Maurer 's dots in Laverania malarice of man .
The forms of trophozoite shown in Plate 4 , figs. 6 to 12 , are , so far as our experience goes , unique , first in the dense blue-staining ( Giemsa ) of the protoplasm , and , secondly , the great enlargement and marked paleness of the red cell with absence of Schuffner 's dots , and the intense concentration of the portion of red cell in the food vacuole .
This concentration , as will be seen in the figures , proceeds until nothing is left but a block of gamboge-yellow pigment ( Plate 4 , figs. 14 to 16 ) .
The distended red cells are so delicate that they are frequently ruptured in making the film , as is shown in Plate 5 , figs. 7 and 8 .
The great size of the parasite is also remarkable , some of the free merozoites measuring 4 microns by 3'5 microns , the exact size of a normal red cell of the antelope .
A full grown schizont , before cleavage of the protoplasm , measures 10 microns by 10 microns ( Plate 4 , fig. 19 ) .
The presence in the gametocytes of numerous deeply staining chromatin granules , in addition to the faintly stained nucleus , is also remarkable .
The arrangement of these granules in some of the merozoites suggests a relationship with the Hcemofiagellata ( Plate 4 , figs. 3 and 23 ) ; and in this connection it may be mentioned that one duiker was also naturally infected writli a trypanosome of non-pathogenic type , which it is proposed to describe in a future paper .
In films taken some days and even months after the acute attack , the forms shown in Plate 5 , figs. 12 to 16 , are common , and but for the presence of pigment might be mistaken for faintly stained leucocytes .
As these are the most persistent forms ( macrogametocytes ) , attention is directed to them , as they are the forms likely to be met with in examination of blood films of antelope taken in the field .
One of the small duikers appeared out of condition for a few days , while the parasites were numerous in the blood : coat staring , nose hot and dry ; but it soon regained its health , and has remained healthy since .
The other duiker was apparently not at all affected , although a few parasites could be found in its blood for some six months .
The duiker which was chronically infected was captured in the low country near the Lake shore , and was about three months old when brought to Kasu Hill , where a few weeks later a few parasites were found in its blood .
It is therefore probable that it was infected before capture .

As it developed an acute attack a few weeks after it had been placed in the same enclosure with the infected duiker , it would appear that in its case the infection was contracted locally .
The two antelope were first found to be infected in the height of the dry season ( October ) , and although a systematic search was made for adult or larval mosquitoes , none could be trapped or found in or near the enclosure .
In the same compound there were also another yoiyig duiker , a young reedbuck , and a young hartebeeste , and although the blood of these animals was examined frequently , no malarial parasites could be found .
If this parasite should prove to be a new one , the name of Plasmodium cephalophi is proposed for it .
