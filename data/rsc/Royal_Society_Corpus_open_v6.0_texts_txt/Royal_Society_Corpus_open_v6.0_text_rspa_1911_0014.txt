) * We assume that if two quadric surfaces have common two intersecting generators , their remaining common points lie upon a plane .
This is capable of simple geometrical proof .
Further , we prove a subsidiary theorem regarding eight straight which we name 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , , which satisfy certain conditions .
These conditions first that in the ] elne 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' 4 ' , each line intersects the three which are not in the same row or column of the as itself ( so that the lines call be arranged as two skew quadrilaterals , with the property that each side of either intersects a particulal ' side of the other and second that one of the two lines which can be drawn to , 4'\mdash ; say \mdash ; intersects one of the two lines which can be drawn to meet 1 , 2 , , 4\mdash ; say .
The collditions for the eight lines are then briefly expressible as the existence of a scheme 1 ' 2 ' 'Roy .

If and be the common generators , intersecting in ariable plane through will touch the respectively , say , in and , on , and the ranges } , will be projective with the pencil ; these ranges have the cummon point , and will thus have auother c.ommon point , say , lying on .
Similarly , let be the point of other than , at which the quadrics touch .
If now be any common point of the two quadrics not on or , the plane A cuts the surfaces respectively in conics having H comnlon and touching at A and B. These conics thus coincide in one , which ) constitutes the curve of intersection of ) quadrics .

Geometrical Proof of the [ Nov. 21 , where as before each of the ten lines of this scheme meets every line not in the same row or column of the scheme as itself .
Then , denoting the point where the line meets the plane containing the three points , 1 , 4 by ; 23 ' , 2'3 , 14 and so on , the subsidiary theorem is that the three points ; 31 ' , 3'1,24 , 1'2,34 are collinear , and the line 4 passes through these three points .
To prove this subsidiary theorem , consider the quadric surface constructed to have the three skew lines 1 , 2 , , as generators , say the quadric ; and with it consider the quadric These quadrics have common the two intersecting generators , .
Their common points not lying on these common generators are therefore coplanar .
Two such common points are 1 , and .
But in fact the lines 3 ' and 4 ' are generators of the quadric , because they meet each of the lines 1 , 2 , ; and similarly the lines : and 4 are generators of the quadric Thus , two further points of the two quadrics , not lying.on the lines or , are and Hence , the four points are coplanar .
Similarly , the four points are coplanar , and so are the four points ( 3 , 1 , .
This proves that the line 4 passes the three points ; 31 ' , 3'1 , 24 ; 12 ' , 1'2 , 34 which is the subsidiary theorem .
We can now proceed to the theorem of a double six of lines .
This theorem is that if 11 lines be in relations expressible by the scheme 1 2 3 4 o 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' 4 ' 5 ' 6 wherein each line intersects those not lying in the same row or column of the scheme as itself , then there exists a line intersecting 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , .
' ( a ) The given scheme includes as part of itself the scheme 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' 5 ' 6 ' Let the line , other than 4 , which meets 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , 5 ' be called , so that we have a scheme of conditions 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' 5 ' 6 ' The eight lines 1 , 2 , 3 , , are thus in relations such as those considered in the subsidiary theorem .
Hence the three points ; 23 ' , 2'3 , 16 ; 31 ' , 3'1 , 26 are collinear , and the line may be defined as the line containing these : 1910 .
] Theorem of Double Six of Lines .
( b ) The given scheme of 11 lines contains also as part of itself the scheme 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' Let the line , other than 5 , which meets 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , 4 ' , be called , so that we have the scheme of conditions 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' The eight lines 1 , , 3 , are therefore in relations such as those considered in the subsidiar.y , theorem .
Thus the three points all lie on the line Thus , which meets 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , coincides with which meets 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , 4 ' ; namely , there exists a line meeting 1 ' , 2 ' , , as was to be shown .
If this line be c.alled 6 , and the line joining the points , be called [ 1 , 2 ] , we have incidentally shown that the line [ 1 , 2 ] meets the six lines [ 3 , 4 ] , [ 3 , 5 ] , [ 3 , 6 ] , [ 4 , 5 ] , [ 4 , 6 ] , [ 5 , 6 ] .
If be the line of intersection of the plane of the lines 1 , 2 ' with the plane of the lines 1 ' , 2 , the argument equally shows that intersects .
It is only necessary to put plane for point , and point for plane throughout ; in particular two quadrics with a pair of intersecting generators common , have a common enveloping quadric cone .
We have considered in the subsidiary theorem a set of lines satisfying conditions of the type and further subject to the unsymmetrical condition that one of the two lines which meet 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , intersects one of the two lines which meet 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , 4 ' .
It appears now that in such case the other hne which meets 1 , 2 , 4 , intersects the other live which meets 1 ' , ) ) , and that this deduction is another form of the theorem of a double six of lines .

] Conversely consider eight lines satisfying ihed by the scheme with the further condition that the four points 12 ' , 1'2 , 34 ' , are coplanar ; such a set of lines depends on 19 constants .
Then it can be shown : ( a ) That either of the lines meeting 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , meets one of the meeting 1 ' , 2 ' , 3 ' , 4 ' , ( b ) that the points 31 ' , 3'1 , 24 ' , 2'4 , are coplanar , ( c ) that the points 23 ' , , are coplanar , ( d ) that , if VOL. LXXXlV .

and so on , the four lines are concurrent , say , in ; the four lines are concurrent , say , in ; and the four lines are concurrent , say , in , ( e ) that if denote the line of intersection of the planes 12 ' and 1'2 , and so on , the lines , meet in , the lines , meet in 02 , the lines , meet in .
The demonstrations of these results are as follows:\mdash ; Draw one of the two lines which meet 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , say , 5 ' , and then draw the unique line , other than 1 , which meets , calling this line 6 ; consider then the two quadric surfaces ( 643 ) and ; these will have the common generators 6 and 5 ' ; of the quadric two generators are 1 and 2 ; of the quadric ( 643 ) one generator is 2 ' .
As the common points of these quadrics which do not lie on 5 ' or 6 are coplanar , their plane is that determined by the points 34 ' , 3'4 , 12 ' ; the generator 2 of ) , which already meets on 5 ' , meets ( 643 ) in one other point lying on this plane .
Now the plane of 34 ' , 3'4 , 12 ' , meets 2 in the point 1'2 ; this point is therefore on ( 643 ) .
The points 1'3 and 1'4 are , however , also on ( 643 ) ; hence the line 1 ' is a generator of ( 643 ) and meets 6 ; as was to be proved .
( b ) The line lies plane hence meets ; it lies in the plane 3'2 , and hence meets ; thus it passes through the intersection of with .
Again , the line lies in the plane 32 ' , and hence meets ; it lies in the plane 1'4 , and hence meets ; thus it passes also through the intersection of with .
So that the points , are coplanar .
( c ) The line lies in the plane 24 ' and hence meets ; it lies in the plane 3'1 and hence meets ; thus it passes through the intersection of with line lies in the plane 31 ' and hence meets and lies in the plane 2'4 , and hence meets ; thus it also passes through the intersection of with So that the points 23 ' , 2'3 , 14 ' , 1'4 are coplanar .
( d ) The line lies in the plane 21 ' and hence meets ; it lies in the plane 3'4 and hence meets and thus passes through the intersection of with Again line lies in the plane 2'1 and hence meets ; it lies in the plane 34 ' and hence 1910 .
] Theorem of Double of Straight Lines meets thus also passes through intersection with This establishes the existence of the points ( e ) The plane 12 ' , as containing the points 13 ' , 2'4 , contains the line ; this same plane 12 ' , as containing the points 14 ' , 2'3 , contains the line through 03 .
Again the plane 1'2 , as the points 1'3 , 24 ' , contains the line through 03 , and , as containing the points 1'4 , 23 ' , contains the line through .
The line , in which the planes 12 ' , 1'2 intersect , thus passes through .
So the line C34 passes .
The point has thus a correspondence with the plane of 12 ' , 1'2 , 34 ' , 3'4 , which contains the lines [ 1 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 4 ] , respectively defined as and .
Similarly for the points and It from the above that if we regard the planes of , as rectangular , meeting in , and the plane as lying at infinity , the four intersections , of the pairs of the eight lines 1 , 2 , , 3 ' , 4 ' , which lie in any one of the three rectangular planes , form a rectangle , with sides parallel to two of the axes such a rectangle is constituted for exalnple by the points 23 ' , 1'4 , 2'3 , 14 ' , lying in .
It is proved above that the line [ 56 ] , joining the points meets each of [ 23 ] , , which are the diagonals of the rectangle in the plane ; thus the centres of the three rectangles lie in one straight line [ 56 ] .
It is easy now to see that the points , , , in which the lines 1 , 2 , , 4 ' meet the plane at infinity , are the projections from of the corners a rectangular parallelopiped whose edges parallel to the rectangular axes .
Hence the four lines , are concurrent .
It can be shown that their point of concurrence lies on [ 56 ] .
Dually , if the line , defined as the intersection of the planes 56 ' , which is also the line of tersection of the three planes , , , be joined to the point by a plane , this plane cuts the of lines ( 1 , 1 ( 2 , 2 ( 3 , 3 ( 4 , 4 in four pairs of points , each pair being collinear with As the tetrahedron ives rise to these relations , I have formed the equation of the cubic surface containing the lines , and find that it may be put into the form , when / 7 , , are the co-ordinates referred to this tetrahedron , where ) .
And with this , when the co-ordinates of a line are defined by the equations , the line 4 is , the line 4 ' is obtained 602 Proof of the Theorem of a Double Six of Straight Lines .
from this by replacing , by , the line 1 by replacing by , the line 1 ' by replacing , by , and similarly for 2 , 2 ' , and 3 , 3 ' .
The line is then , and the line [ 56 ] is .
The whole figure reciprocates itself in regard to the quadric .
Of this cubic surface fifteen lines are determined rationally , namely , 1 , 2 , 3 ' , 4 ' , , the remaining twelve , , which form a double six , depend upon a single square root .
