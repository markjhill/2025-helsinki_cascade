" Note on a Method of viewing the Solar Prominences without an Eclipse .
" By WILLIAM HUGGINS , F.R.S. ReceivedFebruary 16 , 1869 .
Last Saturday , February 13 , I succeeded in seeing a solar prominence so as to distinguish its form .
A spectroscope was used ; a narrow slit was inserted after the train of prisms before the object-glass of the little telescope .
This slit limited the light entering the telescope to that of the refrangibility of the part of the spectrum immediately about the bright line coincident with C. The slit of the spectroscope was then widened sufficiently to admit the form of the prominence to be seen .
The spectrum then became so impure that the prominence could not be distinguished .
A great part of the light of the refrangibilities removed far from that of C was then absorbed by a piece of deep ruby glass .
The prominence was then distinctly perceived , something of this form .
[ Feb. 18 , o03 A more detailed account is not now given , as I think I shall be able to modify the method so as to make the outline of these objects more easily visible .
