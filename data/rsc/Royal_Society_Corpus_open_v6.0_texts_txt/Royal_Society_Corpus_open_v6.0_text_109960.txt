Particulars respecting the Anatomy of the Dugong , intended as a Supplement to Sir T. S. Raffles 's Accoutnt of that Animal .
By Sir Everard Home , Bart. F.R.S. Read June 29,1820 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1820 , p. 315 .
] The object of this communication is to complete the anatomical description of the Dugong , already presented to the Society by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles , who has sent the author a young female animal entire , together with the viscera and skeleton of a male .
Drawings representing the external form of the animal , and of its several parts , are annexed .
Sir Everard particularly describes the peculiar structure of the stomach of this animal , which differs from all others , and is so complex that description is scarcely intelligible without the aid of a drawing .
In some respects it resembles that of the whale , the peccari , hippopotamus , and beaver ; at least it contains parts met with in the stomach of those tribes , but the parts are differently situated .
