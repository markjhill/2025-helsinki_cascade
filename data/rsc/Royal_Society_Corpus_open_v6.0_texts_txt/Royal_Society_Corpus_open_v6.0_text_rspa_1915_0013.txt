) ( Abstract .
) An analytical solution of the general equations of electrodynamics is obtained for the case of waves generated by a vibrating doublet in presence of a conducting sphere , and is adapted to obtain the known solution for perfect conduction , and the correction for moderate resistance , such as that of sea-water .
The known solution is expressed by the sum of a series involving zonal harmonics , and the correction by a similar series .
Different results have been obtained by different writers who have investigated the numerical value of the former sum .
In the paper a new method of summing the series is explained , and worked out in detail for the wave-length 5 km .
In the case of perfect conduction the result confirms that found by H. M. Macdonald.* The effect of resistance is found to be a slight increase of the strength of the signals at considerable distances , counteracting to some small extent the enfeebling effect of the curvature of the surface .
A comparison is instituted between the results of the theory and those of recorded experiments .
From these it had previously been inferred that the diffraction theory fails to account for the facts ; but , after a discussion of the experimental evidence , it appears that the observations may admit of a different interpretation , according to which the results of the diffraction theory would be in good agreement with those of daylight observations at great distances .
