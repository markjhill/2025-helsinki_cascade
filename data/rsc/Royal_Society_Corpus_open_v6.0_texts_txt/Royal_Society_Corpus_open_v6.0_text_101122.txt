Two Observations made by P. Francesco Lana , the Author of the Prodromus premised to Art Maestra* , concerning some of the effects of the Burning Concave of Lions ; and also an odd Salt extracted out of a Metallic substance : Taken out of the same Venetian Journal .
* Spoken of in Numb. 69 .
THe first is , That the said Fr. Lana having been informed , that that famous Burning Concave , not long since made by M. de Vilette , did much sooner melt Iron , than Gold or Silver ; he esteems it worth considering , why a Kitchin-fire doth the contrary , melting Gold sooner than Iron ?
Whether it proceeds thence , that the Astral heat of the Sun is dryer than our common fire , having much humidity in it ; whence Gold being moister than Iron , may more resist the dry celestial heat of the Sun , than Iron and the rest of the dryer Metals can do ?
Or , Whether Gold , being of all Metals we know of , the longest a producing and perfecting by the Solar heat , so it is also longest a dissolving by the same ?
&amp;c. The other is , that the said P. Lana , having extracted out of a Metallic Substance a very white Salt , the same was , upon the application of the gentlest heat , resolved into a Goldencolour 'd liquor ; which being removed from that warmth , as soon as it felt the cool Air , and even by opening the Glass wherein it was enclosed , did in a moment shoot afresh into the same Salt ; and that ( which seemed oddest ) whilst he was pouring it out of one glass into another during its fluidity , it was dispersed all over the glass it was poured into , suddenly congealing into most fine threads , many of which were extended from one side of the glass to the other , and , hanging as 'twere in the Air , formed just like the subtilest Cob-webs , not at all rigid , but , by reason of their exquisite subtlety , pliable , and scarce perceivable by the Eye .
