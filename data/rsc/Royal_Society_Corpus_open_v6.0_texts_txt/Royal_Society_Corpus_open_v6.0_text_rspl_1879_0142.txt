[ May 27 , less , I am able , after many years of labour , to give an account of the adult skull in seventy kinds , and of the larval\#151 ; in one or several stages\#151 ; in a good number of the species .
The illustrations are , for the most part , put in a similar manner in all the plates ; and , as to size , I have not made the skulls of the dwarf kinds much less than those of the large types .
I am satisfied that these figures and descriptions will be fonnd useful , not merely for comparison of the types of larval and adult Batrachian skulls one with another , but I believe that they will throw light upon , and in turn be illuminated by , all that we can learn of the structure and development of the skull in the other types of V ertebrata .
With regard to the geographical distribution of the Batrachia , there are many things of importance which I have rather hinted at than expressed in this paper .
There is a sort of facies or character about the allied types of any great geographical region which makes me satisfied that certain external characters repeat themselves again and again in different parts of the world .
Thus , the types of frogs that have dilated toes are evidently more nearly related to those with pointed toes of the same region than they are even to the broad-toed types of some distant region .
I should be inclined to derive the narrow-backed tree frogs of Australia from the sharp-toed frogs of the same region ; the same with those of India , and the same with those of the nearctic and neotropical territories .
The true frogs ( " Ranidae " ) of India have many things in common , , as also have the true frogs of North America ; the same may be said of the sub-typical frogs , or " Cystignathidae .
" On the whole , the European and Indian territories yield the highest kinds ; Australia and South America the lowest and most generalized .

" On the Relation of the Urea to the Total Nitrogen of the Urine in Disease .
No. I. " By W. J. Russell , Ph. D. , F.R.S. , and Samuel West , M.B. Oxon .
Received May 6 , 1880 .
In the valuable series of papers upon the excretion of urea , communicated by Professor Parkes to the Royal Society , he showed that in health 90 per cent , of the nitrogen in the urine , was eliminated in the form of urea .
It seemed to us of considerable interest and importance to ascertain whether in disease this statement still held good , or whether , as indeed seemed probable , under altered conditions , On the Urine in Disease .
1880 .
] nitrogen might not be excreted in some other form .
With the view of determining this point , the following experiments were undertaken .
The cases upon which the observations were made fall into two groups\#151 ; the first , a series taken at random from the hospital , the patients suffering from various diseases , and being under various conditions as regarded diet , muscular exertion , \amp ; c. In the second series , the patients were healthy , and placed under conditions as far as possible constant , the amount of diet being fixed , and the patients at absolute rest .
; The quantitative^ estimations were made in the following way .
The nitrogen in the urea was determined by the process which we have previously described , * in which the urea is decomposed by sodic hypo-bromite , and the volume of nitrogen evolved is measured .
At first , the total nitrogen was determined by the soda-lime process , but finding that in some cases this method was untrustworthy , we abandoned it , and in all the following experiments the total nitrogen was estimated by burning the residue with oxide of copper , and measuring over water the volume of nitrogen obtained .
This volume was of course afterwards corrected for temperature and pressure .
In most cases , 5 cub. centims. of the urine was used .
This was very slightly acidulated by adding a small crystal of pure oxalic acid , and evaporated as rapidly as possible in a small basin on a water-bath , nearly to dryness .
The residue was thoroughly incorporated with oxide of copper , introduced into a combustion tube , and the basin thoroughly cleaned with fresh portions of oxide .
In order to ascertain whether any loss of ammonia occurred during the evaporation , control experiments were made by adding , without previous evaporation , a second sample of 5 cub. centims. of the urine to oxide of copper already in a combustion tube , and proceeding with the combustion slowly , but in the ordinary way .
The same amount of nitrogen was obtained by both processes .
Although the determination of the nitrogen was the special object of our research , we thought it well in each case to complete the analysis by determining the amount of solid matter in solution , and from it approximately the amount of organic and inorganic matter , as well as the amount of chlorine , and the specific gravity .
To determine the solid matter in solution , 5 cub. centims. of the filtered urine was evaporated to dryness in a small light platinum dish , and heated to 110\#151 ; 120 ' , till the weight remained constant .
The residue varied very much in appearance , sometimes it was hard and granular , at others remaining in a sticky condition .
The residue was heated to dull redness over a lamp , and what remained we have called inorganic residue .
It was found in some cases impossible to completely burn away all carbonaceous matter * " Journal of Chemical Society , " 1874 .

without raising the temperature to such a point that chloride of sodium would be volatilised .
The weight , however , of carbon remaining in these cases was exceedingly small .
The amount of chlorine in the urine was ascertained by dissolving this residue in water , and adding a standard solution of silver nitrate .
Obviously , these latter determinations are not of the same degree of accuracy as are those of the nitrogen .
Still they strikingly point out the variations in the compositiln of these urines , and give important comparable results .
The first series ( Table I ) , consisting of twenty-three observations , falls into several small groups .
The relation of the urea-nitrogen to the total nitrogen was , in all cases , calculated out in percentage amounts ( the total nitrogen being taken as 100 ) , and the mean of each group of observations given .
The first group ( Table II ) consists of six cases of pneumonia , and in these the urea-nitrogen represents 90 per cent , of the total nitrogen* The second , of two cases of jaundice , with two determinations in each .
The mean of the first giving 85*7 per cent. ; of the second , 902 per cent. The third , of two cases of albuminuria , in which the mean is 86 per cent. In these observations , the albumen was previously precipitated and removed .
In a third case the determination was made without previously removing the albumen .
In this latter , the percentage was 68 6 .
The fourth group consists of a collection of cases of various kinds .
One of pyaemia , one of typhoid fever , rheumatic fever , acute dysentery , pleurisy , hepatic abscess , and leucocythgemia , two of erysipelas , and two of diabetes , making eleven in all .
The mean percentage of them all is 93-8 .
The lowest percentage in this first series is found in the cases of albuminuria , and of jaundice , a fact of interest as bearing upon the place of production of urea .
The second series consists of eighteen determinations made upon three cases , in which the diet was fixed , and the patient in a condition of absolute rest ( of .
Table III ) .
These give a mean of 90T per cent. The mean of all the cases in the two series is 89*3 , or , if the cases of albuminuria and jaundice be excluded , ,91*3 per cent. , and this agrees almost exactly with the results of Professor Parkes ' experiments , in which the mean arrived at is 91 per cent. If a calculation be made from the tables given in books of the amounts of the urinary constituents in a normal urine , the urea is found to represent about 96 per cent , of the total nitrogen , or if allowance * It is worthy of note that in none of these cases is the percentage of urea high ; a fact to which attention has been drawn in a previous paper .

] be made for the nitrogen contained in the pigments and extractives , which are usually not specified , the real percentage would be somewhat lower .
, i We may , therefore , assume that the urea-nitrogen may be taken as the measure of the total nitrogen , and that this may be approximately determined by adding 10 per cent , to the amount of urea-nitrogen .
This is , however , only true if the mean of a large number of observations be taken , for there is no fixed relation between , on the one hand , the amount of the urine and the amount of the solids in it , or on the other , between the amount of the various solids inter se .
These all vary independently in great measure of one another , and subject to no law which is at present determined , and stranger still , the relation of the urea-nitrogen to the total nitrogen , even in the same urine on closely consecutive days , is not constant , as the following table shows:\#151 ; I.

If , then , such variations occur when the conditions are constant , they will certainly be not less where the conditions vary.* Such variations render it necessary to be specially cautious in drawing conclusions from the results of a few experiments , and may explain the great difference in the observations of different investigators .
Besides the nitrogen , we determined , as we have already stated , the solid residue , the ash , and the chlorine .
Of the chlorine , little can be said .
Its variations are inexplicable , for although they in part depend upon the amount of chlorine ingested in the food , they seem subject to other influences which we do not at present comprehend .
The same may be said of the solid residue , and of the ash , and we can do little more than point to the great and irregular variations in the amowot of each , which the tables show .
The result then of our observations-is to prove that the chemistry of the urine remains essentially the same in disease as in health , and that the generalisation of Professor Parks is true in either case .

Y. " On the Amount of Nitrogen excreted in the Urine by Man at Rest .
No. II .
" By Samuel West , M.B. Oxon .
, and W. J. RUSSELL , Ph. D. , F.R.S. Received May 6 , 1880 .
Two methods of investigation have been adopted in inquiries of this kind .
The first by stopping the ingestion of nitrogen , either by absolute deprivation of food , i.e. , by starvation , or by the giving of non-nitrogenous food .
The second by reducing the ordinary diet to the lowest possible 'limit compatible with health .
To the first objection may be made that the experiments are violent , and cannot be long maintained , and that they subject the body to most abnormal conditions .
Such violence to the ordinary chemistry of the body produces its evidence in the excretions .
The nitrogen in the urine under these circumstances varying even more irregularly and widely than under normal conditions , and the short possible duration of the experiments rendering the conclusions drawn , from the small number of Observations , unsatisfactory .
From all these objections the second course of investigation is free , no violence is done to the body , and the observations may be prolonged * " Pathol .
