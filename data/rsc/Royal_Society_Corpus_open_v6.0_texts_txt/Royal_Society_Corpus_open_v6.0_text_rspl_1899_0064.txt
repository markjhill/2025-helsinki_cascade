suggesting that it is not capable of living a long time free from the colony , and the character of the cytoplasm indicating that when the ovum is set free it is very buoyant , and is probably fertilised and passes through the early stages of its development suspended in the water .
It is almost certain that the medusa does not digest food and nourish the ova after its escape from the ampulla , and I am inclined to believe that after a few pulsations which are sufficient to carry it away from the region of the colony , the ova are set free and the medusa dies .
v Correction.\#151 ; In a former communication to the Royal Society ( 4 ) , I described certain cells in the coenosarc of Millepore from Celebes as ova .
Since the discovery of the female medusa , I have carefully re-examined my preparations , and satisfied myself that I made a mistake .
These cells are not ova , but the cells which ultimately give rise to the large kind of nematocyst .

It has been proved by one of us in a previous paper* that the vapour-density of bromine is normal up to a temperature of 279 ' C. , a result in entire opposition to the numbers obtained by J. J. Thomson . !
We have now determined the densities at temperatures ranging from about 600 ' C. to 1050 ' C. by a modification of the former method , the chief difference being that the globe was not filled with the vapour by boiling out the excess of liquid , as in the usual method , but by admitting the bromine , already in the form of vapour , to the globe which remained in the furnace throughout the experiment .

of a capacity of about a litre , in others of about 250 c.c. ; its stem , of about 1 mm. bore , was cemented by means of a mixture of litharge and glycerine , to a cup on the capillary tube carrying a ; B a muffle furnace , C a glass globe of about 200 c.c. capacity , placed in a water-bath ; D and E absorption apparatus F a large globe of about 8 litres capacity for steadying the pressure ; G a pressure gauge ; H a thermoelectric couple of platinum and platinum-rhodium enclosed in a porcelain tube ; K the " cold junction , " each wire of the couple being connected with a copper wire and placed in a test-tube containing alcohol , the two tubes standing in a beaker of water ; L the galvanometer , which , with M , the resistance box and switch , and N , the scale and lamp , were in an adjoining room .
P is a Bunsen valve to prevent back-rush of water from the pump ; a , e , / , Jc , and l are stopcocks , a , b , and d being diagonal three-way stopcocks arranged so that air could be admitted from the outside in the directions shown by the arrows .
These stopcocks were obtained from Messrs. C. E. Muller and Co. , and have proved extremely satisfactory .
The lubricant used on a , b , and c , which came into contact with liquid bromine , was phosphorus pentoxide which had become viscous by exposure to the air .
Further action of the air was prevented by a covering of burnt rubber and vaseline .
Method of Procedure .
Filling the Globe.\#151 ; The small globe C containing bromine was heated by means of the water-bath to about 60 ' C. , i.e. , about the boiling point of bromine under atmospheric pressure .
The globe A was exhausted by means of a water air pump , through the connections shown , to about one-sixth of an atmosphere , sometimes less .
The stopcock d was then closed , and b and c opened to admit bromine into the globe A , the connecting tubes being warmed by means of a Bunsen burner to prevent the condensation of bromine in them .
After a short interval ( 15 to 30 secs .
) bwas closed and opened ; the globe was exhausted to about the same extent as before , and all the bromine carried off was absorbed by strong caustic soda solution placed in the absorption tube and flasks D and E. ( The arrangement of the flasks shown in the figure was found to be a very convenient one ; it consists of two small wash-bottles with the long tubes connected , or in one piece ; by this arrangement the liquid was never carried over in either direction .
) The large globe F was usually kept exhausted and the pump at work .
If necessary the globe A could be connected directly with the pump by turning off stopcock h. The globe was again put into connection with C , again exhausted , and so on , the filling process being repeated seven times .
Some broVapour-density of Bromine High Temperatures .
13 mine was then allowed to condense above the stopcock a , and the stopcock b was opened to the air ; a was then turned on , when usually a little bromine entered , and finally began to blow out on reaching the hot neck of the globe ; a was then turned off , and the tubes between b , and d cleared of bromine by a current of air , a was again turned on for a few seconds , and the tubes cleared again ; this was repeated until no more bromine was seen to come out on opening the stopcock .
During this process the neck of the globe and the stopcock were kept warm by heating with a Bunsen burner ; considerable difficulty was sometimes experienced in getting the stopcock free from bromine .
The globe was thus filled with bromine vapour at the atmospheric pressure and the temperature of the furnace ; the latter was read on the galvanometer scale at the moment of opening the stopcock a for the last time .
The stopcock c was then closed , and the bromine removed from the tube be by repeated exhaustion .
The bromine in the globe C was thus cut off from the rest of the apparatus by the exhausted space be .
Absorption and Estimation of the Bromine.\#151 ; A strong solution of potassium iodide was placed in the tube and flasks D and E , and the globe A was exhausted to about one-sixth atmosphere as in the filling , the bromine drawn off being caught by the potassium iodide .
Air was then admitted to the globe through b , and the exhaustion repeated .
After the seventh exhaustion the tube was washed out through the stopcocks e and f , and the solution added to that from the flasks E , and titrated with a standard sodium thiosulphate solution of about N/ 5 strength .
The solution was standardised by means of pure bromine weighed in small bulbs and dissolved in potassium iodide solution .
When a series of determinations was made at different pressures , the globe was filled in the usual way , and then slowly exhausted to the required amount , the bromine drawn off being absorbed by potassium iodide solution as usual , except that the absorption flasks were replaced by a straight tube with two small bulbs blown in it containing some of the solution ; this arrangement was to obviate the back pressure caused by the solution in the flasks .
The residual amount of bromine was drawn off as before described .
Determination of Temperature.\#151 ; The thermo-electric couple was standardised by means of boiling selenium and solidifying potassium sulphate .
The latter was melted in a small porcelain crucible by means of the oxygen-gas flame ; the porcelain was not appreciably attacked if the operation was conducted quickly .
The galvanometer , a dead-beat d'Arsonval , was obtained from Messrs. Nalder Bros. , and had a resistance of about 200 ohms ; the focal length of the mirror was 40 inches .
In order to bring the zero point and the reading for the highest temperature employed upon the scale , it was necessary to introduce a resistance of 11,000 ohms , which remained in the circuit Dr. E. P. Perinan and G. A. S. Atkinson .
during the whole of the experiments .
With this arrangement one scale division was equivalent to about 2 ' C. The porcelain tube containing the couple was supported by asbestos some distance above the floor of the muffle .
The variation of temperature between the floor and the top of the muffle was found to be 6 ' C. at a temperature of about 600 ' C. , and 8 ' C. at 900 ' C. ; no correction was made for this difference as the couple was near the level of the centre of the globe .
Between the two fixed points obtained the scale reading was taken to be proportional to the difference of temperature , according .to the method used by Roberts-Austen .
Determination of Pressure.\#151 ; The pressure was read off on a standard barometer , or on the pressure gauge G in the case of pressures less than atmospheric .
Capacity of the Globe.\#151 ; The porcelain globe was weighed full of air , and again weighed , filled with water , and the capacity calculated .
The filling with water was effected by repeated exhaustion and letting in water .
Preparation of Pure Bromine.\#151 ; Commercial bromine was purified by one of the processes previously employed , viz. , by boiling with potassium bromide , distilling over red-hot manganese dioxide , shaking with strong sulphuric acid , and re-distilling .
The greater portion came over at a perfectly constant temperature , 58*9 ' C. at a pressure of 761 mm. ( Cf .

Chief Possible Sources of Error .
( 1 ) Error infilling and emptying Globe.\#151 ; To avoid error in filling the globe was exhausted and filled with bromine seven times , as mentioned above .
Each exhaustion being to at least one-sixth atmosphere , the volume of the residual air would be theoretically QJ , i.e. , less than 1/ 250,000 of the volume of the globe .
Similar remarks apply to the emptying .
As a practical test , a glass globe was filled in the manner described , and on opening it under water , only a negligible amount of air was found to be present .
( 2 ) The Low Temperature of the Stem.\#151 ; An approximate correction for this was made in the following manner :\#151 ; Let v = volume of globe .
8 = vapour-density of bromine in globe .
T = absolute temperature of globe .
v\ S ' , T = corresponding quantities for the stem .
D = apparent vapour-density .
Then 8 = D -*.(*1 _ v \ f The maximum correction thus calculated is only 0*4 .
( 3 ) Loss of Bromine by Incomplete Absorption.\#151 ; Tine potassium iodide solution in the small bulbs of the absorption apparatus E remained uncoloured , showing that the absorption was practically complete .
( 4 ) Leakage at the Stopcocks.\#151 ; In the earlier experiments ordinary stopcocks were used , and were found to leak to such an extent as to be useless for the purpose .
Well-made diagonal stopcocks were then employed and were found quite trustworthy .
( 5 ) Error in Temperature Determinations.\#151 ; It is very difficult to say what the maximum error is ; we think it to be not more than 10 ' , if so much .
The chief source of uncertainty was the drift of the zero of the galvanometer ; this was reduced to a minimum by switching in just before taking a reading .
( 6 ) Expansion of the Porcelain Globe .
A correction was made for this , the coefficient of expansion found by Deville and Troost , 0-0000108 , being used .
This gives practically the same result at the temperatures considered as the formula of T. G. Bedford ( British Association , 1899 ) .
General Conclusions.\#151 ; The results at atmospheric pressure have been plotted against temperature ( see Curve I ) .
From this it appears that the vapour-density of bromine is normal up to about 750 ' C. ; at this point dissociation becomes appreciable and gradually increases with rise of temperature .
At 1050 ' C. the density falls to 75-25 .
Vapour-density of Bromine at High Temperatures .
17 The constants of dissociation were calculated as follows :\#151 ; Taking the fundamental equation ujuf = cfc , where u and are the number of molecules per unit volume of Br2 and Bri respectively , and c and cx the velocities of dissociation and recombination , we have , after reduction , axx _ 40T(D - 40 ) c P(80 - D)2 7 ( saj)\gt ; where a is the number of molecules per unit volume of any gas under standard conditions .

( Abstract .
) The recent blue coral Heliopora presents striking resemblances in structure to the palaeozoic Heliolites .
All the earlier writers on corals .accordingly regarded the two genera as intimately allied .
But some later authorities consider the resemblances as accidental , and that the corals have no special affinities .
Thus , according to F. Bernard , Heliopara and Heliolites belong to distinct subphyla .
Lindstrom admits only one species of Heliopora , and regards the genus as quite isolated , .as essentially distinct in structure from , and as further separated from the latter by " the total absence of all connecting links irom the end of the middle Devonian to the recent times .
The author , however , considers that the original view of the close affinity of Heliopora and Heliolites is correct , that the two genera are essentially .similar in structure , and that they are linked by a series of eocene and cretaceous corals .
Amongst these fossils is the genus Polytremacis , which is redescribed , and a new species of Heliopora frofh the Cretaceous of Somaliland .
It is suggested that Heliopora has descended from the palaeozoic Heliolitidae by degeneration in size and increase in number .of the ccenenchymal caeca .
