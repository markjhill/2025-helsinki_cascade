) In the * Proceedings * of the Royal Society ( B , vol. 81 , 1909 ) a paper was published describing a single experiment illustrating the development of Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina pa .
This experiment was carried out at Mpumu , Uganda , near Lake Victoria , in the spring of 1909 .
Since that date many experiments , on the same lines , have been made , not only with Trypanosoma gambiense but also with Trypanosoma dimorphon , Trypanosoma nanum , and Trypanosoma vivax* It is proposed to describe these further experiments in this paper .
It will be remembered that Kleine , in German East Africa , at the end of 1908 , made the discovery that Glossina could convey Trypanosoma brucei for some 50 days after the fly had fed on an infected animal .
Following Kleine 's lead , our experiments were carried out , at first with Lake-shore flies , afterwards with flies bred in the laboratory .
A. The Development of Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina palpalis caught on the Lake-shore .
These experiments were carried out with ordinary wild tsetse flies caught on the Lake-shore , and therefore open to the doubt that some of them may have been naturally infected when they were captured .
As there is some evidence that one fly in 400 or 500 of the wild Lake-shore flies is found to be naturally infected , it is evident that these previously infected flies may lead into error .
It will be seen later that this risk is not run when flies bred in the laboratory are used .
The flies when brought up from the Lake-shore were kept in small boxes , with mosquito-netting sides , and placed over dishes containing water , to imitate , as far as possible , their natural conditions .
It may be remarked here that these tsetse flies are so numerous on the shores of Victoria Uyanza , and the supply so unending , that the fly-boys brought up some 500 every day , and these usually caught at only one or two spots .
* These names may require to be changed , when the trypanosomes affecting domestic animals in Uganda come to be described .
The Development of Trypanosomes in Tsetse Flies .
369 The method of carrying out these experiments was always the same .
The flies were fed for some days on a highly infected monkey , whose blood on microscopical examination was seen to contain numerous trypanosomes of Sleeping Sickness , and afterwards on a series of healthy monkeys .
The following table gives the number of flies used in each experiment , the number of days they were fed on a monkey whose blood contained Trypanosoma gambiense , the number of days which elapsed before the flies became infective , and the number of days the flies remained infective .
The minus signs signify that the flies failed to become infected , or at least failed to infect ; or , in other words , that the experiment was negative .

In the positive experiments 880 flies were used , an average of 126 ; in the negative 960 , an average of 137 .
The shortest time * which elapsed before a fly became infective was 18 days , the longest 45 days , and the average 32 days .
It .
may be well to give some of these experiments more in detail , in order to show the methods used , and draw attention to various interesting points .

Remarks.\#151 ; These 60 Lake-shore or wild flies , although fed on an infected monkey for three days , failed to convey the infection to healthy monkeys .
As the flies died they were dissected .
Only in one were flagellates found , and these appeared to be of the Trypanosoma arayi type .
An emulsion was made of the contents of the alimentary canal of this fly and injected into monkey 914 .
Monkey 914 never showed trypanosomes in its blood , although kept under observation for a month .

] The Development of Trypanosomes in Tsetse Flies .
371 Remarks.\#151 ; Two hundred and eighty wild tsetse flies , fed for three days on an infected monkey and then on healthy monkeys , failed to transfer the disease .
The experiment lasted from April 3 to June 17 , and seven healthy monkeys were used .
After 66 days eight flies remained alive ; after 75 days only two .
None of the flies which died , or were killed and dissected , showed flagellates in the alimentary canal .
Experiment 663 .
This is the experiment described at length in the * Proceedings ' ( B , vol. 81 , 1909 ) .
Sixty wild flies were used .
One fly became infective after 18 days , and remained infective 75 days , when it died .
A small quantity of fluid from the gut of this fly injected into a healthy monkey gave rise to Sleeping Sickness .

As none of the five healthy monkeys on which these flies were fed during the first 16 days showed any sign of Sleeping Sickness it may be assumed that there was no naturally-infected fly among the 500 .
On or about the 29th day the cage of flies became infective , and remained infective up to the 47th day .
On this day a dead fly was found on dissection to contain flagellates , and after the death of this fly no further infection took place .
The injection of the infected fly failed , however , to give rise to Sleeping Sickness when injected under the skin of a healthy monkey .

[ Apr. 18 , Experiment 721 .
Remarks.\#151 ; This experiment lasted from April 12 to July 6 , a period of 85 days , and remained negative throughout .
On the 30th day , 12 flies out of the 50 remained alive ; on the 73rd day only six flies were left .
As the flies died they were dissected , but no infected fly was found .
Experiment 980 .
Remarks.\#151 ; This experiment lasted 66 days , and remained negative .
At the end 15 flies remained alive .
These were killed and dissected .
All proved negative .
These experiments on the development of Trypanosoma gambiense in Lake-shore or wild Crlossina palpalis , given somewhat in detail , will suffice to show the method employed , and make it unnecessary to explain the remaining experiments further than is done in Table I. It would appear from the fact that none of the healthy monkeys became infected before the 18th day , that not a single fly of the 1840 used was infective when captured .
That is to say , that among nearly 2000 Lake-shore flies , not one was naturally infected .
On referring to Table IY , in the previous paper in the ' Proceedings '\#151 ; a table showing the probable number of naturally-infected flies\#151 ; this is seen to be by no means exceptional .
Other points of interest arising out of these experiments are the number of flies which became infective , and the result of injecting their body-contents into healthy animals .
The following table shows this:\#151 ; Table II.\#151 ; Number of Flies found Infected with Trypanosomes in the Experiments with Lake-shore Flies and Trypanosoma gambiense .

373 Thus it is seen that the infected flies found in three of the positive experiments when injected into healthy monkeys gave negative results , while those found in three others gave positive results .
The infected fly found in the seventh successful experiment was not injected .
It is difficult to understand why the results of injecting infected flies into healthy animals are so irregular .
The only theory brought forward is that the trypanosomes introduced under the skin along with the tissues of the fly may give rise to a reaction at that point , which will so damage the parasites that they fail to infect .
In these experiments , 1840 flies were used , and of these 16 became infected , or , at least , were found to have flagellates in their gut .
This works out at less than 1 per cent. The smallness of the percentage is due to the fact that less care was taken to dissect the flies which died during the course of the experiments .
B. The Development of Trypanosoma gambiense Laboratory-Bred Glossina palpalis .
The pupae of the fly were found on the Lake-shore , and hatched out in the laboratory .
For a long time the Commission failed to find any pupae , although days were spent in turning over soil and decaying vegetable matter in those places where the fly most abounded .
At last , Lieutenant A. D. Fraser , Royal Army Medical Corps , found them in numbers in patches of sand on the edge of the Lake in the Sesse Islands .
After the Sesse Islands were emptied of their inhabitants , Fraser 's native collectors came into the service of the Commission , and from that time there was no lack of pupae .
These natives found them in large numbers .
One day they brought up as many as 7000 .
These pupae proved to be much healthier than those obtained from flies in captivity .
The flies bred from larvae born in the laboratory rarely showed any marked vitality .
Many of the larvae were immature , and those which hatched out were rarely a success as experimental flies .
On the .other hand , the flies hatched out from pupae found on the Lake-shore were fairly strong and vigorous , and lived in captivity for a couple of months or more .
It was , however , difficult to get them to feed at first , and very few became infective , as the following table shows .
The flies were fed chiefly on infected monkeys .
In one negative experiment ( 1431 ) they were fed on a case of Sleeping Sickness in man , and in five\#151 ; two positive ( 1566 and 1602 ) and three negative ( 1269 , 1452 , and 1672)\#151 ; on oxen .
Numerous observations went to show that there is no hereditary transmission of trypanosomes in Glossina palpalis ; and no evidence was gained that the flies became infected with any flagellate by contact with other flies or fouled cages .

379 infected .
They were then pooled and injected into a healthy monkey , which became infected with Sleeping Sickness .
This shows that the infected fly may escape detection by the microscope .
In Experiments 1269 , 1452 , 1672 , 1680 , 1693 , and 1706 , flies were found containing flagellates .
These flies had not given rise to disease in the monkey they had been fed on , nor did their injection prove successful .
The flagellates must be considered to be Trypanosoma and therefore a cage of flies may beeome infected without causing disease either by biting or injection .
In Experiments 1549 and 1602 , flies were found containing flagellates , and these flies succeeded in infecting monkeys both by biting while alive and injection after death .
Lastly , in Experiments 1566 , 1712 , and 1760 , flies were found with flagellates which had infected the monkey fed on , but which failed to give rise to disease when their body-contents were injected into healthy animals .
In these experiments 746 laboratory-bred flies were used .
Thirty-nine became infected\#151 ; that is to say , more .than 5 per cent. C. The Development of Trypanosoma dimorphon Lake-shore Glossina palpalis .
This is the commonest cattle trypanosome in Uganda .
During 1909 it caused epidemics among the Government transport oxen at Entebbe , Mr. Walsh 's cattle at Kabula Muliro , and the Uganda Company 's cattle at Namukekera , all of which were investigated by the Commission .
The name Trypanosoma dimorphon is used for this species , although two forms have not been found .
It belongs to the short , stumpy type of trypanosomes , without free flagella , and is probably identical with that found in Zanzibar by Edington ; in Portuguese East Africa , described by Theiler ; in Korthern Rhodesia by Montgomery and Kinghorn ; and in Southern Rhodesia by Bevan .

Remarks.\#151 ; Five hundred wild flies were fed for three days on a dog whose blood contained numerous Trypanosoma dimorphon .
Twenty-one days after their first feed they became infective .
By the 27th day they lost the infection and did not regain it , although kept under observation for 71 days .
None of the flies which died or were killed and dissected showed any flagellates .
It appears as if the infected fly had died early in the experiment and had escaped notice .

These experiments with Trypanosoma dimorphon are not very satisfactory .
Experiment 574 appears to be fairly free from fallacy , and from it , it would seem probable that Trypanosoma dimorphon can develop in Glossina palpalis and infect a healthy animal after a period of 21 days .
Ox 870 , in Experiment 1642 , became infected at a time when several of the cattle at Mpumu became naturally infected with this trypanosome disease , so that this experiment is not free from doubt .
It is evident that more work must be done before anything definite can be said regarding this species .

A curious fact is that in all the 30 flies , with the exception of one , the infection was confined to the proboscis .
There was a feeling in the minds of the members of the Commission that this growth of flagellates in the proboscis was something quite characteristic of soma vivax .
Only on one occasion was this development of trypanosomes in the proboscis seen after feeding laboratory-bred flies on blood which was known to contain nothing but Trypanosoma G. The Development of Trypanosoma nanum in Lake-shore Glossina palpalis .

Conclusions .
1 .
That Trypanosoma gambiense multiplies in the gut of about one in every 20 Glossina palpalis which have fed on an infected animal .
2 .
That the flies become infective , on an average , 34 days after their first feed .
3 .
That a fly may remain infective for 75 days .
4 .
That Trypanosoma dimorphon , Trypanosoma vivax , and Trypanosoma nanum may also multiply in Glossina , which must therefore be looked upon as a possible carrier in these diseases .
5 .
That multiplication in the tube of the proboscis is characteristic of Trypanosoma vivax .
