I am now examining these new facts .

The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " On a Relation between the Coefficient of the Thomson Effect and certain other Physical Properties of Metals .
" By Shelford Bidwell , M.A. , LL. B. Communicated by Prof. Frederick Guthrie , F.R.S. Received April 23 , 1884 .
The magnitude and direction of the Thomson effect depend upon a coefficient which is always the same for the same metal , but varies with different metals .
Professor Everett , in his " Units and Physical Constants , " p. 151 , gives a table based upon Tait 's thermoelectric diagram ( " Trans. R.S.E. , " vol. xxvii , p. 125 ) , in which the thermo-electric values of a number of metals , referred to lead as zero , are given in the form \#171 ; +'/ 3 t , where ft is a number which for a given metal is proportional to the tangent of the inclination of the line representing the metal in Tait 's diagram , and therefore to the coefficient of the Thomson effect .
Since all the physical properties of a metal are to some extent affected by h.eat , it seemed probable that a connexion might be found to exist between certain of these properties and the Thomson effect .
A short examination showed that , as a rule , the coefficient of the Thomson effect is positive in those metals which have a great specific electrical resistance and specific heat , and negative in those which are distinguished by a great coefficient of expansion .
I therefore made several attempts to ascertain whether the Thomson coefficient might not be some definite function of the specific resistance , specific heat , and coefficient of expansion ; and though I have not been perfectly successful , it appears from the subjoined table that there is a close relation between them .

] The Thomson Effect and Properties of Metals .
The first column contains the names of all the metals given in Everett 's table , with the exception of alloys .
The second column gives the numerical coefficients of t in Everett 's table : these numbers are proportional to the coefficients of the Thomson effect .
The specific heats in the third column are Regnault 's determinations , as given in Pickering 's " Physical Manipulation , " vol. ii , p.287 .
The specific resistances in column IV ( except that of tin ) fcare Matthiessen 's , as given in Jenkin 's " Electricity " and Pickering 's " Physical Manipulation .
" The resistance of tin is reduced from E. Becquerel 's determination , on the assumption that the specific resistance of silver at 15 ' C. is 0016 .
Matthiessen 's is considerably higher , viz. , 0'134 .
The fifth column contains the products of the third and fourth multiplied by 106 to get rid of decimals .
The coefficients of expansion in the sixth column are taken from the " Encyclopaedia Britannica , " 9th edition , article " Heat , " by Sir William Thomson .
The authorities are given in the seventh column.* The eighth column gives the squares of the coefficients of expansion divided by 343.+ The numbers in the ninth column are obtained by subtracting those in the eighth from those in the fifth column .
In the last column the numbers in column IX are divided by 2,400 .
It will be seen that , with one exception , the order of magnitude of the numbers in column IX ( proportional to spec , heat X spec .
res .
X 106 \#151 ; ( Exp.-h34)2 ) is exactly the same as the order of those in column II , which are proportional to the coefficient of the Thomson effect .
The rate of decrease in column X is , however , not the same as that in column II , the numbers diminishing too rapidly in the upper half of the column and too slowly in the lower half .
Although , therefore , it appears very probable that the direction and magnitude of the * Where more than one value was given the first was always used except in the biases of silver and zinc .
The expansions for silver are\#151 ; Muschenbrock 's , 2120 ; Kupffer 's , 1910 ; Matthiessen 's , 1973 ; those for zinc are\#151 ; Calvert 's , 2200 ; Matthiessen 's , 2976 ; Fizeau 's , 2918 .
In both cases there is a fair agreement between the second and third values , while the first differs from them considerably .
The second values give silver and zinc the same places in column X as in -column II ; the first would change their order .
t The divisor was so chosen that , while the ratio of the first number to the last in column IX should be as nearly as possible equal to the ratio of the first number to the last in column II , the number corresponding to lead in column IX should at the same time be as near zero as possible .
Both conditions could not be exactly fulfilled at once .
28 Mr. T. Andrews .
Electromotive Force from [ May 8 , Thomson effect in any given metal are dependent mainly , if not entirely , upon the specific heat , specific resistance , and coefficient of expansion of the metal ( or upon changes of these properties with changes of temperature ) , the Thomson coefficient is not exactly given by the expression spec , heat X spec .

X 106\#151 ; ( Exp.-f-34)2 , even if due allowance is made for the uncertainty of the numbers in columns II , III , IV , and VI , and for the fact that some of them may vary greatly with different specimens of the same metal .
But I have not succeeded in finding a better expression.* II .
" Experimental Research on the Electromotive Force from Difference of Potential during Diffusion in Tidal Streams .
" By Thomas Andrews , F.R.S.E. , Assoc. M. Inst. C.E. , Wortley Iron Works , near Sheffield .
Communicated by Professor Stokes , Sec. R.S. Received April 20,1884 .
An examination of the composition of the waters throughout the length of a tidal stream during diffusion of salt and fresh water consequent on tidal action , reveals a very considerable difference in the proportion of saline constituents between the water at the surface and that at the bottom , during certain times of tide this difference amounting sometimes to near 100 per cent. , and it may frequently be either much greater or less according to tidal fluctuations .
This fact constitutes the basis of the investigation which the author undertook , to obtain some approximate quantitative measurement of the resultant electromotive force , \amp ; c. , arising from such difference of potential .
It is known that a current is set up when a bar or plate of the same metal is immersed in two dissimilar solutions in contact , one capable of acting readily upon the metal , the other having little or no action on it , the whole forming a circuit .
The current continues until diffusion renders the composition of the solutions uniform , after which a reverse current may not * With regard to aluminium , which in column X comes between platinum and magnesium , instead of between lead and tin , as in column II , it is possible that the specific resistance given by Matthiessen as 0'029 is too high .
I do not know of any other determination professing to be exact , but it is stated in Wurtz 's " Die .
de Chimie , " p. 129 , upon the authority of Deville , to be one-eighth that of iron , which would make it 0'012 .
This , however , is undoubtedly too low .
If it were 0*019 , the place of aluminium in column X would be the same as in column II , and if it were as high as 0'026 , its place would be between magnesium and lead .
I may mention that some experiments of my own show that the coefficient of the Thomson effect in aluminium comes slightly above that of lead , instead of below it .
And in the diagram at p. 178 of Jenkin 's " Electricity " the inclination of the aluminium line is also shown as positive .
