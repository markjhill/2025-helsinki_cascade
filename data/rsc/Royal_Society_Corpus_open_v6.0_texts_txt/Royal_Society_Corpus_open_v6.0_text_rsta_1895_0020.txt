IN a previous paper the concrete representation of eCtriCal and optical phenoinena by means of a Jly elastic fluid aether has been discuss a Appendix it has been shown that wheneyer is direct tion of interaction : between the molecules of matter and the } it , in the ) gnetism or in the optical phen ) ) of ] media , the consideration of gl.oups of electrons or nent strain-centres the aether , a of , or possibly the whole of , the constitutiol of the atoms of matter , suffices to lead to a ation of the rions modes of activity : while this scheIne seems to be free from the chief difficulties have methods of mination of Theories involving the Electrodynamic Potential Function .

Every scheme for reducing the phenome1la of electric to a purely dynamical basis must ultimately from the formula for the electrodynamic potential of a system of dinary culrents , discovered and first extensively applied by F. E. NEUMANN .
In a preliminary tentative discnssion of this formula , the only course open appears to be to take the current flowing in an element of volume , nd the of the element , as the independent bless of continuous nalysis extended over the field of currents .
