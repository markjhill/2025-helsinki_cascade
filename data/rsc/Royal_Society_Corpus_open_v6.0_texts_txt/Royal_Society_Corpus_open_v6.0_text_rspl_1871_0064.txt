When the equivalent fibre is drawn , it is vays fouud to be so placed in relation to the axis of rotation as to produce the maximum work possible .

Two generators can be assigned on the locus hyperboloid , dividing the surface into two regions ; in one of these regions each generator is an axis of stable equilibrium , and the other region each generator is an axis of unstable equilibrium ; the generators separating the two regions are nxes of neutral equilibrium .
The axis of maximum work is a unique axis lying in the middle of the region of unstable equilibrium .

skew muscle is a supplemental contrivance for the purpose of procuring a line of force joining points and occupied by other structures , so that it would be impossible to apply the force directly .
Let I I ' be the shortest line joining A and , and take this line for axis of and the lines bisecting the between A for axes and , the origin placed at the point of of I I ' .
The equation of the locus hyperboloid is , . . . . .

The Tablejust given shows that in the employment of these supplemental muscles they are always so arranged as to work to the maximum advantage .
Thus the of skew muscles , which , on a hasty examination , would be pronounced to be imperfections , furnishes another proofof my postuIate .
PosTULATE.\mdash ; The musctes , bones , of animals are so related geometrically to each other as toproduce in every case the maximum amount of work .
