A paper was read , entitled " On the visibility of certain rays be ?
yond the ordinary red rays of the Solar Spectrum .
" By J. S. Cooper , Esq. , in a letter to Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , &amp; c , &amp;c. Communicated by Dr. Faraday .
The author states his having observed an extension of the red portion of the solar spectrum , obtained in the ordinary way , beyond the space it occupies when seen by the naked eye , by viewing it through a piece of deep blue cobalt glass .
He finds that the part of the spectrum thus rendered perceptible to the right is crossed by two or more very broad lines or bands : and observes that the space occupied by the most powerful calorific rays , coincides with the si ?
tuation of the red rays thus rendered visible by transmission through a blue medium .
The author expresses a regret that he has not had sufficient leisure to pursue the investigation of these phenomenon .
A paper was also in part read , entitled , " Fifth letter on Voltaic Combinations , with some account of the effects of a large constant Battery : " addressed to Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. By John F. Daniell , Esq. , F.R.S.
