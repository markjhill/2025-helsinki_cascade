On the Electrical Relations of Metals and Metalliferous Minerals , By R. W. Fox , Esq. Communicated in a letter to Davies Gilbert , Esq. , F.R.S. The author states that he has ascertained that the crystallized gray oxide of manganese holds a much higher place in the electro-magnetic scale than any other body with which he has compared it , when immersed in various diluted acids , and alkaline solutions : he also gives a table of the order in which other metals and minerals stand in this respect .
When employed in voltaic combinations he found that on being so arranged as to act in opposition to one another , the direction of the resultant of their action , as indicated by the deflection of the magnetic needle , did not coincide with the mean of the direc ?
tions of the needle when under the separate influence of each .
Hence he infers that the needle is not a true index of the electricity transmitted ; and that electro-magnetic action does not depend on acontinuous electric current .
He conceives , therefore , that the phenomenon are better explained on the hypothesis of pulsations which he formerly advanced .
A galvanometer of a new construction is employed by the author for weighing the deflecting force of these electrical impulses .
