The experiments described below form part of a research which I began in the summer of 1897 in the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge , but was unable to complete before leaving Cambridge that same year .
The object of this part of the research , which was suggested by Professor J. J. Thomson , was to determine whether evaporation of an unelectrified liquid produces any electrification or not .
The liquid used was fused sodium and the arrangement of apparatus is shown in the accompanying drawing .
The sodium to be fused was held in a. vertical iron cylinder , A , Q 2 Electrical Effects due to Evaporation of Sodium in , \amp ; c. 183 February 8 , 1900 .

The experiments described below form part of a research which I began in the summer of 1897 in the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge , but was unable to complete before leaving Cambridge that same year .
The object of this part of the research , which was suggested by Professor J. J. Thomson , was to determine whether evaporation of an unelectrified liquid produces any electrification or not .
The liquid used was fused sodium and the arrangement of apparatus is shown in the accompanying drawing .
The sodium to be fused was held in a. vertical iron cylinder , A , Q 2 184 Mr. W. Craig Henderson .
On Electrical Effects closed at the bottom and having a tightly fitting asbestos plug at the mouth .
Through a small hole in the asbestos plug there passed a tightly fitting glass tube , G , only a little longer than the thickness of the plug .
A stout bare copper wire , C , passed through this tube G without touching the sides , and had a copper disc at the end inside Bunsen Burners , the iron cylinder .
Outside the cylinder , this wire passed direct to the insulated quadrants of an electrometer E , and was surrounded throughout this portion of its length by a m6tal guard-tube D , which screened it from outside electrostatic influences .
Besides the fastening to the electrometer , the sole supports of the wire C were two paraffin plugs fixed into the ends of this tube D. The iron cylinder A , the tube D , and the uninsulated quadrants of the electrometer E , were connected by a wire with one another and with the sheath of the electrometer , denoted by S in the diagram .
The heat to fuse the sodium was supplied by two Bunsen burners placed below the cylinder A ; and in order to protect the insulated wire from the hot gases rising from the burners , a metal screen M was fixed on the cylinder and bent up on the side remote from the electrometer to serve as a funnel .
due to Evaporation of Sodium in Air and other Gases .
185 With these arrangements it was found that very soon after heat was applied to the sodium , a negative electrification of 2 to 3 volts was indicated by the electrometer .
This electrification persisted for a considerable time , but eventually the insulation broke down , owing to the sodium vapour condensing in the glass tube G at the mouth of the cylinder , sufficiently to cause a solid connection between the tube and wire .
When the same experiment was repeated without the sodium , no electrification was indicated by the electrometer .
These results were confirmed by repeated experiments , and the question then arose whether this negative electrification is due to the evaporation of the sodium , or to oxidation of the sodium going on in the iron cylinder .
The latter seemed probable , as the electrometer showed electrification almost from the moment when heat was applied to the sodium , whereas sodium does not fuse till at temperature of 96 ' C. and boils at about 400 ' C. To determine this point , the same experiment was repeated with this difference , that the air in the cylinder was replaced by an atmosphere in which the sodium could not oxidise .
Carbonic acid gas was first tried , being kept flowing into the cylinder after passing through a drying apparatus ; but in this gas the sodium became coated with a white encrustation , and showed no signs of evaporation or of boiling even at a red heat .
Coal gas was next tried , and no difficulty was found in boiling the sodium in this gas .
To prevent accident by explosion , the apparatus was set up in the fire-place , so that the escaping coal gas might pass up the chimney , and not mix with the air of the room .
Great care was taken to ensure the complete removal of air from the iron cylinder before heat was applied .
With this atmosphere of coal gas no electrification was obtained while heat was applied to the tube for over an hour .
The insulation was tested from time to time during this period by giving a charge to the wire from an electrified vulcanite rod , watching the rate of leak indicated on the electrometer scale , and then discharging .
It was found to be excellent ; but eventually , as before , it broke down when some of the sodium vapour condensed in the mouth of the cylinder between the wire and the glass tube .
Repetition of this experiment confirmed this result .
This problem of the possible generation of electricity by evaporation of a liquid , has been recently investigated for the case of water by Pellat , * who found no trace of electrification .
A similar result was found in the earlier experiments of Blake , t who used water and solutions * Pellat , 4 Seances de la Societe Fran ?

The present experiments lead to the conclusion that evaporation of fused sodium does not give electrification , such as could be detected by the method used , unless oxidation is going on .
