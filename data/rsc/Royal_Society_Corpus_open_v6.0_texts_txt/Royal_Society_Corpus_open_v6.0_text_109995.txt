] The centering of a triple achromatic object-glass has always presented considerable difficulties to practical opticians , which Dr. Wollaston has succeeded in removing , with regard to an excellent telescope in his own possession , by observing the relative position of the fifteen small images of a luminous object near the eye-glass , which are formed by the binary combinations of the reflexions of the six surfaces concerned , and which are seen by an eye situated beyond the object-glass , and assisted , if required , by a lens .
When these images are all in the same right line , it is obvious that the glasses are not only well adjusted together , but that each is well centered ; and by means of four screws acting on each glass , Dr. Wollaston was able to make the adjustment so complete , as considerably to improve the powers of the instrument .
