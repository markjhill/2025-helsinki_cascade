" On a Sun-Spot observed August 31 , 1880 .
" By J. N. Lockyer , F.R.S. Received October 26 , 1880 .
The recent activity in solar spots has enabled me to test the hypothesis I put before the Society on December 12th , 1878 , by observing whether the velocity of the up-rush or down-rush of the so-called iron vapour in the sun was registered equally by all the iron lines , as it should be on the received hypothesis .
The observations already made , though few in number , indicate that while motion is shown by the change of refrangibility of some lines , other adjacent lines indicate a state of absolute rest .
Thus , in an observation of a sun-spot on August 81st , 1880 , when the iron line at 5207-6 was doubly contorted , indicating an ascending and descending velocity of about fifteen miles a second , the two adjacent iron lines at A , 5208'7 and .
5201'6 , visible in the same field of view , were unaffected .
I send this paper to the Royal Society with all reserve , in order to call the attention of other observers to the point , as I fear it is only too probable that foggy weather will stop all observations here .
