d E X. A Letter from James Jurin , M. D. F. R. S. ~ Coll. Med. Lond. to Martin Folks , Esq ; President of the Royal Society , concerning the Action of Springs .
SIR , INEED not inform a Person so well acquainted with all the Branches of Mathematical Philosophy as yourself , that the Theory of Springs not only is of great Use in the more curious Parts of Mechanics , as the Structure of Watches , &amp;c. but may give Light to many Operations of Nature , there being few Substances but what are endued with some Degree of Elasticity ; and particularly the Bodies of Animals , and of Vegetables likewise , being known to consist , in a great measure , if not wholly , of Organs strongly elastic .
Presented April 12 .
1744 .
For which Reason it is not to be wondered at , that this Theory has engaged the Thoughts of several eminent eminent Mathematicians of the last and present Age ; as Dr. Hook , Mr. John Bernouilli , M. Camus , &amp;c. But , as all that I have yet seen upon this Subject goes no further , than to compare the Effects of different Springs one with another , without showing how the Effect of any of them may be reduced to , or compared with , that of any other natural Cause , I flatter myself , that the general Proposition I am going to lay down may merit your Attention , both on account of its Simplicity , and of its comprehending all possible Cases of a Body acting upon a Spring , or a Spring upon a Body , where no other Power intervenes ; and also of its reducing the Effect to that most known and simple one , the Effect of Gravity upon falling Bodies .
In order to which , to prevent any Misapprehension , it will be proper to fix the Meaning of such Terms as I shall have Occasion to make use of .
1 .
By a Spring , I mean a Body of any Shape perfectly elastic .
2 .
By the natural Situation of a Spring , I mean the Situation it will rest in , when not disturbed by any external Force .
3 .
By the Length of a Spring , I mean the greatest Length , through which it can be forced inwards .
This would be the whole Length , were the Spring considered as a mathematical Line ; but in a material Spring is the Difference between the whole Length when the Spring is in its natural Situation , and the Length or Space it takes up when wholly compressed or closed .
4 .
By the Strength of a Spring , I mean the leastForce or Weight , which , when the Spring is wholly compressed or closed , will restrain it from unbending itself .
5 .
By the Space through which a Spring is bent , I mean that Space or Length through which one End of the Spring is removed from its natural Situation .
6 .
By the Force of a Spring bent or partly closed , I mean the least Force or Weight , which , when the Spring is bent through any Space less than its whole Length , will confine it to the State it is then in , without suffering it to unbend any farther .
This being premised , I shall next , for the Foundation of what follows , lay down a Principle , which was verified by Experiment , in the Presence of our Royal Founder about 70 Years ago , by the famous * Dr. Robert Hook ; and has been lately confirmed by the accurate Hand of our common Friend Mr. George Graham .
PRINCIPL E. Ut Tensio , sic Vis : That is , if a Spring be forced or bent inwards , or drawn outwards , or any way removed from its natural Situation , its Resistance is proportional to the Space by which it is removed from that Situation .
Thus , if the Spring C L , ( Fig 1 .
TAB. II .
) resting with the End L against any immovable Support , but otherwise lying in its natural Situation , and at full Liberty , shall , by any Force p , be pressed inwards , or from C towards L , through the Space of One Inch , and can be there detained by that Force p , * Lectures de Potentia restitutiva , 1678 .
the Resistance of the Spring , and the Force p , exactly counterbalancing one another ; then the Force 2p will bend the Spring thro ' the Space of Two Inches , 3p thro ' Three Inches , 4p thro ' Four Inches , ~c .
the Space Cl ( Fig. 2 .
) , thro ' which the Spring is bent , or by which the End C is removed from its natural Situation , being always proportional to the Force which will bend it so far , and will detain it so bent .
And if one End L be fastened to an immovable Support , Fig. 3 .
and the other End C be drawn outwards to l , and be there detained from returning back by any Force p , the Space C l , thro ' which it is so drawn outwards , will be always proportional to the Force p , which is able to detain it in that Situation .
And the same Principle holds in all Cases , where the Spring is of any Form , whatsoever , and is , in any Manner whatsoever , forcibly removed from its naural Situation .
Here , Sir , I presume , you will think it material to take notice , that the elastic Force of the Air is a Power of a different Nature , and governed by different Laws , from that of a Spring .
For supposing the Line L C , Fig 1 .
to represent a cylindrical Volume of Air , which , by Compression , is reduced to L l , Fig. 2 .
or , by dilatation , is extended to L l , Fig. 3 .
its elastic Force will be reciprocally as L l , Fig 2 and 3 ; whereas the Force or Resistance of a Spring will be directly as C l. I now proceed to my general Proposition , and its Corollaries ; in which if I shall happen at any time to express myself with less Accuracy , as in making Weights , Times , Velocities , ~c .
to become promiscuously the Subjects of geometrical or arithmetical Operations , I desire , once for all , to be understood , not as speaking of those Quantities themselves , but of Lines , or Numbers , proportional to them .
THEORE M. If a Spring of the Strength P , and the Length C L , Fig. 4 , lying at full Liberty upon a horizontal Plane , rest with one End L against an immovable Support ; and a Body of the Weight M , moving with the Velocity V , in the Direction of the Axis of the Spring , strike directly upon the other End C , and thereby force the Spring inwards , or bend it through any Space C B ; and a middle Proportional , C G , be taken between the Line CLX M/ P , and 2 a , a being the Height to which a heavy Body would ascend in vacuo with the Velocity V ; and , upon the Radius R=C G , be erected the Quadrant of a Circle GF A ; I say , 1 .
When the Spring is bent thro ' any right Sine of that Quadrant , as C B , the Velocity v of the Body M , is , to the original Velocity V , as the Co-sine to the Radius : That is , v=VxB F/ R. 2 .
The Time t of bending the Spring thro ' the same Sine C B , is to T the Time of a heavy Body 's Ascending in vacuo with the Velocity V , as the corresponding Arch to 2 a : That is t=TxG F/ 2 a. DEMONSTRATIO N. 1 .
While the Spring is bending thro ' the Space C B , let the Space , thro ' which it is at any time bent , be called x , ~ the Time of bending it thro ' the Space x , and v the Velocity of the Body at the End of the Time ~ ; and let CL= L , CB= l. Then , if p be the Force , with which the Spring , when bent thro ' the Space x , resists the Motion of the Body ; by Dr. Hook 's Principle , L : x : : P : p =Px/ L. And since , in the Case of Forces that act uniformly , the Quantities of Motion generated are proportional to the generating Forces , and the Times jointly , if M v~ be the nascent Quantity of Motion taken from the Body by the Resistance Px/ L in the nascent Time T , M V : M v : : M T : : PxT/ L or , v= VPx~/ ML T. Also , since , in the same Case of Forces acting uniformly , the Spaces are proportional to the Velocities , and the Times jointly , x : 2 a : : v ~ : V T , or ~=TVx/ 2a v. Therefore , v~ =VPx/ MLTxTVx/ 2a v , or , 2vv= V2 Pxx/ ML a ; and the Fluents of these Two Quantities are v2 and V2Px2/ 2ML a. But the former of these was thing ; therefore v~ 2V2= V2 P x2 / 2ML a , or v2= V2 V2 P x2 / 2ML a. But , by the Construction , 2MLa/ P=R 2 ; therefore , v2 = V2 V2 x2 / R 2 , or , v2= V2 x R2 x2 / R2 ; and , when x becomes equal to l , and v to v , v2= V2 x R2 l2 / R2 ; and , by the Property of the Circle , R2l2 being equal to B F2 , v2 = V2 xB F2 / R2 , or v=VxBF/ R. Q. E. D. 1~ .
2 .
We have above , ~=TVx/ 2a v ; and v2 = V2 x R2 x2 / R2 ; or , v=Vx~ R2 x2 / R : Therefore , ~= TV x/ 2ax R/ Vx~ R2 x2 , or , T=T/ 2axRx/ ~ R2 x2 .
Now let C D , Fig. 5 .
be equal to x ; and draw the Co-sine D E , the Radius C E , and the Perpendicular ed= x : Then will the Triangle DEC be similar to the nascent Triangle de E ; and consequently , D E : d e : : C E : eE=CExde/ DE=Rx/ ~ R2 x2 .
Therefore , ~=T/ 2axe E , and ~=TxGE/ 2 a , And when a becomes equal to C B , and ~ to t , the Arch GE becomes equal to the Arch G F : Therefore t= TxGF/ 2 a. Q. E. D. 2~ .
SCHOLIUM I. Whereas I have represented the Spring as resting against an immovable Support at L , it will , perhaps , be objected , That no Support can be really immovable ; since any Body , how great soever , may be moved out of its Place by the least Force .
But this Objection may easily be removed , by supposing the Spring to be continued till it becomes of twice the Length C L , and that a second Body , equal to M , strikes against the opposite End of the Spring with the same Velocity in a contrary Direction ; in which Case the Point L will be perfectly immovable .
SCHOLIUM II .
Under this Theorem are comprehended the Three following Cases : In Case 1 .
The Spring is bent thro ' its whole Length , or is entirely compressed and closed , before the moving Force of the Body is consumed , and its Motion ceases .
In Case 2 .
The moving Force of the Body is consumed , and its Motion ceases , before the Spring is bent thro ' its whole Length , or wholly closed .
In Case 3 .
The moving Force of the Body is consumed , and its Motion ceases , at the Instant that the Spring is bent thro ' its whole Length , and is entirely closed .
For this Reason , and in order to make the following Corollaries of more ready Use , I shall take the Liberty of distributing them into Three Classes , the first of which are as general as the Theorem itself , extending to all the Three Cases , but are more particularly useful in Case 1 .
The Second Class of Corollaries extend to both the Second and Third Case ; but are more particularly useful in Case 2 .
The Third Class extend only to Case 3 .
and , by that means , are much more simple than either of the former .
CLASS I. General Corollaries , but of more particular Use in Case 1 ; wherein the Spring is wholly closed , before the Motion of the Body ceases .
Coroll. 1 .
When the Spring is bent thro ' any right Sine C B , Fig. 4 .
the Loss of Velocity is to the original Velocity , as the versed Sine to the Radius , or Vv=VxG g/ R. For , since v=VxB F/ R , Vv=VVxB F/ R =VxRB F/ R =VxG g/ R. Coroll. 2 .
When the Spring is bent thro ' any right Sine C B , the Diminution of the Square of the Velocity is to the Square of the original Velocity , as the Square of that right Sine to the Square of the Radius , or V2v2=V2xCB 2/ R 2 .
For , since v=VxB F/ R , v2=V2xBF 2/ R 2 , and V2 v2=V2V2xBF 2/ R 2=V2xR2B F2/ R 2=V2xCB 2/ R 2 .
Coroll. 3 .
When the Spring is bent thro ' any Space l , v the Velocity of the Body is equal to Vx ~2MLaPl 2/ 2 ML a , or to Vx~2Map l/ 2 M a ; and is proportional to ~2 MLaP l2/ M L , or to ~2 Ma~ l/ M. For , since v~=V2xBF 2/ R 2=V2xR2l 2/ R 2 ; if , for R 2 , we substitute its Value 2ML a/ P , we have v2= V2x2MLaPl 2/ 2 ML a , or v=Vx~2MLaPl 2/ 2 ML a : And , as by Dr. Hook 's Principle , L : l : : P : p , or Pl= p L , v=Vx~2MLapL l/ 2 ML a , or , v=Vx ~2Map l/ 2 M a , But V/ ~ a , by Galileo 's Doctrine , is a constant Quantity ; and therefore v is proportional to ~2MLaPl 2/ M L , or , to ~2Map l/ M. Coroll. 4 .
The Time t of bending the Spring thro ' any Space l , is proportional to the Arch GF divided by ~ a ; l being the right Sine of the Arch , and R=~2ML a/ P , being the Radius .
For , by the Theorem , t=TxG F/ 2 a ; and T/ ~ a is a constant Quantity .
Coroll. 5 .
The Diminution of the Product of the Weight of the Body into the Square of the Velocity , or ( to use the Expression of some late Writers ) the Diminution of the Vis viva , that is , MV2Mv 2 , by bending a Spring thro ' any Space l , is always equal to C2Pl 2/ 2 LA , or to C2p l/ 2 A ; where A is the Height from which a heavy Body will fall in vacuo in a Second of Time , and C is the Celerity gained by that Fall .
For , by Coroll. 2 .
V2v2=V2xCB 2/ R 2= V2l 2/ R 2 ; and R 2 , by the Construction , being equal to 2ML a/ P , V2v2=V2l2x P/ 2 M La. But , by Galileo 's Theory , V 2/ a =C 2/ A ; therefore , V2 v2 =C2Pl 2/ 2 M LA and M V2 Mv2= C2 P l2/ 2 LA = C2 p l/ 2 A. Coroll. 6 .
The Diminution of the Vis viva , by bending a Spring thro ' any Space l , is always proportional to Pl 2/ L , or to p l : And , if either the Spring be given , or P/ L be given in different Springs , the Loss of the Vis viva will be as l 2 , or as p 2 .
For , by Coroll. 5 .
MV2Mv2=C2Pl 2/ 2 LA= C2p l/ 2 A ; and C 2/ A being a constant Quantity , MV2Mv2 is as Pl 2/ L =p l : And , if P/ L be given , MV2Mv2 will be as l 2 ; or as l2xP 2/ L 2 ; or as l2 xp 2/ l 2 ; or as p 2 .
Coroll. 7 .
The Loss of the Vis viva , by bending a Spring thro ' its whole Length , or by wholly closing it , is equal to C2P L/ 2 A , and is proportional to P L : And , if PL be given , the Loss of the Vis viva is always the same .
This is evident from Coroll. 5 .
and 6 .
; forasmuch as l is now equal to L. CLASS II .
Corollaries of more particular Use in Case 2 .
; wherein the Motion of the Body ceases before the Spring is wholly closed .
Coroll. 8 .
If the Motion of the Body cease when the Spring is bent thro ' any Space l , the initial Velocity V is equal to Cl~ P/ 2 ML A , or to C~ p l/ 2 MA .
For , by Coroll. 5 .
V2v2=C2Pl 2/ 2 MLA=C2p l/ 2 M A. And here , the Motion of the Body ceasing , v2= 0 .
Therefore V2=C2Pl 2/ 2 MLA=C2p l/ 2 MA ; or V=Cl ~ P/ 2 MLA=C~p l/ 2 MA .
Coroll. 10 .
If the Motion of the Body cease , when the Spring is bent thro ' any Space , l , the Time , t , of bending it , is equal to 1~ of Time , multiplied by m/ 2 ~M L/ 2 P A , or to 1~ x m/ 2 ~M l/ 2 p A , where m is to 1 , as the Circumference of a Circle to the Diameter .
For , by the Theorem , t=TxG F/ 2 a ; and , by Galileo 's Theory , T/ ~ a= 1~/ ~ A. Therefore t= 1~/ ~ Ax G F/ 2 ~ a. Also , by the Theorem , v2=V2xR2l 2/ R 2 ; and therefore v2 being now equal to o , R2=l 2 , and , Fig. 6 .
l becomes the Radius of the Circle ; and l being likewise equal to the right Sine of the Arch G F , that Arch becomes a Quadrant , and is equal to 2lx m/ 4 .
Therefore t= 1~/ ~ Ax2l m/ 4 x2~ a , or t= 1~ x l m/ 4~ Ax~a .
But l being equal to R=~2ML a/ P , l/ ~a = ~2 M L/ P ; therefore t= 1~ x m/ 4 ~Ax~2M L/ P , or , t= 1~ x m/ 2 ~M L/ 2 PA= 1~ x m/ 2 ~M l/ 2 p A. Coroll. 11 .
In the same Case , the Time of bending the Spring is proportional to ~M L/ P , or to ~M l/ P ; and if L/ P be given , t will be as ~ M ; and , if both L/ P , and also M , be given , t will always be the same , whatever be the original Velocity , or thro ' whatever Space the Spring be bent .
Coroll. 12 .
If the Motion of the Body cease , when the Spring is bent thro ' any Space l , the Product of the initial Velocity , and the Time of bending the Spring , or V t , is equal to 1~ xmC l/ 4 A ; and is proportional to l , the Space thro ' which the Spring is bent .
For , by Coroll. 8 .
V=Cl~ P/ 2 ML A , and , by Coroll. 9 .
t= 1~ x m/ 2 ~M L/ 2 P A ; therefore , Vt= 1~ xmC l/ 4 A~ML P/ M LP= 1~ xmC l/ 4 A ; and , as 1~ , m , C and A , are given Quantities , Vt is as l. Hence , any Two of the Three Quantities , V , t , and l , being given , the other is readily determined .
Coroll. 13 .
In the same Case , the initial Quantity of Motion , or M V , is equal to Cl~P M/ 2 L A , or to C~pl M/ 2 A. For , by Coroll. 8 .
V=Cl~ P/ 2 MLA=C~p l/ 2 M A ; wherefore MV=Cl~P M/ 2 LA=C~pl M/ 2 A. Coroll. 14 .
In the same Case , MV is proportional to l~P M/ L , or to ~pl M , or to Pl t/ L , or to p t : And , if P/ L be given , MV is as l~ M , or as l t. For , in the preceding Coroll. C/ ~ A is a given Quantity ; and , by Coroll. 11 .
t is as ~M L/ P =~M l/ p. Coroll. 15 .
If the Quantity of Motion MV bend a Spring of the Strength P , and Length L , thro ' the Space l , and be wholly consumed thereby , no different Quantity of Motion equal to the former , as nMx V/ n , will bend the same Spring thro ' the same Space , and be wholly consumed thereby .
For , by the preceding Coroll. if the Spring be bent thro ' the Space l , and each of these Quantities of Motion be consumed thereby ; l~ M : l~n M : : M V : nMx V/ n. But MV=nMx V/ n ; and therefore , l~M=l~n M , or I= n , and M= n M , and V= V/ n. Therefore the Quantity of Motion nMx V/ n is not only equal to M V , but is composed of an equal Mass , and an equal Velocity .
Coroll. 16 .
But a Quantity of Motion less than M V , in any given Ratio , may bend the same Spring thro ' the same Space l , and the Time of bending it will be less in the same given Ratio .
For , let 1 to n be the given Ratio ; and let the lesser Quantity of Motion be M/ n nxn V ; which is to M V , as 1 to n. Then , by Coroll. 14 .
the Spring being given , l~ M : l~ M/ n n : : M V : M/ n nxnV= M V/ l ~Mxl~ M/ n n=M V/ n. Therefore the Quantity of Motion M/ n nxn V , being equal to M V/ n , will bend the Spring thro ' the same Space l. Likewise , by the same Corollary , MV is as l t ; and l being given , the Quantity of Motion is as t : Therefore the Time of bending the Spring will be less in the same Ratio , as the Quantity of Motion is less .
Coroll. 17 .
A Quantity of Motion greater than M V , in any Ratio given , may be consumed in bending the Spring thro ' the same Space ; and the Time of bending it will be greater in the same given Ratio .
This appears after the same manner as the preceding , by making na fractional Number instead of a whole one .
Coroll. 18 .
If the Motion of the Body cease , when the Spring is bent thro ' any Space l , the initial Vis viva , or MV 2 , is equal to C2P l2/ 2 L A , or to C2p l/ 2 A : And 2aM=Pl 2/ L =p l. For , by Coroll. 8 .
V=Cl~ P/ 2 MLA=C~p l/ 2 M A , or V2=C2l2 P/ 2 MLA=C2p l/ 2 M A : Therefore MV2= C2Pl 2/ 2 LA =C2p l/ 2 A=V2Pl 2/ 2 La= V2 p l/ 2 a. Coroll. 19 .
In the same Case , the initial Vis viva is proportional to P l2/ L =pl and if P/ L be given , the Vis viva is as l 2 , or as p 2 .
For , in the preceding Corollary , C 2/ A being a given Quantity , the Vis viva is as Pl 2/ L =p l ; and , if P/ L be given , it will be as l 2 , or as p 2 ; sorasmuch as p and l increase in the same Proportion .
Coroll. 20 .
If the Vis viva , MV 2 , bend a Spring thro ' the Space l , and be totally consumed thereby , any other Vis viva , equal to the former , as nn MxV 2/ n n , will bend the same Spring thro ' the same Space , and be totally consumed thereby .
For , the Spring being the same , P/ L is given ; and therefore by Coroll. 19 .
the Vis viva , which will be consumed in bending the Spring thro ' the Space l , is as l 2 .
Coroll. 21 .
But the Time , in which the same Spring will be bent thro ' the same Space , by the Vis viva nnMxV 2/ n n , will be to the Time , in which it is so bent by the Vis viva MxV 2 , as n to 1 ; n being any whole or fractional Number .
For , by Coroll. 11 .
since L/ P is given , the Time is as V M. CLASS III .
Corollaries in Case 3 .
wherein the Motion of the Body ceases , at the Instant that the Spring is wholly closed .
Coroll. 22 .
If the Motion of the Body cease , when the Spring is bent thro ' its whole Length , or is wholly closed , the initial Velocity V is equal to C~P L/ 2 M A~ For , by Coroll. 8 .
V=C~p l/ 2 M A ; and l being now equal to L ( Fig. 7 .
) , p becomes equal to P ; and therefore V=C~P L/ 2 M A~ Coroll. 23 .
In the same Case , the initial Velocity V is proportional to ~P L/ M ~ For C/ ~ A , in the preceding Corollary , is a given Quantity .
Coroll. 24 .
In the same Case , if PL be given , either in the same , or in different Springs , the initial Velocity V is reciprocally as ~ M. This is plain from the preceding Corollary .
Coroll. 25 .
If the Motion of the Body cease , when the Spring is wholly closed , the Product of the initial Velocity , and the Time spent in closing the Spring , or V t , is equal to 1~ xmC L/ 4 A ; and is proportional to L , the Length of the Spring .
For , by Coroll. 22 .
V=C~P L/ 2 M A ; and , by Coroll. 10 .
t= 1~ x m/ 2 ~M L/ 2 P A : Therefore , Vt= 1~ xmC L/ 4 A ; and 1~ , m and C/ A , being given Quantities , Vt is as L. Coroll. 26 .
In the same Case , the initial Quantity of Motion , or M V , is equal to C~PL M/ 2 A. For , by Coroll. 23 .
V=C~P L/ 2 M A. Coroll. 27 .
In the same Case , MV is proportional to ~PL M , or to P t : And , if PL be given , either in the same , or different Springs , MV is as ~ M. This appears , partly , from the preceding Corollary , where C/ ~ A is a given Quantity ; and , consequently , MV is as ~PL M ; and PL being given , MV is as ~ M : And , partly , from Coroll. 11 .
; where t is as ~M L/ P , and , consequently , Pt is as ~PL M. Coroll. 28 .
In the same Case , if P/ L be given , either in the same , or in different Springs , the initial Quantity of Motion is as the Length of the Spring into the Time of bending it .
For , by Coroll. 27 .
MV is as P t ; and , if P be as L , MV is as L t. Coroll. 29 .
If the Quantity of Motion MV bend a Spring thro ' its whole Length , and be consumed thereby , no other Quantity of Motion equal to the former , as nMx V/ n , will close the same Spring , and be wholly consumed thereby .
This is proved in the same manner as Coroll. 15 .
putting only L for l. Coroll. 30 .
But a Quantity of Motion less or greater than M V , in any given Ratio , may close the same Spring , and be wholly consumed in closing it : And the Time spent in closing the Spring will be respectively less or greater , in the same given Ratio .
This is easily proved from Coroll. 16 .
Coroll. 31 .
If the Motion of the Body cease , when the Spring is wholly closed , the initial Vis viva , or M V2 , is equal to C2P L/ 2 A : And 2aM= P L. For , by Coroll. 22 .
V=C~P L/ 2 M A , or V2 = C2 P L/ 2 M A , or M V2 = C2 P L/ 2 A= V2 P L/ 2 a. Coroll. 32 .
In the same Case , the initial Vis viva is as the Rectangle under the Strength and Length of the Spring .
For , by the preceding Corollary , M V2 =C2P L/ 2 A , and C 2/ A is a given Quantity ; wherefore MV2 is as P L. Coroll. 33 .
In the same Case , if P/ L be given , the initial Vis viva is as P 2 , or as L 2 .
This is evident from the preceding Corollary .
Coroll. 34 .
If the Vis viva MV2 bend a Spring thro ' its whole Length , and be consumed in closing it , any other Vis viva equal to the former , as nn MxV 2/ n n , will close the same Spring , and be consumed thereby .
This is evident from Coroll. 32 .
Coroll. 35 .
But the Time of closing the Spring by the Vis viva nnMx V2/ n n , will be to the Time of closing it by the Vis viva MV 2 , as n to 1 .
For , by Coroll. 11 .
since the Spring is given , the Time is as ~ M. Coroll. 36 .
If the Vis viva M V2be wholly consumed in closing a Spring of the Strength P , and Length L ; the Vis viva , nnMV 2 , will be sufficient to close , 1 .
Either a Spring of the Strength nn P , and Length L. 2 .
Or a Spring of the Strength n P , and Length n L. 3 .
Or of the Strength P , and Length nn L. 4 .
Or , if n be a whole Number , the Number nn of Springs , each of the Strength P , and Length L , one after another .
For , MV 2 : nnMV 2 : : P L : nnP L ; and therefore , by Coroll. 32 .
the Vis viva , nnMV 2 , will close any Spring that has nnPL for the Product of its Strength and Length .
But nnPL is composed either of nnPx L , or of nPxn L , or of Pxnn L. Also the Loss of the Vis viva , in bending a given Spring , being always the same , by Coroll. 7 .
and the Vis viva , MV2 being wholly lost in bending a single Spring P L ; the Loss of the Vis viva , nn MV 2 , in closing one such Spring , will be MV 2 ; and its Loss in closing a second such Spring , will again be MV 2 , and so on : Consequently , the Number nn of such Springs will be closed one after another , by that time the Vis viva , nnMV 2 , is wholly consumed .
SCHOLIUM III .
If the Spring , instead of being at first wholly unbent , as we have hitherto considered it , be now supposed to have been already bent thro ' some Space C B , before the Body strikes it ; and the Velocity of the Body be required , after the Spring is bent thro ' any further Space , B D , Fig. 8 .
this Case , as well as the Three other above-mention 'd , will be found to come under our Theorem .
For , if v be the Velocity with which the Body is supposed to strike against the bent Spring at B , it is evident , that this may be considered , either as the original Velocity , or as the Remainder of a greater Velocity V , with which the Body might have struck upon the Spring at C , and which , upon bending the Spring from C to B , would now be reduced to v. For , in either Case , the Effect in bending the Spring from B to D , will be exactly the same .
In order , therefore , to determine this imaginary Velocity V , let a middle Proportional , B F , be taken between CLx M/ P , and 2 ~ , ~ being the Height to which a Body will ascend in vacuo with the Velocity v ; draw BF perpendicular to C B , and , with the Radius C F , describe the Quadrant CGFE A. Then will our present Case be exactly reduced to that of the Theorem ; C B , C D , representing the Spaces thro ' which the Spring is bent ; BF and DE the Velocities in the Points B and D ; GF and GE the Times of bending the Spring thro ' the Spaces CB , CD ; and CG representing the imaginary Velocity V , with which the Body might have struck the Spring at C. For , by the Theorem , B F2 : C G2 : : v 2 : V 2 ; and v 2 : V 2 : : ~ : a. Therefore CG2=BF2x a/ ~ .
But BF2=2~xL M/ P , by the Construction ; and , consequently , CG2=2~L M/ P x a/ ~ = 2aL M/ P , as in the Construction of the Theorem .
From this Case we shall draw a few Corollaries , as well for their Usefulness upon other Occasions , as to show how the Theory of Springs may be safely applied to the Action of Gravity upon ascending or falling Bodies .
Coroll. 37 .
If the Body M , with the Velocity v , sufficient to carry it to the Height ~ , strike at B , upon a Spring already bent thro ' the Space CB= l ; and do thereby bend it thro ' some farther Space BD= s ; at the End of which Space , or at D , the Body has a Velocity sufficient to carry it to some Height , as ~ ; then ~=2~MLPsx2l+ s/ 2 M L. For , by the Theorem , ~ : ~ : : BF 2 : DE 2 , or DE2=BF2x ~/ ~ =2~M L/ P x ~/ ~ or D E2 = 2~M L/ P. Also , DE2+CD2=CE2=CF2=B F2 +CB 2 , that is , 2~M L/ P +l2+2ls+s2= 2~M L/ P +l 2 ; or 2~M L/ P =2~M L/ P 2lss 2 ; or 2~ML=2~MLPsx2l+ s. Coroll. 38 .
If the Motion of the Body cease upon bending the Spring thro ' the Space BD= s , that is , if ~= o ; then the Height to which the Body might ascend in vacuo , with the Velocity v , or ~= Psx2l+ s/ 2 M L. For , by the last , when ~= o , 2~ML= Psx2l+ s. Coroll. 39 .
If p , the Force of the Spring when bent thro ' the Space C B , be equal to M the Weight of the Body ; the Height to which the Body would ascend in vacuo with the Velocity v , is to the Space thro ' which it will bend the Spring , by striking upon it at B with that same Velocity , as 2l+s to 2 l , or ~ : s : : 2l+ s : 2 l. For , by the last , ~=Psx2l+ s/ 2 M L ; and P/ L being equal to p/ l , ~=psx2l+ s/ 2 M l ; and , if p= M , ~ =sx2l+ s/ 2 l Coroll. 40 .
If p= M , and p do also continue constantly the same while the Spring is bending from B to D ( both which Suppositions are necessarily made in reducing the Action of a Spring to that of Gravity upon an ascending Body ) , the Spring must be of an infinite Length ; and l , the Space thro ' which it was bent before the Body struck it , must also be of an infinite Length ; and the Space B D , thro ' which the Spring will be further bent , must be equal to the Height the Body can ascend to with the Velocity v , or ~= s. For , by the last , when p= M , ~ : s : : 2l+ s : 2 l ; and the Resistances of the Spring at D and B being respectively as CD and C B , that is , as l+s and l ; since those Resistances are now supposed equal to one another , we must , upon that Supposition , consider l+s as equal to l ; and adding l to each , 2l+s=2 l , that is , l must be infinitely greater than s ; and then ~ : s : : 2 l : 2 l , or ~= s. SCHOLIUM IV .
In this Proposition , and all its Corollaries , except the Four last , we have considered the Spring as being , at first , wholly unbent , and then acted upon by a Body moving with the Velocity V , which bends it thro ' some certain Space : But , as we suppose the Spring to be perfectly elastic , the Proposition and Corollaries will equally hold , if the Spring be supposed to have been , at first , bent thro ' that same Space , and , by unbending itself , to press upon a Body at Rest , and thereby to drive that Body before it , during the Time of its Expansion : Only , V , instead of being the initial Velocity , with which the Body struck the Spring , will now be the final Velocity , with which the Body parts from the Spring when wholly expanded .
SCHOLIUM V. If the Spring , instead of being pressed inwards , be drawn outwards by the Action of the Body , we need only make L the greatest Length to which the Spring can be drawn out beyond its natural Situation , without Prejudice to its Elasticity , l any lesser Length to which the Spring is drawn outwards , P and p the Forces , which will keep it from restoring itself when drawn out to those Lengths respectively , and the Proposition will equally hold good : As it will also , if the Spring be supposed to have been already drawn outwards to the Length l , and , in restoring itself , to draw the Body after it : Only , in this latter Case , V , the initial Velocity in the Proposition , will now be the final Velocity , as in Scholium IV .
SCHOLIUM VI .
Our Proposition equally holds good , when the Spring is of any Form whatsoever , provided L be always understood to be the greatest Length it can be bent or drawn to from its natural Situation , l any lesser Length , and P , p , the Forces which will confine it to these Lengths .
For Dr. Hook 's Principle extends to Springs of any Form .
I have been at the Trouble of drawing so great a Number of Corollaries from this Proposition , because , in the Controversy about the Force of Bodies in Motion , I have observed both Parties to support their Opinion by Arguments taken from the Theory of Springs ; and I was willing impartially to furnish them both with means to examine into the Truth or Falsehood of one another 's Reasonings .
I had Thoughts myself of making use of some of these Corollaries for that Purpose , being far from thinking , that the Dispute is about Words only ; but this Letter is already drawn out to too great a Length ; and before I have Leisure to write again , I may possibly be prevented by a better Hand , which , I hope , may put an End to a Dispute that has too long pestered the Learned World .
But , in this , I shall be guided by your Judgment ; and shall therefore , at present , take up no more of your Time , than only to profess myself , Dear SIR , Your most affectionate Friend , and most obedient Servant , Apr. 10 .
