" By Professor D. E. Hughes , F.R.S. Received December 10 , 1883 .
In a paper " On the Molecular Rigidity of Tempered Steel , " * I advanced the theory that the molecules of soft iron were comparatively free as regards motion amongst themselves , whilst in hard iron or steel they were extremely rigid in their relative positions .
I have since widened the field of inquiry by observing the effects of mechanical compression and strains , as well as annealing and tempering , upon the magnetic capacity of sixty varieties of iron and steel , ranging from the softest Swedish iron to the hardest tempered cast steel .
We know already that soft iron will take a higher degree of temporary magnetism than steel , and that tempered steel retains magnetism more than soft iron ; consequently , we might believe that by the aid of an instrument which should give correct measurements , we might be able to include all varieties of iron and steel between the two extremes of softness , as in annealed iron , and hardness , as in high-tempered cast steel .
This proved , however , not to be the case , if the iron and steel were not all annealed to one absolute standard , and if magnetised to or near saturation .
In a late paper upon the theory of magnetism , f I said:\#151 ; " During these researches I have remarked a peculiar property of magnetism , viz. , that not only can the molecules be rotated through any degree of arc to its maximum , or saturation , but that , whilst it requires a comparatively strong force to overcome its rigidity or resistance to rotation , it has a small field of its own through which it can move with excessive freedom , trembling , vibrating , or rotating * " Proceedings Institution of Mechanical Engineers , " January , 1883 .

[ Dec. 20 ' through a small degree with infinitely less force than would be !
required to rotate it permanently on either side .
This property is sc J marked and general that we can observe it without any special iron i or apparatus .
" In order to observe this in electro-magnets , we must employ an extremely feeble current , such as from one Daniell cell , with an exterior resistance of from 10 to 1,000 ohms , and we then find the following laws hold with every variety of iron and steel:\#151 ; 1st .
That its magnetic capacity is directly as its softness or molecular freedom .
2nd .
That its resistance to a feeble external magnetising force is directly as its hardness , or its molecular rigidity .
This has proved to be the case upon sixty varieties of iron and ] steel furnished me direct from the manufacturers , and it was remarked j that each variety of iron or steel has a certain point , beyond which annealing cannot soften , nor temper harden ; consequently , if all varieties were equally and perfectly annealed , each variety would have I its own magnetic capacity ; or , its specific degree of value when perfectly annealed or tempered , by means of which , we could at once determine its place and quality .
If in place of several varieties we take a single specimen , say hard-drawn Swedish iron wire , and note its magnetic capacity , we find that its value rises rapidly with each partial annealing , until an ultimate softness is obtained ; being the limit of its molecular freedom .
We are thus enabled to study the best methods of annealing , and to find at once the degree of softness in an unknown specimen .
A similar effect occurs in observations upon tempering ; from the softest to the hardest temper , until we arrive at its ultimate molecular rigidity .
We have thus in each piece of iron or steel a limit of softness and hardness .
In soft Swedish iron tempering hardens but 25 per cent. , whilst mechanical ( Compression ( such as hammering ) hardens it 50 per cent. In cast steel tempering hardens it 400 per cent. , whilst mechanical compression gives but 50 per cent. Between cast steel and Swedish iron we find a long series of mild steel and hard iron , varying in their proportionate degree between the two extremes mentioned .
In order to carry out these researches , I constructed an instrument which 1 have called the magnetic balance .
It consists of a delicate silk fibre suspended magnetic needle , 5 centims. in length , its pointer resting near an index having a single fine black line or mark for its zero , the movement of the needle on either side of zero being limited to 5 millims. by means of two ivory stops , or projections .
When the north end of the needle and its index zero are north , the needle rests at its index zero , but the slightest external influence , such as a piece of iron 1 millim. in diameter 10 centims. distant , deflects the needle 1883 .
} On a Magnetic Balance .
so the right or left according to the polarity of its magnetism , and with a force proportional to its power .
If we place on the opposite iide of the needle at the same distance a wire possessing similar jolarity and force , the two are eqnal , and the needle returns to zero , vnd if we know the magnetic value required to produce a balance we inow the value of both .
In order to balance any wire or piece of Iron placed in a position east and west , a magnetic compensator is used , consisting of a powerful bar magnet free to revolve upon a central pivot , placed at a distance of 30 or more centims. , so as to be able to obtain delicate observations .
This turns upon an index , the ^degrees of which are marked for equal degrees of magnetic action upon the needle .
A coil of insulated wire , through which a feeble electric current is passing , magnetises the piece of iron under observation , but as the coil itself would act upon the needle , this is balanced by an equal and opposing coil on the opposite side , and we are thus enabled to observe the magnetism due to the iron alone .
A reversing key , resistance coils , ) and a Daniell .
cell are required .
Great care must be taken so that the electromotive force remains a constant , as a small variation in the electromotive force gives large variations in the readings , and many important details of construction are required , in order that it shall give perfect readings for extremely small magnetic force .
Still greater care is required that each specimen of iron or steel shall be annealed to its maximum .
Several methods of observation have been employed with the magnetic balance , the usual one being the one described , but interesting results are attained by observing the influence of earth 's magnetism alone on the iron or steel , or we may magnetise all specimens to the same value , and note the amount of current required .
We may observe the remaining magnetism after the cessation of the current or the influence of a weak current after the passage of a strong magnetising force .
' These are more applicable to researches upon the cause of magnetism .
By means of this instrument I have tested sixty varieties of iron and steel , mostly in the form of wires , a wire 1 millim. diameter , 10 centims. long , being the standard used .
In all comparative experiments we require one standard form , to which all the rest must be similar in form and size ; at present , we cannot readily compare a square or flat bar with a piece of wire , but if all pieces have the same orm , and all are annealed to the same standard , then any difference observed between them must be due to their comparative softness , ^rom which we can deduce its quality and place on the line from soft iron to cast steel .
Annealing not only produces softness and consequent molecular reedom , but it entirely frees it from all strains previously introduced n 2 170 Prof. D. E. Hughes .
[ Dec. 20 by drawing or hammering .
Thus a bar of iron drawn or hammered s has a peculiar structure , say a fibrous one , which gives a greater mechanical strength in one direction than another .
This bar i if thoroughly annealed at high temperatures , becomes homogeneous and has no longer even traces of its previous strains , provided that J there has been no actual mechanical separation into a distinct series * of fibres .

525 ' Prom the above table , we notice that a regular increase of softness occurs , as the temperature at which it is annealed increases , the maximum being at a point under that of fusion .
Numerous methods of annealing were tried , the highest results being obtained when the iron or steel was heated as rapidly as possible to a high temperature , and cooled in a neutral surrounding or atmosphere .
The facts regarding annealing as pointed out by the measurement of the magnetic capacity of iron , have , no doubt , been in great measure perceived by ordinary mechanical methods ; the results of my own researches may be thus formulated:\#151 ; 1 .
The highest degree of softness in any variety of iron or steel is that obtained by a rapid heating to the highest temperature less than fusion .
2 .
The time of gradual cooling required varies directly as the amount of carbon in alloy .
Thus in chemical pure iron rapid cooling , as in tempering , would not harden it , whilst steel might require several days , even for pieces only 1 millim. diameter .
Slow cooling has no injurious effect upon pure iron when cooled in a neutral surrounding , consequently where time is no object , we may employ slow cooling in every case .
A wire or piece of iron , thoroughly annealed , must not be bent , stretched , hammered , or filed , as the hardening effects of a bend are most remarkable , and the mere cleaning of its surface by sand paper hardens its surface several degrees .

From the above table it will be seen that every wire rises greatly in value by annealing , and that we could not estimate the true magnetic capacity of any iron or steel unless special attention was given that all should be annealed to their maximum .
The influence of tempering upon the magnetic retentivity or molecular rigidity has been shown in every piece of iron or steel examined , the molecular rigidity of tempered cast steel being proportional to its species of temper as shown in Table III .

] On the Circumpolar Expedition to Fort Rae .
173 Table IV gives the complete results of the mechanical , chemical , j in(j physical tests upon a series of wires furnished by Messrs. Fre-nS lerick Smith and Co. , of Halifax .
The tensile strength and electric conductivity are those furnished 11 me by Messrs. Smith and Co. The chemical analyses by Mr. Henry M :g4 Bell , of Sheffield , the magnetic capacity of the bright hard drawn , annealed , and tempered wires , were determined by myself by the aid .
iof the magnetic balance .
In the above Table IV there is a complete relation between electric : conductivity and magnetic capacity , both progressing in a similar ratio and agreeing in a most remarkable manner .
We see here that the electric conductivity and magnetic capacity have a complete relation to each other , but while in every wire .
measured I have found this true , it is only so when the wire has been completely annealed and free from mechanical strain , and a feeble ; i magnetic force employed , thus the relation exists only in the limited sphere of elastic rotation already mentioned .
I believe the relation here shown between electric conductivity and s : magnetic capacity to be of theoretical importance and of practical utility , as we at once find not only the electric conductivity of iron and steel from a simple reading of their magnetic capacity , but also the iron most suitable for the cores of electro-magnets .
