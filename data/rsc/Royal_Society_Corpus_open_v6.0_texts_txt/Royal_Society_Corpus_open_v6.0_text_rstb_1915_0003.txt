The aim of the investigations here entered upon is statistical analysis of the yield of agricultural crops in terms of the stages of the plant 's development .
When the yield is a fruit , then precedent stages determining the yield must be the flower and , before this , the development of flowering branches .
In such a case , for full analysis of the final yield , careful records of these stages must first be taken all through the development season of the crop .
The senior author has elaborated , during experiments on cotton in Egypt , the procedure for carrying out such analysis and the points to be attended to .
ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
Armed with this method of analysis the effects of environmental conditions on the development of the crop can be satisfactorily distinguished .
The chief factors of environment capable of control in field work are\#151 ; the space allowed to each plant , the date of sowing , the supply of water , of manures , and the choice of the year in which the crop is grown .
The present series deals in three parts with the effects of spacing , sowing-time and season , on Egyptian cotton grown at Giza in Egypt .
Consequent upon such analysis the experiments have a secondary object , which is to appreciate the reasons underlying the conventional practices of agriculture , and possibly to improve these practices .
An indirect result of such experiments is the accumulation of precise data which are subsequently of value in providing constants for studying special cases and new problems .
The numerical data in the Appendices of this account may , at first sight , appear unduly large in comparison with the length of the text .
The reason for this disparity is that conjectures as to accidental disturbing factors , which would necessarily form a large part of the discussion of any less complete set of experiments , are here almost entirely eliminated by the extent of the data .
The records are , in fact , so complete as to be easily understood .
Fully to realise the technical significance of this point would require citation of many contradictory statements from authorities on the agriculture of cotton , which statements , being based largely on subjectivity and on plot experiments of low precision , would serve for us no other useful purpose .
The presentation of these Appendices is further necessitated in that these analyses are the result of new and formerly unpublished methods , which are being extensively adopted in Egypt , and will before long be used in other parts of the world .
The methods are subject to many sources of error , which can only be avoided when fully understood , and this understanding can only be attained by study of the actual original data .
Material .
The choice of Egyptian cotton as the material for these experiments was due solely to circumstance .
The methods employed are essentially applicable to any other plant , provided that suitable modifications are introduced .
The cotton crop is peculiarly suitable in some respects , having a prolonged fruiting season , so that the yield is steadily built up , fruit by fruit , in an obvious way .
The nearest parallel in English crops is provided by the tomato .
In other respects cotton has marked disadvantages , and we were of opinion , before these experiments were conducted , that the analysis of yield in a cotton field would be more difficult than with a cereal crop .
The plants of Egyptian cotton are sown in March or April ; the seed is sown on ridges from 60 to 80 cm .
apart , and the clumps of seedlings are thinned out when well established , leaving two in each " hole " where seed had been sown ; the plants grow p 2 to a height of 1 or 2 metres , and the flowers are carried on lateral sympodia arising either from the main stem or from lateral monopodia .
Flowering begins in June and July according to district ; the opening of the capsules , or " bolls , " begins about 50 days later , and should continue until mid-November .
Late in the season the fields are dotted with three-lobed flocks of pale brown or white cotton hanging from the open capsules .
This " seed-cotton " is picked by hand , usually in three instalments , or " pickings , " and is sent to factories , where the hairs of " lint " are stripped from the seed by the " ginning " machinery , and compressed into bales .
The lint and seed are both exported , excepting for such seed as is held back for sowing ; the lint constitutes about one-third of the seed-cotton by weight , and about five-sixths by value .
The export of cotton provides about four-fifths of the income of modern Egypt .
The crop is , of course , grown entirely under irrigation .
Methods of Yield Analysis .
The methods employed may be grouped under the headings of sampling , arrangement of the variables to be studied , daily collection of data for constructing the life-history under each variation of the environment , together with computation and the graphic presentation of results .
Sampling.\#151 ; The areas of land employed were sub-divided into plots not larger than 80 square metres each .
Five or more plots of any one kind of spacing , etc. , were scattered over the area .
The actual observations were restricted to a group of plants demarcated in some convenient way in the centre of each plot ; in the spacing experiment these plants had to be so chosen as to eliminate those which were being affected by abnormal causes ; otherwise , the group is taken at random .
The number of plants in each group should be about 150 , so as to reduce the probable error caused by individual fluctuation from plant to plant , and by constitutional differences due to varietal impurity .
The use of pure strains for such work would eliminate the latter source of error .
Such groups are usually termed " Observation rows " in Egypt and the Sudan , where they are now being employed extensively for research on cotton .
The average plant of an observation row is thus a fair sample of its plot , while the average of all five sets of rows from one kind of plot is a fair sample of the area , soil variations having been largely eliminated by the scatter of small plots .
Other considerations with regard to sampling , such as the recognition of real differences from one day to another , are discussed later .
Arrangement of the Variables investigated.\#151 ; The variable whose effects were studied in each experiment was modified in as many steps as was possible .
Thus the spacings employed were ten in number , ranging from 0'12 to 2*75 square metres per plant , and the sowing-time ran weekly from mid-February to mid-April .
In this way each statistical number obtained had its place in at least two series , firstly in the ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
time-series which makes the life-history of the average plant , and secondly in the series of variables for all the average plants .
The arrangement of series in this way permits of the plotting of curves , with consequent increased insight into the meaning of results .
To determine the effect of a variable at three intensities only may produce the impression of a simple relation , expressible graphically by a straight line joining three points , whereas a fuller record may show the real relation to be more complex , as in the curve for total yield with various spacings ( fig. 9 , p. 179 ) .
Daily Collection of Data.\#151 ; For similar reasons to those just mentioned , all data with regard to the life-history of each group of plants , and consequently of the average plant under each condition , were taken daily wherever it was possible to do so .
These continuous records of growth , flowering , fruiting , etc. , form the distinctive feature of these experiments , and they will therefore be treated separately under the designations by which they are now commonly known in Egypt , e.y. the flowering-curve .
The original data for flowering , * on which this method of plant-development curves was built up , were taken personally by the senior author .
A native gardener , subsequently headman of the native staff when the Giza Laboratory was founded , next took a share in the recording , and\#151 ; in conjunction with the junior author\#151 ; ultimately trained a staff of Plant Observers , who were recruited for their general intelligence from the ordinary Fellaheen ; the only formal education required from these men was the ability to write numerals , preferably Roman as well as Arabic .
They were seven in number in 1913 , but the taking of the records embodied in these experiments formed only a small part of their duties .
Their numerical records were made on filing-cards or in notebooks , and transferred daily to a card file in the laboratory by the headman .
Check counts were taken for safety 's sake by the headman , and less frequently by the authors , but any flagrant error could be detected by the computer when plotting the daily averages , through the abnormal run of a curve .
Such inexactitudes were very rare , and we are both indebted to our Plant Observers for the excellent work which they performed at the wage of ordinary labour , and at the cost of some trouble on our part in devising suitable methods for them .
This experiment in organisation lasted two years , and was so completely successful that it deserves careful consideration .
Computations were made by the senior author until 1913 , when a computing clerk was trained , and with his assistance it became practicable to bring figures up to date each day instead of allowing them to accumulate until the end of the season .
They were , therefore , promptly plotted on wall diagrams , enabling us by noon of each day to see at a glance the exact condition of any series of plots .
A valuable means for avoiding any falsification is the labelling of all plots with serial numbers only , thus preventing bias in the observers ' minds and restricting them to observation only .
Plant-development Curves ( fig. 1 , et seq. ) .
These methods of determining and presenting the life-history of a crop in the form of curves showing the daily behaviour of an average plant , were slowly developed by the authors from the first determination of flowering data in 1906 .
The experiments here described from observations made by our native plant observers in 1912 * 'Khed .
Agric .
Soc. Year Book , ' 1909 , p. 44 , \amp ; c. and 1913 were , in one sense , intended to be a demonstration of the capabilities of these methods for analytical purposes , and were also arranged so as to investigate the possible errors of the methods under the stringent test of application to field work .
Growth-curve.\#151 ; The curve showing the daily rate of growth of the central axis is obtained , when required , by direct measurement with dividing compasses , or by a water-level .
A better method is to fix a peg , with a notched top , in the ground by the side of each plant observed , and to measure the height of the axil of the youngest leaf to the nearest half-centimetre , by resting the end of a scale in the notch .
Observations can thus be taken rapidly with unskilled labour , and the error of each separate measurement is smoothed out by the large number of plants which can be observed .
All data for plotting in the growth-curve are worked out to " millimetres growth per plant per day , " or " mm.p.p.p.d .
" The chief interest of this daily record was originally physiological , but in 1912 we found a direct connection between it and the flowering-curve , which will be discussed under the effect of season .
For the moment it is sufficient to mention that the growth of the main stem and of the flowering branches are closely correlated during the .
early part of the season , so that the growth-curve may be used as an index to the rate at which the " scaffolding " of flowering branches is being laid down .
Flowering-curve.\#151 ; This curve represents the rate of flowering , the number of flowers opening day by day throughout the season .
The flower only remains open for a single day , so that counting is relatively simple .
The observed data are computed in terms of the average plant and plotted as " flowers per plant per day , " or " flowers p.p.p.d. " Th6 data from the experiments on spacing and sowing-time have been smoothed to weekly means in the Appendices to save space .
There are certain errors to which these determinations of flowering are subject .
{ a ) Errors due to soil variation are partly eliminated by the scatter of plots , but a large number of plots or rows are required to avoid them completely , ( b ) Errors due to plant-to-plant fluctuation ( or to constitutional differences between the plants of one commercial variety ) may be reduced by increasing the number of plants observed ; the probable error of the total number of flowers actually produced during a season by a single plant is about \#177 ; 30 per cent. , so that a family of 100 plants is needed to give a reasonably accurate figure for total production ; a further increase is required to obtain equal accuracy in the daily production , but since this increase begins to involve errors from soil variation , the proper size of group to observe is about 150 plants , ( c ) The third source of error is the daily change in rate of flowering , which is common to large areas , and would appear to be shown on some days at least by all the fields in Egypt , whatever their previous history ; discussion of this will also be postponed till the account of seasonal effects , but for the moment it should be noted that a true flower-curve can only be obtained by counting the ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
flowers every day ; if one day or another is taken at random , the probable error of the deviation from the true mean rate is about \#177 ; 9 per cent , through this cause alone .
These three errors are illustrated in the appended table ( p. 110 ) , which is drawn from the data for nine pairs of rows of a commercial variety of cotton .
The rate at which the flowers open , on which the form of the flowering-curve depends , is really determined in the first instance by the rate at which the flower-buds were differentiated , as we shall show later ; this rate is only slightly modified\#151 ; in the Egyptian cotton crop\#151 ; by subsequent environmental changes , excepting when these changes provoke bud-shedding .
In this case , the bud having fallen off , the flower is not present when its turn comes to open .
Consequently , the form of the flowering-curve within the same kind of cotton is an indirect measure of the growth and dimensions of the flowering branches .
These branches are sympodia , borne laterally on a main stem or on monopodial lateral branches of the same .
The first determinant is , therefore , the number of flowering branches formed acropetally along the main stem , the second is the extent to which lateral monopodia behave in the same way , like subsidiary main stems , adding their quota to the first , and the third determinant is the number of flowers which each flowering branch produces .
All three are inter-related through growth , and differentiated through local senescence .
The flowering-curve may be curtailed quite abruptly by causes which not only check the growth of the branches but also cause the buds to be shed , such as root-asphyxiation in field crop by a rise of the water-table , or a scorching wind , or a cold night .
If the cause is less severe in its action , checking growth , but not causing shedding of the buds , the curve is not curtailed until all the buds have opened as flowers .
It should here be mentioned that " shedding , " to a certain degree , is a normal occurrence in the field crop of Egyptian cotton .
If it were possible to plot a curve for the number of flower-buds differentiated it would be of slightly greater amplitude than the flowering-curve .
Similarly , the open flower appears to be peculiarly susceptible to shedding , possibly for chemical reasons connected with transpiration , so that the amplitude of the fruiting-curve , or boiling-curve , is always less than that of the flowering-curve from which it is derived .
Bolling-curve.\#151 ; This curve expresses the rate of production of ripe fruits , or boiling , per plant per day , in the same way as the previous curve expresses the flowers .
The data should be obtained by daily counting , or picking , of the ripe cotton from the bolls opened , but\#151 ; since the completion of boll-opening is not quite sharply defined\#151 ; it is usually more convenient to make the count once a week .
This weekly count embodies the total of all the bolls which have opened during the week , and is thus comparable with the expression of the flowering-curve in weekly mean rates , already mentioned as being convenient .

Ill It should , however , be remembered that these weekly expressions are not suitable for precise work , a single day being the real time-unit .
Changes of considerable importance may take place in the form of these curves during a week and yet be completely masked in the weekly means .
The boiling-curve is expressed in " number of bolls per plant per day , " or " bolls jD.p.p.d .
" Multiplying the data by the number of plants on the unit area we can plot the boiling curve per unit area per day , or , in other words , the yield-curve .
If the weights of the contents of the boll are known we can plot the yield-curve in terms of seed cotton .
If the ratios of lint obtained in ginning from the seed cotton are similarly know we can plot the yield-curve in terms of the final product , viz. , the lint itself .
By addition of the mean rates on all the days of the boiling season we can obtain the total yield , either as number of bolls , jveight of seed cotton , or weight of lint per plant or per area .
By adding these rates in successive groups , according to the days on which the conventional " pickings " would have been taken , we can obtain the pickings , and can also see how much they would have been affected by variations in the date of picking .
If the mean seed weight is known we can also compute the number of seeds produced per plant or per unit area .
Other Curves.\#151 ; Statistics for the weight of seed cotton per boll , yield of lint from seed cotton , and seed weight during each week of the season , were taken in the spacing experiment only .
It will there be seen that these components have only a subsidiary effect on the yield-curve , but the statistics for these characteristics have been included in the spacing experiment account because , although negative in so far as the demonstration of spacing effects is concerned , they not only represent an amount of detailed examination which is rarely practicable in applied botany , but they also demonstrate the untenable nature of many conjectures made in the past ; as such , they should be useful for reference .
Other records , such as the length and strength of the lint , which can also be handled in conjunction with the curves already described , were not taken systematically in connection with these experiments , nor is it necessary to include the parallel records of meteorological conditions , soil-water content , water table , etc. , which were obtained concurrently with these experiments , in part or completely , for special purposes .
In the two parts which follow , the senior author is more responsible for the design of the experiments and the presentation of the results , while the junior author more particularly undertook the administration of the experimental work .
The work was conducted at the Giza Botanical Laboratory and Cotton Experiment Station , during our tenure of the posts of Botanist and Assistant Botanist to the Egyptian Government Department of Agriculture , as a side issue of our work on VOL. COVI.\#151 ; B. o pure-strain supply of cotton seed .
The fundamental researches , on which our methods and interpretations are constructed , were effected when we were holding similar posts under the Khedivial Agricultural Society of Egypt .
To both these bodies our thanks are due for those facilities which they willingly placed at our disposal .

Note.\#151 ; The interpretations placed on the data obtained in these experiments are founded on the views outlined by one of us in The Cotton Plant in Egypt ' ( Macmillan , 1912 ) , with such extensions as subsequent research has suggested .
Concurrently with these investigations we were conducting others which were necessitated by our official task of isolating , propagating , testing , and understanding pure lines of Egyptian cotton .
Data drawn from these others have been made use of here , and conversely .

The aims of this experiment , in addition to the purposes already described in the General Introduction , of analysing " yield/ ' were to ascertain the space which could with advantage be allowed to each plant for the rapid multiplication of pedigree seed , and also to ascertain the reasons which underlie the local native custom of very close planting , '1 ' which causes a struggle for existence between the plants composing the field crop .
A large area was divided into rectangular plots among which were distributed the different spacings which it had been decided to study .
These are stated in detail on the chart ( p. 114 ) , and a plan of the area is added to show the scatter of the spacings .
* * The Fellaheen custom of close planting has been condemned by many visitors to Egypt , and by most authorities , as being inimical to good cultivation and prejudicial to the yield .
It has been stated that such planting delays maturity , prevents the access of light and air among the plants , and that wide planting is the first reform which should be introduced into Egyptian cotton cultivation .
Early plot experiments had given contradictory results .
The authors shared this condemnatory opinion until their spacing experiment had been conducted ( fig. 2 , p. 172 ) .
The point is a good illustration of the enormous subjective error involved in dealings with cotton .
ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
Limitations .
The results as they stand are necessarily true for one variety , site , and season only , in respect to the agricultural bearings of the experiment .
On the other hand , the dissection of the components which make up the yield is very much fuller than anything that has been carried out before , so that predictions for other sites and seasons may be made with reasonable certainty .
To enter into details with regard to such possible modifications is scarcely necessary , and it may suffice to state that the conclusions would hold good under any ordinary conditions of cultivation in any part of Egypt.* Limiting Factors of the Environment .
These may be grouped as those which affect any well cultivated plants in the Egyptian crop at some time in their life-history , and as those special ones which are correlated with the different spacings adopted in this experiment .
General Limiting Factors.\#151 ; Absorption of water by the seed-coat , itself influenced by temperature , is followed by temperature control almost exclusively from germination until the first flowers appear , excepting for the " sunshine effect .
" Soil temperature limits the growth of the root system in the early stages , and hence of the stem also .
Growth of the stem is restricted mainly to the hours of darkness , the intense insolation of each day necessitating rapid water-loss for cooling purposes .
The amount of growth of the stem at night is dependent mainly on the night temperatures , when once a sufficient root system has developed .
In the early development of the lateral branches their growth follows that of the main stem .
At about the time when the first flowers are opening the growth of the main stem ceases to follow the night temperature , and the branches successively do the same .
This would appear to be due to some restricting form of autotoxic effect .
Throughout the greater part of the season the plants receive a check every afternoon , the stomata closing and growth and assimilation being stopped , on account of the inability of the soil to give up as much water as the root needs .
Later in the season , when the bolls are ripening , it would seem , from evidence drawn from fluctuations in lint-length , that with very good cultivation the water supply is the principal limiting factor .
If water supply is deficient senescence follows , and recovery from it may require the lapse of several weeks .
On most permeable soils in Egypt the growth is checked ultimately by the rise of the water table , which varies in date with the arrival of the Nile flood and with the locality .
At the time when this happens the crop may be transpiring nearly 50 tons of water per acre per day , t and the asphyxiation of the lower roots necessarily brings * It is ' of course understood that in the cooler north of the Delta , and on poor land where the plants attain only half the size they reach at Giza , the planting should be closer , as it is actually made by the Fellaheen .
The Giza custom represents almost the maximum space-allowance per plant which is permissible in Egypt .
t See Hughes , F. , ' Cairo Sci. Journ. , ' 1914 , and \V .
L. B. , ' Journ. Agric .
Sci. , ' 1913 .
about a severe check.# The depth of the root system at this time is about 2 metres , and the plants can thus only escape the effects in impermeable soils or where drainage can keep the water table below this level .
Crops growing on impermeable soils may suffer in the same way , however , through excessive watering .
Apart from the general history of a plant under good cultivation , there are detailed local factors , of which the commonest are : variations in soil texture down to the 2-metre depth , which are extremely frequent in deltaic soil ; deficiency in available nitrogen ; excess of salt ; presence of weeds which have an indirectly toxic result on * the cotton plant , and insect pests .
Water supply in Egypt is , or should be , under complete control .

Each spacing employed involves two components , viz. , the " density " of the population on a given area , and the " arrangement " or relative geometrical position of the individuals .
The " a " series consists of plants standing singly , or one to every " hole " ; the " b " series , of paired plants , or two to every hole , as in the conventional field practice .
Thus la is half the density of 15 , and so forth .
See also the diagrams attached to fig. 9 .
Limiting Factors Controlled by Spacing.\#151 ; Variations in soil texture , composition , weeds , salt , etc. , were eliminated by plot scatter in this experiment , and controllable insect pests were suppressed , while the uncontrollable Farias did relatively little damage .
In progressing from closely crowded plants to wide sowings , the incidence of the limiting factors would appear to be affected in the following ways :\#151 ; Increasing volume of soil allowed to each plant lessens the proportion of soil particles * The water-table effect is of more than academic interest in Egypt .
An exceptionally early flood in 1909 brought about a catastrophic failure of a very promising crop .
We shall deal with its seasonal effects in Part III , and also point out how a rough computation of the percentage of permeable soils in Egypt may be made by means of the flowering-curve .
ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
actually in contact with the root system , and hence lessens the proportionate loss of water from the soil by transpiration .
On the other hand , since the soil is less shaded by foliage , the water loss from the surface soil by direct evaporation is much higher in wide spacings after flowering has begun .

The lessened occupation of the surface soil by roots implies less " root interference " ; hence any limitation due to available soil water , or to nutrient salts dissolved therein , should take place at a later date in wide sowings .
On the other hand , the free circulation of wind and the hot dry surface soil around wide-sown plants increases their 116 MESSRS .
W. L. BALLS AND F. S. HOLTON transpiration , but it has seemed to us that the self-regulation of the plant as between the functions of root and shoot tends to minimise these differences .
Thus , wilting and stomatal closure on a hot afternoon appear to set in at nearly the same time in all spacings .
The principal limiting factor controlled by spacing is thus the amount of nutrient salts in soil water solution at the disposal of each plant .
The aerial spacing appears to be of less importance , contrary to accepted belief ; it is almost impossible to differentiate between the two components , but the light in Egypt is so intense that obvious shade adaptations are not developed until fairly late in the season , and then on the lower branches alone .
Arrangement of the Experiment .
The area of 2 acres was divided into 50 plots , each 10x16 metres , the respective spacing on each of them being shown on the chart on p. 114 .
Adjacent ridges in any one plot were sown en echelon throughout ( see diagrams in fig. 9 ) .
A plan was made to show the position and seedling condition of every plant on the area , and the planting was very carefully done , so that every plant on the 2 acres was within 2 cm .
of its correct place .
The observation rows were marked with tall stakes and their positions demarcated on the plan .
Abnormal or stunted plants were excluded from these observed groups .
The small size of some of these observed groups ( see Tables I-XX in the Appendix ) was due to accidental causes which are explained under " Agricultural Details , Stunting , " below .
All spacings were duplicated in two series ; series a consisted of plants standing singly , series h of two plants growing together in one " hole , " as in the conventional field cultivation .
The use of two plants standing together is almost peculiar to Egypt .
It has formerly been thought to be merely an insurance against accidental damage ; our results show that the reason lies deeper .
These separate series , a and b , were obtained by dividing each plot into two halves , the southern half being thinned to single plants to make the a series , while the northern half was thinned to two plants to make the b series .
The spacings employed ( see p. 114 ) were arranged from Spacing 1 , which was the densest sowing , and closer than conventional practice in the Giza district , up to Series 10 , w'hich was the widest sowing , and was similar to the arrangement we had , employed for investigations in genetics .
To this progression were added Spacings 6 and 7 , which provided duplicate densities of other spacings hut with different spatial arrangement , the plants being closer set on the ridge , hut the ridges farther apart .
The sequence of spacings thus runs in both the a and b series as follows :\#151 ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
As between the a and b series some further duplication of densities should he noted ; thus 5b and 7b were of the same density of population as 6a and 3a , though differently arranged.* Perfect symmetry of arrangement , so that each plant of every spacing should occupy the vertical axis of an imaginary regular hexagonal prism of soil , was not practicable on account of the exigencies of irrigation .
It will be seen later that such arrangement would probably be ideal .
Scatter of reduplicated plots is even more necessary with cotton than with some other crops , owing to the practical impossibility of obtaining soil which is uniform to the full depth of the cotton root .
The scatter employed in this experiment is shown on the plan ( p. 115 ) .
There is no evidence that neighbouring plots affect one another , at least as regards their respective observation rows , though one might have expected the humidity of the air in a wide sown plot to have been raised by the proximity of a close sown plot .
If any effects of this kind were present at the edges they have been satisfactorily eliminated by the use of observation rows , which were taken from the centre of each plot when possible .
In addition , the scatter was so arranged that each plot of one kind was not merely in a different part of the area , but also was in juxtaposition with different neighbours .
The identity of similar plots of cotton on even such a small area as 2 acres is really little more than nominal.- In ffg .
3 we have plotted three sets of " boiling-curves " of five such plots each to illustrate this , f The variations among the close-sown plots are the largest , probably on account of the more severe water strain ; two of the plots in la begin to degrade nearly a month before their normal curtailment by the water table , presumably through water shortage ; yet these plots received as nearly equal irrigations as was possible without actual measurement over weirs , and the differences must be primarily due to deep-seated patches ol sand and clay which we know existed in the area .
Agricultural Details .
The land employed was a square of 95 metres side , lying to the west of the laboratory building , with well No. 5 in its centre ( see map , 'Cairo Sci. Jour .
, ' May , 1914 ) .
* It may be noted here that while our Spacing 2 bis that of conventional practice in the Giza district of Egypt , our Spacing 6a is nearly the conventional practice with American Upland cotton in the U.S.A. Our 6a was spaced at 30 x 150 cm .
as against 30 x 120 cm .
in the States .
This width between the rows is there necessary , in order to permit of the use of horse-hoes , hand labour being too expensive .
Our 6a gave 59 bolls per square metre ; correcting to the U.S.A. spacing , this would not be more than 74 bolls , as against 95 bolls from our 2 b. Thus it would appear that the yield per area might be increased in the U.S.A. by quite 25 per cent , if the cost of labour would permit of hand cultivation .
Our experience of Upland cottons leads us to think that the difference in species would not affect the general principle of this deduction .
t This fig. 3 provides a demonstration of the way in which these plant-development curves serve almost entirely to eliminate the probable error of any one plot .
An error which can thus be recognised is not a " probable error .
" There were no divisions other than the usual irrigation furrows and ridges , except one path of 50 cm .
wide traversing it from east to west .
There was no thoroughfare through or round the area .
Irrigation ditches bordered it on the north and south , along which margins a belt of five ridges was excluded from the experiment in case seepage should take place from the ditches .
The area was sub-divided into 54 plots , each 10 x 16 metres ; Nos. 43 , 44 , 49 , and 50 were excluded from the experiment and used for physiological research .
The remaining 50 were sown as shown on p. 115 .
Preparatory Cultivation.\#151 ; Ploughed and rolled January 25 , after a winter fallow .
Cross ploughed February 12 .
Rolled and ridged up February 27 .
Ridges made up at 75 cm .
apart .
Sowing.\#151 ; From March 16 to 20 , using dry seed of the Assili variety , treated with naphthalene dressing .
Correct spacing ensured by sowing along 4-metre gauge rods , with coloured wool bound round at the correct intervals ; rods aligned on a stretched string in starting each plot .
All plots sown en Echelon from ridge to ridge .
Watering followed on March 21 , which is thus the effective sowing date .
This is near the " critical date " for the land in question , as shown by the Sowing Date experiments .
Seedlings appeared above ground on March 28 , the stand of seedlings being almost perfect .
A little re-sowing was done on April 9 .
Map.\#151 ; A map was made in May to show every plant on the area , noting its condition as stunted , normal , or re-sown .
A set of observation rows was then selected in the centre of each half plot , containing as nearly 200 plants as was possible without including re-sown or stunted plants .
Each row was marked out by a 2-metre stake at each end , to which was nailed a cardboard label bearing in pencil the serial number of each plot ( not the spacing number ) and the letter a or b , accordingly as one or two plants had been left in each hole .
Stunting.\#151 ; The laboratory was newly built , having been first occupied on April 1 , and the land taken over from poor cultivation .
It was full of " negeel " grass ( which exercises a severe indirect toxic effect on cotton , and is as difficult as couch grass to deal with .
The observation rows were so chosen as to eliminate this toxic soil almost completely , though often at the cost of serious reduction in the number of plants included in the rows ( see Appendix , Tables I-XX ) .
Thinning.\#151 ; The clumps of seedlings in each hole were thinned by cutting out with scissors , and not by pulling , to two plants per hole on April 22 , and in the a half plots were further thinned to one plant on May 1 .
Waterings.\#151 ; March 21 at sowing , April 27 , May 30 , June 23 , July 17 , August 13 , September 11 , and October 17 .
Hoeings.\#151 ; The usual three were given after the first three waterings , and then desultory hoeing in those plots where the spacing of the plants was sufficiently wide .
Insect Pests.\#151 ; The cotton worm ( Prodenia littoralis ) first appeared on June 5 , and a very severe brood descended during the night of June 23 , following the irrigation of that day .
It was entirely eradicated by hand picking , assisted after the first day or two by deaths from natural causes .
Counts of the number of egg masses from each plot gave some useful information on the " psychology " of the moth .
Aphides appeared as usual on a few marginal plots and were sprayed with kerosene emulsion .
Boll worm ( insulana)was slight , as the figures for boll weight show ( Appendix I , Table XLI ) .
Flowering.-\#151 ; Began on June 8 .
Numbers per plot counted every day until the observation rows were completely arranged .
From June 23 to August 17 the counts were taken on the observation rows only , every day .
After the latter date a part of the available labour had to be diverted to boll picking and counting ; the flower counts were thenceforward taken on alternate days , namely : Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday for Plots 1-24 ; Sunday , A\ ednesday , and Friday for Plots 25-54 .
This left Monday as a free day for special work .
Bolling.\#151 ; The number of bolls open on the observation rows were counted and picked each week .
The work , being more than it was convenient to do on a single day , was similarly halved ; Plots 1-24 were ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
picked on Monday , 25-54 on Tuesday .
The first 100 bolls picked ( or the counted number if less than 100 ) from each plot were put into boxes and removed to the laboratory .
Boll Weight , etc.\#151 ; These bolls from each week were weighed to obtain the mean boll weight .
Each lot was then ginned on the 12-inch roller hand gin , and the lint weighed to determine the ginning out-turn .
Ten grammes of seed from each ginning were then weighed and counted out to obtain the mean seed weight .
These operations began on August 12 and ended on November 5 , taking two days in each week , and making a total of 1300 pickings and ginnings , nearly 4000 weighings , and the counting of 150,000 seeds .
The weighings for ginning out-turn were all made immediately after ginning , and are thus comparable interse although no correction is made for humidity ; hence the actual values are rather low , aided by the fact that Giza is rather too far south for the Assili variety .
Counting seeds in a known weight is both faster and safer than weighing a counted number when native labour is employed .
Grading.\#151 ; About 500 grm. of seed cotton were picked in conventional pickings from the plants of each plot which were not included in the observation rows .
Yield.\#151 ; Plot No. 44 was picked to check the yields computed from the observation rows .
It gave 6 kantars as against a computed yield of 6T5 kantars .
Cost of Experiment.\#151 ; The details of the time table have been given above because the conduct of the experiment was only an item in a very heavy season 's work , so that a regular routine was necessary .
It may also be stated that the cost , when properly organised , was not great ; .\#163 ; 30 included every expense over and above the cost of conducting an ordinary cultivation of the area .
The Data Recorded .
The primary data recorded are presented in full in Appendix I , with the following condensations :\#151 ; Daily flowering is condensed to the weekly totals to save space ; boll weight , out-turn , and seed weight , are condensed to the means of each spacing , instead of presenting the separate determinations for each plot .
These last show no features of interest for our present purpose .
The secondary data computed from these recorded data are given in Appendix 11 .
Graphic presentations have been made of sufficient data from these two appendices to allow the reader to follow the discussion of results , without necessarily consulting the actual numbers .
The discussion therefore treats of the data as curves , and not as numbers .
These curves are set out as figs. 1-11 , in Appendix III .
The Flowering-curve .
We were unable , from accidental causes , to mark out all the observation rows before flowering began .
Counts were therefore taken on the entire plots up to June 22 , on which date the flowering-curve proper begins .
Since early flowering is an important factor in yield , some data from these plot counts are given to amplify the systematic data embodied in the curves .
We have taken the total flowers for the first five days after the beginning of flowering on June 8 , and also the number open on another day taken at random , viz. , June 15 .
In columns parallel to these we have placed expectation numbers , which are merely ratio numbers proportional to the density of plants on equal areas of each spacing .
It will be seen that in each spacing the early VOL. CCVI.-B .
R flower-production per plant is the same , within the probabilities , except the last plots of Spacings 1 and 2 .
These two plots were adjacent , being Nos. 52 and 53 ( see Tables I-XX in Appendix I ) , and their precocity was certainly due to some local soil difference .

Our remarks on these flowering-curves will deal successively with the beginning of the curve , the rise of the curve , the maximum , and the decline of flowering .
The earliest beginning of the curve for all spacings is the same , as we have seen in the foregoing table .
Such differences as exist are not regular and are due to accident .
Consequently , there can have been no functional interference between the roots of even the closest sown plants at the time when they differentiated their first flower-buds .
This fact is of primary importance in the analysis of yield .
The greater the number of plants on the area the greater will be the early yield , other things being equal .
With a crop which gives one almost simultaneous " yield , " such as wheat , the root-interference effect should be very important .
The rise of the curve in this particular experiment is slightly abnormal , as we had delayed our irrigation rather too long in early June .
We shall see when dealing with the effects of season that the true daily flowering-curve tends to smooth during its rise to an approximately straight line .
These spacing experiment curves , on the contrary , all show a slight check during this rise , but this difference from the ideal form merely decreases the definiteness of our final results , and does not alter them qualitatively .
The rise is , of course , due to the successive steady increase in the number of later flowering branches on which flowers are ready to open .
This part of the flowering-curve is , in fact , a reduplication of the growth-curve of the central axis during the time when the latter was producing the flowering branches.* * A conception of the branching system of the plant as a kind of scaffolding upon which bud after bud is formed , each to open as a flower after a well defined time , has been found very useful .
It has led to ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
Comparison of the curves in fig. 2 shows that this rise of the curve comes to an end later and later with wider spacings .
Further , whereas the curve of lb ceases to rise in the week ending on July 12 , that of la\#151 ; which represents a spacing of half the lb density\#151 ; does not stop until the following week .
Thus , the date at which root-interference begins , with consequent limitation of growth rate by the available soil water and nutrient salts , depends on the volume of soil available , as one would expect.* In the widest sowing the curve is still rising when the curtailing effect of the water table comes into operation ; with such spacings there is no rest at a maximum , but in the close sowings the curve remains horizontal under the control of this soil water limiting factor for several weeks .
That this arresting factor is not aerial may be further deduced from the fact that , on June 30 , it is still possible to see the soil between the plants in photographs taken from above ; since the flower-bud takes not less than three weeks to develop into a flowrer , it follows that the horizontal position which the curve of 1 b takes up in the week ending July 12 was determined in the week ending June 21 , before aerial interference had begun .
Comparison between the a and b series introduces a further complication .
The closest sowings of a and b may be explained as above , but in the wider sowings it is evident that this explanation will not suffice .
Comparing , for example , the curves ol 8a and 86 , they both have the same form , the maximum being attained at the same time and lasting for the same time .
The only difference is in the amplitude of the curve , which is nearly twice as great in 8a as in 86 .
Here we appear to be dealing with a factor which is akin in its incidence to a toxin rather than to an ordinary limiting factor , it being continuous in its action and " depressing the vitality " of the plant ; actually there can be little doubt that it is in reality the same limiting factor of soil water , but that it is brought into play each afternoon of the season at an earlier hour when two root systems are interlaced in the same spot .
This would give it the appearance of a continuous action .
Here , again , it would seem that the effect of aerial interference between branches has been overrated .
As regards the maximum of the curve , its height is partly dependent on the number of lateral monopodial branches produced , which branches in their turn bear flowers to augment those produced on the main stem .
The height of the latter was the same in all spacings at all times of the season , so that the flower production of all the main developments of these methods , in which the behaviour of the crop is not merely recorded , but forecasted through records of the building up of the scaffolding .
The point will be dealt with more fully in Part III .
* We have been unable to disentangle the effects of soil-water as such from the effects of the nutrient salts dissolved therein .
A standard set of experiments was conducted by Mr. F. Hughes in many different sites in Egypt ( ' Khed .
Agric .
Soc. Year Book , ' 1909 ) , which showed that , under the accepted methods of cultivation , there were no recognisable effects from manurial treatment .
This conclusion applies nevertheless to the final yield only , and it is still possible that nutrient effects may be involved for short periods and may ultimately be recognisable by these curves .
R 2 stems in all the spacings was initially the same , but in the closest sowings practically no lateral monopodia were developed , whereas in wide spacings the plants branched extensively .
The initiation , rise , and maximum of the flowering-curve having been discussed , it remains to consider its fall , or curtailment .
This might result from growth limitation by temperature as the winter comes on , but such is rarely the case under Egyptian conditions .
It might also happen that the growth of the main stem and its monopodia had been prematurely checked by senescence , in which case no more flowering branches could be formed , and the flowering-curve would tail off gradually , as the existing flowering branches opened their last flowTers ; this is an unusual phenomenon in modern Egypt .
It is , however , shown regularly by American Upland plants growing under the climatic conditions of Giza .
The commonest cause which curtails the flowering-curve is the rise of the water table .
In this experiment it is the sole regular cause .
Details as to its action may be relegated to the subsequent account of seasonal effects , and it suffices to note here the effect on the various spacings .
In the closest sowings the flowering responded almost immediately to the immersion of the root system up to 170 cm .
from the surface , as is showm by the curve of lb , which is practically of the same form as the curve of the level in the water wells would be if turned upside down .
Wider sowings show a less and less marked effect , but even the widest are suddenly curtailed four weeks later .
We have , unfortunately , no statistical records of bud-shedding to prove our interpretation of this delay , but the explanation would appear to be very simple .
In very close sowings the roots are so completely occupying the available soil by the autumn that its upper layers are partially exhausted , and\#151 ; as we know from independent investigations already quoted\#151 ; the layers at 150 cm .
, and even lower , are then much the most important source of soil water , and probably also of nutrient salts .
Asphyxiation of the roots in these lower layers entirely destroys the water equilibrium between root and shoot , and extensive shedding is the result , both of open flowers and also of buds .
The buds being shed flowering must stop immediately .
In the widest spacings , on the other hand , the lower layers are not of the same proportionate importance , nor even of the same relative size , since the non-interference of laterals leaves the functional root system in its natural conical form , instead of compressing it to a cylinder or prism .
Consequently , the disturbance is less sudden and does not provoke shedding , so that no immediate effect is shown by the flowering-curve .
Nevertheless , growth of the flowering branches is checked by the diminution of the root supply , and flowering must come to an end when all the buds on the branches have unfolded .
Since the bud takes three to four weeks to unfold from its first differentiation , the flowering-curve in these wide sowings is not curtailed until a month after root asphyxiation has taken place .
Intermediate spacings show a mixture of the two effects in varying proportions , part of the curtailment of the curve taking place immediately through bud-shedding , ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
and part taking place a month later through cessation of growth ; the result is that these curves appear to present a steady progression ( see , fig. 11 ) .
Before passing on to the boiling-curve , it may with advantage be noted that the statements just made with regard to the effects of such an obvious modification of the environment as a sudden rise of the water table are equally good for less obvious and sudden modifications .
A slightly hotter or drier day may act thus , doing more damage to the close sowings than to the wide sowings , urdess duly counteracted by such attention to the soil-water contents as is not possible under field conditions of cultivation .
Hence , the closer the plants are sown , the more skilful must the cultivation be , until further skill becomes impossible of application in actual practice .
The Boiling-curve .
The curves for boll production per plant , expressed by the number of ripe bolls per plant per day in each weekly period , are plotted in fig. 5 from the data in Tables XXI-XL of Appendix I. They do not present many new features , being identical with the flowering-curves from which they were derived , as to their form , but differing in amplitude .
The difference is due to the shedding of about 40 per cent , of the flowers after they have opened .
This difference is practically constant throughout all varieties of cotton in any part of Egypt , though some suffer more in the south , where it is hotter .
The fact that all spacings are equally affected has a direct bearing on our former conclusion , that the automatic self-regulation of the plant is sufficient to compensate for the different environmental conditions .
It also indicates that the cause of this comparative constancy in shedding is one which acts at regular intervals over a short period , and there can be little doubt that the condition of water-strain which occurs every afternoon is this cause .
Although the average amount of shedding in good cultivation is practically constant , there are fluctuations from the average with which we shall deal later .
That there should be such a marked resemblance between the curves of flowering and of boiling is important in the analysis of yield , since it indicates that flowering is the principal determinant ; and since flowering in its turn can be traced back to branching , it follows that the yield may be determined long before it is obtained .
The Boiling-curve per Unit Area.\#151 ; By taking the number of plants per square metre , or any other unit area , as the basis of computation , instead of taking the individual plant , we obtain curves showing the time distribution of yield .
On changing the scale in this way , certain peculiarities become obvious which were not very noticeable in the curves per plant ( fig. 6 ) .
Since all the spacings begin with equal rates of flowering , and since there is equal shedding in all , it results that the greatest yield per area for the first few weeks is given by the spacing which contained most plants per area .
This would be described conventionally by stating that close planting hastened maturity ; actually it does not affect maturity in the least , as a plant function , but simply gives more early bolls because there are more plants to produce them.* The next differentiation between the spacings appears as each curve reaches its maximum and becomes horizontal in the way discussed when dealing with the flowering-curve .
The closer the spacing the sooner the maximum is reached , so that the period of maximum yielding is earliest in the closest spacings and latest in the widest .
The effects of the water table having been most severe in the closest sowings , the curve of yield per unit area falls more rapidly in Spacing 1 than in Spacing 2 , and this again more rapidly than in Spacing 3 .
The result is that the total " area " of the yield-curve of 2 bis greater than that for any other spacing , since although it does not begin so well as lb , it finishes better .
This Spacing 2b is the conventional arrangement practised by the Fellaheen of the district in which the experiment was performed .
Provided that the contents of the bolls in 2b are equal in weight , ginning outturn , and quality with those from the other spacings , the custom of the Fellah is remarkably justified .
His convention balances the chances of loss from various causes with great exactitude .
It remains to examine the contents of the bolls in order to see whether boll counting gives a true expression of the yield .
The Weight of the Boll Contents , or Boll Weight .
The data for these determinations are not given plot by plot , but the means for each spacing are presented in Table XLI of Appendix I. Determinations were made by weighing the seed cotton picked from 100 open bolls each week , or if less than a hundred were available from any plot , then of all those available .
The weight of the seed cotton in the boll is the aggregate expression of a number of different features , which features may be determined at various times beforehand .
The boll grows to its full dimensions in about 25 days from flowering , and in the remaining half of the period of maturation it undergoes various secondary processes .
The number of seeds in each boll has been computed and shows no features of interest .
It will be seen from the table that there are no marked effects to be recorded from * There may he a real effect on maturity through close planting , in that the water-shortage which is likely to ensue from unskilful cultivation , brings about autotoxic effects in the tissues of the boll , so shortening the periods of growth .
The effect from very severe water-shortage was found by the senior author in other experiments to alter a certain period from 23 to 21 days .
Thus the boll itself , normally requiring about 50 days to open , would open five days sooner .
Such acceleration of maturity is highly undesirable , as it implies incomplete or insufficient growth , with consequent short or weak lint .
ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
various spacings , except that bolls opening after September 19 in the closest sowings would appear to have been reduced in weight by the action of the water table .
Thus , in this experiment , boll weight proves to be an unimportant component of the yield .
Since an .
increase in boll weight would be directly projected as an increased yield , it may be advisable to comment briefly on its nature .
No variety of Egyptian cotton at Giza has yet produced more than about 2 grm. of seed cotton per boll under any treatment or in any season .
On the other hand , boll weight was determined , at our instance , in an experiment by the Egyptian Survey Department in the Middle Delta , where the weather is cooler , and it was found that the boll weight there rose higher in soil with a deep water table ; from 2 grm. with shallow soil it rose nearly to 3 grm. in deep soil resembling our land at Giza.# It would seem from this and from other considerations that the afternoon water strain acts as the limiting factor on the growth of the boll also .
With deep soil in the Middle Delta the boll becomes larger , while with deep soil at Giza it does not .
Severe root asphyxiation is needed at Giza to exceed the limiting effect of this daily water strain .
Investigations into the development of the boll and its contents were carried on concurrently with these analyses , and showed that fluctuations in the length and breaking strain of the lint which the boll contains were almost exclusively limited by the soil water available , or in other words , by the diurnal water strain .
It should be noted that as we progress through these successive stages the probable error of the determination of yield is steadily increasing .
Fluctuations in boll weight are now added to fluctuations in shedding .
Seed Weight .
The data set out in Table XLII were obtained by counting the number of seeds weighing 10 grm. from each plot each week .
They are plotted for the a series in fig. 10 .
Seed weight is less compound in origin than boll weight , and hence the curves are more definite .
Indications of specific influences are provided by the sudden and simultaneous variations from week to week , but there are no very definite effects from various spacings .
One of us is discussing this matter elsewdiere .
The curve for Spacing in fig. 10 is noticeably separate from the other spacings .
This is due to impurity of the commercial variety , there having been an excessive number of large-seeded plants in the observation rows of this spacing .
The variety employed in this experiment was Assili , introduced in 1910 , as a purified form of the deteriorated Afifi variety , by a commercial firm .
Our analysis of its composition in 1911 , from plant to plant , had led us to conclude that it was extremely impure from the beginning , but since our methods were new and the weight of opinion against us , we employed this variety in the spacing experiment while * * Ferrar , H. T. , and Hurst , H. E. , Survey Department Paper , No. 24 , p. 34 ; W. L. B. , The Development of Raw Cotton '(in course of publication ) .

W. L. BALLS AND F. S. HOLTON waiting for the results of a second , year 's analysis .
It may he added that our subsequent analyses of its composition amply confirmed the first one ; the only other variety which is equally impure with Assili is the Afifi which it was designed to replace ( see the Report of the International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners ' Egyptian Congress , 1913 , pp. 199 and 200 , etc. ) .
Lint Weight .
The weight of the lint per single seed is determined by computation from the ginning out-turn ( Table XLIII ) , and is presented in Table XLIY of Appendix II .
It shows no features due to spacing .
It might here be added that the appearance of lint produced on wide-sown plants is distinctly inferior .
It tends to be less regular than the normal field-sown lint , and is woolly and " staring/ ' though the breaking-strain is normal.* This makes the estimation of the value of new cottons for fine spinning extremely difficult , since they must be grown wide sown for pedigree culture and for propagation ; whereas their commercial value can only be tested by their behaviour in field crop over several acres , with ordinary commercial handling , ginning , and baling .
Summary and Conclusions .
We may conveniently summarise the effect of the various spacings upon the final yield by working backwards from the yield through the various stages of analysis .
We have seen that the weight of lint per boll is not appreciably affected by any alteration of spacing , so that the final yield is expressed with fair accuracy by a simple count of the number of bolls ripening ( fig. 11 , and Tables XLY and XLYI ) .
The number of bolls ripening is primarily determined by the number of flowers which open , subject to alteration by shedding to a degree which should be effectively constant in good cultivation .
The automatic balance which the plant maintains between water intake and water loss prevents spacing from affecting shedding .
The flowering is dependent on the development of flowering branches , either directly on the main stem , or on lateral monopodia as well .
Hence , it is dependent on the growth of the plant some three weeks previously to the actual opening of the flower , with a correction for bud-shedding .
The effect of varying the spacing of the plants is to vary the development of the branches , but this effect does not appear to be due to aerial interference , but rather to subterranean competition between adjacent root systems .
The yield may thus be discussed primarily on the flowering data , being regarded as the product of the number of plants per area multiplied by the yield per plant .
The chief effects of the various spacings employed are distinguishable as resulting from the number of plants in each " hole , " whether one or two , from the area of soil allowed per plant , and from the arrangement of the plants .
* * Breaking-strains of 50 single hairs were determined for each spacing .
ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
We have seen that the Fellah 's custom of leaving two plants standing together is a good one ; the habit is not a mere insurance against possible damage to one plant , but in all circumstances ( fig. 7 ) it gives about 10 per cent , higher yield , since each one of the pair produces a little more than half the crop which a single plant would give , and not one-half exactly .
The area allotted to each plant affects the date at which flowering ceases to increase , and also influences the severity of the effects of root asphyxiation by the water table .
The widest spacing employed in this experiment allowed 275 metres of superficies per plant , and this gave a higher yield per plant than the spacing of 2-00 metres , confirming previous evidence as to the enormous extent of the root system .
The maximum yield per area , however , is obtained with the conventional close spacing used by the native cultivators ( see fig. 4 ) .
As regards the effect of arrangement there would appear to be possible improvements in the native custom of planting in parallel ridges , by using a symmetrical space distribution of the plants over the surface of the ground , but practical difficulties in irrigation and cultivation would make such spacing very difficult to handle .
If we compare those groups of arrangements in this experiment which gave the same density per unit area , the most symmetrical arrangement of each group always gives the most ample flowering-curve per plant .
Three such comparisons are presented graphically in fig. 9 , as flowering-curves , a plan of the spatial arrangements being appended to the curves .
The first noticeable feature in this figure is the way in which all the curves coincide during their fall under the influence of the water table , the most powerful limiting factor in the plant 's life-history .
Spacing la is an apparent exception to this , but only on account of its severe bud-shedding .
With regard to the marked superiority of , e.g. , 3 a over 6a , the explanation can only be a geometrical one ; root interference begins in 6a along the line of the ridge , and further extension of the effective root system can only take place , therefore , at right angles to the ridge .
In 3a there is no root interference until it takes place in all directions at once .
It is not possible to elucidate the details with exactitude on account of the slight deformation of the flowering-curves from their normal rise along a straight line , already mentioned on p. 120 .
Conclusion .
A full investigation of the effect of different spacings in the planting of cotton has been carried out .
For each of 20 different spacings the number of flowers , number of bolls or fruits , mean weight of the boll contents , of the seed , and of the lint cotton per seed , have been recorded , and it is shown to what extent each of these components enters into the building up of the total yield .
The statistics of these stages of analysis are recorded in the Tables I-XLIII and XLIY-LI of the two Appendices .
These numbers serve to check one another , and VOL. CCVI.--B .
S we thus possess for the first time a body of data , of determined probable error , upon which trustworthy conclusions can be established , free from subjective bias .
When such data are entered up day by day and plotted graphically , it is possible to present the whole course of the building up of the yield in the form of plant-development curves , by which it is clear in what direction the phenomena are simple and in what direction complex .
The following conclusions may be formulated :\#151 ; a. The experiment shows that the yield of a cotton crop is primarily dependent on the number of flowers which it forms .
b. The normal extension of the root system of an isolated cotton plant can utilise more than 2 square metres of soil surface in soil which is more than 2 metres deep .
c. The plants in the field crop have only 0T8 square metre each allowed them , or less .
Most of the phenomena of field crop physiology in the fruiting season are traceable to the consequent interference of one root system with another .
d. The yield per unit area of the conventional spacing of the Egyptian Fellah is the maximum obtainable under the limitations of field cultivation .
e. The sources of error in field experiments with cotton can be traced to\#151 ; 1 .
Soil variation , especially below 1 metre depth .
2 .
Insufficient frequency of observation , whereby accidental episodes cannot be distinguished from normal sequences .
3 .
Fluctuation of single plants , heterogeneity of commercial varieties , and normal physiological variations from day to day .
Technical Bearings o the Spacing Experiment .
A few points of special interest may be mentioned which do not concern our primary purpose of yield analysis .
The use of boiling-curves shows that the conventional " pickings " are purely arbitrary and misleading now that the Nile is under control .
It would be useful to repeat this experiment with about ten spacings interpolated between our lb and 3 b , to determine the detailed form of the curve of total yield at its mode , and to do so in several sites .
Close planting offers a way for avoiding those insect pests which attack the late bolls .
It is more effective than breeding quickly-maturing varieties , unless such varieties are early as well as quick .
On the other hand , the closer cotton is planted the more skilful must cultivation be , and the more damage will result from hot weather , water-shortage , or water-logging .
This damage not only stops the flowering , but also reduces the length and strength of the lint in bolls already formed .
The only improvement which can be suggested on the Fellah 's conventional spacing is that the pairs of plants should be symmetrically distributed over the area .
To do this , while keeping the same density as at present , would necessitate the use of ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD .
very narrow ridges ( 57 cm .
on good land , and less on poor land ) , and access among the plants would be practically impossible .
It should be noted that our Spacing 6a is similar to the spacing employed in the United States of America .
It would be interesting to know whether this arrangement has any merits of its own in the cultivation of Upland cotton , or whether\#151 ; as seems more probable\#151 ; its employment is solely due to the compulsory use of horse-hoes instead of expensive hand-labour .
If the latter , cotton may be described not merely as a " cheap-labour crop , " but also as a " hand-labour crop .
" The yield of seed per plant can be enormously increased by wide sowing .
In the year following this experiment we obtained 1400 seeds per plant on 13,000 plants , including many stunted and late-sown individuals .
We thus raised 2 tons of seed in 1913 from two seeds sown in 1911 .
Five times this quantity is easily practicable .
The errors in comparison of nominally identical plots of cotton are very serious .
In future computation of the significance of ordinary plot-experiment results , the probable error of a total yield from any ordinary plot should be assessed at not less than U 7 per cent. , # even when conducted under the most favourable conditions .
When daily or weekly series of observations on flowering and boiling are taken weekly from observed groups of plants in each plot by the senior author 's methods , there is practically no fear of error in the comparison , since accidents and abnormalities are shown up at once by the run of the curves .
The various sources of error detected by the employment of these continuous records explain why previous published statements as to the best spacing for Egyptian cotton are contradictory , and often misleading .
Several side issues of the spacing experiment serve to illustrate the very great subjective error of opinions on the cotton crop .
Our wide-sown plants were considered to be late in flowering , closer planting would have given better results per plant , etc. ; the obvious reason for these mistakes is that the abundant leafage of the lateral monopodial branches helps to hide the flowers and bolls from direct view .
Similarly , it is very difficult to believe , in the light of these results , that a checking of growth can be beneficial under any circumstances ; nor is it easier to accept the converse , that a renewal of growth is necessarily prejudicial .
Benefit or harm may well result in either case through secondary causes , unless an intelligent control * In expansion of this evaluation we may cite the actual deviations of one set of plots from Table XXIY , Appendix I. The observation rows of representing the normal Egyptian field crop , were composed of selected individuals , chosen to eliminate any stunted plants , and the number of plants observed was high .
The yields work out as follows , in bolls per square metre , the mean being 17 * 37 bolls:\#151 ; Yield ... ... ... 19-98 12-25 18-48 20-58 15-68 Deviation ... ... 2-51 -5*12 1*11 3*21 -D69 Or ... ... . .
+14 per cent. - 29 per cent. + 6 per cent. +18 per cent. - 10 per cent. A deviation of 29 per cent , necessitates a probable error of 9 per cent , to account for it on accidental grounds .
s 2 is exerted .
Thus , an unwise watering after partial drought is said to cause the bolls which were near opening to fall off ; as a matter of fact , the shedding of a boll which is more than 25 days old is a relatively rare occurrence ; what actually happens is that the new leafy shoots hide the bolls already formed .
Similarly , the use of manures is said to make the plant " run to wood " and lessen the yield ; it is probable that the greater part of such decrease in yield is simply due to shedding , resulting from insufficient water-supply to cope with those demands which the increased leaf surface would make upon the root system on hot days .
APPENDIX I. Statistical Tables of the Data directly recorded during Cultivation of the Crop .
Tables I-XX.\#151 ; Daily Flowering Records of the Tiventy different t hese records were obtained by counting the number of flowers opening each day on a group of plants chosen for observation in each plot .
The daily numbers are not given in this account , but only the totals for seven days ending on the dates given in the Tables .
The totals for the five plots of one kind in each week are then divided by a factor , to obtain the average rate of flowering " per plant per day " during the seven-day period .
This factor is the number of plants in each observed group ( or " observation row ) multiplied by the number of days on which observations were taken .
Up to August 16 observations were made each day of the week ; after that date they were made on three days only ( see p. 118 ) .
The factor is thus three-sevenths of the factor for the early part .
flowers " per square metre per day , " representing the yield of the land in terms of flowers , are obtained by multiplying flowers " p.p.p.d. " by the number of plants in a square metre .
lotal production per plant and per square metre are both determined by addition of the weekly velocities per day and multiplying the total by seven .
Computed figures are in leaded type ; observed figures are in ordinary type .

Tables XXI-XL.\#151 ; Weekly Bolling Records for the different Spacings .
These records were obtained by counting the number of ripe bolls ( or open capsules ) on the same group of plants in each plot as for the flowering records .
Counts were made once a week , and therefore comprise the total number of bolls ripening during the week .
The totals in each week for five plots of one kind are then divided by seven times the number of plants included in the five groups .
This gives the average rate of " boiling per plant per day " during the week ending on the given date .
The " boiling per square metre per day " is obtained by multiplying the " p.p.p.d. " figures by the number of plants in a square metre .
Total yield , expressed as the number of ripe bolls , is obtained by addition of the weekly rates per day and multiplying by seven .
Computed figures as above are in leaded type ; observed figures in ordinary type .
Italics.\#151 ; These are employed for a separate computation , in which each plot is given equal weight , independently of the number of plants in its " Observation Rows , " and is computed separately .
The mean boiling " p.p.p.d. " thus obtained is only slightly different from the other figures .
Reproduced graphically in figs. 5 and 6 .
Extracts also in fig. 3 .

Tables XLI-XLIII.\#151 ; Boll-weight , S , and Out-turn Records .
Determinations of these data were made separately each week on each plot , making 3300 separate determinations in all , averaging about three minutes each with three plant observers at work . .
The results are chiefly negative , and therefore the figures for individual plots are not given ( as they were for flowering and boiling ) , hut only the means for each set of five .
Since series 2b represents the ordinary field crop of Egypt , the separate plot data for this series are appended as an example .
The three curves for spacing 2b only are plotted in fig. 1 .
The seed-weight curves for all spacing of one plant per hole are plotted in fig. 10 .
Table XLI.\#151 ; Boll-iveight Records.\#151 ; Actually the mean weight of the contents of the ripe boll , i.e. the seed cotton picked from the open capsule .
The first 100 bolls picked each week ( or less if not 100 were ripe , as shown in boiling records ) were weighed and the mean weight for the week ending on each date entered in grammes .
The bolls of the last two or three weeks are subject to accidental diminution of weight through the attacks of Eariasinsulana larvae .
The damage done was not serious till the last week .
Determinations based on less than 200 bolls total for the series are marked with a note of interrogation .
Table XLII.\#151 ; Seed-tveight Records.\#151 ; Actually the mean weight of a single seed in grammes .
After the seed of a weekly picking from each plot had been thoroughly mixed in the process of " ginning , " 10 grm. were weighed out to the nearest whole seed and subsequently counted .
The mean weight of one seed thus obtained is entered on the date of picking , i.e. the date ending the week in which they were determined .
Since the only source of appreciable error lies in the sampling , the same notes of interrogation are applied as in the boll weight .
Table XLIII.\#151 ; Ginning Out-turn Records.\#151 ; The process of " ginning " consists of feeding the seed cotton ( produced in the capsule ) into a machine called a " gin , " whereby the lint is stripped from the seed .
In commerce the ratio of lint to seed is expressed indirectly by the weight of lint obtained in the gin from a standard weight of seed cotton .
We have used 100 as the standard , instead of the local Egyptian unit , so that the figures given in the records are percentages of lint from seed cotton .
Computation from this and from the previous record gives the most expeditious and most accurate method of determining the mean lint weight per seed ( Table XLIV ) .
All determinations were made on samples of 50 grm. of seed cotton .
Notes of interrogation and dating to end of week as in the previous records .

Computed Statistics of Yield Ratios .
Table XLIV.\#151 ; Lint-weight Records ( indirect).\#151 ; The figures represent in grammes the mean weight of the lint ( or hairs of cotton ) borne on a single seed in each of the weekly pickings .
This weight is computed from Tables XLII and XLIII:\#151 ; T . . .
i , Seed weight X ginning out-turn Lint weight = ---\#151 ; \#151 ; -a\#151 ; r\#151 ; 9---------------- .
' 100 \#151 ; ginning out-turn The same notes of interrogation are applied as in Tables XLI , XLII , and XLIII .
Tables XLY and XLVI.\#151 ; Distribution of Total Yield ( indirect records).\#151 ; The total yield per unit area , as given in Tables XXI-XL and XLYII , is taken as 100 in each series treated , and subdivided into the weekly percentages .
Thus is shown up the geometrical alteration in the form of the yield-curve with various spacings , and the superposition of the boiling- and lint-curves gives a quick demonstration of the validity of determining yield by boll-counting , instead of picking , ginning , and weighing .
The computation is restricted to the b series , with two plants per hole , since these represent the ordinary field crop custom .
Spacings 6b and 7b are omitted in these records , as also in Tables XLYII , L , and LI , so as to leave only the steady progression of spacing from dense to wide .
A portion of these computed records is plotted in fig. 11 .
Table XLYII.\#151 ; Yield of Lint Cotton ( indirect records).\#151 ; Computed from the number of bolls , multiplied by the boll weight and by the ginning out-turn , divided by 100 .
This table represents the final yield of the crop .
The commercial value of the seed also obtained is much less than that of the lint .
Totals plotted in fig. 4 .
Tables XLYIII\#151 ; LI.-\#151 ; Confuted Yields for the Three Conventional Pickings.\#151 ; In ordinary agricultural practice the cotton crop is harvested in three separate pickings only .
The data in these Tables XLYIII-LI are obtained by summation of the original analytical data of the previous tables , for comparison on the part of agriculturists , and as a final demonstration of the composite nature of yield .
The dates selected by us for pickings are those conveniently employed for ordinary farm practice in the district where the experiment was performed , viz. , September 10 , October 1 , and November 5 .
The yield of bolls per square metre is given for all series , while only the " one plant per hole , " or Series la-10a , are given for the rest .
Table L is the table of primary interest for purposes of seed-propagation , just as Table XLYII was of primary interest to the farmer seeking a large crop .

The ordinates erected at weekly intervals to represent the various values have been joined by lines to form the various curves .
The flowering-curve and boiling-curve show the changes from week .to week in the rates at which flowers and bolls ( fruits ) are being opened on an average plant .
The approximate shedding-curve shows those flowers which were shed in each week , and is obtained here by subtraction of boiling from the flowering of 50 days previously .
On the boiling-curve are indicated approximately the areas of this curve which would be gathered into the three conventional pickings , while the inset diagram above the boiling-curve shows the characteristics of the seed-cotton gathered in each of our weekly pickings .
