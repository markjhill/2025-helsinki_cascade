" Sequel to an Essay on the Constitution of the Atmosphere published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826 ; with some account of the Sulphurets of Lime ; " by John Dalton , D.C.L. , F.R.S. The author communicates in this paper an account of the inves ?
tigations on the constitution of the atmosphere , which have engaged his attention during a long period of years .
He enters into an ex ?
amination of the comparative advantages of the three methods which are most in use for analysing common air , namely , firing it with hy ?
drogen in Volta 's eudiometer , or abstracting the oxygen by means of nitrous gas and quadrisulphuret of lime ; and details the pre ?
cautions to be taken in the employment of each of these methods , and the degree of accuracy to be expected from the results under different circumstances .
He then relates numerous experiments made on air obtained from great heights , from which he is led to the conclusion that the proportion of oxygen to azote in the atmosphere on the surface of the earth is not precisely the same at all places and times ; and that in elevated regions this proportion is somewhat less than at the surface of the earth , but not nearly so much as the theory of mixed gases would require , and that the reason for this is to be found in the incessant agitation of the atmosphere produced by winds and other causes .
