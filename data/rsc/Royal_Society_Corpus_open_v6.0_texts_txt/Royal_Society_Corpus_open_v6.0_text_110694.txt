" Second Letter on the Electrolysis of Secondary Compounds , addressed to Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. " By J. Frederic Daniell , Esq. , For .
Sec. R.S. , Professor of Chemistry in King 's College , London .
The author , in this letter , prosecutes the inquiry he had com ?
menced in the former one , into the mode in which the chemical elements group themselves together to constitute radicles , or proximate principles .
He considers his experiments as establishing the principle that , considered as electrolytes , the inorganic oxy-acid salts must be regarded as compounds of metals , or of that extraor ?
dinary compound of nitrogen and four equivalents of hydrogen to which Berzelius has given the name of ammonium , and compound anions , chlorine , iodine , &amp; c , of the Haloide salts ; and as showing that this evidence goes far to establish experimentally the hypothe ?
sis originally brought forward by Davy , of the general analogy in the constitution of all salts , whether derived from cxy-acids or hydro-acids .
Some remarks are made on the subject of nomenclature , and the rest of the paper is occupied with the details of the experiments , all bearing on the important subject which he has under ?
taken to investigate .
