) It is almost certain that the helium in radio-active minerals is mechanically retained rather than chemically combined .
The question then arises , what is the size of the structure which retains each helium atom ?
Is this structure of molecular dimensions , or is it much coarser ?
The present investigation was undertaken in the hope of obtaining some information on this point .
Moss* has found that traces of helium can be liberated from pitchblende by grinding , and it seemed likely that , by pushing the process much further , a large percentage , if not the whole , of the helium present might be liberated .
If so , it would be legitimate to conclude that the structure in which the helium atoms were entangled was of the same order of magnitude as the particles of powder .
The experiments were carried out on thorianite from Ceylon , which has the advantage of containing a very large amount of helium .
To determine how much helium had been liberated by grinding , the amount of helium per gramme was found for coarse mineral , i.e. mineral containing the normal amount , ,and also for the ground mineral , the difference giving the amount of helium liberated .
To estimate the amount of helium per gramme of a certain specimen of mineral , a weighed quantity was placed in a small glass tube A ( fig. 1 ) , with a glass rod joined to the closed end .
This was placed in a large tube BC , in the bottom of which was some nitric acid .
The glass rod was long enough to prevent the acid touching the mineral .
A piece of glass tubing DE , \#163 ; inch bore , was joined to this larger tube and constricted at one part so that the tube could be easily sealed .
The tube was then placed in connection with a Topler pump by means of stout rubber tubing , which was fixed to the glass by copper wire to prevent air leaking into the pump .
The tube was evacuated and sealed off .
Mineral and acid were well shaken together and the tube placed in a heating bath .
Here the acid attacked the mineral and the contained helium was liberated .
The heating bath consisted of one box of asbestos , S inch thick , inside Fig. 1 .

In the inner box were two electric lamps , by means of which a temperature of 100 ' C. could be maintained .
At this temperature two and a-half hours were sufficient to complete the action .
A small insoluble residue was left , and during the first experiments the tubes were placed in the bath again to see if the residue contained any helium , but with negative results .
After the mineral had been digested , a nick was made with a file at the top of the tube , which was again placed in connection with the pump .
The air was drawn off from the pump and rubber tubing , and the glass tube was then broken at the nick , under the rubber .
The gases contained in the tube were drawn off and collected .
On their way through the pump they passed through a drying tube containing small pieces of potash , which also acted on any acid gases coming over .
The collected gases were mixed with oxygen and sparked in a eudiometer containing a little solid potash .
The mixture was sparked continuously until all contraction had long ceased .
The remaining oxygen was burnt off by means of phosphorus , and the helium which remained measured in a tube divided to tenths of a cubic centimetre .
The measured volumes were corrected for temperature and pressure .
In the mineral itself , helium is practically the only rare gas .
The only impurity of any consequence would be argon coming from air which might get into the collected gases , ' in the first place by not drawing off all the air the first time the tube was in connection with the pump , and again by air leaking into the pump when the helium and other gases are being collected .
In one experiment , 3'5 c.c. of gas wer\amp ; obtained at atmospheric temperature and pressure .
After sparking , this was reduced to 2'9 c.c. Thus there could be little gas other than helium given off from the mineral , and with care very little air could get in .
If an appreciable amount did get in , a correction could be made .
The gas remaining after the oxygen had been burnt off was usually mixed with oxygen again , and sparked to ensure that the sparking action had been complete .
To obtain the mineral in a finely divided state , the thorianite , which was in the form of small crystals , was first pounded in an iron mortar and the finer pounded mineral passed through a sieve of 0*3 mm. mesh .
This finer mineral was well ground in small portions in an agate mortar and placed in * a porcelain basin , ' where water was gently poured on it .
The basin was shaken and the water made to rotate .
The fine mineral that rose in the water was poured with the water into another basin , where it was allowed to settle , after which the water was poured off and the mineral dried over the heating bath , where the temperature was about 35 ' C. By this means , mineral ranging in size from 1 / / .
( or OOOl mm. ) to 9 / / .
was obtained .

] ments on this and the mineral that would not pass through the sieve showed that 11 per cent , of the helium had been liberated , the normal amount of helium being 8*9 c.c. per gramme , that in the fine material being 7*9 c.c. per gramme at 0 ' C. and 760 mm. pressure .
To get the division finer , a second washing was made from the mineral containing 7*9 c.c. of helium per gramme , but a reduction of only 5 per cent , was effected .
This process could have been carried further , but was too uncertain and clumsy , and was discarded for the following method .
Forty or fifty grammes of the thorianite were ground in small portions in the agate mortar .
This ground mineral was placed in a bottle and mixed with water .
The water and mineral were well shaken together and the mineral allowed to settle .
When it had been settling a definite time , 4 or 5 cm .
of the top layers of the water were syphoned off with the aid of a water pump .
Care was taken not to take off the mineral which floated on the surface of the water and was probably greasy .
The water syphoned off was transferred to a basin , where the suspended mineral was allowed to settle , the water then being poured off .
When enough mineral had been collected , it was dried and experimented on .
In this way mineral was obtained in which a further liberation of helium had been effected .
In the different experiments , the time of suspension varied from 25 minutes to 1 hour .
A microscopic examination was made of different samples of mineral , and by means of a camera lucida , drawings were made of magnified images of the particles under the object-glass .
By drawing the image of 1/ 100th mm. scale , the size of the particles could be estimated .
All the above-mentioned experiments and some confirmatory ones are collected in the following table ( see p. 304 ) .
From this table we can see that helium is liberated by grinding , and that the finer the mineral is ground the more helium is liberated .
However , experiments 12 to 16 show that there is a temporary limit to this liberation .
Special care was taken with experiments 14 and 16 to get accurate results .
The other experiments are on rather too small quantities to be very dependable , but they serve to confirm experiments 14 to 16 .
A comparison of the experiments will be aided by the following diagrams , which are reproductions of those taken by the camera lucida referred to above .
They are for specimens of mineral containing respectively 7*9 c.c. per gramme ( fig- 2 ) , 6*6 c.c. per gramme ( 25 minutes in suspension ) ( fig. 3 ) , 6*4 c.c. per gramme ( one hour in suspension ) ( fig. 4 ) .
Comparing fig. 2 and fig. 3 , the reason why the mineral represented by fig. 2 contains more helium is probably because the larger particles of diameter 6 to.9/ ^ have lost very little helium .
This would explain results Table showing the Liberation of Helium by Grinding .

It is of quite a different order of magnitude and occurs as soon as the mineral is ground .

6 to 11 , but when we come to compare figs. 3 and 4 , we see that , although fig. 4 represents much the finer mineral , as is obvious also from the times of suspension , there is very little difference in the helium content .
We could change from fig. 3 to fig. 4 by replacing the larger particles by particles of diameter 1 and 2 fx .
In other words , mineral , the particles of which were 3 and 4 / xin diameter , would not contain any more helium than particles 1 and 2 / xin diameter .
It seems , therefore , that as we come to particles , the diameter of which is in the neighbourhood of 3 / x , there is a temporary limit to the liberation of helium , and that 70 per cent , of the helium is contained very firmly in the mineral .
The smallest of the ground particles is a little less than 1 fxin diameter , and it is impossible to say how much finer one would have to obtain the mineral for much of the remaining helium to be liberated .
Experiment 5 shows that , when the size of the particles is greater than 0*01 mm. , scarcely any helium is liberated .
It is hard to say at what size the liberation of helium begins , but it is probably in the neighbourhood of 5 [ x. In any case it is clear that part at least of the helium in thorianite is retained in a structure which is very large compared with the molecular structure .
The experiments on which this conclusion is based may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; 1 .
Helium is liberated from thorianite , and a liberation of 28 per cent , has been effected .
2 .
The smaller the mineral is ground the more helium is liberated .
3 .
This liberation has a temporary limit when the mineral is reduced to a size of about 3 / x. 4 .
It is impossible to say how the remaining 72 per cent , of helium is contained in the mineral and to how much finer than 1 fx the mineral would have to be reduced to liberate this helium .
In conclusion , I wish to record my thanks to Prof. Strutt , who suggested this research , for his great kindness and help throughout the work .
