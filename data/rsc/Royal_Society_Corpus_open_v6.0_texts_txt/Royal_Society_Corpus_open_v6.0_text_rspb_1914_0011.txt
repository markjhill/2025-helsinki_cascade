269 On a Method of Studying Transpiration .
By Sir Francis Darwin , F.R.S. ( Received October 22 , \#151 ; Read December 4 , 1913 .
) Transpiration is , perhaps , more directly under the rule of external physical conditions than any other physiological function .
Yet proofs of this conclusion are wanting , at any rate in regard to the transpiration of leaves .
Thus , as far as I know , we have no complete experimental determination of the relation between the loss of water-vapour from leaves and the relative humidity of the air .
Nor again have we any complete evidence as to the effect on transpiration of variation in the illumination to which the leaf is subjected .
These lacunae in our knowledge depend on the fact that in leaves , transpiration is largely dependent on the behaviour of the stomata , being relatively large when they are wide open , and diminishing as they close .
And since the aperture of the stomata depends on external condition , it is clear that no distinction can be made between the diminution in evaporation resulting from increased relative humidity of the air , and the diminution in the transpiration-rate due to stomatal closure .
In fact it is impossible to learn anything accurately concerning transpiration until the varying aperture of the stoma is excluded from the problem .
This might possibly be done by estimating the transpiration of leaves of aquatic plants in which the stomata vary but slightly in aperture ; but the experiment would not be easily made in a trustworthy form .
The method I have actually employed is to block the stomata with a fatty substance , * and then to place the intercellular spaces of the leaves in communication with the external air by means of incisions .
Most of the experiments were made on laurel ( P. laurocerasus ) .
The lower surface of the leaf was smeared with melted cocoa-butter or with vaseline rubbed in with the finger , and four to six cuts were made with scissors or a razor , reaching from the periphery to the midrib between the large veins .
Other plans were also tried , e.g. pricking the leaf with a needle or making numerous small incisions by stabbing with a scalpel.f The method is similar to that of Stahl , J who showed that greased leaves pierced with holes assimilate and form starch in the tissues surrounding * Cocoa butter in the earlier experiments , vaseline in all the later ones .
+ The method was described in a paper read at Section K of the Sheffield meeting of the British Association , 1910 ( title alone published ) .

the wounds , whereas greased leaves without such artificial stomata formed none or hardly any .
It may be objected that the stomata are not completely or uniformly .closed by greasing , that some remain open , and that it is to the opening and closing of these in light and darkness that the rise and fall of the transpiration of the incised leaves is due .
I find it difficult to believe that the general objection here discussed is sound , because experiments with the porometer* have convinced me that even a careless application of vaseline absolutely closes the stomata .
It may be urged that in Experiment LO 2 \lt ; ( p. 271 ) the effect of grease is only to reduce transpiration from 379 to 109 , i.e.y from 100 to 2*88 .
It must be remembered , however , that fatty substances are not impermeable to water , and that at any rate part of the ; 2-88 per cent , must be due to cuticular transpiration .
Another source of error should be guarded against .
Mr. Blackmanf has shown that a process of healing occurs in wounded laurel leaves .
The beginning of the process is , however , marked by the edges of the wounds becoming translucent .
As soon as this occurs the specimen should be discarded or fresh incisions made .
The following experiment , LO 2 , October 2 , 1912 , gives an idea of the .effect of greasing and slitting .
It seems clear that the result is comparable ( as far as magnitude is concerned ) with normal stomatal transpiration :\#151 ; Experiment LO 2 .

Fitted to a potometer ( diameter of tube 0'95 mm. ) .
At a north window , where the temperature during the observations varied between 13*6 ' and 15*2 ' C. and the relative humidity between 59 and 69 per cent. In the following abbreviated record of the experiment the potometer readings .are corrected for differences in relative humidity .

11.5 234 It will be seen that the coating of vaseline on the leaves and surface of the branch does not completely check transpiration .
Thus , as above mentioned , on the second day ( October 3 ) , when the original negative pressure must have disappeared , transpiration had only been reduced from 379 to 10*9 or from 100 to 2*88 .
This fact is in the present instance of little importance , as my object is to illustrate the effect of incisions on the transpiration rate .
It is obvious ( i ) that when the lamina is cut into strips the transpiration rises with great rapidity ; ( ii ) that although in this instance it does not obtain the rate of transpiration observed when the stomata were open , the two are comparable for practical purposes .
In the case of these slit leaves it is of some interest to know the amount of connection between the external air and the -intercellular spaces .
This was estimated from the observations on the laurel twig ( Experiment LO 2 ) just described .
Each leaf had eight incisions ( four per side ) , varying in 0'00708 c.c. The figure 439 is the reciprocal of 22*8 multiplied by 10,000 .
To convert the number 439 into cubic centimetre it is only necessary to multiply it by 2mm.3 which gives the rate , in this case 1T2 c.c. per hour per 600 cm.2 or 18'7 c.c. per square metre of stoma-bearing area .
VOL. LXXXVII.\#151 ; B. X Sir F. Darwin .
length from about 25 to 40 mm. The sum of the lengths of the incisions = 2437 mm. The thickness of the leaves was taken as 0*38 mm. , and since each incision exposes two leaf-sections to the air , the total area of section exposed by the experiment is 2 x 2437 mm. x 0*38 mm. = 1852 mm.2 = 18*52 cm.2 .
The stoma-bearing area of the 10 leaves , omitting the mid-ribs , was 600 cm.2 , so that the amount of surface exposed by incision is 18*52 per 600 or 3*09 per cent. Unger* gives for P. laurocerasus the intercellular spaces as 21*9 , say , 22 per cent.f of the volume of the leaf .
Therefore of the transverse section exposed by incision only 22 per cent , is intercellular space .
We may therefore say that in a laurel leaf having four incisions on each half of the lamina the transpiratory apertures connecting the intercellular spaces with outer air are 22 x 3*09/ 100 or 0*68 per cent , of the area of the leaf .
Since these correspond in function to stomata it is worth while comparing them with actual stomata .
A rough calculation gave the area of the laurel stomata as 0*88 per cent , of that of the leaf .
The transpiring area of the slit leaves is , therefore , much the same as that of the stomatal apertures under ordinary conditions .
The Effect of Changes in the Humidity of the Air .
The method of incision has been used in studying the effects , on transpiration , of variations in the relative humidity of the air ; and this has led to a rqugh plan for reducing transpirations at varying humidities to a common standard .
The method of producing a damp atmosphere was a simple one .
At first the plant was covered with a. large bell-jar resting on a ground-glass plate , and so arranged that a current of air , dry or moist , could be drawn through it .
But finally I came to the conclusion that a simpler method was preferable , namely , to change the relative humidity by raising or lowering the bell-jar ; in this way\#151 ; assuming that the laboratory air is fairly dry\#151 ; it is easy to change the relative humidity from 50 per cent , to 95 per cent. , which is sufficient for my purpose.^ The wet and dry * ' Sitzb .

t Microscopic examination of a transverse section led me to estimate the air spaces as roughly 25 per cent. J It is unfortunate that these observations , with the exception of Experiment 8 , were not made in darkness or in constant light .
The experiments which are most likely to be vitiated by this fault are Nos. 3 , 4 , and 7 .
Experiment 4 might be expected to give an especially bad result from the effect of dull light at the end of the experiment .
But the diagram , fig. 4 , shows rather striking uniformity in the relation between transpiration and humidity of air .
In Experiment 3 the diagram is not very satisfactory in any case , but omission of the last two readings ( the ones under suspicion ) would not alter the On a Method of Studying Transpiration .
bulb thermometers were in the upper part of the jar , while the branch had leaves in both lower and upper regions .
I did not find this to be a serious source of error , and it is one which might be avoided by fitting an apparatus by which the air in the bell jar could be stirred and thoroughly mixed , as indeed was done in some of the later experiments .
The rate of transpiration was estimated by a potometen , not one of the type formerly used by me , * in which an air bubble is timed as it passes rapidly along a narrow capillary tube , but one in which the free end of the water-column is timed with a stop-watch as it passes along a horizontal tube of about a millimetre internal diameter.f It is , in fact , like Kohl 's potometer , or that figured in PfefFer 's * Physiology , ' though the method of bringing the column back to zero is not identical with either .
I have not thought it necessary to give the actual quantities of water absorbed by the plant per hour , but merely a series of numbers proportional to the rate of absorption .
In all experiments ( except No. 8 ) the plants were placed close to the north windows of the laboratory ; the action of the stomata was in all cases excluded by a coating of grease , transpiration taking place only by incisions , as above described .

In the figures the ordinates represent transpiration rates , while the relative humidity ( \fr ) is given on the horizontal axis .
Thus if transpiration varies directly as the relative humidity , the diagram should give a straight diagonal line .
The fact that the diagonal does not pass through the intersection of the axes will be discussed later .

humidity .
This conclusion , which is a physical necessity , does not seem to have been definitely proved or represented diagrainmatically .
In some cases ( e.g. figs. 2 and 6 ) the line of dots ( .
the transpiration curve ) is not straight\#151 ; the change in rate of transpiration lags behind the change in yfr\#151 ; for reasons not yet clear .
( 2 ) The second characteristic of the diagrams is that the diagonal does not pass through the point of intersection of the axes\#151 ; or , in other words , transpiration is not zero in saturated air .
I have not hitherto seen this graphically represented as the result of experiment , although it might have been foretold .
The fact that transpiration occurs in saturated air , and that it is due to the production of heat in plant-respiration was first made clear by Sachs* , who proposed that the fact should be utilised as a means of measuring the " Eigenwarme " of plants.f We shall see later that the diagram ( fig. 9 ) may perhaps be applied to the same end .

In the earlier experiments , I estimated AG = 7 , but I now consider 5 a more reasonable average .
The construction here given has been used throughout my work for the rough reduction of transpiration-rates to a common degree of relative humidity .
Thus , supposing that in fig. 9 the transpiration-rates DC and EB have been obtained under different conditions of illumination , it is clear that we cannot estimate the effect of such conditions until the amounts have been corrected for the differences in relative humidity .

We must multiply 75 by 35/ 25 .
The product 105 is the transpiration in the dark room ( humidity 80 per cent. ) reduced to humidity 70 per cent. , and therefore now comparable with transpiration in the light , i.e. 120 .
Thus Transpiration in light 120 114 Transpiration in dark 105 100 Sir Joseph Larmor has been good enough to point out to me that it is possible to get a rough idea of the temperature of the leaf at full saturation , i.e. of the leaf temperature which in fig. 9 produces the amount of transpiration ( or what may be perhaps called distillation ) equal to AF .
The oblique line , or curve of transpiration , cuts the horizontal at 105 , i.e. at 5 per cent , above saturation .
The figure shows that , in supersaturated air , i.e. 5 per cent , above saturation , transpiration is nil .
The hypothetical degree of supersaturation should be a measure of the transpiration AF at the saturation point , and therefore of the internal temperature which can distil off water in saturated air .
Assuming* the temperature of the air to he 16 ' C. , the vapour pressure would be 13'51 .
If we add 5 per cent , to this we get 14*2 , which is the vapour pressure corresponding to 16*8 ' , or 0*8 ' C. above the temperature of the air .
There seems no improbability in leaf-respiration producing , under the conditions of the experiment , a temperature of roughly 1 ' C. above that of the atmosphere .
In my earlier experiments I concluded that the transpiration curve DEFG cut the horizontal at 107 .
This would have given a temperature 1*1 ' C. above that of the air , instead of 0*8 ' C. It should be noted that the distance AF , i.e. the amount of transpiration in saturated air , will depend on the general temperature , since respiration is greatly influenced by temperature .
We have some evidence on this point , but the experiment needs careful repetition .
It is remarkable that , as far as I know , the method here used for plotting the relation between transpiration and relative humidity has not been employed .
If Le Clercf had treated his results in this way , he might , perhaps , have obtained a result like mine .
I cannot conclude without expressing my indebtedness to Miss D. F. Pertz for much kind help in the laboratory .
