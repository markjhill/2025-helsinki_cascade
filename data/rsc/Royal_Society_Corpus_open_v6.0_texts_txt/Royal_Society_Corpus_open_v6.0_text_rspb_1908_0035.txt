) This paper contains a further record of experiments which were begun at the same time as those recorded in my first paper.* The method of interpreting results in the present paper is the same as that used in the first one , and is based upon the same working hypothesis , i.e. , Bateson and Punnett 's " Presence and Absence " hypothesis and Cuenot 's theory of colour .
The cost of these experiments has been defrayed by a grant from the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society .
The Experimental Matings .
( 1 ) ( a ) Gr4 xCr4= x Albino .
Twenty pairs of albinoes were mated .
There was a total offspring of 174 individuals , all albinoes .
Some of these albinoes had a near albino ancestry , while others had a pigmented one .
The details of the ancestry may be seen upon reference to the Table of Ancestry , pp. 390\#151 ; 391 .
( b ) " Ghost " or Zygotic Patterns in Albinoes .
I have already , in the first paper , given an account of the " ghost " pattern as shown in the offspring of one mating ( experiment 74 ) .
I have now to describe a Second case .
In experiment 19a there was a total offspring of 15 , in two litters of six and nine individuals .
The first litter was at a much earlier date than the second , and I did not pay any particular attention to the appearance of the coat in the individuals of this litter .
By the time the second litter was born , I had discovered the existence of the " ghost " pattern in albinoes .
It is possible , therefore , that the first litter showed it , but since it is only a transitory matter of a few weeks , it will be unobserved unless looked for at the particular period at which it appears .
Of the nine albinoes born in the second litter , two died quite young , and the remaining seven all * " On Some Features in the Hereditary Transmission of the Self-black and the " Irish " Coat Character in Bats.\#151 ; Part I , " ' Roy .

389 showed the " ghost " of the self-pattern .
One of these " self-ghost " individuals was mated with a Cr 5 ( see experiment 37c)* and gave a coloured offspring , all of the self-pattern .
The young consisted of nineteen " Irish " individuals , obtained in three litters .
Since the self-pattern is dominant to the piebald , it is clear that the pigmented piebald parent ( Cr 5 ) could not have been carrying the self-pattern determiner .
The albino parent is therefore the only source through which it could have come .
And it should be noticed that one of its G-Ps .
( experiment 74 ) , and three of its G-G-Ps .
( experiments 71 and 66a ) had the self-pattern coat .
Now , on the basis of gametic purity and segregation , it is expected that one-half of the 15 offspring in experiment 19a of which the albino parent described above was one will carry the self-pattern determiner .
By an ocular demonstration , corroborated by a subsequent breeding test , the expectation is thus shown to be fulfilled .
( 2 ) 0 4x05 = Albino Piebald Black- White .
( a ) Heterozygous Piebald x Albino .
Experiments 29 , 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 36 , 37 and 37a .
The expectation in this cross is 1 Cr 4:1 Cr 5 .
The result is 44 Cr 4 4-55 Cr 5 .
The high proportion of the Cr 5 type is due to mating No. 30 ( p. 391 ) .
If this is eliminated , the figures are 32 Cr 4 + 33 Cr 5 .
The disturbance of the proportions is due to the last two litters of this mating .
They are:\#151 ; 1st litter = 3 Cr 4 + 4 Cr 5 2nd " =4 " +4 " 3rd " =2 , , +8 " 4th , , =3 " +6 , , In experiment 34 , one of the four albino offspring showed the piebald " ghost " pattern in its coat .
( b ) Homozygous Piebald x O 4 .
Experiment 32 .
The expectation is that all the offspring shall be Cr 5 .
The result is 14 Cr 5 .
( c ) Piebald x Cr4 of more Complex Constitution .
Experiments 35 , 37b , and 37c .
In these crosses the result will depend upon the nature of the albino parent .
If it be of cgBSsP constitution and the Cr 5 parent carries c recessive , .

On Hereditary [ Jan. 14 , the expectation is 2 Cr 4 +1 Cr 5 +1 Cr 6 The result ( experiment 35 ) is 8 Cr 4 + 3 Cr 5 + 2 Cr 6 6 .
If the albino parent be cgBSP and the Cr 5 parent is homozygous , the expectation is that the offspring shall be all of the " Irish " form .
The result ( experiment 37c ) is nineteen " Irish " b individuals .
If the albino* is cGgBSP and the piebald carries c recessive , the expectation is 2 Cr 4+1 Cr 2 + 1 Cr 6 \amp ; ; the result is 3 " +2 " +1 " ( experiment 37b .
) A sister of this albino parent ( experiment 37b ) was also mated with a black piebald ( experiment 34 ) .
No grey individuals appeared in her offspring of eight .
This , of course , is evidence that segregation of characters , i.e. blackness and greyness , occurred .
( 3 ) Gr5 x Cr 5 = Black Piebald x Black Piebald .

Experiments 25 , 27 , and 28a .
The heterozygous Cr 5 carries c. The expectation is 1 Cr 4 : 3 Cr 5 .
The actual result is 16 Cr 4+34 Cr 5 .

With this total of 120 the predicted proportions are 30:90 .
( b ) Heterozygous Piebald x Homozygous Piebald .
Experiments 26 and 28 .
The expectation in this case is that all the offspring will be piebald .
The result is 11 piebalds .
The further expectation is that some of the piebald offspring will be homozygous and some heterozygous .
Experiments 31 and 56S show respectively that the offspring of mating 26 was : one of them heterozygous and another homozygous .

] Transmission of certain Coat Characters Rats .
Summary .
These experiments show that albinoes breed true to albinism , whether their ancestry is pigmented or not .
They further show that , though externally albinoes may appear to be identical with regard to their coat characters , in reality they may be different .
This fact has been previously known for both animals and plants , but it has hitherto been elucidated by means of breeding tests alone .
These experiments add an ocular demonstration of the actual presence of the coat-pattern in albinoes .
The interpretation placed upon the coat appearances in these albinoes is corroborated by the breeding results .
It is further shown that when a piebald black rat ( Cr 5 ) is mated with a similar one , two classes of offspring may be obtained .
One of these contains all black piebalds and the other a mixture of black piebalds and albinoes in nearly equal numbers .
When a piebald black rat is mated with an albino ( = Cr .
5 x Cr 4 ) , it may be said that , so far as these experiments have gone , five different results will be obtained .
They may be stated as follows : ( 1 ) The offspring are all black piebalds .
( 2 ) They may be a mixture of black piebalds and albinoes .
( 3 ) They may be all " Irish " forms ( =a black self-coloured form ) .
( 4 ) They may be a mixture of albinoes , black piebalds , and " Irish .
" ( 5 ) They may contain albinoes , " Irish , " and a grey form ( =Cr 2 ) .
It can be shown that the divergency of the results obtained when two individuals apparently similar are mated is due to the gametic nature of the albino employed .
