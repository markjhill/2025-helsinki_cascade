[ Mar. 8 , ( 5 ) There is a close analogy between ozone and ammonia with regard to their synthesis and decomposition ; both are formed by sparking , and both are completely decomposed by heat .
In conclusion , I wish to express my thanks to Mr. G. A. S. Atkinson , B.Sc. , and to Mr. J. H. Davies , B.Sc. , for valuable assistance rendered during the earlier and later portions of the work respectively .
Determination of Vapour-pressure Air-bubbling .
By Edgar Philip Perman and John Hughes Davies .
( Communicated by Principal E. H. Griffiths , F.R.S. Received March 8 , \#151 ; Read March 30 , 1905 .
) It was shown recently by one of us* that the vapour-pressure of water can be determined with a considerable degree of accuracy by bubbling a current of air through water in a thermostat , and estimating the amount of water evaporated by absorbing it in strong sulphuric acid .
The accuracy of the method has since been questioned , f supersaturation being specially suggested as likely to cause error .
We have therefore made experiments in order to discover what error ( if any ) is introduced by supersaturating the air with moisture before it enters the water in the thermostat .
The effect of dust in the air and of electrification have also been investigated .
In each case the arrangement of the apparatus was as described in the previous paper .
Supersaturation.\#151 ; Before passing into the flasks in the thermostat , which was maintained at 70 ' , the air was bubbled through a large wash-bottle containing water at about 85 ' .
The wash-bottle was connected by a short rubber tube with the flasks at 70 ' .
Otherwise the experiment was conducted as already described .
The following results were obtained:\#151 ; w. P. T. y. P- V apour-pressure .

The supersaturation of the air with moisture caused , therefore , no appreciable effect , the air assuming the normal state of saturation on passing through the four flasks in the thermostat .
An explanation of the erratic results obtained by Carveth and Fowler* has already been offered by one of us.f Dust in the Air.\#151 ; A thick smoke was made by burning pieces of phosphorus near the inlet tube of the apparatus described in the former paper .
The smoke was maintained during the whole of the experiment .

jSTo doubt there was such an effect in the first flask , but the state of the air became normal before it left the last one .
The experiment was not repeated owing to its disagreeable character .
Electrification of the Air.\#151 ; 1 .
The air was made to pass through a large flask in which hydrogen was being rapidly evolved from zinc and dilute sulphuric acid ; the air was thus mixed with electrified hydrogen ; it was filtered from the acid spray by a plug of cotton-wool .
The result was:\#151 ; W. P. T. Y. P- V apour-pressure .

One terminal of an induction-coil , capable of giving ( with the battery power used ) a 6-inch spark , was connected with a wire passing into the first ( nearest the inlet ) flask in the thermostat ; the other terminal was connected with the bath , so that the silent discharge passed through the flasks and the air inside .
The result was normal .

The X-rays from an ordinary focus-tube were allowed to fall on the flasks in the thermostat , and were specially directed on to the last ( nearest outlet ) .
A wire from one of the terminals of a Wimshurst machine was passed down the gauge-tube into the last flask , the other terminal being connected with the bath .
With this double arrangement it was thought that the air in the last flask must be strongly electrified and produce a fog .
It was impossible to see whether there was a fog or not , but the effect on the vapour-pressure was as expected .

It may safely be concluded , therefore , that no naturally occurring supersaturation , or dust , or electrification of the air would have any appreciable effect on the result .
