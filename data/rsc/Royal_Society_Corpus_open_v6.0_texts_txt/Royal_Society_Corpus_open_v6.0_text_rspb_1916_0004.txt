176 Investigations dealing with the Phenomena of Clot Formations .
Part III.\#151 ; Further Investigations of the Cholate By S. B. Schryver , Assistant Professor in the Imperial College of Science .
( Communicated by Prof. V. H. Blackman , F.R.S. Received November 15 , 1915 .
) In the last communication it was shown that sodium cholate solutions readily set to a gel when heated to 50 ' in the presence of a calcium salt , and that gel formation is inhibited by the presence of various substances , the inhibitory action of which runs very nearly parallel with their narcotic action and their power of producing cytolysis or exosmosis from living cells * These observations are amplified in the present communication by the investigation of the action of the same series of substances on the disintegration of the gel , and of the antagonistic action of certain salts as regards gel formation .
The Disintegration of the Cholate Gel .
Method of Experiment.\#151 ; A mixture of 2c.c .
of 4-per-cent , solution of sodium cholate , 0'5 c.c. of N/ 5 calcium chloride and 1*5 c.c. of water was introduced into a capillary tube of 2 mm. internal diameter bent into the shape of a U. This was then placed in a thermostat at 50 ' , and heated for \#163 ; hour , after which interval the contents had set to a firm gel .
The tube was removed from the thermostat and , when cool , cut into lengths of 25 mm. These contained a 2-per-cent , cholate gel with calcium chloride of the concentration of N/ 40 .
Single lengths were then introduced into small Erlenmeyer flasks of about 20 c.c. capacity containing 10 c.c. of solutions of varying strengths of the substances under investigation in N/ 40 calcium chloride solution .
After an interval of 16 hours , the capillary tubes were removed from these solutions , and the erosion of the gel from both ends of the tube was measured .
The method employed was analogous to that suggested by Met for measuring the digestive power of solution of proteoclastic ferments .
The results obtained are recorded in Table I. The gramme-molecular equivalents per litre are calculated from the specific gravities of the substances and the solutions determined in the course of the earlier series of investigations .

It was there mentioned that two substances , viz. , methyl propyl ketone and urethane , had a smaller gel-inhibiting action than they should have , on the supposition that this property and the narcotic action run parallel .
These two substances in the above Table occupy almost the correct positions if the assumption is made that gel-destruction and narcosis are due to the same physical properties .
One other substance of the urethane series of compounds , viz. , methyl carbaminate , has also a relatively greater gel-destroying than gel-inhibiting power , and this is the only one in which any marked deviation between the narcotic and gel-destroying powers is demonstrated in the Table given above ; it should , if the parallelism between these properties were complete , follow instead of precede the propyl alcohols .
In the Table given in the previous paper showing the relationship between narcosis and gel inhibition it occupies the expected position .
The polyhydroxy-alcohols have but little action on the gel , and they also exert small narcotic action .
In spite of the one exception , the parallelism between the gel-destroying and narcotic properties is striking .
Phenomena of Clot Formations .
The Antagonistic Action of Salts .
In the former paper mention was made of the fact that sodium cholate solutions will set to a gel on the addition of large amounts of sodium chloride in the absence of calcium salts .
Attempts were made to investigate the combined action of the two salts , and it was found that sodium chloride , when present in relatively small amounts , instead of accelerating the gelforming action of calcium salts , exerted a marked inhibitory effect In the first series of experiments on this subject attempts were made to measure the clotting time in the presence of calcium salts and varying quantities of sodium and other salts by the method described in the earlier paper .
The concentration of calcium chloride chosen was N/ 40 , but the clot-formation was so gradual under the conditions chosen that no accurate results could be obtained .
Attempts were therefore made to ascertain the amounts of various salts which were necessary to inhibit entirely clot-formation when the various mixtures were heated in a thermostat at 50 ' .
The effect of the four following salts on the clot formation by calcium chloride was investigated\#151 ; sodium , potassium , lithium , and magnesium chlorides .
The following series of mixtures were made :\#151 ; ( a ) 2 c.c. of 4 per cent , sodium cholate sol .
+ 0'5 c.c. N/ 5 CaCL sol.+ 1'5 c.c. N salt sol .

The concentrations of the other salts were in ( a ) 9/ 24 N , ( b)7/ 24 N , ( c ) 5/ 24 1ST , and ( cl ) 3/ 24 N. It was found that after these mixtures had stood for hour in a thermostat at 50 ' , no clots had formed in ( a ) , ( b ) , or ( c ) , whereas the clot formation in ( d ) was complete .
No quantitative difference could be detected between the inhibitory action of the chlorides of lithium , sodium , potassium , or magnesium on the clot formation in the presence of calcium chloride .
In all cases a concentration of 5/ 24 N was sufficient to delay completely the clot formation for \#163 ; hour , whereas the concentration 3/ 24 N was insufficient .
The solutions of these salts also exert a considerable erosive action on the cholate gel .
This statement is illustrated by the following experiments : A gel was formed by heating 2 c.c. of 4 per cent , sodium cholate solution 4-0'5 c.c. N/ 5 calcium chloride solution + T5 c.c. water in capillary tubes by the same method as that already described in the experiments on the erosive action of narcotics .
Two lengths , each of 25 mm. , were then 180 Mr. S. B. Schrvver .

The same gel in " Met " tubes was introduced into 20 c.c. of N salt solutions , diluted with an equal volume of calcium chloride solutions of varying strength .
One length of 25 mm. was used in each experiment , and the result was measured after 16 hours .
The results are given in Table IV .

It will be seen from the above experiments that the gel is entirely destroyed by solutions of the chlorides of sodium , potassium and magnesium of the concentration N/ 2 .
This destructive action is , however , antagonised completely by the presence of calcium chloride in the strength of N/ 32 in the case of the two first-mentioned salts and in the strength of N/ 16 in the case of the third ; there is , however , but little erosion in the presence of magnesium chloride even when the strength of the calcium chloride is only N/ 32 .

Discussion of the Results .
In the second paper of this series , attention was called to the striking parallelism between the narcotic and cytolytic action of various organic substances , and their po\ver of inhibiting cholate gel formation .
In the present communication it is shown that the above-mentioned biological actions also run parallel with the power of these organic substances to produce gel erosion .
The analogies between biological action of substances and their action on gels has been extended further by the demonstration of the antagonistic action of certain salt solutions .
It has been shown , for example , that sodium , magnesium and other chlorides inhibit the gel formation by calcium chloride , and , furthermore , that the gel can be eroded by the said salts , and that the erosive action can be prevented by the addition to the salt solutions of relatively small amounts of calcium chloride .
As instances of the antagonistic action of salts the following examples may be quoted .
Loeb and Wasteneys* have shown that the Fundulusfish will live only a short period in sodium or potassium chloride solutions of the same strength as these salts exist in sea-water .
This toxic action of potassium and sodium salts can , however , be antagonised by the addition of small amounts of calcium salts .
Osterhoutf has shown that the life of the sea-water plant Rappia maritima , which is short in solutions of sodium or magnesium chlorides alone , is very appreciably lengthened by the addition of calcium salts .
The same author has investigated other instances of the action of " balanced salt solutions " on plant life and cell permeability , many of which present marked analogies to the antagonistic action of calcium to other salts on the cholate gel described above .
One more instance will suffice to illustrate the biological antagonism of salts .
Meltzer and Auerij : have shown that the injection of magnesium chloride to the amount of 1*7 grm. per kilogramme of body weight into a rabbit produces profound anaesthesia which is rapidly removed by the injection of relatively small amounts of calcium chloride .

182 Investigations dealing ivith Phenomena of Clot Formations .
the suggestion already made by the author , that the action of narcotics , cytolytic substances , etc. , is due , not to the action on lipoids , as is demanded by the hypotheses of Overton and Hans Meyer , but to their action on some gel-forming substance contained in the magma which holds together the heterogeneous system containing lipoids , proteins , etc. , which forms the basis of the cell membrane where such a differentiated structure exists , or even of the whole cytoplasm .
A disintegration of the gel structure in the cell by narcotics and cytolytic substances would cause an alteration in the state of aggregation of the heterogeneous system , and an entire derangement of the functions of the cell .
If a differentiated cell membrane exists a disaggregation of its gel would alter the permeability .
On this hypothesis , furthermore , the biological antagonism of certain salts can be explained , which is not possible with the acceptance of the lipoid theory of Overton and Meyer , unless it is assumed that the salts act on a constituent other than the lipoids .
Such an assumption has actually been made by Jacques Loeb to explain the antagonistic action of certain salts in cases which are f mentioned above ; this investigator suggests that the salts influence the state of aggregation of the proteins .
These instances of biological action of salts , and the analogous facts discovered in the study of the cholate gel , appear to throw some light on the general structure of cell-membranes and cytoplasm .
They suggest that these are constituted by a heterogeneous system held together in a magma containing a gel-forming substance possessing many of the physical properties of the cholate gel which have been described in the last two communications dealing with the clot formations from cholate solutions .
This hypothesis suggests an explanation not only of the action of organic substances , but also of certain actions of inorganic salts .
Summary .
It is shown that there is a marked similarity between certain vital activities of cells and the behaviour of cholate gel .
1 .
The erosive action of certain organic substances on the cholate gel runs parallel with their narcotic and cytolytic actions .
2 .
Gel formation by calcium chloride is inhibited by sodium , magnesium and other chlorides .
The same substances can also cause gel erosion , but the erosive action can be antagonised by the addition of relatively small amounts of calcium salts .

To explain the parallelism between certain biological actions of organic substances and the antagonistic action of inorganic salts on the one hand and the action of these substances on the cholate gel on the other hand it Gametogenesis and Sex-Dete7vmin Gall-Fly .
183 is suggested that the cell membrane or cytoplasm is constituted by a heterogeneous system of lipoids , proteins , etc. , held together in a magma containing a gel-forming substance with physical properties similar to those of the cholates .
On such a hypothesis , the biological action of certain substances can be explained in a manner more satisfactory than is possible by the assumption of the " lipoid " theory of Hans Meyer and Overton .

] In two previous papers on the maturation of the eggs and spermatozoa and determination of sex in Neuroterus * I showed ( 1 ) that any individual female of the agamic generation produces either male or female offspring , but not both ; ( 2 ) that the eggs of some agamic females undergo a reduction division at maturation , while those of others do not ; ( 3 ) that , since males have 10 chromosomes in the germ-cells before maturation , while females have 20 , the eggs which undergo reduction produce males , and those which do not , produce females ; ( 4 ) all eggs of the sexual generation undergo a double maturation division , and are fertilised , giving rise to females of the agamic generation with 20 chromosomes in the ovarian cells .
The maturation divisions in the eggs of the sexual generation were described as of a rather peculiar type , and some difficulty was experienced in forming a clear and connected idea of the process .
One important problem remained unsolved\#151 ; the nature of the difference between the male-producing and female-producing females of the agamic generation .
No difference was discernible between the flies of the two types , nor could any difference be found between their chromosome-groups in the ovarian divisions .
A tentative suggestion was made that the difference might depend on the existence of two kinds of spermatozoa , one of which might cause the fertilised egg to develop into a male-producing , the other into a female-producing agamic female , and this suggestion seemed to gain * ' Roy .
