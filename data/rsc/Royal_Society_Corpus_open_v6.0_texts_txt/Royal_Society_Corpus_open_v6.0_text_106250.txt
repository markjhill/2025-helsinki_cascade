XXVI .
Of the Degrees and Quantities of Winds requisite to move the heavier Kinds of Wind Machines .
In a Letter from John Stedman , M. D. Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh , to the Reverend Samuel Horsley , LL. D. Secretary to the Royal Society .
Edinburgh , SIR , March 27 , 1777 .
THE irregularity and uncertainty of winds in this country have been found a considerable discouragement to erect wind machines .
It hath frequently happened , that the proprietors of coal and other works , after having reared these kinds of engines , and having found them insufficient for the intended work , have been obliged to open mines , or to erect fire machines .
This is chiefly owing to the undertakers reckoning upon more winds of a sufficient power to move these machines , than we commonly have in this country .
Read Apr. 24 , 1776 .
These machines are rarely erected with us , unless where a considerable moving power is necessary .
This is always the case where the larger kind of pump-work is to be kept in motion , or where water is to be extracted from deep pits .
Having enquired of many people concerned in such works , what may be the proportion of time in which wind machines may be kept in motion , to that in which they cannot move from a defect of wind , I found these people differing widely in their conjectures .
Having , however , met with one gentleman of observation and accuracy , who had erected a wind machine for draining his coal ; he told me that , by the best computation he had been able to make , he never could depend upon more than fifty-three or fifty-four hours of wind sufficient for moving that machine , in a week , taking the year round .
This is below what is commonly believed to be the proportion ; but , so far as this can be rated by an estimate in the following manner , it will be found to be much about what may be depended upon for the heaviest kinds of machines ; still making allowance for the differences of exposures , and for the strength and frequency of winds in one part of the country more than in another .
We may here take notice of a circumstance favourable to the draining of coal-pits ; that is , that the periods of the year in which the greatest quantities of rain fall , are likewise observed to abound with winds of the higher degrees .
This seldom fails to hold in hilly countries , and particularly in those of high latitudes ; that is , where the differences of heats in summer and of colds in winter are very considerable .
The periods of the year here meant will generally be found to fall near the Equinoxes .
The only method of bringing the matter to a proper estimate is , by comparing the quantities of winds sufficient for moving these machines , with those of winds below that degree , and calms .
This computation can only be drawn from journals in which the degrees of winds are noted .
In the meteorological register of the Medical Essays of the Edinburgh Society , there is a column of winds , and four degrees are noted .
This division is sufficient for the purposes for which that register was intended ; but , when we consider the wind as a power acting upon machines , that number of degrees will be found too small .
Thus , from the second in that register to a hurricane , there is but one intermediate degree .
As the second degree , which is very moderate , is insufficient for moving these machines ; the third is more than just enough for that purpose .
A degree , therefore , which is a mean betwixt these two , will be found to be the lowest that is sufficient for moving machines of the heavier kinds , particularly such as are used for pumping water out of coal-pits .
These three degrees of wind , that is the second and third of the Edinburgh register , and an intermediate degree , are very distinguishable even by the senses , and without the assistance of any instrument , by those who are attentive and have been accustomed to make observations of this nature .
To ascertain proportions of this nature , a longer term of years would have been more satisfactory ; but , in case others should afterwards pursue this kind of computation , the proportions are digested in two tables at the end of this essay , and may be consulted occasionally .
In making up these tables , viz. one of the second degree and above , and the other of the third and upwards , hurricanes are included , though that degree of wind be too high for any machine .
But , as the observations were taken twice in twenty-four hours , and as winds sufficient to move these machines may be supposed to have happened sometimes between the times of observation , though at these times the wind might have been below the mean ; to compensate this defect , hurricanes are included in the computation .
From these tables then we have the following proportions of the two degrees of winds and upwards , to those below ; and likewise of the mean betwixt those two degrees .
Days .
Winds of the second degree and upwards in 4.283 each week , Calms and winds below the second degree , 2.717 Winds of the third degree and upwards , 0.902 Calms and winds below the third degree , 6.098 Winds of a mean proportion between the two 2.592 preceding degrees , Calms and winds below the mean degree , 4.408 The proportion of these winds in the year comes out in weeks and fractional parts thus : Weeks .
Winds of the second degree and upwards in 31.903 the year , Calms and winds below the second degree , 20.239 Winds of the third degree and upwards , 6.719 Calms and winds below the third degree , 45.423 Winds of a mean proportion between the two 19.307 preceding , Calms and winds below the mean , 32.835 From this computation we have 2.592 days in a week , or 19,307 weeks in a year , in which wind machines of the heavier kinds , and of considerable friction , may be supposed to be kept in motion ; which , to the times wherein they cannot go , is as 10 to 17 .
It may be observed , that the resistance to the machine , or its weight and friction , being diminished , though in a small degree , will add considerably to the frequency and length of times in which it can go ; since it often happens that there are winds immediately below the lowest degree in the preceding estimate , sufficient to keep the lighter machines in motion .
Hence those who have machines which are not absolutely of the heaviest kind , will be apt to conclude this computation erroneous .
Besides , there are few who make allowance for , or attend to , the universal law which obtains in mechanics , that in larger machines , their power doth not increase in a proportion so high as their bulk and the resistance arising from their friction .
Computations of this nature , if carried on for a sufficient length of time , might be of some use in regulating insurances , or in pointing out the risks of nautical adventurers , when made in the same climates with the calculation of winds .
Here I should have concluded ; but having , after writing what is above , committed these tables and observations to the examination of a learned member of your Society , ciety , much conversant in these matters , I had the satisfaction to find that he thought them worthy to be communicated to the Royal Society ; but remarked , that the materials , which I had proceeded upon , were not so applicable to the purpose as could have been wished .
He thinks , that the degrees of winds , being only distinguished into four in the journals from whence those tables have been compiled , are much too few to take in those of the weaker kind , that will however turn wellconstructed wind-mills .
Indeed I regretted that the table from which I made my estimate contained so few degrees ; but it was for that reason I calculated an intermediate degree between the second and the third of our meteorological register .
Now as all the degrees above that intermediate degree are sufficient to move the heaviest machine , and the degrees below it insufficient for that purpose , so far as I have been able to observe , it comes to be the same as if the table , from which I made the estimate , had consisted of eight degrees , supposing a mean proportion to be found between the other degrees : thus , 0 , 1/ 2 , 1 , 11/ 2 , 2 , 21/ 2 , &amp;c. this last number 21/ 2 , being the lowest degree which I find sufficient for the heaviest machines , would have been 5 , had these fractional parts been integers in the table , so that the highest degree , instead of 4 would have been 8 .
The mean , therefore , between 2 and 3 being found , will , if I mistake not , answer the preceding objection .
This worthy member , at the end of his observations , says , a mill so constructed may be expected to go the half of the year ; that is , I presume , a wind-mill constructed in the neatest and most ingenious manner .
But this , I have reason to believe , is far from being the case with wind-mills in this country , they being for the most part clumsy .
I doubt not but wind-mills , the construction of which this ingenious gentleman hath directed , though of the same size and consisting of the same numbers with those I have seen here , will nevertheless be moved by a lower degree of wind , and consequently will go a greater proportion of time , though they have the same resistance to overcome as others less artificially constructed .
Indeed the same wind machine , as is well known , will require a degree of wind considerably higher when its joints are dry or become gummy , than when they are sufficiently greased .
In my estimate I have all along had an eye to the wind machines which have the greatest resistance to overcome , and consequently the machines themselves of the largest kind .
But when the learned gentleman supposes a machine to go one half of the year , he may perhaps not understand one absolutely of the largest kind .
Now as the powers of similar machines , but of different magnitudes , are as their cubes , but the resistance arising from their weight and friction as the fourth power ; it follows , that a small difference in the size of two or more wind machines will require considerable differences in the winds necessary for their movements .
