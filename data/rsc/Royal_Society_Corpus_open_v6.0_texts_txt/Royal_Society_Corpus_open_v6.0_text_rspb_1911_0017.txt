) Introduction .
It is well known that there are cases of Sleeping Sickness in man which , under treatment , may enjoy long periods of apparent good health .
In these cases the individual is often able to live an active life , and insists on being at liberty to go about as he pleases .
In Uganda care is taken to prevent such cases entering the fly-areas ; but the difficulty in maintaining a supervision strict enough to check occasional visits to these areas is obviously great , and in other countries may be insuperable , so that the question as to how drug treatment can influence the infectivity of these patients to the fly may be considered to be of importance .
Other points arise from the consideration of this question , viz.:\#151 ; Can one or more doses of a trypanocidal drug render a Sleeping Sickness patient non-infective to Glossina palpalis ?
Does prolonged treatment during any stage of the disease render cases of Sleeping Sickness innocuous to the fly ?
If it be proved that the treatment of Sleeping Sickness patients by certain drugs does not prevent them infecting Glossina palpalis , then what percentage of cases give a positive result ?
and what percentage of flies are infected from these cases , as compared with the number of flies infected from untreated cases ?
To answer these questions it is necessary to classify under various headings the patients who are the subjects of this paper ; to state whether treated or untreated ; if the latter , to give details concerning the nature of the treatment , the duration of treatment , and the total quantity of drugs received .
The presence or absence of Trypanosoma gambiense in the blood or lymph glands of each patient should also be noted .
The classification of patients , according to the stage of the disease in which they present themselves , is that adopted by Dr. A. D. P. Hodges , C.M.G. , Principal Medical Officer , Uganda , in the " Progress Report on the Uganda Sleeping Sickness Camps , " from December , 1906 , to November 30 , 1908 .

These experiments were carried out from January to March , 1910 .
Of the 33 patients under observation , 6 belonged to Class A. 19 " " B. 7 " " C. 1 " " D. The methods adopted to test the degree of infectivity of patients to the fly in different stages of the disease were : ( 1 ) By mechanical transmission from Sleeping Sickness patient to normal monkey , and ( 2 ) by transmission of the disease from Sleeping Sickness patient to normal monkey after the parasite had completed its development in the fly .
1 .
By Mechanical Transmission from Sleeping Sickness Patient to Normal Monkey .
The procedure in testing the first method was as follows:\#151 ; A cage of laboratory-bred flies was first placed for two minutes upon the bare shoulders of a patient suffering from Sleeping Sickness , which was time enough to allow the majority of the flies to draw some blood , but not enough to satisfy them .
After an interval of five minutes the cage was transferred to the abdomen of a normal monkey , where it remained for two minutes , by which time nearly all the flies had completed their feed .
This procedure was repeated daily for six days .
Ten of the patients under experiment had been treated with soamin and perchloride of mercury administered by subcutaneous injection .
Two patients , who had been under treatment for one year , had received several doses of atoxyl , in addition to soamin and mercury .
Trypanosomes had been found at one time in the glands of all the patients , but no trypanosomes were found in their blood during the time the flies were being fed upon them .
* Classes C and D are not now differentiated .

The question as to whether the medicinal treatment of Sleeping Sickness patients has any preventive influence on this method of transmission remains unanswered .
It may , however , be noted that in the two untreated cases , viz. , Experiment 2281 , Class B , and Experiment 2284 , Class B , the disease was not transmitted mechanically , but , as will be seen later ( Table III , Experiments 2280 and 2298 ) , was conveyed after a period of development of the parasite within the fly .
2 .
By Transmission of the , Disease from Sleeping Patient to Normal Monkey after the Parasite had Completed its Development in the Fly .
The procedure adopted in the second method for transmitting the disease from a Sleeping Sickness patient to a monkey was as follows:\#151 ; A cage of laboratory-bred flies was fed daily for five or six days upon a patient suffering from Sleeping Sickness .
They were then starved for 48 hours , and subsequently fed daily for 50 days upon a normal monkey .
In most of these experiments the flies were dissected and examined for flagellates after the period of feeding upon the normal monkey .
The monkey 's blood was subsequently examined twice weekly for one month after the last date on which the flies were fed upon it .
Trypanosomes had been found at one time in the glands of all these patients , but no trypanosomes were found in their blood during the time the flies were being fed upon them .

Two of these had been under treatment for one week , and had each received two injections of soamin , 0*01 gramme , combined with perchloride of mercury , 0*02 gramme .
Two had been under treatment for one month , and had received four injections of soamin , 0*01 gramme , and perchloride of mercury , 0*02 gramme , per dose .
Two cases had been under treatment for two and a-half years : the total quantity of drugs received being , in one case , atoxyl , 16*2 grammes , perchloride of mercury , 2*4 grammes , and orpiment , 8*6 grammes ; the other case had received 18*8 grammes of atoxyl , 2*4 grammes of perchloride of mercury , and 8*6 grammes of orpiment .
Sleeping Sickness was not transmitted from any of these patients to monkeys by the flies .
Two hundred and seventy-three flies were dissected between the 4th and 51st days after feeding upon infected patients , but no flies were found infected with flagellates .
Only one patient belonging to Class D was available for these experiments .
This patient had been under treatment for one and a-half years , and had been treated with a total quantity of 13'4 grammes atoxyl , 0-4 gramme perchloride of mercury , and 6-5 grammes orpiment .
Flies were not infected from this case ; and the disease was therefore not transmitted to a normal monkey .

Sleeping Sickness was transferred from two untreated patients to normal monkeys .
The flies belonging to these experiments were not dissected .
The remaining four experiments from untreated cases were negative , both as regards infection of the flies ( 190 dissected ) and the conveyance of the disease to monkeys .
Of the 19 negative experiments from cases under treatment , four were from two patients who had been under treatment for one week .
They had each received two injections of soamin in 1-gramme doses , combined with 0*02 gramme of perchloride of mercury .
Eight experiments were from patients who had been one month under treatment .
They had each received four injections ( soamin 1 gramme , and perchloride of mercury 0*02 gramme , per dose ) .
Four experiments were from two cases who had been under treatment for 11 months .
One of these had received injections amounting in all to soamin 8 grammes , HgCl2 0T0 gramme , and orpiment 2 grammes .
Thp other patient had received a total amount of soamin 9 grammes , HgCl2 0T0 gramme , and orpiment ( ?

Two experiments were from patients who had been under treatment for two and a-quarter years .
They had each received a total quantity of drugs amounting to atoxyl 19*7 grammes , HgCl2 0*06 gramme , orpiment 4*60 grammes , and soamin 4 grammes .
One experiment was from a patient who had been three and a-half years under treatment , and had received during the last 18 months atoxyl 9*5 grammes , soamin 7*5 grammes , and orpiment 4*6 grammes .
From these 19 negative experiments 509 flies were dissected between the 4th and 52nd days after their last infected feed .
No flagellates were found in any of them .

120 4 50 \#151 ; 99 2242 Nil Nil 85 4 50 \#151 ; 99 Remarks.\#151 ; In Table IV , Class C , 10 experiments are recorded .
One of these was from an untreated case with large numbers of trypanosomes in the cervical glands , but none detectable in the blood .
The monkey was not infected by flies fed upon this patient , and so the flies were not dissected .
Of the 9 experiments from treated cases , Class C , three were from two patients who had been under treatment for one week , of whom one had been given a single dose of soamin 2 grammes , and HgCl2 0*04 gramme .
The other patient had received two doses .
The experiments performed from these patients were negative as regards infection of both monkeys and flies .
Three patients had been under treatment for one month .
Each of these patients had been given injections of soamin and perchloride of mercury , amounting to 2 grammes of the former drug and 0*08 gramme of the latter .
One of these experiments was positive , both as regards infecting the flies and transmitting the disease to monkeys .
Seventy-five flies were dissected from the positive experiment , 2034 .
Of these , four flies were found to be infected with Trypanosoma gambiense on the 28th , 39tli , 40th , and 46th day respectively after their last infected feed .
The four flies found to be infected with trypanosomes were injected into a susceptible animal , which subsequently developed Sleeping Sickness .
It is obvious that the results obtained from these experiments , though giving us some information , are insufficient to warrant a decisive answer to the questions before us .
With regard to the first query : Can treatment of Sleeping Sickness patients by the drugs named influence the infectivity of the fly ?
Omitting the mechanical transmission experiments , we may say that out of the 35 experiments only one produced a positive result , i.e. flies were infected and the disease transmitted from a Sleeping Sickness patient under treatment to a normal monkey .
The case referred to above will also entitle us to express an opinion as to whether one or more doses of a certain trypanocidal 344 Injectivity of G. palpalis Fed on Sleeping Sickness Patients .
drug can render a patient non-infective to the fly .
It will he seen that this case had been under treatment for one month , and had been injected with four doses of trypanocidal drugs .
The tsetse flies were infected 25 days after the last of the four injections had been administered .
Therefore , it may be said that to treat Sleeping Sickness patients with injections of soamin and perchloride of mercury , as specified , does not necessarily cause their blood to be incapable of infecting palpalis with Trypanosoma gambiense , and that flies so infected can transmit the disease to monkeys .
The percentage of flies infected from untreated cases was not ascertained , as only 190 flies were dissected , at various intervals , after feeding on their patients , and none were found infected .
A total of 857 flies were dissected , at different periods , after having fed upon treated cases , and four of these were found to be infected , a percentage of 0-46 .
These four flies all came from a cage containing 100 Glossina palpalis which had been fed on three occasions upon the only treated case that proved infective to the flies , vide Table IV , Experiment 2034 .
This patient therefore infected 4 per cent , of flies\#151 ; an interesting and important fact .
It was hoped that patients under the influence of trypanocidal drugs would be incapable of infecting tsetse flies .
Unfortunately , this experiment ( 2034 ) is sufficient to show that Sleeping Sickness patients under treatment with arsenical compounds , etc. , are not always innocuous to the fly , and should not be allowed their freedom to wander about the country during intervals of comparative good health , but must be kept completely and permanently isolated from all possible contact with the fly .
Conclusions .
1 .
Glossina palpalis fed on natives suffering from Sleeping Sickness , and untreated by drugs , may become infected and be capable of transferring the disease to healthy animals .
2 .
Glossina palpalis fed on natives suffering from Sleeping Sickness , and treated by arsenic and other drugs , may also become infected and be capable of transferring the disease to healthy animals .
