( Abstract .
) The genus of large extinct Marsupial herbivore which forms the subject of the present paper was founded on specimens transmitted ( in 1842 ) to the author by the Surveyor-General of Australia , Sir Thomas Mitchell , C.B. They consisted of mutilated fossil mandibles and teeth .
Subsequent specimens confirmed the distinction of Nototherium from Diprotodon , and more especially exemplified a singular and extreme modification of the cranium of the former genus .
