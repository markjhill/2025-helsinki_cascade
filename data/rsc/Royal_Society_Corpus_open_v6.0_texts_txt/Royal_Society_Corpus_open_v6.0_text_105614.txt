An Account of the same Transit ; by the Reverend Mr. Richard Haydon : In a Letter to John Bevis , M. D. To the Reverend Thomas Birch , D. D. Secretary to the Royal Society .
Dear Sir , I Send you enclosed , the Reverend Mr. Haydon 's observation of the late transit of Venus ; and should have waited on you with it long ere now , as I promised , but that I unluckily got a fall , which still confines me at home .
I presume this observation may deserve the notice of the Society , as the best circumstanced of any I have yet seen made in England : for several of the phases are earlier than those at Greenwich , or ours at Savile-House , taken with a telescope of Mr. Short 's , armed with Mr. Dollond 's new micrometer , and his time accurately ascertained .

Dear Sir , Your most obedient and affectionate humble servant , Clerkenwell-Close , Nov. 12 , 1761 .
J. Bevis .
By many comparisons of different observations , I make Mr. Haydon 's latitude to be 50~ 26~ 55~ , and his longitude west of London in time , 16 minutes 10 seconds nearly ; though he , from a memorandum he made some years ago , supposed it near two minutes more .
To John Bevis , Doctor of Physic .
SIR , Lelkeard , June 9 , 1761 .
I Should , with great pleasure , have pursued , in every particular , the method you recommended to me , in observing the late transit of Venus , but , unfortunately , had it not in my power to do so .
The low situation of my house , and a small hill at a distance to the N. E. of it , would not allow me , even from my garret windows , a view of the sun , till it was 11~ or 12~ above the horizon .
By this means , I was deprived of an opportunity of making two of the principal observations .
It was almost half an hour after five , when I could first get a sight of the sun .
I was in hopes , from what you had wrote me , that the planet had not at that time passed its nearest distance from the centre ; but had soon the vexation to find myself disappointed .
I , however , continued to observe the distance of Venus from the limb of the sun , with as much accuracy as I could , an account of which you have on the next leaf .
I think there cannot be an error of more than two or three seconds in the time of the interior contact , and not one of the total egress .
It was but two days before I received the favour of your letter , that I came down stairs for the first time , after a six weeks severe fit of the gout .
During my illness , my clock was run down , and stopped .
I immediately set it going again , as nearly to the time as I could then guess .
The next day , being the first of this month , at night I observed the transit of a star over the horizontal hair in the telescope of my quadrant .
The third day , I repeated the same , and again last night : by which you will see my clock measures time correctly enough .
Thursday , the 4th , was very hot and sultry all day ; the evening , hazy and foggy .
Fearing the night following might prove the same ( as it unluckily did ) , and that I should not be able to take the equal altitudes of any of the stars before and after they had passed the meridian , I observed , on Friday , several correspondent altitudes of the upper limb of the sun , in the morning and afternoon ; by which the time may be precisely enough ascertained .
At the bottom , I trouble you with an account of these observations , as also of some made the day following .
It gives me much concern , that I cannot herein answer your expectations , in a more perfect and satisfactory manner ; but , I assure you , Sir , I did every thing in my power for that purpose , and should most readily embrace any opportunity of testifying the respect I owe you .
I beg you 'll present my compliments to Mr. Short ; and am , SIR , &amp;c. R. Haydon .

Wherefore , he examined his notes again , but could not find he had made any mistake in transcribing them .
' ' He adds , that ` ` being obliged to observe from an upper window , his regulator being fixed below , but within hearing , he got a lad , of about fourteen , whom he strictly charged to be particularly attentive to the second shown by the clock , whenever he should call to him ; in which respect , he is of opinion , he made no mistake , though , possibly , he might make one with regard to the minute , by setting down one too many at the egress ; which he now thinks there is some cause to believe he did .
