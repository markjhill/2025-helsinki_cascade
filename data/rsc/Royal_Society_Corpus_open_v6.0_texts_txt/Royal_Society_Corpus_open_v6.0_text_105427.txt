Some Considerations on a late Treatise entitled , A new Set of Logarithmic Solar Tables , &amp;c. intended for a more commodious Method of finding the Latitude at Sea , by Two Observations of the Sun ; by H. Pemberton , M. D. R. S. Lond. et R. A. Berol .
S. AS it happens not unfrequently at sea for the unseasonable intervention of clouds to prevent the ordinary method of determining the ship 's latitude by the sun 's meridian altitude , even when it is of primary consequence , that the true latitude should be known ; a problem for remedying this disappointment is stated in many treatises of navigation , for finding the latitude of a place by any two altitudes of the sun , with the interval of time between them .
Read Nov. 20 , 1760 .
A problem similar to this is proposed , and solved instrumentally upon a globe , by a very early writer , Petrus Nonius ( a ) , namely , to find the latitude by two altitudes of the sun , and the angle made by the azimuth circles passing through the sun , when the altitudes are taken .
And since more commodious and accurate instruments for measuring time have been invented , than were known to this author , the other problem has been proposed for the same pur(a ) In Libr .

pose , of which a construction upon the principles of the stereographic projection of the sphere is exhibited by Mr. Collins , in his Mariner 's Plain Scale new planed ( b ) .
And as the direct method of solving both these problems by numbers requires a diversity of trigonometrical operations , a set of tables has lately been published for a more compendious way of computation in the problem , where the interval of time is given , whereby the ship 's true latitude may be very expeditiously derived from the ship 's dead reckoning , provided the observations are made within certain limits of time .
But however worthy of notice this method may be , new tables for the purpose are altogether unnecessary .
It consists of two parts : the first computes , from the latitude exhibited by the dead reckoning of the ship , the distance from noon of the middle time between the observations , and thence the time of either : the second operation computes , from one of these observations , what should be the sun 's meridian altitude , had the ship 's reckoning given the true latitude ; but if the latitude assumed from that reckoning is erroneous , the altitude thus computed will not be conformable to it ; however , if the times for the observations are properly chosen , it will much better agree to the true latitude , and thereby the assumed latitude may be more or less corrected .
But both these operations are an immediate consequence from the proposition in spherical trigonometry , usually delivered under the name of the fourth axiom , which is this ; That the square of the radius is to the rectangle under the sines of the sides con(b ) Book iii .

And this is the first operation in the treatise , these remarks concern .
For in the rectangle , the sin. ABD + ABC/ 2 x the sin. ABDAB C/ 2 , the first side , when the observations are both made on the same side of noon , and the second side of this rectangle , when one observation is before noon , and the other after , is the sine of the distance of the middle time between the observations from noon , and the other side is the sine of half the distance between the observations .
And in the new tables one column exhibits the arithmetical complement of the logarithmic sine of half the clapsed time , and the next , the logarithm of twice the sine of the middle time .

s. A F , these analogies express the second operation , which , in this treatise , is unnecessarily confined to the lesser angle AB C. The column in the table entitled Rising consists of logarithmic versed sines , which may be applied to either of the angles ABC or ABD promiscuously ; for here AF being equal to the excess of BC or BD above the arch B A , assumed for the complement of the latitude , the arches AC and A D , in the preceding analogies , will be the complements of the altitudes observed , if the latitude were truly assumed , otherwise not ; but the difference of their versed sines , will however be equal to the difference of the versed sines of the complements of the true latitudes ; for this is supposed in the first operation .
Therefore , if one of the fourth terms of these analogies be deducted from the versed sine of the complement of the greater altitude , or the other from the versed sine of the complement of the lesser , the remainder will be the same , and exhibit a versed sine for the complement of the sun 's altitude different from A F , when BA is assumed different from the true latitude , and nearer to the truth , if the times for the observations are properly chosen .

However , it must not be expected , that this method of computation will always converge thus expeditiously to the true latitude .
Had these observations been made about 3 hours sooner in the day , and with the same interval between them , if the first altitude of the sun had been found 18~ 55~ , and the second 33~ 11~ , the latitude computed would come out wider from the truth , than that assumed , one exceeding , and the other falling short of the true latitude , which will lie between them , and is nearly the same , as above .
But if the lesser altitude had been 29~ 13~ , and the greater 40~ ; in 9 degrees of north latitude the interval between the observations would have been nearly the same , as before .
But if this latitude be sought by any latitude assumed near it , the latitude computed according to the method above , will fall more remote from the truth , than that assumed , and err the same way .
In general , the error in the latitude assumed will bear to the error in the latitude computed , nearly the ratio compounded of that of the rectangle under the radius and the cosine of the distance from noon of the middle point of time between the two observations to twice sin. 1/ 2 ABCx sin. 1/ 2 AB D , and the ratio of rad .
x sin. AF to sin. BCx cos. A B ; insomuch that the distance of the middle point of time between the two observations from noon is to be considered , as the limit , where these computations shall cease to converge , when the rectangle under the radius , and the cosine of this distance from noon shall be to twice sin. 1/ 2 ABC x sin. 1/ 2 AB D , ( or the cosine of this distance to the difference between the versed sine of this distance from the versed sine of hals CBD ) as sin. BF x cos. AB to rad .
x sin. A F. And the errors in the assumed and computed latitudes fall on different sides of the true latitude , when both the observations are on the same side of noon , and the zenith lies between the meridian sun and the elevated pole ; or when the obervations are one before , and the other after noon , if the meridian sun passes between the zenith and the elevated pole : otherwise , they fall on the same side of the true latitude .
However , the direct method of computation , by the assistance of the natural sines , will not be so much more operose than this compendium , as may at first sight be imagined .
For the arch of a great circle being drawn through C and D , forming the triangle BC D , if the logarithmic cosine of BC or BD be added to the logarithmic tangent of half the angle CB D , and the logarithmic sine of BC or BD be added to the logarithmic sine of half this angle , the first sum is the logarithmic cotangent of the angle BC D , and the second the logarithmic sine of half C D , the base of the triangle .
Then , in the triangle AC D , from the sides , now all given , is to be computed the angle AC D , the difference between which , and the angle above found BC D , is the angle BC A , when the zenith lies between the pole , and the great circle through C , D ; but when the zenith lies beyond that circle , the angle BCA is either the sum of those angles , or the supplement of that sum to a circle .
And , in the last place , if twice the logarithmic sine of half this angle , and the logarithmic sines of BC and AC are added together , the sum , after thrice the logarithm of the radius has been deducted , is the logarithm of half the excess of the natural cosine of BC~AC above the natural cosine of A B , or the natural sine of the latitude , according to the trigonometrical axiom , which has been above referred to ; for rad .

Therefore , the latitude is 46~ 30~ 19~ .
But farther , as in the cases , where the above approximation takes place , it is an advantage , that the assumed latitude should be taken as near the true one , as can be , the dead reckoning of the ship need not be entirely relied on for that purpose ; for the instrumental construction proposed by Mr. Collins ( d ) will very readily give the true latitude , as nearly as the instruments used can express : and his method may be described thus .
Two straight lines AB , AC being drawn in an angle corresponding with the distance in time between the observations , and in one of the lines , as A B , the lengths A D , AE being taken from any scale of tangents , one equal to the tangent of half the sum , and the other equal to the tangent of half the difference of the distance of the sun from the pole , and from the zenith of the first observation , and also the points F , G , taken in the other line in the same manner related to the other observation ; then circles being described on the two diameters D E , F G , the distance of A from one of the ~ of these circles will be the tangent of half the complement of the latitude .
BC D F G E A Moreover , as in the treatise , which has given occasion to this discourse , it is proposed sometimes to take into consideration the ship 's motion during the time , between the observations , but imperfectly , regard being had to the change made by the ship in longitude only ; but the change in latitude also may be taken into consideration in the foregoing con(d ) In the place above cited .
struction , by making the angle BAC equal to the sum or difference of the interval of time , and the change in the ship 's longitude , according as that change is made towards the west , or towards the east , and then drawing a line from A , not to the intersection of the circles ; but so , that the portions of that line , terminated by each of the circles , may be the tangents of arches , whose difference is half the change in the latitude ; which , if made from the pole , requires the portion of the line terminated at the circle , whose diameter is D E , to be shorter than the other ; and the contrary is required , when the motion of the ship is towards the pole .
For determining the latitude by calculation , if the distance of the sun in the first observation from the zenith of the second could be found , this case would be reduced to the first , wherein the ship is considered , as stationary .
And for this purpose , it has been proposed to make an additional observation , by an azimuth compass , of the angle , the ship 's course makes with the azimuth of the sun , when the first altitude is taken ; and , perhaps , the same angle may be found with sufficient exactness from the latitude in the first observation assumed , whether from the dead reckoning , or from the foregoing construction .
Why I have taken no notice of the calculations exhibited by the author of the piece here animadverted on , as proofs of his method , will readily appear to those , who shall cast their eye upon them .
SCHOLIU M. The axiom in trigonometry , on which the calculations here discoursed of have been shown immediately diately to depend , was introduced by Regiomontanus , and is still retained , as the foundation of the present methods of computing logarithmically an angle from the three sides of a spherical triangle given , though they may be demonstrated more directly by the following lemma .
CC DFHD HEFE BB GG AA In the circle AB C , the chord AC being drawn , and the arch ABC bisected in B , if D be taken in the circle at pleasure , and the lines B E , DF drawn also at pleasure parallel to each other , one terminated by the circle in E , and the other by the chord AC in F ; then A D , DC being drawn , BExDF is = ADxD C. Draw DH perpendicular to A C , and also the diameter B G , joining E G. Then the angles FD H , EBG are equal , and the angles DH F , BEG right .
Therefore BE is to BG as DH to D F , and BExDF =BGxDH=ADxD C. Now , in the spherical triangle AB C , through B , and to the poles A , C , let the semicircles EB F , GBD be described , and the arch AC completed to a circle .
Then the semicircles EBF , GBD will be both perpendicular to the plane of this circle , cut it in their diameters E F , G D , and their common intersection BH be also perpendicular to it , and consequently perpendicular to G D , the diameter of the semicircle GB D , whereby G B , DB being joined , GDxGH is equal to G Bq , and GDxDH equal to B Dq .
Again , AK being drawn parallel to G D , the arch ACK is double A C , GCD double C B , EAD the sum of all the three sides of the triangle , EG= EDDG ( 2 C B ) , GF=AF ( A E ) +CG ( C D ) AC =ED2A C , and FD=EDEF ( 2 A B ) .
FC GHD AB K E Then E G , G F , F D , ED being joined ; in the first place , AK is to DG as AKxGH to DGxG H , also AK to DG as AKxDG to D Gq , but AKxGH =EGxGF by the preceding lemma , and DGxGH =G Bq ; whereby AKxDG is to D Gq as EGxGF to G Bq .
Hence AK being twice the sine of the arch A C , DG twice the sine of the arch G C , equal to B C , EG twice the sine of half the arch EA G , GF twice the sine of half the arch GF , ~ GB twice the sine of half the angle ACB to the radius of the circle GBD , which is half GD ; sin. AC x sin. BC is to rad.q as sin. 1/ 2 ED BC x sin. 1/ 2 ED AC to sin. 1/ 2 ACBq .
And this is Napier 's first method of finding an angle from the three sides given ( e ) , as it is usually delivered .
Again , AK is to DG , or AK x DG to DGq , as AK x DH ( ED x DF ) to DG x DH , or DBq .
Therefore , DB being twice the sine of half the angle BCD , or twice the cosine of half the angle ACB to the radius of the circle GBD , as sin. AC x sin. CB to rad.q so is 1/ 2 ED x sin. 1/ 2 ED AB to cos. 1/ 2 ACBq .
And this is Napeir 's second method ( f ) .
And lastly , the cosine of an arch or angle being to its sine , as radius to the tangent , sin. 1/ 2 ED x sin. 1/ 2 ED AB will be to sin. 1/ 2 ED BC x sin. 1/ 2 ED AC as rad.q to tang .
1/ 2 ACBq , which is a third method added by Gellibrand ( g ) .
Moreover , In plain triangles , from the three sides given may an angle be found by a process similar to each of these , as follows : ( e ) ~ .

EAGHFCD B In the plain traingle ABC , if on the centers A and C be described circles through B , cutting AC in E , F , G , and D , the perpendicular BH being let fall on AC , EH x HF is equal to GH x HD .
Therefore HF : GH : : HD : HE , and by composition GF : GH : : ED : HE , and : : ED GF : EG ; also HF : GF : : HD : ED , and : : DF : ED GF .
Moreover ED is = AB + AC + CB , EG = ED 2CB , FD = ED 2AB , ED GF = EG + FD = 2ED 2CB 2AB = 2AC .
Hence GF is to GH as 2AC to EG , whence GF x EG is = 2AC x GH ; and DH is to ED as DF to 2AC , that is , 2AC x DH will be = ED x DF .
Thus 2AC : DG ( : : 2AC x DG : DGq ) : : 2AC x GH ( EG x GF ) : DGH ( GBq ) and AC x CB : rad.q : : 1/ 2 ED CB x 1/ 2 ED AC : sin. 1/ 2 ~q .
Likewise 2AC : DG ( : : 2AC x DG : DGq ) : : 2AC x DH ( ED x DF ) : GDH ( DBq ) ; therefore AC x CB : rad.q : : 1/ 2ED x ED AB : cos. 1/ 2 ACBq .
And in the last place 1/ 2 ED x 1/ 2 ED AB :~ ED CB x 1/ 2 ED AC : : rad.q : tang .
1/ 2 ACBq .
This last proposition was first delivered by Gellibrand , and the other two not long after by Oughtred , in their respective treatises of Trigonometry .
BUT it may farther here be noted , that from two sides of a plain triangle , as AC , CB , with the angle between them ACB , the third side AB may be found either by the first or second of the foregoing proportions ; for by the first may be found EG x GF , that is , AFq AGq , and by the second ED x DF , or ADq AFq ; whence by a table of squares AF ( = AB ) may be readily found , for AG is equal to AC BC , and AD = AC + CB. In like manner in the spherical triangle from the sides AC , CB , and the angle ACB , may the third side be expeditiously found with the aid of a table of natural sines , by the axiom referred to in the beginning of this discourse , as modelled for this purpose by Napeir , in the proposition , which has been already referred to ( h ) , whereby the axiom is reduced to this analogy , Rad.q : sin.

( i ) An example of this method has been given above in the triangle ABC in p. 920 .
And in default of a table of natural sines , the base AB might have been found thus .
The sum of twice the logarithmic sine of 1/ 2ACB , added to the logarithmic sines of AC MAY it here be farther added , that thus all the cases of oblique spherical triangles may be solved without dividing them into rectangular ?
For when two sides and the angle included , or when two angles and the side between them are given , the two other angles or sides may be found by the proportions of Napeir and Briggs , whereby the other two angles or sides are found together ( k ) ; the proportions , when two sides with the including angle are given , being these , Cos.

The second of these has been demonstrated with great conciseness by Dr. Halley , from the principles of the stereographic projection of the sphere ( l ) ; and the first is derived by him from the second , but not and BC amounted to 37.596411 .

altogether with the same success , by his not observing , that if the base and one of the sides be completed to semicircles , the second of the two proportions in the supplemental triangle thence formed leads directly to the first in the original triangle .
And to conclude , if two sides , and the angle opposite to one of them , or two angles with the side opposite to one , were given ; when the other opposite part is found from the proportion between the sines of parts opposite , the remaining angle , or side , may be found by either of the two proportions foregoing .
