President 's Address .
1870 .
] in 1862 .
This discovery leads to a conclusion of great importance to the geologist .
The optic axes of a crystal of felspar serve as the index of a self-registering thermometer , and show that the crystal had never been exposed to a temperature reaching to 600 ' C. Circular polarization was first discovered in quartz by Arago in 1811 , and in chlorate of soda , bromate of soda , and acetate of uranium and soda , all three belonging to the cubic system , by Marbach in 1854 .
In 1857 M. Des Cloizeaux detected its existence in cinnabar , producing a rotation of a plane-polarized beam , sometimes to the right , sometimes to the left , to from 15 to 17 times the angle of rotation due to an equal thickness of quartz , \#151 ; and also , nearly at the same time , in sulphate of strychnine with 13 combining-weights of water , a crystal belonging to the pyramidal system , the rotation , in one direction only ( Herschel 's right-handed rotation ) , the same as that of its solution , and about half as great as in an equal thickness of quartz .
In February 1869 M. Des Cloizeaux discovered that benzile ( C14H10 O2 ) , a compound obtained by Laurent from the essence of bitter almonds in 1835 , in crystals belonging to the rhombohedral system , produced a rotation a little greater than that of quartz .
The crystals which came first into his possession were all dex-trogyre ; but he has lately obtained some producing a rotation in the opposite direction .
In his memoir on the Crystallization and Internal Construction of Quartz he has largely employed the method of exploration by polarized light .
During the summers of 1845 and 1846 he paid two visits to Iceland , in one of which , conjointly with M. Bunsen , he determined the temperatures , at different depths , of the great Geyser and the Strokkur , with the view of discovering the source of their heat , and the cause of the eruptions .
Any remarks on his very numerous and valuable determinations of the forms of crystalline species , as well as on the geological observations made by him in Iceland , would be obviously out of place in a summary of the researches on light and heat which render him eligible as a recipient of the Rumford Medal .
Professor Miller , In Monsieur Des Cloizeaux 's unavoidable absence , I request you , as our Foreign Secretary , to convey to him this Medal , in recognition of the value which the Royal Society attaches to his researches .
Gentlemen , If elected for the year which commences this day , and if I should be able to meet you here at your next anniversary , it will be to deliver over this Chair , doubtless to a younger , it may well be to a worthier occupant ^ it can hardly be to one having the welfare of the Royal Society more warmly at heart .
