Nummary of Conclusions .
1 .
Red blood corpuscles are hsemolysed by the action of a-rays , and oxy-hsemoglobin is converted into met-haemoglobin .
2 .
Leucocytes undergo marked degenerative changes when subjected to a-rays .
During the process of clotting , leucocytes appear to move away from an a-radiated region .
This movement has been attributed to changes found to occur in the surface tension of blood serum when radiated .
3 .
The .
specific properties of opsonin and haemolytic complement are lost when serum is exposed to a-rays .
The progressive changes caused by these rays indicate the separate identity of opsonin and complement .
4 .
The / 3- and 7-rays have yielded negative results in analogous experiments .

Method .
It is usually assumed that transpiration is regulated by two principal factors : ( 1 ) the relative humidity of the air , and ( 2 ) the degree of aperture of the stomata .
Neither of these assumptions has been experimentally proved , though both of them are necessarily true , but it must be remembered that the factors referred to are not necessarily the only ones that govern the phenomena .
The experiments hitherto made on ( 1 ) the effect of relative humidity are 1911 .

137 vitiated by want of precise knowledge as to the stomatal aperture during the course of the enquiry * Hitherto it has also been found difficult to test assumption ( 2 ) , i.e. , that transpiration is a function of stomatal aperture , because we had no really trustworthy method of estimating that aperture in the living leaf .
Stahl 's cobalt methodf and the horn hygroscopej are not free from Lloyd's^ objection to them\#151 ; that they indicate variations in the yield of water-vapour which need not necessarily be dependent on changes in stomatal aperture .
The point we are discussing is the subject matter of Lloyd 's book on stomata .
His method of observation is to strip the epidermis from the living leaf and plunge it at once into absolute alcohol .
, He asserts that specimens so prepared exhibit under the microscope the condition of the stoma as it was in life .
The result of a series of careful measurements , compared with records of transpiration , is to convince Lloyd that the aperture of the stoma is not the dominant factor , and that transpiration is , on the contrary , regulated by some unknown properties of the plant .
He does not , I think , tell us what he suspects these unknown properties to be , but it is not difficult to imagine internal interference with the loss of water .
Although we recognise the value of Lloyd 's work , we are not convinced by it ; we believe that a much more intimate knowledge of the living stoma and its movements would be -necessary to prove his contention || that " the regulatory function is almost nil " With a view to testing the question we have designed an instrument which we propose to call a porometer.1T The idea is to estimate changes in the stomata by recording the change in the velocity of a current of air drawn through them in the living leaf .
The construction is shown in the following figure in a diagrammatic form .
A glass chamber ( C ) bearing a broad flange is cemented to the stomatal surface of a leaf ( L ) .
A rubber tube connects C with a tube ( T ) , one limb of which is graduated and dips into the vessel of water ( V ) .
The other limb ends in a tube controlled by a clamp ( M ) .
By applying suction ( as indicated by the arrow ) and then closing the clamp M , a column of water is raised to A. * We hope to publish before long a method of demonstrating the dependence of transpiration on relative humidity , of which some account was given at the Sheffield meeting of the British Association in 1910 , when some of the experiments given in the present paper were also described .

original level B. By again applying suction , the column is again raised , and the observation can be repeated as often as may be necessary .
The time in which the column falls , say from A to B , is recorded .
We thus get a series of readings of the rate of flow at the mean pressure | ( A + B ) .
The mean is generally 20 cm .

It is obvious , if successive readings are made at a known mean pressure , that a diminution in the aperture of the stomata will give a slower fall of the water column ( fig. 1 ) from A to B. And as a matter of fact it is found that such diminution of flow is produced by the well-known causes of stomatal closure , such as darkness or faint illumination , withering , poisons , etc. Fig. 2 .

Difficulties .
The chief difficulty encountered was to find a method of fixing the chamber to the leaf which should be non-injurious and should make an air-tight joint .
After many trials we conclude that ordinary glue is the best medium : it adheres well both to the leaf and to the glass flange , and is not injurious .
The best way is to let the glue get fairly cool ( say 30 ' C. ) , and paint it thickly on to the flange of the chamber , which is then gently pressed on to the stomatal surface of the ( inverted ) leaf and clamped in that position , the leaf being supported on a horizontal glass plate ( not shown in fig. 1 ) .
Another method is to cut out a washer a perforated disc ) from a layer of 20-25 per cent , gelatine about a centimetre in thickness , and to press the chamber firmly down on the washer , and clamp it in that position .
Here , again , the leaf has the stomatal side upwards , and is supported by a horizontal glass plate .
This method is best for tough leaves , e.g. , Ficus elastica , F. laurocerasus , ivy ( H. helix ) , etc. , which do not appear to be injured in spite of being compressed between the gelatine and the supporting glass plate .
With care , however , delicate leaves may safely be treated in the same way .
In the earlier experiments gelatine with a percentage of glycerine was used ; this , however , is injurious .
The same may be said of vaseline and other greasy substances which were employed at an early stage of the inquiry .
S 3 .
The Forometer compared with other methods , i.e. , the Cobalt Test , the Horn Hygroscope , and Lloyd 's Microscopic Method .
The porometric method is a direct one , and must therefore be classed with the microscopic method , since both are absolutely independent of transpiration , * whereas the two hygroscopic methods are indirect , and alterations in stomatal aperture cannot be inferred with certainty from the observations in question .
The porometer shares with the last-named methods the great advantage of being continuous , that is to say , it allows of prolonged observation of a given leaf .
Lloyd 's method entails the sacrifice of a leaf for each observation .
Moreover , his measurements are not actual observations on living tissue , whereas the porometer and the hygroscopic methods have this merit .
A striking point about the porometer is its great range .
Thus the rate of air-flow in an illuminated leaf may be as much as 400 times as rapid as the flow through the same leaf in darkness .
The porometer , being more delicate than the hygroscopic methods , confirms the observations made some years * All that is here meant is that the flow of air through the stomata is not in any way influenced by the amount of water vapour diffusing through the same openings .
Dr. F. Darwin and Miss D. F. M. Pertz .
[ June 15 , ago* on withering leaves , in which the stomata were apparently open long after the leaf ceased to react to the horn hygroscope .
The great advantage of Lloyd 's microscopic method is that it gives ( assuming it to be trustworthy ) absolute quantities , i.e. , it gives the actual size of the stomatal pore .
The porometer only gives relative sizes .
Lloyd 's method suffers from the fact that , on a given leaf at a given moment , stomata are found varying from 10 to 1 units in diameter .
And , since it is impossible to give unlimited time to each reading , it follows that his determinations of stomatal sizes are rather rough .
The porometer , on the other hand , automatically strikes an average of many hundred stomata at each reading , and this we believe to be a great advantage over the microscopic method .
A cognate fact is that , on a given branch at a given time , the different leaves may have stomata in very different conditions as to aperture .
The following figures illustrate the differences observed in the laurel:\#151 ; Experiment 78.\#151 ; P. laurocerasus .
October 18 , 1910 .
The leaves were numbered from the apex downwards , and were all of the current year except Nos. 12 and 13 , which were unhealthy-looking leaves of 1909 .

The stomata on the old leaves , Nos. 12 and 13 , are considerably more closed .
If this fact is true for other plants ( and we have reason to believe it is so ) , it is clear that any comparison between transpiration and the aperture of the stomata , as estimated by the rate of flow through a single leaf , is not necessarily trustworthy , because the transpiration of a branch must depend on the average aperture of the stomata on a number of leaves , while the rate of flow is dependent on the behaviour of a single leaf .
From this point of view Lloyd 's method must be commended , it being part of his technique that many leaves should be examined.j* * F. Darwin ( '98 ) , p. 547 .

Stomatal Aperture in Relation to Transpiration .
The object of the present paper is to give an account of the new method , and to illustrate its applicability to some of the problems of stomatal movement .
Nevertheless , we propose to give a single instance of the resemblance which exists between variations in the transpiration rate , on the one hand , and the variation in the size of the stomata as indicated by the porometer .
This resemblance , which forms the subject of a future paper , can only be established by the average result of a considerable number of experiments , * partly , no doubt , because of the irregularity in the stomatal behaviour of individual leaves , but probably for other reasons as well .
The following experiment is merely intended to show that the correspondence between the two curves may be fairly close .
But variations from this degree of parallelism are both common and great .
The curve S in fig. 3 is constructed not from the rate of air-flow through the leaf , but from the square root of the rate ( ^/ K ) .
Our experience is that a curve so constructed follows the transpiration curve more closely than curves built from any other function of the rate of flow .
We hope elsewhere to give an account of the theoretical considerations bearing on the problem , and for these we are indebted to the kindness of Sir Joseph Larmor .
It is not certain that we shall ever be able to deduce the size of the stomata from the readings of the porometer ; but it seems well to make use of the square root of the air-flow in recording our results , and to do so even in the experiments in which the relation between stomatal aperture and transpiration is not directly investigated .
And this rule has been generally followed .

The most striking departure of the stomatal curve S ( the square root of rate of flow ) from the transpiration curve T is between 2 and 4 p.m. This will be seen if the salient points in the two curves are reduced to a. common scale by assuming that , at one of these points { e.g. , the end of the dark period ) , both transpiration and flow are equal to 1 , and .

On the following day there is irregularity which is not clearly connected with changes in illumination .

1911.1 New Method of Estimating the Aperture of Stomata .
149 It will be seen that with JY .
glaum ( fig. 6 ) there is a sudden fall in the curve about sunset .
Owing to the fact that no readings were taken between 6.45 and 7.47 , it is impossible to know at what hour the fall began .
In the observations ( F. Darwin ( '98 ) , p. 595 ) made with the horn hygroscope on Tropseolum and Pelargonium , there is a similar fact , i.e. , a gradual fall during the afternoon and a sudden fall about sunset .
But in Experiment 67 the stomata had nearly reached their utmost degree of closure 24 minutes after sunset , whereas in Pelargonium this was clearly not the case , and probably not so in Tropeeolum .
On the other hand , in Narcissus ( op .
cit. , p. 589 ) the horn hygroscope was at zero 38 minutes before sunset .
In the observations on the laurel in the present paper ( fig. 7 ) , the curve falls from about 4 p.m. to 9.17 , no very great effect of sunset being visible .
The most interesting fact observable in figs. 6 and 7 is that the stomata begin to open long before sunrise ; in fact , almost as soon as they have reached the maximum of closure .
This is especially striking in fig. 7 , but is perfectly clear with N.glauca , fig. 6 .
Further work will show whether the phenomenon is a general one .
In both plants a sudden opening of the stomata occurs about sunrise .
There can be little doubt that the opening of the stomata during the early hours of the night is due to periodicity : Lloyd ( '08 , p. 37 ) remarks under the heading of " normal daily periodicity " that there seems " to be a tendency for stomata to open a little during the night .
" He shows ( p. 67 ) also the existence of a rise in transpiration rate during the night and early morning in complete darkness , but ( pi 73 ) he speaks doubtfully as to the connections of this fact with increased stomatal aperture .
The whole question of periodicity requires re-investigation with the porometer .

In two previous papers* the curious fact has been recorded that the closure of the stomata , produced by depriving a leaf of water-supply , is often preceded by increased transpiration , which was assumed to be due to opening of the stomata and was accordingly described as the " temporary opening .
" Lloydf has investigated the phenomenon in question and concludes that it does not occur .
Whether this is due to his relying on the microscopic method or to the fact that he experimented on other plants we cannot say .
The following experiments show very clearly that , at any rate in certain plants , a striking temporary opening of the stomata occurs :\#151 ; * F. Darwin ( '98 ) , p. 548 , and ( '04 ) , p. 89 .

Within five minutes of the severance of the leaf-stalk the stomata had begun to open with great rapidity ; the opening continued for 28 minutes , when it was replaced by rapid closure , which gradually became slower , the curve between 4 and 7 p.m. ( not shown in the diagram ) being a very flat one .
The temporary effect of cutting off water-supply was to increase the rate R in the proportion 50 :156 or 1 : 3'1 .
This is much greater than was ever observed with the horn hygroscope .
Thus* with Campanula vidalii the rise was from 20 to 33 , i.e. , as 1:1'65 , and in Tropaeolum from 40 to 60 , i.e. , as 1 : 1*5 .

This , as far as it goes , confirms our view that y/ R represents the amount of transpiration more closely than does R ( the rate of air-flow ) .

The curve is constructed from the square root of the rate of flow .
The result must be considered as somewhat rough , since when the fall of the water column is so rapid as at 12.18 , it is not possible to time it with accuracy .
Nevertheless , we may safely assume that the rate of flow 1911 .

153 increased as from unity to between 8 and 9 ; this is a much greater opening than occurred with Mcotiana and a fortiori than in the experiments with the horn hygroscope .
When estimated by the opening of the stomata is from 1 to between 2*8 and 3 , and this again is greater than anything observed with the horn method .
Another experiment with Tropaeolum ( October 26 , 1910 ) is here given in an abbreviated form .

There is one difference between the results obtained with the porometer and the horn hygroscope , namely , that the opening and subsequent closure are completed much more rapidly with the horn .
I imagine that this may be due to the fact that in porometer experiments the act of withering is delayed by the damp air within the chamber .

Conclusion .
In the foregoing sections our aim has been to give a preliminary account of the porometer and its application to the study of stomata .
The principal merits of the method are ( 1 ) that the readings of the instrument are dependent on the aperture of the stomata , and are therefore VOL. LXXXIV.\#151 ; B. M 154 New Method of Estimating the Aperture of Stomata .
independent of transpiration .
The porometer is accordingly superior to the hygroscopic methods ( e.g. , Stahl 's cobalt test and the horn hygroscope ) , from which variations in aperture can only be inferred from increased transpiration ; ( 2 ) the porometer indicates the behaviour of a group of living stomata which can be continuously studied for hours or even days .
In this it compares favourably with Lloyd 's microscopic method , which , however , has the advantage of giving the actual size of the stomatal pore , instead of merely a series of readings from which changes in the size in the stoma can be inferred .
As a test of the porometer we have selected two of the principal factors that influence stomatal aperture , namely , illumination and water supply ; we have shown that the known effects of these agencies are well demonstrated by our method .
In the case of leaves severed from the plant we have confirmed a statement made by one of us , viz. , that the first effect of withering is the opening of the stomata , which is , however , followed by closure .
The section on the causal relation between stomatal aperture and transpiration is a single illustration of the conclusion , which we hope to justify when the results of a considerable series of experiments already made are published .
We desire to thank Mr. F. F. Blackman for many useful suggestions made to us in the course of our research .
