The most that can he said at present , with anything like certainty , is that the Dipnoi are the isolated survivors of an exceedingly ancient group , which was probably related to the ancestors of existing Fishes and Amphibians .
Amongst the former , the connexion seems to be closest to the Elasmobranchs , more particularly to the Chimseroids on the one hand , and to such an ancient Selachian type as Chlamydoselache on the other ; but at the same time , the Ganoids probably arose from the common ancestral stock not very far off .
Though retaining many primitive characters , the Dipnoi , and more especially Protopterus and Lepidosiren , are in some respects highly specialised , the specialisation being largely due to a change of habit .
