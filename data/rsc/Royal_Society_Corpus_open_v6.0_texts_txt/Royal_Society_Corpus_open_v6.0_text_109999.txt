] The relations of electricity to space , as nearly void of matter as it can be made on the earth 's surface , are connected with many important queries bearing upon the nature of heat , light , electricity , and magnetism .
The vacuum used by Sir Humphry Davy was that above the mercury in the barometer tube , and a more perfect one produced in the same way by fused tin ; the former he found always permeable to electricity , but the colour and intensity of the light in traversing the mercurial atmosphere was remarkably affected by its temperature ; it became green and vivid when the tube was heated , and was scarcely perceptible in a very dark room , when it was cooled to 0 ?
; which phenomena , as well as some others described by the author , are referable to the varying density of the mercurial vapour .
The admission of a little air rendered the light blue , and improved the conducting power of the medium .
The most perfect vacuum that could be obtained above fused tin , was also permeable to electricity ; but the light was yellow and exceedingly pale , and only slightly increased by heat .
Electric and magnetic repvilsions and attractions took place in the mercurial vacuum , as in air ; -a circumstance which shows , says Sir Humphry , that they are not dependent upon elastic ponderable matter , and point them out as primary causes of other electrical phenomena .
From the aggregate results of his researches , the author thinks it evident that the light , and probably the heat , generated in electrical experiments , depend principally upon some properties or substances belonging to the ponderable matter through which it passes , and they render it probable that it is entirely owing to this source .
