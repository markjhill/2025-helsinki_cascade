] In the present improved state of astronomical observations , it is , material to possess the readiest and most accurate means of finding the apparent time .
The right ascension of certain fixed stars having been precisely obtained relatively with each other , and with the equi .
noctial points during the course of many years , affords the direct method of ascertaining the right ascension of the mid-heaven : hence the convenience of having the corrections of these stars in the fotm of tables , that the same may be taken out at one view with the arguments of the sun 's longitude , and of the moon 's node .
For this purpose the mean diurnal motion is adapted to the longitude of the sun , as found in the Nautical Almanac , at the time the star passes the : meridian .
The mean epoch is reduced to the vernal equinox less four seconds , in order to render the corrections additive ; which , being an universal period , the same applies to all parts of the world .
To these tables Mr. Groombridge has subjoined some observations of the planets at and near the oppositions ; also of the solstices of the last two years , and of the comet of 1819 .
