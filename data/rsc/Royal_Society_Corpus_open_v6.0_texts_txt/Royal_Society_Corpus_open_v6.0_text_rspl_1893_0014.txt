) ( Abstract .
) Nature of Mycetoma.\#151 ; A very chronic , locally spreading inflammation of the foot , much less commonly of the hand ; characterised by the destruction of the tissues , great overgrowth of granulation tissue , and by the presence of very numerous , fish-roe-like particles , or more rarely of black particles .
Views held concerning Mycetoma.\#151 ; In 1874 , Carter held that the " fungus foot " was a veritable parasitic disease , due to the .
growth and extension , within the tissues , of an " indigenous mould .
" He came to the conclusion that it was one species , the Garteri .
Lewis and Cunningham ( 1888 ) concluded that mycetoma was " essentially a degeneration of the fatty tissues , independent of the local presence or influence of any parasites whatever .
" Bassini ( 1888 ) met with a case in Italy , the only one , as yet , observed in Europe , and concluded that the parasite was allied to the higher Fungi , either the Aspergilli or Mucorini .
Most recently , Dr. Kanthack brought forward evidence to show the identity or close affinity of the parasite with that of actinomycosis .
Our Views.\#151 ; That the black particles represent a curious metamorphosis of a large , branching , septate fungus ; whilst the white particles consist largely of caseous material and of the remains of a lowly organised fungus , presenting in very many instances some of the characteristics of the fungus of actinomycosis .
That both fungi are pathogenic .
The following observations in support of these views are based upon an 1893 .
] Existence of more than one Fungus in Mycetoma .
Ill examination of seven specimens of the black variety and of eighteen of the white , obtained from Bombay and from the various museums throughout the United Kingdom .
Black Variety.\#151 ; Sections of the particles , free or in situ in the tissues , show that they are composed of tufts of a deep brown colour , and apart from a faint radiation or the presence of a slight venation or of holes , they give very little indication of a vegetable structure .
By boiling the particles for from a few minutes to one hour in concentrated caustic potash , the brown colouring matter is very slightly removed , but this is completely discharged upon transferring them to distilled water ; the fungus can then be readily studied .
The animal tissues are however , destroyed by this process .
If , however , the tissue containing the particles is embedded in collodion , washed for about one minute in " eau de Javel , " and then stained , the colouring matter is removed from the fungus , and its relationship to the tissues around can be readily seen .
The fungus appears the same in all the specimens of the black ; the hyphae radiate and branch , the segments vary very greatly in size ; they may be spherical and reach a very great size , or long and slender ; a pseudo-parenchyma may be formed in the centre of a tuft , or a palisade at the periphery .
We have seen no organs of fructification .
Tissue reaction.\#151 ; The tufts are embedded in granulation tissue or necrosed material , and the presence of very large giant cells and other phagocytes is characteristic .
The hyphen may penetrate the vessels and run in their ^interior .
The metamorphosis of the fungus appears to take place very early and affects equally the various hyphae throughout the tissues .
The nature and meaning of the change is very obscure .
The dried particles burn with a luminous flame .
Incinerated , there is a slight smell of burnt feathers , and in the ash , which is very little , there is a brown coloration , owing to the presence of iron ; the presence of the latter may be confirmed in the unclarified and clarified specimens by the Prussian blue test .
The iron is , however , limited to the periphery of the tufts , and appears wholly derived from the animal tissues .
The particles give a red reaction with dilute nitric and hydrochloric acids : little impression is produced upon them by boiling in the various fat solvents ; they give no special reactions with ferric chloride or cupric acetate ( resin test ) .
White Variety.\#151 ; Sections of the particles are characteristic .
In the centre are usually numerous small reniform deeply-staining masses , surrounded by a deep radiate zone .
In the central bodies a very fine reticulum may occasionally be made out ; more usually , stronger evidence of the fungus is obtained by the presence of dwarfed club-like hyphee , which form an irregular fringe to the reniform bodies .
It is exceedingly difficult to ascertain what gives rise to the deep radiate zone ; the leucocytes in it are compressed , yet the compressing Presents .
[ Mar. 9r hyphae remain for the most part unstained .
The fungus undergoes very early degeneration .
Tissue reaction.\#151 ; The particles are surrounded by leucocytes and are either embedded in granulation tissue or lie free in the abscess cavities or sinuses .
In both varieties the spread of the particles and inflammation goes hand in hand , and a recurrence of the particles and of the inflammation has been observed by one of ns in the scar left after amputation for the black variety of fungus foot .
