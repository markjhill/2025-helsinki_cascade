Mr. HARLEY* has shown that any root of the equation yn-zy-+(n-1)x=0 satisfies the differential equation ( D_2nb-1 ) ( D_3n-2 ) tD_n-n+ InAn )\ n Y( D(1)-l)..(D-n-ly. .

=x , and D= d , provided that n be a positive integer greater than 2 .
This result , demonstrated for particular values of n , and raised by induction into a general theorem , was subsequently established rigorously by Mr. CAYLEY by means of LAGRANGE'S theorem .
For the case of n=2 , the differential equation was found by Mr. HARLEY to be YD ey=6 ... ... ... ... ( 2 ) Solving these differential equations for the particular cases of n=2 and n=3 , Mr. HARLEY arrived at the actual expression of the roots of the given algebraic equation for these cases .
That all algebraic equations up to the fifth degree can be reduced to the above trinomial form , is well known .
A solution of ( 1 ) by means of definite triple integrals in the case of n =4 has been published by Mr. W. H. L. RUSSELL ; and I am informed that a general solution of the equation by means of a definite single integral has been obtained by the same analyst .
While the subject seems to be more important with relation to differential than with reference to algebraic equations , the connexion into which the two subjects are brought must itself be considered as a very interesting fact .
As respects the former of these subjects , it may be observed that it is a matter of quite fundamental importance to ascertain for what forms of the function p ( D ) , equations of the type u+ ( D)e =0 ... ... ... . .
( 3 ) admit of finite solution .
We possess theorems which enable us to deduce from each known integrable form an infinite number of others .
Yet there is every reason to think that the number of really primary forms-of forms the knowledge of which , in combination with such known theorems , would enable us to solve all equations of the above type that are finitely solvable-is extremely small .
It will , indeed , be a most remarkable conclusion , should it ultimately prove that the forms in question stand in absolute and exclusive connexion with the class of algebraic equations here considered .
The following paper is a contribution to the general theory under the aspect last mentioned .
In endeavouring to solve Mr. HARLEY'S equation by definite integrals , I was led to perceive its relation to a more general equation , and to make this the subject of investigation .
The results will be presented in the following order : First , I shall show that if 'u stand for the mth power of any root of the algebraic equation in _ yn-1 L= 0 , then 'a , considered as a function of x , will satisfy the differential equation [ D]"+ D+'I ( -n-l-iW-o in which e0=x , D= and the notation dO [ a]b=a(a-l)(a-2). .
( a-b +l ) is adopted .
Secondly , I shall show that for particular values of m , the above equation admits of an immediate first integral , constituting a differential equation of the n--l th order , and that the results obtained by Mr. HARLEY are particular cases of this depressed equation , their difference of form arising from difference of determination of the arbitrary constant .
Thirdly , I shall solve the general differential equation by definite integrals .
Fourthly , I shall determine the arbitrary constants of the solution so as to express the mth power of that real root of the proposed algebraic equation which reduces to 1 when x==0 .
The differential equation which forms the chief subject of these investigations certainly occupies an important place , if not one of exclusive importance , in the theory of that large class of differential equations of which the type is expressed in ( 3 ) .
At present , I am not aware of the existence of any differential equations of that particular type which admit of finite solution at all , otherwise than by an ultimate reduction to the form in question , or by a resolution into linear equations of the first order .
It constitutes , in fact , a generalization of the form a(D 2)2 + n2e + D(D _i given in my memoir " On a General Method in Analysis " ( Philosophical Transactions for 1844 , Part II .
) .

PROPOSITION.-If u represent the mth power of any root of the algebraic equation in _ xyn-_ 1= 0 , then u , considered as a function of x , satisfies the linear differential equation n-VD +m_ 12 ( D m [ Du+[I'D+m-1I --Ieu01 in which e0=x , and D=dAnd the complete integral of the above differential equation will be u= CQym +C2y2. .

Representing yf by z , we may give to the proposed algebraic equation the form n-\ z=b+xz. .

Hence by LAGRANGE'S theorem mm n-l / m\ d/ 2(n-1 ) d m\,2 U=zn=n+^b n b)+b-b n ) dc .

( 3 ) which , on effecting the operations indicated , becomes m\+( 1)_1 bn ( 4 ) n [ r ] We see then that u is expanded in a series of the form u0+UZ , X+U22+ &amp;c. ad inf ' , in which , since b=1 , ~m+(n-l})~r.-l m-r m\ ( n ' *x ( 1 ) n and this expression will represent the first term as well as the succeeding coefficients of the Lagrangian development , provided that we interpret the form [ p ] ?
by 1 , and [ p]- ' by r1 As ln admits of n distinct values , the above development may be made to represent the mth power of any one of the n roots of the given algebraic equation .
In particular , if we give to 1^ the particular value 1 , we have -[m + ( n--)r.--1 and the expansion then represents the mth power of that particular root which , when s= 0 , reduces to 1 .
The law of the series upon which the formation of the differential equation depends is , as we shall perceive , independent of these determinations .
Changing r into r-n , we have m[m ( nl)r -n-"l -t1 -Mr-n ] -----X whence the law of the series is seen to be r -Tx.^+(n-I)r -n1I r^ mA [ rlru+[ [ ] ( Il r1 -y -1)-= , ( .r ... .
( 6 ) and therefore , by what is shown in my memoir " On a General Method in Analysis , " the differential equation defining u will be ED+m+ ( n-1)D_]l ) ^= , * _ value .
In the above example we may write ?

the last term of which becomes a vanishing fraction when m= --1 .
The true limiting form is seen to be u=C , yl-. .
+-Y +C , ( y1 logy. .
+y , I logy ) ... ( 8 ) This is the complete integral of ( I. ) when m= -1 .

The theory of these failing cases may be viewed also in another aspect .
When U.=C Cy+C*.2 ... ... ... ( 9 ) is an integral , but not the general integral of the differential equation ( I ) , it must be the general integral of a differential equation involved in ( I ) , but of a lower order .
We may in fact conclude that such reduced differential equation will be deducible from the higher one by a process of integration .
Let us apply this consideration to the foregoing example .
When m=--1 , the equation ( I ) becomes D(D-)..*(D-+l ) +[ D-l ] ( D-n+1)e0u=-0 .
Hence operating on both members with ( D-n+ 1 ) ' , we have D(D-1)..(D-n+2)+l [ D-u- ] e6= Ce It must then be possible to determine C so as to cause this differential equation to be satisfied by ( 9 ) .
First let us seek to determine C so as to cause the equation to admit of any of the particular integrals yr , y2. .
y. Substituting for u the Lagrangian expansion reduced by making m=-1 , and giving to b any of the particular values included in the form 1 , we shall , on equating coefficients , find whence it appears that if n be greater than 2 , 0=0 .
Thus the reduced differential equation becomes [ D ] +l[1 D1 ] " e ?
6=u ; 0 ... . .
( 10 ) and this , when n is greater than 2 , is satisfied by which in effect contains n1 arbitrary constants , and so constitutes the complete integral of the differential equation .
If n=2 , the differential equation becomes -+(D-|)=l 20Z .
" ... ... .
( 11 ) .
U"TaP-~-/ U V-2 ) e which is satisfied by u=y1 ' and by u=y ` , y but , as is evident from its unhomogeneous form , not by u=C-y , y-+C2y ; - .
ln this case , in fact , the condition y1+y1--=O not being fulfilled , the primary differential equation ( I ) suffers no change in the form of its general solution .
Mr. HARLEY'S results are in effect transformations of ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) .
Since u=y\ ' , it is seen that u will satisfy the algebraic equation f+xUz-1 =0 .
Transform this by assuming 1-n 1-n 11= -n(1-n_z ) nx5 u=(1-n)nx'n n ' , and we have U. " -m+ ( nI1)x'=0 , which is Mr. HARLEY'S algebraic equation in form .
Hence , if '=e0 ' and D'=9 , , we shall have I-f 1 , 1-1 eo= ?

And ( 10 ) will become [ fDI]f -n ' n+_-D'- !

When n=2 , we obtain from ( 11 ) , by the same transformations , Mr. HARLEY'S second equation ( 2 ) , art .

Not only for the particular value m=-1 , but apparently for all integer values of nm , the general differential equation ( I ) admits of one integration .
It may be said that while the differential equation determining the form of the mth power of a root of the algebraic equation is in general of the nth order , this equation may , when m is an integer , be reduced to an ' equation of the n-lth order ; not , however , like the higher equation , unvarying in its type .
I have thus verified some other particular forms obtained by Mr. HARLEY .

On account of the difficulty of the investigation , I propose to employ two distinct methods leading to coincident results .

This law we can extend symbolically to expressions in which D appears , provided that , in the application of the symbolic forms thence arising , D shall admit of an interpretation which shall effectively make the subjects of the symbol F to be positive numerical magnitudes .

For iz=0 these conditions are inconsistent , and the proposed employment of r therefore unlawful .
For values of i greater than 0 the conditions will be found to amount to this , viz. that mn must lie between the limits -(n-1 ) and 1 .
We shall suppose m thus conditioned , and shall consider first the case in which i &gt; 0 .

This theory I shall apply here , not to the ordinary finite solution , but to the solution by definite integrals of the differential equation ( I ) .
In doing this I shall give to U and V the particular values 0 .
We are justified in doing this by the canons relating to the arbitrary constants which are laid down in the memoir ; but it will suffice here to direct attention to the fact that while the processes employed are strictly speaking particular , ,they lead to a solution involving the requisite number of arbitrary constants , and at the same time of the properform , as manifested by the succession of the indices in its development .

, Now , expanding the logarithm in the integrated portion , and putting for V its value 1_ + , we see that that portion will consist of a series of terms of the form Avm+(n-l)r ( 1 n)r r being for each such term a positive integer .
All these terms vanish when v=0 , since , by the conditions to which m is subject , m+(n -1)r is positive .
Again , they vanish when v is made infinite , since in this case ( 1 + un ) and , by the conditions relative to nt , the index m-r is negative .
We have , then , on applying the above reduction to the terms of the general value of yi , Y 1+ , V-{ J.1 1T-ve J1Oi 1-_dv '_ vMYdv } r=i , hy ai+ ^ { 8en *s J.d in in - , *ic j. ths4a Now substitute for the imaginary exponentials their trigonometrical value , and there results ?

If ym represent the mth power of that real root of the equation yX -l:=0 which reduces to 1 when x=O , then , su , pposing m to be between the limits 1 and -n+l , the value of ym will be ( sin m -V sin -v dv.l+.(IV ) 0 1-2Vcosx+V2 n in which 1 + un 10 .
Hence too we have the value of a remarkable definite integral , viz. ( sin. r-1 r sn ml\ dV mdv Csin { sr r-Vs sin v dv nn dv 1\ n on-dv ; ={r(y 1 ) ... .

It may be desirable to verify this result .

2 , equal to Sir in the expansion of ym in ascending powers of x. Hence , the lowest value of r in the expansion of the definite integral being unity , we see that the value of that integral will be expressed by r(ym- ) , as was to be shown .
It will be observed that the function under the sign of definite integration does not become infinite within the limits .
Ordinary methods of approximation might therefore be applied .
I apprehend , however , that it is not in this direction that , the value of such results is to be sought .
