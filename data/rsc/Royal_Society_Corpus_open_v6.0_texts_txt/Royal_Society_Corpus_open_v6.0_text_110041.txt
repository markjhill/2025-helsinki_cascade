] The gases which the author has succeeded in condensing into the liquid form , are , the sulphurous acid , sulphuretted hydrogen , carbonic acid , euchlorine , nitrous oxide , cyanogen , ammonia , muriatic acid , and chlorine .
The process by which they were condensed , consisted in liberating them from certain of their compounds in small glass tubes , hermetically sealed and bent , so that when required , the end might answier the purpose of a receiver , and be occasionally immersed in ice or freezing mixtures .
They generally appear as exceedingly limpid , colourless , and mobile fluids , and assume the gaseous form with various degrees of rapidity and violence upon the removal of that pressure by which they had been previously restrained .
In this paper Mr. Faraday details the particular method to which he resorted for obtaining each of these liquid bodies , and describes such of their characters as his experiments have hitherto enabled hiin to determine .
Liquid sulphurous acid appears to exert a pressure of about 2 atmospheres , at 45 ? .
The pressure of the vapour of sulphuretted hydrogen was equal to about 13 atmospheres , at 32 ?
; that of carbonic acid to 40 atmospheres , at 450 ; of nitrous oxide 48 atmospheres , at 50 ?
; of cyanogen between 3 and 4 atmospheres , at 450 ; of muriatic acid 28 atmospheres , at 32 ? .
The author 's attempts to obtain hydrogen , oxygen , fluoric , fluosilicic , and phosphuretted hydrogen gases in the form of liquids , have hitherto been without success .
