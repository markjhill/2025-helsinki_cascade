Ill. " A Second Memoir on Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls .
" By A. CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received April 29 , 1864 .
( Abstract .
) The principal object of the present memoir is to establish the different kIinds of skew surfaces of the fourth order , or Quartic Scrolls ; but , as preliminary thereto , there are some general researches connected with those in my former memoir " On11 Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls " ( Phil. Trans. vol. 153 .
1863 , pp. 453 , 483 ) , and I also reproduce the theory ( which may be considered as a known one ) of cubic scrolls ; there are also some concluding remarks which relate to the general theory .
As regards quartic scrolls , I remark that M. Chasles , in a footnote to his paper , " Description des Courbes de tous les ordres situees sir les surfaces reglees du troisieme et du quatriemc ordres , " Comptes Rendus , t. liii .
( 1861 ) , see p. 888 , states , " 'les surfaces reglees du quatrieme ordre ... .
admettent quatorze especes .
" This does not agree with my results , silnce I find only eight species of quartic scrolls ; the developable surface or " torse " is perhaps included as a " surface reglle ; e " but as there is only one species of quartic torse , the deficiency is not to be thus accounted for .
My enumeration appears to me complete , but it is possible that there are subforms which M. Chasles has reckopied as distiniet species .
