Received Iarch 8 , 1893 .
The following experiments were carried out in the Siemens tory , King 's , London , and are a cootinuation of experiments by J. Hopkinson and B. Hopkinson , a description of which appeared in the Electl.ician , ' September 9 , 1892 .
In that paper determinations were given of curves showing the relation between the induction and the netising force , for of time wire of soft iron and steel , through complete cycles with varying amplitudes of netising force , both with the ordinary ballistic method and with alternating currents of a frequency up to oomplebe periods per second .
It was shown that if the induction was moderate in amount , example , or 4000 , the two curves closely agreed ; , if the induction was considerable , for example , ] curves diffel'ed somewhat , particularly in that part of curve preceding the maximum induction .
The difference was greater with steel than with soft iron .
It was not then determined whether this diffel.ence was a true time effect or was in some way due to the ballistic galvanometer .
The resent paper is addressed to .
this point .
The ring to which the experiments refer is of hard steel containing about per cent. of cal.bon , in the form of wire in .

The material was supplied by Messrs. Richard Johnson .
The ring is about 9 cm .

The resistance was so adjusted that the maximum current in the primary circuit was such as to give the desired maximum magnetising force on the ring .
In taking the kicks the ballistic galvanometer the method adopted was as follows:\mdash ; Having closed the imary by means of the switch was suddenly opened , thus allowing the magmetising force to drop to an amount determined by , and the kick observed .
A total reversal was then taken with , and the kick again observed .
The closing of again brought up the magnetising force to its maximum in the opposite direction to that at starting .
In a letter to the editor of the ' Electrician , ' Sepbember 16 , 1892 , Mr. Evershed stated that " " Had the cycle beon obtained by the method descl'ibed by Mr. Vignole Messrs. Hopkinson would have found it in almost absolute reement with the quick cycle curve To settle this point the static curve of hysteresis was ined b the ballistic galvanometer , the connexions made according to the diagram in fig. 2 .

[ Apr. 20 , wire ring , is the ballistic galvanometer , is a reversing switch , and a small switch for the purpose of short-circuiting the adjustable resistance .
The difference between this diagram and that in fig. 1 is that can be suddenly inserted into the primary circuib by one stroke of the reversing switch .
In this way it is possible to vary the magnetising force from one maximum through zero to any desired point within the other maximum by one motion of the switch : which operation takes but a small fraction of a second to perform .
In fig. 3 the points marked were obtained by the mebhod in fig. 1 ; the points marked .
being obtained by the method in fig. 2 .
Table I gives the values for and , from which these points have 1893 .
] Magnetic 355 been plotted , and their close agreement proves that the difference found between the static and quick cycle curves is not due to the cause suggested by Mr. Evershed .
In each case the battery used had a potential difference of 108 volts , the periodic time of the ballistic needle being 10 seconds .
It was observed , when taking the hysteresis curve by the method in fig. 2 , that the sum of the inductions found by varying the magnetising force from one maximum to an intermediate point , and from that point to the other maximum , did not exactly equal the induction got by varying the magnetising force direct from one maximum to the other .
To investigate this with the ballistic galvanometer the magnetising force ( fig. ) was taken from one maximum through zero to the point by one motion of the sing switch handle , and the galvanometer circuit closed at known intervals of time after such change , the deflection being noted .
This deflecbion does not represent an impulsive electromotive force , nor yet a constant current , but is caused by a current through the galvanometer diminishing in amount somewhat rapidly .
It might arise from the comparatively slow rate at which the magnetising current changes , owing to the self-induction of the circuit , or it might arise from a finite time required to develop the induction corresponding to a given magnetising force .
The former would be readily calculable if ring had a definite self-induction ; in our case it is approximately calculable .
Let be resistance of primary circuit , the applied electromotive force , the cul.rent , and I the total induction multiplied by the number of primary turns .
Now I is known in terms of for conditions of experiment very approximately , and roughly has a constant ratio to \mdash ; is equal , say , to ; hence the well known equation .
From our curves we see that induction per sq .
cm .
increases 10,000 , whilst magnetising force increases 4 .
Total induction multiphed by the primary turns , taking the volt as our unit , increases , whilst the current an ampere , i. e. , 356 Dr. Hopkinson and Messrs. Wilson and Lydall .
[ Apr. 20 , In the experiments made and 108 volts and and ohms , whence and 5 In either case does not differ sensibly from its final value when second .
Hence the self-induction of the circuit can have to do with the residual effects observed .
These experiments showed that an eifect was upon the galvanometer needle , appreciable for some seconds , the effect being somewhat more marked with 4 than with 108 volts .
But the whole amount was so small as to be less than 1 per cent. of the total change of induction ; from which we that no material difference exists between curves of induction determined by the ballistic galvanometer and the inductions caused by magnetising forces operating for many seconds .
Effect of the Specimen.\mdash ; Having taken the netising force from its maximum through zero to the point as before , the effect of tapping was marked , especiaJly in the case of soft iron , when a kick correspondin to an acquirement of lines of induction psr sq .

was observed .
The following experiments on the hard steel wire were carried out with the alternator , the object being to ascertain if a time effect on netism exists .
The ballistic curve ( fig. 3 ) has been taken as a standard with which to the spective hysteresis .
In each case the maximum magnetising force has been made as nearly as possible to agree with that used when king the ballistic curve , and the method of test was that employed in the ' Elect , ician ' paper .
For the sake of completeness the diagram , fig. 4 , and descripbion given over Quoting from that paper , we have : " " For .

was connected in series with a noninductive resistance to the poles of an alternate current generator , or transformer excited by the ator , thus : FIG. 4 .
1893 .
] Magnetic Viscosity .
357 in which are the poles of the transformer or generator ; the terminals of the non-inductive resistance the coil the ring ; and the studs of a reversing key connected to the quadrant of a Thomson quadrant electrometer ; a key by means of which could be connected with or at will ; and a revolving contact maker , through which was connected to D. A condenser was connected to and order to steady the electrometer readings .
The contact maker was bolted on to the axle of the generator .
It consists of a circular disc of ebonite , about 13 in .
diameter , having a small slip of copper , about in .
wide , let into its circumference .
A small steel brush presses on the circumference , and makes contact with the piece of copper once in every revolution .
The position of the brush can be read ofl on a graduated circle .
The quadrant electrometer thus gives the instantaneous value of the difference of potential between the points and , or the points and according to the direction of the key equencies of 5 , 72 , per second have been tried , two values being given to the potential difference at the terminals of ths alternator in each of the frequencies 72 and 125 , making in a115 complete experiments .
The curves so obtained are given in figs. 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 ively .
From observations of the values of the electromotive force between and ( fig. 4 ) at diflerent times in the period , a curve in each meant ) was plotted , giving the magnetising force in terms of the time ; a similar curve was plotted for the electromotive force between and Fi , which , when corrected by subtracting the electromotive force dne to the resistance of the coil , gives the potential or time rate of riation of the induction in terms of the time .
Hence the area of this curve ( B ) up to any point , plus a ant , is proportional to the induction corresponding to that point .
This is shown in curve , which is the integral of B. In each of the five experiments the ring with the non-inducti esistance was placed across the terminals of the alternator , and the excess of potential taken up by a non-inductive resistance .
In fig. 5 the hysteresis curves for frequencies of 5 , 72 , and 125 are compared with the ballistic curve .
These curves marked 5 , , and respectively .
The corresponding values for and from which these curves have been plotted , al.e given in Tables II , III , , which have been obtained from the curves in figs. 8 , 9 , and 11 respectively .
The most noteworthy features in these curves are that the curve with a frequency of 5 is very near the ballistic , if allowance is made for difference in the magnetising current , and that the corves with a frequency of 72 and 125 deviate very materialIy , particularly in the part of the curve somewhat preceding the maximum induction .
Hence the timo eflect mainly develops with a greater frequency than 358 Dr. Hopkinson and Messrs. Wilson and Lydall .
[ Apr. 20 ; 5 per second .
Hence also we infer that this effect , as already described in the 'Electrician , ' is a true time effect , not arising in any way from the ballistic galvanometer .
In fig. 6 the hysteresis curves for a frequency of 72 are compared with the ballistic curve .
The curvss are marked and respectively , the potentials at the terminals the alternator in the two cases being approximately 36 and 430 volts .
The corresponding values for and are given in Tables III , IV , which have been obtained from the curves in figs. 9 and 10 respeciively .
The difference between the two curves in fig. 6 was at first puzzling , but a little consideration satisfied us that it arises from the same time effect .
The curve was determined three times , with the same result .
The numerals refer to thirbieths of a half-period .
From 26 to of the curve the magnetising force increases from to , whilst from 21 to 26 of the curve it increases from 306 to 44 , the rate of change being about double as great in the former case as in the latter , and it is the curve which deviates most from the ballistic curve .
In like manner , in the neighbourhood of zero induction , the induction in the curve is changing twice as fast as the induction of the curve , and it is here the curve which diifers most .
How these differences of rate of change arise can be seen by inspecting figs. 9 and 10 .
In fig. 7 the hysteresis curves for a frequency of 125 are compared with the ballistic curve .
The curves are marked and respectively , the potentials at the terminals of hs alternator being approximately 62 and 750 volts .
The corresponding values for and are given in Tables and , which have besn obtained from the curves in figs. 11 and 12 respectively .
These curves show the same difference as fig. 6 , but less markedly than in fig. 5 .
The curve was det.ermined twice .
Experiments have been made upon chromium steel , supplied by Mr. Hadfield , having the following composition : per cent. carbon , per cent. chromium , when annealed , and when hardened by raising to yellow and plunging into cold water .
The resuIts show that the same tims effect exists in this case , although it was not so marked as in the case of the hard steel .
We draw the following conclusions from these experimsnts : As Professor Ewing has already observed , after sudden change of magnetising force , the induction does not at once attain to its value , but there is a slight increase going on for some seconds .
( 2 .
) The small difference between ballistic cur of magnetisation with complete cycles and the curve determined with a considerable frequency , which has already been observed , is a true time effect , the difference being greater between a frequency of 72 per second and 5 per second than between 5 per second and the ballistic curve .
