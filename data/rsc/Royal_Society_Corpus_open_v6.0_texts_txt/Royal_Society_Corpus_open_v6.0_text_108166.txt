WHEN hydrocyanic acid of considerable strength ( 10 to 20 per cent. ) is agitated with red oxide of mercury in large excess , a white compound is obtained , intermixed with the red oxide , on which cold water has very little action .
If the mixture be collected on the filter and treated with boiling water , the new compound is separated from the excess of oxide , and , as the solution cools , is deposited on the sides of the vessel in the form of a white incrustation , adhering strongly , and consisting of an aggregation of colourless transparent four sided acicular prisms .
In favourable circumstances , I have obtained it in such prisms half an inch in length , but not sufficiently perfect to admit of measurement .
This salt is remarkably distinguished from the bicyanide by its sparing solubility in cold water , by the strong alkaline reaction exhibited by its solution , and by its relations to heat .
Heated gently in the air , it blackens slightly and then explodes with little noise , but if it be heated in larger quantity ( 5 to 10 grs. ) , and in a close tube , it explodes with a loud detonation , and shivers the tube into firagments .
It does not explode under the blow of a hammer .
Burned with bichromate of potash or oxide of copper it gives off a gas which consists of nitrogen and carbonic acid , in the proportion of one volume to two .

The formation of this new salt therefore is not due to any decomposition of the cyanogen .
Dissolved in dilute muriatic acid and gently heated , it emits the odour of prussic acid .
If sulphuretted hydrogen be passed through the solution in water , a pirecipitate , at first white and afterwards becoming black , is thrown down .
To the solution filtered and heated to drive off the excess of hydrosulphuric acid , sulphate of iron .
and afterwards caustic potash were added , when a precipitate of Prussian blue fell .
The salt therefore contains Cyanogen , since its solution when decomposed by hydrosslphuric and hydrochloric acid gives hydrocyanic acid .
2 .
Its alkaline reaction indicates an excess of mercury .
3 .
That this excess is in the state of oxide is shown by the detonating property of the salt , the sudden decomposition being due to the action of the oxygen on a portion of the carbon of the cyanogen .
Heated to incipient decomposition the salt loses no weight , it is therefore anhydrous .
29*275 grains dissolved in hydrochloric and precipitated by hydrosulphuric acid gave 29*245 grains of bisulphuret of mercury = 86*191 grains of metallic mercury per cent. 29'27 grains gave 29'15 grains bisulphuret = 85'933 Hg per cent. 34'93 grains gave 34'68 grains bisulphuret = 85'674 Hg per cent. The last result , as we shall see , is nearest the truth .
Burned with oxide of copper , 63'55 grains gave C1 11'96 = 5203 carbon per cent. H= 0'60 43'94 grains gave C= 8'00 = 5'034 carbon per cent. The small quantity of water obtained in the first analysis was obviously accidental , and therefore the water was neglected in the second .
And since the nitrogen is to the carbon , as already shown , in the proportion of one volume or atom to trwo , 5*203 carbon , the result of the two very approximate ones , which should be nearest the truth , indicates 6'025 of nitrogen , since , 152'875 : 177'036 5*203 : 6025 .
Therefore the salt consists by analysis of Carbon ... = 5203 Nitrogen ... .
= 6'025 Mercury ... = 85*674 Oxygen ... =3'098 100 This composition agrees with the formula ( Hg Cy2 + Hg 02 ) per cent. calculated .
4 carbon -= 305'750 = 5'162 2 nitrogen = 354'072 = 5'977 2 mercury = 5063'288 = 85'483 2 oxygen = 200'000 = 3378 5923 110 100 This salt exhibits many very interesting reactions .
which gives per cent. by experiment .
5'203 6-025 85-674 3'098 100 114 Heated over a lamp , under water , it becomes yellow , and a portion of a yellow powder ( Hg Cy ?
) ultimately remains undissolved , mixed with protoxide and a little metallic mercury ; that is , a portion of it is decomposed , probably according to the following formula ( HgCy2+ HgO2 ) +3 HO = HgCy + HgO + ( NH3 2C 02 ) the reduction of the mercury being the consequence of a second reaction .
2 .
Caustic ammonia throws down from a cold solution of this salt , a copious and bulky white precipitate ; from a hot solution , the precipitate is slightly yellowish .
The supernatant liquid , on evaporation , gives pure bicyanide of mercury .
The precipitate when dried at 212 ?
FAHR. and heated in a close tube over a lamp , gives off ammonia , water , and metallic mercury .
It is probably the same compound which is obtained by digesting red oxide of mercury in caustic ammonia , and which is supposed to be represented by one or other of the formule ( 3 Hg +4 NH3 +8 H ) or ( Hg +2 Hg +2N H2 + 12 H ) .
3 .
A solution of sal ammoniac throws down a yellow precipitate , the supernatant liquid having a strong alkaline reaction .
On heating , the precipitate is redissolved , ammonia is given off , and the alkaline reaction disappears .
The direct action here is the change of the binoxide into bichloride and the liberation of ammonia , according to the formula ( Hg Cy2 + Hg 02 ) +2N H4 C1 = Hg Cy2 + Hg C12 +2NH 0 .
The white precipitate is a secondary result , due to the action of the free ammonia ( as above mentioned ) , and which consequently disappears when the ammonia is driven off by heat .
In this case , however , since bichloride is present , the white precipitate will not be the same as is produced by the action of ammonia on the new salt ( 2 .
) , but may consist in part or in whole of the long-known hydrargyrum precipitatum album , the true composition of which ( Hg C12 + Hg +2N H112 ) has been recently established by Dr. KANE .
This reaction is represented by the formula 2 Hg CI2 +4N H3 = ( Hg C12 + Hg +2N H2 ) +2N H4 ClI .

The fixed alkaline chlorides render the solution of the new salt milky , and throw down a small quantity of a white precipitate , the liquid becoming more strongly alkaline .
In this case also , the chloride gives up its chlorine to the mercury , and the free alkali causes the increased causticity of the solution .
The milkiness I attribute to the presence in small quantity either of ammonia , or of some neutral salt ( formiate ?
) of mercury , the decomposition of which by the alkaline chloride causes the formation of an equivalent portion of calomel .
It is known how readily formic acid and ammonia are produced at the expense of cyanogen , when water is present* , and it would appear that the action of heat upon this new double salt in water very frequently gives rise to these products .
In treating with boiling water the mixture of oxide of mercury and this salt , ( which is produced on digesting prussic acid with the latter in excess , ) in order to obtain the salt in solution , copious bubbles of gas are evolved , the smell of ammonia becomes perceptible , and mu-ch metallic mercury is precipitated* .
On concentrating the solutions also , decomposition takes place , with deposition of metallic mercury ; and when the crystallized salt is dissolved in boiling water , a black sediment in greater or less quantity is generally observable .
In the solution therefore when cold , the presence either of a trace of a formiate or of any ammoniacal salt would account for the slight deposit which occurs when chloride of potassium is added to it .
When chloride of magnesium is employed , the milkiness is more speedy and mor'e distinct , a light bulky hydrate of magnesia being thrown down , as is to be expected , when we consider that on parting with its chlorine the nlagnesium is oxidized , and set at liberty in a liquid which can retain very little of it in solution .
If the salt be added in successive quantities to a concentrated boiling solution of chloride of potassium , it is largely dissolved , and on cooling , the beautiful pearly scales of the compound of bicyanide of mercury with chloride of potassium fall down .
The supernatant liquid contains bichloride of mercury and caustic potash .
A solution of iodide of potassium produces analogous compounds and reactions , as does also a solution of cyanide of potassium .
5 .
The solution of this new salt ( oxycyanide ) , as has been already stated , has a strong alkaline reaction .
If it be added to a very dilute solution of nitric acid till the solution ceases to redden litmus , it will be found to dissolve with great ease and in large quantity .
The solution by careful evaporation gives long , delicate , transparent , colourless , quadrangular prisms , or hexagonal plates and pearly scales , and crystallizes to the last drop .
At 212 ?
FAHR. these crystals lose nothing , and therefore contain no water .
Over the lanp in the open air they decompose with a flash of white light , giving off metallic mercury , and leaving a yellow residue .
In a close tube they are decomposed with a slight detonation , and with the emission of red fumes .
38'334 grains of the oxycyanide , cautiously treated in this way , gave beautiful crystals , weighing 40'53 grains , equal to an increase of 5'728 per cent. The new compound therefore consists of Calculated .
Found .
One equivalent of oxycyanide ( Hg Cy2 + Hg 02 ) .
= 59'23 94'285 94'272 One half equivalent of nitric acid , 2N 0 ... = 3'38 5'715 5-728 62'61 100 100 This salt is readily soluble in water .
What is chiefly interesting in regard to its constitution and properties is , that the alkaline reaction of th te oxycyanide should be fully destroyed by so small a quantity of nitric acid .
This fact would seem to show , that the bicyanide of mercury , and consequently other compounds of the same class , do really possess something of the characters of the true acids , having the power , if not of completely neutralizing a metallic oxide , at least of so far modifying its basic character as materially to weaken its neutralizing action on the oxygen acid .
6 .
This is further illustrated by the action of acetic acid on the oxycyanide .
A weak solution of this acid dissolves it in large quantity , and if carefully saturated , the solution gives , on evaporation , a white salt having the odour of acetic acid , which loses nothing at 220 ?
FAHR. , bult when heated in a close tube , blackens and gives off cyanogen , metallic mercury , and a strong odour of acetic acid .
In preparing this salt , it is difficult so perfectly to neutralize the acetic acid , that , during the evaporation* , any excess that maybe present should not , as it becomes concentrated , decompose some of the bicyanide which the solution contains .
On the following results , therefore , I do not place much reliance , though they serve to show by how small a quantity of this acid the oxycyanide may be perfectly neutralized .
Increase .
49 grains of oxycyanide gave 49'94 of the new salt = 1'918 per cent. 34*567 grains of oxycyanide gave 35'36 of the new salt = 2*294 per cent. 54'00 grains of oxycyanide gave 54'92 of the new salt = 1'704 per cent. Taking the atom of acetic acid at 623 , these results indicate the addition of onesixth of an equivalent of this acid to each equivalent of the oxycyanide , or that the new compound is ( Hg Cy2 + Hg O2 + A ) .
Thus we have Calculated per cent. Found per cent. One equivalent of the oxycyanide = 5923 = 98'23 98'296 One-sixth equivalent of acetic acid = 643 107 = 177 1-704 6 6030 100 100 Though this is not a solitary instance in which one of acetic acid combines with six of base , the subacetate of lead ( 6 Pb0+ A ) being an analogous salt , yet I would be understood as representing the constitution above given for this salt as open to future correction .
I have tried also several other organic acids , and have found that with the benzoic and citric acids , soluble and crystallizable salts may be obtained , and with tartaric acid , a compound which , after being crystallized , is decomposed by water into a soluble and an insoluble portion .
Oxalic acid gives a white precipitate , and the filtered solution , on evaporation , two salts ; one in white prisms , the other in yellowish crystals .
I have not subjected any of these compounds to analysis .
7 .
When an acid solution of nitrate of silver is poured into a hot saturated solution of the oxycyanide , a shower of beautiful pure white prismatic crystals falls .
These crystals dissolve readily in hot water and re-crystallize on cooling .
Heated in a close vessel they give off water , become opake , melt , and finally explode , with the beautiful purple flame characteristic of burning cyanogen .
Heated on the Water Bath .
33'125 grains lost 2*63 grains = 7'939 per cent. 31'075 grains lost 2'46 grains = 7'916 per cent. On standing in a moist atmosphere for a few days , the dry salt recovers the whole of its water of crystallization .
The 33*125 grains , after drying as above , were dissolved in water and precipitated by muriatic acid .
The chloride of silver obtained weighed 10'48 grains , = 23'834 per cent. , or 37'533 of nitrate of silver .
This salt therefore is the compound discovered by WOHLER ( Hg Cy2 + Ag 0 .
N 05 +4H 0 ) , and which is composed of Calculated per cent. Found per cent. Bicyanide of mercury , 1 equivalent = 2991'46 53'709 54.540 Nitrate of silver , 1 equivalent .

= 449'92 8-077 7'927 5570-02 100 100 Many of the other interesting reactions of the oxycyanide may be predicted from its constitution , and its use as a reagent will occasionally be valuable to the chernist , from its affording a solution in which binoxide of mercury exists as such , and possessed of alkaline properties .
