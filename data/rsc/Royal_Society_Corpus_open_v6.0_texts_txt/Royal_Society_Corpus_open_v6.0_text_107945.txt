Experiments on the Length of the Seconds Pendulum at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich .
By Captain EDWARD SABINE , of the Royal Regiment of Artillery , F.R.S. Read June 16 , 1831 .
THESE experiments were made with the original convertible pendulum constructed by Captain KATER , and employed by him in 1817 in Portland Place , London .
Prior to its employment in the present experiments I made the following alterations in the pendulum .
1 .
The tail pieces were removed altogether ; coincidences being observed by the bar itself ( the ends being blackened for the purpose ) , and by a disc of corresponding diameter on the pendulum of the clock .
2 .
The " moveable weight " employed by Captain KATER was dispensed with altogether ; and the pendulum rendered convertible , within the limits of more exact adj ustment by the slider , by filing away a small quantity of metal from one extremity of the bar .
By this alteration there remained nothing moveable about the pendulum except the slider ; and that was so placed in these experiments , that a change in its position , of so great magnitude as the tenth of an inch , did not occasion an alteration of so much as the tenth of a second in the daily rate of the pendulum , when suspended with the weight below , which is the position in which the rate is determined .
The slider was clamped to the bar , and was moved by a screw for slow motion , by which it could be adjusted with tolerable precision to the hundredth of an inch .
The graduation on the bar , by which the place of the slider was regulated , was on the side of the bar next the observer , who could thus at all times assure himself that no change occurred in its position by the inversion of the pendulum .
Neither of these alterations interfered with the distance between the knife edges , which was referred in 1817 to Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S scale by Captain KATER , and found to measure 39.44085 inches of that scale at the temperature of 62 ? .
The experiments were made , unless where it is otherwise noticed , in the vacuum apparatus , established in the S.W. angle of the pendulum room in the Royal Observatory , being the place assigned for that apparatus by the Astronomer Royal .
The thermometer , by which the temperature of the pendulum was observed , is the same which I have used and described on former occasions ; particularly in the Phil. Trans. for 1830 , where its comparison is given with a standard thermometer of M. BESSEL'S , at the same temperatures at which it was used in these experiments .
In a paper on the construction and use of the vacuum apparatus , in the Phil. Trans. for 1829 , 1 have shown that when the pressure of the air is withdrawn from the exterior of the bulb of this thermometer , an index correction of + 00.75 is required to make its indications in a highly rarefied medium correspond with its measure of the same temperatures when under the pressure of the atmosphere .
This index correction is consequently applied whenever the air is withdrawn from the apparatus .
The thermometer was enclosed with the pendulum within the glasses , with its bulb suspended midway between the knife edges .
When the air is withdrawn from the apparatus , and the shutters of the apartment are kept closed ( except when light is required for the observation of coincidences ) , a great uniformity as well as steadiness of temperature is maintained within the glasses .
Whenever the indications of the barometer were required , a reference was made to the standard barometer of the observatory , which is stationed in an adjoining room on the same level .
The scale by which the arcs of vibration were observed was graduated in degrees , each degree being the 0.833th of an inch .
In making the observation , the division of the scale coinciding with one side of the bar was noticed at each extremity of the vibration , and the same repeated with the other side of the bar ; a mean was then taken of the two included spaces , and half the mean registered as the arc on either side the vertical .
The scale being placed in both positions of the pendulum 45.5 inches below the point of suspension , the registered arcs multiplied by 1.05 produce the true arcs of vibration ; by employing these in the usual formula for that purpose , what is usually considered as the compensation for the arcs is obtained .
During the progress of the experiments , however , I had occasion to suspect that , particularly when the pendulum was vibrated with the weight above , the retardation of the vibrations , in consequence of their being performed in circular arcs , was greater than the conmsin ( A + a ) .
sin ( A a ) pensations computed by the customary formula N ( l sin Alog .
sina ) To examine this more closely , and to obtain practically a just compensation for the arcs in which the pendulum had been vibrated in the course of its employment , I made several series of experiments distinct from those made to determine the rate , and which I shall proceed to describe in the first instance , though they were not the first in the order of time .

Weight above .
On the 27th of January 1830 , I made the following observations , purposing to compare , under circumstances otherwise similar , the rate of the pendulum in different arcs ; 1st , commencing with 10.32 and ending with 00.73 ; 2nd , commencing with 0 ?
.70 and ending with 00.42 ; and 3rd , commencing with 0 ?
.42 and ending with 0 ?
.19 .
Having withdrawn the air from the apparatus , the resistance to the vibration was so far diminished , that the time which the pendulum took to reduce its arc from 10.32 to 0 ?
.73 , from 0 ?
.70 to 00.42 , and from 0 ?
.42 to 0 ?
.19 , was in each case sufficient to give the rate of the pendulum within the respective arcs with tolerable exactness .
The rate of the clock on this day was taken from its average rate in several days , viz. from the 24th to the 30th of January ; exactness in the daily gain or loss of the clock was not required , as the observations were only to be used in their relation to each other .

To make the results agree , it is necessary to multiply the computed correction by 1.36 .
By the employment of this multiplier , the result obtained in the arcs of least magnitude ( which as being the nearest to infinitely small arcs are presumed to be the most correct , ) is not altered more than five-hundredths of a vibration ; whilst the results obtained in larger arcs 462 are brought in accordance with it .

To obviate that inconvenience I commenced with a series in large arcs ; made then two series in small arcs , and concluded with a second series in large arcs ; and finally took a mean between the two series in large arcs and the two series in small arcs , as the results to be compared with each other .

~ +0.18 86083.39 For a purpose foreign to the present object , the slider was on this day at 1.75 inch from the middle of the pendulum towards the weight .
The irregular going of the clock ( which stopped altogether soon after the fourth series was completed ) may have rendered the result of this day 's experiments of less value than that of either of the preceding days , in determining the amount of the multiplier .
It was not until the 5th of May following , that , the clock being repaired and replaced , I was able to resume the inquiry by the following observations conducted in the same manner as before .
The clock was making 86665.0 vibrations , on an average of several days at this period .

' - ] [ [ [ ] ] [ [ [ [ ]i ] [ , ,1 : ... 466 the multiplier , to be employed in computing the compensations for the arcs in the experiments with the weight above , to be hereafter related , we may infer with probability that we employ a more correct multiplier than either 1.3 or 1.5 .
Now , if either of those numbers were substituted for 1.4 , the effect would be to alter the rate of the pendulum with the weight above , as deduced from the experiments in the succeeding pages , one tenth of a vibration per diem .
To correct the influence of this tenth of a vibration on the convertibility ( the object for which the pendulum is vibrated with the weight above ) , the slider would require to be moved a certain quantity , which would alter the final deduction of the rate , due to the distance between the axes of suspension , less than one hundredth of a second per diem .
In employing 1.4 therefore as a multiplier , any uncertainty in the final result , arising from this cause , is limited in all probability to less than.01 of a second per diem , ? ?

Weight below .
On the 31st of January and 1st of February 1830 , I made the following observations , for the purpose of ascertaining the compensation for the arcs when the weight was below .
The clock , by DENT , was making 86313.3 vibrations .
The clock had been stopped on the 30th of January , and was stopped again on the 1st of February , to alter its pendulum .
The rate was assigned by comparison with the transit clock during the two days it was going .

The difference , however , between the results in large arcs and in small arcs , with the computed corrections applied , is much less than takes place when the pendulum is vibrated with the weight above .
With the weight below , the computed corrections being multiplied by 1.13 , the results are rendered accordant with each other on both days of experiment , and the vibrations become as follows : January 31st , large arcs , Exp. II .

The alteration produced by the employment of this multiplier , in the final deduction of the rate of the pendulum from the experiments to be subsequently narrated , is an addition of 0.12 vibration per diem to the number of vibrations which would otherwise have been derived .
I should have been glad to have employed a greater number of observations in the more assured determination of this multiplier , but circumstances did not permit me to pursue the inquiry further ; and I have only now to refer to the consistency and concurrent indication of those results that were obtained , as an evidence that the multiplier derived from them is in all probability very near the truth .
I may also notice , that a change of one unit in the second figure of decimals of this multiplier , would produce an alteration of something less than one hundredth of a second per diem in the rate of the pendulum , derived from the experiments which form the subject of this paper .
It was my intention to have investigated experimentally the cause of the retardation being greater in large arcs than accords with the formula of reduction 469 to infinitely small arcs ; but circumstances not permitting me to do so at present , I have only to state my conjecture , that it is caused by the gliding of the knife edges on the planes , a consequence of the elasticity of the planes .
It has been found by M. BESSEL , that small movements of this kind always took place in a pendulum vibrating on a knife edge , whatever might be the nature of the supporting planes ; that its direction was the same as the motion of the pendulum , to the right when the pendulum moved to the right , and vice versa ' ; and that its amount was proportioned to the arcs of vibration .
Supposing that the cause is as I have conjectured , it would have been satisfactory to have measured the amount of the gliding corresponding to particular arcs , directly , in the manner that M. BESSEL has done , and to have compared the correction of the length , which is the mode of compensation adopted by M. BESSEL , with the correction of the rate , which is the method that has been adopted here ; by either mode the experiments ought to give the same length for the seconds pendulum .
In discussing the correction for the arcs of vibration , it has appeared the most satisfactory course , to introduce the detail of the experiments relating to that branch of the subject into the body of the discussion itself .
In the remainder of the paper I shall pursue the more usual course , of placing together , at the close , the detail of all the experiments , in the order and succession in which they were made ; introducing into the discussion , abstracts and results , with proper references to the part of the paper containing the details .
Before we enter on the examination of the rate of the pendulum , it is necessary to ascertain the reduction to a vacuum for the small residue of air which cannot be pumped out of the apparatus , as well as for the small additional quantity which occasionally leaks in .
I proceed to collect in one view the results of the experiments which were made at suitable opportunities to determine the amount of this reduction .
Reduction to a Vacuum . ? ?

Weight above .
The plan of experiment was to compare the vibrations made in full atmospheric pressure , with those in the exhausted apparatus , in circumstances in other respects as nearly similar as possible .
By this comparison , the correction for nearly the full atmospheric pressure is ascertained ; the proportional part of which is taken as the equivalent for the small residue of air which cannot be wholly withdrawn , and for the occasional small leakage of the apparatus during the experiments ; the pressure withinside the glasses being duly observed and registered by means of a syphon gauge placed by the pendulum .
In regarding the correction for the last remaining inch of pressure as a proportional part , namely the thirtieth , of the correction for the whole atmosphere , I refer to the experiments related in a former paper in the Philosophical Transactions , in which it was shown that the corrections for a half atmosphere , and for a quarter atmosphere , bore corresponding proportions to the correction for the full atmosphere .

From these three series we have the following differences ; viz. 10.99 vibr .

11.55 28.246 -at 57.5 ; or 12.26 11.56 ---28.373 at 57.7 ; or 12.22 Whence we obtain the reduction when the weight is below , in the proportion of 12.10 vibrations per diem for 30 inches of air at 57 ?
.4 .
The mean pressure within the glasses during the fourteen experiments with the weight below , ( from which , as will be seen hereafter , the rate of the pendulum was finally derived , ) was 1.07 inch : the reduction for which , according to the proportion found above , is 0.43 of a vibration per diem .
" This amount would be altered only one hundredth of a vibration , were the partial result most distant from the mean substituted for the mean of the three results by which the reduction was determined .
If , now , we take a mean of the results in both positions of the pendulum a and b , and in both positions of the slider I. &amp; II .
, we have 86069.38 vibrations with the weight above , and 86069.07 vibrations with the weight below , corresponding to the slider at 1.6 inch ( being the mean between 1.633 and 1.566 ) from the middle of the pendulum towards the weight .
The vibrations with the weight above are in excess 0.31 of a vibration .
To ascertain the fraction of the tenth of an inch which it would be necessary to move the slider in order to produce perfect convertibility , and the effect of such change in the position of the slider , upon the vibrations with the weight below , we have from the experiments the following data ( the letters referring as before to the detail of the experiments at the close of the paper ) .

Whence we obtain by proportion 1.637 as the position of the slider which renders the pendulum perfectly convertible : and the vibrations , in the position of perfect convertibility , 86069.09 with the weight above , and 86069.10( with the weight below ; -a result which , it will be seen , is in the closest accordance with the experiments H to S , during which the slider was at 1.633 .
Expansion of the Pendulum .
The rate of the pendulum having thus been found for the temperature of 57 ?
, we have to seek its rate at 62 ?
, being the temperature at which Captain KATER referred the distance between the knife edges to Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S scale .
To obtain the alteration of rate corresponding to each degree of FAHRENHEIT from the data furnished by the experiments , we have the rate with the weight below , observed on the 31st of January and 1st of February at 30 ?
, pp. 467 and 469 , to compare with the rate at 57 ?
which has been deduced as above from the experiments in the preceding August and September .
The position of the slider in the winter experiments was at 1.6 ; consequently the result is strictly comparable with the mean of the two results H to M , and W to EE , made in summer , in one of which series the slider was at 1.633 , and in the other at 1.566 , the mean of which is 1.6 .
But in fact a small change of position of the slider when the weight is below , has so little influence on the rate , that had there been even a slight difference it might have been safely disregarded for the purpose now in view .

I have reported the results of a similar comparison of the rates of an invariable pendulum , made also of plate brass , in winter and in summer ; by which it was shown that a degree of FAHRENHEIT corresponded to a change of 0.44 in the rate of that pendulum also .
These two results are strongly confirmatory of each other .
It results , then , that the vibrations of Captain KATER'S pendulum , which at 57 ?
have been found 86069.10 , are 86066.90 at 62 ? .
The distance between the knife edges as measured by Captain KATER is 39.44085 inches of Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S scale , the pendulum and scale being at 62 ? .
The vibrations in a vacuum corresponding to this distance are 86066.90 , the temperature of the pendulum being 62 ? .

fIi"IvIqcI 475 Stability of the support of the Pendulum in the preceding experiments .
Being desirous of assuring myself of the stability of the support of the pendulum in the vacuum apparatus , I undertook a distinct series of experiments to obtain the rate of the pendulum on the iron fiame , which is permanently affixed to the south wall of the pendulum room in the Royal Observatory , and designed for the use of observers with invariable pendulums , who wish to obtain a basis for their experiments on the variation of gravity at other stations .
With this intention , I transferred the agate planes , which had been employed in the experiments in the vacuum apparatus , to the iron frame ; and placed the pendulum on them , with the weight below , and the slider at 1.6 inch , making the observations H I-I to RR as detailed at the close of this paper .
The experiments were necessarily made in the free air of the apartment , and are reduced to a vacuum by the reduction already found for the pendulum with the weight below .
The rate of the clock , by GRAHAM , which is attached to the wall of the room beneath the iron frame , was furnished me by Mr. THOMAS GLANVILLE TAYLOR , in a memorandum which is subjoined to the detail of the observations .
By a mean of the ten experiments II II to RR on the iron frame , the pendulum was found to make 86070.98 vibrations at 53 ?
reduced to a vacuum .
The equivalent at 57 ?
is 86069.20 , which differs by only 0.10 of a vibration per diem from 86069.10 , the rate ascertained in the vacuum apparatus .
The rate on the iron firame was obtained by thirty-three hours ' vibration of the pendulum ; that in the vacuum apparatus by 173 hours .
So near an approximation , obtained in less than one fifth of the time that the experiments in the vacuum apparatus were continued , satisfied me that no permanent cause of difference existed , and that it only required that the experiments on the iron frame should be persevered in for the same length of time as those were in the vacuum apparatus , to produce the closest accordance .
We may regard therefore the result of the experiments HH to R R , as establishing the equal stability of both supports ; and as affording a fair inference that both supports are perfectly stable .
