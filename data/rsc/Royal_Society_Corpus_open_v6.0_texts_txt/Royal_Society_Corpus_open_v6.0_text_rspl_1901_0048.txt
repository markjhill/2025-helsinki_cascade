Variation in attain their maxima values in 1839 and 1873 , and those of the westerly winds in April in 1837 and 1869 .
As the secular variations of the sunspots have their maxima in 1837*2 and 1870*8 , the agreement is in close accord .
There seems little doubt that , during the interval of time covered by the present investigation , the meteorological phenomena , number of aurorae , and magnetic storms , show secular variations of a period of about thirty-five years , the epochs of which harmonise with those of the secular variation of sunspots .
As we are now approaching another maximum of sunspots which should correspond with that of 1870*8 , it will be interesting to observe whether all the solar , meteorological , and magnetic phenomena of that period will be repeated .
Conclusion .
1 .
There is an alternate increase and decrease in the length of a sunspot period reckoning from minimum to minimum .
2 .
The epoch of maximum varies regularly with respect to the preceding minimum . . . .
, The amplitude of this variation about the mean position is about + 0*8 year .
The cycle of this variation is about thirty-five years .
3 .
The total spotted area included between any two consecutive minima varies regularly .
The cycle of this variation is about thirty-five years .
4 .
There is no indication of the fifty-five-year period as suggested by Dr. Wolf . . . .
5 .
The climate variations indicated by Professor Bruckner are generally in accordance with the thirty-five-year period .
6 .
The frequency of aurorae and magnetic storms since 1833 show indications of a secular period of thirty-five years .
" On the Variation in Gradation of a Developed Photographic Image when impressed by Monochromatic Light of Different Wave-lengths .

Introductory .
When a series of small spaces on a photographic plate are exposed to a constant light for geometrically increasing times , or for a constant time to geometrically increasing intensity of illuminat..on , the spaces so exposed will on development show deposits of silver of differen Gradation of a Developed Photographic Image .
opacities .
These opacities may be measured and noted as " transparencies , " " opacities , " or " densities , " the last being the - log transparencies and the opacity--------------- .
( These definitions of transparency opacity and density are those given by Hurter and Driffield , and are generally understood as such in photographic literature .
) Where varying time exposures are given , it is convenient to start with some unit of time , such as 10 seconds for the exposure of the first small space on a plate , to double this exposure for the next small space , and so on .
When the measurements of transparency or density are made , and the curve has to be plotted , the scale for the abscissa is conveniently the number of the exposure\#151 ; that is , the time of exposure in powers of two .
The ordinates are then set up as transparency of deposit , total transparency being 100 , or as densities which give the absolute light cut off in terms of common logarithms .
The curve joining these different ordinates is in both cases approximately a straight line for some distance , and , at each end , tends to become parallel to the scale of abscissae , and this straight portion is taken as representing the gradation of the plate .
If the same plate be thus exposed to different monochromatic lights , and the images developed together and the density measured , it is easily seen from the plotted curves if the " gradation " of the plate is the same in each case , since , if they are , the straight portions of each curve should be parallel .
[ It may be noted that the less steep the gradation of a plate , the greater will be the extremes of lights and shades in an object or view that will be shown in a print , as the blackest tone obtainable on it reflects about 3 per cent , of light .
For this reason in sun-lighted views , a plate showing a flat gradation should be employed , whilst in those illuminated by a cloudy sky , a plate giving a steep gradation should be used .
] When obtaining the three negatives for three-colour printing where the object is photographed through an orange , a bluish green , and a blue screen , if there is much change in gradation caused by the difference in the colour of the light reaching the plate , the true render-ing of an object in its natural colours becomes an operation of extreme difficulty .
It was with a view to ascertain if some of the difficulties which have been encountered in this process were due to difference in gradation caused by the different coloured screens , that this research was commenced some three years ago .
Nearly two years ago , in an article in ' Photography/ I indicated that a variation in gradation due to difference in the monochromatic light in which the exposure was made did exist , and some six months ago Mr. Chapman Jones , in a paper communicated to the Koval Photographic Society , independently announced the same result from experiments made principally with orthochromatic plates with light passing through various coloured 302 Sir W. de W. Abney .
On Variation in media , and he generalised from his experiments , that the smaller the wave-length , the less steep was the gradation , the ultra-violet rays giving the least steep , and the red the most steep gradation .
My experiments , which had at that time been partially completed did not bear out this generalisation to the full when pure silver salts were used : and my subsequent measurements with them show that the least steep gradation is that given by the monochromatic light to which the simple silver salt experimented with is most sensitive , an that the gradation becomes steeper as the wave-lengths of light employed depart in either direction in the spectrum from this point the steepest gradation being given by the extreme red .
The case oi ortho-chromatic plates in which is a complex mixture of silver salt and dye , is necessarily less simple , involving considerations of the localities in the spectrum to which the dye or dyes , together with that of the silver salt are most sensitive .
For this reason the simple salts have been experimented with in preference to the more complex organic compounds .
Methods of Experimenting .
As pointed out in the opening paragraph , there are two ways of experimenting , one where the illumination is constant , the times ot exposure being altered , and the other in which the time of exposure is constant , and the illumination is altered .
This last is the condi ion under which an image in the camera is photographed .
It might appear that both methods should give identical quantitative results , but it was more than probable that they would not o so , from the experiments that I had previously carried out with these two methods with ordinary white light .
The first set of experiments were with fixed time of a varying intensity of light .
To obtain the varying intensity , a photographic plate was exposed to white light , the parts exposed being limited to an area having the form of a triangle with the top cut off at the apex , the two sides being radial to the centre of ^e piate The enclosed angle was about 20 ' , so that by turning the .
plate round its centre , twelve different spaces would be exposed .
After the plate had been developed with ortol or ferrous oxalate , fixed , washed , and dried , the intervals between the exposed parts were blocked out .
me opacities were then ready for measurement .
Fig. 1 is a reproduction of the " star " graduated opacities .
Measurement of Star Opacity with different Colours .
It became necessary to see whether the deposit obstructed hght equally for each ray7 of the spectrum and the oiling ^ meant was adopted .
The colour patch apparatus which I have Gradation of a Developed Photographic Image .
Fig. 1 .
described in previous papers on Colour Photometry in the ' Philosophical Transactions , ' was brought into use .
A ray of the spectrum was allowed to issue through S , 'fig .
2 , and after passing through Fig. 2 .
a lens formed a square patch of monochromatic light on C a white screen In the path of the beam X a plain glass mirror , M " was mserted , which deflected a certain percentage of the beam Y to M2 , a silvered glass mirror , which in its turn reflected Y so as to a on C. A rod , R , placed in proper position , caused two oblongs of the direct and reflected beams to fall side by side on C. Two sectors , A and B , were placed in the paths of X and Y respectively .
The apertures of A could be opened or closed at pleasure whilst the disc was ro ting .
A red ray of the spectrum first came through S , and i- t , a^\gt ; er Ur\#174 ; 111 A required to equalise the two adjacent patches of X W.aS no\lt ; fd* ?
*her rays of the spectrum were similarly dealt with , thrlrl'rthat , the aperture in A unaltered , showing that within the limits of error of observation the percentage of reflec304 Sir W. de W. Abney .
On the Variation in tion from Mi remained the same for all rays .
The star-shaped opacities were then introduced into the beam X at D , and when necessary , B was rotated with known and fixed apertures , and the patches of light again made equally bright by means of A. It was found that the apertures of A varied as the different spectrum colours passed through the deposits , forming the graduated star .
Using the same scale for the spectrum as used in my former papers ( B is 61*3 .
Li 59*7 , C 58T , D 56 , E 39*8 , F 30-05 , Li 22*8 , G 11*2 ) , the absorptions were calculated for the whole spectrum .
It was found that the coefficient of absorption ( obstruction ) of white light and of the ray 26-8 , coincided , and taking this as unity ( for a purpose which will be seen presently ) the coefficients of the other rays are as follows:\#151 ; Table I. Scale number .

305 In percentages the transmission of white light through No. 1 and No. 12 is therefore 100 and 0477 respectively , which allows a sufficiently wide range of intensity to be investigated .
The above numbers represent then the absorption of white light , and also that of the blue light coming through a slit placed at 26-8 of the scale of the spectrum .
To obtain the scale in powers of - 2 for the other rays they must be multiplied by the factors given in Table I. The star can now be used for the purpose for which it was prepared .
Experiments with Fixed Time of Exposure .
With the colour-patch apparatus a patch of red light was thrown on the star backed by a sensitive plate , which could be revolved round their central point in a special dark slide , and exposure was made to the patch with the plates rotating for the time it was judged necessary to cause an impression of each intensity of light .
The rotation was deemed necessary in case the light coming through the thick part of the prism was more absorbed than that coming through the thin part .
The plate was then removed from the slide , and a scale of gradation impressed on a part which had been covered up during the previous exposure .
The source of light used for this scale was an amyl-acetate lamp placed at 4 feet from the plate , and the time was doubled for each successive exposure .
On development there was an image of the star , each space in different densities , and alongside a graduated scale of densities with which the star densities could be compared .
Other plates were exposed to other rays of the spectrum , those selected being at the scale numbers recorded in Table I. As each separate image of the star could he compared with the scale of gradation given by the amyl-acetate lamp they could be compared with one another .
Spectrum Sensitiveness of Bromo-iodide of Silver .
The first sensitive salt of silver with which experiments were made was the bromide of silver , to which a small quantity of iodide of silver had been added .
A spectrum of the electric arc light was impressed on the gelatine plates prepared with this salt , and the sensitiveness to the various rays ascertained by the plan given in a previous paper.* ( io facilitate a comparison of the results given in this paper with the curve of sensitiveness the latter is drawn on the prismatic scale as given above .

This gave the density measured on a scale of logarithms on a base due to Gradation of a Developed Photographic Image .
its coefficient of absorption ( obstruction ) .
The mode of measurement has been described in other papers by myself and need not be repeated .
As the " star " opacities and the graduated opacity scale on each plate were measured with the same annulus , it was unnecessary to reduce the measurements to densities which are usually taken in terms of common logarithms , or to transparencies in percentages of the initial light .
Example of Experiments .
It will facilitate matters if one example of measures be given in detail , and the mode in which they are applied .
The spectrum colour used was at the scale No. 56*7 .
The star with the plate in contact with it was placed in the dark slide , and so arranged that the square patch of monochromatic red light would cover the whole of the former .
The only light which would penetrate to the plate was through the star opacities .
The star and plate were made to revolve round their centre in the slide by means of a spindle projecting outside , on which was a pulley that could be geared to an electromotor .
Exposure was given for 65 minutes .
No light was in the room except the red light .
To make certain that the red light which fell on the prisms , and which illuminated them to a certain small extent , had no effect on the plate , the slit S , fig. 2 , was covered with red glass , which only allowed the red of the spectrum to pass .
The plate after the first exposure was completed ; was removed and placed in a special slide , which allowed varying time exposures to be made on small square areas of the plate alongside that part which had been already impressed .
The exposures were made to an amyl-acetate lamp at 4 feet distance , and were of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , \amp ; c. , units of time duration .
The plate was developed with ortol developer , fixed , washed , and dried .
It was then placed in the measuring apparatus , and the scale densities of the amyl-acetate lamp exposures and the star opacities measured .
On looking at Table I it will be seen that the coefficient of absorption , as there shown , is 0'87 .
The numbers in Table II were therefore multiplied by 0*87 to give the scale for abscissa in powers of 2 .
The following measures were obtained ( Tables IY and Y ) .
These results were plotted ( fig. 4 ) , and straight parts of both curves were compared .
It will be seen that in the star opacities the curve cuts the abscissa 1 with an ordinate of 174 , and this same ordinate is found on the scale curve at 2'65 in the abscissa .
Again , the first has an ordinate of 63 at the abscissa 4 , but the scale has abscissa 6'65 for the same ordinate .
This shows that the exposures of the star would have had to be prolonged in both cases to have acquired the same density as the scale , but very unequally .
We can find the unequal times necessary by subtracting the two abscissae from one another at each point , and expressing the inequality by a fraction .

It must be recollected that the first exposures required to give any deposit on a plate would be widely different , being far larger for the red light .

313 Experiments with Fixed Intensities of Rays .
Before commenting on this curve it will be better to describe the next set of experiments in which the light is constant , and there is a change in time .
The arrangements made were as followsFour slits in a card were made of such convenient width as ( found by trial ) allowed four different rays of the spectrum to emerge , and in front of the slits were cemented strips of a spectacle lens , which each gave an image of the prism surface of small size , but alongside one another .
To prevent the white light which illuminated the prisms causing any error in the exposure , in front of each slit was placed a strip of glass of a colour approximately corresponding to the colour coming through it .
Exposures were made to the four colours , in the same plate and for the same length of time , the exposure being admitted or shut off at the slit of the spectroscope , and when completed the plate was given a graduated scale with the amyl-acetate lamp as before .
The development of the plate was then carried out and the densities measured as usual .
The curve of the amyl-acetate light was plotted first , and the places which corresponded to the density of the f blue " light scale was marked on it .
It was necessary to do this , for although the electric arc light was steady , yet it did not remain absolutely the same in intensity throughout the whole of the exposures .
The places so fixed on the scale made by the amyl-acetate lamp by the blue exposures gave the points in the abscissa to which to refer the ordinates of the three other colour curves .
These were duly set up and the curves drawn .
Fig. 6 shows Table IX drawn diagrammatically .
It was again found that the gradation given by the colours less refrangible than the Beale No. 24 were steeper than that of this No. , as were also those of the colours more refrangible .
The slits were then moved into new positions and the same process gone through .
( See Tables IX , X , and XI .
) When these gradation factors are plotted on their appropriate scale numbers we get a curve convex to the base , with the lowest part lying about Scale No 24 , confirming the results obtained by the previous place .
( See fig. 5 .
) There can be but little doubt from both of these results that the place of minimum gradation given by rays is close to the wave-length to which the salt of silver under consideration is most sensitive .

Still one more plan , however , remained to be tried , ^iz .
, with a fixed intensity of light , but an alteration in the time of exposure by rotating a disc with gradually increasing apertures before the plate The disc so pierced is shown in fig. V. It will be seen that theie are two apertures , one near the centre and another at the extreme outside of the radius , which include 40 " only .
There are thus three apertures of 40 ' , and if the patch of light is uniform the leadings o the three should be the same .
All the plate was covered by a mas except a portion J-inch wide which extended its whole length , so that u essiv portions might be exposed to rays of different -ave-hmgtto " first .

meant it was found that the reduction of silver was greatest in that part which was illuminated by the light coming through the edge of the prism , and least where it passed through the bases of the prism , z 2 318 Sir W. de W.Abney .
Variation showing that the glass of the prisms absorbed a certain proportion of the different rays as they passed through .
It appeared probable that if the length of the ^-inch-wide slit were placed vertically in the patch of light { i.e. , parallel to the edges of the prism ) no difference in absorption would be found .
Such proved to be the case ; the exposure through the slit and the patch of light without the intervening sectors gave a uniformly dense deposit , and when the sectors were replaced the densities given by the three 40 ' exposures were the same .
On each plate exposures were given to four different colours , the total exposure varying in each case according to the colour ; a .
single exposure was also given to some colour without the sector , and an exposure to an amyl-acetate lamp was also given .

320 Sir W. cle W. Abney .
Variation in Causes of Difference of Results in the Experiments .
We next have to consider the cause of the difference between the results obtained when the intensity of the light was altered , the time being fixed , and these last two sets of results .
I must refer to a paper which appeared in the 'Proceedings ' of the Royal Society in 1893 , entitled " On a Failure of the Law in Photography , " \amp ; c. , more particularly to the Addendum of July 4th , when it was shown that though the product of time of exposure and intensity of light remained constant , yet when the intensity was diminished the photographic action might also be less , and that when the intensity became very small , the diminution was very marked .
These observations were further developed in subsequent communications to the Royal Photographic Society , in the same year , and it was shown that when the intensity of the same light remained constant during a set of exposures , the time being altered , the gradation of the plate remained the same though the curves occupied very variable positions in relation to the scale of absciss\#174 ; .
Thus if with ] a light of a unit intensity exposures were given to different parts of a plate for , say , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , \amp ; c. , seconds , and the light was reduced for another set of exposures on the same plate to 1/ 100 unit , and in order to make time x intensity constant in both cases the exposures were prolonged to 100,200,400,800 , \amp ; c. , seconds , on plotting the densities of the deposit in the manner described above , the two curves would be strictly parallel though by no means coincident .
In the last two sets of experiments as the relative times of exposure are kept the same , though the intensity is small , the gradation of the different rays would be the same , however much the intensity was increased .
On the other hand , where the intensity of the light is small ( and when we say intensity , we mean the photographic intensity ) , the gradation would be steeper than would be the case if the intensity of the light were large .
The photographic intensity of the light used for the red ray is less than 1/ 500 of the blue : hence on this account alone the " gradation factor " is larger than m the last two sets of experiments .
This accounts for the difference between the gradation factors obtained by the two methods , from the red to the blue , and also for the approximate coincidence from the blue to the extreme violet when the photographic intensities of the light used are nearly the same .
We see , then , that the gradation factors as found by the last two methods are those which really represent the difference due to the alteration in wave-lengths of the monochromatic light , and that the factors found by the first method are compounded between this alteration and that due to diminished photographic intensity .
As before remarked , the results of the first method of experimenting are those which apply to camera images , for they are form iy different intensities of light , and the exposure is the same for any part .
If , then , a plain surface were covered with a graduated scale Gradation of a Developed Photographic Image .
321 of greys , and a photograph taken of it through red glass , which practically cuts off all spectral rays except the red , and also through blue glass , the gradation of greys in the negative would be much more pronounced in the case of the red image than that of the blue , and we come to the conclusion that for three-colour photographic printing from a " red , " a " green , " and a " blue " negative this difference should be a source of difficulty , and this is certainly the case .
What scientific explanation there is of this difference in true gradation factor is hard to say .
It almost appears that in the case of the blue waves acting on the atoms of the molecule of sensitive salt , whilst the amplitude is increased the rate of oscillation is slightly altered , gradually making the periodic motion of the waves of light out of tune with the motions of the atoms ; whilst with the red rays , which are vastly out of synchronism with the atomic swings , the atoms got more nearly synchronous with them , and thus produce more photographic action .
In my work on ' The Action of Light in Photography , ' I have given a possible explanation of the difference in effect caused by a feeble intensity and a great intensity of light , and it may be that the same kind of explanation might hold good in this newly found phase of the actibn of light .
It appears that these photographic phenomena are worthy of attention from the point of view of molecular physics .
It may be thought that these results might be peculiar to the salt of silver experimented with .
A further series of experiments were conducted with the chloride of silver in gelatine .
The maximum sensitiveness of these plates was found to be near H in the solar spectrum .
The gradation was found to be least at this point , and increased when rays on each side of this point were employed to act on the film .
In the blue near the F line , where the sensitiveness of the plate was very small , the gradation was excessively steep , as it also was in the extreme ultra-violet .
