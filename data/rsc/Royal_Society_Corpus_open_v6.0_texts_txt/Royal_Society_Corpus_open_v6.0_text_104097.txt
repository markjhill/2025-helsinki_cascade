An Extract of a Letter from Mr. Hopkins to Mr. John Senex , F. R. S. concerning an extraordinary large Horn of the Stag Kind , taken out of the Sea on the Coast of Lancashire .
ENCLOSED is a Sketch of an Horn , which I thought of an extraordinary Size , the Dimensions whereof are exactly set down , as I took them myself , by laying a String along the Surface .
Vid. Fig. 4 .
Part of the left Horn of a Stag .
ae the Length 30 Inches .
bb the Circumference above the third Branch , 7 Inches .
c the Circumference above the second Branch , 8 Inches .
dd the Circumference between the Brow and second Antler , 11 Inches .
ee the Circumference 10 Inches .
de the Circumference of the Brow-Antler , 63/ 4 Inches .
of the Length of the Antler , 163/ 4 Inches .
This Horn was drawn out of Raven 's Barrow Hole , adjoining to Holker Old Park , by the Net of a Fisherman , on the 20th of June , 1727 .
The Tide flows constantly where it was found , and the Land is very high near it .
This Horn is now in the Possession of Sir Thomas Lowther , Bart. of Holker , in Cartmell in Lancashire .
SIR , Your Humble Servant , J. HOPKIN S. Several Horns of this Kind , and extraordinary Size , have been frequently dug up in Bogs in Ireland , but I never met with an Account of any being found in the Sea before .
I shall refer the Curious to the Account of the large Horns found under Ground in Ireland , communicated to the Royal Society by Sir Thomas Molyneux , M. D. F. R. S. which is printed in these Transactions , Numb. 227 , p.489 , &amp;c. and to the Description of the Moose Deer by the Honourable Paul Dudley , Esq ; F. R. S. Numb. 368 , p. 165 , &amp;c.
