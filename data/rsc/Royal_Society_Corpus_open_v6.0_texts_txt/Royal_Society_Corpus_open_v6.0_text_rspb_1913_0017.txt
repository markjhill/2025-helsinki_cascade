( Communicated by H. G. Plimmer , F.R.S. Received December 23 , 1912 , \#151 ; Read February 6 , 1913 .
) ( From the Yei Camp , Sudan Sleeping Sickness Commission .
) The use of precipitated metallic antimony , in a state of finest division , was devised by Plimmer for the treatment of trypanosomiasis , and the results of his and other experiments with this substance have been published.* After a long series of experiments on subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of this form of antimony suspended in water , oily media , egg yolk , etc. , all of which caused great irritation , he found that it was possible to inject it intravenously with safety , and without causing any irritation of the tissues .
A large number of animals were cured of trypanosomiasis by this means , and in May , 1910 , Major W. B. Fry gave a dose intravenously to a late case of Kala Azar , thus demonstrating that it could also be used safely in this manner on human beings .
Captain R. J. C. Thompson , R.A.M.C. , gave this preparation by intravenous injection to the cases first admitted to the Yei Sleeping Sickness Camp between January and March , 1911 .
Eighty-one injections were given to 38 cases , but pressure of administrative work prevented these cases being fully treated and investigated , and they were all transferred to atoxyl treatment .
Captain Thompson states that from a clinical standpoint some of these cases showed great improvement .
Later 1 had the honour of being appointed to the Sudan Sleeping Sickness Commission for work at Yei in the Lado Enclave , and since October , 1911 , I have collected a series of cases treated by metallic antimony alone and in conjunction with other drugs .
This report is consequently only preliminary ; but it demonstrates that antimony in this form is a safe drug to employ in the treatment of sleeping sickness , if used with reasonable precautions , and that the results obtained so far certainly call for extended use and further investigation .
During the past year 76 newly admitted cases have been treated with antimony , alone and combined with salvarsan and atoxyl , and shorter courses of antimony have been given to 143 old cases previously treated with atoxyl , * 'Boy .

Treatment of Human [ Dec. 23 , atoxylate of mercury , etc. Over 1400 intravenous injections have been given , and three deaths have occurred which can be attributed to the treatment .
All these fatal cases were amongst the first 150 injections .
The method of administration is the same as that of an ordinary intravenous injection of saline solution given hydrostatically through a needle of somewhat large bore.* The dose of antimony is stirred with about half an ounce of normal saline in a small glass mortar and becomes a temporary suspension .
Two ounces of saline are then poured into the funnel and tubing , the needle is inserted into any vein in the forearm and the clip opened .
As soon as it is seen that the saline is flowing freely into the vein , and there is no swelling round the site of the puncture , the suspension of antimony is poured into the funnel and the mortar is washed out , with a little more saline , into the funnel in order to leave no residue .
The antimony is allowed to run into the vein , the funnel being gently shaken from time to time , and , when it is on the point of becoming empty , more saline is poured in .
The window in the rubber tubing should be watched , and after all traces of antimony have passed it some more saline is allowed to run in to clear it out of the part of the tubing below the window ; the clip is then closed and the needle withdrawn .
About six ounces of saline seems to be a sufficient quantity , and the time occupied in giving an injection varies from three to seven minutes\#151 ; depending on the calibre of the vein and the bore of the needle employed .
I have found it possible , without any hurry , to give as many as 10 injections in an hour ; I mention this to show that this method of treatment is feasible on a large scale .
The question of dosage is one of considerable importance .
The dose usually given was one grain .
Large doses up to three grains have been given , but these seem to be attended with risk and have been given up for the present ; it is probable , however , that in good , selected cases one and a half , or even two , grains may be safely given .
Several cases of extreme susceptibility have been met with , however , so that the initial dose should be one grain .
The interval between the doses seems to be of the greatest importance .
Four days would seem to be most suitable , but injections have frequently been repeated on the third day after a dose ; they should certainly not be postponed any later than the fifth day .
A few of the earlier cases were treated with weekly doses ; two of these were very susceptible and were unable to take doses at shorter intervals ; both cases have relapsed .
The usual course of treatment has been five doses at intervals of four days , * The size of the one I have used is No. 19 of Imperial Standard Wire Gauge internal diameter and No. 15 external .
1912 .

205 covering a period of from 17 to 20 days ; after an interval of six weeks a short course of three doses extending over nine days has been given .
The table on pp. 206-7 gives in shortest form the results of the treatment with antimony alone .
Thirty-five cases have been so treated : in 15 of these there were no symptoms other than enlargement of the cervical glands , except varying degrees of debility ; 17 had also fine tremor of the tongue and five oedema of eyelids .
The cases were not especially selected for treatment , but were taken just as they came .
Up to the present it has not been possible to procure susceptible animals for inoculation from the cases treated , so microscopical examination has been the only available method of controlling the results .
Blood and gland juice have been examined in all cases .
Three observers have undertaken each examination , and the total time of each examination has been one and a half hours .
Many of the cases have been repeatedly examined .
Of these 35 cases four are dead and two have deserted .
Trypanosomes have reappeared in the blood of four cases and another has relapsed clinically .
The remaining 24 are all improved and all microscopical examinations are negative up to date of writing .
( a ) Deaths.\#151 ; Two only of the four deaths can be connected directly with the treatment .
Both were advanced cases and had been given larger doses than usual .
No. 2 , a boy of 10 years , had 2 gr. on one occasion and 1| gr. twice .
He showed no symptoms till 48 hours after the last dose , when meteorism appeared accompanied by acute abdominal pain , and he died seven hours later .
I have seen a somewhat similar death here in a case treated only with atoxyl .
No. 24 was also an advanced case ; he took two injections of 1 gr. without discomfort and then had a dose of 2 gr. Twelve hours later epileptiform symptoms set in quite suddenly ; the patient became unconscious and died six hours later .
Of the other two deaths\#151 ; No. 7 was due to broncho-pneumonia ; the patient was debilitated and broncho-pneumonia was very prevalent at that time .
No. 47 died from an epileptiform attack , but had not had any form of treatment for a week .
( b ) Deserters.\#151 ; One , No. 38 , had recently completed his course of treatment and had shown great improvement .
The other , No. 3 , belonged to a district 100 miles from Yei .
He had been without treatment for five months and had done very well\#151 ; taking large doses without untoward symptoms .
All examinations had been negative , though repeated very frequently .
( c ) Relapses.\#151 ; No. 27 is a clinical relapse .

Treatment of Human [ Dec. 28 , condition on arrival at the Camp was alarming , and he was quite unable to walk .
A. full course of antimony , in doses of 1 gr. , was successfully given and there was a great improvement in his condition .
The large masses of glands were very greatly reduced in size .
The tremor was unaffected , but he became much stronger .
He was able to act as a " native assistant " in the laboratory and a " headman " in the camp .
His improvement was maintained for three and a-half months , when suddenly he relapsed and became a third stage case .
Blood examinations have been negative .
The cerebro-spinal fluid was examined also and the cellular elements were increased , but trypanosomes were not found .
In four other cases trypanosomes have reappeared in the blood .
Two of these were very susceptible to antimony and were unable to take doses at shorter intervals than a week .
After the relapse attempts were made to give them another course of antimony , but it had to be given up owing to their unusual susceptibility to the drug .
The other two had heavy infections , but did not seem to improve .
They have all been transferred to atoxyl .
( d ) The other 24 cases have shown improvement .
In three it is slight and these are being kept under close observation .
In some cases the improvement has been very striking ; in others who were admitted in fairly good condition , it has not been so evident , but the whole appearance of the patients is different .
After a course of antimony there is not uncommonly depression and debility .
This , however , passes off in a few days ; the patient becomes more active , feels and looks better , and loses the languor that is so often seen in patients just admitted .
They put on weight and the skin becomes healthier ; this is no doubt due in part to the regular feeding in the sleeping sickness camp , but the improvement would not occur were it not initiated by the treatment .
In some cases the tongue tremor has disappeared under treatment .
Probably some other cases will relapse , so these cases are being kept without further treatment at present , as it is desirable to test the effect of this treatment with antimony alone .
II .
Antimony and Salvdrsan .
Ten cases have been treated with these two drugs , but a regular course has not been carried out ; the salvarsan was given , in the majority of cases , when a patient was unable to take a complete course of antimony .
No information has been obtained as to the best line of treatment to be followed with this combination of drugs , but a further series has been commenced .
The results up to the present are : Eight out of the ten cases are very well and have shown definite improvement ; one deserted , but was in very good 1912 .

209 health and had been without treatment for four months .
She was one of the few who had a complete course .
The tenth case had one injection of salvarsan and was unable to take antimony on account of extreme susceptibility .
Atoxyl was substituted , but the patient developed toxic symptoms .
She is now having small doses of atoxyl , but is getting steadily worse .
The salvarsan has been given both as an intramuscular injection in olive oil , and by intravenous injection in alkaline solution .
III .
Antimony and Atoxyl .
The patients in this series have been treated as follows :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Five doses of antimony 1 gr. at intervals of four days .
( 2 ) Atoxyl 5 gr. every three days for 40 days .
( 3 ) Three doses of antimony 1 gr. at intervals of four days .
( 4 ) Atoxyl 5 gr. every three days for one month .
There is no interval between these courses , so the patients have continuous treatment over a period of rather more than three months .
An interval of a month is then given and atoxyl treatment is then continued , as a tonic and precautionary treatment .
Thirty-one patients have been treated ; but three were unable to take the complete course of antimony .
This is the most recent series , and the three months ' course has just been completed ; it is too early to speak of results .
At the time of writing all have done well ; the improvement , in many instances , has been striking ; some , however , were advanced cases , and it is not expected that the improvement can be maintained permanently .
IV .
Old Atoxyl Cases , Treated with Short Courses of Antimony .
After we had seen that intravenous injection of antimony was bringing about improvement in the newly admitted cases and could easily be carried out on a large scale , it was decided to give short courses of antimony to the old cases that had been under treatment with atoxyl , atoxylate of mercury , etc. The majority of the patients so treated have had two separate courses of three doses of antimony , 1 gr. In some instances , patients have not had all these six doses on account of susceptibility , intercurrent affections , bronchitis , etc. , but 813 injections have been given to 143 patients .
In this series there has been one death .
The two fatal cases in the first series had doses which have been found to be inadvisable in advanced 210 Captain H. S. Ranken .
Treatment of Human [ Dec. 23 , cases .
In this case only two injections of 1 gr. had been given .
The patient wTas a man in good health ; he showed slight depression after the first dose , but had quite recovered and was ready for a second dose , four days later .
He was sick after this and soon developed alarming symptoms , and died .
There were no late effects in any of the other patients .
Symptoms Following the Intravenous Injection of Antimony .
Antimony has a powerful depressant action and , as the preparation employed is very active , it is only to be expected that a course of treatment should cause the appearance of some symptoms .
It has been found that some patients have a high degree of susceptibility to antimony , and they have suffered somewhat severely ; also , at the beginning of this work , when attempts were being made to obtain some information as to the dosage , larger doses were given and the effects were , in some cases , more marked .
With further experience symptoms of any degree of severity have become very rare .
The following are the symptoms which may be seen in patients who are not unusually susceptible:\#151 ; 1 .
Fever : The " reaction thermique .
" 2 .
Pulse : Is not much accelerated ; but , so far as can be ascertained by digital examination , there is a fall in blood pressure .
3 .
Diuresis : There is variable diuresis .
4 .
Cough : This occurs in the majority of cases .
It begins a few minutes after administration and lasts for 5 or 10 minutes .
Very rarely it has persisted for 12 or 24 hours , but only in cases which have had slight bronchitis .
5 .
Pain in the xiphisternal region : This is a common occurrence and is most severe the day following an injection .
It is probably of gastric origin .
6 .
Headache is not uncommon , but is not severe .
The following symptoms have only occurred in cases of great susceptibility to the drug:\#151 ; 7 .
Sickness and vomiting : This has occurred six times ; once it occurred in a fatal case ( No. 32a ) .
8 .
Fainting : Only one case .
9 .
Meteorism : Was seen in one case ( No. 2 ) , which was fatal .
Captain Thompson saw a similar case 18 months ago .
10 .
Herpes : There have been seven cases .
In six it was seen on the face and lips , and in the seventh along the ribs .
This condition is probably similar to the herpes that occurs in certain forms of arsenical poisoning .

211 11 .
Stomatitis : Two cases ; one was vesicular , but the other was more severe and ulcerated .
In both cases the lesions were limited to the anterior portion of the hard palate , and the condition may perhaps have been herpetic .
It is of interest to note that very similar symptoms were observed in experimental dogs treated in this manner .
Short mention must be made of the effect of antimony on the temperature and upon the leucocytes .
I. Temperatu .
A " reaction thermique " has been described , occurring about 20 minutes after injection of salts of antimony .
This subject may be of greater interest owing to the large amount of work done on the subject of salvarsan fever .
Temperatures have been taken in over 100 cases : ( 1 ) at short intervals on the day of an injection ; and ( 2 ) morning and evening temperatures for three days after treatment .
There is no effect on the temperature till two or three hours after treatment , when it rises 1 ' F. , and at four hours after treatment the average rise is 1*4 ' F. The same evening , 10 to 12 hours after treatment , some cases have fallen to normal , while others have gone up to over 101 ' .
For the next two days there is an average evening temperature of 100-2 ' and OO^0 , and the temperature returns to normal .
The results are identical in treated and untreated cases ; trypanolysis and the disposal of dead trypanosomes do not , therefore , cause this rise of temperature .
The initial rise may be due to antimony , but the temperature for the two following days is probably due to the saline solution .
With the apparatus available here it is impossible to get pure distilled water ; it would be of interest if some injections could be given with water twice distilled in a good apparatus .
The temperature does not seem to have any effect on the general condition of the patients .
II .
Leucocytes .
The action of leucocytes on this preparation has been described.* Blood films , taken from animals after treatment , were stained and the leucocytes found to be crammed with the minute particles of antimony .
They show a great avidity for this preparation , which they discharge , presumably in soluble form , into the blood-stream , the action being thus spread over a longer period .
A series of 200 leucocyte counts has been made to determine the effect of * ' Roy .

212 Captain H. S. R-anken .
Treatment of Hitman [ Dec. 23 , treatment on the numbers of leucocytes .
The cases selected were all under treatment , but some enumerations were made on untreated cases and the same changes observed .
Immediately after injection of antimony there is a considerable reduction of the leucocytes in the peripheral blood and in half an hour they have fallen to 60 per cent , of the number obtained on enumeration just before administration .
In some cases the count is still lower an hour after the injection .
From this point the leucocytes began to rise in number and in the majority of cases have returned in four or six hours to the level of the first count .
This increase continues and 24 hours after treatment there is an average count of over 16,000 ; this is maintained for another 24 hours , but four days after treatment the numbers have fallen to approximately the original count .
The estimations were continued over a series of three doses , and showed the same changes after each .
III .
Action of Antimony on Trypanosomes .
The exceedingly rapid action of the salts of antimony in man has been reported ( 4 ) , but it was not anticipated that the metal would have an almost immediate trypanocidal action .
Trypanosomes were never found in cases examined a few hours after treatment , so observations were made to determine the time required for an intravenous injection of antimony to clear the glands of trypanosomes .
Only heavily infected cases were selected , a case being considered suitable if 10 trypanosomes were found in five minutes in the gland juice , but in many instances they were much more numerous , two and three trypanosomes being often seen in one field .
The time was taken from the moment the antimony suspended in saline solution entered a vein in the arm , and at periods from 3 to 30 minutes after this time glands were punctured and wet preparations made .
These were examined both by dark ground and ordinary illumination .
In all cases 15 minutes was allowed for each film , and in many cases the search was prolonged up to 30 or 45 minutes .
After 3 minutes ( slide made before the injection is completed).\#151 ; Trypanosomes are still abundant , but some are already very obviously affected by the treatment .
They show greatly exaggerated activity and dash rapidly across the field , so that they are difficult to keep in view .
Frequently a trypanosome becomes anchored by the blunt end and lashes about most vigorously .
This exaggerated motility soon passes into a state of fatigue , when the trypanosome wriggles more slowly and more and more feebly till movement ceases .
Some retain their normal form , while others become swollen and bloated .
1912 .
] Trypanosomiasis and Yaws with Metallic Antimony .
213 Occasionally a trypanosome comes rapidly to a standstill and dissolves away so that only a haze of protoplasm can be seen left behind .
After 5 minutes.\#151 ; The exaggerated motility is not so frequently observed , but the trypanosomes are more often anchored and may be seen lashing about in an extreme state of activity .
They appear to be somewhat reduced in number .
After 7 minutes.\#151 ; Trypanosomes are more scanty .
Exaggerated motility is not a feature of these preparations , but all the other changes occur as in the earlier preparations .
After 10 and 15 minutes.\#151 ; In all preparations taken at these times a considerable search was required to find a trypanosome , but in the majority of cases one could be found in a search of 10 to 20 minutes .
After 20 minutes.\#151 ; Very many preparations have been examined and have invariably proved negative .
An intravenous injection of antimony therefore kills the trypanosomes in the circulating blood in 20 minutes .
On the Treatment of Yaws by the same Method .
Some cases of yaws have been met with in the course of this work .
In view of the successful results published by Strong , Castellani , and Alston , the first three cases were treated with salvarsan .
One wras given an intramuscular injection of 0'6 grm. in olive oil ; the lesions\#151 ; plantar ulcers\#151 ; were healed in three wTeeks .
The two others had an intravenous injection of 0-45 grm. , they showed several small patches on the face and trunk and responded much more rapidly to intravenous treatment .
I had been much impressed with the rapid trypanocidal action of this metallic antimony , and decided to treat a case of yaws with this drug .
At first doses of 1 gr. were given and the condition improved , but not very rapidly .
With a larger dose the effect was much more striking ; gr. seems to be quite efficient , but 2 gr. have been given to the last four cases .
None of the 10 cases manifested the hyper-susceptibility to antimony that has been seen in sleeping sickness , and there have been no after effects .
In an adult of fair condition 1 gr. should be given as a first dose , and doses of 1| gr. or 2 gr. repeated twice with intervals of four days .
I have sometimes shortened the interval by one day .
Three doses , I believe , is a quite sufficient course of treatment , but in the majority of our cases a fourth dose has been given to ensure , as far as possible , a permanent result , as most of these cases have been collected from different villages and pass out of observation when they are discharged from hospital .
The antimony is administered as described above ( p. 204 ) for trypanosomiasis .
214 Treatment of Human Trypanosomiasis and Yaws .
The following short notes give an abstract of the cases :\#151 ; 1 .
Lesions small , but generally distributed with septic or impetiginous patches in the beard .
Four doses of antimony were given\#151 ; two of 1 gr. and two of 1| gr. Lesions were all healed in 12 days .
2 .
Lesions general and larger than in preceding case .
Treatment , four doses of gr. All lesions healed in 11 days .
3 .
Extensive ulceration of scrotum .
The ulcers had moist surfaces and an exceedingly offensive discharge .
Treatment , four doses of lj gr. All healed in 11 days .
4 .
A large crusted patch on perineum and several small lesions on face .
Treatment in four doses of lj gr. Healed in 10 days .
5 .
Extensive ulceration on soles of feet .
Treatment four doses of gr. ; local treatment , perchloride of mercury 1/ 1000 as a lotion .
Quite healed in 14 days .
6 .
Discharging ulcers between toes .
Treatment , four doses of 1^ gr. Healed in 14 days .
7 .
Generalised eruption .
There were large confluent patches all over the face , trunk , perineum , and limbs .
There was also a large primary ulcer on the scrotum 3 inches in diameter , with very foul discharge .
The patient was debilitated , and three doses of 1 gr. were given .
There was some improvement , but it was very slow , so a dose of 2 gr. was given , and all the lesions were completely healed in six days , except the ulcer , which was reduced to less than 1 inch in diameter .
8 .
Some patches on the face with thick raised limpet crusts , and many small lesions on the scrotum , perineum , and buttocks , with moist discharging surfaces .
Treatment , one dose of H gr. , followed by two doses of 2 gr. and a fourth of lj gr. All healed in 10 days .
9 .
Small patches on scrotum , penis , and perineum .
Treatment , one dose of 1^ gr. and two of 2 gr. All healed in 10 days .
10 .
Small patches on scrotum , penis , perineum , and axil he .
Treatment , one dose of lj gr. and two of 2 gr. All lesions healed in 11 days .
In all cases the lesions were characteristic of the various stages of yaws , from minute vesico-pustules up to confluent , crusted lesions , rupioid patches with limpet-shell crusts , or late plantar-ulcers .
The diagnosis was confirmed in the earlier cases by examination of scrapings from the deeper parts of the lesions .
Films were examined by dark ground illumination and spirochetes were found , sometimes in large numbers .
After the first dose the discharging ulcers showed signs of drying up and they skinned over rapidly .
In 48 hours a distinct improvement was seen ; the crusted lesions had shrunk somewhat and no longer contained fluid .
The yellow colour disappeared and was replaced by a pearly grey ; the underlying raw surface healed very quickly , and soon there was only a desquamating flake representing the site of the lesion .
Accompanying the local changes there was improvement in the patient 's general condition .
The number of cases treated is small , but they have been uniformly successful .
The treatment can easily be carried out on a large scale , and it may be possible to cure large numbers of persons affected with this most unsightly , and hitherto long-enduring disease , without causing too Liberation of Ions and Oxygen Tension of Tissues .

This preparation of antimony was tried successfully in a few cases of syphilis* by intramuscular injection , but the pain was so severe that the method was not continued .
I venture to suggest that , as intravenous injection of the metal has proved feasible , a further trial may be warranted in this other spirochsetal disease so closely allied to yaws .

) The hypothesis , that when cells become active ions are liberated , is frequently quoted in physiological writings , but measurements of the ionic changes are not given .
The present research is an attempt to measure the ionic changes during tissue activity .
A knowledge of these changes is desirable in order to compare the action of ions on colloids outside the cells with the changes that occur inside the cells. .
On turning to the physiological literature one finds that little or nothing is given in the way of measurement of the ionic concentrations with which biology has to deal .
Thus , neither the recent work on electrobiology by Bernstein , f nor that on the hydrogen ion in biological processes by Sorensen^ contains any reference to the measurements of ions in tissues during rest or activity .
G-aleotti has , however , measured the hydrogen ion in heart muscle .
S Method .
The method used in the present series of experiments was to prepare a frog 's sartorius muscle and arrange it for direct stimulation from an induction coil .
A high resistance reflecting galvanometer was used and the muscle was tetanised .
The muscle was tested with non-polarisable ( Ringer solution , \#166 ; calomel ) electrodes .
Two of these were placed to touch the muscle directly * ' Roy .
