_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ LET m and n be any whole positive numbers ; and 1+xa binomial to be expanded into a series , as 1+ Ax + Bx2+ Cx ' + , &amp;c. where A , B , C , D , &amp;c. are the coefficients to be determined .
Assume vm=F+i\xn =x+ Ax + Bxz + Cx ' Dx + &amp;c. And zm= T7-1 + Ay + By2 +Cy3 + Dy4 + , &amp;c. Then will v'-= 1+ x , and zI = I+y.*.nznX-y .

Suppose then x =y ; then will v z ; and our equation will become nV , or my , , _A+2 Bx +3 Cx1+ 4Dx ' + , &amp;c. But v " =i+ x , therefore by multiplying we have mn =A n +A+2Bx+2B + 3Cx'+3C+4Dx'+ , &amp;c.

In the above investigation , it is obvious that unless m be a positive whole number , the numerator abovementioned .
does not terminate : it still remains , therefore , to show how to derive the series when m is a negative whole number .
In this case , the expression ( Um Zr ) assumes this form , V or its equal zvnv ?
n which divided by v ' -z7 , as before , gives ZnVn-Vzx : Um " +Vm'~Z+V'7-3Zz , va zm vnI Zn X~f Un V+ Un m+ V-n 2 + ; I+ V,4 Ova Z+Vn3 ZI , + &amp; C. InVIX _-v = ( when V Hi Vtn Z.Vt l+Vn2 Z+ Un 3Z7 + , &amp; C. J , xe XnVn -m which is the same as the expression Un before derived with only the sign of m changed .
The remainder of the process being the same as before , shows that the series is general , or extends to all cases , regard being had to the signs .
