( From the Pathological Laboratory of St. Mary 's Hospital , London , W. ) [ Plate 3 .
] In a previous communication we showed that the phagocytosis which occurs when cultures of the Staphylococcus pyogenes are added to human blood , is directly dependent upon the presence of certain substances in the blood which exert a specific effect upon the bacteria .
We suggested that the bacteriotropic substances here in question might appropriately be denoted by the term " opsonins .
" In the present paper we propose to bring out certain further points in connection with the " opsonic power " of the blood .
Relation of the Opsonic Power of Human Blood to the Capacity of Resisting Invasion by the Staphylococcus Pyogenes .
It has already been shown* by one of us that patients who are the subjects of acne , sycosis , or boils are characterised by a defective phagocytic power for the Staphylococcus pyogenes .
We have recently been able to satisfy ourselves that this defective phagocytosis is dependent upon a defect of opsonic power .
It has also been shown by one of us that the cure of these bacterial infections , which can in almost every instance be achieved by the inoculation of appropriate quantities of sterilised staphylococcus cultures , is associated with the acquirement of an increased phagocytic power .
We have now succeeded in establishing the fact\#151 ; already adumbrated in our previous paper\#151 ; that the increased phagocytosis which is associated with the achievement of the condition of immunisation here in question is dependent , not upon a modification of the white corpuscles , but upon a development of opsonins in the blood fluids .
The results of the subjoined experiment bring out this fact into clear relief .
Details of the Experiment .
Immunised Patient 's Blood.\#151 ; The patient , F. F. , who had long been the subject of aggravated staphylococcic sycosis , had , after prolonged and * ' Lancet , ' March 29 , 1902 .
1904 ] Role of Blood Fluids in connection with Pha 129 ineffectual treatment with antiseptics , been subjected to three successive inoculations of a sterilised staphylococcus culture .
Under these inoculations his clinical condition had ameliorated itself in an astonishing manner , and his phagocytic power , which had previous to the date of inoculation been less by half than that of the normal man who served as a control , had increased in a progressive manner after each inoculation .
A sample of blood was now ( by the technique elsewhere described)* drawn off and mixed with ^th of its volume of 10 per cent , citrate of soda .
A second sample of blood was drawn off and allowed to clot in the ordinary way .
In the case of the first sample of blood the corpuscles were isolated from the plasma by repeated washing with physiological salt solution , and centrifugalisation .
The corpuscles thus isolated are referred to below as " washed corpuscles .
" In the case of the second sample of blood the serum was simply separated from the corpuscles in the ordinary way by centrifugalisation .
Control Blood from a Normal Man\#151 ; blood which served as a control was obtained from a normal healthy man .
It was drawn off in exactly the same manner and was treated in each case by exactly the same procedures as the blood obtained from the patient .
Bacterial Culture\#151 ; The bacterial culture employed in the experiments set forth below was obtained by suspending in physiological salt solution a portion of a 24 hours ' growth of Staphylococcus albus on agar .
The quantities of serum , washed corpuscles , and staphylococcus culture which are specified below were then in each case taken up into a capillary tube , mixed on a glass slide , re-aspirated into the tube , and digested together at blood heat for 15 minutes .
Films were then made and stained by Leishman 's stain .
Finally the number of ingested bacteria were enumerated in a series of polynuclear W.B.C. taken in order as they came .
The phagocytic index given below\#151 ; and the same applies throughout this paper\#151 ; represents in each case the average number of bacteria ingested by the individual P.W.B.C. The number of polynuclear white blood corpuscles which have furnished the index is in each case inserted in brackets :\#151 ; Experiment .

Experiments on the Opsonic Power of Human Blood in its Relation to the Bacillus of Plague .
In these and all subsequent experiments , unless where otherwise specified , the technique employed was exactly the same as that employed in the experiments set forth above .
It may further be premised that the bacterial suspensions employed were in each case suspensions of very young agar cultures\#151 ; in most cases 24-hour cultures\#151 ; in physiological salt solution .
By the term " heated serum " is in each case to be understood serum which has been subjected to a temperature of 60 ' C. for 10 minutes or more .

So typical were the involution forms of the ingested plague bacilli , that we should not n hesitate to employ the method of phagocytosis as an aid to diagnosis in the case of a doubtful plague culture .

Opsonig Power of Human Blood in its Eelation to the Bacillus typhosus and the Cholera Vibrio .
It is well known that human blood exerts a very considerable bactericidal power upon cultures of the Bacillus typhosus and .of the cholera vibrio .
The destructive effect in question manifests itself to microscopical observation in the form of very profound morphological changes which coriie under observation in cultures which have been digested with unheated serum .
The bacteria in such cultures , after undergoing agglutination and spherulation , swell up and lose their .chemical affinity for anilin dyes .
Finally they are Completely dissolved .
It is manifest that where disintegrative changes of this kind are occurring under the influence of the serum , opsonic effects will be more or less thrust into the background .
These last will , in the case of phagocytic experiments conducted with unheated serum , be masked , on the one hand , by the fact that'there will be fewer bacteria available for phagocytosis , and on the other hand by the fact that intracellular disintegration will , it may be presumed , be more rapid in the case where the serum has already exerted a disintegrative effect on the bacteria anterior to their ingestion .
Lastly , ingested bacteria which have lost their characteristic chemical affinity for their stain may readily escape enumeration .

] Kole of Blood Fluids in connection with 141 pestis , the Micrococcus melitensis , the Dof Fraenkel , the Bacillus coli , the Bacillus dysenteries ( Shiga ) , the Bacillus the Bacillus typhosus , and the Vibrio cholera Asiatics .
So far as we have gone , the Bacillus diphtheria and its congener the Bacillus]xerosis have proved to be the only pathogenetic bacteria which are insensible to this action of the blood fluids .
Taking these experimental data in conjunction with other facts which have been elicited by us , or as the case may be by one of us working in connection with Captain F. Windsor , * I.M.S. , with regard to the bactericidal action exerted by human blood upon the various species of pathogenetic micro-organisms , we may classify these bacteria in the following categories:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Bacteria which are eminently sensible to the bactericidal , bacteriolytic , and opsonic action of normal human blood fluids.\#151 ; The Bacillus typhosus and the Vibrio cholera Asiatica .
( 2 ) Bacteria which are in some measure sensible to the bactericidal action of the normal human blood fluids , and which are eminently opsonic action.\#151 ; The Bacillus coli and the Bacillus ( 3 ) Bacteria which are absolutely insensible to the bactericidal action of the normal human blood fluids , but are eminently sensible to the opsonic action of these fluids.\#151 ; The Staphylococcus pyogenes , the Bacillus pestis , the coccus melitensis , the Diplococcus pneumonice- of Fraenkel .
( 4 ) Bacteria which are insensible both to the bactericidal and to the opsonic action of human blood fluids.\#151 ; The Bacillus and Bacillus xerosis .
It may be pointed out in conclusion that the demonstration furnished above , that successful immunisation against the staphylococcus pyogenes is dependent upon an elaboration of opsonins in the system of the inoculated patient , suggests that successful immunisation against plague and Malta fever , and we may add against streptococcal invasions , may be likewise dependent upon the elaboration of opsonins .
It will be manifest that if this is so , the determination of the opsonic power of the blood is calculated to render services also in connection with the testing of any therapeutic sera which may find an application in connection with the disease .

] In a previous communication , * Sir Norman Lockyer and I gave the results of a discussion of prominence observations , and pointed out the necessity of dealing individually with small zones on the solar surface .
In that paper brief reference was made to the law of spot zones , as discovered by Carrington , and corroborated by Sporer , and it was further stated that more modern observations had established these general deductions of spot distribution .
The words " general deductions " were purposely used , as it was then noticed that there were many anomalies that required explanation .
The object of the present paper is to draw attention to these anomalies , and to give the results that have been deduced from a minute examination of the changes of heliographic latitudes of sunspots from year to year .
The present evidence indicates that the law of Sporer , although of great importance , represents only a very general idea of a complicated sunspot circulation .
