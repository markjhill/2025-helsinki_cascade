A Description of the several Strata of Earth , Stone , Coal , &amp;c. found in a Coal-Pit at the West End of Dudley in Staffordshire : By Mr. Fettiplace Bellers , F. R. S. To which is added , a Table of the Specific Gravity of each Stratum : By Mr Fr. Hauksbee , F. R. S. Communicated by Dr. Hans Sloane , R. S. Secr. I. A Yellowish Clay , which lies immediately under the Turf .
II .
A Bluish Clay .
III .
A Bluish hard Clay ; the Miners call it Clunch .
This is one of the certain Signs of Coal .
It has in it Mineral Plants .
IV .
A Bluish soft Clay .
V. A fine-grained Gray Stone : It lies next the former , and is found in some Pits only .
VI .
A Clay almost like the First , only whiter .
VII .
A hard Gray Rock ; with something like the Impressions of Vegetables , but none distinct .
VIII .
A Blew Clunch , like Numb. 3 .
with Mineral Plants in it .
VIII .
+ .
This Stratum ( which is the same with Numb. 13 .
) was not taken .
IX .
Coal , called Bench-Coal .
X. Coal , less black and shining than the former , called Slipper-Coal .
XI .
Coal , more black and shining , called Spin-Coal .
XII .
A Coal like Canal-Coal , by the Miners called Stone Coal .
These Strata of Coal have between each of them a Bat , of about the thickness of a Crown Piece .
XIII .
A black Substance , called the Dun-Row-Bat .
XIV .
A hard grey Iron Oar , called the Dun-Row Iron-Stone .
XV .
A bluish Bat , in which the following Iron-Stone lies , called the White-Row .
XVI .
A hard blackish Iron Oar , lying in small Nodules , having between them a white Substance ; and from thence by the Miners called the White-Row-Grains , or Iron Stone .
XVII .
A hard grey Iron Oar , with some white spots in it , called the Mid-row Grains .
XVIII .
A black fissile Substance , called the GublinBat .
XIX .
A hard blackish Iron Oar , with white spots in it , called the Gublin Iron-Stone .
XX .
A Bat , in Substance much like that of Numb. XVIII .
XXI .
A hard grey Iron Oar , called the Cannoc , or Cannot-Iron-Stone .
XXII .
A Bat , somewhat harder than Numb. XX .
XXIII .
A dark , gray , hard Iron Oar , called the Rubble Iron-Stone .
XXIV .
The Table-Bat , next under the Rubble IronStone .
XXV .
A coarse sort of Coal , called the Foot-Coal .
XXVI .
A black , brittle , shining Bat .
XXVII .
The Heathen-Coal .
XXVIII .
A Substance like a coarse Coal , but by the Miners called a Bat ; perhaps because it does not burn well .
XXIX .
The Bench-Coal .
XXX .
A Bat under the last , and is as low ( viz. 188~ Feet ) as they generally dig , tho ' there is a coarse Coal under this .
N. B. Those Substances , which divide the Strats of Coals and Iron Oars from each other , are called Bats by the Miners : They are generally black , consisting of a Matter peculiar to themselves , and are of a Texture nearest like Marle ; tho ' some of them are fissile , and others have a Substance not unlike Coal mixed with them .
