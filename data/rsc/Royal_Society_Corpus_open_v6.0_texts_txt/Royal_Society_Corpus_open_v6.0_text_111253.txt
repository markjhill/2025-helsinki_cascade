" On a New Method of propagating Plants .
" By E. J. Lowe , Esq. , F.R.A.S. , F.G.S. &amp;c. Received Nov. 17 , 1853 .
The author states that the experiment of a new method of propagating plants has been so successful , that he has taken the liberty of forwarding to the Royal Society this short paper upon the subject , for the guidance of those who are interested in the advance of horticulture .
It had occurred to him , that if a cutting of a plant were sealed at the base , so as to exclude the moisture of the soil from ascending the stem in injurious quantities , the method of striking cuttings of most species of plants would not be so precarious a process:as at present ; and accordingly some collodion was obtained in order to make the experiment .
With respect to this new process , he states , that immediately upon the cutting being severed from the parent stem , the collodion was applied to the wound , and then left a few seconds to dry , after which the cuttings were potted in the ordinary manner .
To test the value of this new process more effectually , duplicates of all the species experimented upon were at the same time similarly planted , without the collodion being applied to them .
Experiments were carried on in two different ways ; one batch of cuttings being placed on a hot-bed , whilst a second batch was planted in the open ground , without even the protection of glass .

Notwithstanding the season being too far advanced for the full benefit of the process to be thoroughly observed , still twice as many cuttings took root treated by the new method as had rooted by the old .
The mortalityin the open ground was increased by slugs having eaten off above the soil some of the cuttings ; those thus damaged were examined after they had been in the ground a month , and it was found that the collodion was quite as sound as when first applied .
It would therefore appear that the collodion seals the wound of the cutting , and protects it from the fatal effects of.damp , until roots are prepared to force through the covering of gun-cotton.:It is further stated , that the application of this solution has been found to be exceedingly beneficial in the pruning of such plants as Euphorbia speciosa , Impatiens latifolia , Impatiens latifolia-alba , Hoya bella , Hoya imperialis , &amp;c. , the cut branches being prevented from bleeding .
It is the author 's intention next spring to follow out this experiment , in budding and grafting , as he considers that it will also be useful in this branch of horticulture .
Gutta-percha , dissolved in oether , was in some instances substituted to heal the wounds caused by pruning ; yet owing to this solution not drying , as rapidly as collodion , the first , and sometimes the second application was not sufficient .
The effect of these solutions upon cut flowers was very marked .
Two branches were gathered as nearly alike as possible ; to the flower-stalks of the one , collodion was applied .
These flowers were placed in vases filled with water ; those coated over with collodion began to fade in thirty-six hours , and many were quite dead in three days whilst the flowers merely placed in water in the ordinary manner remained fresh and healthy .
Those that faded soonest were Reseda odorata and Tropceolum majus , and those which were least affected were Tagetes erecta and Senecio erubescens .
