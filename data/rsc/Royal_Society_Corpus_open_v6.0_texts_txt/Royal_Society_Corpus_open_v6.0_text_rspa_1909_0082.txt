Attention has been called by Rayleigh in a paper cited below to the , ease with which the general nature of the aberrations of optical instruments can be discussed by means of a modified characteristic function .
The object of the present paper is to work this method in more detail in order to get a complete account of the aberrations and to connect it with the known method of calculating the aberrations of a particular system .
We write down the doubly modified function in S2 , and in S3 deduce from it the singly modified function used in the rest of the paper .
The meanings of the coefficients aoe given in S4 .
Attention having been called in S5 to some features that limit the usefulness of the method , a new expansion of more practical value is found in S6 .
The meanings of the of this expression are given in detail in S7 , and some relations between them .
between the spherical aberration , coma , etc. ) in S8 .
The numerical calculation is discussed in S9 .
In S10 another method of calculating the characteristic function is sketched out .
S* 2 .
The characteristic function , strictly so called , is the integral of taken ' .
along the path of a ray of light from a point in the initial medium to another say in the final medium , the integral being .
expressed in terms of these six co-ordinates .
the initial and final media to .
have refractive index unity , we have , etc. , , etc. ,
