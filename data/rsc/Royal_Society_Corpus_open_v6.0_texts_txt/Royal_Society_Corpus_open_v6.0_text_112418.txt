I. " Preliminary Notice on the Mineral Constituents of the Breitenbach Meteorite .
" By Professor N. STORY MASKELYNE , M.A. Communicated by Professor WARINGTON W. SMYTH , F.R.S. Received March 2 , 1869 .
This meteorite , which belongs to the rare class intermediate between meteoric irons or siderites and meteoric stones or anrolites ( a class to [ Apr. 8 , 370 which I applied some years since the term siderolites ) , was found in Breitenbach in Bohemia .
It is a spongy metallic mass , very similar to the siderolite of Rittersgriin in Saxony , the hollows in the iron being filled by a mixture of crystalline minerals .
These minerals are two in number ; and the present notice deals with these two minerals .
1 .
One of them is of a pale-green colour , crystallizing in the prismatic system , and presenting at once the formula of an augitic mineral and a crystalline form nearly approximating to that of olivine .
Dr. Viktor von Lang , when my colleague at the British Museum , measured some merohedral crystals of this mineral , and obtained for its elements a : : c=0-8757 : 0-8496:1 , 0/ 110.010 = 44 8 101.100 = 41 11 104.100 = 74 3 011.010 = 40 16 The analysis of this green mineral gave , from 0'4127 grm. , per cent. Oxygen-ratios .
Equivalent ratios .

00560 13-583 3-018 0-37J 0-4122 99-899 results which correspond very nearly with an Enstatite of the formula ( Mg , Fe ) SiO , .
The specific gravity is 3'23 .
It is remarkable that of the minerals presenting the general formula M SiO , , where M stands for one or more metals of the calcium and magnesium groups , we are acquainted with two anorthic types ( Rhodonite and Babingtonite ) ; three oblique types , those , namely , of Wollastonite , of Hornblende , and of Augite ; two prismatic types , those , namely , of Enstatite and Anthophyllite , homceomorphous with the oblique Augites and Hornblendes ; and to these we shall have now to add ( if the measurements of Dr. Lang shall prove to be distinct from those of Enstatite ) a third , in the green mineral under description .
Of these , the prismatic types are essentially those of the magnesian group .
The rest , with the exception of the calcium silicate ( Wollastonite ) , are types belonging to the mixed groups .

The other mineral is one of very great interest .
It is , in short , silica crystallized in forms and in a system distinct from quartz , and possibly is tridymite .
In bulk it forms about a third part of the mixed crystalline mass .
The crystals are very imperfect , and are twinned : but there are two cleavages parallel to the planes of a prism of about 119 ?
; and , on looking through a plane that is perpendicular to this zone , it is seen that the crystal is biaxial .
The normal to this plane is parallel to the second mean line , the optical character being negative .
A section made for examination in the microscope showed two small crystals in which light traverses the section with equal brilliancy during its rotation between crossed Nicol prisms .
This , and possibly a similar case recorded by Vom Rath , seems to result from the section being cut parallel to a composite portion of the crystal .
The analysis of the mineral gave , by distillation of the silica as silicic difluoride , and subsequent determination as potassic fluosilicate , 97'43 per cent. of silica , the remainder being oxide of iron and lime .
Thus 0-3114 grm. gave : per cent. Silica ... . .
03034 97-43 Ferric oxide ... ... 0-0035 1-124 Lime ... ... ... 0'0018 0-578 0-3087 99'132 A second analysis gave 99*21 per cent. silica , 0'79 of residue .
Its specific gravity , as determined from a very small amount of the mineral picked under the microscope , was 2-18 ; a second determination made on a larger amount gave the value 2-245 .
That of tridymite is 2'295 to 2'3 .
This may be taken as evidence that the mineral is not quartz , the specific gravity of which is 2-65 .
Vom Rath 's experiments were made on a rather less pure form of tridymite .
There can be no doubt from these results , further details of which shall be shortly laid before the Society , that this mineral is silica in the form of its allotropic condition and lower density .
It may possibly be the mineral to which Vom Rath has given the name of Tridymite ; the crystalline system , however , of Tridymite , as given by Vom Rath , does not accord with the above facts .
