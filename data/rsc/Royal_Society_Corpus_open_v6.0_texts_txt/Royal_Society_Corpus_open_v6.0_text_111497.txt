( Abstract .
) The author states that the principal object of this memoir is to set forth two new methods of treating the dynamical equations by processes of variation of elements , differing from the ordinary processes of this nature principally in this particular , that the variations are represented in explicit terms of the elements themselves and of the time , and not through the medium of partial differential coefficients .
It has been his object to render the processes as elementary as possible ; and to preserve them in a vigorous form , by postponing all attempts at approximation until the formulae are actually applied to practical problems .
The applications given in the paper comprise the circular and spherical pendulums , and the planetary and lunar theories , and a special theorem as to the movement of the plane of a planet 's motion under the influence of several other planets .
The original normal problem which is taken as the basis , is that of motion about a fixed centre of force , where the force is directly as the distance ; or , in other words , the system of equations not exceeding three in number , of the form x " -+n2==O ; whose solutions are represented under the form =X= , a a cos ( nt-p ) +p ) sin ( nt+p ) , y==X , a cos ( nt+p ) b6 sill ( ntp ) , z=X\ a cos ( nt+p ) +ple b sin ( nt-+ ) ; where ha= cos cos -sin p sin 4 cos 1 , Xb= cos sin ?
+ sin p cos 4 cos 1 , XeC== sin p sin 1 ; a=-sin p Cos 4 Cos p sin ; cos l , pb= sin q siln + cos cos 4 cos l , p= cos sin 1 ; to which are afterwards added , Va= sin 4 sin 1 , b= cos 4 sin 1 , jc== Cos 1 .
These are the equations of an ellipse whose centre is at the force , and situated in a plane inclined at the angle I to the plane of x y , and the longitude of whose node is 4 ; and q is the angular distance of the major axis of the ellipse from the node ; a and b are the semiaxes of the ellipse ; and p is the angular distance , from the major axis , of the zero-point of the motion , measured on the circle described on the major axis .
A uniform motion around the circle represents the place of the body by the corresponding point on the ellipse , where it is cut by a perpendicular dropped on the major axis .
If the force be not situated at the origin , but at the point ( X , Y , Z ) , we have merely to substitute x-X for x , &amp;c. in the above equations of motion and solutions .
Applying the method of tangential variation to the system x"t+ x=0 , &amp;c. , r6 we perceive that this system admits of complete solution in finite terms , leading in fact to the usual theory of elliptical motion .
Taking this system , therefore , as a normal system , the author proceeds to deduce the formulae for the variation of the elements of this system , in order to arrive at the solution of the system x"+ ~x=P , &amp;c. The elements which have been selected , for reasons fully explained in the paper , are I and 4 , whose meanings are already known ; A and Nr denoting respectively the mean distance , and the longitude of the epoch measured in the plane of the tangential ellipse as it exists at the time t , and measured from the node at that time ; and e and wz denoting respectively the eccentricity of the tangential ellipse , and the longitude of its perihelion measured as above ; and it is observed that these are strictly normal elements , according to Professor Donkin 's definition of normal elements .
The variations of these elements are then rigorously found , and are expressed as follows:-Denote cos 4 P. + sin 4 Pie by the symbol Pt , and cos I ( cos bP.--sin 4P1 ) + P , sin I by the symbol P ; and let -Pt sin + P , cos 0= P , ; -Pt sin w+ P^ cos w= P ; , ; Pt cos 0+ P , sin 0= P , , ; Pt cos zr + P. sin w= PI , o ; then r cos 0 NA2(1 _-e2)( , r sin 0 sin =(1.e)( , e= NA2(1 2 ) { ( cosO-w)+)t 1 +)+ecos)-))Pt , } e( + cos )-NA2(_e2 i sin(0-w)P , o0-(l+ecos(0-w ) ) P , .
, A=N(1 -2 e)(P't,0 +e Pt , + ) 3(N(t+r))=-N e -sin ( 0-)Pt,0+(l+ecos(0-w))P 2-2eP P } ; which are capable of being expanded in terms of the elements , and t by means of the ordinary expressions for r , 0 , and 0-in terms of the same quantities .
The values of the elements at the time t being supposed to be found , by the integration of these formulae , in terms of t , and their initial values , are to be substituted in the ordinary expressions for the coordinates , so as to obtain their values at the time t. The author exhibits the application of the preceding formulae to certain simple examples , and then proceeds to apply them to the planetary theory .
For two planets ( distinguished by the suffixes 2 and 3 ) supposed to move in the same plane , the following are the rigorous expressions for the variations .
Let a2 and %a be the ratio of the mass of each planet to that of the central body .
Let P denote the cube of r3--.r23 , and let ( P-l ) sin ( 03-02 ) be called Q , and ( P1 ) cos ( 03--02 , )-P be called R ; then N2A2r2 { e2=43rs(ie2 ) { ( cos ( 02-W2 ) ( 2+e2 cos ( 02--2))+ e2 ) Q+sin ( 02-w2 ) ( + e2 cos ( 02-2))R } e2 N1 .
{ sin ( 2--2 ) ( 2 + cos ( 02 ) ) Q-cos ( 02- ) ( 1 e2 cos ( 02W2 ) ) R }.A =2cx N 2A =2a2( )( +e2os(O22 ) ) Q+esin ( 02-2)-}R S(N(t +r ) ) =-(1 -e )r -2 N2A22R .
K3 From these formule , the secular variations of the elements are obtained without difficulty ; and a new method of integrating the equations for the variations of the eccentricity and longitude of perihelion is given .
The author then enters upon a minute examination of the mathematical character of secular variations , and their bearing tpon the methods of approximation to which the problem of three bodies has given rise .
It is pointed out that the disturbance finally effected through the medium of a secular variation is not of the order of the disturbing force , or rather of the ratio of the disturbing force to the central force ; but that it may remain precisely the same , though this ratio should be diminished or increased without limit .
The difference affects not the aggregate amount of deviation or disturbance caused , but the time in which this aggregate amount is produced .
If we consider the undisturbed problem of two planets about a sun as representing motion in two planes inclined to each other at the angle I , and in ellipses having eccentricities e2 and es , it is shown that , no matter how small or how large may be the disturbing force produced on each orbit by the other planet , the aggregate amount of disturbance of the planet mn , is of the order of the quantities I and e2 , and that of the planet m3 , of the order of I and e3 .
From considerations of this nature , which are dwelt upon at length in the memoir , the author concludes that the ordinary direct methods of solution by approximation , being based upon the erroneous assumption that the variations of the coordinates are of the order of the disturbing force , are not , in a mathematical sense , legitimate processes ; and that , in the planetary theory , they produce results practically true only on account of the minuteness of the disturbing forces , and the consequent great length of the secular periods ; and that , in the lunar theory , their failure is made evident , in consequence of the comparatively large magnitude of the disturbing force , and the consequent rapidity with which the elements of the moon 's orbit pass through their secular periods .
The formulae for the variations of the elements are then applied to the lunar theory ; and some of the integrations are effected by means of a lemma containing the solution of the differential equation dt-=F cos ( pt-q " ) ( where F , p and q are numerical coefficients ) , in the form qF +Fp cos Mt q2rF2 ) , Cos ( lot-qo ) ) being ( 1 )P c ?
s(p--)=p+qF cos M ' being ( ----)p .
By this method , the total motion of the moon 's perigee , as well as the coefficients of the evection , are fully obtained in the first instance , without the necessity of any second approximation ; and the usual difficulty as to the movement of the perigee does not present itself .
The motion of the node , and the evection in latitude , are correctly obtained in a similar manner .
This part of the memoir is concluded by an extension of the general formulae for the tangential variation of elements to the case in which we suppose the constant , u to become variable , the result being to add to each variation a term involving c~i .
The third part of the Paper contains the development of the method of osculating variation , before briefly described ; from which are deduced the formulae for the osculating variations of elliptic elements .
This method is capable of being applied to the planetary and lunar theories , as well as that of tangential variation ; but the advantages of this method did not appear to be such as to justify the actual expansion of the formulae for these theories .
The author , however , shows that with reference to any system of three bodies , the equations of motion for each body naturally assume the form X " +2(--X)=0 , &amp;c. ( being the system solved by this method ) ; and that the X , Y , and Z are absolutely the same for each of the three bodies .
This is shown by demonstrating , that at any given moment the three lines which represent the direction of the force acting on each of the three bodies all pass through the same point , which is denominated the centre of force .
The coordinates of this common centre of force are , ( 23)x , + ( 31)2 + ( 12)x3 ( 23 ) +(31 ) +12 with similar expressions for Y and Z ; ( 12 ) being r,2m m%r2 , X denoting the law of force , &amp;c. Each body has its own value of n2 ; their ratios being denoted by the proportion '2 n ?

r23 r31 l 12 123 X%23 Xr31 Xr1 , The invariable plane of this system of three bodies is then found ; and it is shown that the nodes of the three orbits upon this plane are always in a certain relative position , constituting a kind of triangle of equilibrium about the centre of force ; resulting , in the limiting case where one of the three bodies is infinitely larger than the other two ( or in what is denominated the undisturbed Problem of Three Bodies ) , in an exact opposition of the two nodes of the orbits of the latter two bodies upon the invariable plane of the system .
The formulae for the osculating variation of elements are then applied to a system of three bodies , of which one possesses a predominating magnitude , so far as is necessary to determine the movement of the planes of the orbits ; and it is readily shown that , if we consider only the first order of the disturbing force , the inclination of the plane of each orbit to the invariable plane is absolutely constant ; and that the two nodes are always in opposition to each other , and move with a uniform angular velocity round the invariable plane .
This theorem is then extended to a system of n bodies moving about a central predominant body ; and it is shown that the aggregate effect of the disturbing forces of such a system upon the plane of any one of the bodies can always be represented by stating that its node upon a certain fixed plane revolves with a uniform angular velocity , the plane of the orbit always remaining at the same inclination to the fixed plane .
The rate of this angular movement , and the coordinates of the fixed plane upon which the movement takes place , are found by means of formulae of remarkable simplicity .
These three quantities may be ascertained once for all for each planet ( viz. the inclination of the fixed plane on which the node moves to any coordinate plane , the longitude of the node of the fixed plane in relation to any coordinate line , and the angular rate of movement of the node of the orbit upon this fixed plane ) , and , when once ascertained , may be regarded as fixed elements of the planet , from which the position of the plane of its orbit can always be determined without the use of tables .
It is then shown that a system of the form x+ n2x= PZ , &amp;c. , where n2 and P , , Pie , and Pz are any variables , may be solved by the same set of final integrals , and the same values of x ' , y ' , and z ' , by supposing the elements a , b , z , 4t , z , I , and p to become variable .
These elements are those of an ellipse tangential to the actual curve of motion ; and the following formulae are obtained for their variation : Let Xa Px+ b Pie +x Pr=(P , ) , ILaP.+PbPy +4P+P=( Pie ) , " la Pr +tb Pie +'e Pz= ( Prz ) ' ' P , +s ^ Pie + 8cP==(P ) ; and let ( putting T for nt+p ) a cos 9 cos Tb siln p sin T= , a sin p cos T+b cos 9 sin T-= , ; then nab I-= ( P , ) , nab sin 1 a ; =-r(PI ) , ( nab)= a cos T( Pie )-b sin T(P , ) , X2(a + 62 ) ( -sin T ) cos T( Pie ) ) +a nn ' , 1 Ut ( a2b2 ) ( ~ + cos 1 )-)=-(b cos T(P , )a sin T( Pie ) ) + 2a b sin T cos T- , 1 U'f ( a262 ) 3(nt + p)=-(a cos T(P2 , )b sin T( Pie ))(a2 + 62 ) sin T cos Tn It may be observed that E and ?
are coordinates of the body referred to the plane of the tangential ellipse , and to an axis of X coinciding with the node .
This method is denominated the method of Tangential Variation ; and it is applied directly to the problem of the circular pendulum , that of the spherical pendulum , and that of the motion of a particle where the force is a function of the distance , and in particular that of elliptical motion , where the law of force is that of the inverse square .
In a subsequent part of the paper it is shown that a system of the form " + n2( , v -X ) O , &amp;c. , where n2 , X , Y , and Z are any variables , may be solved by the same set of final integrals , and the same values of x ' , y ' , and zf as those which have been already given as the solutions of the same system when n , X , Y , and Z are constant , by supposing the elements to become variable .
In such a case , the elements are those of an ellipse osculating with the actual curve of motion , always of course having its centre at the moveable point ( X Y Z ) .
The following formulae are obtained for the variation of these elements : Let X , X'+ XbY'+ Z ' = ( X ) , PrX'+PyT +Y+ j= ( Y ' ) , )'aX ' Jr bY + LcZ=(Z ) ; then naib 1/ =(Z ) , , nab sin I= =(Z')d , ) $(nab)= -n((X ' ) 6 cos T+(Y ' ) a sin T ) , i(n'(a'+ b2))= -n2((X ' ) a cos T+ ( Y ) b sin T)+r'n !

This method is denominated the method of Osculating Variation .
