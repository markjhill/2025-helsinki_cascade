" On the Elliptic Polarization of Light by reflexion from Metallic Surfaces .
" By the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
In a former paper , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1843 , the author gave an account of the observations he had made on the phanomena of elliptic polarization by reflexion from certain metallic surfaces , but with reference only to one class of comparative results .
He has since pursued the inquiry into other relations besides those at first contemplated , and the present paper is devoted to the details of these new observations , obtained by varying the inclination of the incident rays , and the position of the plane of analysation , and by employing different metals as the reflecting surfaces .
By the application of the undulatory theory of light to the circumstances of the experiments and the resulting phmenoniena , the law of metallic retardation is made the subject of analytic investigation .
A polariscope of peculiar construction , of which a description is given at the conclusion of the paper , was employed in the experiments : and tables are subjoined of the numerical results of the observations .
