On the Quantity of Carbon in carbonic Acid , and on the Natzure of the Diamond .
By William Allen , Esq. F. L. S. and William Hasledine Pepys , Esq. Communicated by Humphry Davy , Esq. Sec. R. S. M. R. L A. Read June 18 , 1807 .
THE estimates of the quantity of real carbon in carbonic acid diflfring very widely , and the experiments of GUYTON DE MORVEAU upon the combustion of the diamond , detailed in the 31st volume of the Annals de Chimie , being liable to some objections from the manner in which the operations were conducted , we determined to institute a set of experiments , in order , if possible , to settle the question .
LAVOISIER , from the result of experiments apparently conducted with much accuracy , concluded that every hundred parts by weight of carbonic acid consisted of 28 carbon and 72 oxygene .
This was in a great degree confirmed by the very valuable researches of SMITHSON TENANT , Esq. on the nature of the diamond , an account of which is printed in the Transactions of this Society for the year 1797 , and which were made previously to the experiments of GUYTON ; but notwithstanding this , the result of GUYTON 's experiment , which only allowed 17,88 per cent. of carbon to carbonic acid , has been adopted in all the systems of chemistry to the present time .
In researches of this nature , the results are much influenced by slight variations in the quality of the gas ; but having had repeated experience of the accuracy of the eudiometer described in No. XI-I of this volume , we were enabled to proceed in this respect with great confidence .
Our object was , to consume certain known quantities of diamond and other carbonaceous substances in oxygene gas , and we-atrfirst determined to employ the sun 's rays , by means of a powerful lens ; but : considering the uncertainty of a favourable opportunity in this country , and at the season in which our experiments were made , we resolved to employ the apparatus represented by the drawing .
Description of the Apparatus .
This consisted of two mercurial gasometers , fig. i and 2 , each capabe of containing from 70 to 8o cubic inches of gas .
The internal cylinder CC is of cast iron , and solid , except the perfrationa through its middle ; the external cylinder is also of cast iron ; and the glass receiver slides , up and down in the space betweet them , which is filled with mercury : not more than sixteen pounds are required for each , and the small bath B ; fig.i ; To0 , t t top of each receiver , a graduated scale or register H , is screwed , showing the number of cubic inches of gas , measuring from the upper edge of the external iron cylinder .
The level of the mercury is ascertained by a small glass gauge .
The : registers were graduated by throwing up one cubic inch of gas at a time .
The gasometers stand upon mahogany stools , perforated for a socket , to which , according to the nature of the experiment , a small receiver R , or the triple socket TS , or any other combination , may be united .
P represents the platina tube with its furnance ; the ends orf the tube are mounted with female screws of brass , to one of which the acommodating screw socket AS was joined .
T is a double section of the platina tray which contained the substances to be heated .
During their combustion , it was made to slide easily within the platina-tube P. The accommodating socket and platina tray , are drawn considerably larger in proportion than the instrument .
By means of the triple socket and the cocks , the gas was made to pass freely over the substances in combustion , from one gasometer to the other ; and by shutting off the communication with the platina tube , while that with the small receiver was open , any portion of gas in the gasometer , fig. i. might be transferred into eudiometers or measures standing in the mercury:bath M , for examination .
In order to discover whether the several sockets were airtight , after the apparatus was put together , the communication with the gasometer , fig. i , was closed , and the other communications opened ; the receiver of the gasometer , fig , 2 , being raised , drew up a column of mercury in the small receiver R , equal to two inches : the communication with the gasometer was then closed , and the column was supported without alteration .
This was always tried previous to , and after every experiment .
As the joints would bear this degree of exhaustion , we were confident they would resist a much greater pressure than we had any occasion to employ .
The glass tubes GG , which connected the platina tube with the gasometers , enabled us to observe any flash arising from the combustion of hydrogene which might be contained in the substances subjected to experiment .
In order to avoid prolixity , we shall generally state the method which was invariably followed .
We soon dfound that oxygene gas , evetn when secured in bottles with ground glass stoppers , was not:always to be depended upon , but was sensibly deteriorated by keeping ; and therefore in all our experiments we made the gas within an hour or two of the time of using it , and always from the hyperoxygenised muriate of potash .
Its degree of purity was constantly ascertained by the eudiometer before every experiment , and was generally determined in about 1o minutes .
The solution employed was that recommended by Professor DAVY ; namely , the solution of green sulphate of iron saturated with nitrous gas ; and whenever the diminution had arrived at its maximum , and the gas began to increase in volume , we substituted a simple solution of the green sulphate ofiron for that saturated with nitrous gas , and -always had the most satisfactory results : for the simple sulphate absorbs iany nitrous gas Which may have escapedfrom the saturated solution , and the residuum in this case enables us to ascertainexactly the quantity of oxygene contained in the gas.:We determined to -make our first experiment with charcoal , and as MoRozzo and RouPPE , had:ascertained the absorbing properties of this substance , and as our results must obviously be influenced by it , our attention was directed to this pdint , :the following quantities of diffieent kinds of wood , sawedinto slips : of an inch were weighed .
White Fir , 3oo0grains .
Lignum Vitae , 800 Box 400 Beech 500 English Oak , 250 Mahogany 200 * This solution absorbs oxygene much more rapidly in warm weather than in cold , 070 ^tOllz IN mbw A. d These : sips were:pn:into smallt cruchbIs , a-d-:compeely covered with , dry satn$ Heat:$s very gradually applied at first , until the volatile parts were deisspated ; they were then kept about 40 minutes in a white heat .
On being collected and weighed , while still warm , the charcoal from each was as follows : Fir , 54,5 grs. equal to 18,17 per cent. Ligpum Vita , 138 17 , '5 Box 81 o,5 Beech 15 Oak 43,5 17,40 Mahogany 315 15,75 These being exposed to the air during one week , increased in weight thus : Fir , 13 per cent. Lignum Vitze , 9,6 Box 14 Beech 16,3 Oak 6 , Mahogany 18 Certain quantitiesbeing confined in common air increased very little in weight , and all in the same proportion ; we are therefore much inclined to think that this increase is owing to an absorptionofwater from the air ; and we repeatedly found that the greatest increase of weight took place in the first hour or two after exposure , and arrived at its maximum in less than e4 hours , as the following experiment , selected from several others , will prove .
40 grains of charcoal from wlwow wood , which had been put into a. bttle with agrowid glass sto ermmediat afterr they Nn2 All were removed from the fire , were exposed in the scale of a delicate balance , in a room where the thermometer was 62'FAHRENHEIT , barometer 3o,26 .

Hence charcoal seems to act as an hygrometer : its greatest increase was 5 grains on 40 , or 12 per cent. And in order to ascertain to what the increase of weight was owing , we put ' 7,5 grains of charcoal , which hadbeen thus exposed ) into a small bottle and tube conn:ected with a receiver standing in the mercury bath , the whole of the vessels being also filled with mercury in order to exclude common air .
Heat applied by an ARGAND'S lamp produced gas equal to about half the bulk of the charcoal ; but as soon as the temperature of the mercury rose to 214 ?
FAHRENHEIT , elastic fluid streamed from every piece of charcoal , which quickly condensed , and 1 inch of the tube was occupied with water .
This proved that our suspicion of the increase of weight being principally attributable to water , was well founded .
The result of these , and other experiments , plainly pointed out the precautions which were necessary in order to obtain an accurate result with charcoal ; for if we had weighed 4 grains of the charcoal a few hours after it was made , we should only in fact have had 3,5 grains of real charcoal , and our calculations would have been erroneous .
To avoid this source of error , we subjected our charcoal to a red heat immediately before using it , and also weighed it as speedily as possible ; in fact , while it was still warm .
It may be proper to state , that our weights were such as we could thoroughly depend upon .
The volume of gas being so much influenced by temperature and pressure , these were noted during every experiment ; and thermometer 60o FAHRENHEIT , barmometer 30 ?
, were assumed as the standard .
GAY LUSsAC remarks , that from o ?
to '21 FAHRENHEIT , dry air expands 0,002o8 , or 48 part of its bulk for every degree of the thermometer .
DALTON makes it , oo00207 , or --3 part ; we therefore divided the whole quantity of gas by 480 , and multiplied the quotient by the degrees of difference under 60 ? .
It being of great consequence in these experiments to know the exact weight of a-given quantity of oxygene and carbonic acid gases , we resolved to examine for ourselves , whether the statements already given were quite correct , and accordingly made carbonic acid over mercury from Carrara marble and diluted sulphuric acid , which being tried with lime water in PEPys 's eudiometer , was all absorbed in 3 minutes except I part in i oo .
We used two charges of lime water , though one would have been sufficient .
A glass globe being exhausted by an excellent air pump , was exactly balanced on a beam sensible to a minute portion of a grain ; then being screwed upon one of the glass receivers of the mercurial gasometer previously filled with carbonic acid gas , 21 cubic inches entered .
The globe was now increased in weight by 10,2 grains .
In order to be certain we repeated the experiment , with exactly the same results .
The 21 cubic inches were to be brought to : the mean temperature and pressure , as the thermometer stood at 44 ?

21,58 : 10,2 : : 0oo : 47,26 Consequently 1oo cubic inches of carbonic acid gas at mean temperature and pressure weigh 47 , a6 grains .
We next tried oxygene gas from the hyperoxygenised muriate of potash made over-mercury , and which by the eudiometer left only a residuum of 2 parts in oo .
The glass globe exhausted as before , and weighed , was screwed on to the glass receiver of the mercurial gasometer containing oxygene , and 21 cubic incles entered , by which it increased in weight 7,3 grains .
This experiment was repeated with exactly the same result .
The thermometer and barometer remainingrth same , we.take.the volume as before corrected .

After these experiments , we examined DAvY 's researches on nitrous oxyde , and had the satisfaction to find that his estimate , both of carbonic acid and oxygene gases , agreed almost exactly with ours .
The next point was to ascertain whether lime water would take the whole of the carbonic acid gas from .
a mixture with oxygene , or common air ; we therefore mixed a known quantity of carbonic acid gas with a certain quantity of common air , and-on trying it with our eudiometer and lime water , the whole of the carbonic acid gas was in a short time absorbed .
We also found , that though the solution of green sulphate saturated with nitrous .
gas would not take -up the whole of the carbonic acid .
gas , yet the simple green sulphate , merely by its water of solution , absorbed it very readily .
It may be proper to notice here , thatthough we repeatedly tried the oxygene procured from hyperoxygenised muriate of potash:by the eudiometer and lime water , it never gave the least trace of carbonic acid .
Experiment with Charcoalfrom Box-wood .
The thermometer being at 4 ?
FAHRENHEIT , barometer at 30,2 , wekeptsome box-wood charcoal red hot fora considerable time under sand , and weighed 4 grains as expeditiously as possible ; this being put into the platina tray , was pushed to the middle of the platina tube ; the oxygene ( made from hyperoxygenised muriate of potash over mercury ) was contained in gasometer No. ; No. 2 was empty .
Every thing being adjusted and found perfectly air-tight , the communication with the small receiver R was closed , and the common air contained in the tubes and sockets , amounting only to 2,84 cubic inches , was driven out by a pressure of oxygene from gasometer No. : when several cubic inches had passed into gasometer No. 2 , the gas was let out by opening the cock at the top of its glass receiver , and pressing it down ; the cock being then closed , the gasometer No. a , was completely empty , and the whole of the gas from No. i was driven through the tubes into No. 2 , and back again .
The common air having been previously withdrawn from the small receiver R , we tried the purity of our oxygene by the eudiometer in the manner before described , and found a residuum of 3 parts in 1oo : we then disengaged as much gas as reduced the quantity to 47 cubic inches by the register or scale ; to this must be added the contents of the tubes and sockets 2,84 cubic inches , making the total quantity of oxygene employed 49,84 cubic inches .

The volume , :therefore , at mean pressure and-temperature , would have beeen 5,3 : cubic : inches .
We now lighted a fire in the small black lead furnace under the platina tube , and as soon as it became red hot , opened the cocks ' and passed the gas fromNo .
t No : .
rt , when the charcoal entered into vivid combustion , and heated : the platina tube white hot .
The operation was ; repeated &lt; many times duing 6 or 7 minutes by pressing alternately upon the glasses of the gasometers .
Not the least flash of light was observable in the glass connecting tubes G G , nor the smallest appearance ofmoisture .
The furnace being removed , the tube was now cooled by the application of wet cloths ; and when all was reduced to the temperature of the room , we pressed upon the glass of gasometer No. 2 , so as to force all the gas into No. i. The cock below being closed , we tried the tubes , &amp;c. and found them perfectly air-tight .
We next unscrewed the tube and took out the platina tray ; but it only contained a light white ash , somewhat resembling the shape of the pieces of charcoal , and weighing only,02 of a grain .
On observing the register of No. i , it indicated exactly the quantity of gas that we began with , so that although 3,98 grains of charcoal had been dissolved , the volume of gas was unaltered by it ; a circumstance which had been remarked before by LAVOISIER .
The small receiver R was now nearly full of mercury ; the communication with the gasometer being opened , the large glass receiver was gently pressed upon , until several cubic inches were forced through the receiver R , and tube K , in order to clear the latter of common air .
This , being done , on trying our gas with the eudiometer and lime water , 56 parts were absorbed out of oo .
These of course were carbonic acid gas ; the test for oxygene absorbed 41 , and a residuum of 3 was left , which was exactly what we began with .
Thisis a striking proof that nothing but carbonic acid was produced in the experiment .
1oo : 56 : 52,03 : eg9,13 Then 29,13 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were produced .
00o : 47,26 : 29,13 : 13,76 .
These 29,13 cubicinches of carbonic acid gas would therefore weigh 13,76 grains .
The charcoal weighed 4 grains. .
The residual white ash o , o02 Charcoal consumed 3,98 grains .
Then if 3,76 grains , the weight of the carbonic acid produced , contain 3,98of charcoal , 1oo grains must contain 28 , 92 .
13,76 : 3,98 : 1oo : 28,92 .
Then , according to this experiment , ioo grains of carbonic acid gas contain 28,92 charcoal .
The gas before the experiment consisted of Oxygene,50,47 cubic inches .

Oxygene 21,34Azote 1,56 52,03,.c s79 Now as the volume of gas was unaltered , it will be fair to consider the quantity of oxygene gas consumed as equal to the carbonic acid produced , or 29,13 cubic inches .
Then , if loo cubic inches of oxygene weigh 33,82 grains , 29,1g cubic inches will weigh 9,85 grains .
so : 33,82:* 29,13:9,85 .
Tha weight of oxygene consumed was therefore 9,85 grains .
Charcoal consumed.3,98 Carbonic acid from this statement 13,83 grains , Ditto by calculations on carb. acid gas i3,76,07 S,83 : 3,98 : oo00 : 28,77 .
Thus , calculating by the oxygene consumed , 1 oo grains of carbonic acid gas contain 28,77 charcoal .
First Experiment on Diamond .
Thermometer 560 FAHRENHEIT , barometer 30,20 .
Our oxygene was made as in the former experiment : it contained no carbonic acid ; and on being tried with the impregnated green sulphate , left a residuum of $ parts in ioo .
Having selected nine of the clearest and 'most transparent Brazil diamonds , we found they weighed 3,95 grains .
These were ranged in the platina tray , which was placed in the tube , and the whole apparatus , adjusted as before , was perfectly airtight .
The quantity of oxygene was 49,84 cubic inches , as in the last experiment .
The same precautions were used to secure accuracy in the results as in the former experiment ; and it would only be an upnecessary intrusion on the time of the Society to repeat them .
The platina tube was heated red-hot , 00o and kept so for ten minuites ; , durinLg this time the gas was repeatedly passed from one gasometer to te other ; the tube did not become white hot , as in the experiment with charcoal , because in this case the combustion went on more slowly .
When every thing was cooled to the temperature of the room , the gas was all passed into No. i , by pressing down the receiver of No. 2 , and the volume was precisely the same as when we began the experiment .
On drawing out the tray , we observed that some of the diamonds were reduced to a minute speck , and all of them resembled opake white enamel : there was no discoloration in the tray , nor any residual ash whatever ; the unconsumed parts weighed 1,46 grains ; the original weight was 3,95 1,46 , consequently 2,49 grains were consumed .
We could not perceive any dullness on the surface of the mercury in the gasometers , or any appearance of moisture .
On introducing lime water to ioo parts of the gas in the eudiometer , a dense white precipitate was formed , and 36 parts absorbed ; the test for oxygene absorbed 6o , and a residuum of 4 was left .

Oxygene gas made as usual , left a residuum of 3 parts in 1oo .
Eleven small diamonds , weighing 4 , o1 grains , were put into the tray .
We began with 49,84 cubic inches of oxygene ; and every thing being properly adjusted , kept the platina tube redhot for a quarter of an hour , and during this time the gas was passed from one gasometer to the other , as in the former experiments .
When the tubes , &amp;c. were cooled down-to the temperature of the room , all the gas was transferred to gasometer No. i. and the volume was exactly the same as before the experiment .
On examining the tray , all the diamonds were entirely consumed and not a vestige left .

Then , calculating by the weight of oxygene employed , 0oo grains of carbonic acid contain 28,72 diamond .
The precipitate in lime water from the gas produced in the combustion of diamond , appeared to us denser than that from the combustion of charcoal .
In order to see how far the weight of the precipitate of car .
bonate of lime would agreee with the results of the foregoing experiments , we drew off 20,5 cubic inches of the gas which had been thus altered by the combustion of diamond in the last experiment by the register H , and received it in bottles over mercury ; then admitting lime water , we obtained a copious precipitate of carbonate of lime , which being dried at the temperature of 12 ?
FAHRENHEIT , weighed 12 grains .
But as the 20,5 cubic inches require the same corrections to bring them to the mean temperature and pressure ; we say , as the actual volume of all the gas is to its correction , so is the quantity drawn off to that which it would have been at the mean : 49,84 : 51 , o ' : 2o,5o : l , o6 , the volume after the corrections were made .
Then , to find how much carbonic acid was contained in these 21 , o6 cubic inches , we state it thus : As the total quantity of gas after the experiment is to the total weight of carbonic acid gas found by calculation , so is the quantity of gas experimented upon to the weight of carbonic acid gas which it ought to have contained , 51,20 13,91 : : 21,06 : 5,72 grains .
Every 1oo grains of precipitated carbonate of lime contain 44 grains of carbonic acid ; 12 grains were procured in our experiment .

The tray being placed in the platina tube was heated to redness for ; about o1 minutes .

When all was cool , the original quantity was neither increased nor diminished , and on withdrawing the tray we found only,2 of a grain of oxide of iron ; so that this specimen of plumbago contains only 5 per cent. oxide of iron .

Muscular fibre distilled in a coated glass retort left a black shining coal , 4 grains of which were put into the tray .
Our oxygene left a residuum of 2 parts in 1oo .
The tray and its contents being placed in the platina tube , was heated to redness for 8 minutes , The first time the gas was passed , a lambent flame filled the whole length of the glass tube , and the gas became turbid or milky .
It was passed frequently through the heated tube , but we observed no repetition of the flashes .
Hence we conjecture that if the diamond had contained hydrogene , we should probably have had a similar appearance .
After the experiment all the apparatus was , as usual , perfectly tight , and the volume of gas unaltered .
On examining the platina tray a minute portion of charcoal remained , and a quantity of saline matter adhered to it so firmly , that it became difficult to ascertain the quantity of carbon consumed , and we forbore to make the calculation ; we however examined the gas .

Some of the animal charcoal of last experiment was heated to redness under sand for one hour .
4 grains were placed in the platina tray ; and as we were so much embarrassed in the last experiment with the saline matter which adhered to the tray , we exactly balanced it with its : contefts .
: r oxygene , made as usual , left a residuum of 2 parts in r0oo , and we began with 49,84 cubic inches .
When everything was adjusted , and the platina tube red hot , on passing the oxygene , flashes resembling lightning ran along the glass tube ; and this was repeated 5 or 6 times .
The whole of the gas became very cloudy , exhibiting a turbid milky appearane .
The tube was rendered : white hot by the combustion of the carbonaceous matter in oxygene .
The fire was kept up about 8 minutes , and the gas passed several times .
When all was cool , we could observe no alteration in the volume of gas by the register .
The tray cotained a mixture of salts ; and being weighed , was lighter by , g 'grains .
This loss was not wholly carbon , for it is well known that animal substance contains a variety of salts , , as phosphates , muriates , &amp;c. some of which , though not volatile in a low red heat , might be decomposed and dissipated in the intense':white heat produced by the combustion of the carbonaceous matter in oxygene ; and we accordingly found the internal parts of the gasometers and tubes very slightly covered with a sort of efflorescence .

charcoal , the calculations gave us in one case 79,7 parts of carbon in loo of carbonicacid , and in the other 30,68 ; but we were not then fully aware of the absorption of water by charcoal , which rendered the quantity of real carbon employed less than indicated by the weight .
Also in another experiment , in which grains of diamond were consumed , the calculation gave us 2,96 per cent. of diamond in carbonic acid ; but apprehending that a slight degree of inaccuracy had crept into this experiment , we have not detailed it with the rest ; but we have thoughtit right to give a simple statement of matters of fact ; in noone instance have we endeavoured to strain or accommodate these to suit any particular theory , being fully aware that every experiment , carefully made and faithfully recorded , will remain an immutable truth to the end of time , while hypotheses are constantly varying , and even the most beautiful theories are liable to change , The experiments above related give us the following results .
By carbonic Acid .
By Oxygene .

See Phil. Trans. 1797 .
This gentleman made his experiment in the following 9Q9 manner .
A quarter of an ounce of nitrate of potash was rendered somewhat alkaline by exposure to heat , in order that it might more readily absorb carbonic acid ; it was then put into a gold tube with Lgrains of diamond , and being subjected to heat , the diamond was converted into carbonic acid , by uniting with the oxygene contained in the nitric acid .
The carbonic acid thus produced combined with the potash , and on pouring a solution of muriate of lime into a solution of this salt , he obtained a precipitate of carbonate of lime : this being decomposed by muriatic acid , gave as : much carbonic acid gas as occupied the space of o,1ounces of water .
The thermometer was at 55 ?
FAHRENHEIT , the barometer 29,80 .
In a second experiment he procured a larger quantity , or equal to lo,3 ounces of water .
If we therefore consider an ounce of wate as consisting of 48o grains , and a cubic inch of water equal to 253 grains , and then make theproper corrections for temperature and pressure , one of his experiments will give about 27 per cent. the other about 27,80 for the carbon in carbonic acid , which is somewhat less than our estimate ; ; but the difference may easily be accounted for , from the different methods employed .
The experiments of GUYTON , as detailed in the Annals de Chimie , vol. XXXI , page 76 , are liable to very strong objections ; but at the same time the candid manner in which he has related every circumstance merits considerable praise .
It is impossible , however , not to observe , that the quantity of gas before and after the experiment could not , from the construction of his apparatus , be very rigorously ascertained .
We object also to nitrous gas as a test for oxygene ; and as it is acknowledged that the wooden support included in the oxygene gas took fire , the product of carbonic acid must have been influenced by it ; so that if no chance of error had existed in estimating the carbonic acid gas from the residuum after barytic water had absorbed a part , still the result would not.have been satisfactory .
The experiments which we have had the honour of laying -before this Society prove several important points : -st .
That the estimate given by LAVOISIER , of 28 parts of carbon in every loo parts of carbonic acid , is very nearly correct ; the mean of our experiments makes it ?
8,6o .
adly .
That the diamond is pure carbon ; for had it contained any notable proportion of hydrogene , it must have been discovered , either by detonating with the oxygene , as in the case of animal charcoal , or by diminishing the quantity of oxygene gas , gdly .
That well burnt charcoal contains no sensible quantity of hydrogene ; but if exposed to the air for a few hours it absorbs moisture , which renders the results uncertain .
4thly .
That.charcoal can no longer be considered .
as an oxide of carbon , because , when prperly prepared , it requires quite as much oxygene for its combustion as the diamond .
This is also the case with stone coal and plumbago .
5thly .
It appears that diamond and all carbonaceous substances ( as far as our present methods of analysis are capable of demonstrating their ' nature ) differ principally from each other in the state of aggregation of their particles .
BERTHOLLET has well remarked , that in proportion as this is stronger , decomposition is more difficult : and hence the variety of temperatures required for the combustion of different inflammable substances .
