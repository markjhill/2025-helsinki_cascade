) In previous papers of this series evidence has been brought forward showing that cholesterol is a substance which is strictly conserved in the animal organism , and that waste of cholesterol can be made up from the food taken by the animal .
Whether cholesterol can , to any extent , be synthesised in the organism from proteins , fats or carbohydrates , it is difficult to ascertain .
It seemed likely that evidence on this point might be obtained by comparing the cholesterol content of eggs and newly hatched chickens , by studying the change of the cholesterol content with growth , and also by ascertaining whether chickens could be reared and would thrive on food deprived of its cholesterol and phytosterol .
Park , * as long ago as 1867 , found that the quantity of matter which could be extracted by both ether and alcohol from the yolk of hen 's eggs diminished during incubation , and he stated that cholesterol changes similarly .
In 1908 , L. B. Mendel and Leavenworthf published the results of some experiments to determine whether cholesterol is produced during the development of the eggs , and found that no increase took place , but that the cholesterol appeared to decrease , in part , in company with the rest of the lipoid substances .
In Part IY of this series Ellis and Gardner* concluded from a large number of analyses of eggs and chickens that in the differentiation of the ovum into the complex aggregates of cells constituting the chicken no formation of cholesterol takes place .
Wrhether the cholesterol of the egg remained unchanged or whether some loss occurred could not be definitely decided .
In this paper we give an account of our experiments on the growth of chickens under various diets , and comparisons of the cholesterol and * Park , ' Hoppe-Seyler 's Medizinisch-chemische Untersuch ungen , ' 1867 , p. 211 ; for lecithin , cf.

Origin and cholesterol ester content of day-old chicks , and chicks at various stages of growth .
Method of Estimation of the Cholesterol .
The weighed chickens were minced in a mincing machine and the minced mass was pounded up in a mortar with sand and sufficient plaster of Paris to cause the whole to set after a time to a dry mass , which was powdered and then extracted with ether in a Soxhlet 's apparatus for about a fortnight .
The ethereal solution of the extract was made up to a known volume and suitable aliquot proportions taken for analysis .
The analyses were made by a modification of Windaus ' digitonin method devised by Fraser and Gardner.* General Plan of Experiments .
Fifty-four white Wyandotte day-old chicks of the same strain were obtained from a dealer and six of these were killed straight away and analysed with the following result .
The weight of the six chickens was 212 grm. , and the extract was made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. of this extract were then taken , and by direct precipitation gave 0'3407 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0'0828 grm. of cholesterol , whilst 100 c.c. after saponification gave 0'49 grm. of the compound corresponding to 0T189 grm. of cholesterol .
The remaining chickens were placed in four pens A , B , C , and D , as nearly as possible under the same conditions , 10 in A , 10 in B , 14 in C , and 14 in D. Each pen consisted of a foster mother , kept at a suitable uniform temperature by electric means , and was provided with a run with a sandy floor in which was placed a trough of water , and in which the animals were fed .
Three diets were made use of .
( 1 ) An ordinary commercial chicken food , of approximately the following composition:\#151 ; Per cent. Per cent. Water ... ... ... ... ... . .
9*65 Fats ... ... ... ... ... 2'25 Proteins ... ... ... ... 22'50 Ash ... ... ... ... ... . .
1'20 Carbohydrates ... ... 64'40 ( 2 ) The same chicken food as the above , which had previously been freed as far as possible from fats , cholesterol and phytosterol .
In this food the percentage of protein was found to be about 19'9 per cent. ( 3 ) The same diet as in ( 2 ) , but with the addition of about 2 per cent , of cholesterol .
In the case of the first two meals given to the chickens , the diet ( 1 ) was * Fraser and Gardner , 'Roy .

231 replaced by ordinary hard-boiled egg , pounded up and moistened with warm water .
Diet ( 2 ) was replaced by the white of egg , and the yolk which had been extracted with ether .
Diet ( 3 ) was replaced by white of egg and extracted yolk to which about 2 per cent , of cholesterol had been added .
Pens A and B.\#151 ; Ten chickens were placed in pen A , weighing altogether 336 grm. After one week the weight of these chicks was 512 grm. ; 10 chickens were placed in B , weighing altogether 346 grm. , and after one week their combined weight was 555 grm. After one week two chickens were taken from pen A and three from pen B , their total weight being 260T grm. These were killed and analysed in the usual way , the total ether extract being then made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. of this extract yielded by direct precipitation 0*228 grm of compound , corresponding to 0 0554 grm. of cholesterol , and after saponification 100 c.c. yielded 0*2908 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0*0706 grm. of cholesterol .
After 14 Days.\#151 ; The eight chickens in pen A weighed 559 grm. , and the seven in pen B weighed 515'3 grm. From pen A three chickens weighing 205*5 grm. were taken , and from pen B two chickens weighing 150 grm. , their total weight being 355*5 grm. These were killed and analysed with the following results:\#151 ; The extract was made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. of this gave by direct precipitation 0*271 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*066 grm. of cholesterol , while after saponification 100 c.c. gave 0*365 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*0887 grm. of cholesterol .
After 21 Days.\#151 ; The five chickens in pen A now weighed 402*9 grm. , and the five in B weighed 496'6 grm. From pen A two chickens were taken , weighing 199T grm. , and from B two chickens weighing 152*5 grm. , their total weight being 35T6 grm. These were killed and analysed in the usual manner , and the ethereal extract made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. of this extract gave by direct precipitation 0*207 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0*0505 grm. of cholesterol , whilst after saponification 100 c.c. gave 0*382 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0'0829 grm. of cholesterol .
After One Month.\#151 ; The three chickens in pen A now weighed 287*5 grm. , and the three in pen B 361 grm. Two chickens were now taken from pen A , weighing 207'7 grin .
, and one chicken from pen B , weighing 103'5 grm. , their total weight being 311*2 grm. These were killed and analysed in the usual manner , and ethereal extract was made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. of this extract were taken , and by direct precipitation gave 0*2 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0*0487 grm. of cholesterol , whilst 100 c.c. after saponification gave 0*2386 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0*058 grm. of cholesterol .

Origin and In Pen 0.\#151 ; Fourteen chicks were in this pen , weighing altogether 766 grin .
One of these died on the seventh day .
Five chickens , including the dead one , were now taken and analysed in the usual way , their combined weight being 250*1 grm. The ethereal extract was made up to 1 litre , and the following results were obtained:\#151 ; 100 c.c. of the solution gave by direct precipitation 0*2767 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0 0551 grm. of cholesterol , whilst after saponification 100 c.c. gave 0*3032 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0*0737 grm. of cholesterol .
After 14 Days.\#151 ; There were now nine chickens in pen C , weighing 657*5 grm. ; four of these , weighing 295*6 grm. , were killed and analysed , the ethereal extract being made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. of this extract gave by direct precipitation 0*1646 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*0400 grm. of cholesterol , while 100 c.c. after saponification gave 0*2341 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*0569 grm. of cholesterol .
After 21 Days.\#151 ; Pen C contained five chickens , weighing altogether 514*8 grm. None were killed this week , and After 28 days the weight of the chickens was 614*5 grm. Three of these , weighing 357*7 grm. , were killed and analysed , and the ethereal extract made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. were taken , and by direct precipitation gave 0*216 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*0525 grm. of cholesterol , and after saponification 100 c.c. gave 0*254 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*0618 grm. of cholesterol .
Pen D.\#151 ; Fourteen chickens , weighing 532*2 grm. , were in this pen to start with .
After 7 days the weight of the chickens was 742*8 grm. Five chickens , weighing 249*8 grm. , were killed and analysed with the following results:\#151 ; The ethereal extract was made up to 1 litre ; 100 c.c. of this extract gave by direct precipitation 0*272 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*0661 grm. of cholesterol , while after saponification 100 c.c. of the extract gave 0*447 grm. of the compound , corresponding to 0*1097 grm. of cholesterol .
After 14 days the nine remaining chickens weighed 587*3 grm. ; four of these , weighing 262 grm. , were now killed and analysed with the following results:\#151 ; The extract was made up to 1 litre , and 100 c.c. gave by direct precipitation 0*2432 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*0511 grm. of cholesterol , while 100 c.c. , after saponification , gave 0*4919 grm. of compound , corresponding to 0*1195 grm. of cholesterol .
After21 days the five remaining chicks weighed 447*3 grm. , and After 28 days their weight was 583*5 grm. ; three of these , weighing 352*5 grin .
, were now killed and analysed with the following results:\#151 ; The extract was made up to 1 litre , 100 c.c. of this gave , by direct precipitation Destiny of Cholesterol in the Animal Organism .

We do not think that the results obtained after the end of the second week are of much value for purposes of comparison , as the individual chickens showed such great variations in size and vigour .
For instance , the odd chicks remaining in pens A , B , and C , at the end of the fifth week , weighed approximately 83 , 159 , and 115 grm. , and the two chicks in pen D 258 grm. Then , again , in pens A and B , where the animals were on the same diet and apparently under similar conditions , the growths showed considerable changes , as evidenced by the following table :\#151 ; Pen A. Pen B. 100 *0 100*0 First week 152 -4 160*4 Second week 208 *0 212*7 Third week 239 *8 287*1 Fourth week 285 *2 347*7 Whether this was due to the individuality of the animals , or whether it was due to differences in the amount of food taken , we are unable to say , as we gave excess of food , but had no means of measuring the amount left over .
An excess of food was given at definite times morning and evening , and the chickens were allowed to eat as much as they wished .
It was impossible , however , to measure the amount of food eaten , owing to the habits of the birds , which trampled the food with the sand and excrement .
It was impossible , therefore , either to estimate the unused food , or to examine the faeces , and it would have been impossible to have reared the chicks in a clean cage without sand , as they would not thrive under these conditions .
Furthermore , the laboratory conditions were not very suitable for healthy growth in prolonged experiments .
The individual variations were , however , not so marked during the first two weeks , and we think that the results obtained with the various diets during this period are fairly comparable .
We give , however , the later analyses for what they are worth .
In Table I we give the weights of the chickens at the various periods of growth , and the weights of cholesterol and cholesterol esters which they contain at those periods , calculated from the above data on the basis of 100 grm. of day-old chick .

Origin and Destiny of Cholesterol in the Animal Organism .
235 Discussion of Results.\#151 ; Dealing only with the results of the first two weeks , it will be seen from the table that , on the ordinary diet , the total cholesterol decreases by about 15 per cent , during the first week , and then increases again during the second week to within about 6 per cent , of the value in the day-old chick ; the free cholesterol shows a similar decrease during the first week , but at the end of the second week has increased again to the original value .
The ester cholesterol also decreases by about 17 per cent , during the first week , but the decrease is much less marked during the second .
In the case of animals fed on the extracted diet , there is a decrease in the total cholesterol during the two weeks , but the decrease during the first week is nearly double that in the second .
This variation in the rate of decrease appears to be due to the ester cholesterol , which shows a marked decrease during the first week , but only a slight change during the second .
The free cholesterol goes down fairly steadily .
In the case of the animals fed on extracted food + cholesterol , the total cholesterol increases during the two weeks , more markedly in the second than in the first .
The cholesterol thus stored up is mainly in the form of esters : these show a marked increase during the two weeks , the increase in the second being double that in the first .
The free cholesterol does not appear to be much affected ; the figures are of much the same order as in the case of the animals on ordinary diet , the main difference being that the decrease noticed during the first week is less marked .
It will be noticed that the rate of growth of the animals in the earlier weeks on the cholesterol diet was slower than in the other cases , but we have no means of forming an opinion as to whether this is due to the diet , or to the amount of food eaten , or to the individuality of the animals .
The day-old chicks , however , in this case were smaller than in the others .
What is the meaning of the high free cholesterol content in the fourth wTeek of the experiment with extracted food we are unable to say , but we cannot attach much value to this particular result for the reasons already stated .
The cholesterol content of the chickens thus appears to depend on the sterol content of the diets , but there is nothing in the figures of the first two weeks to indicate that in the growing animal the organism can synthesise cholesterol .
We have not carried out this investigation in as detailed a manner as was intended at the outset , as the animals did not prove very suitable for the investigation of problems of growth , partly owing to the habits of the birds , rendering it very difficult to control the amount of food taken , and to estimate the excrement , and partly owing to the difficulty of Messrs. W. E. Bullock and W. Cramer .
getting strictly comparable sets of birds .
The laboratory conditions with strict control of diet and proper collection of excrement are not very suitable for keeping birds in health for a prolonged period .
One of us is , however , extending his observations to the study of growing rats , which can be much more suitably reared and controlled , and hopes shortly to be able to publish an account of his experiments .
The results given in this paper , however , taken in conjunction with the fact that , in the differentiation of the ovum into the complex aggregate of cells constituting the chicken , no formation of cholesterol takes place , appear to support the view formerly expressed that cholesterol is not readily synthesised in the organism .
We take this opportunity of expressing our thanks to the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society for assistance in carrying out this work .

Our observations were made on transplantable tumours of mice and rats , which , as we have pointed out in previous papers of this series , are especially suitable for the study of the biochemical problems of growth .
So far as we are aware , neither qualitative nor quantitative observations on the presence of lipoids in these tumours have as yet been made .
