Much chemical and physical research has been devoted to the class of bodies known as essential oils , as , for instance , the investigations of Dr. J. H. Gladstone ( " Journal of the Chemical Society , " vol. xviii , p. 1 ; vol. xxiii , p. 147 ; vol. xxv , p. 1 ) , of Dr. C. R. A. Wright ( " Isomeric Terpenes and their Derivatives , " vol. xxvi , pp. 549 and 686 ; vol. xxvii , pp. 1 , 317 , and 619 ) , and of Dr. W. A. Tilden ( .
cit. , vol. xxviii , pp. 514 and 1258 ) , as well as many others .
It is now well known that essential oils consist for the most part of isomeric hydrocarbons , which may be divided into three polymeric groups , possessing the composition denoted by the formulae\#151 ; c10h16 c15h21 cwh3 ! .
To the first class belong* the hydrocarbons derived from turpentine , orange , nntmeg , myrtle , and several others , while the second group includes the hydrocarbons from rosewood , cubebs , calamus , cascarilla , patchouli , and cloves .
The third group is represented by colophene .
1 hough unknown constitution , these bodies exhibit a close relationship to benzene derivatives .
Many of the oils are articles of great commercial value and consequently are subject to adulteration , a fact which , in addition to the scientific interest they possess , led us to submit a number of specimens to examination in the spectroscope .
We have to acknowledge assistance rendered to us by the kindness of several gentlemen who- supplied us with samples , namely , Dr. GladVOL .

The diagrams which explain the optical , characters of the various substances examined , and particulars concerning which here follow , were made in the same way as those appertaining ' to the Parts I and II of this research .
The wood cuts made from our diagrams have had the light and dark parts reversed , so that they differ from the lithographs of the same character published in the-Phil .
Trans. , Part I , 1879 : they have of course been greatly reduced in dimensions , but not all to the same scale .
The layer of liquid examined was 15 millims. instead of 19 millims. thick .
We have found that the following essential oils and hydrocarbons , transmit continuous spectra:\#151 ; The four isomeric terpenes ( Diagrams 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) prepared by Dr. Tilden\#151 ; Australene , from common turpentine obtained from the Finns Australis .

The four diagrams drawn from the photographs obtained from these substances show the rays transmitted by 15 millims. of the liquid alone and when diluted ; all rays to the right of the curves are those absorbed by the liquid , while those to the left are transmitted .
* This substance has been shown to be chiefly camphene .

\amp ; The general similarity of the curves is a noticeable feature as well as the intensity of the absorption of the extremely refrangible rays .

Isomeric Terpenes .
The ordinates represent the proportions of alcoholic solution containing one volume of the terpene .
Thickness of the layer of liquid = 15 millims. It will be seen too that australene and terebenthene show slightly different curves , the latter being rather less diactinic when diluted 100 an 500 times .
Another difference between these bodies is that one rotates the polarised ray to the right and the other turns it to the left .

This substance is remarkably adiactinic ; even after diluting 20,000 times all rays from the line 18 Gd onward were absorbed .
( Diagram 6 .
) Oil of Juniper ( Mr. Parries).\#151 ; This was not re-distilled .
When diluted 1,000 times , it transmitted very few of the rays beyond line Cd 12 .
When diluted 10,000 times it transmitted the spectrum as far as Gd 24 .

It increased rapidly in transparency on dilution from 50 to 2,000 times , after which stage up to 20,000 times the transparency did not greatly increase .

The first distilled fraction condensed in a turbid state and contained water .
It boiled between 159 ' and 162'*5 .
The second fraction , equal to one-third the whole quantity of liquid , boiled between 1620,5 and 164 ' .
The other three fractions boiled at temperatures ranging between 164 ' and 202 ' , and in addition to these portions there remained a solid residue .
On dilution 1,000 and 5,000 times it proves to be amongst the most diactinic of such substances .

Dilution 1,000 , 2,000 , 4,000 , and 5,000 times yields a series of solutions from which a remarkable curve may be traced , the lengthening of the spectrum being very rapid between the two last points .
Cedrat Hydrocarbon .
( Dr. Gladstone .
) Boiling-point 173 ' to 175'.\#151 ; Dilution to 1,000 , 2,000,5,000 , and 10,000 times yielded a curve somewhat similar to , but less striking than , that derived from the photographs of oil of lavender .
( Diagram 7 .
) Oil of Vitivert(Dr .
Gladstone).\#151 ; Two fractions of this substance were distilled off the specimen , which was small in quantity .
The first part contained a little water , and the oil was yellow ; the second portion was of a peculiar greenish tint , doubtless because of the presence of some blue oil common to camomile and patchouli being here in presence of a yellow oil .
A brown resinous mass was left in the retort .
The fraction photographed boiled between 280 ' and 285 ' .
This is one of those substances which still absorb some of the more refrangible rays even when diluted 30,000 times , while a dilution of 10,000 transmits no rays beyond the line 18 Cd .
( Diagram 7 .
) Oil of Turpentine .
Ho. IY in Dr. Gladstone 's paper , " Journal of the Chemical Society , " vol. xviii , p. 18.\#151 ; This substance had become greatly altered by keeping .
Its original boiling-point was 160 ' C. It had oxidised and no doubt become polymerised , since many fractions with high boiling-points were distilled off .
The following are the boiling-points of different portions of the entire distillate : \#151 ; 150\#151 ; 160 ' , contained water .
160\#151 ; 165 ' , 165\#151 ; 180 ' , 180\#151 ; 205 ' , 205\#151 ; 228 ' , slightly turbid .
228\#151 ; 310 ' , the greater portion boiled between 238 ' and 280 ' .
310\#151 ; 365 ' .
At 320 ' the liquid was greenish in colour , and at 365 ' a yellowish-green vapour was evolved .
The oxidised products evidently split up by the action of heat with the production of water and a hydrocarbon .
The fraction boiling between 228 ' and 310 ' was very much more soluble in alcohol containing 30 per cent , of water than that with a boiling-point of 160\#151 ; 165 ' .
The fraction boiling between 228 ' and 310 ' did not transmit ray 12 Cd when diluted 1,000 times , and the spectrum was cut off at line 17 Cd , after diluting with 10,000 volumes of alcohol .
The fraction boiling above 365 ' did not differ much from the preceding till a dilution with 10,000 volumes of alcohol was reached .
Examination of Essential Oils .
\lt ; \gt ; The spectrum , however , terminated a little beyond 18 Cd only after diluting 30,000 times .
( Diagram 7 .
) Oil of Cubebs ( Mr. Farries).\#151 ; There were two portions of this oil , one boiling at 260\#151 ; 265 ' , the other between 266 ; \#151 ; 275 ' .
The first was examined , when diluted 1,000 and 5,000 times ; the second portion after diluting 5,000 , 10,000 , 20,000 , and 50,000 times .
As far as line Cd 17 the spectrum was freely transmitted , but a dilution of 10,000 times only feebly transmitted the more refrangible rays .
( Diagram 7 .
) Oil of Calamus ( Dr. Gladstone).\#151 ; This oil belongs to the group of substances with the formula C15H24 .
The portion boiling at 260 ' was photographed .
It yielded spectra after diluting 1,000 , 10,000 , 20.000 , and 30,000 times , and throughout exhibited the same absorptive power , or nearly so , as that displayed by the oil of turpentine of highest boiling-points .
( Diagram 7 .
) Otto of Citron ( Dr. Gladstone).\#151 ; On the second distillation , two fractions were separated : the first boiled between 110 ' and 200 ' , the distillate containing at first a little water ; the thermometer then rose rapidly to 200 ' .
The second fraction boiling between 200 ' and 245 ' was photographed .
This is one of those substances exhibiting a strong absorption , even after dilution with alcohol to 20,000 times its original volume .

No. 2.\#151 ; This blue oil was rectified , and the portion boiling between 275 ' and 277 ' was photographed after diluting 5.000 , 8,000 , 10,000 , and 50,000 times .
A very distinct absorption band was noticed lying between lines 12 and 17 Cd .
( See diagram .
) Perfect transparency to the more refrangible rays was not obtained by a dilution with 50,000 volumes of alcohol .

2nd " " 265-270 ' .
This oil , like several others , polymerises easily during distillation ; consequently , a freshly distilled specimen on redistillation leaves a resinous residue in the retort .
The portion boiling between 265 ' and 270 ' was examined after diluting 1,000 , 3,000 , 6,000 , and 10,000 times .
( Diagram 7 .
) An examination of the diagrams which contain the results of observations on the preceding substances will show that in bodies of the same constitution the absorption of the ultra-violet rays is greater the lai'ger the number of carbon atoms in the molecule .
That is to say , the oils with the higher boiling-points such as calamus , patchouli , and the denser turpentine oil , are those which are the least transparent after dilution with alcohol .
With two exceptions , none of the substances already examined exhibit absorption bands .
The exceptions alluded to are the first specimen of carraway hydrocarbon , which we shall show further on , containing a small quantity of cymene , and the blue oil from patchouli .
As we shall have occasion to remark on the evident presence of cymene in several essential oils , it may be convenient to give an account of specimens of cymene which we have examined , and direct attention to the absorption bands which are made to appear by diluting the liquid to various degrees , as shown in the diagi'am .
Cymene No. 1.\#151 ; This specimen was prepared by Dr. C. R. A. Wright , and examined optically by Dr. Gladstone .
Its source was probably oil of lemons .
It began to distil at 172 ' , and nearly all the liquid came over below 176 ' C. The portion boiling between 173 ' and 175 ' was completely soluble in fuming sulphuric acid with only a pale brownish coloration .
It was examined first without dilution , and subsequently when diluted to 1,000 , 2,000 , 4,000 , 5,000 , 8,000 , 20,000 , 50,000 and 100,000 volumes .
Three well-defined absorption bands are visible with a dilution of 4,000 and 5,000 times ; a band similar to that lying below the line 17 Cd appears to be characteristic of the hydrocarbons derived from benzene .
See diagrams of benzene , ethyl-benzene , mesitylene , toluene , \amp ; c. , in Part II of this research ( " Phil. Trans. , " Part I , 1879 ) .
( Diagram 10 .

When diluted 2,000 , 4,000 , and 5,000 times it exhibited absorption bands coinciding with those shown in No. 1 .

In other cases absorption bands are present because the oil itself is largely composed of some other benzene derivative .
Thyme Hydrocarbon .
No. 2 .
( Dr. Gladstone.)\#151 ; After careful distillation and fractioning , there were two portions which boiled at ^61 \#151 ; 1(33'^ and 163\#151 ; 170 ' .
A considerable quantity derived of course from the first fractions boiled between 162 ' and 163 ' , and was taken as the representative of the pure substance .
The liquid diluted to 50 , 500 , 750 , 1,000 , 1,500 , 2,000 , 4,000 , 8,000 and 16,000 times its original volume was examined .
( Diagram 11 .
) Diagkah 11 .
Thyme hydrocarbon .
( Dr. Gladstone .
) This absorption is due to the large amount of cymene contained in the liquid .
The curve shown is interesting , because it enables us to make an \#166 ; approximate estimation of the proportion of cymene contained in the hydrocarbon , for since the absorption exhibited when the dilution to yio coincides as nearly as possible with that given by cymene at VoTTo ?
^ is evident that the thyme hydrocarbon must contain about -g- its volume of this liquid .
The rounding off of the more refrangible portion of the spectrum is a modification caused by the terpene .

Nearly the whole of this specimen boiled between 173 ' and 175 ' C. Photographs were taken after diluting 50 , 1,000 , 2,000 and 4,000 ' times .
The cymene absorptions are seen at and and indicate that about of the volume of the original liquid consists of this body .

diagrams of course vary a little in appearance according to the-number of solutions photographed , and of course in these particular cases by the proportion of cymene present ; hence the diagram representing the absorption in the case of the thyme hydrocarbon gives the best idea of the modification of the terpene spectrum caused by an admixture of cymene by reason of the greater number of photographs , employed in depicting it .
Examination of Essential Oils .
Substances causing strong absorption bands the spectrum transmitted by dilute solutions .
The following oils and derivatives of essential oils show strong absorption bands in their photographed spectra .
For the most part they are bodies known to contain the aromatic nucleus as an essential part of their constitution .
Thus the oils of bay , pimento , and cloves contain the substance eugenol , CgH3.OH .
OCH3.C3H5 ; oil of cassia consists of cinnamic aldehyde , C6H5.C2H2.COH ; and oil of aniseed contains anethol , C6H4.OCH3 C3H5 ; and oil of thyme , thymol , CgH3.OH3.C3H7 .
Some other oils , such as bergamot and oil of peppermint , as likewise the bodies menthole , carvole , and myristicol , have an unknown constitution .
The three latter substances are known to be isomeric .
( " Journ. Chem. Soc. , " Gladstone , vol. xxv , p. 1 .
) Great interest is attached to our examination of these , since we consider it to be proved from the character of the spectra they transmit , that the nucleus of menthole is a terpene , while the benzene ring is the inner basis of carvole and myristicol .
Bergamot appears to be a terpene mixed , with some derivative of the aromatic series , but oil of peppermint on the other hand is essentially a substance belonging to the latter class .
Oil of Bay ( Dr. Gladstone).\#151 ; There was a fair quantity of this substance , and the following fractions were separated by distillation :\#151 ; 1st fraction boiling at 190\#151 ; 200 ' C. 2nd " " 200\#151 ; 220 ' " 8rd " " 220\#151 ; 240 ' " 4th " " 240\#151 ; 260 ' " The two principal fractions boiling at 190 to 200 ' , and from 220 to 240 ' , were photographed .
The fraction boiling between 190\#151 ; 200 ' solutions containing o\gt ; 5 ?
oo !
ioMo\gt ; and 20M0 were examined .
The first absorption band commenced midway between lines 12 and 17 Cd , and in a solution containing -gyVo ' 'f the oil , this continues nearly to the line 18 Cd ; at this point a narrow band of rays is transmitted .
The widening out of this band is somewhat rapid between toVo ' and T0W00 ' after which it is somewhat more gradual , there being still some absorption at 1 in 50,000 .
The fraction boiling between 220\#151 ; 240 ' solutions containing 1 in 1,000 , 5,000 , and 10,000 were photographed .
The absorption in these solutions appears at nearly the same points , but is more intense .
This is quite what one might expect supposing the fraction with the higher boiling-point to contain a greater proportion of the absorbing body than the other .

Eugenol has been shown by Bonastie to be contained in otto of pimento , and its boiling-point is said to be 242 ' ( Stenhouse ) , 243 ' ( Ettling ) , 248 ' ( Briining ) , and 251 ' ( Greville Williams ) .

( Dr. Gladstone 's specimen .
) The absorption band is evidently due to eugenol , C6H3(OH ) OCH3 c3h5 .
Absorption still seen at 1 in 50,000 .
Oil of cloves contains a small portion of a hydrocarbon , C15Ho4 , together with eugenol ( Ettling , u Ann. Pharm. , 9 , 68 , also Grmelin , English edition , vol. xiv , p. 202 ) .
The boiling-points of the hydrocarbons with the formula C15II24 lie between 249 and 260 .
It is therefore extremely improbable that the hydrocarbon could be sepaExamination of Essential Oils .
rated from the eugenol by distillation .
As we desired to examine the oil of cloves in its usual state , we did not attempt to separate the eugenol by means of alkalies .
That portion boiling between 250 ' and 253 ' was examined after diluting 1,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , 20,000 , and 30,000 times .
A characteristic absorption , similar to that of otto of pimento , was remarked .

of the absorption exerted by this substance is extraordinary , and we may no doubt regard it as being very nearly pure anethol or allyl-phenol-methyl ether .
( See Diagram 18 .
) Oil of Cassia ( Dr. Gladstone).\#151 ; This specimen began to distil at 130 ' C. , but the thermometer rose at once to 250 ' and then slowly continued upwards to 280 ' , the distillate being bright yellow .
The remaining portion was a brown resin .
The portion boiling between 250 ' and 280 ' was dissolved in 1,000 , 5,000 , 50,000 , 75,000 , 100,000 , and 150,000 parts of alcohol , and examined .
( See'Diagram 19 .
) Diagram 19 .
Absorption band very faint at 150,000 .
The absorption is remarkably intense up to the dilution of 1 in 50,000 , when a band of rays is transmitted adjacent to the position of Examination of Essential Oils .
the line Cd 23 .
The absorption disappears as this band widens out by reason of further dilution .
Since oil of cassia consists mostly of cinnamic aldehyde , which has the composition C6H-.C2H2.COH , the aromatic nucleus is here again accountable for the absorption .
Oil of Thyme ( Dr. Gladstone).\#151 ; Nearly the whole of the specimen distilled between the temperature of 220 ' and 240 ' C. A brown resinous residue remained in the retort .

) Carvol ( Dr. Gladstone ) .
Separated from oil of carraway by distillation.\#151 ; The liquid distilled almost entirely between 215 ' and 220 ' .
The portion boiling between these temperatures was examined after dilution 1,000,10,000,100,000,120,000 , 150,000 , 200,000 , 250,000 , and 300,000 times its volume with alcohol .
( See Diagram 21 .
) The absorptive power of this body is remarkable , and is undoubtedly Prof. W. N. Hartley and A. K. Huntington .
due to its containing a nucleus of three doubly-linked carbon atoms .
Its refraction equivalent is abnormal , like those of bodies of the aromatic series .
( Gladstone , " Chem. Soc. J. , " vol. xxiii , p. 149 .
) Furthermore it is isomeric with cuminic alcohol and thymol .

Myristicol ( Dr. Gladstone).\#151 ; Derived from oil of nutmegs .
On this substance being distilled , there were two principal fractions : No. 1 , boiling below 215 ' C. No. 2 , .
" from 215 ' to 260 ' .
The second portion was the better and much the larger part of the liquid .
The liquid diluted 1,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , and 15,000 times , was photographed .
The character of the absorption is such as to Examination of Essential Oils .
make it probable that this is a mixture of a terpene with a large amount of some benzene derivative .

Myristicol .
When a mixture of two substances exhibits absorption bands which are due to only one of them , the following characters are generally noticeable:\#151 ; 1st .
There is not unfrequently a haziness about the transmitted rays ; 2nd .
The absorption bands are not well defined ; 3rd .
A comparatively limited amount of dilution suffices to obliterate the chief features of the absorption spectrum .
All these points may be to some extent observed in the spectra of this myristicol , but the bands are yet so strong that they evidently belong to the predominant compound .
On referring to the refractive equivalent of myristicol ( Gladstone , Chemical Society 's Journal , vol. xxiii , p. 149 ) , we find that it corresponds well with numbers characteristic of compounds of the aromatic series .
Hence , the conclusion is obvious , that the greater part of the liquid consists of some benzene derivative .
Oil of Bergamot ( Dr. Gladstone.)\#151 ; This oil was separated into two fractions :\#151 ; 1st , boiling between 175 ' and 180 ' ; 2nd , between 180 ' and 190 ' .
\#166 ; * .
The first portion was diluted to 400 , 800 , and 1,000 times its own volume , and photographed .
An absorption band was noticed , which soon became removed by dilution , and therefore was set down to an impurity .

A highly characteristic absorption distinguishes this substance .
As is well known , it is the aldehyde of benzoic acid .

Dr. Gladstone states that both the English and Italian specimens examined by him contained a hydrocarbon which has physical properties differing little from those of the hydrocarbon from bay .
It will be seen , however , that the absorption spectra due to these two substances are very different .
The following is a summary of our conclusions with regard to the terpenes :\#151 ; 1 .
Terpenes , with the composition C10H16 , possess in a high degree 2(5 Dr. C. A. MacMunn .
Researches into the the power of absorbing the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum , though they are inferior in this respect to benzene and its derivatives .
2 .
Terpenes , with composition C15H24 , have a greatly increased absorptive power .
3 .
Neither the terpenes themselves nor their oxides nor hydrates , , exhibit absorption bands under any circumstances when pure , but always transmit continuous spectra .
4 .
Isomeric terpenes transmit spectra which generally differ from one another in length , or show variations on dilution .
5 .
The process of diluting with alcohol enables the presence of bodies of the aromatic series to be detected in essential oils ; and even in some cases the amount of these substances present may be approximately determined .

I do not propose to discuss in this paper all the pigments which have been said to occur in urine , as their consideration would extend over a considerable space ; and I shall , therefore , limit my observations to those which I have myself studied , and which are discoverable by means of spectroscopic observation .
Notwithstanding the efforts of physiological chemists , at home and abroad , no one has been hitherto able to isolate the pigment known as urobilin .
After many unsuccessful attempts , I have at length succeeded in isolating a pigment , which , on account of its spectroscopic and chemical reactions , , appears to be urobilin in a pure state .
Although it has not been obtained in sufficient quantity to allow of a formula being assigned to it , I believe that I shall soon be able to obtain enough for this purpose .
A preliminary examination has shown that it contains carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and nitrogen .
Preliminary Remarks.\#151 ; If nitric acid be added to a solution of bile before the slit of the spectroscope , the solution at once undergoes a change of colour , becoming green , blue , violet , red , and , lastly , yellow or brownish-yellow , and the spectrum is characterised by having two bands : a broad shadowy band , composed of two in orange and yellow , and a black band at Fraunhofer 's line F. In a short time the shading in orange and yellow begins to fade , and at the time the oxidation process is completed , and the colour of the solution
