Relative Passivity of Wrought-iron and various Steel Bars , and the Influence of Chemical Composition and Physical Structure on their Passive State in Cold Nitric Acid .
The author is not aware that any previous experiments have hitherto been made showing the relative passivity of the various'kinds of steel compared with wrought iron , or .
the influence of the chemical composition and physical structure of such metals on theirpassive condition in nitric acid .
The passive state of iron or steel may have hitherto been regarded by many as a sort of fixed property pertaining to iron and steel alike , , when immersed in cold , strong nitric acid .
The following experiments were made to investigate if the passivity was of an universally static character , or whether it varied with the chemical composition and general physical structure of the metal and , if so , to what extent .
For convenience , this part of the investigation was divided into twoparts , one portion of the observations , Set 1 , being made on drawn rods of metals of known chemical composition and structure , and the other , Set 2 , of experiments constituting a study of the relativeFio .

An idea of their general properties will be obtained on reference to Part II , Tables IV and V. A polished bar , inches long , 0*310 inch diameter , of the steel to be tested was placed in the wooden stand W ( fig. 5 ) , along with a polished wrought-iron bar of equal size , and the pair were then immersed in 1J fluid ounce of nitric acid 1*42 sp. gr. , contained in the JJ-tube , the bars being in circuit with the galvanometer .
The immersion was continued for the periods stated , and with the electro-chemical results given on Table VI .
; The wrought-iron bars used in each experiment were cut"from one longer polished rod , so as to afford a fair comparison of the relative passivity of the various steels , compared with the wrought iron and also with each other .
The results are the average of numerous experiments in each case .

In each experiment , a polished wrought-iron plate and a polished steel plate were firmly placed in two small holes drilled through a thick plate-glass cover .

[ Apr. 30 , the cover holding the two plates was then carefully placed closely over a porcelain vessel containing 15 fluid ounces of nitric acid sp. gr. 1'42 , the plates being fully immersed in the acid , and the protruding shanks of the bars connected in circuit with the galvanometer .
The electro-chemical effects observed were then taken in the usual manner , and the results are given on Table VIII .
At the conclusion of each experiment on Table VIII , the nitric acid , though quite colourless at first , was found to be of a yellowishbrown colour .
A small deposit of fine black carbonaceous-looking matter was noticed at the bottom of the tank surrounding the wrought-iron bar in each set of these experiments .
The hard Siemens-Martin steel plate and the wrought-iron plate , instantly after withdrawal from the acid , showed nearly their original bright polish , with the exception of a few fine streaks or markings on the wrought-iron plate , indicating that the latter metal had been father more acted upon than the steel plate , the hard Siemens-Martin steel plate presenting a slightly dull-greyish aspect .
Somewhat similar results were observed on withdrawing the soft cast steel , hard cast steel , soft Bessemer steel , and hard Bessemer steel series of plates from the nitric acid .
The .hard cast steel plate when taken out showed a dull lustre much removed from its original bright polish , but there were no other signs of its having been acted upon .
The wrought-iron plate connected with it was bright on withdrawal from the liquid and but very slightly marked .
General Remarks .
It has been necessary to give in modified detail the effects observed during the periods of experimentation recorded on the Tables , Parts I , II , and III , so as to convey an accurate intimation of the method and nature of the research , and a brief resume of some of the principal results and conclusions arrived at by the author up to the presen time may now be given .
Firstly.\#151 ; The experimental observations of Part I , Series I , indicate that the influence of magnetisation on the passive state of steel rods in cold nitric acid sp. gr. 1#42 is not very great , but it was detectable with the delicate galvanometer and by the sensitive electro-chemical method pursued by the author in the investigation .
The effect of magnetisation is more marked in warm nitric acid , and when the iron is in a powdered state , as shown in the independent and separate experiments of Messrs. Nichols and Franklin on passive powdered iron in warm nitric acid , previously alluded to in Part I , by whom it was shown that the temperature of transition from the passive to the active state was very materially lowered by powerful magnetism j their experiments also indicate that the passive state of powdered iron cannot be fully overcome , even under strong magnetic influence , until a temperature of about 51 ' G. is reached .
Secondly.\#151 ; The author 's experiments of Part I , Series II , at higher temperatures confirm those of Part I , and further tend to demonstrate the influence of magnetisation in somewhat lessening the passivity of steel , showing that even previous to the critical temperature point of transition from the passive to the active state , magnetised steel bars were rather less passive in warm nitric acid than unmagnetised ones .
Thirdly.\#151 ; The results in Part II , Series III , show that the passivity of both unmagnetised wrought iron and unmagnetised steel in nitric acid sp. gr. 1*42 is considerably and proportionately reduced as the temperature of the acid increases , until the temperature point of transition from the passive to the active state is reached at a temperature of about 195 ' F. , and it was also found that the wrought iron was less passive in the warm nitric acid than cast steel ; see also remarks at foot of Diagram I , in Part II .
Fourthly.\#151 ; The results of the observations of Part II , Series IV , indicate that Scheurer-Kestner was to some extent in error in regarding the passivity of iron as not dependent on the greater or less degree of saturation of the acid .
The author 's experiments herein recorded have shown that the passivity of the metals employed , viz. , wrought iron , soft cast steel , hard cast steel , soft Bessemer steel , and tungsten steel , was very materially increased with the concentration of the nitric acid , and it was also observed that wrought iron was much less passive in the nitric acid of less concentration than most of the steels , the soft Bessemer steel being found about equal in passivity to the wrought iron under the conditions of experimentation .
A reference to Table III shows that a considerable amount of E.M.F. was developed between the different metals in every instance , which is a circumstance of much interest in connexion with the passive state of iron and steel .
Fifthly.-^-The results obtained in Part III , Series V and VI , on the relative passivity of wrought iron and the various steels , soft cast steel , hard cast steel , soft Bessemer steel , hard Bessemer steel , soft Siemens steel , and hard Siemens steel , are of an important character , showing , by the delicate electro-chemical method employed , the powerful influence of difference in chemical composition and physical structure , \amp ; c. , on the passive state of the metals .
Generally throughout this series of experiments it will be observed that the wrought iron was electro-positive to the steels with a considerable E.M.F. , amounting in some cases to as high as one-tenth to one-seventh of a volt , the wrought iron being thus shown to be less passive than the steels .

tion to the plates ( which were rolled hot ) experimented upon in Table VIII , it will he noticed that , in several instances with soft cast steel and hard cast steel , the wrought iron did not assume the electropositive position until two or three hours after immersion in the nitric acid .
Subsequently the iron assumed its normal position , and became during the long remaining period of the observations electro-positive to the steels , with a considerable and increasing E.M.F. , showing that the wrought iron was becoming gradually very much less passive than the steels .
In the case of the soft Bessemer and soft Siemens plates , Table VIII , we have also a similar instance of these peculiar and temporary interchanges and variations of relative passivity which are not easily accounted for .
In the case of the tungsten steel , Table VI , the wrought iron was steadily in the electro-negative position , hence in the latter instance showing the wrought iron to be permanently more passive than the tungsten steel .
A reference to the experiments on the wrought iron and various steel plates , on Table VIII , shows that the E.M.F. between the passive wrought iron and the various soft steels , which contained less percentage of combined carbon , in circuit in cold nitric acid sp. gr. 1'42 , was very considerably less than the E.M.F. under similar conditions between the wrought-iron plates and the different hard steels having a higher percentage of combined carbon .
The latter results , therefore , demonstrate the interesting circumstance that steels , of a higher percentage of combined carbon are more passive than those of a lower percentage of combined carbon .
It will be observed that the wrought iron was also electro-positive to most of the steels , whether of a higher or lower percentage of combined carbon , which shows that wrought iron may be regarded as generally less passive than steels .

( Abstract .
) The method of isolating what is called chromatin by the histologist yields compounds of fairly stable composition called nucleins , some of which have been shown to contain iron ( Bunge and Zaleski ) .
My observations on haematopoiesis in Amphibia led me to the conclusion that the chromatin , from which the haemoglobin of the haematoblasts is derived , is an iron-holding compound .
Other observations indicated that the conclusion could , possibly , be made of general application , i.e. , that iron is present in the chromatin of every cell , animal and
