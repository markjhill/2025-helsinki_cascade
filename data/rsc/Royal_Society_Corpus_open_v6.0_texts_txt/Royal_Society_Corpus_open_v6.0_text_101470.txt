Of a Correspondency , to be procured , for the Finding out the True distance of the Sun and Moon from the Earth , by the Paralax , observed under ( or near ) the same Meridian .
Seeing that the knowledge of this distance may prove of important Use , for the Perfecting of Astronomy , and for the better establishing the doctrine of Refractions ; it is in the thoughts of some very curious Persons in England , for the finding out the same , to settle a Correspondency with some others abroad , that are understanding in Astronomical matters , and live in places far distant in Latitude , and under ( or near ) the same Meridian .
To perform which , the following Method is proposed to be observed ; viz. That at certain times agreed on by two Observatours , making use of Telescopes , large , good and well fitted for this purpose , by a measuring rod , placed within the Eye glass at a convenient distance , that it may be distinctly seen , and serve for measuring small distances by minuts and seconds ( which is-easie enough in large Telescopes ) that , I say , each of such observers , thus furnish't , shall observe the visible way of the Moon among the Fixed stars , ( by taking her exact distance from any Fixed starr , that lies in or very near her way , together with the exact time of her so appearing ) and the then apparent Diameter of her Disk ; continuing these Observations every time for two or three hours , that so , if possible , two exact observations of her Apparent place among the Fixed stars being made , at two places thus distant in Latitude , and as near as may be under the same Meridian , by these Observators concurring at the same time , her true and exact distance may be hence collected , not only for that time , but at all other times , by any single Observator 's viewing her with a Telescope , and measuring exactly her Apparent Diameter .
It were likewise desirable , that as often as there happens any considerable Eclipse of the Sun , that this also might be observed by them , noting therein the exact measure of the greatest Obscuration compared with the then Apparent Diameter of his Disk .
For by this means , after the distance of the Moon hath been exactly found , the distance of the Sun will easily be deduced .
As for the time , fittest for making Observations of the Moon , that will be , when she is about a. Quarter or some what less illuminated , because then her light is not so bright , but that with a good Telescope she may be observed to pass close by , and sometimes over several Fixed stars ; which is about four or five days before or after her Change : Or else at any other time , when the Moon passes near or over some of the bigger sort of Fixed stars , such as of the first or second Magnitude ; which may be easily calculated and foreseen : Or best of all , when there is any Total Eclipse of the Moon ; for then the smallest Telescopical stars may be seen close adjoining to the very body of the Moon .
Of all which particulars the two Correspondents are to agree , as soon as he , that is to join abroad , shall be found out ; whereupon they are mutually to communicate to each other , what they shall have thus observed
