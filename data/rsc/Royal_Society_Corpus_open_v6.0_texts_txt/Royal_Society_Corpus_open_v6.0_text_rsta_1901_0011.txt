Introduction .
It has been known almost from the first discovery of the Becquerel Rays that these mysterious emanations caused gases through which they passed to conduct electricity .
But though careful measurements have been made of the relative conductivity* of gases under the Rontgen rays ( J. J. Thomson , ' Proc. Camb .
Phil. Soc. , ' vol. 10 , p. 9 ) and under cathode rays ( MacLennan , 'Proc .
Roy .
Soc. , ' vol. 60 , p. 375 ) , little seems to have been done in this direction for the Becquerel rays .
This paper deals with measurements of the kind in question , and with the conclusions which may he drawn from them .
It will he first desirable to state clearly what conditions must he complied with in order that the quantities measured may have an intelligible meaning .
In the first place , the E.M.F. applied to the conducting gas must suffice to " saturate " the current .
In other words , it must be so great that a further increase will not increase the current appreciably ( see J. J. Thomson , ' Phil. Mag. , November , 189G ) .
In the second place , it is essential to make certain that the layer of gas employed is so far rarefied that the absorption of the radiation by it is inappreciable .
If this condition is not complied with , the layers of gas more remote from source of radiation are less powerfully affected by it than the nearer ones .
1 l\gt ; e effective strength of the radiation will thus depend on the absorbing power of the gas at the particular pressure , and the observed ratio of conductivities of two gases at the same pressure will not represent the ratio of their conductivities under radiation of a givtn strength .
It is universally recognised that the conductivity of gases under Rontgen and Becquerel rays is due to the production in them of positive and negatively charged * It is hardly necessary to state that the word " conductivity " applied to an ionised gas is used m quite a different sense from the same word when applied to a metal .
The expression \#171 ; conductivity " of a gaseous conductor is used to denote the current which it will carry under a saturating electromotive force .

ions by the rays .
When the current is saturated , the ions travel across from one electrode to the other so quickly that there is no time for recombination to take place to any appreciable extent .
Thus the current measures the amount of ionisation produced , supposing the strength of radiation to remain constant .
In order to determine whether or not the radiation was sensibly absorbed , the conductivity was observed at different pressures .
When the conductivity was proportional to the pressure , it was concluded that no sensible absorption took place in the layer of gas at any pressure within the range of the experiment .
When , on the other hand , the conductivity did not increase so fast as the law of proportionality to the pressure would require , it was clear that the absorption was appreciable .
In such a case , the gas was rarefied far enough to ensure that the law of proportionality should he obeyed .
S 2 .
Radio-active Substances .
The radiation from various radio-active bodies lias been investigated .
These included\#151 ; ( 1 .
) A preparation obtained from de Haen , of Hamburg ( see ' Wied .
Ann./ vol. 68 , p. 902 ) .
This substance , as a few simple chemical tests showed , consists principally of barium carbonate , and , no doubt , its very strong radiating power is due to the presence of the new metal , radium , discovered by Madame Curie in pitchblende , which is separated , together with barium , in the analysis of that mineral .
This radium preparation gave out radiations of at least two distinct kinds : one easily absorbable by solids or gases , and , as Curie has shown ( ' Comptes Itendus , ' vol. 130 , p. 73 ) , not deflected by magnetic force .
The other , more penetrating , and deflectable by the magnet .
The relative conductivities in gases due to each of these kinds has been investigated .
Since , when investigating the conductivity due to the non-deflectable kind , the other variety were also present , it is important to inquire whether the proportion is large enough to vitiate the results .
In Curie 's paper the following numbers are given , showing what proportion of the conductivity is due to the non-deflectable rays at various distances from the source :\#151 ; Distance centim. . .
7*1 0-9 6-5 6-0 5-1 3-4 Percentage ... .
0 0 11 33 .56 74 The absorption of the air , of course , accounts for the small proportion at long distances .
A rough extra-polation from these numbers shows that close up to the substance only about 10 per cent , of the ionisation is due to deflectable rays .
The conductivity ratio to be measured did not differ in any case more than about 30 per cent , for the two kinds of rays .
Thus the error due to the presence of deflectable rays is only of the order of 3 per cent. , an amount not well outside the errors of experiment .
( 2 .
) A preparation containing the other radio-active constituent of pitchblende , polonium .
This body I obtained as follows :\#151 ; Pitchblende was dissolved in dilute nitric acid .
The filtered liquid was treated with sulphuretted hydrogen .
The precipitate was found to contain antimony , arsenic , copper , and bismuth , the polonium being associated with the last .
To remove antimony and arsenic , the precipitate was digested with ammonium sulphide .
The liquid was filtered off* and the remaining precipitate , containing copper and bismuth , with polonium , was dissolved in nitric acid , and excess of ammonia added .
The resulting precipitate , consisting of bismuth and polonium hydroxide , was tested for radio-activity , and found to be fairly active .
Some of it was fused with an excess of potassium cyanide with a view to reducing it to the metallic state .
The contents of the crucible , digested with water , and filtered , gave a black insoluble powder , not a coherent button of metal as had been anticipated .
This black powder presumably consisted of the reduced metal .
It was many times more active than the original oxidised product , and was accordingly used in the experiments.* ( 3 .
) Another specimen of polonium was used which I owe to the kindness of Sir William Crookes .
I have no exact account of the method of preparation , but Sir W. Crookes tells me that it was , in outline , the same as that described by Curie ( ' Comptes Bendus , ' vol. 127 , p. 175 ) .
This substance was considerably more powerful than the polonium which I prepared .
( 4 ) Ordinary uranium compounds , as met with in commerce , have a feeble radioactivity .
Indeed , it was in these that Becquerel first detected the effect .
Sir W. Crookes has shown ( * Proc. Boy .
Soc. , ' vol. 66 , p. 409 ) that the activity is due , not to the uranium itself , but to a powerfully radiating body accompanying it in small quantities , and probably distinct from both radium and polonium .
He has shown [ loc. cit.)that if ordinary commercial crystallised uranium nitrate be dissolved in ether , the resulting liquid divides into two layers\#151 ; the one consisting mainly of an aqueous , the other of an ethereal , solution of uranium nitrate .
Ihe watei , of couise , is supplied by the water of crystallisation of the salt .
The solid obtained by evaporating the aqueous solution is distinctly more powerfully radio-active than that from the ethereal one .
In my experiments a product was used which had been several times concentrated in this way .
* The improvement in the polonium due to treatment with potassium cyanide at a red heat was so marked , that it does not seem possible to explain it by the greater concentration of the material when in the metallic condition .
The observation is of some interest , and I hope to investigate the matter further ; but it bears only indirectly on the subject of the present papei .
Uranium , as well as radium , gives off two types of radiation , one much more penetrating than the other .
( See Butherford , 'Phil .
Mag. , ' January , 1899 .
) Becquerel has shown ( 'Comptes Bendus , ' vol. 130 , p. 1583 ) that some at least of the uranium rays are deflected by the magnet , but he does not seem to have made any experiments to decide whether both types are so , or only one .
In fact , the radiation is so feeble as to make such experiments very difficult .
But it seems probable that , as in the case of radium , the penetrating type of rays are deflected , while the others are not so .
My experiments were exclusively concerned with the rays from the bare compound , which consist for the most part of the easily absorbed type .
Only a small fraction of the total conductivity is due to the other kind , so small , in fact , as to make any determination of the conductivities difficult , unless some more powerful preparation than mine were available .
The experiments were accordingly confined to the easily absorbed type of radiation .
S 3 .
Method of .
The gas of which the conductivity was to be determined occupied the space between two parallel plate electrodes .
One of these was maintained at a high potential , the other connected to the one pair of quadrants of an electrometer , the other pair being to earth .
The rate of movement of the needle then gave a measure of the current through the gas .
When the rays which had penetrated through a considerable thickness of metal were to be investigated , the arrangement was as follows :\#151 ; The gas of which the conductivity was to be determined was contained in the apparatus represented in section by fig. 1 .
It consists of an air-tight cylindrical brass box a , about 1 inch long , 3 inches diameter , provided with a bottom of thin copper sheet b , soldered on , through which the rays penetrated into it .
The bottom was '007 centim. thick .
Inside this cylinder , and parallel to its ends , was the insulated metal plate f carried on the rod g. This plate was used as the low-potential electrode .
The arrangements for insulating the plate f from the outside cylindrical brass box , which served as the high potential electrode , were somewhat special .
At e eis seen the brass neck of the main vessel .
Inside it is fixed an ebonite collar h , and inside this again a second brass tube This inside brass tube carries the ebonite stopper l , up the middle of which the brass wire g passes .
This latter carries the electrode f and is connected outside to the electrometer .
The intermediate brass tube kis put to earth .
Finally , the outside vessel is put to the + terminal of a battery of 100 storage cells , the other terminal of which is to earth .
The ebonite collar li has thus to sustain an E.M.F. of 200 volts ; but the ebonite stopper l has only to sustain 3 or 4 volts , since the potential to which was allowed OF GASES TINDER THE BECQUEREL RAYS .
511 to rise , in order that a suitable reading of the rate of charge might be obtained never exceeded this value .
Now a slight leakage through is of no importance , its only effect being to take a small current from the battery .
On the other hand , a failure of the insulation of the stopper l would vitiate the measurements .
But the danger of such a failure is but small , because of the smallness of the E.M.F. to which this insulation is exposed .
If a pimple ebonite stopper were used to carry the electrode , these more complicated arrangements being dispensed with , it would he essential that its insulation should be perfect even when exposed to the whole 200 volts .

L x I The brass vessel was screwed down to a block of lead , d , by suitable thumbscrews .
A circular cavity , c , was turned in this block , and served to contain the radio-active material .
At pa side tube was soldered in , through which the apparatus could be exhausted and gas admitted .
For investigating the easily absorbable radiation , a slightly different arrangement was employed .
Instead of the thin copper bottom soldered on , a thick circular brass plate was used .
On this was laid a lead tray containing the radio-active body ; the brass cover , in this caSe provided with a flange round the bottom edge , was then cemented on with the soft cement known as Pkouts Elastic ( due .
Fig. 2 will make the arrangement clear .
The vessel inside was connected to a water-pump , which would exhaust to a pressure of 15 millims. , and to a manometer .
The procedure in investigating each kind of radiation was as follows :\#151 ; First , the rate of leak was taken in air at different pressures ; the limit of pressure within which the rate of leak was sensibly proportional to the pressure was thus ascertained .
And in the subsequent measurements care was taken to be well inside this limit .
Fig. 2 .

Cemented joint .
In comparing the different gases , air was in all cases taken as the standard .
The rate of leak in air was measured at a pressure such as to give this rate a convenient value .
The air was then removed by the water-pump , and the gas under investigation admitted .
The apparatus was several times exhausted and refilled to ensure purity .
Finally , the pressure was adjusted to give about the same rate of leak as that previously measured in air , and the exact rate carefully determined .
If were the pressures of the gas under investigation and of the air respectively , i ' the observed rates of leak , then the relative saturation conductivity of the gas was given by the fraction -7\#151 ; - , air at the same pressure and under radiation of the same strength being taken as unity .
The electromotive force used was 200 volts , amply sufficient to produce saturation under the conditions of the experiments .
In investigating the vapours of volatile liquids , such as methyl iodide , it was necessary to take care that the vapour should not be so nearly saturated as to deviate sensibly from Boyle 's law .
The rates of leak through vapours were accordingly taken at a pressure of not more than half that which would have been in equilibrium over the liquid at the same temperature .
These vapours gave large conductivities , and the smallness of the pressure at which it was necessary to work did not cause any inconvenience .
I I shall now mention the methods of preparation of the gases employed .
It would not have been worth while , in view of the limited accuracy of the electrometer measm eroents , to have taken ro.orG than ordinary care to scour\#169 ; purity .
The gases weie m all cases dried hy passing them slowly over phosphorus pent-oxide .
The hydrogen was prepared from sulphuric acid and zinc , and purified by occlusion in palladium foil , from which it was subsequently expelled by heat .
The oxygen was obtained by heating potassium permanganate .
The hydrochloric acid was made by the action of pure sulphuric acid on rock salt .
The cyanogen was obtained by heating mercury cyanide .
The carbon dioxide by the action of pure hydrochloric acid on white marble .
The sulphur dioxide from the liquefied gas commercially supplied , in a " syphon .
" The chloroform , methyl iodide , and carbon tetrachloride vapours were from the pure liquids commercially procured .

Experiments on the Penetrating Radiation from the Active Barium Compound .
The vessel used to contain the gas was that with the thin copper bottom , '007 centim. thick , through which the radiation had to pass .
As any easily absorbable radiation had already been filtered out by the copper bottom of the vessel , it was not to be expected that the rate of leak would be otherwise than simply proportional to the pressure ; but it was thought best to test this experimentally , partly as a guarantee of the accuracy of the method of measurement .
The following measurements were obtained :\#151 ; Pressure of air , millims. of mercury .

The results are plotted on diagram No. 1 , and it will be seen that the rate of leak is closely proportional to the pressure up to atmospheric pressure , as was anticipated .
It was safe , then , to employ any pressure within that range .

This gas rapidly attacked the metal of which the apparatus was made .
The chlorine no doubt combined with the metal , setting the hydrogen free .
The pressure rapidly diminished if the apparatus was left standing full of the gas .
No doubt the difficulty might have been avoided by using an apparatus of platinum , but it was thought hardly worth while to go to the trouble and expense which this would have involved .
It is to be regarded as a matter of accident that the separate determinations agree with one another as well as they do .
In the other cases I believe the mean results are not , for the most part , more than 2 per cent , from the truth , if so much .
The discussion of these results , as well as those that follow , will be deferred till the end of the paper .
It will be worth while to mention that the conductivities of hydrogen and air were compared when an additional sheet of copper , equal in thickness to that which formed the bottom of the vessel ( '007 centim. ) , was used to cut down the radiation .
Almost exactly the same ratio as before was found .
So far as this property is concerned , the radiation which penetrates one sheet of copper '007 centim. in thickness is homogeneous .
S 5 .
Easily Absorbable Rays from Radio-active Barium Carbonate .
To investigate the easily absorbable rays , the second form of apparatus was used , the radiating body being in contact with the gas under investigation , without the interposition of any solid partition .
The radiation from the barium compound is enormously reduced by the interposition of so thin a screen as an ordinary piece of tinfoil ; these " soft " rays accordingly form much the greater part of the whole .
They cannot be conveniently separated from the penetrating rays used in the above experiments , but these latter are present in so small a proportion that they do not much affect the results ( see above , p. 508 ) .
As is there mentioned , there is a difference in kind as well as in degree between the behaviour of the two types of rays .
The penetrating rays are deflected by the magnet ; the others are not so .
The barium compound was so very active that even when a very small quantity was taken , and the air pressure considerably reduced , the rate of leak was much too large for convenient observation .
A parallel plate condenser was accordingly connected to the electrometer so as to increase its capacity .
The distance between the plates was adjusted till the rate of leak had a convenient value , and was not afterwards altered .
This plan is much better in practice than diminishing the sensitiveness of the electrometer by lowering the potential of the needle .
The rate of leak in air was determined at various pressures .

Radiation from Polonium .
This radiation is not deflected by the magnet* ( Curie , ' Comptes Rendus/ vol. 130 , p. 73 ) , and , so far at least , resembles the " soft " radiation from the active barium .

Diagram No. 5 , which exhibits these results graphically , shows that lor this type of radiation the current begins to deviate appreciably from that value which proportionality to the pressure would require , when the pressure only amounts to VOL. CXCV1.------A .
3 X about 150 millims. This type of radiation is , therefore , more rapidly absorbed by the air than any of the kinds which have already been discussed .
The rate of leak at pressures so low was rather too small for convenient measurement .
A somewhat different method of comparing the gases was used , which avoided this difficulty .
The rate of leak was taken in air , at some convenient pressure , usually about 250 millms .
, and afterwards at a slightly greater pressure , perhaps 260 millims. The gas for comparison having been introduced into the vessel , its pressure was adjusted till the rate of leak was intermediate between those given by air at the two slightly different pressures .
The pressure at which the air woidd have given the exact rate of leak observed in the other gas was determined by interpolation , on the sufficiently accurate assumption that the rate of leak could he represented between these narrow limits as a linear function of the pressure .
In this way , then , were determined the pressures at which the two gases gave exactly the same rate of leak .
If now we assume that the absorption of the radiation by a gas is proportional to the saturation conductivity produced in the gas , it follows that if two gases are adjusted to give equal conductivity , the radiation is absorbed to an equal extent in each .
Consequently the correction for absorption of the radiation is eliminated , and the relative conductivities are inversely proportional to the observed pressures .
The assumption that the absorption by a gas is proportional to the conductivity produced in it , is justified by Rutherford 's experiments ( ' Phil. Mag. , ' Jan. , 1899 , p. 137 ) .
He found that if practically the whole of the radiation was absorbed , alj the gases tried gave nearly the same rate of leak under a saturating electromotive force .
This implies the truth of the relation in question .
The next table gives the values found for uranium radiation , with the different gases .

It remains to be considered what conclusions can be drawn from the measurements .
In the first place , let us consider the penetrating radiation from the radium preparation .
It will be seen , that in all cases except hydrogen , the conductivity is nearly proportional to the density of the gas .
Hydrogen is the only case in which the departure from this law is considerable , its conductivity being about double v hat the law would require .
But , since the conductivity of hydrogen is small , the difference between the observed conductivity and that which the law would require is not larger than in the other cases .
And it is possible that this is the right way of regarding the matter .
This aspect of the question is brought out by a graphic representation of conductivity as a function of density , ( bee dia^iam N think that it is impossible to doubt , in view of the results exhibited on tins diagram , that the conductivity depends mainly on the density of the gas .
The much greater relative departure from the law in the case of hydrogen naturally raised the question of whether the experiments were open to criticism .
They were carefully repeated , taking additional precautions against contamination by impurities .
But the accuracy of the former determinations was completely confirmed .

R. J. STRUTT ON THE CONDUCTIVITY It is certain , therefore , that the relative conductivity of gases under the penetrating type of Beccpierel rays are mainly , though not wholly , dependent on their densities .
This result is of considerable interest ; the investigations of Becquerel , Giesel , and others have made it clear that rays of this type resemble the cathode rays in many respects .
Both are deflected by a magnetic and by an electrostatic field ; and carry an electric charge .
Here we have one more property in common .

cathode rays too produce a conductivity in gases proportional to the density .
There is not , however , the same departure from the law in the case of hydrogen .
Under cathode rays the conductivity of hydrogen relative to the other gases is exactly what the law of density would require .
So much for the rays deflected by a magnet .
We have still to consider the rays which are not deflectable .
well obeyed by die other gases , that there is large and unexplained discrepancy between the values found for the relative conductivity of hydrogen under Rontgen rays by J. J. Thomson and Perkin respectively , although their determinations agree fairly well in most other cases , In the first place , it will be seen that all the compounds examined gave very nearly the same values for the relative conductivities .
There is , in fact , no clear evidence of any difference between them in this respect .
This result naturally suggests the conclusion that all these substances give absorbable rays of the same physical nature .
Secondly , it will be seen that the non-deflectable rays give somewhat different results from the deflectable ones ; these differences being well outside the errors of experiment .
For the former , the departure from the law of proportionality is decidedly more marked than for the latter .
A reference to the table will show that these rays give results much closer to the deflectable rays than to the Fontgen rays .
The very large conductivities characteristic of compounds of sulphur and the halogens under Fontgen rays are not met with in the case of Becquerel rays of any kind .
It is now very generally agreed that the deflectable Becquerel rays consist of a stream of negative ions proceeding from the radio-active body with enormous velocities ( Becquerel , ' Comptes Fendus , ' vol. 130 , p. 109 ) .
But this theory gives no account of the nature of the other variety of Becquerel rays .
I wish to make some mention of a possible solution of the question , indicating how far it appears to fall into line with the known facts .
Let us , then , imagine that the absorbable rays consist of a stream of positive ions moving from the radio-active body .
Now we know that the positive ions in gases carry the same charge as the negative , and that they have an enormously greater mass ( J. J. Thomson , c Phil. Mag./ vol. 48 , p. 547 ) .
Unless , therefore , their velocity is smaller out of all proportion than the negative ions , it is to be expected that they will be much less easily deflected by the magnet .
This theory indicates , then , that by applying a very powerful field , the " soft " rays would be deflected .
It would be well worth while to experiment in this direction .
Next , it may be noticed that the smaller penetrating power would be well accounted for by the size of the positive ions , which would , of course , make moie collisions with the molecules of the surrounding gas than the much smallei negative ions .
Lastly , the experiments described in this paper seem to indicate that the deflectable rays produce conductivity in gases by the same kind of process as the others\#151 ; a process quite different from that by which the Fontgen rays produce conductivity .
This is in accordance with the suggestion as to the nature of the rays , conductivity being supposed to be produced in each case by the collision of the moving ions with the molecules , and the consequent splitting up of the latter into new ions .
In this investigation I have received much kind encouragement from Professor J. J. Thomson , and I wish to express my best thanks to him .
Appendix .
Note on a Practical Point in connection Quadrant Most of those who have had occasion to work with an electrometer of the Elliot pattern must have experienced the difficulty of obtaining a jar of glass that would insulate in a sufficiently satisfactory manner .
A jar cannot be considered even tolerably satisfactory unless the charge takes at least a week to leak down to ha its original value .
Such jars may occasionally be met with , but it is by no means easy to " obtain one .
It sometimes happens that a jar will satisfactorily retain a small charge for a much longer period than that mentioned , but , if it he charged more highly , the charge rapidly leaks down to a certain small value , after which the loss becomes very much less rapid .
But , if the electrometer is required to be highly sensitive , such a jar is of course useless .
The " White Pattern " electrometers are much less subject to this difficulty , because their construction allows of a great length along the glass surface between the charged acid and the outside coating of the jar connected to earth .
And it is the surface leakage alone that is practically to he feaied .
After trying many jars and failing to obtain a satisfactory one , I adopted an arrangement which has proved very convenient as a substitute .
A short brass pillar a ( fig. 3 ) carries a circular brass disc c. On to c a round ebonite plate of the Fig. 3 .
same diameter is fixed by means of three screws .
The heads of these screws are on the underside of the brass plate , and they pass into tapped holes in the ebonite , which do not pass right through it .
The outside of this ebonite disc is J inch thick , but the inside is turned down until it is very thin\#151 ; less than J millim. Into the circular recess thus formed is dropped a flat brass plate , , of such a size as to fit it loosely .
The whole arrangement is fixed horizontally between the pillars carrying the quadrants .
For fixing it a screw , b , is provided , as a prolongation of the pillar , a. This screw passes through a hole drilled centrally in the base of the instrument , and a nut fixes the whole in position .
On e is placed a platinum crucible containing strong sulphuric acid , into which the prolonged axis of the needle dips as usual .
A charge is given to the top brass plate , which is , of course , in conducting communication with the needle .
The instrument can then be used as usual .
The insulation of this condenser has been found very satisfactory , the charge not diminishing by more than 20 per cent , of its original value in a week , and this when the charge was sufficient to make the sensitiveness very high .
One or two remarks may be made in conclusion .
If the insulation shows a tendency to deteriorate with time , it can be made as good as ever by removing the surface of the thick rim of ebonite in the lathe , with emery paper , subsequently polishing the surface with bath-brick , applied on felt .
A platinum cup was employed for the acid , with the idea that with it there would be no tendency to any creeping of electrification , and consequent uncertainty in the potential of the needle .
But very probably glass would be practically as good .
A platinum wire dipping in the acid would then have to be connected to the upper brass plate .
Although there is no novelty in principle in this contrivance , yet it has proved so convenient in practice that it has been thought worth while to describe it .
