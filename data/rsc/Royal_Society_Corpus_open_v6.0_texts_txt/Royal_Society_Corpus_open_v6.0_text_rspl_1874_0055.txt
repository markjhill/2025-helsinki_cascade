Mr. James was attended by his son Henry , a young gentleman with plenty of intelligence a commendable spirit of inquiry .
The instrument used was a telescope by Smith and Beck , the property of Mr. James ; object-glass inches its focal length 4 feet ; at ingress , eyepiece 60 , and field a neutral tint ; at egress , eyepiece 100-power , and field red .
For timepiece he used his pocket-watch , which has a seconds-hand .
The watch ' ' gained considerably , perhaps a minute in 12 hours Under date 0th December , 1874 , Mr. James states:\mdash ; " " When she ( Venus ) was about halfway on ( at ingress ) the sun we both noticed a fringe of white light illuminating that rim of the planet which was yet on the darlc sky .
When she went off we noticed the same fringe of light , but for a much shorter time , and when only about one eighth of her had passed the sun 's disk His watch times of contact were as follows:\mdash ; 1st internal contact . . . . . . . .

After receipt of the preceding , I wrote to Mr. James , as already mentioned .
I stated briefly that my view resembled his ; that I had seen a ring of light , but no " " pear-drop\ldquo ; or other ligament , at internal contacts .
I gave him rough sketches of some of the ligaments described in 1769 , and inquired if he had seen any thing like them .
I also asked him to describe the fringe of light he had observed more particularly .
In reply , .
James states , under date 14th December:\mdash ; ' ' When about half her orb had entered ( alluding to ingress ) my attention was attracted to the other half yet on the dark : to me it was dark ; hence I infer that my field was not so light as it ought to have been .
Its outline , up to this time quite invisible to me , llow illumined with a fringe of white light .
I then also noticed a much fainter , thinner , edging of light on the outline of the limb on the sun 's disk , which soon ceased to be visible .
The fringe was rather less in width than of the planet 's diameter .
**** The light somewhat resembled that which we see so plainly in India lighting up the dark side of the moon three or four days old ; but it was brighter , not difftlsive as that is , its inner edge being clearly marked .
It remained visible as long as there was any appreciable portion of the planet beyond the sun 's circumference .
" " As the time for the internal contact approached , that half of the planet which was still entering appeared to lose its shape and to become oval .
I compared it to the thinner half of an egg ; but , since , I have examined several eggs , and find that my comparison would represent a distortion greater than I had intended .
Just before the con1875 .

tact ceased , the end of the oval seemed as it were adhering to the sun 's edge , could not get free , rendering it difficult to decide the contact ceased .
Another impediment in the way of { timing was , that the outline of Venus looked woolly -like , from a very annoying tremor in the air .
Hence the notes we entered were , ' Internal contact oeased , quite clear ' As to the lig : meant which seemed to knit the two edges together , I am disposed to ttribute it solely to the billowy motion of the planet 's outline ; for it had a hairy appealance , and sunlight could be seen through it .
In timing the remaining colltacts there difficulty , for the sun arose Venus appeared to diminish in size , her outline becoming sharply defined .
" " At egress the oval shape did not reappear ; but just the moment of internal contact there was a solt of flickering movement , as if the planet 's had touched , , and touched at .
At , when nearly one eighth of her orb had crossed the border , its outline for brief while with of light .
" " The flickering movement just mentioned , ideutly an illusion , induced by the eye 's weariness from intent ttgaiti at the external collftrt \ldquo ; Writing again on 15th 1874 , 1Ir .
James enclosed the sketch in margin , .
in his letter , " " WhatImeant to express by ' 1igam ' was the point of conne-xion formed the line itseIf , which ppeared adhesive and at the same time The dofs I have ] aced at the point within the line .
I saw no 'black drop , ' if by that is intended a , ny thing bevolld and ched to the of Venus .
I should therefore have expressed myseIf more accurately if , instend of ' igament , ' I had written the of apparent adhesion looked hairy .

ithstanding the conflicting statements which have appeared since writing my Note No. I. , as to the phenomena seen at certain stations , and pending the authoritative decisions which may hereafter be pronounced , it appears to me probable height of station , inferiority of instruments , insensibility of eye to faint lights and shadows , and other causes , are likely to conspire towards producing a meant ( or pear-drop ) at the internal contacts , provided there is an atmosphere or envelope around the planet to ford cause .

On a Continuous Self-registering Thermometer .
W. HARRISON CRIPPS .
Communicated by Prof. STOKES Sec. R.S. Received March 17 , 1875 .
The object of this paper is to explain the working of a continuous self gistering thermometer , the detail of which I have been for some endeavouring to perfect , though it is only recently that I have brought my strument to the perfection necessary for practical demonstrntion .
I of many imperfections in the instrument , but trust thal these will be remedied after some further experiments .
The object oi my invention is to produce a thermometer that not only the highest and vest temperature occurring in a given time , but shalJ also , by a pencil indicator , automatically every minute variation occurring during the time the instrument is at work .
This thermometer will , I hope , be of value for mefeorological observations ; for it will show the exact place from to minute during night , and by this determine the exacI amount of alterations in temperature occurring simultaneously at plctces during diflerent periods of the month or year , withont the trouble of photographic registration .
By a simple modification of my strumeJlt , I believe that I shall be able to produce a thermometer of such form nnd size as shall enable the physician or physiologist to learn with ccuraoy the exact hour and minute when any alteration of temperature in the body takes place , and automatically to register these variatio1ls .
As regards the barometer , many beautiful self-registering unents are in use ; for the surface of the colunm being exposed , offers il easy method of producing a motive force .
In the thermometer the case is diflerent , for no meiUlS of commullication exist even the machinery and the merc in ifs hermetically sealed tube .
So far as I know , the only instrument of this suggested is the one by Merey ; but from the fact air is the mofive force used by
