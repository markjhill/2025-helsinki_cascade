" Researches into the Chemical Constitution of the Opium Bases .
Part I.-On the Action of Hydrochloric Acid on Morphia .
" By AUGUSTUS MATTHIESSEN , F.R.S. , Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Bartholomew 's Hospital , and C. R. A. WRIGHT , B.Sc. Received May 6 , 1869 .
It has been shown that when narcotine is heated with an excess of concentrated hydrochloric or hydriodic acid , one , two , or three molecules of methyl are successively eliminated , and a series of new bases homologous with narcotine obtained .
It appeared interesting to see if any similar reactions took place with morphia ; and for this purpose a quantity of that base , in a perfectly pure state , kindly furnished by Messrs. M'Farlane , of Edinburgh , was submitted to experiment .
The purity of the substance was shown by the following analysis .
It was found that although crystallized morphia does not lose its water of crystallization in an ordinary steam drying-closet ( i. e. slightly below 100 ?
) , yet it readily loses the whole when placed in a Liebig 's drying-tube immersed in boiling water , dry air being aspirated over it .

These may be drained from the mother-liquor , washed with a little cold water , in which the salt is sparingly soluble , and recrystallized from hot water and dried on bibulous paper or over sulphuric acid .
No difference in the result appeared to be produced by continuing the digestion at 150 ?
for six or twelve hours .
The new base may also be formed by digesting morphia and excess of hydrochloric acid under paraffin on the water-bath for some days .
This hydrochlorate contains no water of crystallization .

The following combustion of a portion washed with water , and dried at 100 ?
as rapidly as possible , shows that this precipitate is the base itself .

It hence appears that the new base is simply formed from morphia by the abstraction of the elements of water .

We propose to call the new base apomorphia , for reasons given subsequently .
When the hydrochlorate of apomorphia in a moist state is exposed to the air for some time , or if the dry salt is heated , it turns green , probably from oxidation , as the change of colour is accompanied by an increase of weight .
The base itself , newly precipitated , is white , but it speedily turns green on exposure to air .
The green mass is partly soluble in water , communicating to it a fine emerald colour-in alcohol yielding also a green , in ether and benzole giving a magnificent rose-purple , and in chloroform producing a fine violet tint .

The physiological effects of apomorphia are very different from those of morphia ; a very small dose produces speedy vomiting and considerable depression , but this soon passes off , leaving no after ill effects , -facts of which we have repeatedly had disagreeable proof while working with it .
Dr. Gee is now studying these effects , and has found that T1of a grain of the hydrochlorate subcutaneously injected , or I grain taken by the mouth , produces vomiting in from four to ten minutes .
Our friend Mr. Prus allowed himself to be injected with --grain , which produced vomiting in less than ten minutes .
From Dr. Gee 's experiments on himself and others , he concludes that the hydrochlorate is a non-irritant emetic and powerful antistimulant .
As from these properties it appears probable that it may come into use in medicine , we have called it apomorphia , rather than morphinine , to avoid any possible mistakes in writing prescriptions .
Apomorphia is likewise formed by heating morphia and dilute sulphuric acid ( 1 vol. acid to 8 or 10 of water ) in sealed tubes to 140 ?
-150 ?
for three hours .
It appears possible that the substance obtained by Arppe * , subsequently named sulphomorphide by Laurent and Gerhardt t , is an impure sulphate of apomorphia , as the formula deduced by these latter chemists from their analysis , C8341 H N2 08 S , is identical with that of this sulphate , ( C,7H , NO2)2 H2 SO , .
They , however , considered it a species of amide .
On repeating Arppe 's experiments , we have obtained apomorphia from the product .
The physical characters ascribed to sulphomorphide ( of becoming green on keeping , especially on heating , of communicating this green tint to water , and of solubility in caustic alkalies , producing a brown substance by decomposition ) are precisely those of the hydrochlorate of apomorphia .
It appears probable that the class of analogous bodies produced from other alkaloids by similar means , such as sulphonarcotide , may possibly be the sulphates of new bases .
We propose to submit these to experiment , and to prosecute our researches on the opium bases .
On sealing up codeia with hydrochloric acid and digesting it at 150 ?
, we find some permanent gas is evolved , probably chloride of methyl , in which case the new base , if any , will be morphia or apomorphia or their isomers , as codeia differs from morphia only by CH ,
