A paper was also read entitled , " Remarks on the Theory of the Dispersion of Light , as connected with Polarization ; " by the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , and Savilian Professor of Geometry , Oxford .
Since the publication of a former paper on the subject referred to , the author has been led to review the subject in connexion with the valuable illustrations given by Mr. Lubbock of the views of Fresnel ; and points out , in the present supplement , in what manner the conclusions in that paper will be affected by these considerations .
