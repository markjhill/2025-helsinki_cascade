" A Sixth Memoir on Quantics .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received November 18 , 1858 .
( Abstract .
) I propose in the present memoir to consider the geometrical theory : I have alluded to this part of the subject in the articles Nos. 3 and 4 of the introductory memoir .
The present memoir relates to the geometry of one dimension and the geometry of two limensions corresponding respectively to the analytical theories of binary and ternary quantics .
But the theory of binary quantics is considered for its own sake ; the geometry of one dimension is so immediate an interpretation of the theory of binary quantics , that for its own sake there is no necessity to consider it at all ; it is considered with a view to the geometry of two dimensions .
A chief object of the present memoir is the establishment upon purely descriptive principles of the notion of distance .
