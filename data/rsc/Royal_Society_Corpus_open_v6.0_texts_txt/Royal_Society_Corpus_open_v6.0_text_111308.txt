" By J. GO-MES DE SOUZA , Professor of MIathematics in the Mlilitary Academy of Rio Janeiro .
Commnunicated by Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. The author , after referring to a previous memoir on the same sUbject , presented by him to the Frlench Academyr , prlooses to hinmel the problem of determining the fuinction 9 which ( f , F being given .

I-le observes , that , unlike the methods employed in his former memoir , and the solutions there employed , which are quite rigorous , the mnethods of the present me.moir depenid uponl developments into series , the strictness of which has been contested by some mathematicians ; but that passing over these difficulties , he has solved the famous problem , the solution of which has been vainly sought after for the last two hundred years , because on the above-mentioned equationi depenids the integration of the generally linear equation-'f any order whatever of two variables , and consequently the whole Integral Calculus .
The solution first obtained by the author , and which he afterwards exhibits under a variety of different forms , is as follows : Theorem I.-The equation being given , AX( 0 ) 0(x + 0 ) dO = F1 ( x ) , where f ( x , 0 ) is a given function of x and 0 ; F2(x ) is a given function of x such that the equation F2(x ) =o cannot hold good for any finite value of x ; FI(x ) a given function of x containing all the factors which renider F(x ) infinite , and the function F(x ) being absolutely arbitrary ; and a and ( 3 being given constants ( independent therefore of x and 0 ) , the expression for px which satisfies the preceding equation is __________ a__ F2(a2)_ ' C)+ &amp; fx =f1(a1)Fj1(aj ) e+ f2(aO)F'1a2 ) e$+(a2 ) + &amp; c where f.(x ) is determined by f:.(x ) = ( x-(I , ) AX(a 0 ( x ) el ?

, and a1 , a2 , a3 , &amp;c. are the roots of FI(x ) = 0 .
The author afterwards considers the equation r j"f(x 0 ) p(0 ) do = F(x ) , and the solution of a linear equation is at once made to depend upon this as follows : viz. given for the determination of the functiol i the equation f(X , O0 ) 9 ) +f(X , 1 ) dx + &amp;c. = F(x ) .
Assume &lt; ( x)= eoz14~(O ) dol , 0 , a , / 3 being constanits , and 4(0 ) a funlction of 0 to be determinled .
It is always permitted to assume this equation .
By this meanis , writing for shortness f1(x , 0 ) f(X , 0 ) ?
( r , 1 ) 0+ &amp; C. , the equation becomes el , fi(x , 0 ) 1(0 ) dO = ( x ) , which is of the desired form .
A solution which occurred to the author after the memoir was drawn up , is as follows : viz. given , as before , the equation AX , 0 ) p ( x+ 0 ) do = F(x ) , then F(w / -1 being determined by the equationl =0 , ) eo@ V-)f( V 1 , 0 ) dO and putting , for abbreviation , e V'(X-WV fQe , 0 ) dO f ( x , wV 1)a the equation 1 X0 extwd )F I ) q 2= TV , f(wV1 - , I I dw gives the solution of the problem .
The above-mentioned formule are selected out of a great number of very general results contained in the memoir .
