Memoranda relating to a Theory of Sound .
" By Paul Cooper , Esq. Communicated by J. G. Children , Esq. , Sec. R.S. The author , expressing his dissatisfaction with the commonly received theory of the propagation of sonorous undulations by an elastic medium , advances the hypothesis that each particle of an elastic body , after receiving an impulse in a particular direction , and communi ?
cating that impulse to the adjoining particle , instead of being thereby brought to a state of rest , is carried back by its elasticity with a velo ?
city which continues its motion beyond the point from which it origi ?
nally set out , and is thrown into continual vibration , in a manner analogous to the motion of a pendulum .
He endeavours , on the principle of a continual transfer of the state of each particle to the adja ?
cent particles , to explain the phenomenon of continued sound arising from a prolonged succession of vibrations .
