[ Dec. 18 , on the 25th day .
One of those in Column II had trypanosomes in the blood the day after treatment and died that day .
The results of the combined medication were thus scarcely superior to those of the ethylantimonyl tartrate alone/ for though there were fewer recurrences when atoxyl was added , the mortality from poisoning was higher , so that only two survived for two months as against six of those treated with antimony alone .
It is possible that by a more accurate adjustment of the two drugs the advantages of diminished recurrence and low toxicity might be combined .

] Introductory .
Amakebe is the most important disease of cattle in Uganda .
It attacks the calves soon after they are born , and destroys more than half of them .
Among the native cattle the loss is reported to be as much as 75 per cent. , but , with careful nursing and hand-feeding , this mortality may be reduced to between 20 and 30 per cent. This is an enormous toll to pay , and renders the breeding of cattle in Uganda for dairy purposes , or , indeed , for any purpose , very up-hill work .
Little up to the present has been written as to the nature and causation of Amakebe .
It has been described as a trypanosome disease , but this evidently on insufficient knowledge .
Distribution in Uganda .
Amakebe appears to occur all over the Kingdoms of Uganda , Unyoro , Ankole , and Busoga .
Lieutenant A. D. Fraser , Royal Army Medical Corps , the medical officer lately in charge of the Sleeping Sickness Camp , Sesse , reports , however , the curious fact that it does not occur among the cattle on the Sesse Islands .
Mr. C. W. Hattersley also informs the Commission that 1909 .
] Amakebe : A Disease of Calves in .
257 cows brought to Mengo from Ankole invariably contract the disease , which would go to show that in some parts of Ankole the disease does not occur .
Mr. E. J. Stordy , the chief veterinary officer , British East Africa , states that Amakebe is found at every altitude in that Protectorate .
Dr. A. Theiler , ^C.M.Gr .
, the chief veterinary bacteriologist , Transvaal , who lately visited Uganda , writes that Dr. Lichtenfeld , the principal veterinary officer , German East Africa , told him that a disease similar to Amakebe exists in Euanda , on the western shores of Victoria Nyanza and adjoining Ankole .
It is evident , then , that this disease is widely prevalent in Central Africa , and most disastrous in its effects .
Nomenclature .
In Uganda the disease is known as " kebe , " " makebe , " or " amakebe , " and means calves ' swollen glands , or mumps .
At Ngora , to the west of Mount Elgon , the natives call the disease " angarwe .
" In Unyoro , " masugu .
" In Ankole , " amashuyu " or " amashui .
" Symptoms .
The chief symptom of this disease is the swelling of the lymphatic glands , especially those in the region of the ear , in front of the shoulder , and in front of the hip .
The glands frequently reach a large size , those in front of the shoulder often being three or four inches in length .
They are soft to the touch , giving the impression of an elastic body under the skin .
The hair is rough and staring , the head hangs , the ears droop , and there is frequently a watery discharge from the eyes and nose .
During the illness the temperature runs high , often reaching 107 ' F. or more .
The calf becomes rapidly emaciated , and often a dry , scabby eruption of the skin is seen .
Diarrhoea is frequent , and the dung is often dark in colour , with an evil odour .
The urine never shows any trace of blood , as in redwater .
The duration of the disease is usually about a fortnight , but sometimes the calves get over it in three or four days .
The fever goes , they pick up condition , and the swelling of the glands subsides .
The glands , however , never regain their normal size , but remain permanently enlarged throughout life .
When a calf has recovered from Amakebe it is no longer susceptible to the disease .
It is immune for the rest of its life .
The following cases illustrate the course of the disease:\#151 ; Experiment 1387.\#151 ; To study Amakebe in the Calf .

Temperature Curve in a Case of Amakebe ending Fatally .
From these foregoing cases and the 'post-mortem examinations , it will be seen that amakebe is an acute disease of calves , and that the main features of the post-mortem are Signs of intense anaemia , petechiae of serous membranes , infiltration of jelly-like material into omentum , anterior mediastinum , base of heart , etc. , oedema of lungs , swelling and softening of spleen , haemorrhagic infarcts into lungs , spleen and kidneys , and sometimes ulceration of the mucous membrane of the stomach .
Piroplasms usually found in the Blood of Uganda Cattle .
When the blood of cattle in Uganda is examined microscopically , two parasites are always to be found , though usually in very small numbers .
One of these can readily be recognised as Piroplasma from its large size and the characteristic appearance of the two pear-shaped bodies ( Plate 10 , fig. 1 ) .
It may , however , also appear as irregularly-shaped , amoeboid forms , especially in the spleen ( Plate 10 , fig. 1 ) .
The other parasite is much smaller in size , and is usually seen in the form of a small rod or ring ( Plate 10 , fig. 2 ) .
Both these parasites are inoculable , and appear in the blood of calves without giving rise to any marked disturbance .
Have either of them any connection with Amakebe ?
The following experiments go to show that they have not Experiment 556 .

[ Dec. 18 , Remarks.\#151 ; Six days after the injection of blood containing the Piroplasma bigeminumJ this parasite appeared in the 'blood .
The temperature curve is not affected , nor does the calf appear ill .
It may , therefore , be concluded that Amakebe is not caused by the injection of blood containing either Piroplasma or the small rod and ring form .
It is well known that Piroplasma bigem , inum is carried from affected to susceptible animals by different varieties of the blue tick , as well as other species of ticks .
It would seem that the small rod and ring form of piroplasm is carried by the brown tick , as the following two experiments will show .

The temperature curve is not affected , and the calf shows no signs of Amakebe .
It is evident , then , that the small rod and ring-shaped piroplasms transferred to a susceptible calf by means of brown nymphs do not give rise to amakebe .

265 The following chart shows the course of the temperature :\#151 ; Chart 9.\#151 ; Experiment 659 represents the Temperature Curve of a Calf upon which Infected Brown Adult Ticks had been fed .
The minus and plus signs show the absence or presence of the small rod and ring piroplasm in the blood .
Remarks.\#151 ; Twenty-one days after the infected brown adults had fed on this calf the small piroplasm appeared in the blood .
The temperature curve is only slightly affected , and the calf shows no symptoms of Amakebe .
From the foregoing experiments it may be concluded , then , that the appearance of Piroplasma bigeminum or of the small rod and ring form of piroplasm in the blood of a susceptible calf , whether introduced by the injection of blood or , in the case of the latter , by the agency of the brown tick , is not accompanied by the symptoms of Amakebe .
It also is seen from these experiments that the small rod and ring form is inoculable , is carried by the brown tick , and the incubation period is long .
This corresponds with the description given by Dr. Theiler , Pretoria , of the piroplasm discovered by him in the Transvaal , and named by him Piroplasma mutans .
We may , therefore , consider that the two piroplasms which constantly occur in the blood of Uganda cattle are those known as Piroplasma bigeminum and Piroplasma mutans , and that neither is the cause of Amakebe .
Is Amakebe Inoculable 1 It has been shown that blood containing either Piroplasma bigeminum or Piroplasma mutans if injected into susceptible cattle will give rise to these diseases .
Is it equally true that Amakebe is inoculable ?
The following experiments were carried out to obtain an answer to this question ; \#151 ; Experiment 1902 .

Result of Exposing Susceptible Calves in a Kraal contaminated by Amakebe .
Kampala , the native capital of Uganda , has a bad reputation for-Amakebe .
This is probably due to the number of calves stabled in the vicinity .
Kampala has a large population of both Europeans and natives , and the milk supply is obtained from private cows kept in the town .
The herds of cattle belonging to different individuals are grazed in various parts of the country , but as soon as a cow has calved , she is sent into Kampala to provide milk for her owner .
Almost all the calves brought in die of Amakebe , which brings about an unhealthy state of things in the cattle kraals where the calves are kept during the day .
The following experiments will show the effect of exposing susceptible calves for a few days in a Kampala cattle kraal:\#151 ; Experiment 1590 .

This 1909.1 Amakebe : A Disease of Calves in .
269 disease has been shown to be caused neither by bigeminum nor Piroplasmamutans .
What , then , is it caused by ?
Examination of the Blood in Amdkebe .
When the blood of an animal suffering from Amakebe is examined , many small piroplasms will be seen ( Plate 10 , fig. 3 ) , which appear to be of the same size and shape as Piroplasma mutan , and sometimes a few Piroplasma bigeminum ; otherwise , no new parasite can be said to have come into the blood .
This increase in the number of the small piroplasms in the blood of a calf suffering from Amakebe may be explained by saying that the severe illness has led to an excessive multiplication of the Piroplasma mutans which was already in the blood .
Or , on the other hand , it may be that another species of piroplasm , similar in size and shape to Piroplasma mutans , has appeared in the blood , and that the phenomena of Amakebe are due to it .
Marginal Points.\#151 ; Besides the large and small piroplasms , another kind of body is found in the red blood corpuscles , which Theiler has called marginal points .
In a lecture delivered by him in August , 1909 , at Nairobi , in British East Africa , and published in the ' Agricultural Journal of British East Africa/ October , 1909 , he states : " I have recently come to the conclusion thdt the disease called gall-sickness , and hitherto looked on as a sequel of redwater , is due to the presence of another parasite , which I have called ' Marginal Points ' owing to their position in the red blood corpuscles .
Gall-sickness is , therefore , a separate and distinct disease .
" Dr. Theiler considers it proved that this new disease is transmitted by the blue tick .
This all shows how complicated and difficult to distinguish are the diseases of cattle .
An ox may have Piroplasma bigeminum , small rod-and-ring-shaped piroplasms , marginal points , and one or two species of trypanosome in its blood at the same time .
To which parasite have the different phenomena of the disease to be credited ?
The two following tables give the blood examination in two cases of Amakebe , and illustrate this complexity .
The marginal points are small , deeply-staining bodies , usually placed near the edge of a red blood corpuscle ( Plate 10 , fig. 3 ) .
If these bodies really constitute a new and undescribed parasite , the discovery will be one of the greatest interest .
Bodies similar in everyway to these are found , however , in healthy young rats , goats , calves , etc. , so that it is difficult to believe at once in their parasitic nature .
Bather would they appear to be cell enclosures , due to rapid changes taking place in the blood , such as take place in young animals or in anaemias .
In Amakebe they are sometimes very numerous , and it requires no great stretch of the imagination to see in them the youngest Col. Sir D. Bruce and others .

It may be that both these views are true\#151 ; that some of the so-called marginal points are remains of .chromatin from some previous nuclear structure , and that others are the earliest stages of an intra-corpuscular parasite .
More work is required before any definite conclusion can be arrived at .
Koch 's Granules or Blue Bodies.\#151 ; Another body which may sometimes , though rarely , be seen in the blood of Amakebe calves , is one similar to that first described by Koch , and known as Koch 's Granules or Blue Bodies .

Diagnosis of Amakebe .
What , then , is Amakebe ?
In the opinion of the Commission it is the disease of cattle discovered by Koch , and named by him East Coast Fever .
The chief grounds for this opinion are , the symptoms during life , the appearances after death , the occurrence of a small piroplasm in the blood indistinguishable from Piroplasma parvum , and lastly and chiefly , the presence of the blue bodies in the spleen and other organs .
These bodies have never been known to occur in any other disease , and the diagnosis of East Coast Fever is made in South Africa if such bodies are found in spleen smears .
Amakebe : A Disease of Calves in 27ganda .
Conclusions .
1 .
The blood of cattle in Uganda almost always contains Piroplasma bigeminum and Piroplasma mutans , and the cattle are therefore immune to these two diseases .
2 .
The disease of calves called Amakebe is East Coast Fever , so that very many of the cattle in Uganda are almost immune to this disease .
3 .
Owing to the nature of East Coast Fever , inasmuch as animals recovered from the disease are no longer infective , some calves may escape attack of Amakebe , and so remain susceptible .
4 .
Thus the calves of the Sesse Islands escape Amakebe , and when as grown-up cattle they are transferred to the mainland , they mostly die of East Coast Fever .
5 .
The carriers of East Coast Fever\#151 ; , or brown tick ; Rhipicephalus evertsi , or red-legged tick ; and simus \#151 ; are all common in Uganda .
