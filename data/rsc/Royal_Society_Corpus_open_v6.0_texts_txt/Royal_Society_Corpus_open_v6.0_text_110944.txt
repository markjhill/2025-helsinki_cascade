" On Phlogiston and the Decomposition of Water .
" By W. F. Stevenson , Esq. , F.R.S. The author is of opinion that the evidence on which the modern theory of the composition of water is founded , is fallacious ; and believing water to be a simple body , he conceives that it forms hydrogen by combining with the electric fluid , which he imagines 630 , to be identical with the phlogiston of former chemists .
He cites the opinions of Priestley , Cavendish and Watt , as corroborating his views , and interprets their experiments in conformity with the hypothesis he has adopted. .
