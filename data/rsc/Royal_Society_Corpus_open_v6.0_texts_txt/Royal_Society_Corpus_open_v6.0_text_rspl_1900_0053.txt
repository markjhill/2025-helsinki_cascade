In August last some tubes were filled at low pressure by an improved process with the more volatile gases of the atmosphere.* The *^tr was liquefied directly from that above the roof of the Royal Institution by contact at atmospheric pressure with the walls of a vessel cooled below - 200 ' C. When about 200 c-.c .

condensed , communication with the outer air was closed by a stopcock .
Subsequently , communication was opened , through another stop-cock , with a second vessel cooled by immersion in liquid hydrogen , and a part of the liquid from the first vessel , maintained at -210 ' , was allowed to distil into the second still colder vessel .
When about 10 c.c. had condensed in the solid form in the second vessel , communication with the first vessel was cut off , and a manometer showed a pressure of gas of about 10 to 15 mm. of mercury .
This mixture of gases was passed into tubes previously exhausted by a mercury pump , but before reaching the tubes it had to pass through a U-tube immersed in liquid hydrogen so as to condense less volatile gases , such as argon , nitrogen , oxygen , or carbonic oxide , which might be carried along by those more volatile .
Previous trials with tubes filled in the same way , except that the U-tube in liquid hydrogen was omitted , showed that these tubes contained traces of nitrogen , argon , and compounds of carbon .
The tubes filled with gas which had passed through the U-tube showed on sparking no spectrum of any of these last-mentioned gases , but showed the spectra of hydrogen , helium , and neon brilliantly , as well as a great many less brilliant rays of unknown origin .
In addition , they showed at first the brightest rays of mercury , derived , no doubt , from the mercury pump by which they had been exhausted before the admission of the gases from the liquefied air .
After some sparking the mercury rays disappeared , probably in consequence of absorption of the mercury by the electrodes , which were of aluminium .
In one experiment the mixture of gases in the second vessel , into which a fraction of the liquefied air was distilled as above described , was pumped out without being passed through the U-tube in liquid hydrogen and examined .
This mixture was found to contain 43 per cent , of hydrogen , 6 per cent , of oxygen , and 51 per cent , of other gases\#151 ; nitrogen , argon , neon , helium , Ac.\#151 ; and it was explosive when mixed with more oxygen .
This shows conclusively that hydrogen in sensible proportion exists in the earth 's atmosphere , and if the earth cannot retain hydrogen or originate it , then there must be a continued accession of hydrogen to the atmosphere ( from interplanetary space ) , and we can hardly resist the conclusion that a similar transfer of other gases also must take place .
The tubes containing the residue of atmospheric gases uncondensed at the temperature of liquid hydrogen we have examined spectroscopically .
On passing electric discharges through them , without any condensei in the circuit , they glow with a bright orange light , not only in the capillary part , but also at the poles , and at the negative pole in particular .
The spectroscope shows that this light consists in the visible part of the spectrum chiefly of a succession of strong rays in the red , orange , and yellow , attributed to hydrogen , helium , and neon .
On the Spectrum of the more Volatile Gases of Air .
469 Besides these* a vast number of rays , generally less brilliant , are distributed through the whole length of the visible spectrum .
They are obscured in the spectrum of the capillary part of the tube by the greater strength of the second spectrum of hydrogen , but are easily seen in the spectrum of the negative pole , which does not include the second spectrum of hydrogen , or only faint traces of it .
Putting a Leyden jar in the circuit , while it more or less completely obliterates the second spectrum of hydrogen , also has a similar effect on the greater part of these other rays of , as yet , unknown origin .
The violet and ultra-violet part of the spectrum seems to rival in strength that of the red and yellow rays , if we may judge of it by the intensity of its impressions on photographic plates .
We were surprised to find how vivid these impressions are up to a wave-length 314 , notwithstanding the opacity of glass for rays in that part of the spectrum .
The photographs were taken with a quartz calcite train , but the rays had to pass through the glass of the tube containing the gases .
We have made approximate measurements of the wave-lengths of all the rays which are sufficiently strong to be seen easily or photographed with an exposure of thirty minutes , and give a list of them below .
These wave-lengths are computed to Rowland 's scale , and were deduced from the deviations produced by two prisms of white flint glass for the visible , and of calcite for the invisible , rays .
The wave-lengths assigned to the helium lines are those given by Rung and Paschen , and some of these lines were used as lines of reference .
In general , the iron spark spectrum was the standard of reference .
The tubes when first examined showed the lines of the first spectrum of hydrogen vividly , and the earlier photographs of the spectrum of the negative pole contained not only the violet lines of hydrogen , but also the ultra-violet series as far up as A 377 .
In order to get impressions of the fainter rays , exposures of half an hour or more were required , and a succession of photographs had to be taken so as to get different sections of the spectrum into the middle of the field , where measurement of the deviations would not be impeded by the double refraction of the calc spar .
As the light of the negative pole only was required , the electric discharge was made continuously in one direction only , with the result that the hydrogen lines grew fainter in each successive photograph , and soon disappeared altogether .
Along with the ultra-violet rays , the less refrangible rays of hydrogen also disappeared , so that no trace of the C or F line could be seen , nor yet of the second spectrum , so long as the current passed in the same direction as before .
Reversal of the current soon made the F line show again , so that it seems that the whole of the hydrogen was driven by the current to the positive pole .
The conditions under which this ultra-violet series shows itself are a matter of interest .
It appears here in the midst of a brilliant spectrum due to gases other than 470 Profs .

hydrogen , and yet it is very difficult to obtain a photograph of it when no gas but hydrogen is known to be present , or , at least , to become luminous in the electric discharge .
We have had an opportunity of comparing the spectrum of the volatile residue of air with that of the more volatile part of gas from the Bath spring .
The tube did not admit of the separate examination of the light from the negative pole , but was examined end-on , so that the radiation probably included rays emitted from the neighbourhood of the negative pole .
The whole of the hydrogen had been removed from the Bath gas , but not all the argon .
In the spectrum of this gas the rays of helium are dominant , decidedly stronger than those of neon , although the latter are very bright .
In the spectrum of the residue of atmospheric air , the proportion of helium to neon seems reversed , for in this the yellow neon line is as much more brilliant than the yellow helium line as the latter is the more brilliant in the spectrum of Bath gas .
All the prominent lines in the spectrum of the volatile residue of Bath gas were also in that of the residue of atmospheric air , except the argon lines .
There were , on the other hand , many lines in the latter not traceable in the former , some of them rather conspicuous , such as the ray at about A -166-1 .
It is , of course , probable that such rays are the outcome of some material not contained in the Bath gas .
A Very conspicuous pair of lines appeal 's in photographs of the spectrum of the air residue , at about A 3587 , which is not traceable in the spectrum of Bath gas .
The helium line , A 35874 , is seen in the latter spectrum , but is quite obscured in the former spectrum by the great intensity of the new pair .
This helium ray is really a close double , with the less refrangible component much the weaker of the two , but the new pair are wider apart , and of nearly equal intensities ; this character also distinguishes them from the strong argon line at A 3588-6 .
They are , however , very much more intense at the negative pole than in the capillary , and it will require a good deal more study to determine whether these rays , and many others which we have not tabulated , are due to the peculiarity of the stimulus at the negative pole , or to the presence of a previously unrecognised material .
As our mixture of gases probably includes some of all such gase.-\gt ; a* pervade interplanetary and interstellar space , we early looked in their spectra for the prominent nebular , coronal , and auroral rays .
*Seai thing the spectrum about A 5007 no indication of any ray of about that wave-length was visible in the spectrum of any one of the tlnee tubes which had been filled as above described .
Turning to the other green nebular line at about A 4959 , we found a weak rather diffuse line to which our first measure assigned a wave-length 4958 .
The conettness of this wave-length was subsequently verified by measuring with a micrometer eye-piece the distances of the line from the helium lines A 49224 and A 5015*7 which were in the field of view at the same On the Spectrum of the more Volatile Gases of Air .
471 time .
The position of the line was almost identical with that of the iron spark line A 4957*8 , and the conclusion arrived at was that the wave-length was a little less than 4958 , and that it could not be the nebular live .
There remained the ultra-violet line A 3727 .
Our photographs showed a rather strong line very close to the iron spaxk line A 3727-8 , but slightly more refrangible .
As the line is a tolerably strong one , it could be photographed with a grating spectrograph along with the iron lines .
This was done , and the wave-length deduced from measuring the photograph was 3727'4 .
This is too large by an amount which considerably exceeds the probable errors of observation , and we are forced to conclude that the nebular material is either absent from our tubes , or does not show itself under the treatment to which it has been subjected .
Although the residual gases of the atmosphere uncondensed at the temperature of liquid hydrogen do not show the nebular lines , we found that another tube gave a ray very close indeed to the principal green nebular ray .
This tube had been tilled with gas prepared in the same way as the others , with the exception that , in passing from the vessel into which the first fraction of liquid air was distilled , it was not passed through a U-tube immersed in liquid hydrogen on its way to the exhausted tube .
In consequence it contained traces of nitrogen and argon , and when sparked showed the spectra of these elements as well as those of hydrogen , helium , \amp ; c. The nitrogen spectrum disappeared after some sparking , but the tube still shows rays of argon as well as those of the gases in the other tubes .
On examining the spectrum of the negative pole in the neighbourhood of the principal nebular green ray , a weak ray was seen in addition to those given by the other tubes .
It was found by comparison with the nitrogen rays A 5002-7 and A 5005-7 to be a little less refrangible than the latter of these rays , and by measuring its distance from the nitrogen rays and from the two helium rays A 4922 " 1 and A 5015-7 with a micrometer eye-piece , the wave-length A 5007-7 for the new ray was deduced .
This looks as if we might find the substance which is luminous in nebulae to be really present in the earth s atmosphere , and we hope shortly to be able to verify the observation of it .
Turning to the coronal rays , our tubes emit a weak ray at about A 5304 .
This is not far from the wave-length A 5303-7 assigned by Sir N. Lockyer to the green coronal ray .
It is , however , greater than that assigned by Campbell , namely , 5303*26.* Other lines observed by us near the places of coronal lines are at wave-lengths about 4687 , 4570 , 4358 , 4323 , 4232 , 4220 , 3985 , 3800 .
These are all weak lines except that at A 4232 , which is of tolerable strength , and that at A 4220 , which is rather a strong line .
The wave-lengths 4323 , 4232 , 4220 , and 3800 come very close to those assigned to coronal rays , but * ' Astropli .

the others hardly come within the limits of probable error .
The ray 4220 seems too strong in proportion to the others , but the strength of that at 4232 seems to accord with the strength of the corresponding ray in the corona .
It will be seen that the rays we enumerate above correspond approximately to the stronger rays in Sir N. Lockyer 's list.* Further measures of the wave-lengths of the faint lines are needed before we can say definitely whether or no we have in our tubes a substance producing the coronal rays , or some of them .
As to the auroral rays , we have not seen any ray in the spectrum of our tubes near A 5571*5 , the green auroral ray .
We have observed two weak rays at A 4206 and A 4198 which may possibly , one or both , represent the auroral ray A 420 .
The very strong ray of argon , A 4200'8 , would make it probable that argon was the origin of this auroral ray , if the other , equally strong , argon rays in the same region of the spectrum were not absent from the aurora .
Nor have we found in the spectrum of our tubes any line with the wave-length 3915 , which is that of another strong auroral line .
On the other hand it seems probable that the strong auroral line A 358 may Ire due to the material which gives rrs the very remarkable pair of lines at about the place of N of the solar spectrum , A 3587 , which are very strong in the spectrum of the negative pole , but only faint in that of the capillary part of our tubes .
It may well be that the auroral Discharge is analogous to that about the negative pole .
AN e have also a fairly strong ray at A 3700 , which may be compared to the remaining strong ray observed in the aurora A 3700 .
This , however , is a ray which is emitted from the capillary part of our tubes as well as from the negative pole , and is , moreover , emitted by Bath gas , and may very likely be a neon ray .
We hope to pursue the investigation of this interesting spectrum , and if possible to sort out the rays which may be ascribed to substances such as neon and those which are due to one or more other substances .
The gas from Bath , even if primarily derived from the atmosphere- -which is by no means sure\#151 ; -seems to have undergone some sifting which has affected the relative proportions of helium and neon , and a more thorough comparison of its spectrum with that of the residual atmospheric gases may probably lead to some disentanglement of the rays which originate from different materials .
The arrangement of the rays in series , if that could be done , would be a step in the same direction .
