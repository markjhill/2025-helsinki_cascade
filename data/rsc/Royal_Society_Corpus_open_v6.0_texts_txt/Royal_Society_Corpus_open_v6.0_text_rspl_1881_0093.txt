205 time and increases it at another , and it is also shown that the times of this diminution and increase correspond respectively to the periods when the vagus causes a diminution and increase of the size of the contractions .
The action of the vagus upon the muscular tissue of the ventricle is further shown by its power of removing the inequalities in the size of the ventricular contractions , when as often happens , the ventricle is beating with alternately strong and weak contractions .
Stimulation of the nerve causes this inequality to disappear when it increases the force of the contractions , and to reappear again when it diminishes that force .
The effect of stimulation of the vagus upon the tonicity of the ventricle was studied by the method described elsewhere , * and the author shows that the relaxation between the beats of the ventricle is increased during the stimulation of the nerve , even although the rate of rhythm is not made slower .
The conclusion therefore is drawn , that stimulation of the vagus acts upon the muscular tissue of the ventricle in such a way as to diminish its excitability and lower its tonicity , when it reduces the force of the ventricular contractions , while it increases its excitability and possibly also increases its tonicity when it augments the contraction force .
Finally , it is shown that atropin removes the whole action of the vagus stimulation , and the effects of the local application of curare , muscarin , and atropin are described and discussed .
In conclusion , the author sums up the results of these experiments , and suggests that a series of formative processes are going on in both the muscular tissue and the motor ganglia of the heart , similar to those which occur in gland-cells , and that the vagus produces all its effects by increasing the activity of these processes and not because it contains a multiplicity of fibres , each of which possesses a different function .

[ Dec. 22 , temperature at which certain organic substances pass from the solid to the liquid state .
The apparatus , of which an engraving , on a scale of one-fourth , * is given below , consists of a bath nearly filled with oil of vitriol .
In this is inserted a glass funnel , having on its lower edge six equidistant semicircular cuts of about 5 millims. radius , and , at the end of the neck , four of the same .
A thin test-tube , resting freely on the funnel , contains a bath of paraffin oil , in which the thermometer 's bulb is centrally placed ; against the bulb , in a little tube separately represented , is fixed the substance whose melting point is to be determined .
When the large bath is heated , constrained and regular convection takes place in the liquid ; the effect upon the thermometer is such as to cause the mercury to rise with very great steadiness .
A preliminary series of researches in thermometry has enabled me to give a series of results completely corrected , and in terms of the air thermometer .

The method of purification adopted was based upon what may be termed the principle of multiple successive solvents .
It is well known that small quantities of impurities are prone to cling to substances with great tenacity ; but the observation has most frequently been made in connexion with a single solvent .
One can readily conceive that the tenacity with which a given trace of a foreign body is held , under such circumstances , may be in effect constant .
If , however , we now transfer the mixture to a second solvent , it may be presumed that the trace will be in a condition of altered adhesiveness , and may be much more readily separable .
In accordance with this principle the substances were crystallised from two solvents at least , and the constant melting points of successive fractions recorded .
After every fractional crystallisation , pressure was had recourse to for about twelve hours .
A glance at the table shows that , on the whole , melting point and formula grow together .
The following instances of this law ( M.P.=m Formula ) are adduced:\#151 ; \gt ; G Mr. A. R. Forsyth .

It is evident , however , that this simple relation does not generally prevail ; indeed^ in the ease of isomeric substances , melting point may alter widely , ' while additive formula remains constant .

Under no range of ordinary atmospheric pressure or latitude , and in no ordinary interval of time , are these constants likely to become impaired .
Hence , if the substances referred to be prepared and preserved with average care , and handled with moderate skill , they constitute in themselves a set of thermometric standards , distributed at mean intervals of about 4 ' between 42 ' and 120 ' .
If these substances , or most of them , be at hand , they enable an investigator to at once calibrate and directly refer to the air thermometer any standard mercurial instrument , without the necessary application of any correction whatever .
