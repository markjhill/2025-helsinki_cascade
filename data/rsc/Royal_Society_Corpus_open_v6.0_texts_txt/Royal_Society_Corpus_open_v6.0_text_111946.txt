( Abstract .
) In a paper published in the 'Philosophical Transactions ' for 1859 , p. 371 , Mr. Cayley has investigated the theory of the conic of five pointic contact with any plane curve ; but his method does not appear to admit of direct extension to curves of higher orders than conics having contact with any plane curve .
The method here suggested would admit of such extension ; and it may therefore be said to contain potentially the solution of the general problem of contact .
But the labour of completely working out even the case of a cubic of nine-pointic contact would be very great .
The case of the conic of five-pointic contact has been worked out , and the result agrees with Mr. Cayley 's .
