V. Part of a Letter from Mons. Couzier , Physician in the Infirmaries at Alais , to Dr. Deidier , Professor of Chemistry in the University of Montpelier , concerning a new Experiment made with the Blood of a Person dead of the Plague .
Communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. Woodward , F. R. S. Prof. Med. Gresh .
ON the First of this Month I took an Opportunity of beginning the Experiments you had recommended to me , and of which I had promised to give you an Account .
I took a Quantity of Blood from the Body of a Person dead of the Plague , and mixed it with warm Water , which Mixture I attempted to inject into the Crural Vein of a Dog , but the End of the Syringe being too large to enter the Vein , the Experiment did not succeed .
This made me resolve to try the other Method you had proposed to me , which was to lay some of the same infected Blood upon the Wound .
This I accordingly did , and covered it with a Dressing , which the Dog got off in the Night .
I found the next Morning that the Dog had licked his Wound , and that he refused his Food .
Towards Night he began to bemoan himself , and gave Signs of an approaching Death .
The next Morning I found him dead , the Wound being considerably swelled and gangren 'd , and the Edges round the Swelling were likewise gangrened .
Upon opening the Body we found the Liver something larger than usual , with Spots of a livid Purple , as in the Bodies of Persons dead of the Plague .
In the Stomach was found a Quantity of black coagulated Blood , of the Size of a Hen 's Egg .
This in all Likelihood was what he had swallowed upon licking the Wound .
The Heart was very large , with a black grumous Blood in the Ventricles , and the Auricles were turned blackish and gangrenous .
