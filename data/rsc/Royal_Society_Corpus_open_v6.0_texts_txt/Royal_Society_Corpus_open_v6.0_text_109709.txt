Extract of a Letterfrom the Rev. John Brinkley , D.D. F.R.S. Andrew 's Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin , to the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne , D.D. F.R.S. Astronomer Royal , on the annual Parallax of a Lyre .

] The principal object of Dr. Maskelyne in making this communication , is to inform the Society of a discovery , made by Dr. Brinkley , of the parallax of the annual orbit , which he has ascertained by observations on a Lyrae .

3 ) 7-56 So that by the result of 47 observations , the result is 2"'52 ; and Dr. Brinkley adds , that from the confidence which he has now acquired in his instrument , he has no doubt that the annual parallax exceeds 2 " .
This letter also contains some remarks upon refraction with the co-latitude of the Dublin Observatory , as deduced by means of different formulae .
From these it appears , that the agreement by Delambre 's tables is nearer than by Dr. Bradley 's own formula ; but that Dr. Bradley 's formula , by means of a slight correction , gives a table preferable to that of Delambre .
