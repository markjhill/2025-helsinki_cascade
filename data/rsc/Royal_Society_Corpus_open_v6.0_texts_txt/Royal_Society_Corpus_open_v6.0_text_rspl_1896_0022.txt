On the unknown Lines in the Spectra of certain Minerals .
133 " On the unknown Lines observed in the Spectra of certain Minerals .
" By J. Norman Lockyer , C.B. , F.R.S. Received May 16 , \#151 ; Read June 4,1896 .
In the first note of the series " On the New Oases obtained from Uraninite , " by the distillation method , I remarked* " I have already obtained evidence that the method I have indicated may ultimately provide ns with other new gases , the lines of which are also associated with those of the chromosphere .
" In a subsequent paper " On the Gases obtained from the Mineral Eliasite , " I gave a list of several lines unknown to me , and suggested that they might indicate the existence of a new gas or gases in that mineral , and I addedl Although the evidence in favour of a new gas is already very strong , no final verdict can be given until the spectra of all the known gases , including argon , have been photographed at atmospheric pressure , and the lines tabulated .
This part of the inquiry is well in hand .
" The inquiry above referred to has now been completed and in the following manner:\#151 ; Photographs were taken of the spectra at atmospheric pressure of nitrogen , oxygen , chlorine , carbonic anhydride , coal gas , sulphuric anhydride , phosphoretted hydrogen , and argon , these being the gases which , from the experience t-lius far acquired , are likely to be associated with those given off by minerals .
In addition to these , the lines of mercury , potassium , and platinum , were also photographed .
The lines of platinum are alwrays present in the spectra for the reason that the spark is passed between platinum poles , while the lines of mercury or potassium frequently appear according as the gases are collected over mercury or potash .
The spectroscope employed has a collimator and camera with object glasses of 3 in .
aperture , and focal lengths of 5 ft. and 19 in .
respectively .
Two prisms of 60 ' were used , giving a length of spectrum , of about 1'75 in .
between K and D. In order to facilitate the reduction of the photographs , the solar spectrum was photographed under exactly similar instrumental conditions .
Micrometric measures were made of H and K , and other well-known lines throughout the spectrum , and by means of these and Rowland 's wave-lengths , a curve was carefully constructed .
It may be incidentally mentioned that in the photographs of the spectra of gases at atmospheric pressure , H and K are generally present as pole lines , being probably due to an impurity of calcium in the platinum poles .

unknown In each case in which K was present , the micrometer scale was set to the reading for this line , and the photograph to he reduced then adjusted until the K line was under the cross-wires of the micrometer .
Each line in the spectrum was then in turn brought under the cross-wires , and the micrometer readings noted .
The corresponding wave-lengths were then read off from the curve , and in this way , lists of the wave-lengths of the lines in the various spectra were compiled .
These lists were then all thrown together into one table , giving the wave-lengths and intensities of all the lines recorded , and the spectra in which they appear .
For the wave-lengths thus obtained no greater accuracy than one indicated by four figures is claimed .
It was my intention in the first instance to give five figures from the more elaborate tables of some of the elements given by other observers , but this had to be abandoned in consequence of the considerable variations found , in the tables between the results as given by different observers .
First , as regards the gas from eliasite .
The following list gives the lines obtained in the complete inquiry after the lines due to the old gases have been eliminated .
It should be stated , however , that several of the lines have wave-lengths very near those of the old gases ; these have been retained when the more intense lines of the-old gases are absent from the spectra .
These cases are pointed out in the table .
In the case of some of the lines in the visible part of the spectrum , more accurate wave-lengths have been recorded by means of a four prism Steinheil spectroscope .
These lines are indicated by ( s ) .
Attempts have been made to concentrate the eliasite gas by the process of sparking with oxygen over potash , but the quantity of gas remaining is so small , and so largely admixed with helium and argon , that a new research , using very much more material , is essential .
It should be remarked that the list of lines which have been observed and photographed in the spectrum of the gases from eliasite represents the results of several experiments which have been made with different samples of the mineral .
Some of the lines have only been seen once , while others have ' been noted several times .
This suggests that the origins of the lines are very diverse , and it seems probable that some constituents of the mixture of gases obtained are absorbed by the potash in the process of sparking .
Next , with regard to the other minerals already examined .
As it is impossible for me to go on with this research for the next few months , it seems desirable , in the interest of other workers , to give at the same time a complete list of the unknown lines , so far as the observations have at present gone , indicating their mineral origins , and whether or not lines nearly coincident in position have been observed in any celestial body .

" The Relation between the Refraction of the Elements and their Chemical Equivalents .
" By J. H. Gladstone , D.Sc .
, F.R.S. Received June 3 , 1896 .
This paper is .
intended to give a preliminary account of some recent investigations into the specific refraction of the elements .
It may be conveniently divided into two distinct parts .
The first part is a revision and extension of the list of specific and atomic refractions , which was first published in the ' Phil. Trans. ' for 1870 , and was reprinted with modifications in a lecture given at the Royal Institution in 1877 .
The second part is an amplification of some deductions made in that lecture .
Pakt I.\#151 ; The Specific and Atomic Refractions of the Elements .
The following table contains the atomic weights , the specific refractions , and the atomic refractions of the elements as revised and extended .
For the atomic weights I have adopted the numbers recently published by the American Chemical Society 's Committee on Atomic Weights ( ' J. Amer .
Chem. Soc. , ' vol. 17 ) , revised up to January , 1894 .
In regard to the specific refraction , advantage has beeii taken of the work done in some departments of the inquiry by Landolt , Haagen , Briihl , Topsoe and Christiansen , Mascart , Becquerel , Kanonnikoff , Soret , Kasim , Ghira , Perrot , Tutton , Lord Rayleigh , Edwards , and others , as well as many additional observations made by myself or by Mr. Hibbert .
The atomic refraction is the product of the numbers in the two earlier columns , that is , it equals where P is the atomic weight , and p\#151 ; ljd is the specific refraction , that is , the refractivity divided by the density .
Of course , these are not generally determined by observations of the element itself , but are deduced from those of its salts or other compounds .
