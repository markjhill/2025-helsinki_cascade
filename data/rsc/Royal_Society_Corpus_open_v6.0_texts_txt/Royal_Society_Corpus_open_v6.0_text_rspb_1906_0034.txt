) In a recent number of the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society '* Dr. Henry G. Armstrong published a paper with the above title .
I beg leave to draw attention to the workf I have performed on the saponification of fats by castor-oil seeds , and , without entering into detail , to state my general conclusions .
These are as follows:\#151 ; ( a ) By mechanical means it is possible to separate the cytoplasm of the castor-oil seeds from all the other cellular elements , particularly from the aleurone grains .
( b ) Pure cytoplasm prepared as above alone has the property of hydro-lising fats ; its power is considerable .
( c ) It acts on the fats in the same way as an enzyme , and follows all the laws of enzyme action .
( d ) Nevertheless the active substance of which cytoplasm is but probably the support is not an enzyme ; this substance , which I proposed to call " lipase'idine , " is destroyed by water as soon as it is no longer protected by fats .
( e ) ' It is possible to repeat in vitro with isolated cytoplasm hydrolysis of the fatty matter such as occurs in the seed at the time of germination/ * ' Roy .
