( Abstract .
) The object of this investigation is to study the changes undergone by the species of a small group of Butterflies as they are traced from one locality to another , and to ascertain the bearing of these facts upon the theory of mimicry .
We find the representatives of the Indian Hypolirnnas boliua in a long list of localities in Malaya , Polynesia , and Africa : the local representatives differ from each other and from the Indian form , but they agree in possessing in one or both sexes a more or less superficial resemblance to some conspicuous species belonging to a specially defended group and inhabiting the same locality ; the same is true of the three forms of the female of Hypolimnas misippus .
The facts afford the most convincing evidence of the truth of the theory of mimicry enunciated by H. W. Bates .
The study of these numerous but closely-related forms belonging to the genus Hypolimnas also throws light upon such interesting questions as :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) The special liability of the female to become mimetic .
( 2 .
) The ancestral form from which the various mimetic varieties have been derived .
( 3 .
) The mimetic resemblance to different species in the same locality .
( 4 .
) The divergent conditions under which mimicry appears in closely-related species .
( 5 .
) The relation between selection and variation in the production of mimetic resemblance .
