Hence the latter may wear both on its surface and in its interior a distinct yellow appearance , due to the aggregation of " jaundiced " pyrrhol cells .
Since the tumour evidently suffers through the application of the above-mentioned substances , it does not seem improbable that the pyrrhol cell is also active in transporting substances to the tumour which impede , and in many cases stop , its growth .
Antelope and their Relation to Trypanosomiasis .

] The flies on the Chagwe Lake shore are still capable of infecting monkeys with Trypanosoma gambiense .
Four years and a-half have now elapsed since the Chagwe coast line was officially declared free of population , all villages destroyed " within a zone of two miles bordering the lake , and their inhabitants removed inland .
In spite of precautions , however , there is very little doubt that the islanders continued secretly to visit the mainland until they also were removed in 1909 , and all the island villages destroyed .
Since September , 1909 , therefore , there have been no natives in the fly area except the recalcitrant few , who , at the risk of imprisonment , may from time to time return to their old haunts on the mainland or the islands .
Instances of this have indeed occasionally occurred up to the time of writing .
Apart from the captures made by the Government patrol , I have on several occasions had to report signs of recent native occupation within the prohibited area seen in the course of excursions from Mpumu .
In considering the question of the infectivity of the lake-shore flies , the possibility of infected natives being available as a food supply must still be considered , although this factor is apparently of small importance .
These natives would most likely only venture forth at night time , and would be unlikely to approach the fly ground , which is visited almost daily by the boys from Kibanga .
There remain the canoemen and fly-boys employed by the Laboratory , and in this connection it can only be said that , although 1912.1 Antelope and their Relation to .
157 frequently examined , they have never shown any sign of Sleeping Sickness either clinically or upon blood examination .
As all the mainland flies in the following experiments were caught upon a short stretch of shore to the west of the mouth of Buka Bay , which is visited several times weekly , it is extremely improbable that stray natives alone could account for the prolonged infection .
The suspicion that either the antelope or reptiles which frequent the lake shore are acting as a reservoir for T. gambiense becomes increasingly probable the longer the wild flies remain infective .
As to whether reptiles can serve as a reservoir , the difficulty of obtaining live crocodiles or water-lizards has , up to the present , prevented any satisfactory investigations being carried out on this point .
That the buck are important in this connection was foreshadowed by results obtained in the laboratory experiments with these animals , some of which have proved capable of infecting laboratory-bred more than twelve months after their original infection with T. gambiense .
If an infected buck took up its .
quarters in the forest behind the fly ground , it might account for the recent outburst of infectivity among the fly after a long period of relative quiescence .
From prolonged observation , it would appear that bushbuck , at any rate , among the antelope frequenting the lake shore are very limited in their feeding range .
The objection that these animals would not , by virtue of their nocturnal habits , be exposed to the bites of the fly , may be dismissed at once .
On several occasions I have seen bushbuck feeding at the water 's edge as late as 8.30 A.M. , long before which time the sun is powerful and the fly actively aggressive .
Upon one occasion a herd of waterbuck was seen actually in the water at 11 A.M. , in the full glare of the sun .
Situtunga also , as will be seen later , are by no means so exempt from the attentions of the fly as the general impression of their habits would suggest .
Against the objection that the thick hair of an antelope would prevent a fly from piercing the skin over the greater part of the body , I may say that I have observed Stomoxys in numbers vigorously sucking blood on the haunches and sides of the body of a newly-killed bushbuck , regions where the hair is exceedingly thick .
As regards the possibility of the longevity of the fly affording a solution of the problem , I am unaware of any evidence of palpalis surviving for more than 227 days\#151 ; -an observation recorded by Dr. Kleine .
With a view , then , to completing the chain of evidence incriminating the lake-shore antelope , the experiments given below were ^undertaken .
Owing to the nature of the country , the expectations of a positive result from the mainland were extremely poor , as the places where buck can be shot are not necessarily Dr. H. L. Duke .
[ Feb. 26 , places where fly abound .
In the immediate vicinity of the fly ground the thick forest absolutely precludes shooting .
The results obtained on Damba by Hammerton and Bateman in 1910 , and again by Carpenter in May , 1911 , showing that the flies on this uninhabited island are apparently maintaining their infectivity undiminished , suggested the scene for the experiments .
The only species of antelope found upon the islands of Lake Victoria Nyanza is the Situtunga ( Tragelaphusspekei ) .
Since the removal of the natives from Damba , these animals have increased greatly in numbers , and at present their tracks may be seen at almost any suitable point on the shore of the island .
As will be seen below , events justified the experiment and revealed the parallel in nature to the infections induced in the laboratory .
These investigations include , in addition to antelope , all other available vertebrates whose habits bring them into contact with the fly .
In every case where possible the titrated blood was injected into a monkey and a goat and smears prepared .
On rare occasions fresh preparations were examined .
Certain mammalian trypanosomes other than gambiense were obtained in the experimental goats , and these are also discussed below .
The following is a brief summary of the experiments on the infectivity of the wild flies for T. gambiense , carried out during the period April , 1911 , to January , 1912 , covered by the paper Table I. 1 Date .

On Lwagi Island , where there are no antelope , it was impossible to obtain a sufficient number of fly to constitute evidence on the subject of T. gambiense .
It will , however , be seen below that there are some grounds for believing that the negative results obtained with Lwagi flies are due to the absence of antelope from this island .
The actual injection experiments will now be considered .

It is , however , probable that the herds , in the course of their wanderings , reach the lake shore from time to time , so that they may be considered in the present discussion .
All the other animals in Table IY were shot along the lake edge .
On numerous occasions trypanosomes have been studied in the blood of Situtunga 173 and 356 ( see Table V ) .
These agree with T. uniforme , as regards morphology and movement .
Repeated attempts to subinoculate from both these antelope into sheep and goats have , however , up to the present failed .
This failure to infect goats with the blood of game known to contain trypanosomes morphologically identical with T. uniforme has been already reported by Fraser and myself .
Experiments on these two antelope conducted with laboratory-bred G. palpalis show that only the proboscis is infected , the hypopharynx invariably containing a small number of free trypanosomes .
This is another point of agreement with T. uniformet which would thus appear the commonest antelope trypanosome of the Mpumu neighbourhood .
The organism referred to above as T. ingens in Experiment 173 has only been observed in fresh preparations .
It is a large trypanosome with a constant , slow , rippling motion and a very wide undulating membrane .

173 and 356 are still alive at the laboratory .
T. ingens of Experiment 551 was seen in stained preparations and answered to the description given by the 1908-10 Commission for this trypanosome .
The reasons for the diagnosis of T. gambiense in the above table will be given below .
It may be mentioned that Situtunga 173 has developed T. gambiense in its blood after being fed upon for five days by flies infected with this trypanosome .
The obtaining of T. gambiense from Experiments 402-3 and 509-10 are , of course , by far the most important result so far obtained during the examination of the lake-shore game .
It is , therefore , necessary to consider fully all possible sources of fallacy in these experiments and to exclude them as far as possible .
Upon this question Dr. Carpenter , at whose camp on Damba Island I made my headquarters , has kindly expressed his views as follows:\#151 ; The " Situtunga " Experiment .
" On considering this important result a possible source of fallacy at once suggests itself , namely , that as the monkey was infected whilst on Damba Island , the trypanosomes may have come from a glossina , for I have shown in a ' Progress Report ' that the Glossinse on Damba Island are still capable of infecting a monkey .
VOL. LXXXV.\#151 ; B. M Dr. H. L. Duke .
[ Feb. 26 , " This objection , formidable as it is on paper , is not so when the local conditions are thoroughly appreciated .
In the first place , that part of the coast line where is the little promontory on which my camp has been since March is not sufficiently shaded for G-lossince , which are only present in very small quantity .
Moreover , the whole locality round the camp has been very completely cleared , and the edge of the jungle at the base of the promontory , in which there are few flies , is some 50 yards away from the nearest hut , and 100 yards at least from the monkey 's quarters .
" Also , if an occasional fly should accompany the canoe back from that part of the shore where flies are very numerous ( nearly two miles away to the south-west ) it would not be carried on to the monkey 's quarters , but would be intercepted by the boys ' huts .
As a matter of fact it is an exceptional occurrence to see any Glossinse in the cleared area , and those that are occasionally seen are probably the bred flies which have escaped during manipulations , and these very quickly leave the locality .
" It might be suggested that one of these may have bitten an infected canoeman or fly-boy , and , subsequently , the experimental monkey ; but I think it must be an exceptional occurrence for a monkey to be bitten by a glossina .
A tame monkey which has been with me on the island since April , and has never become infected , is immediately aroused to alertness , even when half asleep , by the buzz of a glossina , and when one of my bred flies accidentally escapes the monkey is all eagerness to catch it , whereas an ordinary fly attracts little attention .
" Moreover , I have no reason to suppose that any of the natives with me on the island are potential sources of T. gambiense , and blood from all the fly-boys ( who are most exposed to infection ) has been injected into a monkey with negative result .

] Antelope and their Relation to Trypanosomiasis .
163 It may in addition be pointed out in the case of Experiments 509-510 that both monkey and goat developed Tgambiense\#151 ; confirmed in the latter by sub-inoculation into a monkey as well as in stained preparations ; moreover , the goat was tethered in the camp some distance from the monkeys ' boxes .
Since May , 1911 , Dr. Carpenter has always had two monkeys in residence in the boxes left by Hammerton and Bateman , and though examined from time to time he has never had a case of spontaneous infection by stray flies .
The following is a brief history of the animals which serve as a control to my experiments on Damba Island :\#151 ; Monkey A.\#151 ; Arrived Damba , May 1 , 1911 , and was immediately used to test infectivity of wild Damba flies .
Became infected on May 15 , and was immediately shot .
Monkey B ( into which the blood of Situtunga 402-3 was injected).\#151 ; Arrived Damba , May 25 , 1911 , and between then and September 25 , when the injections were made , a period of four months , was examined on 19 occasions , with negative results .
On October 2 was negative , and on October 3 Dr. Carpenter first discovered trypanosomes in its blood .
Monkey C.\#151 ; Arrived Damba , May 29 , 1911 , and from that date was used by Dr. Carpenter to test the infectivity of wild palpalis from the neighbourhood of Damba .
It was examined on 36 occasions with no result during the ensuing five months .
On November 6 it became infected , having by this time been fed upon by several thousands of wild fly .
Monkey D.\#151 ; Tame monkey kept by Dr. Carpenter , and exposed to all the risks run by the experimental monkeys .
Arrived Damba , March , 1911 .
In perfect health up till October 9 , 1911 , when , at my request , it was first examined .
Since that date has been examined weekly , and has never shown trypanosomes , and is in perfect health .
Monkey E ( into which blood of Situtunga 509-10 was injected).\#151 ; Arrived Damba , October 8 , 1911 , having previously been examined regularly at Mpumu with negative results .
Examined daily from November 3 to November 17 inclusive , with negative results .
On November 5 and 6 received blood of Situtunga 509-10 , respectively .
On November 18 trypanosomes first appeared in its blood .
Monkey F.\#151 ; Arrived on Damba , November 3 , 1911 , in perfect health .
On November 4 injected with the blood of hippo , Experiment 547 Table IV ) .
Between November 3 and December 12 examined on 21 occasions , with negative results .
At present in excellent health .
Finally , it may be pointed out that the incubation period in the case of all three positive experiments was in keeping with previous experience .
Thug Dr. H. L. Duke .
[ Feb. 26 , Monkey 401 first showed trypanosomes on the eighth day after inoculation .
Monkey 511 showed first 13 days after the first injection , and Goat 512 developed T.uniforme 10 days , and T. gamUense and T. vivax 15 days after inoculation .
With reference to the prolonged incubation period in the case of Monkey 511 , it may be noted that , in the only case where an inoculation from the laboratory antelope has recently proved positive , the incubation period in the monkey before trypanosomes appeared was 18 days .
A consideration of the conditions on Damba Island affords a vivid picture\#151 ; a vicious circle in constant operation , only awaiting the reappearance of the natives to reproduce the recent epidemic .
With the exception of papyrus areas , practically the whole shore line of the island is to a greater or less extent fly-ridden , one portion being occupied by the famous fly-beach , from which for several years some thousands of pupse have been brought monthly to Mpumu .
In his recent report to the Royal Society , Carpenter describes an infection of a monkey with 885 flies caught in May , 1911 , on this pupa ground .
The situtunga are multiplying rapidly in the absence of the natives , and are far less restricted in their range than formerly .
The common conception regarding the habits of this antelope , as being a creature spending its days in the papyrus swamps where no fly are found , and only visiting dry land at night to feed , does not apply to Damba .
During the short time I spent on the island , I frequently saw situtunga from the canoe at the water 's edge both morning and evening .
As late as 9 a.m. I have seen them feeding among the ambatch stems in places where fly were numerous , and where it required constant vigilance to avoid being bitten .
On one occasion I observed a female on the actual pupa-beach at 8.30 a.m. in the full glare of the sun .
There is also a long extent of shore , where , owing to comparatively recent sinking of the lake level , there is now a strip of grass and bushes some 40-50 yards wide , dotted here and there with ambatch trees , between the forest and the water 's edge .
This is a favourite haunt of the situtunga , and tsetse are present throughout its extent .
There is therefore every natural facility for that frequent interchange of infection between fly and buck which constitutes a true reservoir .
On the neighbouring coast of the mainland , the fly are probably brought into far less frequent contact with antelope .
The stretches of shore where fly are numerous are few and far between , and the number of antelope which actually visit any given fly area would be small .
On the mainland also , the situtunga would probably only be available to the fly residing in the immediate neighbourhood of the papyrus , and thus the most typically lake-shore antelope would be denied to the fly where the latter are most numerous .

A total of 4258 flies caught on Lwagi Island , where there are no antelope , but only hippo , birds , and reptiles , failed to produce either of these trypanosomes .
Diagnosis of the Trypanosome Obtained in Monkeys 401 and 511 .
There seems no reason to doubt that the trypanosome obtained in monkeys from the blood of Situtunga 402-3 and 509-10 is identical with the species obtained by Hammerton and Bateman from wild Damba flies in May\#151 ; June , 1910 , and again in May , 1911 , by Hr .
Carpenter .
The Damba natives suffered severely during the epidemic , as the conditions on the island ensured constant exposure to the bites of the fly .
These fly are still infective to monkeys , and the trypanosome carried by them answers to T. morphologically , and as regards the disease in monkeys .
In the face of such facts a more comprehensive examination seemed hardly necessary .
In the present instance , however , the importance of the issue at stake makes a careful investigation imperative . .
Of the trypanosomes previously described from Uganda T. brucei is the only one which claims attention .
Other species as T. pecaudi and T. " dimorphon " are also suggested by the morphology .
The fact that T. brucei is supposed to be non-pathogenie to man emphasises the importance of excluding this species in* diagnosing a trypanosome derived from wild antelope. .
Behaviour of the Damba Trypanosome in Glossina palpalis .
In an experiment comprising 101 clean laboratory-bred G. palpalis fed upon Monkey 401 , whose blood contained the Damba trypanosome , two infected flies were obtained on the 17th and 57th days respectively .
The clean monkey upon which they were fed developed trypanosomes answering to T. gambiense .
The 57th day fly showed a typical T. gambiense Table TIL Dr. H. L. Duke .

This latter fact would point to the exclusion of pecaudi and T. dimorphon from the differential diagnosis .
A second experiment , in winch 51 laboratory-bred flies were used , proved negative .
An experiment comprising 79 laboratory-bred palpalis fed upon Monkey 511 gave one infected fly on the 42nd day .
The gut only contained trypanosomes .
The clean monkey upon which these flies were fed ran away I without having ever shown trypanosomes .
Morphology.\#151 ; Dimorphism marked , the extremes 35/ * and 17/ * .
The long or short type may predominate from day to day , but intermediate forms are always present .
Forms over 31 / * in length are very uncommon ; the longest examples were met with in Experiment 504 , a monkey infected from Experiment 401 , through laboratory-bred flies .
Table YII on opposite page shows the distribution ' of length in 10 experimental animals .
The Protoplasm is devoid of granules in all preparations examined from goats and monkeys .
In both the fats examined granules were present in numbers both behind and in front of the nucleus .

Dr. H. L. Duke .
[ Feb. 26 , A free portion is always discernible in the flagellum , though , in the case of the stumpy forms , it is often extremely short .
Movement.\#151 ; No marked translation ; remains actively wriggling in one spot , making occasional short gliding excursions about the field .
Often the side-to-side movements are of a jerky character .
These experiments though few in number afford valuable evidence in favour of T. gambiense to the exclusion of T. brucei .
The sub-chronic type of the disease in rats is perhaps the most striking point in the above table .
Action of Human Serum.\#151 ; The assumption that T. brucei is non-pathogenic to man rests chiefly on the susceptibility of this trypanosome to human serum .
Laveran and Mesnil , * in describing the action of this serum on animals infected with T. brucei , confine their attention chiefly to rats .
The following experiments in which animals suffering from the Damba trypanosome were treated with human serum may now be considered :\#151 ; Animal .

In the case of the rats this did not occur .
It won thus appear that there is some condition present in monkeys which causes them to react to human serum , m condition not being present in rats .
Experiments conducted in vitro on the same lines appear to confirm !
tl conclusion .
The negative results obtained with Rats 477 and 576 , together with the positive result obtained wit the human strain in Monkey 391 , neutralises what at first appeared evidence in favour of T. brucei .
As regards the diagnosis of the three species , of trypanosomes described in Goat 512 ( Table V ) , the following methods were employed:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Examination of fresh blood preparations .
By this means T. uniforme was identified in the blood of Situtunga 510 , and in the case of Goat 512 all three species were recognisable .
( 2 ) Examination of stained films .

( 3 ) Sub-inoculation .
The blood of Goat 512 inoculated into Monkey 525 produced T. gambiense in the blood of the monkey .
Conclusions .
( 1 ) That the continued infectivity of the wild on Damba Island to monkeys may be explained by the fact that the situtunga on that island are acting as a reservoir to T. gambiense .
( 2 ) That the continued infectivity of the mainland flies to T. gambiense may probably be explained on a similar hypothesis , including possibly the other species of antelope frequenting the lake shore , i.e. waterbuck , bushbuck , duiker and reedbuck .
( 3 ) That no positive evidence can be adduced from the above experiments to show that hippopotamus can serve as a reservoir .
( 4 ) That the continued infectivity of the lake-shore flies to T. vivax and T. uniforme is also due to the antelope which serve as a reservoir for these trypanosomes .
