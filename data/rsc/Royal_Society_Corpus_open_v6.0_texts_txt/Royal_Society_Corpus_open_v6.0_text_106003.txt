4 42 59 The observations here referred to , made by Capt. HOLLAND and others of his party , are to be found in Philosophical Transactions , Vol. LVIII .
for the year 1768 , and Vol. LIX .
for 1769 , and other papers , sent to me from Capt. HOLLAN D , which I have the honour of presenting to the Royal Society , together with this paper .
I have re-computed the times of Ensign SPROUL E ' S observations made at GASPEEBA Y , applying the equation of corresponding altitudes , which he had neglected ; and have annexed them to his account of his observations , transmitted to me by Capt. HO LL AN D. It appears , that the observations of Capt. HO LL AN D , and his party , were sometimes made with a two feet reflector of SHOR T ' S construction , and sometimes with an achromatic telescope of DOLLOND of 10 , and at other times , one of 12 feet .
The observations at the ROYALOBSERVATORY were also made with different telescopes , at different times ; sometimes with a two feet reflector of SHOR T ' S construction ; sometimes with a treble object glass telescope of DOLLON D , of 31/ 2 feet ; but oftener with a6 feet reflector , of SHOR T ' S construction .
These circumstances are always noted against the observations : I have only made use of the observations of the first satellite , as being much more exact than those of the others .
I reckon , that the 6-feet reflector shows an immersion of the first satellite of Jupiter later , and an emersion sooner , by 20~ , than a 2-feet reflector ; or by 13~ , than a 31/ 2-feet treble object glass refractor , or a 10 or 12-feet double object glass refractor of DO LL ON D. LON D. These allowances were accordingly made in deducing all the differences of meridians expressed in the last column of the foregoing table .
The observations made at GREENWIC H , opposed to those made in NORTHAMERIC A , are either corresponding ones , which however is very seldom the case , or else the nearest to them that were observed .
The error of the computed time of the eclipse in the Nautical Almanac was found by the nearest observation at Greenwich , and the time of the Nautical Almanac , thus corrected , compared with the time observed in North America , gave the difference of meridians between the place and Greenwich ; farther reduction being first made for the difference of telescopes , if necessary , in the manner already explained .
It is however to be understood , that , in this way of deducing the difference of meridians , by comparing an eclipse observed at Greenwich with another eclipse observed elsewhere , the interval of time between the two eclipses ought to be very short ; otherwise it cannot be supposed , that the errors of the tables should continue the same .
Hence it has happened , that many of the North American observations have been lost for this use , for want of observations near enough to them made at Greenwich .
In some other cases , indeed , I have been obliged to compare together observations made with a greater interval between them than I should have chosen , but for fear of losing some useful comparisons .
As the preceding table affords several determinations of the longitude of most of the places , it may be proper to point out , how the true difference of meridians may be best deduced .
To take a mean of the several results will not be the proper method , except the several observations had been either all immersions , or all emersions ; but when both immersions and emersions have been observed , then the best method will be , to take a mean of all the results given by the immersions , and a mean of all the results given by the emersions , separately ; the mean of these two means will be the true difference of the meridians , and will be much more to be depended upon , than if it was deduced from immersions or emersions only ; because this method of comparison removes the constant errors arising from the differences of the telescopes , air , and eyes of the distant observers ; these causes of error affecting the separate results of immersions and emersions , in contrary ways .
I shall now only add the difference of meridians deduced from the observations contained in the preceding table , by taking a proper mean between the several results .
