On the Comparative Toxicity of Theobromine and , as Measured by their Direct Effect upon the Contractility of Isolated Muscle .
The isolation of caffeine from coffee is generally assigned to Eobiquet , Pelletier and Caventou ( 1821 ) , * though the so-called coffee base , obtained a year previously by Eungef was probably impure caffeine .
The identity of theine , extracted from tea by Oudey ( 1838 ) , j with caffeine was established by the analyses of Jobst ( 1843).S The association of caffeine with uric acid was noted originally by StenhouseJ ] who found the latter in a sample of Paraguay tea .
Theobromine was first isolated by WoskrcsenskylT from cocoa ( 1842 ) , and its association with alloxan , on the one hand , and caffeine on the other , was established by subsequent observers .
According to the investigations of Emil Fischer ( 1894\#151 ; 1898 ) , ** uric acid , theobromine , caffeine , and other allied substances , are derived from the parent base purine , to which the following , as one of two alternative formulae , was eventually assigned:\#151 ; * ' Berzelius Jahresber .

] Comparative Toxicity of Theobromine and Caffeine .
569 The figures denote the relative positions of the substituting groups proposed originally by Fischer , and now adopted in chemical literature .
Theobromine is 3.7-dimethyl-2.6-dioxypurine , and caffeine or theine is 1.3.7-trimethyl-2.6-dioxypurine:\#151 ; OC NOIL nch3 Theobromine .
CHgN OC OC NCH nch3 Caffeine .
CH NH Hypoxanthine is monoxypurine and guanine its mono-amino derivative , xanthine is dioxypurine and uric acid is trioxypurine .
Unfortunately , the bases guanine and xanthine , as also uric acid , are too insoluble in water ( less than 1 part in 1000 ) for the purpose of our investigation .
Among coffee extractives is caffeo-tannic acid , Ci5Hi802 , which occurs as a magnesium or calcium salt in the berries ( Eochleder)* ; it is a gummy substance readily soluble in water and alcohol .
The substances investigated are theobromine , caffeine , caffeo-tannic acid , and an artificial mixture of caffeine and tannic acid , as also extracts of tea and coffee ( with or without caffeine ) .
Caffeine ( Trimethyldioxypurine ) .
All the records obtained were similar in type , the muscle going into contracture , and abolition finally taking place in a longer or shorter time according to the concentration .
In the record given ( fig. 1 ) , which is quite characteristic , a 200 solution of caffeine ( 0T per cent. ) produced abolition in 1T5 minutes ; in other experiments on other days with solutions of the same concentration the times were 105 and 11 minutes respectively , and in a fourth experiment on a cooler day , and consequently at a lower temperature ( which , however , we omitted to note ) , the time was 14 minutes .
With a solution of double the concentration , namely , n/ 100 ( 0'2 per cent. ) , abolition took place in 4 minutes .
In earlier experiments with caffeine hydrochloride and hydrobromide solutions ( n/ 200 concentration ) contracture took place immediately ; this more rapid effect is attributable to the conjoint action of the caffeine and the * * Annalen , ' vol. 59 , p. 300 .

A sample of this substance ( Merck ) , a brown gummy material , as previously described , was made up to w/ 100 concentration ( 0-32 per cent. ) in normal saline , but was found to be practically inactive .
A solution of double the strength ( n/ 50 or O'6 5 per cent. ) produced abolition in 21 minutes , the record resembling that of caffeine .
By way of comparison a solution was made up of n/ 100 ( = 0*2 per cent. ) caffeine and 0-5 per cent , of a sample of tannic acid , presumably obtained from oak-bark ; the time required for abolition was 20 minutes , namely , five times longer than that for caffeine of the same concentration by itself .
The record can be characterised as a retarded caffeine record , suggesting that the free tannic acid added to the caffeine causes some secondary or retarding chemical change .
Theobromine ( Dim ) .
All the records obtained with this base were similar in type , and resembled those of caffeine ; in the record given ( fig. 2 ) for a theobromine solution of nf200 ( or 0'09 per cent. ) concentration , abolition took place in 6-5 minutes .
The results obtained are summarised as under:\#151 ; Theobromine .

] Comparative Toxicity of Theobromine and Caffeine .
571 The concentrations are in the ratio 1 : T5 : 2 and the times are in the ratio 3:2:1 , with an error of 0*5 minute , which is that of experiment .
On comparing theobromine and caffeine solutions of like concentration , namely , nf200 ( which was actually done simultaneously with a pair of muscles ) , the times required for abolition are in the ratio 6-5 :11 or 1 : T7 ; again , on comparing a n/ 300 solution of theobromine with a 200 solution of caffeine the times are in the ratio 9 :11 or 1 : 1*2 ; which would be nearly equivalent to a ratio 1 : T8 in terms of the same concentration .
From these results we conclude that the toxic value of theobromine is to that of caffeine approximately as 1*7 :1 for equal molecules or 1*8 :1 for equal weights .
It appears that the introduction of the methyl group into theobromine to form caffeine lowers the toxic value , a result which is the converse of that obtained in the case of the parafhnoid alcohols* and unlike those of methyl stovaine and stovaine , f and of pyridine and picoline , | in which such introduction of a methyl group produced approximately no alteration of activity .
We also made a few observations with ordinary extracts of coffee , with and without caffeine , and of tea ; herein we are indebted to the Life Belt Coffee Company , Ltd. , for supplying us with samples of " coffee freed from caffeine " ; it appears from the analyses given that by the process adopted 90 per cent. , or thereabouts , of the caffeine is removed .
For the purposes of these experiments we made our " tea " and " coffee " by boiling in physiological saline solution in the proportion of 2'5 and 5 grammes per 100 c.c. , filtering oft ' the solid matter and using the extracts .
In order to determine the amount of solid dissolved under such conditions 50 c.c. of the 5 per cent , extracts were evaporated to dryness and the residue weighed .

Saline Coffee Extract .
Similarly a 1-per-cent , extract produced no effect ; on substituting a 5-percent .
extract , the effect was almost instantaneous , and the recovery , though incomplete , followed immediately after running in saline solution .
After an interval of 19 minutes a 2'5-per-cent .
extract was substituted , which caused a contracture with abolition in 12'5 minutes , followed by recovery on running in saline solution .
There do not appear to be any very marked differences between the saline tea and coffee extracts ; though possibly the contracture is more marked in the case of the latter , the recovery is less marked in the case of the former .
Such a result would be probable , if the toxic effect both of tea and of coffee is mainly due to the caffeine ( theine ) present , the tannic acid , also a constituent of both , producing only a secondary effect as regards muscle proteins .
But with the extract of the " caffeine-free coffee " ( fig. 5 ) there was Fig. 5.\#151 ; Saline Coffee " freed from caffeine .
" Upper line 5 per cent. Lower line 2'5 per cent. no such marked contracture on adding a 5-per-cent , extract , and abolition took place in ( nearly ) nine minutes ; in the case of a 2'5 extract , abolition took place in 21 minutes , followed by recovery on substituting saline solution .
The differences between the effects produced by ordinary and " caffeine-free " coffee are most marked , though in the case of the 2'5-per-cent .
extracts they would doubtless have been less pronounced if the experiments had been both equally performed with a fresh muscle .

Method for the [ June 17 , But , as stated above , the experiments , though striking in their results , were rather of a domestic character than of physical precision .
However this may be , the difference between ordinary and " caffeine-free " coffee affords a further proof that the toxic effect is principally due to the presence of the caffeine .
A New Method for the Quantitative Estimation of Hydrocyanic Acid in Vegetable and Animal Tissues .
By Dr. A. D. Waller , F.R.S. ( Received June 17 , \#151 ; Read June 30 , 1910 .
) ( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , South Kensington .
) The evolution of hydrocyanic acid by laurel leaves ( ) in consequence of congelation , or of their exposure to the action of anaesthetic vapours , was first pointed out by Raphael Dubois.* It has been studied more recently by GuignardJ who has introduced an extremely delicate test for the presence of hydrocyanic acid by sodium picrate paper , and quite recently this test has been applied by F. E. Armstrong^ for the rapid detection of ferments of the emulsin class .
The reaction was first studied by HlasiwetzS in 1859 , who gave the following equation :\#151 ; C6H3N307 + 3KCN + 3H20 = C8H4KN506 + C02+NH3 + 2KH0 .
v____v____ ; Potassium isopurpurate .
* The reaction appeared likely to afford a convenient instance for the simultaneous observation of chemical and electrical changes taking place in living protoplasm under the influence of anaesthetics , and the immediate purpose of this investigation was to determine the parallelism or the want of parallelism between the course of the two changes\#151 ; chemical and electrical .
Qualitative experiments in which the evolution of hydrocyanic acid from laurel leaves was followed by means of picrate paper , the leaves being enclosed in corked tubes containing the vapour of ( 1 ) chloroform ; ( 2 ) ether ; ( 3 ) alcohol ; and ( 4 ) water , gave results in the order of intensity ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , * K , .
