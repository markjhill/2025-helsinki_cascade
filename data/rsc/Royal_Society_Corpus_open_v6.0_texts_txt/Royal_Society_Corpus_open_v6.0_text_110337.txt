A paper was read , entitled , " On certain properties of Vapour .
" By the Rev. Dionysius Lardner , LL. D. F.R.S. It has been generally supposed , that if a certain volume of aqueous vapour , contained in a vessel that was in capable of transmitting heat , were compressed by an exterior force into a space sufficiently small , a part of it would be restored to the liquid state .
The author considers this assumption to be at variance with the doctrine of latent heat , and inconsistent with the results deduced from the experiments which have established that the absolute quantities of heat necessary to convert a given weight of water into steam , under all pressures , are sensibly equal .
It follows , from this principle , that steam raised from water , under any pressure whatever , admits of indefinite com ?
pression and expansion , without returning to the liquid state .
The effect of its compression will be to evolve heat and raise the temperature ; that of its expansion , to absorb heat and lower the temperature : but in every state of density it will have exactly that temperature which it would have were it immediately raised from water under the pressure which it has acquired by compression or expansion .
The only cause of the restoration of vapour to the liquid form is the abstraction of heat from it 5 and this cause will be equally operative , whatever may be the state of the vapour with respect to density : but compression alone , without such abstraction of redundant heat , can never convert any portion of vapour into a liquid .
In accordance with these views , the author regards the permanent gases as vapours , containing a large quantity of redundant heat .
