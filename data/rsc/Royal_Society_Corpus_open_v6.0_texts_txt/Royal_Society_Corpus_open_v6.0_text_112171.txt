Supplementary Note to Dr. Davy 's Papler on Birds ; received November 25 , 1865 .
Mention is made in the paper referred to of the comparatively low temperature of certain birds .
Another example of the same kind occurs in the goose ; in two instances I have found its temperature in recto 104 ?
, and in a third 103 ?
'5 .
The trials were made in November ; the geese had not previously been confined , were about seven months old , fully feathered ( few birds have a warmer clothing ) , and the weather at the time was moderate ; the temperature of the open air between 40 ?
and 50 ?
Fahr. Notice is also taken of a bird , the grouse , not remarkable for power of flight , having air in its femora as well as in its humeri .
I have since found another example of the same kind in the pheasant , a bird even of feebler flight ; in no instance , and I have examined several specimens , have I detected marrow in either of these bones .
In reference to the statement implying that those bones of birds which contain air in their adult state , in an earlier stage contain marrow , later observations have led me to infer that , instead of marrow , these bones have their canals impacted with blood-vessels , which in process of the bird 's growth shrink and are absorbed .
