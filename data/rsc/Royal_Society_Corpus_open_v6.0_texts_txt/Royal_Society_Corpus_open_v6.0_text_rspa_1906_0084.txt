Prefatory Note by Sir William Ramsay.\#151 ; When the cubical mineral from Ceylon , sent to me by Mr. Holland in December , 1903 , and named by Professor Dunstan " Thorianite , " was analysed by several of my students , it was evident that although in the main , as shown by the analysis made by Mr. G. S. Blake under Professor Dunstan 's supervision , it consisted of the oxides of thorium and uranium , its composition is by no means simple .
The analyses referred to were made by Dr. R. D. Denison , by Mr. Gimingham , and by Mr. Le Rossignol ; they are as follows ( for convenience of reference-Mr .
Blake 's analyses are also appended ) :\#151 ; The extraction of radiothorium by Dr. 0 .

Another of the objects of his research was to determine how the radio-activity of thorianite is distributed over its various constituents .
Assuming , as looks more than probable , that the radio-active constituents of thorianite , like those of similar radio-active minerals , are in process of change , it is to be expected that by working on comparatively large quantities these bodies and their products can be identified , even though in themselves they may not display the property of radio-activity .
] The methods employed in the chemical analysis of thorianite , together with the results obtained , will form the first section of this account , and the second part will deal with experiments relating to the radio-activity of the several fractions into which the mineral was separated .
The total quantity of mineral taken for analysis was 24*373 grammes .
On treatment with concentrated boiling nitric acid the greater part of it dissolved .
After decantation , the residue was once more boiled with fresh acid , and only a small quantity remained insoluble .
The solutions were then mixed , evaporated to dryness , heated to 130 ' to render any silica present insoluble , and redissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid .
The residue , which was dried , ignited , and weighed , was non-volatile on treatment with hydrofluoric and sulphuric acids ; on testing it , it proved to be zirconium oxide , which had separated out as a basic salt .
Sulphuretted hydrogen was then passed through the hot liquid ; the precipitated sulphides were treated with a solution of sodium sulphide , in which a portion dissolved .
The residue dissolved almost completely in dilute nitric acid , only a trace remaining , which was soluble in regia after excess of acid had been removed by evaporation it was dissolved in water , and could be reprecipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen .
Its amount , however , was too small to prove undoubtedly that it was mercuric sulphide ; mercury , however , has been found ( by Miss Evans ) in residues from a larger amount of mineral .
Sulphuric acid was added to the nitric acid solution , and the precipitated lead sulphate was filtered off , dried , and weighed .
Ammonia was then added to the filtrate ; this should have precipitated bismuth as hydroxide ; the colour of the precipitate , however , was reddish-brown , and it was practically insoluble in hydrochloric acid ; its quantity was also too small to permit of further investigation .
Copper was then precipitated by Eivot 's method by addition to the filtrate of ammonium sulphocyanide , after reduction with sulphurous acid .
The filtrate from the cuprous sulphocyanide gave traces of a brown precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen , not in the least resembling cadmium sulphide .

] and the Relative Radio-activity of its Constituents .
387 The solution of the sulphides in sodium sulphide , which should have contained arsenic , antimony , and tin , and other elements capable of forming sulpho-salts , was analysed* according to the methods of Bunsen and Clarke .
A large excess of sulphurous acid was added to the liquid , and it was boiled for a long time .
Arsenic is dissolved , antimony and tin remain behind .
The insoluble residue was then suspended in water ; ammonium persulphate and oxalic acid were added , and sulphuretted hydrogen was once more passed through the solution .
After a repetition of this operation , the solution should have contained only antimony , and the residue , tin .
The antimony sulphide , after excess of sulphur had been removed by carbon disulphide , had an almost black colour , probably due to the presence of selenium , which has been discovered by Professor Ogawa in this laboratory , in course of work on larger quantities of residue .
The solution , which was supposed to contain arsenic , was treated with sulphuretted hydrogen ; to the precipitate , after solution and oxidation , ammonia and magnesia mixture were added , but no arsenate came down .
On passing sulphuretted hydrogen , however , a small quantity of a black substance was precipitated .
To the filtrate from the sulphuretted hydrogen group ammonia was added after oxidation .
The precipitate was redissolved in hydrochloric acid and , after adding a little concentrated nitric acid , a solution of oxalic acid was poured into the solution .
The oxalates of the rare earths separated in a granular state , and were separated by filtration .
This precipitate was then treated , according to Brauner 's method , with a solution of 20 grammes of ammonium oxalate in 40 grammes of water , and boiled for about 10 minutes ; the liquid was then diluted with about 800 c.c. of water .
The thorium remains in solution ; the ceria , etc. , are precipitated .
This process was repeated , and the solution was then evaporated to dryness and ignited ; the thorium oxide was then weighed .
The original solution in hydrochloric acid , however , still contained thorium and cerium ; it was , therefore , partly evaporated and neutralised with ammonia , and oxalic acid was again added ; the precipitate obtained was treated in the same way as has been already described .
No attempt was made to separate ceria from the other earths , though they were present , as is proved by the red-brown colour of the C62O3 .
The ammonia-group further contained iron , aluminium , and uranium , which are not precipitated by oxalic acid .
They were separated by the usual methods ; if the solution contains excess of ammonium carbonate , only iron and aluminium are precipitated by ammonium sulphide , and uranium is left in solution ; after precipitation by evaporation , and re-solution in dilute * 388 E. H. Buchner .
Composition of Thorianite , [ Aug. 23 hydrochloric acid , it was thrown down by ammonium hydroxide and weighed as U308 .
The aluminium and iron were separated by treatment with excess of caustic potash .
The filtrate from the ammonia-group was evaporated to dryness in a platinum basin , and the ammonium salts were expelled ; the residue dissolved almost entirely in hydrochloric acid ( residue co ; see experiments on radioactivity ) .
After neutralisation of the excess of hydrochloric acid , calcium oxalate was precipitated ; the filtrate was again evaporated , and heated to redness .
A residue was left , which was weighed , and submitted to several tests .
Part of it dissolved on boiling with concentrated hydrochloric acid ; the solution was evaporated , diluted with water , and treated with excess of caustic soda ; the resulting precipitate was soluble in hydrochloric acid .
After neutralisation , sodium phosphate gave a white precipitate ( \lt ; \#163 ; ) ; on addition of ammonia to the filtrate , another precipitate came down in very small quantity ( magnesia ) .
The solution , which contained excess of soda , was evaporated and heated ; on dissolving in water , a residue was left , soluble in hydrochloric acid , and precipitable by hydrogen sulphide with a brownish-red colour .
None of these precipitates have been investigated more closely .
The portion of the mineral insoluble in nitric acid was fused with hydrogen potassium sulphate ; the fused mass dissolved almost completely in hot water ; on addition of a little hydrochloric acid , however , a precipitate was formed .
After this had been removed by filtration , a further quantity of a white substance separated .
Sulphuretted hydrogen was passed through the filtrate from this second precipitate , when a red-brown precipitate was thrown down , which was treated in the same manner as described for the soluble part of the mineral .
Mercury was again present in traces , as well as substances which came down in place of bismuth and cadmium ; these were probably identical in nature with those found in the ' other portion .
After the supposed cadmium had been filtered off , the solution was evaporated and heated ; a residue was left ( p ) .
The ammonia-group consisted only of aluminium , iron , and uranium .
To the filtrate from this group ammonium carbonate was added ; no precipitate came down , until after 24 hours , when a white substance separated .
The filtrate left no residue after it had been evaporated and heated .
The precipitate mentioned above , which was obtained by adding hydrochloric acid to the solution of the fused mass , was once more fused with bisulphate , and dissolved in hot water ( solution y ) ; a residue remained , which was partly soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid ( solution a ) , and a white residue was left .
Sulphuretted hydrogen was then passed through 1906 .

389 solution a , and after 24 hours ' standing , a brownish-red precipitate was formed , the filtrate from which was mixed with solution / 3 , obtained in the following way:\#151 ; The solution y had become turbid , and deposited a white precipitate ; this was removed by filtration .
Sulphuretted hydrogen was passed through the filtrate , and gave a precipitate similar in appearance to that formed in solution a ; after filtering and allowing to stand , saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen for 24 hours , another quantity of what was apparently the same substance was obtained .
The mixed solutions a and / 3 were then oxidised , precipitated with ammonium hydroxide , and the precipitate dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid .
No precipitate was produced with ammonium oxalate , but only a slight turbidity , which passed away on addition of a few more drops .
The oxalic acid was removed from this solution by evaporation and ignition , and the oxide was weighed .
Qualitative tests showed that it consisted of oxide of titanium with traces of oxide of zirconium .
A separate quantity of the mineral was heated to redness , in order to determine the loss on ignition .
It proved to be considerable , and chiefly due to the presence of water .
The gas evolved was collected over mercury , and the carbon dioxide absorbed with caustic potash ; the only other gas present was helium .
From 1 gramme of the mineral 8*2 c.c. of helium were obtained at normal temperature and pressure .
The results of the analysis are given in the table ( p. 390 ) , where the measurements of radio-activity of the various precipitates are also given , contrasted with that of the mineral taken as 100 .
For determining the radio-activity of the precipitates , a month was allowed to elapse after they had been obtained ; about 10 milligrammes of the substance , if as much was available , was weighed out and placed in an electroscope .
It was sometimes necessary , however , to place precipitate and filter together in the electroscope .
The time in which the leaf moved over 20 divisions of the scale was noted , and from this the number of divisions per hour was calculated , allowance having been made for one hour 's leakage , had exactly 10 milligrammes been placed on the copper plate .
The figures thus obtained are given in the third column of the table , and in the second column the activity of the total quantity of the precipitate , obtained by multiplying the numbers in the third column by the weight of the substance , is recorded .
The last column shows the percentage activity , that of the original mineral being taken as 100 .
The mineral possesses 83*3 per cent , of the activity of standard uranium oxide , a sample several years old .
It is also to be noticed that the activity is associated almost entirely with the soluble part of the mineral ; while the VOL. LXXVIII.\#151 ; A. 2 D 390 Dr. E. H. Biichner .

ratio of the weights of the soluble to the insoluble portion is 40 to 1 , the ratio of the activities is about 300 to 1 .
Again , comparing the activity of constituents common both to the insoluble and soluble portions , such as iron oxide , and bismuth ( ?
) oxide , the samples from the soluble portion are much more active than those of the insoluble portion .
In the case of iron the ratio is Vl to 1 .
Nearly all the precipitates obtained from the soluble portion proved to be radio-active , although some had only a very slight effect on the electroscope .
A remarkable exception is furnished by the alumina , which , although closely 1906 .
] and the Relative Radio-activity of its .
391 allied to the strongly active iron group , is absolutely inactive .
The active constituent of the iron group is therefore insoluble in excess of caustic potash ; as farther experiments showed , it gives off an emanation , the rate of decay of which , although not accurately determined , appears to point to its being due to that of radiothorium , separated by Hahn* which always comes down with iron .
The activity of several precipitates had not reached a maximum at the last measurement ; those of lead , iron , uranium , cerium , and calcium were still increasing , while the activity of bismuth ( ?
) , thorium and zirconium did not change .
On the other hand , several precipitates showed activity originally , which decreased and even disappeared , e.g. , co , insoluble in hydrochloric acidf ( see p. 388 ) .
When originally obtained , it was placed in the electroscope along with its filter , and showed an activity of 30,000 to 40,000 .
After destroying the filter , and dissolving the precipitate with aqua regia , and evaporating the solution to dryness , the activity had decreased to 250 , and it seemed then to be permanent at that value .
It may be assumed , therefore , that this precipitate is a so-called X-substance ; its chemical behaviour somewhat resembles that of a platinum-metal .
After evaporation , the solution in aqua regia left a yellow crystalline residue , which turned black when gently heated .
This black residue was insoluble in hydrochloric acid , but soluble in aqua regia ; the solution showed again the same properties .
The next most active precipitate was found in the filtrate from the ammonia-group .
Several very active minute traces of substance were collected on filters .
The substance ( f\gt ; , mentioned on p. 388 , obtained by addition of sodium phosphate , weighed only 8 milligrammes , and had a total activity of 3400 , which increased to 3900 after standing for six weeks .
Although this precipitate forms only ( K)2 per cent , of the total weight of the mineral , it possesses 1 per cent , of the total activity .
In connection with this it may be remembered that Rutherford , | during his early experiments on thorium and thorium-X\gt ; also found a strongly active constituent in his thoria , precipitable by sodium phosphate after removal of the thoria .
He was not always able to detect it , however , and ascribed it to the presence of an impurity in commercial thoria .
In conclusion , it is my pleasant duty to express my hearty thanks to Sir William Ramsay for his kind assistance and advice .
