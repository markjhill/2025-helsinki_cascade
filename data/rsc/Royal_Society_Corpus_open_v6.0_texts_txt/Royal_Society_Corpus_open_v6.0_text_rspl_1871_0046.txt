r " Letter from W. De LaRue , F.R.S. , to Prof. Stokes , Sec. R.S. , relative to the Observations taken with the Kew Heliograph .
" The Obseryatory , Cranford , Middlesex , W. , February 5th , 1872 .
My dear Sir , \#151 ; I beg herewith to hand you a statement of the expenditure of the \lt ; \#163 ; 200 I received in February 1871 from the Government-Grant Fund for working the Kew heliograph and measuring and reducing the photographic pictures from February 1st , 1871 , to January 30 , 1872 .
I enclose the vouchers .
The work which I undertook to superintend during the last ten years has been brought to a close , so far as the observations are concerned .
It has , however , been impossible to keep up the measurements of the sun-pictures and their reduction to the day .
Indeed it will take eighteen months to bring these to a close ; I have agreed with Mrs. Whipple ( formerly Miss Beckley ) and Mr. Loewy to complete this work for a specific sum ( aei70 ) .
As the funds placed at my disposal are exhausted , I will defray this expense myself .
It may be of interest to the Government-Grant Committee to know that , during the ten years ( 1862 , February , to the end of January 1871 ) , 2778 pictures have been obtained on 1724 days .
Since the Kew instrument was devised and constructed , I have been able , with the aid of Mr. Dalmeyer , to introduce many improvements , both in the mechanical parts and the optical portion of the instrument ; but I did not think it desirable to interrupt the sun-work to make any changes in the Kew heliograph .
Now that the work is completed , I would recommend that the secondary magnifier should be changed to the form adopted in the instrument made for the Russian Government , under my direction , and now at work at Wilna , by which very much better pictures are obtained than those procured at Kew .
The cost of this change would be about \#163 ; 30 .
