Introductory Remarks .
THE theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance , that it has engaged the attention of all the most enlinent mathematicians , since the invention of dynamics as a mathematical science by GALILEO , and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by NEWTON .
Among the successors of those illustrious men , LAGRANGE has perhaps done more than any other analyst , to give extent and harmony to such deductive researches , by showing that the most varied consequences respecting the motions of systems of bodies may be derived from one radical formula ; the beauty of the method so suiting the dignity of the results , as to make of his great work a kind of scientific poem .
But the science of force , or of power acting by law in space and time , has undergone already another revolution , and has become already more dynanmic , by having almost dismissed the conceptions of solidity and cohesion , and those other material ties , or geometrically imaginable conditions , which LAGRANGE SO happily reasoned on , and by tending more and more to resolve all connexions and actions of bodies into attractions and repulsions of points : and while the science is advancing thus in one direction by the improvement of physical views , it may advance in another direction also by the invention of mathematical methods .
And the method proposed in the present essay , for the deductive study of the motions of attracting or repelling systems , will perhaps be received with indulgence , as an attempt to assist in carrying forward so high an inquiry .
In the methods commonly employed , the determination of the motion of a free point in space , under the influence of accelerating forces , depends on the integration of three equations in ordinary differentials of the second order ; and the deterInination of the motions of a system of free points , attracting or repelling one another , depends on the integration of a system of such equations , in number threefold the number of the attracting or repelling points , unless we previously diminish by unity this latter number , by considering only relative motions .
Thus , in the solar system , when we consider only the mutual attractions of the sun and of the ten known planets , the determination of the motions of the latter about the former is reduced , by the usual methods , to the integration of a system of thirty ordinary differential equations of the second order , between the coordinates and the time ; or , by a transformation of LAGRANGE , to the integration of a system of sixty ordinary differential equations of the first order , between the time and the elliptic elements : by which integrations , the thirty varying coordinates , or the sixty varying elements , are to be found as functions of the time .
In the method of the present essay , this problem is reduced to the search and differentiation of a single function , which satisfies two partial differential equations of the first order and of the second degree : and every other dynamical problem , respecting the motions of any system , however numerous , of attracting or repelling points , ( even if we suppose those points restricted by any conditons of connexion consistent with the law of living force , ) is reduced , in like manner , to the study of one central function , of which the form marks out and characterizes the properties of the moving system , and is to be determined by a pair of partial differential equations of the first order , combined with some siple e considerations .
The difficulty is therefore at least transferred from the integration of many equations of one class to the integration of to of another : an even i iteofnt should be thought that no practical facility is gained , yet an intellectual pleasure may result from the reduction of the roast complex and , probably , of all researches respecting the forces and motions of body , to the study of one characteristic function* , the unfolding of one central relation .
The present essay does not pretend to treat fully of this extensive subject , -a task which may require the labours of many years and many minds ; but only to suggest the thought and propose the path to others .
Although , therefore , the method may be used in the most varied dynamical researches , it is at present only applied to the orbits and perturbations of a system with any laws of attraction or repulsion , and with one predominant mass or centre of predominant energy ; and only so far , even in this one research , as appears sufficient to make the principle itself understood .
It may be mentioned here , that this dynamical principle is only another form of that idea which has already been applied to optics in the Theory of systems of racys and that an intention of applying it to the motions of systems of bodies was announced f at the publication of that theory .
And besides the idea itself , the manner of calculation also , which has been thus exemplified in the sciences of optics and dynamics , seems not confined to those two sciences , but capable of other applications ; and the peculiar combination which it involves , of the principles of variations with those of partial differentials , for the determination and use of an important class of integrals , may constitute , when it shall be matured by the future labours of mathematicians , a separate branch of analysis .

Integration of the Equations of Motion of a System , characteristic Function .
of such Motion , and Law of varying Action .
1 .
The known differential equations of motion of a system of free points , repelling or attracting one another according to any functions of their distances , and not disturbed by any foreign force , may be comprised in the following formula : .
m ( x x +y " y +z " z ) = U ... ... .
( 1 .
) In this formula the sign of summation 2 extends to all the points of the system ; m is , for any one such point , the constant called its mass ; x " , y " , z " , are its component accelerations , or the second differential coefficients of its rectangular coordinates x , y , z , taken with respect to the time ; x , by , 6 z , are any arbitrary infinitesimal displacements which the point can be imagined to receive in the same ' three rectangular directions ; and $U is the infinitesimal variation corresponding , of a function U of the masses and mutual distances of the several points of the system , of whicth the form depends on the laws of their mutual actions , by the equation U= .
m mf ( r ) , ... ... ... ( 2 .
) r being the distance between any two points m , m , , and the function f ( r ) being such that its derivative or differential coefficientf ' ( r ) expresses the law of their repulsion , being negative in the case of attraction .
The function which has been here called U , may be named the force-function of a system : it is of great utility in theoretical mechanics , into which it was introduced by LAGRANGE , and it furnishes the following elegant forms for the differential equations of motion , included in the formula ( 1 .
) : mx U , , 8U , U ) 11 _U n_1 _8U o a ?

( 3 .
) a 8U aU a , U the second members of these equations being the partialn differential coefficients of the second meinbers of these equations being the partial differential coefficients of 249 the first order of the function U. But notwithstanding the elegance and simplicity of this known manne of stating the prin cipal problem of dynamics , the difficulty of solving that problem , or even of expressing its solution , has hitherto appeared insuperable ; so that only seven interlnediate integrals , or integrals of the first order , with as many arbitrary constants , have hitherto been found for these general equations of motion of a system of n points , instead of 3n intermediate and 3n final integrals , involving ultimately 6n constants ; nor has any integral been found which does not need to be integrated again .
No general solution has been obtained assigning ( as a complete solution ought to do ) 3n relations between the n masses m , m2 , ... mn the 3n varying coordinates x1 , yw , z1 , ... xn in , z , , the varying time t , and the 6n initial data of the problem , namely , the initial coordinates a , b1 , cl , ... a b , c , and their initial rates of increase , a , b ' , c ' , ... .a ' , b , c the quantities called here initial being those which correspond to the arbitrary origin of time .
It is , however , possible ( as we shall see ) to express these long-sought relations by the partial differential coefficients of a new central or radical function , to the search and employment of which the difficiulty of mathematical dynamics becomes henceforth reduced .

If we put for abridgement T=-2 .
m(22.+ y ... ... . .
+ ( 4 .
) so that 2T denotes , as in the Mecanique Analytique , the whole living force of the system ; ( x ' , y ' , z ' , being here , according to the analogy of our foregoing notation , the rectangular components of velocity of the point m , or the first differential coefficients of its coordinates taken with respect to the time ; ) an easy and well known combination of the differential equations of motion , obtained by changing in the formula ( 1 .
) the variations to the differentials of the coordinates , may be expressed in the following manner , dT=dU , ... ... ... ... .
( 5 .
) and gives , by integration , the celebrated law of living force , under the form T=U + H ... ... ... ... ( 6 .
) In this expression , which is one of the seven kinown integrals already mentioned , the quantity H is independent of the time , and does not alter in the passage of the points of the system from one set of positions to another .
We have , for example , an initial equation of the same form , corresponding to the origin of time , which may I)e written thus , To=Uo+It ... ... ... ... .
( 7 .
) The quantity LI may , however , receive any arbitrary increment whatever , when we pass in thought from a system moving in one way , to the same system moving in another , with the same dynamical relations between the accelerations and positions of its points , but with different initial data ; but the increment of H , thus obtained , 250 is evidently connected with the analogous increments of the functions T and U , by the relation AT=AU+AIH,. .
( 8 .
) which , for the case of infinitesimal variations , may conveniently be written thus , T-U+ H ... .
; ... . .
( 9 .
) and this last relation , when multiplied by d t , and integrated , conducts to an important result .
For it thus becomes , by ( 4 .
) and ( 1 .
) , f 2 .
m ( d x. x ' -+ die .
y ' +d z. 3 z ' ) = f , .
m ( dx ' .
8 x+ dy ' .

( 10 .
) that is , by the principles of the calculus of variations , V= 2.m(x ' x +y'Sy+ z'8z ) 2 .

( A. ) if we denote by V the integral V =f.m n(x ' dx +y'dy + z 'd z ) =f 2Td , ... ... .
( B. ) namely , the accumulated living force , called often the action of the system , from its initial to its final position .
If , then , we consider ( as it is easy to see that we may ) the action V as a function of the initial and final coordinates , and of the quantity H , we shall have , by ( A. ) , the following groups of equations ; first , the group , 8V , a V,1 x=I , ; ; --= ^mxnnn[ sV a SV ' 8V , r 8= my ; y1 2m2Y2 ; ' 8my 8V , SV , V , Zl= mlzl ; Z:-2 z'n ; *** '=m Z Secondly , the group , -h =Il ; m= .

( C. ) I 0 .
e. ( D. ) ... ... ( E. ) So that if this function V were known , it would only remain to eliminate H between the 3n+1 equations ( C. ) and ( E. ) , in order to obtain all the 3n intermediate integrals , or between ( D. ) and ( E. ) to obtain all the 3n final integrals of the differential equations of motion ; that is , ultimately , to obtain the 3n sought relations between 2.51 the 3n varying coordinates and the time , involving also the masses and the 6n initial data above mentioned ; the discovery of which relations would be ( as we have said ) the general solution of the general problem of dynamics .
We have , therefore , at least reduced that general problemr to the search and differentiation of a single function V , which we shall call on this account the CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION of motion of a system ; and the equation ( A. ) , expressing the fundamental law of its variation , we shall call the equation of the characteristicfunction , or the LAW OF VARYING ACTION .
3 .
To show more clearly that the action or accumulated living force of a system , or in other words , the integral of the product of the living force by the element of the time , may be regarded as a function of the 6n+1 quantities already mentioned , namely , of the initial and final coordinates , and of the quantity H , we may observe , that whatever depends on the manner and time of motion of the system may be considered as such a function ; because the initial form of the law of living force , when combined with the 3n known or unknown relations between the time , the initial data , and the varlying coordinates , will always furnish 3n+1 relations , known or unknown , to connect the time and the initial components of velocities with the initial and final coordinates , and with H. Yet from not having formed the conception of the action as afiinction of this kind , the consequences that have been here deduced from the formula ( A. ) for the variation of that definite integral , appear to have escaped the notice of LAGRANGE , and of the other illustrious analysts who have written on theoretical mechanics ; although they were in possession of a formula for the variation of this integral not greatly differing from ours .
For although LAGRANGE and others , in treating of the motion of a system , have shown that the variation of this definite integral vanishes when the extreme coordinates and the constant II are given , they appear to have deduced from this result only the well known law of least action ; namely , that if the points or bodies of a system be imagined to move from a given set of initial to a given set of final positions , not as they do nor evein as they could move consistently with the general dynamical laws or differential equations of motion , but so as not to violate any supposed geometrical connexions , nor that one dynamincal relation between velocities and configurations which constitutes the law of living force and if , besides , this geometrically imaginable , but dynamically impossible motion , be made to differ infinitely little from the actual manner of motion of the system , between the given extreme positions ; then the varied value of the definite integral called action , or the accumulated living force of the system in the motion thus imagined , will differ infinitely less from the actual value of that integral .
But when this well known law of least , or as it might be better called , of stationary action , is applied to the determination of the actual motion of a system , it serves only to form , by the rules of the calculus of variations , the differential equations of motion of the second order , which can always be otherwise found .
It seems , therefore , to be with reason that LAGRANGE , LAPLACE , and POISSON have spoken lightly of the utility of this principle in the present state of dynamics .
A different estimate , perhaps , will be formed of that 252 other principle which has been introduced in the present paper , under the name of the law of varying action , in which we pass from an actual motion to another motion dynamically possible , by varying the extreme positions of the system , and ( in general ) the quantity H , and which serves to express , by means of a single function , not the mere differential equations of motion , but their intermediate and their final integrals .
Verfications of the foregoing Integrals .
4 .
A verification , which ought not to be neglected , and at the same time an illustration of this new principle , may be obtained by deducing the known differential equations of motion from our system of intermediate integrals , and by showing the consistence of these again with our final integral system .
As preliminary to such verification , it is useful to observe that the final equation ( 6 .

H=l 1..* .
a ( K. ) By combining the equations ( C. ) with their differentials ( H. ) , and with the relation ( F. ) , we deduced , in the foregoing number , the known equations of motion ( 3 .
) ; and we are now to show the consistence of the same intermediate integrals ( C. ) with the group of differentials ( I. ) , which have been deduced from the final integrals .
The first equation of the group ( I. ) may be developed thus : 2VV 2 , W alx+ 2al ax2 Ta+a VaX +YlaaI y +Y2ay+'.+Yn8a ... . .
( 14 .
) a2 V aL 'V , V+ Z'l a+Z aala +6 aaaaz J and the others may be similarly developed .
In order , therefore , to show that they are satisfied by the group ( C. ) , it is sufficient to prove that the following equations are true , a 1( / ayV\2 / aV\2 / aV\2 aa / a\ 2 / av\2 / av\ 2 -8 +(jy 1 ' ( )+ ( 8V)2 } , ... ... .
( L. ) =8 c we took its variation with respect to the final coordinates , and so obtained results which agreed with the known equations of motion , and which may be thus collected , a8 1r / aV2 ayVx2 , aV\2 Ua Xi mux xi , xx , 8I f/ v\2 aV\2 / aV\2 to the expression a1/ aV2 a / aV\2 / W \2 and this , when developed , agrees with the equation ( K. ) , which is a new verification of the consistence of our foregoing results .
Nor would it have been much more difficult , by the help of the foregoing principles , to have integrated directly our integrals of the first order , ; and so to have deduced in a different way our final integral system .
6 .
It may be considered as still another verification of our own general integral equations , to show that they include not only the known law of living force , or the integral expressing that law , but also the six other known integrals of the first order , which contain the law of motion of the centre of gravity , and the law of description of areas .
For this purpose , it is only necessary to observe that it evidently follows from the conception of our characteristic function V , that this function depends on the initial and final positions of the attracting or repelling points of a system , not as referred to any foreign standard , but only as compared with one another ; and therefore that this function will not vary , if without n aking any real change in either initial or final configuration , or in the relation of these to each other , we alter at once motion , whether of translation or of rotation .
Now by considering three coordinate translations , we obtain the three following partial differesntial equations of the first order , which the function V must satisfy , av VI 2^-0 .

J In this manner , therefore , we can dedace from the properties of our characteristic function the six other known integrals above mentioned , in addition to that seventh which contains the law of living force , and which assisted in the discoveiy of our method .
Introduction of relative or polar Coordinates , or other marks of position of ( Systez .

The property of our characteristic function , by which it depends only on the internal or mutual relations between the positions initial and final of the points of an attracting or repelling system , suggests an advantage in employing internal or relative coordinates ; and from the analogy of other applications of algebrlaical inethods to researches of a geometrical kind , it may be expected that polar and other marks of position will also often be found useful .

s , which mark the varying positions of the n moving points of the system , are now to be obtained by eliminating the auxiliary constant HI between the 3n -+1 equations ( S. ) and ( E. ) ; while the 3n intermediate integrals , or integrals of the first order , which connect the same varying marks of position and their first differential coefficients with the time , the masses , and the initial marks of position , are the result of elimination of the same auxiliary constant H between the equations ( R. ) and ( E. ) .
Our fundamental formula , and intermediate and final integrals , can therefore be very simply expressed with any new sets of coordinates ; and the partial differential equations ( F. ) ( G. ) , which our characteristic function V must satisfy , and which are , as we have said , essential in the theory of that function , can also easily be expressed with any such transformed coordinates , by merely combining the final and initial expressions of the law of living force , T= U+ H , ... ...

Nor is there any difficulty in deducing analogous transformations for the known differential equations of motion of the second order , of any system of free points , by taking the variation of the new form ( T. ) of the law of living force , and by attending to the dynamical meanings of the coefficients of our characteristic function .
For if we observe that the final living force 2 T , when considered as a function of ; 7 * 2 .

( W. ) integrals ( S. ) , ( X. ) i'om the properties of our characteristic function .
And if we were to suppose ( as it has often been thought convenient and even necessary to do , ) that the n points of a system are not entirely free , nor subject only to their own mutual attractions or repulsions , but connected by any geometrical conditions , and influenced by any foreign agencies , consistent with the law of conservation of living force so that the number of independent marks of position should be now less numerous , and the forcefunction U less simple than before ; it might still be proved , by a reasoning very similar to the foregoing , that on these suppositions also ( which , however , the dynamical spirit is tending more and more to exclude , ) the accumulated living force or action V of the system is a characteristic motion-function of the kind already explained having the same law and formula of variation , which are susceptible of the same transformations ; obliged to satisfy in the same way a final and an initial relation between its partial differential coefficients of the first order ; conducting , by the variation of one of these two relations , to the same canonical forms assigned by LAGRANGE for the differential equations of motion ; and furnishing , on the same principles as before , their intermediate and their final integrals .
To those imaginable cases , indeed , in which the law of living force no longer holds , our method also would not apply ; but it appears to be the growing ' conviction of the perisons who have meditated the most profoundly on the mathematical dynamics of the universe , that these are cases suggested by insufficient views of the mutual actions of body .
9 .
It results from the foregoing remarks , that in order to apply our method of the characteristic function to any problem of dynamics respecting any moving system , the known law of living force is to be combined with our law of varying action ; and that the general expression of this latter law is to be obtained in the following manner .
We are first to express the quantity T , namely , the half of the living force of the system , aa function ( which will always be homogeneous of the second dimension , ) of the differential coefficient tesr rates of increase '1a , t &amp;c. , of any rectangular coordinates , or other marks of position of the system : we are next to take the variation the variations of those rates , g2 , &amp;c. , to the variations ; 1 , ' 2 , &amp;c. , of the marks of position themselves ; and then to subtract the initial from the final value of the result , and to equate the remnainider to V -t H. A slight consideration will show that this general rule or process for obtaining the variation of the characteristic function V , is applicable even when the marks of position 1 , 2 , &amp;c. , are not all independent of each other ; which will happen when they have been made , from any motive of convenience , more numerous than the rectangular coordinates of the several points of the system .
For if we suppose that the 3n rectangular coordinates X y1 zl ... x Y , n z , have been expressed by any transformation as functions of 3n+k other marks of position , , .

As an example of the foregoing transformations , and at the same time as an important application , we shall now introduce relative coordinates , x , y , z , , r eferred to an internal origin x , y , , z , ; that is , we shall put X. = x.i + x , Yi = Yi Y+= + ... ( 40 .

) and T , ,= ( ' , ,2 + y/ + ' , , m ... ... ... ... ... ( 49 .
) By this known decomposition , the whole living force 2 3T of the system is resolved into the two parts 2 T , and 2 T , , of which the former , 2 T , , may be called the relative living force , being that which results solely from the relative velocities of the points of the system , in their motions about their common centre of gravity x , , y , , , , ; while the latter part , 2 T , , , results only from the absolute motion of that centre of gravity in space , and is the same as if all the masses of the system were united in that common centre .
At the same time , the law of living force , T=U+ H , ( 6 .

( 50 .

( 51 .

As an example of the determination of these multipliers , we may suppose that the part V , , of the whole action V , has been expressed , before differentiation , as a function of H , , and of these other 6n -6 independent quantities xI x , 2l , SJA -1 n I1 ' z21Z , n = , ~I : Yz2 Z , -2 , ** % -Zm =** *# , * , " -i n^ Xs--1 1 ^-1 , =n = L-,1 and ^i~ a= , a a , -2 oq , a.i , - , a , - , il b , b , = , b,2 b , , = , * * , _ , B- , = , .

When V , has been thus expressed as a function of the centrobaric coordinates , involving their differences only , it will evidently satisfy the six partial differential equations , a sV , a V , '-O ( p ' =0 =o , = o , 6 aa ab a6 - ?

We find , therefore , for the relative motion of a system about its own centre of gravity , equations of the same form as those which we had obtained before for the absolute motion of the same system of points in space .
And we see that in investigating such relative motion only , it is useful to confine ourselves to the part V , of our whole characteristic function , that is , to the relative action of the system , or accumulated living force of the motion about the centre of gravity ; and to consider this part as the characteristic function of such relative motion , in a sense analogous to that which has been already explained .
This relative action , or part V , , may , however , be otherwise expressed , and even in an infinite variety of ways , on account of the six equations of condition which connect the 6n centrobaric coordinates ; and every different preparation of its form will give a different set of values for the six multipliers xl x2 ?
3 A1 A2 A3 .
For example , we inight eliminate , by a previous preparation , the six centrobaric coordinates of the point m. from the expression of VI , so as to make this expression involve only the centrobaric coordinates of the other n1 points of the system , and then we should have av_ O , _ Oo V-o , V ...

For this purpose we shall employ a known transformation of the relative living force 2 T , , multiplied by the sum of the masses of the system , namely the following : 2T , 2= m. m { ( .
-m m)f( k2+ ( '-i ( k)2 + ( i-k)2 } ... ( 67 .
) the sign of summation E extending , in the second member , to all the combinations of points two by two , which can be formed without repetition .

' ' And to obtain , with any set of internal or relative marks of position , the two partial differential equations which the characteristic function V , of relative motion must satisfy , and which offer ( as we shall find ) the chief means of discovering its form , namely , the equations analogous to those marked ( F. ) and ( G. ) , we have only to eliminate the rates of increase of the marks of position of the system , which determine the final and initial components of the relative velocities of its points , by the law of varying relative action , from the final and initial expressions of the law of relative living force ; namely , from the following equations : T , =U +H- , ... ... ... ... ... ... ( 50 .

( 70 .
) The law of areas , or the property respecting rotation which was expressed by the partial differential equations ( P. ) , will also always admit of being expressed in relative coordinates , and will assist in discovering the form of the characteristic function V , ; by showing that this function involves only such internal coordinates ( in number 6n 9 ) as do not alter by any common rotation of all points final and initial , round the centre of gravity , or round any other internal origin ; that origin being treated as fixed , and the quantity H , as constant , in determining the effects of this rotation .
The general problem of dynamics , respecting the motions of a free system of n points attracting or repelling one another , is therefore reduced , in the last analysis , by the method of the present essay , to the research and differentiation of a function V , depending on 6n9 internal or relative coordinates , and on the quantity II , , and satisfying a pair of partial differential equations of the first order and second degree ; in integrating which equations , we are to observe , that at the assumed origin of the motion , namely at the moment when t= 0 , the final or variable coordinates are equal to their initial values , and the partial differential coefficient ~-H vanishes ; and , that at a moment infinitely little distant , the differential alterations of the coordinates have ratios connected with the other partial differential coefficients of the characteristic function V , , by the law of varying relative action .
It may be here observed , that , 272 although the consideration of the point , called usually the centre of gravity , is very simply suggested by the process of the tenth number , yet this internal centre is even more simply indicated by our early corollaries from the law of varying action ; which show that the components of relative final velocities , in any system of attracting or repelling points , may be expressed by the differences of quantities of the form Im a , I av~ V -- : and therefore that in calculating these relative velocities , it is advanm y'rm Iz nz tageons to introduce the final sums nm x , 2 my , 2m z , and , for an analogous reason , the initial sums 2m a , Im b , 2m c , among the marks of the extreme positions of the system , in the expression of the characteristic function V ; because , in differentiating that expression for the calculation of relative velocities , those sums may be treated as constant .
On Systems of two Points , in general ; Characteristic Fiunction of the motion of anm , Binary System .
13 .
To illustrate the foregoing principles , which extend to any free system of points , however numerous , attracting or repelling one another , let us now consider , in particular , a system of two such points .
For such a system , the known force-function U becomes , by ( 2 .
) , U=m 2f ( r ) , ... ... ... . .
( 71 .
) r being the mutual distance r= S(x ( -Xi )2 + ( 1-y 2)2 +(zl -z ) , .
( 72 .
) between the two points mi , m2 , and f ( r ) being a function of this distance such that its derivative or differential coefficient.f ( r ) expresses the law of their repulsion or attraction , according as it is positive or negative .
The known differential equations of motion , of the second order , are now , by ( 1 .
) , comprised in the following formula : m1 ( W'l B X1 +y"l $Y1 + z"1 1 ) ++ M2 ( '2 2 +yY"2 tY2 + " 2 w 22 ) = ml 2 ( r ) ; .
( 73 .

X. , ^2 I2= " 21 8a 2 a1 * The problem of integrating these equations consists in proposing to assign , by their means , six relations between the time t , the masses mn m2 , the six varying coordinates x1Y1 zI X Y2 z2 , and their initial values and initial rates of increase a , bl cb a2 b2 c2 a'1 b'l c'l a'2 b'2 .
If we knew these six final integrals , and combined them with the initial form of the law of living force , or of the known intermediate integral ( 75 .
) 273 m ( x , I2 + y212 + Z)12 ) +i m2 ( Z22 +:22 + z'22 ) = mnl f ( r ) + ; 1 .
that is , with the following formula , Mz1 ( a'12 + b'12 + C12 ) + } m2 ( a'22 + b22 + d22 ) = _1 m2f(r0 ) + H , .
( 76 .
) in which ro is the initial distance ro = V/ ( ai -a2)2 + ( b b2 ) +2 ( c.-'c2)2 , ... . .
( 77 .
) and H is a constant quantity , introduced by integration ; we could , by the combination of these seven relations , determine the time t , and the six initial components of velocity a'1 b'l c , a'2 bV c ' , as functions of the twelve final and initial coordinates 't Yl z1 x2 Y2 z2 al b cl a2 b2 c2 , and of the quantity H , ( involving also the masses : ) we could therefore determine whatever else depends on the manner and time of motion of this system of two points , as a function of the same extreme coordinates and of the same quantity H. In particular , we could determine the action , or accumulated living force of the system , namely , V= m , / '+'+ '1 ) t+ 2o ' ( 22 +Y+y2)d t , .
( A2 .
) as a function of those thirteen quantities 1yz2 y2 X2 a , b , cl a2 b2 C2 H : and might then calculate the variation of this function , V= av 1 , l + av , 1 Y+ aZ+ y , ZV2 + ?

But the essence of our method consists in forming previously the expression of this variation , by our law of varying action , namely , 6V= m1 ( x,1 x1 a ' a1 + y ' , Syl bl b+ zl zl c'l )1+ m2 ( x2 222 a2 +2 Y2 b'2 + y'22 2 c'2 2 c2 ) } .

( E. ) By this new method , the difficulty of integrating the six known equations of motion of the second order ( 74 .
) , is reduced to the search and differentiation of a single function V ; and to find the form of this function , we are to employ the following pair of partial differential equations of the first order : 1 / sv 2 / sv\2 / yV 21 rtV\2 sv2 v 2l i vxJ+ ( \)y 2+( ' } + V2 +,2 + j2 } = m1m2f ( r ) +H , ... ... ... ... ... ..(F2 .

The form ( 1H12 .
) , for the characteristic function of a binary system , may be regarded as a central or radical relation , which includes the whole theory of the motion of such a system ; so that all the details of this motion may be deduced from it by the application of our general method .
But because the theory of binary systems has been brought to great perfection already , by the labours of former writers , it may suffice to give briefly here a few instances of such deduction .

The form ( H2 .

The equation of condition ( I2 ) , connecting these two con2 o2 279 stants h , H , , with the extreme lengths of the radius vector r , and with the angle a described by this radius in revolving from its initial to its final direction , is the equation of the plane relative orbit ; and the other equation of condition ( T2 .

It results from the foregoing remarks , that this quantity p is constant also in the sense of being independent of the time , so as not to vary in the course of the motion ; and that the condition ( B3 .

The expression ( F3 .

( G3 .
) if we put , for abridgement , to 4t+ UJ = V0ne , =e cos 2 ; * ( 108 .
) for the complete determination of the characterstic function of the e present relative motion , it remains therefore to determine the two variables v , and e , , as functions of r r0 S , or of some other set of quantities which mark the shape and sie of the plane triangle bounded by the final and initial elliptic radii vectores and by the elliptic chord .
For this purpose it is convenient to introduce this elliptic chord itself , which we shall call + r. , so that = r2 + r22rr0cos ; ... ... ( 109 .
) because this chord may be expressed as a function of the two variables v , , e , , ( involving also the mean distance a , ) as follows .

Besides if we denote by a the sum of the two elliptic radii vectores , final and initial , so that = r+ ro , ... ... ... ... ( 113 .

( 114 .

By this comparison we are brought back to the general integral equations of the relative motion of a binary system , ( 89 .

We shall not enter , on this occasion , into any details of such application ; but we may remark , that the circumstance of the characteristic function involving only the elliptic chord and the sum of the extreme radii , ( besides the mean distance and the sum of the masses , ) affords , by our general method , a new proof of the wellknown theorem that the elliptic time also depends on the same chord and sum of radii ; and gives a new expression for the law of this dependence , namely , t =a they subtend also equal angles at the other .
Reciprocally , if any plane curve posess this property , when referred to a fixed point in its own plane , which may be taken as the origin of polar coordinates r , , the curve must satisfy the following equation in mixed differences : / 49\I di cotan )A -(A + 2 ) ... ... ... ( 115 .

The properties of parabolic are included as limiting cases in those of elliptic motion , and may be deduced from them by making H , O , or a = ; , ... ... . .
( 1 ) and therefore the characteristic function w and the time t , in parabolic as well as in elliptic motion , are functions of the chord and of the sum of the radii .

If then we knew the nine final integrals of the equations of motion of this ternary system , and combined them with the initial form ( 125 .

The shape and size of this pentagon may be determined by the ten mutual distances of its five points , that is , by the five sides and five diagonals , which may be thus denoted : m3 ( ml ) = / Vs7 ( ml ) ( m2 ) ) =2 ( 8= , / 3 , mm2l = / ,4 , ml m3.= / s ) m13 ( m2 ) = ^/ d , ( mt1 ) m2 = / d2 , ( m2 ) mi = , / d , m2 m3 = / m4 , ( m , )=/ d5 ; J the values of s ... d5 as functions of the twelve relative coordinates being they may therefore be expressed as functions of nine independent quantities ; for example , of four lines and five angles , r(1 ) r0(1 ) r(2 ) ro(2 ) , ( 1 ) 00(l ) ( 2 , ) 0 o(2 ) 6 , on which they depend as follows : ( 1 ) 2 $1 ~ ( ) 2= ro(1 ) 2+ r(2 ) 2_2 ro(1 ) rO(2 ) ( cos 0(1 ) cos 0o(2 ) + sin 0o(1 ) sin 00(2 ) cos ) , s3 = r(2 ) + r(2 ) 2_ 2 ) ro(2 ) CO ( 0(2 ) _ 00(2 ) ) .

We may therefore consider the characteristic function V , of relative motion , for any ternary system , as depending only on these latter lines and angles , along with the quantity H , .
The reasoning which it has been thought useful to develope here , for any system of three points , attracting or repelling one another according to any functions of their distances , was alluded to , under a more general form , in the twelfth number of this essay ; and shows , for example , that the characteristic function of relative motion in a system of four such points , depends on the shape and size of a heptagon , and therefore only on the mutual distances of its seven corners , which are in number 7x6 = ) 21 , but are connected by six equations of condition , leaving only fifteen independent .
It is easy to extend these remarks to any multiple system .

The sum of these n1 parts is not , in general , equal to the whole relative living force 2 T , of the system , with all the n masses retained ; but it differs little from that whole when the first ni masses are small in comparison with the last mass Mn ; for the rigorous value of this difference is , by ( 68 .

The three equations ( K6 .
) when the auxiliary constant g(i ) is eliminated by the formula ( L6 .
) , are rigorously ( by our theory ) the three final integrals of the three known equations of the second order ( M6 .

ry and of the time t. In like manner the three equations ( I6 .
) , when g(i ) is eliminated by ( L6 .
) , are rigorously the three intermediate integrals of the same known differential equations of motion of the same binary system .
These integrals , however , cease to be rigorous when we introduce the perturbations of the relative motion of this partial or binary system ( m mn ) , arising from the attractions or repulsions of the other points mk , of the whole proposed multiple system ; but they may be corrected and rendered rigorous by employing the remaining part V,2 of the whole characteristic function of relative motion V , , along with the principal part or approximate value V , .

) ( X6 .

) ( K6 .
) .
In likle manner , the formula ( L6 .
) for the time of motion in a binary system , which is only an approximation when the system is considered as multple , may be rigorously corrected for perturbation by adding to it an analogous term deduced from the disturbing part V,2 of the whole characteristic ftnction ; that is , by changing it to the following : t ( i ) + * , *. .

) ( B7 .
) and consequently that these relations will still be rigorously true when we substitute for the four coefficients of w(i ) their rigorous values ( X. ) and ( Z6 .
) for the case of a multiple system .
We may thus retain in rigour for any multiple system the final integrals ( A7 .
) of the motion of a binary system , if only we add to the initial components ?
( 3 ' , r ' of relative velocity , and to the time t the following perturbational terms : A p~ mMk a w ?

In the same way , if the theory of binary systems , or the elimination of g( ' ) between the four equations ( 16 .
) ( L6 .

) -(Z6 .
) .
The three intermediate integrals ( E7 .
) of the motion of a binary system may therefore be adapted rigorously to the case of a multiple system , by first adding to the time t the perturbational term ( D7 .
) , and afterwards adding to the resulting values of the final components of relative velocity the terms Mk a w(lC ) 1 , a V1 a___ I ' mk+mn 4c mi i m , 18 mk awe ( k ) 1i V12 +a2 Vl2 Ai J'mk + mnn 8km 8i ain 8i I ( G7 .

To derive now , from these rigorous results , some useful approximate expressions , we shall neglect , in the peirturbations , the terms which are of the second orlder , with respect to the small masses of the system , and with respect to the constant 2 H , of relative living force , which is easily seen to be small of the same order as the masses : and then the perturbations of the coordinates , deduced by the method that has been explained , become A z= Aa ( .

) , and by the theory of binary systems , as a function of the initial and final relative coordinates , and initial components of relative velocities , involving also expressly the time t , and the 304..O n 2 auxiliary quantities of the form g(k ) ; and then we are to consider those initial components and auxiliary quantities and the time , as depending themselves on the initial and final coordinates , and on H , .
But it is not difficult to prove , by the foregoing principles , that when t and g(k ) are thus considered , their variations are , in the present order of approximation , ; j. in s\-g/ g+ 8 H , gt= - .

( R7 .

It results from the same principles , that in taking the first differentials of these perturbatons ( R7 .
) , the integrals may be treated as constant ; and therefore that we may either represent the change of place of the disturbed point mi , in its relative orbit about m , , by altering a little the initial components of velocity without altering the initial position , and then employing the rules of binary systems ; or calculate at once the perturbations of place and of velocity , by employing the same rules , and altering at once the initial position and initial velocity .

306 General introduction of the Time , into the expression of the Characteristic Function in any dynamical problem .
23 .
Before we conclude this sketch of our general method in dynamics , it will be proper to notice briefly a transformation of the characteristic function , which may be used in all applications .
This transformation consists in putting , generally , V=t H+ S , ... ... ... ... ... ... .
( U7 .
) and considering the part S , namely , the definite integral S =t ( T +U ) dt , ... ... ... ... ... ..(V7 .
) as a function of the initial and final coordinates and of the time , of which the variation is , by our law of varying action , S= dt+ 1.m'(x'x-aa + y ' yb'b + z ' z c ' ; c). .

) , are forms for the final integrals of motion of any system , corresponding to the result of elimination of H between the equations ( D. ) and ( E. ) ; and the expressions ( Y7 .
) are forms for the intermediate integrals , more convenient in many respects than the forms already employed .
24 .
The limits of the present essay do not permit us here to develope the consequences of these new expressions .
We can only observe , that the auxiliary function S must satisfy the two following equations , in partial differentials of the first order , analogous to , and deduced from , the equations ( F. ) and ( G. ) : as Ca i s\ 2/ s\2 / s\ , -1.4 ++U ( A8s.+( ...
