But by the method heie adopted , the same plates which are taken for ascertaining the co-ordinates of the stars , serve equally well for measuring their photographic magnitudes .
It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that practically the photometric and photographic magnitudes are , for the most part , identical .
The remark above will fail of application , if it be possible to determine differences of right ascension and of declination from the traces of the stars with sufficient accuracy .

Received April 17 , 1888 . .
In a preliminary note on this subject ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , 'vol .
42 , p. 212 ) , it has been shown that when copper is immersed in an aqueous solution of ammonia and opposed to an " aeration plate " of some conducting material not otherwise acted upon , lying horizontally on the surface of the fluid , a current flows continuously through a wire , \amp ; c. , made to connect the two plates , the energy manifested by which is due to the absorption of atmo'spheric oxygen by the aeration plate and the indirect combination of this with the copper forming cuprous oxide which dissolves in the ammonia .
Numerous analogous electromotor cells are readily obtainable by suitably varying the metal susceptible of oxidation and the electrolytic fluid employed , some of which we have submitted to close examination ; whilst another class of voltaic cells , acting on much the same principle , we find can be obtained by substituting for the oxidisable metal a platinum or other incorrodible plate immersed in an oxidisable fluid , such as pyrogallol dissolved in caustic soda : preferably the aeration plate is arranged in one vessel on the surface of some convenient fluid ( not necessarily identical with the oxidisable one ) , and the other plate and oxidisable fluid placed in another vessel , the two being connected by a siphon or wet wick ; or the whole may be arranged as a gravity battery , the oxidisable fluid being made the heavier one so as to preserve it from direct contact with air ; of a ( J -tube arrangement may be employed .
Thus , for example , a. platinum plate immersed in an acid solution of ferrous sulphate , or in sulphurous acid solution , connected with a vessel-containing dilute sulphuric acid , and an aeration plate of spongy platinum , \amp ; c. , furnishes an electromotor cell in which the production of a current is accompanied by the virtual transference of oxygen from the aeration plato to the oxidisable .fluid , forming 1888 .

183 ferric sulphate or sulphuric acid respectively .
A considerable enhancement in the E.M.F. of such an arrangement is effected if the oxidisable fluid is rendered alkaline , and the aeration plate surrounded by acid fluid , as in that case the passage of a current is also accompanied by the mutual neutralisation of the acid and alkali to an extent equivalent to the current flowing ( apart from diffusion ) : the heat of neutralisation of caustic soda and sulphuric acid is ( .Tulius Thomsen ) 31,378 gram-degrees , equivalent to 0*675 volt ; and similarly in other cases .
Thus , tolerably energetic aeration cells are obtained by using caustic soda solution of pyrogallol or sodium hyposulphite ( Schiitzenberger 's hydros ) , and a platinum sponge aeration plate on the surface of diluted sulphuric acid ; and somewhat weaker ones if an alkaline solution of ferro-cyanide or sodium plumbate be used , ferri-cyanide or lead dioxide ( precipitated in the solid form on the electrode ) being the product of the oxidation thus effected , and the E.M.F. being upwards of 0'8 volt in each case .
In all aeration cells , whether oxidisable fluids or metals be employed , one marked feature is the extremely rapid rate at which the E.M.F. of the cell falls if the current generated is made to exceed a very small limiting density relatively to the area of the aeration plate .
Of course when this plate is a sheet of polished metal such as platinum foil , this limit lies much lower than when it is a tray of the same area filled with spongy metal , pulverised graphite , \amp ; c. , because in the latter case the true surface acting is much greater than the actual area of the tray : a number of observations led us to the conclusion that with the most sensitive kinds of aeration plates examined ( thin foils or leaves of the precious metals ) , a measurable depreciation in the E.M.F. of a cell that otherwise would give a constant value , was speedily brought about if made to generate a current of greater density relatively to the aeration plate than about -g-'-g- micro-ampere per square centimetre of surface , or 1 micro-ampere for a plate 5 centimetres square , exposing 25 square centimetres of surface ( one side only reckoned ) ; but with aeration plates of spongy metal currents of many times this density produced little or no depreciation even after flowing some time .
Even with the most favourable kinds of plates , however , the tendency towards depreciation was so far marked as to render it evident that but little hope could be entertained of .utilising the principle of atmospheric oxidation for the production of cheap currents of sufficient power for practical use , excepting when plates of enormous area are employed , so that the density of the current should still be small , even when the current itself was of moderate magnitude .
Admitting , however , that a large superficial area ( e.g. , a lake or artificial reservoir ) of fluid were available , and that the cost of a proportionately large system of aeration plates were not prohibitive , it does not seem absolutely impossible 184 Dr. C. R. A. Wright and Mr. C. Thompson .
[ May 3 , that the production of currents by atmospheric oxidation might he practically effected on the large scale .
We found it difficult to obtain sharp and concordant valuations of the E.M.F. actually set up in cells containing oxidisable fluids , the more so , as the numbers appeared to vary , not only with the nature of the aeration plate and the fluid in contact therewith , but also with the character of the incorrodible plate immersed in the oxidisable fluid , and with the nature and strength of that fluid also .
With cells containing oxidisable metals , however , and electrolytic fluids in which the oxides formed were soluble , we found no difficulty in obtaining far more concordant and approximately constant values than would at first sight have appeared likely , or even possible with combinations in which one ingredient was so unstable an element as a film of gaseous matter attracted to the surface of a condensing solid , and simultaneously in contact with a fluid capable of dissolving the gas .
Obviously , mechanical disturbances , rapid alterations of temperature , and such like causes would be likely to cause large variations from time to time in the readings of any one particular cell ; whilst unavoidable differences in the conditions of surface of otherwise duplicate plates ( such as variations in degree of polish , \amp ; c. ) would render it likely that the average readings of any two duplicate cells would occasionally exhibit considerable divergence ; we succeeded , however , in reducing these sources of fluctuations to comparatively small limits , by setting up the cells in an apartment where the temperature varied but little , and only slowly , the readings being mostly taken in the mornings after standing at rest all night ; whilst alteration of the fluid by evaporation , attraction of moisture , carbonic acid , \amp ; c. , from the air , falling in of dust , and so on , was avoided as much as possible by covering over the vessel containing the aeration plate with a bell-jar 1888 .
] Development of Electricity by Atmospheric Oxidation .
185 A , the siphon connecting this vessel with the other one in which the oxidisable metal was immersed being bent so as to pass under the rim of the jar a , a , a. It was found convenient to mount the jar on a block of paraffin wax with a circular groove b , b , in which the bell-jar stood , the groove being then filled with mercury so as to make a sort of hydraulic lute ; if required , the air inside the jar could be replaced by oxygen , \amp ; c. , by simply passing in a current of gas through one of a pair of tubes c , c , introduced through a perforated cork in the neck of the jar .
Usually several aeration plates were separately arranged in the same vessel , each one , B , being connected ( by means of a platinum wire d , d , d , imbedded in the paraffin wax , passing under the rim of the jar ) , with a mercury cup e outside : in this way the plate of oxidisable metal used , / , could be removed at pleasure for cleaning , amalgamating , \amp ; c. , and replaced without disturbing the aeration plates , and could be opposed at will to any one of these by a simple switch connecting the required mercury cup with the rest of the circuit .
On first setting up such an arrangement and taking readings alternately with auy one of the plates opposed to the oxidisable metal , and a Clark 's cell , the total resistance in circuit being the same ( usually several megohms to reduce the current density sufficiently ) values were obtained generally exhibiting progressive alteration ( sometimes increase , sometimes decrease ) as time elapsed ; but after periods varying in different cases from an hour or two to several days , sensibly steady readings were obtained exhibiting little or no variation for days and even weeks together ; what variations were observed were generally traceable either to temperature fluctuations or to slight shaking or mechanical disturbance whilst renewing the opposed oxidisable plate , or to slight differences in the latter .
If , however , in cells set up with dilute sulphuric acid air had free access , more or less considerable alteration was often brought about after some time through evaporation or attraction of moisture from the air , altering the film of fluid in contact with the aeration plate ; and this was still more the case with cells set up with caustic soda solution through absorption of carbonic acid , and with ammonia cells through volatilisation of ammonia .
The result of a large number of observations with cells of various kinds was to show that the following general proposition holds :\#151 ; If a cell set up with a given fluid , oxidisable metal , and aeration plate generate an E.M.F. = el5 then the effect of substituting another aeration plate for the first is to alter the E.M.F. to e2 = ; whilst that of substituting a different oxidisable metal is to alter the E.M.F. to e3 = + K3 ; the quantity Kx being independent of the nature of the oxidisable metal used , but varying with each kind of aeration plate employed , and also to some extent with Dr. C. R. A. Wright and Mr. C. Thompson .
[ May 3 , the nature of the fluid ; and similarly the quantity K2 being independent of the nature of the aeration plate used , but varying with each kind of oxidisable metal employed , and to some extent also with the nature of the fluid .
For example , in one experiment four aeration plates , respectively platinum sponge , gold sponge , silver sponge , and graphite , were successively opposed , first to amalgamated zinc , and then to brightened lead in a caustic soda solution of strength 3-45Na20,100H20 , giving the following average values after making a long series of readings ( Clark 's cell = 1-435 at 15 ' C. ) Zinc .

Numerous other experiments of the same kind were made with analogous results in all cases ; the values for and K2 respectively found in any given set of observations never differing by quantities outside the limits of experimental error .
The average values of Kj or -^-2 thus deduced for a given fluid , however , always differed measurably from those similarly deduced for a different fluid , even when that was a similar solution but of different strength .
The tables hereafter described illustrate these differences more fully .

When steadiness was once obtained , we found that the fluctuations observed from day to day in a given cell set up with amalgamated zinc as oxidisable metal ( freshly amalgamated each day ) rarely exceeded + 0'003 to O'004 volt difference from the mean of several days ( sometimes some weeks ) readings .
Duplicate cells , however , gave average readings exhibiting greater differences up to + 0*025 or -j- 0*030 volt : thus eighteen different cells set up with platinum-foil or thin leaf , caustic soda solution of strength 3*45Na20,100H20 , and amalgamated zinc gave the following results:\#151 ; Maximum mean reading of any given cell .

On substituting a stronger solution of caustic soda for a weaker one , as a rule an increment in average value was observed , and vice versa ; but the extent of the alteration varied considerably with different kinds of aeration plates : with solutions of strength 0*05Na20,100H20 the readings fluctuated so irregularly as to prevent any approach to an accurate average valuation ; but with stronger solutions the readings were sufficiently concordant to reduce the probable error of the final average to only + a few millivolts .

[ May 3 , The spongy metals used were prepared as follows:\#151 ; Silver sponge ( from acetate ) by gently igniting in the air crystallised silver acetate ; that from chloride by boiling well-washed silver chloride with sugar and caustic soda until reduction was nearly complete .
Spongy palladium and platinum by gentle ignition of the ammonio-chlorides of palladium and platinum respectively ; and spongy gold by gentle ignition in the air for a longtime ( so as to burn off carbon ) of cinchonine auro-chloride .
The graphite was a very pure natural specimen from Ceylon ; when used it was coarsely powdered , and spread over the surface of porous earthenware like the spongy metals .
As regards the leaves and foils of silver , gold , and platinum , no discernible differences could be distinguished between the values given by the thinnest leaves and comparatively thick foils ( up to OT mm. in thickness ) in any of the three cases , saving that the latter took a much longer time before steady readings were obtained .
Carbon ( A ) was a piece of electric light rod ground down to a thin flat plate ; ( B ) part of the carbon for a Leclanche cell similarly treated .
It may be noticed that some aeration plates composed of spongy platinum with a top layer of platinum-black ( precipitated from the chloride by boiling with caustic soda and alcohol ) gave figures pretty close to those furnished by platinum sponge ; as also did other plates consisting of porous earthenware painted over with platinochloride of ammonium made into a paste with gum-water , ignited , and the film of spongy platinum left on the surface burnished bright .

A large number of observations were made with sets of aeration plates and oxidisable metals in contact with caustic soda solution of one strength subsequently changed for a different one , and so on , only those readings being taken into account when steadiness was attained ; thus the following figures were obtained where the plates were read first in-75Na30,100H30 , then in 3-45Na3,100H30 , then in 7-15Na30 , 100H2O , and then in the first again , and so on several times , so that each plate was read several times in each strength of fluid .

It was found that when a given aeration plate had attained to a condition of steadiness , if opposed to a piece of freshly brightened pure lead , somewhat irregular readings were obtained for a few minutes owing to the effect of the alkali on the polish of the lead ; in a short time , however , this disturbing influence mostly subsided , and tolerably constant values were obtained for two or three hours , after which a slight lowering generally began to be noticed con190 Dl\ C.

In the case of the cadmium cells , the E.M.F. rises with the solution-strength as it does in the copper cells , and more rapidly because K2 is positive and also rises ; but in the case of the zinc cells , the E.M.F. falls as the solution-strength rises , because K2 is here much smaller with the stronger solution .
Gells Set up with Ammoniacal Solutions as Electrolytic , and Electro-copper as Oxidisable Metal .
It was found impossible to keep any one cell of this kind under anything like constant conditions as regards the nature of the fluid on account of the loss of ammonia , experienced to a large extent even when covered with a jar , \amp ; c. ; accordingly , the following values can only be regarded as approximate , especially in the case of the stronger solutions .
The strength of the fluid was ascertained by sampling and analysis from time to time , and consequently interpolation was sometimes requisite in order to reduce the values obtained with different sets of plates to the same mean strength .
On the whole , however , the figures indicate that with solutions of pure ammonia , the E.M.F. rises with the strength of the solution ; and similarly with liquids containing sal-ammoniac as well .

The various tables above stated clearly show that the order of magnitude of the E.M.F. generated when a given kind of aeration plate is opposed to a given oxidisable metal , depends on the nature , and to some extent also on the strength , of the solution used as electrolytic fluid .
The following table indicates the relative order in which various plates come in solutions of caustic soda , sulphuric acid , and ammoniacal liquors respectively:\#151 ; Caustic Soda .

Comparison between the E.M.F. generated in Aeration Plate Cells and the Chemical Action going on therein .
In the case of cells with caustic soda as electrolytic fluid , the nett chemical change is the oxidation of the oxidisable metal to form 1888 .

195 oxide ( or hydroxide ) which in the case of zinc and lead further dissolves in the alkaline liquid forming zincate or plumbate ; the heat of solution of zinc and lead oxides in caustic soda being unknown , the total heat development cannot be exactly calculated .

1*837 and 1*081 respectively , * wherefore the E.M.F. due to the chemical action ( including formation of zincate and plumbate ) must be higher still ; on the other hand , the highest values observed in any aeration cell were only 1*645 and 0*954 respectively ( spongy silver-acetate ) , whilst values of from 1 to 4 decivolts lower still were observed with other plates .
Hence the B.M.F. actually generated in these cells falls very considerably short of that corresponding with the chemical , even under the most favourable circumstances , i.e. , when producing only an infinitesimal current ; whilst when producing a somewhat greater current , but still of only small density ( not exceeding a fraction of a micro-ampere per square centimetre of aeration plate surface in some cases ) , running down and marked depreciation of E.M.F. is rapidly brought about .
Much the same remarks apply to cells set up with sulphuric acid and with ammoniacal fluids ; in the former the net chemical change is the oxidation of the metal and solution of the oxide in the acid forming the sulphate .
Julius Thomsen gives the heat values\#151 ; Zinc ... ... .Zn,0 , S03aq = 106090 gram-degrees = 2 *281 volts .

Silver , however , when employed as oxidisable metal , does not show this falling off , but rather the reverse , the highest value observed ( platinum black ) being about Q'58 , and the next highest '(platinum sponge ) about 0*46 , both exceeding the E.M.F. calculated from the heat value ; obviously this is due , not to anything connected with the aeration plates , but rather to the large negative value of the thermo-voltaic constantf pertaining to silver in ' contact with sulphuric aeid , evidenced also by the circumstance observed by us , that when silver is substituted for zinc in a Grove 's cell , instead of the E.M.F. being depressed by an amount * Taking J = 41*5 x 10* , and the unit C.GKS .

[ May 3 , corresponding with the difference in heat of formation of zinc and silver sulphates ( 85700 gram-degrees = 1843 volts ) it is only depressed by an amount short of this by some 5 or 6 decivolts .
Similarly in the ammoniacal cells where ( as in the caustic soda cells ) the action consists in the oxidation of a metal and the solution of the oxide formed in the ammoniacal liquor , Julius Thomsen gives the heat values\#151 ; Zinc ... ... ... v Zn,0 = 85430 = 1*837 volt .

, , Whence the E..M.F , corresponding with the total chemical change must somewhat exceed these amounts by the quantity representing the respective heats of solution in ammonia liquor of the metallic oxides : the highest values observed with zinc and copper tinctly short of these amountsrwhilst the numbers obtained with many kinds of aeration plates in weaker solutions exhibit a large deficiency ; on the other hand , cells containing silver as oxidisable metal show no large falling offr and in the case of the highest values an actual excess of E.M.F. , again indicating a somewhat large negative value for the thermo-voltaic constant applicable to silver in contact with ammoniacal fluids .
It is noticeable that the values of K2 deduced above are not widely different from those equivalent to the difference in heat of oxidation of the various metals , silver exeepted : thus with ^he caustic soda CellS---- \#166 ; ' Y * YY-'YY ' -''.A ' .

On the whole , except when* an oxidisable .
metal is used exhibiting a high negative* value for its thermo-voltaic constant , the E.M.F. of a cell containing an aeration plate and an oxidisable metal always falls short , and ; sometimes largely short , of that equivalent to the chemical changes going on therein even under the*most favourable .

minute : in other words , the modus operandi oi cells of this class is such as necessarily to render a large fraction of the energy non-adjuvant so far as current is concerned .
Just the same remarks apply , as far as our experiments have ' gone , to cells in which the oxidisable substance is in solution , an extreme case of which is exhibited by cells set up with- a solution of sulphurous acid and a submerged platinum foil plate , ,opposed to an aeration plate of platinum* sponge on the surface of dilute sulphuric acid .
Such cells give an .
E.M.F. ( when generating only extremely small currents ) of from 0*2 to 0*3 volt , whilst the heat of oxidation of sulphurous acid solution , S02aq,0 ' is 63634 gram-degrees , according to Julius Thomsen , corresponding *with 1*368 volt , or upwards of a volt more than \#166 ; that , actually produced.* Analogous diminutions in E.MJF .
are brought about in many other cases , to extents depending not only on .
the nature of the aeration plate but also on that of the oxidisable fluid .
* A large part of the depreciation in this case is due to the fact that sulphurous acid solution and platinum constitute an oxidisable portion of a cell behaving as magnesium and aliiminium d6 in cells where they replace zinc , i.e. , giving a much smaller E.M.F. .
than that due to the heat ' corresponding with the chemical change : thus , if a cell he setup with zinc or dilute sulphuric*acid opposed to platinum in sulphuric chromic acid solution , and the zinc and sulphuric-acid be then replaced by platinum and sulphurous acid- solution , the E.M.F. falls-by an amount greater by 0'45 to 0'5 volt than that corresponding with the differences in heat evolu-tion between Zn,0 , S03aq and S02aq,0 ( viz. , 106090 \#151 ; 63634 = 42456 gram-degrees = 0'913 volt ) : and similarly with other oxidising fluids .
Solutions of alkaline sulphites behave similarly .

[ May 3 , Effect of Substituting Oxygen for Air .
In order to see if any material improvement in the E.M.F. of aeration cells could he effected by substituting tolerably pure oxygen for atmospheric air , we carried out a number of observations with plates under a bell-jar supplied with purified oxygen from a reservoir by means of tubes passing through a cork in the narrow mouth .
Readings were first taken for a few days with ordinary air in the jar ; oxygen was then admitted and passed through till gradually all air was displaced'and after a day orrtwo when the readings had become constant another series of-readings for some days was taken .
The oxygen was then displaced by air and another series taken , and so on alternately several times .
The following average values were ultimately obtained -showing .a small , though decided , increment in E.M.F. when atmospheric air was replaced by oxygen .

Some analogous experiments were made with aeration plates in contact with an oxidisable atmosphere ( hydrogen or Goal-gas ) , and an electrolytic fluid united by means of a siphon with an external vessel containing an oxidising solution ( alkaline permanganate , sulphuric acid containing Chromic-acid , ^nitric acid , \amp ; c. ) in which a plate\#187 ; of platinum foil was immersed .
The readings thus obtained were nothing like as concordant as those above described ( probably from the difficulty of excluding air .

Spongy platinum and palladium obviously are far more effective as regards the E.M.F. set up than the other plates used ; the chemical action taking place may be regarded as the decomposition of alkaline permanganate into hydrated manganese dioxide , caustic potash , and oxygen ( or of chromic anhydride , and sulphuric acid into chromium sulphate , water , and oxygen ) , and the combination of hydrogen with the oxygen thus set free ; according to Thomsen 's values , the heat developed would accordingly be per 16 grams oxygen ^evolved\#151 ; Alkaline cells .

On making the current passing larger by diminishing the external resistance , the E.M.F. always fell rapidly ; so that in order to obtain a current capable of producing any considerable Presents .
[ May 3 , amount of electrolytic decomposition in a voltameter , it was practically impossible to have an acting E.M.F. as high as 1 volt , even with tolerably large platinum sponge plates .
Much the same result was obtained on opposing to one another two platinum sponge aeration plates , one in an atmosphere of hydrogen or coal-gas , the other in contact with air ; in no case could any current capable of depositing a few milligrams of silver per day be obtained with an E.M.F. as great as 1 volt ; i.e. , a total depreciation of upwards of 0'5 volt was occasioned , or more than one-third of the energy due to the chemical change , viz. , oxidation of hydrogen to water , representing 68360 gram-degrees , or 1*470 volt , The economical production of currents by the direct oxidation of combustible gases , therefore , does not seem at present to be a problem likely to be readily solved .
