] Several ancient and modern writers have described a species of Ocythoe often found in the Paper Nautilus , and have considered it as belonging to that shell .
Sir Joseph Banks and other naturalists have maintained a contrary opinion , and have considered the Ocythoe as a parasitical inhabitant of the Argonaut 's shell .
Rafinesque , whose opportunities for observation were commensurate with his talent in observing , regarded it as a peculiar genus , allied to the Sepia octopodia of Linnaeus , and as a parasitical resident of the above-mentioned shell .
The observations of the late Mr. John Cranch , zoologist to the Congo expedition , have , in the opinion of Dr. Leach , removed all doubt upon this subject .
In the Gulf of Guinea he took several specimens of a new species of Ocythoi in a small Argonauta , and placed two of them in a vessel of sea-water , so as to observe their motions .
When adhering to the basin the shell could be removed ; they had the power both of retiring within it and of entirely quitting it .
One having left the shell lived several hours , and showed no desire to return .
Others quitted the shell while taking up the net .
Ocythoe differs from the Polypus in the shortness of its arms ; in having pedunculated instead of simple suckers ; in having four oblong spots on the inside of the tube , and a small fleshy short tubercle immediately above the bronchise , on each side , -a character common to this genus , to Loligo , and to Sepia , but which does not exist in Polypus .
This paper concludes with a descriptive reference to the drawing , which shows the animal in and out of the shell .
It is called by the author Ocythoi Cranchii .
