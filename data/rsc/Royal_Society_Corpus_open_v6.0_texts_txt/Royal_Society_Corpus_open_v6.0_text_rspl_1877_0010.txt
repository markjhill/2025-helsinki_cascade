( Abstract .
) The tidal observations at Port Kennedy were made hourly for 23 days ; ' and in my former discussion of these tides ( Part VI .
) I used only the ob-i servations made in the neighbourhood of H. W. and L. " W. , obtaining t the following results for the Tidal Coefficients :\#151 ; Diurnal Tide .
S=23*4 inches .
t , =5h 12m .
M=20*9 inches .
\#187 ; m=0h 34m .
Semidiurnal Tide .
S=7*0 inches .
t , " M=17*0 inches .

On the Tides of the Arctic Seas .
[ Mar. 15 , In the present discussion I have employed all the hourly observations made during the 23 days , and have obtained the following results :\#151 ; Diurnal Tide .
S=36*4 inches i , = 3h 2m .
M=18*5 inches .
im= \#151 ; 2h 48m .
Semidiurnal Tide .
S = 5*9 inches .
i , = 2h 48m .
M=15*5 inches .
im=6h 2|m .
The present more complete discussion fully confirms the result before obtained by me respecting the great magnitude of the Solar Diurnal Tide at this station , and also shows a satisfactory agreement in the other coefficients obtained from H. W. and L. W. observations only .
The method employed in the present paper is based on Fourier 's Theorem , by which the height of tide is expressed as follows:\#151 ; +Aj cos s + Aa cos 2s+\amp ; c. , F=A0 +sin s + B2 cos 2s+\amp ; c. , where F=height of water .
s=hour-angle of sun .
The coefficients A0 , Ax , A2 , Bx , B2 , \amp ; c. , being found by well-known ; formulae , they are again expressed , by Fourier 's Theorem , as follows :\#151 ; ' +ax cos u-\-a2 cos 2w+ \amp ; c. , A"=a0 + \ sin u-\-b2 sin 2w+\amp ; c. , where u passes through all its changes in a fortnight , and the coefficients are calculated in a similar manner .
The known theoretical formulae for the Diurnal and Semidiurnal Tides , expressed in terms of parallax , declination , lunar and solar hour-angles , are now converted into functions of the true and mean anomaly and of the sun s hour-angle , and finally into simple functions of s and u. These expansions are now compared , term by term , with the terms of the tidal expansions found by means of Fourier 's Theorem , and the final Lunar and Solar Tidal Coefficients calculated out with ease .
Although the short period of observation at Port Kennedy ( 23 days ) J renders this method of discussion not much more valuable than the usual | method of H. ~W .
and L. ~W .
observations , I have developed it at length ' in the hope of applying the method to more complete series of Arctic Tides , which I hope shortly to lay before the Loyal Society .
In developing this method I found it necessary to make use of the ; following series , for which I am indebted to my friend Mr. Beniamin | Williamson , F.T.C.D. 1877.1 On the Transformation of Leucoline into Aniline .

In a previous research* on the pyridine series of bases the formation and properties of dicarbopyridinic acid were described .
This acid derivative is related to pyridine in the same manner as phthalic acid to benzol .
It was then pointed out that the members of the pyridine and chinoline series bear to one another a similar relation to that of benzol and naphthaline , the following analogies being given:\#151 ; c2h2 f C6H4 f C6H4 c2h2 c5h3n C2H2 iC2H2 iC2H2 CNH c2h2 C2Ha ( c2h2 Ic6h4 C2H2 CjHj Benzol .
Naphthaline .
Anthracene .
Pyridine .
Chinoline .
An extension of the work was promised in support of these theoretical relations .
Our knowledge of the chinoline series has made little progress since ) the masterly and exhaustive investigation of G-reville Williams t , proving the isomerism of the tar and cinchona bases .
The relations of these bodies are still very obscure , owing to the great stability of the bases preventing the formation of derivatives of a simpler type .
Indeed some of the most interesting products obtained from these bases , such as * " On the Oxidation Products of Picoline , " Trans. Royal Soo .
