On the Comparative Action of Stovaine and Cocaine as measured by their Direct Effect upon the Contractility of Isolated Muscle .

( Received November 8 , \#151 ; Read December 9 , 1909 .
) It has been shown by Yeley* that the affinity values of stovaine and cocaine by the methyl orange and borax precipitation methods are approximately equal .
The method of measuring physiological activity of anaesthetic drugs , as described by Waller , f affords an independent control that can usefully be compared with affinity values .
Stovaine , sometimes called amyleine hydrochloride and originally prepared by Fourneau , has been successfully applied in recent years , especially for spinal anaesthesia , as also for general surgery and dentistry .
As it is used for the same purposes and in doses of the same order as cocaine , the relative value of the two drugs has been compared in a series of memoirs or notices , more than 150 in number in various clinical journals .
The general conclusions arrived at are : ( 1 ) as anaesthetics the drugs are of equal value , but stovaine produces vaso-dilatation , cocaine vaso-constriction ; and ( 2 ) stovaine is less toxic than cocaine .
The statement has even been made that stovaine does not produce any toxic effect .
Though , as stated above , the affinity values are approximately equal , yet the chemical constitution of the two compounds is wholly dissimilar .
Stovaine is the hydrochloride of methyl ethyl dimethylamino-methyl carbinol benzoate HC1C(0H3)[CH2N(CH3)2](02H5)0Bz and the base ( molecular weight = 235 ) , a benzoyl derivative of a diamino-tertiary amyl alcohol C(CH3)2(C2H5)OH ( Fourneau).j ; Cocaine ( molecular weight of base = 303 ) is the methyl ester of benzoyl * 'Trans .

If stovaine and cocaine had not been used for identical purposes in surgery , no comparison would ever have been instituted in chemistry .
The crystalline samples of stovaine , kindly supplied by Messieurs Poulenc Fr\amp ; res , and of cocaine hydrochloride , by Messrs. Burroughs Wellcome \amp ; Co. , had been tested and used for experiments on the affinity values by the methyl orange and borax precipitation methods .
The solutions were made upon the same day of n/ 10 concentration , and subsequently diluted to nf500 and w/ 1000 .
Simultaneous records were taken with the same pair of muscles as a " crucial " experiment .

, " end of 1st , 2nd , and commencement of 3rd lines ) was rather better in the case of cocaine than in that of stovaine .
Oh reversing the solutions it was found that too long a time would be required for total abolition , so solutions of double the strength were substituted .
The times required for abolition were then\#151 ; stovaine 4 minutes and cocaine 5-5 minutes , and the subsequent recovery was rather better for the latter than for the former .
It is evident that , judged by this method , there is no appreciable difference between these two drugs ; the slight difference observed is rather in favour of cocaine being the less toxic .
Comparative experiments on nerve with solutions of stovaine and cocaine of the same molecular concentration also showed quite a trifling difference .

) The methyl analogue of stovaine or trimethyl dimethylamino-methyl carbinol benzoate HC1C(CH3)3 CH2N(CH3)2.OBz , derived from the tertiary butyl alcohol C(CH3)3OH , was also studied .
The sample , also supplied by Messieurs Poulenc Freres , had previously been found to have an affinity value slightly above that of stovaine .

Simultaneous record of two sartorius muscles , R and L , the former in 500 , the latter in m/ 1000 solution of methyl stovaine ( in saline ) .
As appears from these records , abolition took place in the following times : 23'5 minutes for m/ 1000 , and 18 minutes for m/ 500 ; the recovery in the former case was nearly complete , in the latter very incomplete .
It appears that , as regards the m/ 1000 solution , methyl stovaine does not differ materially from stovaine , the times of abolition and degree of recovery being almost identical .
As regards the m/ 500 solution , though the time required for abolition is rather longer than might be expected , the degree of recovery is quite in accord with that of stovaine .
The general conclusion is , therefore , that the substitution of the ethyl group in stovaine by the methyl group produces no alteration in toxic effect , and this result is quite in accordance with the affinity values of the two substances in question .
