] This paper comprises a series of very numerous experiments on the effects of various stimuli applied to the brain and nerves of rabbits and frogs , in exciting the voluntary muscles , the heart , and the bloodvessels ; from which the author infers , That the laws which regulate their effects on the muscles of voluntary and involuntary motion are different .
That both mechanical and chemical stimuli applied to any part of the nervous system tend to increase the action of the heart .
That neither mechanical nor chemical stimuli applied excite the muscles of voluntary motion , unless they are applied near the origin of the spinal marrow .
That mechanical stimuli have more effect than chemical on voluntary muscles , but the reverse with respect to those of involuntary motion .
That all stimuli continue to affect the heart long after they have failed to excite the muscles of voluntary motion .
That the motions thus excited in voluntary muscles are irregular , but those of the heart more regular .
That the former occur chiefly at the first moment of application , but those of the latter as long as the stimulus is applied .
That the former depend on intensity of the stimulus , the latter on the extent of surface to which it is applied .
That the power of the blood-vessels , like that of the heart , is independent of the nervous system , though they may be influenced through that system , as the heart is .
That the actions thus excited are regular , as those of the heart , and that their power , like that of the heart , may be destroyed through the nervous system .
