Remarks .
OF all the instruments observed and recorded by the meteorologist , the hygrometer is in many respects the most valuable , both in a scientific and practical point of view ; for , by a simple knowledge of the point at which the atmosphere can contain no more vapour without precipitation at its existing temperature , and which is called the point of saturation or temperature of the dew-point , many other highly important collateral conditions , such as the elastic force of vapour , the weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air , and the additional weight required for complete saturation at all temperatures of the air , the relative degree of humidity , and the weight of a cubic foot of air under the ever-varying circumstances of heat , moisture and pressure , may readily be obtained , either by well-known formulae , or by inspection from tables prepared for the purpose .
But the hygrometer is also of no small value in the arts and in the practical concerns of life : as a prognosticator of the weather it stands second to no other instrument except the barometer , which it often rivals in the faithfulness of its movements ; whilst the condition of the air as to moisture or dryness is acknowledged by all physicians to have no slight effect on the human body , both in its normal and abnormal state ; but more especially are its influences visible on the friame of the invalid , either in aiding to restore healthy functions , or in promoting the exacerbation of disease .
It is therefore of no small moment that scientific observers , at least , should possess an instrument by which that important element , the dew-point , can be accurately and expeditiously obtained .
DALTON and other old meteorologists made use of glass vessels filled with spring water , which retains a nearly unifolrm temperature throughout the year ; and , in the summer months , it was generally found sufficient to cause a deposit of moisture on the outside surface of the glass .
In winter , ice or snow was mixed with the water , or when the temperature was very low , freezing mixtures were employed .
The dew was carefully wiped from the surface of the vessel as long as it continued to form , and the moment it ceased , the temperature of the water was carefully noted and recorded as the existing dew-point .
This rough and tedious method has however long been superseded by the use of that beautiful and delicate apparatus bearing the name of the late Professor DANIELL , which gives the dew-point at once in degrees of FAHRENHEIT'S scale .
Highly valuable as this instrument unquestionably is , it is yet open to some objections , more especially in the hands of non-scientific persons .
1st .
The reduction of the air temperature to that of the dew-point is effected by the rapid evaporation of sulphuric ether from a hollow ball of glass covered with fine muslin .
Now ether is rather an expensive material , and it is essential that it should be unadulterated and of the strongest description , and such cannot always be obtained , even in large towns .
An old established and respectable druggist tells me , that until recently ( and the practice probably still exists in many places ) it was the invariable custom of the trade to mix one part of spirtits of wine with every two parts of ether .
And I remember examining some ether in use by a young fiiend who professed to take hygrometrical observations with this instrument , which I should say contained a still larger proportion of alcohol in combination with water .
This analysis of its composition is based on the fact that it might be used ad libitum , without depressing the temperature more than two or three degrees .
Long experience has convinced me , that unless the evaporating fluid be pure , the results , if obtained at all , cannot be depended upon .
The Ether rect .
fort .
should , if possible , be employed .
2nd .
Some experience , great care and a quick eye , are requisite to secure accurate observations , and to catch the temperature at the exact moment when the annulus of dew begins to form on the dark bulb in the plane of the internal liquid surface .
3rd .
If the ether be dropped on the bulb too quickly , too high a dew-point will be obtained .
The ether phial should be fitted with a small siphon , and the heat communicated to the fluid by the hand will be sufficient to force it out slowly in drops .
4th .
The atmosphere may be so exceedingly dry , particularly in the months of April and May , that no quantity of ether , even of the best kind , will suffice to reduce the temperature to the point of saturation .
And this is more especially the case in warm climates , where this fluid deteriorates most rapidly by keeping .
At sea , in tropical latitudes , I have sometimes been unable to find the dew-point with DANIELL'S instrument for two or three consecutive days .
Such instances are however rare in this country ; when they occur , freezing mixtures must be had recourse to , but I have very seldom had occasion to use them .
The greatest difference I have ever observed between the temperature of the air and the dew-point , was 28 ?
, on the 27th of April , 1842 .
The highest dew-point I have recorded was 68 ?
, on the 17th of August , 1843 , with 7*53 grs. of vapour in a cubic foot ; the lowest was 8 ?
, on the 14th of February in the same year , the air temperature being 26 ?
, and the weight of vapour in a cubic foot only 0'87 gr. The dryand wet-bulb thermometers , as a means of obtaining the dew-point , did 142 not come into use until many years after the invention of DANIELL'S instrument , and from the want of correct tables , based on an accurate knowledge of the relation existing between the air and evaporation temperatures and the temperature of the dewpoint , they were , until recently , of comparatively little service to the scientific observer .
When the magnetic and meteorological observatory was , at the suggestion of the Royal Society , established at Greenwich , two-hourly observations of the dryand wetbulb thermometers began to be taken , whilst the dew-point from DANIELL'S hygrometer was recorded every six hours , simultaneously with the temperature of the dry and wet bulbs ; and these readings have been continued up to the present time .
Such frequent observations , made by careful and competent observers with the best instruments , could not fail in time to afford the requisite data for the computation of an empirical dew-point , at all known temperatures of the air .
The volume of Greenwich Magnetical and Meteorological Observations ( copies of which the Astronomer Royal is kind enough to send me ) for 1843 , contains a conmplete discussion of the results down to 1845 , from which the following factors were deduced : Whenthe ] the difference between the ) temperabelow 24 ?

15 From these data , Mr. GLAISHER , of the Royal Observatory , in the year 1847 , cal143 15 51 59 14 111 I9 2l 19 51 I15 1 cuilated , arranged and printed , at his own cost , an elaborate series of tables , showing , at a glance , the relation of the temperature of evaporation to that of the dew-point at every degree of the air temperature , from 100 to 90 ?
; also the elastic force of vapour , weight of vapour in a cubic foot , the remaining quantity required for complete saturation , the relative degree of humidity , and the weight in grains of a cubic foot of air , under the varying conditions of heat , of humidity and of pressure .
Notwithstanding a conviction of the accuracy of Mr. GLAISHER'S tables , both from the well-known character of the chief observer and compiler , and the favourable circumstances under which the elements were obtained , yet having found similar tables defective , and having used DANIELL'S apparatus with satisfaction for many years , I felt reluctant to abandon it for the wetand dry-bulb thermometers , slight as is the trouble of observing them , without personal experience of the correctness of the tables by which the dew-point was to be eliminated .
Accordingly , I sent up my DANIELL'S hygrometer to Greenwich for comparison with the observatory standard thermometer , and , at the same time , Mr. GLAISHER kindly procured me a pair of delicate thermometers on the same metal friame , selected from a number of others , and made by BARROW of Oxenden Street .
These thermometers were considered to have identical readings under similar circumstances , and both to agree with the Greenwich standard .
The dew-point thermometer was also found to be generally correct , the errors mostly amounting to small fiactions of a degree .
With these instruments the observations embodied in the annexed Tables were made in the years 1847 and 1848 , the hours of observing being 11 o'clock in the morning , and 3 o'clock in the afternoon .

010 , and in 1848 it is but 00'07 , the mean of the two periods comprising 1220 observations , amounting to the comparatively evanescent fraction of --6ths of a degree ; and , had the instruments been absolutely perfect , doubtless the accordanc btween the o dew-points would have be the en still more obvious .
Hence the results show , in a striking manner , the extreme accuracy of Mr. GLAISHER'S Tables , and add additional testimony to the value of the Greenwich hygrometrical observations , and the resulting formula on which those Tables are founded .
Being strongly impressed with the utility and importance of these tables , I am induced to give my own experimental evidence in their favour , which ( coming from a wholly disinterested party ) may perhaps be entitled to some weight ; and , in the hope of giving them greater publicity , and of bringing them into that general use which they so well merit , 1 beg to lay that evidence before the Royal Society .
By means of the tables founded on the Greenwich hygrometrical observations , the combination of the dryand wet-bulb thermometers is converted into a very delicate scientific instrument , possessing many advantages over that of DANIELL , not the least of which is , that its readings may be depended upon , even in the hands of the most inexperienced and uneducated person .
Thus , observations on the hygrometrical state of the atmosphere may be obtained on mountains , at great heights above the sea , on the sea itself , in mines , and various other inconvenient localities , by those whose occupations or callings lead them to spend a considerable portion of their time in such situations .
In this way illiterate persons may become truly valuable assistantsto the meteorologist in his researches , and the observations secured by the shepherd , the miner , and the mariner may afterwards be turned to good account by the philosopher in his closet .
It is however necessary that the thermometers used for this purpose should be essentially good , and , if possible , that their readings should agree with each other , and with a standard instrument .
But as perfect thermometers are very difficult to obtain , most of such instruments will differ from a standard at one point or other of the scale .
They should therefore be carefully compared , and the errors allowed for , either at each reading , at the end of every month , or at some stated period .
The goodness of the instrumenj , or the application of the corrections , is the more essential , as any error in either or both the thermometers is considerably increased in the resulting temperature of the dew-point .
The bulbs should be carried fully an inch below the metal or wood scale .
The wet bulb should be covered with book-muslin , and the best conductor of the water from the cistern to the bulb is a piece of cotton lamp-wick , which must be changed as circumstances require , as in time it is apt to lose its capillary action .
In winter , the water in the vessel will fiequently be frozen , and the wet bulb quite dry : in this case the bulb must be moistened , when a coating of ice will form on it , from which evaporation will take place : an hour or more will however sometimes elapse before the temperature of the moist bulb falls below that of the dry .
It is well known that evaporation goes on freely from the surface of frozen water , even when the whole mass is converted into a solid block of ice .
From the 11th to the 16th of December 1846 , during which a brisk breeze prevailed , the loss from my evaporation gauge was 0'450 inch , or '075 per diem , the average of the month being but '033 per diem .
In twelve days of frost in February , 1847 , the evaporation from the ice was '552 , or 046 per day , the average daily quantity for the mionth being '030 .
During ten days of keen frost , between the 20th and 30th of January , 1848 , the ice had parted with 0'324 inch , or -032 per diem , the average daily loss for the month being only '024 .
For five days of December 1848 , the loss was Q0.37 per diem , the daily average for the month being '032 ; and from the 1st to the 8th of January , 1849 , the depth evaporatedc was equivalent to '017 per dierm , the average daily loss during the month being '029 inch .
Hence it appears , that notwithstanding the large amount of heat required , not only to liquify but to vaporize frozen water , the vapour thrown off by ice in an invisible form exceeds in amount the average daily evaporation from an equal surface of water in the winter season .
This apparently anomalous circumstance probably arises from the extreme dryness of the atmosphere , and its consequently increased capacity for vapour in severe frosts , whereas at other times during the winter the air is very moist near the sea , being generally not more than 2 ?
or 3 ?
above the point of saturation .
The subject of evaporation has been very little investigated or treated of since the publication of Mr. HOWARD'S 'Climate of London ' in the year 1818 , and having paid considerable attention to this department of meteorology for several years past , I may perhaps be excused ( though not directly connected with the issue of this paper ) from bliefly giving the results of my own investigations , obtained at nearly the opposite point of the kingdom .
Evaporation is scarcely ever entirely suspended , either during the heaviest rains , or when the air is completely saturated with vapour ; at 146 least , I have not met with more than two or three instances in which some daily loss was not appreciable to a finely graduated metre .
In severe nights , the depth evaporated in twenty-four hours will sometimes , though very rarely , reach -14-ths of an inch .
On the 22nd of May , 1844 , 0'430 was measured , and on a freezing inixture being applied to , DANIELL'S hygrometer , the dew-point was found to be 24 ?
below the temperature of the air , which was 63 ? .
''he evaporation for the month was 6*280 inches , with only a quarter of an inch of rain .

, by 15'244 inches .
The evaporation gauge with which the above experiments were made , is a copper vessel 8 inches in diameter , and rather more than an inch and a half in depth .
Half an inch of water is accurately measured and poured into the dish , and the daily loss ascertained each morning at 9 o'clock , by means of a carefully graduated tube reading to the thousandth part of an incht .
The evaporation dish receives a fair proportion of wind and sun , and is always exposed in the open air during the day , except when rain is falling .
At night , and in wet weather , it is placed under a capacious shed , 9 feet in height , and open in front .
Thus , it is conceived , that the evaporating surface is freely acted upon by all the circumstances concerned in promoting this natural process .
Mr. HOWARD found the evaporation near the surface of the ground in the neighbourhood of London to be about 20 inches , or 5 inches under the average fall of rain ; but the gauge was constantly under cover , and consequently but little exposed to the direct rays of the sun , which will account for the great difference between the results at Whitehaven and the metropolis .
Had the gauges been in all respects similarly circumstanced , the evaporation at London , from its higher mean temperature , would probably have been found to exceed the amount registered in the higher latitude .
