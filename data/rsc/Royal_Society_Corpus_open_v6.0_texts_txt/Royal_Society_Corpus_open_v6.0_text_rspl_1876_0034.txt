156 Prof. B. Stewart on the Variations [ June 15 , living matter may and does originate independently during the progress of fermentation in previously germless fluids .
As a result of the fermentative changes taking place in boiled urine or other complex organic solutions , many new chemical compounds are produced : gases are given off , or these with other soluble products mix imperceptibly with the changing and quickening mother-liquid , in all parts of which certain insoluble products also make their appearance .
Such insoluble products reveal themselves to us as specks of protoplasm , that is of 'living ' matter ; they gradually emerge into the region of the visible , and speedily assume the well-known forms of one or other variety of Bacteria .
These insoluble particles would thus in their own persons serve to bridge the narrow gulf between certain kinds of ' living ' and of ' dead matter , and thereby afford a long-sought for illustration of th e transition from chemical to so-called ' vital ' combinations .

" On the Variations of the Daily Range of Atmospheric Temperature as recorded at the Kew Observatory ."By Balfour Stewart , LL. D. , F.R.S. , Professor of Natural Philosophy at Owens College , Manchester .
Received May 25 , 1876 .
( Abstract .
) The daily temperature-range was selected as an element which affords a good indication of the varying meteorological activity of the place , and the observations of which can be easily made and reduced .
The records of the Kew Observatory were chosen because there the atmospheric temperature has been very carefully observed during a long series of years .
The writer desires to thank the Kew Committee for giving him access to the records of the maximum and minimum temperatures taken at the Kew Observatory .
Twenty-one years of these records have been reduced , beginning with the year 1855 and ending with 1875 .
Two complete sun-spot periods are embraced in these observations .
The first Table exhibits ( a point already well known ) the annual variation of the temperature-range , which is greatest in summer and least in winter .
The same Table shows that the yearly means of this element exhibit considerable fluctuations amongst themselves .
Thus we have corresponding to the years 1856 , 1866 , and 1875 the values 12'-69 , 13'*61 , and 13'-25 respectively , while corresponding to the years 1859 and 1870 we have the values 140,52 and 150,63 .
Inasmuch as the three former are years of minimum , and the two latter years of maximum sun-spots , this would seem to show that the daily temperature-range is least for minimum and greatest for maximum sun-spot years .

] of the Daily Range of Atmospheric Temperature .
157 But , on the other hand , and against this evidence , there is a temperature-fluctuation between 1859 and 1866 as great , or nearly as great , as any which apparently corresponds to sun-spot period .
This temperature-oscillation may perhaps be identified with a subsidiary sun-spot fluctuation as exhibited in the curves of Messrs. DeLa Rue , Stewart , and Loewy , but it is out of proportion to it in relative magnitude .
If we still regard it as most likely , though not proven , both from the evidence of the paper and from collateral considerations , that there is some connexion between the daily temperature-range and the state of the sun with regard to spots , then we may perhaps suppose that this redundant temperature-oscillation is a local phenomenon .
There is , however , another possible explanation which will be afterwards alluded to .
It is then endeavoured to ascertain whether the temperature-range has any reference to the relative position of the sun and moon .
For this purpose the whole period of 21 years has been portioned out into lunations , each lunation being divided into 8 parts:\#151 ; ( 0 ) , ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7)\#151 ; ( 0 ) corresponding to new and ( 4 ) to full moon .
From the whole series of lunations the following result is obtained:\#151 ; Phase of lunation ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Temp.-range ... .
14-08 1420 14'29 1405 13-95 1383 1404 14-17 which presents the appearance of a curve of double period superposed upon one of single period .
The range , however , is not great .
If we now make use of the lunations corresponding to the six winter months ( October to March ) , we obtain :\#151 ; Phase of lunation ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Temp.-range ... .
1418 11-37 1132 10-88 10 52 1049 10-79 1 405 Treating in the same way the lunations for the six summer months , we obtain:\#151 ; Phase of lunation ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Temp.-range ... .
1696 1702 17'23 1722 17'35 1745 1724 1727 It is then noticed how large and persistent the winter lunar variation is , and how the series of observations may be split into two parts , each of which represents it .
Thus we obtain :\#151 ; Phase of lunation ... . .
( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Winter variation ( 1855-65 ) 1408 11-30 1424 1077 10-50 1076 10-89 10-93 " ( 1866-75 ) 1429 1 444 11-40 1 400 10 57 1017 1069 1 418 Confining ourselves to the winter variation , which it thus appears is very prominent , it is then attempted to show that this variation ( as far as we can gather from the Kew observations ) appears to vary with the sunspot period , being greatest at times of maximum spots and least at times of minimum spots , very nearly in the proportion of two to one .
Allusion is then made to certain recent researches of Mr. J. A. Broun , in which he shows that the sun appears to be one-sided as far as his action of certain kinds upon the earth is concerned .
From this , and from the fact that while the moon appears to be concerned in the temperature-range , Dr. H. Airy on the [ June 15 , its influence nevertheless appears to depend on the solar activity ( a result similar to that obtained by Mr. J. A. Broun in the case of terrestrial magnetism ) , it is argued that even if there be a connexion between mean annual temperature-range and the sun-spot period , yet we cannot expect both periods to march together in the same way , inasmuch as the first is due entirely to the sun , while the latter appears to depend upon the moon as well .
This may possibly explain the redundant temperature fluctuation already alluded to ; but the discussion of the subject must be further advanced before we can pronounce upon this point .

" On the Leaf-arrangement of the Crowberry nigrum ) .
" By Hubert Airy , M.A. , M.D. Communicated by Charles Darwin , M.A. , F.R.S. Received May 8 , 1876 .
( Abstract .
) Pursuing the study of leaf-arrangement , the author finds that the crowberry of our moors ( Empetrum nigrum ) habitually exhibits a peculiar mo le of variation in the arrangement of the leaves on different parts of the same twig .
Out of fifty crowberry-twigs taken at random , only four ( and these fragments ) preserved the same arrangement throughout .
In the remaining forty-six the leaf-arrangement was found to undergo a progressive change in ascending from the base of the twig to the summit\#151 ; a change from a simpler order to others more complex .
In general the basal order was that denoted by the fraction f ; and this was found to pass most frequently into f , which in turn was found to pass into | , with or without an intermediate set of whorls of 4 : -| generally passed into whorls of 5 , sometimes into T2T , which was the most complex arrangement that was met with in this plant .
The following is a list of the transitions found in the fifty specimens :\#151 ; Transition from 4 ( or -| ) to .
