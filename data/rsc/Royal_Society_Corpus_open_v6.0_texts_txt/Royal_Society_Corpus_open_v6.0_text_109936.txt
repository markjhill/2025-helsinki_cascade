] The object of this paper is to explain two methods of finding the sums of a variety of infinite series .
One of these the author discovered several years ago ; but finding that some of the results to which it led were erroneous , he then declined publishing it .
In inquiring into the causes of these errors , he was led to the second method , which employs the process of integration relative to finite differences .
The cause of the fallacies in the former method was afterwards discovered , and in this paper a criterion is proposed for judging of the truth of the results , and a mode of correcting them where found to be erroneous .
The sums of a variety of series are found by these methods ; and the author concludes by observing , that he has since been informed by M. Poisson , that that gentleman had arrived at some nearly similar results in investigating a problem in physical astronomy , and also that some investigations of a similar nature were found amongst the papers of Lagrange , but that neither of these mathematicians had explained the cause of the errors , or given a method of correcting them .
