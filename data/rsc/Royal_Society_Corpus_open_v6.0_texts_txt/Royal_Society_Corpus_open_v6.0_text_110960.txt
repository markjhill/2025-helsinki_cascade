" On the reabsorption of the Mixed Gases in a Voltameter .
" By Professor M. H. Jacobi , in a letter to Michael Faraday , Esq. , F.R.S. Communicated by Dr. Faraday .
The author found that if the mixed gases developed from the decomposition of water by a voltaic current , be allowed to remain in the voltameter in which they were collected , in contact with the fluid which produced them , they by degrees diminish in volume , and ultimately disappear by being absorbed by the fluid .
He has not yet fully determined the precise conditions on which this phenomenon depends ; but he is inclined to think that it is owing to a portion of the mixed gases , diffused throughout the whole liquid , coming into contact with the platinum plates , and being recombined on the surface of those plates ; and this process being renewed with every fresh portion of the gases which takes the place of the former , the whole of the gases are thus reconverted into water .
