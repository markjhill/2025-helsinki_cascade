1894.1 Contributions to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll .
351 crystals of a mineral somewhat resembling ottrelite have been developed ; a conglomerate , the matrix of which is rather altered , as in the case of certain " Huronian " conglomerates , and a black-garnet micaceous schist , exactly resembling a rock which occurs in the Lepontine Alps at various localities from the neighbourhood of the Lukmanier Pass to the Binnen-Thal .
Several of the schists resemble those which occur in the " upper schist " group ( as defined by one of the authors ) in the Alpine chain .
Certain rather fine-grained speckled gneisses resemble a variety of that rock common in the Blair Athol district ( Scotland ) .
f Among the minerals or vein-specimens , the most interesting is one which presents some resemblance to jadeite .
Microscopic examination shows it to consist of an aggregate of minute minerals , very difficult to distinguish , and chemical analysis suggests that the most probable are lime-garnet , jadeite , saussurite , or an allied mineral , and a pyroxene .
As the specimen was collected from a moraine , its origin is conjectural , but that it was a vein-specimen seems most probable .
The minerals ( among others ) are actinolite , garnet , idocrase , noble serpentine , pyrite , and copper ores .
The geographical distribution of the rocks is described , and it is shown that in these mountains , as in the Alps , remnants of sedimentary rocks , probably of more than one geological era , are folded in among great masses of crystalline rocks , some , doubtless of igneous origin , but others metamorphosed sediments .
It is evident that here , also , the rocks , as a rule , have been greatly modified by the effects of I earth-movements .
V. " Contributions to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll .
No. V. " By Edward Schunck , F.R.S. Received February 15 , 1894 .
My previous papers were devoted to a description of various products derived from chlorophyll and their qualitative reactions .
In the present communication I propose to give an account of some experiments made with a view to ascertain the composition of some of the derivatives of chlorophyll previously described .
Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining quantities of the various substances in a state sufficiently pure for analysis .
This was especially the case with phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin , which , by the methods of purification employed so far , cannot be obtained entirely free from fatty matter .
No attempt was therefore made to determine their composition .
Of the compounds of phyllocyanin there is one , the phyllocyanin cupric acetate , which crystallises well , and has the appearance of a definite compound .
Its composition was Dr. E. Schunck .
[ Apr. 19 , accordingly determined , two analyses made by different observers leading to concordant results .
Unfortunately , as previously explained , the compound is of such a nature as to make the elimination of copper and the consequent separation of the phyllocyanin impossible ; otherwise the preparation of pure phyllocyanin from the compound would have been easy .
More satisfactory results were obtained in the case of phyllotaonin and its compounds .
These beautiful substances being well crystallised and easily soluble in chloroform , but much less so in alcohol , may be obtained in a state of comparative purity , and I have reason to think that the numbers yielded by analysis represent , with tolerable accuracy , the cbmposition of these bodies , although , in consequence of their high atomic weights , some doubt remains even as regards the corresponding empirical formulae .

to be recrystallised several times in order to get it into a state fit for analysis .
This process of purification , as -well as the subsequent determinations , were undertaken by Dr. L. Marchlewski , whose scrupulous care and manipulative skill afford a sufficient guarantee for the accuracy of the results obtained .
I think it unnecessary to give the details of analysis of more or less pure specimens of the substance , but I may state that the crystals when first prepared gave the following percentages of C , H , and N. C ... ... ... ... 70-27 H ... ... ... ... 5-89 N ... ... ... ... .

The substance , after being purified by dissolving it in chloroform , adding a large quantity of alcohol , and collecting the crystals deposited on standing , the process being repeated three times , gave as the result of two determinations 11*93 and 11*85 per cent , nitrogen .
After three further crystallisations the percentage of nitrogen was found to be 12'07 and 11-87 .
The four analyses agreeing so well as regards the nitrogen it was assumed that the substance was pure , and it only remained therefore to determine the C and H , the results obtained being as follows : I. 0*1521 gram substance gave 0*3838 C02 and 0*0852 H20 .

" Thermo-electric Properties of Salt Solutions .
" By George Frederick Emery , B.A. , LL. M. ; of the Inner Temple , late Scholar of Trinity College , Cambridge .
Communicated by-Professor J. J. Thomson , F.R.S. Received February 8 , 1894 .
The thermo-electrical properties of solutions have not hitherto received much attention from physicists .
If we form a circuit of two substances , one a metallic wire and the other a solution , and arrange it so that the junctions between the metal and the liquid are at different temperatures , we generally find that an electromotive force is developed in the circuit which varies in magnitude nearly in proportion to the difference of temperature between the junctions , and which , in comparison with the ordinary thermo-electromotive forces in metallic circuits , is very considerable .
Up to the present time , as far as I am aware , the only extensive measurements of such thermoelectric forces are those of M. Bouty ( ' Journ. de Phys. , * vol. 9 ) .
He concludes that for a given difference of temperature between the junctions when the metal is constant the E.M.F. is nearly independent of the nature and strength of the solution ( the solution being of some salt of the metal used ) .
The object of my experiments has been to see how far this is true , , and to find out how ( in the event of its not being strictly true ) the E.M.E. varies with variations both in the strength and in the nature of the solution .
The results show that both have considerable influence on the magnitude of the E.M.F. My method of observation is as follows : the solution to be examined is put in a -tube ( fig. 1 , A ) , in each limb of which is one of the , j ends of metal , which we may for convenience call electrodes ,
