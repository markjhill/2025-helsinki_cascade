] The number of the * Gazzetta Chimica Italiana ' published on February 12 , 1907 , contains a communication received by the editor on December 17,1906 , " Su le azioni idrolitiche diverse prodotto da un solo enzima , " by L. Marino and G. Sericano , * in which the conclusion is arrived at that the resolution of amygdalin by an extract of yeast into glucose and amygdonitrileglucoside is conditioned not by the enzyme maltase but by invertase .
We have long been aware that maltase does not effect the hydrolysis of amygdalin and to this extent can confirm Marino and Sericano 's observations ; but the conclusion that the cyanophoric glucoside is hydrolysed by invertase is not in accordance with our observations , which show that a specific enzyme , not hitherto recognised as a constituent of yeast , is the active agent in separating the glucose : it will be convenient to speak of this enzyme as amygdalase .
Amygdalin is one of the few natural glucosides which give two molecules of glucose when hydrolysed , the other product being benzylidene cyanhydrol , which\#151 ; in dilute solution\#151 ; decomposes spontaneously into benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide .
There is reason to suppose that the two molecules of glucose are attached to one another\#151 ; that is to say , that amygdalin is derived from a biose.j* It was shown by Emil Fischer , in 1894 , } that an extract of dried Frohberg * Vol. 37 , pp. 45\#151 ; 51 .
t Evidence has already been adduced in favour of the view that this biose is not maltose ( Caldwell and Courtauld , 'Trans .

yeast ( a bottom yeast ) is capable of resolving the biose section of the molecule alone , a true glucoside and glucose being formed:\#151 ; C6H5CH(CN)O-C12H21Oi0 + H20 ^ C6H5CH(CN)0-C6Hu05 + C6Hi206 .
In his earlier paper , Fischer speaks of the action as due to " invertin , " but afterwards attributed the hydrolysis to the enzyme present in yeast which hydrolyses maltose .
Fischer 's investigation was carried out at a time when little was known of the specific character of the enzymes .
In the light of later work\#151 ; especially that of E. F. Armstrong\#151 ; it was improbable that maltase was the agent , emulsin ( although highly active towards amygdalin ) being without action on maltose and methyl-a-glucoside , which are both easily resolved by maltase .
Our experiments were instituted to clear up this discrepancy .
To prepare amygdonitrileglucoside , Fischer digested a mixture of amygdalin with yeast-extract at 35 ' .
On repeating the experiment in accordance with his directions , using a dried English brewer 's yeast , we were surprised to find that the action took place far less rapidly than Fischer 's description had led us to suppose it would ; on testing the efficiency of the yeast-extract with maltose it was found to be almost inactive : judging from the relative stability of amygdalin and maltose in presence of acids , it was to be expected that the maltose would have been more rapidly hydrolysed than the amygdalin .
On considering all the circumstances , it appeared that we had worked at a higher temperature ( 35 ' ) than that at which maltase exerts its maximum activity according to E. F. Armstrong 's observations .
The question arose whether the inactivity of the extract were not a consequence of overheating : comparative experiments were made , therefore , in which extracts prepared at different temperatures were digested , each at several temperatures , with solutions containing equivalent quantities of amygdalin , maltose and methyl-a-glucoside .
These led to the discovery that the action on amygdalin and also on methyl-a-glucoside persisted after heating the solutions to such a temperature that the action on maltose was at an end\#151 ; consequently , that maltase was not the active agent .
Similar experiments at higher temperatures afforded evidence that the enzyme which hydrolysed fl.mygda.lin could be destroyed without depriving the solution of its power of hydrolysing cane-sugar .
The proof was thus obtained of the existence of a specific enzyme capable of effecting the separation of glucose from amygdalin .
Whether or no this enzyme also hydrolyses methyl-a-glucoside or whether besides maltase two different enzymes are present in the extract , one of which attacks amygdalin , 2 d 2 352 Messrs. R. J. Caldwell and S. L. Courtauld .
[ May 9 , the other methyl-a-glucoside , cannot be decided at present : the discovery of an u-glucase different from maltase , however , is of considerable interest as an indication of the existence of separate a-glucosidoclasts .
It may be pointed out that the disproportion observed by E. E. Armstrong* in the relative rates at which maltose and methyl-a-glucoside are hydrolysed by maltase and acids respectively was perhaps in a measure due to the fact that the " maltase " contained the two enzymes which are capable of hydrolysing the glucoside , but only one capable of acting on the maltose .
Method follovjed.\#151 ; The experiments were carried out in small closed flasks , which were heated in a Hearson incubator ; excepting pipettes and funnels , all the vessels used were of hard Jena glass .
The top yeast used was a pale ale yeast , for which we were indebted to Mr. Julian Baker .
The freshly pressed yeast was first well washed with water saturated with toluene and without loss of time thoroughly drained on a vacuum filter ; it was then rapidly dried on bibulous paper , the drying being completed by exposure over sulphuric acid in vacuo .
Professor Emil Fischer had the kindness , at Dr. E. F. Armstrong 's request , to obtain for us a quantity of dried bottom yeast ( \amp ; Cerevisice , Race 12 , Berlin ) , which was ostensibly similar to that which he had used .
To prepare the extract , one part of dried yeast was added to 20 parts of water and a little toluene ; the mixture was then digested at the required temperature , being shaken at intervals ; it was finally clarified by filtration .
Usually , the liquor was in contact with the yeast during 4 to 6 hours , experiment having shown that nothing was gained by extending the period .
Solutions of the hydrolytes were prepared containing four-tenths of a gramme-molecular proportion per litre .
Equal volumes of the solution ( 20 c.c. ) and of the yeast extract , heated to the temperature at which hydrolysis was to be effected , were quickly mixed in a flask ; a sample of 10 c.c. was at once withdrawn and , the enzyme having been destroyed by the addition of a single drop of concentrated sulphuric acid ( or in the case of cane-sugar , a solution of caustic soda ) , 10 c.c. of a 10-per-cent , solution of sodic acetate was run in ; the liquid was then heated to 80 ' to precipitate the dissolved protein as far as possible .
Finally , the filtered solution was examined polarimetrically in a 20-mm .
tube at 25 ' .
Meanwhile , the main bulk of the mixture had been placed in the incubator , where it was kept at the required temperature ; at intervals , usually after 24 , 48 and 72 hours from the commencement of an experiment , 10-c.c .
samples were withdrawn , and treated as before described The amount of the substance hydrolysed was estimated by dividing the observed change in rotatory power by that calculated to correspond to * ' Roy .

[ May 9 , Maltose not Effective in Hydrolysing Amygdalin.\#151 ; The results recorded in Table I show that amygdalin is more readily hydrolysed at 35 ' than at 25 ' , at whichever temperature the extract be prepared .
In the case of maltose , the higher temperature is prejudicial , whether prevailing during the extraction or the hydrolysis .
Results are recorded in Table II of experiments in which the yeast was extracted both at lower ( 0 ' and 15 ' ) and at higher ( 45 ' and 55 ' ) temperatures than those before mentioned .
In the first place , it is obvious that 15 ' is a less effective temperature than 25 ' not only in the case of amygdalin but also in that of maltose , a smaller percentage being hydrolysed at the lower temperature .
But the extract prepared at 15 ' was the most active , 0 ' being apparently an altogether unfavourable temperature .
The results obtained with an extract prepared at 45 ' show that the activity towards maltose is almost non-existent whilst unimpaired towards amygdalin .
Extracts prepared at 15 ' and then heated to 45 ' show considerably reduced activity towards maltose .
Extracts prepared at 55 ' were destitute of activity towards the three glucosides .
The experiments made wTith bottom yeast ( Table III ) gave results which showed that this yeast was far less active towards amygdalin than the top Table III.\#151 ; Action of Extracts of Bottom Yeast ( / S ' .

yeast , although the two extracts were almost equally active in hydrolysing maltose .
The maltase in the bottom yeast appears to have been somewhat more resistant , a considerable proportion surviving in the extract which had been heated to 50 ' .
The extract prepared from this yeast at 25 ' was more active than that prepared at a higher or lower temperature , 15 ' being the most favourable temperature in the case of the English top yeast ; moreover , the hydrolysis of maltose was best effected by this yeast at 35 ' instead of at 25 ' .
Results similar to those recorded in Table III were obtained with another sample of yeast reported to be a bottom yeast grown in maize wort .
In view of the high temperature at which it exerts its maximum fermentative power , it appeared desirable to examine the remarkable yeast S. Thermantitonum described by Grove Johnson .
Mr. Johnson was good enough to give us some quantity of the yeast : unfortunately , the extract prepared from it was so highly coloured that satisfactory measurements could not be made with it .
The impression was gained that it resembled that prepared from the bottom yeast and that possibly amygdalin was not attacked by it .
Results are recorded in Tables IY and Y which finally led to the conclusion that maltase can be entirely destroyed by heating , whilst the extract retains its activity towards amygdalin almost unaltered .
Owing to the greater stability of the maltase in the case of the bottom yeast , it was necessary to heat the extract during a longer period ( three hours instead of one ) in order to render it inactive towards maltose .

Experiments which are recorded in Tables VI and YII were made to test this point directly .
The results show that the assumption made by Marino and Sericano before referred to cannot be accepted .
An extract which has been heated at 60 ' and is entirely without action on amygdalin and methyl-a-glucoside still preserves much of its activity towards cane-sugar .
Marino and Sericano removed the maltase from the mixture of enzymes derived from yeast by subjecting the extract to diffusion ; they overlooked the possibility that the less diffusible fraction\#151 ; which they proved to be free from maltase\#151 ; contained any other enzyme than invertase .
It may be mentioned as a point of interest that bottom yeast , although equally rich in maltase , appears to contain a far smaller proportion of both invertase and amygdalase than top yeast .
At the end of 24 hours only 2 7 per cent , of amygdalin and 91*5 of cane-sugar had been hydrolysed by an extract of bottom yeast as compared with 10'5 per cent , of amygdalin hydrolysed by an extract prepared under like conditions from top yeast , which also hydrolysed cane-sugar completely in the course of a much shorter period than 24 hours .
The extreme activity of top yeast towards cane-sugar is clearly indicated by the results given in Table VII .

The expression w acidified99 in the table is to be interpreted as meaning that acetic acid was added in the proportion of 0*001 gramme-molecule per litre of extract .
Hydrolysis of Methyl-ct-G-lucoside.\#151 ; It will be observed on reference to the tables , that methyl-a-glueoside is always more or less attacked so long as amygdalin is acted upon , but that a very marked diminution in activity towards this glucoside attends the disappearance of the maltase ( Tables IV and V ) .
The inference that the methyl-a-glucoside .
is attacked by the two enzymes maltase and " amygdalase " cannot well be disputed\#151 ; it is clearly necessary to assume that either an a-glucase exists together with amygdalase , 358 Messrs. R. J. Caldwell and S. L. Courtauld .
[ May 9 , or that one and the same enzyme ( amygdalase ) is concerned in the hydrolysis of both amygdalin and methyl-a-glucoside .
* It is noteworthy that after the maltase is destroyed there is a coincident variation in the amount of amygdalin and methyl-a-glucoside which undergo hydrolysis in the case of different yeasts ( Tables IY and Y ) .
Moreover , a yeast extract in which the maltase has been destroyed produces an effect on a mixture of methyl-a-glucoside and amygdalin markedly smaller than the sum of its effects on the two compounds taken separately ( Table YIII ) .
As there is competition for the enzyme when two substances are hydrolysed together { cf. Henri ) , f this result would also seem to show that a single enzyme is active .
It has been stated by Ter MeulenJ that only glucose retards the hydrolysis of amygdalin by emulsin and that maltose is without effect .
Apparently maltose is without effect on the hydrolysis of amygdalin by amygdalase ( Table YIII ) ; and in this respect galactose and lactose are also inert , whilst glucose has a marked inhibitory effect .
It is impossible at present to identify amygdalase with any known enzyme .
The enzyme is present in varying amounts in the different yeasts we have examined , and appears to be equally well extracted from the dried material at all temperatures from 15 ' to 45 ' .
Whereas a low temperature of extraction , 0 ' , affords a very small proportion of active amygdalase ( Table III ) , the quantity is increased by heating the extract for a short time at 45 ' ; a similar effec.t is produced by heating an extract prepared at 15 ' ( Table IY ) : that is to say , the amygdalase is originally dissolved as part of a more complex protein or zymogen molecule , which is hydrolysed at the higher temperatures .
Proof of its stability is afforded by the fact that it is contained in invertase prepared by O'Sullivan and Thompson 's method , which involves the autolysis of the yeast and precipitation of the enzyme by alcohol\#151 ; a process which entirely destroys maltase .
* Marino and Sericano speak of using 20 kilogrammes of yeast .
After this had been washed and dried , it was extracted with water ; the precipitate produced by adding alcohol to the extract was purified by dialysis .
Eventually they obtained only 2*5 grammes of dried substance .
They state definitely that their invertase was prepared by continuing the dialysis until methyl-a-glucoside was no longer affected .
However , they give no details of the experiments which proved this to be the case and it is noteworthy that amygdalin appears to have been but slowly hydrolysed by their material , even when this was used in large proportion .
