[ May 3 , is small , and it would be easy to detect the effect of the above proportion , or of less than one ten-thousand-millionth of a grain of chlorine in one-tenth of a cubic centimetre of distilled water by this process .
The same kind of action occurs with other electrolytes , but requires larger proportions of dissolved substance .
As the degree of sensitiveness of the method appears extreme , I add the following remarks The original solution of washed chlorine in distilled water was prepared in a dark place by the usual method from hydrochloric acid and manganic oxide , and was kept in an opaque , well-stoppered bottle in the dark .
The strength of this liquid was found by means of volumetric analysis with a standard solution of argentic nitrate in the usual manner , the accuracy of the silver solution being proved by means of a known weight of pure chloride of sodium .
The chlorine liquid contained 2 3 milligrammes , or 0-03565 grain of chlorine per cubic centimetre , and was just about three-fourths saturated .
One-tenth of a cubic centimetre of this solution ( " No. 1 " ) , or 0-003565 grain of chlorine was added to 9'9 c.c. of distilled water and mixed .
One cubic centimetre of this second liquid ( " No. 2 " ) , or 0-0003565 grain of chlorine was added to 99 c.c. of water and mixed ; the resulting liquid ( " No. 3 " ) contained 0-000003565 grain of chlorine per cubic centimetre .
To make the solution ( " No. 4 " ) for exciting the voltaic couple , successive portions of one-tenth or one-twentieth cubic centimetre of " No. 3 " liquid were added to 900 c.c. of distilled water and mixed .
I have employed the foregoing method for examining the states and degrees of combination of substances dissolved in electrolytes , and am also investigating its various relations .

" Electro-chemical Effects on Magnetising Iron .
Part II."* By Thomas Andrews , F.R.S.E. , F.C.S. Communicated by Professor Gl .
G. Stokes , P.R.S. Received April 9 , 1888 .
The novel electro-chemical effects observed between a magnetised and an unmagnetised bar when in circuit in certain solutions , recorded in the first part of this research , were of such an interesting character that I thought it desirable to extend the investigation .
The present memoir contains the results of a further study of these magnetochemical phenomena , which were found to be more marked and characteristic when experimenting with some of the reagents herein described .
The method of experimentation was generally similar to that pursued and described in Part I , though it was necessary to * For first part see vol. 42 , p. 459 .

153 introduce numerous modifications of detail and also some entirely new modes of experimentation hereafter referred to .
Fig. 3 shows the form of apparatus , coil of 750 wraps , \amp ; c. , used with the larger iron and steel bars .
In this apparatus the ends of each pair of bars were deeply immersed in the solution contained in the vessel D , below the coil ; liability to possible temperature errors from any heating of the coil was thus obviated .
The unmagnetised bar B was made shorter than the bar A in the coil , so as to avoid partial magnetisation from outside induction of the coil , which would have been more liable to occur had the bar stood in full length parallel with the coil .
This arrangement was found preferable when using large steel bars , as induced magnetism to any considerable extent of the bar B would have detracted from the full effect .
In some instances , however , this precaution was not adopted .
The apparatus , coil , \amp ; c. , used with the smaller iron and steel bars is shown in fig. 4 .
A single-cell bichromate battery was employed in connexion with the coil for magnetisation during all the experiments recorded in this memoir .

The bars were of specially prepared wrought iron and cast steel ; the smaller bars were 8-^ inches long , O'261 inch diameter , and the larger bars were f-inch diameter , the longer one ( A ) was 10J inches long , and the shorter one ( B ) 5^ inches long ; all the rods were finely polished .
The general physical properties of the metals are given in Mr. T. Andrews .
[ May 3 , Table B. The cast-steel bars were employed in some of the experiments , because after magnetisation in the coil their subsequent influence as permanent magnets of lower strength could be observed as referred to in course of this memoir .

The chemical reagents employed as electrolytes consisted of solutions of bromine , ferric chloride , and chlorine-water , ferrous sulphate , ferric chloride , cupric chloride , cupric sulphate , cupric nitrate , cupric acetate , cupric bromide , nickel chloride , hydrochloric acid , nitric acid , and potassium chlorate .
j In Ike experiments with the smaller rods a pair of bars in each experiment were immersed in the solution in the ( J-luke , in circuit also with a delicate galvanometer , and after a suitable time had elapsed in every case for normal galvanic equilibrium to obtain , the bar A in the coil was magnetised , and the magneto-chemical effect recorded .
It was found to vary with the nature of the metal and solution employed , and also with the extent of the magnetic saturation of the metals .
The strength of the magnetism was practically the same in many of the experiments , and it was generally observed that difference in the strength of the solutions affected the results .
In other experiments with a uniform strength of solution , but in which the magnetism of the metals was varied or reduced , the magnetochemical effect became proportionately altered .
The possibility of error from temperature causes arising from any slight internal heating of the coil has been referred to and dealt with in Part I ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 42 , pp. 462-3 ) .
The apparatus , fig. 3 , used in some of the present experiments was also conducive to accuracy in this respect .
Moreover , the early and extensive development of the magneto-chemical effect , noticed in most cases , especially in the 1888 .

experiments with bromine , HN03 , and the copper salts , affords sufficient indication that the liability to error from temperature causes was slight .
To demonstrate that the magneto-chemical effect was not in these observations due to variation of temperature consequent on possible heating of the coil , a further set of experiments ( Table C , Cols .
10 and 11 , Divisions II ) was made with solutions of ferrous sulphate and also of ferric chloride in another form of apparatus , wherein the unmagnetised bar h was surrounded by a slightly higher temperature ( about 5 ' to 10 ' F. ) during the observations than the magnetised bar A. This was accomplished by surrounding the limb of the ( J -tube containing the bar B , during the observation , with a specially constructed water-bath containing water at a temperature of about 5 ' to 10 ' P. above the temperature of the solution in the coil tube A , the difference of temperature was ascertained by small thermometers respectively placed in limbs A and B of the U-tialoe , another thermometer being in the water-bath .
The magnetised bar was , however , able to maintain its positive position , notwithstanding the higher temperature around the unmagnetised one .
The present memoir contains the results of many repeated experiments , each record in the tables being the average of a considerable number of observations .
In Parts I and II a total of about 592 iron and steel bars have been experimented upon , 846 bars being required for the experiments of Part II .

of water .
This solution was very energetic in its action on the metals , and considerable care was required in conducting the experiments therewith ; but with due precautions admirable results were obtained .
The magneto-chemical effect was very great with this reagent , the E.M.F. between the magnetised and unmagnetised bars sometimes reaching as high as one-twentieth of a volt .
The highest E.M.P. appeared to be manifested at or near the time of the energetic effervescing attack on the metal ; though the E.M.F. between the bars was always considerable from the earliest commencement of the magnetisation of bar A in the coil .
Experiments were made on both wrought-iron and steel bars .
The experiments , Col. 3 , Divisions I and II , were made with a much weaker bromine solution , though of similar general composition .

1888.1 Electro-chemical Effects on Magnetising Iron .
161 Ferric Chloride and Chlorine Water , Col. 4 , Divisions I and II.\#151 ; This solution consisted of 250 fluid grains of a concentrated solution of Fe2Cl3 and 750 fluid grains of saturated chlorine water .
In these experiments the electro-negative position assumed by the magnetised bar formed an exception to the general rule , which , I think , may probably to some extent be explained on the supposition of the diamagnetic properties of the dissolved chlorine ; the magnetised bar being somewhat less attacked by the free chlorine than the unmagnetised rod .
When the chlorine had exhausted its action on the metal , the electro-chemical reaction became gradually reversed , and the magnetised bar then assumed the electro-positive position ( see Col. 4 , Division II ) , as in the case of normal ferric chloride solution only .
To show that the above negative effect was due only to magnetic influence , various experiments with Fe2Cl3 and chlorine water were made , in which it was found that on ceasing to magnetise the bar A for a few moments , the B.M.F. decreased , and the magnetised bar A assumed a less negative position , but on again connecting the battery to the coil , the magnetised bar therein assumed a more electro-negative position .

On ceasing to magnetise the bar A , in course of any of these experiments , the needle of the galvanometer fell to zero , and on remagnetising the bar A its electro-positive position was re-asserted .
Ferrous Sulphate , Col. 10 , Divisions I , II , III , and IV , a saturated solution of the salt .
Division I.\#151 ; This set of experiments was conducted on the large polished wrought-iron bars , f-inch diameter , with apparatus fig. 3 , the magnetisation of bar A being continuous to the end of each observation .
Division II.\#151 ; These experiments were made with small iron bars in apparatus , fig. 4 , the solution containing the unmagnetised bar being maintained at a temperature of about 5 ' to 10 ' F. above the temperature of the solution in which the magnetised bar was immersed .
Division III.\#151 ; In these observations large steel bars f-inch diameter were employed in the arrangement of apparatus delineated in fig. 3 .
The bar A in the coil was magnetised for a few minutes only at the commencement , and , as the metal was steel , it retained a permanent residual magnetism , which was allowed to complete the result .
The magneto-chemical effect was not so great in these instances , owing to the magnetism of the bar being less than when the action of the powerful coil was prolonged thereon , as in the other experiments Mr. T. Andrews .
[ May 3 , This class of observations indicated that the results were influenced by the extent to which the metal was magnetised ; the latter fact was more distinctly shown in course of experiments with bromine and the salts of copper .
Division IV.\#151 ; These experiments were made on the small steel bars with apparatus , fig. 4 ; the general results were similar to those obtained with the larger bars , though somewhat less in extent .
The bar A in the coil was magnetised for a short time only at the com-mencement , and the induced permanent magnetism allowed to complete the result .
Ferric Chloride , Col. 11 , Divisions II and III , was a saturated solu- tion of the salt in water .
The experiments in Division I were made in apparatus , fig. 4 , equality of temperature obtaining between the two limbs of the -tube .
The observations of Division II were made in the water-bath apparatus previously alluded to , with a difference of temperature of about 5 ' to 10 ' F. in favour of the unmagnetised bar ; the magnetic influence was , however , sufficient to overcome this temperature obstacle , and even under such conditions the magnetised bar maintained its electro-chemical position , though not to the full extent .
On ceasing to magnetise a bar in the above reagent , the E.M.F. steadily diminished , and on again applying magnetisation the magnetised bar resumed its positivity .
The observations in Division III were made on pairs of the small steel bars under equal temperature conditions .
At the end of forty hours there was a perceptibly greater deposit of flocculent oxide of iron in the tube containing the magnetised bar .
Cupric Chloride , Col. 12 , Divisions I and II , consisted of a concentrated solution of the salt in water , such as is usually employed in dissolving out the metallic iron in the carbon determination of iron analyses .
The magneto-chemical effect with this reagent was of considerable magnitude , a powerful effect commencing from first magnetisation of the bar A , and largely though steadily increasing .
On ceasing to magnetise the bar A the galvanometer deflections were reduced ; but on again bringing the magnetising coil into action , the magnetised bar A steadily re-asserted its strong positive position in course of a few moments .
These magnetic effects were not of such a nature as to produce a very violent fling of the galvanometer , but manifested a steady and permanent character , though in most instances deflections commenced at once on magnetising the bar ' A , and afterwards Continued steadily to increase till the maximum point was reached .
On the Completion of an experiment , both bars were Of course covered with electro-deposited metallic hopper ; but in many instances the colour of the solution in the ' limb of the [ J -tube which had contained the magnetised bar , was of a rather lighter tint , showing that a some-urhat greater deposition of " copper had occurred therein .

163 ments in Division I were with pairs of the small wrought-iron bars , and the observations in Division II were made on pairs of the small steel bars .
It will be noticed that the E.M.F. was greater in the case of the wrought-iron than with the steel bars .
Cupric Sulphate , Col. 13 , Divisions I and II , a concentrated solution of the salt in water .
The remarks made on the magneto-chemical effects with cupric chloride apply generally to the reactions obtained with cupric sulphate ; it will be noticed , however , that the effect was more extensive when employing the latter salt .
Cupric Nitrate , Col. 14 , was composed of a saturated solution of the salt in water .
The magneto-chemical effect was observed with this reagent , though it was more limited in extent than when using either CuCl , CuBr , or CuS04 .
Cupric Acetate , Col. 15 , Divisions I and II.\#151 ; This was a concentrated solution of the salt in which the effect was small ; but it was distinctly noticeable .
Cupric Bromide , Col. 16 , consisted of a saturated solution of the salt in water .
Highly interesting and very marked results were noticed in the experiments with this reagent .
The observations in Divisions I and II were made with small rods of wrought iron and steel in apparatus , fig. 4 , the results recorded in Divisions III and IV being obtained with large iron and steel bars f-inch diameter , and using apparatus , fig. 3 .
A weaker solution of " cupric bromide was employed for the iron bar experiments in Division III , and the bars were not immersed so deeply in the solution .
The electro-positive position of the coil-bar A was dependent on the extent of its magnetisation , in these as in the other experiments , and the effects with cupric bromide were generally similar to those obtained with cupric chloride .
Nickel Chloride , Col. 17 , Divisions I and II , was a concentrated solution of the salt in water .
Sulphate of Iron.\#151 ; A pair of steel bars were left in a yellow oxidised solution of sulphate of iron in apparatus , fig. 4 , for twenty-four hours , the bar A having been magnetised for a short time at commencement only , the residual magnetism being allowed to complete the effect ; an E.M.F. of 0 011 volt was gradually reached , the magnet bar being in the positive position .
The Electro-chemical Effect as between the Magnetic Polar Terminals - and Equator .
In casting about for an explanation of these magneto-chemical phenomena , it seemed probable that the effect might possibly be connected with the local currents which are shown below to develop in a magnetised bar between the more highly ' and less magnetised parts thereof , when the rod was immersed in suitable solutions acting VOL. XLIV .
N Mr. T. Andrews .
[ May 3 , chemically upon it .
I therefore made the following experiments which demonstrate the interesting fact , that when a magnetised bar is thns immersed a local galvanic current is set up between the polar terminals and central equator or less magnetised portion of the barr the more magnetically-neutral zones acting electro-negatively in relation to the poles .
Under these induced conditions it becomes obvious that a magnetised bar , forming one element of a galvanic couple , would be more acted upon than an unmagnetised one , forming the other element in the same solution .
Hence , one explanation is afforded of the electro-chemical positive position generally manifested by the magnetised bar in course of the research .
The experimental demonstration of these local currents in a magnetised rod was conducted as follows:\#151 ; A pair of polished soft-iron bars , inches long , 0261 inch diameter , cut adjacently from a larger rod , were each covered with black india-rubber tubing , a small portion , one quarter of an inch at each end of one bar ( the flat disk at the end being coated with black varnish ) and half an inch in the centre of the other rod , being the only portions exposed , and an equality of surface exposure being thus obtained .
The two rods were placed in the tube containing the solution , and were connected in circuit with the galvanometer .
The tube containing them was placed in the coil , and on magnetising the rods by means thereof , the rod whose polar terminals were exposed to the action of the solution became electro-positive to the other bar .
Similar results were obtained when either a north pole or a south pole was exposed singly as one element in connexion with a central equator as the other .
Many repeated experiments were made with apparatus shown on fig. 5 , and about forty-six india-rubber-eoVered bars were used in this part of the investigation .
The results are given in Table D ( p. 166 ) .
Nitric Acid and Potassium Bichro , Col. 3.\#151 ; On ceasing to magnetise the bar A in course of any experiment the galvanometer deflections almost immediately fell to zero , and on again magnetising the bar A deflections went up , the polar terminals resuming their positive position .
In this experiment the central equator had an exposed surface of ^ inch and each polar terminal inch ; another experiment was made in which the exposed part of the central equator was only ^ inch and each polar terminal ^ inch ; the results were the same though of less extent .
Similar results were obtained on ceasing at any time to magnetise the bars in the cupric chloride solutions , Cols .

5 and 6.\#151 ; On ceasing to magnetise , galvanometer deflections fell some degrees , but rose again on re-magnetising .
During an investigation of the possible electro-chemical effect between the polished end disks or polar terminals only , of straight round steel magnets , there were indications , under certain conditions and when the magnets were immersed as elements in some electrolytes , of a tendency on the part of the N. terminal plane of the magnet to become from some cause electro-positive to the S. terminal plane , when the magnets were placed parallel some distance apart in an upright position .
The lower end of each magnet exposed in the solution was covered with black india-rubber tubing , so that the flat polished disks at the terminals only were exposed to the action of the electrolyte .
This apparent tendency seemed somewhat singular , and farther experimentation is required before arriving at definite conclusions ; it seemed desirable however to allude to this apparent indication .
I hope to make other observations in this direction , and in course of these to utilise some valuable experimental suggestions which Professor Stokes has kindly made .

] Electro-chemical Effects on Magnetising Iron , The Electro-chemical Effect in Relation to the Passive State of Iron .
Soon after commencing Part I of this research I conceived that the passive state of iron in strong nitric acid would either to some extent be affected , or perhaps overcome , by magnetic influences of a similar nature to those in the experiments on which I am engaged .
Preliminary experiments were made and interesting results obtained in connexion with the influence of magnetisation on the action of strong nitric acid on iron and steel .
I have obtained , under certain conditions , currents flowing from a magnetised bar to an unmagnetised one in strong nitric acid ( sp. gr. 1'42 ) .
The currents representing an E.M.F. varying , according to circumstances , from about 0 011 volt and upwards .
After considerable experimentation I feel convinced that induced local currents of the nature of those shown above in Table D were instrumental in causing the magnetised bars to be more acted upon than the unmagnetised ones in the strong nitric acid ( sp. gr. 1'42 ) , and such currents are essential in reducing the passivity of iron in nitric acid .
I hope to have further communications to make with respect to this interesting part of my research .
In Parts I and II of this research , the results of a quantitative study of these magneto-chemical phenomena have been recorded , the effect in connexion with a considerable variety of typical reagents having been carefully observed .
With some reagents the effect was found to be comparatively small , in other instances it was very considerable , as in the case of bromine , many of the salts of copper , nitric acid , and similar strong corrosive solutions .
The result was dependent both on the strength of the solution and on the extent of the magnetisation of the metal .
In most cases with powerfully oxidising reagents the effect was of an electro-positive nature , but in a few other instances ( such as H2S04 , HC1 dil .
, Fe2Cl3 with chlorine ) the reaction partook of a negative character in relation to the electro-chemical position of the magnetised bar .
It is not easy to account for these variations in the nature of the effect ; I think , however , it may be surmised that in these exceptional instances the results were possibly to some extent influenced by the diamagnetic properties of some of the solutions , or of the gases evolved therein .
In some of the compound solutions , such as Fe2Cl3 and chlorine water , a species of magnetic selection apparently occurred .
In the experiments witfi Fe2Cl3 solution without chlorine , the magnetised bar was electro-positive ; but when using this reagent combined with chlorine water ( see Table C , Col. 4 , Divisions I and II ) , the magnetised bar became electro-negative , possibly owing to the diamagnetic property of the free chlorine influencing its action on the magnetised bar .
When , however , the free chlorine had exhausted its direct action on 168 Prof. C. Pritchard .
On Capacities of two [ May 3 , the metal , there remained only a solution of Fe2Cl3 , in which the mag-netised bar A gradually assumed its normal electro-positive position ; this reaction is exemplified by the results in Table C , Col. 4 , Division II .
The comparative non-activity of HC1 on magnetised bars is very singular , and at present unaccountable .
In conclusion , I may state that this research bas shown that a current flows from a magnetised bar towards an unmagnetised one , when the two ai*e immersed in suitable solutions , and that the result was dependent both on the nature and strength of the solution , and also on the extent of the magnetisation of the metal .
It has also been demonstrated that when a magnetised rod constitutes one element in a suitable electrolyte acting upon it , local currents flow from the more highly magnetised polar terminals towards the less magnetised or neutral equatorial portions .
These conditions would cause the magnetised rod to be more generally acted upon by the electrolyte , the composition of the solution surrounding it being thereby also affected , and to a considerable extent this might account for its electro-positive position compared with the unmagnetised rod , otherwise under the same conditions .
Observations have also been made on the influence of magnetisation in relation to the passive state of iron in nitric acid , with interesting results .
In the present state of the inquiry it is preferable to confine oneself to a simple record of facts ; I think , however , it has been clearly demonstrated in course of the numerous and varied experiments of this research , that the magnetisation of iron and steel influences the action of reagents upon the metal .

Received April 18 , 1888 .
In May of last year , I was requested by a Committee on stellar photography , appointed by the Council of the Royal Society , to examine the comparative photographic capacities of two silver on glass mirrors , each having an aperture of 15 inches , but of different focal lengths , viz. , 80 inches and 120 inches respectively .
In the present report these will be designated by the symbols ^-inch and y^o-inch .
The mirrors in question were provided by the generosity of Dr. Warren de la Rue .
