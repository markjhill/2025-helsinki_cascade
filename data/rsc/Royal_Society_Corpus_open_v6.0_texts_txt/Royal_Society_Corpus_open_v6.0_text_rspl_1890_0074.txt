In Part I of this research ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 48 , p. 116 ) , the author showed the influence of magnetisation on the passive state of iron and steel , and he has now the pleasure of communicating to the Royal Society the results of a further study of certain temperature and other conditions affeeting the passivity of these metals in concentrated nitric acid .
The experiments of Series III , in this paper , relate to the effect of temperature , and the observations of Series IV refer to the influence exerted by nitric acids , of varied concentration , on the passive condition of iron and steel .
Series III .
Effect of Temperature on the Passivity of Iron and Steel .
The bars selected for these observations were unmagnetised polished rods , which had been previously drawn cold through a wortle ; a pair of bars of each metal were cut adjacently from one longer bar , and then placed securely in the wooden stand , W ; each bar was 81 inches ong , 61 diameter .
The U -tube containing 1\#163 ; fluid oz. of nitric aci , sp. gr. 42 , was rigidly placed in an arrangement as shown on 7 ' , .
Onelimb , A , was surrounded by a tank containing water , the o her limb , B , by a tank of the same capacity , containing powdered ice ; the arrangement was such that the water-tank could be heated by a 1891 .

Bunsen burner , and its temperature slowly raised , whilst the ice-tank was kept full of powdered ice .
A non-conductor of wood was put between the ends of the two tanks so as to prevent the melting of the ice ; the bottom or bent portion of the JJ-tube was also enclosed in a thick non-conductor of wood .
A thermometer , T , was placed in the water-tank .
The bars were in circuit with the galvanometer , and soon after immersing them in the nitric acid heat was applied to the water-tank , and the temperature of the nitric acid in that limb of the ( J -tube slowly raised to the temperatures required , whilst the acid in the other limb of the -tube was meanwhile maintained at a temperature of 32 ' F. The arrangement will be understood on reference to fig. 3 , and the electro-chemical results obtained are graphically recorded on* Diagram I. Fio .

[ Jan. 22 , Diagbam I , Current between two bright " passive 99 bars of the same composition , one in warm , the other in cold , nitric acid sp. gr. 1*42 .
The electro-chemical position of the bar in the warm nitric acid was positive .
Difference of temperature between the nitric acid in Tubes A and B , see Fig. 3 , in degrees Fahrenheit .
Curve A gives the E.M.F between two wrought iron bars , and Curve B gives *the E.M.F. between two cast steel bars under the conditions recorded .
The above experiments indicate that the wrought iron was less passive in the warm nitric acid than the soft cast steel ; the average E.M.F. of 94 observations with wrought iron was 0*030 volt $ whereas , in the case of the 94 observations on oast steel , the average E.M.F. was only 0*010 volt .
It will be seen from the above diagram that the behaviour of the steel , under the .conditions stated , was more irregular than that of the wrought iron .
In the whole of the above series of experiments on Diagram I the nitric acid was raised to a temperature of 175 ' F. ; the cold nitric acid in the limb of the IJ'f^be A remained perfectly colourless , and the steel or iron therein absolutely passive ; but the steel or iron in the warm nitric acid in tube A commenced to be gradually acted upon as the temperature increased , a pale yellow tint beginning to appear in 1891 .

the solution in the tube A shortly after commencement .
When the temperature of about 170 ' to 175 ' F. was reached a faint evolution of gas in the form of bubbles was manifest , adhering to the steel , in the warm tube only .
No powerful solvent action or violent evolution of nitric oxide gas , however , occurred in any of these experiments even up to the temperature of 175 ' F. , and these experiments were not continued beyond this temperature .
These results show that iron or steel does not fully lose its passivity up to a temperature even of 175 ' F. , though the passivity is shown to have been considerably modified by temperature only .
The critical point of temperature of transition from the passive to the active state is therefore higher than 175 ' F. , and is shown in the experiments of Part I , Series II , Table II , to have been about 195 ' F. Semes IV .
The Passivity of Iron and various Steels increases with the Concentration of the Nitric Acid .
Schonbein considered that , " by immersing an iron wire in nitric acid 1*50 sp. gr. , it became likewise indifferent to the same acid of 1*35 sp. gr. , " and to all outward appearance this is so .
Scheurer-Kestner considered that the passivity of iron was not dependent on the greater or less degree of saturation of the acid .
The author , however , ascertained by the delicate electro-chemical mode of experimentation employed , and hereafter referred to , that the passivity is materially influenced according to the concentration of the nitric acid .
The following experiments indicate that the property of passivity m iron is not absolutely fixed or static , but that its passivity is modified to a certain extent in relation to the strength of the nitric acid used .
The general modus operandi was generally similar to that previously employed .
Pairs of unmagnetised polished steel bars 6 inches ong , and 0 310 inch diameter , each pair being of the same kind of steel , and cut adjacently from one longer bar , were placed as before m t e wooden frame W , fig. 4 , and then instantly and simultaneously immerse in nitric acids , of two different degrees of concentration , con am m the -tube arrangement , one limb of the U-tube con-aming re fuming nitric acid of sp. gr. 1*50 , the other containing ni ric a , ci of sp. gr. 1 42 , circuit being made through the galvano-me er in t e usual manner .
The results , the average of repeated experiments in each case , are given on Table III , and show that the passivi y o iron increases considerably with the strength of the nitric VOL. xlix .

The steel rods selected for this set of experiments were of the kinds given on Table IV ; they were drawn cold through a wortle , and were I of the general physical properties and chemical composition given on ; Tables IV and Y. The reduction of E.M.P. towards the close was probably owing to partial diffusion between the two acids of different concentration .
The above results show that wrought iron was less passive in the weaker acid than most of the steels , the soft Bessemer steel being found similar in passivity to the wrought iron , The average E.M.P. was as follows:\#151 ; With wrought iron , Q'054 volt ; soft cast steel , 0028 volt ; hard cast steel , 0'036 volt ; soft Bessemer steel , 0-059 volt ; tungsten steel , 0'039 volt .
