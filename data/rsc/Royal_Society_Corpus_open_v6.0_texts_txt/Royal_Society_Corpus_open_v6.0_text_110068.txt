Further Particulars of a Case of Pneumato-thorax .
By John Davy , M.D. F.R.S. Read March 4 , 1824 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1824 , p. 257 .
] About a month after the operation described in Dr. Davy 's former paper , when the patient appeared to be doing well , symptoms of hydrothorax came on , and fluid again collected in the left side of the chest .
A second operation therefore was performed , and fourteen ounces of fluid discharged through a perforation in the fifth rib .
During the six following weeks not less than twenty pints of fluid ran off through the opening ; at first it was transparent , but became gradually more and more purulent , and was mixed with air composed of oxygen , azote and carbonic acid , in various proportions .
The patient 's health improved at first progressively , but in about six weeks after the operation he became worse , and expired suddenly .
On examination after death , about six ounces of pus were found in the left pleura .
The right pleura was healthy , but tubercles and vomicae were found in the right lung ; the left lung was much condensed , and communicated by two small openings with the pleura .
Dr. Davy refers the origin of the disease in this case to a communication between the aspera arteria and cavity of the pleura , established by the rupture of a superficial bronchial tube , and the membrane covering it ; and concludes the paper with some remarks upon the fluctuating composition of the air from the chest , which he attributes not to the varying quantity of atmospheric air , admitted through the perforation , which was as carefully closed as possible , but to its vitiation by respiration , and by the absorbent power of the pleura .
