) In a paper published in the ' Philosophical Magazine , '* the writer has described some experiments carried out with the secondary 7-rays emitted by various substances exposed to the primary 7-rays of radium .
It was found that the secondary rays are , on the whole , softer than the primary ; thus , for example , the coefficient of absorption of lead for the secondary rays from zinc was found to be about six times that obtained for the primary rays .
It was thought , therefore , that the ionisation of gases by secondary 7-rays would probably differ in many features from that obtained with the primary rays .
A set of measurements on the ionisation produced in various gases by secondary 7-rays was accordingly undertaken .
No experiments , as far as the writer is aware , have yet been made on this subject .

359 grammes of radium bromide .
The chamber A was approximately screened from the radium by the lead block C , 5'5 cm .
thick .
The 7-radiation from the radium fell in part on the radiator D , which consequently became a source of secondary 7-rays .
Some of the secondary rays traversed the chamber A , ionising the gas it contained .
The radiator D was held in position by means of an arrangement shown in fig. 2 .
It consisted of three fixed blocks of wood provided with slits , whose width was slightly greater than the thickness of the radiator .
The radiator was held to one of the sides of each slit by means of a wedge .
The radiator therefore always occupied its previous position if removed and again replaced .
The chamber A and the glass flask E , which were connected with one another by a rubber tube , could be exhausted to a pressure of about 0'5 cm .
of mercury by means of a Fleuss pump .
The pressure in the chambers was indicated by a mercury pressure gauge F. The part a , b , c , d of the apparatus was used to introduce the vapour of a liquid into the chamber .
This was done by first closing the tap b and opening the tap a , and exhausting the chamber down to as low a pressure as it was possible to obtain with the pump , and then closing the tap e. Some of the liquid to be used was then poured into the funnel d , and by opening the tap b part of the liquid was allowed to run into the bulb c. Evaporation of the liquid into the chamber then took place , and was allowed to go on until some convenient pressure of the vapour was reached , the tap a being then closed .
The residual air in the chamber A ( which could not be removed by the pump ) was swept by the vapour into the chamber E. G- is an ionisation chamber in which the air was ionised by a layer of uranium oxide .
The electrode of this chamber was connected with that of the chamber A , and its leak used to compensate in part for that in the latter chamber , by keeping the chambers at potentials of opposite sign .
The apparent leak was kept by means of this arrangement down to a workable amount .
The chamber A was connected to a positive potential of 200 volts , while the chamber G was connected to a negative potential of 200 volts .
The ionisation per second due to the secondary 7-rays from the radiator D was obtained by measuring the leak with and without the radiator , the difference between the leaks giving the ionisation in the chamber A due to the secondary 7-rays .
The leak per second was in each case obtained by observing the time it took to obtain approximately a given convenient Fig. 2 .

The Ionisation in [ Apr. 3 deflection of the electrometer needle , the current being then broken and the first and second swing of the needle read .
The position of rest of the needle was then calculated by a simple formula given by the writer.* By using approximately equal deflections , the error due to change of capacity of the electrometer with the deflection of needle was avoided .
Moreover , the loss of leak due to leakage over insulation , etc. , was eliminated in this case when the difference between the leaks with and without the radiator was taken ; t this loss was , however , comparatively small in these experiments .
Ionisation and Pressure .
The ionisations in different gases can only be compared with one another if the ionisation in each case is proportional to the pressure , the ionisation being then proportional to the intensity of the ionising agent .
This is realised if only a small fraction of the energy of the ionising agent is absorbed by the gas , for then the ionisation is proportional to the mass of the gas , and consequently proportional to the pressure .
It has been shown by several observers that the ionisation in a gas by the .y-rays of radium and the / 3-rays of uranium is in each case proportional to the pressure up to pressures greater than those necessary to determine the ionisation with accuracy.{ Since the penetrating power of the secondary 7-rays is greater than that of the / 3-rays , and the percentage absorption therefore smaller in the former than in the latter case , this should also be true for the former rays .
It was thought better , however , to make some experiments to test this point , since it was not known to what extent the radiation from the walls of the vessel affected the ionisation .
The gases used in these experiments were air and ethyl bromide .
The ionisations obtained with different pressures are plotted against the pressures in fig. 3 .
It will be seen that two approximately straight lines are obtained which pass through the origin .
The ionisation is therefore proportional to the pressure between the limits of pressure used .
The density of the ethyl bromide vapour for the largest pressure used was greater than the density of any of the gases in the determination of the ionisations , and therefore the fraction of the energy of the ionising agent absorbed was greater than it was in any case in the latter experiments .
It was therefore thought unnecessary to make any further experiments with different gases in order to show that the ionisation varied as the pressure in each case .

Nature and Causes of Ionisation in the Chamber .
The ionisation in the chamber was partly caused by the penetrating cathode radiation given off by the walls of the chamber under the action of the 7-rays .
This is .
objectionable ; but it seemed unavoidable .
The method that has been used in the case of X-rays in confining the beam of rays to the centre of the chamber so that it touches the walls only where it enters and leaves did not appear practicable in this case .
And this for two reasons : firstly , it is impossible to obtain a well-defined beam of 7-rays by means of a metal stop , on account of the great penetrating power of the rays , and also on account of the necessarily large surface of the aperture becoming a source of secondary 7-radiation ; * secondly , the gas itself , under the influence of the 7-rays , gives off penetrating cathode rays which would cross the screened part of the chamber , and thus produce secondary radiation from its walls .
A correction would therefore have to be applied as to the magnitude of which nothing would be known , so that nothing would be gained by using such an arrangement .
It was therefore thought better to use the simpler though somewhat undesirable form of apparatus described .
The ionisation in a chamber of the form used may consist of three parts .
One part may consist of ions ejected by the 7-rays from the gas molecules with a velocity which is so small that they are unable to produce any further ions themselves .
One of the other parts we know consists of ions made by the secondary cathode rays from the walls of the chamber , and the third part of ions made by the cathode rays of high velocity ejected from the gas molecules .
The first of these parts is proportional to the mass of the gas and therefore proportional to the pressure , and this is also true for * This secondary radiation further complicates matters on account of its nature not being the same as that of the primary ; the larger part produced would enter the chamber because it is initially projected in the direction of the exciting rays .

Ionisation in [ Apr. 3 , the second part , since the ionisation of a gas by / 3-rays has been shown to be proportional to the pressure .
Since the number of electrons ejected from the gas is proportional to the pressure , and the number of ions each produces proportional to the pressure , the third part is proportional to the square of the pressure .
The ionisation in the chamber may , therefore , be written ( A + B ) p + Gp2 , where p denotes the pressure .
Laby and Kaye* have shown that the ionisation in air and carbon dioxide is proportional to the pressure over a wide range of pressures .
The term Op2 is , therefore , small within this range .
Experiments on the variation of the ionisation with pressure will , however , not give any information as to the relative values of A and B , since both the ionisation produced by the secondary cathode radiation from the walls of the chamber and that due to the ejection of slow-moving ions from the molecules of the gas by the 7-rays vary as the pressure .
Attempts have been made to obtain an estimate of the amount of ionisation in a chamber which is not due to the radiation from the walls .
All these estimates depend on some calculations based on certain assumptions , generally involving the absorption of the cathode rays produced by the 7-rays .
Now the 7-rays produce cathode rays whose penetrating powers vary very considerably , and these calculations are therefore not satisfactory ; they may easily be very considerably out .
In fact , McLennanf deduced that the ionisation in a chamber not due to the secondary radiation from the walls is equal to about one-half of the total ionisation in the chamber , while WilsonJ makes it equal to one-sixth of the total ionisation ; it does not appear certain , therefore , that the total ionisation is not due entirely to the secondary radiation from the walls .
The writer , therefore , made some direct experiments to test this point .
Several slightly different arrangements were used , each of which involved the deflection of the secondary radiation from the apparatus by means of a magnetic field .
A diagram of the apparatus first used is shown in fig. 4 .
A is an ionisation chamber on a lead block B , 5 cm .
thick , the chamber being placed symmetrically with respect to an aperture a in the block .
Thirty milligrammes of radium were placed at C underneath the aperture .
A magnet , whose poles measured 5*5 cm .
by 5*5 cm .
, was placed so that the chamber was between its poles .
Since the electrons produced by 7-rays are ejected in the direction of propagation of the rays , there was a diffuse pencil of / 3-rays projected into the chamber from its lower side .
If the ionisation is produced by the / 3-rays from the walls of the chamber , the * ' Phil. Mag. , ' p. 879 , December , 1908 .

] Various Gases by Secondary 363 ionisation ought to be principally due to this beam , and should therefore decrease considerably when a strong magnetic field is applied .
It was found , however , that a magnetic field produces little change in the amount of ionisation .
Thus , in a particular case , the ionisation in a sheet lead chamber 5-5 cm .
high , 5*5 cm .
broad , and 7*5 cm .
long , was 1895 in arbitrary units .
When a field of over 2000 units was applied , which was sufficient to bend the rays having the same velocity as the penetrating / 3-rays from radium into a circle of radius less than 8 mm. , the ionisation current decreased to 1645 , or about 12 per cent. When a chamber 7 cm .
high , 4 cm .
long , and 3 cm .
deep was used , the current was decreased from 1560 to 1475 when the magnetic field was applied , or about 6 per cent. If all the ionisation in the gas was produced by the / 3-rays from the walls of the chambers , the Fig. 5 .
Fig. 4 .
ionisation should have decreased to a greater extent in each case , although a part of the path of each ray when deflected was still contained by the chamber , and consequently produced ionisation .
Since part of the leak in this experiment was always due to the / 3-rays from the walls of the ionisation chamber , it was thought desirable to carry out the experiment in a somewhat different form .
Fig. 5 gives a diagram of the apparatus used .
A is a cylindrical ionisation chamber , 19 cm .
long and 8 cm .
in diameter , to which the tube 6 5 cm .
long and 3'5 cm .
in diameter , was co-axially attached .
The chamber was placed so that the tube ah was between the poles of an electro-magnet .
The end a of the tube was closed in one set of measurements by a sheet of thin aluminium leaf equivalent in mass to a layer of air 0*7 cm .
thick , the end b of the tube being closed with a metal plate c. The end d of the chamber A was closed with a thin sheet of zinc .
B is a lead block , 3 cm .
thick , through which a circular hole e was drilled about 1 cm .
in diameter .

Ionisation in [ Apr. 3 , glass tube c containing 30 milligrammes of radium ( which was surrounded by sheet lead 2 mm. thick ) were placed co-axially with the tube ah and the ionisation chamber A. The ionisation in the chamber was produced principally in the cone f by the 7-rays from the radium and the secondary / 8-rays from the pi ate .
c , the secondary / 8-rays being initially projected in the direction of propagation of the 7-rays.* The secondary / 8-rays produced in a plate are to some extent scattered by the plate , but the larger part of the radiation proceeds approximately in the direction of propagation of the 7-ray s , f and the larger part of the radiation from the plate c therefore entered the chamber .
The measurements were carried out by first placing a lead plug into the hole e of the lead block B and measuring the leak in the chamber .
This gave the leak in the chamber due to imperfect screening of the lead block B. The leak was then measured with the plug removed .
The difference between this leak and the former gave the ionisation in the cone f due directly to the 7-rays and the secondary / 8-rays from the plate c. A magnetic field of sufficient strength to bend the / 8-rays from c so that they did not enter the chamber A was then applied , and the leak again measured .
The difference between this leak and the first gave the leak in the cone approximately due to the direct action of the 7-rays .
Whether the strength of the magnetic field was sufficient to bend the ^8-rays from the plate c so that they do not enter the chamber A was tested as follows .
The plate c and the lead sheeting surrounding the radium was removed so that a pencil of / 8-rays froth the radium now penetrated into the chamber .
When the current used in these experiments was switched on to the magnet , the ionisation was decreased to about 20 per cent , of its original amount , showing that practically all the / 8-rays were prevented from entering the chamber by the magnetic field .
Firstly , some measurements were made with no aluminium leaf placed at a. It was found that using a lead plate at mm. thick , the ionisation in the cone f decreased 15 per cent , when the current was switched on to the magnet ; when the plate was of aluminium 3 mm. thick the decrease was 23 per cent. An aluminium leaf was then placed at a , the ionisation in the tube ab being now excluded from the leak .
The decrease obtained with the lead radiator when the magnetic field was applied was 23 per cent. , and 31 per cent , with the aluminium radiator .

1909.[ is eliminated , there still remains a large proportion of the total leak , and a considerable part of the ionisation in the cone f is therefore due to the direct action of the 7-rays on the gas .
Some further measurements were carried out with a slight modification of the foregoing experiment .
A diagram of the modified apparatus is shown in fig. 6 .
A is an ionisation chamber 10*5 cm .
long , 104 cm .
broad , and 7 cm .
deep , of which the upper and lower side consisted of thin , tightly stretched tissue paper , equivalent in mass to a layer of air 1 cm .
thick .
The chamber was placed on the poles Bi and B2 of an electro-magnet , which were resting on a lead block C , 5 cm .
thick .
This lead block had an aperture a , 3 cm .
by 3 2 cm .
, which was placed in a symmetrical position with respect to the poles of the electro-magnet and the ionisation chamber .
D is the tube .containing the radium , placed at a distance of 10 cm .
from the lead block .
The electrode of the chamber consisted of a wire bent into the form of a .square , so that the principal stream of 7-rays through the aperture did not impinge upon it .
The ionisation in the chamber was , as before , principally due to the direct ionisation of the gas by the 7-rays and the secondary / 3-rays from the plate b placed over the aperture a. The plate b was of aluminium 4 mm. thick .
The readings were carried out in exactly the same way as in the foregoing .experiment .
The ionisation in the cone c decreased to about 55 per cent , of its original value , when a magnetic field of sufficient strength to prevent the , / 9-rays from the plate b entering the chamber was applied .
Part of the ionisation in the cone c is thus , as obtained before , due to the direct action of the 7-rays on the gas .
It appears , then , from these experiments that the ionisation in a chamber is due in part to the direct action of the 7-rays on the gas it contains .
And .since Laby and Kaye have shown that the amount of ionisation produced by the secondary / 3- and 7-radiation from the gas is small , this ionisation consists of slow-moving ^0-rays ejected by the 7-rays , which have not .'Sufficient velocity to produce any further ionisation themselves .
The ratio Fig. 6 .
366 Dr. R. D. Kleeman .
The Ionisation [ Apr. 3 , of this part of the ionisation in a chamber to that produced by the radiation from its walls will depend on the ratio of the total inside surface of the walls #of the chamber to its volume , and other conditions .
The numbers obtained in the experiments just described suggest , however , that in most cases this ratio will probably be greater than one-half , or the ionisation produced directly by the primary 7-rays is probably in most cases greater than 50 per cent , of the total ionisation .
The ionisation produced directly by secondary rays in an ionisation chamber is probably a percentage of the same order as the above of the total ionisation ; it is more likely larger than smaller .
An experiment on this point would be difficult to carry out .
It seems , however , unnecessary , as this quantity depends on a number of other things besides the nature of the rays , such as the size of chamber , etc. Source of Vapours and Gases .
The vapours of the liquids CHCI3 , C4Hi0O , CS2 , CC14 , C5H12 , CH3I , C2H5I , .
C2H5Br were obtained by letting small quantities of these liquids evaporate into the ionisation chamber in the way already explained .
The preparations used were those of Kahlbaum .
Mr. Jones , of the Chemical Laboratory , Cambridge , kindly supplied the writer with a small quantity of Ni(CO)4 .
The compound is a liquid at ordinary temperature , and could therefore be dealt with in the same way as the above liquids .
The compounds C2H5CI , CHsBr are in the form of vapour at the ordinary room temperature and atmospheric pressure , and are therefore sold in sealed glass flasks , in which they are in the liquid state under high pressure .
The flasks to be used were put into melting ice for half an hour and then opened , , the pressure in each case being then less than 1 atmosphere .
A quantity of liquid from one of the flasks could be evaporated into the chamber by connecting it and the flask by a rubber tube .
These preparations were also those of Kahlbaum .
The gases 02 , C02 , NH3 , N20 were obtained of commercial purity from steel cylinders containing these gases under high pressure supplied by various manufacturers .
The H2 was prepared by means of a Kipp 's apparatus , sulphuric acid and zinc being used .
It was purified and dried by bubbling it through a solution of potassium and permanganate of potassium in water , and then through strong sulphuric acid .

Experimental Results .
The experimental results obtained with a number of gases are given in Table I , the ionisations being expressed in terms of air as unity .
Radiators of zinc , carbon , and lead were used .
The surface of each radiating plate measured 24 by 28 cm .
, and their thicknesses were respectively 065 , 2 , and 0'5 cm .
Each value in the table is the mean of several determinations made on different days , and each determination is the mean of at least eight electrometer readings .
A fair agreement between the different determinations was usually obtained .
The values obtained must depend to some extent on the thickness of the radiator used , since the nature of the 7-rays emitted by a radiator must depend to a certain extent on its thickness .
They must also be somewhat influenced by the shape and the size of the chamber .
The values obtained therefore apply more particularly to the conditions realised in these experiments .
This should not , however , violate the general conclusions that can be drawn from the results , as will appear when these are discussed .
The ionisations obtained with the primary 7-rays , the / 9-rays of uranium , and the a-particle from radium for a number of gases are also placed in the table for comparison .
They have been taken from a previous paper by the writer.* The values for the a-particle , with the exception of NH3 and SO2 , are due to Prof. Brag , f whose results were incorporated in the paper .
Table II contains the results obtained with soft and hard primary X-rays by McClung , J Stfutt , S Eve , || and Crowther.1T The most recent results are those by Crowther .
The " hard rays " used by him were obtained with the X-ray bulb as hard as it was possible to work with , using a Rudge induction coil worked by a turbine mercury interrupter , while the " soft rays " were the softest rays that would produce an appreciable amount of ionisation .
Crowther confined his beam to the middle of the ionisation chamber so that * ' Roy .

369 power of the X-rays used .
They are very probably due to the fact that these observers allowed the X-rays to fall on the walls of the ionisation chamber .
The chamber was in that case crossed and recrossed by the radiation successively reflected between opposite walls , becoming softer and softer during the process , so that the nature of the rays as a whole which produced the ionisation was very different from the rays given out by the X-ray bulb .
The general trend of the values is , however , the same .
Deductions from the Results .
The ionisation values for the primary and secondary 7-rays can be divided into three sets , which are separated from one another in Table I by horizontal lines .
The first set consists of gases whose molecules are composed of atoms of H , C , X , O , S , Cl. It will be seen that the ionisation values of these gases are practically the same for the primary and secondary rays in the case of each of the radiators used .
In the case of gases containing atoms of higher atomic weight than chlorine , however , there are considerable differences with primary and secondary rays , which depend on the nature of the radiator .
Thus the ionisation in the first set of gases , and probably in all gases except H2 composed of atoms of low atomic weight , is practically independent of the penetrating power of the 7-rays .
An inspection of the results obtained by Crowther with hard and soft X-rays shows that the ionisation in these gases with X-rays depends comparatively little on the softness and hardness of the rays .
But on the whole his values are from 6 to 12 times larger than those which the writer obtained with 7-rays .
A comparison of the ionisation values of the gases of the first set obtained with the a- and / 3-rays , and the primary and secondary 7-rays , shows that they are approximately the same for each kind of rays .
The process of ionisation in these gases thus appears to be the same for each ionising agent .
The second set in the table consists of gases whose molecules contain at least one atom which is of greater mass than the chlorine atom .
It will be seen that the ionisation is greater in these gases with the secondary rays than with the primary .
Thus the ionisation in C2H5I with a carbon radiator is nearly three times that obtained with the primary rays .
The difference in ionisation increases with the atomic weight of the heavy atom in the gas , and is greatest with the carbon radiator and smallest with the lead radiator .
In the case of X-rays , the ionisation in the gases of this set also increases with the softness of the rays , except in the case of ethyl bromide .
The ionisation in ethyl bromide has been shown by Crowther to decrease very 370 Dr. R. D. Kleeman .
The Ionisation in [ Apr. 3 , considerably with the softness of the rays .
This property of ethyl bromide is very remarkable , and some interesting deductions can be made from this result and that obtained by the writer with 7-rays .
Thus if the 7- and X-rays are the same in nature there should be no discontinuity between them , but rays of all conceivable penetrating powers should exist , including the hardest 7-rays and the softest X-rays .
The curve connecting ionisation and penetrating power of rays for ethyl bromide would therefore very probably be of the form shown in fig. 7 .
The regions of the ETHYL BftOH/ DE Hf/ YSr/ fAT/ T/ C A'OWf/ f .
Fig. 7 .
-curve suggested by the experiments of Crowther and the writer are marked off in the figure .
The curve suggests that it might be possible by increasing the hardness of the X-rays from a bulb to reach a point at which a further increase in the hardness of the rays would produce a decrease instead of an increase in the ionisation .
Or , by successively reflecting 7-rays from a number of radiators one might obtain rays of such softness that the ionisation produced would decrease instead of increase with the softness of the rays .
When the ionisations obtained with the \#171 ; - , / 3- , and 7-rays for the gases of the second set are compared with one another , it will be seen that on the whole they vary considerably with the nature and quality of the ionising agent , and in this respect form a marked contrast to the ionisations in the gases of the first set .
The third set in the table contains the gas H2 .
The ionisation in this gas was found to be smaller with secondary than with primary rays .
The ionisation thus increases with the penetrating power of the rays .
The decrease was greatest with the carbon radiator and smallest with the lead 1909 .

371 radiator .
With the heavy gases we have seen the increase of the ionisation is greatest with the carbon radiator and smallest with the lead radiator .
Thus the cause which produces a decrease of the ionisation in Ha produces an increase in a heavy gas .
The nature of this cause is probably related in some way to the penetrating power of the rays .
But it is impossible to trace a definite connection between this effect and the penetrating power of the rays from carbon and lead as measured by the absorption produced by thin sheets of metal , because the relative penetrating powers obtained depend on the metal used in their determination .
This point is further discussed under " Ionisation and Absorption of Bays .
" The behaviour of H2 with 7-rays is analogous to that with X-rays , as an inspection of Table II will show .
This suggests that the curve connecting the ionisation in H2 and the penetrating power of the ionising agent , assuming that the 7- and X-rays are of the same nature , is probably the form shown in fig. 8 .
The regions whose form is suggested by the experiments with X-rays and 7-rays are , as before , marked off in the figure .
It is not improbable , as already suggested in the case of ethyl-bromide , that it would be possible to obtain some experimental evidence , by using very hard X-rays or very soft 7-rays , of the connection between ionisation and penetrating power indicated by the middle portion of the curve .
Fig. 8 .
The ionisation in the various gases , omitting H2 for the present , is approximately an additive quantity .
This is shown by Table III , which contains the ionisations by the secondary rays from a zinc radiator , and the quantities called atomic ionisations by means of which the values under " calculated ionisations " in the table were calculated .
The experimental and calculated results obtained previously by the writer with the primary 7-rays are also placed in the table .

S02 and CS2 thus evidently do not fit in very well with the other gases with respect to the additive law .
It is remarkable that the ionisation values obtained with the primary 7-rays , and the \#171 ; - and / 3-rays , show similar deviations .
The calculated value for S02 , if we take the atomic ionisation for S obtained from CS2 , is in each case greater than the experimental ( see Table V ) .
^ The agreement between calculation and experiment for the remaining gases in Table III is not quite so good with the secondary rays as with the -primary .
This is probably in some measure due to the errors of experiment being greater in the former case .

The curves are separated somewhat in the direction of the ordinate in order to prevent overlapping near the origin .
It will be seen that the upward slope of the curve for the secondary rays increases with increase of atomic weight .
The curve for the primary rays , on the other hand , does not show any increase in slope .
The sensitiveness of an atom to the penetrating power of 7-rays thus increases with the atomic weight .

It will be seen that the atomic ionisations for the atoms H , 0 , 1ST , 0 , S , 01 , are approximately the same with each of the ionising agents , as we would expect from an inspection of the ionisation values of the gases in the first set of Table I.

It is greater or less than that in the latter case , accordingly as the ionisation of the gas by the additive law is greater or less than the experimental .

375 of H in the gas Ha is greater than when the atom occurs as a constituent in any of the other gases .
It is very probable that this is also true for the other ionising agents besides the a-particle .
The decrease of the ionisation in H2 with increase in softness of the 7- and X-rays may then be due to an increase in the expenditure of energy in the production of an ion .
On the whole it is evident that the chemical bond which holds two atoms of hydrogen together differs in nature from that which holds it in combination with the atoms in some other gases .
If an atom consists of an assemblage of electrons , we would expect that some of the electrons would be under a constraint when the atom is combined with other atoms , and that this constraint might be the same for some combinations while different for others .
The electrons under constraint would probably be more difficult to pull out of an atom than the other electrons , and the departures from the additive law accounted for by departures in the nature of the constraint .
The departure of H3 from the additive law , and the increase of this departure with the increase in the softness of the ionising rays , adds another anomaly to the list for which the gas is already famous .
It is probable that these anomalies are due to the same cause , which is probably a departure in the arrangement of the forces of constraint holding the two atoms of the molecule together from the arrangement in the case when hydrogen is combined with other atoms .
If that is so , the forces outside a H2 molecule should differ considerably from those outside any other molecule , and the scattering of moving electrons by H3 should therefore be anomalous .
Now this has been found to be the case.* The scattering of electrons by the gases air , argon , and carbonic acid is about what we should expect if we suppose that the charge on the electron does not influence its mean free path .
; the absorption by hydrogen is , however , considerably greater than the value got on this supposition , showing that the hydrogen molecule is surrounded by a field of force which is practically absent in the case of the molecules of the other gases .
Dependence of Ionisation on the Direction of Propagation of the Secondary Pays with respect to that of the Primary .
The experiments described were made with secondary rays propagated more or less in the opposite direction to the primary rays .
Some experiments were also made with the secondary rays propagated in the same direction as the primary .
The arrangement used is shown diagrammatically in fig. 10 .
A denotes the ionisation chamber , B the radiator , and C the * See Prof. J. J. Thomson 's * Conduction of Electricity through Gases , ' 2nd edition , p. 382 .
Dr. R. D. Kleeman .
The Ionisation in [ Apr. 3 , radium .
Readings were taken with and without the radiator in the same way as before .
It was found that the ionisation in CH3I , with a zinc radiator , was 8*42 instead of 12*07 , as was obtained with the previous arrangement .
The nature of the secondary radiation from a plate thus depends on its direction of propagation with respect to that of the primary rays .
Since the ionisation with the primary rays is less than with the secondary , which are more absorbable , we infer that the secondary rays , which are propagated in the same direction as the primary , are of a more penetrating character than those which are propagated in the opposite direction .
This result falls into line with some experiments by Madsen , * who showed that the secondary 7-rays which proceed from the side of a radiating plate where the 7-rays emerge are of a more penetrating character than those from the side where the 7-rays enter .
Madsen measured the penetrating power of the rays by observing the absorption produced by sheets of metal of different thicknesses placed in their path .
The reason for the difference in the penetrating power of the rays is that the secondary 7-rays are initially propagated in the- same direction as the primary , but during their further course are scattered to a certain extent by the material , and softened in the process .
The returned secondary rays have undergone the maximum amount of scattering , and are therefore softer than those which are propagated approximately in the same direction as the primary .
Connection between Ionisation and Absorption .
The amount of ionisation produced by the electrons ejected from the molecules of a gas with sufficient velocity to produce ions by collision is very small , as we have seen at the beginning of this paper .
The ionisation in a gas measured in a chamber whose walls radiate no secondary rays is therefore proportional to that fraction of the energy of the 7-rays absorbed which is converted into energy of electrons of slow velocity , or S-rays .
The amount of energy absorbed of a beam of 7-rays by a sheet of metal placed in its path is a measure of the energy absorbed in the production of cathode rays of high speed as well as slow-moving ones .

3 energy represented by an electron of high speed ejected by 7-rays may be several thousand times that represented by a slow-moving electron , or \lt ; $-ray , the proportion of energy absorbed which is converted into kinetic energy of electrons of high speed may be quite large .
It appears , therefore , that we cannot compare the ionisations in gases with the absorption of solid materials unless we know how the absorbed energy is distributed between the electrons of high and slow speed .
The results on the ionisations in gases by secondary 7-rays described in this paper , and those on the absorption of secondary rays by different materials obtained by the writer , * cannot therefore be compared with one another .
Some idea of the distribution of the absorbed energy between the electrons of high and slow speed might be obtained by comparing the ionisation in the vapour of a liquid by a given source of rays , and the absorption of energy by the liquid for equal masses .
It is a pleasure to me , in conclusion , to acknowledge the keen interest and helpful encouragement of Prof. Sir J. J. Thomson during this research .
