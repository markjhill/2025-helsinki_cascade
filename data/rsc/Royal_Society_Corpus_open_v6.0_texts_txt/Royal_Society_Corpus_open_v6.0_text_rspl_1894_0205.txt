262 Presents [ Jan. 24( .cerned , give no evidence of anything different from what obtains^ Monotropa uniflora and Gorallorhiza multiflora\#151 ; phanerogamous plants destitute of chlorophyll .
Some of the more important facts ascertained in the investigation may be thus briefly stated :\#151 ; 1 .
Iron , firmly combined , is a constant constituent of animal and vegetable chromatin .
Another compound , less rich in iron , is found in nucleoli .
2 .
The chromophilous substance in ferment-forming cells contains iron , and the cytoplasm of Protozoan organisms , which also probably secretes ferments , yields evidence of the presence of a firmly combined iron compound .
3 .
A firm compound of iron is present in the chromophilous sab .
stance of the cytoplasm of Fungi .
4 .
Of the non-nucleated organisms , Bacteria , owing to their minuteness , have , with one exception , given little evidence of the presence of an organic iron compound ; but in the Cyanophyceae the chromophilous portions of the " central substance " contain iron , and iron may be also demonstrated in the peripheral granules formed of the so-called cyanopbycin ( Palla ) .
