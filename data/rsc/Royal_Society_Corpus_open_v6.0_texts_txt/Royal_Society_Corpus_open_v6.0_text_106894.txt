Investigations , founded on the Theory of Molion , for deter mining the Times of Vibratiort of Ga\#163 ; c &lt; D B.vlances By George Atwood , Esq. F. A. SX Read February 27 179+ .
1NSTRUMENTS for measuring time by vibratory * motion were invented earlwy in the sixteenth + century : the single pendulum t had beenknown to afford a very exact measure of\#163 ; time kng before this perii yet it appears from the testimony of historical accounts , as well as other evidences , that the balance was universally adopted in the construction of the first clocks andsuatches ; nor was i-t till theP year 165y that Mr. AEIUYGEN .
S united pendulums with clock-work The first essays of an invention , formed on principles avt once new and complicated , we may suppose were imperfectly executed .
In the watches of the early constructions , some of The anclent$ , as early as rXo years ifore CHRIST ( !

which are still preserved , the balance vibrated merely vby the impulses of the wheels , without other control or regulation b the motion communicated to the balance ba one impulse continued tilI it was destroyed partlJr by friction , and partly by -a succeeding impulse in the opposite direction ; the vibrations -must of course have been very u ; nsteady and irregular .
These imperfections were in a great measure remedied by Dr. HOOKE)S ingenious -invention of applying a spiral spring to the l)alance g the action of this springon the balance of a watch , is similar to that of gravity on a pendulum : each killed of force has the effect of correctilag the irregularities of impulse and resistance , which otherwise disturb the isochrolaisn of the vibrations .
During the present century , various improvements have sbeen madein the construction of watchesS principally by the artists oftlliscountry , to whoseingenuity and skill , aided and encouraged by public rewards we must attribute the excellence of the modern watches and time-keepers , so highly valuable for their uses in geograpllyn navigation and astronomy .
The principles on which ti-me-keepers are constructed , considered ill a theoretical view , afford an interesting subject of investigation It is always satisfactory to compare the motion of machines with the general laws of mechanics , whenever friction and other irregular forces are so far diminished as to allow of a reference to theory l especially if inferences , likely to be of practical use , may be derived iNrom such comparison .

In tim e-keepers , the irregular forces , both of im pulse and resistance , are much diminished by the exactness of form and dim-ension which is given to each part of the work ; and they are further corrected by the m aintaining power derived from the m ain spring : for w hatever m otion is lost by thebalance from resistance of any kind , alm ost the sa mem otion is co mm unicated by the m aintaining power , so asto continue the arc of vibrationa as nearly as possible , of the same lengtl1O In these m achines , the real measure of tim e is the ba]ance , all the other work serving only to continue the m otion of the balance , and to indicate the tim e as m easured by its vibrations .
The regularity of a tim e-keeper will therefore depend on that of the tim e in which the balance vibrates : to investigate this tim e ofvibration , from the several data or conditions on which it depends , is the object of the ensuing pages .
Let PMNS( Tab X IV .
fig.o .
) representthe circu m ference of a watch balance , which vibrates by the action of a spiral * spring , on an axis passing through the centre C. Let ODB IC be the circumference of a concentric circle considered as fixeds to which the motion of the balance may be referred .
In the circumference of this circle let any point O be assumed , and s -hen the balance is in its quiescent position , sllppose a line to be drawn through C and 0 intersecting the circumference of the balancein the point A ; the radius CA will be an indexj by which the position of the balance , and its m otion through any difiFerent arcs of vibration will be truly defined .
In the ensuing pag-es , the nnotion of the balance , and the m otion:of the index C Sk , will be used indifFerently , asSterms collveying the-same meaning .
Since the balance is in its quiescent posi tion when ] the index CA is directed to the fixed point 0 , on this account O is caIled the point of quiescence of the balanceg or balance spring , indicating the position when the balarlce is not irrlpelled by the spring &gt; s elastic force either in one directiOll or the other .
If the balance should be turned through ally allgle OC Bn the spiral spring being ; wound through the same angle , endeavours by its elastic force to restore itself ; and whez at liberty , impels the balance through the arc BO with an accelerated velolcity till it arrives at the position 0 , where the force of acceleration ceases ; with the velocity ac Vquired at 0 , the balance proceeds in its vibration describing the arc O with a retarded motion .
: ; The elastic forces of the spring at equal distances on the opposite sides of the pOillt O , are assumed to be equalS it is i also assumed that the effiects of friction5 and other irregular resistances which retard the motion of the balance , are compensated by the maintaining power , so that the time of describing the first arc of vibration BO by an accelerated motion , shall be equal to the time of describing the latter arc 0E by a retarded motion , and that the entire arc of vibra tion BOE is bisected by the point 'Oe XTo render the : cotastruction of -fig .

Silppose the plane of the balance to l)e placed verticallys and let a weight P ( fig. 2 .
) be applied by means of a line suspended freely from the circumference at T , to counterpoise the elastic force of the spring when the bala-nce is wound through an angle froul quiescence OC D. This weight P ( the weight of the line being allowed for ) will be the force of the spiral spring which impels the circumference of the balancey when at the angular distance OD from the quiescent position .
I It appears ffom many experiments7 that the weights necessary to counterpoise a spiral springis elastlc force , when the balance is wollnd to the several distances from the quiescent point3 representedX by the arcs C)G5 OH , OI , ( fig.2 .
) &amp;c. are nearly in the ratio of those several arcs .

to each other , that the forces of elasticity shall be counterpoised by weights nvhich are in the precise ratio of the-angular distances from the quiescent position , or , as it is sometimes expressed , in the ratio of the spring 's tensions , at least as nearly as can be ascertained by experimeat : this law of elastiG force is assumed in the subsequent investigation .
The position of the centre of geration may be always determined when the figure of the vibrating body is regular , by calculating the sum of thevproducts which arise from multiplying each particle into the square of its distance from the axis of motion , and dividing the sum by the weight of the vibrating body the square root ; of the result will be the dis}tance of the centre of gyration from the axis of motion .
When the figure of the vibrating body is irregular , recourse may be had to experimental * methods , in order to determine the position of the centre of gyration .
Let the radius of the balance CA or CO = r , ( fig. s. ) the semiarc B O-b ; let the springs elastic force , acting on the circumference of the balancen when wound to any given angle OCD from the quiescent position be P , an(I let the arc O D-a ; the weight of the balance , and the parts which vibrate with it =W r the distance of the centre of gyration from the axis of motion CG -g .
These notations being premisedn the resistance of inertia by xvhich the mass contained in the balance opposes the communication of motion to the clrcumference is Wr2g : and e ; onsequently the force which accelerates the circumference at the angular distance OGD from the quiescent position is wgz This quantity remaining invariably the same while the balance describes the arc of vibration BO E , may be denoted by the letter F , so that r Treatise on the Rectilinear Motion and Rotation of Bodies , ple 2z6 and Os0 F-wrg2 ; suppose the radius CA commencing a vibration from the point B to have described the arc B H , and let OHr 'X ; since the force which accelerates the circumference at the angular distance from quiescence OD is = F , and the forces of acceleration are supposed to vary in the proportion of the angular distances from the quiescent point 0 , the force which accelerates the circumference of the balance at the point H will be _ FX , let u be the space through which a body falls freely from rest by the acceleration of gravity to acquire the velocity of the clrcumference at the point H ; the principles of acceleration give this equation , ea_ FWX w* NEWTONII Princ .
Vol. I. prop. xxxix .
Let a body describe the line AC by the acceleration of a force varying A -E in any ratio of the distances from a centre C. Let another body describe the line EH by the acceleration of a constant or uniform force .
Supposc the relocity at O to O be equal to the velocity at 1Z , and let OG and DF be D the evanescent spaces ; or increments of space in which F equal velocities are generated , so that ED may represexlt a line through which a body must fall from rest by the acceleration of the constant or uniform force , to acquire the Pc velocity of the other body at 0 .
It is to be proved that the increment of space OG is to the increment of space D , as the force of acceleration at D to the force of acceleration at O. Let the former of these forces , i. e. at D be denoted by G , and the latter force atO by He Let E ; O = , and let AQ =X .
AlsoletDF = , and OG-x .
-Because the incxements of velocity are always as the forces of acceleration and the elementary times in which they act jointly , it follows , that when the increments of velocity are equal , the forces are in the inverse ratio of the elementary times in which they act ; that is ( the velocities of describing the evanescent spaces Q ( ; , DF being equal by the supposition ) , the brces are in the inverse ratio of those \#162 ; spaces ; and conseeluently the force at V ( G ) is to the force at O ( EI ) as OG to D F ; that is , according to the precedingnotation . ?
G : H : : x:u or u= G. The constant force G being assurned equal to that of gravIty , may be denoted by any constant quantity , such as unity .

If the balance should .
be a cylindrical plate , it is known that the distance of the centre of gyration from the axis is to the rad-ius as 1 to ^/ 2 S wherefore in this case g2 = rz s and the time of a semivibration , or tvW p3 reV 32 P1e The balances of watches are usually of such a form as to place the centre of gy ration nearly at the same distance from the axis , as if the figures were cylindrical plates of uniform thickness and density .
If it should be required to obtain from Etheory the time of a lJalance 's vibration precisely exact , it would be necessary to calculate rigidly the position Of the centre of gyration from the dimensions of each part of the balance , and whatever vibrates with it .
But in cases merely illustrative of the general theorems for ascertaining the times of vibration , it is unnecessary to enter into prolix and troublesome calculatio}ls depetlding on the form of any particiilarbalance ; since by assuming it as a cyltndrical pIate , the time of a vibration will not differ materially from that which would be the result-of the correct investigation .
Being desirous of comparing the time of vibration , as deduced from the theory of motion , with the actual vibration Olc a watch balance , I requested Mr. EAR NS HAW ( the excellent perfiormance of whose time-keepels is well known ) to make the Cexpeiiments from which the necessary data for this calculation are deriered .
These experiments^ were made orl the balance of a watch cotlstructed by Mr. RENDAL , on Mr. HARRISONSS principles , and is the instruinent which Captain COOK took out with him during his * last voyage to the South , Seas .
The results are undertleath : lliameter of the balance _ Z4 iIlches..:Weight of the balarlce , and parts wKhich vibrate with it : .

The weight which counterpoises the spring 's force when the balance is wound to go degrees from quiescence ss 24 grains .
These determinations give the following substitutions in the expression b1 the time of a semis-ibration t=/ Wp r , It is observable that the semiarc of vibration BO= b , does rzot enter into these expressions for the time of a semivibration , if therefore instead of the semiarc B 0 , an arc of any other length LO , terminating in the point of quiescence 0 , ( fig. 1 .
) should be substituted in the preceding investigation , the time of descriling LO would be still = / ig or s/ p3 r c ' 81F SlEx eEqual to the time of describing the other semiarc B O ; consequently , whether the balance vibrates in the largest or smallest arcs , the times of vibration mrill be the same .
From the precee:ling investigations it appears , that when the force by which the circumference of the balance is accelerated at the gisterl angular distance c ' from the quiescent position is _ 1S , the time of a semivibration t=/ p3 r c ' 8lFxI 80 ' and conrrersely , when the time of a semivibration is = t , the force which accelerates the circumference at the given angular distance c ' from the quiescent position , that is F= 8 IPt2 X,8 o Since watches and time-keepers are usually adjusted to Namely , W= 42 gr. = the weight of the balance , including the parts ^:which vibrato with it .

And if the radius of the balance is greater or less than X inch , the force by which the ni-reuinference isaccelerated at the distance of go ' from quiescence , will be greater or less than r.ooo8g26 in proportiorz to the radiiW According to tXh-e principles assumed in the preceding so : Iution3 the spring 's elastic force is supposed to vary in the proportion of the angular distances from the quiescent position , and on this condition , the vibratlons are shown to be isochronous , whether they are performed in longer or shorter arcss but if the spring'-s-elastic force at diSerent distances from quiesceJace should not be precisely in the ratio here as=sutned ?
the lorlger and shorter arcs may be described in times diSering in any proportions of inequ-ality .
If , for instance , the spring 's force , instead of varying in the ratio of the aforesaid distances , should vary in the I909Q90 power , or I ooo power of the distances , it does not appear from the preceding solution what alteration in the dailyratewould be caused bythis change in the law of the force 's variation when the semiarc of vibration is irlcreased or diminished by a given arc .

To apply this proposition , let a case be assumed X suppose a watch to be regulated to mearl time when the semiarc of vibration is 35 ' , and let this sem-iarc be diminished 80 ?

The alteration in the daily rate of the watch will be obtained from the preceding theorem -by making the following substitutions .
BO= so , IO= 127 ' , n-19O9O9O : the alteration of the dailtr rate = 24h X 13S |Z-O-'OO _1+ 2".62 .
It here appears , that a very minute alteration in the law of the force 's variation , amounting to no more than I OtOO part of the entire ratio of the distances , causes an acceleration in the daily rate of more than 22't , when the diminution of the semiarc of vibration is 8 ' .
It may therefore be of some use to inquire , what are the diSerences of the weights to be observed in experiments from which the law of the spring 's elas-tic force is derived , first , supposing that law to be the precise ratio of the distances from the quiescent position ; and secondly , supposing the lastr of the force to deviate from that ratio by a small difference 'f Xotoo so as to become the I909090 power of the distances from the quiescent position , from the result a judgment may be form-ed how far experiments may be relied on for ascertaining the precise law according to &gt; which the elastic force of a spring varies .

This effiect on the rate might probably be augrnented to twenty or thirty seconds daily , and yet thecorresponding differences of vsreightsarising from the deviation of the spring 's force from the law of isochronism might be-too minute to become sensible by any statical counterpoise of the spring 's forcesS and it would # It may be here observedX that the difl5erences of the weights in the second and third columns of the table , first increas-e and afterwards decrease ; their difference-\#162 ; s be still less possible &gt; measure the said differences of weights with the exactness required for the determ-ination of the law obsersted by the spring 's -forces .
Experiments of this kind should not therefore be absolutely relied on for ascertaining practically the isochronal property of spiral springs , although this property must be allowed:to exist in theory , whenever the forces of elasticity at the several angular distances from the qu-iescent position are in the precise ratio of those distances .
The isochronal law of variation , here mentionedn may be conveniently assumed in theoretical investigationsn and proper corrections or equations ?
when necessary , may be applied to compensate for the deviation from this law , which may subsist in ally particular spiral spring ) whenever it can be satisfactorily ascer tained , or reduced withill known limitsn by suck mode of inference as the nature of the case lllay adlnit of .
This assumption will appear the less excelptionable from considering , that the elastic forces of spiral springs whic31 are not isochronal deviate from the law of variation in question in so-nze cases by exceeding , and in others , by falling short of it ; and no other law is -suggested either by theory or experiment , which more generally corresponds with the action of balance springs .
The vibration of a balance impelled by a single spiraI spring only , has been the subject of the preceding investigations ; but cases occur in which two or more springs are employed in giving vibr-atory motion to the balances of watches .
Not tomention precedirag irsstances , Mr. MUD : GE , an eminent watch-maker of the present times , has illvented a method of combining the action of spiral springs , to impel the balance in each semiarc of vibration , on a principle not more remarkable for the novelty than it is for the ingenuity ; of the colatrivance .
The consideration of this additiorlal case will therefore not Sbe thought foreign to the present subject , especially as it may contribute to elucidate some circumstances respecting the effect of springs on the vilvrations of balances , which at the first view are not at all obvious .
Let two spiral springs be applied to act orl a watch balance in the same clirection ; if the two springs in unwtillding thernselves , by turning the balance come to the same point of quescence , or , in other words if the accelerative forces of both springs cease at the middle point of the vibration , whatever be the relative strength of the two springs , they will act on the balance precisely in the same marlller as if one spring only had been applied , of equal strength with both ( the springs being here supposed silnilar , in respect af the law of the elastic forces and tensions ) .
But when the points of quiescence of the two springs-do not coincide , that isf when one spring continues to accelerate the balance in its vibration , after the acceleration of the other spring has ceased , the tinae of a seInivibration must be obtained from a separate investigation .
Let the circumference of a balance ( fig. + .
) be impelled lvy the action of a spiral spring through the semiarc of vibration B 0 , the forces of this spring being always in propDortion to the angular distances from the point of quiescence 0 ; let a secondary or avlxIliary spring also act OI1 the balance from the extremity of the semiarc B as far as the point Q , at which point all acceleration of the auxiliary spring ceases , the forces of the auxiliary spring varying as the angular distances from the point of quiescence Q. Suppose that the accelerative force of the prirlcipal or balance spring ola the circumference of the balance at the distance from quiesceIlce OD is f , take QdO D , and let the accelerative force of the balance spring on the circumference of the balance be to that of the auxiliary sprirlgn when both springs are woxtlld to the same angle OCD =Q C d , in the proportion of t to n &gt; then the accelerative force of the auxiliary spring at the angular distance from quiescence Qd nrill = nf ; let BO= bs BQ_c , QO=d=b-c ; alsoiletODorQd-v .

Another case still remains to be consideredf which isvwhen the point of quiescence Q of the auxiliary spring deviates from O by the given angular distance O Q , but is situated in the latter semi-arc of the vibration ( fig. 5.)between O and E , instead of between Q a ; nd EC as irs the former solutionz According to tl:lis condition , making BQ= c , BO b3 and the other notation remaining as beforej it appears from-an investigation no ways differing fiome the precedingn that the time in which the ba Iance describes the semiarc B0 will be t , / 2ax into a clrcular arcs of which the sine 1s Ix , + 1 .

2b+ z.n C This result expresses the time ila nvhich the baIancede scribes the serniarc B O , ( fig. .
) by the accelerative force of tswo sprin$s , narnely , the balance spring , of which the point of quiescence is O , ando an auxilialy spring of which the point of quiescence is Q. On considering this case more fully , xvhen applied to the actual vibrations of a balancea it will appear evident , that the action of a third spring on the balance. .
nvhile it is describing the setniarc BOn must be taken into the calculation , in addition to the two springs already mentioned , in order to olbfaila a solutiorz entirely correspondent with the clrcumstances of the case , when the p3ints of quiescence of the auxiliary springs are situated in the latter semiarcs of the vi brations .
ToJstate this more clearly , it is to ke observed , that when the--points of quiescence of the balance and ausiliary springs -are coincident ; the auxiliary spr ; ing commencing its action from the-extremity B of the arc BO , ( fig. 6 .
) continues to accelerate the balance till it arrives at the quiescent position O at which point the action of the auxiliary spring entirely ceases ; on this account it is plain that another auxiliary sprlng , equal and similar to the former , having also the point of quiescence coincident with O must be applied to act by retardation on the balance while it describes the arc O E } in order that the times of describing the arcs BO and O , as well as these arcs themselves , may be equal .
According , , therefore , to this disposition of the auxiliary springs , the balance will describe each semiarc of its vibrations precisely in the same luanner as if it was impelled by one spiral spring only , the strength of which is equal to that of the balance and either auxiliary spring , when wound to the same tension .
Suppose the balance to vibrate from B to E , and , for the sake of distinction , let the auxiliary spring which accelerates the balance from the extremity of the arc B , in the direction B ( : ) be called u ; and let the other auxiliary * spring which retards the balance in the semiarc O be denoted by v ?
consequently , when the balance vibrates in the contrary direction from E to B , the auxiliary spring v will accelerate the balance from E to O , and the other auxiliary spring u will retard it from O to B. In respect , therefore , to the spring , BO is the first semiarc and O is the latter semiarc of vibration ; and on a similar principle in respect to the spring , EO is the first semiarc , and OB is the latter semiarc of vibration .
In the preceding pages , the time has been inlrestigated in whichabalancevibrates in the semiarc B-O , ( fig.4 .
) when the point of quiescence Q ?
of the auxiliary spring u , is situated between B and 0 , that is in the first semiarc of vibration .
In this case , in order that the time of describing the latter semiarc O E , by retardation , may be equal to that of describing the first semiarc BO by accelerated motion the quiescent pointof the au-xiliary spring v must 1)e placed at N , between O and E , ; so that ED N may be equal to BQa accordng to this disposition Qf the auxiliary springs , the point zof quiescence Q of the auxiliary spring u will be situated in the first semiarc of vibration , considering the balance as vibrating fr ; om B to ED ; and the poixlt of the quiescence-N of thebauxiliary spring , will be in the first semiarc of ribration , considerings the balance as lribrating from E to B. TheX thrd case which remainsto be more fully investigated xs , when thefl points of qu-iescence of the auxiliary springs are situated in tl ; ie latter semaarcs of the respectivexribrations v t}iat is , when the quiescent poirlt Q of the auxiliary spring u is situated in the latter arc O iE , ( fig. ) while the balance vibrates from Bto , and the point of quiescence N of the au-xiliary spring v is situated in the latter arc ; O B , while the balance vibratesfrom E to B. In t}:iis case it is evident , that while the balance vibrates from B to 0 , it describes the arc BN by the ac\#163 ; eleration of two springs ; namely , the balance spring , of zwhich thez point of quiescence is 0 , and the auxiliary spring u , of which the point of quiescence is Q. And the balance ; descrlbes the arc NO by the combined action of three springs ; namely , by that of the balarlce spring , of which the point of quiescence is 0 , that of the-auxiliary spring vi of which the point of quiescence ish Q , both of which accelerate the balance , and that of the avlxiliary spring v , of which the point of quiescence is Nv acting by retarding the balance .
The time in which the balance describes the semiarc B 0 , by the combined action of these three springs , will be obtained by the following invesfrgation .
Resuming the former notation , let DO ( fig. S )-a-Qd _ No , BO = b , BQ = c , OQ ON _d= c-b .

t This magnitude of the arc bB has been inEerred from the bllowing circumstances commllnicated by Mr. Mu oG E. I St. " The whole arc of vibration is about 4 05 { \#162 ; a circle , or 270 ' , consequendy the semiarc of sibrationis x35o ziTy .

" Wherefore if Q B , or 1 35 ' , is divided into five parts , one of them will be Oh= 27 ' , and the other four parts , or bB1 o8 ' Tst of the balance wheel from the pallet q ; the balance wheel accordingly reralves , and the upper tootll meeting with the pallet p , winds up the auxiliary spring u as before .

It is remarkable according to this construction , that no force or impulse w}watever is communicated to the balance from the mairl spring , and yet the vibrations are continued of their due length : on further consileration it appears that the maintainsng power of the machine , instead of commurlicating arly force or impulse , acts by removing a part of the force which retards the balancewhile it is descrlbing the latter semiarc of eachvibration In the preceding account it has been shown that the balance describes the semiarc from 13 to O by the joint action of the two springs ; nonv for a nnotllent let it be supposed thatv the balance vibrated through the entire arc B O ( fig. 7 and 8 .
) by the joint artion of the two springs } ill the same manner as if one balance spring only was applied of the same strength with both ; in this casen the balance commencing i-ts vibration at the extremity of the arc 13 after having 3assed the semiare BO with an accelerateel motion , would describe an equal arc O on the other side of Oy by retarded tnotion , provided it was not obstructed by friction or other irregular resistances ; but such resistances t ?
;king place will cause the latter semiarc , which is described by retarded motion tos fall short of the arc O by some small difference iS S. There are tw ; o modes by which this latter semiarc may be restored to its due length O E , eithe-r by communicating an irnpulse to the balancefrom the main sprlng , or by removing a part of the force which retards the ascent of the balance while it describes the latter semiarc O .
Mr. lul7DGE has discovered and applied to his time keeper the latter mode of supplying the power which is required to continue the balance in lnotionF During the progress of the balance through the seniarc B 0 , it is aecelerated by the Joint action of the lalance spring and ausiliary spring u ; but while it describes the latter semiarc O ( fig. 7 and S. ) it is retarded by the joint actions of the balance spring and auxiliary spring , only while it describes a part of the serniarc from k to E , the retardation of the auxiliary sprilag being removed while it describes the first 27G of this semiarc from O to k. It is evident , according to hIr .
1uUDGE'S construction9 that the diminution of retur:lation which is equivalent to the stlpply of power to the baiailce , must altways be of the same magnitudeg so far as regclrds the influence of the main springS provided it has sufficient force to wind up the auxiliary springs through the constant algle C ) G ; hoOCk ( figr 8 .

These circumstances concur in giving to the machine facility and lightlless of motion .
The preceding investigations are in the next place to be apI26 .
IEwe can ascertain the are described by the balance while the tooth of the balance wheel is released from the:projection of the pallet , the portion of time in which the balance is connected with the 7heel-work of the machine will be knownX By an experiment made on a very exact model of Mr. MUDGE2S construction , it appeared that the balance described an arc of about 8o , 7hile the tooth was released from the pallet .
And since the balance describes lo8 ' of its semivibration before the pallet begills to be moved , it will have described I I6D before the tooth is released , we are therefore to find the times in which the balance describes severally the two arcs ao8'and 1 t6 ' : the difference of these times will be the tillle in which the balance wheel is released from the pAllet .

This inquiry oiSers three casesg which are to be separatey coisidered ; fthe first is , when the points of quiescence of the auxiiiary springs &lt; coincide with the point of quiescence of the balance sprlng .

When Q is sitllated in the latter setniarc of vibration between E and ( : ) ( iXge $ .

The consideration of these cases requires that the accelerativeX forces of the balance sprlng and auxiliary springs9 when at a given tenslon9 shoultl be known This point will not be difficult to ascertain , if the proportion of the sping 's forces at the same tension is given .
By infortnation received from Mru MUDGE it appears that the force of each auxiliary spring is abo:ut 2Iopart of the force of the balance spring .

If the balance should vibrate by the force of the auxiliary springs only , the force of acceleration on the circumference at the distance 9O ' from quiescence is -t0 f 0.0+78 1 38 ; wherefore 2l0f being substituted for F in the quantity / 8 l 2 ) r c8 ; the other values remaining the same as in the former case , the time of a semivibration J3r Co pts .

Thus if t should be taken = to one minute , or 60 seconds of time , the time shown by the watch in 60 seconds will be = 6s x *21822 = 13 seconds nearly .
I:his would be the result if the forces of the balance and allsiliary springs were prce cisely in the proportion of : so to 1 .
Mr. Mupc , E mentioned this proportion by estiX 2 cond when adjusted to mean time , the daily rate will therefoe in this case be = o. t30w let S2 ( fig 4 and-8 .

If therefore the actual rate of the watch shouXd be obserlred when the balance vibratesbby the action of the auxiliary springs only , it is-probab]e that the time shown by the watch in 60 seconds of mean time might differ somewhat from that which has been here s-tated Since these notes were written , I have been favoured by his Excellency Count BRUHL with an account of an observation made OI1 the rate of Mr. MUDGEXS\#163 ; St ti1Mekeeper , when the balance vibrated by the action of the auxiliary springs Qn1YS the balance spring being remoured .
According to this observation , the watch showed twelve minutes by the motion of the hands in ol1e hour of meats time , which corresponds to an interva3l of 12 secoIlds of time , shown by the watch in 60 seconds ) or one minute of mean time .
According to the calculation , 13 seconds of time are shew-n by the watch in one minute .

Daily rate when the semiarc of vibration was 135 ' __ ? ?
19".SS faste Acceleration of the rate in consequence of the diminution of the semiarc of vibration from 1g$ ' to Xt = -zt Gs The theorem from which this latter resoult has been calculated is founded on a supposition , that the arc BN ( fig. S ) is described by the acceIerative forces of the balance spring and the auxiliary spring u , and ithat the arc NO is described by the accelerative forces of the two springs just mentioned , combined with the retarding force of the other auxiliary spring , of which the pOillt of quiescence is situated at N ( fig. .
) .
It may possibly be thought that this supposed action of the auxiliary spring vt ; lich retards the balance while it describes the arc from N to 0 , cannot take place , because by the peculiar construction of Mr. MUDGE'S invention , when the balance vibrates from B towards E , the retarding force of the auxiliary spring is re moved from acting on the balance while ittdescribes the arc N k-27 ' ( fig. 5 .
) , in cluding the said arc N( ) , btWlt lt is to be considered , that this removal of the retarding foxce from acting on the balance while it describes the arc from N to 4 , is merely av mechanical expedient for supptying the power which as lost by friction , and as it is thtls wholly ernploJred and cmn teractedf 1t appears requisite , in making-calculatons of the times itl which the balance vibrates , that the entire forces of ... . .
the springs are to be taken into the calculation ill the same manner as if friction did notexist , and no mecllarlical contri vance was necessary for comperlsating the loss of tuotion in consequence of it .
But since .
in pointof fact7 no retarding force acts on the balance while it describes the arc -N 0 , according to the conditions under cotlsiderationf it may be satisfactory to calculate the time of a semivibration in the aro BO on this ground also , that isS on a supposition that the erltire semiarc BO is described\ by the joint acceleratve forws of the balance spring , and the allxiliary spring u only ; it will appear that this slight rrariation of the condltions does not at all affect the conclusions deduced from the }receding calculations , and very little alters the results theinselves .
The time of describing the semiarc BO , on these conditions ; will be determined by referring to the theorem ( page &lt; 4X ) and making the following notationst a=I S707963 = an arc of go ' to mdius =X b-2.356o94S-an arc of 1sS c-t 2.$7$647X _ an arc of 36 d-o.ol74$33 = arl arc of ' .

By having recourse to the figure , we may distinctly perceive the three quiescent positions of the ams GO and I O , ( fig. 8 .
) in respect to the rods L 1H , Z W , which correspolld with the -several conditions as , sutned for the -calculation of the preceding examples .
Irl the first placef the crank AX Y D , and the artms G 0 , I 0 , being in their quiescent position , it is evident from the preceding observations , that when the arms G O , IO are adjusted so as just to touch the rods L Mg Z Wf the points of quiescerlce of the avlxiliary springs ls and r coincide with the point of quiescence of the balance spring 0 , ( fig. 6 .
) and in this case , the balance making S vibrations itl a secondcwhe adjusted to mean timef the daily rate is =o ( p. a46 ) .
Secondly suppose the arms GO and IO to be so affixed to the axes TR , FS , ( fig. 8 anel 4S ) that instead of just touching the rods LM and NW WllPll quRescent , they are inclined-t to that position at any angle OGQO 1[ N : the situation of the pallets p and q not being altered * in thiS case the point of quiescence of the auxiliary spring U7 Will be separated from the point of quiescence of the balance spring by the angular dis tance OGQ = : OCQ .
In like manner the point of quiescerlce of the auxiliary spring v will deviate from the point of quiescence of the balance spring by the angular distance OIN SO C N. Suppose that the arc OQ = ON is = t ' : the point of quiescence Q of the auxiliary spring a is in the first selniare of vibration3 that is , between B and : O , ( fig. 4 .
) while the balance vibrates from B to E ; and the point of quiescence of the ausiliary spring v is in the first selniarc of vibrationbetween E and Of while the balance vibrates from E to 13 ; on these conditiorlsS the semiarcs of vibration BO and OLs being g , ' , the daily rate of the time-keeper will be 19".40 slower than mean time , ( p. *G7 ) and if the setniarcs BO O , should be diminished from l3 , &amp; j'tO 12^dj ' , the dailyrate will be go''.gg slow ( p. 4GS ) ; the retardation of the daily rate in consequence of the diminished semiarc of vibration being lJ'.52 .
To consider the remaining case if the arms GO IO , ( fig S. ) are adjuste(l so as to press equally by the force of the auxiliary springs against the rods L M , W Z , when quiescent the equal and contrary pressures prevent any apparent effiect 31 The irce of the main spring not being supposed to act on the balance wheeR , tf palletsp andq .
on the pQBion of the balance or crank AXY D ; if the rod LM should be removed ( btr turning the balance in its plane)7 suppose that the arm GO rests in a position GN , at a distance beyond O , which is measured by the arc ON _ 1 ' t in this position the pOillt of quiescence of the auxiliary spring u will be si-tuated in the latter semiarc of lribration at N , between E and O , and by a similar adjustlment of the quiescent position of the arm IO , ( fig. 5 and 8 ) the point of quiescence of the auxiliary spring v will be situated at Q in the latter semiarc of the vib-rations between O and B ; in conwquence of this position of the points of quiescence , the daily rate of the watch will be -accelerated jgJ'.38n ( p. lS9 ) while the semiarc of vibration continues 135 ' ) and when the semiarc of vibration is diminished to 125 ' the daily rate will be further acceIerated a the rate being goS'.gl fast , ( page 160 ) or 1''.^53 faster than when the semiarc of vibration was 3t'* From these severalX results it may be concluded , that although the rate of going of Mr. MUDGE'S time-keeper depends materially on the quiescent position of the arms G 0 , I0 ( fig. 8 .
) } that is , on the position of the points of quiescence of the auxiliary springs yet while that pO .
Sition remains unalteredS whatever it may be7 the regularity of the timekeeper will not be aSected in consequence of tI- ; e sald position , provided the $emiarc of vibration continues tf-Xt same X but srSen this arc so Tt is scarcely necessary to observe , that aXth01uPh these resuts have been snvesti gated from supposing the elastic forces of ths spirzi.l stprinrgs to 13e IS the precise law of the tex3sions , or distances from quiescence ; yet if tze spring 's forces should deYiato somewhat from that law , the generaI conclusions deduced aCrom the preceding calcu lations respecting the acceIeration or retardation of tEXe rate ar1sing from an alteration in the position of the points of quiescence , zzill still be true , although the degree ill which these effects take place may not be exactly the saine as when the springXs forces a ili the precise law assumed in the investigations diminished , an acceleration or retardation of the daily rate will take placea according to the situation-of the points of quiescence of the auxiliary springs referred to the semiarcs of vi- !
bration in which these springs respectvely act .
If the points of quiescence of the auxiliary springs should be situated in the first semiarcs of vibratlon a diminution of these arcs will cause a retardation of the rate S but if the l ?
oitits of quiescenceb should be situated in the latter semiams of the respect-ve Yibrations , the daily rate will be accelerated .
By means of Mr. -MI}DGE}S construction we may applyAhe prirlciples deduced fbm the preceding investigations to correct suc-h alterations in the adaily rate as may arise from a diminiGhed or increased arc of vibration .
For if it should be .
known fFozn any satisfictory mode of trial , that the properti** of the balance spring are such as cause the longer arcs of vibration to be described in less time than the shorter aros whenever the arc of vibration is-diiminished , the time-keeper will lose ; and this error in the rate wo}ld be corrected Vi ad1 Justing the points of quiescence of the auxiliary springs in these respstive latter semarcs of vibration at such a distance O N _ OQ ( fig. 8 and .
) from the point of quiescence of the ba lance spring as corresponds with the error intended to be reca tified .
In like mannerg if the property of the balance sprlng should be such that a diSiNUtiOll of the arc of vibration causes an acceleration of the daily rate ?
this error will be corrected by placing the points Qf quiescence of the auxiliary springs in the first semiarcs of vibration , ( fig. 4 , and 8 ) at their proper distances from the polnt of qLuiescence of the balance spring .
It is , however , to be remarlied , that if the balance SpRing SllOUld be-pf the latter kind here assumed , and the points of quiescence of the aLtxXliary springs7 either by any casual derangement in their position ) or by an adjustment of them for the purpose of experimental observation should be placed in the latter semiaMrcs of vibration the efEect of this position would be an acceleration of the rateX whenever the semiarc of vibration is diminished and this effect would be produced on a double account b first , from the assumed nature of the balance spriilgn which disposes it ; to describe the smaller arcs in less time all the circumstances capable of influencing the times of vibration in longer or shorter arcs , were either not noticedy or omitted to be properly alIowed br ; this wilI seem the more probable if it be alLowed , that a balance spring may be adjusted in ViOtlS ways\#171 ; so that either the longer or short.el arcs shall be perbrnled in+ the least time ; IlOt only by altering the thickness and strength of the spring in d ; ierent parts , but , if we subscribe to the opinion Of M. BE a &lt; T HOU D ) in a spring uIliform in every respect through out , by altering the length and number of turns .
He infers , that a certain length and number of turns may be gilren to an uniform spiral spring which will Inake it perfectly isochronaI .
This latter pri\#163 ; acipley ilowever , does not appear to have been verified by any satisfactory experiments According to the inferences deduced from the preceding inrestigations , three spiral springs , which are not isochronal when acting singly , may be so united by properly adjusting theoir polnts of quiescences that theil combined action shall cause the balance to perform its vibrations itl aIly two arcs of unequal lengths in the same time .
$ The position of the points of quiesceIlce of the auxiliary springs is here understood to be altered , by affixing the arms G 0,.T K , differently on the axes T R , F S ; the quietent position of the pallets being no ways changndv than the larger arcs of vibration : and secondly , from the position of the points of quiesceri-ce of the auxiliary springs .
But it is evident from the preceding considerations , that although thebalance springshouldnot be isochronal , yet the regularityof the time-keepervvillrlot be at all affected , however the pointsofquiescerlceof the auxiliarysprings may be gituated in respect of the point of quiescence of the balance spring , as long as the semiarc of vibration continues uncharlged S and if the serniare of vibra tion should be liable t ) increase or climinution , Mr. MUDGE'S construction affiords an eSectual remedyagainst this causeofariation in the rate9 since the arms projecting from the auxiliary springs may be so adjusted , as toplace their points of quiescente either in the first or latter serniarcs of vibration , according as the balance spri-ng , when act\#162 ; ng singlyS causes the sherter or longer vibrations to be described n the least time 0R1 revising the precedi92g pages a few observatzons }22tre ocellrred/ tbicb may be here io-seJted .
