Introduction.\#151 ; Although rapid progress has been made in recent years through the work of a number of investigators* in extending our knowledge of the spectra of many of the elements far into the extreme ultra-violet , there remains quite a number of the elements whose spectra in this region have not been examined .
Among those elements whose spectra in the extreme ultra-violet region have not been studied are silicon , tellurium , molybdenum and zirconium .
The spectra of these elements have now been 'obtained by the writers , by the use of a spectrograph provided with a fluorite train , and the following paper contains an account of the investigation .

Apparatus.\#151 ; The fluorite spectrograph used by McLennan , Ainslie , and Fuller !
* was used at the inception of the investigation , but it was soon found that it was not well designed for rapid work .
The instrument was completely re-designed , and as re-modelled and constructed it is shown in fig. 1 .

The vessel was 7'5 cm .
deep and 30 cm .
internal diameter .
The lid , when in position , merely rested on the cylinder , and the junction was very caietully ground so that the application of a little " Airtite " was quite sufficient to hold an X-ray vacuum .
The lid was removed when adjustment of the spectrograph was necessary and also when a photographic plate was * Lyman\#187 ; ' Asfc- Phys. Jl .

Spark Spectra of inserted .
The plates used were 5 " x 1 " , and were cut from Schumann plates prepared by the Adam Hilger Company .
Fig. 1 .
The prism , F , was placed on an adjustable platform near the wall of the chamber and an opening was made to allow the attachment of a collimator tube .
A piece of cast bronze , S , was attached to the vessel at this point , and to this was attached the collimator tube , K , at an angle of 30 ' to the diameter of the vessel .
Inside this tube and concentric with it was placed a tube , H , carrying the slit , G , and collimating lens , E , kept in position by sleeve , L. Openings were made in L and H to allow air to pass freely from the collimator tube to the cylindrical vessel .
The collimator tube was terminated by an opening , T , very carefully ground so as to admit the spark chamber by the joint , E , shown in fig. 2 .
The platform on which the prism was mounted was clamped in position by two set-screws , as shown in the diagram .
An arm , P , on which was mounted the photographic plate-holder , AB , and the focussing lens , D , was fixed so that it could be rotated through an angle about an axis through the centre of the prism .
When the instrument was adjusted properly the arm could be clamped by a set-screw .
The carrier for the focussing lens , D , and G , that for the plate-holder , AB , could be slid along the arm , and could be clamped by screws when in position .
A feather-way was cut in the plate-holder to allow its being adjusted in a line parallel to itself .
It was guided by two screws .
The instrument could be approximately adjusted by using the aluminium spark in air as a source of light , and X1854 A.U. could be easily focussed Various Elements in Helium in the Extreme .
Ill visibly by using a fluorescent screen in AB .
Further adjustments were made by taking a series of photographs of the spectra of aluminium and antimony sparks in helium .
To remove the water vapour from the spectrograph , a cylindrical glass vessel , 0 , containing phosphorus pentoxide covered with glass-wool , was placed in the instrument as shown .
The air was removed from the apparatus by means of a set of oil-sealed mechanical Trimount pumps .
The connections were made with lead piping from the pumps to the aperture , R A short Geissler tube , to which was attached the terminals of a small 4-volt induction coil , served to show the degree of exhaustion in the apparatus .
During exhaustion the instrument was washed with electrolytic hydrogen , and a vacuum which showed a greenish fluorescence in the Geissler tube could be obtained in a few minutes .

Spark Chamber.\#151 ; The type of sparking chamber used is shown in fig. 2 .
It consisted of a glass bulb , approximately 10 cm .
in diameter .
Fig. 2 .
Aluminium rods , L , M , were sealed into ground-glass taps , F , G. The pieces ' elements imder experiment were connected at A , B. A brass carrier , E , 112 Prof. J. C. McLennan and A. C. Lewis .
SparJc Spectra of for carrying the fluorite window , K , was sealed with wax to the ehamber .
As shown in the diagram the brass carrier , E , was provided with a conical terminal with a well-ground surface .
This terminal made a close fit with the matrix shown at the end of the collimator tube indicated in fig. 1 , and when slightly smeared with " Airtite " it made a good seal .
Helium was used to fill the chamber at atmospheric pressure , and it was purified by passing it slowly through three tubes of carbon granules maintained at the temperature of liquid air .
The gas was admitted by the tap , D , and during the experiment the side-tube , H , containing carbon granules covered with glass-wool , was maintained at liquid-air temperature to absorb any gases other than hydrogen that might be given off during the spark discharge .
As a filling for the fluorite spectrograph , helium possesses the advantage that , while it is perfectly transparent for radiations whose wave-lengths lie between X1900 A.U. and X 1250 A.U. , the radiation which it can be made to emit within these limits consists , in so far as is known , of but the single wave-length X 1640 A.U. In making the experiments , the spark was obtained from the discharge of two |-gallon and 1-gallon Leyden jars , charged with a 10-inch induction coil .
The elements used were obtained from Messrs. Eimer and Amend , Hew York .

Method of determining Wave-lengths.\#151 ; In calibrating the instrument , the spectrum of aluminium was used as a standard .
Wave-lengths previously measured were selected , and the constants Xo , c and do in a Hartmann dispersion formula X = 'So + c/ d\#151 ; do were calculated and used to compute the unknown wave-lengths .
Superimposed on the spark spectra of the various elements in helium was the aluminium spark in air .
This provided a known zero line and at the same time did not interfere with o lines shorter than X1854 A.LL The plates were measured with an Otto Toepler and Son comparator .

Results.\#151 ; The spectrum of silicon in the upper ultra-violet region had been investigated by Prof. McLennan and E. Edwards , with an optical system of quartz down to X 1842-2 A.U.* Below this limit the only new wave-lengths observed in the present investigation with silicon appeared at X 1745 A.U. , X 1742-5 A.U. , and X 1657 A.U. The spectra of tellurium , molybdenum and zirconium were examined with the results given in Table I , and these are considered to be about correct to 0'5 A.U. It will be seen from the Table that a strong doublet appears common to all the spectra in the neighbourhood of X 1745 A.U. * Prof. McLennan and Edwards , ' Phil. Mag. , ' vol. 30 , October , 1915 .

X 1656-7 A.U. was found on all the plates which Lyman gives as present , in all metallic spark spectra in helium.* It was probably due to carbon from the decomposition of carbon monoxide given off from the wax joint .
As far as the writers can discover , none of the lines given for .tellurium , , molybdenum and zirconium have been measured hitherto for these elements .
In the spectra of molybdenum and zirconium all the wave-lengths observed were of weak intensity .
The radiations from tellurium , however , were stronger and their relative intensities are approximately those given in the Table .

In the spectroscopy of the extreme ultra-violet region , it is necessary-to work either with arcs in vacuo or with sparks in one or other of the gases hydrogen or helium .
As all other gases are opaque to ultra-violet radiations of short wave-length , their use is precluded .
With many of the elements , , arcs are difficult to maintain in a vacuum , and consequently one is driven to the use of sparks in either one or other of the two gases mentioned .
Lyman , f in his brilliant researches , has shown us that , with hydrogen , it is possible to obtain spectra extending to about X 900 A.U. For radiations below this limit , it would appear , however , that hydrogen is more or less absorbing. .
With helium , on the other hand , the evidence available goes to show that o this gas is transparent to radiations having wave-lengths as short as X 400 A.U. or X 500 A.U. , and possibly shorter still .
It would appear , then , that in the spectroscopy of the extreme ultra-violet , the procedure to be followed , which would permit of the most rapid progress being made , would be , in so far as the emission spectra are concerned , to work with a vacuum grating spectrograph , and to use an atmosphere of helium .
As regards the absorption spectra of the elements , helium also appears to be promising .
From the work of Mackay and Ferguson , J it is known that-arcs in helium can be struck and maintained for long periods between .
