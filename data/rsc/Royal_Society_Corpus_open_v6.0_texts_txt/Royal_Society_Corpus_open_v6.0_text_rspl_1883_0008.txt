\#171 ; On the Atomic Weight of Manganese .
" By James Dewar , M.A. , F.R.S. , Jacksonian Professor , Cambridge , and Alexander Scott , M.A. Received February 9 , 1883 .
Our attention has been directed for some time to a new determination of the atomic weight of manganese .
This communication gives a succinct account of the results of the preliminary stages of such an inquiry , and although the further progress of the investigation may reveal some errors , still we feel convinced the final numbers can in no way differ materially from the present values , and therefore further delay in publication is unnecessary .
The atomic weight of manganese has been determined by many chemists , * but the resulting values vary considerably according to the special method selected .
The results .of the different investigators may be divided into two classes\#151 ; those giving approximately 55 as the number , and those making it about 54 .
To the former class belong Turner , Berzelius , and Dumas , all of whom use the same method , viz. , the determination of the silver chloride yielded by a weighed amount of chloride of manganese .
Turner also made determinations from the analysis of the carbonate , and from the conversion of the monoxide into sulphate .
Yon Hauer used the same method as that employed by him in the determination of the atomic weight of cadmium , viz. , the reduction of manganous sulphate to sulphide by ignition in a current of sulphuretted hydrogen .
It is probable that this method is not very trustworthy , as , according to Schneider , the sulphide may be contaminated by oxysulphide .
Schneider and Rawack belong to the second class of observers , the former employing the oxalate , and from its analysis calculating the atomic weight by deducting the weight of water and carbon dioxide obtained .
Rawack , whose experiments were conducted in Schneider 's laboratory , weighed the water obtained by reducing manganoso-manganic oxide to manganous oxide .
One objection to the analysis of the chloride is that it may contain besides manganous chloride varying proportions of manganic salt .

1883.1 On the Atomic Weight of Manganese .
45 This must be the case if , as Forchammer maintains , pure manganous salts are colourless , the pink colour of manganese salts being due to traces of a manganic compound .
Forchammer has observed that on fusing manganese sulphate with potassium hydrogen sulphate , a white mass is obtained which gives a colourless solution .
We have been unable to prepare any chloride or bromide without a pink or rose colour giving a correspondingly coloured solution , and this was also the case with specimens fused in hydrogen and hydrochloric acid gas .
The effect of a trace of manganic salt in the chloride would be to lower the atomic weight .
The chloride and bromide of manganese are both not only very hygroscopic , but if fused in hydrochloric acid gas ( or hydrobromic acid in the case of the bromide ) are liable to retain traces of the halogen acids , and this would consequently make the atomic weight too low .
In order to ascertain the values of the atomic weight of manganese which result from careful analysis of the halogen salts , determinations were made of the molecular weights of chloride and bromide on specimens prepared with great care .
The number found for the bromide was 21487 , and for the chloride 125*825 , yielding the respective atomic weights of manganese of 54*97 and 54*91 .
-All researches on the oxides of manganese have shown that they are all difficult to obtain in anything like a definite form , with perhaps the exception of the protoxide .
It occurred to us that the analysis of silver permanganate might be employed with advantage , as this salt is found in a very definite state , and can be easily freed from all the allied metals .
The selection ot this substance,.moreover , involved only the atomic weights of silver and oxygen , and as it seemed feasible to deduce the atomic weight of the manganese directly from the percentage loss of oxygen on heating , we expected to get very accurate results .
In this we were disappointed , as we have not been able to obtain concordant results by this most direct method .

[ Feb. 15 , Table I gives the results of the direct determination of the 1 equivalent of the permanganate of silver by reduction in hydrogen .
The silver permanganate was heated in a bulb of hard glass , first ' in a current of pure air and then in hydrogen , at a red heat , until the S resulting mixture of silver and oxide of manganese had a constant weight .
The residue was allowed to cool in hydrogen , which was finally displaced by nitrogen before weighing .
The results obtained by this method show great variation , the errors being probably due to the occlusion of hydrogen and the suspension of some oxide of manganese in the oxygen evolved .
The method finally employed was to dissolve the permanganate of silver in dilute nitric acid in presence of various reducing agents , such as sulphurous acid , sodium formate , and potassium nitrite .
The silver was then determined by adding very nearly an equivalent quantity of pure potassium bromide , and titrating the small amount of silver remaining in solution , by means of very dilute potassium bromide , containing about T19 mgrms .
of the pure salt per gramme of solution .
The solutions were in all cases weighed , thus avoiding errors due to fluid expansion , faulty graduation of burettes , \amp ; c. The titrations were performed in yellow light in an apparatus similar to that used by Stas , and with all the precautions insisted on by him as essential to the accuracy of such determinations . .
The permanganate of silver crystallises readily from warm water , and is a very stable salt .
It is also quite anhydrous and not in the slightest degree hygroscopic .
From its small solubility it is easily freed from adhering impurities by recrystallisation .
The purity of the salt was tested by reducing about 5 grms. by means of alcohol and filtering , when the total residue only weighed 1'9 mgrms .
This residue when tested with the spectroscope was found to consist almost entirely of calcium salts from an accidental impurity in the distilled water , only the faintest trace of potassium being detected .
The sample which was tested in this way had only been recrystallised once after precipitation .
The salt was usually prepared by the precipitation of silver nitrate by means of an equivalent quantity of potassium permanganate , the solutions being warm , and the silver permanganate thus obtained in fine needles , was easily drained , washed , and recrystallised .
A quantity of the salt was also prepared from crystallised barium permanganate , which was made from barium chloride and silver permanganate , the barium salt being afterwards decomposed with pure silver sulphate .
This method of preparing the permanganate of silver ensures the absence of any trace of silver nitrate , which as Stas has shown adheres most persistently to many silver salts .
Permanganate of silver has several very important advantages over the other bodies previously used for the determination of the atomic weight of manganese .
Its freedom from hygroscopic properties and 1883.1 On the Atomic Weight of Manganese .
47 the improbability of its containing excess of any of the elements of which it is composed beyond what is necessary for the formation of the normal compound , recommend it especially for this purpose .
Another point which rendered its selection important was to ascertain if a body liable to partial decomposition under certain circumstances could give concordant results in atomic weight determinations , thus putting to a crucial test the amount of variation in the values which may be attributed to secondary causes .
Table II gives the results of the titrations .
The use of sulphurous acid as the reducing agent was found unsatisfactory , as a slight residue having the appearance of sulphide was almost always left undissolved .
The production of sulphate was also more or less troublesome from its insolubility .

Experiments ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) were made with a sample obtained from the barium salt , and these results are slightly higher owing to the presence of a small trace of barium sulphate easily recognisable by the slight turbidity of the reduced solution .
We had hoped by the use of a larger quantity of material to arrive at results comparable in some degree at least with those of Stas ; but we found the preparation of considerable quantities of material of absolute purity frequently involves sources of error not incurred in the production of smaller quantities .
This we observed especially in the preparation of our pure potassium bromide , which contained traces of sulphates in every sample .
This sulphate is due to the use of ordinary gas in the ignition of the pure bitartrate of potash from which the bromide of potassium was made .
In order to get a pure product gas must be replaced by a powerful flame of alcohol , or all the operations conducted in a muffle .

The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " The Effects of Temperature on the Electromotive Force and Resistance of Batteries .
" By William Henry Preeoe .
F.R.S. , Received February 8 , 1883 .
It is well known that heat influences the conditions of galvanic \#166 ; elements so as to vary the strength of the currents generated by them in those parts of the circuits connecting their poles .
In 1840 De la Rive* found that the action of a galvanic pair was accelerated when it was put into hot fluid instead of cold fluid , and he attributed the result to increased chemical affinity .
Faradayf repeated De la Rive 's experiment , but he , on the other hand , attributed the result to improved conductivity in the liquid , and he showed that the effect was not due either to motion , to .chemical action , or to thermo-electric action , or indeed to any increase in the electromotive force .
Daniell , J also , found an increased current due to increased temperature .
According to him , one of his elements was nearly trebled in strength when raised to 212 ' F. He attributed the effect to the increased energy of the affinity .
Said he , " Changes of temperature even have a marked influence upon the working of the voltaic battery , .and must not be neglected in nice comparative experiments .
