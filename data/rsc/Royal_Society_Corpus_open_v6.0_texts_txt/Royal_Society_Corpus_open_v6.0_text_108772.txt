THE researches which I beg , in the following pages , to submit to the Royal Society , embody the results obtained in the further development of an observation which I made a considerable number of years ago , and which , since that time , I had to defend against the objections of others , both by experimental inquiries of my own , and by the collection and discussion of facts elicited in the investigations of other observers .
As far back as 1841* I pointed out that in analogous compounds the same difference of composition frequently involves the same difference in boiling-points .
The assertion of the existence of this law-like relation between the chemical composition of substances and one of their most important physical properties , when first enunciated , met rather with the opposition than with the assent of chemists .
In Germany especially it was contested by SCHlRODER in his memoir " On the Molecular Volume of Chemical Compoundst .
" These objections led me to collect additional evidence : in favour of my views , and to show more particularly that in very extensive series of compounds ( alcohols C. H11+2 02 ; acids CnHt04 ; compound ethers CHnO04 , &amp;c. ) an elementary difference xC2H2 is attended by a difference of xX 19 ?
C. in the boiling-points , and how this fact is intimately connected with other regularities exhibited by the boiling-points of organic compounds .
Almost at the same period SCHRODER ?
convinced himself that the relation I had pointed out obtains in most cases .
He collected himself a considerable number of illustrations of the regularities I had traced , and showed that the relation in question is rendered more especially conspicuous if the compounds be expressed by formulae representing equal vapour-volumes of the several substances .
Some of the views , however , which were peculiar to SCHRODER have not gained the approbation of chemists .
This physicist was inclined to consider the boiling-point of a substance as the most essential criterion of its proximate constituents , as the most trustworthy indicator of its molecular constitution .
His views were chiefly based upon the assumption that the elementary difference C H2 , when occurring in alcohols C. H+ , , O2 , involved a difference of boiling-points other than that occasioned by the same elementary difference obtaining in acids Cn Hn 04 , and that the isomeric compound ethers differed from one another in their boiling-points .
An extensive series of boiling-point determinations* which I made of these isomeric ethers , proved that the latter assumption is not founded on facts .
The exertions made by SCHRODER , GERHARDT , LOWIG and others , in the hope of recognizing the influence of the constituent elements on the boiling-point of a compound , have also essentially remained without result t. In France the existence of the relations between composition and boiling-point which I had observed , has been contested by I. PIERRE$ , who determined the boiling-points of many organic compounds , while engaged in an inquiry regarding their expansion .
In England , lastly , W. A. MILLER ?
has likewise called attention to the discrepancies between the boiling-points observed by PIERRE and those calculated on the supposed existence of the relations which I had indicated .
I was , however , enabled 1 ] to remove these apparent discrepancies by the first results obtained in a long series of experimental observations of my own , in which , at intervals and as material and opportunities presented themselves , I have continued up to the present day .
The existence of the relations between composition and boiling-point , such as it results from my original observations , has , notwithstanding these objections , been generally acknowledged .
In many cases the recognition of these relations furnished important arguments in discussions regarding the true molecular value of organic compounds .
Chemists have observed a vast number of new illustrations , and for several series , in which the individual terms differ from each other by a constant elementary difference , the corresponding difference of boiling-point has been carefully determined ? .
Nevertheless , these relations , the important means of control which they afford in experimental inquiries , and the assistance which they are frequently capable of lending in the determination of the true chemical character of a new compound , have scarcely been sufficiently appreciated .
The rapid progress of organic chemistry has greatly expanded the material available for the discussion of boiling-points , and up to the latest date the stream of experimental inquiry , whilst confirming or correcting former observations , has furnished a rich supply of additional important facts .
The time has arrived when a survey of the territory safely acquired may be taken , and when from the boundary lines reached we may fix the directions in which we have next to advance .
A collection of my researches on this subject in a connected form , permitting this survey , and showing the results which may be expected from their application , I now beg leave to submit to the Royal Society , hoping that their attention may not be with* Ann. der Chem. und Pharm. vol. lv .

[ The careful manner in which A. 11 .
CIurcit ( Phil. Mag. [ 4 ] ix .
256 ) has determined the difference of the boiling-points for the series of hydrocarbons Cl , HI_6 , deserves especially to be mentioned .
held from a field where our knowledge , emanating from earlier observations , but expanded and consolidated more than ever before by recent experimental evidence , has already gained a solid foundation .
It is especially with regard to organic compounds that constant relations between boiling-point and composition have been demonstrated .
It often occurs that in the case of analogous compounds the same difference in the boiling-points corresponds to the same difference in the chemical formule , or that the differences in boiling-points and those in composition are proportional .
In different .
series of analogous compounds the same differences of boiling-point may correspond to the same differences of composition , but this does not obtain in all series .
The regularities exhibited by the boiling-points of organic compounds , and more especially the observation of the same difference of boiling-point corresponding to the same difference of composition , are limited to certain groups .
In other groups , the same difference in the formulae involves another difference in the boiling-points .
Among the earliest recognized regularities , comprising at the same time the largest number of compounds , are the following:-An alcohol CnHn+ O,2 which contains xC2H2 more or less than another , boils at a temperature xX19 ?
higher or lower .
An acid Cn H 04 , boils at a temperature 400 higher than the alcohol C nHn+ 20 , the oxidation of which may give rise to the acid .
A compound ether Cn Hn 04 , boils at a temperature 82 ?
lower than the acid Cn Hn 04 isomeric with it .
If we start from the boiling-point of ethyl-alcohol =78 ?
, these three propositions enable us to calculate the boiling-points of a large number of organic substances , alcohols , acids , and compound ethers , represented by the above general formulae , as given in the following Table : TABLE I. Calculated boiling-points .

There can be no doubt that if the boiling-points of other alcohols , acids , and ethers belonging to these series were correctly observed , they also would agree within a few degrees with those obtained by calculation .
The boiling-points given in Table 1 .
are closely connected with those of other monatomic alcohols with two equivalents of oxygen , of other monobasic acids with four equivalents of oxygen , and of the ethers generated by these acids and alcohols .
It is frequently observed that a compound of this kind , which , when compared with an analogous body of Table I. , contains xxC more or less , boils at a temperature xX 14 ?
5 higher or lower , or ( what amounts to the same thing ) that it boils at a temperature xX 5 ?
lower or higher , accordingly as it contains xXH more or less .
Benzoic acid , C,4 H6 04 , for example , contains 8C more than the acid C H6 04 , the boiling-point of which is stated in Table I. at 137 ? .
Consequently the boiling-point ofbenzoic acid will be 137+8 X 14 ?
'5=253 .
It contains 8H less than the acid C , , 114 , , for the boiling-point of which the Table gives 213 , and its boiling-point by calculation will be 213+8X5=253 .
Allyl-alcohol , C6 H 02 , contains 2C more than ethyl-alcohol , C4 H602 , which boils at 78 ?
; the calculated boiling-point of allyl-alcohol accordingly is 78+2 x14'5=107 ; or it may be compared to the alcohol C6 H1 02 , the boiling-point of which is 97 ?
( see Table I. ) , when the boiling-point of allyl-alcohol , which contains 2H less , will be found by calculation =-107 ( =97 +2 X 5 ) .
The following synopsis shows in how large a number of alcohols C , Hm O2 , of acids and ethers C. Hm 04 , the boiling-points obey this simple rule .
In perusing this Table , 261 it must be borne in mind that the observations of boiling-points comprised in the higher ranges of the thermometer are frequently less accurate .

The same regularity obtains in other series of analogous compounds , but by no means in all .
A few other groups may also be mentioned here , in which the observed boiling-points exhibit the above regularity , at all events within the limits of uncertainty usual in boiling-point determinations .

A few other series will be mentioned in a subsequent part of this paper .
Since , as I have already remarked , the regularity in question is not altogether general , it may often be doubtful whether it exists or not when the observations of the boiling-points present considerable discrepancies and uncertainties in several terms of an homologous series .
As an example , the following series may be quoted : TABLE IX .

The comparison of the boiling-points of the corresponding terms in the several series of homologous substances given in the preceding Tables , exhibits several other constant differences in the boiling-points for certain differences in the formulae .
In addition II 263 to those hitherto noticed , the following also deserve to be mentioned , since they are likewise observed in other compounds .
The foregoing Tables afford many illustrations of the facts , that the boiling-point of an acid lies 63 ?
higher than that of the methyl-ether , 440 higher than that of the ethyl-ether , and 13 ?
lower than that of the amyl-ether of the same acid .
These regularities appear to obtain in the case of acids other than those quoted .
The boiling-point of monochloracetic acid ( 185 ?
-1880 , R. HOFFMANN ) has been found about 440 higher than that of the monochloracetate of ethyl ( 143 ?
'5 , WILLM ) .
Starting from the boiling-point of trichloracetate of methyl ( 145 ?
, LAURENT ) , or from that of trichloracetate of ethyl ( 164 ?
, LEBLANC ) , the boiling-point of trichloracetic acid is found by calculation to be 208 ? .
DUMAS found it between 195 ?
and 200 ? .
From the boiling-point of monobromacetic acid , 208 ?
, observed by PERKIN and DUPPA , that of the corresponding methyl-ether may be calculated at 145 ?
, that of the ethyl-ether at 164 ?
, and that of the amyl-ether at 221 ? .
The results of observation are 144 ?
, 159 ?
, 207 ? .
They are not , however , entirely to be relied upon , since the ethers of monobromacetic acid , and especially those possessing higher boiling-points , are partially decomposed by ebullition .
In a few substances other than acids , the substitution of C4 H , for H is occasionally attended by a decrease of 44 ?
in the boiling-point ; that of C2 H1 for H by a decrease of 63 ? .
Ordinary ( ethyl ) ether , C8 HI 0H 2 boils at 340 , i. e. 44 ?
lower than ethyl-alcohol , C4 H6 0 ?
; methyl-amyl-ether , C , HI O at 720 ( WILLIAMSON ) , i. e. 63 ?
lower than amylalcohol , Cl0 H,1 O , .
If any doubt remained as to the expediency of representing ordinary ether by the formula C , H 0 , = ( C , H)(C4 , ) 0 , , instead of the formulsa C4 H O , this observation might be of some importance ; but the comparison of the boiling-points of alcohols and of so-called simple and mixed ethers , shows that the aforesaid regularity is not general , a circumstance arising from the fact of the elementary difference C2 H2 , in the series of ethers Cn Hn+2,02 involving a difference of boiling-points other than that corresponding to the elementary difference C2 H in the series of alcohols Cn Hn+2 02 .
The preceding Tables contain a great number of illustrations of the facts , that many compounds containing benzoyl ( C,1 H1 0 ?
) or benzyl ( C^14 H7 ) boil at a temperature 78 ?
higher than the corresponding compounds of valeryl ( C , ,o H 02 ) or of amyl ( C10 H , ) .
The benzoyland benzyl-compounds , when compared with the compounds of valeryl and amyl , contain 4C more and 4H less .
They boil mostly , in accordance with the rules given ( page 261 ) , at a temperature ( 4 X 140.5)+(4 X 50 ) = 780 higher .
In addition to the compounds , the boiling-points of which have already been given , the following exhibit the same regularity .
[ The mixed acetone A is the one obtained by the distillation of a mixture of an acetate and benzoate ; the acetone B is that formed by distilling an acetate and valerate .

This regularity does not , however , obtain in a general manner , as will be apparent by comparing the boiling-points of cyanide of phenyl ( benzonitrile , FEHLNG , KOPP , 191 ?
; LIMPRICHT , 192 ?
) and of cyanide of butyl ( valeronitrile , SCHLIEPER , 1250 ; GUCKELBERGER , from 125 ?

The boiling-points of the terms of several series which have been previously mentioned frequently almost coincide , a circumstance which furnishes a valuable means of controlling boiling-point observations .
If , for example , in a series of methyl-ethers , corresponding to various monobasic acids with four equivalents of oxygen , and in the chlorides of the radicals contained in the same acids , the boiling-points be found so near to each other as is shown in the following Table , -TABLE XI .

It is evident from the preceding Tables that phenyl-alcohol , acetate , cenanthylate , and caprylate of phenyl boil at a temperature 1160 higher than the corresponding ethyl-compounds ( phenyl contains 8C more than ethyl , 8X 14 ?
-5=1160 ) .
The same difference is not observed in all corresponding phenyland ethyl-compounds , yet it occurs in cases other than those already mentioned , or which may be readily inferred from the regularities previously alluded to .
Thus the boiling-point of iodide of phenyl ( SCRUGHAM , 1900 ) is likewise about 1160 higher than that of iodide of ethyl ( PIERRE , 700 ; ANDREWS , 710 ; FRANKLAND , 72 ?
) .
It deserves also to be noticed that the boiling-points of acetate of phenyl ( SCRUGHAM , 1880 ) and of iodide of phenyl ( SCRUGHAM , 1900 ) are as near to each other as those of acetate of ethyl ( 740 ) and of iodide of ethyl ( 700 ?
-720 ) ; and that the same difference is observed between the boiling-points of iodide of phenyl ( 1900 ) and of iodide of ethyl ( 700-720 ) as between those of chloride of phenyl ( SCRUGHAM , 136 ?
) and of chloride of ethyl ( PIERRE , 11 ?
; THENARD , 12 ?
) .
The compounds of allyl contain 2C more in their formulau than the corresponding ethyl-compounds .
The difference in the boiling-points 2 x14 ?
05=29 ?
occurs not only in the compounds already quoted ( the alcohols , acetates , butyrates , valerates , benzoates ) , but also approximately at least in the cyanates ( cyanate of ethyl 60 ?
, according to WURTZ ; cyanate of allyl 82 ?
, according to CAHOURS and IOFMANN ) ; in the iodides ( iodide of ethyl 70 ?
, according to PIERRE ; 72 ?
, according to FRANiLAND ; iodide of allyl 1010 , according to BERTHELOT and LUCA ) ; in the ethyl-ethers ( ordinary ethyl-ether , QB H , , 0 , , 34 ?
; allylethyl-ether , C , , H , , 0 , , 620.5 , according to BERTHELOT and LUCA ) ; and even in the aldehydes ( acetic aldehyde , C4 H1 02 , 200 , according to KOpp ; 220 , according to LIEBIG and to PIERRE ; acrolein , C0 H1 O , about 52 ?
, according to REDTENBACHER ) .
But in the case also of corresponding ethyl and allyl compounds , the difference in the boiling-points is by no means altogether constant , as is apparent from a comparison of the boiling-points of sulphocyanide of ethyl ( 1460 , according to CAnOURS ) and of sulphocyanide of allyl ( 1430 , according to DUMAS and PELOUZE ; 148 ?
, according to WILL ; 151 ?
, according to KoPP ) .
If , on comparing the parallel terms of different series of compounds , we do not quite generally meet with the same difference in the boiling-points corresponding to the same difference in composition , this fact arises from the circumstance that the same difference in the formulae by no means involves the same difference of boiling-point in all series of homologous substances .
For the series of the monatomic alcohols with two equivalents of oxygen , of the monobasic acids with four equivalents of oxygen , of the ethers to which both classes give rise , as well as for a few other series of homologous substances ( see Table VIII .
) , the elementary difference x C2 H2 seems to involve a difference of boiling-point x 19 ?
; but there are other series of homologous bodies in which the same elementary difference is positively attended by another , greater or smaller , difference of boiling-point .
This difference is greater , for example , in the series of hydrocarbons C. H , _ , , in which it amounts to about 24 ? .

* In the ethers of the acids Cn Hn-2 08 , homologous to oxalic acid , the difference in boiling-point corresponding to the elementary difference C2 H2 seems to be about 14 ?
; this number , however , is somewhat uncertain , as boiling-points rather differing from one another have in some cases been observed for isomeric ethers .
Isomeric with the latter , or belonging to the same series , are those ethers derived from the glycols C , H , nO2 0 by the action of two equivalents of an acid Cn HI 04 .

The difference is also less than 19 ?
in the carbonates , the sulphocyanides , the borates of the alcohol radicals Cn Hn+ , , and in the bromides of the diatomic radicals Cn Hn TPATT TV YT Diff. , ^ There can be no doubt that in different series of homologous compounds the difference of boiling-point corresponding to the elementary difference x C2 H2 may vary ; that frequently it is found to be xX 19 ?
, but sometimes more , sometimes less .
As to these inequalities of differences , they are sure to be governed by a more general law , which will probably be recognized when a sufficient number of boiling-points shall have been determined under a pressure different from the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere ; for it cannot by any means be taken for granted that two substances will exhibit the same difference of boiling-point , whatever may be the pressure .
Let S and S , be the boiling-points of two liquids under the ordinary pressure , and s and s , the boiling-points under another pressure .
Then the assumption of S-S , =s--s , would involve the inference S--=SS--s , ; i. e. that the boiling-points must undergo precisely the same change for the same change of pressure .
But this conclusion , the so-called law of DALTON , is by no means correct ; and it may be legitimately held that the homologous substances which under the ordinary pressure do not exhibit the most frequently observed difference of boiling-point ( 190 ) for the elementary difference C2 H , would certainly show that difference under a different pressure .
Sufficient data are still wanting for the appreciation of the mode in which differences in boiling-points are affected by changes of pressure .
But the extent of these alterations may in a measure be inferred from the fact that the difference in boiling-points of alcohol and ether , which , under the ordinary pressure , amounts to about 44 ?
, from what is known with respect to the vapour-tension of these two substances at different temperatures , would , under the pressure of half an atmosphere , be above 45 ?
, and below 40 ?
under a pressure of three atmospheres .
From the observations at present at our disposal , it may be affirmed as a general rule , that in homologous compounds belonging to the same series , the differences in boilingpoints are proportional to the differences of the formule .
Exceptions obtain only in cases in which terms of a particular group are rather difficult to prepare , or when the substances boil at a very high temperature , at which the observations now at our command are for the most part uncertain .
Again , it may be affirmed that the difference in boiling-points corresponding to the elementary difference C2 H2 , is in a great many series =19 ?
; in some series more , in some series less .
There are a few quite exceptional cases in which the higher terms of a homologous series boil at a lower temperature than the inferior terms .
A case in point exists according to WURTZ in the glycols .

The ethers which arise from the combination of these bodies with acids C HO 04 , exhibit on the other hand boiling-points rising with the increasing number of carbonatoms .
And this remark applies not only to those ethers of the glycols which contain two molecules of an acid-radical ( compare Table XX .
) , but also to those in which only one of the two basic hydrogen , equivalents of ethyl-glycol is replaced by an acid-radical .

One more example of a compound exhibiting a boiling-point lower than that of its lower homologue is offered by the cyanurates of methyl and ethyl .
According toWURTZ 's earlier experiments , cyanurate of methyl , C2Hg9N306 , boils at 295 ?
; according to a later observation , at 274 ?
; cyanurate of ethyl , C , ,8 H , , N3 06 , according to the earlier observation , at 276 ?
; according to the later , at 253 ? .
The boiling-points of the cyanic ethers , on the other hand , rise with the increase of the number of carbon-atoms ; cyanate of methyl , C,4 HN 02 ( boiling-point 400 , WURTZ ) , and cyanate of ethyl , C6 H5 N 02 ( boilingpoint 600 , WURTZ ) , exhibit the difference of boiling-points usual in this kind of ethers .
Isomeric compounds belonging to the same type , and possessing the same chemical character , have the same boiling-point .
This seems to follow from the boiling-points , such as have been observed for isomeric ethers C , Hn 04 ( Table IV .
) ; for ethers C , H , g 04 and Cn Hn-_04 ( Table VII .
) ; and for so-called simple and mixed radicals Cn H+2 ( Table XIV .
) .
Boiling-points , which at any rate very nearly approach each other , have also been observed for the isomeric ethers Cn Hn+2 O0 ( see Table XVI .
) .
For the isomeric ethers Cn H , _2 O8 , observation has hitherto yielded boiling-points which sometimes agree , sometimes differ .
As yet no sufficient grounds exist for attributing different boilingpoints to isomeric compounds of the same type and the same chemical character .
It may sometimes be difficult experimentally to prove the identity of the boiling-point of two such compounds as an ethyl-ether and the isomeric methyl-compound .
The methylcompounds have in general so great a tendency to boil irregularly , and at temperatures anomalously raised , that quiet ebullition permitting the observation of the correct boiling-point is often scarcely to be attained .
Isomeric compounds belonging to the same type , but possessing a different chemical character , have different boiling-points .
This is evident , e. g. , from a comparison of the acids and ethers C0 H , O4 ( Tables III .
and IV .
) ; of the acids and ethers CnH , -H 04 , C H , _8 04 or Cn H1_ , 04 ( Tables VI .
and VII .
) ; of the alcohols and ethers Cn Hn+2 ( Tables II .
and XVI .
) ; of the mercaptans and the sulphur-compounds isomeric with them C , Hn,2 S , ( Table XVIII .
) .
Isomeric compounds belonging to different types have different boiling-points .
Allylalcohol , C , H60 , , boils ( CAHOUns and HOFMANN ) at 103 ? .
( From Table V. this boilingpoint was calculated at 107 ? .
) Acetone , C6 H6 0 , isomeric with the former , boils at 56 ?
( LIEBIG , DUMAS , KOPP ) .
In cases like the last , the determination of the boiling-point of a compound , together with an examination of the substances with which the compound is serially allied in boiling-point , may be of great assistance in fixing its character , the type to which it belongs , and the series of homologous bodies of which it is a term .
The examples just quoted of the fact that isomeric substances of different series possess different boilingpoints , may here again serve as illustrations .
The boiling-point of the so-called eugenic acid ( BRUNING , 248 ?
; WILLIAMS , 251 ?
) shows that this substance , althougli represented by the formula C20 12 04 , , cannot possibly be homologous to benzoic acid , C14 H6 O4 ( boiling-point observed by KoPP , 250 ?
; calculated , Table VI .
, 253 ?
) .
This result might be inferred with the greatest probability from the boiling-point of the two substances , even if cuminic acid , isomeric with eugenic acid , and the homologue of benzoic acid , were not known .
On the other hand , when the boiling-points of eugenic acid and of hydride of salicyl , Cl , H , 60 ( boiling-point 1960 , PIRIA ) , are considered , it becomes extremely probable that these two bodies are homologous .
( To the difference in composition , C6H6= 3 C2H2 , corresponds in this case the difference in boiling-points 250--196=54=3 x18 ? .
) The boiling-points of polymeric compounds are also different , and may serve to determine the formula representing a substance .
Among the isomeric compounds , in the narrower sense of the word , acids and ethers formula CnHn2 02 e. g. ) , exhibit in all their bearings an essentially different character .
Less striking is the difference of chemical character in the various volatile bases ; and it is only since the last ten years that distinctive features have been traced in several classes of these bases , which have accordingly been subdivided into primary , secondary , and tertiary monamines .
The basic character possessed by all these substances has induced many to compare their boiling-points also , without duly considering to which of the several classes they might belong .
But in this case , again , a comparison of boiling-points is admissible only for such bases as belong to one and the same of the abovementioned classes .
The same formula , C1 H13 N , represents amylamine , propyl-ethylamine , and methyl-diethylamine ; but of these three bases , only the first can be compared , as to boiling-point , with methylamine and ethylamine as a true homologue .
The three isomeric bases above mentioned have indeed different boiling-points , just as ethylalcohol and methyl-ether , isomeric compounds ( both C4 11602O ) , have different boilingpoints .
We may , however , expect that methyl-propylamine and diethylamine , both isomeric bases of the same chemical character ( both secondary monamines ) , will have the same boiling-point , just as in the case of the isomeric ethers of the same chemical character , propionate of methyl and acetate of ethyl .
Homologous bases of the common formula Cn H , _s N appear to exhibit , at least approximately , for a difference in the formulae =x C2 H2 a difference in boiling-points = x 19 ? .
The temperatures of ebullition quoted in the following Tables under the head " assumed , " thus calculated , pretty nearly coincide with the results of observation .

The isomeric bases C Hn_ N , belonging to different classes , have different boilingpoints .
The discrepancies are by no means great in the case of the isomeric terms of the primary and secondary monamines , but considerable enough in the case of the tertiary monamines compared with the two previous classes , so that the bases belonging to the third class may be distinctly recognized .
Dimethylaniline may be expected to exhibit the same boiling-point as collidine , isomeric with it , and likewise a tertiary monamine .
The relation mentioned ( page 261 ) , viz. that for certain classes of alcohols , acids and ethers , a boiling-point xX 140 ?
5 higher or lower corresponds to xC more or less in the formula , is in general not observed on comparing the bases of the first and second class ; but the boiling-points of a large number of tertiary monamines , such as they are calculated from the ( assumed ) boiling-points of the last Table , coincide tolerably well with the results of observation .

Accordingly in the last two series also the difference in boiling-point ( 19 ?
) seems , at all events approximately , to correspond to the elementary difference C2 1 H. We meet , however , with an exception in the boiling-point of trimethylamine , C6H9 N , a base likewise belonging to the tertiary monamines , which , according to WINKLES , lies between 4 ?
and 5 ?
0 The general formula Cn Hn+3 N represents volatile bases of the three classes .
What is known with regard to the boiling-points of the tertiary monamines has already been stated .
With respect to the secondary , HOFMANN'S determination of the boilingpoints of diethylamine , C8 H , ] N , 57 ?
' 5 , of diamylamine , C20 H1 N , =about 170 ?
, also exhibits for the difference of composition x C2 H , a difference in boiling-points of 19 ?
( 170--57=6X19 ?
) .
The difference is greater for the primary bases CH +3N ; the boiling-points assumed in the following Table are based on the supposition that it equals 25 ? .

In the case of the bases C Hn+ N , it does not appear that the isomeric terms belonging to the classes of secondary and tertiary monamines can be distinguished by means * The trimethylamine used by M. WINKLES , in determining the boiling-point , had been prepared from the brine of salted herrings .
Whilst Professor KoPp 's paper was passing through the press , I had an opportunity of determining the boiling-point of perfectly pure trimethylamine , prepared by the action of potassa on iodide of tetramethylammonium .
This determination , made with about 10 grms. of base , gave the boiling-point 9 ?
'3 .
The ebullition of trimethylamine exhibits the irregularity so frequently observed in methyl-compounds .
When the liquid ceases to boil freely , the thermometer is observed to indicate as much as 14 ?
and even 15 ?
, but the mercury falls again suddenly to 9 ?
'3 , when ebullition recommences .
It deserves to be noticed , that trimethylphosphine exhibits a similarly discrepant boiling-point .
The boiling-point of trimethylphosphine was found between 40 ?
and 42 ?
, that of triethylphosphine being 127 ?

W. H. ; of their boiling-points ; but the boiling-points of the primary monamines greatly differ from those of the isomeric bases of the two previous classes .
Constant relations then between the boiling-points and the formulae of the volatile organic compounds may be said to have been most positively established by the preceding statements .
Their existence cannot be called in question on account of their not always being manifested exactly in the same manner .
Such uniformity would obtain if in all homologous series the difference in boiling-points corresponding to the difference of composition C , H were equally great ; if , as a general rule , on comparing two corresponding pairs of compounds the same difference in composition were found to involve the same difference in boiling-point .
The fact of these relations obtaining in a less general and simple manner renders their perception , as also their use in determining the formulae of chemical compounds , more difficult , but does not set them aside , any more than the existence of a relation between chemical composition and crystalline form could be denied , on account of its not always manifesting itself in the simplest form , or the assistance be doubted , which the study of crystalline form often renders in establishing the formula of a substance , because compounds of altogether different atomic constitution may possess the same form , or compounds of analogous constitution , even containing so-called isomorphous elements , are observed to crystallize in forms altogether different .
Relations between boiling-point and composition have been more especially proved in organic compounds ; very many of them , being volatile at comparatively low temperatures , admit of their boiling-point being accurately determined .
It is , however , in the nature of the case that they should not be limited to the domain of organic chemistry .
Nevertheless relations of this description have not hitherto been comprehensively proved to exist in inorganic bodies .
Tribromide of arsenic , As Br , ( boiling-point 220 ?
) , and trichloride of arsenic , As Cl , ( 133 ?
) , exhibit nearly the same difference as oxybromide of phosphorus , PO , Br3 ( 1950 ) , and oxychloride of phosphorus , PO2 C13 ( 1100 ) , and also nearly the same as the following organic compounds ( exhibiting a similar difference in their formulae ) , bromoform , C , H Br3 ( 152 ?
) , and chloroform , CH C13 ( 62 ?
) .
In these cases the substitution of 3 Br for 3 C1 is attended by an elevation of the boiling-point amounting to from 85 ?
to 90 ?
=3 X 28 to 3X 30 .
But the substitution of x Br for x C1 by no means involves invariably an elevation of the boiling-point of from x 28 ?
to x 300 .
Although earlier observations had pointed to these simple relations , and raised the hope that a knowledge of the differences in the boiling-points of corresponding bromine and chlorine compounds would be available for ascertaining how many equivalents of bromine in a substance are substituted for chlorine in another , yet the determination of the boilingpoints of a very large number of corresponding bromine and chlorine compounds has unmistakeably shown that so simple a relation does not obtain , and cannot therefore throw any light upon the formule of such substances .
The recognition then of definite relations between composition and boiling-point is for the present chiefly limited to organic compounds .
For the majority of these compounds , and indeed for the more important ones , this relation assumes the form of a simple law , which , more especially for the monatomic alcohols Cn Hm 0 , , for the monobasic acids Cn H 04 , and for the compound ethers C H , 0 , , generated by the union of the two previous classes , is proved in the most general manner ; so much so , indeed , that in many cases the determination of the boiling-point furnishes most material assistance in fixing the true character and position of a compound .
And it deserves more especially to be noticed , that the simplest and most comprehensive relations have been recognized for those classes of organic compounds which have been longest known and most accurately investigated ; and that even for those classes , the generality and simplicity of the relation , on account of numerous boiling-points incorrectly observed at an earlier date , appeared in the commencement doubtful , and could be more fully acknowledged only after a considerable number of new determinations .
Thus we are justified in hoping that in other classes also of compounds in which simple and comprehensive relations have not hitherto been traced , these relations will become perceptible as soon as the verification of the boiling-points of terms already known , and the examination of new terms , shall have laid a broader foundation for our conclusions .
