( Abstract .
) All abstract of a great part of the present paper has appeared in the 'Proceedings , ' vol. viii .
p. 556 .
To the experiments then adduced a large number have since been added , which have been made by whirling thermometers and thermo-electric junctions in the air .
The result shows that at high velocities the thermal effect is proportional to the square of the velocity , the rise of temperature of the whirled body being evidently that due to the communication of the velocity to a constantly renewed film of air .
With very small velocities of bodies of large surface , the thermal effect was very greatly increased by that kind of fluid friction the effect of which on the motion of p)endulums has been investigated by Professor Stokes .
