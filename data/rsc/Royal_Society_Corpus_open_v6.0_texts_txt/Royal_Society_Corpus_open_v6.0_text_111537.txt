( Abstract .
) In the present communication the author endeavours to show , that the involuntary muscular tissue of the bladder and the voluntary muscle in other parts of the human body have a like composition , and that Prof. Kolliker 's view , that involuntary or smooth muscle is made up of fusiform cells , is incorrect .
On the contrary , the muscular substance of the bladder is composed of lengthened fibres with fixed and tendinous terminal attachments .
The fasciculi of muscular fibres in the bladder are interwoven into a network , and are marked at varying intervals by tendinous intersections , like those of the Rectus abdominis on a small scale .
The author terms what are usually called the 'nuclei ' of the muscular tissue- ' corpuscles , ' and ( listinguishes two varieties of them , the oval and the fusiform .
The latter are the more numerous , and are the rod-like nuclei of Kolliker .
Two or even three of these may be observed in the length of a single fibre .
If a single muscular fibre of the bladder is isolated , it will be found to terminate as in voluntary muscle ; connective tissue investing not only the fibre , but each of the separate portions into which it ultimately divides .
The author considers that the 'sarcous elements ' of voluntary muscle are represented by the lines of dots visible in the muscular fibres of the bladder. .
