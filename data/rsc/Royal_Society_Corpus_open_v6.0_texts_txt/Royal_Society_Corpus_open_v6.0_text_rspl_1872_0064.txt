this amount of heat ; and when the glowing charcoal , in the case of Jeypoorite , is afterwards held under the nose , a distinct and even strong smell of garlic is perceived .
If fusion of the gold takes place , this smell ceases immediately .
There is also emitted from thus treated another very peculiar but indescribable smell , after that of garlic has ceased .
This I believe to be due to volatilizing antimony ; and the fact is , so far as I know , unnoticed by writers on the " blowpipe " since the time of Cronstedt ; but VonEngestrom says of this metal ( Translation of Cronstedt 's 'Mineralogy/ by Gustav von Engestrom , London , 1772 , p. 308 ) , " Antimony is known by its particular smell , easier to be distinguished , when once known , than described .
" The corrosion of platinum by Jeypoorite powder , mixed with a large amount of rust , when roasted through it , is also ( in my opinion ) a strong proof of the existence of sulphide of antimony ( vide " Pyrology , " par .
80 ) ; for in this case I found that , thus roasted , Jeypoorite considerably , and even pure Sb203 slightly corroded the platinum , while native arsenic and arsenic acid did not do so at all .
( 21 ) When the gold ball , placed with a crystal of Jeypoorite on charcoal , as described in ( 20 ) , is fused by an O. P. , the surrounding ash of the charcoal is observed to be tinged with a beautiful rose tint .
This phenomenon appears to be due to the formation of arseniate of cobalt , and to be analogous to that of Erythrine in nature , where the cobalt oxide , combining with arsenic acid , is hydrated with the water absorbed chemically from the atmosphere by the latter .
Cronstedt ( ' Essay towards a System of Mineralogy/ Lond. 1772 , Sect , ccxlvi .
p. 230 ) notices this fact under the article " Cobalt , " which , he says , " when united with the calx of arsenic in a slow ( not a brisk ) calcining heat , assumes a red colour : the same colour is naturally produced by way of efflorescence , and is then called the bloom or flowers of cobalt .
" The fact proves the truth of Gmelin 's assertion , that fusing gold takes up a certain portion of arsenic* Another proof seems shown in the fact that the gold ball thus treated , assumes on the surface , when rapidly and momentarily heated , a dark reddish , and even a copper-coloured yellow , which may be the so-called " rose-colour " said to be given to gold by Indian goldsmiths , but which I have never yet seen in any part of India .

" On a Periodicity of Rainfall in connexion with the Sun-spot Periodicity .
" By C. Meldrum , Director of the Meteorological Observatory , Mauritius .
Communicated by Sir Edward Sabine , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received April 6,1873 .
Assuming that there is a sun-spot periodicity , in the course of which the sun undergoes a variation with respect to heat or some other form of energy , we should expect to find a corresponding variation in the state of our atmosphere , 298 Mr. C. Meldrum on [ May 15 ; With this idea , it was some time ago determined to discuss the cyclones that had occurred during the last twenty-five years in the Southern Indian Ocean , and it was found , what had been often ' surmised , that they were more frequent and more violent in the maxima than in the minima sunspot years .
It is well known that the cyclones of the Indian Ocean are attended with much rain , which is not confined to the body of the storm , but extends over wide areas .
Years remarkable for cyclones , therefore , should be also years remarkable for rain ; but to test this inference , with regard to the Indian Ocean , we had no rainfall statistics , except eighteen years ' observations at Mauritius : and these were in every respect favourable , the rainiest years having been those in which cyclones were most abundant .
In the absence of other data , the Brisbane and Adelaide rainfalls were consulted ; and it was found that , like the Mauritius rainfall , they indicated a periodicity .
It was then surmised that there might be a rainfall periodicity generally , and that , if such was the case , both it and the cyclone periodicity were concomitant effects of one and the same cause .
This supposition having been strengthened by the results of an examination of the rainfall of England , it was resolved to examine all the rainfall-tables ( containing one or more sun-spot periods ) that could be obtained .
The first step was to ascertain whether there was any marked difference in the amount of rainfall at or about the turning-points of the sunspot period .
This has been done for eighteen stations by adding the rainfall in the three principal years of maxima , and in the three principal years of minims , sun-spots , and then comparing the results .

The annual rainfall at these stations is given in a subjoined Table , from which we obtain the following results , showing the rainfall at each station for maximum- and minimum-sunspot periods of three years each , the maximum- and minimum-sunspot years being respectively placed in the middle of each three-year period , as will be seen on reference to the Table .

In some instances we cannot get three-year periods with the maximum Mr. C. Meldrum a connexion [ May 15 , or minirrmim year in the middle .
This happens in the following cases:\#151 ; In the Aberdeen series , 1865\#151 ; 67 has been taken for 1866-68 , because we have not the observations for 1868 .
In the Deanston-House series 1837-39 has been taken for 1836-38 , the series commencing with 1837 .
In the Demerara observations 1854-56 has been taken in place of 1855-57 , the series ending with 1856 .
The years 1870-72 have , in the Mauritius series , been taken for three maxima-years ; but if 1872 be the maximum-sunspot year , and the three principal maxima-years be 1871-73 , the ram-fall for these years will probably be still greater ; for since the 1st of January 1873 , 38 inches of rain have fallen .
The means of two years have been taken in the Brisbane observations , the series commencing with 1860 and ending with 1871 .
In the Calcutta and Toronto series we have taken the one maximum-period , and the mean of the two minima-periods .
These slight deviations , as will be afterwards seen , do not affect the general results .
Now , collecting the sums of the rainfall in the maxima- and minima-periods of three years each , we get the following Table\#151 ; Table II .

Now we see that , in the maximum-sunspot periods of three years each , the rainfall at the eighteen stations was 395-85 inches greater than in the minimum-sunspot 1873 .
] between Rainfall and Sun-spot Periodicity .
301 periods of three years each , and , which is still more striking , that the excess is on the side of the maxima-periods at fifteen out of the eighteen stations .
In the last three columns I have given the total rainfall for the single maxima-years 1817 , 1830 , 1837 , 1849 , and 1860 , and for the single minima-years 1823 , 1834 , 1844 , 1856 , and 1857 , with the excesses and defects ; and we find a total excess of 105*36 inches in favour of the maxima-years , only five stations showing an excess on the other side .
The unfavourable stations are Toronto , Calcutta , and Natal ; and it should be remarked that at Toronto^ the snow was not melted , but one tenth of its depth taken to represent an equivalent depth of water , while Mr. Blarifone , the meteorological reporter to the Bengal Government , has expressed a doubt as to the accuracy of the Calcutta observations in the earlier part of the series .
If , however , we had taken the years 1847-49 in place of 1848-50 for the maximum-period , the Calcutta observations would have given a different result .
With regard to Natal , the geographical peculiarities described by Dr. Mann probably render that station unfavourable for showing in a few years any periodicity that may exist .
Having ascertained , then , that there is at nearly all the above stations a very remarkable difference in the amount of rainfall at or near the turning-points of the sun-spot period , the next step is to find the effect of grouping the observations .
For this purpose we give , in the first place , the rainfall at as many stations as possible in each minimum-sunspot year , and in each two or three years on either side of it ; and , in the second place , we give the rainfall for each maximum-year and two or three years on either side of it .
If we do not find any tendency to an equalization of the annual rainfall , we shall have further proof of a periodicity .

Comparing Tables IX .
and XIII .
, we find that the mean rainfall in the minimum-sunspot years 1834 , 1844 , 1856 , and 1866 was 27*38 inches , and in the maximum-sunspot years 1836 , 1848 , and 1861 , 35*83 inches , giving an excess of 8*45 inches .
With the exception of 1842 , all the years of minimum and maximum rainfall shown by the Tables are within a fraction of the corresponding minmum- and maximum-sunspot year .
The last Table I beg to present is one showing the annual fall at eighteen stations .
An inspection of it will show that , generally , \#174 ; the maxima-periods of those years give each more rainfall than any other three consecutive years , and the minima-periods less rain than any other three consecutive years , in each set of observations .
There are no doubt errors of observation , as well as discrepancies , arising from changing the forms and positions of the gauges ; and it is difficult to believe that more correct observations would not have given still more remarkable results .
