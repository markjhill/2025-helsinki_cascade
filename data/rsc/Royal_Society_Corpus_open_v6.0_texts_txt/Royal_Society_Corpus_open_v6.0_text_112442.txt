Codeia and morphia are , as is well known , homologous , only differing in composition by CH2 .
Both of them contain one atom of hydrogen replaceable by organic radicals , from which it appears that methyl-morphia X 1845 .

( which does not contain a replaceable atom of hydrogen ) is only isomeric with codeia , and not identical .
If , therefore , codeia be morphia where H is replaced by CH , , the atom of hydrogen so replaced must be one of those contained in one of the radicals which enter into the composition of morphia .

( 4 ) In order to examine the nature of the reaction taking place , some codeia ( forming part of a supply of 10 oz. given to us by the eminent manufacturing chemists , Messrs. M'Farlane , of Edinburgh ) was submitted to experiment .
The substance used when examined for morphia failed to indicate the presence of the smallest trace , was wholly soluble in ether , and , on combustion with oxide of copper and oxygen , after drying at 120 ?
, yielded the following numbers:0*3720 gramme gave 0'9830 carbonic acid and 0'2450 water .

for two or three hours .
After cooling , a layer of colourless liquid was observed floating on the top of the brown tarry contents .
It immediately became gaseous on opening the tubes , and was presumedly chloride of methyl , as the issuing gases were found to be free from carbonic acid .
The residue in the tubes , when dissolved in water and precipitated by carbonate of sodium , yielded , on extraction with ether and agitation with hydrochloric acid , a crystalline chloride having , when purified by recrystallization , all the properties of the chloride ofapomorphia derived from morphia .
It gave the same qualitative reactions , produced the same remarkable physiological effects , and yielded the following numbers on combustion with chromate of lead and oxygen:0'3120 gramme gave 017680 carbonic acid and 0*1740 water .

Doubtless there is an intermediate reaction , viz. either that indicated by formula ( 3 ) , where morphia is the intermediate product , or that in accordance with ( 2 ) , where a base homologous with apomorphia , and thence called apocodeia , is first produced , and subsequently split up into apomorphia and chloride of methyl , thusApocodeia .

We are at present engaged in investigating the nature of this intermediate reaction .
