IT has been shown * that the conducting-power of several of the pure metals decreased between 0 ?
and 100 ?
to the same extent , namely 29-307 per cent. On continuing the research with other metals and alloys , we have found that thallium and iron form an exception to the above ; and in the following we will describe the experiments made with these metals .
The thallium was kindly lent to us by Mr. CRooKES , the discoverer of this new metal , who with great readiness placed a small quantity of it at our disposal .
On account of its extreme softness ( for it is much softer than pure lead ) , it was easily cut with a knife to fit one of the small presses described in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' ( February 1857 ) , and pressed without the application of heat .
The wire , as soon as it came out of the small hole of the press , passed into a tube filled with water ; for although the metal readily oxidizes in air , yet it may be kept under water , free from air , for some time without oxidation .
When , however , the wire is exposed to the air for a short time , it loses its lustre and is soon covered with a coating of oxide , which , as in the cases of lead and zinc , protects in a great measure the metal from further oxidation .
The error caused by the slight oxidation during the short time we were obliged to manipulate with the wire in air may therefore be overlooked , more especially as wires of the same piece of metal showed the same conducting-power when pressed at different times .
Now , if the slight oxidation had any marked effect , we ought to have found great differences in the conducting-power of different wires , for it can scarcely be supposed that in all cases the same amount of oxidation had taken place .
Again , although thallium appears to be attacked by alcohol , yet we found we might varnish the wire with a solution of shell-lac in alcohol ; for the small quantity of alcohol contained in the first coating of varnish volatilizes so quickly that it has very little time to act on the wire ; in fact the resistance of the wire was found to be the same when determined before being varnished , and after three or four coatings of varnish had dried on it .
The reason of varnishing the wire was to protect the metal from the action of the hot oil .
The apparatus and precautions taken whilst determining the conducting-powers at different temperatures have already been fully describedt .

3 E made of German silver ; these were compared with the gold-silver alloy * , and the values so obtained for their resistances reduced , for the sake of comparison with former observations , to that of a hard-drawn silver wire whose conducting-power at 0 ?
0 is equal to 100 , that of a hard-drawn gold-silver wire being then 15-03 at that temperature .
As in the case of wires of most other metals , those of thallium were found to alter in conductingpower after having been kept at 1000 for some time .
It was therefore necessary to heat them for several days until their conducting-power showed no longer any alteration after cooling to the original temperature .
The length of the wire experimented with was 158 millims. , and its diameter 0-502 millim. O Reduced to 0 ?

To check the above value another wire was made , and its conducting-power determined .
The length of the wire was 187 millims. , its diameter 0*421 millim. , and the conducting-power found was 8-610 at 15 ?

Now the first observation made with the first wire was 9-29 at 0 ?

equal to 9-23 .
Although we had already found , as will be shown in the following , that the conducting-power of iron decreases between 0 ?
and 1000 more than 29-307 per cent. , the mean value deduced from the percentage decrements of eleven metals , yet we thought it would be interesting to check the above results , and we therefore applied to Professor LA-ML , of Lille , for a specimen of the metal , who with great kindness lent us twosmall bars prepared at different times .
The results obtained with these specimens fully confirm those obtained with Mr. CROOKES 's metal , both in respect to the conductingpower and to the percentage decrement .

As thallium in many respects resembles lead , it seemed to us of peculiar interest to see whether in its electric behaviour it would resemble that metal , namely , if when alloyed with tin , cadmium , or zinc , the conducting-power of the alloy would be equal to the mean conducting-power of the volumes of the component metals .
We are indebted to Mr. CROOKES for an alloy of thallium and tin containing only traces of the latter metal , and on testing its conducting-power we found it lower than that of pure thallium , showing that the addition of a better conductor ( the conducting-power of tin being at 0 ? ?
12*366 ) causes a decrement in the conducting-power of the metal .
Again , we alloyed a portion of M. LAMY'S thallium with traces of cadmium ; and here we also found the above observation confirmed ( the conducting-power of cadmium being at 0 ? ?
23*725 ) .
Thallium , therefore , appears to belong to that class of metals* which , when alloyed with lead , tin , cadmium , or zinc , or with one another , do not conduct electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes , but always in a lower degree than the mean of their volumes , and not to that class of metals to which lead belongs , namely , those which when alloyed with one another conduct electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes , Respecting the conducting-power of the alloys of thallium , we shall discuss them in our paper " 'On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting-Power of Alloys , " which will shortly be ready for publication .
We are greatly indebted to the kindness of Professor PERCY , who placed at our disposal the specimens of iron used for the following experiments ; in fact , with the exception of the two last , they are all from his collection .
As several of them have been analysed by Mr. TOOKEY in his laboratory , the results we have obtained will be the more interesting , as they show how traces of foreign matter influence the conducting-power of iron .
We will first give the numerical results , and then make some remarks on them .

The strips were very thin and porous ; we could not , therefore , obtain concordant values for the conducting-power , but were able to determine the percentage decrement in the conductingr power between 0 ?

This specimen formed the basis for some experiments made by Dr. PERCY on the absorption of carbon by iron , and was cut from the same piece of foil as Nos. 10 , 11 , 12 .
The strips of foil were first annealed in a current of dry hydrogen at a red heat for about two hours .
No. 9 was therefore annealed in hydrogen , Nos. 10 , 11 , 12 treated first with No. 9 , and then separately under a layer of sugar charcoal in a current of hydrogen for different lengths of time .
They were all hardened .
Dr. PERCY'S experiments have not yet been published , but he informs us they will be given in his work on Metallurgy .

We may here mention the reason of our having taken only observations at three intervals between O0 and 1000 .
It was found that almost the same formula may be deduced from three observations as from seven or more , if the temperature of the second observation is exactly the mean of the other two .
Now as at each interval we always made three observations , it was easy with a little practice to regulate the temperature so as to obtain the wished-for temperature as mean .
Of course sometimes we had to make four , five , or more observations in order to bring out the desired temperature .
By only taking observations at three intervals , the labour of the research , especially of the calculations , was materially diminished .

13-774 33-801 If we look at the above Table , the following important fact will be obvious , namely , the higher the conducting-power the higher the percentage decrement in the conductingpower between 0 ?
and 100 ?
; in fact we have always found this to be the case ; and from experiments made with about 100 alloys in this direction we have not found a single case where the percentage decrement in the conducting-power between 0 ?
and 100 ?
is greater than that of the pure metals ; further , we have found that we may deduce the conducting-power of the pure metal from that of the impure one when the impurity in it does not reduce it more than , say , 10 to 20 per cent. ; for we have proved experimentally that within those limits the percentage decrement between 00 and 100 ?
in the conductingpower of an impure metal varies in the same ratio as the conducting-power of the impure metal at 100 ?
, compared with that of the pure metal at 1000 .
Thus the percentage decrement in the conducting-power of pure iron between 0 ?
and 100 ?
is 38-261 per cent. , that of No. 5 , 36 07 per cent. Now , if the above statement be correct , by 3 8'261 multiplying the conducting-power of No. 5 at 100 ?
by 36070g we shall obtain the conducting-power of the pure metal at 1000 , and the conducting-power at 0 ?
by dividing that number by 0-61734 .
In the following Table we give the results of such a calculation with those specimens of iron the conducting-powers of which do not vary more than 20 per cent. from that deduced for the pure metal .

16809 The reason for making the above deduction will be fully explained in our paper " On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting-power of Alloys .
" One glance , however , will show that the deduced values agree as well together as can be expected , considering that the results may be modified by the presence of carbon , sulphur , &amp;c. In cases where we may assume that we have only solutions of one metal in another , the concordance in the deduced values is very great ; in fact , when we experiment with metals whose conducting-power in a pure state is known , and when the impurity is only dissolved in it , then the deduced conducting-power agrees almost exactly with that found experimentally .
For resistance-thermometers , as described by SIEMENS* , the use of an iron wire would give much greater differences for the same increment of temperature than copper ; for the resistance of pure copper wire increases for each degree about 0-4 per cent. , whereas that of pure iron increases about 0-6 per cent. for each degree .
When we found that iron decreased in conducting-power between 0 ?
and 100 ?
more than the pure metals ( and here again we will call attention to the fact that we have as yet found no alloy to decrease in conducting-power between 0 ?
and 100 ?
to a greater extent than that which the pure metals composing it would do ) , we thought that its being a magnetic body might possibly be the reason of it ; but after having tested thallium , and found that the conducting-power of that metal also decreases more than that of the pure metals , we knew that this could not well be the case , for thallium is strongly diamagnetict , Hearing , however , that Professor WOHLER possessed specimens of pure cobalt and nickel wire prepared by M. DEVILLE , we wrote and asked him to lend them to us ; this he immediately did , and on testing them we obtained the following results : Cobalt wire .

From our experiments with alloys we should deduce that the cobalt and nickel wires TiIE ELECTRIC CONDUCTING-POWER OF THALLIUM AND IRON .
were not pure , and we are justified in making this statement by the fact that we have not yet found any metal in a pure and solid state to decrease in conducting-power between 0 ?
and 100 ?
less than 29-307 per cent. , and , further , when we consider that , although these metals may have been pure when in the state of powder , yet very little is known about their behaviour to the crucibles at the high temperatures at which they fuse .
It is well known how difficult it is to procure chemically pure iron in a fused state , on account of its decomposing the crucibles in which it is melted and taking up some impurities .
Assuming , therefore , that cobalt and nickel behave like most other pure metals , namely , decrease in conducting-power between 0 ?
and 100 ?
, 29*307 per cent. , we may deduce from the above data the conducting-power of the pure metals .
The conducting-power of pure cobalt would then be 17*223 at 0 ?
, and that of pure nickel 13-106 at 0 ? .
We hope shortly to be able to prepare some pure cobalt and nickel by depositing galvanoplastically those metals in the form of foil from solutions of their pure salts , and so to check the above deduced values for the conducting-power of the pure metals .
In conclusion , we give , in the following Table , the conducting-power of some of the pure metals , in order to show the places which the metals treated of in this paper take .
