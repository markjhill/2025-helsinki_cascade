I. MAGNETIC OBsEItYATtoNs .
There have been no changes introduced in the gnetograpbs during the year , but the operations referred to on have involved the introduction of several pieces of iron , in the shape of girders , standards , rails , \amp ; c. , both temporarily and permanently , into the field of action of the magnets , and will therefore somewhat complicate the corrections necessary to render he observations comparable with those made prior to the ] terations .
Fortunately the building in which the observations are made is sufficiently remote ( about 100 yards ) from the main building to be quite unaffected by these sources of magnetic distn.bance .
The photographed magnetic curves representing Declination , 74 of the Kew Committee .
Horizontal Force , and Vertical Force variations have been secured uninterruptedly throughout the past year , and in accordance with the usual practice the scale values of all the instruments were determined in January last .
The following values of the ordinates of f , he different photographic curves were then found:\mdash ; Declination : 1 inch .
1 cm .
Bifilar , January 12 , 1888 , for 1 inch foot grain unit .
1 cm .
, , C.G.S. unit .
Balance , , 1888 , , 1 inch foot grain unit .

, , C.G.S. unit .
The distance between the dots of light upon the vertical force cylinder having become too small for satisfactory registration , the instrument was re-adjusted for balance .
This was done on January 19th , after which the scale value was -determined with the following result :\mdash ; Balance , January 21 , 1888 , for 1 inch foot grain unit .
1 cm .
, , C.G.S. unit .
In February experiments were undertaken to verify the tempera ture corrections of the force magnetographs as well as of barograph by artificially heating the room in which these instru ments are at work .
A rough temporary fireplace was built of slates , in which a charcoal fire was lighted for several hours This was subsequently inguished and the windows were throw11 wide open order to admit the cold night air for a corresponding period .
By this means changes of temperature of about were several times made .
The resultant effect in the case of bitilar was very small indeed , but with respect to the balance magnet ometer , it was considerable , as expected .
In order to ascertain whether the experiments had affected permanent magnetism of the needles , or had otherwise influenced the instruments , scale value determinations were made on March 20th and as will be seen by the following ) , no appreciable eflect had been produced in the sensibility of the .
magnetometer by operation .
Balance , March20 , 1888 , for 1 inch foot grain unit .

, , C.G.S. Small unimportant repairs have been made to the recording apparatus wheu necessary .
Although the magnets generally have been more active than in th$j preceding year , no very large movements have been registered .
The principal disturbances were recorded on the following dates : of November 21 , 1887 , January 23 , April 11-12 , May 21 , August.3 , and October 19-22 , 1888 .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been made as , and the results given in the tables Appendix I of this Report .

3 ) The magnetograph curves made use of in the preparation of the tables of diurnal range of ] ( see Appendix I , Table III ) have been reproduced from the original photographs by means of an raph kindly lent by Captain Wharton , F.R.S. , the Hydrographer .
A complste set of self-recording netographs by Casella , London , simiIar in coustruction to the instruments recently supplied to the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society , have been examined at the Observatory .
information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various data have been supplied to Professol .
S Rucker , Piazzi Smyth , Dr. Rijckevorsel , and Iessrs .
Wilkinson and Harrison .
Magnetic Reductions.\mdash ; At the request of the Rev. S. J. Perry , copies of the Kew Horizontal Force curves for certain selected days during the years 1883 to 1886 are now being made .
II .
METEOROLOGTCAL The several self-recording instruments for the cotltinuous registration spectively of Atmospheric Pressure , Temperature , and Humidity , Wind ( direction and velocity ) , Bright unsbine , and Rain , have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year .
The standard eye observations for the conbrol of the automatic records have been duly registered , together with the daily observations in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service synchronous system .
A summary of these observations is given in Appendix The taubulation of the meteoroIogical traces has been regularly carried on , and copies of these , as well as of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine have been transmitted tn the Meteorological Oflice .
Owing to trouble caused by bursting of the eservoir for the thermograph wet-bulbs during frosty weather , and the risk of their imperfect action owing to leakage of water , a double tank has been made , so that in the event of the inner vessel bursting , the outer one will prevent any loss of water .
Report of the Committee .
The number of instruments under observation has been increased by the addition of a snow gauge on Professor Nipher 's principle for the purpose of measuring falls of snow , but no opportunity has occurred since its erection of testing its indications .
A new Glaisher gauge has been supplied by the Meteorological Office , and its readings observed ] arly , since January , with the view of substituting it for the old square 100-inch area gauge hitherto employed for check upon the Beckley S.R. gauge , on the completion of a full year 's comparison of the two gauges .
Seven montbs ' observations have also been made of a second 8-inch gauge , wif , the view of determining the effect of paint upon the inner surface of the collecting funnel .
During the period that the east room of the Observatory was undergoin alteration , the working standard barometel , Newman 34 , was temporarily removed to a position a few yards distant in the North Hall .
Comparisons were made with the Welsh standards ( which carefully cased in , the time of occupation of the room by workmen ) , both before , subsequent to its removal , and after its replacement in its old position .
The following is a summary of the number of meteorological vations made during the past year:\mdash ; Readings of standard barometer . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
1740 dry and wet thermometers . . . . . . . .
3480 maximum and minimum thermometers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

1891 In compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council to the Committee , Mr. Whipple visited and inspected during his vacation the Observatories at Aberdeen , Glasgow , Stonyhurst , and Oxford , as well as the anemographs at Swaubister , North Shields and Fleetwood .
Mr. Baker also inspected the Falmouth and Valeuoia Observatories as well as the Auemographs at Mountjoy Barracks ( Dublin ) and JIolyhead .
Advantage was taken of these visits to fit Stonyhnrst lifters to Report of the Kew Committee .
the Beckley rain gauges at Aberdeen , Falmouth , and Valencia , and one has since been forwarded to Dr. Dreyer for him to fit at Armagh .
The barograph and thermograph formerly in use at the Armagh atory , after being put in thorough repair , have been erected in the Verification-house and temporarily set to work , waiting the decision of the MeteoroIogical Council as to their final disposition .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the gical results have been regularly forwarded to , published by The Times ' and ' The Torquay ectory .
' Data have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the edilor of ' Symons 's Mouthly Meteorological Magazine , ' the Secretary of the of Mining ngineers , Captain Abney , Dr. Rowland , and others .
The cost of hese abstracts is borne by the recipients .
Since January last tables of the mollthly values of the rainfall and temperature have beeu prepared and sent to the Meteorological SubCommittee of the Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club for publication in their Proceedings .
Detailed information of all thunderstorms observed in the neighbourhood during the year has also been ularly forwarded to the Royal Society soon aftel their occurrence , special forms having been provided by the Society for the purpose of collecting such information with the view to special investigation .
Electrogr \mdash ; The electrograph under repair at time of last Reporb , to its partial destruclion by fire , has been put in thorough order .
The de la Rue battery , employed to charge it , has been cleaned , and its cells refilled by the makers .
scale-value of the instrument has been again determined by means of the portable elec- trometer ( White 's ) and found to be practically unaifected by the accident .
A paper giving a mary of the results afforded by the instrument is at present in preparation .
The electrometer lent to Mr. Abercromby for the purpose of making observations during his expedition to Teneriffe was returned to the Observatory in good order on the ation of his experiment , and on trial the value of the scale division was found to be ullaltered .
In co1Jsequence of an accident whilst cleaning , the instrument required -adjnstment in March , but no alteration was found to have resulted to its sensitiveness when again tested at the laboratory in Charlotte Street , facilities being afforded for this by the kindness of the Chairman .
Report of the Committee .
III .
SOLAR OBSERVATIONS .
The sketches of Sun-spots , as seen projected on the photoboliograph screen , have been made on 150 days , in order to continue Schwabe 's enumeration , the resuIts being given in Appendix II , Table Transit Observations.\mdash ; Regular observations of solar and of sidereal transits have been taken , for the purpose of keeping correct local time at the Observatory , and the clocks and chronometers have been compared daiIy .
The clocks , French , Shelton K. O. , Shelton.35 , and the chronometers Breguet No. 3140 , and ArnoId 86 are kept carefully rated as time-keepers at the Observatory , and the meau-time clock , Dent 2011 , lent by the Astronomer-Royal , is also in use in daily com- parisons with the chronometers on trial .
The chronometer , Molyneux No. 2126 , is used as a " " hack chronometer \ldquo ; in order to facilitate the inter-comparison of the clocks .
The scale , figures , \amp ; c. , on the south meridian mark in connexion with the tl'ansit-instrument having become somewhat obliterated through age and exposure , steps were taken to remedy this defecb , and some slight introduced .
IV .
ExPERllIENTAL WORK .
Photo-nephograph.\mdash ; The past year has been particularly u1lfavourable to photography at the Observatory .
The opportunities of taking negatives of cirrus , to which particular attention is directed , were rare in the earlier months of the summer , and during later the builders ' operations prevented , in a measure , the work being ried on .
Several modifications have been introduced into the system of observing , materially simplifying it , and the mathematical treatment of the pictures has also temporarily set aside in favour of mechanical methods , which afford of sufficient accuracy in a small fraction of the time occupied by the other plans of reduction which have been employed hitherto .
Observations of cloud height , drift , and direction ]lave been eated in this manner for 1887 and for 1888 , generaIly with satisfactory resuIts .
During April special raphs were taken with one camera only , for showing the structural change in cirrus in short intervals of time , and seven sets of negatives were procured , exhibiting the extensive alteration sometimes observed in this class of cloud in a couple of minutes .
Time Signals.\mdash ; With a view of obtaining the time at the Observatory for pendulum work to a high degree of accuracy , and also for comparing daily the time as determined by the Observatory Transit with that distributed by the from St. Martin's-leReport of the Committee .
Grand , application was made to H.M. Commissioners of Woods and Forests for permission to erect a telegraph line from the Observatory to the London and South Western Railway the Old Deer Park .
This was granted , and a line has been set up placing the Observatory in direct electrical communication with the Chief Office in Richmond .
A relay and chronograph have beeu purchased and placed in the circuit , and every morning , excepting Sundays and holidays , the 10 .
signal from the Royal Observatory , Greenwicb , is recorded beside the beats of the Observatory Standard Clock ( French ) on the same tape .
The signals have been observed daily by means of the galvanometer for the past two months , but the chronograph was only regularly set to work on the October , delay having arisen on account of the necessity of protecting the apparatus against lightning .
The of the chronograph and attachments to the Standard Clock has been defiayed by a grant from the Royal Society .
Experiments.\mdash ; The of Indian Invariable Pendulums at the Observatory has been delayed by the operations attendant on the establishment of the time signal connexion with the General Post Office , and also by failure , up to the present , of information from the American officers as to certain details of their practice when observing with the appal.atus in America and elsewhere .
Meanwhile experiments have been made to determine the vacuum correction of the two thermometers , Nos. and 668 , used on the dummy to replace those broken in travelling .
It was observed that a reduction of 27 inches in the barometric pressure lowered their zero points by .
Other observations were also made to find the relative degree of accordance during changes of between the indications of the thermometers in the interior of the vacuum-chamber and that attached to the Richard thermograph placed in close proximity to its outer surface .
During these trials the holding capacity of the chamber has been thoroughly tested and found to stand low pressures extremely well .
Constants of Robinson \mdash ; By permission of the Committee , Mr. Whipple has attended at Hersham on several occasions , and assisted Mr. W. .
Met .
Soc. , in the experiments in , on behalf of the Wind Force Committee of the Royal Meteorological Socicty , for determining the of the Robinson constant for anemometers of various dimensions , and also for verifying the factor for ting wind velocity into pressure .
The experiments are similar to tbose carried out at the Crystal Palace in 1874 , and described in the Report for that year .
A eliminary Report on the experiments was read before the R Met Soc. meeting in May , 1888 , and is printed in the terly Journal , ' vol. 14 , p. 253 .
The results compare very favourably with 80 Report of the Committee .

0F WATCHES .
entries of watches for rating were made as contrasted with 510 during the corresponding period of last year .
They were sent for testing in the following classes:\mdash ; For class , 569 ; class , 51 ; and class , 19 .
Of these 218 failed to gain any certificate ; 8 passed in , 46 in 367 in , and 28 of the latter obtained the highest possible form of certificate , the class A especially !
7 ood .
In Appendix III will be found statements giving the resuIts of trial of the 30 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks during he year , the premier position being attained\mdash ; with marks a keyless , single-roller , going-barrel , centre-seconds watch , submitted by , Holland , Rockfer , Birkenhead .
This total exceeds that of last year , and it is also extremely satisfactory to note that a continued increase has taken place in the proportion of tches g more than 80 marks , the number this year being 53 .
No difficulty has been experienced in l1laintaining the three safes\mdash ; in the watches are placed during rating\mdash ; at the three temperatures of and 9 respectively , all the year round .
Special attention continues to be given , as , to the examination of pocket , in accordance with the request of the Cyclists ' lJnion ; and in consequ of numerous from manufacturers , timerH , \amp ; c. , a set of rules has been drawn up , as follows , which are adhered to as far as practicable in testing chronographs .
1 .
Aftel the usual A or tests are finished tho watch is run with the chronograph work in continual action for one or two iods of 24 houlH each , and a note made of the maximum effect produced upon the ordinary daily rate , by the chronograph mechanism being in constant action .
VOL. XLV .
82 Rpport of the Committee .
' 2 .
This maximum eifect must not exceed seconds .
3 .
In addition to the above 24-bour trials , the watch\mdash ; with a view of testing its starting , stopping , and recording also subiected to shorter tests , varying from a few secon an ds to an hour or more in duration .
4 .
When { he chronograph mechanism is in action , pressure lied to the knob or push-piece , the chronograph hand or hands app le must either stop dead at once , or else must run on unaffected until stronger force is used .
5 .
There must be a complete absence of " " lagglng , an mov " " and only in spasmodic jumps , when pressure is applied , and perfect absence of recoil wheu the chronograph hand is stopped .
6 .
The hands must return to , and start exactly from ; the zero mark , and in the case of split seconds they must run together in exact accordance .
7 .
The times shown by the minute-recorder must agree lvith the position of the fly-back hand .
8 .
When the chronograph action of a watch has been tested\mdash ; in addition to the trial of its ordinary time-keeping endorseof the result will be made upon the certificate ; and chrono- graph watches with certificates without this endorsement will be recognised as having been examined as ordinary watches only .
Chronometers.\mdash ; Certificates of mean daily rate and of variations of rate at each temperature have been awarded to 12 chronometers after undergoing the 35 days ' trial as specified in the regulations .
VII .
MISCELLANEOUS .
Assistance to Observatories , \mdash ; Prepared photographic paper has been procured and supplied to the Observatories at Batavia , Colaba , Falmouth , Lisbon , Mauritius , Oxford , St. Petersburg , Stonyhurst , and Toronto , as well as also to the Meteorological Office and the U.S. Navy Department .
Anemograph sheets have been sent to Coimbra and Mauritius , blank forms for entry of observations , \amp ; c. , have also been distributed to various applicants .
Eongkong \mdash ; This observatory was founded by H.M. Government in 1883 , partly on the recommendation of the Kew Commibtee , in order amongst other objects to obtain continuous observations of terrestrial magnetism and meteorology in the eastern hemisphere between Java and Zi-Ka-Wei .
The Committee have recently been consulted by the Secretary of State the Colonies as to the advisability of suspending the magnetic of the Chinese for a period of three years , Report of the .
Kew Committee .
8.3 but having regard to the important changes going on in the horizontal component of the earth 's magnetism , on that part of the globe , they were not able to recommend the Secretary to interrupt the observations as gested .
Marine arrangements described in last year 's Report for the examination of Marine telescopes and binoculars have been completed , and a circular has been approved of by the Committee for issne to the public , stating that such instrnments will in future be tested at Kew on payment of the following fees : Marine telescopes and superior binoculars . . .
eacb .
Opera glasses and pocket telescopes . . . .
The Secretary of the Admiralty has communicated with the Com mittee with reference to a proposal that all such instruments purchased for use in H.M. Navy should be examined at the Observatory prior to their acceptance from the contractors ' hands .
Photographic Lenses.\mdash ; Captain Abney , at the estion of the Camera Club , as well as Mr. Galton , have proposed to the Committee the establishment of a system of testing and certifying lenses constructed for use in photogrnphic cameras .
Captain has proposed a scheme of examination , and experiments are in progress with a view to carrying it out at the Observatory .
It has , however , been found difficult as yet to fix upon one which would permit of a cieutly exhaustive examination being conducted for the low fee which has been suggested , as probably the oue likely to make the certificates popular .
Ships ' \mdash ; The Committee have had under consideration the very important bject of the examination of ship 's lights for the Mercantile Marine , by a system based upon the method now in operation at H.M. Dockyard at Chatham with reference to the lamps , lenses , and coloured sbades used in H.M. Navy .
The inland isolated position of the atory , and the heavy and cumbersome nature of the lanterns , appear to the Committee at present to offer an almost insuperable objection to the adoption of this at Kew .
There are no funds available for the aIternative plan suggested of setting up a branch establishment at some locality on the banks of the Thames below London .
xhibition.\mdash ; The Committee contributed bo the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Meteorological Society held in Nfarch last , a collection of apparatus for observing atmospheric electricity , principally that used at Kew by RD nalds or subsequent observers .
A list of the various objects with references is printed in the catalogue prepared by the Society .

84 Report of the Committee .
Eiptension of the Building.\mdash ; The Chief Commissioner of Works an Public Buildings having granted permission for the Committee to undertake the erection of additional storey to the east WlIlg of the Observatory as mentioned in last year 's Reporb , and having instructed Mr. Lessels , surveyor to the Board , to prepare the necessary drawings , plans , \amp ; c. , tenders were invifed from the local builders for the work .
That of Messrs. J. Dorey and Co. , of Brentford , for , was accepted , and operations were commenced on July They now been completed under the superintendence of Mr. Chart , H.M. Commissioners ' Clerk of Works for the Hampton Courb and Kew District , and Mr. Allen , his Assistant .
Library . .
the year the library has received as presents the publications of\mdash ; 22 Scientific Societies and of Greab Britain and Ireland , and 95 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments , as well as numerous private individuals ; The reference set of ' Phil. Trans. ' has been bound in cloth boards to correspond with the covers of the volumes as now issued by the Royal Society .
Old Mural Quadrant.\mdash ; When in 1840 the astronomical instruments forming the equipment of George III 's Observatory , were removed to Armagh , it was found ) to ake away the 8-feet mural quadrant by Sissons , on account of its being too to pass through the doors or windows of the room in which it was placed .
Recently , advantage was of the removal of the roof of the east wing of the Observatory to hoist it ont and conv.ey it to the Stores in the Office of Works at Kew , where it is now deposited .
The Committee propose its ultimate consignment to the Collection of Scientific Apparatus at South The stone wall which served for its support has been utilised as a bearer for a new gallery , providing an additional area of feet long by 7 feet wide , which it is intended to devote to the Department for the Verification of Hydrometers .
Workshop.\mdash ; The machine tools procured for the uss of the Kew atory by grants from the Government Grant Fund or the Donation Fund , have been duly kept in order .
House , Grounds , and ootpath.\mdash ; These have all been kept as usual ring the year .
A Norton 's tube-well bas been driven and a pump erected in order to obtain an increased water supply , ths Observatory not being in connexion with the mains of Richmond .

PERSONAL ESTABLISHMENT .
The staff employed is as follows:\mdash ; G. M. hipple , B. Sc. , Superintendent .
T. W. Baker , Assistant .
H. McLaughlin , Librarian .
E. G. Constable , Observations and Rating .
W. Hugo , Department .
J. Foster \ldquo ; T. Gunter .
W. J. Boxall , and five other Assistants .
The Committee feel they cannot permit the lamented death of Professor Balfour Stewart to pass unnoticed .
Professor 's counexion with the Observatory originated in 1856 , when it was under tlIe control of the British Association .
In February of that year he joined the staff as an Assistant Observer to Mr. John Welsh ; his stay was , however , short , as he left soon after in October to become Assistant to Professor at Edinburgh , but returned in 1859 as the Superintendent , the appointment when offcred him on the death of Mr. Welsh .
He relinquished the superintendence in 1871 , in order to reside at Manchester as Professor of PLysics in Owens College , hut maintained a most interest in the operations of the Observatory , especially in the solar and magnetic work , being engaged in a discussion of certain of the Kcw magnetic observatio1ls even up to the time of his death .

Report of the Report of the Committee Magnetic Observations made at tloe Kew Observatory , Long. W. , for the year October lS87 to 1888 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator marked , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same netometer , Collimator Magnet NO being ployed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip.clrcle Barrow No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are inches lengbh .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibratlon give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both ] and metrical tlJe u. in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one gra1n ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of ti me , and one Jnme , the factor for cing the to metric values being By request , the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given .
The value of employed in the reduction is at temperature F. The induction-coefficient is The correction of the magnetic power for temperature to all adopted standard temperature of F. is The true distnnces between the cenores of the deflecting and deflected magnets , wtlen the former is placed at the divisions of the deflectionmarked foot and feet , are feet and feet respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
rrhe value of the constant , employed in the formula of reduction , is In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , has been carefully determined .
The observations have been and reduced by Mr. T. W. Bakor .
