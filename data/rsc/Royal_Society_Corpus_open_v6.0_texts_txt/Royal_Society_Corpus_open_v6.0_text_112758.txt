( Abstract .
) In this communication the authors give the results of a series of determinations of the cllemical intensity of total daylight made in the autumn of 1867 on the flat tableland on the southern side of the Tagus , about 8 miles to the south-east of Lisbon , under a cloudless sky , with the object of ascertaining the relation existing between the solar altitude and the chemical intensity .
The method of measurement adopted was that described in a previous communication to the Society* , founded upon the exact estimation of the tint which standard sensitive paper assumes when exposed for a given time to the action of daylight .
The experiments were made as follows:1 .
The chemical action of total daylight was observed in the ordinary manner .
2 .
The chemical action of the diffused daylight was then observed by throwing on to the exposed paper the shadow of a small blackened brass ball , placed at such a distance that its apparent diameter , seen from the position of the paper , was slightly larger than that of the sun 's disk .
3 .
Observation No. 1 was repeated .
4 .
Observation No. 2 was repeated .
The means of observations 1 and 3 and of 2 and 4 were then taken .
The sun 's altitude was determined by a sextant and artificial horizon , immediately before and immediately after the observations of chemical intensity , the altitude at the time of observation being ascertained by interpolation .
It was first shown that an accidental variation in the position of the brass ball within limits of distance from the paper , varying from 140 millims. to 230 millims. , was without any appreciable effect on the results .
One of the 134 sets of observations was made as nearly as possible every hour , and they thus naturally fall into seven groups , viz.:(1 ) Six hours from noon , ( 2 ) five hours from noon , ( 3 ) four hours from noon , ( 4 ) three hours from noon , ( 5 ) two hours from noon , ( 6 ) one hour from noon , ( 7 ) noon .
Each of the first six of these groups contains two separate sets of observations , -(1 ) those made before noon , ( 2 ) those made after noon .
It has already been pointed out-t , from experiments made at Kew , that the mean chemical intensity of total daylight for hours equidistant from noon is the same .
The results of the present series of experiments prove that this conclusion holds good generally ; and a Table is given showing the close approximation of the numbers obtained at hours equidistant from noon .
Curves are given showing the daily march of chemical intensity at Lisbon in August , compared with that at Kew for the preceding August , and at Para for the preceding April .
The value of the mean chemical intensity at Kew is represented by the number 94-5 , that at Lisbon by 110 , and that at Para ' by 313'3 , light of the intensity 1 acting for 24 hours being taken as 1000 .
The following Table gives the results of the observations arranged according to the sun 's altitude .

64 14 0-221 0-138 0-359 Curves are given showing the relation between the direct sunlight ( column 3 ) and diffuse daylight ( column 4 ) in terms of the altitude .
The curve of direct sunlight cuts the base line at 10 ?
, showing that the conclusion formerly arrived at by one of the authors is correct , and that at altitudes below 10 ?
the direct sunlight is robbed of almost all its chemically active rays .
The relation between the total chemical intensity and the solar altitude is shown to be represented graphically by a straight line for altitudes above 10 ?
, the position of the experimentally determined points lying closely on to the straight line .
A similar relation has already* been shown to exist ( by a far less complete series of experiments than the present ) for Kew , I-eidelberg , and Para ; so that although the chemical intensity for the same altitude at different places and at different times of the year varies according to the varying transparency of the atmosphere , yet the relation at the same place between altitude and intensity is always represented by a straight line .
This variation in the direction of the straight line is due to the opalescence of the atmosphere ; and the authors show that , for equal altitudes , the higher intensity is always found where the mean temperature of the air is greater , as in summer , when observations at the same place at different seasons are compared , or as the equator is approached , when the actions at different places are examined .
The differences in the observed actions for equal altitudes , which may amount to more than 100 per cent. at different places , and to nearly as much at the same place at different times of the year , serve as exact measurements of the transparency of the atmosphere .
The authors conclude by calling attention to the close agreement between the curve of daily intensity obtained by the above-mentioned method at Lisbon , and that calculated for Naples by a totally different method .
