( Abstract .
) After a historical introduction the authors proceed to describe the method of investigation , which was conducted as follows .
The animal being narcotised with ether , the internal capsule was exposed by a horizontal section through the hemisphere .
By means of compasses the outlines of the basal ganglia and capsule were accurately transferred to paper ruled with squares of 1 millimetre side , so that a projection of the capsule was thus obtained , divided into bundles of 1 millimetre square area .
Each of these squares of fibres was then excited by a minimal stimulus , the same being an induced or secondary interrupted current .
The movements were recorded and the capsule photographed .
In all 45 experiments were performed , and they are arranged in eight groups , representing eight successive levels ( .
, from the centrum ovale to the crus ) at which the capsule was investigated .
Before the results are described in detail a full account is given of previous investigations , experimental , clinical , and anatomical , on the arrangement of the internal capsule .
