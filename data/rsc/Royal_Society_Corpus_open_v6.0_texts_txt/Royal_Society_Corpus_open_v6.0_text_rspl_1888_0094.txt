] Jjjl " Note on the Spectrum of the Rings of Saturn .
" By J. Norman Lockyer , F.R.S. Received and read February 7 , 1889 .
The acknowledged meteoritic constitution of the rings of Saturn rendered it important to obtain a photograph of their spectrum , in order that it might be determined whether collisions there were of sufficient intensity to produce incandescent vapours .
It has long known that the rings appear much more luminous than the Tj\amp ; net , the magnificent photographs obtained by the Brothers show that this is truer for the blue light than for the visual rays weather has been so bad that only one long exposure photo-raP has been taken .
Although the instrument was not in perfect vol. xlv .

t^eb.7 , adjustment , owing to a recent accident , I submit it to the Society because there appears to be evidence of bright lines in the photograph .
It is altogether too early to announce this as an established fact , but I think it well to send in this note , in order that other observers with more powerful optical appliances and a better climate than , that of London may investigate the question .
The photograph exhibited was taken on the 2nd instant by Mr. Porter , Computer to the Solar Physics Committee .
The instrument employed was the 10-inch equatorial of the Science Schools , and a spectroscope of two prisms of 60 ' .
Other considerations point to the possibility that bright lines or bands may be found in the spectrum of Uranus .
