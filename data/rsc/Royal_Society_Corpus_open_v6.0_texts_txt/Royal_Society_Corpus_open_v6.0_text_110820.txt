" On the minute structure of the Skeletons , or hard parts of Invertebrata .
" By W. B. Carpenter , M.D. Communicated by the President .
Part II .
" On the structure of the Shell in the several families and genera of Mollusca .
" The author here gives in detail the results of his inquiries into the combinations of the component elements of shell as they are met with in the several families and genera of the Mollusca ; and considers all these results as tending to establish the general propo ?
sition , that where a recognizable divcrsity presents itself in the elementary structure of the shell , in different groups , that diversity affords characters which indicate the natural affinities of the several genera included in those groups , and which may therefore be employed with advantage in classification , and in the recognition and determination of fossils .
