The Liquefaction and Solidification of Argon .
By Dr. K. Olszewski .
Professor of Chemistry the University of Cracow .
Communicated by Professor William Ramsay , F.R.S. Received January 28 , \#151 ; Read January 31 , 1895 .
Haying been furnished , by Professor Ramsay 's kindness , with a sample of the new gas , argon , I have carried out experiments on its behaviour at low temperatures and at high pressures , in order to contribute , at least in part , to the knowledge of the properties of this interesting body .
The argon sent by Professor Ramsay amounted to 300 cub. centims. It was contained in a hermetically-sealed glass bulb , so constructed that it could easily be transferred , with no appreciable loss , into the carefully-dried and vacuous apparatus in which the proposed experiments were to be performed .
The argon with which I was supplied had , according to Professor Ramsay 's statement , been dried with phosphoric anhydride ; its density was 19'9 ( H = 1 ) ; and he thought that at the outside it might contain 1 to 2 per cent , of nitrogen , although it showed no nitrogen spectrum when examined in a Plucker 's tube .
Four series of experiments in all were carried out , two with the object of determining the critical temperature and pressure of argon , as well as of measuring its vapour pressure at several other low temperatures , while two other series served to determine its boiling- and freezing-points under atmospheric pressure , as well as its density at its boiling-point .
A detailed description of these experiments will be given in another place ; I shall here give only a short description , of the manner in which they were made .
For the first two experiments I made use of a Oailletet 's apparatus .
Its metallic manometer had been previously compared with the readings of a mercury manometer .
As cooling agent I used liquid ethylene , boiling under diminished pressure .
The glass tube of Cailletet 's apparatus was so arranged that the portion immersed in the liquid ethylene had comparatively thin walls ( not exceeding 1 millim. ) , so as to equalise the external and internal temperature as quickly as possible .
In both the other experiments the argon was contained in a burette , closed at both 27.6 95 ends with glass stop-cocks .
By connecting the lower end of the burette with a mercury reservoir , the argon was transferred into a narrow doubly bent glass tube connected with the upper end of the burette , and in which the argon was liquefied , and I its volume in the liquid state measured .
In these two series of experiments liquid oxygen , boiling under atmospheric or under diminished pressure , was employed as a cooling agent .
I made use of a hydrogen thermometer in all these experiments to measure low temperatures .
Determination of the Critical Constants of .

In experiments Nos. 3 and 6 less liquid argon was present in the tube than in the other five ; in these the volume of liquid exceeded the volume of gas .
In determining the vapour pressures of argon , a tabular record of which is given below , I noticed slight differences of pressure according as I produced more or less of the liquid at the same temperature .
This proved that the sample of argon contained an inconsiderable admixture of another gas , more difficult to liquefy ; it is doubtless the trace of nitrogen previously referred to .
The mean of the seven estimations of the critical temperature is \#151 ; 121 ' , and this may be taken as the critical temperature of argon .
At lower temperatures the following vapour-pressures were recorded :\#151 ; Experiment .

Determination of the Boiling- and Freezing-Points .
Two hundred cub. centims. of liquid oxygen , prepared in my large apparatus , # was poured into a glass vessel with quadruple walls , so as to isolate the liquid from * * 'Bulletin International de l'Academie de Cracovie , ' June , 1890 ; also Wiedemann 's ' Beiblatter , ' yol .

After the liquid oxygen had been thus poured under atmospheric pressure , a great part of it evaporated , but there still remained about 70 cub. centime .
, boiling under atmospheric pressure .
A calibrated tube , intended to receive the argon to be liquefied , and the hydrogen thermometer were immersed in the boiling oxygen .
At this temperature ( \#151 ; 182'*7# ) on admitting argon , no appearance of liquefaction could be noticed , even when compressed by increasing the atmospheric pressure by a quarter .
This shows that its boiling-point lies below that of oxygen .
But on diminishing the temperature of the liquid oxygen below \#151 ; 187 ' , the liquefaction of the argon became manifest .
When liquefaction had taken place , I carefully equalised the pressure of the argon with that of the atmosphere , and regulated the temperature , so that the state of balance was maintained for a long time .
This process gives the boiling-point of argon under atmospheric pressure .
Four experiments gave the numbers i \#151 ; 186'*7 , \#151 ; 186'*8 , \#151 ; - 187 *0 , and .\#151 ; 187 *3 .
The mean is \#151 ; 186'*9 , which I consider to be the boiling-point under atmospheric pressure ( 740*5 millims. ) .
The quantity of argon used for these experiments , reduced to normal temperature and pressure , was 99 *5cub .
centiras .
; the quantity of liquid corresponding to that volume of gas was approximately 0*114 cub. centim. Hence the density of argon at its boiling-point may be taken as approximately 1*5 .
Two other determinations of the density of liquid argon , for which I employed still smaller quantities of the gas , yielded rather smaller numbers .
Owing to the small amount of argon used for these experiments , the numbers given cannot lay claim to great exactness ; yet they prove that the density of liquid argon at its boiling-point ( \#151 ; 187 ' ) is much higher than that of oxygen , which I have found , under similar conditions , to be 1*124 .
By lowering the temperature of the oxygen to \#151 ; 191 ' by slow exhaustion , the argon froze to a crystalline mass , resembling ice ; on further lowering temperature it became white and opaque .
When the temperature was raised it melted ; four observations which I made to determine its melting-point gave the numbers : \#151 ; 189'*0 , \#151 ; 190'*6 , \#151 ; 189'*6 , and \#151 ; 189'*4 .
The mean of these numbers is \#151 ; 189'*6 ; and this may be accepted as the melting-point of argon .
In the following table I have given a comparison of physical constants , in which those of argon are compared with those of other so-called permanent gases .
The data are from my previous work on the subject .
I have re-determined the boiling-point of oxygen , using large quantities of oxygen , and a hydrogen thermometer of much larger dimensions than previously .
The registered temperature is 10,3 lower than that which .
I previously recorded .

Its behaviour on liquefaction places it nearest to oxygen , but it differs entirely from oxygen in being solidifiable ; as is well known , oxygen has not yet been made to assume a solid state The high density of argon rendered it probable that its liquefaction would take place at a higher temperature than that at which oxygen liquefies .
Its unexpectedly low critical temperature and boiling-point seem to have some relation to its simple molecular constitution .
Note on a Comparison of the Vapour-Pressures of Argon with those of other Substances .
By William Bamsay and Sydney Young .
Received February 7 , 1895 .
The vapour-pressures of a considerable number of substances have been determined from low temperatures to the critical points , but as the critical pressure of argon is somewhat high , the boiling-points of very few are available for comparison through the whole range of equal pressures .
The critical pressure of benzene is so slightly below that of argon that the extrapolation of the vapour-pressure curve through the few degrees necessary to afford a comparison at the critical pressure of the new element is j ustifiable .
The other two substances chosen are ethyl alcohol and oxygen ; the second is interesting , as its vapour-pressures , like those of argon , have been determined by Professor Olszewski .
In the following table the boiling-points\#151 ; on the absolute scale\#151 ; of argon , benzene , 258 PROFESSOR K. OLSZEWSKI ON THE ethyl alcohol , and oxygen , are given at the pressures at which observations have been made with the first of these substances .

Assuming the boiling-points of benzene , alcohol , and oxygen to be correct , those of argon could be calculated from them by multiplying the absolute temperatures of each substance by the corresponding ratio at each pressure .
The observed and re-calculated absolute temperatures of argon and the differences are given below :\#151 ; Pressure .

It is hardly likely , though not impossible , that so good an agreement would be obtained with a mixture or an impure substance .
It is , at any rate , certain that a distinct want of agreement would have shown that the argon was not a definite , pure substance , and the results may be taken as affording additional confirmation of the conclusion that argon is a definite , hitherto unknown constituent of the atmosphere , and that it has been isolated in a state very closely approaching to purity .
