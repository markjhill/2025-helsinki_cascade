A paper was read , entitled , " On a new equi-atomic compound of Bicyanide with Binoxide of Mercury .
" By James F. W. Johnston , Esq. , F.R.S. In this paper an account is given of the properties of a salt , obtained by agitating with red oxide of mercury a small proportion of hydrocyanic acid , and which the author finds to be distinguished from the bicyanide of mercury by its sparing solubility in cold water , by the strong alkaline reaction exhibited by its solution , ( a property which indicates an excess of mercury , ) and by its susceptibility of detonation by heat , depending on this excess being in the state of an oxide , and on the action of the oxygen on a portion of the car ?
bon of the cyanogen it contains , and the presence of which is shown by the disengagement of hydrocyanic acid gas when acted on by hydrosulphuric and hydrochloric acids .
The analysis of this salt , given by the author , shows it to con ?
