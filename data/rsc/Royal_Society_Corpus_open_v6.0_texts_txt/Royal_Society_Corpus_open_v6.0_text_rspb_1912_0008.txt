) The close relationship of B. doacce ( Jordan ) to B. lactis ( Eseherich ) suggested the investigation of the chemical action of the former on glucose and mannitol .
The two organisms are lactose-fermenting bacilli , allied to B. coli communis , and showing a close resemblance to each other in their biological characteristics .
B. lactis aerogenes is a non-motile , Gram-negative , non-liquefying bacillus , a facultative anaerobe which produces acid and clotting in milk .
B. cloacae is a facultative anaerobic bacillus , actively motile , Gram-negative , slowly liquefying gelatine , and producing acid and clot in milk .

This reaction is due to the presence of acetylmethylcarbinol , which is closely related to butylene glycol , a substance which had been found as one of the products of the fermentation of glucose by B. lactis aerogenes .
The organism was grown anaerobically in a medium containing 1 per cent , of Wit peptone and 2 per cent , of the sugar in the presence of chalk .
The products were examined by the method outlined by Harden !
in his investigation of the action of B. coli communis on glucose .
An alteration in the method of collecting the evolved gases was made , with the object of eliminating the error involved in collecting over saturated brine , in which carbon dioxide is slightly soluble .

Action of Bacillus cloacae ( Jordan)on Glucose and Mannitol .
501 used consists essentially of an evacuated flask of about 5 litres capacity , and has been fully described in a previous paper.* A. Action ofB .
cloacae on Glucose .
The substances produced by the action of on glucose were found to be the same as those fjDund in the case of B. lactis viz. , acetic acid , lactic acid , succinic acid , formic acid , ethyl alcohol , carbon dioxide , and hydrogen .
No trace of marsh gas was detected .
As in the case of B. lactis aerogenes the culture medium at the end of the fermentation gave Voges and Proskauer 's reaction , and there was also production of butylene glycol , amounting to 19 per cent , of the sugar .
The relative proportions of the products of fermentation differed considerably from those of B. coli communis and , in a less degree , from those of B. lactis aerogencs .
These variations are shown in the following tables .
The actual percentages by weight of the products on the glucose fermented in two separate determinations are given in Table I , Columns 1 and 2 .
For comparison , in Column 3 are given the results of a typical fermentation of glucose by B. lactis aerogenes , and in Column 4 those of a similar fermentation by B. coli communis .
Table II shows the number of carbon atoms per molecule of glucose represented by each product .
On comparing the results given in Table I it will be seen that the ratio of hydrogen to carbon dioxide by volume , viz. 0*3 : 1 , in the gas evolved from glucose by B. cioacce is somewhat smaller than in the case of B. lactis aerogenes ( = 0-42 :1 ) , and markedly less than for B. coli 1T9 :1 ) .

This source of error has been obviated , as already pointed out , by collecting the gases over mercury in an evacuated flask .
Formic acid was found in the products obtained from B. cloacae in far greater amount than in those from B. lactis aerogenes , while those given by B. coli are usually almost free from this substance .
It is , however , probable that at least a portion of the carbon dioxide is derived from the decomposition of formate primarily formed as an intermediate product .
A very marked difference in the relative proportions of alcohol and acetic acid produced by the three organisms will be noticed .
While the molecular ratio alcohol/ acetic acid for B. coli communis* is 1 , and for B. lactis aerogenes ( average of three determinations ) = 4 , that for B. cloacae was found in two experiments to be 18 and 6 .
The large difference between these results is due to the fact that only a very small amount of acetic acid is produced , and a small absolute difference in this produces a large change in the ratio .
Succinic acid is produced by B. cloacae in rather smaller amount than by B. lactis aerogenes , and in less than half the quantity given by B. coli communis .
The amount of alcohol is approximately equal to that given by B. lactis aerogenes .
A considerable deficiency of carbon in the fermentation of glucose by B. was found , and , remembering the very similar biological characters of B. cloacae and B. lactis aerogenes , butylene glycol was sought for .

503 Production of 2.3-Butylene Glycol by B. cloacae .
A medium containing 50 grm. of glucose in 1 litre of a 1 per cent , solution of Witte 's peptone , to which had been added 10 grm. of chalk , was inoculated with the bacillus .
After six weeks ' incubation at 37 ' , the liquid was distilled to dryness under reduced pressure at 40 ' .
The dry residue was extracted with boiling absolute alcohol , and the alcoholic solution distilled at 40 ' under reduced pressure .
The residue , weighing 10'6 grm. , was fractionated at normal pressure .
A fraction distilling between 178 ' and 184 ' , weighing 9*5 grm. , which solidified completely in a freezing mixture , was obtained .
That this substance was 2.3-butylene glycol was proved by converting a portion of it into diacetyl* by the action of bromine water under the influence of light .
From 4'5 grm. butylene glycol was obtained 1 grm. diacetyl , from which was prepared the phenyl-osazone.f After recrystallisation from alcohol and water the latter was found to have a melting point 243 ' .
B. Action of B. cloacae on Mannitol .
Considerable differences , while on the whole not so marked as in the case of glucose , are also found on comparing the results of the fermentation of mannitol by B. cloacae with those of B. coli communis and B. lactis aerogenes .
In Table III , Columns 1 and 2 , are given the results of two separate determinations of the products resulting from the action of B. cloacae on mannitol , and in Columns 3 and 4 are given for comparison the figures obtained by typical fermentations of mannitol by B. lactis Mannitol .

Table IV shows the number of carbon atoms per molecule of mannitol represented by the various products .
As in the case of glucose , a considerable deficiency in the carbon will be noticed ; this is to be accounted for by the production of acetyl-methylcarbinol and butylene glycol , a qualitative experiment having shown the presence of both these substances .
In the case of mannitol there is practically no difference in the ratios H2/ CO2 for the two organisms B. cloaca and B. lactis aerogenes .
As with glucose , the amount of formic acid obtained from B. cloaca is considerably greater than from either B. lactis aerogenes or B. coli communis .
On the other hand , the opposite is to be observed in the figures given for succinic acid .
A comparison of Tables I and III shows that B. cloaca produces twice as much alcohol from mannitol as from glucose .
This further confirms the suggestion previously made by Harden* that .the formation of alcohol in these reactions is related to the presence of the terminal CH2(OH)-CH(OH ) group , which occurs twice in the molecule of mannitol , and only once in that of glucose .
