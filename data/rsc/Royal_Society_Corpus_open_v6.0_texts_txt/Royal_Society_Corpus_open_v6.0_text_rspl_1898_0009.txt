On a former occasion a paper was communicated to the Royal ociety* containing an account of some measurements of the magnetic contraction of a nickel wire , and a comparison of these with the values deduced from Kirchhoff 's theory .
It was there shown j that the most important term in the calculated value of the elonga- j it )-zt/ tv\ w*re 'f soft magnetic metal is represented byl 2\#177 ; l(Si/ ^P ) , where H is the magnetising field and SI the increase of ] Dmgnetisation produced by a small increase of longitudinal tension 1 .

It was then !
soug t to establish an empirical equation which might represent the 1 o serve e ects , and it was found that the difference between the ] o serve an calculated contraction was approximately proportional I to the fourth power of the magnetisation .
It was suggested to me at the time that this result should be ] 6j 6 j. rfpeatin ' experiments under different conditions in ] order to find out whether it was genei-ally true .

On the Magnetic Deformation of Nickel .
45 In offering the following results , I wish again to say that the measurements were made in the Physical Laboratory of the University College of North Wales , and that I am greatly indebted to Professor A. Gray for providing me with the apparatus , and allowing me the time necessary for the experiments , and for many valuable suggestions .
Preliminary experiments were first made to find the nature of the influence of temperature on the magnetic contraction .
The apparatus was essentially the same as described in the former paper , with the addition of a spiral tube and burner for heating the water just before it entered the coil .
The temperature of the water on entering and leaving the coil was indicated by two thermometers inserted in capsules through which the water flowed .
When the water was warmed and allowed to flow for some time , the two thermometers indicated steady temperatures differing generally by about 2 ' C. The change of length was magnified by ' the same lever arrangement as before , and observed by a telescope , scale , and mirror .
A few trials showed that it would be impossible to make any measurements when the water was warmed unless precautions were taken to remove air dissolved in the water , for this , on being liberated in the heater , ascended in bubbles through the coil and disturbed the apparatus so much that no readings could be taken .
To prevent this , the water was made to flow into a vessel through a pipe near the top , and escape by a pipe near the bottom , whence it proceeded to the spii'al heater .
A tall glass tube projected upwards from the vessel , and the vessel w'as heated by a Bunsen flame .
The dissolved gases were thus liberated in this vessel , and , collecting at the top , escaped at intervals up the glass tube .
By this means the apparatus was rendered steady enough to admit of readings at moderately high temperatures .
Further , by regulating the supply the water could be made to stand at any level in the glass tube .
Thus the flow of water through the coil , and hence the temperature of the coil could be controlled .
The glass tube was about 6 feet long , and by raising the level of water in it through 1 foot the temperatui*e of the coil was lowered by about 1 ' C. Observations of the change of length were always made at night , generally between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. , the apparatus never being ; sufficiently steady in the daytime .
The nickel wire was the same as that used in the former experiments , of length 83'4 cm .
between the terminal brass pieces , and mean diameter T65 mm. This was re-annealed before the present measurements .
A number of observations were then mads of the change of length Dr. E. Taylor Jones .
and corresponding field strength on several nights in July and August , ; 1897 , the temperature indicated by the coil thermometers being about 20 ' 0 .
As before , the temporary and residual contractions were measured separately , the total contraction corresponding to any field strength being obtained as the sum of the temporary effect ( observed as an elongation when the current was broken ) , and the residual effect observed by first demagnetising the wire by reversals , : then quickly making and breaking the current .
It was found that the curves thus obtained were not the same on different nights , but showed a continual diminution of contraction as time went on .
This is probably due to a slow hardening of the metal which seems to go on for some time after the wire has been annealed .
The effect of j this change can be seen by comparing Tables I ( column 2 ) and III ( column 4 ) , which contain values of the contraction of the wire in millionths of its length for a series of fields , observed about the |i middle of August , 1897 , and at the end of December , 1897 , respec- jj tively.* The wire was annealed on July 3 , 1897 .
In order to observe the effect of a change of temperature on the | magnetic contraction at any field strength it was necessary to take readings at two temperatures immediately after one another , so that the results would not be affected by the above-mentioned time effect* This was done on several nights and with several field strengths , the two temperatures used being about 20 ' C. and 55 ' C. The results showed that at low fields ( up to about 90 C.G.S. ) this rise of temperature of 35 ' C. caused an increase , at higher fields a diminution , of contraction ; and if the temperature was then lowered back to 20 ' OB the contraction returned to its former value .
Table I contains values of the change of length in millionths and corresponding field strength at the two temperatures , determined on two successive nights , the effect at both temperatures being observed at the lower fields on one night , and at the higher fields on the next , j Each field was reversed several times before readings were taken , !
and the wire was demagnetised on each night while the tempera-\#174 ; ture was^ being changed .
The curves representing these results\#174 ; ( contraction , field ) have the same general form as was described in the former paper , but the temporary contraction is here considerably !
greater , though the residual contraction is much the same as before.\#174 ; The effect of ^ temperature is chiefly seen in the temporary eontrac- !
| tion .
the residual effect , however , appears to be slightly less at theSj higher temperature at all fields .
On referring to Professor Ewing 's 'Magnetic Induction in Iron\#174 ; and other Metals ' ( S 114 , p. 169 ) , I find that rise of temperature } causes increase of magnetisation in nickel at low fields and diminu*\#171 ; te"peratures on the two occasions differed by about 10\#174 ; C. , but the effect\#174 ; ox tins would be comparatively small .

ion at high fields .
Change of temperature , therefore , seems to have imilar effects on the magnetisation and contraction curves .
Of :ourse this comparatively small difference of temperature , 35 ' C. , vould have but a small effect on the magnetisation curve , but as the \#166 ; ontraction seems to depend on rather high powers of the magnetisa-ion , it might be expected that the effect would be more noticeable n the change of length than in the magnetisation .
Measurements were next made of the magnetisation and the effect of change of tension on the magnetisation , in order to calculate the quantity O'123 0'00587 1011 ' " * 10* el ap ( i ) , which was shown in the former paper to be the value of the elongation , Sl/ l , of the wire deduced from Kirchhoff 's theory .
For these measurements a coil of 611 turns of No. 40 double silk-covered and shellacked copper wire was wound cn the nickel wire near the middle , and connected in series with a ballistic galvanometer , and with the secondary of a standardising solenoid .
The magnetisation was determined by reversing a measured magnetising current , and the galvanometer standardised by reversing a current in the solenoid , the deflections being observed in the two cases .
The galvanometer was standardised before and after each set of readings .
Since the resistance in circuit with the galvanometer changed when the temperature of the coil on the nickel wire changed , care was taken that the temperature indicated by the coil thermometers was the same in the magnetisation and standardising experiments .
By using a series of different currents in the Standardising coil , it was verified that the " quantity of electricity " flowing through the galvanometer was proportional to the sine of half the deflection of the needle .
The deflections were observed by a telescope and scale at a distance of 124 cm .
In observing the influence of tension on magnetisation , galvanometer readings were taken first with a load of 1'4 kg .
on the wire , then after an additional weight of 7 kg .
was applied .
The magnetising current was reversed several times and the load applied and removed several times before readings were taken .
This v was repeated for various field strengths , ranging between 30 and if 320 C.G.S. , and with the coil at 10 ' 0 .
and 55 ' C. Then the magnetisation curve of increasing reversals was determined for the mean load 4'9 kg .
at both temperatures , after which the coil was \gt ; ' removed from the nickel wire , and observations made with load !
4'9 kg .
, and at the same two temperatures , of the magnetic contracts tion at a number of increasing field strengths , each field being i reversed several times before readings were taken .
Dr. E. Taylor Jones .
In order to make allowance for the slow time-change in the pro-1 perties of the wire , the determinations of magnetisation and effect !
of change of tension on magnetisation were then repeated , the I nickel wire being rewound with the same number of turns of insu- | lated copper wire .
Finally , the contraction of the wire was once more determined at I the temperature 10 ' C. Values of the expression ( 1 ) were calculated from both sets of I magnetisation observations , and the mean of the two sets compared I with the actual contraction observed between them .
The results are shown in Tables II , III , IV , V , VI , in which values of all the quantities ( obtained from the corresponding curves ) are given for the same set of field strengths .
In Tables IT , IV , the first column contains values of the field ' !
strength H , the second the magnetisation I at load 4'9 kg .
, the third * the change of magnetisation \#163 ; 1 accompanying an increase of load ) of 7 kg .
, the fourth the corresponding values of expression ( 1 ) , the calculated value of Sl/ l. The numbers in the second , third , !
and fourth columns were determined in November , 1897 .
The fifth , !
sixth , and seventh columns contain values of I , Si , and deter-1 mined in January , 1898 .
Tables III and V contain values of the field , the mean values of I S and Sljlcalculated from Tables II and IV , the actual change of !
length a in millionths^observed about the end of December , 1897,1 and the difference ( a Sl/ V ) between the observed and mean calculated 9 elongations .
Finally , in Table VI are given the values of I and Sljl , measured in January ; the mean a of the actual changes of length observed in December and in January , the latter being determined after the second set of magnetisation measurements ; and the difference , ( a ^/ 0\gt ; representing the corrected elongation at the time when the second set of measurements of I and SI/ S'P was made .
Tables II and IV show the nature of the slow time-change in the magnetic behaviour of^ the nickel wire , the magnetisation at any field and load being less in January than in November .
The effect of this change on SI/ SP is very marked at low fields , OD\#174 ; S1\#174 ; t at higher fields ; SI/ SP appears to diminish rapidly at OW e f 'as ^me Soes on* This is remarkable , because the magnetic contraction at low fields seemed to change but slowly with time , and more rapidly at higher fields .
w ckange of length observed in January was nearly the same as m December ( about four weeks earlier ) .
At medium fields it was ra er greater , but this may be due to a slight annealing caused by the repeated warming and cooling during the determinations of the magnetisation earlier in January .
On the Magnetic Deformation of Nickel .
49 A comparison of Tables II and IY , or III and V , shows again the i nature of the influence of temperature on magnetisation and contraction , but as the measurements at the two temperatures were not made quite at the same time , the results probably do not accurately represent this influence .
If the results given here are compared with those given in the former paper , it will be seen that the magnetic contraction at any field observed in December , 1897 ( Table III ) , is practically identical with the former value , but that the magnetisation curve is very different from the former one .
The present magnetisation is much greater at low and medium fields , but about the same as before at higher fields .
Further , the calculated value of the contraction is , especially at medium and high fields , considerably less than before .
Hence the " corrected " contraction \#151 ; ( a\#151 ; Bljl ) cannot now be the same function of the magnetisation as before ; it is , in fact , now much more nearly proportional to I6 , as the last two columns of Tables III , Y , and YI show .
It is impossible to say how much this discrepancy is due to the slow change which appears to be always going on in the magnetic properties of the nickel wire .
In the former experiments the magnetisation was determined first , and a short time after the elongation was observed , but no allowance was made for any change of magnetisation which might have taken place in the meantime .
Still , it is improbable that that would entirely account for the discrepancy .
Some of the above results are shown graphically in figs. 1 , 2 , 3 .
In fig. 1 the difference of ordinates of the highest and lowest curves for any value of the field H represents the effect on the magnetisation of changing the load from 1*4 kg .
to 8'4 kg .
, after the additional load of 7 kg .
has been applied and removed , and the field reversed , several times .
The intermediate curve is the magnetisation curve of increasing reversals for the mean load 4'9 kg .
These curves were determined in January , 1898 .
In fig. 2 the curves represent , as functions of the field , the observed contraction ( December , 1897 ) , the calculated contraction ( mean of f November , 1897 , and January , 1898 ) , and the corrected contraction , I i.e. , the difference between the observed and calculated contractions , The calculated contractions of November and January are represented by the points + + + . .
and \#169 ; \#169 ; \#169 ; . .
respectively .
The o observed contraction curve is practically the same as that given in | the former paper , but the calculated and corrected curves show - considerable differences .
In fig. 3 the points marked + -j- + . .
represent the corrected con-| traction as a function of I6 ( Table III ) , and these points lie nearly on a straight line through the origin .
The temperature during all the experiments represented by these curves was 10 ' C. Dr. E. Taylor Jones .

1 ( Abstract .
) The nature of the bard polished outer layer of the teeth of this [ I group of fishes has been from time to time a subject of discussion , I some authors holding that it is enamel , whilst others deny its claim | to be so styled .
The author describes its physical , chemical , and histological peculiarities , calling attention to its hardness , its optical properties , \#153 ; its almost entire solubility in weak acids , and to its tubularity , in all ; I of which respects it resembles unquestionably an enamel .
But it contains lacunar spaces , and presents a very distinct lami- | nation , parallel , or nearly so , with its surface , in which respect it is I unlike an enamel .
Still upon the balance of its characters it has much more in | common with enamel than with dentine , from which it is sharply Jl marked off by the entire absence of any collagen basis .
It m also shown that the tubular structure , which may be regarded\#153 ; as typical in these fish , passes by insensible gradations into a simple\#153 ; tissue differing but little from an ordinary enamel ; this is especially\#153 ; the case where the whole layer is thin , as in the Bays .
But the !
study of its development raises the difficulty afresh .
