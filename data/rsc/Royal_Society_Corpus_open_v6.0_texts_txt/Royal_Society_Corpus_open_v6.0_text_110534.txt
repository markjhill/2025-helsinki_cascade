Communicated by J. G. Chil ?
dren , Esq. , Sec. R.S. The method employed by the author for obtaining , by a com ?
bination of lenses , the convergence to foci of the colorific solar rays , together with the dispersion of the calorific rays , consists in making a beam of solar light , which contains both kinds of rays , pass , after it has been converged to a focus by a convex condensing lens , through a second convex lens , placed at a certain distance beyond that focus : that distance being so adjusted as that the calorific rays , which , from their smaller refrangibility , are collected into a focus more remote from the first lens than the colorific rays , and consequently nearer to the second lens , shall , on emerging from the latter , be either parallel or divergent ; while the colorific rays , which , being more refrangible , had been collected into a focus nearer to the first lens , and more distant from the second , will be rendered con ?
vergent by this second lens ; so that the second focus , into which they are thus collected , will exhibit a brilliant light without manifesting any sensible degree of heat .
The light so obtained may be advantageously applied to the solar , and to the oxy-hydrogen mi ?
croscopes , from its producing no injurious effects on objects enclosed in Canada balsam , or even on living animalcules exposed to its influence .
Another improvement in the construction of the microscope employed by the author , consists in the cell for holding objects being made to move quite independently of the field glass ; so that the best focus is obtained by an adjustment which does not disturb the field of view .
