P R E FACE .
At their meeting of March 22 , 1900 , the Council resolved:\#151 ; " That the Obituaries of deceased Fellows , in addition to appearing in the 'Year-Book , ' be issued , either yearly or at such other intervals as may seem desirable , in a volume uniform with the ' Proceedings .
' " The present volume , containing the Obituary Notices in the Year-Books for 1900 and 1901 is accordingly issued , and will be followed at suitable intervals by similar collections from future issues of the Year-Book .
Two or three notices will be found at the end of the collection which were not included in the Year-Book for 1901 .
It has been thought convenient to add a general index to all the Obituaries that have appeared in the volumes of the " Proceedings " since their publication was commenced , which was in vol. 10 , published in 1860 .
August , 1904.\#151 ; In consequence of a decision to begin a new Series of " Proceedings , " with the page enlarged to royal octavo , it has been decided to classify the obituary notices for the period 1900-1905 inclusive as four parts of a single volume , which will rank as the final volume , LXXV , of the present Series of " Proceedings .
" In the present re-issue of Part i some slight changes have been made , with this object in view .
Parts ii and iii have already been issued .
A title-page and contents of the whole volume will be issued along with Part iv .
After the completion of this volume the obituaries will be issued with the " Proceedings " ; they will be specially paged so as to form appendices to the volumes , and may be bound separately in case it is so desired .
