" On the Ganglia and Nerves of the Virgin Uterus .
" By Robert Lee , M.D. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. The author states that his recent dissections have enabled him to verify the descriptions he gave of the ganglia and nerves of the uterus in his papers already published in the Philosophical Transactions , and also to detect the existence of ganglia situated in the muscular coat of the uterus , and of plexuses of nerves accompanying all the blood-vessels and absorbents ramifying in its walls , between the peritoneum and lning membrane .
By examining the hearts of a foetus , of a child of six years of age , of an adult in the sound state , a human heart greatly hypertrophied , and the heart of an ox , he found that there exists a striking analogy between the ganglia and nerves of the uterus and those of the heart .
Ie ascertained by microscopic observation that the lmuscular and vascular structures of the auricles and ventricles are endowed with numerous ganglia and plexuses of nerves , which , as far as he knows , have not yet been described , and which enlarge simultaneously with the natural growth of the heart , and also continue to enlarge during its morbid conditions of hypertrophy .
The author also finds that the size of the ganglia and nerves of the left auricle and ventricle , in the normal state , is more than double that of the corresponding parts on the right side .
A description is then given of two elaborate drawings which accompany the paper .
