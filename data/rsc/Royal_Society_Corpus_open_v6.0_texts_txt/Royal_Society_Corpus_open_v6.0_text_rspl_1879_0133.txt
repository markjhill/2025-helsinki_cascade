T On the Absence of Potassium in Protagon.365 it 22 inches from the centre of the shoulder joint , we obtain for the \#171 ; S= 5-56 lbs.\#177 ; 0-125 ( probable error ) .
This result agrees remarkably well with the result \#171 ; =5'68 lbs. , Obtained by calculations founded on the Law of Fatigue , from the long series of observations detailed in this note .
y \#171 ; Qn the Absence of Potassium in Protagon prepared by r Dr. Gamgee .
" By H. E. Roscoe , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received April 29 , 1880 .
j Protagon is stated by Gamgee to contain no potassium .
Thudichum , on the other hand , asserts that this body contains from 07 to P6 per .cent , of this metal . .
[ In order to ascertain the quantity of potassium contained m protagon prepared by Gamgee , 5 grams of this material was completely burnt , leaving a residue of 0777 gram , consisting chiefly of meta-phosphoric acid .
On precipitating the potassium in the usual way , and on decomposing the platinochloride , a residue of 0-003 gram of platinum was obtained ; this corresponds to a percentage of 0'0236 of potassium on the protagon employed .
* Spectroscopic experiments , made upon solutions of the chloride and phosphate of potassium , and upon a solution of the latter salt with the addition of the relative quantity of phosphoric acid present in the ash , according to the above analysis , convinced me of the correctness of the conclusions contained in my letter printed on page 113 , vol. 30 , of the " Proceedings of the Royal Society .
