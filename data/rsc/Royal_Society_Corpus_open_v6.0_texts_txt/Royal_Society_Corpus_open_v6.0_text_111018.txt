Postscript to a paper " On the Ganglia and Nerves of the Heart , " with two drawings .
By Robert Lee , M.D. , F.R.S. The author states that since his former communication was presented to the Royal Society he has made a very minute dissection in alcohol of the whole nervous system of the young heifer 's heart .
In this preparation the distribution of the ganglia and nerves over the entire surface of the heart , and the relations of these structures to the blood-vessels and muscular substance , are considered by the author to be far more fully displayed than in any of his former dissections .
He states , that on the anterior surface there are distinctly visible to the naked eye , ninety ganglia or ganglionic enlargements on the nerves , which pass obliquely across the arteries and the muscular fibres of the ventricles from their base to the apex ; that these ganglionic enlargements are observed on the nerves , not only where they are crossing the arteries , but where they are ramifying on the muscular substance without the blood-vessels ; that on the posterior surface the principal branches of the coronary arteries plunge into the muscular substance of the heart near the base , and many nerves with ganglia accompany them throughout the walls to the lining membrane and column carnee .
The author considers that , in the accompanying beautiful drawings , Mr. West has depicted with the greatest accuracy and minuteness the whole nervous structures demonstrable in this preparation on the surface of the heart ; but that the ganglia and nerves represented in these drawings constitute only a small portion of the nervous system of the heart , numerous ganglia being formed in the walls of the heart which no artist can represent .
