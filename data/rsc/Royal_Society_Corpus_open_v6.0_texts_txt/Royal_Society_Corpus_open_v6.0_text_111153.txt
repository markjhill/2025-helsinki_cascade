" On the Automatic Temperature-compensation of the Force Magnetometers .
" By C. Brooke , M.B. , F.R.S. Received May 8 , 1851 .
After explaining the necessity of automatic temperature-compensation in these instruments in order to give the highest degree of accuracy to results deduced from the ordinates of the magnetic curves , the author infers from a reference to the formula expressing the conditions of equilibrium of the bifilar magnet , that the interval between the lower extremity of the suspension lines will be most advantageously submitted to some mechanical agency governed by change of temperature .
The object in view has been attained by attaching the lower ends of the suspension skein to the adjacent ends of two zinc tubes that are clamped to a glass rod which is attached at its middle point to the middle of the bar-magnet .
When the temperature rises , the ends of the skein will evidently be approximated to each other by a quantity that is equal to the difference of expansion of the lengths of zinc and glass intervening between the clamps .
The interval between the clamps is to be approximately determined by calculation , and corrected by experiment , so that the ratio of the expansion to the distance between the threads may be equal to the first term of the temperature coefficient .
In the balanced magnetometer the compensation is effected by means of a small thermometer attached to the magnet , the stem of which is parallel to the .
axis of the bare In this thermometer ; the size of the bulb , its distance from the freezing-point and length of the scale , may be so proportioned to each other , that the second as well as the first term of the temperature coefficient will be re.pre seated in the correction .
