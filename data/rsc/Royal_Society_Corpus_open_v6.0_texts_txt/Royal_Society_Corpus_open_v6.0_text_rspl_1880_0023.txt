uOn the Thermo-Electric Behaviour of Aqueous Solutions with Platinum Electrodes .
" By G. Gore , LL. D. , F.R.S Received November 13 , 1880 .
The object of the following research was to enable a comparison to be made of the results obtained in a previous investigation with mercurial electrodes ( see " On the Thermo-Electric Behaviour of Aqueous Solutions with Mercurial Electrodes , " " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 29 ) with those of platinum in similar liquids , in order to ascertain whether the results further confirmed the conclusion that the currents obtained with mercury were not at all due to chemical action j and also to draw from the results such additional inferences as were warranted .
The results of a former research , in which platinum electrodes were employed in a different apparatus ( see " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 27 ) could not be used for the purpose of comparison , because it was found necessary to use weaker solutions with mercurial electrodes ( in order to avoid chemical action ) than those used with platinum in that research .
The apparatus employed in the present investigation was precisely similar to that used in the one with mercury , with the exception that coiled ribbons of sheet platinum ( with attached wires of that metal ) were substituted for the layers of mercury .
The platinum ribbons were 27'5 millims. wide , and each had a total surface of 52,960 sq .
millims. , including both sides .
They were prepared for use at the outset by heating them to redness .
Between each experiment it was found necessary to thoroughly wash them , then immerse them in boiling distilled water during about ten or fifteen minutes , drain and dry them .
They were then simultaneously immersed in the liquid to be tested , the latter being at a temperature of about 55 ' F. A slight temporary deflection of the needles of the galvanometer was usually produced on immersion ; when the needles had settled at zero , heat was applied to one of the vessels , and its temperature raised to 180 ' F. , the deflection being noted .
After the experiment had been made , the two portions of liquid were mixed and cooled .
As this research was made chiefly for the purpose of comparing the thermo-electric behaviour of liquids with mercury to that with platinum , precisely similar liquids were employed to those used in the investigation referred to .
None of the solutions acted chemically ( in any perceptible degree ) upon platinum .
It was found necessary to preboil the solution about half-an-hour , in order to expel dissolved air ; otherwise the deflections obtained in repetition experiments were not uniform .
It was also found necessary to occasionally immerse the ribbons in a boiling-hot dilute solution of pure potassic hydrate , during 1880 .

Repetition experiments were made with each liquid , and , under the above conditions , the results obtained were usually very uniform , the variation of amount of deflection of the needles not often exceeding -jjalf a degree .
The galvanometer employed was the same as in the research referred to , and was used in the same manner .

On [ Dec. 10 In order to arrange these solutions in a series , according to thdJ various degrees of electromotive force , a similar plan was adopted to that employed when liquids of the same composition were used with mercurial electrodes ; viz. , two exactly similar apparatuses , with elec-trodes of the same dimensions , were employed , one being charged with one solution , and the other with the solution next to it in tW above series .
The apparatuses were connected with the wires of the differential galvanometer in such a manner that the two current* passed through the two coils in opposite directions ; the direction and amount of deflection being noted when the liquid in one vessel of each apparatus was at 160 ' F. The series thus obtained is so arranged that the couple giving the strongest positive current is at the top , and that giving the most powerful negative current at the bottom , as in the list already given .
The solutions in which hot platinum was positive are separated from those in which it was negative by a horizontal line as in the above series .
The positions of the solutions in the two series , although they agree very closely , are not identical ; for instance , the two solutions of formiate of sodium occupy respectively the seventh and tenth places in the first series , and the third and eighth in the second series ; the positions of a few other solutions are also changed , but not to so great an extent .
It will be observed that these two series agree more closely than did those obtained with mercury , and this may , perhaps , be accounted for by the fact that in these the superficial area of the platinum electrodes was the same , whereas in the others the mercurial surfaces were not equal in amount .

The total differences 12*25 and 4*0 in this series agree as nearly as could be expected with the maximum deflections 11*0 and 4*25 in the iprevious series .
Remarks.\#151 ; The strength of the solution was found to have but .little influence upon the direction of the current .
Increase of strength of solution increased the amount of deflection in solutions of cyanide of potassium , sulphite of sodium , and selenic acid , and to a less extent in those of formiate of sodium , formic acid , microcosmic salt , and ammonia alum .
With the solutions of sulphuric acid , those of intermediate strength ( 1 in 40 ) gave a greater deflection at 180 ' F. than either a stronger or weaker one .
No other instance occurred in which a solution gave a I greater deflection at the temperature of 180 ' F. than a stronger solution ; of the same substance .
On comparing the results now found with platinum with those previously obtained with mercury , it will be seen that the two sets are very similar .
The conclusions , therefore , which have already been drawn from the former apply largely to the latter , and need not be repeated .
The chief conclusion , viz. , that the currents previously obtained with mercury were really due to'heat and not to minute amounts of chemical action , is largely confirmed by the present research .
The chemical relations of mercury being considerably different from those of platinum in special cases , if the currents were due to chemical action , the two sets of results would have been widely divergent in their orders .

' Influence of [ Dec. 16 Agitation of the immersed metals is well known to influence th current .
Shaking one of the metals reversed occasionally the direc tion of the current ; palladium was the metal which most frequently manifested this effect .
The agitation of that metal rendered it either more negative or less positive in a considerable degree , especially bj solutions of potassic chloride and cyanide .
In those of the bromi\lt ; J|i i antimony was the metal , the current from which was most affected by shaking .
The effect of shaking was less in the iodide solutions than in those of the bromide .
Note.\#151 ; Some years ago I made a note as follows : " If water is nearly saturated with a suitable salt at 15'C .
, and the upper part is then kept hotter and the lower part colder than that temperature for a long time , will the upper part become stronger and the lower weaker p " Recently , since this research was completed , the following ] statements have been published : ( see " Nature , " vol. xxii , p. 356,1 August 12 , 1880 , also vol. xxiii , p. 207 , December 30,1880 ) " Influence !
of Temperature on the Distribution of Salts in their Solutions , " by !
M. Soret .
" The concentration of the heated part diminishes , that of the cold increases .
The difference grows with the original concentration , and nearly in proportion .
In the series of the alkaline chlorides the difference is greater ( for the same concentration ) the higher the molecular weight of the salt .
The phenomenon seems to have no relation to solubility of the salt .
" If these statements are correct ( as is very likely ) they affect to a slight extent all the results of the present research ( and of other researches ) on the thermoelectric behaviour of solutions , because they show that the chemical composition of the aqueous solution is slightly altered by the rise of temperature .
If also the strength of the thermo-electric currents of liquids depends upon the degree of amplitude of vibration of the molecules of the salt , \amp ; c. , in solution , it will probably vary , in the case of solutions of alkaline chlorides , with the degree of concentration of the solutions , and the molecular weights of the salts , like the phenomena in M. Soret 's experiments .
