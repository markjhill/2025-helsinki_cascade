Further Observations on the Spectra of some of the Nebul'e , with a Mode of determining the Brightness of these Bodies .
" By WILLIAM IIUGGINS , F.R.S. Received January 30 , 1866 .
( Abstract .
) In the first part of this paper the author continues his observations on the spectra of nebulae and clusters .
The results already presented by him to the Royal Society are confirmed by his new observations , namely , that with his apparatus clusters and nebulae give either a continuous spectrum or a spectrum consisting of one , two , or three bright lines .
The positions in the spectrum of these lines are the same as those of the bright lines of the nebule described in his former papers .
On account of the faintness of these objects the author was not able to ascertain whether the continuous spectra which some of the nebule give are interrupted by dark lines in a manner similar to the spectra of the sun and fixed stars .
Some of these spectra appear irregularly bright in some parts of the spectrum .
The nebule which follow have a spectrum of one , two , or three bright lines ; in addition to which , in the case of some of them , a faint continuous spectrum was visible .
These bodies are probably gaseous in constitution .

The second part of the paper contains an account of a mode of determining approximatively the intrinsic brightness of some of the nebulae .
Analysis by the prisms shows that some of the nebulae consist of luminous gas existing in masses , which are probably continuous ; and the nebulae in the telescope present not points , but surfaces , in some cases , subtending a considerable angle .
' As long as an object remains of sensible size in the telescope it retains its original brightness , except as this may ; be diminished by a possible power of extinction belonging to celestial space , and by the absorptive power of the earth 's atmosphere .
By means of a special apparatus the light of three nebulse was compared with the light emitted by a sperm candle , burning at the rate of 158 grs. per hour .
The results are thatThe intensity of nebula , No. 46281 H. IV.= th part of that ofthecandle .
, , , annular nebula in Lyra ==-7nd , , , , , , Dumb-bell nebula -=alth , , , The estimation in each case refers to the brightest'part of the nebula .
The amounts are too small by the unknown corrections for the loss which the light has sustained in its passage through space and through the earth 's atmosphere .
These values have an importance in connexion with the gaseous nature of the source of the light , which the spectroscope indicates .
Similar estimations made at considerable intervals of time might show whether the brightness of these bodies is undergoing increase , diminution , or a periodic variation .
The paper concludes with some observations on the measures of the diameters of some of the planetary nebulae .
A very careful set of measures of 4232 , 5 2 , by the Rev. W. R. Dawes , F.R.S. , is given , which makes the equatorial diameter= 15 ' 9 .
Also measures by the author of 1414 , 73 H. IV .
which give its diameter in R. A.=30"'8 .
