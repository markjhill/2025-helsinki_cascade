( Abstract .
) Since this paper was read the author has made several observations of the quantity of light transmitted by object-glasses , and determined the index of absorption in various specimens of glass .
The results of some of these are in accordance with the opinion expressed in the paper ; but others present a difference which is very satisfactory as indicating a surprising progress in the manufacture of optical glass .
The observations were made by means of Zollner 's photometer .
The following results were obtained for the intensity of the light transmitted by a variety of object-glasses : Description .

320 ... 07393 Of the above , a belongs to the Armagh Observatory ; it is by one of the Dollonds , older than 1790 , and is probably one of their first attempts at a triple combination .
b is the original object-glass of the Armagh circle ; it was made by Tulley about 1828 ; the crown is greenish , and is supposed to be English ; the flint is believed to have been from Daguet .
c was made for the author by Tulley in 1838 ; its glass is French , the crown is greenish .
d is by Cauchoix ; the crown is greenish , and has probably a high n , but its mean thickness is only 0'39 .
e is by Messrs. Cooke ; the glass is Chance 's .
f is by Grubb , the glass Chance 's : the very high transmission of this lens is in part due to the cementing of the adjacent surfaces , which , while it makes more difficult the correction of spherical aberration , removes almost entirely the reflection at a surface of crown and one of flint : the factor for this =0-9036 ; and if the I be multiplied by this , we obtain 0'7806 , nearly that of e , the difference being due to the reflectiln at the film of cement .
g is also by Grubb , and cemented ; the glass is by Chance .
A is by Fraunhofer .
On examining this Table the progressive increase in the light of the object-glasses is evident .
The first two , which may be considered good specimens of the early achromatics , have less illuminating-power than the Herselielian reflector .
A great advance was made by Guinand and those who followed in his steps ; and a still greater one by Chance , whose glass is nearly perfect as to colour and transparency .
The same inference follows from the author 's measure of the index of 2A2 " absorption , .
The specimens examined wre , with two exceptions , prisms ; and this form is very convenient .
If a ray is incident on an isosceles prism parallel to its base , it emerges parallel to itself after undergoing total internal reflection at the base ; and the length of the path of the light within the glass , and the loss by the two reflections , are easily calculated from the known angle and refractive index .
The mean index used in the calculation was that of the line E. The results are given in the following Table , in which are introduced those given in the paper that they may be referred to at once ; and there is added to them one found in Bouguer 's 'Traite d'Optique , ' which seems trustworthy .

0'0090 No. 1 was shown to the author in 1830 by Captain Kater , as the chefd'cuvre of the Glass-Committee ; he used it as the small speculum of his Newtonian .
Afterwards it came into the possession of the late Lord Rosse , who made the above measures with Bunsen 's photometer in 1848 .
It is English plate , greenish .
Nos. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 were measured by Mr. Grubb in 1857 .
No. 5 was a prism of 90 ? .
He does not remember its history ; but evidently it was of Chance 's glass .
No. 6 is described by Bouguer as " glace , " 3 Paris inches thick .
It was probably that of St. Gobain , which has probably not varied in composition , and its !
a has been used in the computation .
No. 7 consists of two prisms of 60 ?
, which Mr. Gassiot , with his*'wonted kindness , entrusted to the author for some inquiries about the improvement of the spectroscope .
They are by Merz , of glass which seems nearly identical with Faraday 's dense glass , having a specific gravity of 5-1 , and a mean p =17664 .
It is very pellucid , but , like its prototype , has a yellowish tinge , probably given by the large proportion of lead .
As Merz does not polish the base or ends of his prisms , the usual method could not be employed ; but the prisms were put together with the angles opposed , and a drop of olive-oil between , and the reflections allowed for .
The great absorption is remarkable , and apparently cannot be explained by the colour of the glass .
No. 8 is of 60 ?
; its p for E= 1620 .
It is free from colour , and an evident improvement on the earlier ones .
No. 9 , a prism of 90 ?
, was given to the author by Dr. Lloyd for a small mirror in the Newtonian form of the Armagh 15-inch reflector ; its / for E= 16188 .
No. 10 , of 90 ?
, was obtained by the late Lord Rosse to be similarly used in his 3-feet Newtonian ; its p for E= 1-5321 .
No. 11 , of 60 ?
, obtained at Munich in 1837 .
For these measures the ends were polished flat ; its Mt for E= 1'6405 .
These three show considerable progress , and an object-glass made of such materials would have a great power of transmission , though much behind the following .
No. 12 is of 90 ? .
Its glass is from Chance ; its / for E=-16216 .
No. 13 is a cylinder 2'2 inches in diameter , and 4'3 long , which Mr. Grubb obtained from Messrs. Chance for these measures ; its , for E= 15200 .
No. 14 is a cylinder got at the same time , 2'1 inches in diameter and 4'4 long ; its u for E=1 6126 ; the ends of both are polished flat , and they are of wonderful transparency .
If , as there is good ground for hoping , Messrs. Chance shall succeed in manufacturing large disks of the same perfection as these two cylinders , the author 's comparison of the achromatic and the reflector must be considerably modified .
Assuming n='02 , he calculates that the aperture of an achromatic , of focal length equal to 18 times the aperture , equivalent to a 4-feet Newtonian , is 35*435 inches .
This aperture would be diminished if the process of cementing were found applicable to lenses of such magnitude .
The author concludes with suggesting that , as very slight variations in the manufacture of glass seem to make great changes in its absorptive power , it would be prudent to examine the value of n in the disks intended for lenses of any importance .
This could be done by polishing a couple of facets on their edges , and need not involve the sacrifice of many minutes .
