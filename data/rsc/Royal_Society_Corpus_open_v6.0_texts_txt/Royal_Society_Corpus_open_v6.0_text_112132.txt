V. Action of Zinc upon a mixture of Ethyl Oxalate and Amyl Iodide .
" By EDWARD FRANKLAND , F.R1.S .
, and B. F. DUPPA , Esq. Received March 30 .
When a mixture of equivalent proportions of ethyl oxalate and amyl iodide is digested with granulated zinc at 70 ?
C. , the zinc is gradually dissolved , while much hydride of amyl and amylene are given off .
The mixture finally assumes a viscous or semisolid condition , and , when treated with water , produces a further quantity of hydride of amyl , which distils off at a gentle heat .
On the subsequent application of a higher temperature , water , accompanied by amylic alcohol , amyl iodide , and an ethereal liquid , distils over , the three latter forming a mixture , the separation of which into its component parts presents rather formidable difficulties .
After drying with chloride of calcium , this oily mixture begins to boil at about 3 32 ' C. ; the product first passing over consists principally of amylic alcohol , mixed with amyl iodide .
Afterwards the thermometer rapidly rises to 2000 C. , between which temperature and 205 ' C. a considerable section of the remaining liquid , which we will call A , passes over .
There then occurs a further rapid rise of temperature until the thermomleter remains stationary betweeni 222 ?
and 226 ? .
The section collected between these points we will call B. Finally , the temperature rises to 260 ?
-264 ?
, between which points the remaining liqulid ( C ) passes over .
By repeated fractional distillation , the larger portioni of the section A was obtained at the liearly fixed boiling-point of 2030 ?
C. This liquid was submitted to analysis , and yielded numbers closely corresponding with the formula C9 HI 03 .
Interpreted by further results detailed below , this formula resolves itself into II C2t OTIL C 0( K OC2 H-I .
The ethereal body with the lowest boiling-point produced in this reaction is therefore ethylic amnylohyc7Iroxalate , or oxalic ether in which one atom of oxygen is replaced by one atom of amyl and one of hydrogen .
This body also stands in very close relation to lactic ether ; for if the atomn of methyl in lactic ether be replaced by amnyl , ethylic amylohydroxalate is produced .

We have not attempted to give a name to the body from which ethylic amylohydroxalate is directly produced by the action of water , as shown in the last of the foregoing equationis .
The resources of chernical noinenclature , already too severely taxed , would scarcely be able to elaborate a rationial name for this body , which consists of oxalic ether whereini an atom of oxygen is replaced , half by amyl and half by zinernonamyl , whilst a second atom of zinemonamyl is substituted for one of ethyl .
Ethylic amylohydroxalate is a somewhat oily , transparent , and slightly straw-coloured liquid of specific gravity 9449 at 130 C. , possessing a pleasanit aromatic odouir and a burning taste .
It boils at 2030 C. , and has a vapour-density of 5A47 .
The above formula requires 6'0 , which is removed to an unusual extent from the experimental number .
To this discrepancy we shall again refer presently .
Section B of the oily liquiid , after careful rectification , gave a product boiling at 224-225 ?
, and yielded oln analysis results agreeing with the formula C1 1 22 03 This formula might be interpreted as that of ethylic amiyloethkoxalate , the rational formula of which wotild be C5"1 ' 1 C2 0HK OC2 115 .
We were at first inclined to regard this as the actual constitution of the new ether , believing it to be possible that ethylic oxalate and amvlic iodide mutally decomposed each other , producing a mixture of amylic and ethylic oxalates with the iodides of amyl and ethyl .
Aui analogous decomposition of mixed ethereal salts of oxygen acids has been recently noticed , but the test of experiment obliged us to abandon this view of the reaction .
We found , it is true , a remarkable depressionof temperature , amounting to 9.30 C. , on mixing one atom of ethyl oxalate with onie of amylic iodide , but on submitting the mixture to distillation , the thermometer rose to the boiling-point of amylic iodide ( 147 ?
) before ebullition commenced ; thus showing that none of the much more volatile ethylic iodide had been formed .
No transfer of radicals therefore takes place when ethylic oxalate is heated with amylic iodide , and consequently no zincethyl can be formed when this mixture is acted upon by zinc .
We therefore prefer to view the ether nOW ulder consideration as ethylic ethyl-amyliydroxalate , analogous in constitution to Wurtz 's ethylic ethyl lactate .

Ethylic ethyl-amylhydroxalate is a straw-coloured oily liquid , possessing ani aromatic but somewhat amylic odour and a burning taste .
Its specific gravity was found to be 9399 at 13 ?

Ethylic diamyloxalate closely resembles the two foregoing ethers in its appea rance and properties .
It is , however , a thicker oil , and flows less readily , and it has the lowest specific gravity of any ether beloinging to this series , its denlsity at 13 ' C. being ' only *9137 .
The following comparison of the specific gravities of all the ethers of this series shows that they generally increase inversely as their atomic weights .

The investigationi of these ethers has revealed a tendency to dissociation increasing with the weight of the atoms replacing the atom of oxygen in oxalic ether .
Thus , beginning with lactic ether , which has the normal vapour-density , we fined a gradual divergence culminlating in ethylic diamyloxalate , as seen from the following series of numbers Vapour-densities .

C14128103 80 4 5.9 We have likewise prepared the acids corresponding to the three ethers above mentioned .
The first is obtained by decomposing ethylic amylhydroxalate with baryta , treating the solution of the barium-salt thus obtained with excess of sulphuric acid , and then dissolving out the organic acid with ether .
On evaporating the ethereal solution , the acid remains as a thick oil which does not crystallize after several days ' exposure over sulphuiric acid in vacuo .
The calciumand barium-salts form white crystalline masses , which exhibit respectively the composition ( C51El ) ( C.5 11102 1 11 I2 1 f2 Cf ( 0_1)3 and C , ( 0 11)2 0Q0 a We have also obtained a beautifully crystalline acid of the same composition , and perfectly pure , from its zinic-salt , which is cointained in the residue remaining after the distillation of the three ethers above described .
Amylhydroxalic acid prepared from this zinc-salt is but sparingly soluble in water , from which , however , it crystallizes in magnificent nacreous scales that fuse at 60 ? ?
5 C. , but afterwards remain liquid for some time even at ordiniary temperatures ; they are very unlictuous to the touch , and readily soluble in alcohol and ether .
Several analyses gave results closely corresponding with the formula C2 , OHI0 Q Oil .
The barium-salt of this acid crystallizes in large and beautiful nacreous scales like paraffin , tolerably soluble in water , and exhibiting , the composition ( ( C5 H11 , )2 H2 Ct ( OHt ) , 0 , C0 Ball 0 .
We have also prepared a copper salt which is deposited from its aqueous solution in the form of minute light-blue scales , very sparingly soluble in water .
The numbers obtainied by the analysis of this salt agree with the formula V ( C5 H11)2 H2C ( 0 H)2 I oCr By the decomposition of ethylic ethyl-amylhydroxalate with alcoholic potash , subsequent addition of sulphuric acid in excess , and treatmentwith ether , the corresponding acid was obtained as a thick oil , gradually solidifying to a crystalline mass , which , however , did not appear to be in a fit state for the determination of its fusing-point .
We have examined the bariumand silver-salts of this acid , which have respectively the following composition : ( CHI )2 CC , Hl H1 C4 &lt; ( O 0 , and C. OC2 H0 X OBall 0 Ag arium ethylSilver etAyl .

Ethylic diamnyloxalate is readily decomposed by baryta-water .
After removing the excess of baryta in the usual manner , barium diamyloxalate crystallizes on evaporationi in minute elastic needles , which , when dry , have the appearanice of wool .
It is moderately soluble in .
hot water , but sparingly so in cold .
This salt gave numbers on analysis closely corresponding with the formula r(C5 1111)4 l(011)2 C4 &lt; -02 0.Bal 0B " Tf barium diamyloxalate be dissolved in hot dilute alcohol , and excess of sulphuric acid be added , the liquid after filtration contains diamyloxalic acid in solution .
On heating upon a water-bath , the alcohol gradually evaporates , and diamyloxalic acid crystallizes in the hot solution as a beautiful nletwork of brilliant silky fibres , which , after being well washed in cold water and dried at 100 ?
, yielded on analysis numbers closely corresponding with the formula { ( Cs 11h1)2 20 0OII .
Diamyloxalic acid presents the appearance of colourless satiny fibres , which are insoluble in water , but soluble in alcohol and ether .
This acid is remarkable for its high melting-point , 122 ?
C. , in which respect it surpasses any of the acids of this series .
Its melting-point is very sharply defined , and it solidifies immediately on a very slight reduction of temperature .
Heated more strongly , it sublimes and condenses on a cold surface in white crystalline flakes like snow .

Action of Zinc upon Amylic Oxalate and Ethylic Iodide .
Equivalent proportions of amylic oxalate and ethylic iodide were digested at.50 ' to 60 ?
C. , with excess of granulated zinc , for several days .
The reaction proceeded with extreme sluggishness , and was not completed before the expiration of a week .
Being then mixed with water and submitted to distillation , an oily liquid passed over , which , on rectification , was ultimately resolved into amylic alcohol and an ethereal liquid , which analysis proved to be amylic leucate .
The two consecutive reactions by which this body is produced are expressed in the following equations ( 0 F~~~~~~~~-(C2 T5)2 C { ?

Amylic leucate is a colourless , transparent , and slightly oily liquid , possessing a fragrant odour of a somewhat amylic character .
It is insoluble in water , but miscible in all proportions with alcohol and ether .
Its specific gravity is -9,3227 at 13 ?
C. It boils constantly at 225 ' C. , and its vapour has a dlensity of 6-74 ( theoretical 6 97 ) .
The boiling-point and specific gravity , in the liquid form , of amylic lencate and its isomer , ethylic amylethoxalate , are almost absolutely identical .
Leucate of amyl is readily decomposed by either aqueous or alcoholic solutions of the alkalies , or by baryta-water , yielding amylic alcohol and a leucate of the base .
No. VII .
Action of Zinc upon a mixture of Am.yl Oxalate and Amyl Iodide .
When equivalent proportions of the amyl iodide aild amyl oxalate are heated gently in conitact with zinc , a brisk reaction soon sets in .
After evolving much hydride of amyl and amylene , the wholo solidifies to a gum-like mass , which , on distillation with water , yields an oily liquid resembling that obtainled when ethyl oxalate is employed .
We have every reason to believe that the same series of ethers as those described in note No. V. are here produced , with the difference that they are amylic , instead of ethylic ethers .
This difference of base , however , renders it impossible successfully to separate these ethers from each other , their boiling-points being so high as to determine decomposition when their distillation is attempted .
We might , it is true , have decomposed the mixed ethers with solution of baryta , and thus have obtained the mixed acids , but the task of disentangling the latter appeared also so hopeless , that we have not attempted it .
