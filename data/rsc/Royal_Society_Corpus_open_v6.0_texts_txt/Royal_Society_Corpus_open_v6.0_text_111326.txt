( Abstract .
) After stating the results of experiments , made under the superintendence of the Kew Committee , for the construction of a barometer tube of large diameter by the usual method of boiling the mercury in the tube , the author proceeds to describe a method of filling a tube with the aid of an air-pump .
In this process , which is fully detailed in the paper , the tube is so constructed , that when the air has been extracted from it , the mercury enters by atmospheric pressure , provision being made for entirely removing the air which the air-pump has failed to extract .
By this method a barometer tube of 11 inch internal diameter has been satisfactorily prepared at the Kew Observatory .
The author then describes the mounting and mode of observing the standard barometer , proceeds to explain the processes adopted in the verification of barometers , and gives a detailed description of the apparatus for determining the errors of barometers at different atmospheric pressures .
