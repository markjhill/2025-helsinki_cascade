" An Account of the Newtonian Dial presented to the Royal Society , in a letter to the President .
" By the Rev. Charles Tumor , F.R.S. The dial here described was taken down in the early part of the present year from the south wall of the Manor-house of Woolsthorpe , a hamlet to Colsterworth in the county of Lincoln , the birth-place of Newton .
It was marked on a large stone at the angle of the building , and about six feet from the ground .
The name of NEWTON , with the exception of the first two letters , which have been obliterated , are inscribed under the dial in wide and capital letters .
The gnomon has disappeared many years ago .
