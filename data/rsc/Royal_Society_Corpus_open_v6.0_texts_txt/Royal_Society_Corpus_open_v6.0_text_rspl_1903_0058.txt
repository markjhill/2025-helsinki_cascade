[ .June 12 , " The Action of Choline , Neurine , Muscarine , and Betaine on Isolated Nerve and upon the Excised Heart .
" By A. D. Waller , M.D. , F.R.S. , and S. C. M. Sowton .
Received June 12 , \#151 ; Read June 18 , 1903 .
In connection with the identification by Halliburton and Mott of choline in morbid cerebro-spinal fluid , we compared the action upon isolated nerve and upon the excised heart of the four closely related organic bases : choline , C5H15NO2 ; neurine , C5H13NO ; muscarine , C5Hi3N02 ; and betaine , C5H13N03 ; we have also , thanks to the kindness of Professor Wright and of Mr. Plimmer , taken occasion to examine in a similar manner certain pathogenic toxines , viz. : snake venom ( Calmette ) , diphtheria toxin , and tetano-toxin .
According to previous investigators , muscarine is powerfully toxic , arresting the heart in diastole ( Schmiedeberg ) ; neurine has an action resembling that of muscarine ; choline ( which formerly was not distinguished from neurine ) has a less powerful action than that of neurine , and betaine is considered to be an inert substance .
( With-regard to their possible action upon nerve , there are , so far as we know , no definite observations .
) The direct action of muscarine upon nerve was incidentally examined by one of us in a general survey |of Hhe action upon nerve of a series of vegetable alkaloids ; that of choline and neurine was examined in comparison with a cerebrospinal residue and briefly reported upon at the Cambridge Congress of Physiology ( 1897 ) .
At that time , confining ourselves to a procedure in which the nerve was submitted to observation for a period not exceeding one hour , interrupted by a period of immersion of one minute duration , we found that muscarine was to be ranked with alkaloids possessing " little or no action " upon nerve , with , however , the express reservation that " such a statement must not be taken as committing us to a denial of any action whatever by the drug , acting in stronger solution or for a longer period .
" And in point of fact , muscarine which , under the conditions systematically observed by us at the outset of these observations , is to be classified as inactive , is manifestly active ( a ) in stronger solution for the same short period of immersion , and ( b ) in the same weak solution for a longer period of immersion .
The former of these two statements is illustrated by fig. 1 ( 3319 ) , giving the effect of muscarine nitrate in 10-per cent , solution acting for one minute ; the latter statement by e.g. , fig. 4 ( vide infra ) , which represents the course of an observation extending over 60 hours , in which two nerves were three times submitted to prolonged immersion in a 1-per cent , solution of muscarine hydrochloride .
1903 .
] Action of Choline , Neurine , , and Betaine .
321 As regards choline , neurine , and the cerebro-spinal residue our report of a summary examination of these three bodies was to the effect that choline as compared with neurine was inert , that cerebrospinal residue was inert while fresh , but became active when oxidised , and that " as regards an action upon isolated nerve the order of efficacy of the samples in our possession was ( 1 ) neurine , ( 2 ) muscarine , ( 3 ) choline."* This result , although accurate for the particular samples in our hands , was , however , vitiated by an error in their description .

3313 to 3317 , was in reality the base neurine , which in 25-per cent , solution has a basic reaction requiring for its neutralisation 2 vols .
of normal acid .
The effects of 4 , 2 , 1 , and \ and \ per cent , solutions of neurine are , therefore , partly or wholly basic effects by 0*32 , 0*16 , 0*08 , 0'04 , and 0*02 solutions of normal alkali .
These effects were in fact such as we are accustomed to expect from other basic solutions such as potash or soda , of strength ranging from 0'20 to 0'05 normal ( acid and alkali ) .
A strict comparison between the two bodies requires the use of both bodies as bases , neither of which conditions we have yet found means to fulfil .
For , on the one hand , neurine when neutralised by an acid ( e.g. , hydrochloric ) , is decomposed to an ammonium salt , etc. , on the other , choline as base is extremely unstable .
A fresh series of experiments for determining the relative .
effects of choline and neurine upon isolated nerve was made in the summer of 1900 .

[ June 12 , substances : choline and neurine pure , choline hydrochloride , and neurine hydrochloride .
These were used in solutions of 10 per cent , or less , and in the case of the pure substances both unneutralised and neutralised solutions were tried .
Series of nerves were immersed ( a ) for 1 minute , ( b ) for 30 minutes , the experiments being photographically recorded .
At the end of each experiment the nerve was replaced in physiological saline , and some hours later , usually the next morning , having received a new transverse section , it was again tested in order to ascertain whether any effect that had been recorded was permanent or merely temporary .
In making up solutions of choline the question arose as to whether physiological saline or distilled water should be used .
Saline being inadmissible in the case of neurine , the comparisons to be made would be more fair , it seemed , if all solutions were made with distilled water .
In working , however , with choline hydrochloride , a solution was made up with saline , and a second one with distilled water , in order by comparing the effects of the two , to estimate roughly what proportion of any effect obtained should be attributed to the action of the distilled water .
In the course of former experiments some attention had already been paid to the separate action of distilled water upon nerve , and immersion for 30 minutes was found to diminish its electromobility .
But between the two choline hydrochloride Fig. 2.\#151 ; Distilled water .
voLC .002-1 .oo/ - 15 hours jb solutions no great difference of effect could be noticed .
After this first trial the solutions of both choline and neurine were made up with distilled lyater only .
A 1-minute bath of choline hydrochloride at 10 per cent , has little or no effect upon nerve response .
A 30-minute bath of the same solution diminishes the deflection , but soakage for some hours in physiological saline restores completely the electromobility of the nerve .
The drug then may be said to be active in strong solutions applied for a considerable time\#151 ; it cannot be characterised as " toxic .
" With neurine hydrochloride in 10 per cent , solution the effect of a 1-minute bath is diminution of the electromobility of the nerve , similar in degree to that observed after 30 minutes of choline hydrochloride of the same strength , but the nerve treated with neurine gives after Table A.\#151 ; Choline Hydrochloride U ) tc No. of plate .

] Action of Choline , Neurine , Muscarine , and Betaine .
325 long soaking in physiological saline either a much-reduced deflection or none at all .
One exceptional case was recorded : on Plate 3653 , the effect of neurine hydrochloride for 1 minute is marked augmentation , and the nerve on being tested the next day gave a good deflection .
With a 30-minute bath of neurine hydrochloride the effect is usually abolition immediate and final .
In two cases a very small deflection was recorded after the bath ( Plates 3650 , 3657 ) , but in no case was there any subsequent recovery .
Pure choline , giving an alkaline reaction , was first tested in its non-neutralised state .
Immersion of the nerves for 1 minute had always some effect , though not a marked one .
Out of six records taken , three show slight diminution , the other three slight augmentation .
Four of the nerves were tested the next day and gave deflections , three of them large ones .
The two other nerves were subjected the same day to the longer bath\#151 ; 30 minutes\#151 ; with the result recorded on plates 3666 , 3667 , viz. , diminution to a mere trace within 20 minutes and abolition within 12 minutes ; both , however , gave small deflections on being tested the following day .
In three other experiments with a bath of 30 minutes the deflection was reduced , markedly in two cases\#151 ; but there was partial recovery by the next day .
In the remaining case the diminution was less marked on the record , but there was no after recovery .
To obtain a 10-per cent , neutralised solution of choline , 1 vol. 20 per cent , choline was mixed with 1 vol. sulphuric acid n/ 10 .
The effect upon nerve was less marked than in the case of pure choline solution , which had shown one example of final abolition ; the neutralised solution gave , for the most part , diminution , but the recovery was apparently more complete than with pure choline .
In one experiment ( 3672 ) the deflection next day was very small .
Pure neurine non-neutralised was found as in former experiments to be very toxic to nerve .
At 10 , 8 , 5 , and 4 per cent. , immersion for 1 minute abolished all response .
( The one exceptional case recorded , Plate 3612 , where the effect was only slight diminution , we cannot attempt to explain ; at 2 per cent.\#151 ; 1 minute bath\#151 ; the deflection was abolished , but there was partial recovery by the next day .
) At 1 per cent.\#151 ; 1 minute\#151 ; there was diminution or abolition with recovery .
The results obtained with neutralised neurine were not very satisfactory .
The neurine was received from Messrs. Merck in a 25-per cent , solution and required for the neutralisation 2 vols of normal sulphuric acid .
A glance at the table of experiments will show how uncertain are the effects as compared with those of neurine hydrochloride .
For instance , Nos. 3619 and 3620 were a pair of nerves subjected to a 1-minute bath of 8 per cent , neutralised neurine ; there was little or no effect upon either nerve , they were then further Table C , No. of plate .

] Action of Choline , Neurine , Muscarine , and Betaine .
331 immersed for 30 minutes in the same solution , with the result , in the first case , of diminution followed by recovery , in the second case , of abolition with no subsequent recovery .
In 3617 the 30-minute bath was of the same strength as before , its effect was immediate abolition , but the nerve gave a deflection the next morning .
In 3623 there was also immediate abolition , but in this case it was final .
Nos. 3625 and 3627 may also be contrasted , in each case 30 minutes immersion in a 4-per cent , solution produced a slight augmentation of response , but tested the next morning the one gave a deflection and the other none .
It would appear , therefore , that neurine hydrochloride is much more suitable for such experiments as these than neutralised neurine .
We should mention that the frogs were in bad condition at the time these experiments were made , the weather being very hot .
But this element of uncertainty would not alone account for the marked inequalities noticed .
Betaine Hydrochloride.\#151 ; We made use of two samples of this substance , one coming from Merck 's factory , the other from the laboratory of Professor Boehm .
The salt in each case when dissolved in 10-per cent , solution in normal saline had a strongly acid reaction , requiring for neutralisation half its volume of normal soda solution .
The effects of unneutralised solutions at 10 , 5 , 4 , 2 , and 1 per cent , are therefore partly or wholly acidic effects by 050 , 0*25 , 0'20 , 0T0 , 0-05 solutions of normal acid .
We did not , however , work with these , but with neutralised solutions .
Method .
Nerve.\#151 ; The excised sciatic nerve of frog , kept not longer than 24 hours in physiological saline , is laid across two pairs of unpolarisable electrodes in a moist chamber .
The normal excitatory effect ( negative variation ) is observed , preferably after as well as before the cut end of the nerve has been refreshed by a new transverse section .
The nerve is then put to soak in the experimental solution , and from time to time replaced upon the electrodes to be tested as before .
If , and when the excitatory effect is abolished , both before and after a fresh transverse section , the nerve is put to soak in physiological saline , and from time to time tested as before for a possible recovery of electromobility .
Proceeding thus we are enabled to qualify any given solution as being : 1 ' inert or weak , 2 ' moderately active , 3 ' strong according as the electromobility of the nerve is : 1 ' unaffected or little affected by the solution , 2 ' abolished by the solution and restored by soakage in physiological saline , 3 ' abolished by the solution and not restored iii saline .
The circumstances of experiment , strength , and duration of excitation , distance between electrodes , are , of course , maintained unvaried .
The unavoidable variations of frogs and of their nerves are far less serious than might have been expected ; the nerves are removed with Dr. A. D. Waller and Miss S. C. M. Sowton .
[ June 12 , ordinary care , a portion of spinal column being removed with them to serve as handles , and kept until required in physiological saline , which is best made with tap water and must not have the slightest acid reaction .
The usual value of the normal response of a satisfactory nerve is between O'OOl and 0'002 volt , and the time during which a nerve may be employed for experiment is usually at the least 24\#151 ; 48 hours after excision .
Quite fresh nerves may be used , but it is preferable to use nerves that have remained in physiological saline for an hour or two after the removal from a freshly pithed frog , and it is unadvisable to make use of nerves that have been left for any considerable length of time in the tissues of a pithed frog .
Fig. 3 ( Plate 3492 ) gives the result of a typical experiment upon a frog 's nerve submitted to the influence of a strong solution of betaine hydrochloride ( 10 per cent , neutralised by half its volume of normal soda solution ) .
Fig. 3 ( Betaine hydrochloride ) .
A summary of our observations is given below ; we have included in that summary for the sake of comparison seven observations on a sample of Calmette 's snake venom ( received from Professor Wright , of Netley ) , on a sample of tetanus toxine ( from Mr. Plimmer , of the Lister Institute ) , and on some decomposed serum-albumin .

] Action of Choline , Neurine , Muscarine , and Betame .
341 Fig. 13 is given to illustrate the refreshing effect of a new transverse section upon a small negative variation .
It is not special to this particular experiment , but illustrative of a general rule of procedure that should be adopted in prolonged experiments .
Exp. II .
The two nerves of the same frog are similarly but simultaneously passed through the solutions .
From Exps. I to Y we think ourselves justified in estimating betaine as belonging to the second of the three classes specified above , i.e. , as " moderately active .
" The electromobility of nerve , as evidenced by the negative variation of its current of injury has been abolished by betaine and restored by subsequent prolonged immersion in physiological saline .
The three following experiments show that muscarine has a similar effect , but rather more pronounced ; the negative variation was permanently abolished in Exp. VI ( also in Exp. IX ) .
Exp. VIII , in which two nerves were similarly treated , is the most complete ; it exhibits in both cases abolition by muscarine and recovery by saline , three times repeated .
Fig. 13 ( Exp. I ) .
Exp. IX .
In order to make comparison as closely as possible between the individual members of the ptomaine group , we took four nerves , as nearly as possible similar , and passed them simultaneously through each of the four test solutions and through physiological saline .
The negative variation of nerve 1 , immersed for 7 hours in muscarine , was completely and permanently abolished .
That of nerve 2 for 7 hours in betaine was temporarily abolished .
That of nerve 3 , after 7 hours in choline , was unaffected , and after 27 hours diminished .
342 Dr. A. D. Waller and Miss S. C. M. Sowton .
[ June 12 , That of nerve 4 , in neurine for 7 hours , was temporarily abolished and permanently diminished .
Exp. X. The sample of cerebro-spinal fluid used in this experiment was one sent to us 3 weeks previously by Dr. Mott ( and that had been tested when fresh with a negative result ) .
On the assumption that the fluid had contained choline ( which is comparatively inert ) , we argued that it should be found to have increased in activity in consequence of oxidation .
This was found to be the case ; the negative variation of the nerve was temporarily abolished by an immersion lasting 1| hours .
A similar effect is produced by the action of decomposed serum-albumin , vide infra Exps. XVII and XVIII .
Exps. XI to XVI were made with various toxines sent to us by Professor Wright and by Dr. Plimmer .
Snake vemon ( Exps. XI and XII ) , caused ; temporary abolition , and we could not , by our method of testing , find any difference of effect when the toxine was mixed with its appropriate quantity of antitoxine solution ( Exps. XIII and XIV ) .
Diphtheritic toxine ( Exp. XV ) and tetanus toxine also produced temporary abolition .
These few experiments , as far as they go , indicate that the toxines in question are , as regards isolated nerve tested in this manner , substances of the second degree of toxicity .
But we evidently need further experiments .
The last two experiments ( XVII and XVIII ) were made to see whether the decomposition products of serum-albumin have a toxic action .
It is evident that they have , arid that their toxicity is one of the second degree , as defined above .
Experiments on the Frog 's Heart .
In view of the well-known cardiac effects of muscarine , we undertook an experimental survey of the influence of the group of related bodies upon the action of the heart , taking as the most convenient case for our purpose the isolated frog 's heart and the suspension method , the drug , in appropriate dilution being simply applied to the surface of the heart .
The general results of these observations were to the following effect:\#151 ; 1 .
Neurine , muscarine , choline , betaine ( as hydrochlorides ) bring about diastolic arrest of the heart .
2 .
The arrest thus produced is antagonised by atropine ( as sulphate ) .
3 .
Neurine and muscarine are more active than betaine or choline .
The following records are illustrative examples selected from a series of upwards of 50 experiments , all giving concordant results :\#151 ; 1903 .

] The Physiological Action of Betaine .
The first two substances are considerably more toxic thanTthe second two ; and for each of the two pairs the first named has shown itself to be somewhat the more toxic .
As regards the excised heart , the effect of all four substances is arrest in diastole ; the effect is in each case counteracted by atropine .

* From the observations described in the preceding communication , it was evident that betaine cannot be distinguished as an inert member of the ptomaine series , at least as regards its action on isolated nerve and on the isolated heart .
This led to an inquiry into the original source of the universal text-book statement that betaine , unlike choline , neurine and muscarine , is non-toxic .
The only experimental evidence to the point consists ( as far as I have yet discovered* ) in a statement by Schultzen , quoted by Scheibler in the 'Berichte der Deutschen Chemisehen Gesellschaft ' for 1870 , vol. 3 , p. 155 , to the following effect:\#151 ; " Mehrere Versuche welche ich mit dem Betain ausstellte , haben ubereinstimmend ergeben dass dasselbe in keiner Weise gif tig wirkt , ja keinerlei wahrnehmbare Wirkungen auf das Befinden eines Thieres * K. Andrlik , A. Velich , and YL StanSk , in a quite recent paper ( " Das Betain in Physiologish-chemischer Bezieliung .
Yorlaiifige Mittheilung .
" 4 Cbt .
fur Physiologic ' November 22 , 1902 , p. 452 ) , confirm Scheibler 's statement , saying : " Es ergab sich [ an Frosehen , weissen Ratten und Hundeu ] dass die direkte injection dieses Stoffes [ Betain'J in das Blut selbst in grosseren Mengenlkeine erkennbaren Aenderungen der physiologischen Functionen herbeifuhrt .

" They injected 5 grammes jper venom into a dog and recovered nearly the whole of this amount from the urine in an unaltered state .
JPer os only about one-third of the betaine administered was recovered from the urine .
From a cow having taken 144 grammes per os none was recovered .
