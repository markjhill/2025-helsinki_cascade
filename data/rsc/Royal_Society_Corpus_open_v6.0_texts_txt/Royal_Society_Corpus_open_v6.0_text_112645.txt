I. " Actinometrical Observations among the Alps , with the Descrip. .
tion of a new Actinometer .
' ' By the Rev. GEORGE C. HODGKINSON .
In a Letter to Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. Communicated by Professor STOKES .
Received December 2 , 1866 .
SIR , --I have the honour to forward you an account of some actinometrical observations made last summer on the summit of Mont Blanc and at Chamonix , and at the same time to thank the Committee of the Royal Society for the grant which they were so good as to vote me for that object .
I reached Chamonix on the 7th of July , in bad weather , which had been prevailing for some time , but which ushered in a fine week very opportunely for my work .
After allowing a few days for the weather to settle and for the snow to consolidate , I left Chamonix in the afternoon of Friday the 13th for the Grands Mulets , having previously arranged for a corresponding series of observations being taken the next morning in the valley .
Leaving the Grands Mulets at about 2 ?
A.M. on the 14th , I reached the summit of Mont Blanc about 8 A.M. , and proceeded at once to work .
I had brought with me from England two of Newman 's mountain-barometers , a thermobarometer of Casella , six small thermometers graduated on the stem ( three for the dry- , and three for the wet-bulb observations ) , three of the tubes described in Appendix ( A ) , with two of the actinometers in each .
I carried besides an aneroid by Cooke , which proved to be of excellent quality .
The third set of apparatus was taken in some faint hope that I might be able to arrange for a third set of simultaneous readings at the Grands Mulets .
In this I was disappointed. .
Notwithstanding the greatest care had been taken , one of the barometers was found on the Brevent on the 9th to be deranged , and one of the actinometers to be broken ; and on the 12th a second actinometer was broken at Chamonix by an accident .
I thought it best to leave the remaining barometer for the valley observations , and to depend upon the thermobarometer , as being more portable and less liable to fracture , for the readings on the summit .
I was eventually obliged to rest satisfied with a single observation of this ; and the downward range of the small thermometer unfortunately proved too 2 n limited for the wet-bulb readings .
Thus the meteorological observations at the upper station are of the scantiest .
Neither above nor below were the actinometrical readings so continuous as I had wished to make them .
I had no one with me on the summit capable of rendering me the smallest assistance ; but it is some consolation to think that , even had this been otherwise , the results could not , under the circumstances , have been materially enhanced .
There either did not exist , or I failed to detect , as the sun 's altitude increased , anything like a unifornm progression of actinic power at either station during the limited time in which the observations were continued .
The results do little more than determine the ratio of the average intensity at the two stations for a portion of the forenoon .
This indeed was the main object which I had in view .
For looking at the experience of Principal Forbes under easier conditions , when the continuance of the observations , as long as the clearness of the sky might last , presented no difficulty , I did not at all anticipate being able to trace a dependence of the actinic power on the hygrometric state of the atmosphere .
lie thus remarks ( Bakerian Lecture , Phil. Trans. part 2 for 1842 , p. 253 ) of the experiments on the Faulhorn and at Brienz , that " it cannot be affirmed they are sufficient to show the kind of dependence which the opacity has on the dampness , and that the values of the coefficient of extinction do not present any correspondence with the hygrometric variations ; " and again , p. 268 , " It must be confessed that no evident relation to the hygrometric condition of the air appears in the individual observations .
" From the experiments of the 14th of July the actinic ratio between the summit of Mont Blanc and Chamonix , from 91 311 " to 101 " 11m apparent time , presents , with a single exception , a gradual decrease from 1 244 to 1*206 .
The interest of a comparison of these results with those which Principal Forbes obtained between the Faulhorn and Brienz is unfortunately diminished by the fact that his actinometer was not furnished with an internal thermometer for ascertaining the temperature of the liquid employed .
This was ammonio-sulphate of copper , which has a coefficient of dilatation varying from 1 at 60 ?
F. , to 2-562 at 32 ?
F. , and 0-626 at 100 ?
F. His recorded numbers for three hours before and three hours after apparent noon derived from his freehand curve , are as follows : Hour .

1-217 At 10 " on the Faulhorn the ratio seems to have been rapidly increasing ; on Mont Blanc it was slowly diminishing .
The actual amount of the ratio at 1 Oh is almost exactly coincident in the two cases ; but at 1 1h on the Faulhorn it was 1'345 , a value much higher than any which was obtained at any time on Mont Blanc , or seemed likely to have been obtained at that hour had the observations been continued so long .
What share the greater depression of the lower station in the experiments of 1832 , the more complete isolation of the upper station in those of 1866 , or variable atmospheric conditions in both sets may severally have had in contributing to this effect , remains a matter for future investigation .
The respective heights of the stations are as follows : English ft. English ft. Faulorn ... ... .

1903 The sky during the observations was not only cloudless , but , as seen from the summit , remarkably clear .
The observations have all been reduced by means of Tables derived from Gmelin 's ' Chemistry , ' vol. i. p. 231 , to what they would have been had the mean temperature of the liquid during each minute been 32 ?
F. By a prolonged and careful comparison of actinometers ( K ) and ( A ) , the factor for reducing the indications of ( K ) to the standard of ( A ) was found to be 1-29 .
Considerable practice is necessary to acquire expertness in the use of the actinometer employed .
It is desirable , as nearly as may be , to work it at such a temperature that the rise in the sun may be equal to the fall in the shade .
If the mean of the two mean temperatures of the liquid , in taking the shade observations which precede and follow a given sun , differ much from the mean temperature of the liquid during that sun , a sensible error will be introduced .
This , however , is to a great extent eliminated by taking the mean of three , and still more completely by taking the mean of five successive actinic results in column ( I ) .
The difficulty of using the instrument was overcome by the kind cooperation of several friends for the Chamonix observations .
To the good offices of my cousin , Mr. G. F. Hodgkinson , were added those of a lady , a worthy sister of one of the foremost mathematicians of his year , and her two nieces .
Under her auspices an admirable arrangement of the work was made , by which each of the party was responsible for a precise and definite function , the adjustment and direction of the instrument , with the shading and unshading , the watch , the readings , and the records .
To this friendly and efficient help I am greatly indebted for whatever success has been achieved .
How small this is , no one can be more sensible than myself ; yet I venture to hope that when the difficulty of the undertaking is considered , to those at least who are acquainted with the experience of Principal Forbes in 1832 , 1841 , and 1842 , as given in his Bakerian Lecture , the results will not appear either disappointing or discouraging .
The season was extremely unfavourable for the further prosecution of the work .
Looking to the imperfection of the instrument employed by Principal Forbes in his observations in 1832 , it would seem to be highly desirable that his experiments on the column of air between the Faulhorn and Brienz should be repeated , and that other pairs of stations , intermediate in character to that and the Chamonix pair , should be essayed .

Description of the Actinometer .
The actinoreter employed consists of a thermometer with a spherical bulb one inch in diameter , and a tube , of which an inch and a half next the bulb is , for a reason which will presently be apparent , left unscaled .
The succeeding ten inches is made to represent , as nearly as may be , the range 328 Apparent time .

_ __ IIIII from 40 ?
F. to 45 ?
F. At eleven inches and a half from the bulb the tube is widened , so that the following inch and a half may represent the range from 45 ?
F. to 115 ?
F. The tube then finishes in a spheroidal chamber , of which the diameters are about an inch and half an inch .
The widened portion of the tube may be dispensed with , as the correction which it serves to ascertain may be otherwise found by means of a Table experimentally constructed for each instrument .
In that case the spheroidal chamber , in which the tube will then terminate at eleven and a half inches from the bulb , should be made somewhat larger .
The fluid employed is alcohol coloured with a drop of pure aniline-blue .
A considerable quantity of air is left in the chamber .
As a running column has to be read at a particular instant , great plainness is the first requisite for the scale .
On this account graduation on the tube has not been adopted ; but at an inch and a half from the bulb is attached an ivory scale , nine-tenths of an inch broad and eleven and a half inches long ( or somewhat less if the widened tube be dispensed with ) , its other extremity coinciding with the commencement of the spheroidal chamber .
This scale is graduated throughout in millimetres .
The number of millimetres corresponding to each degree Fahr. on the tube of narrow bore , and to every fifth degree from 45 ?
to 115 ?
on the widened tube , should be noted on the back of the scale .
The principle of the instrument is the same as that of Sir J. Herschel 's ; and it is to be worked according to the directions given by him in The Manual of Scientific Enquiry .
' It was devised for mountain use , where the weight of the Herschel and the fragility of its internal thermometer are elements of difficulty .
It has also the advantage of being less costly .
The air-chamber is made to serve the purpose of the screw in the HIerschel , viz. that of altering at will , according to circumstances , the range of the thermometer .
This is effected by throwing off into the chamber a greater or less quantity of fluid , retaining it there by holding the instrument with the chamber end somewhat lower than the bulb , and working with the remaining column .
As alcohol expands unequally between its freezingand boilingpoints , a small correction is necessary , depending on the temperature of the alcohol at the time of working , This temperature is ascertained by noting the point in the widened tube , at which the column stands , when the fluid is thrown off into the chamber .
The excess of this temperature above 45 ?
F. , the point from which the fluid is thrown off , has to be added to the temperature between 40 ?
and 45 ?
shownby the head of the working column , in order to have the true temperature .
From the openness of the scale , and consequent small range of the instrumentfor any one adjustment , it is necessary to select for working a temperature not much removed from that at which the rise in the sun is equal to the fall in the shade .
This temperature , which may be called the temperature of equilibrium , will vary practically , according to the solar intensity , from some 5 ?
F. to 20 ?
F. above the temperature of the surrounding influences .
By driving the fluid into the chamber until the temperature of equilibrium is represented at a point near the middle of the tube , the readings will go on for a considerable time without altering the quantity of fluid in the chamber , and ten inches of graduation are found to be ample under all circumstances .
By thus taking all the readings , so to speak , on the balance , a uniformity of proceeding is secured , which is not without its value .
The instrument , constructed according to the dimensions here given , will denote the intensity of the noonday sun at the summer solstice near the sea-level in England by about 100 divisions of the scale .
Owing to the difficulty of shading satisfactorily , and anomalies found to occur in observing among the snow-fields on the high crests of the Alps , the following contrivance has been adopted : A plain telescope-tube of bright metal , 18 inches long and 27 inches in diameter , open at both ends , ,is pierced in its central section with a circular hole 1to 1inch in diameter , from which springs a flanged shoulder projecting about inch to receive a perforated split bung , which clasps the thermometer-stem and holds the bulb firmly in the centre of the axis of the tube .
Two caps , fitted at the ends with clean plate-glass , are made to slide off and on at the two ends to admit of the glasses being readily wiped .
By protecting these with a little wadding , the tube serves as a case for two actinometers .
In the central section of the tube , made by a plane perpendicular to its axis , and nearly 90 ?
from the centre of the circular hole , is a screw to attach the tube to an altitude and azimuth motion , by means of which it may be kept constantly directed towards the sun .
