OF FREQUENCY OF THE BAROMETRIC HEIGHT AT DIVERS STA'l'IONS .
467 at different intervals of time .
Nor should it be forgotten that theoretically we have much power of varying the magnitude of our correlation coefficients .
They decrease from about 1 at the distance zero to zero as the distance increases .
We have thus a zone round every station of zero-correlated stations ; beyond this it is highly probable that the correlation becomes negative as we reach places which have cyclones corresponding to anticyclones at the given station .
This zone is of course not reached in such a small area as the British Isles .
Passing through an area of negative correlation , we should in all probability ultimately reach an extended area of zero correlation .
In the next place the time interval is under our control , and the coefficient of correlation can be reduced by increasing this .
Lastly , it varies also , although probably to a much less extent , by varying the direction in which the ( listance between two stations is taken .
We can imagine no more useful piece of work than the determination of the correlation for a period of 10 or 20 years of a series of stations taken so far as possible round , say , a parallel of latitude .

On a Frequency-registering Barometer by G. U. YuLE .
In all ordinary forms of registering barometer the resulting diagram shows the height of the barometer at each instant of time .
To construct a frequency curve from such a diagram , the heights must be read off for all the times desired , corrected if necessary , grouped , and replotted in the manner described in the preceding paper .
This procedure is somewhat tedious , and it may be obviated by so constructing the barometer that it shall give the frequency record automatically .

Hence we should have absolute pred10t10n if p = ( ~i ( 1 + n - 1 r ) r Similar propositions follow for partial correlation and for rise corresponding to \#163 ; all .
It seems doubtful , however , whether such a system of correlation could possibly be arranged for more than four stations .
