" On the penetration of Spermatozoa into the interior of the Ovum ; a Note showing this to have been recorded as an established fact in the Philosophical Transactions for 1843 .
" By Martin Barry , M.D. , F.R.S. , F.R.S.E. Received February 24 , 1853 .
Referring to a statement by Dr. Nelson , in a paper " On the reproduction of the Ascaris MVystax , " that the investigations in that paper " appear to be the first in which the fact of the penetration of spermatozoa into the ovum has been distinctly seen and clearly established in one of the most highly organized of the Entozoa , " the author of the present communication remarks , that when Dr. Nelson made this statement he was evidently not aware of what had been published on the subject .
In proof of this Dr. Barry refers to his own paper , entitled " ' Spermatozoa observed within the Mammiferous Ovum " ( Phil. Trans. 1843 , p. 33 ) , in which he states that he had met with ova of the Rabbit containing a number of spermatozoa in their interior ; and to the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal for October 1843 , which contains a drawing in which seven spermatozoa are represented in the interior of an ovum , besides the statement that in one instance he had counted more than twenty spermatozoa in a single ovum .
In conclusion he remarks , that Dr. Nelson merely added a further confirmation in ova of an entozoon , to what his own researches on mammiferous ovalhad enabled him to record as an established fact nine years before .
