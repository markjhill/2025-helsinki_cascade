) Introduction .
In order to gain a general idea of this important species of trypanosome , it will be necessary to study as many individual strains as possible .
It may be thought unnecessary to describe each strain so much in detail , but without this it will be impossible to get any order out of the chaos which rules at present in the classification of the African species of trypanosomes pathogenic to man and the domestic animals .
Up to the present the Commission have only had an opportunity of working with five human strains .
Four of these are from natives infected in the Sleeping-Sickness Area , Uyasaland , the fifth from an European who contracted the disease in Portuguese East Africa .
It is intended , in later papers , to describe five strains from wild game and the same number from the tsetse fly , Glossina morsitans .
The human strains are named : I , Mkanyanga ; II , E-------- ; III , Chituluka ; IY , Chipochola ; and Y , Chibibi .

Chart 1.\#151 ; Curve representing the Distribution , by Percentages , in respect to Length , of 1500 Individuals of the Trypanosome of Strain II , E----------------------- .
Microns This curve is made up of measurements from 60 specimens of trypanosomes taken from the goat , 20 from the sheep , 160 from the monkey , 260 from the dog , and 1000 from the rat .
In a previous paper it was suggested that 1000 trypanosomes taken at random would be a suitable number to plot a curve from , for purposes of comparison .
This is done in Chart 2 .
The taking away of 500 rat trypanosomes has changed , to a great extent , the character of the curve .
There is no resemblance between this curve and that given on Chart 1 of Strain I , Mkanyanga .
If the two strains , I and II , belong to the same species , then little help can be expected from this system of measurement in classifying trypanosomes .
It has been suggested by Dr. J. W. W. Stephens that the measurements should be made from one animal , and he proposed the tame rat as a suitable species .
There seems much to be said in favour of this .
Practically , his proposal is that a series of slides should be made with blood taken on 10 consecutive days from a single rat , and that 100 trypanosomes should be drawn each day .
But it is no light task to draw 1000 trypanosomes at a magnification of 2000 , and afterwards to measure them .
We have therefore made a compromise and measure 60 trypanosomes on nine consecutive days , beginning from the day the parasites first appear in the blood .
In order to deal with a round number ( 500 ) only 20 are measured on the ninth day .

] This makes a symmetrical curve , which ascends and descends by fairly regular steps , but with little likeness to Charts 1 and 2 .
In an organism low in the scale of nature , such as this , subject to great variation in form , it might be thought that it would not be likely to behave in any two rats in the same way .
The following chart shows that this is not so , but that , on the contrary , the same strain of trypanosome planted in two different animals of the same species grows in a remarkably similar way .

Microns -p lo It is remarkable how much alike these last two curves are .
If curves made in this way from different strains of one species of trypanosome showed the same degree of similarity , this method would certainly be useful for purposes of classification .
But , as we have seen , the curve of Strain II has no resemblance to that of Strain I , and it will be found that each human strain of this species of trypanosome differs , more or less , when subjected to this method of measurement .
As the occurrence of posterior-nuclear forms has been made the distinguishing character between Trypanosoma gambiense , and rhodesiense , it will be of interest to note the percentage of these forms in the various strains .
The method used is to count the number of posterior Sir D. Bruce and others .

Strains II , IV and V are similar , varying only from 22'2 to 22*5 .
This difference in average length may be due to slight variations having taken place in the different strains , resulting from the passage through more or less resistant man .
There is no evidence that this variation is due to treatment by atoxyl or other drugs .
It has been shown that the same strain grown in two animals of the same species gives like results .

It must also be confessed that , on comparing the five curves one with another , they do not give as much assistance in classifying this species of trypanosome as was hoped .
Curves I and III are alike , and coincide with that prepared by Dr. Stephens from the case of Armstrong in Liverpool , whereas Curves II , IY and Y approach more to the type described by Kinghorn and Yorke from the Luangwa Yalley .

This presence of posterior-nuclear forms would have been accepted a few months ago as sufficient proof that the species dealt with was T. rhodesiense .
Since then posterior-nuclear forms have been reported as occurring in T. brucei from Egypt , Uganda and Zululand .
In a strain lately obtained by Theiler from the same spot in Zululand where this species was originally discovered in 1894 , this percentage rose to the highest yet recorded .

[ Jan. 16 , Conclusions .
1 .
The five human strains of this trypanosome , isolated from four natives in ISTyasaland and one European in Portuguese East Africa , belong to the same species .
2 .
This species is T. rhodesiense ( Stephens and Eantham ) .
3 .
Evidence is accumulating that T.rhodesiense and T. brucei ( Plimmer and Bradford ) are identical .

) In previous papers by one of us ( 1 , 2 ) observations on the gaseous metabolism and on the nitrogen metabolism of tumour-bearing rats have been recorded .
The present paper contains observations on the carbohydrate metabolism of tumour-bearing rats .
The tumour-strain employed in our previous work was also used for these experiments ; it is a spindle-celled ' sarcoma ( J.R.S. of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund ) which has a rapid growth .
This tumour does not contain any glycogen .
A large number of glycogen estimations were carried out with the liver of normal and of tumour-bearing animals .
The glycogen estimations were made by Pfluger 's method ; the glucose obtained by the hydrolysis of glycogen was estimated in the first part of the work gravimetrically according to the technique used by Pfliiger ; later on , Bertrand 's method of titration was employed .
It is necessary to bear in mind that only 4 to 6 grm. of liver tissue are available for analysis in these estimations , so that with a glycogen percentage below 0T to 02 per cent , the absolute amount of glycogen present in the whole liver of a rat is so small that it cannot be determined * * This research is in continuation of papers in ' Roy .
