" A Comparison of the Variations of the Diurnal Range of Magnetic Declination as recorded at the Observatories of 1 Kew and Trevandrum .
" By Balfour Stewart , F.R.S. , 1 Professor of Natural Philosophy in Owens College , Manchester , and Morisabro Hiraoka .
Received January 10 , 1879 .
* In a previous paper by one of the authors ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. xxvi , p. 102 ) a table is given ( Table II ) exhibiting monthly means of the Kew diurnal declination-range , corresponding to forty-eight points in each year , or four for each month , that is to say , approximately one every week ; and , in another paper ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol , xxvii , p. 81 ) , another similar table exhibits monthly means of the Trevandrum diurnal declination-range for weekly points .
In the present paper these two tables are compared together .
It became obvious to the writers , when engaged in making this comparison , that the turning points in the curve , which represented the variations of the Kew declination-range , were on the whole in point of time before the corresponding points in the Trevandrum curve .
While this result might have been rendered evident by making the numbers of the tables above-mentioned at once into curves , yet it was found to become more apparent to the eye and freer from inequalities by adopting a certain amount of equalization .
Accordingly , the Kew and Trevandrum tables were transformed into others , with the same time-interval between their numbers as in Variations of Magnetic Declination .
[ Jan. 3 other , rather than with minimum points or depressions .
Indeed , tl researches of Broun and others , from a different point of vein strengthen this conclusion , which is , however , abundantly support by a glance at the curves themselves ; ( 2 .
) The oscillations of the Trevandrum curve are greater tha those of the Kew cur re ; ( 8 .
) In many cases where there is a want of striking likeness between the oscillations of the two curves , there are yet noticeabl traces in the one curve corresponding to the oscillations of the othei There are , however , a few cases where there is a want of apparen likeness .
( 4 .
) In general , though not invariably , the oscillations of th Trevandrum curve follow rather than precede the correspondm ; oscillations of the Kew curve .
This will be perceived from th following numerical estimate:\#151 ; Table I.\#151 ; Exhibiting the lagging behind of the Trevandrum Curve ii Point of Time .
