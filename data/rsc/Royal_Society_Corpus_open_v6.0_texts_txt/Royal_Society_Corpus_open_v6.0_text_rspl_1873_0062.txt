The following Papers were read I. " Note on the Absorption-Spectra of Potassium and Sodium at low Temperatures .
" By H. E. Roscoe , F.R.S. , and Arthur Schuster , Ph. D. Received April 30,1874 .
In order to obtain the absorption-spectrum afforded by the well-known green-coloured potassium vapour , pieces of the clean dry metal were sealed up in glass tubes filled with hydrogen , and one of these was then placed in front of the slit of a large Steinheil 's spectroscope furnished with two prisms having refracting angles of 45 ' and 60 ' .
The magnifying-power of the telescope was 40 , and was sufficient clearly to separate the D lines with one prism .
A continuous spectrum from a lime-light was used , and that portion of a tube containing the bright metallic globule of potassium was gently heated until the green vapour made its appearance .
A complicated absorption-spectrum was then seen , a set of bands ( a ) in the red coming out first ; whilst after a few moments two other groups appeared on either side of the D lines , the group / 3 ( less refrangible ) being not so dark as the group y. These bands are all shaded off towards the red , and in general appearance resemble those of the iodine-spectrum .
In order to assure ourselves that the bands are not caused by the presence of a trace of an oxide , tubes were prepared in 1874 .
] Absorption-Spectra of Potassium and Sodium .
363 which the metal was melted in hydrogen several times on successive days until no further change in the bright character of the globule could be perceived .
On vaporizing the metal , which had been melted down to a clean portion of the tube , the bands were seen as before , and came out even more clearly , the globule , after heating , exhibiting a bright metallic surface .
An analysis of the potassium used showed that it did not contain more than 0-8 per cent , of sodium , although , of course , the double line D was always plainly seen .
In order to ascertain whether an alteration in the absorption-spectrum of the metal takes place at a red heat , fragments of potassium were placed in a red-hot iron tube , through which a rapid current of pure hydrogen gas was passed , the ends of the tube being closed by glass plates .
The magnificent green colour of the vapour was clearly seen at this temperature , on looking through the tube at a lime-light placed at the other end .
Owing , doubtless , to the greater thickness or increased pressure of the vapour , the bands seen by the previous method could not be resolved by the small spectroscope employed , the whole of the red being absorbed , w hilst a broad absorption-band in the greenish yellow ' was seen occupying the place of the group y. The positions of the bands obtained by the first method were measured by means of a telescope and distant scale , and the wave-lengths obtained by an interpolation curve , for w'hich well known air-lines wo re taken as references .
The following numbers give the wave-lengths of the most distinct , that is , the most refrangible edge of each band .
As the measurements had to be made quickly , owing to the rapid darkening of the glass by the action of the metallic vapour , these numbers do not lay claim to very great accuracy , but fairly represent the relative positions of the band , and show that they do not always occur at regular intervals , although they are pretty regularly spread over the field and all are shaded alike .

As soon as the metal began to boil , a series of bands in the blue ( Na y ) made their appearance , and shortly afterwards bands in the red and yellow ( Na a ) , stretching as far as the D lines , came out .
At this period of the experiment the D lines widened , thus blotting .
out a series of fine bands occurring in the orange ( Na ft ) , some of which , consequenly , could not be mapped .
All the bands of the sodium-spectrum shade off , like the potassium-bands , towards the red .
When the vapour of sodium is examined in a red-hot iron tube , the colour of the lime-light , as seen through it , is a dark blue .
As the sodium is swept away by the current of hydrogen passing through , the colour becomes lighter , and the transmitted rays can be analyzed by the spectroscope .
At first , the whole red and green and part of the blue is cut out entirely .
The D lines are considerably widened , and an absorption-band is seen in the green , apparently coinciding with the double sodium-line , which comes next in strength to the D lines .
All the colours , therefore , seem to be shut out , except part of the orange , part of the green , and the ultra-blue .
As the sodium-vapour becomes less dense , more light passes through , and the same absorption-bands are seen as are observed in the other method .
The vapour then has a slight bluish-green tint , but is nearly colourless .
The following numbers give the wave-lengths of the more refrangible edge of the sodium absorption-bands in tenth-metres , obtained in the manner above described:\#151 ; 6668 " 6616 6552 6499 sa 6450 6405 63611 6272 | 6235 )-a 6105 6092 6071 6051 j 6035 \gt ; P 5999 5150"j 5129 | 5082 \gt ; y 5038 5002 4964^1 4927 j 4889 I 4863 'y 4832 4810 Plate IY .
