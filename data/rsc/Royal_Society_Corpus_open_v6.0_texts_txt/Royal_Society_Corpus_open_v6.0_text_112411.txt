( Abstract .
) In Section I. of this memoir some new reactions of narcotine are described .
A. When narcotine is submitted to the action of water , either boiling in open vessels or at temperatures above 100 ?
C. in sealed tubes , it splits up into meconin and cotarnine .
C , , H23 N07 =C , 0o H4+ C12 H13 NO , .
The splitting up of narcotine under the influence of heated water may explain the occurrence of meconin in opium-residues , as probably the small amount of meconin always found there is simply due to the partial decomposition of the narcotine during the processes of extraction of morphia .
B. Narcotine heated per se to a little above 200 ?
splits up as above into meconin and cotarnine , the latter being immediately decomposed at that temperature .
C. When hydrochlorate of narcotine is heated along with ferric chloride solution , the latter is reduced and the narcotine converted into opianic acid and cotarnine .

Section II .
treats of the decompositions of the narcotine-bases .
A. Dimethyl-nornarcotine , when heated to above 100 ?
C. with water il sealed tubes , undergoes decomposition : from the corresponding narcotine reaction it would seem that this decomposition might take place in either of two ways : Narcotine .
Meconin .
Cotarnine .

Cotarnimide .

Of these the former reaction is apparently the one which thus takes place .
This conclusion is borne out by the fact that , when treated with ferric or platinic chloride , the hydrochlorate of dimethyl-nornarcotine forms methylnoropianic acid and cotarnine , and not opianic acid and cotarnimide .

Section III .
contains some miscellaneous observations on opianic acid , meconin , and hemipinic acid .
A. Opianic acid treated with sulphuric acid and dilute solution of bichromate of potassium becomes oxidized to hemipinic acid .
CI I10 ?
o + O-+ CIO Hl O , .
When heated a few degrees above its melting-point , opianic acid loses water and yields a substance crystallizable from hot alcohol , differing in properties from opianic acid , and apparently containing C1o H1E3 09 , being formed thus : 4 C01 H0o 05=H2 0+ C40 H38 01 .
B. All attempts to oxidize meconin to opianic or hemipinic acid were failures .
Nitrous acid gas passed into melted meconin caused the formation of nitromeconin , identical with that got by the action of nitric acid , each sample , however , giving rather different qualitative reactions from those usually ascribed to this substance .
C. IHemipinic acid , when heated to 170 ?
, loses water and becomes an anhydride , Co1 H1 O , , which may be crystallized unaltered from absolute alcohol , but when treated with ordinary spirit of 90 per cent. alcohol forms ethyl-hemipinic acid , C10 HS ( C2 I4 ) 0o .
Resume of results obtained in thefour portions* of this research .
( 1 ) It has been shown from the analyses of various samples of narcotine derived from various sources , that narcotine has always the same composition , viz. C22 H23 NO , ( vol.xii .
p. 501 ) .
( 2 ) As stated by former observers , narcotine under the influence of oxidizing agents splits up into opianic acid and cotarnine .
22 23 NO7 + C0 =o H10o 0+ C12 H13 NO3 .
( 3 ) When heated to a little above 200 ?
per se , or for a considerable time in contact with water , narcotine splits up into meconin and cotarnine ( vol. xvii .
p. 340 ) .
C2 23 NO7 = C10o O0 4+ C12 1N O3 .
( 4 ) When narcotine is heated with excess of hydrochloric acid for a short time ( about two hours ) , chloride of methyl is formed , and one atom of H substituted for Ci3 in the narcotine ; if heated for a long time ( some days ) , two atoms of 11 are substituted for two of CH3 ; when heated with fuming hydriodic acid , iodide of methyl is formed in such quantities as to prove that three atoms of H are substituted for three of CH3 .
A series of homo-^ logous bases is thus formed , whose decompositions are analogous to those of narcotine .
( 5 ) Cotarnine has been shown to have the formula C32 H13 NO3 , and not C3 13 NO3 , and is capable of crystallizing with half a molecule , and with a whole molecule , of water of crystallization .
( 6 ) When cotarnine is heated with dilute nitric acid , under certaini not clearly understood circumstances , cotarnic acid and methylamine is produced , Ca1 NO3 3 ?
+2 20 OC 1112 O5 + CHI N ; with strong nitric acid , as stated by previous observers , apophyllic acid is produced ; other oxidizing agents give no definite results ( vol. xi .
p. 59 ) .
( 7 ) When cotarnine is heated with strong hydrochloric acid , chloride of methyl is formed , and hydrochlorate of cotarnamic acid .
C12 H13 NO3+ H2 +2 H1C1= CI3G Cl + C3 H113 NO4 , IIC1 .
Hydriodic acid produces a similar reaction , only one equivalent of ClI-3 being removed for one of cotarnine ( vol. xii .
p. 503 ) .
( 8 ) Opianic acid under the influence of nascent hydrogen ( as when treated with sodium-amalgam or zinc and sulphuric acid ) is reduced to meconin ( vol. xii .
p. 503 ) .
C1o lo 0+ H2 =1 H CO+C 1 3o 04 .
( 9 ) Opianic acid heated with bichromate of potassium and dilute sulphuric acid becomes oxidized to hemipinic acid ( vol. xvii .
p. 341 ) .
Clo 1i 05 + 0=Clo Hio 0.0 ( 10 ) Opianic acid heated with caustic potash splits up into meconin and hemipinic acid ( vol. xi .
p. 57 ) .
2 C1o 11C0 05= CIo H1o 04 + Clo Hoo 06(11 ) Opianic acid heated with excess of hydrochloric acid forms chloride of methyl , hydrogen being substituted for CHa in the opianic acid : it appears probable that two distinct substances are thus produced , noropianic acid and methyl-noropianic acid the former by substitution of 113 for ( OH3)2 , and the latter by substitution of 1-1 for CH , ; only the latter has been isolated in a pure state , the former decomposing spontaneously .
C0o Ho 10 5+2 HC1=2CH,3 C1+ C , H , O0 , C1 H0 0+ -IC = C0I3 C1 + C9 -t 10 .
iHydriodic acid apparently produces similar decompositions .
Like opianic acid , methyl-noropianic acid is monobasic ( vol. xvi .
p. 39 ) .
( 12 ) All experiments to oxidize meconin to opianic acid or hemipinic acid or any other product have proved failures .
( 13 ) Meconin treated with excess of hydrochloric or hydriodic acid forms chloride or iodide of methyl , and a body derived from meconin by substitution of H for CH03 , methyl-normeconin .
C1o H1l 0+ 1CC1 CH3 C1+ C3 80 , .
Attempts to procure ( hypothetical ) normeconin by substituting II2 for ( CHI- , ) did not yield anything capable of isolation in a pure state ( vol. xvi .
p. 39 ) .
( 14 ) I-Iemipinic acid treated with various reducing agents has in no case been reduced to opianic acid or meconin ; nor have experiments to form opianic acid by the union of hemipinic acid and meconin been successful ; nor has hemipinic acid been oxidized to any other compound .
( 15 ) When hemipinic acid is heated with excess of hydrochloric acid , chloride of methyl and carbonic acid are formed , together with a new acid , methyl-hypogallic acid , in accordance with the following equation : C , O H , lo O+ HCl= C1H3 Cd Ch O , C , H , 0 When heated with hydriodic acid , hypogallic acid is found , together with iodide of methyl and carbonic acid : thus , 0o H00-+2HI-=2CH3 +CO +07 11 0 ( vol. xvi .

Methyl-hypogallic acid , however , is monobasic ( vol. xvi .

( 17 ) Hemipinic acid is capable of crystallizing with different amounts of water of crystallization , crystals with half a molecule , with a whole molecule , and with two molecules of water having been obtained ( vol. xvi .
p. 40 ) .
