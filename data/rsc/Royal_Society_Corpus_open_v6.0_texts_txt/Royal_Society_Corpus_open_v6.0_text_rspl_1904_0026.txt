( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London .
) Up to the present time there would appear to have been no published researches on isolated mammalian non-medullated nerve , and indeed except for the paper of Broclie and Halliburton , * all our knowledge of these nerves has been either by inference from similar nerves in coldblooded animals or derived incidentally from experiments undertaken for a different object .
When it appeared , therefore , that the technique for mammalian medullated nerve served equally well for the non-medullated , f it became a matter of interest to examine the phenomena displayed by the latter , and the very evident advantages of dealing with nerves of considerable size and comparative longevity , and the possession of a ready standard of comparison in the medullated nerves of the same animal , greatly assisted in obtaining an exact result .
Methods .
The splenic nerves were found to be very suitable objects for this purpose .
They consist almost entirely of non-medullated fibres , { and in the horse , which is the animal which has been used for these experiments , the various bundles form a plexus around the splenic artery , which can be separated by careful dissection into its component parts , giving isolated pieces of nerve 1\#151 ; 1 .

in length .
These pieces will commonly retain their irritability for several hours if kept in 1 .
05 per cent , salt solution at 18 ' C. , into which they are placed from a quarter to half an hour after the death of the animal .
Waller'sS galvanographic method was employed as well as the capillary electrometer .
|| In the experiments on the negative variation , the exciting current was derived from an accumulator of large capacity , in order to secure the greatest possible constancy , and the excitation was maximal , except in Experiment 716 .

The current f injury was balanced against an equal fraction of a volt and the me read off This compensation was maintained throughout the l xperiment .
No current , therefore , flowed through the nerve when at 6 The experiments were ordinarily carried out in duplicate , with both , ledullated and non-medullated nerves from the same animal .

Negative Variation .
( Experiments .
) The electromotive phenomena in the nerves of the horse resemble those in the nerves of other mammalia in kind , but differ in degree , being of considerably less magnitude* This is due , in part , to the large amount of connective tissue surrounding the nerves , and forming a derivation circuit .
When this connective tissue is dissected off , the effect on the galvanometer is increased .

Both injury current and negative variation are increased , the latter more than the former .
But it will be noticed that even in the most favourable case the voltage of the negative variation is less in the medullated nerves of the horse * This has already been observed in the case of the current of injury , see Gotch , ' Schafer 's Text-book , ' vol. 2 , p. 520 , and Biedermann , ' Elektrophysiologie , ' 1895 , p. 638 .

It is not certain how far this is due to the greater amount of connective tissue present between the individual nerve-fibres , or to some other cause .
Both current of injury and negative variation are considerably greater in the non-medullated nerves of the horse than in the medullated .

They are probably too low , and for several reasons it is likely that the maximum values are more nearly correct than the mean .
They are , however , strictly comparative , and it is seen the voltages in the splenic nerves are approximately three times the median , a result agreeing with the observations on cold-blooded animals . !

I have been unable so far to trace any quantitative relation between the current of injury and the negative variation as determined above .
Obtaining a non-medullated nerve , subjecting it to a series of repeated tetanisations , and recording the successive negative variations by the galvanographic method , it appears at once that the results are very different from the corresponding phenomena in medullated nerve .
Figs. 1 and 2 are records from two nerves , the one splenic and the other median , from the same animal under identical conditions .
The successive negative variations from the latter are approximately equal , those from the former fall off very rapidly , and this rapid decrease in the negative variation is characteristic of mammalian non-medullated nerve .

Electromotive [ Dec. 15 , These tables show very clearly the alteration in the negative variation by successive excitations .
The decrease is most rapid at first and after a little proceeds quite slowly , especially if the excitation is sub-maximal , so that if the result of the first few minutes is discarded , there remains a considerable period during which the diminution is small , and which can be used to test any desired procedure ( vide figs. 1 and 6 ) .
The effect of rest is that the subsequent responses are greater for a time , but soon fall off ( fig. 1 ) , and the difference in this respect from the medullated nerves is very marked ( fig. 2 ) ; in the latter the subsequent negative variations are almost invariably less after a pause .
This difference is very clearly seen in the electrometer photographs ( Experiment 750 , B , fig. 3 , splenic of horse , and Experiment 751 , 'fig .

The full analysis of these will be considered in a subsequent paper , but these figures show ( ) that the electrical resistance plays an unimportant part in the production of the phenomena observed , and that the rate of transmission of the electrical effect is very much less in the non-medullated nerves .
As , therefore , the progressive diminution in the negative variation is characteristic of non-medullated nerve , both here and in cold-blooded animals , * further experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether this was due to events occurring along the whole length of the nerve , , or to changes localised at the place of excitation .
Two pairs of platinum wire electrodes were used for stimulation , placed respectively further and nearer the leading-off electrodes ; the nerve was excited first at the " far " pair and then at the " near .
" In Experiment 718 ( fig. 6 ) the result of exciting through the near pair of electrodes was to increase the negative variation to very nearly the original amount ( a ) .
After 12 minutes of excitation at this point the current was again sent through the " far " electrodes , and the resultive negative variation ( c ) was much less than the original value .
If the nerve had been simply resting , instead of being excited at a proximal place , the negative variation would have been increased ( see fig. 1 ) .

] Phenomena in Mammalian Nerve .
175 Experiments 721 and 720 were with non-medullated and medullated nerves under the same conditions .
Considering the result of all these experiments , it is clear that the diminution of the negative variation in non-medullated nerves is due to changes occurring at the point where the nerve is excited .
Usiim a constant stimulus this spot becomes less and less excitable , m the sense that the response becomes progressively smaller .
1 e control experiments on medullated nerve show but slight traces of iliis effect * either the medullary sheath prevents this loss of excita-TIne way , or the two classes of nerves differ very widely in their reaction to stimuli .
Speaking broadly , the evidence is in favour of the former hypothesis .
While the work of Sowtonf and Garten ] ; on cold-blooded nerves is in accord with my results on mammalian nerve , the paper of Brodie and Halliburton at first sight offers a contradiction .
These experimenters excited the splenic nerves in the dog for many hours , and blocking the impulse by cold , observed that when the block was removed the splenic contractions followed as at first , apparently unaltered in amount .
I have no doubt as to the correctness of theii observations , and the results they obtained , differing from those Figl 7.\#151 ; Splenic of Horse .

# Dr. Waller has very kindly permitted me to measure a considerable number of his photographic records of frog 's nerve , of 1896\#151 ; 1897 ; in all a small regular diminution is detectable , amounting to from 2*0 to 5*6 per cent. , in experiments lasting 40 minutes , f Sowton , loc. cit. t G-arten .

Electromotive [ Dec. lg recorded above , may possibly be explained by supposing that the splenic co ntractions are not as delicate an index of the condition o* the splenic nerves as the galvanometric response .
Waller* has showj 1 that with a gradually increasing stimulus the voltage of the negative-variation reaches its maximum much later than the contraction of the attached muscle , and as in all the experiments here recorded a certain amount of the negative variation still persisted , it is possible that even this fraction\#151 ; perhaps one-third of the initial value\#151 ; indicated a sufficient intensity of nerve impulse to give a maximal splenic contraction .
If the medullary sheath has any such action as the hypothesis .suggested above necessitates , the inquiry may be extended to see if any light can be thrown on the manner in which this sheath acts .
The following experiments on electrotonic currents were , therefore^ undertaken .

Electrotonic Currents .
Methods .
The nerve rested upon two pairs of non-polarisable electrodes .
The distal pair led oil ' to the galvanometer j the proximal were connected with the automatic reverser , used by Dr. Waller in 1897 , which delivered in order\#151 ; ( 1 ) A current in the proximal direction ( giving anelectrotonic currents in the nerve ) .
( 2 ) Excitation by means of an induction coil .
( 3 ) A current in the distal direction ( katelectrotonic currents ) .
( 4 ) Excitation as No. 2 .
The result is seen in the photographic plate as a cycle consisting of one upward mark , anelectrotonus , and three downward , the middle one katelectrotonus , the two side negative variations .

are too small to be legible , and the negative variation only is seen .
The voltage of the polarising current was J- volt , the excitation 3000 units of the Berne coil , the distance between the centre of each electrode and the next was 11 mm. In the medullated nerve the electrotonic currents exceeded the negative variation ; in the non-medullated they were so small as to be imperceptible on the photographic plate .
In order to see whether the electrotonic currents were completely absent , or merely very small , further experiments were then made , using a higher voltage in the polarising circuit .
These measurements are uncertain , both from the difficulty of measuring such very small currents , and from the fact that the cessation of anelectrotonus and the commencement of katelectrotonus excite the nerve , and the resulting negative variation in the latter case is added to the katelectrotonic current , so that except in special cases ( as in Experiment 731 ) the readings of the latter are too high .
It is also not absolutely certain that current escape has not some share in the result , though as all these effects are abolished by crushing the nerve , and as the an- and katelectrotonic currents are not equal in magnitude , and not exactly proportional to the polarising current , it is probable that this error , if it exists , is a small one .
Bearing these reservations in mind , certain conclusions may be drawn from these experiments .
The electrotonic currents in the non-medullated nerves are evidently very small , about one-fortieth of the same currents in medullated nerves .
Further , while the an- and katelectrotonic currents in the latter are nearly equal ( O'702 millivolt Table VII .

A. and K. Currents only , with Increasing Strengths of Polarising Currents .
in A and 0-595 millivolt in K in Experiment 728 ) , in the splenic nerves the anelectrotonic currents are perhaps four times greater than the katelectrotonic .
This favours the view that these currents are not due to the presence of a small percentage of medullated fibres in these nerves , but are the actual expression of the fine sheaths present around the axis-cylinder.* The result , therefore , of this series of experiments affords a very probable explanation of the diminution of the negative variation with successive excitations in the non-medullated nerve , and the relative absence of this diminution in the medullated .
For in the latter the exciting current can diffuse up and down the nerve , in the former it is strictly limited to the spot where it is applied , and the current density at the excitable axis-cylinder must be many times greater in the non-medullated nerve .
It is not surprising , therefore , that there should be a marked local effect , and whether this is termed " injury " or " fatigue " is rather a question of terminology than of fact .
* Dr. W. M. Fletcher has recently examined the sheaths of medullated and non-meduHated fibres between crossed nicols .
He finds that in the former there is characteristically present an anisotropic cholesterin deposit ; in the latter this is absent .
The sheath round the non-medullated axis-cylinder is therefore of a totally different character to that in the medullated fibre .
( Note communicated to the writer .
) See also authors quoted by Brodie and Halliburton , loc. cit. 180 Electromotive Phenomena in Nerve .
As the electrotonic currents are so small , it was not to be expected that there should be any marked alteration of excitability in the neighbourhood of the kathode or anode of a constant current Three experiments were , however , made to serve as a check on the preceding:\#151 ; Table YIII .

I have much pleasure in acknowledging the kind assistance and advice I have received from Dr. Waller in the prosecution of this research , and also in expressing my indebtedness to the Council of the Zoological Society and Dr. Chalmers Mitchell for permission to use the nerves of the horses which had been slaughtered for the carnivora .
Conclusions .
1 .
Non-medullated nerves exhibit a negative variation and current of injury of about three times the magnitude of the similar phenomena in the medullated nerves of the same animal .
2 .
The negative variation of non-medullated nerves undergoes a progressive diminution with repeated stimuli .
3 .
The immediate cause of this diminution is a localised change at the place of excitation .
4 .
Ihe electrotonic currents of non-medullated nerves are very small , about one-fortieth of those in medullated nerves .
5 .
This latter fact affords an explanation of 2 and 3 , as the exciting current , being confined to the place of application , has a greater current density and therefore a greater local effect .
