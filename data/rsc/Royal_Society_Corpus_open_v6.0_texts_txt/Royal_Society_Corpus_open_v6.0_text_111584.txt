( Abstract .
) The author notices that the problem of finding the number of double tangents was first solved by Pliicker in 1834 from geometrical considerations , and he gives a sketch of the subsequent history of the problem .
The complete analytical determination of the double tangents was only obtained very recently by Mr. Salmon , and is given in a note by him in the Philosophical Magazine , October 1858 : it is there shown that the ( n2 ) points in which the tangent at any point of a curve of the order n again meets the curve , are given as the points of intersection of the tangent with a certain curve of the order ( n-2 ) ; if this curve be touched by the tangent , then the point of contact will be also a point of contact of the tangent and the curve of the order n , or the tangent will be a doiuble tangent .
The present memoir relates chiefly to the establishment of an identical equation , which puts in evidence the property of the curve of the order ( n 2 ) , and which the author considers to be also important in reference to the general theory of binary quantities : viz. if YU=1TI(*x , y , z)n , DU= ( X +Y +y + ZaZ , )U , andY , DIE are what U , DU become when ( x , y , z ) and ( X , Y , Z ) are interchanged ; then the equation is of the form I. Y+II .
Y+ III .
DU+IV .
U=0 .
Taking ( x , y , z ) as current coordinates and U=0 as the equation of the curve , then if ( X , Y , Z ) are the coordinates of a point on the curve , Y=0 , and we have for the equation of the tangent at the point in question BY=-0 .
The equation shows that the intersections of the curve U=O and the tangent i ?
Y=0 , lie on one or other of the curves III=0 , DU=O , and that they do not lie on the curve DJU=0 ; consequently they lie on the curve III=0 , which is in fact the before-mentioned curve of the order ( n-2 ) .
