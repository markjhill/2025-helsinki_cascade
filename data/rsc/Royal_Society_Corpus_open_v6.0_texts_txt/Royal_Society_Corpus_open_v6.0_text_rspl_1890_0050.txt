" Magnetism and Recalescence .
" By J. Hopkinson , D.Sc .
, F.R.S. Received October 9 , 1890 .
In my experiments the results of which are published , 'Phil .
Trans. , ' 1889 , A , p. 443 , I showed that recalescence and the disappear-ance of magnetisability in iron and steel occurred at about the same temperature .
The evidence I then gave was sufficiently satisfactory , but did not amount to absolute proof of the identity of the temperatures .
Osmond has shown that the temperature of recalescence depends upon the temperature to which the iron has been heated , also that it differs when the iron is heated and when it is cooled .
He also showed that for some sorts of steel the heat is liberated at more than one temperature , notably that in steel with 0'29 per cent , of carbon heat is liberated when cooling at 720 ' C. and at 660 ' C. , and that with steel with 0'32 per cent , carbon there is a considerable liberation of heat before the temperature is reached when this becomes a maximum .
It appeared to be desirable to obtain absolute proof that the change of magnetic property occurred exactly when heat was liberated and absorbed , and to examine , magnetically , Osmond 's two temperatures of heat liberation .
I have not been able to obtain samples of steel of the size I used , showing two well marked temperatures of heat liberation and absorption , but I have a ring in which there is liberation of heat extending over a considerable range of temperature .
The samples had the form of rings of the size and shape indicated in fig. 1 .
A copper wire was well insulated with asbestos and laid in the groove running round the ring , and was covered with several layers of asbestos paper laid in the groove .
This coil was used for measuring temperature by its resistance .
The whole ring was served over with asbestos paper and with sheets of mica .
The secondary exploring coil was then wound on , next a serving of asbestos paper and mica , and then the primary coil , and , lastly , a good serving of asbestos paper was laid over all , In this way good insulation of the secondary coil was secured , and a reasonable certainty that the temperature coil took the precise temperature of the ring , and that at any time the ring was throughout at one and the same temperature .
The whole was placed in an iron pot , and this again in a Fletcher gas furnace .
Observations were made of temperature as the furnace was heating , and from time to time of induction .
In each case the time of observation was noted .
Similar observations were made as the ring cooled , the furnace being simply extinguished .
We are thus enabled to compare directly at the same instant the condition of the same ring as regards magnetism and as regards temperature , and\gt ; 1890 .

therefore , qualitatively as regards its absorption or liberation of heat In fig. 2 are the results for a ring containing 0*3 per cent , of carbon or thereabouts .
In this case only a cooling curve was taken .
It will he observed that there is a considerable liberation of heat , beginning at 2 h. 12 m. , temperature 715 ' C. , and continuing to time 2 h. 22 m. , temperature 660 ' C. , being apparently somewhat slower at the end .
This may , however , be only apparently slower , as the furnace temperature would fall lower in relation to the ring .
At time 2 h. 22 m. , temperature 660 ' 0 .
, the rate of liberation becomes much more rapid , bo much so that the temperature for a time remains almost stationary .
At time 2 h. 29 m. the liberation of heat appears to have ceased and the normal cooling to continue .
Now , comparing the kicks of the galvanometer , which are proportional to the induction , we observe that the ring begins to be magnetisable at time 2 h. 12 m. , its magnetic property increases till time 2 h. 22 m. ; after this point the magnetisability increases much more rapidly , and is practically developed at 2 h. 31 m. In this case the development of magnetic property follows precisely the liberation of heat , observed both at the temperature of about 700 ' C. and at 660 ' C. We may , therefore , be certain , that both at the higher and lower temperatures of recalescence there is magnetic change , and that the one is as much dependent on the other as the solid condition of ice is Bpon the liberation of heat when water solidifies .
The two changes Dr. J. Hopkinson .

occur , not only at the same temperature , but simultaneously .
A considerable magnetising force , 6*56 , was taken , as it was expected and found that the magnetic property would then be more apparent when it was in the intermediate condition between the two temperatures of recalescence .
In fig. 3 are the results of a ring containing 0*9 per cent , of carbon .
In this case we have a curve of heating and of cooling with magnetic property for comparison , and also a second cooling curve to show the recalescence temperature when the heating had been higher .
Unfortunately I had forgotten to record the magnetising force ; it was , however , much less than in the last case , probably less than unity .
Looking at the curve , we see that there is a slight absorption of hea at time 11 h. 17 m. , temperature 710 ' C. with doubtful effect on the magnetism .
At time 11 h. 27 m. , temperature 770 ' C. , powerful absorption of heat begins and continues to time 11 h. 55 m. , temperature 808 ' C. ; it is between these times that the magnetisability is dePresents .

The heating was continued to ahont 840 0 .
, and the flame was then put oat In cooling , heat is liberated at one point only , and in this case with a distinct rise of temperature .
The recalescence begins at time 3 h. 47 m. , temperature 750 ' C. , and it is precisely at this time that the ring begins to be magnetisable .
The recalescence continues to time 4 h. 8 m. , and at this time , and not before it , the magnetisability practically attains a maximum .
Before the last portion of the curve the ring was heated to 966 ' C , Here no observations were made magnetically , This part of the curve , therefore , only shows the effect of higher heating in lowering the temperature of recalescence , These experiments show that the liberation and absorption of heat , known as recalescence , and the change in magnetic condition , occur simultaneously , Also that in the case of steel with 03 per cent , of carbon both temperatures of liberation of heat are associated with change of magnetic condition , Presents , November 20 , 1890 , Transactions .
