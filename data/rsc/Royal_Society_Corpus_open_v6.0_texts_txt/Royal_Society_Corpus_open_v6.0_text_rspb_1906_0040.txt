The Specificity of the Opsonic Substances in the Blood Serum .
By William Bulloch , M.D. , and G. T. Western , M.A. , M.B. ( Communicated by Leonard Hill , F.R.S. Received February 15 , \#151 ; Read March 1 , 1906 .
) ( From the Bacteriological Laboratory , London Hospital , E. ) A relatively high degree of specificity has been demonstrated for most of the antibodies which exist in immune sera , .
, in the case of agglutinins , lysins , prsecipitins , antitoxins .
With normal sera the proof of specificity is often difficult on account of the fact that the antibodies are present in the majority of cases only in small quantities .
The following experiments are concerned with the specificity of the opsonic substances of normal and immune sera .
As is well known , these opsonic substances , discovered by Wright and Douglas , act on bacteria in such a way that the latter become an easy prey to the phagocytic leucocytes .
If a given serum be tested it will be found to exert an opsonic action on more than one kind of bacterium , and the question we have sought to answer is whether there is one or more than one opsonic substance ; in other words , whether the opsonins are specific for the different bacteria on which they exert their opsonic action .
In a previous communication* one of us ( B. ) has shown that when a microbe , e.g. , staphylococcus , is digested with normal serum at 37 ' C. for 15 minutes , and the cocci are then brought down by the aid of a centrifuge , the supernatant liquid is found to be devoid of opsonic action for staphylococci .
Where the contact of the microbe with serum has been sufficiently long , and the centrifugalisation has been complete , the opsonin for the particular microbe is totally removed .

[ Feb. 15 , We have attempted to determine whether the opsonins are specific by experiments of two kinds:\#151 ; 1 .
The first method consisted in estimating the opsonic content of a given serum towards two different bacteria .
A suspension of one of these bacteria was digested with the serum , and the mixture was thereafter centrifugalised , the resulting supernatant liquid being tested on both kinds of bacteria .
To a quantity of the supernatant liquid the second bacterial suspension was added , and after the lapse of a certain time the centrifuge was again applied , and the resulting liquid was again tested .
2 .
The second method consisted in estimating from day to day the opsonic content of the serum of human beings suffering from lupus .
At certain periods tubercle or staphylococcus vaccines were inoculated , and the effect on the two opsonic curves was determined .
1 .
Experiment on the opsonic action of normal human serum towards Staphylococcus aureus and Bacterium pyocyancum respectively .
Normal human serum was mixed with an equal volume of a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus , and the mixture was placed in the incubator for 1 hour at 37 ' C. At the end of this time the mixture w'as centrifugalised , the supernatant liquid " A " being removed from the deposit of cocci by means of a pipette .
The supernatant liquid was in part retained , the remainder being digested for 1 hour at 37 ' C. with a suspension of Bacterium pyocyancum , the latter being finally brought down as a deposit in the centrifuge , leaving a supernatant liquid " B , " which was pipetted off .

[ Feb. 15 , 2 .
Normal human serum was mixed with an equal quantity of an emulsion of Staphylococcus aureus in 0*85 per cent. NaCl solution .
The mixture was digested for 30 ' at 37 ' C. and then centrifuged , a supernatant liquid " B " being obtained .
3 .
The fluid " A " was mixed with an equal quantity of an emulsion of Staphylococcus aureus .
The mixture was digested for 30 ' at 37 ' C. and a deposit separated from a fluid " C " by the centrifuge .
4 .
The fluid " B " was mixed with an equal quantity of an emulsion of tubercle bacilli .
The mixture was digested for 30 ' at 37 ' C. , and a deposit separated from a fluid " D " by the centrifuge .
The opsonic content of the serum and of the fluids " A , " " B , " " C , " and " I ) " was then determined both for Staphylococcus aureus and tubercle bacillus in the usual way , the necessary controls being added .
In the first experiment the determinations made by each of us separately in a series of different films are given under the designation B. and W. , and the mean of these determinations .
In the second experiment the result was obtained by one of us ( W. ) alone .
It will be seen that a considerable degree of specificity exists in so far that staphylococci remove almost the whole of the opsonin for this microbe , while the opsonic substance for tubercle bacilli is in large part left unaltered .
In almost all cases we have observed a slight diminution in the quantity of the opsonin left behind .
Thus while the contact of a serum with tubercle bacilli lowered the opsonic content for this bacillus from 3'03 to 0'4 , it also produced a slight lowering of the staphylococcus opsonin from 11'2 to 9'9 6 .
Similarly , contact of a staphylococcus with serum reduced the staphylococcus opsonin from 12*45 to 0'34 , and at the same time it lowered the tubercular opsonin from 3*015 to 2*7 .
2 .
Experiment:\#151 ; The opsonic content of the serum of a patient suffering from lupus was repeatedly determined on tubercle and staphylococcus suspensions .
Iwo inoculations of tuberculin and two of staphylococcic vaccine were injected , and the influence of the inoculations is set forth in the following opsonic curve , which shows that there is no correspondence in the quantities of tuberculo-opsonins and staphylococcus opsonins when one or other of the corresponding vaccines is inoculated ( Case I ) .
In a second experiment ( Case II ) opsonic determinations were made in a similar case , with the exception that the patient was not only suffering from lupus , but septic infection of the tuberculous lesions at the same time ( Curve 2 ) .

Conclusions .
1 .
When staphylococci are brought into contact with normal huipian serum and are subsequently removed by centrifugalisation , the serum loses its opsonic power for staphylococcus , although the opsonic power of Bacterium pyocyaneum is preserved .
2 .
Contact of normal human serum with tubercle bacilli leaves the opsonic power of that serum for staphylococcus almost intact , while the opsonic power for tubercle bacillus is completely removed .
3 .
Contact of normal human serum with staphylococcus leaves the opsonic power of that serum for tubercle bacillus almost intact , while the opsonic power for staphylococcus is completely removed .
4 .
Inoculation of a human being with tuberculin causes quantitative increase in the tuberculo-opsonin , whereas the quantity of staphylococcus opsonin is unaltered .
5 .
Inoculation of a human being with staphylococcus vaccine causes a quantitative increase in the staphylococcus opsonin , whereas the quantity of tuberculo-opsonin is unaltered .
