A paper was then read , entitled , " On the supposed Powers ofSuction of the Common Leech .
" By Thomas Andrew Knight , Esq. , F.R.S. , President of the Horticultural Society .
From observing the feebleness of the muscular force exhibited by the leech in its progressive movements through the water , the author was led to doubt its possessing the powers of suction that are so uni ?
versally ascribed to it .
A fact which came under his notice above sixty years ago , of considerable loss of blood from the leg following the bite of a vigorous leech , suggested to him the idea that the animal might become filled with blood simply by the injection of its body , in consequence of the impetus with which the blood is made to flow into it from the part bitten ; ?an impetus which he imagines may be oc ?
casioned by the introduction of a peculiar kind of venom .
He considers the irritation which often accompanies the bite of a leech as corroborating this hypothesis : he admits , however , that the inflam ?
mation excited by the sting of a bee or a wasp is attended with effects of a totally opposite kind ; for , in that case , the blood , instead of having a tendency to flow , stagnates around the point where the poison has been instilled .
