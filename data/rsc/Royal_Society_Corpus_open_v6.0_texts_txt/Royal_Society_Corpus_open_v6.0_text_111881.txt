" A Seventh Memoir on Quantics .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received February 28 , 1861 .
( Abstract , ) The present memoir relates chiefly to the theory of ternary cubics .
Since the date of my Third Memoir on Quantics , M. Aronhold has published the continuation of his researches on ternary cubics , in the memoir " Theory der homogenen Functionen dritten Grades von drei Veriinderlichen , " Crelle , t. Iv .
pp. 97-191 ( 1858 ) .
He there considers two derived contravariants , linear functions of the fundamental ones , and which occupy therein the position which the fundamental contravariants PU , QU do in my third memoir ; in the notation of the present memoir these derived contravariants are YU=3T .
PU-4S.QU , ZU=--48S .
PU+T .
QU ; and for the canonical form x3 +y3 +z3 ' +61 xyz , they acquire respectively the factor ( 1 +813)2 , viz. in this case YU=(1 + 813)2 { 1 ( 4+ .
3+ 3)-3 } ZU= ( 1+813)2 { ( 1 + 21 ) ( +3 l+ S+ 3)+18812 } .
The derived contravariants have with the covariants U , HUE , even a more intimate connexion than have the contravariants PU , QU ; and the advantage of the employment of YU , ZU fully appears by M. Aronhold 's memoir .
But the conclusion is , not that the contravariants PU , QU are to be rejected , but that the system is to be completed by the addition thereto of two derived covariants , linear functions of U , HUE ; these derived covariants , suggested to me by M. Aronhold 's memoir , are in the present memoir called CU , DU ; their values are CU=--T .
U+24S .
HUE DU= 8S2 .
U-3T .
HIU : and for the canonical form 3 -y3-z3s+G61lxyz , they acquire respectively , not indeed ( 1 +813)2 , but the simple power ( 1 + 81 ) , as a factor , viz. in this case CU=(1 +813 ) { ( --1 +413 ) ( x3+y3+:')+ 181xyz DU=(1 +81 ' ) { 2(5 +413 ) ( X+y3+ 3)+3(1-1031 )xyz ; it was in fact by means of this condition as to the factor ( 1+8 3 ) , that the foregoing expressions for CU , DU were obtained .
The formulae of my third memoir and those of M. Aronhold are by this means brought into harmony and made parts of a whole ; instead of the two intermediates aU+ 6/ 3HU , 6aPU + 3QU in Tables 68 and 69 of my Third Memoir , or of the intermediates aU-+ 6ftHU -2aYU + 2/ ZU of M. Aronhold 's theory , we have the four intermediates aU + 6/ 3HU , -2aYU+ 213ZU , 2aCU-2/ 3DU , 6aPU+ 3QU in Tables 74 , 75 , 76 , and 77 of the present memoir .
These four tables embrace the former results , and the new ones which relate to the covariants CU , DU ; and they are what is most important in the preM sent memoir .
I have , however , excluded from the Tables , and I do not in the memoir consider ( otherwise than incidentally ) the covariant of the sixth order OU , or the contravariant ( reciprocant ) FU .
I have given in the memoir a comparison of my notation with that of M. Aronhold .
A short part of the memoir relates to the binary cubic and the binary quartic , viz. each of these quantics has a covariant of its own order , forming with it an intermediate aU +/ 3W , the covariants whereof contain quantics in ( a , / ) , the coefficients of which are invariants of the original quantic .
The formule which relate to these cases are in fact given in my Fifth Memoir , but they are reproduced here in order to show the relations between the quantics in ( a , 3 ) contained in the formulie .
As regards the binary quartic , these results are required for the discussion of the like question in regard to the ternary cubic , viz. that of finding the relations between the different quantics in ( a , / 3 ) contained in the formulae relating to the ternary cubic .
Some of these relations have been obtained by M. Hermit in the memoir " Sir les forms cubiques a trois indeterminees , " Liouville , t. iii .
pp. 37-40 ( 1858 ) , and in that " Sir la Resolution des equation du quatrieme degre , " Comptes Rendus , t. xlvi .
p. 715 ( 1858 ) , and by M. Aronhold in his memoir already referred to ; and in particular I reproduce and demonstrate some of the results in the last mentioned memoir of M. Hermit .
But the relations in question are in the present memoir exhibited in a more complete and systematic form .
