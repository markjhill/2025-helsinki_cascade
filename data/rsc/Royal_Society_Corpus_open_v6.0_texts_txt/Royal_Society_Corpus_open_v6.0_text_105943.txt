A Computation of the Distance of the Sun from the Earth .
By S. Horsley , L L. B. Rector of Saint Mary , Newington , in Surry , F. R. S. I Offer the following computation , rather as a verification than an amendment of Dr. Stewart 's .
The method , in which I have pursued , is different from what is used by that great and able geometrician , in his treatise on the distance of the sun , but founded entirely on the theorems established in that and the preceding tracts of the same author .

Let TA be a given line .
Take A m , so that TA may be to A m , as the moon 's accelerating attraction to the earth , to the sun 's mean disturbance of that attraction .
Take AG quintuple of A m. Take A P , such that twice Am may be to A P , as TG to T A. Now it is proved in the twenty-fifth proposition of Dr. Stewart 's fourth tract , that the cube of TA is to the cube of T P , in the duplicate proportion of the periodic month to the anomalistic month .
Therefore the proportion of TA3 to TP 3 , and consequently that of TA to T P , is given ; and by division , that of TA to AP is given .
Therefore TA being given , AP is given .
Now T G : TA=2A m : A P. That is , TA5A m : TA=2A m : A P. Therefore TA~2Am =TA5Am~A P. Therefore 2Am=TA~AP5Am~A P/ T A. That is 2Am+5Am~A P/ T A , or 2TA+5AP~A m/ T A=A P. That is , FIG. 1 .
Am=TA~A P/ 2 TA+5APPT AmG 2 .
Let TA represent the moon 's mean distance from the earth .
Take T V , such that TA may be to TV , in the duplicate proportion of the periodic month to the sidereal year .
Take TG , such that VT may FIG. 2 .
x B VDEAGTo be to TG in the proportion of the moon 's accelerating attraction to the earth , to the sun 's mean disturbance of that attraction .
Take TE , such that TE may be to TA , as TA to TG .
Take EO , such that the rectangle EOA may be equal to 3 TE ~ TA .
Upon the centre T , with the interval TA , describe a circle .
Draw Ox perpendicular to AB , meeting the circle in x. Take AD= AT .
The proportion of TA to TV being given , and TA being given , TV is given .
But the proportion of TV to TG is given .
Therefore TG is given , and the proportion of TG to TA is given .
T G : TA=T A : T E. Therefore the proportion of TA to TE is given .
Therefore TE is given .
Therefore 3TE~TA is given .
Therefore EO~OA is given .
And EA ( = TET A ) is given .
Therefore AO is given .
But AB ( = 2 AT ) is given .
Therefore OB is given .
Therefore AO~OB is given .
AO~OB=O x2 ( by the circle ) .
Therefore O x2 , and consequently Ox is given .
But DB ( = 3A T ) is given .
Therefore the proportion of DB to Ox is given .
And the proportion of DB to O x , is that of the mean distance of the sun , to the mean distance of the moon .
This is in brief the method of my computation .
The computation is as follows : The periodic month is to the anomalistic month , as 57600 to 58091 .
Therefore ( in Fig. 1 .
) T A3 : T P3 = 576002 : 580912 = 3317760000 : 3374564281 3374564281/ 3317760000 = 1,0171212748963155c864197530c864197530 , &amp;c. Hence , by extracting the cube root , I find T A : TP= 1 : 1,005674827053 .
Therefore put TA= 1 .
Then TP= 1,005674827053 ; and AP= 0,005674827053 .
Hence TA~A P/ 2 TA+5AP= 0,002797722 =A m. ( See Fig. 2 ) .
The square of the periodic month is to the square of the sidereal year , as 1 to 178,725 .
Therefore TA : TV = 1 : 178,725 .
But TV : TG = 1 : 0,002797722 .
Therefore TA : TG = 1 : 178,725 ~ 0,002797722 = 1 : 0,50002286445 .
TA : TG = TE : TA .
Therefore TE : TA = 1 : 0,50002286445 .
Therefore put TE = 1 .
Then TA = 0,50002286445 And EA= 0,49997713555 And 3 TE ~ TA = 1,50006859335 =EO A. Hence AO ( = ~ TE ~ TA ~E A2/ 4 EA/ 2 ) = 1,00003658292 .
But AB = 2TA = 1,00004572890 Therefore OB = 0,00000914598 Therefore AO ~ OB = 0,0000091463145866546616 Therefore ~ AO ~ OB = 0,00,32024287 =Ox But DB = 3TA = 1,500068593 Hence DB : Ox= 496,0073 : 1 .
These computations have been made with no small rigor .
I was sensible that , to obtain an accurate conclusion , it was necessary to determine AO with extreme precision ; and for that purpose I submitted to the laborious task of computing the foregoing numbers to the 11th or 12th decimal place , by the common operations of arithmetic .
In the result I differ from Dr. Stewart , by much less than 1/ 6 000 th part of the whole distance , that is , by less than 5 semidiameters of the earth ; a very contemptible difference in so nice a calculation .
That great mathematician indeed seems to have flattered himself , that he had determined the sun 's distance within 1/ 4 30000 of the truth .
I suspect that when he affirmed this , he did not consider that to attain so great an accuracy in the conclusion , the line Eq in his method ( vide Stewart on the sun 's distance , Fig. 10 .
) , or AO in mine , should be determined strictly to the 11th or 12th decimal place .
And after the utmost rigor of computation , I am afraid any pretensions to such extreme nicety in the result will be but ill-founded .
For it is very likely that these computations represent the sun 's distance less than it really is : because the whole progression of the moon 's apogee ( which is the basis of the calculation ) is ascribed to the sun 's disturbance of the moon 's gravitation to the earth .
Whereas part of it must be due to the disturbances of the planets .
What part is due to them we cannot tell , and therefore cannot allow for it .
But in giving the whole to the sun we certainly overrate his disturbing force , and by that means must obtain too small a distance .
It is most likely indeed , that the motion of the apogee produced by the disturbing forces of the planets bears but a very small , perhaps insensible , proportion to the whole .
But those who are masters of Dr. Stewart 's theorems will easily perceive that an insensible error in the proportion of the moon 's gravity , and the sun 's disturbance , may produce a very sensible error in the proportion of the mean distances .
And therefore the real distance is probably greater by two or three semidiameters of the earth than these computations make it .
This , however , is much too nice a point for the approaching transit , or , perhaps , for any method of observation , to determine .
The highest expectations f astronomers will be answered , if they can come within 50 or 60 semidiameters of the earth .
It is to be hoped , that every civilized nation of the universe will give due attention to that interesting phenomenon , which we , the present possessors of these sublunary regions , shall behold no more ; and that proper persons will be sent in due time , and duly equipped , to the most advantageous stations .
If the decisions of observation in so nice a point should be found to agree with the previous conclusions of theory , the disciples of Newton will have no small reason to exult in a new attestation of nature , to the truth of their great master 's doctrine .
But it is much to be wished , that they , who shall be deputed to prosecute this curious search , in distant and sequestered parts , may divest themselves of all prejudice ; that they may have nothing at heart , but , that which the world will expect from them , the the advancement of real science ; that they may be diligent in their observations , and faithful in their reports ; and not sacrifice the repose of their own minds , or the interests of philosophy , to the credit of an admired hypothesis , the memory of a friend , or the jealousies of rival nations .
If the moon 's mean distance from the earth be 60 1/ 2 semidiameters of the earth , the sun 's mean distance is 30008,4416 semidiameters of the earth .
The sun 's semidiameter is to the semidiameter of the earth , as 139,876 to 1 .
The globe of the sun is to the globe of the earth , as 2736718,8 to 1 ; and the sun 's horizontal parallax is 6~ 52~,415 .

To satisfy myself more fully of the accuracy of my work , I this day re-computed the whole , from the determination of E A , in Dr. Stewart 's approximating method .
I found the proportion of DB to us ( see Dr. Stewart on the distance of the sun , Fig. 10 .
) , that of 496,00579 to 1 ; and the proportion of DB to t v , that of 496,00805 to 1 .
The mean of these two gives the proportion of DB to o x , nearly that of 496,0069 to 1 .
Which differs from the result of my former computation by less than 1/ 1 240000 of the whole ; and the method of the former computation is undoubtedly the most accurate .
Supplement to the foregoing Paper .
IN deducing the distance of the sun in semidiameters of the earth , and his horizontal parallax , from the proportion above concluded between the sun 's mean distance and that of the moon ; I have supposed the latter to be 601/ 2 semidiameters of the earth , as it is reckoned by Sir Isaac Newton .
According to the hypothesis which seems to be now generally received , that the density of the moon is very nearly equal to that of the earth , ( the French reckon it rather less ) , the moon 's mean distance should be little more than 60,23207 , that is , not quite 601/ 4 semidiameters of the earth .
But from some computations that I have formed with great care ; I have reason to think , that Sir Isaac Newton 's determination is much nearer to the truth ; that the density of the moon is actually greater than that of the earth , in the proportion of 6 to 5 nearly ; and that the moon 's mean distance amounts to 60,441 semidiameters of the earth ; which differs from the distance assigned by Sir Isaac Newton , by less than 1/ 1 007 of the whole .
