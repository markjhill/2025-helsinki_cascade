IN the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1807 , Dr. BRINKLEY has investigated the general value of the coefficient of any term in the development of the function i ) ' and his result is remarkable for the mode of its expression in terms of the successive differences of the powers of zero , or of the numbers comprised in the general expression Am0 " .
Since that time , in my paper published in the Transactions of the Society for 1815 , " On the Development of Exponential Functions , " I have exhibited other , and much more simple as well as more easily calculable expressions for the same coefficient , by means of the same useful and valuable differences , and in that and other subsequent memoirs , have extended their application to a variety of interesting inquiries in the theory of differences and series .
It is singular , however , that up to the present time it has never been shown that the formulae of Dr. BRINKLEY , and my own , though affording in all cases coincident numerical results , are analytically reconcileable with each other ; nor indeed is it at all easy to see either from the course of his investigation , which turns upon an intricate application of the combinatory analysis , or from the nature of the formula itself , how it is possible to pass from the one form of expression to the other so as to show their identity .
This is what I now propose .
Referring to my " Collection of Examples in the Calculus of Finite Differences* , " will be found the following relation , which enables us to pass from the differences of any one power of zero , as 0 , to those of any other , as 0"+ " , viz.{log( ( l + )}.n(A)0-x=(x-1 ) ... .

or changing x into x+-n , { log ( l+A ) ) }.f(A)0x+n=(x+l)(x+2 ) ... .
( x+n).f(A)0 .
As this equation is general so long as negative indices of A do not occur , we may f(A ) change f(A ) into ( l ( 1 ) ) and it becomes f(a)log = ( A ) } ) f(A)0-=(x+l ) ... .(x+n ) .
0 provided always that fcontains no negative powers of A. In this for f(A ) sub* Camb .

This term then may be simply struck out , and we have only to consider the development in A of / d n- ' -Sn ] o dV/ v Now this is equal to d ?

Note by A. CAYLEY , M.A. , F.R.S. The above formula ( B. ) , substituting therein for A , the value V O"X , becomes I { x + rn ] 1 [ x + n}0[ V-nOx1 { [ n 1 22.3. .

This formula et.1 is , in fact , true if R , instead of being restricted to denote -- , denotes any function whatever of the form I+ t+ct2+ &amp;c. , and it is true not only for the term in t ' , but for all the powers of t not higher than tx .
And , moreover , R- " may denote any positive or negative integral or fractional power of R. In fact , the formula ( assuming for a moment the truth of it ) shows that the expansion of any power whatever of a series of the form in question , can be obtained by means of the expansions of the successive positive integer powers of the same series : the existence of such a formula ( at least for negative powers ) was indicated by EISENSTEIN , Crelle , t. xxxix .
p. 181 ( 1850 ) , and the formula itself , in a slightly different form , was obtained in a very simple manner by Professor SYLVESTER in his paper , " Development of an idea of EISENSTEIN , " Quart .

1)+ &amp;c. : if we attend only to the terms involving powers of t not higher than t ?
, the series on the right-hand side need only be continued up to the term involving ( R-1 ) , and the right side being thus converted into a rational and integral function of R , it may be developed in a series of powers of R ( the highest power being of course IR ) , and the coefficients of the several powers are finite series which admit of summation ; this gives the required formula .
But there is an easier method ; the process shows that the series on the righthand side , continued as above up to the term involving t , is , as regards n , a rational and integral function of the degree x ; and by LAGRANGE'S interpolation formula , any rational and integral function of n of the degree x , can be at once expressed in terms of the values corresponding to ( x+1 ) particular values of n. The investigation will be as follows:-Let R denote a series of the form 1 +b ct+2+ &amp;c. , and let R " denote the development of the nth power of R , continued up to the term containing tx , the terms involving higher powers of t being rejected .

, R ' , R2 , &amp;c. , and generally Rs , will in like manner denote the developments of these powers up to the term involving tX , or what is the same thing , they will be the values of RE , corresponding to n==0 , 1 , 2,..s .
By what precedes R " is a rational and integral function of n of the degree x , and it can therefore be expressed in terms of the values R ?

R , which correspond to n=0 , 1 , 2 , .

The required formula is thus seen to be l_ , , ( nn-.n.n-2 ... n-x 1 n-s s.s-1 ... 2.i.-1.-2 ... -(-(x s ) Is where the summation extends to the several values s= 0 , 1 , 2 ... x ; or , what is the same thing , it is R PIn.n-ln --2..n-x ( s &gt; \ n-s 1.2 ... s. 1.2 ...
