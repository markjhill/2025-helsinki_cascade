By niitarillsam Morganw Esq. F. P. S. Read May 15 , 1794 Ix the last paper which I communicated to the Royal Society oll the doctrille of survixrorships , I concluxled with observing that , as far as my own juclgment could discover , I had then given rules for determining the values of reversions depending upon three lives in every case which admitted of an exact solutiolln and that the remaining cases , which were nearly equal in nllmber to those I had already investigated7 involved a contingericy for which it appeared very diflicult to find such a general expression as shotlld not render the rules too complicated and laborious .
Since that period I have bestowed much time allsl attention on thiS subject , and have at length so far succeeded as to give me reason now to hope that it is capable of being elatirely exllausted .
It is not my present design to enter into^the investigation of all the probletus which still remain to be solxled .
I.shall laere confine myself to a few of the most important , reserving the conclusion of the subject for some fuZure opportunity .
The contillgency to wthich I have alltlded in this and nzy former papern as opposing the great difficulty in those problems uZhich I have not yet solved is that of one lDeJsfailing : 223 3 after another in a given time .
It becomes necessary , therefore , previous to any other investigation , to deduce a general method of ascertainin$ such an event , and for this purpose I shall subjoin the following lemma LEM .
MA .
To determine , from any table of observations , the probability that B the elder dies after A the younger of two lives , either in any given number of years , or during the whole continuance of the life of B. SOLUTION .
This event can take place in the first year only by the ex tinction of both lives , A having died first , the probability of which will be expressed by the fraction b-z7}1b a.* In the second year the probability will be increased ; for the event may have taken place , as above merltioned , ill the first year , or the lives may have failed in the second year , A having died first ; or B may have died in thi5 year , and A in the first year .
The expression , therefore , for the second year will be bm ( w ' mn* a " Jrm-n : n=bx2+2 the third year the probability will be still further increased ; for , in addition to the regoing contingencies , the esrent may have taken place -by the extinction of the two lives in the third year , A having died first ; or by the extinGtion of the life of A ln the first or second years , and of the life of B in the third year .
Therefore , the probability for the third year will be expressed by b_m.(z ' 4 m_n.a " + m_s1.( ' + n-(j.zz " ' + n-o.c/ +a ' ' I 2ab 2ab ( b 2ab ab ab b-o .

S26 importance , and tne solutions of a great number of problems require that it should be previously ascertained , I have computed a similar table on the present occasion ; and it will appear from the following operations that both are formed in rlearly the same maIlner .

+6'X.33+6'+57X23+ &amp; C.2864 9I 8I 6SX6t+65+63X46+63460X33+ &amp; C. =.2907 90 80 92 8979 Frotn these specimetls it will be readily seen , that the probability between two younger lives is derived from that of the two preceding older ones , without any addition of labour ; fol the sum of all the terms of the series , excepting the tvvro firsts is constantly obtained from the foregoing operations .
Thus , when the ages of B and A are 92 and 82 , the two terms S5 +48 x8 q_ 48 +4I x3 form a part of the preceding series , which expresses the probability between two persons aged 93 and 83 .
And in like manner when heir ages are 91 and 8s , the three terms 57+525X1S+ &amp;c. form a part of the series which denotes the probability between two persons , aged 92 and 82 .
By proceeding with these operations , a table may be formed for all lives , wlzose common difference of age is the same , with little more trotlble than in the single case of the two youngest lives .
If a table of the probabilities of survivorship be already formed ( such as that to which I have referred in my first paper ) , the operations in the present case may be exceedingly abridged ; and it will not perhaps be improper here to explain the manner in which this is effected .
By exchanging the symbols c , dts e , &amp;c. in the solution in my first paper , for their equals ms n , o , &amp;c. in the present solution , the series expressing the probability of B 's surviving A will become al , Xb 2a +m * aZ ++ t. a2+ ... ... .
+t 2a , which exceeds the series expressing the probability of B 's dying after A by Zb X a'2ra"2ra " ' ... . .
+a ( or supposing , as in the Northampton Table , to be- ) by aabX nearly .
If , therefore , the givela probability of B 's surviving A be denoted by Y , the probability of B 's dying after A will be =y_ aabqr , and the probability of A 's dying after B will be =a aX ' -Y .
The following table has been computed in this manner , excepting the first and the two last divisions , where the difference of age between the two lives is 10 , 80 , and go years .
In these cases , the probabilities have been deduced from the series in this lerllma , and chiefly with the view of proving the accuracy of the table itl sny first paper It is however necessuryto observenthat in the abovementioned series abx2'+a"+ at &gt; t ... . .
a , thelastternl , ( a2 ) by supposing the whole series_ aat , t , is taken at , and therefore the difference betsveell Y and thP probability of B 's dying after A , is not exactly expressed above .
IRegard has been had to this circumstance in the following table , in all cases where the age of the eldest life exceeds 86 years .
But under that age it is omitted , as the expression aab becolues then true to four places of decituals , and of consequence sufiiciently correct for any laseful purpose .

*I 47 7 *1433 *I3 90 In the solution of all the problems which invollre the contingency in the foregoing table , the constant method of ascer taining it has hitherto been , by taking half the probability of the two lives becoming extinct in a given time , both in the case of the elder lifeJs dying after the younger , and of the younger 's dying after the elder .
Wllen the ages of the two lives are very different , this method ( as I have obsersred in my former paper ) must be incorrect .

But this perhaps will be bettels llnderstood from the following problelus , and from the computations which are made to prove the correctlless of the ge neral rvllesO PROBLENI ; I. TO filled the value of an annuity on the life of C after A , on vlle particular condition that 's life when lt fa ; ils shall fail before the life of Bo SOLUTIVN .
As tEre a-pproximatlon appears from the preceding table to be always sufficiently corrects except in the two or three last years of Bs life , it is evidentX that if the fractions which express the p.roba^bility of l3 's dying after A in those yearsa be either confined only to the value of the annuity during that short periodn or be llot ivolved at all in the computation , no gXreat inaccllracy will arise from having recourse to the ordi nary method of determining that probability , provided the so lution be founded on real observations of life , and not on Mr. De iWOlVRE9S hypothesis .
Ill the present problem , when C or A is the oldest of the three lives the abovementiorled fractions either never enter into the computation , or are confined to t}ae last years of A 's life ; a &lt; d in both cases they are combined 1H l 2 with another contingencyX which necessarily renders them ; of less consequence .
The solution , therefore , particularly ila the former cassee becomes very easy v and even in the latter , by the assistance of the table in lntr first paper , * it becomes eqelvllly simple and correct .
But when B is the oldest of the three lives the above fr'actions are coznbined with a series wlwich is often of cotlsiderable importance , and consequently the common method of solution fails in this case .
Yet evela here , bF ing possess ( l of the table deduced from *he foregoing lemma it is attended with little or no dffictalty , and a general rule as short and accurate is obtained as in the other cases .
This however will be more satisfactorily proved by the following operations .
lst .
Let C be the oldest of the three Itbves .
In the first year the payment of the annuity depellds on one or other of two events ; either that A and B both die tS 11Klving di@d last ) , and that C lives , the probability of sYhich event is expressed by a* ba &gt; ^n *d or that only k dies , and that B and C both live , which probability is expressed ljy aaZm , Gds The value , therefore , of the annuity for the first year will be a bd +a 1nd .
In the second zabct zfxbcr year , the payment of the atlnuity depends nearly on the same eYents : lSt .
that A and B both die in the first or second year ( B having died Iast ) , and that C lives to the end of this term , _. .
hi hi eXb n a+a ; or 2dly , that onlyAhas died before the end of the second year , and that B and C have both lived , , .
which is wea a. Herlce the value of the annuity for the abc second year will be-beq 4dcr2 +9teZtbct2a In the third year , by followilag the same steps , the ralue of the annuity will be founfl _ hf ^ ( ; +zz +tz +of .

Q. E. D. ANhen the lives are all equal , the general rule decluced either from the series or the foregoing expressions becomes = c_cccs which is kllourn to be the exact value in this case from selfevident prirlciples .
As this method of solution is a)plicable to a great number of problems , I has-e thought it necessary to make the following comptltations , with the view of determining how far it may be depended upon .
It is to be observed , that the first series of t__ fractions in the ab.ove solution , or fi * 0-in .

and that it is ilepossible to find a general expression which shallbe equcal to ; this latter series and at the same time fit for use .
'this has render.ed it necessary to have recourse to the present approxilnation .
But in the first c-olumn of the following exampl-es , each term of this last series has been separately computed , so that by comparing the values in that and the second coluann an exact idea may be formed of the accu S.^acy cf.the pr.@ceding rulesO Annuity of\#163 ; x &lt; , True value..1s$8 406 S3 ' 13.8S , __1 1 .

It should likewise be observed , that these examples are case$ sn which the difference is likely to be greatestn and therefore a nearer approximation need not be required .
Botll Mr. SIMP_ SON and myself have given solutions of this problem , and iIl most of the foregoing examples the values derived from them are more correct than could have been expected , but these solutions being foutlded on a wrong hypo !
-hesis , are not so corx-st as the presexlt , es ; ept when C is the ol ; ieot of the three lives , nor are they even more simple , so that it can nowr be seldom Izecessary to have recourse to them .
Without the assistance of the preceding lemma , and the computations which have been just made , it would not have been possible to have ascertained the degree of accuracy of any approximation ; and therefore were no other end answered by them , this of i:self would be of sufficielat consequence to deserve the time and labour which I have bestowed upDn this subject .
But it will appear , in the solution of some of the succeeding problems , that the use an(l application of this lemma , and especially of the table deduced frol:n it , are much more extensive and im portaxlt .

PROBLE1M IY .
To find the vaTue of a given StllB S , payable on the death of A an(l C , should B ( lie before oil life in particular ( A ) .
SOLUTION .
The paymentof S in the first yeardepends on the contingency of the three lives having become extinct ( A having survived , B ) , which is expressed by b-m2aCbc d years , a1ld A and C both die in that year : and Sthly , If A should die af er B in any of t87 e preceding years , and C die in that year .

If this last value be called Y , and the value of an annuity of X 1 .
on the longest of the two lives of A and C be called ZS the required value will be_ __ S* rr IX V-Z Y ; that is , the value of the given sum in this case is " the difference between its value after the extinction of the lives of A and C , on the contingency of B 's sir ; " viving A , and the whole value of the reversion after the " death of A and C , without any restriction .
" This rule is self-evident , and proves the truth of the foregoing investigations .
The solution of this problem may also be derived from the second problem in this paper , and the third problem in my papercommunisated ill theyear z788.$ In other words , " the cc value of S in the present case is equal to the difference be ; ss tween its value after the death of A and B , provided B 6 ; shollld die before A , and the value of an annuity equal to sc the interest of S during the life of C after A , provided A { ' should survive B. " Let the first of these values be denoted by W , and the second by X , and the required value will be a Wf S rrl X X. When the three lives are equal , the lralue of the reversion evidently becomes _s 2r tX V-L , which expression may be easily derirred from either of the rules given above , or immediately from the series themselves .
Having given so many examples of the accuracy of the rules in the first and second problems , it becomes unnecessary to add any filrther examples in regard to the two foregoing problems , as the solutions of the latter are derived from those of the former , and consequently are equally correct in all cases .
PROBLEM V. To find the value of a given sum payable on the decease of B and C , should their lives be the last that shall fail of the three lives A , 13 , alacl Cs SOIsU Tl-ON .
In the first year the given sum can be received only provided the three lives shall have failed , and the life of A have been the first that became extinct .
Il1 the second and following years it may be received provided either of fotlr events shall have happened : lst , If all the three li ?
es shall have failed in that year , A dying first .
2dly , If A shall have died in any of the-foregoing years , and B and C both died in that year .
sdly , If B and A shall have-both died in the foregoing years ( Bdyinglast ) , and-Cdied in thatyear .
4thly , If Cand A shall have both died in the foregoing years ( C dying last ) , and B died in that year .

If B and C are both of them older b than A , and alsn are nearly of the same age , this general rule will be sufficiently correct .
But if the ages of B and C differ much from each other , it is evident that the antluity on the single life of the younger of them ( suppose C ) , and on the joint lives of AC and AT , ought to be contillued only for as many years as are equal to the difference between the age of B and of the oldest life in the table of observations .
In this case also there is a f-urther value of S\#171 ; after the necessary extinction of the life of B , arising from the contingency of that life 's having failed after the life of A , and of C 's having failed after both of thems Let , q &gt; C ' and AtC ' respectively denote the sam\#162 ; vaTues as itl the third part of the first problem , and let .

true values , I have in the following examples undergone the labour of separately computing each of those latter fractions , and the results appear to differ so little from the approxinzated values , that I think a greater degree of accuracy need not be requiredJ Valzze of f aoo , payable on the contingency in this problem , computedfrom the Northampton table , at 4 per cent. 85 7S 75 7S 65 65 80 80 80 73 78 64 7o 78 S1 467 2.2t33 2.761 1.698 3.031 2.588 9 4S7 lo.sog 1.438 2.150 2.589 2.912 2.t580 g.oU'S 9.618 oss 20 7o o 0.029 o.c8 , o.172 0.1815 o. &lt; zg o.oo8 o. g89 o.+gt I have chosen those-cases in which likely to have been most inaccurate , the approximation was for if the ages of A and B are either both younger , or differ less from each other than they do in these examples , it is obvious that the foregoing rules lZlUSt be still nea-rer the truth .
I have also unifornlly supposed the life of B to be older than that of A , and of consequence the approximated value always errs in excess ; if the life of A had been the older of the two , it vYould have been found to have erred in defect , and nearly to the same amotlnt .
But as , in this latter case , the value of the reversion is grvater than when B is the older life , the error must necessarily bear a less proportion to the whole value than it does in the preceding examples .
With regard to the fifth problem , the error in some cases is greater ill others less thaIl in the present problem .
If B and C are both olcler than A it will be nearly twice as great .
If one is ol ?
cleAr and the other youngerS it will be altogether inconsiderable ; for the fractions rfhich express the probability of the c1der of B and C dying after A will be as much above the truth , as the other fraciions expressing the probability that the yo ; Xager of these two lines die after A wrill be below it , and thus the errors of one correct those of the other , and render the computation almost perfecsly accurate .
I have not given any examples to that problem , not only as the correctness of its rules may be inferrefl from ] the examples which have been givell to thoce of the preseslt problem , but as I wished to make as few adXlitialls as posXc , ibie to a paper , which Ilaving engaged a large portion of my time and attetltion for the last three years , has already become too long , and for which my only apology is the attempt to give correct , and 1lot very laborious , solutions to some of the most difficult and complicated cases in the doctrine of sulvivorslaipsW
