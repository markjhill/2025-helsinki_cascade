6 , I823 lr a piece of very hard steel be softened , it is natural to suppose that the operation will produce a corresponding change in the elastic power , and that the same load would produce a greater flexure in the soft state than in the hard one when all other circumstances were the same .
Mr. CouLOMB inferred from some comparative experiments on small specimens , that the state of temper does not alter the elastic force of steel ; and your Experiments on Vibration led to the same conclusion ( Not .
Philos. II .
403 ) .
But the subject appeared to require further investigation , and particularly because it afforded an opportunity of ascertaining some other facts respecting steel , which had not been before examined .
In making the experiments which I am about to describe , each bar was supported at its ends by two blocks of cast iron .
These blocks rested upon a strong wooden frame .
The scale to contain the weights was suspended from the middle of the length of the bar , by a cylindrical steel pin of about 3ths of an inch in diameter .
And as in experiments of this kind it is desirable to have the means of raising the weight from the bar , without altering its position , in order to know when the load is sufficient to produce a permanent change of structure , I have a powerful screw with a fine thread fixed over the center of the apparatus , by which the scale can be raised or lowered , when the cords on which the screw acts are looped on to the cross pin by which the scale is suspended .
To measure the flexure , a quadrantal piece of mahogany is fixed to the wooden frame ; two guides are fixed on one edge of the mahogany , in which a vertical bar slides , and gives motion to an index .
The bar and index are so balanced , that one end of the bar bears with a constant pressure on the specimen , and the graduated arc over which the index moves is divided into inches , tenths , and hundredths ; and thousands are measured by a vernier scale on the end of the index .
There is a screw at the lower end of the vertical bar , by which the index is set to zero , when necessary , Plate XX .
The first trials were made with a bar of blistered steel of a very good quality .
It was drawn out by the hammer to the width and thickness I had fixed upon , and then filed true and regular .
It was then hardened , and tempered to the same degree of hardness as common files .
The total length of the bar was 14 inches ; the distance between the supports s1 inches ; the breadth of the bar 0.95 inches , and the depth 0.375 inches ; the thermometer varied from 55 ?
to 57 ?

lbs. inches , With a load of 54 the depression in the middle was o.og 82 o.oS T11 0.04 The last load remained on the bar some hours , but produced no permanent alteration of form .
The temper of the bar was then lowered to a rather deep straw yellow , and it was tried again ; when the same loads produced exactly the same flexures as before .
The temper was then lowered till the colour was an uniform blue , or spring temper ; and the trials were repeated with the same loads ; but the flexures were still the same .
It was now heated to redness and very slowly cooled .
In this state the same loads still produced the same flexures ; and the load of Io lbs. caused no permanent change of form .
The bar was hardened again , and made very hard ; in this state the same loads produced the same flexures ; and lbs. inches .

When the bar was relieved from the load of 350 lbs. it retained a permanent flexure of o.oo5 inches , which increased to 0.01 with the addition of lolbs .
to the load .
I found that a bar of much greater length might be tempered without difficulty , and therefore had another bar made of the same kind of steel ; the length of which being 25 inches , about double the flexure could be given with the same strain upon the material , and therefore any small degree of difference in the elastic force might be more easily detected , for the preceding experiments are sufficient to show that if there be any .
difference , it must be extremely small .
The breadth of this bar was 0.92 inches ; the depth o.36 inches ; and the distance between the supports 24 inches .
It was soft , so as to yield easily to the file .

had been upon the bar about a minute , it emitted a faint creaking sound , and consequently I ceased to add fresh weights ; in about fourteen minutes the bar broke , exactly in the middle of the length .
On comparing the fractures of the specimens , there was no apparent difference except in colour .
The grain was fine , and equal ; the small sparkles of metallic lustre abundant , and equally diffused ; but in the harder specimen they had a whiter ground .
From these experiments it appears that the elastic force of steel is sensibly the same in all states of temper .
The height of the modulus of elasticity , calculated by the formula you have given in your Not .
Phil. ( Vol. II .
p. 48 ) is , according to the first experiment , 8,827,300 feet .
And according to the second experiment 8,81o , ooo feet .
Now the height of the modulus , as you had determined it for steel by Experiments on Vibration , is 8,530,000 feet .
( Not .
Phil I. p. 86 .
) The modulus for cast steel calculated from DULEAU'S experiments ( Essai Th6orique et Experimental sir le Fer Forge , p. 38 ) is 9,400,000 feet , and for German steel 6,600,000 feet .
The force which produces permanent alteration is to that which causes fracture in hard steel , as 350:580 ; or as i : 1.66 in the same steel of a straw yellow temper as 150 : 385 , or as i:,.56 .
When the tension of the superficial particles at the strain which causes permanent alteration , is calculated by the formula given in my Essay on the Strength of Iron , p. 146 , !
nd Edition , it is 45 , ooolbs .
upon a square inch in tempered steel ; and the absolute cohesion ii5 , ooolbs .
Mr. RENNIE found the direct cohesion of blistered steel to be 33 , ooolbs .
( Philosophical Transactions for 8 8 .
) But in the very hard bar , the strain which produced permanent alteration was 51 , ooolbs .
for a square inch , and the absolute cohesion only 85 , ooolbs .
From these comparisons I think it will appear , that in the hardening of steel , the particles are put in a state of tension among themselves , which lessens their power to resist extraneous force .
The amount of this tension should be equal to the difference between the absolute cohesion in different states .
Taking Mr. RENNIE 's experiment as the measure of cohesion in the soft state , it will be s , ooo 0 11 5,000 = and strength of hard and soft steel .
i8 , ooolbs .
for the tension with a straw yellow temper ; and 133 , ooo 85,000 = 48 , ooolbs .
for the tension in hard steel .
And if this view of the subject be correct , the phenomena of hardening may be explained in this manner , which nearly agrees with what you have observed in your Lectures 1 , p. 644 : after a piece of steel has been raised to a proper temperature , a cooling fluid is applied capable of abstracting heat more rapidly from the surface than it can be supplied from the internal parts of the steel .
Whence the contraction of the superficial parts round the central ones which are expanded by heat ; and the contraction of the central parts in cooling , while they are extended into a larger space than they require at a lower temperature , produces that uniform state of tension , which diminishes so much the cohesive force in hard steel .
The increase of'bulk by hardening agrees with this explanation ; and it leads one to expect , that any other metal might be hardened if we could find a means of abstracting heat with greater velocity than its conducting power .
