I append a reduced sketch of one of the two frameworks over which , as previously described , I suspended these instruments , with attached counterpoises , and so avoided all confusion .
Both pair of canulse and two pair of forceps are here represented ; they might be so arranged ; but it is better to divide the instruments , equally , between the two frames .
For removing clogs from the canulse , I tried a great many plans , none with as much success as I could wish .
I have , however , been able to extract clots from the artery itself , a good quarter of an inch beyond the canulee , with a wire whose end had been cut with a file into a delicate solid corkscrew .
I washed out the canulse , before reconnecting , with a thin stream of water sent through the quill of a small bird , which I had fastened , by help of a short India-rubber tube , to my syringe .
The wounds require careful dressing , just like those of a man .
The rabbits bear the operations wonderfully well , and appear to suffer little or no pain when the influence of the anaesthetics happens to have left them temporarily sensible .
They are often quite frisky when released , and sometimes look as though nothing whatever unusual had happened to them , all through the time of their recovery .

The action of nitric acid upon orcin has been studied by several chemists , but with comparatively negative results .
Schunck *f* in this manner obtained a red resinous substance , which by further treatment with the acid was oxidized to oxalic acid ; and in 1864 DeLuynes j ; found that orcin dissolved in cooled fuming nitric acid without evolution of nitrous fumes , and that the addition of water precipitated a red colouring-matter ; the long-continued action of the vapour of fuming nitric acid on powdered orcin likewise produced a red dye apparently identical with the above .
These , however , were resinous uncrystallizable substances .
Although under ordinary circumstances only resinous products are obtained by treating orcin with nitric acid , yet , when colourless orcin in fine * A Preliminary Notice with this title was published in the 'Chemical News , ' August 26,1870 .

powder is gradually added to strong nitric acid cooled a freezing-mixture , it dissolves with a pale brown coloration , but without the slightest evolution of nitrous fumes .
If this solution be now slowly dropped into concentrated sulphuric acid cooled to \#151 ; 10 ' C. , the mixture becomes yellow and pasty , from the formation of nitro-orcin , which is but slightly soluble in sulphuric acid .
When this is poured into a considerable quantity of cold water , the nitro-body separates as a bright yellow crystalline powder , quite free from any admixture of resin .
After numerous experiments the following was found to be the most advantageous process for the preparation of nitro-orcin .
6 grms. of colourless orcin were dissolved in 6 cub. centims. of boiling water , and when the solution had cooled to about 50 ' C. , it was added in small portions at a time , and with constant stirring , to 40 cub. centims. of nitric acid , sp. gr. 1*45 , which was maintained at a temperature of about \#151 ; 10 ' C. by immersion in a good freezing-mixture .
The solution , which was of a very pale brown colour , was now added , in a similar manner , to 120 cub. centims. of concentrated sulphuric acid , also maintained at \#151 ; 10 ' C. The pasty mass , after being allowed to stand for fifteen or twenty minutes in the freezing-mixture , was poured into a beaker containing 300 cub. centims. water and 400 grms. ice ; the crude nitro-compound was then precipitated as a yellow or orange-coloured granular powder .
The orcin employed in the preparation of this nitro-compound was colourless , having been purified by distillation in vacuo .
The yield of crude nitro-orcin amounted to 150 per cent , of the weight of the orcin . .
The crude nitro-orcin was collected , washed with a little cold water , and purified by one or two crystallizations from boiling water ( 40 parts ) .
It was thus obtained in large yellow needles , which are readily soluble in hot water and but slightly in the cold ; the addition of a strong acid precipitates almost the whole of the nitro-orcin from its cold aqueous solution .
It is soluble in alcohol , very soluble in hot benzol , and crystallizes out in great part on cooling ; it is less soluble in ether , and but moderately so in bisulphide of carbon .
It dyes the skin yellow , like picric acid , but is tasteless .
It volatilizes slightly at 100 ' C. , melts at 162 ' C. , and decomposes with slight explosion immediately afterwards .
When heated with concentrated sulphuric acid it dissolves , forming a deep yellow solution , which deposits crystals on cooling , and is immediately precipitated by water .
It dissolves in hot strong nitric acid with evolution of nitrous fumes and formation of oxalic acid .
Like picric acid , when treated with calcium hypochlorite it yields chloropicrin at the ordinary temperature .
Its aqueous solutions are coloured dark brown by ferric chloride , and completely precipitated by lead subacetate .

It is a powerful acid , much resembling picric acid , but distinguished from the latter by the greater solubility of its salts .
I propose , therefore , to call this new substance trinitro-orcinic acid .
Potassium trinitro-orcinate.\#151 ; This was readily prepared from trinitro-orcinic acid by dissolving it in a warm and rather concentrated solution of potassium carbonate .
On cooling it solidified to a crystalline mass of fine needles of a deep orange colour , which after the removal of the mother-liquors by the vacuum filter , or by pressure , was purified by crystallization from hot water , in which it was very soluble .

Ammonium trinitro-orcinate was prepared by adding trinitro-orcinic acid to moderately strong ammonia , in quantity insufficient to neutralize it , boiling for a short time , and then setting aside to crystallize .
It forms deep-yellow silky needles , which are very soluble in water , but much less so in alcohol .

Barium trinitro-orcinate.\#151 ; Trinitro-orcinic acid was dissolved in 400 or 500 parts of boiling water and an excess of barium carbonate added , the pale yellow solution filtered from the excess of carbonate and set aside .
On cooling , the solution formed a semisolid crystalline pap , consisting of fine bright yellow needles of the barium salt .

It is but slightly soluble in hot alcohol ; and the solution forms a gelatinous mass on cooling .
Magnesium trinitro-orcinate is very soluble in cold water , but less so in spirit .
It crystallizes in minute orange needles .
Lead trinitro-orcinate.\#151 ; This salt was prepared by dissolving the pure trinitro-orcinic acid in 1000 parts of water strongly acidulated with acetic acid , and adding a solution of lead acetate likewise strongly acidulated , when the lead trinitro-orcinate came out as a bright yellow crystalline precipitate , consisting of tufts of microscopic needles , which are very tough and difficult to reduce to powder .
It is almost insoluble in cold water , slightly soluble in hot .
It is solubie in hot acetic acid , from which it crystallizes unaltered .
It is insoluble in alcohol .
If alcoholic solutions of trinitro-orcinic acid and lead acetate be mixed , the lead-salt is obtained as a yellow amorphous precipitate .

Zinc trinitro-orcinate , formed from zinc oxide in a similar manner to the copper salt , is likewise very soluble in water and alcohol , and crystallizes in tufts of yellow needles .
Silver trinitro-orcinate.\#151 ; Trinitro-orcinic acid was dissolved in fifty times its weight of boiling water , an excess of silver oxide added , and , after boiling a few minutes , filtered from the undissolved silver oxide .
On cooling , the whole solidified to an orange-red gelatinous mass of the silver compound , which exhibited no signs of crystallization .
It is moderately soluble in hot water ; and its solution gelatinizes on cooling .
When boiled for any length of time its solution slowly decomposes .

Methyl trinitro-orcinate was prepared in a manner precisely similar to that above described , substituting methylic for ethylic iodide .
Like the ethyl compound , it forms bright yellow crystals , which , however , have a somewhat higher melting-point , viz. 69'*5 C. Trinitro-resorcinic Acid .
As it seemed important to ascertain if the homologues of orcin yielded compounds similar to trinitro-orcin , I submitted resorcin to the action of nitric and sulphuric acids in a manner precisely similar to that above described for the preparation of trinitro-orcin .
The resorcin employed was prepared from Galbanum by the excellent method given by its discoverers , Hlasiwitz and Barth* , substituting , however , sodium hydrate for potassium hydrate .
After purification it was treated with nitric and sulphuric acids , employing the proportions and methods detailed in the preparation of trinitro-orcin .
As might have been expected , the yield of crude substance was larger , being 180 percent , of the resorcin employed .
It was collected , washed with cold water , and purified by one or two recrystallizations from boiling water ( 30 parts ) .
It is of a paler colour than the corresponding orcin compound , and crystallizes in leafy plates .
It melts at a higher temperature , viz. 175'*5 C. , and is more soluble than trinitro-orcin ; 156 parts of water dissolve one of trinitro-resorcin at 14 ' C. , but the presence of even a small proportion of one of the stronger acids renders it almost insoluble .

Barium trinitro-resorcinate was prepared by dissolving trinitro-resorcin in 100 parts boiling water and adding an excess of baric carbonate .
The filtered solution , on cooling , deposited the barium compound in minute rhomboidal plates of a pale yellow colour .
It is much more soluble than the corresponding trinitro-orcin compound .
The crystals contain three equivalents of water of crystallization , which they do not lose at 100 ' C. ; but when gently heated on platinum foil they assume an orange-red colour from the loss of water of crystallization , and at a higher temperature explode with extreme violence , perforating the foil .
Both trinitro-orcinic and resorcinic acids and their salts explode with far greater violence than picric acid and its compounds .
A barium determination of the nitro-resorcinate , dried at 100 ' , yielded the following results :\#151 ; I. *409 grm. substance gave *220 grm. baric sulphate .

Subacetate of lead completely precipitates solutions of trinitro-resorcinic acid .
Silver trinitro-resorcinate.\#151 ; This was prepared in a manner similar to the trinitro-orcinate .

On cooling , the silver-salt was deposited in long fine needles of a yellowish-brown colour .
