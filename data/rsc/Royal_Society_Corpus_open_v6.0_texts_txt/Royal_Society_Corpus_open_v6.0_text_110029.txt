On the Changes which have taken place in the Declination of some of the principalfixed Stars .

] The objects of this communication are chiefly two ; the first is to restore a greater degree of confidence in the results of the late observations made with the mural circle at Greenwich , which now appear to have been subjected to a very small error only , arising from some temporary causes now very effectually removed ; and the second to point out a want of uniformity in the proper motions of almost all the stars , which is of such a nature as to indicate a slow change of place towards the south in almost every instance , with the exception of y Ursae majoris , i Urswe minoris , and 3 Cephei only .
The greatest deviation is found in three very bright stars , Capella , Procyon , and Sirius .
The proper motion of each of these is southward ; hence these proper motions are accelerated , while that of Arcturus , on the contrary , may be considered as uniform .
The author observes , that though the number of stars which have proper motions northwards is nearly equal to those of which the proper motion is southward , yet the joint magnitude of the motions southward exceeds that of the motions directed northwards nearly in the proportion of 4 to 1 .
It was not till after February , 1821 , that the mural circle became completely out of repair ; its present perfection has been verified by means of observations made with an artificial horizon of mercury protected by wooden boxes , of different sizes and figures according to the different altitudes of the stars : at the same time , Mr. Pond observes , that for very delicate purposes it would be improper to place implicit confidence in the observations of declination made in the course of the year 1820 .
