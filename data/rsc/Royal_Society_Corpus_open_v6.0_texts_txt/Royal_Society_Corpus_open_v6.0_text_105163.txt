An Account of the Barometer , and the State of the Weather , at Dublin , from the 7 of March 1752 , to the 28 of February 1753 , by James Simon , Esquire , F. R. S. and Secretary of the Incorporated Society at Dublin : Communicated by Mr. Henry Baker , F. R. S. Dear Sir , Dublin , Sept. 4 , 1753 .
I NOW send you my journal of the weather for the last year , from the 7 of March , 1752 , to the 28 of February , 1753 .
You will , perhaps , find it too minute ; but whatever fault you find in it shall be rectified for the future , if you are so kind as to let me know , how I should proceed to render it useful .
Deal with me as a friend ; inform me of my mistakes ; and if you do not think it deserves to be laid before the Royal Society , I beg you will not let it be seen ; if otherwise , you have my leave to lay it before them .
My chief ambition would be to deserve their approbation and esteem : of this you may assure them , and of my sincere respect and regard .
Read Nov. 15 , 1753 .
I have observed , that the friction is so great in the common barometer , by the smallness of the tube , that I wrote to London for a larger tube .
It is something more than one quarter of an inch clear in the bore ; and it took me two pounds and a quarter of clean purified mercury to fill it .
The cistern , which receives the mercury , is pretty large , with a wide mouth ; and is covered with a silk gauze , besides the usual wooden cover , to prevent any dust from falling into the quicksilver .
In such a tube the friction is much less ; and I can observe the most sudden change in the weather , even to an 80 part of an inch ; tho ' in my journal I only set down a 40 part .
For example , March 12 , 1752 , at night , 29 14 1/ 2 , is 29 inches 14 1/ 2 twentieth parts and a half of an inch , or 29/ 40 parts .
I am , Dear Sir , Your most humble servant , James Simon .
