( Abstract .
) In this paper the author continues his account of the properties of phyllocyanin , one of the products of the action of acids on chlorophyll .
He shows that by passing a current of COj through an alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin holding oxide of zinc in suspension , a compound is obtained containing zinc and carbonic acid , a phyllocyanin zinc carbonate resembling phyllocyanin zinc acetate , but that no analogous compounds containing iron or copper are formed in this way .
Attention is directed to the points of resemblance between the double compounds of phyllocyanin containing zinc and chlorophyll itself , particularly as regards their susceptibility to ohange when exposed to the action of air and light , and it is shown that while 466 Mr. J. E. Green .
Changes in the Proteids in the [ Dec. 16 , these compounds when in solution lose their colour almost as rapidly as chlorophyll itself , those containing copper are remarkably stable , since their solutions may be exposed for many weeks to light and air without undergoing any apparent change .
The products derived from phyllocyanin by reduction are next described .
The action of tin and hydrochloric acid on phyllocyanin passes through two distinct stages .
During the first stage a colouring matter is formed which is remarkable from its solutions showing no less than eight absorption bands .
The product formed during the next stage of the process is interesting from its yielding solutions of a bright red colour without any tinge of green , and from its resembling in some respects the colouring matters of red flowers .

( Abstract .
) The processes of the germination of the seed have been in recent years investigated by v. Gorup-Besanez , who in a series of papers written in 1874 and 1875 , * has stated that the changes in the reserve proteid materials are probably due to the action of a proteolytic ferment , as from the seeds of the vetch , hemp , flax , and barley plants he was able to extract a body which converted fibrin into peptone .
Later , in 1878 , Krauchf disputed v. Gorup-Besanez 's conclusions , and claimed that his results were erroneous on account of imperfect methods of working .
As v. Gorup-Besanez based his statement partly on the detection of peptone by the biuret test after the digestion had gone on for some time , and partly on a diminution of the fibrin , Krauch explained his results by saying that the digestive extract itself gave a biuret reaction , and that the diminution of the fibrin was only due to a shrinkage of its flocks .
During the past year I have been carrying out a series of experiments bearing upon this disputed point , and have succeeded in demonstrating in the seeds of the lupin ( ) the existence of such a ferment as v. Gorup-Besanez stated to be present , and in ascertaining some particulars as to its condition in the resting seed , the nature and conditions of its action , and the changes which * ' Deutsch .
