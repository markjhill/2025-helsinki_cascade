183 portion of the time , so that the magnitude of the " wabble " would be reduced by the friction of the 306-day tide ; for we are by no means compelled to believe that that inequality of motion must always have remained as small as it is at present .
It appears to me , from these considerations , that the continents of Europe and Asia might have been elevated in very much less than 20,000 years , and yet leave no record of the fact in the present motion of the earth .
Therefore , if my solution of the problem is correct , it is certain that Professor Haughton 's method can give us no clue to the times which have elapsed in the geological history of the earth .

" Some Experiments on Conductive Properties of Ice , made in Discovery Bay , 1875\#151 ; 6 .
" By Staff Surgeon R. W. Coppinger , M.D. Communicated by Professor Tyndall , F.R.S. Received February 21 , 1878 .
In attempting a series of experiments for determining the rate of conduction of heat through sea and fresh-water ice , I have endeavoured as closely as possible to follow the suggestions made by Professor Tyndall in page 84 of the " Scientific Instructions for the Arctic Expedition .
" With this view , I have constructed the simple apparatus shown in the diagram .
It consists of a wooden baseboard ( F F ) , 29 inches in length by 9 in breadth , on which are fixed two upright 184 Dr. R. W. Coppinger on [ Mar. 14 , wooden battens ( NM ) , standing 24 inches apart , and connected above by a light crosspiece ( 00 ) .
In the upright battens , at 4 inches above their bases , are apertures inches square , for the reception of the bar of ice ( AA ) on which the experiment is made , while a series of thermometers ( DDDD ) -are placed 4 inches apart , secured above to the crosspiece ( 00 ) , and having their bulbs imbedded in the icebar below .
For the manufacture of ice-bars I had constructed a strong copper tube , 29 inches long by inches in sectional area , from which on being filled with water , and exposed to a low temperature , bars of fresh or sea-water ice were obtainable .
The removal of these bars from the mould was effected by the application of warm water to the outside of the tube , which , melting the surface of the ice-bar , allowed it to be extracted .
The ice-bar , being placed in position , projects , when of its full length , 5 inches beyond the upright batten ( M ) , as shown in the figure .
\ Below the projecting end is placed a spirit-lamp ( B ) , fitted with a sheet-iron plate ( C ) , curved in such a manner as to prevent the bare flame from touching the ice , and to divert the drops of melted ice from the wick of the lamp .
This lamp can be so placed that its heat will bear pretty accurately on the under surface of the bar at either 2 , 3 , or 4 inches as desired from M. The thermometers being placed at ' intervals of 4 inches apart , their distances from the source of heat are respectively 6 , 10 , 14 , and 18 inches when the lamp is 2 inches from the upright .
Their bulbs are sunk in holes bored in the ice , and are packed in with powdered ice , so as to render the connexion with the bar as perfect as possible without incurring the risk of the instruments being broken .
At all low temperatures the instruments used were Hick 's spirit thermometers .
Although these instruments were supplied to the ship as of good reputation , their errors at temperatures below \#151 ; 10 ' differed so much in each instrument for every few degrees of the scale , that I found it best in recording the rate of heat-flow along the ice-bar to take the temperature actually indicated by each thermometer uncorrected , and .
to note the range of temperature in each , assuming that its error for every two or three degrees , at all events , was uniform .
In the earlier experiments I noted the temperature every 5 minutes for about 2 hours , beginning 5 minutes after the lamp had been lighted ; but finding that interval too small to show any decided difference in temperature , I had recourse to 10-minutely , and ultimately to 15-minutely intervals .
The entire duration of each experiment was limited to one hour , as by that time so much of the projecting end of the bar had melted away as to lessen the influence of the lamp upon it .
In order to determine whether the rise in temperature indicated by the thermometers might be to any extent-due to radiation of heat from the lamp rather than to conduction through the ice-bar , the thermo- 1878 .

meter YY was placed on the inner side of the upright M , having its bulb exposed to the air and 5 inches distant from the lamp .
Having found from experiments I and II that a certain amount of radiation really existed , a broad screen , composed of layers of lint and pasteboard , was placed against the outer side of the upright M , and perforated , so as to closely encircle the bar in its passage through .
This screen was used in III and subsequent experiments .
In order to be free from draughts , and yet to be in a place of low and pretty uniform temperature , the observations were made in a closed-in ice-building on the floe ( that which was used as a theatre ) , and the temperatures of the external air and of the air inside the building were on each occasion noted .
It was found that whenever the temperature in the open air was below \#151 ; 20 ' F. , the temperature inside the building was about 10 ' warmer ; this difference being accounted for by the heat conveyed through the floe from the sea-water beneath .
From a mean of five experiments on fresh-water ice it appears that in one hour from the time when heat was applied , the temperatures at the distances of 6 , 10 , 14 , and 18 inches from the source of heat had risen 4'-45 , 1'*78 , 1''30 , and 0''25 , respectively .
This result furnishes a rough method of estimating the absolute rate of conduction .
It would have been more satisfactory if in all cases the observations could have been continued until the thermometers indicated fixed temperatures , but this was impracticable from the thawing of the end of the ice-bar ; and if but a very moderate heat had been applied , the changes in temperature would have been hardly appreciable .
In most cases but little change in temperature took place after the hour had elapsed , and in the case of experiment VIII , when a series of observations extending over two hours was carried out , the thermometer indicated no material change in temperature throughout the second hour .
Table VI gives the results of a series of observations upon a bar of sea-water ice , the rise in temperature being respectively 4 ' , 2 ' , 1''5 , and 1,05 .
It will be seen that in Tables I , II , and III , the temperatures indicated by thermometer YY are given , and that in I and II its ranges of temperatures are respectively 4 ' and 2''5 .
In III the screen to prevent radiation was used , and every precaution was taken that the temperature of the ice-house might be uniform throughout the course of the experiment .
In this case thermometer YY shows a rise in first hour of only 0''25 .
To exhibit this more clearly Table VIII ( the first half of which is only a repetition of Table III ) is given , when the results of observations extending over two consecutive hours are recorded ; and from which it appears that the ice thermometers indicated almost fixed temperatures from the end of the first hour .
The temperature of 186 Dr. R. W. Coppinger on [ Mar. 14 , the house varied but half a degree during the course of the experi .
ment , and the thermometer YY showed a rise of only 0''75 , which is small when -compared with its short distance ( 5 inches ) from the flame .
The results , therefore , afforded by Table VIII may be consi-dered highly satisfactory .
I refrain from making any general observations or drawing any* special conclusions as to the subject of this paper , but simply submit the above few observations with the hope that in abler hands than mine , the facts which they contain may be made to add something to our knowledge of the conductive properties of ice .

" On the Function of the Sides of the Vessel in maintaining the State of Supersaturation .
" By Charles Tomlinson , F.R.S. Received February 21 , 1878 . .
Before any consistent theory can be framed of all the phenomena of supersaturated saline solutions , it is necessary to determine whether the sides of the vessel bear any , and what part , in maintaining the state of supersaturation .
It is remarkable that among the multitude of memoirs and papers that have been published on the subject of supersaturation generally , and of special phenomena in particular , my reading should not have made me acquainted with any special experimental researches con- ' ducted with the view of determining the point in question .
In 1819 , Gay-Lussac* seeing how easily a supersaturated solution of sodic carbonate can be made to solidify , by merely shaking the vessel , expressed his opinion that the state of supersaturation depends , not on a chemical , but a purely mechanical force .
" We cannot , " he says , " fix the point at which supersaturation ends , since it is entirely accidental in each experiment , depending , as it does , on the nature of the vessel , its polish , its conducting power , and the agitation of the air .
" In 1851 Lamyf arrived at the conclusion that the form , thickness , and nature of the vessel , and the quantity of solution contained therein , have no influence on the state of supersaturation .
