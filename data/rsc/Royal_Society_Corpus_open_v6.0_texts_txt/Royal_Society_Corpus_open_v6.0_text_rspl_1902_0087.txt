( From the National Physical Laboratory .
) I have been engaged during the last two years on an analysis of the magnetic results obtained at Kew Observatory ( now the National Physical Laboratory ) , during an 11-year period , 1890 to 1900 .
The work has been much interrupted , and is still incomplete .
Amongst the points dealt with is the inter-relationship between sun-spot frequency and magnetic phenomena , and , as this has recently been engaging attention elsewhere , I have decided to put certain of my results on record at once .
It has long been known from the researches of Balfour Stewart , Ellis , and others , that there is a close connection between the times of occurrence of greatest sun-spot frequency and largest amplitude of the diurnal inequality of magnetic declination and horizontal force .
I have investigated whether the numerical relationship between the phenomena can be adequately represented mathematically in a simple way .
A convenient basis for the investigation was presented by the publication by Professor Cleveland Abbe in the ' U.S. Monthly Weather Review , ' for November , 1901 , of a table of sun-spot frequencies as calculated by Wolf and Wolfer for a very long series of years .
After I had carried out all the calculations , Wolfer himself published a similar table* embodying his latest corrections .
The differences from Abbe 's table are trifling , and mainly confined to two years ( 1891 and 1892 ) .
I judged it best , however , to revise the whole of my arithmetic , so as to employ Wolfer 's own most approved figures .
In the following remarks S represents Wolfer 's value for the sun-spot frequency .
The above-mentioned table gives the mean S for each month and for each year .
The magnetic quantity selected for comparison is the mean monthly " range , " meaning thereby the difference between the greatest and # ' Met .

with a and b constants .
I grouped together the 11 Januarys , the 11 Februarys , and so on , of the 11-year period , and determined a and b by least squares for each of the resulting 12 groups .
There being only 11 years ' data , the calculated values doubtless are appreciably affected by quasi-accidental irregularities , but there is so striking a resemblance between the more conspicuous features of .the results found for the declination , inclination and horizontal force as to justify the conclusion that the phenomena are bond fide .
Full particulars will be given later .
At present it will suffice to record the mean values found for the a and b of the formula for three groups of months -\#151 ; viz.:\#151 ; \#187 ; Winter , comprising November to February , Equinox " March , April , September , October , and Summer " May to August .

During the eleven years dealt with , Wolfer 's mean monthly values for S varied from 0*3 to 129-2 , the mean being 41 -7 .
To bring out more clearly .the similarity of the results for the declination , inclination and horizontal force , I have represented the mean value of b for the 12 months in each element by 100 .
The corresponding values for the three seasons are , then , as follows :\#151 ; Table II .

] between Sun-spots and Terrestrial Magnetism .
223 In obtaining these figures I have retained a figure in the value of b beyond that recorded in Table I. Tables I and II will suffice to bring out one of the most important points established , viz. , that b is certainly different from one month to another , and is , for all the elements except the vertical force , dpcidedly larger at the equinoxes ( more especially it would appear at the spring equinox ) than at other seasons .
This means that the equinoxes are the seasons at which the amplitude of the diurnal inequality , when considered absolutely , is most dependent on the sun-spot frequency .
When we take into account , however , the difference between the ranges of the diurnal inequalities at different seasons of the year , we find that winter is the season when sun-spot frequency is relatively most important .
This will be recognised on reference to Table III , remembering that a represents the range corresponding to a total absence of sun-spots , while a + 4T7 bis the range corresponding to a sun-spot frequency of 41 *7 , this being , as already mentioned , Wolfer 's mean value for the 11 years in question .

A recent interesting paper by Rajna* shows that the idea of a linear relationship between diurnal magnetic range and sun-spot frequency has already been applied by at least two previous investigators , Iiajna and Wolfer .
They seem , however , to have applied it only to mean annual values , and to have considered declination only .
Rajna , dealing with declination data , observed at Milan over the long period 1836 to 1901 , applies a formula of type ( 1 ) to what he calls the " medie annuali dell ' escursione diurna .
" The value he finds for b is 0 , -047 .
He mentions that in an earlier similar investigation , including declination data from several stations , Wolfer obtained the value 0'-040 .
I am uncertain as to the precise meaning of Rajna 's " medie annuali , " but it certainly is not quite the same thing as the mean range in Table I , so that the results are not absolutely comparable .

224 Sun-spots and Terrestrial Magnetism .
[ Dec. 18 Another recent and able paper bearing on the subject appears in the last published volume of the French Bureau Meteorologique , which has just come into my hands .
The author , Mr. Alfred Angot , has anticipated me in applying a formula of type ( 1 ) to the individual months pi the year .
but he treats of the amplitude , not of the diurnal range as a whole , but of that of the coefficients of the several terms of the Fourier 's series into which the diurnal inequality can be analysed .
The paper treats only of the declination\#151 ; dealing with data from ordinary days at Parc St.-Maur , Greenwich and Batavia\#151 ; but the author expresses his intention of considering in the future the horizontal force .
A special feature of the present investigation is that the magnetic data are derived exclusively from magnetic quiet days .
This suggests at once a query and a criticism , a query as to why one did not employ corresponding sun-spot data confined to the magnetically quiet days , a criticism that as the two sets of data employed do not absolutely correspond , the comparison actually made may be misleading .
As to the query : Wolfer , it is true , publishes at regular intervals in the \#163 ; Met .
Zeitschrift ' provisional sun-spot frequencies for each day .
These figures are , however , presumably inferior in certainty to the final figures he has embodied in his table after consulting all available sources of information .
The vital consideration , however , is that at certain seasons of the year there are a number of days for which , owing to the absence of observations , Wolfer has no provisional sun-spot data .
With information lacking for two or three out of the five quiet days of a month there would have been a very undesirable amount of uncertainty .
As to the criticism , it would be difficult to meet it if it could be held that the enhanced magnetic activity existing at the earth 's surface at times of sun-spot maxima is due directly to electrical disturbances in the sun , each disturbance being limited to regions where sun-spots exist , and only those disturbances being effective which happen to be at the moment on the half of the sun visible from the earth .
At present I shall only mention the following fact:\#151 ; I had monthly sun-spot frequencies calculated from W offer'sfigures , employing only the five " quiet " days selected for each month by the Astronomer Royal .
The mean sun-spot frequency thence deduced for the eleven years ( 1890 to 1900 ) differed from the corresponding result given by all Wolfer 's days by less than one-fifth of 1 per cent. It is hardly necessary to point out that this fact has an important bearing , not only on the point immediately under consideration , but also on the further question as to the true nature of the connection between sun-spots and magnetic storms .
