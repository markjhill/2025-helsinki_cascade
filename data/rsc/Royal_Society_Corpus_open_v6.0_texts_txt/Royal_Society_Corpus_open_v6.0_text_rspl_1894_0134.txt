I must beg leave at the outset to acknowledge the valuable aid of my Assistant , Mr. R. B. Moris , F.C.S. , in the present inquiry .
An investigation of this kind , necessitating much consideration , can only be carried to a successful issue by arguments and discussions , and to Mr. Moris much credit is due for the light these discussions have shed on the inquiry ; I feel also indebted to him for the care he has bestowed on the numerous analyses he has made for me , and for the accuracy with which-his work has invariably been done .
From a general view of the function of respiration it follows that there are four fundamental forms of breathing ; their characters are the following 1st .
Normal breathing in the state of repose\#151 ; a regular succession of the respiratory movements , involuntary , unattended with fatigue , and leaving an approximately unchanged balance between the C02 in store , in the blood , and the C02 expired .
2nd .
Forced breathing\#151 ; a voluntarily increased thoracic expansion , brought about by the contraction of muscles differing more or less from those in common use in respiration and attended with fatigue .
The expiration of carbonic acid is increased beyond the normal ; * 'Quart .

though not from excessive oxidation , with the exception of a small amount due to the extra work of the respiratory muscles .
3rd .
Respiration underex excise\#151 ; increased volumes of air inspired and expired in a given time with an expiration of C02 in excess of the C02 expired in repose , and unattended with fatigue .
At the same time there occurs an increase of the C02 in store in the blood , which takes place with a certain regularity during the first fifteen or eighteen minutes after exercise has begun , and is irregular afterwards .
This excess of stored up C02 is given out as soon as exercise is followed by repose .
4th .
The fourth form of breathing is under the influence of volition , when exerted in a person 's imagination towards a powerful muscular exertion , while the muscles are in a perfect state of repose .
This form of breathing exhibits the characters of forced respiration and respiration under exercise .
These four different forms of breathing have received special attention , and will , collectively , be found to include every variety of respiration .
They have been recorded graphically in the charts which accompany the present paper .
By means of a drum revolving regularly by clockwork , and of a style at the end of a rod fixed to the summit of the bell-jar into which the air was expired , tracings were obtained on lithographed charts .
The abscissae on the charts indicate the litres of air expired , and the ordinates the minutes through which the experiment was continued .
The air expired was analysed , either for the determination of its C02 alone , or of its C02 , O , and N ; the volume of nitrogen obtained yielded by a simple proportion the volume of air inspired .
I shall now beg to give an account of my inquiry on these different forms of respiration .
ls\#163 ; .
Normal Breathing in the State of Repose .
The methods adopted in the present work have been fully described elsewhere ; as time elapsed improvements were introduced , and this last year the bell-jars used for collecting the expired air , instead of .
being exactly balanced as in former experiments , had their counterpoise charged in such a way as to give a slight ascending motion to the receivers when in free communication with the atmosphere , the speed they acquired being rather less than would be produced by the rush of air owing to the expiratory effort .
Thus , the respiration was unattended with the unconscious strain necessary to raise the bell-jar while perfectly balanced .
This effort , although unnoticed at the time , had a slight tendency to bring on after a while a sensation of fatigue in the respiratory muscles , and probably to increase , though to a very small amount , the volume of On the different Forms of Breathing .
97 C02 expired ; at the same time the percentage of C02 in that air was somewhat greater than might have been anticipated .
The present arrangement made away with that slight defect .
It should be understood that the person under experiment while inspiring through the nose , first expired through a tube into the open air , then by means of three-way stop-cocks was placed in communication with either of the three bell-jars , used in these experiments ; thus , the bell-jar only began ascending when the air was expired , while , during the period of inspiration , the mouth-piece retained in the mouth entirely checked any ascending tendency of the receiver .
This last season ( 1893-94 ) , both I and Mr. Floris submitted to experiment for the determination of our carbonic acid expired and oxygen absorbed ( not given out as COa ) in the state of repose .
In my case eleven experiments were made from 2 hours to 2 % hours after luncheon ( chop , potatoes , and bread ) , while four others were undertaken within 1 hour and 5 minutes after lunch .

From these two series of experiments it will be observed that less CO2 is expired during the first hour after a meal than from 2 to 2-j hours , but there is considerably more oxygen absorbed within the first hour than from 2 to 2\ hours after the ingestion of food , the proportion of 54'4 c.c. to 37 c.e. is a clear indication that such is the case* Dr. W.

There are fifteen of the former and twelve of the latter .
The experiments after lunch show more C02 expired than those made after breakfast , and considerably more 0 absorbed , the figure for the mean volumes of oxygen absorbed being 40'5 c.c. after luncheon , and only 22'4 c.c. after breakfast .
If we now compare with each other the present series of experiments made individually for each of us , it will be seen that in those undertaken at a mean time of 2 to 2hours after luncheon , the ratio of O consumed to C02 produced is all but exactly the same , these figures being 0'839 in my case and 0,840 in that of Mr. Floris .
Moreover , if the whole of the experiments on Mr. Floris be taken into account , including those after luncheon and after breakfast , the respiratory ratio will be 0'862 , which is all but exactly the figure I formerly obtained for myself , 0864 ( means fasting and under food ) , and near to the figure for a former assistant , 0875 , these results agreeing closely with the ratio given by Messrs. Jolyet Bergonie et Sigalas , 0864 , and by Mr. 0 .
Speck , 0869 .
While in the experiments reported in my last paper , the volume of oxygen consumed in a certain time was nearly the same for each individual person ( one excepted ) under similar physical circumstances , in the present instance there is a variation between the volumes of oxygen consumed , the extreme difference amounts in my case to 47*6 c.c. , in that of Mr. Floris to 30 c.c. per minute .
Moreover , we no longer observe , as formerly , that the oscillations in the figures for carbonic acid expired , and corresponding oxygen absorbed vary in a measure inversely to each other .
After giving the question a full consideration , I have come to the conclusion that this is due to the method of collecting the air expired .
In the former experiments this air was expired into a bell-jar perfectly balanced under atmospheric pressure , while in the present instance the air was Mr. Moris under Experiment .

MtffCBt , ioo expired into bell-jars with weighted counterpoise , as previously explained .
With the balanced bell-jar there was a slight amount of work done which gave the breathing a degree of steadiness wanting with the counterpoise weighted ; in the former experiments the very slight , though imperceptible , effort to raise the bell-jar gave regularity to the respiratory function .
It must be recollected that during the day time , sitting perfectly quiet in an arm-chair , from a quarter of an hour to an hour , is altogether unnatural in ordinary life .
We are always in a state of activity , and therefore the slight effort to raise the balanced bell-jar is perhaps more consistent with the ordinary functions of life than breathing perfectly freely , doing practically no work , indeed breathing much as we do at night in bed and during sleep .
I therefore believe that the irregularity in the present figures obtained for the composition of expired air does not militate in any way against my former conclusion .
The next subject for our consideration will be Forced Breathing , Let us follow the different stages of this form of respiration .
The person under experiment is resting in the recumbent posture and perfectly still , he then takes a succession of deep nasal inspirations while expiring through the mouth into one of the bell-jars .
After a certain time , say one , two , or three minutes , he suddenly relapses into natural automatic breathing , and then observes that bis respiration subsides for a few seconds into a pause or state of apncea ; by degrees it returns , shallow and feeble , and then fuller , increasing beyond the normal .
If the apnoea has been great , the increase is well marked , but if comparatively slight the increase may be only just perceptible .
These characters are invariably met with in every instance of " forced breathing " and are clearly shown .by the tracings recorded in the charts .
The phenomenon may be conveniently illustrated by means of the following diagram\#151 ; The horizontal line AA represents normal respiration , the curve AB the line of forced breathing , the curve BC the collapse in the respiration or apnoea , and gradual return to normal , * which it exceeds in CD , reaching finally the normal in D. With reference to the respiratory changes in these three successive stages:\#151 ; In the forced period , or from A to B , much more C02 is * This return to normal only concerns the C02 , the O absorbed takes a longer time to recover .

101 found to be given out of the blood than can be accounted for by the oxygen consumed , or , in other words , the volume of air expired exceeds in a marked degree the volume of air inspired .
Where can the excess of C02 come from ?
It is evidently due to an emission from the blood of a portion of C02 stored up within it .
This view is advocated by 0 .
Speck in his paper , which has been referred to in my last communication .
It will be shown presently that a further and more direct proof of this interesting fact can be experimentally given .
Until tracings of the phenomenon had been obtained on the recording drum , I thought the return to normal respiration was effected at the point C in the diagram , assuming that from B to C the blood recovered its C03 entirely and replenished its store ; but as soon as tracings were obtained it became obvious that the final return to normal breathing failed to take place at 0 , and that the influence of the forced breathing continued to show itself as far as the point D. This influence may appear consistent with the observation of C. Speck , who allies the " after stage " of forced breathing to the " after stage " of breathing under exercise ; but the phenomenon appears to me to be strictly a character of forced respiration , inasmuch as it begins with apncea , passing gradually into slightly increased breathing .
In the following table the C02 entered as expired in forced breathing is the total C02 expired from A to D in the diagram , and includes , therefore , the C02 expired in forced breathing plus the C02 emitted in the stage of apncea and that obtained in the final reaction from C to D ; the whole volume being calculated per minute .
It will be observed that the volumes of C02 in the experiments in forced breathing ( including after stage ) invariably exceed the volumes of C02 obtained in the same lapse of time during rest ; this excess , which is entered in the table for each experiment , must represent the work done per minute in forced breathing .
The mean amount of this work done per minute would be equal to a combustion yielding 62'5 c.c. C02for the author , and 47*5 c.c. C02for Mr. Moris , corresponding to a consumption of carbon of 0034 gram per minute for the author and 0'025 gram per minute for Mr. Moris .
The subject is furthjer developed in the appendix to this paper .
A great deal more C02 is expired in forced respiration independently of the reaction and after stage than in ordinary breathing , and I shall now beg to demonstrate experimentally that this excess of expired C02 is from the store of absorbed C02 in the blood ( with the exception of the small proportion for work done ) and not a product of oxidation .
In order to attain that object , air forcibly inhaled was expired into three different bell-jars in succession , the air being diverted Results of Experiments on Natural Breathing in Repose , and Forced or Laboured Respiration .

]03 from one air holder to another by means of stopcocks ; thus forced air expired in three successive periods of three minutes each was collected without undergoing the slightest loss .
If the excess of C02 expired in forced breathing is really taken from that stored up in the blood , then it will be obvious that the second quantity of forced air expired will contain less C02 than the first , and the third quantity less than the second ; moreover , the difference will be less and less as the experiment progresses , resulting in a curve of a parabolic form * The experiment fully proved the correctness of the theory , three experiments for the author giving the following curves:\#151 ; |3T -*0 *R0 I - Z - 3 - t As tl of air ?

Forced breathing is concerned in sighing , yawning , and sneezing .
Breathing under Muscular Exercise .
The third form of breathing is under muscular exercise when an increased volume of air is breathed and a larger volume of C03 expired than in a state of repose .
It has been shown in my last paper that the mean volume of oxygen , absorbed ( not transformed into C02 ) , at all events within a few minutes ( from 15 to 18 minutes ) after exercise has commenced , is the same as in the state of repose , or nearly so ; this I have confirmed by more recent experiments , which , however , are not included in the present work .
The increased action of the respiratory muscles under exercise is involuntary , unattended with fatigue , and differs in these respects from forced breathing .
Again , in muscular exercise there is no apnoea or reaction after the exercise is arrested ; on assuming a state of repose the breathing continues for a short time much the same as during On the different Forms of Breathing .
exercise , and then gradually returns to the normal .
This " after stage " of muscular exercise is attended with a feeling of breathlessness , due mainly to the C02 accumulated in the blood during exercise .
By increased expansion of the lungs , it soon finds its way into the air inspired , and is thus removed from the blood .
The tracing obtained on the chart for muscular exercise is steeper than that for breathing in the state of repose ; on the person under experiment assuming the recumbent posture in an armchair , the tracing will be observed to be somewhat prolonged , then it straightens , parallel with the tracing for breathing in repose .
In none of these curves are there any signs of the reaction of forced breathing .
Muscular exercise of every kind , including singing , reading , talking , laughing , weeping , gives the same kind of tracing on the chart , though of course more or less steep , as will be seen in the accompanying curves .
But in such kinds of exercise as singing , reading , talking , \amp ; c. , which are not followed by breathlessness , it will be seen that the curve is either not prolonged at all , or but very slightly after the exercise is over , returning quickly to the normal ; and showing that in these cases the C02 is emitted as fast as it is formed , or nearly so , little or none being detained in the blood .
There are passive forms of exercise which also increase the volume of air breathed and produce an excess of carbonic acid , such as friction of the skin , and cutaneous irritation .
On the author 's bare legs being rubbed hard by two persons , the volume of air he expired increased per minute from 3'892 litres to 4*441 litres , and the volume of C02 from 182'6 c.c. to 208*6 c.c. It may be therefore concluded that " shampooing " is really a form of exercise , as it must be productive of increased combustion .
The application of a mustard leaf to each leg , causing a powerful degree of smarting , gave rise to a similar effect on the respiration ; the volume of air breathed was increased per minute in one experiment from 4*719 litres to 5*099 htres , and the C02 from 189*4 c.c. to 226*7 c.c.

It had occurred to me to inquire whether the will without SWWcular exercise was attended with an increased volume of air nient ^ \amp ; n\lt ; ^ a s*nm^aneous excess of C02 expired .
The experi-r , ^as carried out as follows .
The person under experiment the a W^e in the recumbent posture in the deck chair , and instr eX^re^ naturally into the bell-jar connected with the recording rpi f*ei1 ' idm8 a tracing of his normal breathing was obtained .
n e comraenced applying the will as he thought best , either to Dr. W. Mareet .
carry a heavy weight , or to run up hill pursuing another person , or to ride a bicycle up hill , or in any other form , care being taken to keep the muscles absolutely at rest , when the result was invariably an increase in the volume of air expired , as shown in the chart .
On suddenly dropping the influence of the will , and relapsing into the usual state of mind , a slight reaction was visible on the chart re-calling forced breathing .
The line , however , is straighter , and nearly free from the after rise observed in forced breathing , thus exhibiting a slight tendency to the form of curve peculiar to breathing under exercise .
Let us now inquire more closely into the present form of breathing .
The moment the will is applied , as stated above , there is an increase in the volume of air breathed .
What is the reason of this phenomenon ?
It must result from one of two different causes or from both\#151 ; either an increased demand of oxygen by the blood , or the acquired habit of breathing more air while under an exercise which is itself controlled by the will .
The increased action of the respiratory muscles when influenced by an effort of the will is absolutely automatic ; there is no strain , no effort of any kind recalling forced breathing .
Together with a greater volume of air breathed per minute we observe a marked increase of CO2 produced and expired \#151 ; an increase which amounts to a mean of 20*9 c.c. per minute .
These 20'9 c.c. of CO2 can only be due either to increased labour in the act of breathing , or increased combustion from the effect of the will , or to both these causes .
The increased respiratory labour which is unconscious and unattended with fatigue must be very slight , and to my mind cannot account for 20*9 c.c. of C02 per minute ; moreover , if the fact be taken into account that the increased volume of air breathed under an effort of the will points distinctly to a demand of oxygen from the air by the blood , and an increased production of CO2 which has to be emitted , we shall be more and more convinced that volition ( powerfully exerted ) is productive of carbonic acid , f If we now turn our attention to the graphic illustration of breath-ing under a strong exertion of the will , we observe that the apncea is somewhat less marked than in forced breathing , the curve straightening and thus approaching that of respiration under muscular exercise .
Taking into account the whole of the above considerations , it appears to me that we are justified in concluding , as it were from circumstantial evidence , in the absence of direct proof , that oxygen is absorbed and carbonic acid formed in the body from the mental effort of the exertion of the will .
A remark falls from Dr. Vaughan Harley , in a recent paper on " The Value of Sugar and the effect of Smoking on Muscular Work"* in keeping with the foregoing ob-* 'Journal of Physiology , ' 1894 .

serration .
He noticed that if he thought about the exercise to which he was going to apply his fingers , the maximum power was obtained at the very outset .
The reason of this observation is obvious .
The exercise of the will caused him to take into his lungs an increased volume of air , and on that account he was the better prepared for the exercise the moment it was commenced .
Professor Ramsay , of University College , kindly consented to submit to the experiment , and others were made on myself and Mr. Floris .
These experiments all give the same result , that breathing under the influence of the will is a phenomenon attended with an increased volume of air breathed , and a greater volume of carbonic acid expired .

20"9 c.c. The well known interesting experiment of Professor Mosso , of Turin , might be here recorded , which demonstrates in the most conclusive manner that the brain , from fatigue , loses its power to excite muscular contraction ; this experiment also favouring the conclusion that brain work is attended with combustion .
The following is a summary of the present inquiry \#151 ; There are four distinct forms of breathing , which include every variety of respiration .

muscles attended with fatigue and with an expiration of carbonic acid increased beyond the normal .
This , however , is due mainly to the displacement of carbonic acid present normally in the blood , a small proportion of C02 only being the result of the work done by the action of the muscles concerned in the forced respiration .
A. sudden return from forced to normal breathing in repose is attended with ah involuntary double reaction , the first being a respiratory pause , and the second a slight increase of the respiration more or less marked according to the intensity of the first reaction and merging into natural breathing .

Respiration under exercise , exhibiting characters shown in the tracings , and in other respects described in a previous paper .
4 .
Breathing in a state of muscular repose while wider the influence of a strong effort of volition .
The characters of this form of respiration partake of breathing under muscular exercise and of breathing .
Like breathing during exercise , the volume of air respired is increased , and the action of the respiratory muscles is automatic and unattended with any fatigue , while there is an elimination of an increase of C02 .
Like forced breathing , on releasing the influence of the will there is a slight reaction or pause , but it is distinctly less marked than after forced breathing , and the following after stage observed in forced breathing , is barely , if at all perceptible .
From these circumstances it is concluded , though as it were from circumstantial evidence , that volition strongly exerted is productive of the formation of carbonic acid .
The second form of breathing , or forced expiration , includes sneezing , sighing , and yawning .
The third form of breathing , or under exercise , includes what may be called vocal breathing , or reading , talking , singing , weeping , laughing , shouting , and coughing .
In these instances there is but little or no C02 absorbed in the blood as it is given out as the exercise proceeds .
The fourth form of breathing may be considered as including every kind of mental exertion .
Finally , the different forms of breathing may assist or clash with each other .
Thus forced breathing assists breathing under exercise , especially when repose follows exercise .
Forced respiration may clash with vocal respiration as shown by the difficulty experienced in talking or singing immediately after forced breathing .
Appendix .
An explanation is wanted with reference to the production of heat required for the labour of forced breathing .
It might be objected in accordance with the statement of Hirn , in his book on the " Mechani- j On the different Forms of Breathing .
cal Theory of Heat , " that the heat emitted by an animal should be measured by the amount of oxygen consumed , while I look upon this heat as due exclusively to the C02 produced .
The fact contained in my last paper that the mean volume of oxygen absorbed ( not transformed into C02 ) in exercise , is the same as that absorbed in the state of rest , shows clearly that the oxygen absorbed is not concerned in the production of heat necessary for muscular exercise .
By an inspection of the following table , it will be clearly seen that Oxygen absorbed and Carbonic Acid Expired at Rest , Normal and Forced .
