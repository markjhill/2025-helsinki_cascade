The author then details at length the methods by which he effected these comparisons , and gives tables of the various measurements , which are afterwards comprised in the following abstract , taking Colonel Lambton 's standard , used in the survey of India , as the point of departure , in consequence of its being the shortest .
Captain Kater finds the excess on 36 inches to be as follows : Sir George Shuckburgh 's standard ... ... ... . .
+ 000642 Bird 's standard , 1760 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... + 000659 General Roy 's scale ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
+ 001537 Royal Society 's standard ... ... ... ... ... ... ... + 002007 Ramsden 's bar , used in the trigonometrical survey + 003147 The author then proceeds to investigate the effect of these differences on the figure of the earth , and arrives at the conclusion , that the comparison given in the abstract of Colonel Lambton 's paper , in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818 , namely , .
should be s-.-s- , which agrees very nearly with the deduction of M. Laplace from the lunar irregularities ; with the result of Dr. Young 's investigation , by a comparison of the mean with the superficial density of the earth ; and with the conjecture hazarded by the author , from the compression given by the experiments on the length of the pendulum at Unst and Portsoy .
