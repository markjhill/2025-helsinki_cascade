The sphygmographic tracings added by M. Lortet to his temperature-charts seemed to show a great inadequacy of circulation .

" Observations of the Eclipse at Oxford , December 22 , 1870 .
" By John Phillips , M.A. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , Professor of Geology in the University of Oxford .
Received December 28 , 1870 .
At my observatory , situated about one third of a mile eastward from the great establishment founded in the name of Dr. Radcliffe , the beginning of the eclipse was obscured by a passing cloud : the end was recorded at 13h 38 ' 38"= lh 35 ' 0"*9 Oxford mean time .
The progress of the obscuration was observed at unclouded intervals in the Arst half of the period , continuously during a clear sky in the latter half .
Finding it impracticable to observe and measure with ordinary micrometers in the early part of the phenomenon , I arranged to throw the image on a screen , and make my measures on it .
The driving-clock was affected by the extreme cold , so as to make it difficult to keep the sun 's image to one place , and it was convenient for other reasons sometimes to shift the image vertically ; the method which I employed , however , was independent of these displacements , and allowed of as many measurements of the cusps as might be desired .
It consisted simply in marking at any moment with pencil the situation of the cusps on the screen , and appending to each dot the time by the sidereal clock .
Joining , after the eclipse , these dots by a straight line , and then transferring a parallel line of equal length to meet internally a circle representing the limb of the sun , of the same diameter as the solar image , the chord of the cusps at the given time was obtained , from which , by an easy method , the place of the moon 's centre at the moment was derived .
The apparent diameters of the sun and moon were obtained by measure of arcs on the screen . .
' . .
11 The diagrams exhibit the whole process .
In diagram Ag .
1 , four of the lines are drawn from the dots on the screen , A A , B B , C C , D D. In Ag .
2 , equal and parallel lines are transferred to the solar circle , whose centre is S , so as to touch it internally at A ' A ' , B ' B ' , C ' C ' , D ' D'\#171 ; For each of these lines the centre of the moon 's place is marked ( A , B , C , D)\#187 ; thus the line of the motion of the moon 's centre is given , and the phase ot greatest obscuration determined .
\#166 ; .1 The line of motion of the moon 's centre is obtained by ruling through the mid points between A " and B " , B " and C ' , C " and D .
The point on this line reached by the moon 's centre at the moment of greatest o ^ scuration is found by bisection in M. Drawing through M and S the bisecting line of greatest obscuration , the length of the sagitta is deter-- mined .

A 'A ' , B ' B ' , C ' C ' , D ' D ' , are four lines equal and parallel to A A , BB , C C , D D in fig. 1 , and made to touch internally the solar circle , whose centre is S ; m s the sagitta at the moment of greatest obscuration .
The moon 's path passes below A " , above B " , and nearly coincides with O " and D " , which are the places of the moon 's centre for the cusps A ' , B ' , O ' , D ' .
These numbers , according to the proportions given in the Nautical Almanac for the Radcliffe Observatory , would have been:\#151 ; Diameter of the sun ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
530*0 Diameter of the moon ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
538*8 Length of sagitta ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 99*1 The agreement is quite close enough to justify the belief that , in skilful hands , the method described may be in some cases very useful , it being by no means limited to eclipses .
It is so simple that one can hardly suppose it not to have been already employed ; but I have met with nO notice of such being the case .
During the progress of the eclipse three thermometers were observed* One north of the house , screened from the sun and sky , sank from 2G ' at 1 lh 40m to 24'*4 at lh 25m .
One south of the house , indirectly influenced by solar radiation on neighbouring objects , rose from 26'*75 at 1 lh to 27'*8 at noon , then sank to 26 ' at 12h40m , and rose to 27'*3 at lh35m .
A third , on grass open to the sky , sank from 2/ '*8 at 1 lh 40 " to 23'*5 at lh 25m , and remained at this point till lh 35ra .
.Though on a limited scale , the influence both of solar and sky radiation is traceable in these observations .
