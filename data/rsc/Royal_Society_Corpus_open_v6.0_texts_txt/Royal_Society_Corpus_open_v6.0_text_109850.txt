] Dr. Robertson conceives that no full demonstration of these formulah has yet been published ; and hence no one has hitherto remarlted two oversights with respect to their application to certain particular cases , which had escaped the notice of their author .
Their value , however , has been duly appreciated by those most competent to judge of their merit , especially by M. Delambre , who remarks upon their conciseness , as well as precision , in comparison even with the formulae given by Lalande .
