A paper was read , entitled , " A Table facilitating the Compu ?
tations relative to Suspension Bridges .
" By Davies Gilbert , Esq. V.P.R.S. The table here communicated is supplementary to those accompanying the paper " On the Mathematical Theory of Suspension Bridges , " which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826 , and is deduced from the first of the tables there given 5 but admits of a far more ready application than the former to all cases of practical investigation .
It consists of five columns , exhibiting respectively the deflections or versed sines of the curve ; the lengths of the chains ; the tension at the middle points , or apices of the curve ; the tensions at the extremities ; and the angles made by the chains with the horizon at the extremities .
