Various other salts have been examined .
Many that are not very soluble produce no effect at all ; among these may be mentioned potassium nitrate , potassium sulphate , potassium chloride , potassium chlorate , ammonium chloride .
Others , like sodium chloride and sodium nitrate , precipitate globulin completely , but slowly , in simple serum .
Sodium nitrate precipitates serum-albumin completely , but slowly , after saturation with magnesium sulphate .
Sodium nitrate has a very marked effect in lowering the heat-coagulation of a proteid .
Potassium nitrate acts similarly , but not nearly to so great an extent as sodium nitrate .
Puller particulars concerning these various salts will be given when the experiments relating to them are completed .

Mr. H. Tomlinson .
Influence of [ June 19 , experiments on moduli of elasticity and electrical conductivity described in Parts I and II of this paper* was determined in the following manner:\#151 ; The wires , which had been previously well annealed , were wound round a steel rod and so made into coils of length about 2 inches , inner diameter % inch , and outer diameter 1| inches , the rod was then withdrawn and the coil inserted into a thin brass envelope .
The envelope consisted of a hollow cylinder 2 inches in length and 2 inches in diameter , terminated at both ends by a truncated cone .
One of the conical ends was closed and could be unscrewed so as to receive the coil of wire , and was , after the insertion of the coil , screwed on again .
At the other extremity of the envelope was an aperture S inch in diameter , through which a thermometer could be inserted , so that its bulb would lie along the axis and in the centre of the coil of wire .
The brass envelope and the contained coil were heated in an air-chamber consisting of two concentric copper cylinders of equal length connected at their two ends , so as to enclose between them a layer of water \#163 ; inch thick .
The length of the air-chamber thus formed was 14 inches , and the inner diameter 2^ inches , so that the envelope could freely slide through the chamber .
The two ends of the air-chamber , which was placed in a horizontal position , were closed by corks , through the centre of one of which passed a thermometer , and through a very small hole in the centre of the other was drawn a fine but strong thread attached with one extremity to the envelope , and with the other wound round a little piece of wood which prevented the thread from being dragged through the hole when the former was drawn tight .
The envelope and contained wire were heated before immersion in the water of the calorimeter in one set of experiments to about 60 ' 0 .
, and in another set to about 100 ' C. The envelope served a double purpose , as it not only enabled compensation to be made for loss of heat during the transference of the wire from the air-chamber to the calorimeter , but also was of use in distributing the heat uniformly throughout the coil .
Preliminary observations were made for the purpose of ascertaining the rise of temperature which would be caused by immersing the heated envelope only in the water of the calorimeter .
Every precaution was taken both with regard to the instruments themselves and the mode of using them to avoid error , and the formulae given below may be received with great confidence .
It will be seen that the thermal capacity of all the metals examined increased with the temperature , a result which we find confirmed by the observations of other investigators .
The thermal capacities of the alloys platinum-silver , and German-silver are , within the limits of error , exactly the same as those * " Phil. Trans. , " Part I , 1883 , p. 1 .

Thermal capacity is , therefore , a physical property which is not likely to be altered to any appreciable extent by small impurities , so that the results obtained by different experimenters agree very closely with each other .
It has been proved* that if e be taken to denote " Young 's Modulus , " and a. the mean distance between the centres of two adjacent molecules , e x a7 is in the case of most metals approximately a constant .
From this it would follow that the law of force proved by Maxwell in his experiments on the viscosity of gasesf to exist between the molecules of a gas is approximately true for solids , accordingly the force between any two adjacent molecules of a solid is approximately as the fifth power of the distance between their centres .
Now if we denote the atomic mass by A. , the density by A , the thermal capacity per unit mass by Cm , and the thermal capacity per unit volume by C\#187 ; , we have the following relations :\#151 ; Cm xA=a constant ; 0\#174 ; = A x C* j ex \#171 ; 7=a constant ; From these relations we obtain\#151 ; \#151 ; ^-=a constant ; * Loc .

Influence of [ June 19 , or that the cube of " Young 's Modulus " varies as the seventh power of the thermal capacity per unit volume .
This relation was found to hold approximately not merely for the metals here examined , but also in the case of a great many substances for which the values of C\#174 ; and e have been determined by other investigators .
Still more approximately is it believed that this relation would hold good if for " Young 's Modulus " the bulk-modulus of elasticity were substituted .
Denoting the bulk-modulus by ev , it was found that , within the wide limits of error to which determinations of the value of the bulk-modulus are liable to be affected Cy Cvi a constant* Neither of the above relations can be true for all temperatures , inasmuch as whilst the value of ev diminishes with rise of temperature , that of C\#187 ; increases , but at ordinary temperatures it seems that the bulk-modulus of elasticity in grammes per square centimetre can be calculated from the thermal capacity per unit volume by the formula\#151 ; e"=2071X 106C*S The thermal capacity per unit volume increases with the temperature , and the researches of Matthiessen , Fizeao , and others on the one hand , and of Kohlrausch on the other , have shown that there is a like increment in the thermal expansibility and torsionability* of metals .
A careful comparison was made of the various increments above mentioned , and it is shown in the paper that whilst the ratio of increase per unit of expansibility with rise of temperature to corresponding value in the case of torsionabilityf is , within the limits of error of observation , unity , that in which thermal expansibility and thermal capacity are concerned is about two , so that the rate at which thermal expansibility increases with the temperature is about twice the rate at which thermal capacity increases .
The rate of increase of both thermal expansibility and thermal capacity varies with the nature of the metal , being greatest for iron and least for platinum .
The so-called " real thermal capacity " of a solid may be found by dividing the thermal capacity of hydrogen per unit mass at constant volume , , namely , 2'417 , by the atomic mass ; and this part of the capacity will be independent of the temperature .
If the " real capacity " be subtracted from the total thermal capacity we obtain that part of the capacity which does vary with the temperature , and which has therefore in this paper been designated the " variable * The inverse of " simple rigidity .
" + Iron and copper are the only two metals for which the increase of torsionability with rise of temperature has been examined .

Again , should the rate of increase of torsionability prove for all metals , as it is for iron and copper , equal to the rate of increase of expansibility , we shall , by the method of torsional vibrations , be able to determine with any degree of accuracy we please any one of the three rates of increase .
It is shown in the paper that the thermal capacity per unit mass is nearly two 'and a half times the " real capacity , " so that only two-fifths of the whole thermal energy which we may impart to a mass of metal goes towards raising the temperature , the remaining three-fifths being expended in internal and external work .
The external work is practically insensible in ordinary cases .
Of the internal work , that expended against bulk-elasticity amounts in the limiting cases from to ttswo the whole , and , though greater than the external work , is almost insensible ; moreover , there seems to be no relationship whatever between the whole thermal capacity per unit volume and the work done against bulk-elasticity .

According to the researches of the latter the observed thermal effects of longitudinal stress on a wire is to he found by dividing the theoretical thermal effects by 1*61 , since part of the work expended on a wire which is stressed longitudinally finds its equivalent in molecular effects which are not thermal .
This view seems to be partly supported by some experiments made by the author on the viscosity of metals .
V. " Note on Boiling in a Vessel contained in a Water Bath .
" By Charles Tomlinson , F.R.S. Received May 31 , 1884 .
In the " Phil. Trans. " for 1673 , No. 97 , among the " Acta Medica " of Dr : Bartholin , the twelfth is thus stated:\#151 ; " A contrivance of making water not boil in the midst of boiling water , by hanging a narrow-mouth 'd glass , half-full of water , in the midst of an Iron Kettle filled with water ; whereupon the ambient water may by a strong fire be made to boil , when as the water in the glass , though it be hot , yet will not boil at all , though some few babbles be seen at the bottom , which do all vanish before they come to the top .
" v In " Rozier 's Journal " for 1773 , p. 1 , is a* memoir entitled " Experiences et Phenomenes singuliers sir la Communication de la Chaleur , par M. Braun , de l'Academie de St. Petersbourg .
" In this memoir , reference is made to a paper by Olaus Borrichius in the " Memoirs of the Academy of Copenhagen , " entitled " Aqua in medio aquae non ebulliens .
" In M. Braun 's experiments , a copper vessel was filled with water , and another copper vessel , containing water to the height of two-thirds , was placed in it , so that the level of the water in the outer vessel was above that in the inner .
The water in the outer vesst 1 was made to boil violently during upwards of an hour , .
and the water in the small vessel did not show the least sign of ebullition .
It remained in fact 9 ' ( De Lisle 's there .
) below the temperature of the water in the outer vessel .
The experiment was also tried in vessels of glass , earthenware , iron , \amp ; c. , with the same result .
Also with different liquids , such as spirits of wine of various densities , contained in both vessels , when the temperature of the liquid in the smaller vessel was from 4 ' to 12 ' or 13 ' below that in the outer vessel .
With various kinds of wine , the difference was 4 ' or 6 ' ; with milk 7 ' ; and with petroleum from 15 to 20 ' .
These results , the author remarks , form a strange paradox , but may possibly be referred to the fact that the outer vessel is immediately in contact with the source of heat .
