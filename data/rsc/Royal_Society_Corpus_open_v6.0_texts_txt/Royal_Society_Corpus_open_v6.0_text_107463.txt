DEAR SIR , London , June 3 , 1817 .
IN presenting you the result of the following experiments , I trust I shall not be considered as deviating from my subject , in taking a cursory view of the labours of others .
The knowledge of the properties of bodies which come more immediately under our observation , is so instrumental totthe progress of science , that any approximation to it deserves our serious attention .
The passage over a deep and rapid river , the construction of a great and noble edifice , or the combination of a more complicated piece of mechanism , are arts so peculiarly subservient to the application of these principles , that we cannot be said to proceed with safety and certainty , until we have assigned their just limits .
The vague results , on which the more refined calculations of many of the most eminent writers are founded , have given rise to such a multiplicity of contradictory conclusions , that it is difficult to choose , or distinguish , the real from that which is merely specious .
The connections are frequently so distant , that little reliance can be placed on them .
The Royal Society appears to have instituted , at an early period , some experiments on this subject , but they have recorded little to aid us .
EMERSON , in his Mechanics , has laid down a number of rules , and approximations .
Professor ROBIsoN in his excellent treatise in the Encyclopaedia Britannica ; BANKS on the power of machines ; Dr. ANDERSON of Glasgow ; Colonel BEAUFOY , &amp;c. are those , amongst our countrymen , who have given the result of their experiments on wood , and iron .
The subject , however , appears to have excited considerable attention on the continent .
A theory was published in the year 1638 , by GALILEO , on the resistance of solids , and subsequently , by many other philosophers .
But however plausible these investigations appeared , they were more theoretical than practical , as will be seen in the sequel .
It is only by deriving a theory from careful and well directed experiments , that practical results can be obtained .
It would be useless to enumerate the labours of those philosophers , who in following , or varying from the steps of GALILEO , have merely tended to obscure a subject respecting which they had no data to proceed upon .
It is sufficient to enumerate the names of those who , in conjunction with our own countrymen , have added their labours to the little knowledge we possess .
The experiments of BUFFON , recorded in the Annals of the Academy of Sciences at Paris , in the years 174o and 1741 , were on a scale sufficiently large to justify every conclusion , had he not omitted to ascertain the direct and absolute strength of the timber employed .
It however appeared from his experiments , that the strength of the ligneous fibre is nearly in proportion to the specific gravity .
MUSCHENBROECK , whose accuracy ( it is said ) entitled him to confidence , made a number of experiments on wood and iron , which by being tried on various specimens of the same materials , afforded a mean result considerably higher than other previous authorities .
Experiments have 119 also ben made by MAJuOToriE , VARIGNON , PERRONET , RAS RONDELET , GAUTHEY , NAVY .
, AuJBaI and TEXIER DE .
NORBECK , as also , at the Ecole Polytechnique , under the direction .
of M. PRONY , With such authorities before us , it might be deemed presumption in me , to offer you a communicationl on a subject which had been previously treated of by so many able men .
But whoever has had occasion to investigate the principles upon which any edifice is constructed , where the combination of its parts are more the result of uncertain rules than sound principle , will soon find how scanty is our knowledge on a subject so highly important .
The desire of obtaining some approximation , which could only be accomplished by repeated trials on the substances themselves , induced me to undertake the following experiments ; for which purpose I ordered an apparatus to be prepared , of which the two annexed plates [ Plates VI .
and VII .
I are representations .
Description of the Apparatus .
A bar of the best English iron , about io feet long , was selected and formed into a lever ( whose fulcrum is denoted byf ) .
The hole was accurately bored , and the pin turned , which suffered it to move freely .
The standard ( A ) was firmly secured by the nut ( c ) to a strong bed plate of cast iron , made firm to the groind .
The lever was accurately divided in its lower edge , which was made straight in a line with the fulcrum .
A point , or division ( D ) , was selected , at 5 inches from the fulcrum , at which place was let in a piece of hardened steel .
The lever was balanced by the balance weight ( E ) , and in this state it was readyfor operation .
But in order to , keep it as level as possible , a hole was drilled through a projection on the bed plate , large enough to admit a stout bolt easily through it , which again was prevented from turning in the hole by means of a tongue ( t ) fitting into a corresponding groove in the hole .
So that , in order to preserve the level , we had only to move the nut to elevate , or depress the bolt , according to the size of the specimen .
But as an inequality of pressure would still arise from the nature of the apparatus , the body to be examined was placed between two pieces of steel , the pressure being communicated through the medium of two pieces of thick leather above , and below the steel pieces , by which means a more equal contact of surfaces was attained .
The scale was hung on a loop of iron , touching the lever in an edge only .
I at firsL used a rope for the balance weight , which indicated a friction of four pounds , but a chain diminished the friction one half .
Every moveable centre was well oiled .
Of the resistances opposed to the simple strains which may disturb the quiescent state of a body , the principal are the repulsive force , whereby it resists compression , and the force of cohesion , whereby it resists extension .
On the former , with the exception of the experiments of GAUTHEY and RONDELET , on stones , and a few others , on soft substances , there is scarcely any thing on record .
In the memoir of M. LAGRANGE , on the force of springs , published in the year 1760 , the moment of elasticity is represented by a constant quantity , without indicating the relation of this value to the size of the spring : but , in the memoir of the year 1770 , on the forms of columns , where he considers a body whose dimensions and thickness are variable , he makes the moment of elasticity proportional to the fourth power of the radius , in observing the relations of theory and practice to accord with each other .
This was admitted by EULER in his memoir of 1780 , in his elaborate investigation of the forms of columns .
Mr. COULOMB had however shown before that time , how inapplicable all these calculations were to columns under common circumstances ; and you , Sir , have repeated the observation in your lectures on natural philosophy .
The results of experiments have also been equally discordant ; since it is deduced from those of REYNOLDS , that the power required to crush a cubic quarter of an inch of cast iron , is 448ooolbs .
avoirdupois , or 2oo tons ; whereas by the average of thirteen experiments made by me on cubes of the same size , the amount never exceeded logg2.581lbs , not quite five tons.* This may be seen by referring to the tables .
There were four kinds of iron used , viz. ist .
iron taken from the centre of a large block , whose crystals were similar in appearance and magnitude to those evinced in the fracture of what is usually termed gun metal .
2ndly .
Iron taken from a small casting , close grained , and of a dull grey colour .
' rdly .
Iron cast horizontally in bars of -th inches square , 8 inches long .
4thly .
Iron cast vertically , same size as last .
These castings were reduced equally on every side to 4 of an inch square : thus removing the hard external coat usually surrounding metal castings .
They wsere all subjected to a gauge .
The bars were then presumed to be tolerably uniform .
The weights used were of the best kind that could be procured , and as the experiment advanced , smaller weights were used .

The experiments on inch prisms of different lengths give no ratio .
The experiments on j inch cubes , taking an average of the three first in each , give a proportion between them and the three on cubes , as i : 6.096 in the block castings as i : 7.352 in the horizontal ditto as i : 8.035 itn the vertical ditto in several cases the proportion is as the cubes .
The vertical cube castings are stronger than the horizontal cube castings .
e125 The prisms usually assumed a curve similar to a curve of the third order , previous to breaking .
The experiments on the different metals , give no satisfac tory results .
The difficulty consists in assigning a value to the different degrees of diminution .
When compressed beyond a certain thickness , the resistance becomes enormous .
Experiments on the suspension of bars .
The lever was used as in the former case , but the metals were held by nippers , as indicated in the drawing No. 2 .
They were made of wrought iron , and their ends adapted to receive the bars , which , by being tapered at both extremities , and increasing in diameter from the actual section ( if I may so express it ) , and the jaws of the nippers being confined by a hoop , confined both .
The bars , which were six inches long , and square , were thus fairly and firmly grasped .

The ratio of the repulsion of the horizontal cast cubes to the cohesion of horizontal cast bars , is 8.65 : i. The ratio of the vertical cast cubes to the cohesion of the vertical cast bars , is as 9.14 : i. The average of the bars , compared with the cube , No. 16 , is as io.61 : i. The other metals decrease in strength , from cast steel to cast lead .
The stretching of all the wrought bars indicated heat .
The fracture of the cast bars was attended with very little diminution of section , scarcely sensible .
The experiment made by M. PRONY , ( which asserts , that by making a slight incision with the file , the resistance is diminished one half ) was tried on ai inch bar of English iron ; the result was 9gaolbs .
, not a sixth part less .
This single experiment , however , does not sufficiently disprove the authority of that able plhilosopher , for an incision is but a vague term .
The incision I made might be about the 4oth part of an inch .
Experiments on the twist of inch bars .
To effect the operation of twisting off a bar , another apparatus was prepared : it consisted of a wrought iron lever two feet long , having an arched head about I of a circle , of 4 feet diameter , of which the lever represented the radius , the 1X7 centre round which it moved had a square hole made to receive the end of the bar to be twisted .
The lever was balanced as before , and a scale hung on the arched head ; the other end of the bar being fixed in a square hole in a piece of iron , and that again in a vice .
The undermentioned weights represent the quantity of weight put into the scale .

Here the strength of the vertical bars still predominates .
The average of the two taken conjointly , and compared with a similar case of inch bars , gives the ratio as the cubes , as was anticipated .
In the horizontal castings of different lengths , the balance is in favour of the increased lengths ; but in the vertical castings , it is the reverse .
In neither is there any apparent ratio .
In the horizontal castings at 6 inches from the bearing , there is a visible increase , but not so great as when close to the bearing .

Remarks .
In observing the results presented by the preceding table , it will be seen that little dependence can be placed on the specific gravities of stones , so far as regards their repulsive powers , although the increase is certainly in favour of their specific gravities .
But there would appear to be some undefined law in the connection of bodies , with which the specific gravity has little to do .
Thus , statuary marble has a specific gravity above Aberdeen granite , yet a repulsive power not much above half the latter .
Again , hardness is not altogether a characteristic of strength , inasmuch as the limestones , which yield readily to the scratch , have nevertheless a repulsive power approaching to granite itself .
It is a curious fact in the rupture of amorphous stones , that pyramids are formed , having for their base the upper side of the cube next the lever , the action of which displaces the No. 125 i2a6 127 ia8 129 130 131 132 333 134 iga sides of the cubes , precisely as if a wedge had operated between them I have preserved a number of the specimens , the sides of which , if continued , might cut the be iub i the direction of their diagonals .

The ends were loose at 2 feet 8 inches apart as before .
The edge from which the part was intercepted , was lowermost , the weight was applied on the base above , it broke with 11 9 lbs. , whereas , in the other case it bore only 84olbs .
Remarks on the transverse strain .
BANKS makes his bar from the cupola , when placed on bearings 3 feet asunder , and the ends loose , to bear 8,64lbs Now all iy bars were cast from the cupola , the difference was therefore 33lbs .
I adopted a space of 2 feet 8 inches asunder , as being more convenient for my apparatus .
The strength of the different brs all cases being the same , approaches nearly to the theory , which makes the comparative values as the breadths multiplied into the squares of the depths .
The halves of the bars were tried , merely to keep up the analogy .
The bar of 4 inches deep , however , falls short of theory by 365 lbs. It is evident we cannot extend the system of deepening the bar much farther , nor does the theory exactly maintain in the case of the equilateral triangle by 24lbs .
The diagonal position of the square bar , is actually worse than when laid on its side , contrary to many assertions .
The same quantity of metal in the feather edged bar , was not so strong as in the 4 inch bar .
The semi-elliptical bar , exceeded the 4 inch bar , although taken out of it .
The parabolic bar came near it .
The bar made fast-at both ends , I suspect must have yielded , although the ends were made fast by iron straps .
The experiments from EMERSON , on solids of different forms might be made ; but the time and trouble these experiments have already cost , have compelled me to relinquish farther pursuits for the present .
If , however , in the absence of better , they are worthy of the indulgence of the Royal Society , it will not only be a consolation to me that my labours merit their attention , but a farther inducement to prosecute the investigation of useful facts , which , even in the present advanced state of knowledge , will yet admit of addition .
I am , with much respect , GEORGE RENNIE .
Since my return to England , I find that a set of experiments have been undertaken by Mr. PETER BARLOW , of the 135 Royal Military Academy .
They are very interesting , but contain no experiments on the repulsive power of bodies , and consequently , my communication is not altogether superseded , although a space of seven months has elapsed since this was written .
