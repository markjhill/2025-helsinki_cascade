On the Laws of the Rise and Fall of the Sea 's surface during each tide .
By the Rev. W. Whewell , B.D. , F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge .
The materials of the present investigation are five months ' tide observations made at Plymouth ; three months observations made at Liverpool , under the direction of Captain Denham , R.N. ; and twelve months* observations made at Bristol , by Mr. Bunt , by means of his tide-gauge .
According to the theory of the tides , the height of the surface of the water at a given place will increase as the sine , while the time increases as the are .
Hence if the time be made the abscissa , and the height the ordinate , the curve representing one tide would be the figure of signs .
The author on making the com ?
parison of the empirical curve of the rise and fall of the water , deduced from observation , with this theoretical curve , finds a general agreement between them ; subject to certain deviations , consisting principally in the empirical curve indicating that both the rise and the fall are not symmetrical , like the theoretical curve , in consequence of the fall being generally more rapid than the rise , and thus occasioning a displacement of the summit of the curve towards that branch of it which corresponds to the fall .
