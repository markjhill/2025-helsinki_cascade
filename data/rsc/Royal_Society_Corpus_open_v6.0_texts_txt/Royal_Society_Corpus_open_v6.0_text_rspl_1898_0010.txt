1 ( Abstract .
) The nature of the bard polished outer layer of the teeth of this [ I group of fishes has been from time to time a subject of discussion , I some authors holding that it is enamel , whilst others deny its claim | to be so styled .
The author describes its physical , chemical , and histological peculiarities , calling attention to its hardness , its optical properties , \#153 ; its almost entire solubility in weak acids , and to its tubularity , in all ; I of which respects it resembles unquestionably an enamel .
But it contains lacunar spaces , and presents a very distinct lami- | nation , parallel , or nearly so , with its surface , in which respect it is I unlike an enamel .
Still upon the balance of its characters it has much more in | common with enamel than with dentine , from which it is sharply Jl marked off by the entire absence of any collagen basis .
It m also shown that the tubular structure , which may be regarded\#153 ; as typical in these fish , passes by insensible gradations into a simple\#153 ; tissue differing but little from an ordinary enamel ; this is especially\#153 ; the case where the whole layer is thin , as in the Bays .
But the !
study of its development raises the difficulty afresh .
of the Enamel of Elasmohranch Fishes .
55 Each dentine papilla forms upon its surface a specialised layer which is derived from spindle-shaped cells , sending out immensely elongated processes which run nearly parallel with the surface .
There is a large amount of intercellular substance formed so that the iell processes ultimately become inconspicuous , and a lamination or abrillation of this layer only remains ; in this stage it is exceedingly resistant to staining .
The layer is also permeated by cell processes which run through it at right angles to its surface , and these persist .
It is found that this layer is the site of the so-called enamel formation , the first named cell processes giving rise to its lamination , and the last mentioned cell processes giving rise to the tube system which permeates it .
In all mammals dentine calcification commences at the very outside of the dentine papilla , and nothing at all corresponding to this specialised layer exists at any period .
But in the Elasmobranch fishes the calcification of the dentine , whether it be an osteodentine as in Lanina or a fine-tubed dentine as in most others , does not take place at the outer surface of the entire dentinal papilla , but along the deeper side of the specialised layer , thus soon cutting it off from any free communication with the body of the pulp .
This layer , in the extent to which it is developed , bears a ratio to the thickness of the ultimate " enamel .
" Over it lie the columnar epithelial cells of the enamel organ , which present several peculiarities ; they are found to grow to three or four times their original size quite suddenly ; that is to say , on one tooth germ they are small , on the very next they are enormous , and this is the tooth germ in which the specialised layer has attained to its maximum .
Then on the next older germ the ameloblasts have fallen to their original size , and have lost their distinctness of outline .
The great growth of these cells just at one particular stage of tooth development , their subsequent immediate atrophy , and the fact that their length bears also a direct ratio to the thickness of the enamel formed , renders it impossible to suppose that they can be functionless , and it is suggested that they furnish the lime salts for the calcification of the specialised layer of the dentine papilla before alluded to , there being difficulties in the way of supposing that the dentine papilla does so .
In that case the disputed enamel layer of the finished tooth does not correspond precisely either to the enamel or to the dentine of the completed mammalian tooth , but is a joint product of the epiblastic enamel organ and the mesoblastic dentine papilla .
The general conclusion arrived at is that , just as the whole teeth of the Elasmobranchs present the simplest known form of tooth Mr. W. H. Lang .
Apogamy and development , so do they also present the first introduction of ename as a separate tissue .
In its first introduction it was a joint product , made under circum stances which almost precluded any slow and gradual formation ol an outer layer upon the teeth ; but in the further specialisation oi teeth in reptiles and mammals the tooth germs sink more deeply into the submucous tissue , and are protected for a much longer time .
The enamel organs become more specialised , and finally take upon themselves the entire work of enamel building , manufacturing both the organic matrix and furnishing it with lime salts , as unquestionably happens in mammals .
And if these conclusions be correct , it would be quite justifiable to call it enamel , even though the dentine papilla has had a share in its production .
