" Further Observations on the descending fluids of Plants , and more especially the Cambium .
" By George Rainey , Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. The author relates an experiment in proof of the sap descending from the upper to the lower part of an exogenous tree , through vessels which are continuous from the leaves to the roots ; the course of these vessels being shown by the addition of a solution of iodide of potassium after they had taken up by absorption a quantity of a solution of acetate of lead .
The fluids in these vessels are , he con ?
ceives , separated from the sap , which is ascending from the roots , only by the membrane of which they are composed .
When the leaf-buds of a tree are vegetating , large separations are observable between the cells of the bark , and also between the bark and the wood : while no such separations are apparent when the leaf-buds are entirely inactive .
These separations are various in size , and irregular in form ; their parietes consist of rows of cells , piled up one above another , like the bricks of a wall : and their cavities all cornmunicate with one another .
From these and other anatomical facts , which are given in detail by the author , he concludes that the propulsion of the sap along the vessels , resulting from the operation of endosmose , will explain the descent of the cambium , which , being the nutritious portion of the vegetable fluids , corresponds in its nature to the chyle in animals .
