( Abstract .
) The new manometer , charged with mercury , is capable of measuring small pressures to an accuracy of 1/ 2000 mm. of mercury .
This may be compared with the ordinary manometer , read with the aid of a cathetometer , which is capable , according to Amagat , of an accuracy of 1/ 100 mm. at most .

( Abstract .
) Three papers on " Flame Spectra , " by one of the authors , were published in the 'Philosophical Transactions ' for 1894 .
Parts I and II , " Flame Spectra at High Temperatures , " and Part III , " The Spectroscopic Phenomena and Thermochemistry of the Bessemer Process .
" The results in the last of these papers had reference to the phenomena observed in the flames of the " acid " Bessemer process ; the present paper deals mainly with an investigation of the Thomas-Gilchrist or " basic " process .
The Cleveland district of Yorkshire was chosen as the principal centre ; owing to the interest taken in the work by Mr. Arthur Cooper , Past President of the Iron and Steel Institute , and in consequence of the courtesy and attention shown us , the North Eastern Steel Company 's works at Middlesbrough were selected .
It was found necessary at the outset to have three observers at work simultaneously , and the authors were voluntarily and ably assisted by Mr. E. V. Clark , A.R.S.M. Photographs of the plant and the flames , at different periods of the blow , were secured by means of a small Anschutz camera and Goertz lens ; eye observations were made with a small direct-vision spectroscope ; photographs of spectra were taken with the spectrograph described in ' Philosophical Transactions , ' A , vol. 185 , p. 1047 , and the times of the exposures , \amp ; c. , were observed and recorded in a note-book .
This work was not accomplished without some difficulty , which was occasioned by the large quantity of lime dust blown into the air .
The spectroscopic results were quite different from those previously obtained , as the continuous spectrum was much stronger .
Many lines and bands new to the Bessemer flame spectra have been observed in addition to the spectra of the common alkali metals , iron , and manganese .
Thus rubidium , caesium , calcium , copper , silver , and gallium have been identified .
