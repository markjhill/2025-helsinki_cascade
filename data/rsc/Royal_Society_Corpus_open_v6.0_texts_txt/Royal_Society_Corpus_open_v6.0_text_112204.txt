( Abstract .
) The decomposition into its linear factors of a decomposable quadric function cannot be effected in a symmetrical manner otherwise than by formulm containing supernumerary arbitrary quantities ; thus , for a binary quadric ( which of course is always decomposable ) we have ( a , b , c 2z , y)2= ( 2 Prod .
{ ( a , b , cy 'X , y ' ) ?
Vacb_2( y^y ) } ; ( a~~~~~~~~~~~ b ~~~ ~ ~ ' ) } ; X)l 106 or the expression for a linear factor is 1 1/ ( 6b c xd , yt)2 { ( a , 6 , Cx , yT(x ' , y ' ) + AVac-6(xyy ) } , which involves the arbitrary quantities ( x ' , y ' ) .
And this appears to be the reason why , in the analytical theory of the conic , the questions which involve the decomposition of a decomposable ternary quadric have been little or scarcely at all considered : thus , for instance , the expressions for the coordinates of the points of intersection of a conic by a line ( or , say , the line-equations of the two ineunts ) , and the equations for the tangents ( separate each from the other ) drawn from a given point not on the conic , do not appear to have been obtained .
All these questions depend on the decomposition of a decomposable ternary quadric , which decomposition itself depends on that for the simplest case , when the quadric is a perfect square .
Or we may say that in the first instance they depend on the transformation of a given quadric function U= ( -*x , y , z ) ' into the form W ' + V , where W is a linear function given , save as to constant factor ( that is , W-O0 is the equation of a given line ) , and V is a decomposable quadric function , which is ultimately decomposed into its linear factors , =QR , so that we have U=W'+ QR .
The formula for this purpose , which is exhibited in the eight different forms I , II , III , IV , I(bis ) , II(bis ) , III(bis ) , IV(bis ) , is the analytical basis of the whole theory , and the greater part of the Memoir relates to the establishment of these forms .
It will be sufficient for the present abstract to quote one only of these forms , viz. , ( a,..X , y , z)2= Quotient by ( a , ... X ' , y ' , z)2 of a [ ( .
X.X X , y , X yt , )]2 + Quotient by ( A,. .
mz -ny,..)2 of Product ( A,..xmz'-f'.3yx -y ' y ) z x , y , z / V-k(a,..3Xfz ' 1 , )2 XI , tl , Z ' 1 , m , Jn where the notation ( which is of course explained in the Memoir ) will , I think , be understood without difficulty , and I do not stop to explain it here .
The solution of the geometrical questions above referred to is , as 1862 .
] 107 shown in the Memoir , involved in and given immediately by these forms .
It is also shown that the formulae are greatly simplified in the case e. g. of tangents drawn to a conic from a point in a conic having double contact with the first-mentioned conic , and that in this case they lead to the linear automorphic transformation of the ternary quadric .
The Memoir concludes with some formulae relating to the case of two conics , which , however , is treated of in only a cursory manner .
