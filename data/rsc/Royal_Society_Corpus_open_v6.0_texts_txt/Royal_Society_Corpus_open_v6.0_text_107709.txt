A4 finite and exact expression for the Refraction of an Atmosphere nearly resembling that of the Earth .
By THOMAS YOUNG , M. D. For .
Sec. R. S. Read February 5 , 1824 .
IT has lately been demonstrated , in the Journal of the Royal Institution , that if the pressure of the atmosphere , y , be represented either by the square or by the cube of the square root of the density , z , the astronomical refraction , r , may be obtained in a finite equation .
Mr. IVORY , in a very ingenious and elaborate paper lately presented to the Royal Society , has computed the refraction , by means of several refined transformations , and with the assistance of converging series , from an equation which expresses the pressure in terms of the density and of its square : I have now to observe , that if we substitute , for the simple density , the cube of its square root , and make y 2= Z zi , we shall represent the constitution of the most important part of the atmosphere with equal accuracy , although this expression supposes the total height somewhat smaller than the truth , and belongs to one of those hypotheses , which Mr. IVORY has considered as inadmissible : it has the advantage , however , of affording a direct equation for the refraction , which agrees very nearly with Mr. IvoRY'S table , and still more accurately with the French table , and with that which has been published for some years in the Nautical Almanac .
Since dx =.-d m being the number of times that the mz modulus of the atmospherical elasticity is contained in the radius of the earth , and here die = v/ z dz -Z d z , we have d=-+ daz dz 9dfd=Vz + -+-7 , for 4 m./ z +m 2m m zm the height above the earth 's surface , which , when z= o , becomes.x 2730o = 95550 feet .
For the refraction , we have the equation d r=o ( i_ p , d z ( Astr .

There is however no reason for proceeding to compute a new ~table by this formula , the method employed for the table in the Nautical Almanac being rather more compendious in all common cases : and even if it were desired to represent Mr. IVORY'S table by the approximation there employed , we might obtain the same results , with an error never much exceeding a single second , from the equation oo0028533 =r 2+ *
