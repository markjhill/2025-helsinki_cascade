] In 1909 Messrs. J. Herbert Parsons and E. E. Henderson commenced some experiments on the action of short wave-length light on the lens and ciliary body , using Uviol glass mercury-vapour tubes and examining the lens and its capsule after exposure .
To test for damage to the ciliary body too slight to be appreciable microscopically use was made of an observation of Romer 's , that in animals sensitised to the blood of another species , htemolysins were not transmitted from the blood to the aqueous unless the constitution of the latter were altered by a previous paracentesis or an inflammatory lesion of the iris and ciliary body .
Positive results were obtained , but the experiments were not sufficiently extensive to be conclusive .
I have , therefore , on behalf of the Committee of the Royal Society on Glassworkers ' Cataract , repeated and extended the experiments along lines suggested by Mr. Parsons .
In the attempt to determine the effect of rays of various wave-lengths on the media of the eye , attention has been paid to three possible aetiological factors:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The intensity of the light .
( 2 ) The part of the spectrum mainly represented in the source of light .
( 3 ) The possibility of the inclusion of electrolytic and mechanical as well as of radiant energy .
1 .
Intensity.\#151 ; It has been customary among investigators of the subject to express the intensity roughly by naming the source of light , the quantity of energy ( usually electrical ) consumed in its production , and the distance of Dr. E. K. Martin .
[ Feb. 5 , the exposed eye from it .
Some observers have also attempted to record it in absolute units by expressing it in terms of the universal photometer .
Whilst this latter method is at first sight more exact , the correlation of observations from various sources would be facilitated by expressing the intensity also approximately in terms of one of its physiological results .
As the rdle of strong light in the production of corneal opacity is now well recognised , and the degree of opacity varies with the quantity of energy absorbed , valuable indication of the intensity of a given source of light from a physiological point of view is afforded by the resultant corneal disturbance\#151 ; when the exposures are repeated at intervals throughout a considerable period of time .
2 .
The Part of the Spectrum mainly Represented in the Source of Light.___ From the physiological point of view the spectrum may be divided into heat , visible and ultra-violet rays , each of which require separate consideration .
Putting aside the first , the investigation of which is not included in the present work , the absorption by the media of the eye must be taken into consideration^ since only rays which are absorbed are capable of inducing pathological changes in those media , 3 .
Ocular lesions following exposure to lightning , short-circuits of high-voltage currents , and discharge of Leyden jars should be omitted from the discussion of the effects of radiant energy , on account of the impossibility of determining the value of the electrolytic and mechanical ( concussion ) factors .
The present enquiry may be divided into three parts:\#151 ; I. The absorption of rays by the media of the eye in the visible and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum .
II .
The histological changes resulting from exposure to light consisting largely of such rays .
III .
The alteration in the iris and ciliary body produced by such rays .
Young rabbits ( i.e. three or four months old ) have been employed throughout .
I. The Absorption of Rays in the Media of the Eye in the Visible and Ultra-violet Portions of the Spectrum .
The spectrophotographic method of recording the results was used , and the media were mounted in cells with parallel sides of quartz .
The lens was dealt with in two ways :\#151 ; 1 .
Suspended in normal saline and placed at a distance from the slit greater than its focal length , so that a blurred image of the source of light was thrown on the slit .
This was necessary to avoid horizontal lines on the 1912 .
] The Effects of Ultra-Violet Rays upon the Eye .
resulting photograph , and the precautions taken quite excluded the possibility of stray light coming in between the cell and the slit .
2 .
A thin layer of lens substance was squeezed out flat between the parallel sides of the cell .
This was done to eliminate any possible apparent absorption due to refraction in the lens .
Visible .
A preliminary series of spectrophotographs were taken to eliminate absorption within the limits of the visible spectrum .
Source of Light.\#151 ; The crater of a carbon arc .
Instrument.\#151 ; A two-prism spectroscope , prisms and lenses being of glass .
Plates.\#151 ; Commercial " orthochromatic , " which regularly showed three faint absorption bands in the green , yellow , and red , representing the absorption of the dye used to sensitise the plates to red light .
Result.\#151 ; All the media were found to be uniformly permeable to rays between the wave-lengths 660 pp-390 / x/ x. ( The visible spectrum extended approximately 760 pp-380 pp ) ( Plate 4 ) .
Ultra-violet .
For the ultra-violet rays the iron arc was the source , and quartz lenses and prisms were employed throughout .
Ordinary plates were used , i.e. plates containing no dye and hence giving no absorption bands .
The range of wave-lengths covered in this series is 450 to 230 pp. Cornea.\#151 ; The cornea offers no resistance to rays of wave-lengths longer than 295 mm , but all those beyond this limit are completely cut off ( Plate 5 , B ) .
Lens.\#151 ; ( a ) Suspended in normal saline .
Rays of wave-lengths less than 350 / x/ x are absorbed completely .
The line is not a sharp one , the absorption commencing about 400 pp ( Plate 5 , F ) .
( 5 ) Squeezed to different thicknesses .
The absorption varies pari passu with the thickness of the layer of the lens substance ( Plate 5 , C , D , E ) .
It is clear , therefore , that between wave-lengths 400 mm and 300 / x/ x there is a group of rays to which the cornea offers no resistance , but which are absorbed by the lens , and are consequently capable of inducing changes in it .
Vitreous.\#151 ; The vitreous , in a layer 3/ 16 inch thick , shows a broad absorption band , extending from 280 to 250 with a maximum at 270 pp. The margins of the band are ill defined ( Plate 5 , H ) .
These results agree closely with those of the observers referred to below .
The shortest interval between the death of the animal and the taking of the observation was 3 minutes , the longest 11 minutes .
Observations were Dr. E. K. Martin .
[ Feb. 5 ; also made on the media 1 hour , 5 hours , and 8 hours after the death of the animal , the results obtained being identical with those from fresh specimens .
The photographs were taken at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , South Kensington , those of the visible spectrum in Sir Wm. Abney 's laboratory , the ultra-violet series in the Astrophysical Laboratory , by kind permission of Prof. Fowler , F.R.S. , to whom I am indebted for valuable suggestions .
II .
Histology .
Normal Capsule .
Method of Handling the Anterior Lens Capsule.\#151 ; The most satisfactory fixative solution for uniformity of results is Zenker 's fluid .
Formalin , in solution or vapour , gives excellent fixation of the cells , but renders the homogeneous layer of the capsule too elastic to allow of its being fixed flat on a slide .
In addition , the epithelium shows a tendency to adhere to the lens substance rather than to the capsule .
The following method has given the most uniform results:\#151 ; The globe is bisected at the equator , and the anterior half fixed in Zenker 's fluid for two hours , washed , and adherent vitreous removed .
The capsule is then cut through round the equator , and the lens shelled out entire , leaving the anterior capsule attached to the ciliary processes by the suspensory ligament .
The latter is then divided , and radial incisions made into the capsule , allowing it to be floated , epithelium uppermost , on to a slide , and blotted flat .
As a stain , Ehrlich 's acid hsematoxylin has been used exclusively , as it gives by far the most constant results .
The iron-haematoxylin methods give clear pictures , but are somewhat irregular , while the aniline stains have the drawback that they colour the homogeneous layer of the capsule , and so spoil the contrast .
Occurrence of Mitoses.\#151 ; From the systematic examination of the anterior capsule cells of the rabbit 's lens mounted as described , it appears that at birth , and for the first six to eight weeks of life , numerous mitoses occur , scattered uniformly round the equator over a zone equal in breadth to a quarter of the radius of the capsule .
Cell division in this zone becomes progressively less active till the third or fourth month , and , in animals over six months , 10 to 15 mitoses only are found at the extreme periphery .
Cell division in the pupillary area is extremely rare at any age , and has been found only once in 10 capsules examined systematically for that purpose .
The age of the animal and the topography of the normal capsule 1912.1 The Effects of Ultra-Violet upon 323 must therefore be taken into account in discussing the occurrence of pathological mitoses after exposure to light ( figs. 1 and 2 ) .

) Histological Changes in Lens and Ciliary Body resulting from Exposure to .
Bays of Short .
As a source of light containing the highest possible proportion of short wave-length rays , the Kromayer water-cooled mercury-vapour lamp was employed .
This consists of a mercury arc in a quartz vacuum-tube surrounded by a water-jacket with a quartz window .
Dr. E. K. Martin .
[ Feb. 5 , The photographic spectrum to this lamp extends from wave-lengths 590 to 222 fip , and is most intense between wave-lengths 579 up and 254 It emits no heat appreciable by means of a thermometer .
The current consumption is 2*5 amperes on a 220-volt circuit .
A. Single Exposures of High Intensity .
If the lids are kept apart by a speculum , exposures of one-half to two hours at a distance of 1 inch are followed by the changes in the anterior capsule cells described by Hess ( Ref. 10 ) .
That is , shortly after the exposure , the cells are swollen and their nuclei show diffuse staining of the chromatin .
After 24 hours there is a central area , corresponding to the pupil , in which many of the nuclei are represented by scattered chromatin granules extruded from the still visible nuclear membrane .
Surrounding this damaged area is the ring of apparently crowded , deeply stained cells which Hess has described as the epithelial " wall .
" This " wall " may or may not form a complete circle , and varies in width from about four to eight cells .
The appearance is due chiefly to the deeper staining of both nuclei and cell bodies , consequent on the submaximal damage at the pupillary margin , , accompanied probably by the heaping up described by Hess .
He suggested that the swollen central cells pushed those at the pupillary margin up against the intact ones lying under cover of the iris , and so crowded them closely together .
Two or three days after the exposure , numerous karyokinetic figures are seen in the damaged area , regeneration taking place in the usual way .
The inflammatory changes in the anterior part of the eye correspond with those described in detail by Birch-Hirschfeld ( Ref. 7 ) and other writers as following exposure to the Uviol mercury-vapour lamp , etc. There is intense conjunctivitis with sub-epithelial haemorrhages , thickening of conjunctival and corneal epithelium , with subjacent round cell infiltration corresponding to the hyperkeratosis and papillary infiltration seen in the skin after exposure to the Kromayer lamp .
The pupil is small and the iris hyperaemic , but I have not observed exudates on iris or ciliary body with the exposures given .
That these changes are due wholly or almost entirely to rays beyond the visible violet is shown by the absence of all but a slight conjunctival hyperaemia following exposures of similar duration , in which a benzol cell is interposed between the lamp and the eye .
Benzol is transparent to the rays of the visible spectrum but cuts off all those beyond the violet end .
An attempt was made to find some substance permeable to rays of the shorter wave-lengths only .
P.-nitro-benzene-azo-dimethyl-aniline in N/ 10,000 aqueous solution transmits a band in the red and another beyond the violet , but the intensity of the resulting rays is so low as to produce no 1912.1 The Effects of Ultra-Violet Rays upon the Eye , 325 effect even on the conjunctiva after exposures of 1 hour at 5 inches daily for 2 weeks B. Repeated Exposures oj Moderate Intensity .
In this series no speculum was employed and the intensity was below that necessary to cause immediate damage to the anterior capsule , as determined by preliminary single exposures .
Thirteen rabbits ( of which 3 were albinos ) and 3 guinea-pigs have been exposed at distances of 4 inches to 3 feet over periods varying from 2| to 12 months .
All were young animals at the commencement , and in each case the left eye was exposed , the right being used as control .
They may be grouped into three classes according to the degree of exposure and the severity of the inflammatory reaction which follows , the depth of corneal opacity being the most useful criterion of the latter .
Results .
Class I : No Corneal Opacity.\#151 ; In this group 5 rabbits and 3 guinea-pigs were exposed for from 1 to 3 hours weekly at 3 feet for 3 to 9 months .
They were killed 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 days after the last exposure .
In each case there was slight chronic conjunctivitis , the media were clear , and the anterior lens capsule was normal on microscopical examination .
Class II : Slight Corneal Opacity.\#151 ; Four rabbits were exposed for 1 hour every 10 days at 4 inches for 3 , 7,10 , and 12 months respectively .
They were killed 4 , 7 , 7 , and 13 days after the last exposure .
In each case there was marked chronic conjunctivitis with thickening of the lids and slight ectropion .
There was moderate corneal and no lenticular opacity .
In Rabbit No. 3 , exposed for 12 months , there was a ring-shaped zone of cell proliferation in the pupillary area of the anterior lens capsule ( see Plates 6 and 7 ) .
The latter was normal in the other three animals .
Class III : Dense Corneal Opacity.\#151 ; Four rabbits were exposed for 3 hours every 2 weeks at 4 inches for 3 , 9 , 10 , and 11 months respectively .
In each case there was chronic conjunctivitis with marked ectropion .
The cornea showed a dense opacity which had undergone vascularisation .
The lens was clear , and the anterior capsule normal .
The animals were killed 1 , 2 , 7 , and 10 days after the last exposure .
With one exception , therefore , this series shows no change in the lens or its capsule as the result of long-continued exposure to rays of short wavelength .
With regard to this exception two possible explanations may be advanced .

[ Feb. 5 1912 .
] The Effects of Ultra-Violet Rays upon the Eye .
327 he showed that following heavy exposures to the Uviol-glass mercury r vapour lamp , which emits rays down to a wave-length of 253 degeneration of the capsule cells in the pupillary area occurs , followed two to four days later by regeneration as evidenced by the occurrence of mitoses .
Surrounding the damaged area , i.e. at the pupillary margin , a zone of darkly stained nuclei is iseen , an appearance which he describes as an epithelial " wall .
" That this phenomenon cannot adequately explain the condition of the capsular thickening described in Rabbit No. 3 is shown by three points:\#151 ; ( a ) The epithelial " wall " described by Hess is a narrow ring surrounding a wide circle of damaged cells .
The zone of proliferation described in Rabbit No. 3 is a wide one enclosing a small area of normal or dividing cells .
( b ) The epithelial " wall " appears to be due to a swelling of the cells and a tendency of both nuclei and cell protoplasm to stain more deeply than usual .
In Rabbit No. 3 the\lt ; increased density of staining is present to a slight degree but the proliferation has resulted in a layer two or three cells thick .
( c ) In no other case has cell destruction and regeneration followed an exposure of such slight severity .
2 .
It is the first stage of the formation of an anterior capsular cataract .
While this was the only animal of the series in which capsular proliferation occurred , it is possible that its absence in the other animals may be ascribed to their falling into one of two classes:\#151 ; ( a ) That in which the short exposure was a subminimal stimulus to cell division ; That in which the corneal opacity following heavy exposure acted as a shield to the subjacent lens epithelium .
It is suggested , therefore , that in this case the light has acted as a stimulus to proliferation of the normal anterior capsule cells , without them going through the preliminary stage of damage , such as occurs after exposures of greater intensity .
With this exception , the results of repeated exposure to the Kromayer lamp agree with those of Birch-Hirschfeld ( Ref. 8 ) , who exposed dogs at 10 cm .
from Uviol mercury-vapour light for 10 minutes weekly for 18 months , and found no lenticular opacity or capsule changes .
As they developed no corneal opacity they fall into line with the first group of my series .
III .
Preliminary Report on the Transmission of Hemolysins to the Aqueous after Exposure to Short Wave-Length Light .
Following an exposure to the Kromayer lamp of an intensity such as , in the second series , was repeated frequently over periods of several months , no signs of irritation of the iris or ciliary body are observed by the ordinary i methods of physical examination , with the exception of a transient contraction Dr. E. K. Martin .
[ Feb. 5 , of the pupil and hyperaemia of the iris .
At the end of the series of exposures , both iris and ciliary body were normal on microscopical examination , so that to determine if a slight ciliary irritation persisted in the intervals between successive exposures a more delicate test of such irritation had to be employed .
For this purpose advantage was taken of an observation of Romer 's ( Ref. 15 ) that the aqueous of animals which had been sensitised to the erythrocytes of a foreign species had no power to haemolyse the blood of that species .
If , however , when the anterior chamber had reformed , a second paracentesis was done , the aqueous obtained was actively haemolytic .
Similarly , if slight iridocyclitis was induced the same result followed .
| Rabbits were rendered haemolytic by injection with washed cats ' corpuscles intraperitoneally in doses of 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 c.c. at intervals of four days .
Haemolysis is most active 8-10 days after the last injection .
Romer 's observations were first confirmed as follows:\#151 ; First aqueous , 9 cases ... ... .
