) The present investigation arose out of a research on chemiotaxis , in the course of which it became apparent that a pre-condition of the correct understanding of the nature of chemiotaxis is the quantitative determination of ( 1 ) the concentration of the acid and alkaline solutions j employed for the study of chemiotactic phenomena , and also of ( 2 ) the absolute weight of Paramcecia ( or other organisms ) added to such solutions .
So long as these data are unknown , chemiotaxis can only be investigated qualitatively , and such facts as are ascertainable solely by means of quantitative observations lie beyond the limits of research .
In order that the acid and alkaline liquids employed may be readily comparable one with another , equimolecular solutions are employed in this investigation .
The absolute volume of Paramcecia employed in the different experiments was determined by means of the hsemocrit , as in the case of red blood-cells , and from this the weight of Paramoecia was ascertained .
In those experiments in which an approximate determination of the weight was sufficient , the Paramcecia were counted , a modification of the method used for the enumeration of red blood-cells being adopted .
In all cases the Paramcecia were obtained in as nearly as possible the same condition .
They were removed by centrifugalisation from the liquid in which they had been cultivated , and placed in a large bulk of distilled water for 24 hours before use .
At the end of this time they were again concentrated , by eentrifugalisation , into a small bulk of fresh distilled water , and were ready for use .
' In this way contamination of the acid and alkaline solutions employed was avoided , and the modification of chemiotactic .
reaction brought about by the medium used for cultivation was also , as far as possible , avoided .
The method of investigation adopted for determining the lethal concentration of acids and alkalies consisted in placing Paramcecia in solutions of gradually decreasing molecular concentration , arranged so as to form a geometrical series , each succeeding concentration being half that of the preceding , and noting the time at which death occurred .
In all the experiments quoted , in order to make certain that the extremely dilute solutions employed were accurately prepared , their relative conductivity was determined .
The latter was measured y the deflection of a sensitive galvanometer , when a fixed potentia 1904 .

101 difference was established between platinised electrodes immersed in the acid and alkaline solutions employed .
The action of acids and bases upon Paramoecia is shown in Tables I and II .
The acids employed are divided into three groups , according to the degree to which they are dissociated ; the first consisting of the strong mineral acids , hydrochloric , nitric and sulphuric ; the second including the organic acids , formic , lactic , oxalic , tartaric , citric and acetic , together with phosphoric acid ; while the third group is made up of extremely weak electrolytes , namely , carbonic , carbolic , hydrocyanic and boric acids .
Similarly the bases employed may be arranged in three groups : the first consisting of the strongly dissociated metallic alkalies ; the second being represented by the feebly dissociated ammonium hydrate ; and the third consisting of the extremely weak electrolyte anilin .
In the second column of the tables , the figures in brackets represent the time , in minutes , which elapsed before all the Paramoecia employed were killed .
The latter were added in the proportion of about thirty to every 10 c.c. of liquid , and did not appreciably affect the concentration .
The temperature of experiment was 16 ' C. to 18 ' C. In 0*0001 N concentration* the strong mineral acids are nearly equally lethal .
Some of the weak acids of the second group , in the same concentration , are more lethal than the mineral acids , namely , acetic , lactic and oxalic acids ; while others of the same group are less so , namely , phosphoric , citric and acetic .
On the other hand the weak electrolytes are lethal in a considerably higher molecular concentration , reaching in the case of hydrocyanic acid 0*3 N. Since the rate at which chemical change takes place is dependent upon ionic concentration , the dissociation co-efficient calculated from the conductivity ( 18 ' C. ) or the dissociation constant ( 25 ' C. ) is given , so far as the available data permit , in the third column of the tables , and the corresponding ionic concentration in the fourth column , the latter being the product of the concentration and dissociation coefficient .
The weak acids are more lethal in less ionic concentration than the strong acids , and the extremely weak electrolytes exhibit the smallest ionic concentration , that of phenol forming the limit of the series .
Excluding phenol , however , it is seen that when the acids employed are arranged in the order of their dissociation ( Table I ) , the diminution in ionic concentration proceeds at a much slower rate than the increase of molecular concentration .
The strong alkalies are similarly less toxic than the weak alkali , ammonium hydrate , and the latter again is considerably less so than * concentration given in the tables is equivalent , except for carbonic and boric acids , which are regarded as binary compounds , and whose concentration represents gramme-molecules per litre .

The metallic alkalies can be arranged in two periodic groups , the mean lethal concentration of the one ( K , Na , Li ) being greater than j that of the other ( Ca , Sr , Ba ) , when Paramoecia are killed in nearly | equal times .

I When the hydrates of calcium , strontium and barium are employed in I solutions of weaker concentration , so as to permit of a more accurate I determination of the lethal period than is possible when observation I extends over so short a period as 5 minutes , it can be shown that I strontium hydrate is less toxic than barium hydrate , but the difference I between the latter hydrates is much less than that between strontium I and calcium hydrates .
Similarly the difference in lethal character I between sodium and potassium hydrates is much less marked than that i between sodium and lithium hydrates .
It is not possible , owing to B Sir T. R. Fraser and Major R. H. Elliot .
[ May 10 , their insolubility , to employ the remaining members of the above periodic groups in the present investigation .
The considerable difference in ionic concentration both of acids and of bases , for a nearly equal toxic effect , shows that such effect is not hydrolytic in character , for in such a case the concentration of H+ or OH- ions would be constant for each series .
The relation between periodic grouping and lethal character , exhibited by strong alkalies , supports the view that the latter is dependent upon a chemical reaction not hydrolytic in character .
