A paper was read , entitled , " Researches on the Chemical Equi ?
valents of certain Bodies .
" By Richard Phillips , Esq. , F.R.S. The author examines , by a new series of experiments , the truth of the theory of Dr. Prout and Dr. Thomson , namely , that " all atomic weights are simple multiples of that of hydrogen , " a theory which the late Dr. Turner had maintained is at variance with the most exact analytic researches , and consequentlyuntenable .
Although the experiments of Dr. Turner , and the inferences which he drew from them , agree very nearly with those of Berzelius , it still appeared to the author desirable to investigate this subject ; and it occurred to him that the inquiry might be conducted in a mode not liable to some of the objections which might be urged against the processes usually employed .
Dr. Turner having adopted a whole number , namely 108 , as the equivalent of silver , this substance was selected by the author as the basis of his inquiry into the equivalent numbers of chlorine , and some other elementary gases .
It appeared to him that the chance of error arising from the fusing of the chloride of silver might be entirely removed , and other advantages gained , by experimenting on silver on a large scale , with such proportions of the substances employed as were deemed to be equivalents ; and instead of calculating from the whole product of the fused chloride , to do it merely from the weight of such small portion only , as might arise from the difference between theoretical views and experimental results .
The author concludes , from the train of reasoning he applies to the series of experiments so undertaken , that no material , and even scarcely any appreciable error can arise from considering the equivalent numbers of hydrogen , oxygen , azote , and chlorine , as being 1 , 8,14 , and 36 respectively .
