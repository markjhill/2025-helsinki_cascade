Observations and Experiments upon Dr. James 's Powder ; with a Method of preparing , in the humid Way , a similar Substance .

] From the experiments of Dr. Pearson on the nature of Dr. James 's powder , published in the 81st volume of the Philosophical Transactions , our author infers that the mode in which it is prepared is far from being the best that the present improved state of chemical knowledge might afford ; the use of fire in delicate processes , whether analytical or synthetical , being in general thought inferior to those performed in the humid way .
This powder , we are told , is prepared by mixing equal quantities of bone shavings ( or phosphate of lime ) and crude antimony , and calcining them together in an intense heat .
Here it is observed , that the portion of oxide of antimony , which is not volatilized in the process , becomes in a great measure insoluble in all acids .
The humid process which Mr. Chenevix recommends as preferable to the above , consists in dissolving together or separately , in .
the least possible portion of muriatic acid , equal parts of the white oxide of antimony and phosphate of lime ; after which , pouring this solution gradually into distilled water previously alkalizated by a sufficient quantity of ammonia , a white and abundant precipitate will be produced , which , being well washed anddried , is the substitute he proposes for James 's powder .
A few observations are added on the theory of this combination ; as also an assertion , that this powder , administered as a medicine , perfectly agreed in its general effects with James 's powder , and the pulvis antimonialis , often prescribed in lieu of it , with this advantage , that being more mild , it may be given in larger doses , without producing the nausea or other stimulating symptoms that usually attend it .
