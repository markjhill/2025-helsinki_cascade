IT has long been suspected that important advantages might be derived from , the substitution of air for steam as a prime mover of machinery .
It has been alleged that the air-engine would be safer , lighter , and more economical in the expenditure of fuel than the steam-engine .
Until comparatively recent times , however , experimental science was hardly in the state of advancement requisite to enable the physicist , in his investigation of this important subject , to arrive at conclusions sufficiently certain to give confidence to the practical machinist .
Professor THOMSON , Mr. RANKINE , and M. CLAUsIUs have of late , however , published papers of great value on the mechanical action of gases , and particularly of steam , ' founded on tolerably correct experimental data .
I hope that the following remarks founded on the same general principles , but applied to a particular kind of air-engine , may be interesting to the Royal Society .
The air-engine , the performance of which I propose to discuss , consists of two parts , in one of which the air is compressed into a receiver , where its elasticity is increased by the application of heat , and in the other it is allowed to escape again from the receiver into the atmosphere .
By the former work is absorbed , by the latter it is evolved in a larger quantity , the excess constituting the work evolved by the engine on the whole .
The simple question , therefore , is to determine the quantity of work so evolved , together with the heat applied to increase the elasticity of the air in the receiver .
In Plate VI .
fig. I let A be the pump by which air is forced into the receiver C , where heat may be communicated to it from an external source , and B the cylinder , by which the same quantity is allowed to escape again into the atmosphere .
Moreover , let the material of which the apparatus is made , with the exception of that part through which heat may be communicated to the air in C , be impervious to , and destitute of capacity for heat .
Such a machine may be conceived to work in the following manner .
The cylinder of the pump A being filled with air of the atmospheric temperature and pressure , the piston compresses the air until , at a point n , its pressure is rendered equal to that of the air in the receiver C , which has been previously filled with air of an elevated temperature and pressure .
The work absorbed by this action will be that communicated to the air in the cylinder , minus the work due to the atmospheric pressure through m n. The moment the piston has passed the -point n the valve will open , admitting the air into the receiver C ; and as this receiver may be conceived to be of indefinite magnitude , the alteration of pressure in -it , consequent upon the introduction of fresh air , may he neglected .
Heat is then communicated to the air in the receiver , in order to restore its temperature to the intensity which existed before the admission of air at a lower temperature .
The air is then allowed to escape from the receiver into the base of the cylinder B , evolving work until , on the arrival of the piston at Wn , the same quantity has been removed from the receiver as was forced into it by the pump .
The further supply of air fromD the receiver is then cut off , and that which has entered the cylinder expands , evolving work until , on the artrival of the piston at mn ' , its pressure is reduced to that of the atmosphere .
By opening valves at the bases of A and B , the pistons are then brought to their first positions .
The problem which must be solved in order to estimate the power and consumption of fuel in an engine similar to that just described , is as follows:-To determine the pressure and temperature for any point of the stroke of a piston which compresses a given volume of air , and the quantity of work absorbed in forcing the piston to that point .
For the temperature and pressure POISSON has furnished the following formulaeTI~ ' and Pr tVVS Pt V k ' where T. P , and V are the temperature from absolute zero ( estimated at 4910 FAHR. below the freezing-point of water ) , pressure , and volume of the air before compression ; T ' , P ' , and V ' the temperature from absolute zero , pressure , and volume of air after compression ; and k is the ratio of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to triat at constant volume .
Professor W. THOMSON has deduced , as a consequence of the above , the following formula for the work absorbed , k-i{ ; From the foregoing formulae I have calculated the work absorbed by compressing air in a cylinder 1 foot long , and of the capacity of 12 cubic inches , the absolute temperature of the air , and its pressure at each tenth of an inch of the piston 's progress .
The following data were employed in the computation:-Weight of 100 cubic inches of atmospheric air of 16 lbs. pressure on the square inch , and 491 ?
* The above formula was kindly communicated to the author by Professor THoMsoN , in a letter dated January 15 , 1851 , from which the following is an extract:-It is required to find the work necessary to compress a given mass of air to a given fraction of its volume , when no heat is permitted to leave the air .
Let P.i V , T be the primitive pressure , volume , and temperature , respectively ; let p. v , and t be the pressure , volume , and temperature at any instant during the compression ; and let PF .
V ' , and T ' be what they become from the absolute zero , 33i2237 grs. ; specific heat of air at constant volume , 019742 .
Ratio of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to that at constant volume , as determined from the experiments of DELAROCHE and BERARD , and the mechanical equivalent of heat , 1-3519325* .
The results are shown in Table I. I now proceed to give some estimates of the performance of an air-engine similar in principle to that already described , worked at various pressures and temperatures , those of the atmospheric air being 15 lbs. on the square inch , and 32 ?
FAHR. or 491 ?
FAHR. from the absolute zero .
In order to render the results easily available in calculating the duty of engines of greater size , I shall assume that the condensing pump is 12 inches long , and has a sectional area equal to 1 square inch , and that the cylinder , also of 1 inch section , has a length which may be made to vary according to the pressure and temperature employed .
I take as the first example , a case in which the receiver C contains air of the atmospheric density , and of which the absolute temperature is 8490.464 FAHR. or 3900.464 of the scale of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer .
The pressure in the receiver will then be 25-95104 lbs. on the square inch , as given in the third column of Table II .
The air in the pump A will be brought to the same pressure , and to the absolute temperature 566 " ?
3094 after the piston has traversed 4 inches .
The work absorbed by the air will be 6'537154 foot-pounds , from which , by subtracting 5 foot-pounds , the work communicated by the pressure of the atmosphere following the piston , we obtain 1537154 foot-pounds as the work of the engine absorbed by the first part of the stroke .
This result is consigned to column 6 .
Immediately after the piston has passed the fourth inch of the pump , the valve will be opened admitting the compressed air into the receiver C. Trle work of the engine absorbed by the rewhen the compression is concluded .
Then if k denote the ratio of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to the specific heat of air kept in a space of constant volume , and if , as appears to be nearly , if not rigorously true , k be constant for varying temperatures and pressures , we shall have by the investigation in MILLER'S 'Hydrostatics ' ( Edit .

k-IifV ' ) } maining 8 inches of the piston 's stroke will be ( 25 95104-15)=7*300693 footpounds , as given in the seventh column .
The air thus forced into the receiver at the absolute temperature 566 ?
3094 FAHR. 1must then be raised to 8490464 FAHR. , the constant absolute temperature of the receiver .
The heat necessary for this purpose , being that due to the capacity for heat of air at constant pressure , will be that which is able to raise the temperature of 1 lb. of water 0`.04304312 FAHR. , as given in column 15 .
On leaving the receiver , the air enters the cylinder of expansion B , and having propelled the piston through 12 inches , the same quantity of air will have passed out of the receiver as was pumped into it by A. The further supply of air is then cut off , and the air after expanding through the remaining 6 inches of the cylinder ( which in this case must be 18 inches long ) , will be reduced to the pressure of 15 lbs. on the square inch , and the absolute temperature 3 ( 4910)=7360.5 .
The work evolved by the piston will also be to that absorbed in the condensing pump , as the volume of the cylinder B is to that of the pump A ; from which we find 3 ( 7300693 ) = 10'95104 foot-pounds , and 3 ( 1V537154)=2305731 foot-pounds , the work evolved by the first and second parts of the piston 's stroke , as given in columns I1 and 12 .
The work evolved by the engine on the whole , being the difference between the work evolved by B , and the work absorbed by A , will be equal to onethird of the former , or one-half of the latter , or 4,418924 foot-pounds , as given in column 14 .
Dividing this by 0 ?
04304312 , we obtain 102,66276 foot-pounds as the work evolved by the engine out of each 1 ?
FAHR. per lb. of water communicated to the receiver .
This result , which is consigned to the sixteenth column , informs us of the economical value of the engine , which is of course great in proportion to its approach to 772 foot-pounds , the theoretical maximum .
The seventeenth column contains the theoretical duty according to Professor THoMsON'S law .
, viz. that the range of temperature divided by the maximum absolute temperature is equal to the fiaction of heat converted into force by any perfect engine* .
It will be observed that the numbers in column 16 , representing the work evolved out of each unit of heat , increase with the temperature and pressure of the air in the receiver .
In every example given , with the exception of the first , the economical value of the air-engine in question is greater than that of the steam-engine calculated by Mr. RANKINE in his paper on the Mechanical Action of I-Ieatt .
In considering the relative merits of the engines , we must not , however , lose sight of a most important fact discovered by RANKINE and CLAUSIUS , viz. that a portion of the heat employed to evaporate water in the boiler is afterwards evolved in the form of work , in consequence of the liquefaction , in the cylinder , of a portion of the expanding vapour .
This fact would induce the hope that a great portion of the latent heat of evaporation , which is at present almost entirely lost , might by an increase of temnperature , and by extending the principle of expansion , be converted into mechanical effect .
If , as would appear from the experiments of DE LA RIVE and MARCET , IHAYCRAFT and DULONG , the capacity for heat of a given volume is the same in all gases taken at the same pressure and temperature , the results of the above'Tables will be equally true whatever elastic fluid be employed .
It now only remains to offer a few observations , with a view to facilitate the labours of those who May be desirous of constructing a good practical air-engine .
It nay be remarked , in the first place , that the receiver C need not be of much greater capacity than the cylinder B. For in the reciprocating engine , the air could be introduced from the pump A , at the same time that an equal amount would be expelled into the cylinder B. It would therefore be only requisite to pass the air through tubes heated by a proper furnace , as in NEILSON 's hot-blast , the tubes themselves constituting the receiver C. For a temperature under the red heat , these tubes might be constructed of wrought or cast iron .
They might be either straight , like the tubes of a locomotive boiler , or arranged in the form of a coil , as represented by fig. 2 , in which a is the pipe which conveys the air from the pump , c , C , C , &amp;c. is the coil of wrought or cast-iron tubing , and b is the pipe which conveys the heated air to the cylinder .
The coil is surrounded by a massive arch of brickwork , which serves at once to support the pipes , and to prevent waste of heat .
To prevent the temperature exceeding the proper limits , the pipe b might , as it expands by the heat of the enclosed air , move a piece of mechanism in connection with the damper of the flue .
I may remark that , on the scales adopted , fig. 2 represents the size of receiver which would be required for an engine the cylinder of which is 3 feet in diameter .
I would here venture to suggest whether the combustion of the fuel could not , by suitable mechanical arrangements , be carried on within the receiver C ; if this could be accomplished , the heat , which in the form of receiver already described is-lost up the chimney , would be economized , and a great saving of weight and space would be effected .
An engine furnished with a receiver of this kind would be strikingly analogous to the electro-magnetic engine , and present a beautiful illustration of the evolution of mechanical effect from chemical forces .
In both of the above forms of receiver , it would be desirable , as already hinted , that the introduction of the air into the receiver should be simultaneous with the expulsion of the same quantity into the cylinder .
This is necessary in order both to keep the pressure in the receiver uniform and to promote the smooth action of the engine .
For this purpose the piston-rods of the pump and cylinder , a and b ( fig. 3 ) , Must be attached to cranks on different parts of the circumference of the revolving shaft c C , SO contrived that the piston shall arrive at the top or bottom of the cylinder the moment that the pump-valve opens admitting a fresh supply of air into the receiver .
The cylinder should of course be provided with proper expansion gear to cut off the air at the required part of the stroke , which must be a constant quantity for each engine .
The valves of the pump would of course be self-acting .
In an engine similar to that described , it will be obvious that if the temperature of the receiver be kept constant , the pressure of air in it will also remain constant .
For whilst the same quantity of air is always introduced into the receiver by each stroke of the pump , the quantity expelled out of it would increase with an augmentation and decrease with a diminution of pressure .
In conclusion , I would recommend the examples No. 3 and No. 5 of Table II .
to the attention of those who may be willing to construct an air-engine .
In both of these cases the capacity of the pump is two-thirds of that of the cylinder .
In the cylinder of No. 3 the air is to be cut off at one-third of the stroke ; and in that of No. 5 at one-sixth of the stroke .
The temperature of the air in the receiver ( supposing that of the atmosphere to be 320 FAHR. ) is 625 ? ?
145 FAHR. in No. 3 , and 9240 66 FAHR. in No. 5 .
The consumption of fuel in No. 3 need not exceed one-half , nor that in No. 5 one-third of that in the most perfect steam-engines at present constructed .

Note to the foregoing Paper , with a New Experimental Determination of the Specks Heat of Atmospheric Air .
Received March 23 , 1852 .
Since the above was written , Professor W. H. MILLER has directed my attention to the probable incorrectness of the value of k , as deduced from the experiments of DELAROCHE and BERARD on the specific heat of air , and my own determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat ; in comparison with the value deduced from the numerous and excellent experiments on the velocity of sound .
Mr. RANKINE considers that the discrepancy between the two values arises from the incorrectness of DELAROCHE and BERARD 's result , an opinion which would seem to be justified by the entire want of accordance between the determination of these philosophers , and those of SUERMANN , and CLEMENT and DESORMES .
I have therefore been induced to make the following careful experiments in order to obtain a fresh and , if possible , more correct value of the specific heat of air at constant pressure .
The apparatus I employed is represented by fig. 4 , in which a and b are two vessels , each of which contains a coil of leaden piping eight yards long and one quarter of an inch in internal diameter .
rfhe coil of the upper vessel passes three-eighths of an inch through the bottom to which it is soldered at c and is thence connected with the coil of the lower vessel by a piece of vulcanized india rubber tubing .
-This part of the apparatus will be better understood by a reference to fig. 5 , in which a section of it is represented , a being the upper , b the lower vessel , and w the surface of the water in the latter .
xx are a pair of wooden pincers by means of which the india rubber tube could be compressed so as to prevent , when desired , any communication between the air in the two coils of piping .
Referring again to fig. 4 , g is a gas-lamrp to maintain the water in the upper vessel at a constant high tenperatur-e , andj is a tall jar filled with coarsely pounded chloride of calcium , in passing through which the air was entirely deprived of aqueous vapour ; a length of vulcanized india rubber tubing , p , connects the coil of the lower vessel with a good air-pump , each barrel of which was found to have a capacity of 12177 cubic inches .
The temperature of the pump could be ascertained by means of a small thermometer , the bulb of which was kept in contact with one of the barrels .
The method of experimenting was as follows:--The lower vessel being filled with cold water , and the upper with water raised to about 1900 , their exact temperatures were read off , with the usual precautions , from the scales of delicate and accurate thermometers .
The pump was then worked at a uniform velocity for twenty-six minutes , the water in the lower vessel being agitated from time to time by a stirrer .
The examination of the barometer and thermometers a second time occupied four minutes more ; so that the whole time occupied by each experiment was exactly half an hour .
The pincers were now applied so as to cut off all communication betw~een the air in the two coils , and the effect of the various causes of a change of temperature in the lower vessel , unconnected with the current of heated air , was observed during another half-hour .
Experiments of both the above kinds were repeated several times with the results tabulated below .
I may remark in this place that I had ascertained , by prelimninary experiments , that the air passed from the coils of the vessels sensibly at the temperatures registered by the thermometers plunged into the surrounding water .

The volume of air passed through the pump was 12-77x26 X40=13280-8 cubic inches , which , at the observed barometric pressure and the temperature 540.32 , would weigh 4252-7 grs. Hence we have for the specific heat178035 x 0-824 -4252-7 x L-2136 2674 .
By another series of experiments , in which the air-pump was worked at the velocity of twenty strokes per minute for twenty minutes , I obtained the value 0-2325 .
The mean of the three results is 0-22977 , or neatly 0-23 , which we may take as the specific heat of air at constant pressure deter-mined by the above expet-iments .
Professor W. IH .
MILLER has remarked that MOLL'S experiments , when correctly reduced , give a velocity of sound equal to 332A475 metres per second in dry air at 32c .
Hence he deduces 141029 as the value of k. Calling it in round numbers 1P41 and the mechanical equivalent of heat 772 , we obtain 0-238944 as the value of the specific heat of air at constant pressure , a result sufficiently near the experimental determination to show that the value of k , as deduced by Professor MILLER , is much nearer the truth than that upon which the tables of the foregoing paper are founded .
TLhe values of k , as determined by the experiments of DESORMEs and CLEMENT , GAY-LusSAc and WELTER , and Mr. MEIKLE , referred to in the note to page 67 , are respectively only 1P354 , 1-375 , and 1'333 .
In these experiments a small portion of air having been withdrawn from a large receivers the equilibrium was re-established by opening for an instant a large aperture communicating with the external air , and then , after the receiver and its contents had regained their original tem perature , the alteration of pressure , indicating the sudden rise of temperature which had taken place on the admission of the air , was noted .
But it is obvious that the sudden admission of the air would cause the development of sound , and that , a portion of the vis viva escaping in this form , the increase of temperature and the deduced ratio of the specific heats would be diminished accordingly .
I subjoin Tables , similar to Tables I. and II .
, calculated from the data k=1P41 , and the specific heat of air at constant volume =0T169464 , ot at constant pressure =0 238944 .
In Table IV .
, the examples 9 , 10 and 11 may be suggested to the notice of the practical engineer , the temperature of the receiver being in all those cases below that of redness .
I may remind the reader that the Table is founded on the supposition that the air which enters the pump has 4910 of temnperature from the absolute zero , and that its pressure is 15 lbs. on the square inch .
If this initial temperature be altered , the whole of the other temperatures in the Table must be altered in the same proportion , but the pressure , work and economical duty will remain unchanged .
If the initial pressure be altered , all the other pressures and work will suffer a proportionate change , but the temperatures and economical duty will remain the same .
The above are obvious deductions from the formulaw on which the Tables are founded .

Synthetical Investigation of the Duty of a Perfect Thermo-Dynamic Engine founded on the Expansions and Condensations of a Fluid , for which the gaseous laws hold and the ratio ( k ) of the specjfic heat under constant pressure to the specfic heat in constant volume is constant ; and modjflcation of the result by the assunmpton of MAYE'S hypothesis .
Let the source from which the heat is supplied be at the temperature S , and let T denote the temperature of the coldest body that can be obtained as a refrigerator .
A cycle of the following four operations being reversible in every respect , gives , according to CARNOT'S principle , first demonstrated for the Dynamical Theory by CLAUSIUS , the greatest possible statical nechanical effect that can be obtained in these circumstances from a quantity of heat supplied from the source .
( 1 .
) Let a quantity of air contained in a cylinder and piston , at the temperature S , be allowed to expand to any extent , and let heat be supplied to it to keep its temperature constantly S. ( 2 .
) Let the air expand farther , without being allowed to take heat from or to part with heat to surrounding matter , until its temperature sinks to T. ( 3 .
) Let the air be allowed to part with heat so as to keep its temperature constantly T , while it is compressed to such an extent that at the end of the fourth operation the temperature may be S. ( 4 .
) Let the air be farther compressed , and prevented from either gaining or parting with heat , till the piston reaches its primitive position .
The amount of mechanical effect gained on the whole of this cycle of operations will be the excess of the mechanical effect obtained by the first and second above the work spent in the third and fourth .
Now if P and V denote the primitive pressure and volume of the airsand if P1 and V1 , P2 and V2 , P3 and V3 , P4 and V4 denote the pressure and volume respectively , at the ends of the four successive operations , we have by the gaseous laws , and by POISSON'S formula and a conclusion from it quoted above , the following expressions Mechanical effect obtained by the first operation-PV log V ' Mechanical effect obtained by the second operation =P2V2 .

Also by POISSON'S formula , VIg1k -i 1 +ES kyl ) YIV 1 +ET By means of these we perceive that the work spent in the fourth operation is equal to the mechanical effect gained in the second ; and we find , for the whole gain of mechanical effect ( denoted by M ) , the expressions Vi V1~Y E ( S -T ) M=(PV-P3V3 ) log a-=PV log _ . ?
ES All the preceding formulae are founded on the assumption of the gaseous laws and the constancy of the ratio ( k ) of the specific heat under constant pressure to the specific heat in constant volume , for the air contained in the cylinder and piston , and involve no other hypothesis* .
If now we add the assumption of MAYER'S hypothesis , which for the actual circumstance is PV log Y'-JH , where I-I denotes the heat abstracted by the air from the surrounding matter in the first operation , and J the mechanical equivalent of a thermal unit , we have M=J11 E(S-T ) 1+ES The investigation of this formula given in my paper on the Dynamnical Theory of Heat , shows that it would be true for every perfect thermo-dynamic engine , if MAYER'S hypothesis were true for a fluid subject to the gaseous laws of pressure and density , whether , for such a fluid ( did it exist ) , k were constant or not .
It was first obtained by using , in the formula M =JHEI]7fT dFit , which involves no hypothesis , the expression qJ Ed for CARNOT'S function , which Ml ' .
JOULE had suggested to me in a letter dated December 9 , 1848 , as the expression of MAYER'S hypothesis , in terms of the notation of my " ; Account of CARNOT'S Theory .
* " Mr. RANKINE t has arrived at a formula agreeing with it ( with the exception of a constant term in the denominator , which , as its value is unknown , but probably small , he neglects in the actual use of the formula ) , as a consequence of the fundamental principles assumed in his Theory of Molecular Vortices , when applied to any fluid whatever , experiencing a cycle of four operations satisfying CARNOT'S criterion of reversibility ( being in fact precisely analogous to those described above , and originally invented by CARNOT ) ; and he thus establishes CARNOT'S law as a consequence of the equations of the mutual conversion of heat and expansive power , which had been given in the first section of his paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat+ .

Let N be the specific heat of unity of weight of a fluid at the temperature t , kept within constant volume , v ; and let k/ N be the specific heat of the same fluid mass , under constant niessure , p. Without any other assumption than that of CARNOT'S principle , the following equation is demonstrated in my paper ?

We have consequently , for dry air , kN-N= 26215E2 ( 1 ) kN-N p.(1 +Et ) Now it is demonstrated , without any other assumption than that of CARNOT'S principle , in my " Account Of CARNOT'S Theory " ( Appendix III .

Hence HH kN-N=26215EXW=95P947XW ( 2 ) If we adopt the values of p shown in Table I. of the " 'Account of CARNOT'S Theory , " depending on no uncertain data except the densities of saturated steam at different temperatures , which , for want of accurate experimental data , were derived from the value 1 for the density of saturated vapour at 1000 , by the assumption of the 1693'5 " gaseous laws " of variation with temperature and pressure ; we find 1357 and 1369 E for the values of at the temperatures 0 and 100 respectively ; and hence , for these temperatures , ( t=O ) kN-N= 13597z=07071 ( t= 100 ) kN-N=9594.07(a ) 1369 =70 Or , if we adopt MAYER'S hypothesis , according to which W is equal to the mechanical equivalent of the thermal unitt , we have l= 1390 ; and hence , for all temperatures , 95.947 kN-= -06903.(a ' ) .

The very accurate observations which have been made on the velocity of sound in air , taken in connection with the results of REGNAULT'S observations on its density , &amp; c , lead to the value 1*410 for k , which is probably true in three if not in four of its figures .
Now , k being known , the preceding equations enable us to determine the absolute values of the two specific heats ( kN , and N ) according to ' the hypotheses used in ( a ) and in ( a ' ) respectively ; and we thus find , Specific heat of air under Specific heat of air in constant pressure ( kN ) .

By the adoption of hypotheses involving that Of MAYER , and taking 13896 and 1P4 as the values of J and k , respectively , Mr. RANKINE finds 22404 and 1717 as the values of the two specific heats .
Hence it is probable that the values of the specific heat of air under constant pressure , found by SUERMANN ( 3046 ) , and by DE LA RoCHE and BERARD ( 2669 ) , are both considerably too great ; and the true value , to two significant figures , is probably -24 .
