257 A few specimens of lead or flint glass were examined in the same way , and in this case a very marked connexion between electric con .
ductivity and density was observed .
This result was , however , no doubt due to the fact that the density of this kind of glass gives an indication of its chemical composition .
In all the specimens examined it was found that the higher the density the lower the conductivity .
The highest density reached , however , was that in the case of a Thomson 's electrometer jar , which had a density of 3T72 .
On examining these specimens for chemical composition it was found that the electrometer jar contained almost exactly the proper amount of lead and potash to form a trisilicate of potash and lead .
It appears likely , therefore , that the electric conductivity of glass is lowest when it is an exact chemical compound .
It will be interesting to learn from future experiments if still more dense glass has a higher conductivity , and if the conductivity passes a minimum at the point where the pure silicate is reached .
The author has to express his great obligation to his colleague , Dr. Edward Diver , in whose laboratory and under whose superintendence the chemical analyses of the specimens of glass were made .

The new cell consists of a flat copper case , of the same shape as a Grove 's cell ; it has a lid of paraffined wood , from which hangs a plate of lead amalgamated with mercury , the lower part of the lead plate being held in a groove in a slip of paraffined wood resting on the bottom of the copper case : through the lid a hole is bored for the introduction of the solution , which consists of a solution of cupric sulphate , to which is added one-twelfth of hydric sulphate ; the presence of this free sulphuric acid improves the cell at once .
The following sectional sketch shows the arrangement : , r\gt ; , t^ Mr. W. H. L. Russell [ Jan. 19 AB .
