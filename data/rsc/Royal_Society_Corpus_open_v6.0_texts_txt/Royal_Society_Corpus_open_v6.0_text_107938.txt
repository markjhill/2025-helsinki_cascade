An Account of the Construction and PVerjfication of a Copy of the Imperial Standard Yard made for the Royal Society .
By Captain HENRY KATER , F.R.S. Read May 19 , 1831 .
THE Royal Society having done me the honour to request that I would undertake the construction and verification of a copy of the Imperial Standard Yard for their use , it becomes necessary to place upon record the manner in which this was executed , in order that some judgement may be formed of the degree of confidence which may be placed in the result .
The scale in question is constructed in the manner which I have described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1830 * for diminishing the errors arising from the thickness of the bar upon which it has hitherto been customary to trace the divisions .
The support of the scale is of brass , forty inches long , 1inches wide , and y-ths of an inch in thickness .
A brass plate of seven hundredths of an inch thick was made to slide freely upon the support in a dovetail groove formed by two side plates , and was then fixed to the support by a screw passing through its middle .
This plate carries the divisions , which are fine dots upon gold disks let into the brass ; the scale is divided into inches , and there is one inch to the left of zero , which is subdivided into tenths .
The scale is the work of Mr. DOLLOND .
As the points designating the Imperial Standard Yard are upon a brass bar one inch in thickness , it was necessary to be extremely careful that the bar during the comparisons should be placed upon a surface as nearly as possible plane ; since it has been shown in the paper before alluded to , that a curvature of which the versed sine is only one-hundredth of an inch in a yard would occasion a variation in the length of this standard amounting to nearly fivethousandths of an inch .
The marble slab formerly used was employed on the present occasion .
Its surface was examined by Ineans of a wire , the diameter of which was onehundredth of an inch , stretched by a bow with a force of about four pounds ; but as this wire would suffer a deflexion by its own weight amounting to about four-thousandths of an inch , a wire of two-hundredths of an inch diameter was placed at each extremity of the marble slab , and the wire of the bow resting upon these ; the distance of its middle point from the surface of the marble was found to be a little less than two-hundredths of an inch , estimated by passing beneath it a wire of one-hundredth of an inch in diameter .
The marble slab being sixty-four inches long , its surface may therefore , perhaps for the extent of a yard , be considered as sufficiently approximating to a plane ; and I may here remark that no new adjustment of the slab was found to be necessary , as its position appeared to have undergone no change since my last measurements .
The scale was placed upon the marble slab near the Imperial Standard Yard , and the comparisons were always made about nine o'clock in the morning , in order to ensure as far as possible an equality of temperature in the scale and the Standard Yard .
It will be seen that seldom more than three comparisons were taken on the same morning , lest the proximity of the person of the observer might destroy the equality of temperature .
The microscopic apparatus used on the present occasion is that which was employed in the comparison of various British standards of linear measure , an account of which is given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1821 , and the mode pursued in making the comparisons was the same as that which I have there detailed .
The value of one division of the micrometer is =.0000428742 of an inch .
As the microscopes invert , an increase in the readings indicates a corresponding deficiency in the length of the scale .
