nicated by Professor Horsley , F.R.S. Received February 21 , 1894 .
As is well known , the injection of a solution of peptone into the circulation of certain animals is followed immediately by a very considerable diminution in the number of white blood corpuscles in the circulating blood .
Some investigators who have written on this subject ascribe this diminution to the destruction and breaking down of the leucocytes in the blood plasma .
As this theory appeared to me to rest on the very slenderest evidence , and as it seemed to me much moi'e natural to believe that a temporary withdrawal of the leucocytes into the internal organs took place , I was led to attempt the enumeration of the white blood corpuscles in sections of the various organs before and after the injection of peptone .
If the theory of destruction is true , then the leucocytes ought to be found in fewer numbers in the organs as well as in the blood , whereas , if the theory of temporary withdrawal be the true one , then an augmentation in their number should be seen in the sections .
For the purpose of this enumeration I used rabbits of equal weight , and proved to have a normal number of white blood corpuscles by examination of samples of blood taken from the ear .
Six rabbits were taken ; The organs of two of these were examined without previous injection of peptone .
The third , with a normal number of white blood corpuscles , was killed 3^ hours after the injection of the peptone solution , when |--ths of the white blood corpuscles had disappeared from the circulating blood .
The fourth , also having a normal number of white blood corpuscles , was killed 5 seconds after injection , when almost all the leucocytes had disappeared , at least from the blood of the heart .
; In the fifth and sixth a leucocytosis was first caused by the injection of appropriate fluids and the animals killed 5 seconds after the injection of peptone .
As it seemed to me impossible to be certain of recognising all the varieties of the leucocytes in sections of the organs , I restricted myself to enumerating what I know as the polynuclear variety , since this is the variety which disappears most completely from the blood \#166 ; after the injection of peptone and many other substances , and which can be very readily recognised in sections after appropriate staining .
296 Surgeon-Captain D. Bruce .
Disappearance of [ Mar. 15 ?
I may mention here that for practical purposes and without prejudice as to their origin , I adopt the classification of the leucocytes of the rabbit 's blood into four varieties :\#151 ; A. The Eosinophilous , constituting on an average 2 per cent , of the total leucocytes , with an irregular-shaped nucleus and large oval shaped granules , which stain readily in eosine .
B. The Polynuclear , 51 per cent. , with intensely staining polymorphous nucleus , having the appearance of several nuclei united by narrow thread-like processes , the protoplasm of the cell containing fine granules which also stain in eosine .
C. The Myelocytes , 16 per cent. Difficult in every case to rigidly separate from the fourth variety , but defined as mononuclear cells , the nucleus of which stains badly , and is surrounded by comparatively a large amount of non-granular protoplasm .
D. The Lymphocytes , 31 per cent. Mononuclear cells , little larger than a red blood corpuscle , with intensely staining nucleus and narrow rim of protoplasm .
The preliminary enumeration of the leucocytes in the blood of the ear or heart was made by diluting the blood 200 times with an 8 per cent , magnesium sulphate solution , to which sufficient gentian violet had been added to stain the white blood corpuscles , and not by estimating their proportion to the red blood corpuscles , which seems to me a most unsound method .
The number of white blood corpuscles in 300 squares of a Gower 's haemocytometer were then counted and this number multiplied by 333 , which gives approximately the number in a cubic millimetre .
Three samples of blood are taken , two of which are counted , and , if the counts are sufficiently close , an average made .
In the event of there being a marked discrepancy , the third sample is counted and an average of the two most alike taken , but , with care , it is seldom found necessary to use the third sample .
In regard to the fixing and hardening of the tissues for cutting , alcohol , Muller 's solution , Foa 's , and Flemming 's solutions were used , but the best results were obtained by fixing for twenty-four hours in Flemming 's strong solution , washing in running water for twenty-four hours , then through successive alcohols for forty-eight hours .
The tissues , after infiltration with paraffin , were cut as neatly as possible of the same thickness , and stained in various ways , the most successful results being got by staining for twenty-four hours in the Ehrlich-Biondi triple stain .
On taking the sections out of the stain I place them for a minute in a saturated solution of corrosive sublimate , as this seems in some way to prevent them becoming too much decolorised during the subsequent manipulations .
The white blood corpuscles contained in twenty fields of the micro1894 .

297 scope ( Zeiss ' 2 millimetres apochromatic , oil immersion , and 8 eve-piece ) were counted in each section , several of which were mounted from each organ , and , as will be seen , with very striking uniformity of results .
I shall now proceed to describe the results obtained in each experiment .
No. 1 .
Control Experiment.\#151 ; Rabbit , weight 2 kilos .
The blood from an ear-vein was found to contain 6500 leucocytes per cubic millimetre\#151 ; 0 per cent , eosinophilous , 34 per cent , polynuclear , 20 per cent , myelocytes , 46 per cent , lymphocytes\#151 ; of which 2210 were thus polynuclear .
The animal was now killed by a blow on the head and !
the organs at once removed .
Four sections of the spleen were found to contain 54 , 47 , 55 , and 54 polynuclear leucocytes respectively ( twenty fields of the microscope being counted in each specimen ) , the lung , 39 and 32 , and the , liver , 7 , 6 , and 7 .
It will be seen from the above enumerations that a remarkable uniformity was found to exist in the distribution of the polynuclear leucocytes in different sections of the same organ .
This , I may here mention , obtained throughout , not only in the control experiments , but also after the injection of peptone .
* ' No. 2 .
Control Experiment.\#151 ; Rabbit , 2 kilos .
The blood from an ear-vein was found to contain 3833 polynuclear leucocytes in each cubic millimetre .
Two sections of the spleen were counted and contained , in 20 fields , 62 and 74 respectively ; the lung , 35 and 41 ; I 7 liver , 5 and 6 .
No. 3 .
Control Experiment.\#151 ; To show that the blood contained in the right and left ventricles does not differ my *kedly from the blood f taken from an ear-vein in the number of leucocytes contained m the I cubic millimetre the following experiment was made:\#151 ; Rabbit , 2 kilos .
The blood from an ear-vein was found to contain 8500 leucocytes in each cubic millimetre .
After an hour the rabbit I was killed by a blow on the head , and the heart ligatured and re-I moved as soon after death as possible .
The blood of the right ventricle was found to contain 7200 leucocytes per cubic millimetre ; that of the left , 7500 .
The following experiment shows the number of polynuclear leuco-i cytes found in sections of the organs of an ordinary normal rabbit f after the leucocytes have been greatly diminished in the circulating i blood by the injection of peptone .
No. 4 .
Rabbit , 2 kilos .
Blood from the right ear contained 4015 !
polynuclear leucocytes .
Three and a half hours after the injection i into a vein of the left ear of 3*5 grams peptone , dissolved in 35 c.c. water , blood from the right ear only contained 1100 of the same variety .
Sections of the spleen prepared and examined in the same way as 298 Surgeon-Captain D. Bruce .
Disappearance of [ Mar. 15 , in Experiments 1 and 2 , contained 159 , 150,171 , and 168 polynuclear leucocytes in 20 fields of the four specimens examined ; the lung , 230 and 209 ; the liver , 38 and 35 respectively .
This experiment then shows a large increase in the number of the polynuclear leucocytes in the organs , as compared with what was found in the organs of the control animals .
But , as the injection of peptone causes not only a primary diminution but also a secondary augmentation in the number of leucocytes in the blood , it might be argued that this augmentation takes place at first in the organs , and that this might account for the increase found in Experiment No. 4 .
To meet this objection the following experiment was made :\#151 ; No. 5 .
Rabbit , 2 kilos .
Blood from ear contained 9200 leucocytes , of which 47 per cent , or 4424 , belonged to the polynuclear variety ; 20 c.c. of a 10 per cent , peptone solution were now rapidly injected into the left jugular vein , and the animal killed five seconds after the injection .
The blood contained in the heart was at once examined , that in the left ventricle being found not to contain a single leucocyte of any kind whatever ; that of the right only 166 per cubic millimetre , all told .
It must be noted , however , that the leucocytes do not disappear from all parts of the circulation with this marvellous rapidity , as Experiment No. 7 will show .
The organs in this case were also found to contain a great excess of polynuclear leucocytes : the spleen , 174 , 133 , and 149 ; the lung , 230 and 221 ; the liver , 12 and 14 .
I next tried the Effect of first causing a leucocytosis , and then driving the white blood corpuscles out of the blood by peptone , in the belief that some proportionate increase in the number of the polynuclear leucocytes in the organs might be found .
No. 6 .
Rabbit , weight 2 kilos .
Blood from ear contained 7800 leucocytes , of which 4290 belonged to the polynuclear variety .
Nineteen hours after the injection of 10 c.c. of a broth cultivation of anthrax , which had been sterilised by filtration through a Chamber-land filter , the number of leucocytes in the blood taken from the ear had increased to 17,600 , of which 11,264 were polynuclear .
20 c.c. of a 10 per cent , peptone solution were now injected into the jugular vein , and , five seconds afterwards , the animal killed .
Blood from the left ventricle contained no leucocytes ; that from the rig|B ventricle only 1500 per cubic millimetre .
The spleen sections contained 223 and 218 , the lung 251 and 247 , the liver 12 and 10 .
Experiment 7 .
Rabbit , 2 kilos .
The blood taken from an vein contained 14,300 white-blood corpuscles .
20 c.c. of a 10 per cent , peptone solution were injected into an 1894 .
] Leucocytes from the Blood after Injection 299 ear-vein , and , five seconds afterwards , the white-blood corpuscles in the opposite ear enumerated , when no diminution in their number was found .
Eighteen hours after the injection an intense leucocy-tosis was found to have become developed , no fewer than 184,500 white blood corpuscles being found in each cubic millimetre of blood drawn from the ear .
: Again , 20 c.c. of a 10 per cent , peptone solution were injected ; this time by the left jugular vein , and , five seconds afterwards , the animal killed .
The blood in the left ventricle contained 1000 white blood corpuscles per cubic millimetre , the right ventricle 3000 , and the inferior vena cava in the lumbar region 5000 .
Sections of the spleen contained 262 and 308 , the lung 435 , 325 , and 348 , and the liver 78 and 82 .
Presenting , for the sake of clearness , the above facts in a tabular form , an average of the various numbers being set down , the contrast is striking .

This may be accounted for by the fact that this organ is the first acted on by the peptone solution after its injection into the jugular vein .
Other organs , such as the kidney , supra-renals , and ovary , were found to contain so few leucocytes , either before or after the injection of peptone , that the results as regards them have been neglected .
I conclude from the above experiments that the injection of a solution of peptone into the circulation of rabbits does not cause , as has been asserted , a destruction of leucocytes , but merely a withdrawal of them into various organs , notably the lungs and spleen .
