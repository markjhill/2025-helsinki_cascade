MY DEAR SIR , -The results of the accompanying table for computing the dew-point from readings of the dryand wet-bulb thermometers , are , as I believe you know , derived from observations taken here during last winter by Mr. Campbell and myself : TABLE for computing the Dew-point from Readings of the Dryand Wet-Bulb Thermometers .

The dryand wet-bulb thermometers ( for which we were indebted to the kindness of Prof. Cherriman , Director of the Magnetic Observatory , Toronto ) were made by Negretti and Zambra , and their index errors were ascertained , above 32 ?
by Mr. Glaisher , and below 32 ?
by ourselves , by comparison with a Kew standard .
The divisions upon these thermometers were too small to read 0 ?
01 with great accuracy ; and in discussing our observations at low temperatures , we were in consequence obliged to reject such as would , with an error of 0 ? ?
1 in the reading , introduce a considerable error into the factor .
You will observe that the table does not extend below -16 ?
, although we have repeatedly every winter the mercury below -20 ?
, and occasionally below -30 ? .
The only thermometer , however , which we could trust as a wet-bulb in investigations so delicate was not graduated below -16 ? .
For obtaining the dew-point by direct observation , we used the condensing hygrometer invented by M. Regnault .
We obtained dew with this beautiful instrument at all temperatures ( limited only by the graduation of the thermometer -35 ?
) , the only requisites when the thermometer is very low being time and pure ether* .
I can testify from experience that this hygrometer obviates all the disadvantages of Daniell 's , which M. Regnault enumerates in his hygrometrical researches .
In order to show the reliance that may be placed upon our results , we have put opposite each factor in the table the probable error and measure of precision of the single data ( from which the factor ( f ) was derived ) , and also t1ke probable error , measure of precision , and limits of certainty of the adopted factor .
The nomenclature and notation are thus employed by Encke in his Memoir on the Method of Least Squares .
The measure of precision ( h ) , as was indeed to have been expected , decreases with the temperature .
This fact is not however of so much importance as might at first appear .
For the dew-point is given by the equation , -T'=t-f(t-ti ) , where ( T ) is the temperature of the dew-point , ( t ) that of the air , ( t-t ' ) the difference between the dryand wet-bulb thermometers , and ( f ) the factor whose value is given in the table .
Now taking the temperatures 42C and 22 ?
, it appears from the table that the probable error of ( f ) for a single observation is at the latter temperature three times greater than at the former .
But ( t--t ) is on an average about three times as great at 42 ?
as at 22 ? .
Hence the probable error of the dew-point at both temperatures is very nearly the same .
We have extended our table to 51 ?
for the purpose of comparison with the " Greenwich factors .
" I must however remark , that it is probable that the factors , which we have given above 40 ?
, are rather greater than they would have been had the observations discussed extended through a longer space of time , the majority at these temperatures having been taken last spring , when the air was very remarkably dry ; and experience shows that when ( t-t ' ) is unusually great , the deduced factor , instead of being more accurate , is generally much too large .
As an instance , I may cite an observation taken on April 29th , when the temperature of the air was 43 ?
'6 , that of evaporation was 31 ?
'6 , and that of the dew-point 3 ?
02 .
The fraction of saturation 19 on this occasion was -o , and the factor derived from this observation was 3'36 ; this being much the largest deviation from the adopted mean 2'53 .
The cause of this discrepancy is doubtless owing to the heat that the wet-bulb thermometer derives from the radiation of surrounding objects ; and were observations sufficiently numerous , it might conduce to accuracy were the factors calculated for every degree of difference in the value of ( t-t ' ) .
We purpose instituting a comparison between two wet-bulb thermometers placed in similar boxes , the one box coated with lampblack , the other with a polished metallic surface .
Below 32 ?
our results do not appear to coincide with the factors deduced from the Greenwich observations ; and the causes of these discrepancies I must leave to time .
As , however , we have had considerable experience at these temperatures , I may perhaps be doing service to observers in bringing before their notice two causes of error , to which we have found ourselves particularly liable when the thermometer is near 32 ? .
1st .
If the air is a little above , and has been below 32 ?
, there will frequently be a small button of ice at the foot of the wet-bulb thermometer , which is not easily perceived , and which will keep it at 320 when the temperature of evaporation is really above that point .
2ndly .
It is well known that under certain circumstances water may be cooled below 320 without freezing ; and an example will perhaps best show the error which this fact may occasion .
Let us suppose that the temperature of the air is 27 ?
, and that when the thermometer is wetted it sinks to 26 ?
, and then rises .
Should it rise very slowly , or not at all , the probability is that 260 is the true temperature of evaporation , but if rapidly , the rise may be due to the conversion of the water into ice ; and it will be prudent to observe whether or not the thermometer again commences to sink .
We have frequently observed this phenomenon , and I am quite at a loss to what to ascribe its uncertainty .
It has occurred both in a high wind and a calm ( the thermometers are protected from the full force of the wind ) , and it also appeared to be quite uncertain at what temperature the water might freeze .
I am obliged to admit that the limits of certainty of the factors below zero are not quite so close as could be desired .
This is partly attributable to our being obliged to reject many observations made with a thermometer which was broken before its index-errors were fully ascertained ; but Mr. Campbell and I must claim the indulgence of those who know the difficulty of taking observations requiring so much time and accuracy at such temperatures , and frequently at six o'clock in the morning .
