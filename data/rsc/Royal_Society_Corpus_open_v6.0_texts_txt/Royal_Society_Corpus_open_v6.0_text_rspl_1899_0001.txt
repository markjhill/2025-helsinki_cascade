Report of the Kew Observatory Committee .
I. Magnetic Observations .
The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout the year , and the usual determinations of the Scale Values were made .
in January .
_ The ordinates of the various photographic curves representing Declination , Horizontal Force , and Vertical Force were then found to be as follows :\#151 ; Declinometer : 1 cm .
= 0 ' 8''7 .
Bifilar , January 11th , 1898 , for 1 cm .
\#163 ; H = 0-00051 O.G.S. unit .
Balance , January 12th , 1898 , for 1 cm .
eV = 0-00050 C.G.S. unit .
Owing to the gradual secular change of declination , the distance between the dots of light upon the cylinder of the magnetograph had become too small for satisfactory registration , and it was found necessary to alter the position of the zero line .
From a similar cause it was also found necessary to re-adjust the balance of the vertical force magnetometer .
During the past year two magnetic storms , or periods of considerable disturoance of the needles , have been registered , the first on March 14-15 , the second on September 9-10 .
Hie extreme amplitude of the March disturbance was : horizontal force , 0-0050 C.G.S. unit ; vertical force , 0-0057 C.G.S. unit , and decimation , 1- 26 ' .
In eight minutes , from 10.40 to 10.48 p.m. on the 15th , the horizontal and vertical components exhibited falls of 0 002 and 0 00.\gt ; C.G.fe .
unit respectively .
The most rapid change of declination occurred some thirty minutes later .
Speaking generally , the most salient features were the large falls in both the horizontal and vertical components and the movement of the declination needle nearly 1 ' east of its normal position .
The second storm occurred on September 9\#151 ; 10 .
The principal disturbance commenced somewhat gradually about noon on the 9th , out one of its most striking features was an exceptionally rapid fall occurring simultaneously at 3.5 p.m. in the horizontal and vertical forces and in the westerly declination .
The fall was so rapid as to be shown somewhat indistinctly on the photographic traces , but it amounted to at least 15 ' in the declination and 0-0023 C.G.S. unit in the horizontal force .
The recovery from this fall was also rapid .
Ike declination needle , on the same day , between 5.15 p.m. and 8.8 p.m. receded 54 to the east , then turned and in the course of the next thirty-two minutes moved 59 ' to the west .
The horizontal force attained its extreme maximum and minimum at 2.42 p.m. and Report of the KewObservatory Committee .
8.30 p.M. respectively , the range amounting to [ ( \gt ; 0050 C.G.S. unit ( or about 1/ 37 of the whole component ) .
Between 7.30 and 8.30 p.M. , this element fell 0-0036 C.G.S. unit .
The vertical force reached its maximum about 6 P.M. , and its minimum about 8.30 p.m. , hut as the trace unfortunately got off the sheet near the minimum , it can only be said that the range of vertical force exceeded 0-0036 C.G.S. unit .
Both storms were presumably associated with the aurora simultaneously seen in the British Isles .
The March storm was the largest recorded since August , 1894 .
The hourly means and diurnal inequalities of the magnetic elements for 1898 , for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer Royal , will be found in Appendix I. A correction has been applied for the diurnal variation of temperature , use being made of the records from a Richard thermograph as well as of the eye observations of a thermometer placed under the Vertical Force shade .
The mean values at the noons preceding and succeeding the selected quiet days are also given , but these of course are not employed in calculating the daily means or inequalities .
The following are the mean results for the entire year:\#151 ; Mean Westerly Declination ... ... ... ... .

Observations of Absolute Declination , Horizontal Intensity , and Inclination have been made weekly , as a rule .
A table of recent values of the magnetic elements at the Observatories whose publications are received at Kew will be found in Appendix 1a to the present report .
In September Professor Luigi Palazzo of the Ufficio Centrale di Meteorologia , Rome , paid a visit to the Observatoiy for the purpose of comparing the Kew magnetic instruments and his own .
Dr. van Rijckevorsel also spent some time in the summer in making a further comparison between his magnetic instruments and those at Kew .
Mr. Hough , Fellow of St. John 's College , Cambridge , who has recently been appointed chief assistant at the Royal Observatory , Cape of Good Hope , visited the Observatory from August 18 to September 1 , in order to gain a knowledge of the method of observing with the Unifilar Magnetometer and Inclinometer .
At the request of Professor Moos , director of the Colaba Observatory , Bombay , copies of the horizontal force , the vertical force , Report of the Kew Observatory Committee .
and the declination curves for certain selected days during the years 1892 , 1893 , and 1897 have been made and forwarded to him .
Information on matters relating to various magnetic data has been supplied to Dr. von Bezold , Professor Milne , and Mr. Gray .
The Observatory has been visited by Dr. A. Schmidt , of Gotha , Professor Eschenhagen , of Potsdam , and Professor Liznar , of Vienna , members of the International Conference on Terrestrial Magnetism , which was held at Bristol in September .
In spring the unifilar magnetometer and dip circle , previously lent to the Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expedition , were put in order and lent to Mr. P. Baracchi , Acting Government Astronomer , Melbourne Observatory , for observational use in Australia and Hew Zealand , or in Antarctic exploration , as he might decide .
Later in the year an old dip circle was put in order at the cost of Sir George Newnes , and lent for the use of the Antarctic Expedition , under Mr. Borchgrevink .
It was also agreed that if Mr. P. Baracchi should be willing to transfer to Mr. Borchgrevink the unifilar magnetometer and dip circle referred to above , the Committee would raise no objection , provided Sir G. Newnes should become responsible for the safe return of the instruments .
A course of magnetic instruction was given to the two magnetic observers of Mr. Borchgrevink 's expedition , Mr. Colbeck and Mr. Bernacchi , the latter of whom had already practised the use of magnetic instruments at Melbourne Observatory .
II .
Meteorological Observations .
The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration of Atmospheric Pressure , Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb , Wind ( direction and velocity ) , Bright Sunshine , and Rain , have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year , and the standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records duly registered .
* The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly made , and these , as well as copies of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine , have been transmitted , as usual , to the Meteorological Office .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , data have been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the Institute of Mining Engineers , and the editor of ' Symons ' Monthly Meteorological Magazine .
' Electrograph.\#151 ; This instrument worked in a satisfactory manner till May , when the action markedly deteriorated .
Tests of the battery showed that its E.M.P. had fallen off considerably ; this was so far remedied by cleaning and recharging the top row of cells .
At Report of the Kero Observatory Committee .
5 the same time a new silk suspension was fitted to the needle of the electrometer , and the instrument generally overhauled , and a new scale determination was carried out , The records remained satisfactory until November , when the battery potential again began to fall off rapidly .
Between November 24 and 27 the whole sixty cells were cleaned and recharged with a satisfactory result , and on the latter date one-third of the cells were removed to contract the scale , in order to record high winter values , as explained in last year s Report .
qi On several occasions it had been noted that the electrometer needle had a tendency to " set " when the acid in the interior jar had been m use for some time .
This " setting " largely interfered with the freedom of the needle .
It has , however , been considerably reduced , by substituting a single platinum wire connection for the double gridiron form hitherto employed .
In May another portable electrometer , No. 80 , was purchased from White , of Glasgow ; it is furnished with some additions to the usua pattern , which experience at the Observatory suggested as likely to prove beneficial in reducing induction effects .
This electrometer has been used since , with the older instrument , White , No. 5d , in obtaining the scale value of the self-recording instruments , determinations being made on February 7 , April 1 , May 26 , June 16 , September 6 , and November 28 .
Inspections.\#151 ; In compliance with the request of the Meteorological Council , the following Observatories and Anemograph Stations have been visited and inspected Stonyhurst , Yarmouth , North Shields , Alnwick Castle , Fort William , Glasgow , Aberdeen , and Deerness ( Orkney ) , by Mr. Baker ; and Bad cliff e Observatory ( Oxford ) , Holy-head , Fleetwood , Armagh , Dublin , Valencia , Falmouth , and St. Mary 's ( Scilly Isles ) , by Mr. Constable .
III .
Seismological Observations .
The seismograph referred to in last year 's Report was delivered by Mr. R. Munro in March .
It is of Professor J. Milne 's " imfelt tremor " pattern , the motion recorded being that of a horizontal pendulum or boom with along period of vibration ( fifteen to eighteen seconds from rest to rest ) .
It is intended to measure the tilting of the ground along an east-west line , the boom itself lying due noith and south .
At the suggestion of Professor Milne , who visited the Observatory , the site selected for at least a temporary trial is in the basement , inside the double-walled wooden room , originally designed for pendulum observations , and sometimes used as a warm chamber for chronometers .
At first difficulties were encountered from wandering Report of the Kew Observatory Committee .
of the boom , which is still too liable to get off its pivot ; but the record has been , on the whole , satisfactory for the latter half of the year .
The following table gives particulars respecting the time of occurrence and amplitude in seconds of arc of the largest movements actually recorded:\#151 ; Date .

58-6 " 0*6 I he times deduced for the commencement of the above-mentioned earthquakes were 6 h. 47*6 m. , 8 h. 4*5 m. , and 1 h. 37 m. respectively .
Without special very careful experiments it would be difficult to say what is the probable error in fixing the precise times .
Independent measurements of the photographic trace may agree to 01 or 0 2 of a minute , but there is room for a certain amount of doubt as to the proper values to attribute to the time marks on the sheet .
In the case of the times of commencement of a disturbance the uncertainty is greater , because the movement may be initially infinitesimal , and because a tiny movement arising from a different source ( such movements being not uncommon ) might intervene .
IV .
Experimental Work .
l1og and Mist .
The observations of a series of distant objects , .referred to in previous Reports , have been continued .
A note is taken ot ' the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each observation hour .
Atmospheric Electricity.\#151 ; The comparisons of the potential , at the point where the jet from the water-dropper breaks up , and at a fixed station on the Observatory lawn , referred to in last year 's Report , have been continued , and the observations have been taken twice every month .
During October some simultaneous observations were made with Report of the Kew Observatory Committee .
the two portable electrometers , the one situated on the pillar m the warden the other at the same height on a tripod stand , at some \#166 ; distance in the park .
It is hoped that time will be found to repeat the experiments on sufficiently numerous occasions to allow some conclusions to be drawn . .
, , Aneroid Barometers.-The experiments referred to m the ast three " Reports " were continued in the early part of the year .
The results have been discussed by the Superintendent in a paper recently published in the Society 's ' Transactions .
Platinum Thermometry.\#151 ; The experimental work carried out a. the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at feevres oy Dr. J. A. Harker in co-operation with Dr. Chappuis has only just terminated .
It has comprised a careful comparison of certain platinum thermometers belonging to the Observatory with a gas thermometer belonging to the Bureau , over the range -30 O. to Dr. Harker brought back the platinum thermometers , resistance box , \lt ; \amp ; c. , to the Observatory late in December , and is about to be engaged in preparing the results for publication .
In view of this and other special thermometric work in contemplation , the Committee have temporarily secured the services of Dr. Harker in the capacity of special assistant to the Superintendent .
Experiments have been continued at the Observatory itself on the fixity of zero , and the general behaviour of platinum thermometers , which have shown , amongst other things , the expediency of carefully checking the behaviour of the " leads .
" Experimental work on the comparison of platinum and mercury thermometers has also been continued , and it is hoped that it will shortly be possible , utilising the results of Hr .
Harker 's work at Sevres , to issue certificates to high range mercury thermometers embodying the results of direct comparison .
Mercury Thermometry.\#151 ; The experiments on thermometeis of different kinds of glass made by Messrs. Powell and Sons , to which reference was made last year , have been continued , further thei-mometers are being made by Messrs. Powell , of a pattern suggested by the Superintendent , with which it is hoped to experiment at higher temperatures .

YI .
Rating of Watches and Chronometers .
The high standard of excellence to which attention has been drawn in previous Reports has been maintained .
Although the number of watches sent for trial this year is less than last year , yet the general average is as good , and 66 movements have obtained the highest possible form of certificate ( the class A , especially good ) , which involves the attainment of 80 per cent , of the total marks .
The 483 watches received were entered for trial as below- : For class A , 383 ; class B , 73 ; and 27 for the subsidiary trial .
Of these 17 passed the subsidiary test , 116 failed from various causes to gain any certificate , 55 were awarded class B , and 295 class A. ^ In Appendix III will be found a table giving the results of trial of the first 50 watches which gained the highest number of marks during the year .
The highest place was taken by Mr. S. Yeomans , Coventry , with a keyless going-barrel , Karrusel lever-watch , No. 76,152 , which obtained 89'2 marks out of a maximum of 100 .
Representations having been made to the Committee that some changes were desirable in the system of marks and dates on certificates , a circular was issued ( as mentioned in last years Report ) to ascertain the general opinion of manufacturers and others interested in the matter , but the replies received showed no unanimity of opinion in favour of any one specified change , whilst a considerable number were quite satisfied with the existing conditions .
Finally some small alterations were made , mainly in matters of detail .
The objection to the certificates that sustained most suppoit though even on this question opinions were fairly divided was that the date suggested to the customer , in the case of any but the most recently tested watch , a line of criticism that would not naturally have presented itself .
In consequence it was urged that the possession of a 10 Report of the KewObservatory Committee .
Kew certificate was a very doubtful advantage to any watch remaining unsold for several years in a retailer 's hands .
The Committee could not see their way to alter the invariable practice of dating Kew certificates , but they agreed , in order to minimise the source of complaint , that a watch tested at the Observatory not less than three years previously , should be admitted to a fresh trial at half the usual fee .
i)Icnine Chronometers .
During the year , 70 chronometers have been entered for the Kew A and B trials ; of these 33 gained certificates , 21 failed , and there are 16 in hand .
1 he new cold-air chamber , to which a preliminary reference was made in last year 's Report , has been completed , and has proved very convenient .
It consists of three separate divisions , each isolated from the others , and separated by a 3-inch space packed with flake charcoal , this same packing being continued on all sides of the divisions , the size over all being 6\#163 ; ft. by 6| ft. by 3 ft. The centre chamber , 3 ft. by 3 ft. by 2 ft. , is fitted with sliding-racks for the chronometers , and the division on either side is for the ice .
This is supplied in blocks , which rest on boards , and drain away into a trap and gulley .
The chronometer chamber is furnished with trays to hold potassic chloride fox* drying- purposes , and with maximum and minimum thei-mometers .
The doors are packed with flake charcoal , and ai*e so ai*i*anged that the ice stores can be filled or emptied without any disturbance of the chronometer chamber .
VII .
Miscellaneous .
Taper .
Prepared photographic paper* has been supplied to the Observatories at Hong Kong , Mauritius , Oxford ( Radcliffe ) , and btonyhurst , and through the Meteorological Office to Aberdeen , Port William , and Valencia .
* Anemograph and Sunshine Sheets have also been sent to Hong Kong and Mauritius .
Gas Thermometer.\#151 ; Sir Andrew Noble , K.C.B. , having genex-ously offei-ed to present a gas thermometer- to the Observatory , and to defray the cost of sending an assistant to Berlin to study the method of using a similar instrument at the Reichsanstalt , at Charlotten-burg , the Committee gladly accepted the gift .
The construction of the instrument has not yet been completed .
Pendulum Observations.\#151 ; In July Mr. P. Laurin and another* officer of the Royal Austrian Navy swung half second pendulums in the sextant room on the spot where observations were made some years \amp ; g ' by von Sterneck .
Report of theKew Observatory Committee .
Electric Tramways\#151 ; During the year a variety of schemes have been promoted for applying electric traction on the trolley system to tram lines in the neighbourhood of the Observatory , and one of these schemes , promoted by the London United Tramway Company , for a new line between Kew Bridge and Hounslow , passing within 1,300 yards of the Observatory , has received the sanction of Parliament .
The Committee , roused by the fate that has befallen the magnetic observatories at Toronto and Washington , requested Professor Rucker and Professor Perry to take the matter in hand .
A series of experiments made at various places in London and Leeds , under the general supervision of Professor Rucker , showed that electric railways and tram ways , satisfying presumably all the existing requirements of the Board of Trade , produced very sensible disturbances in a declinometer at distances of two or three miles .
This fact was brought before the notice of the Royal Society , who in turn entered into communication with the Board of Trade , with the result that the following clauses were inserted in the London United Tramway Company 's Bill:\#151 ; 1 .
The whole circuit used for the carrying of the current to and from the carriages in use on the railway shall consist of conductors , which are insulated along the whole of their length to the satisfaction in all respects of the Commissioners of Her Majesty 's Works and Public Buildings ( in this section called the " Commissioners " ) , and the said insulated conductors which convey the current to or from any of such carriages shall not at any place be separated from each other by a distance exceeding one-hundredth part of the distance of either of the conductors at that place from Kew Observatory .
2 .
If .
in the opinion of the Commissioners , there are at any time reasonable grounds for assuming that , by reason of the insulation or conductivity having ceased to be satisfactory , a sensible magnetic field has been produced at the Observatory , the Commissioners shall have the right of testing the insulation and conductivity upon giving notice to the Company , who shall afford all necessary facilities to the engineer or officers of the Commissioners , or other person appointed by them for the purpose , and the Company shall forthwith take all such steps , as shall in the opinion of the Commissioners be required for preventing the production of such field .
3 .
The Company shall furnish to the Commissioner 's all necessary particulars of the method of insulation proposed to be adopted , and of the distances between the conductors which carry the current to and from the carriages .
It is understood that the above clauses will be insisted on by the Boai 'd of Trade in the case of any other tram line which can be shown to be a probable source of danger to the Observatory .
Report of the Kew Observatory Committee .
The Committee are much , indebted to Professor Rucker and Professor Perry for the trouble they have taken in the matter , and they are also glad to express their acknowledgment of the valuable assistance rendered by the editors of scientific journals and various eminent men of science in educating public opinion .
The Committee-even hope that ere long tramway companies themselves will recognise the benefits accruing from improved insulation .
Whilst everything has been done , as far as can be foreseen , to protect the magnetographs , it is impossible to contemplate the future without some misgivings .
.A ationalPhysical Laboratory .
\#151 ; The Government Committee , lefened to in last years Report , visited the Observatory on January 18th .
In the course of the summer , that Committee submitted to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty 's Treasury a report , embodying the following four recommendations:\#151 ; 1 .
That a public institution should be founded for standardizing and ' mfifying instruments , for testing materials , and for the deteiunination of physical constants .
2 .
That the institution should be established by extending the Kew Observatory in the Old Deer Park , Richmond , and that the scheme should include the improvement of the existing buildings , and the erection of new buildings at some distance from the present Observatory .
3 .
That the Royal Society should be invited to control the proposed institution , and to nominate a Governing Body , on which commercial interests should be represented , the choice of the members of such Body not being confined to Fellows of the Society .
4 .
That the Permanent Secretary of the Board of Trade should be an ex officio member of the Governing Body ; and that such Body should be consulted by the Standards Office and the Electrical Standardizing Department of the Board of Trade upon difficult questions that may arise from time to time or as to proposed modifications or developments .
In October , the Royal Society informed the Kew Observatory Committee that the Government had adopted the report generally , and were willing to provide funds for carrying it into effect ; consequently the Royal Society asked for the concurrence of the Kew Observatory Committee in their action .
In reply , the Committee expressed their willingness to facilitate the execution of the scheme , and to continue to administer the Observatory pending the nomination of the new Governing Body .
The arrangements were not completed before the close of 1898 .
Library.\#151 ; During the year the library has received publications from Report of the Kew Observatory .
13 20 Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and Ireland , 93 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments , as well as from several private individuals .

Magnetical Observations , 1898 .
Made at the Kew Observatory , Old Deer Park , Richmond , Lat. 51 ' 28^ 6 ; / N. and Long. 0h lm 15s'l W. The results given in the following tables are deduced from the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations of deflection and vibration .
These were made with the Collimator Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow , No. 33 , and needles 1 and 2 , which are 3\#163 ; inches in length .
The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing Magnetic Observations .
The following is a list of the days during the year 1898 which were selected by the Astronomer Royal , as suitable for the determination of the magnetic diurnal inequalities , and which have been employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables:\#151 ; January ... ... ... . .
