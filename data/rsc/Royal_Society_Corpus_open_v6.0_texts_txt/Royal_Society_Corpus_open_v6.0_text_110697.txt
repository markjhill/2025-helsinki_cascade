" The inner surfaces of a flue built of siliceous bricks appeared to be deeply eroded by the passage over it of steam at a very high temperature , and fragments of siliceous materials laid in the course of the current were partially consumed .
A siliceous crust was de ?
posited on several vessels of stone ware , coated with a micaceous glaze , placed in the upper part of the furnace , and this crust was re-dissolved when the vessels were removed to a hotter situation in the same furnace .
The author notices the experiments of Dr. Turner and others , which failed in showing the solubility of silica by steam , in consequence , as he conceives , of the heat having not been sufficiently great to effect the solution .
