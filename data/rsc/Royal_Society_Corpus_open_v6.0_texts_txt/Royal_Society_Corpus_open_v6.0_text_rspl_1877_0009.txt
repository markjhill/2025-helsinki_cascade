( 7 ) This equation shows that the moves away from the mass , and that this mass is most ective t the latitude of 3 .
In order to apply the to the case of our actual continents and oceans , we integrate ( 7 ) long the idian as follows , here radius of earth , longitude , latitude , height of colltinent or depth sea above or below the zero plane .
Hence we have and lly . . .
( 8 ) The zero plane , from which is measured , is the of the ellipsoid to the -surface , and in the same volume as the total soJid of the globe .
It is thus found : assuming the height the colltinents above the sea-level at about 1000 feet , the mean depth of the ocean at about two miles , we have , in miles , 2 .

The zero , therefore , or original of the solid earth before it became wrinlrled by geological forces , lies at a depth of foot below the sea-level .
In using equation ( 8 ) we must mile ( contin ) . .

[ Mar. In calculating the motion of the pole caused by the ocean excavatious , the weight of the ater must be considered , and , by chance , it happens that the weight of the sea-water somewhat more than counterbalances the weight of the surface-rock excavated ; so that the depression of the ocean-surfaces of the earth beneath the zero phne have had little or no effect in shifting the position of the pole .
Assuming and as the densities of sea-water and surfacerock , we have for the excess of weight of water added above that of rock excavated , expressed in depth of rock , in miles , miJe .
The introduction of the weight of tho sea will thus give us ( raising the zero plane by of a mile ) mile ( continent ) , , , ( ocean ) .

61 be noticed that although the excavation of the sea-bottom to its present depth below the zero plane , corrected for the weight of the ocean , pro- duces no motion in the pole , yet that the depression of a continent down to the zero plane produces a motion of pole equal and opposite to that produced by its elevation .
