( Abstract .
) In this paper the sun-pictures taken by the Kew photoheliograph for the years 1862 and 1863 are discussed ; the heliographic latitude and longitude of every spot is given , and the area of each group on each day when it was observed is expressed in millionth parts of the sun 's whole hemisphereal area .
The Kew photoheliograph itself , as well as the instrument invented by Mr. De la Rue for measuring sun-pictures , have been already described by Mr. De la Rue in the Bakerian Lecture for 1862 .
These descriptions are not therefore repeated in this paper ; but , on the other hand , the method by which the heliographic position of spots is deduced from the measurements made is given at considerable length .
The results of succeeding years , and their final discussion with reference to the sun 's elements , will be published hereafter .
