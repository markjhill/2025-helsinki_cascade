The Appulses of the Shadow to the Spot Tycho were observed with a Reflecting Telescope , which magnified about 40 times , and may be serviceable for geographical Purposes .
The Beginning and End of the Eclipse were estimated by the bare Eye , and a Refracting Telescope of a small magnifying Power ; larger Powers being apt to dilute the Shadow too much , and thereby render these Phases more uncertain .
