Not seen in spectroscope , though every precaution was taken to secure direction and focus .
It is almost impossible that this can have a bright line spectrum , or it must have been seen .

A good instance of the extreme difficulty of finding a continuous spectrum object .
I was enabled to find this one by the help of a neighbouring star , whose spectrum was [ June 18 , 45 easily found ; but even in the field the faint light could only just be recognized .

Linear spectrum seen , though too faint for measurement , even for absolute certainty of its character .
The light seen , however , was too strictly LOCAL to belong to a continuous spectrum of so faint an object , but that is the whole of the evidence .

" Very remarkable ; bright ; extremely large ; extremely irregular figure .
" ] I should say this is as bright an object as any of the larger nebulae T have seen .
It is a striking object ( detailed account of appearance and sketch ) , and the various parts could be recognized as they were brought on the slit .

[ " Planetary ; bright ; very small ; round .
" ] Iam rather surprised to find this described as " bright , very small ; " I should have expected very bright , pretty large .
Its spectrum is the first in which I have suspected a new character .
In the first place , there is no trace of a third line , and the second is more uncertain , as though there were more than one fainter companion .
The brightness of the principal line is considerable , making measurements by estimation behind the wires in a dark field not very difficult .
The following measures are , I believe , 3'32 4}62 trustworthy : D= 32 2-32 , Neb. line= 4 66 4-64 .
In the second place , therefore , here is a reliable measurement , differing widely from the rest ( too widely , as I think , 454 [ June 18 , for an accident ) , but agreeing closely with one other ( 4390 ) , in which the third line is only " suspected .
" Both must of course be remeasured .
This is the first planetary nebula I have seen in the " finder .
" Can it have changed its character since ?
[ Note.-With four exceptions , Nos. 1843 , 2076 , 1565 , 1801 ( all between 7h &amp; lh R.A. ) , the whole of the bright planetary nebulae between 80 ?
and 150 ?
N.P.D. have now been examined .
