] This ore was found in the Herland mine , about six miles from St. Michael 's Mount in Cornwall .
It consists chiefly of lodes of copper , of which several run nearly in a parallel direction from east to west .
The peculiarity here is , that there are several cross courses which run north and south , the greatest part of which contain no metal : these meeting with the lodes of copper ore , interrupt their continuity , or , as is expressed by the miners , heave them out of their direction , so that at the place of intersection the copper lodes seem to have been forced aside eighteen or twenty inches .
One of these cross courses has of late been discovered to yield silver in no inconsiderable quantity ; but with this particular circumstance , that at and near the place of intersection the ores both of silver and copper are much less productive than at some distance from it .
The silver ore consists of a mixture of galena , native bismuth , gray cobalt , vitreous silver , and native silver chiefly in a capillary form .
