Introduction .
The experiments described by one of ns in another paper have established that the necessary condition for the chemical reactions between nitric acid and the metals copper , mercury , and bismuth , is the presence and continuous formation of nitrous acid .
These results confirm the previous observations of Bussell in the case of the metal silver .
Further , it has been shown that when these metals are introduced into purified nitric acid , no apparent change takes place at first , but after some time gas bubbles are seen to rise from the surface of the metal , and the liquid then contains an amount of nitrous acid which can be detected by the more delicate reagents .
The amount of this acid increases up to a maximum and constant point , while concomitantly the amount of metal dissolved per unit of time equally increases to a maximum and constant value .
It seemed , therefore , desirable to ascertain if these phenomena determined by the balance are correlated with any alteration of electromotive force .
To avoid any misunderstanding , however , it would be advisable at the outset to state that this paper is separated from that of one of us " On the Condition of Chemical Change between certain Metals and Nitric Acid , " rather on account of division of labour than of difference of subject .
The idea of measuring the electromotive force of cells consisting of platinum , certain metals , and nitric acid occurred to the latter of us , while the apparatus and method of measurement finally adopted are due solely to the former .
Previous Investigations .
Many years ago Faraday* pointed out that neither nitrogen peroxide nor nitric acid are conductors when pure , but that the addition of water to the former , or of nitrous acid to the latter , produces the property of conductivity " in a very high degree among electrolytes .
" Thus the presence of nitrous acid is the necessary * ' Experimental Researches , ' series xvi .
, 1815-1818 .
20,6.91 condition that nitric acid should become an electrolyte .
Again , Faraday* proved that the electric position of certain pairs of metals in nitric acid is varied according to the conditions of concentration and temperature ; in fact , experiments on this point were considered by him to be of especial importance in confirming the chemical and disproving the contact theory of the voltaic cell .
Poggendorff gives one determination of the E.M.F. of a cell consisting of copper , nitric acid ( sp. gr. = 1*222 , with nine times its volume of water ) , and platinum ; the value found , taking the E.M.F. of a Daniell 's cell at 1070 millivolts , is calculated out as 660 millivolts .
Thomsen+ alludes to the various reactions occurring in the combinations zinc / H2SO4,100 H20/ fuming nitric acid/ carbon , as also zinc/ H2S04,100 H20/ HN03 , 7H20 / carbon ; the chemical changes taking place in these cells are shown to vary with the concentration of the acid and the chemical energy produced .
In the latter cell there is a reduction of the hydrate of nitric acid to nitrogen peroxide , which dissolves without evolution of gas , but with more dilute acid nitric oxide is formed and evolved .
The E.M.F. observed of these combinations is substantially in accord with that calculated from the chemical energy developed , expressed in heat units , an agreement which , as Armstrong has pointed out , is the more remarkable considering the gradual accumulation of the products of decomposition of the nitric acid within it , and the effects liable to be produced thereby .
Ostwald , | in the course of his investigations on contact electricity , measured the difference of potential between metals and aqueous solutions of various electrolytes by the dropping electrode method ; amongst other results he gives values for the E.M.F. of certain metals in nitric acid of three different degrees of concentration .
He regards , however , his determinations as uncertain , as the metals were strongly attacked by the acid liquid .
But in all these investigations no especial care seems to have been taken to purify the nitric acid from the nitrous acid , which is almost invariably present , neither are details given as to any variation of E.M.F. , conditions of temperature and concentration remaining the same .
These variations form the principal subject of the present enquiry .
Preliminary Experiments .
Certain preliminary experiments made with the aid of a quadrant electrometer showed that the E.M.F. of a copper-platinum couple dipping in nitric acid of 28 per cent , concentration gradually increased from the moment of contact of the metal with the acid for about two minutes , when it reached its maximum value .
But if a small trace of a nitrite were added to the pure nitric acid this maximum E.M.F. was reached * ' Experimental Researches , ' series xvii .

OF THE E.M.F. OF CERTAIN METALS IN NITRIC ACID .
at the moment of immersion of the metals ; while , on the other hand , the addition of a small trace of urea caused this phenomenon of the increase of E.M.F. to be delayed for a greater interval of time .
This method , however , presented the disadvantage , that , owing to the long period of the vibrations of the needle of the quadrant electrometer , the E.M.F. could not conveniently be determined at the very moment of immersion of the metals .
It was , therefore , thought desirable to construct some form of apparatus , which should permit of immediate measurement , and should also ensure that no current passed in the galvanic cell , whereby the proportion of nitrous acid and , consequently , the E.M.F. might be increased .
It was decided to use the capillary electrometer , as the quickest in its action of all instruments for measuring differences of potential ; secondly , to balance the E.M.F. of the platinum-copper couple from first to last against a difference of potential , which could be varied at will , and its amount at any given moment automatically recorded ; and , finally , to interpolate in the circuit a resistance sufficiently great to make the movements of the mercury of the electrometer sluggish to some degree , so as to minimise the quantity of electricity which would pass while the operator was balancing the E.M.F. of the cell , and at the same time to preserve the instrument from damage .
The Apparatus .
In balancing the E.M.F. of the experimental cell a rheochord ( fig. 1 ) , designed by one of us , was employed .
A , A ' is a German silver wire 4*5 metres long , and of 20 ohms resistance , which is soldered by the middle to the brass yoke B , the resistance of which is practically zero .
The two ends of the wire are attached to springs C , C7 , which keep it stretched , and through these to the terminals D , D7 .
The yokes , springs , and terminals are cemented to varnished glass pegs in the wooden trough E , which is at the same time the baseboard and the box of the instrument .
Two stouter wires , F , F ' , insulated from each other and parallel to A , A ' , are attached in a similar manner to the terminals G , G7 .
A heavy rider , H , carries two pairs of spring jaws , made also of German silver , which pinch the wires so as to make electrical connection between A and F and between A7 and F7 .
Two Daniell s cells are connected with the terminals D and D7 , and the terminals G and G7 of the derived circuit are connected with the platinum-copper couple through the electrometer .
The difference of potential thus introduced to balance the E.M.F. of the experimental cell is proportional ( errors of calibration excepted ) to the distance of the rider H from the yoke-piece B. The edge of the trough E is graduated in millimetres , so that the position of the rider can be read off .
The movement of the rider during an experiment is automatically recorded as follows :\#151 ; mdcccxci.\#151 ; a. 2 t Fig. 1 .
The rlxeochord .
OF THE E.M.F. OF CERTAIN METALS IN NITRIC ACID .
On the end of the trough E , which for this purpose is fixed in a vertical position , is a flanged wheel , M , 7'5inches in diameter , on which is wound a thin gut line attached to the rider .
Another line , with a counterpoise , is also wound on the same wheel so that the rider may be kept , by the slight friction of its jaws on the rheochord wire , in any position in which it may be placed .
On the axle of the wheel is a flat-bottomed groove , N , '75 inch in diameter , on which also a gut line is wound in such a manner that the weight , P , attached to it may rise when the rider is pushed downward and vice versa , the movement of the weight , P , being only one-tenth of that of the rider .
The weight works in a slide , ft , attached to the lid of the box or trough , which is held open when in use by the clamps by which the instrument is fastened to the bench .
The weight , P , carries a light arm , on the end of which is a style for the purpose of writing on the smoked paper upon the recording-cylinder , T , which is driven by clockwork in the usual manner .
Thus the position of the rider throughout each experiment is recorded on a diminished scale .
The Standard of Electromotive Force .
The standard of E.M.F. to which all the measurements were ultimately referred was a Clark 's cell , made up according to the directions given by Lord Bayleigh.* The form adopted was a |J-shape , the limb containing the mercury being of a greater diameter than that of the limb containing the zinc pole ; in fact , the cell was made of a disused pipette , one end of which was cut off and the delivery tube bent round .
It was supported by passing the limbs through a cork fitted with a wide-mouthed bottle , and this was filled with water in which a thermometer was immersed .
It was thought that the temperature of the cell could thus be more easily ascertained and would be less liable to variation .
Before and after each experiment the Daniell 's cells were balanced against the Clark 's cell and the position of the rider noted .
It has been shown by one of us that , with a capillary electrometer arranged in this way , the quantity of electricity allowed to pass in the process of balancing need never be more than sufficient to charge '25 microfarad to '005 volt .
The Capillary Electrometer .
The capillary electrometer was of the form introduced by one of us , and gave a measurable excursion with a difference of potential of '001 volt.t The working pressure was about 6'5 cms .
of mercury , and the meniscus was very rapid in its movements .
A micrometer scale was used in the eye-piece of the observing microscope to ensure accuracy in balancing the E.M.F. , and connection was made with the circuit by a double-make key which was closed only at the moment of the observation .

t A more sensitive instrument would have been unmanageable .
The Interpolated Resistance .
The resistance interpolated in the circuit to prevent damage to the electrometer was a streak of graphite upon ground glass .
By a simple arrangement the effective length of the streak could be adjusted , varying the resistance from zero to about a million ohms .
In practice , 750,000 ohms was found to be ample .
It may be noted that even this amount of resistance does not affect the sensitiveness of the electrometer if the insulation is good , but simply makes the movement of the mercury slower .
The Materials Used .
The purest electrotype copper procurable , and metallic silver of the degree of purity known as test metal , were supplied to us by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey ; for the mercury , which had been distilled twice in vacuo , we are indebted to Mr. F. J. Smith .
The nitric acid was purified according to the method described by one of us ; it was sufficiently free from nitrous acid to give no colouration with metaphenylene diamine ; the proportion of this impurity was , therefore , probably less than one part in two or three millions .
For each separate experiment the metallic strips were thoroughly washed and cleansed , the success of the experiments depending upon the care bestowed on this point .
The Experimental Cell .
The copper and the platinum strips were fixed vertically in insulated brass screw-clamps , the lower end of each strip passing through a glass tube and projecting about a centimetre beyond it , the purpose of this arrangement being to prevent the possibility of the strips coming in contact with one another , or of the acid with the clamps .
An ebonite bar which carries the clamps slides freely on a rod , and is prevented from twisting on it by a guide rod , at the top of which is a catch to fix the bar wffiile everything is being prepared .
On the rod is an adjustable stop to regulate the depth to which the copper and platinum strips can be immersed .
The acid is contained in a beaker enclosed in a jacket supplied with water , the temperature of which remained constant in the interval of time required for an experiment .

The Method of Experiment .
The method of conducting an experiment was as follows :\#151 ; The copper and platinum strips were fixed in the clamps , and the beaker containing the acid placed beneath them .
The rider of the rheochord was then set as nearly as possible in the position in which the E.M.F. of the derived circuit would balance the initial E.M.F. of the experimental cell , this having been determined by a preliminary experiment ; the driving-clock was set going at such a rate as would bring the expected duration of the more important part of the experiment well within one revolution of the recording cylinder .
At a given signal , one operator released the catch , and the bar carrying the clamps was dropped , suddenly immersing the metal strips in the acid .
At the same instant the other observer pressed the contact key of the electrometer , which had up to that time been short-circuited and disconnected .
If there was any movement of the mercury , he brought it back to zero as quickly as possible by shifting the rider of the rheochord up or down as might be required .
If , however , the position of the rider had been well chosen , there was no movement of the meniscus of the mercury , which remained at zero for a longer or shorter time , till the E.M.F. of the experimental cell began to rise .
When this took place , the difference of potential derived from the rheochord being no longer sufficient to balance it , the meniscus commenced to move slowly down .
The movement was checked by drawing the rider gently down , and thus increasing the balancing E.M.F. ; and this was continued so long as the electrometer showed any change , the level of the mercury being kept constantly at zero .
When the E.M.F. of the experimental cell had become steady it was disconnected , and the standard cell put into the circuit instead by means of the switch .
The rider was shifted until the E.M.F. of the standard cell was exactly balanced by that of the rheochord circuit , and its position was noted.* A line was next marked round the cylinder corresponding to some known position of the rider , generally at 1000 mm. , and a series of short marks , corresponding to intervals of 100 mm. , was added to serve as a scale of reference .
In addition to the record on the drum , the position of the rider was read off on the scale attached to the rheochord at the beginning and end of each experiment .
The curves were measured by a sliding T ruler , the vertical portion of which was graduated in millimetres and ended in a point , the zero of the scale , while the horizontal portion was provided with a vernier graduated into fifths of a millimetre .
* If the rider is set at 1438 mms .
, and the standard cell balanced by altering the resistance of the battery circuit , the rheochord readings are in decimals of a \#166 ; volt .
OF THE E.M.F. OF CERTAIN METALS IN NITRIC ACID .
Thus the height of the curve above any arbitrary base line could be determined for each second of time , and by means of the recorded data the scale-readings could be directly converted into millivolts , the value of the Clark 's cell being taken as 1*438 volt .
Copper j Nitric Acid / Platinum .
In the earlier experiments the platinum and copper strips were heated vacuo , to eliminate traces of occluded gases ; but in the later experiments , as the required apparatus was not available , this precaution was omitted .
In the succeeding Table the values are given for each interval of five seconds ( unless there was no alteration ) from the moment of immersion of the copper-platinum strips in the acid .

do not represent the maximum attainable , as our subsequent experience showed that this is only reached after the lapse of a number of minutes .
It will be seen , not only from these results , but more clearly from the recorded curve , that the initial E.M.F. of the cell Pt / HN03 dil .
/ Cu , under these conditions is at first very small , and that it rises at first slowly , then more or less rapidly , and finally very slowly until it becomes nearly constant .
This last stage is necessarily very protracted as the curve more nearly approaches its asymptote ; thus , in the results given in Table II .
the alteration of E.M.F. during the last two minutes was only 19 millivolts .
It is also worthy of note in these and succeeding experiments that although the general shape of the curve representing the rise of E.M.F. is fairly regular , yet indications are not wanting that there are minor irregularities in the rise , which may be described as secondary oscillations .
The explanation of this almost unique case of an increase of E.M.F. is doubtless as follows : the E.M.F. at the start is that ( or nearly so ) of the combination platinum / nitric acid / copper , while that at the conclusion is that of the combination platinum / nitrous acid / copper .
The rate of rise is due , other conditions remaining the same , to the number of molecules of nitric converted into nitrous acid .
If the containing vessel was not perfectly clean , if the strip of copper contained a trace of oxide , or even was touched with the finger , or if the strip of platinum was moistened with a drop of liquid used in a previous experiment , then the rise of E.M.F. was almost instantaneous .
The initial value depends upon the degree upon which these conditions of purity have been fulfilled , and also upon the success attending the somewhat difficult process of the purification of the nitric acid .
If , then , this alteration of E.M.F. is dependent upon the conversion of nitric to nitrous acid , the presence of a substance , such as urea , which would destroy the nitrous acid , would cause the phenomenon to be protracted .
Accordingly an experiment was conducted under precisely the same conditions as before , except that *25 grin , of urea was added to the 25 c.c. of nitric acid .

OF THE E.M.F. OF CERTAIN METALS IN NITRIC ACID .
On comparing the results given in Tables II .
and III .
, it will be evident that in the latter case a much greater interval of time is required before the maximum value is reached , the numbers being 265 and 915 seconds respectively .
This last interval is probably the measure of time required for the complete decomposition of the urea added , by the nitrous acid formed .
These results were also confirmed by another pair of observations .

Other series of experiments were conducted , in order to determine the effects produced by alterations of conditions , such as concentration of acid , temperature , and addition of nitrous acid .
Effect of Concentration .
A sample of nitric acid was purified as before , and made up to a concentration of 15 per cent. , i.e. , nearly one-half the strength of that used in the preceding experiments .

, it will be seen that the effect produced by decreasing the concentration is to lengthen out to a considerable degree the phenomenon of the increase of E.M.F. , for to reach the same point , viz. , 592 millivolts , 360 " were required in the one and about 540 " in the other case .
The higher initial value is probably due to a greater proportion of nitrous acid present initially in the nitric acid , as our experience has shown us that a difference of a very few parts per million makes a considerable alteration not only in .
the rate of chemical change , but also in the variations of electromotive force ; it is also probably conditioned by the amount of occluded gases in the metallic strips .
Decrease of concentration also seems to increase to a slight extent the final value of the E.M.F. , which is doubtless influenced to a greater degree by the proportion of nitrous acid , but to a less degree by the quantity of metallic salt dissolved per unit volume of the acid .
The experiment was then repeated under the same conditions , except that a small quantity of sodium nitrite was added to the nitric acid ; a maximum value of 711 millivolts in one case and 727 in another was reached once .
This result shows that the increase of E.M.F. observed is due for the most part to the production of nitrous acid .
The slightly lower final value of the E.M.F. , when the nitrous acid has been added as such , is in accordance with the observations of one of us , that nitrous acid ready formed is not so active a material as nitrous acid in the alternative process of formation and decomposition .
As a confirmation of the above values the results are given below of one preliminary set of determinations made by a different method and by means of a Thomson 's quadrant electrometer ; the values were compared with another Clark 's cell of different construction to that used by us .

, it will be seen , as before , that the time required to reach the maximum value of the E.M.F. is less with more concentrated acid .
The experiment was then repeated with addition of 1 per cent , of sodium nitrite ; a value of 7 5 5 millivolts was reached at once , and there was no further increase .
Other preliminary experiments gave nearly identical results , but it is not thought necessary to quote them .
Effect of Temperature .
To determine the effect produced by variation of temperature , two experiments were conducted with the same acid as that used above , but heated in a jacket of water .

2 u 2 It will be evident that an increase of temperature causes a more rapid rise of the a result due to the more rapid solution of the copper , and consequent production of nitrous acid ; it is probable from other experiments that , if the conditions could be kept absolutely fixed , the rise of E.M.F. per unit of time would be found to be a logarithmic function of the temperature .
As a comparison , the times required for the rise of E.M.F. between the same limits , viz. , 634 and 858 millivolts , are 840 , 75 , and 6 seconds respectively .
Another point is worthy of observation , namely , that at the higher temperatures the E.M.F. reaches a maximum value , and then slowly , but somewhat irregularly , decreases until it reaches a constant value ; this may be due to the vapour of water either oxidising the surface of the metal above the acid , or carrying up bubbles of oxides of nitrogen which attack the metal , and thus produce a temporary increase .
In conclusion , the value of the E.M.F. in water for the copper-platinum strips used in the above experiments was determined .
It was found to be 410 millivolts ( and after 3 hours 441 ) , which is practically the initial value given in Table IV .
, thus showing that the E.M.F. of the combination copper / water / platinum is not very different from that of copper / dilute nitric acid / platinum , wdiile it is even probable that the still lower value obtained with more concentrated acid is due to an immediate formation of oxide .
A characteristic curve is given of the rise of E.M.F. in one experiment , in which the abscissae represent the time in seconds from the start , while the ordinates are reduced rheochord readings which are functions of the E.M.F. The same remarks apply in the case of the curves for other metals .
Silver / Nitric Acid / Platinum .
Precisely similar experiments to those described above were conducted with metallic silver , which showed the same general results of rise of E.M.F. ; this will be evident from the results given in the following " fables :\#151 ; Table IX.\#151 ; Concentration of Acid = 15*0 per cent.

J. BURCH AND V. H. YELEY ON THE VARIATIONS The curve representing the variation of E.M.F. rises at first with uniform regularity , but in the later stages , in an irregular or staircase form ; this is not due to instrumental error , but is the actual record of a periodic change in the experimental cell.* There can be but little doubt , considering the results obtained from a chemical standpoint by Bussell , that in the case of this metal also the initial E.M.F. is that of silver / nitric acid / platinum , while the final is that of silver / nitrous acid / platinum .
But to meet the possible objection that the rise of E.M.F. is the effect of that cause to which we attribute'it , and not to some gradual formation of oxide or , it may be , of metallic nitrate , on the surface of the metal above the level of the acid liquid , the experiment above was repeated under precisely the same conditions , except that the metallic surface above the liquid was coated over with vaseline to protect it from acid fumes and oxides of nitrogen .

and X. , the values for the initial and final E.M.F. 's are seen to be within the limits of experimental error ; the form of the curves in the two cases is the same , and in many parts of their course they * are superposable .
This shows , therefore , that the rise of E.M.F. is not due to any alteration of the metallic surface above the acid liquid .
Effect of Tem I he experiments were repeated , the one condition of temperature being varied ; the results obtained are given below .
It A'as noticed that if the graphite resistance was cut out and the rider allowed to remain in one position for a few seconds , the mercury of the electrometer did not always rise steadily , but frequently moved with a series of rapid oscillations , which apparently coincided with the evolution of bubbles larger than usual .
This was seen also in the case of copper .

Thus the behaviour of a circuit consisting of bismuth , platinum , diluted nitric acid is precisely similar to those containing the metals copper and silver .
The net result obtained was to be expected from the observations of one of us , that no chemical reaction takes place between bismuth and nitric acid , save in the presence of nitrous acid .
As in the previous example , the initial value of the E.M.F. is approximately that of bismuth / nitric acid / platinum , while the final value is that of bismuth / nitrous acid / platinum .

G. J. BURCH AND V. H. VELEY ON THE VARIATIONS it was almost too sudden for correct observation ; the final value , however , is not , affected .
It will be seen that at the higher temperatures the E.M.F. rises to a maximum and then falls slightly to the value at which it remained constant for several minutes .
The possible reasons for this phenomenon have been discussed above .
Mercury j Nitric Acid / Platinum .
The mercury was introduced into the acid by means of a small U-tube having limbs of unequal length , in the shorter one of which , the acid came in contact with the metal , while down the longer , a platinum wire passed serving as a connection with the rest of the apparatus .
In the use of mercury there is , however , this disadvantage , that there is a difference of potential due to capillarity , which produces an accidental but permanent charge in the instrument , and diminishes or increases , as the case may be , the readings by a constant amount .
In the particular experiment quoted , the readings were diminished ; and the values given below are intended merely to illustrate the similarity of the behaviour of mercury to that of the other metals discussed above .

Conclusion .
I. The experiments detailed above show that when the metals , copper , silver , bismuth , and mercury are introduced into purified nitric acid of varying degrees of concentration , and a couple made with platinum , the electromotive force of such a cell increases considerably until it reaches a constant and ( in most cases ) a maximum value .
This rise of E.M.F. is attributed to the production of nitrous acid by the decomposiOF THE E.M.F. OF CERTAIN METALS IN NITRIC ACID .
xi i tion of the nitric acid , and the final value is considered to be due to the former acid only , while the initial value is due for the most part to the latter acid , though it is affected to a remarkable degree by the amount of impurity of nitrous acid either initially present or produced by minute and unavoidable uncleanliness of the metallic strips and the containing vessel .
II .
If nitrous acid has been previously added to the nitric acid then the maximum E.M.F. is reached at once .
III .
If the conditions , namely , increase of temperature , of impurity , and of concentration of acid , are such as could favour a more rapid production of nitrous acid , then the rise of E.M.F. is concomitantly more rapid .
IV .
Conversely , if the conditions are unfavourable to the production of nitrous acid the rise of E.M.E. is less rapid .
V. If any substance , such as urea , be added , which would tend to destroy the nitrous acid as fast as it may be formed , then the rise of E.M.F. is extremely slow , being dependent upon the number of molecular impacts of nitrous acid upon the surface of the metal .
Thus the results obtained by the electrometer and of the chemical balance are in every way confirmatory , the one of the other .
These results open out the further question as to whether the E.M.F. of batteries , in which concentrated nitric acid forms an ingredient , is dependent not upon the nitric acid se , as hitherto supposed , but upon the nitrous acid present in the fuming nitric acid , and formed also by the reduction of the acid by the hydrogen , which would otherwise be given off from the zinc and sulphuric acid .
Also since recent investigations have tended to show that the products of electrolysis of sulphuric acid are instrumental in effecting the solution of zinc , it is probable that the E.M.F. of a combination zinc / sulphuric acid / platinum may exhibit variations similar to those of combinations , wherein nitrous acid , one of the products of electrolysis of nitric acid , is continuously being formed .
To these problems we hope at no distant date to direct our attention .
Finally , we would express our thanks to Mr. F. J. Smith , of Trinity College , for kind assistance and advice ; to Mr. H. G. Mahan , of Queen 's College , for taking photographs of our apparatus ; and especially to Professor Burdon Sanderson for kindly placing at our disposal the apparatus from his department .
The experiments were conducted partly in the Chemical Department of the Museum , and partly in a private laboratory .
