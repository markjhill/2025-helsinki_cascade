" On the Influence of Coal-dust in Colliery Explosions-No .

( Abstract .
) The information that can be gleaned from a study of the three great colliery explosions of the past year , namely , Risca , Seaham , and Penygraig , appears to throw more light upon the question than anything that has been elicited experimentally either by myself or others since I last had the honour of addressing the Society on the same subject .
These explosions took place on the 15th of July , the 8th of 1881 .
] of Coal-dust in Colliery Explosions .
455 September , and the 10th of December respectively , and they cost the lives of no fewer than 885 persons in all\#151 ; Risca , 120 ; Seaham , 6 ; ^Fo^the^pnrposes of the present paper I visited Risca Colliery on the 24th of October , and Seaham Colliery on the 24th of November , and I have had the rare opportunity of becoming thoroughly conversant with every circumstance connected with the Penygraig explosion , and with the events which immediately preceded and accompanied its occurrence .
, - . .
,.-,1 A careful consideration of all the preceding details has irresistibly convinced me that , whatever may be the results of experiments with coal-dust made on a small scale , this is not a mere question of adding fuel to the flame , " of " aggravating the consequences of an explosion , of " spreading an explosion , " or of " lengthening out the flame of firedamp , " or that of a blown-out shot .
Expressions of that kind not only fail to convey a true idea of the actual state of matters , but they are apt to be misleading .
I might describe the impression upon my own mind to be somewhat as follows :-Given a well-ventilated or badly-ventilated dry mine , with moderately clean fine dry coa - us lying everywhere all over the workings , and of any quality varying from a long-flaming house coal , like that of Blantyre , on the one hand , to a semi-bituminous steam coal , like that of Penygraig , on the other hand .
Then if an explosion be begun at any point in one of the only three possible ways ( 1 .
By the coal-dust being raised and ignited by a blown-out or other shot ; 2 .
By an explosive accumuat.on of firedamp and air being ignited by a blown-out or other shot ; 3 .
By an explosive accumulation being ignited accidentally by a defective or other safety lamp , or in any other manner ) , and if it accumulates a certain degree of force without dying out , that force will go on increasing , and the explosion will inevitably extend to every open space in the workings , whatever may be their extent or ramifications I make no mention of firedamp as necessary to the attainment of this result , with the exception of the comparatively small quantity required o create the first disturbance .
It must not be imagined , however , that I lose sight of the latent firedamp contained in the air of every mine of this class .
On the contrary , I am satisfied that that firedamp plays a most important part in every great explosion , and I have endeavourei strongly to urge this view in both of my previous papers .
