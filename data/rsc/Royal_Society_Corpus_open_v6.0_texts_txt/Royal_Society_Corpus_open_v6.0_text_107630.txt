within the cavities of the germens , these young worms become of mature age , and lay their eggs within the cavities of these germens , which at that period nearly approach towards maturity ; and these newly laid eggs , I consider to be the beginning of the third generation of the worms with which I had inoculated the grains planted in the ground in October , 1807 .
Since the 5th of June , I regularly examined every second or third day an ear , to observe the progressive advancement , as well of the worms as of the germens ; towards the end of June , the germens assumed various distorted forms , and began to be filled with eggs .
I extracted carefully the whole contents of one of the largest grains , and putting it into water in a watch-glass , I found , on examination under the microscope , seven large worms , a great many eggs , and at least a hundred young worms , all alive , bending and twisting in the water like so many small serpents .
The natural size of the largest of these seven worms I found , by means of the micrometer , to be something more than 4 part of an inch in length , and about -i part of an inch in diameter .
They are more of a yellowish-white colour than the young worms , and are not so transparent ; their heads are very distinct ; they have a kind of proboscis , which has three or four joints , which they contract or extend like an opera glass .
From the head , which is somewhat roundish , they taper gradually off towards the tail , which is scarcely half the diameter of the middle of their body , and ends in an obtuse claw-like point .
At a short distance from the end of the tail is an orifice , surrounded by an elevated fleshy edge ; from this orifice the worms discharge their eggs .
The back 4 of these old worms is nearly opaque , and appears jointed , or annular ; the number of joints , or rings , is from twenty-five to thirty ; the belly side is more transparent ; and strings of ova can be distinctly seen , through almost the whole length of the worm , to the orifice by which the eggs are discharged .
The movements of these large worms are very faint and slow ; they are very seldom observed to unroll themselves entirely ; they move their heads and tails faintly , but their proboscis they move constantly , extending and contracting it quickly ; and when in the act of discharging their eggs , they bend the tailpiece upwards with a very quick jerk , at the passing of every egg ; after having discharged all their eggs , the parent worms soon die , and in a few days they decay , and fall to pieces almost at every joint .
The eggs come out from the orifice in strings of five or six , adhering to one another at their ends , which then appear truncated ; but , in water , they soon separate , and assume an oval form , which , in its middle , is slightly contracted .
These eggs consist of an extremely thin and transparent membrane , through which the young worm can be distinctly seen ; and , if attentively observed , it may be seen moving within this envelope .
The egg is about j part of an inch in length , and -oor , P part of an inch in diameter .
In about an hour and a half after the egg is laid in watery the young worm begins to extricate itself from the egg .
One extremity of the worm ( which I consider to be the head ) comes out at one end of the egg ; and by continual twisting and active exertion , the young worm comes gradually entirely out .
I watched one individual from the first appearance of its head till it was entirely extricated , the o !
er ; tion was effected in one hour and twelve minutes .
The eggs , afterthe worms have quitted them , soon shrivel and decay , and itseems they ultimately dissolve , as in a very few days they entirely disappear , as well those in the water , as those that have been hatched within the germens .
The young worms are somewhat smaller and more transparent than those which are found in the more mature grains , but in a very short time after they have mixed with the others , they cannot be distinguished from them .
Those which are found in the cavities of the mature grains , are nearly all of the same size ; they are from to S'i part of an inch in length , and Ti part of an inch in diameter .
They are milk-white , semi-transparent ; and if viewed with the strongest magnifying power , appear annular , like the large worms , though no external indentations are observable ; they appear like fine glass tubes filled with water , and containing many air bubbles in close succession , and of the same number as the rings or joints in the old worms. .
At both extremities ( one of which is more sharply pointed thal the other ) , there are no such divisions or joints perceptible .
These extremities are each about I of the whole length of the worm ; they are perfectly transparent , and appear like solid glass .
Respecting the sex of these minute animals , I could never discover any external distinction .
The old worms in the same germen are almost every one of a different size ; they have all the same proboscis and the same orifices .
Three of the seven worms from the same grain which I first examined , were laying their eggs at the same time , though they were not of precisely the same size ; but the other four did not ; they were considerably smaller , and evidently much younger ; but I have not the least doubt , had they been left undisturbed in the grain , they would , at the proper period , have attained the same size as the others , and would have produced eggs .
This opinion I consider confirmed by my subsequent investigations of grains approaching nearer to maturity ; in them there was no such striking difference in size ; at that period , the old worms in the same grains , which probably laid their eggs first , were now in a decaying state ; some parent worms were found dead , and those still alive were laying eggs , and of the same size as those which I had before observed in the act of discharging their eggs .
I also found that the infectedgermens in the upper part of the ears very frequently contained only one single large worm ; notwithstanding which , these germens were gradually filling with eggs , in the same manner as those in which originally there was more than one worm ; and among the diseased germens of plants which I had inoculated with the worms and the fungi of the smut-balls , both diseases having taken effect , I found several germens containing only two or three large worms , which formed as many distinct nests within the same germen , having each of them a large distinct cluster of eggs , kept separate by the fungi of the smut-balls that occupied the cavities within those germens .
From all the observations I had an opportunity of making , it appears , that there is no distinction of sex , and that they are true hermaphrodites .
The latter end of July , the diseased grains had almost all attained their full size , and assumed a brownish tint ; and about the fifth of August they were all of a dark brown colour , variously distorted , and as hard as wood .
The cavities of 'these grains were now completely filled with young worms , and these worms were , in every respect , the same as those with which I had inoculated my first seed grains ; and those specimens were now more than twelve months old , and , consequently , the grains and the worms within them were completely dry ; but after soaking them in water about an hour , the worms recovered their powers of moving , and were again as lively as those which were taken from the living plants .
These experiments I repeated with grains from the same specimens , for five years and eight months , always with the same success ; but I observed that the longer the grains were kept dry , the longer they required to remain in water before the worms recovered their motion ; but after the expiration of five years and eight months the worms were really dead .
The worms of the specimens which were the produce of my inoculated plants , retained their reviviscent quality for six years and one month ; and this is the longest time of suspension I have hitherto ascertained ; after that time the power of resuscitation ceased .
The large worms , after they become dry , die , and never revive ; neither can the young worms within the eggs be revived , if the eggs have been but for a moment dry before the worms have extricated themselves .
Experiments with such worms as had been revived in water before , and had been dried again , I repeated many times ; I soon found that those which had been kept the shortest time in water , recovered their motions soonest ; so that those which had been examined on the plain object-glass where 8 vibrio tritici .
only a very small quantity of water can be applied , which very soon evaporates , almost every individual worm recovered in less than a quarter of an hour ; and if the water is a second time suffered soon to evaporate , the experiment may be repeated many times successfully with the same worms ; but after the second or third repetition , if there is a suspension of a week or ten days at each interval , several worms do not revive , and the number of these increases at every succeeding repetition .
If this experiment be not repeated too soon or too frequently , the worms retain their reviviscent quality much longer ; the longest period of recovery , after a second suspension , I have hitherto ascertained , was eight months .
If the worms are kept alive in water for a week or ten days , the experiment cannot be repeated so often , but the intervals of suspension may be prolonged considerably .
I made the experiment very recently with grains which were three years and ten days old , and dry .
After extracting the worms from the grains , I kept them in water thirty-five days , and after they had again been fifteen days perfectly dry , I supplied them with water , and in less than twelve hours soaking they were again , almost every individual , in as lively motion as if they had just been taken from fresh grains of the growing plant .
I had the pleasure of showing these worms , in that state , to several Members of the Society , on the 29th of September last ; after that day , I preserved the same specimens eighteen days , perfectly dry ; when , supplying them with water , I found , in less than three hours , at least one-third of them in lively motion ; but the next morning , after they had just been sixteen hours in water , they were all dead .
If these worms are kept in a large glass , where the water cannot evaporate , they remain alive more than three months , but then they gradually die , and become as straight as needles ; in that state they remain unaltered in size and shape , for more than fourteen months ; and even after that time I found only a few floating on the surface of the water , in a state of decay ; they were then much thinner than they had originally been , and were shrivelled at all their joints , the number of which could now be distinctly ascertained ; the worms then assume a brownish colour , and at the least touch , or the slightest agitation of the water in which they are kept , they fall to pieces almost at every joint .
If the worms of one grain are put into water in a watch glass , they generally separate , and spread over a surface of about an inch in diameter , but during night , or if kept some hours in a dark place , they all assemble again , and entwist themselves together in a round cluster , the same as they originally formed within the cavity of the grain ; the same glutinous substance by which they were cemented together whilst within the grain , surrounds and envelopes them again ; and if they are suffered to get dry in that state , they retain their reviviscent property for as long a time as if they had been preserved within the grain .
The above mentioned glutinous substance appears to be of an oily nature , for if a cluster of the worms be extracted from the grains , and be slightly rubbed on the object-glass , it leaves a stain on the glass , which , if viewed through the microscope , appears to consist entirely of a clear and colourless fluid , which neither evaporates nor dries on the glass after several months ; but if the cemented mass of worms is immersed in water , the clear fluid almost instantaneously dissolves , and the worms separate .
If the worms are kept in a considerable quantity of water , and the water is frequently changed , the worms very soon die in the water , or if taken out whilst yet alive , and suffered to dry on the glass , they remain dead ; but if the young worms are kept only in a moderate quantity of water in a watch-glass , the mucus , or glutinous substance , rises , and , in about twelve hours , forms a film on the surface of the water , and soon becomes nearly opaque , and sinks again upon the worms at the bottom of the glass , and in that state the worms continue alive more than two months ; but if that film be carefully scummed off , the worms in the water die in less than twelve hours .
This glutinous substance must be secreted by the worms ; since in grains in which the worms and the fungi or smutballs exist , that portion of the cellular tissue of the young germens , where a worm has formed its nest and laid its eggs , is entirely preserved ; whilst in those portions of the grains which are immediately in contact with the fungi , the cellular tissue entirely disappears , and the fungi are only enveloped by the external tunic of the young germen .
From these facts , we are to consider this glutinous substance as the probable cause of preserving these minute animals for such a length of time .
What is recorded of the shell-snail , which can , by its own mucus , hermetically seal itself for thirty years in its shell against a wall , is similar to this : when 11 the mucus is dissolved , the air in the lungs is rarefied , and forces its way out , so that fresh air rushes into the lungs , and it recovers .
I must however state , that this mucus continues to exist in grains of wheat now more than twenty years old , though the worms within them have , more than twelve years ago , lost their reviviscent quality ; but whether length of time can , or cannot , effect such chemical change in the nature of that mucus , and by what means it has lost this preserving power , I must leave for others to decide .
Since writing these observations , I find that a great deal has been written on the subject by authors of eminence , and I have had an opportunity of reading the works of the undermentioned writers.* After an attentive perusal of their vibrio tritici .
s1 observations , I feel great satisfaction in finding that I have nothing to add , nor any alterations to make , in my own investigations and illustrations .

In the 7th volume of the Journal de Physique , published in 1776 , page 43 , FELIX FONTANA gives a long letter on the subject of these worms ; but his chief object is , to establish two most erroneous ideas ; first , he maintains that the infected grains in which the worms are found , are extraneous tumors , or gall-nuts , the mere produce of the worms ; this , however , to every one who has seen one of the infected grains , must appear totally at variance with the fact .
Secondly , that the suspension of the muscular motions of these worms , which is extended to such extraordinary length of time , is not a state of torpor , but real death , and extinction of life ; that the worms really die as often as they get dry , and are again brought to real life , as often as they are moistened with water .

I. The Croonian Lecture .
Microscopical observations on th suspension of the muscular motions of the Vibrio Tritici .
B FRANCIS BAUER , Esq. F. R. S. F. L. S. and H. S. Read December 5 , 1822 .
THE Croonian Lecture has usually been given by Members who had made Physiology their particular study ; and I should not have ventured upon this task , had I not been encouraged by one of our Vice-Presidents , who has now , for some years , applied my microscopical observations in promoting physiological enquiries into the more minute parts of animal structure .
Without his authority , I should not have ventured to bring forward the following observations , respecting the length of time the moving powers of an animal , too small to become the object of sight without the assistance of the microscope , can have its action suspended , and again , by a change of circumstances , renewed .
This , he is induced to believe , is one of the most curious facts respecting muscular motion that has hitherto been as certained , and not undeserving of the notice of the Society , particularly when laid before its members as a part of this Lecture , to which it most peculiarly belongs .
This minute animal , the Vibrio Tritici , is the immediate cause of that destructive disease in wheat , known under the name of Ear Cockle , or Purples , by farmers .
On opening some of the diseased grains , I found their cavities filled with a mass of a white fibrous substance , apparently cemented together by a glutinous substance , and formed into balls , which could easily be extracted entire from the cavities of the grains , and which , when immersed in water , instantly dissolved , and displayed in the field of the microscope , hundreds of perfectly organized , extremely minute worms , all which , in less than a quarter of an hour , were in lively motion .
Having left some of these worms on a glass for five days in a perfectly dry state , they were apparently dead ; but when moistened , they were again , in less than half an hour , as lively as ever .
These experiments and results were so far satisfactory , as they incontestibly established the fact , that the fibrous substance within the cavities of the diseased wheat grains , con- , sists : of real organized animals , which are endowed with the extraordinary property , of having their muscular action suspended for a considerable length of time , and of having it renewed again by the mere application of moisture : but how these animals are propagated , and how they are introduced into the cavities of the young germens , appeared to me a mystery , which I was convinced could only be unravelled by tracing them through every stage of the germination and vegetation of the growing plant of wheat ; and believing that the eggs of these Worms must be conveyed into the cavities of the very young germens of the flowers of wheat by the circulating sap , in the same manner as the seed of the parasitical fungi which occasion the well-known disease in wheat , the smut-balls , and which I had , in former experiments , successfully inoculated upon sound wheat , I determined to try the same experiment with these worms .
I therefore selected some sound grains of wheat , and placed some portions of the mass of worms in the , grooves on the posterior sides of the grains , and planted them in the ground in the month of October , 1807 .
Nearly all the seeds came soon up , and I took from time to time some of the young plants for examination , but could not perceive any effect of the inoculation , till the month of March , 1808 , when , in carefully slitting open the short stalk of a young plant , I found three or four worms within it ; they were in every respect the same , but they were now about two-thirds larger , as well in length as in diameter .
On the 5th of June I found , for the first time , some of the worms , of different sizes , within the cavities of the young germens ; and having , in the beginning of March , found some of them in an enlarged state in the stalk , I concluded that some of the original worms , with which I had inoculated the grains of seed , had got , during the germination of the grains , into the stalk , where they became mature , and laid their numerous eggs , some of which must be carried by the circulating sap into thecavities of the then forming young germens , in , which the young worms extricate themselves from these eggs ; and finding their proper nourishment
