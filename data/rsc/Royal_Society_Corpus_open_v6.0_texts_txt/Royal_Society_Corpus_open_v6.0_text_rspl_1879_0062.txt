[ Nov. 20 , .
series corresponds to " quartile " of the .r-series .
For , by the ordinary theory Ti ( probable error ) = *4769 . . . . . .
= ( log Q\#151 ; log a ) .
' .
log a-\-prob .
error =log Q. In words\#151 ; the term which differs from the Arithmetic Mean by probable error in the ^-series is the log .
of the quartile in the ce-series .
We infer that no new tables are necessary for the practical working-of our method .
We require only the tables of the error-function and of hyperbolic logarithms .
Of course common logarithms may be used , if we remember to introduce the appropriate modulus into our formulae .
In conclusion , I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Galton , not only for the suggestion of the problem I have here attempted to solve , but also for many valuable practical hints in the working .

Dear Sir , I regret that in my paper on the " Diurnal Variations of the Wind and Barometric Pressure , " published in vol. xxv , p. 402 , of the " Proceedings of the Royal Society , " I have inadvertently referred the Bermuda wind observations to civil time instead of to astronomical time .
The correction of this error shows that the variation of the values-of the hourly inequalities of the wind components at Bermuda is very much less during the hours when the sun is above the horizon than during , those when he is below it , especially in the winter half year .
The calculated barometric variations , depending on the'wind variations , should also be referred to astronomical instead of to civil time ; but the general reasoning of the paper remains the same , leaving the principal portions of the variations ( viz. , those which have half a day for their period ) unaffected .
