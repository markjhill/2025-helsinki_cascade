Since communicating to the Royal Society my Researches on Explosives , Part III , I have succeeded in obtaining the paper* by Messrs. Holborn and Austin on the Specific Heat of Gases at High Temperatures .
Their attention has been specially directed to carbonic anhydride , and their researches show a considerable ( but rapidly decreasing ) increment in the specific heat of C02 with increase of temperature .
If we suppose the same law of increment which appears to rule up to 800 ' C. to remain unaltered up to 1300 ' C. , the increments at that temperature would appear to vanish , and if this be so I find that the specific heat of C02 , at constant volume , should be taken at 0-2111 .
I have therefore recalculated the specific heats given in my recent researches , the specific heats , at constant volume , which I have used being as follow:\#151 ; C02 .

and these figures are , I think , to be preferred to those given in the tables where the specific heats used were those which had been determined for temperatures under 200 ' C. The temperatures of explosion I am about to give have been obtained by two different methods\#151 ; firstly , by dividing the heats determined by the calorimeter by the specific heats just given , and .
secondly , using the equation of dilatibility of gases , and determining the temperature from where p is the pressure in atmospheres obtained from the explosion , and the pressure in atmospheres when the volume of gases generated is reduced to 0 ' C. and 760 mm. Bar .

The differences of the results are very remarkable .
Taking for example cordite as an illustration , it will be seen that for the four highest densities given the temperatures derived from the two methods are but slightly different .
At the higher density ( 0*5 ) the temperatures are 5275 ' C. and 5263 ' C. , the higher being that derived from Equation ( 1 ) ; at density 0*45 the temperatures from the two methods are identical , at density 040 the temperatures are 4902 ' C. and 4970 ' C. , the lower temperature being from Equation ( 1 ) , but after density 0-35 the temperatures derived from Equation ( 1 ) fall very rapidly .
The same general results are observable in the other two explosives experimented with , and it should be noted that in all three explosives , at the highest densities , the temperatures given by Equation ( 1 ) are greater than those obtained by the second method .
On the other hand the temperatures obtained by dividing the heat obtained from the calorimeter by the specific heat do not greatly differ , and the least difference rests with the cordite .
The figures for the three explosives are given below , the temperatures t _ 0-00367p0 ( 1 ) obtained from units of heat* being given in italics .

2680 ' 2520 ' 2400 ' 3345 3295 3255 If these figures be examined it will be noted that in each explosive at the higher densities , the temperatures obtained by the two methods are nearly identical , those determined from Equation ( 1 ) being the higher , but as the density of charge is decreased the difference at the very low densities is remarkable ; some of this difference is doubtless attributable to the slow burning under feeble pressures , and to the rapid cooling , by communication of heat to the walls of the explosive vessel during the ignition of the charge , but it is impossible to ascribe the whole difference to this cause , and I can only suggest that the explanation is to be sought in the probable dissociation of the carbonic anhydride and aqueous vapour at low pressures , this dissociation being prevented wholly or partially by the very high pressures at the higher densities .
Various substances such as carbon , metallic platinum , tantalum , osmium and titanium have been placed in the charge , and all have been more or less fused and volatilised during the small fraction of a second to which they were exposed to the maximum heat .
Tantalum wire coiled on a steel wire became alloyed with the fused steel , taking up 14 per cent. Fe uniformly distributed , the Ta before the experiment being free from Fe .
A great part of the titanium was recovered in a fused crystalline condition .
Osmium and thin platinum foil were volatilised and thick sheet platinum was recovered in the form of a button .
