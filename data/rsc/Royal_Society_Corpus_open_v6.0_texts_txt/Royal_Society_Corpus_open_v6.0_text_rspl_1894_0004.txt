" An Estimate of the Degree of Legitimate Natality , as shown in the Table of Natality compiled by the Author from Observations made at Budapest .

\#163 ; ( Abstract .
) Both branches of the science of demography\#151 ; natality statistics as well as mortality statistics\#151 ; originated on British soil .
It was in 1665 that the Royal Society published the first work on these matters ( Graunt 's " Observations " ) , whilst in 1693 Halley , by establishing the first life table , laid the foundation of the scientific treatment of mortality statistics .
These tables of mortality showed for the first time how to measure the probability of death for each year of human age .
The other branch of vital statistics is still in want of a corresponding table of natality , showing the probability of birth for each of the age-combinations of the parents .
The table of natality is not of so great scientific importance as the life table , as the probability of death depends on natural laws , whilst the fertility , at least partially , is influenced by voluntary causes also .
But as the problems of over-population or de-population are an effect of both forces , it is worth while to study the law of these facts also .
To reach this aim , I have tabulated the age of the 71,800 married couples given in the Census of 1891 , conforming to the single year-combinations .
The virtual number of these combinations\#151 ; as 45 productive years of the male have to be combined with each of the 40 productive years of the female\#151 ; is about 2000 .
Knowing thus the number of all age-combinations , I observed for four years ( two before and two after the Census ) the 46,931 births amongst couples of those ages ; I got thus , dividing the figures obtained by four , the yearly probability of birth for each age-combination .
As the legitimate natality is to be regarded as a resultant between two distinct forces , the instinct of nature which urges towards multiplication and the forethought which causes moral restraint , it was also desirable to get an insight into the march of the physiological fertility alone .
For this purpose I had to look out for couples in whom the moral restraint is weakest or entirely absent .
These con1894 .

17 ditions are fulfilled in newly-married couples , where the physiological factor is nearly exclusively active .
I also thus found the degree of physiological natality for different age-combinations .
The two curves are very different .
The legitimate natality declines after the first child and its fall shows a regular slope .
The physiological arrives later at its maximum , remains for some length of time on this culminating height , and decreases only at a more advanced age .
We get thus two degrees of fertility for each age .
The difference between the degree of physiological and that of the actual fertility shows , the few cases of procreative exhaustion excepted , the influence of the moral factor .
In the somewhat advanced ages this moral restraint exercises an influence exceeding all expectation .
With the mothers of 30 to 35 it reduces the fertility to 78 per cent , ( instead of 100 per cent. ) , with those of 43 to 2 per cent. , i.e. , 98/ 100 of the physiological faculty is suppressed .
With men the influence is also very great , though weaker than with women .
Out of a large number of data here follow some figures to characterise the results : For the mother .
