Certain modifications taking place in the chlorous acid by exposure to light increase its sensibility , and as a general result it is found that the fluid through these alterations increases in resistance .
We have thus an anomalous kind of battery where the available electromotive force increases with the resistance .
The addition of neutral substances which increase the resistance without producing new decompositions improves the action of the cell .
Care has to be taken in these experiments to use the same apparatus in a series of comparative experiments , as infinitesimal differences in the contact- of the active pole render it difficult to make two instruments giving exactly the same results .
Cells have been constructed with two , three , and four poles , , and their individual and combined action examined .
Quartz surfaces have also been employed instead of glass , thus enabling the chemical opacity of different substances to be determined .
The electrical currents derived through the action of light on definite salts are strong in the case of ferro- and ferri-cyanide of potassium , but remarkably so in the case of nitroprusside of sodium .
Of organic acids the tartrate of uranium is one of the most active .
A mixture of selenious acid and sulphurous acid in presence of hydrochloric acid yields strong currents when subjected to light in the form of cell described .
The list of substances that may be proved to undergo chemical decomposition by the action of light is very extensive ; full details will be found in the completed paper .

" On the Determination of the Scale Value of a Thomson 's Quadrant Electrometer used for Registering the Variations in Atmospheric Electricity at the Kew Observatory .
" By G. M. Whipple , B.Sc. , Superintendent of the Kew Observatory .
Communicated by Robert H. Scott , M.A. , F.R.S. Received April 3 , 1878 .
The Meteorological Council , being desirous of discussing the photographic traces produced by their electrograph at the Kew Observatory some time since , requested the Kew Committee to institute a series of experiments , with the view of determining the scale value of the instrument , in order to prepare a suitable scale for measuring the curves .
The Kew Committee , at their meeting in November , entrusted the matter to me , and accordingly , having obtained the loan of a battery of 300 Bunsen cells , some preliminary experiments were made , which 1878 .
] Scale Value of a Thomson 's Quadrant .357 showed that the greatest potential which could be obtained with them was very inadequate for the purpose .
Having named this fact to Dr. De La Rue , he very generously placed his large chloride of silver battery at the disposal of the Observatory , and by its means we have been able to test the value of the deflections of the instrument at different points of the scale throughout its entire range .
Owing to the difficulty of transporting the large battery the experiments were all made in Dr. De La Rue 's laboratory , Charlotte-street , Portland-place , London .
The electrometer ( Thomson 's Quadrant , Ho. 19 , White , Glasgow , maker ) was dismounted from its position in the Observatory on the 3rd December , 1877 , careful measurements having first been made of the distance of a mark on the instrument from the source of light and from the point of incidence of the reflected spot of light on the circumference of the cylinder of the registering apparatus .
The acid was then removed from the jar , and the needle fixed for transit .
Before moving the instrument the exact position of the quadrants , which are kept separated to some distance in ordinary use , was marked by lines drawn on the cover , so as to ensure as far as possible that the same inductive power should be acting on the needle during the experiments as there had been whilst the electrometer was in daily use at the Observatory .
The time of vibration of the needle was also carefully determined and noted , with the view of detecting any change that might occur in its sensibility from derangement of its supporting fibres during transit .
The apparatus was then conveyed to Dr. De La Rue 's laboratory , and there fitted up on a bed prepared for the purpose , on which the distances as mentioned above were marked .
The jar having been refilled with acid the needle was liberated , and its time of vibration being found unaltered , it was charged positively , and the instrument left for several days in order that its interior might become thoroughly dried .
In the first experiment readings were taken on a scale divided into fortieths of an inch , which was placed in the exact position occupied by the front face of the cylinder of the registering apparatus of the electrograph .
The battery terminals were then attached to the electrodes of the instrument , and the cells joined up in series as required .
The deflections produced by the different potentials were read off on the scale with the following results , the quadrants being put to earth at the beginning of each experiment with the view of obtaining a correct value of the zero .

The image of the illuminated slit reflected from the mirror of the electrometer , falling on this paper made a photographic impression of each deflection of the needle with various numbers of cells in circuit .
The time of exposure of the paper was two minutes .
After the sheets had been developed and fixed the deflections were measured with a tabulating instrument , and the following results obtained .

The value of the electromotive force of one De La Rue chloride of silver cell being 103 volt , as determined by Messrs. De La Rue and Muller ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. , vol. xxvi , p. 324 ) , the scale thus formed has been assumed to represent volts with sufficient accuracy for the required purpose .
My best thanks are due to Mr. Seaton and Mr. R. W. F. Harrison for assistance rendered me in the prosecution of the experiments .
