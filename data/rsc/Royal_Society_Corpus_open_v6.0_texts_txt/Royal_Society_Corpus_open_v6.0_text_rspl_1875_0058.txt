( Abstract .
) In the Introduction to this Memoir a description was given of the observations made by M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards on the gravid uteri of several genera of Lemurs .
The author then proceeded to describe the gravid uteri of six Lemurs which he had received from Dr. Andrew Davidson , of Antananarivo , Madagascar , viz. Lemur i* ufipes , and Indris brevicaudatus .
He then summarized the conclusions he had arrived at in the course of his dissections , and showed that the placenta in these animals was diffused and presumably therefore non-leciduate .
The paper concluded with a discussion of the bearing of ihese observations on the classification of the Lemurs , and on the theory propounded by Haeckel of the descent of the deciduate mammals from i primaeval root-form of Prosimiae .

" On the Movement of the Glass Case of a Radiometer .
" By William Crookes , E.R.S. \amp ; c. Received March 30 , 1876 .
During the discussion which followed the reading of Prof. Reynolds 's and Dr. Schuster 's papers at the last meeting of the Royal Society I mentioned an experiment bearing on the observations of Dr. Schuster .
I have isince tried this in a modified form ; and as the results are very decided and appear calculated to throw light on many disputed points in the theory of these obscure actions , I venture to bring a description of the experiment , and to show the apparatus at work , before the Society .
I made use of a radiometer described in a paper communicated to the Society in January last .
I quote the description from paragraph 184 .
" A large radiometer in a 4-inch bulb was made with ten arms , eight of them being of brass and the other two being a long watch-spring magnet .
The disks were of pith , blackened on one side .
The power of the earth on the magnet is too great to allow the arms to be set in rotation unless a candle is brought near ; but once started it will continue to revolve with the light some distance off .
" This radiometer was floated in a vessel of water ; and four candles were placed round it so as to set the arms in rotation .
A mark was put on the glass envelope so as to enable a slight movement of rotation to be seen .
The envelope turned very slowly a few degrees in one direction , then stopped and turned a few degrees the opposite way ; [ finally it took up a uniform but excessively slow movement in the direction of the arms , but so slow that more than an hour would be occupied in one revolution .
