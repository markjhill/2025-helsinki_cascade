The general methods adopted in carrying oat the experiments detailed below were identical with those described in Parc II , * the weighed metals being fused together under cyanide of potassium , well intermixed by continued vigorous stirring , and poured into red-hot narrow clay test-tubes , which were then inserted inside thin iron protecting tubes , closed at the lower end , and immersed in a bath of molten lead , maintained at as nearly as possible a constant temperature by means of a series of Bunsen flames playing into the interspace between the cylindrical iron vessel containing the lead and an outer concentric clay jacket .
Fluctuations of temperature , to a greater or lesser extent , being unavoidable during long periods of heating , notwithstanding all care , some of the figures ultimately deduced were less concordant than those obtained in the experiments previously described , the mode of separation of a given mass into two different alloys being apparently more affected by temperature variations with mixtures containing bismuth than with corresponding mixtures containing lead instead of bismuth .
Our first experiments were made with the object of determining the mutual solubilties of bismuth and zinc at different temperatures .
Matthiessen and v. Bose found ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 11 , p. 430 ) that melted bismuth could dissolve zinc , forming an alloy containing 12*93 to 16*30 per cent , of zinc ( excluding two determinations of 8*65 and 8*80 per cent , respectively , presumably erroneous from some undetected source of error ) ; and that zinc could dissolve bismuth , forming an alloy containing 2*38 to 2*48 per cent , of bismuth ; no record of temperature was made in these observations further than that the molten metals were ultimately poured into " a porous cell which had been previously heated to redness in a large crucible filled with sand .
" We obtained the following figures , approximately equal weights of bismuth and zinc being melted together and well stirred up , the mixtures being then poured into red-hot narrow clay test-tubes , and heated in the lead-bath for periods of eight hours and upwards .

The formula Zn4Bi7 requires Zn = 15*1 , and Bi = 84*9 per cent. Mixtures of Bismuth , , and Tin .
Two series of experiments were made , one at a temperature rang , ing between 600 ' and 700 ' , and averaging near to 650 ' ; the other ranging between 700 ' and 800 ' , and averaging near to 750 ' .
The results indicate that in presence of tin the solubility of zinc in bismuth and that of bismuth in zinc are both materially increased by increment of temperature .
A few experiments at a somewhat higher temperature , averaging near 800 ' , were also made , the results of which indicated a notable further increment in solubility ; but , as considerable difficulty was experienced in getting even moderately concordant figures at this higher temperature , these observations were not carried far enough to enable average curves to be deduced .
In every case the mixture of metals employed contained equal quantities of bismuth and zinc with varying proportions of tin ; as in the case of the lead-zinc-tin alloys previously described , the effect of volatilisation and oxidation caused a small decrement in the proportion of zinc present in the compound ingots ultimately obtained relatively to the other two metals contained therein , especially in the experiments at the higher temperatures .
In analysing the alloys prepared , we found that the method of analysis used for lead-zinc-tin alloys could not be adopted without modification , because the stannic oxide formed by the action of nitric acid on the alloys retained variable amounts of bismuth in such a condition as not to be removed by copious washing with dilute nitric acid , or even by boiling therewith * In some instances we weighed the crude stannic oxide retaining bismuth , and then fused it with sodium carbonate and sulphur , whereby sodium sulphostannate was formed , soluble in water , and bismuth sulphide insoluble therein .
By precipitating the stannic sulphide by means of hydrochloric acid from the aqueous solution , and cautiously roasting it , the corrected weight of stannic oxide was obtained ; this we found always concorded sensibly with the weight deduced by converting the undissolved bismuth sulphide into oxide ( by dissolving in nitric acid , precipitating boiling with ammonium carbonate , and igniting the precipitate ) , and subtracting the weight of this from that of the crude stannic oxide .
In other cases , we dissolved the alloy in hydrochloric acid containing a little nitric acid , diluted and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen , separating the tin * It is noteworthy that no trace of lead appears to be thus retained by stannic oxide when alloys containing tin and lead are treated with nitric acid 5 on the other hand when alloys containing antimony and lead are similarly treated , the undissolved antimony oxide retains a notable amount of lead , just as stannic oxide retains bismuth .

and bismuth thus precipitated with ammonium sulphide .
Check experiments made by both methods yielded sensibly the same tin percentages .
In order to determine the zinc after removal of bismuth and tin , we first precipitated it as sulphide , then dissolved in hydrochloric acid , and precipitated as carbonate , finally igniting and weighing as oxide ; this method of treatment being adopted to prevent lime , \amp ; c. , derived from the vessels used being weighed with the zinc , as would have been the case had the precipitation as sulphide been omitted .
Any traces of oxide of iron contained in the zinc oxide were subsequently estimated and subtracted .
The following figures were derived from the examination of twenty-one compound ingots , the percentages being reckoned upon the sum of the weights of tin , bismuth , and zinc found as 100 .
With some of the lighter alloys , where zinc was the main constituent , only the tin and bismuth were determined , and the zinc taken by difference .

[ Feb. 12 j On plotting these figures as curves it is noticeable that , whilst the distribution of the tin between the heavier and lighter alloys formed is only slightly different according as the temperature is 650 ' or 750 ' in each case the curve is of an entirely different character from that deducible from the previous experiments with lead , zinc , and tin Instead of rising above the base line to a maximum and then falling again , ultimately crossing the base line and passing below it , each curve lies completely below the base line .
Curves Nos. 1 and 2 , fig. 1 | I respectively represent the above values at 650 ' and 750 ' ; whilst No. 3 represents the corresponding curve obtained ( Part I ) with equal proportions of lead and zinc in the original mixtures at near 650 ' ; in each case the abscissae are the percentages of tin in the heavier alloys , whilst the ordinates are the excesses of the tin percentages in the lighter alloys over the corresponding percentages in the heavier ones .

[ Precisely similar remarks apply to the solubility of bismuth in zinc .
Mixtures of Bismuth , Zinc , and Silver .
It has already been mentioned in Part II that mixtures of bismuth , J zinc , and silver show the same remarkable behaviour as analogous i mixtures of lead , zinc , and silver , leading to the conclusion that two i definite compounds of zinc and silver are formed under appropriate conditions , indicated respectively by the formulae AgZn5 and Ag4Zn5 ; of which the first is characterised by being capable of dissolving more lead ( or bismuth ) than can either pure zinc or the second compound , and of being more soluble in lead ( or bismuth ) than either of these ; also of being somewhat unstable , so that when a solution of lead ( or bismuth ) in AgZn6 is kept molten for a long time it breaks up forming zinc and Ag4Zne , which being unable to dissolve all the lead originally present , causes the separation of lead from the liquid metal as a heavier alloy containing a little zinc and silver in solution .
The second compound Ag4Zn5 is characterised by the peculiar red colour assumed by a recently cut or filed surface exposed to the air for awhile , and by 164 Dr. Alder Wright and Mr. C. Thompson .
[ Feb. 12 the circumstance that it is less soluble in lead ( or bismuth ) , relatively to the zinc present , than either pure zinc or a mixture of zinc and silyer in any other proportion .
Three series of experiments were made exactly corresponding with those previously described with lead-zinc-silver alloys in Part II ; in each case the temperature was as near 750 ' as could be managed , ranging between 700 ' and 800 ' .
The analysis of the alloys was made by dissolving in nitric acid , diluting , precipitating silver by hydrochloric acid , and washing the precipitate by decantation with hot dilute hydrochloric acid , in case any bismuth oxychloride might have separated .
The filtrate was evaporated to a small bulk and treated with water , and the filtrate from the bismuth oxychloride formed treated with sulphuretted hydrogen ; the bismuth in the sulphide and oxychloride thus obtained was determined by converting the joint precipitates into oxide by dissolving in nitric acid , precipitating boiling with ammonium carbonate , and igniting .
The zinc was determined as in the former alloys , and corrected for small quantities of iron derived from the Crucibles , \amp ; c. Series I.\#151 ; Time of fusion , 8 hours .

165 same peculiarities as the corresponding series obtained with lead , zinc , and silver described in Part II ; thus the silver-distribution curve is of sensibly the same character , the excess of silver in the lighter alloy over that in the heavier being at first extremely great , but later on lessening , until a maximum elevation of the curve above the base line is attained , after which the curve again descends .

Series II was prepared in precisely the same way as the corresponding series with the lead-silver-zinc alloys ; i.e. , mixtures of the three metals were made and fused for eight hours as in Series I ; the compound ingots thus obtained were cut in two so as to separate from one atiother the lighter and heavier alloys thus formed , and the former parts separately fused at the same temperature* ( 700\#151 ; 800 ' ) for Series II .

In this way a further separation was brought about in the case of the alloys prepared with smaller proportions of silver , but no material alteration in the case of those made with larger proportions , just as with the lead-silver-zinc alloys .
On plotting the results , a curve was obtained ( No. 2 , fig. 5 ) from which the first maximum , at approximately the point representing the compound AgZn5 , had completely disappeared , as had also the subsequent fall , the curve exhibiting a progressive rise from beginning to end .
Series III was similarly made with the heavier alloys thus separated from the lighter ones ; the results , when plotted ( curve No. 2 , fig. 6 ) , showed that the abnormally large percentages of zinc observed in the earlier part of the series had disappeared , whilst the diminution in amount of zinc dissolved relatively to the bismuth present down to a minimum and subsequent rise again was still well marked , the position of the minimum corresponding , as before , with a ratio of zinc to silver not far from that indicated by the formula Ag4Zn5 .

If 100 parts of zinc can take up m parts of bismuth in presence of x parts of tin ( or silver ) , and if 100 parts of bismuth can take up n parts of zinc in presence of x parts of tin ( or silver ) , then the following tables give the correlated values of m , n , and a ?
, these values being minima in the case of alloys containing silver , i.e. , being deduced from those experiments where the influence of the presence of the compound AgZn5 in increasing solubility was eliminated .
