[ Feb. 23 , roots , or only feebly developed on the dorsal side .
The cortical layer next to the exodermis constitutes itself into a cork-cambium ; and in the pitcher-roots a secondary cork-cambium arises within the bands of sclerenchyma .
Cork is not formed on the distal parts of the pitcher-roots , nor within the most ventral portion of the climbing roots .
Sometimes there is a group of large wood-vessels in the ventral portion of the vascular cylinder .
The points especially worthy of note in the roots of Rafflesiana are\#151 ; 1 .
The early cuticularisation of the root-hairs , and the long persistence of these structures , which , in climbing roots , remain to function as anchoring threads .

The curious passage-cells of the exodermis , which do not possess thin cellulose-walls .

" On a Meteoric Stone found at Makariwa , near Invercargill , New Zealand .
" By Professor G. H. F. Ulrich , F.G.S. , of the University , Dunedin , New Zealand .
Communicated by Professor J. W. Judd , F.R.S. Received December 14 , 1892 , \#151 ; Read February 2 , 1893 .
Introductory .
The stone under notice was not seen to fall , but the following description regarding the site of its discovery , its mineral character , and structure can leave no doubt of its being of meteoric origin .
Towards the end of the year 1886 , when a large party of mining prospectors were preparing , with Government aid , for departure to the Big Bay district , west coast of Middle Island , Mr. Th. Fenton , a student of the Dunedin University School of Mines , was sent to Invercargill , where the party assembled , to instruct those of the men who desired it in rough assaying for gold and the use of the blowpipe .
On the occasion of one of his lectures , he received from a Mr. Arch. Marshall , for examination , a piece of stone which , from its weight and appearance , was supposed to be something out of the common .
Mr. Fenton made a rough qualitative analysis of a sample of the stone , and on finding strong reactions for nickel , thought it of sufficient interest to preserve the several small fragments remaining of the piece l'eceived from Marshall and to bring them with him to Dunedin , where lie placed them at my free disposal .
One of these fragments I devoted to the preparation of a number of thin sections
