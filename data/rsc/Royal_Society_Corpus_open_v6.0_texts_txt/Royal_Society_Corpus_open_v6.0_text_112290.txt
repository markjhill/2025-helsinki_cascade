( Abstract .
) It is shown in the general paper that if an integral of any one equation of the peculiar system of ( partial differential ) equations there discussed be found , then if a certain numerical result of subsequent and always possible operations prove odd , an integral of the entire system can be found by the solution of a single differential equation of the first order .
It is shown in the paper now sent that , when the above numerical result is even * , we can reduce the original system of partial differential equations into a new system , fewer in number by unity at least , and of the same general character , so as to admit of a repetition of the same procedure .
Thus the common integral sought will finally be given either by the solution of a single differential equation of the first order , or by finding one integral of the single partial differential equation , which , in the most unfavourable case conceivable , will remain at last .
