An essay towards the calculus of Junctions .
Part II .
By C. Babbage , Esq. Communicated by W. H. Wollaston , M. D. Sec. R. S. Read March 14 , i816 .
IN a former Paper which the Royal Society honoured with a place in the last Volume of their Transactions , I endeavoured to explain the nature of the calculus of functions , and I proposed means of solving a variety of functional equations containing only one variable quantity .
My subsequent enquiries have produced several new methods of solving these , and much more complicated functional equations , and have convinced me of the importance of the calculus , particularly as an instrument of discovery in the more difficult branches of analysis ; nor is it only in the recesses of this abstract science , that its advantages will be felt ; it is peculiarly adapted to the discovery of those laws of action by which one particle of matter attracts or repels another of the same or of a different species ; consequently , it may be applied to every branch of natural philosophy , where the object is to discover by calculation from the results of experiment , the laws which regulate the action of the ultimate particles of bodies .
To the accomplishment of these desirable purposes , it must be confessed that it is in its present state unequal ; but should the labours of future enquirers give to it that perfection , which other methods of investigation have attained , it is not too much to hope , that its maturer age shall unveil the hidden laws which govern the phenomena of magnetic , electric , or even of chemical action .
When functional equations containing two or more variables occur , their solution presents still greater difficulties than those we have already considered ; the new relations which arise , necessarily require a new notation to distinguish them .
I shall endeavour , as far as I am able , to apply or extend that already in use ; but , as it is almost impossible in the infancy of a calculus to foresee the extent to which it may be carried , or the new views which it may be necessary to take of it , the notation I have used should only be considered as of a temporary nature ; it may be employed until some more convenient one be devised : perhaps , however , it might be more advantageous that it should not be altered until our acquaintance with this subject becomes more intimate , and until the infinitely varied and comprehensive relations displayed in the doctrine of functions , have been more minutely examined .
If 4 be the characteristic of any function of two quantities x and y , that function is thus denoted A ( x , y ) .
Now , if instead of x in this quantity the original function be substituted , I shall call the result the second function relative to x , and I shall denote it thus ' ( x , 2 ; y ) =(X , ( Ay ) , ) i8o The first index a refers to x , and the second index i refers toy .
Similarly if instead of y in the original function , the function itself had been substituted , the result would have been the second function relative to y ; it would be thus denoted , " 2(x , y ) -- , ( x,4 ( x , y ) ) If there are more than two variables in the original function , they may be arranged in the order in which they are to be operated on , and the indices will denote the number of operations to be performed .
Thus,2'3 , I14 ( x , y , z , v , ) signifies that in the function 4(x , y , z , v , ) we must instead of x substitute the function itself , and in the result instead of y put the same function , this latter operation must be repeated , and finally , instead of v in the last result , put the original function ; this last operation must again be repeated twice .
There are many cases which this notation does not comprehend .
If , for example , in the function just proposed , we wished again to take the function relative to x ory , it would not be easy to express this. .
The method I propose is to have two ranks of indices , the lower one to distinguish the quantities operated on ; the upper one to mark the number of operations performed .
According to this method the example just chosen would be written thus : 2 3 ?
I , 4 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 4(x , y , ,v ) If only such functions as these occur , we encumber our symbol without any advantage ; if , however , we now wish to perform any farther operations , such , for instance , as to take the second function relative to z , and then the third relative to y , we have a very convenient mode of doing it ; these operations would be thus expressed ; 2 , 3 , I , 423I 2 , 3 , 4 , 3 , 2 A(x , y , % , v ) This notation may not appear sufficiently concise to those who do not consider the very complicated relation expressed by the above written symbol : it need , however , only be used in very few cases , and when the lower series of indices is omitted , it must always be understood , that the quantities themselves are arranged in the order in which they are to be operated on .
If in a function of two variable ( ( x , y , ) we take the second function relative to x , and then the second function relative toy , we have '(x , y ) = +c { x , i , ( Xya ) J ( X , y ) If we take the second function first relative to y , and then the second relative to x we shall find " '(x , y)= ( x , y ) , { x()(Ay ) , y)y } It appears from this , that the order in which these operations are performed is not immaterial , as the order in which we differentiate a function of two variables , is in the differential calculus .
The two expressions just given are the two second functions of 4 ( x , y ) , the first taken relative to x and y , and the second taken relative to y and x. But there may be another second function of 4/ ( x , y ) , which will arise from substituting at the same time 4 ( x , y ) for x , and , ( x , y ) for y , it will be , ( ( x , y ) , ,(x , y ) ) 182 and may for the sake of distinction be called the second simultaneous function relative to x and y ; it differs from the two preceding ones , and in order to denote it with brevity , I shall put a line over the two indices thus , 21 2 ( x , y ) =A( ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) This method of distinguishing it is equally applicable when there are more variables .
There is only one other modification of the symbol denoting function to which I shall at present allude .
Suppose ( after any number of operations have been performed on a function of two variables for example ) y becomes equal to x , and the result only is given : this will naturally be represented in a manner analogous to that in which EULER denoted the limits between-which the integral of a quantity is to be taken .
2 , 2 Thus the equation I ' 2(x , y ) =fx [ y = x ] arises from the following question : What is the form of a function of x and y , such that taking the second function relative to x , and then the second relative to y , the result on making y equal to x shall be a given function of x ?
It might be proposed , that after putting y equal to x , the whole should be considered merely as a function of x , and that its nth function should be taken on this hypothesis , and the result only should be given .
Such operations I would denote thus ?
4 ' ( x , y ) =f ( ) Cy=xJ or perhaps / } ( x , y)=f(x)[y=x ] and in a similar manner all other relations of the same kind may be expressed .
I shall give one example which will illustrate these various modifications of the original functions , 2,3 , 2 213)213 y ax= 3 , 3 2 , 4 3 , Iy ( x , , z , v ) - ) -f(x ) L= This equation contains the analytical enunciation of the following Problem .
What must be the form of a function of four quantities i ( x , y , , v ) such that taking the second function relative to z , the third relative to x , and the second simultaneous one relative to y and v : if in the result ax be put for y and j3 for v , and the whole be then considered as a function of x and z , and if on this hypothesis the third function be taken relative to z , and the second relative to Z ; and if yx be now put for z and the third function of the expression considered merely as a function of x be taken , then it is required that the final result shall be equal toJx a given function of x ?
Symmetrical functions I shall denote as in my former Paper , by putting a line over the quantities relative to which they iI are symmetrical , thus 4 ( x , y , z , v ) is symmetrical relative to x and y in one sense , and relative to z and v in another .
PROBLEM I. Required the solution of the functional equation 4 ( x , y)= ( ax , Gy ) To avoid repetition a , P , 3 , &amp;c. unless otherwise mentioned , always express known functions , and p , tj , x are unknown or arbitrary ones .
Put 4 ( x , y , )= p ( fJ , f , ) tt 184 then the given equation becomes p ( f , JY ) =q ( xP xf , ) Determinef and f from the two equations fx =-fOx andfy ==f3y i ?
this may be effected by Prob. .
or II of my former Paper , take any particular solution and p may remain perfectly arbitrary ; then the general solution of the problem is , ( x , y ) = ( fx , fie ) a Ex , il Given the equation ( x , y ) =4 ( -x , j here we ha ; vef(x)==f( -x ) , and a particular solution isfx=xr ; alsof ( y)=-J ( and a particular case isf ( y ) y-hence the general solution of the equation is 4I ( z , y ) =p ( z2 , - ) qpbeing perfectly arbitrary .
If we employ the general solutions of the equations f ( x ) =f ( -x ) and f ( y ) =j t - ) we shall still only have one arbitrary function .
In fact , the most general solution of the equation 4 ( x , y ) = , , ) " with which I am at present acquainted is ( wy ) = ir~ , x , y , J j and this only involves one arbitrary functiono PROBLEM II .
Given the same equation A ( x ; y)-=(ax , ,3y ) Suppose one particular solution of this equation is known , let it bef(x , y ) , then take 4 ( x , y ) =of ( x , y ) , qp being perfectly arbitrary and the given equation becomes Pf ( x , y)== of ( ax , y ) which is evidently satisfied sincef ( , y ) =f ( rx , y ) by the hypothesis .
Ex. i. Let , ( x , y ) = , = ( lX , y one particular solution of this equation isf(xI , y ) = xz0g .
hence the general solution is 4 ( x , y ) = ( xlogY ) Ex. 2 .
Given the equation A ( x , y ) = , ( sx , in ) a particular case isf ( x , y ) )= log hence the general solution is , ( , y ) =q ( log .
Ex. 3 .
Given the equation , ( x , y ) =4 ( xn , ym ) In order to get a particular case let us put ( x , y ) = log .
' x+a log.2y by substituting this value we shall find that it is a particular solution of the equation , if a= lohence the general solution of the equation is 1 ?

mi or changing the value of p it becomes ( )= ( log .

M ''(X ' , Y )=~~ ( log .

86 Ifn -=.m we have 4 ( x , y)= ( logas in the last example , and if m= we have the same solution as in the first .
n In these equations the functions have contained the variables separated ; but it may frequently happen , that they occur mixed as in the following Problems .
PROBLEM IIi , Given the equation ( , ( , Y )= 4 ( ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) Assume 4 ( x , y ) = ( f ( x , y ) , f(x , y ) ) , and by making this substitution the equation becomes { f ( X , Y ) , f(X , Y ) f( { )(xJy ) , ( x , y ) ) , J(/ ( x , y ) , )(x , y ) ) } In order to render this equation identical , I determinef and f from the two following equations : f ( xy ( ) =J(( ( yxy ) ) and f ( x , y ) =f ( a ( x , y ) , t ( x , y ) ) From these it appears , that f and f are merely two particular solutions of the origillal equation .
If , therefore , we are acquainted with any , the general solution is 4 ( x , y ) = p(f(x , y ) , f((A , Y ) ) If only one particular solution is known , the general one is ( X , y ) = of ( x , y ) Ex. i. Let us examine in what cases we can find the general solution of the equation 4 ( x , y ) = ( xny " , xkyr ) In order to obtain a particular solution , put 4 ( x , y)=xvyw and making this substitution , we shall find the following equation of condition among the exponents .
( i n ) ( ir ) =km 187 Cc hence either of the following equations may be solved geneerally , d ( x , y ) = xn r , rt Y)r = YJ , ( fie !
'r ( X ) ( b ) the solution of the former is 4 , ( x , y ) = ( yj ) , and that of the latter is t4 ( x , y)= qp ( xr-I in I ) In ( a ) put n =r+- , then the solution of 4 , ( x , y ) =( V/ Xy v/ 'y ) is ( ( x , y ) = ( y ) Ina similar manner it may be found that the solution of ( x , Y\ 3 ( --~y ) , ( .x , y)=q ( 1 ) As another example take the equation a particular solution is , ( x , y)= xy +y2 , hence the general solution is ( x , y)=( xy +y ) , but we may find another particular solution of this equation which is totally different from the former , and by combining the two we shall obtain a much more general solution .
The equation ( b ) will coincide with the one under consideration , if we make n --and r= - , then we shall have for another particular solution f ( x , y ) -= y2X , hence a very general solution of the equation,4(x , y)= 4 V(y , v 2xy / is ( X , Y)=q= ( St-Y+Y , VI }p remaining perfectly arbitrary .
In the equation of this Problem it may happen that i88 c ( x , y ) does not contain x nor A ( x , y ) contain y , it then becomes 4 ( X , y ) = ( y , ,x ) This is the case when 4 ( x , y ) is required to be a symmetrical function of x and y , the equation would then become ( x , y ) = ( y , x ) two particular solutions aref ( x , y ) = xy and f(x , y ) = +y , hence the general solution of the equation is ( x , y)= - , ( y , x +y ) Though these solutions may with propriety be termed general because they contain an arbitrary function , yet I am by no means inclined to think them the most general of which the questions admit , possibly we ought to except the two last equations , though I shall afterwards show that the solution of an equation of the form , ( x , y ) =4 , ( ax , Ay ) may contain any number of known functions within the arbitrary one .
PROBLEM IV .
Given the equation x ( x , y ) == ( a ( X , Y ) , P ( X , Y ) ) Assume as before ) ( x , y= ( J y)))f(x , y ) ) , then the equation will become ( f(x , y ) , f(x , y))= I{f(M(x , y ) , ( x , y))f( ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) } In order to render this equation identical , determinef and f from the two equations J(x , y ) ( J ( X y ) , y , ( x , y ) ) and f ( x , y ) =f ( ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) putting in the first of these ( x , y ) for x and A ( ?
, y ) fory we find f ( a(x ) , ( ( x , y))=f { ( ( x , ^y ) , ( ( x , y ) ) , ( -(x , y ) , ( , y ) ) }.= ( : ) ( : ) Cc2 189 and we should find a precisely similar equation for determiningf .
If we are acquainted with two particular solutions of this equation , we may from them derive the general solution of the given equation .
If , however , the functions , and / are of such a nature that the two following equations are fulfilled eq. ( 1 ) becomes identical without assigning any particular value tof orf .
( The two conditions are a ( Yo ( x , y ) , ( x , y))=and / 3( ( x , y ) , ( x , y))=y ) .
It may be curious to enquire whether we can discover any forms which will satisfy these equations , for this purpose let us assume a ( x , y ) =a + bx + cy , and also f ( x , y ) a+ bx+cy , II this will only lead us to a particular solution , but I shall presently show that it may be rendered general .
If the two conditions already specified are fulfilled , the arbitrary constants will be ; 'determined , and we shall have the following equations a ( x , y ) a+ bx + by ab 3(xy ) =-b bx -by which may be thus generalised .
Let ?
be any function , and let 3x be the inverse of that function , so that , xx then the conditions will be fulfilled , if ( x , y)={ ( a + bP x+b7 } and ( x , y)= { a br by Some remarks , however , are necessary on the inverse function p. If we combine x and constant quantities by any of the direct operations , addition , multiplication , elevation of powers , &amp;c. the result which is called a function of x admits Igo only of one value , let z equal the function , then we have the equation z= -x .
If from ' this we endeavour to discover the value of x in terms of z , the operation is an inverse one and x admits of one or more values according to the nature of the operations denoted by o. This number may even be infinite ; if m denotes an equation of the nl degree , there are n values of x in terns of z. It may then be enquired whether in using the substitution en Iployed in the latter part of this Problem , any of these ( perhaps infinite number ) may be taken , or whether only certain particular values should be used ?
without attending.to this circumstance , our conclusions may become erroneous : all these different values will satisfy the equation px -=x , but only those must be used which also satisfy the equation ~ x=x : thus if z =pxa -xiwe shall have x -z V-ia-z if we employ the upper sign we have 4p ( t+ ' X ) " V ==.t. .
If we use the lowser one m )z==-1 / a(a t)_s -xxx- ' x the upper sign must therefore be taken , because in the latter part of the Problem we suppose ~ cpx= x and p % pie =y .
This remark , which is of some importance , extends to the -conclusions in my former Paper and to the whole of the subsequent enquiries .
The equation ( 1 ) might be considered as similar to the -original one , and the same transformation might be performed en this , and thus we might continue to deduce new conditions .
In the first part we found that the equation Ax oax always admitted of an easy solution when ox= x and by continuing the substitutions already pointed out , we should arrive at i9I some conclusions very analogotus for functional equations of the form of those treated of in this Problem , but the length to which these enquiries would lead , render it sufficient merely to indicate them .
In the equations solved in Problem I. and II .
it is obviously immaterial whether we first put ax instead of x , and then in the result put / 3y foi y or conversely ; but in the equation of Problems III .
and IV .
the case is different .
If in the function ( x , y ) we put simultaneously a ( x , y ) for x , and G ( x , y ) fory the result will be different from that which would arise from first putting s ( x , y ) for x and then in the result putting 3 ( x , y ) for y , or from inverting this operation ; the three results stand thus ^(X( j ) , ( X , y ) ) ( a ) 4( ( x , , ( x , y ) , 3 ( x , y ) ) ( b ) + ( X Ili ( X , Y ) ) , k ( Xnj ) ) ( b ) ~( , ( x( , y))3 ( o t.y ) , y ) ) ( c ) TiLesc three functions are evidently different , and in the solutions of the Problems , regard was only had to the first of them which may be called the simultaneous function .
Those , however , of the second and third class might occur , and it becomes necessary to point out the means of solution which are applicable to them .
According to the notation laid down , these functions may be thus expressed 4 I'( , ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) ( a ) B , '(t ( x. ) tr ( niy ) ) ( b ) B2 I(i ( X , y ) , t ( , ny ) ) ( c ) But to avoid the trouble of indices I slall show how those of the second and third class may be reduced to those of the first , I shall therefore always consider functions of the first order as simultaneous ones , and omit the indices , which if supplied , would be ' .
' , &amp;c. I , I To transform 4t .
' ( a x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) into a function whose index is ' put a ( x , ( x , y ) )= ( x , y ) then 1 , I I ) I , ' ( i ( x , y ) , ,y ) ) -))= t ( a(X , y ) , ( x , y ) ) and similarly if 1 ( o ( x , y ) , 3 ( x , y ) )=y ( x , y ) we should have x , II I 2 ' '( ( X , y ) , f ( X y ) ) ='( ( , y ) , y ( , ) ) and generally whatever be the number of variables a similar transformation might be effected .
PROBLEM Vo Required the solution of the equation .
( x , y ) =A ( x , y)j z ( ( x , ) , ( xy , Y ) ) Assume 4 ( x , y ) =J(x , y ) ( f ( xy ) , f ( , y ) and substituting this in the given equation , we find f(x , y ) { f(X , y ) , f(x , y ) }=A ( x , y)f ( ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) x { f( ( x( , y ) , ( x , y ) ) , f ( ( ( , y),1(x , y ) ) } This equation will be satisfied if we are acquainted withi particular solutions of the three following equations f(x , y ) =A ( x , y)f ( a(x , y ) , 2(x , y ) ) f ( x , y ) f(tx , y ) , e P ( T , y ) ' ) and f(x , y)f a ( M( , T)txy ) ) the first of these is nothing more than the original equation .
193 If therefore we know one particular solution of the original equation , and also one or two particular solutions of the other equation , we may deduce the general solution of the Problem .
Ex. Let ( xy)=( y)(y , x ) in this casef(x , y ) =f(y , x ) and two particular solutions are 11 J'(x , y ) = qy and f(x , y ) =3y also a particular solution of the given equation isf(x , y ) = , hence its general solution is ( ,2y ) =-7 ( x y , xy ) PROBLEM VI .
Given the equation ( x , y ) =AA ( xy ) ( x(i , y ) , ( t , Y ) )+B ( , y ) Suppose we are ac uainted with one particular solutiou which satisfies the equation and let it bef(x , y ) , then assume 4 ( x , y ) f(x , y ) +q ( x , y ) and making this substitution the equation becomes f ( x , y ) + ( p ( x , y ) =A(x , y)f ( a ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) +A(x , y ) x ( a ( , y ) , ( x , y ) ) B ( x , y ) Substracting from this the particular solution f ( x , y ) =A( , y)f ( ( , y ) , ( x , y ) ) + B(x , y ) there remains q ( x , y ) -A ( x , y ) q , ( a ( x , y ) , tl ( x , y ) ) an equation which may be solved by the preceding Problem .
The same substitution is applicable to the more general equation o=(x , y)+A ( x , ) a , ( c(x , y ) , x ( x , y))+ B(x , y ) ( 4(x , y , ,))+ &amp;c. +K ( , y ) 1C , PROBLEM VII .
Given the functions ( x , y ) , a ( X , Y ) , a ( C , Y ) &amp;c. I2 ( IAY , ) , ( a , Y ) , ( y , sY ) &amp;c. Required the nature of the function 4 ( x , y ) such that it shall not alter its form by the simultaneous substitution of ( x , y ) , 3 ( x , y ) for x and y , and generally that it shall remain the same when for x and y are respectively substituted any of the functions denoted by a ( x , y ) and A ( x , y ) .
The n conditions which determine 4 .
may be thus expressed AP ( ( ( , y ) = ( a ( x , y ) , y ( x , y))( , Y ) , ( x , y ) ) = &amp;c. Assume ( x , y)-{f(x , y ) , f(xyy ) } ( 1 ) then from the first condition we have ?
{ f( , y)fJy ) ) , }= { f(M(x , y ) , ( .x , y ) ) , f(x ( x , y ) , ( ( x , y ) ) } this will be satisfied by making f(x , y ) =f ( ( x , y ) , 3( x , y ) ) and f(x , y ) =f ( a(x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) these are two particular solutions of the first equation .
The second condition is 4 ( x , y ) = ( , ( x , y ) , ( , y ) ) xl which becomes ( Cxl , y ) , f ( x , y ) ) = ( f(a ( , y ) , ( X , y ) ) : f(x ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) ) ( 2 ) wheref and f are known functions ; make f( ( , y ) , a3 ( , y ) ) =K ( x , y ) and f( , y ) , A(i , y))'K ( x , y ) XI1K and TK are therefore also known functions .
Asstume qp ( , ,y ) == , ( f(v , y ) , f(x , y ) ) , then equation ( 2 ) v { ( / C(x , yA):(x , yG)):( J( ?
, y ) , f( , ,y ) ) } = f ?
{ f(K(x , y ) , 'K(x , y ) ) , ?
'(K ( , y ) 'K ( , y ) ) } This equation must be solved in the same manner as the forner by means of two particular solutions , and by continuing zte same 1neithod , we shall find that the-form of the function i may be determined by means of 2n particular solutions of certain fuictional equations , when there are n pair of conditions assigned .
A less general solution may , however , be found when we are only acquainted with n particular solutions .
A similar method would lead us to the form of 4 ' , whatever might be the number of variables .
If , however , we are acquainted with any number of particular solutions which remain the same , in all the cases assigned by the conditions of the Problem , we may have the general solution by making +-= f3tf , { f ; 11f } f , f,..f being it i particular solutions .
i % Ex. Let it be required to find a symmetrical function of I , x ?

We may , therefore , find n different particular solutions , and the general solution will be any arbitrary function of all these particular solutions , or -:9 +i ) *[f ) S ( ] ) , S(cm ) , .

9 , 1o , and 14 , Part I. ) we put arbitrary functions of y instead of the constant quantities which occur , we shall have a solution of the given equation , thus a partib--x cular solution of xx isf ( x ) C instead of c put % ( y ) then a solution of the given equation is b- .

The equations A " '(x , y ) = ( , y ) and r ' " ( x , y ) =a ( , y ) may be treated in a similar manner , in the firsty must be considered as constant , and x munst be so treated in the latter .
In general , when functions are taken only relative to one of the variables , the rules delivered in my former Paper are sufficient for their solution , such is the equation F { X , y ) 4 ( x , y ) , .
( 2CyY ) .
' ( X , y ) } = It might however occur , that though the order of the function does not vary relative to the other variable , yet that that variable may occur in different forms in each function .
An example will render this more evident a , 3 , &amp;c. being known functions , let Fie ( , yt , t ( tie ) , dt3o 1( y ) , *n ' J ( x vi ) t= o here though the functions do not vary in order relative toy , 198 yet they do vary in a certain sense , because y is differently contained under each functional characteristic ; the method of treating these kind of equations will be explained hereafter .
PROBLEM IX .
Given the functional equation ^^QG1 , y)-o This signifies that the second simultaneous function is equal to zero .
It is evident that x--y or y -x will be a particular solution , for if 4 ( x , y ) =x -y we have 34 , ( , y)= ( ( x , y ) , ( Ay ) ) = ( x -- ) -(-y)=0 By observing the process just gone through , it appears that it would equally succeed if for x we putf ( x ) and for y we pultf(y ) for if , ( x , y ) =fx -fy , we have 2 , ( y ) = ( jI -fy ) ( fx -fy ) =o This solution is con siderably more general than the former , yet is by no means the complete solution , a more general one may be obtained thus : we found one particular solution to be 4(x , y ) = --y , now if we multiply the right side of this equation by an arbitrary function of x and y the condition will still be fulfilled ; for if ?

The relation between ?
( x , y ) == px + qy and " , " ( x , y ) =(p + q)f-I ( p qy ) is very remarkable , it appears from this , that in the present case in going from the ntb to the n1 + 1tb simultaneous function , we have only to multiply by the sum of the co-efficients of the original function .
On enquiring a little more minutely into the cause of this circumstance , it will be found that it depends on the original function containing x and y of the same dimensions in all its terms , or Inore generally that the expression of ( x , y ) is homogeneous .
Let us now assume some homogeneous function , and examiwe its second and higher simultaneous functions , let 4j ( x , y ) ax + byP +y"+ &amp;c. the second simultaneous function is,22(x , y)-a { x , ( , y)l +.tb ( x Y)n+ c{ ( x).y)}+ &amp;c. or " ,2(x , y)= { ( xy ) { a+b+c+ &amp;c. } =(,1 ) ( ) }(a ) If we now take the simultaneous third functions we have 3,3( y ) ( 1 , ) ?

zy + ye x2 &lt; y + 9y The properties of homogeneous functions are so nearly connected with the solution of equations containing simultaneous functions , that it will be convenient to examine into them a little farther , and to adopt some means of denoting them with brevity .
In order to signify that a function of several variables has in each of its terms the sum of the indices of any two of them always the same , I shall make use of a line placed beneath those two variables : thus , ( _y ) signifies an homogeneous function of x and y ; and A as it may be convenient also to denote the sum of the two it.dices , I shall place it underneath on the outside of the parenthesis ; thus thien the expression , ( a , y ) denotes any q homogeneous function of c and y of the qth degree .
A func .
tion of three variables : , y , and z , may be homogeneous , with respect to two of them ( x and y ) in one sense , and also relative to y and z in another ; but it does not from thence follow that it will be homogeneous relative to all three , such a function would be denoted thus 4(x , y , z ) ( P qa particular case of this expression is x ' z ' + x3yz= ( x , y , z ) This notation being premised , we have the f6llowing theorems relative to hornogeneous functions .

( X , y)= 7 ( l , 1 ) T'(- , Y)nj P ( I( , ) the following is another solution of the same question Assume takinj let a(a+ bx + cxL + &amp;c. 1 by + cxy Cy ( x , y ) = &lt; .

I am inclined to think , that this solution is not the most general of which the Problem admits , even though the series were continued back , as it might , to negative powers of x and y. The two solutions which follow are possibly more general , although on this point I am not certain .
It would indeed be a very important step , if we could assign the number and nature of the arbitrary functions which enter into the complete solution of functional equations .
Another solution of the equation 2 ' 2(x , y)-= a may be thus deduced , let ( x )m~ Y , ( ' Y ) &amp; c } K then taking the secondl simultaneous function on both sides , .
it will be perceived by the construction of the second side of the equation , that ( , y)= I ) : ( , ) ' , &amp; CJ tall the right side of the equation A , then a ver y genesal oQ6 solution of our equation is + ( X ) AP axJ A a(x'.Y)m , ( _ , .

Another solution may be found in the following manner : let ( y ( x ( x )K and determine x so that % ( x , y ) = % ( x , y ) when y is made iI equal to x , then taking the second simultaneous functions on both sides , we have ( X , y ) = ) ( K , K ) a general solution of the equation in question is , therefore ~ ( 5a , y)X@( ) ( X , y ) this solution depends on that of the equation ( x , y ) --z ( , y ) CY --= which belongs to a class of equations we shall speak of hereafter .

Required the solution of the equation F{ ( x , y ) , 4 ' z ( x , y ) , .

If in the function 4 ( x , y ) we put y equal to x it becomes 4 ( x , x ) call this qpx : then if in the second simultaneous function of 4 ( x , y ) we put y equal x , the result will be the same as if we had taken the second function of 4 ( x , x ) or px relative to x , or symbollically expressed , it is .
( z9Yx , ) = ( x( ) , ( x , x ) ) , = X [ y xthis may be rendered evident by substituting for the right side of the equation its value , ( ( x , y ) , 4 ' ( x , y ) ) .
212 In the same manner it may be shown , that if we take the pt simultaneous function , and then put x for y , the result will be the same as the pth function of px , or expressed in symbols it is ?
P , 'p ( x , y ) = qP(x ) [ y ] Now since this equation is identical when y is equal to x , it will remain so when any other quantity as v is put for x , if the same quantity is also put for y , therefore 4P P(v , v ) = 9(v ) now let v=t ( x , y ) this equation becomes tP-P( , ( x , y ) , , ( x , y ) ) =9 qP ( , y ) but the right side of this equation is nothing more than the p-11th simultaneous function of 4 ( , y ) , consequently p +P Ii pP I , ( x , y ) = , tp ( x , y ) If now in the equation of the Problem we substitute the several values thus formed of the simultaneous functions , we shall have F{4 ( x , y ) , , ( x , y ) , p2 ( x , y ) , .

Part I. PROBLEM XX .
Given the equation -4 , I ( , y )= q , ' , ( x , Y ) This equation , containing no simultaneous function , is different from any we have yet solved , and requires the application of a peculiar artifice .
In my former Paper , in order to reduce the equation q , x=-o m to one of the first order , I made use of the substitution &lt; Pfp x for Jx:an analogous one must be employed on the present occasion ; let us suppose ( x , y ) pf ( px , p y ) the effect of this will be very similar to that of the one just alluded to , and its great utility will be evident by considering its result in the various orders of the same function , thus 2p , ( ( x , y ) p ( ( cp f(p x ) , q pie ) =f ( ( ( Px pie ) , ( pie ) _ ) ' ) fZ 1 ( ( px , qy ) I , Z(x , Vi )= -pf ( xp , pfqf(x , Pie ))= 'f ( qx , f(c p , Pie ) ) q-J , , ( px , y),2(x , y)=4 ) f()pc f(cpx , Pie ) , ( P f((Px , ( pie ))p f(f ( cp , ( y ) , f( gx , y))=c ) f 2 ' z( Qpx , pie ) and continuing the same substitutions we shall find 43 ' , ( ( X , y )_ f3 ( ( p , ( y ) and 3A , 3( , y ) ='f I b3(x , qy ) and generally an m(x , y ) = ?
fn , m( pX , Pie ) If there are more variables than two , the proper substitution to be made is ( , I , .
)=z 'Jx , , &amp; cI ( 2 , ?
,. . ?
)x2ixai and there would result generally n , m , p , &amp; c _ n , m ) p , &amp;c. ( x , ). .
)= f(Qpx(p , , ... q(x ) By such substitutions all simple functional equations of every order and of any number of variables , may be reduced to those of the first order : but the difficulty is not then overcome , the resulting equations are by no means easy to solve , and in a variety of cases it appears , that they are contradictory or impossible .
Let us apply this substitution to the equation of this Problem , then since ( x , y ) = c('f ( px , qy ) we have Pfxp xfI ( y ) I ( p xj y ) Performing the operation denoted by ?
p on both sides it becomes f2 , ( X px , Up y ) =f " 2 ( p x , pie ) Put qx for x and , y fory then it becomes f2 , x ( x ; y)zf,2(x , y ) which is nothing more than the original equation ; from it , however we learn , that if we can find one particular solution , we can always deduce from it the general one , which supposingf a particular case , will be ( x , ) 'f f( , ( p y ) After repeated endeavours I have been unable to find any particular case which will satisfy the equation ?
t , ( x , y)= , 2"(x , y):i7 I have also made some attempts at discovering particular solutions of the two following equations , and have met with no success , Z4 2 " ( x , y ) =4 , ' ( x , y ) and , y , ( x , y)=4 , i(x , Y ) Should , however , any particular case be found , their general solutions flow immediately from the method just explained .
With regard to the equation of the Problem , y ( x , y ) = , 2z(xj , ) , I have little expectation of finding any particular case , as I think the following reasoning , though perhaps not quite so satisfactory as might be wished , will show the impossibility of it .
First , let us suppose , that 4 ( x , y ) is a symmetrical function of x and y , let it be X ( x , y ) then our equation becomes x{x( , ( y ) } , Y}=x( % ( x )}=Y ) X(X y%(Y ) , X } Comparing the first of these expressions with the third , we may observe that in the first , wherever X ( x , y ) occurs , the same quantity .
( , 3 ) also occurs in the third , consequently in this respect , the first and third are identical : but wherever y occurs in the first , x occurs similarly in the third , therefore in this respect they cannot be identical , unless y is equal to x. From this it appears , that the equation in question cannot be solved by any symmetrical function .
Again , the given equation 2 , I(X ) , = i , 2( ( , y ) contains x and y in the same manner , and no reason can be assigned why in the solution x should be contained differently from y : this may , perhaps , be made more clear , thus .
Letf ( x , y ) be the quantity to which each side of the given equation is equal , then , 1 , , ( x , y ) =f=(x y ) = A1l 2( , y ) Now since , ( { ( x , y ) , y ) ==f ( x , y ) and also x , ( x , y ( x , y))=5 3l8 f ( x , y ) ; and since taking the second functions is a direct operation , it is evident that the original function c ( x , y ) will produce the same result , whether we take the second function relative to x or relative to y ; therefore it must be similarly composed of x and y ; that is to say , it must be symmetrical relative to x and y : but we have before shown that no symmetrical function can satisfy the equation , consequently the equation is contradictory .
This train of reasoning I offer with considerable hesitation , well aware of the extreme difficulty of reasoning correctly on a subject so very general , and which , from its novelty , the mind has not been sufficiently habituated to consider , so as to rely with confidence on any lengthened process of reasoning .
I thought it , however , right to mention this proof , that those who may seek for particular cases , might first enquire whether the equation be possible .

Given the equation F [ { ( x , y ) , x } F { a , 4 xI ( x , y ) } making the substitution p Tf(p x , ~y ) for 3 ( x , y ) and in the result putting Px for x , and 'y for y , we shall find F p{f ( y ) , p } =F{a , f &gt; z ( X y ) } which will become identical if we select such a value forf ( , y ) that qp f2 ( x , y ) = a , and alsof2,9 ( x , y ) =x such a value isf ( x , y ) == ( pa + y ; hence the general solution of the Problem is 3 ( x , y ) =c ( ( a + py -+ 4 x ) the more general equation { ( 4 ( x , y ) x } F x , , ( , ( xy ) &amp;c. } C == / Z ( x , y ) .

The form to be assigned tof is of some consequence ; it ought to be a particular solution of the original equation : for if we assign to it any other form , this adds a limitation to the original equation which may or may not agree with it , a particular solution should therefore always be employed .
This remark is applicable to several Problems in my former Paper , and with this restriction , their solutions will remain correct .
PROBLEM XXVII .
To transform the equation F { x , y , 4 ( r , y ) , ,2 I ( ax , Py ) , I , ,2 ( zx , y ) , &amp;c. }= o into the form of the equation of the preceding Problem .
Assume ( x , y ) q= 'f(( x , pie ) , then the equation becomes F { x , y , 'f ( x , py ) , cP , 1 ( s , , y ) , / Il(2p , y ) ) , &amp;c. =o find for p by Prob. VII .
Part I. such a value that it shall not change when any of the following quantities are substituted for x , X ~a %~I , ax ~X &amp;c. &amp;c. let this value be A , then the equation becomes F{x , y , A ( A A f)A f'(A , Ay ) , y , c. } =o 923 or putting Ax for x , and Ay fory we have x{ , A y , A( , y ) , Af J2 , ( , y ) , A fi,2 ( , y ) &amp;c. } =o o an equation of the required form .
One important use of this transformation is the solution of equations of the form F { x , y , ( } y)= , 2 ( , y ) 8I ZXy ) , &amp; C o in which the functions are taken only relative to y , and yet x is not altogether constant .
It may be transformed into F 5 , y , 4 ( x , y ) , - ' , ( X , y ) , ,3 ( .
, y ) , &amp;c. } =o which may be treated as an equation of one variable , a being constant .
This is the species of equation alluded to at page ( 198 ) After considering the various equations amongst the higher orders of functions , another question presents itself , which maybe thus stated .
What must be the form of a function of ( n ) variables , such that taking the functions relative to any or to all of them any number of times , and combining these quantities in any mazinner , the result shall ( when all these variables are made equal to x ) be equal to a given function of x ?
This question might thus be expressed when there are only two variables FV{ , y , A ( , y ) , , Xz(X , y ) , ,x2 I ( x , y ) , &amp;c. }=/ ( a ) y=x ] this condition obviously enlarges the signification of the function A , and the solutions ought to be more general .
We shall accordingly find that some equations , of which without this condition we cannot find even a particular solution , are capable , when it is added , of very extensive ones .
When there are more than two variables , the condition may be , that making 224 them equal by pairs , the result shall be given : a particular case would be the equation F x , y , z , v , zw , r,4(x , y , z , v , w , r , &amp;c. } =F { X , r ) r[ ] Instead of making y equal to x , and z to v and so on , y might become a given function of x , and za given function of v , &amp;c. thus : F x , y , z , vw , r , ( x , y , z , v , w , r , ) , &amp;c. |=F x , v , r , z _=V ] a few examples will sufficiently explain the method to be pursued in treating these equations .
PROBLEM XXVIII .
Given the equation + 2}(XZ .
) tr 2 , ( tie ) CY-X ] This Problem , of which without the condition of y being made equal to x we could not find even a particular case , readily admits of solution in its present state .
Since t , '(L , y ) is only equal to X , 2 ( x , y ) , when y=x we may put for the given equation I()X , y ) { y ( XY ) Ai 2 y ) } ( l ) provided that when y is equal to x , the latter side of the equation shall become I ( x , y ) , and this fully satisfies the condition of the Problem .
If , therefore , we can find such a value of 0 , the equation ( ) may be treated as a common functional equation of two variables , and may be solved by the rules already given .
Nor is it at all difficult to find such a value of p ; if we make ' , 2 ( , y)=-z , q must be such a function that ( y , Z)= .
Cy= ] 225 It is evident that particular values of p are x--y + and many others might be mentioned , but it is desirable to determine cp more generally Since q ( x , y , z ) =z [ y -= it is evident that p ( , x , z ) =z and since this is independent on any particular value of x we have q , ( v , v , z ) = that is to say , that whatever quantity is substituted for x , if the same quantity is also substituted for y , the result will be equal to z. Now let v= cp ( x , y , z ) , it becomes p { qp(x , y , Z ) ) P ( X , Z ) , Z ) } = but this expression is nothing more than the second simultaneous function relative to x and y , and may be therefore more concisely expressed thus 2 2 , 2I ( X , y , z ) =z in which equation , since it does not vary relative to x , that quantity may be considered as a constant ; and the equation ap 2 2(X , y ) % =X constant being solved , we have only to substitute instead of the various constant quantities arbitrary functions of z : thus then the solution of the equation &lt; P ( x , Y)= CY=X is reduced to that of 422 ( x , y ) = constant and we have only to refer to Problem ( lo ) for its general solution .
Let us apply this to the solution of the equation of this Problem 42 , I ( x , y ) =4 I2 ( , y ) Cy =x Se6 take as a particular case of the equation p,2 I(x , y , z ) = z ?
( x , y , z ) -y z , then the equation of the Problem becomes Y , , , ( x , y ) =I2 ( x , y ) or y,1 ( x , y ) =x 42 ( x , y ) this is the equation solved in Prob. XXI .
therefore all its solutions are also solutions of this equation .
This however is , comparatively speaking , but a very limited answer : every different solution of the equation ( p2 , 2I ( x , y , z ) = % furnishes a new solution of our Problem , containing one or more arbitrary functions ; each of these may very justly be called a general solution ; but to investigate the number and nature of the arbitrary constants which enter into the complete solution , is an enquiry of considerable difficulty .
PROBLEM XXIX .
Given the equation 2 , 2}n ?
I.~ ( x y)-F ( x ) [ yg This signifies , that after taking the second function relative to x , and then the second relative to y ; the result is considered merely as a function of x , and its ntb function taken relative to that variable : lastly , the quantity to which this becomes equal , after perlforming these operations , is given .
The manner of treating these equations is very simtple ; put , 2 ( x ) X ) = ' x ) , then our equation becomes 2 , }n AI ?
2(XZy)=xX)=F(Z ) [ =(x ) ] determine x from the equation z= xF ( x ) by Prob. XIII .
Part L. and let its solutiont be F ( x ) , then we have 2,2( , y , ) F( ) [ y =X MIDCCCXVI .
Hh Je7 This equation may be solved by nearly the same method as that employed in the last Problem .
If the function occurs in different shapes or of various orders , this method is inapplicable , as in the following Problem .
PROBLEM XXX .
Given the equation F 2 , I)2 ( xy),412)3(Uy ) , y } =o CY =j The difficulties in this case appear to be much increased from this circumstance , that the second function of 2 , I(x , x ) relative to x is quite different from the second function of TI , '(x , x ) relative to the same quantity .
The method of solution which I shall explain is equally applicable to all of this species , and consists in reducing them to a class which has been already solved .
It may be observed , that whether we take the second function of 42 ' , ( x , x ) relative to x , or whether we take the simultaneous function of,2 I ( x , y ) considered as a simple function , and in the result put x for y , the two expressions will be the same ; the first gives 2 , I ( 12 , ( 1 ) 2 , I ( , ) ) ) and the second is which when y becomes equa to is identical with te forer which when y becomes equal to x is identical with the former ; but ( ,2 2(1(X6 , y),121 '(j , y))=2~,1 { ( ~ ( X ) , ) , j ) , ( ( y)y ) } 2 , I , x I , IIXIXI -=d ( , y ) the lower line of indices denoting the quantities relative to which the operations are performed .
In a similar manner it may be shown , that i , , , 2 , 2 , 2)3 1 , y2 = , 2 , 2A ( xy)-=A ( X , y ) 298Substituting these values in the original equation , we have 2 ) 1 , I9 1I I , 2 , 2,2 2 12 , 2I , 2X 2 , I1 2 , 2 F{ ( x , y ) , A ( x , y ) , x , y}=o Cy=xJ This is an equation similar to that of Problem XXVIII .
, and may be solved by the same means .
JVew methods of solcing functional equations of the first order , and also dffierentialfunctional equations .
The new methods which I now propose to explain are only applicable to equations of the form F { , 4x , x , 4ix a,. .
4nz } =o where a must be such a function that an+ x=x .
By the method of Prob. VII .
Part I all functional equations of the first order may be reduced to this form ; and although in many cases this reduction is very difficult , or even in the present state of analysis out of our power , yet it is theoretically possible , and we shall therefore consider all equations as so reduced .
There is this remarkable difference between the former methods and the present one ; Those which I have already given always led to the general solution , and perhaps , in some cases , to the complete one ; these , on the contrary , which I shall now propose , always conduct us directly to a particular solution , which does not contain even an arbitrary constant .
It has , however , several advantages ; it is the most direct method with which we are yet acquainted ; and if by any means we could introduce into these solutions an arbitrary constant , it would afford us general ones : this is a step which is wanting to connect it with the former methods .
In the case of differential functional H h equations , this step is supplied by the integrations which are necessary , and we thus arrive at their general solutions .

f^ 4.I^^ and generally when on x =sx the form of Ax is determined by the equation .
fx facx fax +--f x &amp; C. foxx + &amp; It may be observed , that this method of discovering particular solutions by elimination , will not apply when the given equation contains only the different forms of the function without the variable quantity itself : thus it is not applicable to the equation F{ Ax , 0aX,. .
aX}= the reason of this is obvious ; for if we eliminate from this equation ( by means of the n equations which arise by changing the order in which the functions are placed ) , all the functions but { x , we shall have a result containing nothing but ix and constant quantities , and therefore , 'x is equal to a constant quantity : it is true such a value of Ax will satisfy the equation , but it scarcely deserves the name of a solution .
Another exception is , when the equation F x{ , Jx , 4 , t , &amp;c. X ce}x =o is homogeneous relative to the different forms of the unknown function ; for in this case when we attempt to eliminate them , they all disappear together , leaving an equation of condition ; thus given 4x = ( a x ) ox c and ox=x we have 4oax = ( a ax ) tx =(a axg ) x and 4x =a ( a- , x ) ( a--ax ) 4x or 1= ( a--c_ ) ( a--x ) which equation is not necessarily true .
233 Another exception is , when the given equation can be made to assume the form In this case the equation cannot be fulfilled unless fx is a symmetrical function of x , s , &amp;c. a"x , because the first side is such a symmetrical function : this reason , however , should be received with caution , for if the operation denoted by be an inverse one , it may admit of several values , and it seems possible , that in such a case the condition relative to the form off need not be fulfilled .
In my former paper I explained the means of finding solutions of the equation , a xx .
I then contented myself with explaining the theory without mentioning particular cases ; as these latter may be required in our present enquiry , I shall subjoin the following particular solutions of px =x 4x=log ( a-ex ) , x=x-log(e-l1 ) Jx=---x X--I 4x/ = I4 x=tan ( a--tanx ) , kx= a-bx - ' ( sin ( a-x ) 4x= r-4=tan 1x b+c 4Cr Tcos a Cos X Particular cases of A3 x=x a12 _l Val-a ' a-x --X Ia5 ( axn-a- ) nx ac ' 'X ac-ex XI XA --n a --Xn O " ?

Ex. i. Given the equation d4 , x ( a x ) d= in this case i , and the differential equation is zd2+dz=o its integral is z =3 ( a x ) b cos x +c sin x. The two constant quantities which have entered by integration must be determined so as to satisfy the original equation .
This condition gives -b cos aI sin a the quantity b still remaining arbitrary ; the solution of the equation 4 ( a x ) x is therefore b cos a4x=b cos ( a -x ) i sin ( a-x ) Ex. 2 .

Let us suppose this to be changed into an arbitrary function of x , and let us determine what conditions it must be subject to , that it may satisfy the Problem : taking the second example we have 4= ( x -pxp ).r and the equation becomes P -pi I --P P+i d dvp dP-pxP +1 _X-px^ )p ?
=(x -pX + dx x from this equation px must be determined ( the method of doing which will appear in a subsequent Problem ) .
If this solution contains an arbitrary constant , the same process may be again repeated .
We may thus continue deducing one solution from another as long as we can solve the differential equations to which they give rise , but still these will only be particular solutions .

In the same manner +aP-3x may be eliminated , and the process may be continued until the last equation will only contain x , Ax and their diffIrentials ; this equation must be integrated , and it will determine the value of Ax in terms of x.

If after satisfying the conditions of the Problem , there remain any arbitrary constants , we may suppose them functions of x , and new equations will thence arise by which they may be determined .
It might occur ( when there are several arbitrary quantities ) that , by assigning particular values to some of them , the others might remain in a certain degree arbitrary , should this be the case , we should obtain general solutions .

I shall therefore refrain from giving any more examples , and proceed to show how functional equations involving definite integrals may be reduced to those we have already treated .
Such equations might occur in a variety of curious and interesting enquiries , few of which have yet been noticed .
D'ALEMBERT , in one of the volumes of his Opuscules , has examined a question which may be referred to tis class ; it is the following .
Suppose a sphere composed of particles of matter , what mustbe the law of attraction amongst these particles , so that the force of the whole sphere acting on a particle at a distance , may follow the same law ?
the question might be varied by supposing the law to be given , and the form of the solid to be required ; 341 but the general solution of such questions is by no means easy .
PROBLEM XXXVII .
Required the nature of the function 4 such that dx 4 ' x= Ca the integral being taken between the limits x=o and x=a .
Assume v ( x , v ) such that ( X , v ) , ( o , v ) =v the form of p may be ascertained from this equation by means already described .
Then if we make fdxT i= cp ( , 4a ) ( 1 ) it is evident that between the two limits x=o and x= a , the integral will be reduced to 4a , and we have therefore a differential functional equation whose mode of solution has already been pointed out .
Other more complicated equations may be solved in the same way ; these I shall omit .
I shall , however , make some observations on this method of solution , with a view to point out some questions of considerable importance .
In equation ( 1 ) the function indicated by p is so assumed that we may have , ( a , Ja ) ( o , ,a ) a ?
a from which , perhaps , it might be imagined , that qc ( x , +a ) must contain only x , ,a and constant quantities , but the condition would still be fulfilled if it contained 42a , 43a , or na , which though not actually variable cannot strictly be regarded as constant .
To fix our ideas , let us consider the example in this Problem ; one value of p ( x , Ca ) is evidently qp ( x , ?
a ) wa , we have therefore Jdx 'x x= aa and by differentiating n-i from which.ix may be found .
This is a solution derived from a certain form attributed to p , but we might also give to v the form &lt; p ( x , Za)= ; a'T ( xP a)f a,. .
" * a ) and , in that case , the equation to be solved would be + -/ a + d( ( a -a)f ( a , a , 'a,. .
a ) this contains only the second function of the unknown quantity and must be solved as a second functional equation , considering a , ,a , &amp; c , ,"a as constant quantities ; let its solution be 4x =F{x .
, a , , a,. .
}"a ( a ) then we must put x= and determine , a from the equation a= F{a , a , a,.4 4.a } the value of ?
a thus deduced , will furnish the values of 4 , a , &amp;c. o"a , and these being substituted in a , will give the value of , x ; this solution is evidently of a different nature from the former , and forms another species .
Again , the following form of m will also agree with the conditions x ( x , a ) = , pa -+xP(xa)gf a , ,a , / .
a , .
/ X , x , I x , x ... 'kx ] which being substituted in the Problem mx must be found from a functional equation of the khb order ; x must then be put equal to a , and the new functional equation of the nt order relative to a must be solved ; this is a third species of solution different from either of the former .
Respecting these three species of solutions , a very important question may be proposed .
What degree of generality does each possess , and how many and what sort of arbitrary functions does each solution involve ?
To discuss this question , and to point out the nature of other solutions yet more general , which may be found for these and other similar Problems , would far exceed the limits of a mere outline of the calculus .
I shall conclude my remarks on this Problem by stating the plan to be pursued in one particular case , which may serve as a model for all similar operations .
Take as the form of q ( x , { a ) p ( z , 4a ) = ( z-a ) ^o---oa aa then we have d. X^X a-^x 4x X JAx = ( Z ( X -a ) ar %1 dx i\ J +20 4Z aa o0 ' this is a differential functional equation which must be solved on the hypothesis of a , { a , ~a , 4'o and a-o , being constant quantities .
Let its solution be x =_ F x , a , fa , g +a , to , o(1 ) we must now put x=a and treat the resulting equation as one of the second order , considering +o and +Vo as constants .
Let its solution be 4a=F{a , F o , ys0o ( s ) Now substitute o for a retaining o as a letter instead of making it actually zero , there will result a new functional equation of the second order , whose solution is o=F{ o } and lastly , substituting this value of to , and also that of 3to which may be deduced from it in ( 2 ) we have the value , of ?

For y put ay and the equation becomes , ( l x y ) d(x , ay ) d , ( x , y ) differentiate this relative to x , then we have d ( x , ( ay ) d_ ( Z , ) y ) dx dxz this substituted in the original equation , gives 3r ( , d Y)=(dx which is a partial differential equation , whose solution is ( x , y ) == 7Y + cyY qy and pie being two arbitrary functions of y , so constituted as to fulfil the original equation .
These may thus be determined , since 4 ( x , y ) = Eg~y + e , Y we have d(x , _Y )=y and , since these two quantities must be equal , we have the following equations pie a ( ~py and qy =-q the former f these is easily satisfied by putting for pie any symmetrical function ofy and ay ; and a particular solution of the latter is -y= ( -Y + ay ) c and since this solution contains an arbitrary constant , it may Kk be changed by Prob.

Take the equation ( , y ) -a-Y ) in this case Oy==a--y , and the general solution is 3 ( x , y ) == q , ( y , a-Y ) +E ( a - , y ) O ( y , a-yy ) Ex. 2 .

Given the equation , ~ ( z , y ) -d4(x , ay ) dx supposing aPy =y .
By substituting successively ay , c2y , &amp;c. ap-xy for y , we have the following equations f , Y_ d , ( x ay ) dx , ( Xz , Y d ) = &amp; $ &amp;c. &amp;c. + ( , ~-y)-d ( ) Y ) " ~ dx s46 Froin the first of these we may eliminate dx4 ( by means of the differential of the second , and from the result d4 ( ' , Xy y ) dx may be eliminated by means of the differential of the third .
And by continuing this process , observing that + ( x , Pie ) =V ( , y ) we shall find ( x , y ) dxyt this partial differential equation must be solved , and the arbitrary functions which enter into its integral , must be made to satisfy the conditions of the Problem .

Amongst the numerous questions to which the calculus of functions is applicable , I shall select a problem proposed by EULER in one of the volumes of the Acta Acad. Petrop .
as it will offer an example of a mode of treating of functional equations of a nature yet more general than those contained in this paper .
5st PROBLEM XLII .
Required the nature of a curve such that taking any ordinate DB , and drawing a normal at the point D , the next ordinate CE raised at the foot of the normal shall be equal to that normal .
Let AB = x , BD -y and y=x be the equation of the curve , then BC= Y dx ' and DC vi '+ Yand by the condition of the Problem we have .

+ xd4i r x^rd xT p\ EXT3 +d |+ zYd1 tx+ ( a ) This is apparently a very difficult functional equation , and I am not acquainted with any direct method of solving other similar ones .
It is in fact only from a peculiar condition which this equation involves that any solutions have been obtained , the condition to which I allude is , that the quantity 4'xd+ does dx , ~ -Ja4 expressed not change , when for x we substitute x+ or expressed in symbols , that L 953 ax x4x )d , !

, &lt; d ( 1 ?
d(x d\ ' XT dx | From this it appears , that the subnormal is constant in the same series of ordinates , but it does not follow that it must be constant in different series ; this property , viz. that 4x dJx does not change when x becomes x+ dx ill fturnish us with a solution of the equation in question ; for ( a ) becomes by putting t for dx E ?
( x + t)g"E'P x5~=Y where t may be considered as a constant quantity , the general solution of this equation is et being an arbitrary function of t , therefore the general solution of eq. ( a ) is 4/ xm'v '-d + ( 4/ t x ) or y= xjy yd from which differential equation the curves which satisfy the Problem may be found .
It ought , however , to be observed , that the constant quantity introduced by integration , is not perfectly arbitrary , it must be determined so as to make the equation between x and y fulfil the equatio ( a ) .
If for instance , we assum2 2 ( YY ) to be equal to a yY , we should find the equation of the curve to bo== ( a +)cc being the constant tatroduced by integration , and on sutb stituting this value ofy in ( a ) we shall ind = o , so that y= ( a+ )o Let us suppose a to be infinite and equal to !
, then we have y ( 1 +x ) =b +cx= b , since c= o which is the equation of a straight line parallel to the axis of the 's , which in fact agrees with the conditions of the Problem .
If we suppose cp ( ~y -sdY a_=a constant quantity , we should find x -cVy -a ' this value beilg substituted in ( a ) gives for determining cthe equation e ( C+ 1)==o whence c=o and c--+ / -1 , using this latter value we have a=/ lx -y2=s-y2 which is the equation of the circle , and it is obvious , that this curve satisfies the conditions .
It is very necessary to attend to this mode of determiining the constants , as we should otherwise meet in the solution with many curves which do not satisfy the conditions ; thus in the last example , the curve is apparently an hyperbola , but owing to the constant becoming imaginary , it is in fact a circle .
To complete the outline of this new method of calculation , it would be necessary to treat of equations involving two or more functional characteristics , and to explain methods of eliminating all but one of them : these lead to a variety of interesting and difficult enquiries , and will probably be of considerable use in completing the solutions of partial differential equations : it would also be proper to consider the maxima and minima of functions , and to apply to this subject the method of variations ; these are points of considerable difficulty , and although I have made some little progress in each of them , I shall forbear for the present any farther discussion on this subject .
In the mean time , the sketch which I have offered , and the few applications I have given , are sufficient to point out the great importance of this method .
It should however be observed , that its applications have only been noticed incidentally ; my object has been to direct the attention of the analyst to a new branch of the science , and to point out the manner of treating it : the doctrine of functions is of so general a nature , that it is applicable to every part of mathematical enquiry , and seems eminently qualified to reduce into one regular and uniform system the diversified methods and scattered artifices of the modern analysis ; from its comprehensive nature , it is fitted for the systematic arrangement of the science , and from the new and singular relations which it expresses , it is admirably adapted for farther improvements and discoveries , 256 same variable , then die , dz , dw , * are expressions proportional to the derived func tions of y , zs , w. whatever may be the variable of which they are common functions .
Iene e Wy =-Dz ; and if y be a function of x , or = ( ) , then d= Dop ( x ) De = Dp ( x ) and.- , die dx .
Dp ( x ) .
Moreover , since the derived functions are in the limiting ratio of the increments , so also are the fluxions .
From this consideration we can in the applications of analysis , practically determine the ratio of the fluxions , when the derived functions are unknown .
