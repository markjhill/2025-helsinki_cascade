Directions for the use of the foregoing Tide-table .
Note , that when by reason of long Droughts in Summer , or continual hard Frosts in Winter , the Fresh Waters are low , as also when the Wind blows hard at N. or N W. the Tides may hold up longer in the River of Thames , then the time showed in the Table , by half an hour .
But when the Wind blows hard at W. or W by S. or there are great Freshes ; they hold not out so long by sometimes near half an hour .
