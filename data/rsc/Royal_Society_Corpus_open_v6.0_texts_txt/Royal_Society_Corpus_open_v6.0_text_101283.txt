An Extract Of a Letter , written by D. B. to the Publisher , concerning the present Declination of the Magnetic Needle , and the Tides , May 23 .
1668 .
SIr , I here present you with a Scheme of the Magnetical Variations , as it was sent me by Capt. Samuel Sturmy , an experienced Seaman , and a Commander of a Merchant Ship for many years ; who ( as he assures me ) took the Observations himself in the presence of Mr. Staynred , an ancient Mathematician , &amp; others , in Rownham-Meadowes by the water-side , in some such approach , I think , to Bristol , as Lime-house or the Fields adjoining are to London .
This ( as the Table shows ) was taken June 13 .
1666 .
They observed again in the same day of the next year , viz. June 13 .
1667 ; and then they found the Variation increased about 6 .
minutes Westerly .

June next following , with a Quadrant of 6 foot radius , accurately divided into minutes , and with a very good Needle about 8 .
inches long ; and he doubts not , but the Observations shall be as exactly made , as can be done by any Men in any place of the World .
He adds , that he has found in several places or Meridians , upon his own Observations , from 2 .
min. to 7 .
minuts some difference .
In this Table he notes the greatest distance or difference to be 14 .
minutes ; and so taking the mean for the true Variation , he concludes it then and there to be just 1 .
deg. 27 .
min. viz. June 13 .
1666 .
The same person promises an exact account concerning Tides there , according to the directions formerly given in the Transactions .
At present he assures from many former Observations , that the biggest Spring-Tydes , and Annual Tides there , are about the AEquinoxes , according as the Moon is near the Full , or Change , before or after that time .
Of this you may expect a more perfect account hereafter .
