] In this paper , which is illustrated by three drawings , Sir Everard brings before the Society an account of some peculiarities in the skull and teeth of different species of Seals , in order to prevent mistakes being made when fossil remains of that animal are met with .
The first dPawing is of the skull of the large seal , from the South Seas ; the second , from a seal shot near the Orkneys ; and the third , from a seal 's skulll in the Museum of the College of Surgeons , from New Georgia , near the ice towards the South Pole .
In all these the teeth differ in form , which the author suggests may arise from the shell fish on which they live being of different kinds .
