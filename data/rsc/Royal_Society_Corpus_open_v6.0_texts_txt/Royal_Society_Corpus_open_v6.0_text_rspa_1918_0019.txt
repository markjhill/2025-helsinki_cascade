Flocculation .
By Spencer Umfreville Pickering , M.A. , F.R.S. ( Received December 8 , 1917 .
) The breaking down of clay soils by frost is largely due to the mechanical disruption of the clods , but a change also occurs in the ultimate particles , which , when agitated with water , are found to sink more rapidly than before .
This is due to the shrinking of the individual particles , and their agglomeration into clots .
Such a change is the reverse of that occurring in flocculation produced by the addition of acids , etc. , where , as will be shown , there is an increase in the size of the individual particles .
All bulky , hydrated precipitates appear to behave as clay does on freezing .
The three basic copper sulphates examined were obtained by adding lime-water to copper sulphate ; * the copper hydroxide , by adding copper sulphate in the calculated proportion of lime-water ; the ferric hydroxide , from the chloride and ammonia ; all of these were used without separation from the liquids .
The alumina was precipitated and well washed , but not dried ; the clay was from the Oxford formation , it was puddled with water , and the turbid supernatant liquid decanted after 10 minutes ' settlement from the coarser particles ; the kaolin was similarly treated .
In each case 100 c.c. of these liquids were kept frozen for two hours at \#151 ; 18 ' , and , on melting , transferred to graduated cylinders , side by side with unfrozen specimens .
Readings of the volumes of the sediment were taken daily till the relative volumes of any pair became practically constant ; this occurred after two or three days .
The values are entered in Table I. Thus , considerable shrinkage , varying from 40 to 90*3 per cent. , has occurred in all these cases.f This appears to be due to dehydration .
Taking advantage of the fact that the sulphate 10CuO , SO3 ( which contains also the elements of CaS04 , or of ]STa2SC\gt ; 4 if excess of sodium ' sulphate is present ) , emulsifies paraffin oil , its state of hydration when freshly precipitated was determined , J and found to be 42H20 .
A similar determination with the * 4 Journ. Chem. Soc. , J 1907 , p. 1988 .
f Exceptional behaviour was observed with a third preparation of alumina : it had proved very difficult to wash , and still retained 0*09 per cent. Cl after several months ; this jelly , which contained 3*32 per cent. A1203 , on being frozen , became a limpid , almost quite clear , liquid , leaving only 4 per cent , of the total alumina present on the filter paper after filtration ; yet the rest of the alumina was but in a state of suspension , being separable on filtration through a very fine porous candle .

Further evidence as to dehydration was afforded by the fact that the sediment from 100 c.c. of the unfrozen clay suspension B , when dried over sulphuric acid and re-suspended in water , gave a sediment with a relative volume of 21*5 , or practically the same as that after freezing .
Partial drying by mere exposure to air resulted in no shrinkage of the sediment .
Dehydration by freezing affords an instance of a chemical combination feebler than that uniting similar molecules in a crystal.* It is not a temperature effect , for these sediments when kept at 0 ' for several days undergo no shrinkage ; nor does shrinkage occur when there is insufficient water present to allow of crystallisation , as when air-dried clay is cooled to \#151 ; 18 ' .
The contraction consequent on dehydration is increased , at any rate in the case of clay , by the particles becoming aggregated into clots .
With clay , where , unlike the other substances examined , the particles are of very different magnitudes , freezing reduces the amount of finer particles left in suspension in nearly the same ratio as it reduces the volume of the coarser particles in the sediment .

Re-hydration of frozen clay must occur somehow in the held , but by what agency is not apparent ; neither frozen clay nor any of the precipitates examined show any increase in bulk on being left in water for months , nory .
in the case of clay , does any of the treatments specified in the last eight entries in Table I produce any appreciable effect , except re-puddling , and there the effect is a limited one , probably resulting merely from the breaking up of the clots , not from their re-hydration .
Equally ineffective was repeated air-drying and moistening of the sediment during several weeks ; and mixture with some garden soil during such treatment produced no change .
The elements of CaS04 ( or Na2S04 ) are united with the basic sulphate , 10CuO , SO3 , in the same loose way as that in which water is , and may be removed by washing , or even by dilution of the liquid ; yet their presence modifies considerably the physical and chemical properties of the substance .
When heated at 100 ' in the liquid from which it has been precipitated ( which is a saturated solution of calcium sulphate ) , the basic sulphate gradually becomes grey , * but retains its bulkiness for a long time ; if , however , the calcium sulphate is entirely or partially removed , decomposition is very rapid and complete , and nothing but a compact deposit of black copper oxide remains .
In numerous series of experiments the effect of various substances on the stability of the basic sulphate has been investigated ; amongst inorganic salts , magnesium sulphate , when present in large proportion , is the most effective in imparting stability , whilst some organic substances , such as starch , and especially dextrin , are still more effective .
With the latter , the maximum stability is attained when the proportions C5H10O5 : 4Cu is reached , the compound resisting decomposition during about two hours ' heating at 100 ' , though it becomes less bulky than in the absence of dextrin .
Smaller proportions of dextrin , though they have a delaying effect on the decomposition , render it complete when it does occur , the product then consisting of the black compact oxide .
The point at which this decomposition is at a maximum indicates the existence of another compound with , approximately , C6Hi0O5 :10 Cu .
In all cases the combination of the basic sulphates with these substances is reversible ; the substances can be removed by washing , and replaced by adding them again to the liquids .
These facts have an important bearing on the flocculation of clay , etc. , by acids or salts .
As regards flocculation , a significant fact seems to have been overlooked by previous workers ; namely , that it is accompanied by a large increase in the volume occupied by the particles , as evidenced by the volume of the deposit eventually obtained on subsidence .

Kaolin was taken for the present investigation .
Samples of this vary greatly in their powers of suspension ; that selected was a " purified , " but not acid-washed , specimen ; it was ground with twice its weight of water , rendered slightly alkaline with ammonia , * and boiled vigorously in platinum for 30 minutes ; after 24 hours , the upper two-thirds were syphoned off for use .
This contained 20 per cent , of solid , after ignition .
In the determinations , 10 c.c. were transferred to a graduated cylinder containing well boiled water , the flocculating solution added , and the whole made up to 100 c.c. Each series consisted of about ten determinations with the proportion of flocculant increasing ( generally ) tenfold at each step .
The cylinders were left at 22 ' for 48 hours , when the volumes of the sediment were finally read , and the upper 75 c.c. of the supernatant liquid syphoned off for the determination of the matter natant in it .
Judging by the appearance of the liquids , flocculation is not quite complete till ( generally ) one stage beyond that at which the suspended matter is too small for determination .
The liquids which were quite clear are marked by asterisks in Table II ; an increase in the amount of flocculant beyond this point in every case induces a very slight turbidity .
The concentrations ( equivalents per litre ) at which flocculation is complete are approximately:\#151 ; 0-0003 N to 0-001N ... ... . .

The volumes of the sediments are represented by the continuous lines , and the matter in suspension by the discontinuous ones , the latter on a scale much more open than the former , so as to render the relationship between the two apparent .
The volume occupied by the whole of the solid particles is the property which ought to be represented , but this cannot be determined , and it is not even possible to separate the suspension completely from the sediment ; but , even in extreme cases , the suspended matter can amount to only about * It would have been preferable to flocculate it previously by carbon dioxide ; this would have admitted of its being washed .
t The equivalent of carbonic acid has been taken as H2C03 because only one of the atoms of hydrogen exists as acid hydroxyl ( ' Proc. Roy .

6 per cent , of the total solid present , and a correction for this , in order to convert the observed sediment volumes into volumes occupied by the total solid , would amount to 0-25 c.c. at most , an almost negligible quantity , especially when the difficulty of reading the volumes of 3 or 4 c.c. at the bottom of a 100-c.c .
cylinder is considered .
It is evident that , as regards acids and salts , the increase in the sediment-volumes forms an exact counterpart to the decrease of matter in suspension , the latter becoming nil when the former attains a maximum ; where , as in the case of cane sugar ( fig. 2 ) , there is no flocculation , there is also no increase in the volume of the sediment .
Both phenomena must be attributed to the same cause , and this , apparently , is the combination of the flocculant with the kaolin .
An investigation of such combination was possible in the case of acids and alkalis , but only over a limited range ; the results were:\#151 ; Concentration .

The results with soda , which will be discussed later , are confirmatory in proving combination to occur up to the point of flocculation , but , owing to the strength of the solutions concerned , they cannot be extended so as to prove that it becomes complete at this point ( 0-1 to l'ON ) .
Hall and Morrison* show that the electrical theories of flocculation put forward by Whetham and by Joly cannot be accepted , and , whilst advancing no explanation themselves , reject the idea of combination a3 a cause , on the ground ( pp. 250 , 254 ) that the action is reversible , and that their own conductivity determinations showed that no appreciable fraction of the flocculant * ' Jonrn .

was removed from the liquid .
That reversibility disproves combination cannot be maintained ( cf. p. 317 ) , and , in all the four cases examined by them , a reduction of conductivity was observed , which , moreover , indicated combination of the same order of magnitude as that given by the present direct determinations , namely , 100 molecules of kaolin* to 0'2BaCl2 ( or 04 equivalent ) , and to 0*1 A12(S04)3 ( or 0 6 equivalent ) .
With natrolite the proportions of salt were two or three times as great .
The present determinations show a combination of 100 Al203,2Si02 with 028 H2S04 ( 0-56 equivalent ) , with 0 46 HC1 , and with 2'2 NaOH .
On flocculation , the Brownian motion of the particles ceases , and , as this motion is but a consequence of the smallness of the particles , flocculation must increase their size .
No swelling of the particles can be observed under the microscope , hence the increase in size must be due to their combination with invisible liquid matter ; a layer of liquid round a solid particle would act as a buffer against molecular bombardment , and hence arrest Brownian motion .
The increased size of the particles is shown by the increased volume occupied by them on subsidence , but this increase is about 200 per cent , in the case of the acids , and 100 per cent , in the other cases , f and could not result from the union of such small proportions of the solute with the kaolin ; the solute , however , whatever views be taken as to its condition , is certainly united with a large proportion of water , amounting in dilute solutions to several hundred H20 , as the author 's former examination of various properties of solutions shows , and the union of such complex hydrates with the kaolin would quite account for the magnitude of the increase in volume observed .
The spheres formed by the solid particles surrounded by liquid molecules would exhibit some surface tension towards the medium ; and , as in the case ot an imperfect emulsion , these spheres would tend to coalesce into irregular masses , with the solid particles congregated towards the centre .
Hence the appearance of an attraction between the solid particles .
Alterations in the composition of the hydrates as the concentration of the * We have taken Hall and Morrison 's weights to refer to that of anhydrous kaolin ; the proportion of salt absorbed would be greater if they referred to hydrated kaolin .
t A strict comparison between the results with the different substances must not be made , as the various series could not be done at the same time .
Carbonic acid , it may be noticed , gives an increase as great as do the other acids , though larger proportions are required to effect it .
The absence of precautions to eliminate carbon dioxide must throw doubt on some of the previous work on flocculation .
It is owing to its action that samples of clay , taken from the same spot at different times , are found to vary greatly in suspensibility .

solutions are altered would produce alterations in the sediment volume curves .
The results with potassium sulphate show a want of regularity , possibly from this cause ; and with potassium nitrate there was a slight recrudescence of turbidity beyond the point at which flocculation had become complete .
The reaction of the flocculant with traces of impurity in the kaolin would account for the zero point not always being quite in harmony with the volumes for the weakest solutions .
It is clear that the changes suffered by the kaolin do not cease when flocculation is complete , for the volume of the sediment decreases , and subsequently increases , on further addition of the flocculant .
The decrease is attributable to the dehydrating action of the solute , partly on the hydrates present , partly on the kaolin itself .
That the latter is modified when the concentration of the solution is great , is evidenced by the fact that in every such case it assumes a grey tinge , and a coarse-grained appearance , this being accompanied by contraction of bulk , as is proved in the case of the otherwise inert cane sugar , where the sediment from a solution of N concentration , when allowed to settle completely , is found to occupy only 80 per cent , of that from water .
This dehydration , like that produced by freezing or other means ( p. 317 ) appears to be irreversible ; kaolin in a 0*000311 solution of sulphuric acid , on the one hand , and in a ION solution on the other , were taken , and the acid in both cases was entirely removed by withdrawing three-quarters of the supernatant liquid , and replacing it with water , every 24 hours for 16 days .
The sediment volumes had then both attained constancy , but there was a difference of 30 and 40 per cent , between them in the two series made.* The final increase in the volume of sediment must be attributed to a cause similar to that producing the first increase , namely , the combination of the solute with the kaolin ; but in this case it will be with the partially dehydrated kaolin , and the solute will be present as hydrates of very different constitution from those in dilute solutions .
The slight turbidity noticeable in these liquids is due to their increased viscidity , as is shown in the case of sugar , where there is a continuous increase in turbidity from 0*001 N solutions onwards , till , in a 1*55 N solution , as much as 61 per cent , of the kaolin remains suspended in the upper 75 c.c. after 48 hours .
The results with alkalis show that they produce flocculation , just as do acids and salts , but not till the proportions present are a hundred to a thousand times greater .
The consequence of this is that the attainment of * The volumes represent those of the carbonic acid compounds of the kaolin , for the water used must not be freed from carbon dioxide , otherwise many weeks would have to be allowed for the settlement of the kaolin after each dilution .
* Mr. S. U. Pickering .

the maximum sediment-volume at the flocculation point is not always evident , owing to the overlapping of it and the subsequent changes\#151 ; dehydration and the combination of the dehydrated kaolin .
This is so with potassium carbonate , partially so with soda , but not with potash , in the last of which cases , it will be noticed , no final rise occurs within the limits of possible experimentation .
The alkalis , however , present one feature absent in the case of acids or salts , namely , that the decrease in the amount of matter in suspension is preceded by an increase , forming a hump in the curves } but this cannot be due to a reversal of flocculation , for there is no corresponding depression in the sediment-volumes .
It is explained by the fact that combination with alkalis requires the presence of these in excess , as the determinations quoted on p. 322 show ; in a 0'0003 N solution , for instance , no measurable amount of combination occurs , yet there must be attraction between the kaolin and the alkali , for they combine when the proportions are altered , and this attraction must result in the kaolin subsiding less rapidly than in pure water ; hence the rise in the curve , followed by a fall as the amount of combination becomes appreciable .
A true reversal of flocculation would , however , be produced by alkalis in the case of clay flocculated by carbonic acid , as when a clay soil is dressed with lime .
