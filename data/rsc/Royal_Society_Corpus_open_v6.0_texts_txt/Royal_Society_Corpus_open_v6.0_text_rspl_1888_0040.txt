Chemical Energy of Electrolytes [ June 14 By regularly increasing the strength , of the solution , the electromotive force at first increased very rapidly , then with decreasing rapidity , and finally remained uniform .
The total increase was 0'38 volt .
The smallest proportion of bromine required to upset the balance lay between 1 in 77,500,000 and 84,545,000 parts of water .
With each of these substances , and with all others which I have examined , a gradual and regular increase of strength of the solution from the weakest up to a saturated one , was attended by a more or less irregular change of electromotive force .
By plotting the quantities of dissolved substance as ordinates to the electromotive forces as abscissas , each substance or mixture of substances in every case yielded a different curve of variation of electromotive force by uniformly changing the strength of its solution .
With a given voltaic couple at a given temperature , the curve was constant and characteristic of the substance .
As the least addition of a soluble foreign substance greatly changed the " minimum-point , " and altered the curve of variation of potential , both the curve and the minimum proportion of a substance required to upset the voltaic balance may probably be used as tests of the chemical composition of the substance , and as means of examining its state of combination when dissolved .
By varying the strength of the solution at each of the metals separately , a curve of change of potential was obtained for each positive metal , but not for every negative one .

" Influence of the Chemical Energy of Electrolytes upon the 'Minimum Point ' and Change of Potential of a Voltaic Couple in Water , " By G. Gore , F.R.S. Received June 7 , 1888 .
In a communication to the Royal Society , May 3rd , 1888 , on TS\#174 ; Effect of Chlorine upon the Electromotive Force of a Voltaa Couple , " and in a subsequent one on " The Minimum P0^ Jr Change of Potential of a Voltaic Couple , " I have shown thatj ] opposing to each other two currents of equal electromotive force fr0p two perfectly similar couples of magnesium-platinum or z#* platinum in distilled water , and gradually adding to one of the cells sufficiently minute quantities of a suitable substance , sue .* chlorine , hydrochloric acid , or a soluble salt , \amp ; c. , the voltaic ba is not disturbed until a certain definite proportion of the substance has been added , and that the proportion required to be added is excessively small ( about 1 in 17,000 millions ) in the case of chlorine L888 .

In the present paper my object is to describe a few similar experiments , made to examine the influence of liquids of different chemical jomposition , upon this phenomenon and upon the degrees of electromotive force produced by further additions of the substances .
All jhe solutions were made with distilled water , and the substances smployed were of considerable degree of purity .
The voltaic cell consisted in each case of zinc and platinum in distilled water , and its electromotive force was balanced by that of a suitable thermo-electric eile ( see ' Proceedings of the Birmingham Philosophical Society , ' 70I .
4 , p. 130 ) , and the measurements made under that condition .
The electromotive force of a zinc-platinum couple in ordinary listilled water at 16 ' C. is about 1'088 volt ; provided , the zinc is free from oxide , and the platinum contains no absorbed hydrogen .
The presence of hydrogen ( not removable by rubbing but removable by beating to redness ) may reduce the electromotive force to 0'91 volt , 1 ind a film of oxide upon the zinc may reduce it 1 or 2 per cent. , whilst carbonic acid absorbed by the water from the air , \amp ; c. , may increase it about 2 per cent. In all cases , therefore , where very 3 exact measurements of electromotive force are necessary , these cir-eumstances have to be considered .
In the present case the measurements are .e sufficiently accurate for the purposes intended .
A series of measurements were made with a zinc-platinum couple in water , adding uniform quantities of hydrochloric acid up to \gt ; 15 grain per 465 grains of water , and heating the platinum to redness previous to each measurement .
The variations of electromotive force obtained were nearly the same as when the platinum was aot heated , the only material difference being that the electromotive rorce throughout was about 0*10 volt higher .
The following are the results of the experiments made upon the influence of the chemical energy of the liquid .
The numbers are eorrected for the influence of hydrogen absorbed by the platinum .

By comparing these numbers with those in Table IY , it will be perceived that each of the haloid salts acted much more powerfully than either of the oxygen ones , and that the order of degrees of activity in the two series was reverse .
( Suspecting a decomposition of the chloride solution by the couple , I divided a solution of 8 grains of the salt per ounce of water into two equal portions in two glass vessels , then immersed a piece of zinc wire in one portion , and a second piece of the same wire in contact with a piece of platinum in the other , and set the vessels aside .

The minimum proportion of chlorine necessary to upset the balance was found more nearly by adding very small quantities of an exceedingly dilute solution of it to the water until the required strength was attained , thus avoiding the risk of error attending more numerous dilutions .
The proportion lay between 1 in 1264 million and 1300 million parts of water .
The variation of electromotive force by uniform increase of the strength of the solution was irregular .
8 * The following are the minimum proportions of iodine , bromine , and chlorine , arranged for comparison :\#151 ; Prof. J. C. Ewart .

, , 84,545,000 Chlorine " 1 " 1264,000,000 " 1300,000,000 This series of numbers suggests a quantitative relation of the " minimum proportions " to the atomic and molecular weights of the substances .
On comparing these numbers with those of the two previous groups of bodies , we find that the proportion of substance required to upset the voltaic balance was largest with the oxygen salts , intermediate with the haloid ones , and least with the free elementary-bodies .
It was smaller the greater the degree of chemical energy of the substance ; thus it was about 400 times less with chlorine than with iodine .
And it was smaller the greater the degree of freedom to exert that energy ; thus it was about 5,416,000 times smaller with free chlorine than with potassic chlorate , or 1,570,000 times less than with the combined chlorine of the chlorate ; and about 185 times smaller than with potassic chloride , or 88 times less than with the combined chlorine of that salt .
At the lowest potentials , the rate of increase of electromotive force per grain of substance is usually larger the smaller the proportion of substance necessary to disturb the potential .
Iodine is an exception to this , but probably only an apparent one , because on substituting magnesium for the zinc , the addition of iodine caused an increase of potential as usual .
; j -jB The curve of variation of potential was different with the solution of each substance , and was apparently characteristic of the body m each case ; and a great number of such representative curves might be obtained by change of strength of solution , in nearly all electrolytes , with a zinc-platinum or other voltaic couple .
