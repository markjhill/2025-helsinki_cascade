( Abstract .
) The paper is in three parts .
The first , by Sir Norman Lockyer , gives an account of the arrangements made for the observations and the general conditions of the eclipse ; but the results obtained with the 248 Mr. A. E. Tutton .
CrStudy of prismatic cameras are not included , for the reason that the reduction of the photographs is not yet completed .
The second part , by Captain Chisholm-Batten , R.N. , gives a full account of the observations made by the officers and men of H.M.S. " Melpomene four photographs of the corona , taken with different exposures , accompany the paper .
In the third part , Professor Peddler gives details of the spectroscopic observations which he made by eye with a 6-inch short focus lens and a grating spectroscope .
A general idea of the work at Yiziadrug has already been given in a preliminary report.* " A Comparative Crystallographical Study of the Double Selenates of the Series R3M(Se04)2,6H20.\#151 ; Part I. Salts in which M is Zinc .

( Abstract .
) In this communication are presented the results of the investigation of the group of salts of the above series in which M is represented by zinc , R being represented by potassium , rubidium , and caesium .
The investigation is similar to that which has previously been carried out for the double sulphates of the analogous series . !
The work consists of very large numbers of measurements of the exterior angles of the crystals , determinations of density , refractive index , optic axial angle , orientation of optical ellipsoid , and effect of change of temperature on the optical properties , together with the calculation of all the morphological and physical constants derivable from the measurements .
The main results are as follows:\#151 ; The morphological axial angle of the rubidium zinc salt is approximately the mean of the axial angles of potassium zinc and caesium zinc selenate .
In the cases of thirty-three out of thirty-six angles between the exterior faces , the value for the rubidium zinc salt is intermediate between the values for the other two salts , and the exceptions are only apparent , being due to changes of opposite sign in adjacent angles following the rule .
The morphological axial ratios for rubidium zinc selenate are intermediate between the ratios of potassium zinc and caesium zinc selenate .
The common habit of the crystals of the rubidium zinc salt is of an * ' Roy .
