] T'ie Optical Properties of Vitreous Silica .
201 When extracting data from the earlier of the two papers by Mr. Ellis* dready mentioned , I found that he had there advanced evidence\#151 ; though he seems hardly to have considered it conclusive\#151 ; that the difference between the Greenwich declination and horizontal force ranges in years of many and few sunspots was not the same in different Reasons of the year .
Converted into exact mathematical language , this would imply the variability of b throughout the year .
If I had been aware at the time of Mr. Ellis 's remarks on this point I should have referred to them in my preliminary notef on this subject .
" The Optical Properties of Vitreous Silica .
" By J. W. Gifford and W. A. ShenSTONE , F.E.S. Beceived January 12 \#151 ; Bead March 3 , 1904 .
The properties of vitreous silica suggest that it is not unlikely to play an important part in optical work .
Its composition is definite , that is to say , it is not liable to those minute variations which make it impossible , we believe , to produce with certainty two meltings of glass which exhibit no sensible difference in their optical properties when tested by a first-rate spectrometer .
Hardly any corrosive fumes , except those of fluorine and hydrogen fluoride , attack silica , and it is indifferent to most ordinary solvents .
It is as transparent to ultraviolet radiations as quartz , but is not doubly refracting like that substance .
And though it is a little difficult to prepare vitreous silica in large masses , this difficulty can be surmounted , and the supply of the substance is not limited like that of fluorite .
In shoit , vitreous silica places at our disposal a really standard glass .
The refractive index of the new glass is low , it approaches that of fluoiite .
Its dispersive power is sensibly greater than that of quartz .
The measurements given in this paper were made with a prism having faces 41 mm. high by 32 mm. wide , and angles of 60 approximately .
The mass of silica from which this prism was cut was made under the supervision of one of us in conjunction with .
Mr. H. G. Lacell , to whom our thanks are due .
As it was our object to produce a standard substance for optical work , no care was spared at this stage .
In making the mass of silica the spectroscopic traces of lithium and the traces of sodium which occur in quartz were burnt out as completely as possible in the oxy-gas flame .
The prism itself was built up from many hundreds of fine rods of vitreous silica , prepared specially for this purpose by a process which has been * ' Phil. Trans. , 'for 1880 .

[ Jan. 12 described previously.* These rods were applied when softened by-heat to one end of a thicker rod of silica and gradually melted into the larger mass , the larger mass itself being maintained in a semi-molten state during the operation about the part where the addition was made by means of a powerful combination of four " mixed gas " oxy-gas flames .
The process occupied many days , and in order to secure uniformity in the finished block , the whole was heated throughout after every interval in the process as thoroughly as possible before further additions were made .
During the whole process the greatest care was taken to preserve the silica from dust and even from contact with the workman 's hand .
The complete absence of particles of foreign matter is of great importance , since they would be apt to cause the silica to devitrify during annealing .
The large mass of silica thus prepared was found to be not quite homogeneous when the prism cut from it was examined in the spectrometer .
Therefore , it was afterwards securely sealed up in a case !
made of thick platinum foil to protect it from dust , and heated in an oxy"hydrogen furnace till pieces of platinum wire placed near it in the furnace began to melt .
To allow time for the heat to penetrate the silica , which is not a good conductor , the process was prolonged so that the silica Avas kept at a temperature not far helo\Ar the maximum for several hours .
It was then gradually cooled down by slowly reducing the flame of the furnace during 5 or 6 hours , and finally left to fall to the ordinary temperature after all the openings of the furnace had been closed .
As it did not seem safe to assume that one prism of silica so prepared Avould be identical in its optical properties with another , a second prism was constructed in quite a different \vay .
This second prism was a compound prism .
It consisted of four flat prisms cemented together one aboAre the other .
This compound prism had angles of approximately 60 ' , and its faces Avere 56 mm. high by 38 mm. wide ( see fig. below ) .
It was made from four slabs of silica prepared by Messrs. Baird and Tatlock .
The workman , a trustworthy man , was told that each slab must be reheated till plastic throughout after it was built up .
He Avorked without any supervision from us , and the results show that a uniform material may be obtained from silica without any difficulty and without any other precautions than those which a careful workman may be trusted to take .
The four slabs of silica were rough ground into four prisms , cemented together , and a single prism was cut from the mass and finished by Mr. Hilger .
When the compound silica prism Avas tested in the spectrometer , we found that its performance generally was not to be distinguished from that of the simple prism used for the measurements giAren in the table , * 'Nature/ toL 62 , p. 20 , and yoI .

But ; we think not , for we found on a trial that a compound prism of \#166 ; * ... ... .36mm.- ... ..\#151 ; \#187 ; Compound Silica Prism , actual size .
Schott 's borosilicate flint ( No. 0-364 ) , made from four pieces of glass taken from different parts of the , gave a much less satisfactory spectrum than the compound prism made from jour separate meltings of silica .
When the two prisms were compared m the spectrometer , the Dline given by the glass prism presented itsell as a bundle of six lines* whilst that given by the silica prism was normal , the D line being sensibly divided .
Measurements of Refractive Index .
Measurements of the refractive indices have been made with the same goniometer , by the same method , and for the same wave eng s. as those previously given in the case of fluorite , quartz and ca ci e , t and the same tests have been applied .
_ " , Errors due to the Method.\#151 ; No one of the angles of the pi isms 1 ere from 60 ' by as much as 1 ' of arc , and the error is therefore in the tenth place of decimals .
