IN treatises on hydrodynamics , the flow of a liquid through a straight tube is investigated on the supposition that there may be finite slipping between the walIs of the tube the outermost layer of liquid .
This leads to the introduction of a " " slipping coefficient\ldquo ; which vanishes when there is no relative motion between them .
Let denote the radius of the tube , the pressure at one end , , , , , the other , the coefficient of viscosity , the length of the tube , the density of the liquid .
Then it may be show1 ] ( LAMB'S ' Hydrodynamics , p. 222 ) that when the motion is linear the flux is given by or where may be defined as the slipping coefficient .
The experiments of showed that the coefficient was certainly zero for glass tubes , but there was doubt whether this held for all materials .
HELMHOLTZ and PIOTROWSKI attacked the problem in another way .
They suspended bifilarly an accurately worked sphere , whose inner surface was gilded and ished , and by observing the time of swing and the Iogarithmic decrement when the sphere was filled with water and various other liquids , deduced a value for the * Memoires des Savants Etrangers , ' 1846 .

90 coefficient of viscosity and for the slipping coefficient , from the theory of spheres in a viscous medium , as worked out by and For distilled water their of the ctor the above expression is mm. If we apply this to the case of a tube we get a somewhat startling result .
From equation it foJlows that the of slip varies inversely as the radius of the tube .
The smallest tube practicable in the experiments to be presently described had a diameter of about a llillimetre .
It is easy to show that the result of the existence of a slipping coefficient of the magnitude given by HELMHOLTZ ] be to produce an increase in the volume ofliquid flowing through the tube in a given time , which could not only be detected , but would be of such importance that it could not easily be masked .
In HELMHOLTZ'S notation equation is written the density of water being taken as unity .
Putting and , we get ; whereas if there is no slip , so that vanishes , the flux becomes If we take HELMHOLTZ'S coefficient to be correct , the flow through a polished gilt tube of a millimetre in diameter is nearly twenfy times as fast as hrough a glass tube of the same size .
HELMHOLTZ refers to some experiments made by GIRARD with copper which make the flow some four times faster than do POISEUILLE'S formulae .
I shall return to the consideration of these observations later .
The value of which HELMHOLTZ deduces from them is mm. The discrepancy between these results and the generaily received opinion that no slip occurred with any material seemed worthy of further investigation .
It is evident that the alleged coefficient could be investigated with much greater advantage by observing the flow of liquid through a small tube than by any experiments on oscillating spheres .
In order to avoid all absolute determinations while searching for the existence of such a slip , I decided to observe the time of flow of a * ' Memoires de l'Institut , ' 1813-1815 .

given volume of water through a glass tube , and then to deposit a coating of silver on the interior surface of the tube .
If the time of flew was the same before , allowing for the ( usually very small ) change in diameter , it would be evidence against the existence of the effect .
Such evidence I have most satisfactorily obtained .
Since the experiments were to be merely comparative there was no object in attempting to keep the pressure constant throughout each observation , and the simplest apparatus could be used .
The bulb tube AB was fixed in a large glass jar filled with water , and opening below into a wide tube , also filled with water .
The lower end of the bulb tube was attached to the capillary tube by an india-rubberjoint , so that the ends of the two glass tubes should just meet .
The top of the bulb tube could be put into connexion either with the air outside , or with an exhausted bottle which was used to fill the bulbs , as the apparatus was some distance from a pump .
The temperature of the water in the glass jar and wide tube could be read off by a delicate thermometer .
The time taken by the upper surface of the water to fall from A to was observed by a stop watch .
Before silvering the tube the whole apparatus was repeatedly taken to pieces and set up again , and the time of flow shown to be unaltered .
The silvering solution was a modification of LTEBIG'S , and wits made to recipe kindly given me by Dr. A. S. LEA .
Each tube was dried and weighed , and the solution then run till a bright metallic mirror was deposited .
lt was washed out with a current of water , then with air , and finally dried and weighed .
The rease gave the of silver .
At the end of the experiments with the tnbe thus silyered , it was dried and weighed , and the silver dissolved off with nitric acid .
The mean of these } results , which usually agreed to one or two tenths of a milligram , was taken to represent the weight of silver ring to the tube during the experiments .
Assuming the deposit to be uniform , this at once gave the change in diameter .
The correction for temperature was calculated by POISEUILLE'S formula .
The firsb tube had a of cms .

The silver was then off , and the tube cleaned and dried .
Weight The weight of silver ited is , therefore , , and its thickness 000014 cm .
This gives a chance in equivalent to per cent. The time of flow for the unsilvered tube , corrected for change of radius , is 7 ' , while the observed time for the silvered tube is 7 ' .
The rence of about per cent. is probably due to irregularities in the thickness of the silver layer .
Two objections may be raised to this experiment .
The first is that with such a thin film , the action between the water and the glass might still.be effective , and prevent an slipping .
When we remember , however , that the sphere of action of molecular forces is only about cm .
, we see that no direct action can occur across a distance of cm .
, and it is exceedingly unlikely that a layer of silver more thaJl 1000 molecules thick , should be pervious to water , and thus allow of contact with the glass .
In order , however , to entirely meet this objection , experiments were made with considerably thicker layers .
The second objection is f , hat the silver might be deposited so arly that the choking effect might mask the quickening due to slip .
It had been found , in a series ofpreliminary experiments , that ifa tube used ose diameter was much less than a millimetre , it was exceedingly difficult to get a uniform silver deposit , and the time of flow for the silvered tube was always much greater than for the unsilvered .
To prevent this the tube had to be silvered in a vertical position , and various details , only to be learnt by experience , ttended to .
The time of flow for silvered tube could , owever , never be brought below that for the plain one , as greater care was taken in the vering it continually approximated to it , this is conclusive against the existence of an effect at all comparable with that given by HELMHOLTZ for polished gold , or with that which he deduced from GIRARD'S experiments on copper tubes .
As the choking effect was naturally greater for small tubes , a series of nents was ncxt made on some of rather greater diameter .

The , lver was very thin , the change in being per cent. Thus , as the result of four series of observations with three different tubes , we have that the difference in the times of flow for the silvered and unsilvered tubes is never greater than per cent. With both the first and second tubes , and in one series of observations with the third tube , the time of flow is slightly greater ( by , and per cent. ) for the silver surface , while in one case\mdash ; the first series of observations with the third tube\mdash ; the time is slightly less ( by per These differences are all within the limits of experimental error , found by comparing the times of flow for the same tube in the same state on different occasions .
On the whole there is some evidence that the time is a little greater for the silvered surface , as would , of course , be the case if the ] ) osit not quite strictly uniform .
In the one case , when the time was less , the temperature difference was largest , and errors likely to be most important .
These experiments may at any rate be considered conclusive against the existence of the large effect , for the existence of which I was searching .
A new series of observations was then undertaken to determine whether any slipping occurred in a silvered tube when the velocity of the water was greater than before , and the gradient of velocity was pushed near the limit beyond which the motion ceased to be linear .
This limit was calculated for each tube by means of a formula given by Professor OSBORNE REYNOLDS , who found by experiment that in order to insure linear motion , must be where is the diameter of the tube , the coefficient of viscosity , the density , and * Phi ] .

C. D. WHETHAM ON THE SLIPPING the velocity of water calculated from the quantity which flows through in a given time .
It was advantageous to use as small a tube as possible .
for two reasons : rstly , because any slipping is inyersely proportional to the radius , and secondly , the gradient of velocity can be pu head farther without exceeding the limits of linear motion , the smaller the tube .
A tube , whose diameter was 084 cm .
, and whose length was , was therefore taken , as it was the smallest which could conveniently be silvered , and the eatest allowable pressure culated .
From the relation above , we find that the pressure must not exceed .

After many preliminary trials an was set up , which gave most excellent results .

The bulb had a capacity of about 850 , and was fixed to a wooden frame to prevent kage ; this was screwed to the edge of table .
The water was eventually abolished , and the temperature of the water read off at intervals during each experiment as it passed through a broad tube , into which the capillary tube opened .
The temperature of the water was thus read off immediately after it had passed the important place , and by taking readings at equal intervals while the bulb was emptying , a very accurate estimation of the temperature could be obtained .
Below the temperature tube was a three-necked WOLFF'S bottle ; the second neck was connected to a large carboy , and the third could be put into communication with the atmosphere .
The carboy was connected to a three-way tube , the branches of which went , one to the WOLFF'S bottle , one to an air pump worked by the water supply , and one to the gauges and M. gauge contained sulphuric acid , and contained mercury .
The latter was only used for the experiments in which higher pressures were employed .
* The bulb was filled by disconnecting the joint , and putting the lower orifice of the temperature tube in communication with , the tube joining and being stopped .
was then put to the pump , and the water in sucked up .
When the bulb was filled , was again connected , the carboy exhausted by putting to the pump , and the tube from tu opened .
The pump was worked till the requisite pressure , as shown by the gauge , was reached .
The apparatus was then left till the rature had become constant after the disturbances produced by exhausting , and the of the gauge read off by a kathetometer .
The pressure could be adjusted to within a millimetre or less by regulating the pumps , and small differences in corresponding experiments , were given by the readings of the kathetonleter .
The correction to be applied to the times of flow for a given small difference of pressure , was determined by observing the ctual times of flow for pressures whose difference was considerably greater than that in the experiments to be , and keeping all other things unchanged .
The small pressure correction could then be accurately estimated from the result of this auxiliary experiment .
As before , the experiments were to be only comparative , and the pressure was allowed to fall during each observation .
Any change introduced by this would affect the tube equally whether plain or silvered .
In order to show the method of working and the degree of aCCUl.acy obtained , a complete account of an experiment is given in detail .

Thus the result of four series of experiments at these large differences of pressure is that in three cases the time for the silvered tube comes out slightly greater [ by , and per cent and in one case slightly less [ by per cent This agreement may be considered a quite satisfactory proof of identity .
In support of his view that there is a finite coefficient HELMHOLTZ refers to some experiments of GIRARD , examined the time of flow of water through copper tubes , found that the motion was linear within limits which agree irly well with those given by REYNO 1 ' formula , but got times of flow much than those observed by POISEUILLE glass tubes .
Tbus with a tube whose diameter was mm. and length 1790 mm. , a quarter of a litre of water flowed through in secs .
under a sure of 100 mm. of water and at a temperature of , while POISEUILLE'S formula gives 2949 secs .
As I could detect no error in GIRARD'S account of his experiments I determined to repeat them .
Messrs. ELLIOTT , of Sellyoak , Birmingham , most kindly undertook to manufacture some solid drawn copper tubes of the dimensions required , and t , hey were entirely successful .
The apparatus employed was essentially the same as that used by GlRABD , and was of the simplest possible .
The results depended on the value obtained for the diameters of he tubes , as determined by when empty and when full of water , and as no allowance could be made for ularities or nonuniformities in the bore , calibration being impossible , it was useless to determine the time of flow or the temperature to any great of accuracy .
A glass jar was in the manner shown in the , and the difference of level between the surface of the water in A and the orifice determined by a kathetometer to a tenth of a millimetre .
Below was placed a 100 .
flask , and the time taken to fill this was observed with a stop watch to an accuracy of about 1 sec. in 400 or The temperature was obsorved in the jar A and also in , and the two seldom differed by more than a tenth of a degree .
In GIRARD'S investigations the level of the water in A was allowed to fall during each experiment , and its mean value sume to represent the effective driving pressure throughout .
In order to detersuch an arrangement was allowable for these small pressures , where the change a large fi.action of the whole , a comparison was made with a series of * ' Memoires de bitut , AT THE BOLNDARY A LIQUID IN MOTION .

In the experiments with the same tube described above , when the surface was copper , the following results were obtained at similar pressures:\mdash ; Thus in none of these experiments does the value of differ much from that given by POISEUILLE for glass tubes , but , like his , agrees with the formula deduced from the supposition that no slip occurs .
In all cases it is slightly greater , which is readily explained by irregularities iu the tubes , owing to the difficulty of drawing them .
According to GIRARD'S results , the value of should have about a quarter of the value given by UILLE , but in none of the experiments described this paper did it fall below POISEUILLE'S value , and more decisive still , no change in the nature of the surface changed the rate of flow ; this is purely a comparative method , and seems much more reliable than the absolute method of GIRARD , which depends on accurate measurements of the radii of the tubes , differences in pressure , \amp ; c. GIRARD only used tubes of two sizes , and gives no account of the means he employed to estimate their radii .
At the same time it should be noticed that his values for the two sizes agree fairly between themselves with the supposition that a ] ipping coefficient exists , whose value is about mm. Any constant error in the estimation of the radius , would however be naturally of greater importance in the smaller tube , and may have led to the apparent agreement with the results of an effect , inversely proportional to the radius , and due to the existence of a finite slipping coefficient .
We must now return to the consideration of the experiments of HELMHOLTZ and PIOTROWSKI .
The discussion of the body of their paper I must leave to those with the requisite knowledge , merely observing in passing that it is remarkable that the value they deduce for the coefiicient of viscosity of the liquid itself is considerably AT THE BOUNDARY OF A LIQUID MOTION .
greater ( by about one-fourth ) than that given by .
This seems to suggest that some slight modification in the application of the formulae may be necessary , which will reduce the value deduced for the viscosity of the liquid , and increase that for its adhesion to the vessel to the value requisite for the condition of no slip .
By a preliminary series of experiments PIOTROWSKI claims to have shown that the friction on a body oscillating in contact with a liquid depends on the nature of the surface .
He suspended a glass flask bifilarly , filled it with water , and observed the time of swing and the logarithmic decrement .
He then silvered the inner and repeated his observations .
The results are as follows:\mdash ; Time of swing .

As the result of these observations , PIOTROWSKI calculates that the ratio of the friction on to the friction on silver is as 1 Independently of the fact that no account is given of any precautions to keep the temperature constant , or even to measure it , it is evident that the above detel'mirlation is liable to errors due to changes in the suspension , which are very apt to occur , and that the agreement between the pairs of retidings is not very close .
However , in order to test whether such an effect were appreciable , I undertook a series of experiments with an apparatus similar to that used by PIOTROWSKI .
A glass bulb was blown as nearly as possible and the neck drawn off sideways into a fine tube .
It was filled with water by means of .
pump , and always kept completely full ; when left , a piece of india.rubber tubing filled with water was attached , so that if the perature of the room sank , water , and not was drawn in .
During working the rature was always slowly rising , and before .
W. C. D. THAM ON SLIPPING each observation the drop of water was removed by blotting paper .
At any given temperature the apparatus was therefore in a definite state , and this was obtained at much less expenditure of time and patience than il the bulb bad been always to a certain mark at a certain , or the same mass of water always put in by adjusting the weight .
A mirror to the bulb by sealing wax , and the whole suspended bifiIarly by a fine copper wire .
The logarithmic decrement had to be reduced by two brass balls at the end of a long bar magnet which was fixed to the bulb and by means of which the apparatus was set in oscillation .
A series of preliminary observations gave as the ratio of the frictions 1 : , an accuracy in the proof of identity which was not justified by the roughness cf the observations .
but which , at any rate , showed that the diffe ence could not be very great .

By HELMHOLTZ and PIOTROWSKI'S paper we see that the ratio of the friction on silver to the friction on glass is as : The change , if it exists at , is ccording to these experiments less than per cent. A modification of experiment was then tried .
Instead of filling the oscillating flask with water , it was filled with sand , and oscillated as a rigid body a large beaker of water .
The temperatul.e could then be observed , the investigation of the oscillations of a rigid body in a resisting medium , and acted on by a force proportional to the displacement , will hold .
Let denote the frictional to the the moment of inertia , the logarithmic decrenlent .
Then it is easily shown that where , being the force of restitution for unit displacement . . .

When the flask is silvered is unchanged , as the weight of silver much too small to ppreciably alter the bifilar couple , and , therefore , we get for the ratio of the frictions where and are the respective times of vibration .
A thick tinum wire was attached .
to the bulb , and the angemeot fixed to this above the surface of the At the conclusion of the experiments , the bulb filled with sand was oscillated in clnd the logarithmic decrement found to be a small aclion of observed when the bulb was in water .
This meets the objection that the chief MR. W. C. D. WHETHAM ON HE ALLEGED SLIPPING might be due to the suspension , and a small change in that part due to the water be Logarithmic decrement in air 00284 .

the observatlons marked ( 4 ) the bulb was suspended in the silvering solution about an hour , and then removed , It was then found that ) top with a black the ) ution on top of the silver , while the under hemisphere was silvered as usual .
Nevertheless a series of three determinations of the logarithmic decrement was taken .
The mean of these shows increase in both the logarithmic decl.ement and in the time of swing , even though lvas actually higher .
It was thought this be due bo the black sediment , which could not be removed alone ; so the whole deposit was olved off the bulb resilvered , the solution being kept stirled and frequently changed .
This time the deposit was bright and uniform .
The tions wever , identical with the last .
The only explanation of this ( unless we suppose that the friction is bout S per cent. greater for silver , instead of 4 per cent. less as PIOTROWSKI deduced ) is to suppose that a had in the suspension .
To tesb this , a series of observations ( 6 ) to ( 9 ) were taken with the silver on to get the temperature ection , and immediately after ( 9 ) the beaker of water removed from undel the bulb , onu of nitric acid of the ss , temperature put in its place without ' the suspension .
As soon as the silver was dissolved the bulb was washed , and the beaker of water replaced .
A series of observations ( 10 ) were at once taken with the glass surface .
Thus by comparing ( 9 ) with ( 10 ) we get a comparison of the friction on glass with the fi.iction on silver , free from all possible errors due to change of suspension , and at tempel'atures whose difference is only .
The means ( 9 ) Silvel.ed . .

The temperature correction for the logarithmic lment is by ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) for 1o C. or 00070 for the logarithmic decrement for the glass rected to 9 .
The ratio of the fi.ictions is : Thus the effect is , if it exists at all , less than per cen stead of 4 per cent. Another independent comparison call be series and ( 7 ) and the series marked ( 11 ) .
The means are-The atio of the ictions is , the change being less than per cent. eatei .

Thus the limits of experimelltal error the friction on silver is the same as the friction on glass , and this part of PIOTRO paper is certainly misleading .
It is evident that the oscillation method is much inferior to that in which the flow of water through tubes is observed .
The experiments described in the early part of this paper show that the difference in the time of flow for a glass and silver tube is less than cent. , in a case where the existence of a slipping coefficient of only one-half the magnitude of that deduced by HELMHOLTZ for gold , would make the time of flow for the silver tube about twelve times less than the time of flow for the glass tube .
The arguments sometimes used in favour of the contact theory of electromotive , based on the differences in friction of a liquid on different solid surfaces , must be admitted to be without value .
It is certain that no slip occurs , at any rate in the case of substances which are wetted by the liquid .
In conclusion I must offer my most sincere thanks to Professor J. J. THOMSON and to Mr. GLAZEBROOK for the help they have given me , and the many valuable suggestions they have made .
