PERHAPS the solution of no other problem , in natural philosophy , has so often baffled the attempts of mathematicians as that of determining the precession of the equinoxes , by the theory of gravity .
The phenomenon itself was observed about one hundred and fifty years before the christian aera , but Sir ISAAC NEWTON was the first who endeavoured to estimate its magnitude by the true principles of motion , combined with the attractive influence of the sun and moon on the spheroidal figure of the earth .
It has always been allowed , by those competent to judge , that his investigations relating to the subject evince the same transcendent abilities as are displayed in the other parts of his immortal work , THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY , but , for more than half a century past , it has been justly asserted that he made a mistake in his process , which rendered his conclusions erroneous .
Since the detection of this error , some of the most eminent mathematicians in Europe have attempted solutions of the problem .
Their success has been various ; but their invest4gations may be arranged under three general heads .
Under the first of these may be placed such ' as lead to a wrong conclusion , in consequence of a mistake committed in some part of the proceedings .
The second head may be allotted to those in which the conclusions may be admitted as just , but rendered so by the counteraction of opposite errors .
Such may be ranked under the third head as are conducted without error fatal to the conclusion , and in which the result is as near the truth as the subject seems to admit .
The authors of those investigations , of each of the three descriptions , are entitled to much praise .
Their productions afford the most unquestionable proofs of great talents , great zeal , and great perseverance , exerted in the cultivation of science .
The mistakes committed in those of the two first descriptions , and the obscurity and perplexity with which those of the third may be charged , are , in my opinion , to be attributed to the same cause , the uncultivated state of that particular department of the doctrine of motion , which constitutes the appropriate foundation for the solution of the problem .
The department to which I allude is that of compound rotatory motion .
In consequence of this persuasion I have , in the first nine of the following articles , endeavoured to investigate the primary properties of compound rotatory motion from clear and unexceptionable principles .
The disturbing solar force on the spheroidal figure of the earth is then calculated , and the angular velocity which it produces is afterwards compared with that of the diurnal revolution , by means of the properties of rotatory motion previously demonstrated .
The quantity of annual precession is then calculated in the usual way , and also that of nutation , as far as they are produced by the disturbing force of the sun .
58 Let C , ( Plate II .
Fig i. ) be the centre of two circular arcs AB , OF , which are the measures of the angles ACB , ECF ; and let CB cut OF in D. Then , as the sectors ACB , ECD are similar , CA : CE : : AB : ED = CE .
But ( Eu .
3 .
CA VI .
) ED OF : the angle ACB:the angle ECF ; and therefore CE-A : OF : : &lt; ACB : &lt; ECF .
Consequently CExABx &lt; ECF = CA x OF x &lt; ACB ; and therefore AB : OF : : CA x &lt; ACB : CE x &lt; ECF .
s. Let ACB , GEF ( Fig. 2 .
) be two angles , of which the arcs AB , GF are the measures ; and the radii CA , EG not being necessarily equal , let the sines BK , FQ be equal to one another .
Let BE[ , FM be tangents to the curves ; and let HD , MN be parallel to CA , EG respectively , and meet BK , FQ in D , N , as represented .
Then as CBH , BDH are right angles , the triangles CBK , BHD are equiangular , and CB : BK : BH : HD or its equal KL , if HL be drawn parallel to BK , and meet CA in L. Consequently BK BK .
For the same reasons , if MP be parallel to FQ and meet EG in P , FQ = EFM ; and therefore as BK , FQ are , by hypothesis , CBxKL EFxQP HenceC equal , OF Hence CB x KL x FM = OF x QP x BH , and BH : FM::CB x KL : OF x QP .
3 .
If , therefore , we suppose straight lines CH , EM to be drawn , and that the angles BCH , FEM are indefinitely small , and generated in the same time by the revolution of CB , OF respectively , then BH , FM may be considered as circular arcs , and by article , BH : FM : : CB x &lt; BCH : OF x &lt; FEM .
Hence by article 2 , ( and 1 .
V. ) CB x &lt; BCH : OF x &lt; FEM::CB x KL : OF x QP , and therefore &lt; BCH ; &lt; FEM : : KL T -QP .
Consequently , during the generation of the angles BCH , FEM , the angular velocity of CB is to the angular velocity of OF as KL to QP .
4 .
If ACB ( Fig. 3 .
) be any plane angle , and from any point E , OF be drawn perpendicular to AC and EH perpendicular to CB , then the angle FEH is equal to the angle ACB .
For let HK be drawn perpendicular to AC , and let EH be produced to G. First let ACB be an obtuse angle , and then &lt; ACB= &lt; KHC + &lt; HKC+ &lt; KHC + &lt; CHG= &lt; KHG ( e9 .
I. ) &lt; FEH .
Secondly , ACB being an acute angle , the right angle GHC = &lt; GHK + &lt; KHC = &lt; KHC + &lt; HCK= ( 15 I. ) &lt; KHC + &lt; ACB .
Consequently the angle ACB -= &lt; GHK = &lt; FEH .
5 .
Let G ( Fig. .
) be the centre of gravity of a body , and AB , DC two axes passing through G ; and , while the body revolves round AB , let AB and consequently the whole body revolve round DC , the periodical times of these revolutions not being necessarily equal ; it is required to determine the direction and angular velocity with which any particle of the body revolves in consequence of this compound motion .
Suppose the simple motion of the body about AB to be such , that during the revolution the parts towards D from AB would rise above the plane , on which the figure is drawn , and the parts towards C sink below it .
And suppose the simple motion about DC to be such , that during the revolution the parts towards A from DC would rise above the plane of the figure , and those towards B sink below it .
Let P ( Fig. 5 .
) be a particle of the body , above the plane , and let PR be a perpendicular to the said plane.* With the centre G suppose a spherical superficies to be described , passing through P , and let ADBC be the great circle of this sphere in the plane on which the whole is represented .
Let the straight lines OF , tK pass through R , and be perpendicular to AB , DC respectively ; and let EPF , HPK be lesser circles of the sphere , OF being a diameter of the one , and HK a diameter of the other .
Then it is evident , that by the simple motion of the body about AB only the particle P would move in the circumference FP : E ; and by the simple motion of the body about DC only , P would move in the circumference HPK .
Let the indefinitely small arcs Ps , Pq be those which P would describe in equal times with the revolutions about AB , DC separately , and let the parallelogram Pqps be completed on the spherical superficies .
Then it is evident , from the composition of motion[ , that the direction and velocity of P , in consequence of the compound motion , is as the diagonal Pp of the parallelogram Pqps .
Let RrMN be the orthographical projection of Pqps on the plane ADBC , and then as PR is perpendicular to this plane , it is evident that RrMN is a parallelogram , and that its diagonal RM is the direction and velocity of P in the projection , in consequence of the compound motion .
It therefore follows , from article 3 , as RN is the angular velocity about the axis AB , and Rr that about the axis DC , that RM is the angular velocity about the axis , round which the body is caused to revolve by the compound motion .
6 .
The same things being supposed , and the parallelogram RrMN being the same in Fig. 4 as in Fig. 5 , let RM produced meet the circumference in L and Q , and the diameter TGS , at right angles to LQ , is the axis sought .
The same axis may be obtained in the following manner .
In GB take GV equal to RN ; and in GC take GW equal to Rr , and VW being drawn it will be parallel to the axis TS .
For as NR is perpendicular to AB , and Rr or NM to DC , by article 4 , the angle RNM , or ( 34 .
I. ) its equal RrM , is equal to the angle VGW .
Also , on account of the equals , VG : GW::Mr : rR , and therefore ( 6 .
VI .
) the angles rRM , GWV are equal .
Let TS meet HK in 0 , and LQ in I ; and let DC meet HK in X. Then as the angle OIR is equal to the angle OXG , each being a right one , and as the angles IOR , XOG are equal , the angle IRO , or MRr is equal to the angle OGX .
Consequently the alternate angles XGO , GWV are equal , and therefore TS , VW are parallel .
Hence it is evident that if the axes AB , DC , and also GV , GW the angular velocities round them be given , the axis TS is easily found , being parallel to VW .
It is proper to observe that GV , GW are to be set off on that side of TS towards which the body is moving , in consequence of the revolutions round DC , AB .
7 .
From the last article it is evident that VW is equal to RM , and consequently equal to the angular velocity , with which the body revolves about the axis TS .
If therefore CGB be aright angle , then the angular velocity VW= / VG2+ -GW .
In other cases the value of VW may be easily calculated by plane Trigonometry .
8 .
It is to be remarked , for the sake of precision , that the linear velocity , of any point , is as the angular velocity multiplied into the radius of the circle in whose circumference it revolves .
Thus the linear velocity Ps ( Fig. 5 .
) of the point P in the circumference FPE , is as its angular velocity in the same , multiplied into the radius of the circle FPE , as is evident from article g. In the following articles , linear velocity is meant when no adjective is annexed to the word velocity .
9 .
Let AB , DC ( Fig. 6 .
) be the two axes about which separately the body would revolve , as stated in article 5 , and let TS be the axis about which it revolves , in consequence of a combination of these two revolutions .
Let TE be at right angles to AB , and meet it in H , and let TF be at right angles to DC and meet it in K ; and let GV , GW be the angular velocities about AB , DC , as in the preceding articles .
Then it follows , from the last article , that the velocity of the point T , by the revolution about the axis AB only , is equal to GVxHT .
And as this velocity is in the direction of a tangent at T to the circle of which TE is a diameter , and as this circle is perpendicular to the plane ADBC , the direction of this velocity is evidently perpendicular to the plane ADBC .
The direction of this velocity of the point T is also upwards from the plane of the figure , agreeable to the statement in article 5 .
Again , by the revolution about the axis DC only , the velocity of T is equal to GW x KT , and , for the foregoing reasons , the direction of this velocity of the point T is perpendicularly downwards below the plane , according to article 5 .
Now as TS is the axis about : which the body revolves , in consequence of the combined revolutions about AB , DC , every point in TS is rendered quiescent by the compound motions .
It is therefore evident that GVxHT==GWx KT .
1o .
The revolutions about DC , AB may be supposed to be caused by instantaneous impulses at A and D , made at the same time , or at different times ; or they may be supposed to be occasioned:by the agency of constant forces , like that of 6 gravity .
For if the causes be adequate to the production of the same velocities , taken separately , and in the same directions the velocity and direction of a particle will be the same from their combined influence upon it , whether these causes be impulses or constant forces .
As the body is understood to be in free space , if the causes of the revolutions , taken separately , be instantaneous impulses , and made at the same time , immediately after their agency the body will revolve about the axis TS , and it will continue so to revolve with an uniform velocity .
If whilst the body is revolving with an uniform velocity about the axis DC , a constant force begin to act at D , so as to cause a tendency to revolution about AB , as stated in article 5 , and continue afterwards to act at T , the pole of the new axis , from a combination of the constant agency at the new pole and the uniform velocity about DC , the axis TS will incessantly shift its position .
Such exactly are the circumstances to which the earth is subject as to the production of the precession of the equinoxes .
At the vernal equinox , for instance , a straight line drawn from the centre of the sun to that of the earth is in the plane of the equator , and therefore , as equal portions of the protuberant matter of the earth are above and below the ecliptic , the attractive power of the sun has no tendency to alter the position of the equator .
But , in consequence of the earth 's motion in its orbit , it very soon after the equinox presents a different position of the equator to the sun .
The equilibrium of the protuberant parts of the earth , above and below the ecliptic , and towards the sun , is then done away , and the attraction of the sun on that side , where the greatest quantity of protuberant matter is , tends to bring down the equator into the ecliptic , or to cause the earth to revolve about a diameter of the equator .
This attractive influence of the sun gradually increases a little till the summer solstice ; it then gradually decreases in the same degree till the autumnal equinox , when it vanishes .
From the autumnal equinox to the winter solstice it again gradually increases a little ; and it then gradually decreases in the same degree till the vernal equinox , when it again vanishes .
This recurrence and continuance of action is annually repeated .
Similar observations apply to the attraction of the moon on the protuberant parts of the earth .
When a straight line drawn from her centre to that of the earth is in the plane of the equator , the attractive influence of the moon has no ten-dency to change the position of the equator , but in other situations , the attraction of the moon tends to bring the equator of the earth into the plane of the moon 's orbit , or causes the earth to move round a diameter of the equator .
The recurrences of the moon 's action on the protuberant parts of the earth , and the times of their continuing , are repeated every month .
These elfects of the sun and moon are to be considered separately ; and for the reasons already stated , each of the actions , combined with the diurnal revolution of the earth , may be considered as a particular case of compound rotatory motion .
It is needless , however , after investigating the effects of the sun 's action , and expressing them in general formuIme to go over the same steps for ascertaining those of the moon , as they may be inferred from the former , after making due allowance for the different circumstances under which these two remote bodies act on the protuberant parts of the earth .
I now : proceed to estimate the force with which the sun tends to cause the earth to revolve about a diameter of the equator .
11 .
Let S be the centre of the sun ( Fig. 7 .
) C that of the earth ; P , L the poles , PL the axis ; and let a plane passing through SC , PL cut the earth in the meridian PEAQB .
Let EQ be the diameter of the equator , and let DF , the diameter of the spheroid in the plane SPCL , be at right angles to SC .
Let SC cut thie meridian EPQL in A , B ; and G being supposed a particle of matter in this meridian , let GH parallel to SC meet DF in H , and let SG be drawn .
Let M be the quantity of matter in the sun , or its absolute attracting power , and M then is its force upon the particle G , in the direction SG , M and sis its force upon a particle at C , in the direction SC .
But a force whose power and direction is as GS is equal to a force whose power and direction is as GC , together with a force whose power and direction is as CS ; and as the force whose power and direction is as GC , is directed to the centre it has no tendency to alter the position of the axis PL , and therefore may be neglected in the present enquiry .
Now , by Mechanics , SG : SC : : MxS-SC = the force of the sun on the particle G , in the direction CS or HG .
Now as the distance of the sun from the earth is indefinitely great when compared to the diameter DF , its force on any particle in DF is equal to its force on a particle at C , and therefore the sun 's f)rce on a particle at H is as r. Consequently , as the sun 's 66 force on the particle G , in the same direction , is as M-9G , the disturbing force of the sun , by its action on the particle G is MxSC Mx SCV M SG -SC , or GH -SC ' for SG may be considered as equal to SC GH .
But as SC is indefinitely great with reSc spect to GH , by---- , actual division may be considered as equal to -S +3c and therefore the disturbing force on the W , particle at G is 3M : *H SC , .
Let K be a particle in the meridian , but on the opposite side .
of DF to that on which G is situated .
Let KN , parallel to SC , meet DF in N ; and suppose SK to be drawn .
Then the force of the sun on K being , for the sa reasons as before , its force upon it in the direction of SC or KN is M SC SC+KN'3 , and after a reduction similar to the foregoing , the sun 's disturbing force on K is 3MsKN Hence it is evident , supposing M and SC to be constant , that the disturbing force of the sun on any particle in the meridian PELQ is as the distance of the particle from DF ; and that the sign of the force in the half DAF nearest to S is positive , but the sign of the force in the other half DBF is negative , This difference of the signs indicates that the particles on the opposite sides of DF have a directly opposite tendency , as to direction , in afecting the position of the axis PL , or equator EQ ; and the same is evident from the following considerations .
As the disturbing force is as its distance from DF , it has no effect on particles in DF , and therefore the inertia * of particles in DF may be considered as equal to the sun 's disturbing force , on the principle of action and reaction being ; equal as to magnitude , but directly contrary as to direction. .
But on the side of DF nearest to S the disturbing force is greater than the inertia of any particle G , and it therefore urges the particle from DF towards S , by a pressure whose direction and power is as HG .
On the side of DF opposite to S the disturbing force is less than the inertia of any particle K , and therefore the inertia of K opposes the disturbing force of the sun by a pressure whose direction is from N towards K , and whose power is as NK .
12 .
As , by the nature of the spheroid , PELQ is an ellipse , let GK be the diameter conjugate to DF , and let VI , parallel to DF , meet it in T , and AB in R ; and then VI is bisected in T. Let RI be bisected in v , and let w , q be two points in RI , equally distant from R and I respectively .
Let a EC , and d= the disturbing force of the sun at the distance of EC d from DF .
Then by the preceding article , a:RC : d : x RC .
the force at R , or at any point in VI , as any two points in VI are equally distant from DF .
Now it i 's evident that the disturbing force on a particle at R , or on any particle in AC , has no power to turn the ellipse about C ; but the force on a , particle at w tends to turn the ellipse about the centre , for it is applied at the end of the lever Rw .
Consequently , by what ias been already proved in this article , and by the property of the lever , the force on w tow turn the ellipse is x RC x Rw .
For the same reasons , the force on q to turn the ellipse is .
dx RC x Rq , and therefore the force on w and q combined , , o tun tilde ellipse is RC RfRR to turn the ellipse , is Tx RC x RI , for Rw + Rq RL0 .
68 Hence , as Rv or ?
~ expresses the number of particles in Rv or vI , it follows that the force of all the particles in RI , to turn the ellipse , is x RC xIx Rx x RC x RI .
In the same way it may be proved that the force of all the particles d in VR , to turn the ellipse , is 2x RC x RV ' .
But the force of the particles in RI tends to turn the ellipse upwards in the direction FAD , and the force of the particles in RV tends to turn it downwards in the contrary direction DAF .
The force of all the particles in VI , therefore , to turn the ellipse , i1 x RC x RV-RI ; .
But as TV is half the sum of RV , RI , it follows that RT is half their difference , and therefore RV , -RI1= VI x 2RT .
Consequently the force of the particles in VI , to turn the ellipse , is x RC x VI x 2RT =a x RC x VI x RT .
13 .
Let c= CG , b =CD , f Gf H , g= CH , y= CR , and x= CT .
Then by similar triangles , c:f : x : ; and c : gxX= RT .
Also , by the property of the ellipse c:b : : GT xTK:'TV2 : : c + .
x c-Tx : TV2 : : cTV.2 b v/ -,2b , _ , a Consequently TV vcI , and VI == vC and d the force of the particles in VI , to turn the ellipse , is xyx g_ zbfgvz 4V/ -t ; nf2 vc -.r2 xgf= Vcx , by putting for y. The cxC a-C3 c _bdfgx'bd : ' fluxion of this force is therefore zbf .

Again , as VI is 4 C " e-qual to =2b v -/ xC , , the fluxion of the area DVIF is 2b V/ cG- , x =x xx v/ c --x ' , and therefore the fluent of X ' C-2 VcO-X2 is the area DVIF ; and the fluent of 2fx X v'c-a xx Cz CZ is the area DVIF x C- .
Consequently the area DVIF x -Xbf Xc -1= the fluent of -2 xx v/ C2-2 , and there .

Hence , when x becomes equal to c , the force of all the particles in the semi-ellipse DGF , to turn the ellipse , is equal to the semi-ellipse DGF x dfg cd f. Byarticle Ax = the semi-ellipse DGF XxT g. By article 1 , therefore , the force of all the particles in the whole ellipse , which tend to turn it about the centre , is the whole ellipse af PELQ XXX 7o ' The other circumstances as to the figure being the same as before , let the straight line GV ( Fig. 8 .
) touch the ellipse in G , meet QE in V and CM parallel to GH in M. Let GI be perpendicular to QE and meet it in I , and let GH meet EQ in T. Then , by a well known property of the ellipse , CI : IT : : EQ : its parameter ; and therefore by the nature of a parmeter , or three proportionals , CI : IT : : CE2- : CP2 , and Cl x CPI CI x CP " IT== -.Hence CT = CI IT = CI ; and by CEI another well known property of the ellipse , CV = .
Consequently CT x CV -= CE2 CP .
Now as MAC is part of the straight line drawn from the centre of the sun to that of the earth , the angle ACE is the sun 's declination , and as DC is perpendicular to AC , the angle ECD is the complement of the declination .
Let m= the sine of the declination , and n =its cosine , and then , radius being 1 , CT : CH : : in , and CV : CM or ( g34 .
I. ) its equal GH : : n. By multiplication therefore , CT x CV : CH x GH : : i : mn .
Consequenty , using the same notation as in the last article , and putting e CP , as CT x CV -CE2 CP2 , we have a2e:fg : 1 : inn , and eJ = a2 -2 x mn .
If therefore X denote the area of the ellipse PELQ , by the last article , the force of all the particles to turn the ellipse is axnx a'-e9 x X. 16 .
Let PELQ be the same ellipse in Fig. 9 , as in the 7th and 8th figures .
Let the spheroid be cut by a plane parallel to PELQ , ( Fig. 9 , ) and let the section be the ellipse HKNG ; and let this ellipse be supposed to be above the plane of the paper on which PELQ is represented .
Again , let the spheroid be cut by a plane passing through PL , and perpendicular to the plane PELQ , and let the line of common section of this plane with the ellipse HKNG be HN , and let this ellipse be cut by the plane , of the equator in the line KG .
Then HN ( 14 .
XI .
) is parallel to PL , and KG to EQ ; and therefore ( io .
XI .
) HN , KG cut one another at right angles .
Again , as the axis PL is perpendicular to the plane of the equator , the plane of the equator is perpendicular ( 18 .
XI .
) to the ellipse PELQ .
The planes passing through the centre of the spheroid and the lines HN , KG are therefore perpendicular to the ellipse PELQ , and consequently ( 19 .
XI .
) the straight line passing through the centre of the spheroid , and the point in which HN , KG cut one another , is perpendicular to HN , KG and also to PL , EQ .
Consequently as the equator is a circle , KG ( 3 .
III .
) is bisected by HN ; and as HN is parallel to PL it is a double ordinate to the diameter of the equator passing through the point in which HN , KG cut one another , and is therefore bisected in this point .
Hence , as by a well known property of the spheroid , the ellipses PELQ , HKNG are similar , it is evident that KG is the transverse , and HN the conjugate axis of the ellipse HKNG .
Let u= the distance of the centre of the ellipse HKNG from the centre of the speroid , and then as the points E , K , G , Q are in the circumference of the equator , a straight line drawn from the centre of the spheroid to K or G is equal to a , and half of the straight line KG = Vaa-u2 .
Again , as the ellipses PELQ , HKNG are similar , a:'e : V a'--u2 : sa -u a half of HN ; and a : a2 -uz : : xX the area of the ellipse HKNG .
Hence , in order to find the disturbing force of the sun on the ellipse HKNG , instead of a2 in the expression - ?
x , n x a'-e xX we are to put a2-u , instead of e ' we are to put x a'-u ' , and instead of X we are to put a X , These substitutions being made , we have mx ao7a 4all-el a2 _2 a xa --u x a- ' X for the sun 's disturbing force on the ellipse HKNG , tending to turn the ellipse about an axis passing through C and perpendicular to the plane PELQ .
This expression for the force being multiplied by u , gives the fluxion of the force on that part of the spheroid between the ellipses PELQ , HKNG ; and the fluent of this , when u bed mn a'--e % 8a3 comes equal to a xs x -a xx X. Consequently the Tx &gt; --xl X_ X double of this , viz. x mn x a'-es xX expresses the sun 's 4a I disturbing force on the whole spheroid .
Hence if Za X , 3 which expresses the solid content of the spheroid , the force on d Z. Let this be called the whole spheroi(d is x ae x a-e .
Let this be called a5 the librating force or pressure , or the force causing libration .
17 .
It is evident , from the manner in which the librating pressure is calculated , that the whole of the disturbing force is occasioned by the protuberance of the spheroid above the greatest inscribed sphere .
For if PELQ were a sphere , as VI ( Fig. 7 .
) is parallel to the diameter DF , and AC perpendicular to it , the straight line VI ( 3 .
III .
) would be bisected in R ; and therefore the disturbing forces , above and below AC would exactly counteract one another .
Let DCF ( Fig. 9 .
) denote a plane perpendicular to the straight line SC , then it is evident that the librating pressure tends to move the earth about that diameter of the equator , which is the common section of the equator and the plane DCF .
For the sake of precision hereafter let this diameter ?
of the equator be called the axis of libration .
V The point E of the equator , nearest the sun , is at the distance of a quadrant from either extremity of the axis of libration For , by hypotlesis , SC is at right angles to the plane DCF , and therefore the axis of libration , which is in this plane , is at right angles to SC .
Again , as PC the axis of the earth is at right angles to the plane of the equator , the axis of libration , which is also in the equator , is at right angles to CP .
The axis of libration , therefore , being at right angles to CS , CP in the plane PELQ , is at right angles to CE in the same plane .
18 .
Let ADBE ( Fig. o0 .
) be an oblate spheroid of which AB is the transverse axis , DE the conjugate axis , and C the centre .
Let AKMBLH be the equator of this spheroid , and consequently at right angles to ADBE the generating ellipse .
Let the spheroid be cut through DCE by a plane DMEL at right angles to ADBE , and let MCL be its common section with the equator .
Then ( 19 .
XI .
) MCL is at right angles : to ADBE , and therefore ACM is a right angle ; and as ACD is a right angle , AC is at right angles to the plane DMEL , and consequently at right angles to any plane parallel to it .
Let the spheroid be cut by a plane parallel to DMEL , and let the common section of this plane with the spheroid be the ellipse FKGH .
Let this ellipse cut the plane ADBE in the straight line FrG , and the plane of the equator in KrH , the point r being the centre of this last formed ellipse , or that point in which it meets AB .
Then , by a well known property of the spheroid , the ellipses DMEL , FKGH are similar , and the area of the first is to that of the other as CA ?
or its equal CM ' to rKt .
Put a= AC or CM , e= DC , x= Cr , and the force of each particle in the spheroid being as its distance from the 74 plane DMEL , let v be the force of a particle at A. Let p= the area of a circle whose diameter is i. Then 4pe = the area of the ellipse DMEL , and as a+xxax a--x = rK ' : a " a-x : : 4pae : 4x a'= the area of the ellipse vx FKGH .
Again , a : : v V : vthe force of a particle at r , again , a and therefore -T 'xa x-x = the force of all the particles in the ellipse FKGH .
Now as this force acts at r , by the property of the lever , the power of the ellipse FKGH , to turn the spheroid , either about DE or ML as an axis , is 4x ai X2-x4 ; and the fluxion of this force is 4T x a2 x'2 * x. The fluent of this , when x becomes equal to a , is ltev ; and 15 the double of this , for the force of the whole spheriod , is 16pa .

Hence it is evident that if the force of each particle in the spheroid , to cause a revolution , be as its distance from the plane DMEL , the particles on one side of this plane having a tendency to cause a revolution in one direction , and the particles on the other side of the plane having an equal tendency to cause a revolution in the same direction , then the pressure with which the spheroid is urged to revolve , either about DE 16pa 3 gv or ML , is as 6e-- .
This force is equal to v Z , if Z be put '5 5 equal to i6p e , the solid content of the spheroid .
19 .
As the librating force x a2e2 x Z , ascertained a5 in article 16 , and the force a Z , obtained in the last article , are calculated on the same hypothesis , viz. that the force of a particle is as its distance from the plane DCF in Fig. 9 , or the plane DMEL in Fig. lo , if they produce equal angular velocities , the spheroids in the two figures being equal in every respect , and all other circumstances being the same , the forces themselves must be equal .
Now at either of the equinoxes the other circumstances are exactly the same in the two figures .
At the vernal equinox , for instance , the straight line SACB in Fig. 9 .
must be in the plane of the equator , and therefore the plane DCF , perpendicular to AB , at this time must pass through the poles P , L. At the equinox , therefore , the straight line SACB , and the plane DCF in Fig. 9 .
are justly represented by ACB , and DMEL in Fig. lo .
Hence the librating force dx mn a-e ' xZ at the commencement of its action , at the equinox , applies to Fig. o , and at its commencement it is equally efficacious to cause revolution about DE or ML .
We are therefore enabled to compare the effect of the librating force , or , the revolution it is capable of producing , at the equinox , about ML , with the diurnal revolution of the earth about DE , in the following manner .
It being admitted that each of the two forces , stated in the beginning of the article , produces the same angular velocity , then d mn .
a ' an e* ax -LZ-= Z Z , and therefore dxmnx a-=v .
But if a constant force act for a given time i , and cause the body to move on which it acts , the velocity generated from the commencement of the motion is as the force .
Consequently , as v denotes the force acting on a particle at A , during the given time t , and is the forces acting on the other particles of the spheroid are proportional to their distances from the plane DMEL ; the angular velocity of A , acquired in the given time t , is also accurately expressed by v. If therefore the force 2Z cease to act at the end of the given time i , the point A , as the spheroid is in free space , will afterwards revolve 76 with the uniform angular velocity v ; but by the doctrine of constant forces , the angle described by A , during the action av .
vd a2-.e ofI - , Z is equal to '--= X-n xx a-e z2 az 20 .
Let AB ( Fig. 6 .
) represent that diameter of the equator about which the librating force begins to cause revolution at the equinox .
Let G be the centre of the earth , and in GB let d ' a. eall e GV be taken equal to v , or x mn x -.e Let w denote the z2 az angular diurnal velocity of the earth about its axis DC : and in GC let GW be taken equal to w. The points V , W being joined , let TGS be drawn parallel to VW , and by article 6 , TS is the axis about which the earth will now revolve , in consequence of the diurnal revolution being combined with the libration about AB .
From T , a pole of this axis , let TK be drawn perpendicular to DG .
Then , by article 9 , GW : GV : : GK : KT .
But as the angle DGT is extremely small , GK may be considered as equal to the radius , and the arc DT as equal to its sine .
Consequently , using the notation already da specified , and considering a as radius , w : x mn x a : a : x mn x -a-== the angular velocity caused by the librating force .
Our next object is to find the value of d in known terms , .
21 .
If t be put for the time of the earth 's diurnal revolution.round its axis , and T be put for the earth 's annual revolution round the sun , then W--is equal to the centripetal force on a body revolving at the equator in the time t , with the velocity w ; and , using the notation of article 11 , m is equal to the centripetal force of the sun on the earth .
By the doctTine of centripetal forces therefore Ms : C SC 7tan ?
and M o(w a ?
** tZ ' bC2 X.t --77 y'xSC an M~*w X SC ' X tx ax ' , andM= xT .
But , by article 1l , the dis turbing force of the sun on a particle at G ( Fig. 7 .
) is equal to 3M-c ; and at the distance a from DF the disturbing force is -.* The foregoing value of M being substituted for it in this expression , we have 3wz __ d , the sun 's disturbing force at the distance a from DF .
This value of d being put for it in the expression at the end of the last article , it follows that the angular velocity of libration , at its commencement at the equinox , is to the uniform angular diurnal velocity as 3 T^ x mnx a to w , or as 3t aB 3x mn x to 1 .
But , according to the preceding notazT " a % tion , t : t : : 360 ?
: 36t = the uniform angular diurnal velocity , a et 36oi 6ot xt and therefore i : 3t x mn x - : 36 nx ra"a = the angular velocity of libration , at its commencement at the equinox .
But as the product mn is the only variable quantity which enters into the value of the librating force , ob3t t azec tained in article 16 , it is evident that 360 x -T x mn x expresses the momentary angular velocity of libration at any time .
We are now to consider this effect of the librating force in the direction in which the force is exerted , viz. in a meridian analogous to PEAQ in Figure 7 .
22 .
Let FLGA ( Fig. 11 .
) represent the ecliptic on the sphere , S the sun 's place in it , L the first point of Libra and A that of Aries ; LBA the position of the equator when the sun is at S , and SB the sun 's declination .
Let FBG be the position into which the equator is pressed in the time t , by a combination of the librating force and the diurnal 78 revolution ; or , which comes to the same , let the spherical angle FBL or ABG be equal to 360 xx mn x -- .
Let h a._ .
ez a--rT .
Then by spherical Trigonometry , sin. F : sin. BL : : sin. B : sin. FL ; and therefore , as FL and the angle FBL are extremely small , the momentary precession FL = 360 x TX x sin. BL hmn x i- , .
23 .
If FG be bisected in C , and the arc CE be perpendicular to FG , meeting LBA in E , and FBG in D ; then the arc CD is the measure of the angle at F. Also , as FL is extremely small , CE may be taken for the measure of the angle at L. Hence as BDE is a right angle , radius : sin. BE or cos. BL : : sin. EBD : sin. ED .
Consequently as ED is extremely 3t cos. BL small , 360 x 2Tz x hmn x rai = ED , the momentary nutation , or the momentary change in the inclination of the equator to the ecliptic .
From the last proportion , and that concluding the preceding article , it follows that FL : ED : : : si- , L.:s. .
BL : : sin , F radius cos. BL sin. F. But cos. EL : radius : : sin. BL : radius x sin. BL cos. B1L tang .
BL ; and therefore , the momentary precession FL is to the momentary nutation ED , as the tangent of the right ascension BL to the sine of the obliquity of the ecliptic .

Let b= the sine of the obliquity of the ecliptic , c its cosine ; z =the arc LS , x i-ts sine , and y= its cosine ; and let 2p = the circumference of the ecliptic .
Then as LBS is a right angle , by the circular parts , cos. BS x cos. BL radius x cos. LS ; that is nx cos. BL =y , radius being i. Again , radius : x : b : b bx == the sine of BS = m. Consequently , cos. BS x sin. BS x cos. BL = mn x cos. BL = bxy ; and therefore , ti by the preceding article , the momentary nutation is 360 x 3r x hbxy , radius being 1 .
Again , : : : T : T= t. Also / -xx = , and , by the fluxional doctrine of circular arcs , z = ; and thereVI- .
--Xx fore i= _X These values of t and y being put for them 2pV I-XX in the above expression , the momentary nutation , or , which is the same thing , the fluxion of the nutation is 360 xpx -ha .
Consequently the nutation , when the sun is at S , is 3t hbxx 360 xx When the sun arrives at the solstitial point C , then x becomes equal to i , and the nutation is then 360 xx -b i8oxIb xt ai-e 3ba bx6o 180 x 3T x --7-x p in degrees , or 10800 x -3 x -x XjP 1465 in seconds .
Now t= one sidereal day , T= 366 = --5 , and therefore 4T'= 1465 .
According to Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S determination of the figure of the earth , a is as 231 , e as 230 , as-e-L 461 and therefore a= 5 .
Also supposing the obliquity of the ecliptic 238 27 ' 45 " , b =398 1487 , and p =3.14159265 .

Consequently the annual precession , caused by the disturbing force of the sun , is L1".03o 6 .
The obliquity of the ecliptic has been assumed as equal to e ?
0 27 ' 45 " , such being its magnitude , very nearly , at the beginning of the year 1807 .
3t bbxx From the general expression 36o x4X -p obtained in article 94 , it is evident , that when the sun is in either of the equinoctial points , the nutation becomes equal to o. Supposing therefore the earth to be subject to no other disturbing force than that of the sun , at each of the equinoxes the earth 's diurnal revolution is made about its axis of figure , as PL in Fig. 9 ; but as at other times the disturbing force tends to cause a libration about a diameter of the equator , it is evident from article io , that the axis about which it revolves deviates , by a quantity extremely small , from its axis of figure .
A similar deviation , of the axis of revolution from the axis of figure , is produced by the action of the moon ; but a minute examination of these deviations is foreign to the present design .
As the foregoing articles extend beyond the supposed difficulty in the subject , it is deemed unnecessary either to add to their number , or to lengthen this Paper by such additional remarks , as may be met with in every respectable publication on Physical Astronomy .
