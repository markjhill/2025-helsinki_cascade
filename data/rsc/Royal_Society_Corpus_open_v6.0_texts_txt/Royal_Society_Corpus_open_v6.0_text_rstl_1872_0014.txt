From the rapid decrease in late years of the amount of Westerly Magnetic Declination over the whole area of the United Kingdom and the adjacent seas , the attention of the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty has been constantly directed to this interesting physical fact as one specially affecting coast navigation and the accuracy of compass-bearings derived from the current charts .
The duties of Her Majesty 's Surveying-vessels engaged on our own shores having within the last few years included districts embracing nearly the whole extent of coastline , the opportunities thus afforded for a careful determination of the magnetic declination at widely spread and favourable localities were , under the direction of Admiral Richards , C.B. , F.R.S. , the Hydrographer of the Admiralty , taken advantage of , and suitable instruments furnished to the Commanding Officers from the Admiralty Compass Department .
Experience has shown that the accurate determination of the magnetic declination requires very careful manipulation and attention to instrumental details , and especially so if observed by the suspended collimator magnet , or by the reflecting apparatus devised by Dr. Lloyd and employed by the late Mr. Welsh in his Magnetic Survey of Scotland , in the years 1857-58 , the account of which will be found in the Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science for 1859 .
Partly from these considerations and from the time required in the use of such delicate instruments , instead of them the well-known Admiralty Standard Compass was in general employed , supplemented occasionally with a Kater 's Azimuth Compass of superior construction .
Every precaution was adopted to ensure the accuracy of the several adjustments of these instruments before they left the Admiralty Compass Observatory ( now established in Her Majesty 's Victualling Yard at Deptford ) prior to the annual resumption of the duties of the surveying-vessels , as well as in the re-examination of their errors on return from the season operations .
The most extended of the series of observations recorded in this paper were made by Staff Captain E. K. Calver in Her Majesty 's Ship 4 Porcupine , ' assisted by Staff Commander George H.- Inskip ; they include Stornoway in the Hebrides , Lerwick in the * Communicated with the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty .

2 X Shetland Islands , and the N. and N.E. coasts of Scotland , the eastern coast of England from Holy Island to the North Foreland , and the N.W. and N.E. coasts of Ireland .
The final results are generally the mean of two and sometimes three compasses , the individual observations having been made on several azimuths round the horizon , the true or astronomical bearings of the distant objects employed being obtained by an altitude azimuth instrument or theodolite of suitable size and telescopic power .
The observations on the west coast of Scotland were made by Captain ( now Admiral ) Otter with an Adie 's Variation Instrument , in which three separate reversible needles were employed .
The remaining declinations recorded , to which the observers names are appended , have received equal care in their determination with those above described .
With the exception of a few stations , chiefly on the west coast of Scotland , for which the true or astronomical meridian had been furnished to the Admiralty Surveyors from the Ordnance Survey Office at Southampton , the astronomical meridian to which all the magnetic bearings were referred by the several observers was generally determined in the following manner .
With an azimuth and altitude instrument or the large class of theodolite employed in the Admiralty Coast Surveys ( with azimuth circles of 5 to 6 inches diameter ) , \#151 ; the zero of which was set to some well-defined object , \#151 ; the sun 's exact altitude , together with the time of its centre passing the middle wire of the telescope , were noted , as also the reading of the azimuthal circle .
With the exact latitude and longitude as obtained from data furnished by the Ordnance Survey Office , the sun 's astronomical bearing and also that of the zero-point of the instrument , together with the terrestrial object to which it was directed , were thus derived , by two separate methods , from well-known formulae .
Azimuthal angles were then measured from the zero object to five or six well-defined landmarks , equally distributed , where possible , round the horizon ; and these angles being referred to the astronomical bearing of the zero object , the astronomical bearings of the several landmarks from the instrument were thus known .
The azimuth compass was now placed in the exact position of the azimuth and altitude instrument , and its sight-vanes directed successively to the several landmarks round the horizon , and their magnetic bearings observed , the mean value of the several differences between the magnetical and astronomical bearings being taken for the magnetic declination [ or variation of the compass ] at the station .
The observations have been finally reduced to the 1st January , 1872 .
For this purpose an arbitrary value ( an assumed average free from diurnal change ) has been assigned for the magnetic declination at Greenwich Observatory for that date , namely 19 ' 40 ' W. The differences between this assigned value and the recorded declination at Greenwich Observatory at the exact time* when the several observations were made on the coasts have been applied to the latter as corrections , and will be found detailed in the tabular * The Greenwich Magnetical Observations are published to 1868 , and from this .source the corrections to that date have been obtained .
For subsequent comparative values I am indebted to the Astronomer Royal and Mir .

abstract as the secular change .
These corrections , though not strictly accurate , as will be hereafter seen , from the unequal values of the annual changes of the magnetic declination on the several coasts of the United Kingdom , are nevertheless far within the limits of the probable errors of the observations themselves , and may therefore , I apprehend , be safely adopted as bringing the several observations forward to one common epoch , as well as clearing them from diurnal and other inequalities .
The results thus brought to one epoch were placed on a Mercator 's Chart of the British Islands , and the lines of equal declination for each degree graphically drawn through the several values .
In this delineation of the lines of equal value I was greatly assisted , both in the determination of their direction and the slight amount of necessary curvature , by numerous observations of the magnetic declination made in neighbouring countries and in the adjacent seas extending to the Arctic Ocean , which cannot be introduced in the appended Chart , but which had been used in the preparation of a Magnetic Variation Chart of the World , published by the Admiralty in 1871 .
The procedure here adopted is , under the conditions of so extended an area and limited number of observations , perhaps better adapted for a truthful representation of the Iso-gonic lines than their calculation according to the usual method , where the differences of the values of the magnetic elements are linear functions of the differences of latitude and longitude , and accordingly straight lines .
From the records of the fixed Magnetic Observatories in this and adjacent countries , it is now certain that the annual change , i. e. a decrease of westerly declination , is gradually accelerating , and in some localities notably so within the last ten or fifteen years:\#151 ; At Brussels* , between 1850 and 1860 , the mean annual decrease was 5'*38 ; between 1860 and 1868 it was 8'T7 .

A comparison of the lines of equal declination , as given on the annexed Chart ( Plate XLYI .
) for the Epoch January 1,1872 , with those given in the Phil. Trans , of 1870 for the Epoch 1842*5 , by General Sir Edward Sabine , late President of the RoyalSociety , confirms the opinion I had entertained , as also that in the higher parallels of latitude of this area the change is greater than in the lower , \#151 ; thus incidentally confirming the larger values found at Christiania by M. Hansteen as compared with those observed at Brussels by M. Quetelet .
I have -appended the details of this comparison of the lines of equal declination for the Epochs 1842*5 and 1872 ; but the following abstract brings more clearly to view the general character of the changes in the several geographical limits during the past thirty ( 29*5 ) years:\#151 ; Annual decrease .

Navy ( see Report of the British Association for 1861 , pp. 273\#151 ; 278 ) , % which observations are reduced to the 1st January , 1857 , by similar corresponding Kew observations .
We are thus enabled to obtain an approximate value of the amount of annual change for widely diverse localities in the United Kingdom , and to further test the recent acceleration observed at Greenwich and Kew .

Islands , for the mean Epoch of 1st January , 1857 , in Report on the Repetition of the Magnetic Survey of England ( Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , 1861 ) .
As the recent observations available for this purpose were made between the years 1866 and 1870 , it was not desirable , on account of the large interval between those years and the Epoch adopted throughout ( 1872 ) , to employ the results for that Epoch ; each observation has therefore been corrected by an amount which would reduce the declination to a mean value for the month of the date actually observed ; this correction has been obtained from the Greenwich Observatory Magnetical Tables for 1868 , pages iv \amp ; v , by taking the differences between the mean Westerly declination in each month as deduced from the mean of the mean Hourly declination ( Table III .
) , from the mean Monthly determination of the Westerly declination at every hour of the day , Greenwich mean solar time ( Table II.)*. .
* For the British Islands , with the present average amount of Annual change ( eight to ten minutes ) , these will be found useful Tables to obtain the mean value of the magnetic declination for the month when observed at any hour of the day .
The following Table , which is deduced from Tables II .
and III .
alluded to in the text , has been constructed as it presents at sight the required correction , i. e. the amount in minutes of arc to be applied to the Westerly declination as observed within the limits of the British Islands at any hour of the day , Greenwich mean solar time , in order to obtain the mean value of the Westerly declination for the month .
+ sign denotes the amount in excess above the mean monthly value , and must be subtracted from the observed declination ' ; \#151 ; sign the amount in defect , and therefore to be added to the observed declination .

* Stornoway in the Hebrides has not been included , as the stations where the observations were made at the two dates are some distance apart , and much local disturbance exists in the neighbourhood .
There appears , indeed , on the western coast of Scotland generally and on many of the outlying islands , to be great difficulty in sole3ting a position to avoid local disturbances from basaltic and other eruptive rocks .
Compass Hill at Canna is a notable example .
