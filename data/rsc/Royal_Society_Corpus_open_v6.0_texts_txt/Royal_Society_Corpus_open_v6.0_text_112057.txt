" Aerial Tides .
" By PLINY EARL CIHASE , A.M. , S.P.A.S. Communicated by Major-General SABINE , Pres. R.S. Received June 16 , 1864 .
The remarkable coincidence which I have pointed out * between the theoretical effects of rotation and the results of barometrical observations , has led me to extend my researches with a view of defining more precisely some of the most importanit effects of lunar action on the atmosphere .
The popular belief in the influence of the moon on the weather , which antedates all historical records , has received at various times a certain degree of phi .
losophical sanction .
Herschel and others have attempted partially to formulate that influence by empirical laws , but the actual character of the lunar wave that is daily rolled over our heads , appears never to have been investigated .
Major-General Sabine has shown that the moon produces a diurnal variation of the barometer , amounting to about 006 of an inch at St. Helena , which is nearly equivalent to -I of the average daily variation ( Pbil .

This would indicate a tidal wave of rather more than 1 ft. for each mile that we ascend above the earth 's surface , or from 3 to 6 ft. near the suimmits of the principal mountain-chains .
It is easy to believe that the rolling of such a wave over the broken surface of the earth may exert a very important influence on the atmospheric and magnetic currents , the deposition of moisture , and other meteorological phenomena .
As the height of the wave varies with the changing phases of the moon * , its effects must likewise vary in accordance with mathematical laws , the proper study of which must evidently form an important branich of meteorological science .
Besides this daily wave , there appears to be a much larger , but hitherto undetected , weekly wave .

Flangerguest , an astronomer at Viviers in France , extended his researehes through a whole luinar cycle , from Oct. 1 - , 1808 to Oct. 18 , 1827 , and he inlferred from his observations1 .
That in a synodical revolution of the moon , the barometer rises regularly from the second octant , when it is the lowest , to the second quadrature , when it is the highest , and then descends to the second octant .
2 .
That the varying declination of the moon modifies her influence , the barometer being higher in the northern lunistice than in the southern .
The more recent and more complete observationis at St. Helena give somewhat differenit results , which serve to confirm the natural 2 priori coiiviction that there are two maxima and two minima in each month .
The means of three years ' hourly observations , indicate the existence of waves which produce in the first quarter a barometric effect of + -004 in .
, in the second quarter of*016 in .
, in the third quarter of + 018 in .
, and in the fourth quarter of -*006 in.-results which appear to be precisely accordant , in their general features , with those which would be naturally anticipated from the combination of the cumulative action of the moonl 's attraction , with the daily wave of rotation , and the resistance of the ather .
One peculiarity of the lunar-aerial wave deserves attention , for the iindirect confirmation that it lends to the rotation theory of the aerobaric tides , and the evidence it furnishes of opposite tidal effects , which require conIsideration in all investigations of this character .
When the daily lunar tides are highest , their pressure is greatest , the lunar influence accumulating the air directly under the meridian , so as to more than compensate for the diminished weight consequent upon its " lift .
" But in the general aerial fluctuations , as we have seen heretofore , and also in the weekly tides which we are now considering , a high wave is shown by a low barometer , and vice versed .
The daily blending of heavy and light waves produces oscillations which are indicated by the alternate rise and fall of the barometer and thermometer at intervals of two or three days .
M. Flangergues 's observations at perigee.and apogee seem to show that a portion of the movement of the air by the moon is a true lift , which , like the lift of rotation , must probably exert an influence on the barometer .
On comparing the daily averages at each of the quadratures and syzygies , I found the difference of temperature too slight to warrant any satisfactory inference , but a similar comparison of the hourly averages , at houirs when the sun is below the horizon , gave such results as I anticipated ; as will be seen by a reference to the following Table of Barometric and Thermometric Means at the Moon 's Changes .

0044 '0047 61'63 60 37 59'823 In obtaining the above averages , I was obliged to interpolate for such changes as took place on Sundays or holidays , when no observations were taken .
The interpolation , however , does not change the general result , and on some accounts the Table is more satisfactory than if the observations had been made with special reference to the determination of the lunar influences , accompanied , as such a refereiice would very likely have been , by a bias to some particular theory .
The thermometric and barometric averages show a general correspondence in the times of the monthly maxima and minima , the correspondence being most marked and uniform at midnight , when the air is most removed from the direct heat of the sun , and we might therefore reasonably expect to find the strongest evidences of the relations of temperature to lunar attraction .
By taking the differen'ce between the successive weekly tides , we readily obtain the amount of barometric effect in each quarter .
The average effect is more than three times as great in the third and fourth quarters as in the remaining half-month , -a fact which stiggests interesting inquiries as to the amount of influence attributable to varying centrifugal force , solar conjunction or opposition , temperature , &amp;c. Although , as in the ocean tides , there are two simultaneous corresponding wa-ves on opposite sides of the earth , those waves are not of equal magnitude , the barometer beiuig uniformly higher when the moon is on the inferior mneridian , and its attraction is therefore exerted in the same direction as the earth 's , than when it is on the superior meridian , and the two attractions are mutually opposed .
Some of the views of those who are not fully satisfied with the prevailing theory of the ocean-tides , derive a partial confirmation from this fact .
I find , therefore , marked evidences of the same lunar action on the atmosphere as on the ocean , the combination of its attraction with that of the sun producing both in the air and water , spring tides at the syzygies , and neap tides at the quadratures ; and I believe that the most important normal atmospheric changes may be explained by the following theory : The attractionand rotation-waves , as will be readily seen , have generally opposite values , the luni-solar wave being Descending , from 0 ?
to 900* and from 180 ?
to 2700 , Ascending , from 900 to 180 ?
and from 2700 to 00 ; while the rotation-wave is Ascending , from 3300 to 60 ?
and from 1500 to 240 ?
, Descending , from 60 ?
to 1500 and from 240 ?
to 3300 .
From 600 to 90 ?
and from 2400 to 2700 , both waves are descending , while from 1500 to 1800 and from 330 ?
to 360 ' both are ascending .
In consequence of this change of values , besides the principal maxima and minima at the syzygies and quadratures , there should be secondary maxima and minimat at about 600 in advance of those points .
The confirmation of these theoretical inferences by the St. Helena observations appears to me to be quite as remarkable as that of my primary hypothesis .
If we arrange those observations in accordance with the moon 's position , and take the average daily height of the barometer , we obtain the following Table of the Lunar Barometric Tides .
