Extract of a Letter , dated January 6 , 1855 , from J. MITCHELL , Esq. , Quartermaster of Artillery , Bangalore , " 'On the Influence of Local Altitude on the Burning of the Fuses of Shells .
" In the early part of the year 1848 , at the annual practice of the Artillery in this garrison , it was observed that the fuses burned too long a time .
The regular burning of fuses being a matter of much importance , the circumstance was duly reported to Artillery Head Quarters , and a portion of each kind was directed to be sent to St. Thomas 's Mount ( eight miles from Madras and on the same level ) for examination , where they were found to burn correctly , and as at that time no one suspected the real cause of the discrepance , it was concluded there had been some error in the length of our pendulum , and there for the time the matter rested .
" But as I was satisfied , for many reasons , that it was not owing to an error in the pendulum , I determined to keep the subject in mind , and for the practice in the following year ( 1849 ) I caused to be made an adjustable pendulum which beat seconds very correctly for several minutes .
This pendulum was daily compared with two or more seconds ' watches to make all safe , and , as our longest time of flight did not exceed twenty seconds , no error could possibly arise from this source .
The result was that the fuses again burnt too long at Bangalore , and were again found to burn correctly at St. Thomas 's Mount .
" This was a mystery to all ; but after the matte rhad cost me much thought , it occurred to me that the cause was to be sought in the difference of altitude between St. Thomas 's Mount and Bangalore , nearly 3000 feet ; and as a means of putting this to the test , I suggested that some fuses should be burnt at the Mount , or at Madras , under a receiver , exhausted until the barometer stood at the Bangalore mean height , or about 27 inches .
This , however , it was not found convenient to do ; but , as an equally satisfactory way of testing the accuracy of my conclusions , a small number of fuses were prepared and burnt at St. Thomas 's Mount , at Bangalore , and at two different altitudes on the Neilgherry Hills , as will be seen by the annexed copy of an official memorandum ; and although this experiment was too limited to enable us to compile a scale of the probable times a certain length of fuse composition would burn at given altitudes , it amply proves the fact that combustion is retarded at considerable elevations .
" Memorandum of an experiment to ascertain whether the atmosphere influences the burning of fuses : " Eighteen 8-inch fuses , made of the same description of wood ( Congo ) , were filled with composition made for the purpose .
The same man drove the whole on the morning of the 2nd August 1849 , using the same mallet and drifts .
Six of the fuses were burnt at the Mount , six at Bangalore , and six on the Neilgherry Hills ; all in the presence of artillery officers ; the result is shown below":Length Time BaroThermoHeight above Timle .
