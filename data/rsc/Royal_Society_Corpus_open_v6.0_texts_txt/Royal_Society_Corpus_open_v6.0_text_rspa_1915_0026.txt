not desirable in the case of an aeroplane .
the ratio of lift to drift is greatest when the angle between the planes is least , but the lift is small .
These two conclusions agree with the experimental results that aerofoils with a large camber give a better ratio of lift to surface , whereas nearly flat aerofoils give a better ratio of lift to drift .
The figures given in Iable I show , however , that the ratio of lift to drift , for a large value of even , is greater than the corresponding ratio for the chord , and the lift on a bent plane is much greater than on its chord .
Hence it appears that a bent plane is decidedly more efficient than its chord .
Further , from the last Table it is seen that as the length of the front plane increases , the total lift decreases , whereas the ratio of lift to drift increases .
