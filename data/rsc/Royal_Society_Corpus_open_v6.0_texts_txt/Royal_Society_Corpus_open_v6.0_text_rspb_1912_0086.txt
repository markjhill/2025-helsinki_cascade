in Palaeozoic Monticuliporas the same relation holds , for in the case of fossils encrusting shells , a thin graphite-like layer of alga is sometimes found between the Monticulipora and the shell.* At present I am not prepared to say to what genus the Zooxanthella monad of Merlia belongs .
I propose to name the species " noronhse " in honour of Senhor A. C. Noronha , who rendered invaluable assistance during the dredging operations off Madeira and Porto Santo Island .
The name Merlia is a synonym of Monticulipora , the name of the sponge being Monticulipora normani , Kirkp .

) The trypanosome which forms the subject of the following experiments was kindly forwarded to Mpumu by Mr. E. Montgomery , M.R.C.V.S. , from the veterinary pathological laboratory , Nairobi .
The organism was originally obtained from the blood of a camel from Boran .
Experiments were undertaken to see whether the trypanosome was transmissible by laboratory-bred " r. palpalis , and a few sub-inoculations were performed .
Morphology.\#151 ; Length : 400 trypanosomes taken at random were measured , and the results are given in Table I. As is there shown , the length varies between 18 g and 34 / jl .
Shape : The great majority of the trypanosomes seen are slender ; a few forms occur which are markedly bro\amp ; der .
The flagellar end may be very much drawn out , the kinetic nucleus being sometimes from 4 ^ to 4*5 from this extremity .
Undulating membrane : Well developed .
Flagellum : In the slides examined , only one single specimen was observed in which there could be any doubt as to the presence of a free flagellum .
In the majority , the free portion of the flagellum is very well marked .
Kinetic nucleus : Always clearly discernible ; small and round , situated VOL. LXXXV.\#151 ; B. 2 R Dr. H. L. Duke .
[ Sept. 2 , either almost in contact with the posterior end , or at varying distances from this extremity up to 4*5 / i. Nucleus : Situated near the middle of the body .

\#187 ; 99 4 70 Identity of the Trypanosome.\#151 ; The diagnosis appears to rest between the trypanosomes of the surra-nagana group , e.g. , T. evansi , and eguinum .
The well marked kinetic nucleus seen in stained films excludes T. eguinum , and the absence of any of the characteristic plaque lesions of dourine is against T. equiperdum .
There remain T. brucei and T. evansi to be considered .
The following curve-constructed from Table I corresponds roughly to Bruce 's curve for T. evansi , and the absence of any short stumpy forms from all the experimental animals examined is against T. brucei .
Thus out of 400 specimens measured in the present instance no trypanosomes were seen measuring less than 18 in length , while Bruce describes a considerable number of examples of T. between 13 y and 17 y. Turning to the table of animal reactions little or no assistance is forthcoming in deciding between T. brucei and T. evansi .
In Dr. H. L. Duke .
[ Sept. 2 , both species the disease is typically a very rapid one in white rats , and the number of trypanosomes in the peripheral blood shortly before death is enormous .
The course of the disease in dogs in the above table is not characteristic of either T. bruceior T. evansi , which are rapidly fatal to these 26 30 Length in Microns .
animals .
In the case of surra , however , the disease appears less rapid in its course than with nagana .
Thus Laveran quotes experiments of Lingard s in which dogs lived 27^ , 29 , 34 , 36 , 47 , 97 days after inoculation with T. , the last having been inoculated from a naturally infected bovine .
In the case of T. brucei , however , the same authority gives 26 days as the maximum duration of nagana in dogs .
Though by no means a typical T. evansi it is plain that the above experiments suggest this trypanosome rather than T. h'ucei , and this conclusion is supported by the evidence of morphology .
I shall take this opportunity to consider briefly the question of the biometric method of diagnosing trypanosomes from the point of view of a worker dealing with the problem in the field .
Of late a great deal of attention has been devoted to this method , with the result that there appears to be some danger of its attaining undue importance .
In certain cases it is of undoubted value , as in discriminating between two such species as T. vivax and T. uniforme , where the difference in size is one of the most important 1912.J A. Camel Trypanosome .
567 points of distinction .
Here , however , it will not be necessary to measure a great number of trypanosomes .
In the case of other mammalian trypanosomes , e.g. , T. brucei , gambiense , pecaudi rhodesiense , evansi , equiperdum , equinum , nanum , and congolense exhaustive measurements are of little use in diagnosis .
The following example will illustrate very well both the uses and the limitations of the measurement method .
In papers dealing respectively with the morphology of T. gambiense and T. evansi Bruce gives three curves of T. brucei for purposes of comparison .
The apices of the curves are at 18 g , 20 g , and 24 / arespectively , a very considerable variation .
Further , in dealing with T. evansi , he claims that from a comparison of the two curves it is possible to distinguish the two species from one another .
In the case of T. brucei the bulk of the curve will be between 13 and 35 with T. evansi between 18 g and 30 g. A glance at the curves , however , will reveal the fact that the real difference between the two trypanosomes as determined by the biometric method is that T. evansi shows no forms of less than 18 g in length .
In other words , if in the course of examining a slide a trypanosome is found below say 15 gin length , the diagnosis cannot be T. evansi .
Thus the diagnosis has in reality turned upon the minimum measurements of the two species .
The measurements quoted for the different species of trypanosomes vary with the observer , even although the staining and fixing methods are the same in every case .
This variation is due to a number of factors , the least important of which is probably the technique employed in the actual measurement .
It would appear from Miss Bobertson 's recent work on T. * that an endogenous cycle exists in the mammal , the duration of which is variable and incalculable , the result being that the type of trypanosome predominating in the peripheral blood is constantly changing .
The date of the infection has no constant connection with the course of the phenomenon .
In each cycle the change would appear to be from short to long forms , returning to the short forms again before the temporary disappearance from the blood .
To obtain an accurate conception of the dimensions of any trypanosome it is plain that all the stages of such a cycle must be followed out , from its commencement to its conclusion .
Slides taken haphazard from time to time are useless for comparative purposes , as practically any type of curve may be obtained according to the stage of the cycle .
The three curves of T. brucei quoted above from Bruce 's paper are an instance of this .
In a recent report summarised in ' Sleeping Sickness Bulletin 36 ' ( vol. 4 , p. 145 ) , Dr. Stephens lays great stress on the minute technique of measurement , and * ' Roy .

points out that Bruce 's method is open to criticism .
The contention advanced here is that such a criticism , though doubtless true as regards geometrical exactitude , is irrelevant as regards its practical application .
The errors involved are so small that they can have no serious effect in the matter of diagnosis , when all the other aspects of the question are considered .
Dr. Stephens does not apparently criticise the method of preparing the slide adopted by Bruce , he merely asserts that the actual estimate may err within fractions of a micron .
Surely such a source of error cannot be very important in plotting out a curve whose unit is 1 fi , considering , for example , that all values between 5*5/ 4 and 6*5 / 4 will necessarily be registered as 6/ 4 .
Again , there are other considerations which tend to make the biometric method of diagnosis at best inconstant:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Fixation will vary in different parts of the same slide and in the preparation of slides by different observers .
( 2 ) Numerous varieties of strain exist among trypanosomes of any species .
( 3 ) The great similarity between many so-called species as regards their length variation .
( 4 ) Probably continued maintenance in laboratory animals leads to slight alterations in the morphology of a strain , which to be kept true should from time to time be passed through its insect host .
Thus the age of a strain after its last passage through the appropriate intermediate host may be a very important factor in determining its morphology .
In the face of such objections it would appear that , although the biometric method may have a certain value in diagnosis , such refinements as suggested by Dr. Stephens are by no means essential .
What is required is that measurements be made in as constant a manner as possible .
Dr. Stephens ' method , involving as it does a complicated projection apparatus , is quite impossible for workers in the field .
This in itself is an objection which would seriously neutralise undoubted advantages .
It is , however , difficult to believe that the ultimate results of the application of both methods to the same slide would differ to any appreciable extent .
Granting , however , for the sake of argument Dr. Stephens ' contention , it must still be remembered that its occasional employment will introduce yet another variable factor into this method of diagnosing trypanosomes .
