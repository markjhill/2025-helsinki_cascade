On the Specific Heat of Metals in producing superior offspring .
It is shown , for example , that if an individual who possesses a degree of character only found in one in twenty be considered " exceptional , " then eighteen times as many exceptional men will be born of non-exceptional parents as of exceptional parents ; but on the other hand , exceptional parents produce exceptional offspring at a rate ten times as great as non-exceptional parents , the greater gross product of the latter being due to their much greater numbers .
^ In othe* words , distinguished parents are more likely to have distinguished offspring than undistinguished____ten times as likely\#151 ; and yet only one distinguished man in nineteen will be born of distinguished parents .
The importance of such conceptions for bQth natural and artificial breeding can hardly be over-estimated .

( Abstract .
) The experiments described in this paper were begun with the object of assisting in the determination of the relative values of the atomic weights of cobalt and nickel , but were continued with the further purpose of testing the validity of the law of Dulong and Petit .
The metals cobalt and nickel closely resemble each other in density , melting point , and other physical properties , as well as in atomic weight .
The pure metals were prepared for the purposes of these experiments with the most scrupulous care , the cobalt by taking and the Relation of Specific Heat to Atomic Weight , 245 advantage of the slight solubility of purpureo-cobaltamine hydrochloride in strongly acid solutions , and the nickel by deposition from the carbonyl compound and subsequent solution of the metal and electro deposition .
Both were fused by means of an oxyhydrogen flame , and afterwards shaped into bars .
For the estimations of specific heat between 15 ' C. and 100 ' C. the differential steam calorimeter of Professor Joly was employed .
The mean specific heat of cobalt within these limits of temperature was found to be 0T0303 .
The mean specific heat of nickel was found to be 0T0842 .
In order further to test the method and the conclusion from the case of cobalt and nickel , gold was compared with platinum , and copper with iron .
The following are the mean specific heats for these pure metals after fusion , and within the same limits of temperature:\#151 ; Gold ... .
0-03035 Platinum ... .
0-03147 Copper 0-09232 Iron ... .
0-10983 When these values for the specific heats are multiplied by the respective atomic weights of the several metals , the products are not constant , as the law of Dulong and Petit would seem to require if applicable at all temperatures .
The influence of impurities on the specific heat of several metals was then investigated , and a number of results are given , from which it appears that small quantities of carbon or other non-metallic element tend to increase the specific heat appreciably , while the presence of a small quantity of a foreign metal seems to produce little effect .
A series of calorimetric experiments were next made by the method of mixtures on the two pure metals cobalt and nickel , at the temperature of solid carbon dioxide , -78-4 ' , and at that of boiling oxygen , - 182,5 ' .
The results , which are given below , show that as the temperature is reduced the value for nickel declines more rapidly than that for cobalt , and hence that , when the mean results are plotted out , the curves steadily approach each other .
The mean specific heats of cobalt and nickel now stand as follows :\#151 ; Temperature .

Nickel .
From 100 ' to 15 ' 040303 040842 " 15 ' " -78-4 ' ... .
0-0939 0-0975 " 15 ' " -182-4 ' ... 0-0822 0-0838 and by calculation from the last two results from - 784 to - 182-4 ' , 0-0712 , 0-0719 .
On the Specific Heat of , \amp ; c. It seems probable that at absolute zero the values of the products of specific heat , multiplied by atomic weight , would be identical , or differ only by the very small amount due to experimental error.* Appendix .
The following calculations have been made by E. R. Verity , Assoc. R.C.S. , and H. L. Mann , Assoc. R.C.S.:\#151 ; If cobalt and nickel were in the states of perfect gases , their specific heats at constant volume would be ko = 0*04123 for cobalt .
h = 0*04145 for nickel .
This is on the assumption that multiplied by the atomic weight is the same as for hydrogen .
It is not unreasonable to assume that in no state can the substance have a smaller specific heat than It is easy to show that for any of the metals the specific heat at atmospheric pressure K is not more than 2 per cent , different from the specific heat under any other condition , such as great hydrostatic pressure , to keep its volume constant .
Our ignorance of the molecular state of a solid is so great , that we cannot even speculate on how it is that when 1 gramme of cobalt ( we have much the same figures for other metals ) at 50 ' C. rises in temperature to 51 ' C. , whether it is allowed to expand freely or is subjected to great hydrostatic pressure which prevents expansion , the energy 0*041 enters it as what may be called the real sensible heat , and the energy 0*062 enters it as some kind of energy of disgregation , necessary because of change of temperature , and having nothing to do with change of volume or pressure .
The facts are not explainable by assuming that the atomic weights are wrong , because , as we see from cobalt and nickel , K approaches the value ko at low temperatures .
Indeed , if the following formula is correctly deduced from the above measurements , we may say that in the solid state the product of the atomic weight and specific heat may be anything between what it is for hydrogen and 2*7 times this amount .
The formula is K ^o + 1+d8 ' where t is the absolute temperature .
* Note added March 3.\#151 ; Further experiments made , since the date of communition , upon the metals silver , copper , iron , and aluminium show , however , that this suggestion will not be realised .
The mean specific heat of silver between 15 ' and 182*4 ' , for example , is 0*0519 , while from 100 ' to 15 ' it is 0*0558 .
The decrease of specific heat at the lower temperature is therefore much less than in the case of cobalt and nickel .
