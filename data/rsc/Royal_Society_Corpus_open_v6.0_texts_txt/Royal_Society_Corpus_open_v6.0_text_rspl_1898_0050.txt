The other two constants depend , the length of the stoppage at the lowest point of the range , and the ration between the rates of the lowering and the recovery of pressure , 'e results calculated in this way show a very satisfactory agreement .\sh the Blew verifications .
The investigation being principally intended to increase the useful-js of the existing Kew test , and to show where it is most in need ( amplification or amendment , attention is primarily given to the tfectsof aneroids .
It is hoped that the increased knowledge of these sfects will enable rules to be framed for the rejection of aneroids , and tit in this way it will be made worth while for makers to improve 18 instrument .
The large differences brought to light between ( ferent aneroids , show that the means of markedly raising the average 3 already at the makers ' disposal if they choose to utilise their owledge .
The present enquiry also shows clearly how the effects tentative improvements may best be ascertained .
The method of ilising aneroids to the best advantage in determining mountain ights is not formally considered , but a variety of the results should vertheless be found of immediate service by any traveller of intel-ence who has this object in view .

( Abstract .
) The first part of the paper refers to the emissivity of a bright atinum surface in air and in other gases .
The temperature measurements are based on the researches of illendar and Griffiths , confirmed by the recent determinations of eycock and Neville .
To check the calibration of the thermometers higher temperatures , the melting point of palladium was used .
A nnber of the curves are extended to 1779 ' C. by a direct measure-ent of the emissivity of platinum and palladium at their melting tints .
The platinum wire , which served at the same time as radiator and termometer , was 0T12 cm .
in diameter .
It was placed in the axis !
a vertical glass cylinder , which formed the enclosure .
The effects produced by a change in the size , shape , material , and mperature of the enclosure and in the position and diameter of the ire are also studied .
The temperature is expressed in degrees centigrade , and the emis-vity in C.G.S. units .

A.n abstract of the values obtained is given in the table ( p. 404 ) .
Part II consists of a bolometric study of the radiation emitted by ptinum at temperatures ranging from 500 ' C. to the melting point cthe metal .
It is shown that for theoretical reasons the true rate rehange of the total radiation with temperature lies between the Tues obtained by measuring the heat lost by the radiating body gd those deduced from the readings of any form of bolometer or tirmopile .
By comparing the observations of Dr. J. T. Bottomley and ihleiermacher , based on the first method , with those of F. Paschen .id of the author , made by the second method , a reliable criterion i ibtained by which to test any formula intended to express the law ( thermal radiation .
The formulae of Dulong and Petit , of Stefan , and of Rosetti fail \ en tested in this manner ; whilst Weber 's formula , from 400 ' to \gt ; g ) ' C. , gives results in close agreement with the true rate of unge of total radiation with regard to temperature .
The second part of the paper also contains a description of some spits of interest in the design of the bolometer which was used ( .ring this work .
Part III refers to the variation of the intrinsic brilliancy of plati-ttn surface with temperature .
The results may be expressed by the following formula :\#151 ; ( \#163 ; \#151 ; 400 ) = 889-6 Here t is the temperature in degrees centigrade , and 6 the intrinsic i lliancy in candle power per square centimetre .

This preliminary note is intended to give a very brief account m experiments which have been carried out during the past year id ascertain whether , in addition to nitrogen , oxygen , and argon , .ere are any gases in air which have escaped observation owing ii their being present in very minute quantity .
In collaboration th Miss Emily Aston we have found that the nitride of magne-sim , resulting from the absorption of nitrogen from atmospheric p , on treatment with water yields only a trace of gas ; that gas is drogen , and arises from a small quantity of metallic magnesium c iconverted into nitride .
