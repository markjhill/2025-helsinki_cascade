The nebulae , of which an account is given in this paper , were observed with the speculum of three feet aperture described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840 : and the object of the observations was rather to test its powers and to decide the merits of progressive experiments than to seek for astronomical results .
Sketches are given of the actual appearance of five of the nebulae observed , namely those numbered 88 , 81 , 26 , 29 and 47 in Sir John Herschel 's catalogue .
The author observes , in conclusion , that all that he has seen confirms the accuracy of Sir John Herschel 's judgment in selecting the nebulae which he places in the class designated as resolvable ; and that every increase of instrumental power still continues to add to the number of the clusters at the expense of the nebulae , properly so called .
It would still , however , be unsafe , he further remarks , to conclude , that such will always be the case , and thence to draw the obvious inference that all nebulosity is but the glare of stars too remote to be separated by the utmost power of our instruments .
