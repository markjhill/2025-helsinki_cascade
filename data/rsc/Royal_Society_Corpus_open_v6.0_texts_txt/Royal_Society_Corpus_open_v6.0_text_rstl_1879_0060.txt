569 Corals.\#151 ; By B)\ F. .* The specimens of Corals procured at Rodriguez amount to 102 and belong to 49 species .
They were taken by Messrs. Slater and Gulliver evidently at moderate depths ; at least no deep-sea forms , especially no or are represented amongst them .
As might have been anticipated , the Rodriguez coral fauna bears a close affinity to that of Mauritius , Madagascar , and the Seychelles Islands , and there can scarcely be any doubt that the species described as new in the present paper will prove to occur likewise in the localities mentioned as well as in others of the Indo-Pacific Region .
Many of the species are common to Rodriguez and the Red Sea ; a less considerable number have been recorded from the north-eastern part of the Indian Ocean ; some of them extend their range into the Pacific .
However , the coral fauna of these regions is hitherto comparatively but little known , and the present collection most likely contains only a small minority .of the Rodriguez species ; so that it would be premature to offer any further remarks on their geographical distribution .

This is a very variable species ; there are specimens with short and long , maean4 c 2 drous and straight valleys ; in one nearly all the calicular fossae are as long as broad plenty of calicles being thus circumscribed .
Walls either thin or thick , even inflated5 Septa in most instances very narrow , but in one specimen ( the one alluded to above ) much projecting towards the centre ; their edges faintly or coarsely dentate Columella rudimentary or well developed , consisting of confluent trabecles or of vertical lamellae , the latter being placed in the direction of the valleys , and sometimes entirely confluent , so as to render such specimens hardly distinguishable from the genus Leptoria .
It is true that most of these differences are of what is called " specific " or even " generic " value ; but I found it impossible to draw any precise lines of distinction .
In the present case the beautiful series procured by the Expedition comprises every stage of transition , and what is most significant , there are frequently different forms represented in different places of the very same corallum .
I have made similar observations on the true Coelorice ; in one specimen of this genus taken in the Led Sea by Professor Haeckel , there are really two " species " on the same specimen , one occupying the centre of the surface , the other two opposite sides , and both passing into each other .

The single Hodriguez specimen may prove to belong to a new species ; the CORALS.\#151 ; F. BRUGGEMANN .
573 calicles are remarkably smaller than in the true quatrefagesana , and their borders less well defined .
Acanthastrcea Corallum low , nearly explanate , with an even slightly undulate surface .
Calicles unequal , irregularly tetragonal or pentagonal , with simple rather thin borders and shallow fossae .
Columella feebly developed , more or less papillose , parietal .
Three cycles complete , a fourth one irregular ; well developed in several systems of the larger calicles , rudimentary or entirely wanting in others .
Septa unequal , thin , slightly granulate , narrow , hardly projecting ; their edges provided with long thin spiniform teeth at the summits , and with shorter and feebler ones towards the centre .
Greatest diameter of calicular fossae , 10 to 14 mm. ; their depth 4 to 6 mm. JPrionastrcea Corallum convex , somewhat lobate .
Calicles polygonal , mostly quadrangular , subequal ; their fossae of moderate depth .
Walls simple , rather thin .
Gemmation takes place at the very borders of the calicles .
Columella pretty well developed , trabecular .
Three cycles complete , a fourth one very incomplete and obsolete .
Septa crowded , unequal , slightly projecting , narrow , thin , smooth , with their edges delicately and equally dentate ; those of the first two cycles suddenly enlarging below and there armed with slender pointed , but not paliform , teeth .
Greatest diameter of calicles averages from 7 to 8 mm. ; depth of fossae 4 to 5 mm. Differs from the closely allied JPr.seych in its thin walls , the regularly denticulate , smooth septa , the smaller calicles and mode of gemmation .
TTom melicerum , a species I have not yet seen , it may be distinguished by the presence of a fourth cycle , and the form of the columella .
JPrionastrcea Corallum explanate , somewhat convex .
Calicles polygonal , slightly irregular ; fossae of medium depth .
Walls simple , rather thick , roughly spinose .
Columella well developed , distinctly papillose .
Three cycles complete , with some additional septa of a fourth one .
Septa ( about 30 in number ) subequal , rather thick , delicately granulate , narrow , hardly projecting ; their edges with scarce , spiniform , sharp-pointed teeth .
Greatest diameter of calicles , 9 to 12 mm , depth of fossae , 6 mm. Yery similar to JPr .
tesserifera , but the columella is crowdedly papillose instead of being spongious , the calicular fossae are deeper , the septa thicker and their teeth stouter and more pointed , giving the whole corallum a spinose aspect .
Uchinopora spinulosa .
Corallum foliaceous , explanate , slightly undulate , unifacial .
Costae indistinct , replaced by irregular series of small , acute , delicately granulate spines .
Calicles oblong , rarely circular , moderately crowded , very little prominent , with shallow fossae .
Columella well developed , delicately spongious .
Four cycles complete Septa crowded , altogether thin , spinulous on their surfaces , the primary , secondary and tertiary ones nearly equal , projecting , unevenly truncate and toothed at the summit , irregularly denticulate and deeply emarginate on the inner edge ; those of fourth cycle much thinner , smaller and not prominent .
Under surface of coralium faintly striate .
Greatest diameter of calicles , 5 to 6 mm. This species should he placed next to E. gemmacea with which it agrees in having the fourth cycle complete and in being partly fissiparous .
It differs from this as well as from the other species by the condition of the costae and by the very slight prominence of the corallites .
It bears a general resemblance to E. in which , however , the fourth cycle is entirely wanting , the costae being well marked and the calicles more projecting .
With the coarsely spinose E. it cannot be confounded ; from E. Jielli it is distinguished by the absence of paliform lobes , and by the number and description of the septa .

In the Mauritius specimen mentioned in my paper , the corallum shows a small compact base from which half a dozen of simple , straight , sub-cylindrical branches arise .
One of the Bodriguez specimens nearly agrees with it , only the branches are more irregular and partly ramified .
The second is apparently very old , the base of the corallum being entirely worn , the branches altogether confluent , and their summits coalescing , forming a nearly continuous plane and bearing the general aspect of the top of a cauliflower .
This condition is evidently due to some immediate outer influence ; most probably the corallum had approached too near the surface of the water .

Dana considers Ehrenberg 's species to be closely allied to , or identical with , M. spicifera ; Milne Edwards who seems to have examined the type specimen places it near to the M. millepora .
In my opinion , it should be united to the M. surculosa , the descriptions agreeing well with each other .
Madrepora monticulosa .
Corallum solid , explanate , spreading .
Surface nearly even , covered for the greater part of its extent with large , stout , rounded , subconical prominences .
Coen-enchyma faintly developed , spongious .
Calicles much crowded , short , sublabellate or nearly tubiform , equal on the cones , intermixed with smaller or immersed ones on the plain parts of the corallum .
Walls rather thin , reticulate , slightly echinu-late .
Septa nearly entirely wanting .
Apical calicles always indicated , but not very conspicuous , with thicker walls and more distinct septa , the latter being generally six to eight in number , Height of corallum , from under surface of base to the summits of largest cones , 60 mm. ; greatest height of cones , 30 mm. ; greatest diameter at base , 20 mm.

Coenenchyma spongious , with most delicately echinulate surface , the minute spines being generally united to small packets .

The present collection contains the true P. , as well as a singular variety , which may be termed P. brevicornis var .
cerebrum .
The corallum is hemispherical , brain-like .
The principal branches are much enlarged and compressed , confluent , maeandrous , subsimple , with nearly smooth summits and obtusely verrucose lateral surfaces .
This form would , according to the classification of Milne-Edwards , be placed in quite another section of the genus , viz. close to P. , etc. , and I should never have ventured to regard it as a variety of the P. , but for the complete series of transitional examples in the collection .

The principal branches are , as a rule , more elongate , and their summits more mseandrous than in the specimen figured by Dana .
The lateral verrucse are very variable : either crowded or more remote , or ( on the outer surface of lateral branches in some of the coralla ) even totally wanting ; either appressed , or more horizontal ; generally pointed and angular , but in one example obtuse and rounded .
One specimen approaches the P. verrucosa in having the summits of minor branches covered with verrucse .
Perhaps the Rodriguez coral is a distinct species ; but since I have no specimens of the Pacific P. grandis for comparison , I abstain from characterising it under a new specific name .
In my opinion , moreover , the species of Focillipora have already been far too much multiplied .
