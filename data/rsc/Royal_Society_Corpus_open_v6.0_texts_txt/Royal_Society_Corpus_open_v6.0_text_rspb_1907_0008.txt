) The effects following on the removal of large portions of the kidneys of dogs were studied by Rose Bradford in 1892 .
In the first place , he found that animals deprived of three-quarters or more of their total kidney weight rapidly wasted , and died in two or three weeks , or even less ; and , although they often refused food , they passed daily an amount of urea almost or quite equal to that passed by the same animals on full diet before operation .
Secondly , he observed that after the removal of a portion of one kidney , the urine became more abundant and more dilute , and the dogs were apparently unable to excrete a concentrated urine ; this effect was intensified by the subsequent removal of the opposite kidney .
Bradford concluded that the kidneys in some manner normally control the nitrogenous metabolism , and that in the absence of sufficient kidney substance this metabolism becomes excessive .
In view of their extreme importance , a repetition of these experiments appeared advisable ; it was hoped , too , that more complete analysis of the urine might throw some light on the course of nitrogenous metabolism as a whole .
This paper contains a preliminary account of our observations .
Methods .
Cats were used for these experiments .
They were anaesthetised with chloroform and ether , the anaesthesia being maintained by ether throughout the operation .
The abdomen was opened in the middle line , and the kidney drawn up into the wound ; the capsule was opened , and stripped off the kidney .
The renal vessels were digitally compressed , a wedge cut out of the kidney , and the cut surfaces brought into apposition and kept together by two or three sutures passing deeply through the kidney substance .
The kidney was then replaced in its capsule and the latter was closed by a continuous suture ; the kidney was returned to its place and the abdominal wound closed .
No vessels were ligatured , since forceps are so apt to damage the kidney substance : a little blood collects between the kidney and capsule , where it clots and checks further loss of blood .

[ Nov. 20 , Two or three weeks later the opposite kidney was removed under ether anaesthesia through an abdominal incision .
The animals were kept in cages whose floor consisted of a wire netting ; the cages stood upon a zinc plate , sloping towards the centre , which was perforated by a small hole .
The urine ran down the zinc sheet through the hole into a basin containing a little chloroform .
The urine and faeces were collected every 24 hours , and very great care was taken to keep the urine free from food or faeces .
The cats were kept at a fairly even , moderate temperature , and were allowed some exercise daily in the laboratory .
The food was measured daily , and any food left over was also measured .
Their diet consisted of minced meat , milk and water ; the amount of the latter , of course , was not restricted .
The total nitrogen in the meat and milk was estimated by Kjeldahl 's method .
A considerable amount of meat was minced , and mixed into a uniform mass ; a sample of this was analysed , and the rest kept in an ice chest ; the cats received a definite quantity each day .
The urine was analysed daily ; the faeces were collected for several days , and the total nitrogen present estimated .
The total nitrogen of the urine and feces was estimated by Kjeldahl 's method , the urea by a modification of Folin 's method , the ammonia by Schaffer 's method , and the creatinin by the colorimetric method of Folin .
All the analyses were made in duplicate .
Results .
The effects of removing portions of the kidneys may be grouped as follows:\#151 ; Firstly , the general conditions of the animals including changes in body weight ; secondly , the nitrogenous metabolism ; thirdly , alterations in the amount and concentration of the urine .
I. The Condition of the Animals.\#151 ; After the first operation , the cats usually drank a little milk on the same day , but for several days their appetite was poor , and they lost weight .
Eventually they ate very well , and appeared to be more hungry than normal cats .
For a day or two the urine contained blood , and for another two or three days albumen was present .
Three cats survived the second operation for some time ; they rapidly recovered from the anaesthesia , and showed very little shock .
Two of the three cats ate very little after the second operation , and refused food altogether during the last few days of life ; the third cat ate well for 10 days , when its appetite also failed .
Vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in all the cats , and they seemed 1906 .

very susceptible to cold .
They acquired a very foul breath , and soreness of the lips and gums ; their fur came off very rapidly .
Cat I lived six days , Cat II lived seven days , and Cat III lived 17 days after the second operation .
The rectal temperature was maintained at 100 ' or more until the last few days of life .
The Body Weight.\#151 ; It will be seen from the following table that normal cats lose weight when kept in confinement , notwithstanding some exercise daily .
The loss of weight , however , is less than that observed in Rose Bradford 's dogs , most of which lost 10 per cent , or more of their initial weight before the first operation .
In our experiments , the cats were not put into the collecting cage before the first operation , so that this initial loss of weight was avoided .

These figures correspond closely with those of Rose Bradford ; he also found that the animals lived much longer after the second operation when they took food .
II .
The Nitrogenous Metabolism.\#151 ; The total nitrogenous metabolism was determined in three cats before and after the second operation ; the urinary nitrogen was also estimated in one of these cats before the first operation .

The clinical condition of these cats was apparently identical with that of Rose Bradford 's dogs ; in both cases , the second operation was usually followed by rapid wasting .
In two of the three cats considerably more than three-quarters of the total kidney weight was removed ; in the third cat rather less than three-quarters was removed , hut since the animal died , one may conclude that cats need rather more kidney than dogs in order to maintain life .
In this connection it may be noted that in cats the average kidney weight is 9T grammes per kilo .
, as compared with 6'7 grammes per kilo , in dogs .
There is no doubt , then , that the experimental conditions of Bradford 's dogs were strictly reproduced .
Yet one of the cats showed no increased output of nitrogen after the second operation ; in one cat the increase of nitrogen first occurred five days after the operation , when the cat had lost 28 per cent , of its weight , and was almost moribund ; and in the other cat the increase occurred four days after the operation , when the loss of weight was 22*5 per cent. In none of the cats did the nitrogen output after the second operation ever reach that observed after the first operation , and it never greatly exceeded that found in normal fasting cats .
The greatest daily output of urinary nitrogen after the second operation , when the cats refused food , was 1*79 in Cat II on the last day of life .
For normal cats kept without food for 24 hours the output of urinary nitrogen is about 1 gramme and the loss of weight about 100 grammes .
The protocols , moreover , show that the second operation has no appreciable effect upon the percentage of urea , ammonia and creatinin relatively to the total nitrogen .
There is no increase in the output of creatinin ( on a milk diet ) such as might be expected if muscular metabolism were excessive .
We find , therefore , that the removal of three-quarters of the kidney weight of cats has no influence upon their nitrogenous metabolism until the last 81 .
1906.1 The Relation of the Kidneys to Metabolism .
two or three days of life .
This terminal increase of nitrogen only occurs when the cats have lost 22 per cent , or more of their body weight , and are obviously in a state of inanition .
The two cats which showed this terminal increase of urinary nitrogen ate very little after the second operation , and wasted rapidly .
* The effect of starvation upon the body weight and urinary nitrogen of normal animals has been investigated by Yoit , Schondorff , Kaufmann , and others .
It |is clear , from a comparison of their results with the condition of our cats , that the condition of starving animals is identical with that of cats which refuse food after the second operation on the kidneys .
There is in both cases a progressive loss of weight , a fall of temperature during the last few days of life , and usually a terminal rise in the output of nitrogen in the urine .
E. Yoit and others have shown that , in starvation , the nitrogen output may increase several days before death , and that the time of its onset is directly related to the amount of fat originally possessed by the animal .
A very fat animal may never exhibit the increase of nitrogen , whereas , if the original store of fat is small , a very few days of starvation suffice to evoke an increased output of nitrogen .
For example , a starving dog , observed by Schondorff , showed an increased output of nitrogen when it had lost 20 per cent , of its weight ; in our cats the nitrogen rose coincidently with a loss of 22 per cent , or more of the body weight .
We consider , therefore , that the wasting , fall of temperature and final increase of urinary nitrogen occur simply because the cats refuse food after the second operation ; they die from inanition , and the rise of urinary nitrogen , when it occurs , merely means that the animal 's store of fat is much diminished , and that more energy must be supplied by proteid breakdown .
We consider , further , that the same explanation fully accounts for the results obtained by Rose Bradford , and that there is no evidence from his experiments that the kidneys directly influence nitrogenous metabolism .
It may be added that Dr. Pembrey has investigated the gaseous exchange of these cats ; he finds that his results are such as would be given by animals in a state of inanition .
III .
The Amount and Concentration of the Urine.\#151 ; The amount and specific gravity of the urine of cats varies widely according to their diet .
On a meat diet the urine is concentrated ; on a milk diet it is abundant and dilute .
Making allowance for variations of diet , we find no evidence that the amount and specific gravity of the urine are necessarily modified by either the first or second operation .
Only one cat almost invariably passed abundant quantities of dilute urine after the first operation ; the others often passed a concentrated urine .
In this respect our results are at variance with those VOL. LXXIX.\#151 ; B. G \#163 ; 2 The Relation of the Kidneys to .
.of Rose Bradford ; and it may be pointed out that the effect , even in dogs , is not a constant one , since in half of Bradford 's experiments the urine was no more abundant after the second than after the first operation .
It may be concluded , therefore , that the increase in quantity and decrease in concentration of dog 's urine , after operations on the kidneys , is an incidental rather than an essential result .

1 .
We confirm Bradford 's observations that removal of three-quarters or more of the total kidney weight in cats is followed by loss of appetite , wasting , and death within a few days or weeks .
2 .
We find that in such cats an increased output of nitrogen is not of constant occurrence ; and that it takes place only in cats which have lost 22 per cent , or more of their initial body weight at the time of its onset .
3 .
We conclude , therefore , that the kidneys have no direct influence upon nitrogenous metabolism , and that the increased output of nitrogen is simply the result of inanition , and is of the same nature as that observed in starving animals .
4 .
We find that , after removal of a portion of one kidney , and also after subsequent removal of the opposite kidney , cats are still able to pass a concentrated urine , and that the amount of the urine is not necessarily increased beyond the normal .
