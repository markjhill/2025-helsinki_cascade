The results are , however , conclusive as regards the normal character of their respective vapour densities .

" The Physical Properties of Liquid Acetylene .

Received June 12 , 1879 .
The hydrocarbon acetylene , being the ojriy one of its numerous class which can be formed synthetically by the direct union of its Mr. G. Ansdell .
[ June 19 , constituent elements , has an especial interest for the chemist .
The chief physical constants of this substance are unknown , although its polymerised modification , benzene , has been very thoroughly studied in its physical relations by Regnault .
Having one of M. Cailletet 's ingenious pumps for the liquefaction of gases at my disposal in the laboratory of the Royal Institution , Professor Dewar suggested a series of accurate determinations of its physical properties in the liquid state , and the present communication deals with the critical point , the tension of the vapour of the fluid at various temperatures , together with the corresponding densities and coefficients of compressibility .
The only notice on the liquefaction of the gas appears to be a short paper by M. Cailletet in the " Compt .
Rendus , " vol. lxxxv , No. 19 , in which he determines the tension of the vapour of the liquid at different temperatures .
These tensions , as will be afterwards seen , differ entirely from those obtained in the present paper , one of the reasons appearing to be that instead of using a carefully calibrated air manometer for determining the pressures , he used the ordinary metallic gauge attached to the pump , which is far from being correct .
The pump itself is too well known to need description , suffice it to say , that two of the iron bottles or reservoirs were used , connected with the pump by a piece of fine-bore copper tubing , so as to equalise the pressure , one containing an air manometer registering the pressures from ten atmospheres upwards , and the other the tube filled with acetylene .
The two bottles were then placed side by side , and the height of the column of mercury in either read off by means of a cathetometer .
The formulae used for calibrating the tubes , and also for calculating the volume of the liquefied gas , and the pressure by the air manometer , were those given by Dr. Andrews in his researches on carbonic acid ( " Phil. Trans. , " 1869 and 1876 ) .
The method of preparing the acetylene gas was by the action of alcoholic potash on bibromethylene , the disengaged gas being collected in the form of the red acetylide of copper , by passing it into a strong solution of subchloride of copper in ammonia .
This red compound , after being thoroughly washed and boiled with distilled water , was transferred to a flask with dilute hydrochloric acid , the gas driven off by means of a gentle heat , and conducted through a strong solution of caustic soda , to free it from traces of hydrochloric acid , and finally through two small JJ -tubes with fused chloride of calcium .
The perfectly pure and dry acetylene was now passed through the tube to be used for its liquefaction in a slow stream for several hours , and the latter carefully sealed off when all the air had been expelled .
The sealing off requi^ps great care , as unless rapidly done , and the pressure removed from the inside ( by cooling the tube ) immediately \lt ; 1879 .
] The Physical Properties of Liquid Acetylene .
211the point is closed , the acetylene becomes rapidly charred and blows out , a small portion of it being consequently decomposed , and thus interfering materially with the accuracy of the results .
The tube for the tension determinations was of the usual shape used in the Cailletet pump , the internal diameter of the capillary part being about 2'5 mm. This was found to be more convenient than a narrower tube , as a larger reservoir could be used , and consequently a larger quantity of liquid obtained .
The pressure at the different temperatures was always observed when a very slight layer of liquid was formed on the surface of the mercury , as the gas not being entirely free from air , the pressure was slightly increased on filling completely the upper part of the tube .
The following are the tensions obtained compared with those of Cailletet:\#151 ; Cailletet .

The temperature of \#151 ; 10 ' was obtained by cooling down alcohol with ice and salt , and that at \#151 ; 23 ' by surrounding the tube with a narrow glass cylinder containing liquid chloride of methyl , which boils constantly at this temperature ; this cylinder being again enclosed in a wider one containing a little phosphoric anhydride to prevent moisture from condensing on the sides .
It was thought interesting to compare the tensions of liquid acetylene with those of the saturated vapour of benzene , being polymeric bodies , although having totally different properties .
For this purpose curves were plotted for the two substances , that for the benzene being taken from Regnault 's results ( " Mem. Acad. Sci. , Paris , " vol. xxvi , p. 420 ) .
They do not , however , run parallel to each other , the benzene having a slower rate of increase at low temperatures , but a quicker rate than the acetylene as the temperature 212 Mr. G. Ansdell .
[ June 19 , rises .
The curves , however , have no appearance of actually crossing at a higher temperature .
The critical point of acetylene , or that temperature at which no appearance of liquefaction takes place , however great a pressure is exerted on the gas , was found after many careful experiments to be 37'*05 0 .
For determining the density and compressibility of the liquid at different temperatures , a tube of much smaller dimensions was used , having a capillary bore of about '8 mm. in diameter , the whole of the tube having a capacity of 36'3708 cub. centims. This gave a column of liquid about 15 centims. long when the upper part of the tube was entirely full at 15 ' C. The density at any particular temperature was taken by forcing the liquid up the capillary tube at that temperature , until the upper part was completely filled ; the length of the column of liquid was then read off , its volume calculated , and this observed volume divided into the calculated weight of the gas at zero .
They are as follows:\#151 ; Temp. \#151 ; 7 ' C. , Density .
*460 \#151 ; 3 , -456 0 *451 + 4*4 ... . .
*441 9*0 *432 16*4 *420 20*6 *413 26*25 ... . .
*404 30*0 *397 34*0 -381 35*8 ... . .
*364 It has , therefore , about half the density of liquid carbonic acid , and if we take the actual volume of the liquid at \#151 ; 7 as unity , it becomes 1*264 at +35*8 , which gives *00489 as its coefficient of expansion per degree , for the total range of pressure ; it is , therefore , only about half as expansible as carbonic acid , whose coefficient is *010 , and is not much more expansible than a gas .
Comparing the density of liquid acetylene with that of liquid benzene , the latter is found to be almost exactly three times as great as the former at the same temperature ; as for instance , at 0'C .
the density of the acetylene is *456 , whereas that of the benzene is *899 ; the vapour density , however , of the benzene is three times as great , viz. , 2*704 .
The apparent compressibility in glass was determined by direct observation , the liquid being forced up in the capillary tube until the latter was completely full , and then the pressure gradually increased , 1879.1 The Physical Properties of Liquid Acetylene .
and the diminution of volume read off at intervals of about 10 atmospheres up to about 180 atmospheres .
Curves were then plotted , showing the volume at different pressures for the same temperature , and from these the coefficient of compression at any temperature and pressure was easily deduced .
The following tables are constructed from the curves .

[ June 19 , It is evident from the above tables that acetylene is governed by the same laws as other compressible liquids , that is to say , its com* , pressibility increases as the temperature rises , but diminishes as the pressure increases .
For instance , at a pressure of 95 atmospheres it is three times as compressible at 35 ' C. as at 0 ' C. The volume being the same , the compressibility appears to be nearly the same at different temperatures , which is really due to the curves at high pressures running nearly parallel , thus introducing a corresponding difficulty in the estimation of small differences .
On comparing the compressibility of liquid acetylene with the results obtained by M. Amagat ( " Annals de Chem. , " 1877 ) in the case of benzene , it appears to be about seven times as compressible as the latter body , at a temperature of 16 ' C. , and under a pressure of 40 atmospheres .
The comparison could not be carried out at higher temperatures , for whereas M. Amagat reaches a temperature of 100 ' C. with the benzene , I was not able to go beyond 35 ' C. with the acetylene .

On the Origin of the Mineral , Structural , and Chemical Characters of Ophites and related Rocks .
" By Professors W. King , Sc. D. , and T. H. Rowney , Ph. D. Communicated by the Treasurer , R.S. Received May 12 , 1879 .
( Abstract .
) The authors , beginning with ( A ) " The different kinds of rocks treated of , " in their memoir , divide them into two groups .
The first , " Silacid Ophites , " is represented by serpentinite ( common at the Lizard ) and other rocks , essentially composed of serpentinous minerals : it includes a subsection , comprising peridolites and some others , all slightly hydrated .
The second , " Silocarbacid Ophites , " consists of rocks , which , in addition to serpentinons minerals , contain a mineral carbonate\#151 ; for example , ophi-calcite .
: its subsection is represented by hemithrenes .
The relation of the first group , through its subsection , to ordinary metamorphic rocks , also of the second group , through its subsection , to carrarites and dolomites is pointed out .
As regards ( B ) " Their mineral character , " it is stated that ophites , \amp ; c. , embrace some fifty or more different minerals , all containing more or less hydrous silicate of magnesia ; in addition to which , dry silicates and carbonates are often present .
The relation of these minerals to others , essentially anhydrous , as hornblende , diallage , and peridote , is noticed .
Treating on ( C ) " The structural character of ophites , \amp ; c. , " the protean nature of their essential mine al , serpentine , is shown by
