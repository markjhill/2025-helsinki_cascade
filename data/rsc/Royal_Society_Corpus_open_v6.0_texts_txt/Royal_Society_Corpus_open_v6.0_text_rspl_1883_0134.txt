Having occasion to observe the spectrum of the flash of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen fired in a Cavendish eudiometer , we were struck by the brightness , not only of the ubiquitous yellow sodium line , but of the blue calcium line and the orange and green bands of lime , as well as of other lines which were not identified .
The eudiometer being at first clean and dry , the calcium must be derived either from the glass or from some spray of the water over which the gases with which the eudiometer was filled had been confined .
It seemed incredible that the momentary flash should detach and light up lime from the glass , but subsequent observations have pointed to that con472 Profs .

Our next experiments were made on the flash of the combining gases inclosed in an iron tube , half an inch in diameter and about 3 feet long , closed at one end with a plate of quartz , held in its place by a screw-cap and made tight by leaden washers .
Two narrow brass tubes were brazed into the iron tube at right angles to the axis , one near each end , and one of these was connected with an air-pumpi ' the other with the reservoir of gas .
Into one of these brass tubes was cemented a piece of glass tube with a platinum wire fused into it whereby the electric spark was passed to fire the gas .
The tube was placed so that its axis might be in line with the axis of the collimator of a spectroscope , and the flash observed as it travelled along the tube .
It was seen at once that more lines made their appearance in the iron tube than in the glass vessel , and one conspicuous line in the green was identified in position with the E line of the solar spectrum .
Several other lines were identified with lines of iron by comparison with an electric spark between iron electrodes .
There could be no doubt that the flash in an iron tube gave several of the spectral lines of iron .
We supposed that this must be due to particles of oxide shaken off the iron by the explosion , and proceeded to try the effect of introducing various substances in fine powder , and compounds , such as oxalates , which would give fine powders by their decomposition in the heat of the flame .
Several interesting observations were made in this " way .
When some lithium carbonate was introduced , not only were the red , orange , and blue lines of lithium very brilliant , but the green line hardly less so .
After the lithium had once been introduced into the tube , the lithium lines continued to make their appearance even after the tube had been repeatedly washed .
When the lithium had been freshly put in , the red line was observed to be much expanded , very much broader than the line given by lithium in a Bunsen burner reflected into the slit for comparison .
The light was dazzling unless the slit was very narrow ; and it was noticed that if the spark by which the gas was fired was at the distant end of the tube , so that the flame travelled along the tube towards the slit , there was a reversal of the red line ; a fine dark line was plainly visible in the middle of the band .
When the spark was at the end of the tube next the slit , no reversal was , in general , seen .
Later observations showed that some other metallic lines might be reversed in this way , and photographs taken of the reversals .
These observations with the eye on the reversal of the red lithium line were made with a diffraction grating , and were repeated many times .
They show that there are gradations of temperature in the flame , and that the front of the advancing wave of explosion is somewhat cooler than the following part .
The combination of the gases is not so instantaneous that the maximum temperature is reached at once .

473 put into the tube the continuous spectrum was very bright , but the iron lines were still brighter .
No line which could be identified as due to magnesium was observed with certainty ; there was only a doubtful appearance of b. With sodium , potassium , and barium carbonates , only the lines usually seen when salts of those metals are introduced into a flame were noticed ; but eye observations of this kind are extremely trying , on account of the suddenness of the flash and the shortness of its duration .
Thallium gave the usual green line .
Subsequently we had the interior of the tube bored out so as to present a smooth bright surface of iron , and noted the iron lines which were conspicuous in the flash .
For the purpose of identification the pointer in the eye-piece was first placed on one of the strong iron lines given by the electric discharge between iron electrodes , and then , the discharge being stopped but the field sufficiently illuminated , the eye was fixed steadily on the pointer while the gas in the tube was exploded .
In this way it was not difficult to see whether any given line was very bright in the flash .
The lines thus identified were those having the wave-lengths about 5455 , 5446 , 5403 , 5396 , 5371 , 5327 , 5269 ( E ) , 5167 ( \amp ; 4 ) .
These lines were all many times observed in the way described , and as a rule were always present in the flash .
Lines with wave-lengths about 5139 and 4352 were seen , and may possibly have been due to iron , and several more lines were seen occasionally , but were not so regularly seen that they could be well identified .
The lines \4923 and X 4919 were specially looked for , but neither of them could be seen .
A group of blue lines were noticed , and were afterwards identified by photography , a method much less trying than observations by eye .
To give intensity to the photographs ten or twelve flashes were usually taken in succession without any shift of the instrument , so as to accumulate their effects in one photograph .
For identification the spark between iron electrodes was also photographed , but with a shutter over the lower part of the slit , so that the image of the spark should occupy only the upper part of the field .
The following is the list of wave-lengths of the iron lines thus photographed:\#151 ; 4414 7 4131 -5 3920 4404 2 4071 3902 -5 4382 -8 4062 *9 3898 -4 4325 *2 ... .

Above T no line at all is visible in any of the photographs , though the spark lines come out strongly enough , and several of the strongest groups of iron lines , both of spark and arc lines , are in the region beyond T. The spark by which the gas was fired passed in general between a platinum wire and the side of the small brass tube , and was out of view ; but in order to make quite sure that the lines were not due at all to the spark , the brass tube was lined with a tube of platinum foil which projected beyond the brass tube a short distance into the larger tube , and the spark passed between the platinum wire and the platinum tube .
It was found that the same iron lines made their appearance in the flash whichever way the spark was passed .
Other experiments were made with explosions of carbonic oxide and oxygen , and with coal-gas and oxygen .
The explosions of these gases were attended with much more continuous spectrum , and the metallic lines were not always as well developed as they were with hydrogen and oxygen , but on the whole there were as many metallic lines photographed from the flashes of carbonic oxide as from those of hydrogen .
There is an uncertainty about the explosion of the carbonic oxide mixture which we cannot account for , even when we take into account the remarkable effects of relative dryness of the gas on the explosions discovered by Mr. Dixon .
Sometimes the explosions were so violent as to break the plate closing the end of the tube , though this had resisted the explosions of the hydrogen mixture , while at other times the wave of explosion passed slowly along the tube .
The gas was in all cases confined over water and passed directly from the gasholder into the tube .
When the iron tube was lined with copper foil , only one copper lino in the visible spectrum , X. =5104'9 , was seen , and in the ultra- 1884 .

All three lines were very strong , and the two ultra-violet lines were in some cases reversed .
These lines were also frequently developed when no copper lining was in the tube , probably from the brass of the small side tubes .
Copper also gave a line in the indigo , X 4281 about , decidedly less refrangible than the copper line , X 4275 , coincident apparently with the strong edge of one of the bands developed when a copper salt is held in a Bunsen burner .
A lining of copper which had been electro-plated with nickel developed only one nickel line , X 5476 , in the visible part of the spectrum , but gave by photography the following lines in the ultraviolet :\#151 ; 3807 *5 3524 3445 *5 3783 3514*7 3432 3775 3510 3422 ?

It is doubtful whether the line X 3451 be a nickel line .
That at X=3453 is ascribed to cobalt by Cornu , but it seems to be a nickel line as well .
When copper wire electro-plated with cobalt was put into the tube cobalt lines appeared with the approximate wave-lengths :\#151 ; 4L19 3594 3492 ?

It is doubtful whether X 3492 be a cobalt line as well as a Ni line .
No other metal gave anything like the number of lines that were given by iron , nickel , and cobalt .

[ Apr. 3 , A lining of lead gave the lines \ 4058 , 3683*3 and 3639*3 strongly , and these lines were frequently developed , though less strongly , when there was no lead lining ; the metal being without doubt derived from the leaden washers used to make the ends of the tube air-tight .
A strip of silver gave the lines X 3381'5 and 3278 , and these lines were sometimes reversed .
No trace of the channelled spectrum of silver was developed even when silver oxalate was put into the tube , and furnished plenty of silver dust after the first explosion .
A magnesium wire about 2 millims. thick and two-thirds the length of the tube gave the b lines very well ; that is to say and b % were well developed , and b4 was also seen , but as the iron and magnesium components of \amp ; 4 are very close together , and the iron line had been observed before the introduction of the magnesium , it was not possible to say with certainty whether or not the magnesium line were present too .
No other magnesium line could be detected .
The blue flame line was carefully looked for , but could not be seen .
The photographs showed none of the magnesium triplets in the ultra-violet , nor any trace of the strong line X 2852 , which appears in the flame of burning magnesium , and is yet more conspicuous in the arc when that metal is present .
Metallic manganese , introduced into the tube in coarse powder , gave the group at wave-length about 4029 with much intensity , but no other manganese line with cfertainty .
In the visible part of the spectrum the channellings in the green due to the oxide were visible .
A lining of zinc produced no zinc line , and zinc-dust gave only a very doubtful photographic impression of the line X 3342 .
A strip of cadmium gave no line of that metal either in the visible , or in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum .
Tin , aluminium , bismuth , and antimony , also failed to produce a line of any of those substances , and so did mercury which was spread over copper foil made to line the tube .
Thallium spread as amalgam over the copper lining gave the lines X 3775-6 , 3528-3 and 3517*8 .
Chromium was introduced as ammonium bichromate , which of course left the oxide after the first explosion .
This gave the chromium lines with wave-lengths about 5208 , 5205 , 5204 , 4289 , 4274'5 , 4253*5 , very well and persistently , also the lines with wavelengths about 3605 , 3592"5 , 3578*5 .
Sodium salts ( carbonate , chloride ) developed the ultra-violet line X 3301 ; and potassium salts give the pair of lines about wave-length 3445 ; but no more refrangible line of either metal was depicted on the photographs .
Lithium carbonate gave , besides the lines in the red , orange , green , and blue , the violet line , X 4135*5 ; but no more refrangible line .

477 iron wire was burnt , sbow , as might be expected , the same iron lines as are developed in the flash of the detonating gases , and of the same relative intensities .
These intensities are not quite the same relatively as they are in the arc spectrum .
Thus the lines X 3859 , 3745 , 3737 , 3735 , and 3719 come out in great strength , much stronger than the lines X 3647 , 3631 , 3618 , which are remarkably strong in the arc .
German-silver wire , burnt in the flame of coal-gas and oxygen , gave the same nickel lines as were given by nickel in the detonating gases , as well as those of copper and lead .
Copper wire gave , besides the lines X 3272 , 3245*5 , a set of bands in the blue , which correspond with those given by copper salts in flames , and are probably due to the oxide .
The greater part of the lines which we have observed in the flames of the exploding gases have been observed by us to be reversed when the several metals were introduced into the arc in a crucible of lime or magnesia ; which is quite in accord with the supposition that the metals experimented on are volatile , and emit as well as absorb these particular rays , at temperatures lower than that of the arc .
That iron is volatile at a temperature below the fusing point of platinum , which is about 1700 ' C. , has been pointed out by Watts ( " Phil. Mag. , " vol. xlv , p. 86 ) , who observed in the flame of a Bessemer converter almost all the green and blue lines of iron which we have seen in the exploding gases , besides one or two lines which we have not observed or identified .
Having regard to this volatility of iron , it does not seem so surprising that iron lines should be observed accompanying those of hydrogen to great heights in the sun 's atmosphere as that they should not be always seen there .
It is interesting to note that Copeland and Lohse ( " Copernicus , " Dec. 1882 ) observed in the spectrum of the great Comet of 1882 , amongst other lines , four lines , X 5395 , *5369 , 5326 , 5269 , which are nearly identical with iron lines observed in the flash of the detonating gas .
It is remarkable that such volatile metals as mercury , zinc , and cadmium should give no lines in the flame of the exploding gases .
The gases exploded in the tube were generally mixed in nearly the proportions in which they combine chemically ; but experiments were made with oxygen in excess and also with hydrogen and carbonic oxide in excess .
A small excess of any one of the gases did not seem sensibly to affect the result , but on the whole the metallic lines were more certainly developed when there was not much excess of oxygen , and more constantly developed when hydrogen was used than when carbonic oxide was used .
The absence of any metallic lines in the flame of the exploding gases which are more refrangible than T may be in part due to a falling off in the sensibility of the photographic plates for light of 478 Prof. J. B. Haycraft .
On the Action of a [ Apr. 3 , shorter wave-length ; hut as the spark lines of iron seem to be quite as strongly depicted on the plates in regions of the spectrum far above T as they are in the regions below , we think that want of sensitiveness in the plates cannot be the only reason for the absence of higher lines , but that the emissive power of the metals for these lines is feeble at the comparatively low temperature of the flame .
This supposition accords with what we have observed of the lines seen in a carbon tube heated by the electric arc ( " Proc. Camb .
Phil. Soc. , " iv , 263 ) .
The iron lines photographed as reversed against the hot walls of such a tube were at certain stages of temperature the same , speaking generally , as those we have noticed in the flash of the detonating gases ; but as the temperature of the carbon tube rose , more refrangible lines , including all the strong iron lines in the neighbourhood of T , the lines of aluminium near S , and the magnesium line A , 2852 , were reversed in the photographs .
Gouy ( " Comp. R. , " 1877 , p. 232 ) , using a modification of Bunsen 's burner fed with gas mixed with spray of metallic salts , observed at the point of the inner green flame three or four iron lines which we have not observed in the flame of the detonating gas , the lines h- , and of magnesium , two cobalt lines in the blue which we have not seen , one line of zinc , and one of cadmium , and the two strong green rays of silver .
Can the appearance of these rays under these circumstances imply that the temperature of the inner green cone of a Bunsen burner , when the proportion of air to coal-gas is near the exploding point , is higher than that of the explosion of hydrogen and oxygen ?
The interesting theoretical questions which are suggested by the facts recorded in this paper we must leave for future discussion .

The blood flowing from a leech-bite is not readily stopped , often flowing for upwards of an hour after the animal has been removed .
The blood within the body of the creature remains fluid for an indefinite time ; and when ejected it is found to have lost its coagulability .
