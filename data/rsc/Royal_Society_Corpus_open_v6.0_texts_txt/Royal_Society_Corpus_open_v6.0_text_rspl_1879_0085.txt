THE PRESIDENT in the Chair .
The Presents received were laid on the table and thanks ordered for them .
The Right Hon. Thomas George Baring , Lord Northbrook , whose certificate had been suspended as required by the Statutes , was balloted for and elected a Fellow of the Society .
The Bakerian Lecture\#151 ; " On the Photographic Method of Mapping the Least Refrangible End of the Solar Spectrum ( with a Map of the Solar Spectrum from 7600 to*10750 ) " \#151 ; was then delivered by Captain W. DE W. Abney , R.E. , F.R.S. The following is an abstract:\#151 ; The author refers to the sensitiveness of different forms of silver salts when exposed to the action of the spectrum , and shows how he has been able to prepare , by methods indicated , silver bromide which absorbs the red and ultra-red rays , and which is sensitive to these rays .
In his paper he describes the apparatus employed by him in the photography of the invisible least refrangible rays , both with a prismatic , and also with the diffraction apparatus .
From photographs taken with the latter , he has constructed a map extending from X- 7600 to A. 10750 , which he submits to the Society .
He has also compared Lamansky 's prismatic thermograph and that of Sir J. Herschel with his photograph of the prismatic spectrum .
The paper closes with some theoretical remarks on the silver compounds employed .
