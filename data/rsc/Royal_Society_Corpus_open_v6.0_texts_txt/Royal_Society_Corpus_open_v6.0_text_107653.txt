An Account of Experiments made with an Invariable Pendulum at JN'ew South Wales , by Major-General Sir THoMAS BRISBANE , K. C. B. F R. S. Communicated by Captain HENRY KATER , F. R. S. in a Letter to Sir HUMPHaY DAVY , Bart. Pres. R. S. Read June 19 , 1823 .
SmR , IN compliance with the request of Major General Sir THOMAS BRISBANE , I have the honour to lay before the Royal Society the results which I have deduced from his experiments , made with an invariable pendulum at London and at Paramatta .
The pendulum employed belongs to the Board of Longitude , and is of the same construction as that which I used at certain stations of the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain .
Before Sir THOMAS BRISBANE'S departure , I observed the following series of coincidences at Mr. BROWNE'S house in Portland Place , London , in order to determine the number of vibrations made by this pendulum in twenty-four hours .
From the preceding observations we have the following results .

,8o , if the specific gravity of the pendulum be taken at 8 , the correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere will be 6,45 .
Adding this to the mean number of vibrations before found , we obtain 86090,17 for the number of vibrations which would be made in a mean solar day at the temperature of 60o , and in a vacuum .
The corrections applied for temperature are calculated on the supposition of the expansion of this pendulum being the same as that of the one before alluded to , which , as both are constructed of plate brass , will probably not occasion any sensible error .
On the completion of the preceding observations , the following were made by Sir THOMAS BRISBANE , and Mr. RUMKER .

In addition to the experiments already given , Sir THOMAS BRISBANE has forwarded another series made at Paramatta with the same pendulum , by Mr. DUNLOP , a gentleman of whose zeal and scientific abilities Sir THOMAS BRISBANE expresses himself in the highest terms .

, and in a vacuum .
The height of the station at Paramatta , above mean high water , is stated by Sir T. BRISBANE to be seventy-seven feet , and that of the station at London being eighty-three feet above low water , it could only introduce error to attempt any correction for a difference which has not yet been accurately ascertained .
If the number of vibrations resulting from Sir THOMAS BRISBANE'S experiments at Paramatta be compared with the mean number of vibrations made by the pendulum at London , we shall have 39 , o7696 inches for the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds at Paramatta ; ,005 2704 for the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator ; and for the 295,84 Sir THOMAS BRISBANE'S resulting compression ; the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds at London being taken at 39,13929 inches .
The experiments at Paramatta being compared with those made by me at Unst , in latitude 60 ? ?
45 ' 28 " north , give,0053605 for the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator , and -L for the resulting compression .
303,95 If Mr. DUNLOP'S experiments at Paramatta be compared with those made at London , we obtain 39,07751 for the length of the seconds pendulum at Paramatta , ,oo052238 for the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator , and Z'for the compression .
Or , comparing Mro DUNLOP'S 291,83 experiments with those made at Unst , we have,0053292 for the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator , and 30 for the resulting compression .
301$09 The compressions here deduced must not as yet be deemed conclusive , for it is well known that a very small alteration in the number of vibrations made by the pendulum would occasion a considerable difference in the fraction indicating the compression .
The indefatigable zeal of Sir THOMAS BRISBANE , will , however , no doubt soon furnish additional data .
I have the honour to be , My dear Sir , very sincerely yours , HENRY KATER .
London , June , 1823 .
P. S. I may here take the opportunity of correcting an error in the " Account of Experiments for determining the variation in the length of the Pendulum vibrating seconds at the principal stations of the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain .
" In the first series of observations made with the repeating circle for the latitude of Clifton , 1 ' 41",6 has been applied as the correction for the level instead of 141l",6 -2 ' 21 " , 6 .
The resulting latitude , when the proper correction is made is 53 ? ?
27 ' 44 " , 94 instead of 53 ? ?
27 ' 40 " , , and the greatest difference between the five independent latitudes of Clifton 3",48 instead of 5",24 .
