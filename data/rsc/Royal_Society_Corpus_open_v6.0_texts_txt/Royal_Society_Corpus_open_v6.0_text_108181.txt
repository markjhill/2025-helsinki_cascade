THE principle on which the instrument I am about to describe is constructed , is , that the volume of a given quantity of air under a constant tetmperature , is inversely as the pressure to which it is su !
jected ; and the means I ernploy to estimate the change of volume which that quantity of air undergoes , by being subjected to differences of pressure caused by a change of elevation , are the determination of the difference of weight which a floating body is capable of sustaining in both situations .
Thus , if a vessel containing a quantity of air and water be floated in water , and there be a conminunication between the water in the floatinc body and that in which it floats , it will follow , that when such an apparatus is subjected to diminished pressure , the air within the float will dilate , and cause a volume of water equal in atnount to the dilatation of the air to be driven from the float ; and the difference of weight which the floating body will sustain , will be the exact weight of the water expelled : if such an apparatus is subjected to an increased pressure , the air within it will contract , and consequently a quantity of water , from that in which it floats , will enter the float , and the dlitinished weight it is capable of sustaining will be the weight of the water which has entered the float , in consequence of the diminution of the volume of the air .
It is by such means , with the instrument immediately to be described , and by the help of a very simple calculation , that I propose to determine the difference of level between any two places .
Plate X. fig. 1 .
represents the floating part , made of thin sheet brass , the body of which ( a ) , in form the frustum of a cone , is nine inches long , two inches in diameter at one end , and one inch at the other , and capable of containing about fourteen cubic inches .
In the centre of the widest end , a small stud of brass ( b ) is hard soldered , into which a brass wire ( c ) is screwed , at inch and three-eighths long , and about one twenty-fifth or one thirtiethl of an inch in diameter : the other end of the wire is screwed into a brass stud in the middle of the convex side of a shallow cup ( d ) , made also of brass , and as light as possible , so that it will retain its shape , and be capable of sustaining a weight of about eight hundred or one thousand grains .
At the lower and smaller end , a projecting rim ( e ) of brass is soldered , for the purpose of pouring out a portion of water from the interior with less risk of spilling ; and into this end is screwed a brass plugf , which is required to be made of sufficient weight to sink the instrument in water with one hundred or one hundred and twenty grain'S 3 i2 in the cup at the upper part , when it contains ten cubic inches of air .
To the middle of the brass wire I affix a very small quantity of red sealing-wax ( g ) , melted on it at that part , to serve as an index .
Thirough the centre of the brass plug , a small hole ( h ) , about the same diameter as the wire , is to be drilled , which forms a communication between the water in the inside of the float and that in which it floats .
The reason I prefer the form of an inverted frustum of an acute cone is , that the greatest portion of the weight being considerably below the centre of gravity , causes the instrument to float with greater stability , and also enables it to carry more weight in the cup , without inclining to either side .
Fig. 2 .
is a representation of another part of the instrument , which serves as the case for containing the float , without any chance of its becoming injured , and at the same time retains the quantity of water necessary to render it buoyant .
It consists of an inner vessel ( i ) made of thin sheet copper , nearly of the same form as the float , but somewhlat larger in all its dimensions , being two inches and three quarters in diameter at top , one inch and three quarters at bottom , and eleven inches and a half deep ; this is surrounded by a cylindrical case ( k ) of tin plate , three inches in diameter , and fourteen inches long .
About three inches friomi the upper part of the outer case , are four holes ( 1 ) three quarters of an inch in diameter , having small hoods ( m ) of tin plate soldered over them , to preveint in a great measure the wind from blowing into them .
The inner copper vessel is secured to the outer cylinder of tin plate by soft solder ; and both are firmly soft soldered , water-tight , to a thick circular plate of brass ( n ) , in which a circular hole ( o ) is turned , a little more than two inches in diameter , for the purpose of readily allowing the float to pass through it .
In the inner edge of this circular hole a femtale screw is cut , in order that it tnmay be closed either by a screw plug , or by the bottom of the brass box ( p ) , which serves to carry the requtisite graint weights .
Across the top passes a piece of thick iron or brass wire ( q ) , bent into the form of a loop , answering the purpose of a hlandle for carriage , or for suspecnding it .
Fig. 3 .
represents the elevation and plan of a smtall spirit lamp ( r ) , requisite , when an observation is to be made , to bring the water and the float with the watelr and air it contains always to the same temperature .
Thie lamp is fixed by means of three wires ( sss ) into the middle of a rim of tin plate ( t ) rather smaller in diameter than the outer cylinder , and consequently allowing it easily to slip in , and there to be secured by three small studs with bayonet-joints .
An open space or interval is left between the lamp and outer rim for the free admission of air necessary for the comtibustion of the spirit , three small balls ( v ) serving as feet , upon which the instrumtent rests , so as to admit sufficient air beneath .
Fig. 5 .
represents a vessel of copper or tin plate , capable of containing 2525 grains of distlled o rain water , having , at its open extrenmity , a piece of strong glass tube cemented , upon which a mark ( w ) is to be made with a file or diamond , at the place occupied by the surface of the water when it contains the above quantity , at the temperature of 62 ?
FAHR. The mode of adjusting the instrument I have next to describe ; it is as follows : HYDROPNEUMiATIC BAROSCOPE .
having unscrewed the plug h ( fig. 1 .
) , the float is first to be filled with rain or distilled water , and then as much water is to be poulred out as will fill the measure ( fig. 5 .
) to the mark on the glass tube : ten cubic inches of water having been thus abstracted from the float , the same volume of air will supply its place .
If this opeiration be carefully performed , the same qulantity of air within two or three hundredths of a cubic inch will always be admitted , which ilmay be proved by the instrumtents sustaining nearly the same weight in the cup : the plug may then be screwed into its place .
The next step of the operation is to fill the inner conical vessel ( fig. 2 .
) with rain or distilled water , and to bring it , by means of the latmp , to the temperature at which it is determined that all the observations are to be made .
Presuming that the instrument will be principally employed , for the purposes intended , in the summer season , I would recommend the adjustment and all observations to be made at the temperature of 75 ?
or 80 ?
FAHR. The float is next to be placed with its smaller extremity uppermost into the warmed water , that the air and water which it contains may acquire the desired temperature .
I may here remark that a thermometer capable of showing at least a quarter of a degree on FAHRENHEIT'S scale ought to accompany theI instrument un(ler all circumstances , when experiments and observations are to be made .
As soon as the float and its contents have acquired the requisite heat , ( which may take from four to five minutes ) the finger is to be placed over the small hole in the plug ; tt , en quickly withdrawing the float and replacing it inverted in the same vessel , it is adjusted for use .
In order to find the altitude by the weights to be applied in the cup , which may be consideted as its scale , a long series of experiments has been made , of which the following is an abstract .
The float , after being adjusted as above described , was placed in a cylindrical glass vessel containing water at 750 FAHIR .
, the laboratory being kept at the same temperature during the time occupied by the experiments , which wa generally from an hour to an hour and a half ; and weights weary then added to the cup , till the instruinent was adjusted so that the index on the middle of the wire was coincident with the surface of the water .
One hundred grains were then put into the cup , which caused the instrument to sink to the bottom of the glass vessel ; and no more water was allowed to be in the glass , when the instrument had so sunk , than would stand a quarter of an inch above the mark on the wire .
The cylindrical glass vessel was then placed on the plate of an air pump , and a barometer capable of reading to the , rth of an inch , having a cistern four inches diameter , attached to the smaller plate .
The barometer was first read off and noted ; a receiver was then placed over the vessel with the float , and exhaustion slowly made , until the float gradually rose from the bottom of the glass vessel , and the index on the stem coincided with the surIface of the water .
The barometer was then again read off and noted .
A small portion of air being now let into the pump by the screw for that purpose , the float immediately sunk to the bottom .
The screw , which allowed the admission of air , being made tight , the operation was repeated ; and this was done a third time if the observations of the baro- , 427 meter differed more than two or three thousandths of an inch : a mean of the three readings was taken for the correct one .
The air was now admitted into the pump , and the receiver removed , when the barometer rose to its original elevation , unless any change of atmospheric pressure had occurred during the interval , which was seldom the case ; but when it did happen , a mean of the two was taken .
The same operation was gone through with 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , and 700 grains , the last weight being about as much as the instrument would steadily carr y on the cup witihout showing a tendency to overbalance .
Care was taken to remove from the glass vessel an equivalent portion of water on the addition of each 100 grains , otherwise it would have risen so high in the glass as to come in contact with the bottom of the brass cup , and thereby have frustrated the experiment .
Having given a general description of the instrument and mode of adjustment , I may now refer to fig. 6 , which represents the apparatus in use , and which shows the difference of the level of the water in the interior of the float , and that which is exterior to it .
Although the instrument contains ten cubic inches of air when subjected only to the atmospheric pressure , it will coutain somewhat less than that quantity , by being pressed upon by a column of water , equal to the difference of the two levels , which is about five or six inches .
The following Table exhiibits a series of experiments made with thie air-piump , and the altitudes deduced from the barometrical depressions , calculated according to the formula and tables of Mr. BAILEY .

In the same manner the coefficients A , B have likewise been determiined from the other sets of observations ( p ) , ( y ) , ( e ) , ( i ) , and the following are the results obtained , From the set ( a ) 1085-27 -13'533 ( 3 ) 1093'39 -15-207 ( y ) 1086-22 -14110 ( 1 ) 1065-35 -14'240 ( E ) 1080'77 -12-190 Means. .

I 429 As an example of the application of the instrument to the determination of the height of one station above another , we will suppose that , having adjusted the instrument in the manner already described , it is found that 118 grains are required to be placed in the cup , in order to sink the float so that the index on the stern shall coincide with the surface of the water , when its temperature is 75 ?
FAHR. I-laving noted these particulars , returned the weights into the box , and screwed it into its place , we then proceed to the other station , the altitude of which is greater .
Here the water is first brought , by means of the lamp , to the same temperature , 750 , and then weights are put into the cup , until the instrument floats at the same mark ; and we will suppose it requires 274 grains to effect this : then 274 -118 In Table I. 150 gives In Table II .
6 gives which multiplied by .
gives 156 grains , the difference of weights supported. .
10594 8 10'586 156 63'516 52930 10586 1651'416 feet for the difference of altitude between the two stations .
As another example , suppose that at the first station it requires 112 grains to sink the instrument to the mark , the temperature being as before 750 , and we then descend into a mine where it req uires , at the same temperature , only 48 grains to bring it to the same position ' then 48 112 64 grains , the difference of weights supported this is minus , because the weight at the second station is less than at the first .
In Table I. 60 gives 10-873 In Table II .
4 gives +5 10-878 which multiplied by ... 64 43512 65268 gives ... ... ... ... 696,192 feet for the depression of the second station below the first , As a last example , I will give the following , which will in some degree serve to show the application of the instrument to the measurement of comparatively small quantities , and the amount of reliance that may be placed on the observations made with it and also on the formula .
From the ground floor to the attics of my house it requires as nearly as possible three grains to be added to the cup to balance the instrument .
If we now take from Table I. the number answering to 0 ... ... 10'793 an(l subtract from it the number answering to 3 in Table II ... . .
4 10'789 multiply by the difference of weights ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 the product gives the height ... ... ... ... ... ... .2 ... ... = 32*367 feet whereas by actual measurement it is 31 feet .
The delicacy and sensibility of the instluruent are , however , such , that if it be very nicely adjusted to a tenth of a grain , it will readily show a difference of elevation of three or four feet .
