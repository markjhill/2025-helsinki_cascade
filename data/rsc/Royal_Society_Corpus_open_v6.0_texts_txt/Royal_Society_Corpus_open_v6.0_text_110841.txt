SIR J. W. LUBBOCK , Bart. , V.P. , in the Chair .
Some further Observations and Experiments illustrative of the Cause of the Ascent and continued Motion of the Sap , " in continuation of a Paper presented to the Royal Society in November 1842 .
By G. Rainey , Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. The author here gives an account of some experiments which he has lately made , tending , in his opinion , to corroborate the opinions he advanced in his former paper ; namely , that the ascending sap is situated in the intercellular and intervascular spaces of the plant , and that its passage into the cells is effected by the action of endosmose , which the intervening membranes , whether living , or deprived of vitality , exert upon that fluid .
He found that portions of many plants , such as Anthriscus vulgaris , and the Lapsana communis , absorb a much larger quantity of fluid when they are immersed in pure water , than when similarly immersed in a solution of gum-arabic ; and that , in the latter case , the remaining portion of the solution is of the same specific gravity as before any part has been absorbed by the plant .
By a similar process , the author conceives , the fluid which is derived from the earth , and has passed into the intercellular spaces of the cotyledons , are imbibed by its cells by endosmose ; while at the same time a fluid containing sugar is passing , by exosmose , out of these cells into the intercellular and intervascular tissue , and thence into the corresponding tissue of the peduncle and young stem ; it there meets with , and is diluted by the water ascending in the same tissue from the roots , and the mixture is afterwards distributed over every part of the plant .
