In connection with an investigation of electrical effects of light upon the retina , * I have examined vegetable protoplasm ( green leaves)* with reference to electrical effects that might be expected to occur in connection with the chemical changes produced by light .
Under certain favourable conditions that I hope to determine-further , a true electrical response to light is obtained , consisting in the establishment of a potential difference between illuminated and non-illuminated half of a leaf , amounting to 002 volt .
Among ordinary garden leaves , I have found to be well adapted to demonstration those of young Iris plants , about 6 inches high , and of " ten-week Stocks " in active growth .
The former , tested by Sachs method , exhibited no evidence of starch activity in consequence of insolation ; the latter in favourable instances exhibited marked deposit limited to illuminated parts .
Leaves of Tropseolum , of Begonia , and of Nicotiana have also proved to be suitable objects of study .
Most of the following description refers to young Iris leaves in the ; first half of the month of May .
The method of observation is as follows:\#151 ; Fig. 1.\#151 ; Normal Response to Light .
Iris leaf .
Primary " negative " effect during illumination .
A freshly cut but otherwise uninjured leaf is laid upon a glass plate and connected with a recording galvanometer by means of two unpolaris-ablef electrodes A and B. One half of the leaf is shaded by a piece * ' Proc. Roy .

Illumination of a chloride of silver electrode by a " 16-C.P .
" lamp at 10 cm .
distance gave a reaction amounting to between 0*002 and 0-003 volt .
A zinc electrode under similar conditions gave a reaction , of about 0-0001 volt , in which , however , I did not attempt to distinguish separate effects of light and heat .

Leaf and electrodes are enclosed in a box , provided with a shuttered aperture , through which light can be directed .
A water trough in the path of light serves to cut out more or less heat .
A glass jar inverted over the leaf and electrodes forms a moist chamber to delay drying .
During illumination the galvanometer spot is deflected so as to indicate current in the leaf itself from excited part to protected part , i.e. , if B is shaded , light falling upon A arouses current in the leaf from A to B ; if A is shaded , light falling upon B arouses current from B to A. 1 .
The deflection begins and ends sharply with the beginning and end of illumination .
2 .
It is provoked slightly by diffuse daylight , more considerably by an electrical arc light , and in greatest degree by bright sunlight .
3 .
It is abolished by boiling the leaf and by the action of anaesthetics .
These are the main facts proving that the living leaf responds electrically to the stimulus of light .
At this preliminary stage two points of doubt occur to mind and require to be tested , viz. , possible effects of heat and of surface evaporation that necessarily accompany illumination .
These effects are small in comparison with the true response , and of opposite sign .
Illumination of a dead leaf gives little or no effect , and what little effect there is , is directed in the leaf towards the illuminated half , where heating and evaporation are provoked .
The true response to light varies with varying physiological states !
of the leaf and of its parent plant .
Not every leaf gives response , nor is the response of equal magni-l tude in different leaves to luminous stimulation ( arc light ) of coni stant intensity and duration .
The external condition by which the state of leaf is most obviously ; governed is temperature .
My first experiments were made upon Iris leaves taken almost at random from young plants ( old roots ) about 6 inches high at the end of March ( temperature not noted , but presumably below 15 ' ) .
The response to light was between 0*001 and 0'002 volt .
The next set of experiments commenced on May 8th on young leaves of similar plants .
The responses then observed were 0-005 0-008 , 0-025 0-005 nil nil The Electrical Effects of Light upon Green Leaves .
131 I thereafter took note of the external temperature , and tested the leaves in a warm box with satisfactory results .
A few days later ( May 21st ) , Iris leaves even in the warm box were notably inert .
Two leaves were tested with negative results , a third leaf gave a response of 0-008 volt , but its resistance was obstinately high ( nearly 3 megohms ) , a fourth leaf gave a response of O004 volt ( plates 1770 and 1771 ) .
On May 23rd I was unable to find a satisfactory leaf ; most of the plants were fully grown and in flower .
I therefore abandoned Iris and sought for other satisfactory leaves , in which it might be possible to obtain evident differences of reaction in correlation with evident differences of state .
To sum up the effect of temperature upon the response of Iris\#151 ; the normal response at 15 ' to 20 ' is diminished or abolished at low temperature ( 10 ' ) , augmented at high temperature ( 30 ' ) , diminished at higher temperature ( 50 ' ) , and abolished by boiling .

Time of day.\#151 ; Leaves of Iris appear to give more marked response at or about mid-day , than at or about 6 P.M. Young leaves of young plants act well .
Old leaves of old plants do not act at all .
The older leaves of young plants act better than the younger leaves of old plants .

Other plants.\#151 ; Leaves of Tropaeolum and of Mathiola , as far as I have yet seen , give a response to light , that is in the main the contrary of the ordinary Iris response , viz. , " positive " during illumination , and subsequently " negative."* I hour Fig. 4.\#151 ; Series of Normal Responses of Mathiola annua ( " positive " during illumination , subsequently " negative .
" ) ( 1793 .
) Leaves of Nicotiana reacted like Iris .
Leaves of Begonia have given a variety of responses strongly suggestive of the simultaneous action of two opposed forces effecting a , resultant deflection in a + or - direction .
As regards Mathiola and Tropaeolum , leaves empty of starch have acted better than leaves laden with starch .
Leaves of Ulva gave no distinct response ( only one series of trials ) .
Leaves of ordinary garden shrubs and trees , \amp ; c. Lilac , Pear , Almond , Mulberry , Vine , Ivy ) , and petals of flowers , gave no distinct response .
Anesthetics.\#151 ; I was able to make only three satisfactory experiments with Iris leaves , before the supply of available material had come to an end.f The first was made upon a vigorous young leaf on May 15th , the test ( five minutes ' illumination ) being made at intervals of rather more than half an hour , with the following result:\#151 ; * " Negative " as the term is employed in physiological literature , negative-pole of positive element ( " zincative " ) .
t Note added July 16th.\#151 ; I have made further trial of anaesthetics during the past month upon leaves of Begonia .
The effect was perfectly clear , but slow\#151 ; viz.y temporary abolition of response by ether vapour , permanent abolition by chloroform vapour , augmentation by " little " C02 , temporary suppression by " much " C02 .
I think it possible that the refractory behaviour of the Iris leaf mentioned in the text may have been due to a primary effect of the ana3sthetic upon stomatal guard-cells .

Nature of the Normal It espouse ( Leaves ) .
Direction.\#151 ; The accidental or " normal " leaf currents observed when the electrodes are first applied to a leaf are of no significance , as regards the response to light .
Such " normal " current may be due to accidental injury or to physiological inequality or to unequal imbibition of contacts , and necessarily includes the small amount of current that may arise from the unpolarisable electrodes .
It may be positive negative , or non-existent .
The regular and normal response to light is independent of such VOL. LXVII .

accidental currents , provided they he not due to excessive physiological differences .
The immediate effect of light is to arouse current in the half-shaded leaf , directed from the illuminated to the shaded half in the galvanometer from shaded to illuminated ; from resting to active tissue , as in muscle and nerve ) .
With illumination of moderate duration , i.e. , not exceeding a few minutes , this first effect lasts as long as its cause , rising towards a maximum .
With longer illumination , a maximum is reached from which the effect begins to decline .
The current drops to or beyond zero , giving place to the reversed current , which is the regular aftereffect of illumination .
At the end of an illumination of moderate duration , the current rapidly subsides and gives place to a reversed current directed in the-leaf towards the previously illuminated half .
This effect and after-effect of illumination are similar in appearance to the effect and after-effect in nerve produced by tetanisation , extending , however , over longer periods of time ( figs. and 2b ) .
Magnitude.\#151 ; The electromotive force of the response has a value that usually ranges from 0-005 to 0'020 volt .
The leaf resistance ( interpolar distance = 5 cm .
, and breadth = about 1 cm .
) is generally between 500,000 and 1,000,000 ohms .
The current deflection with these values is between 5 and 40 cm , of scale , with a possible accidental effect of \#177 ; 1 cm.* ^secs.s ii 11 m 11111 MII I I I I I I II I II I M I I I I I I 1 I M I I II I I I I I I I I I II Fig. 5.\#151 ; Interval of Time between Illumination L and Besponse B , of a vigorous Leaf of Iris .

137 latency .\#151 ; The effects and after-effects occur very sharply at beginning and end of strong illumination of moderate duration .
The latent period is between 3 and 10 sec. Fatigue and Recovery.\#151 ; The effects of successive illuminations ( of 5 minutes ' duration ) progressively diminish if repeated at " short " intervals ( 10 minutes ) .
At intervals of about 1 hour , successive illuminations of 5 minutes produce approximately equal effects .
With the leaf of Mathiola , I have used periods of illumination of 2 minutes at intervals of 15 minutes without provoking any obvious sign of fatigue .
Conclusions.\#151 ; The leaves of certain plants under favourable conditions of life exhibit electromotive effects and after-effects , amounting to \#177 ; 0-02 volt in response to illumination .
As in the case of animal tissue , it is possible that the negative ( zincative ) effect may be significant of dissimilation , and the opposite effect or after-effect significant of assimilation .
The absence of distinct response in petals indicates that chloroplasts are essential to the reaction .
The absence of distinct response in the green leaves of trees and shrubs is possibly due to a lower average metabolism in such leaves , as compared with the activity of leaves of small young plants , in which leaf-functions are presumably concentrated within a smaller area .

A former paper* describes the apparatus by which I examined the influence of temperature upon the viscosity of argon and other gases .
I have recently had the opportunity of testing , in the same way , an interesting sample of gas prepared by Professor Dewar , being the residue , uncondensed by liquid hydrogen , from a large quantity collected at the Bath springs .
As was to be expected , !
it consists mainly of helium , as is evidenced by its spectrum when rendered luminous in a vacuum tube .
