) The present investigation is an outcome of previous work , * resulting in the discovery that the optimum temperature of any ferment , or ferment function , occurring in a given enzymic preparation , is independent of the concentration both of the substrate and of the enzyme , the duration of the action being constant .
To follow up this observation it was felt desirable to investigate in a similar way the influence , if any , of the reaction , that is of the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium , on the optimum temperature of enzyme action : the more so because enzymes , as regards their activity , are known to be extremely sensitive to this factor\#151 ; some requiring an acid , others a neutral , and others again an alkaline medium in which to act .
The question , moreover , is of special interest on account of the fact that Sorensen , in his classical researches on the rdle of the ionic concentration of the medium in activating enzymes , alludes to it , and predicts in regard to it that , when investigated , the optimum temperature will no doubt be found to vary with the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium.f That * Arthur Compton , ' Roy .

Concentration upon the Optimum Temperature of a Ferment .
409 opinion , being of a speculative nature , was not deemed a sufficient answer to the question ; its experimental investigation therefore became the more needed .
The enzyme chosen was the maltose of Aspergillus oryzce , the same preparation being used as had already been studied in a former communication , * where its optimum temperature , in an action of 16 hours ' duration , and H+ concentration that of the preparation simply dissolved in redistilled water , is shown to be + 47 ' .
Two stages occur in the investigation : ( 1 ) A determination of the optimum reaction curve of the enzyme in an action of 16 hours ' duration at +47 ' , for chosen dilutions of substrate and of enzyme , in presence of progressively increasing quantities of acid and of alkali added to the reaction mixture ; ( 2 ) separate determinations of the optimum temperature of the ferment under the same conditions of substrate concentration , of enzyme concentration , and of duration of the experiment , for different hydrogen ion concentrations of the medium , corresponding to various points on the above optimum reaction curve .
The substrate concentration chosen was M/ 20 , or 18 x 10~3 grm. of hydrated maltose per cubic centimetre of the reaction mixture ; and the enzyme concentration was 6 x 10~4 grm. of the enzyme preparation in powder per cubic centimetre of the reaction mixture .
For the determination of the optimum reaction curve the practical details were as follows :\#151 ; First , a solution of the enzyme was prepared by dissolving 30 mgrm .
of the preparation in 10 cm.3 of redistilled water .
A clear pale amber-coloured solution resulted , which , after standing from a half to one hour at the ordinary temperature , was introduced in portions of 1 cm.3 into a series of eight clean test-tubes ( Fischer 's extra resistance glass ) already containing 90 mgrm .
of hydrated maltose and either 4 cm.3 of pure water or a solution containing a known quantity of acid or alkali .
The tubes , after closing with clean sterile corks , were plunged into a water bath regulated at +47 ' .
After 16 hours ' incubation they were withdrawn , the corks removed , and each rapidly washed with 1 cm.3 of water\#151 ; the washings being carefully added to the contents of the corresponding tube .
Next , the tubes were heated for seven minutes in boiling water to stop the enzyme action , after which they were cooled and the contents diluted to 50 cm.3 .
The proportion of maltose hydrolysed was then determined , by Bertrand 's method , f on 20 cm.3 of the diluted mixture .
The numbers obtained are set out in Table I. * Ibid. t 'Bull .

The curves are summarised for purposes of description in two figures ( figs. 2 and 3 ) .
In fig. 2 are collected the curves corresponding to H+ concentrations greater than the optimum reaction of fig. 1 ; while in fig. 3 are collected the curves corresponding to H+ concentrations equal to , and less than , the optimum of fig. 1 .
Consider fig. 2 .
Here we have a series of curves of varying altitudes , which is what one would expect from the results already recorded in fig. 1 ; as the H+ concentration of the medium is increased beyond the optimum value the enzyme is gradually rendered less efficient .
And , in this respect , fig. 2 indicates , further , that the diminution in the activity is true for Concentration upon the Optimum , Temperature of a .
413 practically all temperatures , although varying in amount from temperature to temperature , subject to the influence\#151 ; to be explained presently\#151 ; of the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium .
As to the influence , if any , of the H+ concentration of the medium on the optimum temperature of the enzyme , fig. 2 clearly shows that for each H+ concentration there exists a perfectly^ definite optimum temperature ; also , the optimum temperature is seen to fall progressively as the H+ concentration is increased beyond the optimum reaction of fig. 1 .
In fact , the locus ^concentrations varying between 10 ^ \#163 ; io 5 6 of the maxima of these curves is a straight line , the mathematical equation of which is approximately y = fi-56#\#151 ; 20044 .
The significance of this straight line is that it shows that the fall which occurs in the optimum temperature of the ferment as the H+ concentration is increased\#151 ; beyond its optimum value\#151 ; is proportional to the fall in activity ( or disablement ) which the ferment undergoes at the physical optimum point .
Fig. 2 further shows that the temperature of destruction of the enzyme also depends on the hydrogen ion concentration .of the medium ; the greater 2 k 2 414 Dr. A. Compton .
The Influence of the Hydrogen the acidity the less heat is the enzyme able to support before being entirely disabled .
Herein lies the explanation of the existence of the two lower curves of fig. 2 , in spite of the indications of fig. 1 , which shows that for the H+ concentrations of 10-3-2 and 10\#151 ; 3-0 no activity on the part of the enzyme seems possible .
The reason is , that what was the optimum temperature for the natural reaction , +47'\#151 ; at which temperature the results set forth in fig. 1 were determined\#151 ; is no longer the optimum temperature for the H+ concentrations giving rise to the curves in question , but is instead a temperature of destruction .
Temperature H+concentrations varying between io6:2^io7^ That the optimum temperature of the ferment diminishes as the H+ concentration is increased beyond that of the chemical optimum may be stated otherwise thus : As the H+ concentration is diminished from extreme values to values bordering on that of the chemical optimum , the optimum temperature steadily increases .
An interesting question now arises .
What would be the effect on the optimum temperature of diminishing the H+ concentration beyond that of the chemical optimum ?
Would the optimum temperature under these circumstances continue to increase , in view of the fact that further diminution of the H+ conConcentration upon the Optimum Temperate ur of a Ferment .

Fig. 3 answers these questions .
Fig. 3 , as expected , also shows a series of curves of varying altitudes ; and , as before , a perfectly definite optimum temperature is seen to characterise each hydrogen ion concentration studied .
But here an unlooked-for result is discerned .
For H+ concentrations situated between the optimum and the natural reaction the optimum temperature rises still higher , to fall again as the natural reaction is overreached ; the rise in the optimum temperature passes by an optimum value .
This is evident from the locus curve drawn through the maxima of the several optimum temperature curves figured in fig. 3 ; and it is still better seen in fig. 4 , where a curve is plotted with the various optimum temperatures recorded in figs. 2 and 3 as ordinates , and the corresponding amounts of acid and alkali present in the reaction mixture as abscissae .

01 CM* per reaction mixture An optimum temperature of +49 ' thus seems possible in a reaction mixture containing 0-032 cm.3 M/ 100 HaS04 .
But it might be supposed that this is the optimum reaction of the ferment for that temperature , since , in accordance with the work of O'Sullivan and Tompson* on the enzyme sucrase , the optimum reaction of that ferment is known to depend on the temperature serving for its determiiiation ?
This question it is proposed to investigate .
To illustrate in a striking way the essential fact established by the investigation , that the optimum temperature of the enzyme depends largely on the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium , it is only necessary to reproduce side by side on the same diagram the optimum temperature curve from fig. 3 corresponding to the natural reaction and that from fig. 2 * 'Chem .

The Influence of the Hydrogen corresponding to the addition to the reaction mixture of 0-2 cm.3 M/ 100 H2S04 per milligramme of enzyme .
This is done in fig. 5 .
Temperature Fig. 5 shows at a glance that by the simple process of increasing the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium in which the enzyme acts from 10~7-2 to 10-3 it is possible to change the optimum temperature of the ferment from +47 ' to + 35'5 ' , \#151 ; i.e. through a range of 1T5 ' .
This result alone shows how important it is , when stating the optimum temperature of an enzyme , to point out at the same time the H+ concentration of the medium serving to determine it .
Thus , the optimum temperature of the maltase in question , in an action of 16 hours ' duration , may be expressed as [ 35-5 ' ] io~3,0 or [ 47 ' ] Fig. 5 is further interesting from another aspect .
The parallelism or similarity of the two curves is very striking ; they are almost superposable .
Were they exactly so , and obviously that is only a question of sufficient experimental patience , it would mean that the activity of the enzyme is the same at corresponding temperatures over two equal although different ranges of temperature , \#151 ; the one curve being in that case simply a translation in the plane of the paper of the other .
It is proposed to term this , the phenomenon of corresponding states .
From a consideration of the locus lines of figs. 2 and 3 , it is evident that for H+ concentrations such that the maxima of the resulting optimum temperature curves are situated at the same level on these lines , the enzyme should for the one and the other H+ concentration be in " corresponding states .
" The main conclusion of the present paper , in the insight which it affords into the influence of the H+ concentration of the medium on the physical optimum of enzyme action , cannot perhaps be summarised to more advantage at present than by placing it in its appropriate place in a differential table briefly setting out our present knowledge of the relation of the physical and the chemical optima of enzyme action to the experimental conditions involved in determining them .
