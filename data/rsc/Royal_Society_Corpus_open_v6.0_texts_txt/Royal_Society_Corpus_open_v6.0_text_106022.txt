The Bill of Mortality of the Town of Warrington , for the year 1773 .
By the Rev. J. Aikin .
Communicated by Dr. Percival .
THE town of WARRINGTON , by the best account yet procured , contains between 1600 and 1700 houses .
At five persons to a house , which is supposed a sufficient allowance , as but few are occupied by more than one family , this will give somewhat above 8000 for the number of inhabitants .
The average of yearly marriages , christenings , and burials , registered in the parish church , from 1750 to 1769 inclusive , is , Marriages .
Christenings .
Burials .
73 237 199 That for the years 1770 , 1771 , 1772 , is , 95 331 258 Red , May 19 , 1774 .
This will serve to show the increase of the place , and its comparative healthiness ; especially if we consider that the deaths are much more exactly registered than the births .
In the present bill , the number of children , who died after receiving only private baptism , in consequence of which their deaths were registered , but not their births , amounts to 17 ; which might therefore be added to the average of christenings for the three last years , and will form an extraordinary instance of healthiness and increase .
The present bill also takes in the separate registers kept by different societies , in which the births much exceed the burials , as many of the latter are entered at the parish church .
The melancholy overbalance of burials , which now appears , plainly arises from the dreadful ravages , of a single disease , the small-pox ; which perhaps has seldom raged with greater malignity than in its late visitation of this town .
Its victims were chiefly young children ; whom it attacked with such instant fury , that the best-directed means for relief were of little avail .
The state of the air went through all possible variations in the course of it , but with no perceptible difference in the state of the disease .
In general , the sick were kept sufficiently cool , and were properly supplied with diluting and acidulous drinks ; yet where they recovered it seemed rather owing to a less degree of malignity in the disease , or greater strength to struggle with it , than any peculiar management .
Where it ended fatally , it was usually before the pustules came to maturation ; and indeed in many they showed no disposition to advance after the complete eruption , but remained quite flat and pale .
The gradual progress and decline of the disease will appear from the Table of Months .
Its proportional virulence began to abate considerably before it ceased .
I cannot with certainty lay down the general proportion of deaths ; but in one neighbourhood bourhood I found that out of 29 who had the disease , 12 died , or about 2 in 5 ; in others the mortality was still greater , and I have reason to believe it was not less on the whole .
It may perhaps be worthy of observation that the proportion of females who died , to males , was nearly as three to two .
While we lament the severity of the scourge with which we have been afflicted , we cannot but highly regret , that a practice , which experience has established as so effectual a security against it , was so little followed .
Not ten , I believe , were inoculated in the whole town and neighbourhood : these all did well , yet their example was not sufficient to overcome some accidental prejudices taken against it .
Indeed , the poor , who were the chief sufferers in this calamity , besides these prejudices , might be deterred by the idea of expense attending this branch of medical assistance .
But if the opulent and charitable would reflect how exceedingly useful their benefactions directed to this point would be , that , by a proper encouragement of this practice the lives of 200 of the rising generation might in all human probability have been saved to the public in the course of one year , the regret of having lost such an opportunity of doing good , would , I hope , be succeeded by suitable resolutions for some future occasion .
It would be easy to suggest a plan for promoting the practice of inoculation at a very moderate expense ; and , I am persuaded , the task of engaging the assistance of the faculty , would be the least difficult part .
With respect to the general Table of Diseases , the obvious uncertainty and inaccuracy of an enquiry which , in most cases , could only be made by the clerk in the church-yard , made me despair of rendering it in any great degree subservient to the purposes of science .
It has not , therefore , been attempted to give it a scientific form ; but the articles have for the most part been inserted just as they were given in .
Indeed the alarming article of Consumption , which includes all those returned under the common terms of Weakness , Surfeit , and Decay , has been arranged under three different periods of age , to enable the medical reader the better to judge of the different diseases contained under it .
The Table of Ages and Conditions has been drawn up with great exactness ; and will certainly , in a proper series , form very useful grounds for the calculations in political arithmetic .
In this light it is hoped that the utility of accurate bills of mortality will be generally apparent ; and that , since the benefit of them is not confined to one profession , all will concur in encouraging them .
