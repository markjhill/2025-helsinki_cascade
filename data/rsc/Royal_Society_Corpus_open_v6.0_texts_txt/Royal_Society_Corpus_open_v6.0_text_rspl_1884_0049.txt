I. I. Magnetic Observations .
The Magnetographs have worked uninterruptedly throughout the year .
The curves have been quite free from any large fluctuations , and indeed no unusual disturbance has been registered for a long time past .
The most notable perturbations recorded took place on July 3 , September 18 , and October 2 , but the extreme oscillation of the Declination Magnet on any of these days did not exceed 30 ' , while the change of Horizontal Force was less than 0-02 Gaussian unit .
Report of the KeCommittee .
463 The values of the ordinates of the different photographic curves determined in January were as follows :\#151 ; Declination : 1 inch=0 ' 22'*04 .
1 mm.=0 ' ( y'87 .
Bifilar , January 4,1884 , for 1 inch \#163 ; H=0*0276 foot grain unit .
" 1 mm. , , =0*0005 mm. mgr .
unit .
Balance , January 4,1884 " 1 inch \#163 ; V=0*0251 foot grain unit .
, , 1 mm. " =0*0005 mm. mgr .
unit .
The distance between the dots of light upon the cylinders of both the Bifilar and Vertical Force Magnetometers having become too small for satisfactory registration , it was found necessary to readjust each instrument , after which the scale values were again determined on January 11th , with the following-results :\#151 ; The monthly observations with the* absolute instruments have been made as usual , and the results are given in the tables forming Appendix I of this Report .
Bifilar for 1 inch \#163 ; H=0*0267 foot grain unit .
" 1 mm. " =0*0005 mm. mgr .
unit .
Balance " 1 inch \#163 ; V=0*0296 foot grain unit .
" 1 mm. " =0*0005 mm. mgr .
unit .
The tabulation referred to in last year 's Report of the traces of the three magnetic elements for the International1 Polar Commission , is now completed , and the conversion of the results into absolute units is in an advanced stage .
The difficulty experienced in adapting ordinary unprotected gas burners to the Bifilar and Balance Magnetometers , owing to the extremely sensitive nature of the gelatino-bromide paper , has now been overcome by the use of a small screen of blue glass interposed between the flame and mirror .
This diminishes the intensity of the light , so that the traces are now well defined instead of being blurred .
Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism , and various data , have been supplied to Dr. Wild , General Tillo , Dr. Frolich , Admiral Sir G. Richards , and Dr. Balfour Stewart .
The various magnetic instruments returned by Captain Dawson , R.A. , on his arrival in this country from the Fort Rae Circumpolar Expedition , were lent , with the exception of the Balance Magnetometer , one Bifilar , and one Declinometer , to Lieutenant A. Gordon , R.H. , of the Meteorological Office , Canada .
Professors Rucker and Thorpe visited the Observatory on July 17 , 18 , and 19 , for the purpose of taking a series of absolute magnetic observations preparatory to surveying the western coast of Scotland , as a preliminary operation towards the proposed repetition of the Survey of Great Britain and Ireland mentioned in last Report .

63 Soon after the needles of Dip Circle Barrow 33 had been repolished , as mentioned in last Report , it was found that Ho. 1 worked somewhat indifferently , and on examining its axle slight marks of scoring were discovered .
It was therefore deemed advisable to have a new axle substituted .
This was accordingly done by Mr. Dover , in December last , and since then the performance of the needle has been satisfactory .
II .
Meteorological Observations .
The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of atmospheric pressure , temperature , and humidity , wind ( direction and velocity ) , bright sunshine , and rain , have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year .
The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records have been duly registered during the year , together with the daily observations at 0 h. 8 m. p.m. in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service synchronous system .
A summary of these observations is given in Appendix II .
The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly carried on , and copies of these , as well as of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine have been transmitted weekly to the Meteorological Office .

to the Committee , the Meteorological instruments at the Observatories of Armagh , Falmouth , Oxford ( Radcliffe ) , and Valencia have been inspected by Mr. Whipple , and those at Aberdeen and Stonyhurst by Mr. Baker , during their respective vacations .
Assistance has also been given in arranging the plans , designs , \amp ; e. , for the New Observatory , now in progress of erection at Falmouth .
With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to , and published by " The Times " and " The Torquay Directory .
" Data have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the editor of " Symons 's Monthly Meteorological Magazine , " the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers , Messrs. Gwilliam , Mawley , Rowland , and others .
The cost of these abstracts is borne by the recipients .
The weekly abstracts of meteorological results , which have been published by the " Illustrated London News " without interruption since 1856 , were discontinued in July last , at the request of the proprietors , owing to changes being introduced in the form of publication of the paper .
Electrograph.\#151 ; This instrument was temporarily dismounted in May , whilst some repairs and painting of the instrument room were in progress , and recently some trouble has been experienced in keeping the potential of the charge constant , otherwise it has been maintained in continuous action .
\#187 ; The tabulation of the curves is at present in arrear , not having been completed beyond February 28 , 1882 .
Its scale value has been redetermined on two occasions by means of the Portable Electrometer , White No. 53 , such determinations being necessary after every readjustment of the instrument .
III .
III .
Solar Observations .
The sketches of Sun-spots , as seen projected on the photoheliograph screen , have been made on 185 days , in order to continue Schwabe 's enumeration , the results being given in Appendix II , Table IV .
A few experiments were made in June with the Photoheliograph , with a view of testing the suitability of certain plates prepared by Messrs. Morgan and Kidd for solar photography .
With this exception nothing has been done in that branch during the year .
Transit Observations.\#151 ; Frequent observations of both solar and sidereal transits have been made , for the purpose of keeping correct local time at the Observatory .
Numerous clock and chronometer comparisons have been also made .
The Observatory Chronometers , Parkinson and Frodsham No. 2408 , and Molyneux No. 2125 , have been cleaned and readjusted , Report of the Kew Committee .
and the following clocks are kept carefully rated in addition as timekeepers of the Observatory:\#151 ; French ; Shelton K. O. ; Shelton No. 35 .
and Dent 2011 .
By the courtesy of Mr. Preece , Superintendent of Telegraphs , the Richmond Chief Post Office was placed in direct communication with the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , on January 22 and enabled to receive the time signal at 10 A.M. , when a period of cloudy weather had rendered the true time a little uncertain .
Two chronometers conveyed to the Post Office , showed , on comparison with the signal , a satisfactory agreement between the times as kept at the two Observatories .
IY .
Experimental Work .
Actinometry.\#151 ; A report on the Balfour Stewart actinometer observations made last year , was submitted in December to the Meteorological Council , at whose expense the observations were carried on , and it was resolved to discontinue them .
The instrument has since been returned to Professor Balfour Stewart at his request .
Fog Gauge.\#151 ; In conformity with a suggestion contained in an article in " Symons 's Meteorological Magazine , " vol. xviii , p. 58 , a painted board has been set up to the north of the Observatory , to serve hs a gauge for measuring the intensity of fogs .
Since its erection in January last no fog , however , has been observed of intensity 1 on its scale .
Magnetic Survey of Great Britain and Ireland.\#151 ; With reference to ' this , the Sub-Committee appointed last year has now under consideration the details necessary for the early prosecution of the survey .
Professors Rucker and Thorpe have during the past summer made preliminary observations at a number of stations along the West Coast of Scotland , their1 base observations being made at the Observatory as above stated .
Nocturnal Radiation.\#151 ; Experiments have been made with a new pattern thermometer , designed by Messrs.'Negretti and Zambra for observations of nocturnal terrestrial radiation , with a view to the avoidance of several serious defects in the Rutherford Minimum , now generally used .
Yery favourable results were obtained until the instrument was damaged , and had to be sent back to the makers .
It has not yet been returned to the Observatory .
Photo-nephograpJi.\#151 ; Yarious experiments ha ve been made with this apparatus during the year , but in consequence of the short base line obtainable with the small amount of connecting wire available for working the pair of cameras , very few satisfactory determinations of cloud altitudes have been made .
A report having , however , been submitted to the Meteorological Council , that body has granted a sum of 40 to the Committee Report of the Kew for the purpose of purchasing a half-mile of double wire telegraphic cable and reel , together with switches and keys , in order that the two cameras may be worked at a distance of 800 yards apart .
A stand has been erected on the roof of the Observatory , where camera A will be permanently placed , and camera B will be similarly supported by another permanent stand at the other end of the cable .
Both cameras being oriented with reference to the same point of the horizon , the distant observer will be instructed as to the direction and elevation of his instrument by means of a telephone switched on to the line for the purpose .
Some difficulties having been met with in working the electrical instantaneous shutters , part of the apparatus was returned to the makers , the Philosophical Instrument Construction Society , Cambridge , and rectified .
Experiments with the new arrangement are now being made , and should they prove successful it is intended to bury the cable in the ground across the park beside the Observatory gas main , thereby obviating the present necessity of laying out and winding it in again every time it is desirable to make cloud altitude and air-current motion determinations .
Solar Radiation Thermometers.\#151 ; The experiments with a view to determining the causes of variation in the readings of similarly constructed and exposed black bulb thermometers , in , have been continued during the year .
The first series of observations having been concluded , and the results communicated to the Royal Meteorological Society and published in their " Quarterly Journal , " vol. x , p. 45 , the six thermometers were returned to Messrs. Negretti and Zambra , in order that all might have their bulbs coated with three coats of lampblack and their jackets altered : one pair is now enclosed in small bulbs , a second pair in medium , and the third pair in large bulbs .
% With the exception of one which was accidentally broken in July , they have been read daily since May 3 .
The results have not yet been fully discussed , but a cursory inspection appears to indicate that the larger the containing bulb the lower is the readiug of the enclosed blackened bulb thermometer .
Ventilation Experiments.\#151 ; Assistance has been given to a Sub-Committee of the Sanitary Institute in their experiments on the motion of air in ventilating tubes , which have been carried on during the summer under the charge of Mr. R. Rymer Jones , C.E. , in a hut erected for the purpose , adjacent to the Observatory .
The experiments are in continuation of those prosecuted in the Experimental House in 1880 .
Wind Integrator.\#151 ; At the request of Mr. Walter Bailey , M.A. , a wind-component integrator of his invention , described in the " Phil. Mag. , " Report of the Kew Committee .
vol. xvii , p. 482 , has been erected in the Experimental House , being attached by permission of the Meteorological Council to their spare Beckley Anemograph .
Some difficulties were experienced on account of the unsuitability of the electrical counters fitted to it for registration of light winds , but these have now been overcome , and the instrument is working satisfactorily .
V. Verification of Instruments .
The following magnetic instruments have been verified , and their constants determined:\#151 ; 3 Unifilar Magnetometers for Elliott Brothers , London .
3 Dip Circles for Elliott Brothers , London .
1 Unifilar Magnetometer for Negretti and Zambra , London .

Rating of Watches .
The arrangements for rating watches mentioned in last year 's Report have been completed and brought into operation successfully , at a cost of \#163 ; 193 .
A second safe having been purchased by the Committee , an apparatus was fitted to it which enables the enclosed watches to be maintained continuously at either high temperatures , without being subjected to injury by fumes of gas , or at low temperatures .
Report of the K Committee .
Two additional Mean Time Clocks have been obtained , one of them a Transit of Venus Expedition Clock , Dent 2011 , has been lent to the Committee by the Astronomer Royal ; the other has been purchased .
Mr. T. Mercer , watch manufacturer , of Coventry , having obligingly placed a number of watches at the disposal of the Superintendent , two dozen were obtained on loan from him , and were daily compared , tested , and rated by the assistants for three months .
This enabled them to become familiarised with the work of rating before watches were received from the public .
The Superintendent , after communicating with the Directors of the Geneva and the Yale Observatories , prepared a circular specifying the conditions watches must fulfil in order to obtain certificates of the various classes , A , B , and C , which are issued , and the nature of the test to which they will be subjected .
This circular , together with the forms of certificates , \amp ; c. , after revision and approval by the Committee , was printed , and copies forwarded to all the leading watch manufacturers of this country , as well as to the principal journals , many of which very favourably noticed the scheme .
Rating commenced on May 13 , and up to the present 42 watches have been tried , of which 22 were submitted by the owners , and 20 by the manufacturers , or by dealers .
Certificates have been awarded to 17 of these watches , 7 are now on trial .
The following table will indicate the nature of the trials to which the certificates refer :\#151 ; Position of watch , during test .

47 3 Report of the Kew Committee .
APPENDIX I. Magnetic Observations made at the Kew , Cat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " Long. Oh lm 15sl W. , for the year October 1883 to September 1884 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnets 101 B and N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3^ inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the unit in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0'46108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given .
The value of log 7r2K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at temperature 60n F. The induction-coefficient ju , is 0*000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to ail adopted standard temperature of 35 ' F. is 0*0001194(\#163 ; o\#151 ; 35 ) +0*000,000,213(\#163 ; 0\#151 ; 35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1*0 foot and 1*3 feet , are 1*000075 feet and 1*300097 feet respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction u -000129- . . . .
In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , was determined by the late Mr. Welsh , and has since been carefully verified .
The observations have been made and reduced by Mr. T. W. Baker .
