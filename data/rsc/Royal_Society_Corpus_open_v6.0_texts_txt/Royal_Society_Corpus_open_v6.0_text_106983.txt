H HE great improvements in algebra , which modern writers have made , are chiefly to be ascribed to VIETA'S discovery , that " every equation may have as many roots as it has dimensions .
' This principle was at first considered as extending only to positive roots ; and even when it was found that the number might , in some cases , be made up by negative values of the unknown quantity , these were rejected as useless .
It could not , however , long escape the penetration of the early writers on this subject , that in many equations , neither positive nor negative values could be discovered , which , when substituted for the unknown quantity , would cause the whole to vanish , or answer the condition of the question .
In such cases , the roots were said to be impossible without much attention to their nature , or inquiry whether they admit of any algebraical representation or not .
As far as the actual solution of equations was carried , viz. in cubics and biquadratics , the imaginary roots were found to be of this form , a+ b/ ZY ; and subsequent writers , from this imperfect induction , concluded in general , that every equation has as many roots , of the form a b/ V bW , as it has dimensions .
In the present state of the science , this proposition is of considerable importance , and its truth ought to be established on surer grounds .
The various transformations of equations , the dimensions to which they rise in their reduction , and the circumstances which attend their actual solution , are most easily explained , and most clearly understood , by the help of this principle .
Mr. EULER appears to have been the first writer who undertook to give a general proof of the proposition ; but , whatever may be thought of his reasoning in other respects , as he carries it no further than to an equation of four dimensions , and it does not appear capable of being easily applied in other cases , it gives us no insight into the subject .
Dr. WARING'S observations upon the proposition are extremely concise ; * and , to common readers , it will still be a matter of doubt , whether a quantity of any description whatever will , when substituted for x in the expression x3 px7 + qx6'- ... + W , cause the whole to vanish .
In the investigation of the proof here offered , it became neP cessary to attend to the method of finding the common measure of two algebraical expressions ; and to observe particularly , in what manner new values of the indeterminate quantities are introduced ; and how they may again be rejected .
It appears , that these values are necessary in the division ; and , , when they have been thus introduced , they enter every term of the second remainder , from which they may be discarded .
This circumstance -enables us , not only to determine the nature of the roots of every equation , but also affords us a direct and easy method of reducing any number of equations to one , and obtaining the final equation in its lowest terms .

In order to avoid fractions , multiply every term of the dividend by K , the square of the coefficient of the first term of the divisor , and the operation will be as follows : A xnB +Bx ) b Anzxn-i +c A'xn-2 +d A'xn-3 + &amp;c.

( P ) of At , which is impossible ; consequently no alteration is , in this case , made in the conclusion , by the introduction of At ; g. When P does not vanish , then every divisor of P is a divisor of Axn-1 +B X1-2 +C x8-3 + &amp;c. and of A ' ( a xo + bxn-i + cx2-2 + &amp;c. ) ; and therefore of ax ?
+ bxt-t + cXn-2 + &amp;c. unless As = o , in which case the remainder , P , becomes aB ( B x 4-2 +C X-3 + &amp;c. ) , every divisor of which is a divisor of Bxn-2 + Cxn-3 + &amp;c. whether it be a divisor of axn +b X-1 + CXn-2 + &amp; C. or not .
That is , there are two values of the indeterminate quantity A , which , if retained , will produce erroneous conclusions .

A " enters every term of the second remainder ( Q ) , and the two values , before introduced , may therefore be again rejected .
The coefficient of the first term of this remainder is C oB .

A ; and , by substituting for a , A and 'y , their values , and retaining only those terms in which A is not found " and those in which it is only of one , dimension , we have Cc -b BCA4+ aC B _a C'A BJ =+ bBCA-aCB ' + aBDA Ca BAa2BC2 a BDA Ca By .

In the same manner it appears , that A ' enters every other term of the remainder Q. * If the remainder Q o , then , by the second observation , the introduction of ca in the division , produces no error in the conclusion ; and , if Q do not vanish , os ' will be found in every term of the third remainder , and may there be rejected ; and so on .
Thus we obtain the conclusion , without any unneces- .
sary values of A , B , C , &amp;c. or a , b , c , &amp;c. 6 .
If the highest Indices of x , in the original quantities , be equal , it will only benecessary to multiply the terms of the dividend by A , which may be rejected after the second division .
If the difference of the highest indices of x ber m , the terms of the dividend must be multiplied by Am+I , the first quotient being carried to m+i terms .
This quantity , Am+I , will enter every factor in each term of the second remainder .

Two roots of an equation of 2em dimensions may be found by the solution of an equation of m. X -M 1 dimensions .
Let x2m + px2m-l + qx2-2 + rx &amp;c. + &amp;c. =o ; and , if possible , let v and zbe so assumed that v+ z , and , v+ z , may be two roots of this equation ; then , ='n 2m.-2 Z3 ; n 32 ~~~~~~2 3 2M-2 p -l =+ pV.n x+ zm- .

These equations have a common measure of the form y Z. Where Z is expressed in terms of z and known quantities ; and this common measure may be found , by dividing , as in Prop. i. till y is exterminated , and making the last remainder equal to nothing .
Now , the first remainder is ( cA-bB .

Now , in the m -1 remainder , y does not appear , and , in that remainder , z rises to m. oMn-1 dimensions ; if then , this remainder be made equal to nothing , and a value of z determined , the last divisor , y Z , where Z is some function of Z , is known ; and this is a common measure of the two equations ym + byl-1 + Cyt-2 + &amp; C. = o , and Aym-I + ByM-2 + Cym-3 + &amp; C.

Since two roots of the proposed equation are z+ v , and Z-v , 2X-2ZX + zt VIZ =o is a quadratic factor of that equation .
Cor. 2 .
In the same manner that the two equations ym4bym-t~ 4-cyt+ &amp;c. = o , and Aym~~i+ Bym*_sCymW s3c &amp; C. _ o , are reduced to one , may any two equations be reduced to one , and one of the unknown quantities exterminated ; also , the conclusion will be obtained in the lowest terms .

Every equation has as many roots , of the form a/ -as it has dimensions .
Case i. Every equation of an odd number of dimensions has , at least , one possible root ; and it may , therefore , be depressed to an equation of an even number of dimensions .
Case 2 .
If the equation be of em dimensions , and m be an odd number , then m. 2Mis an odd number , and consequently z and vt ( see Prop. ii .
) have possible values ; therefore the proposed equation has a quadratic factor , x22ZX 4Zoo O , whose coefficients are possible ; that is , it has two roots of the specified form ; and it may be reduced two dimensions lower .
Case 3t If m be evenly odd , or Man odd number , then the 2 equation for determining z , has either two possible roots , or two of the form ab vJ1 , ( Case 2 .
) ; and v will be of the form cd V--i ; hence , one value of the quadratic factor Xi2ZX + z'v=o , will be of this form , f-2a -F 2b v-i.x + AB + CDV/ -i o ; and another of this form , T-2~-2bV'/ --i.x +ABS-CDV.-i=o ; consequently .
Xw-.-4aX3 + ( 2AB+4a%+{4b")x x--(4aAB+4bCD ) x 4-A2IB + C ` D= o , will be a factor of the proposed equation and this biquadratic may be resolved into two quadratics whose coefficients are possible , and whose roots are therefore of the form specified in the proposition .
In the same manner the proposition may be proved , when &amp; C. is an odd number ; and thus it appears that it 4'S ' i6 is true in all equations .
* Cor. 1 .
If v2 , or y , be positive , the roots of the quadratic factor xt-.2ZX + z2v2= o , and therefore two roots of the proposed equation are possible .
If y= o , two roots are equal ; and if v be negative , two roots are impossible .
Cor. 2 .
If a possible value of z be determined , and substituted in b , c , d , &amp;c. the original equation will have as many pairs of possible roots as there are changes of signs in the equation ym + byM-1 + cyMn2 + &amp;c. = oand as many pairs of impossible roots as there are continuations of the same sign .
