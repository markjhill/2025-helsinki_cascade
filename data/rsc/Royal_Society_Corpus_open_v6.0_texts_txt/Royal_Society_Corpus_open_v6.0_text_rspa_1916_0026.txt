]\gt ; from the solids only , is where is the moment of momentum , about the axis , of the relative motioq of the solids .
The contribution from the liquid is taken over all the liquid , which is equal to in our customary notation , where denotes the component of along the outward-drawn normal to the boundary of a solid .
Now we might express the motion of the solids by means a function ; and although this would not be a harmonic function , it could be taken equal to at the surfaces of the solida If , then , the density of solids were uniform , and equal to , their contribution ( 26 ) would be FroIn this we see that the actual contribution from the liquid .
is eqnS and opposite to that of a set of solids of uniform density , occupying always * the positions of the actual solids .
The total contribution to is therefore . .
of is zero for , while the coefficient of is .
We obtain , on using ( 61 ) , Similarly , we may obtain .

Methods similar to those of the preceding section may be used to the motion of a body which moves irrotationally relative to the rotating axa By this we mean that the body remains fixed relative to a set of axes themselves always remain parallel to the fundamental rotating axes , but whose origin moves in any manner .
The most general motion of a sphere may be regarded as of this type , when points on its surface are 1lot required to be identified .
These two sets of rotating axes we shall refer to as the fundamental and the secondary axes .
Lt denote the components at time of the velocity of the liquid relative to the fundamental axes , at a point whose co-ordinates relative to the secondary axes are .
Then , the motion being small , the equations remain valid , but we have now
