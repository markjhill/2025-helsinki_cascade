" On the Lunar-DiurnalVariation of the Magnetic Declination obtained from the Kew Photograms* in the years 1858 , 1859 , and 1860 .
" By Major-General EDWARD SABINE , R.A. , Treas .
and V.P.R.S. Received December 19 , 1860t .
Having communicated to the Royal Society in a recent paper an analysis of the disturbances of the declination in the years 1858 and 1859 , shown by the photograms of the Kew Observatory , I propose in the present paper to submit the results of the lunar-diurnal variation of the declination in the years 1858 , 1859 , and 1860 , obtained from the same source .
The directions of the declination magnet at the instant of the commencement of every solar-hour having been tabulated from the photograms , and the final normals for each month and hour computed , after the omission from the record of all the hourly directions which deviated 3t'3 from their final normals , the differences were taken between each of the remaining hourly directions and the final normal of the same month and hour , and were entered afresh in lunar monthly tables , having the lunar days in successive horizontal lines , and the twenty-four lunar hours in vertical columns , each difference being placed under the lunar hour to which it most nearly approximated .
The entries in these tables should consequently represent directly the lunar influence at the different lunar hours , subject only to minor disturbances ; the effects of the solar-diurnal variation as well as of the larger disturbances having been eliminated .
The differences were marked with a+ sign when the north end of the magnet was east of its mean direction , and with the sign when west of the same .
The differences were then summed up , and hourly , monthly , and annual means taken by the non-commissioned officers of the Royal Artillery employed at Woolwich , under the superintendence of Mr. Magrath .
Having in the former paper exhibited the results of the disturbances at Kew in comparison with those at I-Hobarton , I propose to do the same with the lunar-diurnal variation treated of in this communicationi ; believing that such comparisons are very conducive to a just appreciation of the systematic character and natural reality of the results , and instructive both by the agreements and disagreements which they exhibit .
The lunar-diurnal variation at Hobarton has been obtained for the purpose of this comparison , by a similar process to that which has been described above , from observations at every solar hour during five years ( Sundays excepted ) , from Oct. 1 , 1843 to Sept. 30 , 1848 ; omitting as disturbed such observations as deviated 21 13 from their respective final normals .
The total number of hourly observations was 36,832 ; the disturbed observations 2606 ; and the number employed in the lunar-diurnal variation 34,226 .
As it has been customary to represent such periodical variations by formulae of well-known character , the results at Kew and Hobarton are here represented by formulae in which a , corresponding to x ( the lunar time for which the lunar-diurnal variation is desired ) , is counted in hours and parts of an hour , multiplied by 15 ?
, from the epoch of the moorn 's upper culmination .
The + sign corresponds ( as before ) to a deflection of the north end of the magnet to the east of its mean place , and the sign to the west .

In computing the lunar-diurnal variation by means of these formulie , the coefficient of the term which includes the sine of twice the hour-angle is of principal importance : the subsequent terms are comparatively of little significance , and are therefore omitted on the present occasion .
When all the terms are employed , the original observed values are reproduced .
Table I. exhibits , at Kew , in column 2 the lunar-diurnal variation as actually observed on the mean of the three years , and in column 3 , the same computed by the formula .
Columnn 4 is the lunar-diurnal variation at Hobarton on the mean of the five years as observed , and column 5 the same computed by the formula .

*~~~~~~~~~~ The aspect of the lunar-diurnal variation at Kew and Hobarton presents features of great simplicity as well as accord .
The form at both stations is a division of the 24 lunar hours into four equal or nearly equal portions , in which the magnet is attracted alternately to the east and to the west of its mean position , which is passed through four times in the progress of the magnet towards two extreme easterly and two extreme westerly deflections : the easterly extremes are about 12 hours apart , and the westerly the same .
As far as our present experience goes , this appears to be the general form of the lunar-diurnal variation of the declination at all the stations at which it has been examined ; it is also that of the corresponding variations of the Dip and Total force .
At Hobarton , where the results are obtained from five years of observation , there is scarcely any difference deserving of notice between the amplitudes of the extremes on either side of the upper culmination and those on either side of the lower culmination .
At Kew , where the results are obtained from only three years , the extreme deflections are not quite so symmetrical in amount , but they may become more so as additional years are brought into the account The amplitude of the oscillation on a mean of the two alternations is 91 " ' 74 at Kew and 6"f8 at Hobarton , a difference in correspondence with the difference in the opposite direction of the antagonistic retaining force of the earth 's magnetism at the two stations , which is 3'7 at Kew and 4'5 at EIobarton .
On inspecting the Table , we see that the lunar times when the moon 's influence produces no deflection ( or the times when the variation is zero ) , are four , and are nearly the same at Kew and at Hobarton , two of them being a little more than an hour before the moon 's passage of the meridian , both at her upper and lower culminations , and the other two intermediate .
So far the two stations are alike ; but in regard to the direction towards which the magnet is deflected ( if in conformity with general usage we speak in both hemispheres of the north end of the magnet , as is done in the Table ) , we see that the variation becomes west atKew when it becomes east at Hobarton , and vice versed ; the phases , while agreeingin hours at the two stations , having throughout opposite signs .
By extending the comparison of the lunar hours at which the lunar variation passes through its zero-points to other stations than Kew and Hobarton , we are made aware of differences which appear to deserve particular attention in theoretical respects .
At Pekin , for example-which may be advantageously compared with Kew , being both in the same hemisphere , but Pekin some degrees nearer the equator the variation is zero in the passage of the north end of the magnet from east to west at 20lunar hours , or 2k hours earlier than the corresponding epoch at Kew .
Again , at the Cape of Good I-ope , situated in the same hemisphere with Hobarton , but some degrees nearer the equator , the variation is zero in the passage of the north end of the magnet from west to east also at 20k lunar hours , or 2khours earlier than the corresponding epoch at Hobarton .
Thus there is an accord of precisely the same kind between Pekin and the Cape of Good I-lope that there is between Kew and Hobarton , whilst there is a difference between the two pairs of stations of 21 hours in the position of the moon relatively to the meridian at which she ceases to exercise a deflecting influence on the magnet .
Again , at St. Helena , which is in the same ( geographical ) hemisphere as Hobarton and the Cape of Good Hope , but still nearer to the equator than either , the lunar influence is zero in the passage from west to east at 19k lunar hours , being one hour earlier than at the Cape , and 3k hours earlier than at Hobarton .
Where the whole range of the variation of which we have been treating is so small ( not more than a few seconds of arc in each lunar day ) , it may be desirable to show by the accordance of the independent evidence obtained in single years , the degree of confidence which may be placed in the mean results of several years .
This may be seen in the Table on the next page , which contains the separate results in each of the five successive years of observation at Hobarton , as well as their mean .
In this Table the principal features of the variation are seen to be substantially alike in each year .
The individual results at the several hours in single years are of course somewhat less regular than in the mean of the five years : such small discrepancies are no doubt in great part due to the lesser disturbances which , being below the separating value of 2 ' 13 , have been left in the body of the observations .
They slightly disfigure the symmetry of the results in single years , but almost entirely disappear when the mean of several years is taken .
In order to appreciate justly and fully the confidence to which the whole investigation is entitled , it must be borne in mind that every single entry in the Table ( exclusive of course of the column which exhibits the mean of the five preceding columns ) is derived from a wholly independent body of observations which belong to itself alone , and are not employed in the deduction of any of the other entries .

I have spoken in a recent paper of an unexceptionable test by which we may satisfy ourselves as to the confidence which may be reposed in a series of observations , whether obtained by the eye or tabulated from instrumental traces .
Such a test is furnished when the entries at solar hours are rewritten according to the lunar hours to which they most nearly approximate , and when consequently their original order and relations are changed and are replaced by others which were wholly unforeseen , so that the observations must necessarily be free from the possibility of having been influenced by any mental bias .
When we find the effects of a natural law , represented by such minute values as that of the lunar-diurnal variation , exhibited by the observations of a single year with the degree of symmetry shown in Table II , we may safely conclude that the observations themselves are worthy of the labour bestowed in eliciting their results .
In this view the HIobarton observations prove themselves to have been not only a faithful , but also an extremely careful series , highly creditable to Captain Kay , R.N. , and to the Naval Officers who with him and their Civil Assistant Mr. Jeffery , maintained for so many years the laborious and monotonous duty of hourly observation .

In the introductory discussion prefixed to the 2nd volume of the St. Helena Magnetical Observations , p. cxliv to cxlviii , the lunar-diurnal variation is given for each of the three magnetic elements , the Declination , the Dip , and the Intensity of the force , at the four stations of Toronto , St. Helena , the Cape of Good Hope and Iobarton , and for the Declination at two additional stations Kew and Pekin .
The variations are given both in formulae and in tables ; the latter exhibiting the amount of the lunar influence at each of the 24 lunar hours , in the several magnetic elements at each station .
These data are directly applicable to inquiries into the nature of the moon 's magnetism ; and into the mode by which the moonl 's magnetism acts either on the magnetism of the earth itself , or on the magnetic needle stationed at different points of the earth 's surface , so as to produce a small but systematic and perfectly appreciable variation in each of the magnetic elements , having a double period in every lunar day .
The lunar-diurnal variation of the Declination at Kew and Hobarton , as given in this communication , is slightly different from the figures in the 2nd St. Helena volume referred to , because the results at Kew are a mean of 3 years instead of 2 , as in the St. Helena volume ; and at Hobarton a lower standard has been taken for the disturbances , causing a larger number of the disturbed observations to be omitted in the calculation of the lunar-diurnal variation .
