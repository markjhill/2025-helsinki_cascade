X 1656-7 A.U. was found on all the plates which Lyman gives as present , in all metallic spark spectra in helium.* It was probably due to carbon from the decomposition of carbon monoxide given off from the wax joint .
As far as the writers can discover , none of the lines given for .tellurium , , molybdenum and zirconium have been measured hitherto for these elements .
In the spectra of molybdenum and zirconium all the wave-lengths observed were of weak intensity .
The radiations from tellurium , however , were stronger and their relative intensities are approximately those given in the Table .
A reproduction of the spectrum of this element is given in Plate 2 , A_ Note on Vacuum Grating Spectroscopy .

In the spectroscopy of the extreme ultra-violet region , it is necessary-to work either with arcs in vacuo or with sparks in one or other of the gases hydrogen or helium .
As all other gases are opaque to ultra-violet radiations of short wave-length , their use is precluded .
With many of the elements , , arcs are difficult to maintain in a vacuum , and consequently one is driven to the use of sparks in either one or other of the two gases mentioned .
Lyman , f in his brilliant researches , has shown us that , with hydrogen , it is possible to obtain spectra extending to about X 900 A.U. For radiations below this limit , it would appear , however , that hydrogen is more or less absorbing. .
With helium , on the other hand , the evidence available goes to show that o this gas is transparent to radiations having wave-lengths as short as X 400 A.U. or X 500 A.U. , and possibly shorter still .
It would appear , then , that in the spectroscopy of the extreme ultra-violet , the procedure to be followed , which would permit of the most rapid progress being made , would be , in so far as the emission spectra are concerned , to work with a vacuum grating spectrograph , and to use an atmosphere of helium .
As regards the absorption spectra of the elements , helium also appears to be promising .
From the work of Mackay and Ferguson , J it is known that-arcs in helium can be struck and maintained for long periods between .

non-vapourising electrodes , such as those of tungsten .
This means that , if a vacuum grating spectrograph , provided with a lamp of the " Pointolite " type , be filled with helium to a suitable pressure , arcs can be struck in the gas , when the requisite voltages are applied , which will provide a radiation consisting of wave-lengths extending probably to near 400 X A.U. Prom Lyman 's experiments , it is known that radiations are given out by helium of approximately this wave-length , and can be recorded .
With such a source of illumination available , it should be possible , by interposing the vapours of elements between the arc and the grating of the spectrograph , to obtain the absorption spectrum of the elements vapourised .
The experience of different workers in this field has shown that , for success , extreme precautions must be taken to ensure that the vacuum grating spectrograph is kept free of water vapour and all such gases as oxygen , nitrogen , carbon monoxide , etc. This means , in the first place , that the vacuum grating spectrograph should be designed so as to be as free as possible from all liability to leaks , and , in the second place , provision should be made to remove any traces of oxygen , nitrogen , or carbon monoxide , which are liberated from the electrodes by the establishment of the arc , or which exude from the walls of the spectrograph after the instrument has been filled with helium and while exposures are being made .
A description has already been given of a vacuum grating spectrograph , which was used by the writer in collaboration with Mr. E. J. Lang , * for studying the vacuum arc spectra of a few of the elements .
With this apparatus , it was found that , while the spectrum of carbon , for example , was recorded so far down as X 584 A.U. , it was only obtained when extreme care was taken to see that proper conditions obtained .
Numerous difficulties and vexatious delays were experienced in making seals airtight and free from small leaks , chiefly because , in the design of the apparatus , a number of the seals were made between part4 whose bearing surfaces were vertical .
No provision was made in the apparatus , moreover , for removing exuded gases other than by pumping .
The grating used , besides , was small , and this necessitated long exposures .
With a view to improving matters , the apparatus was redesigned , and provision was made not only for removing the exuded gases , but also for using a grating of any size , and for so arranging its carrier and its controls that adjustments could readily and easily be made .

The spectrograph was designed for use with a grating having a radius of 1 metre , and it was therefore made about 130 cm .
in length over all .
The enlarged portion , which enclosed the grating , was 22 cm .
in diameter and 30 cm .
in length .
The longer cylindrical portion of the apparatus had a diameter of 15 cm .
As shown in the diagram , the opening above the grating was closed with a tinned E 2 Fig. 4 .
VERTICAL SECTION , Prof. J. C. McLennan .
brass cap , M , which fitted into a casting with a tapered ground joint .
This opening gave ready access to the grating for adjustment , and , when the cap was placed in position , with its bearing surfaces slightly smeared with " Airtite , " and the groove shown in the figure filled with melted wax , a perfect seal was obtained .
The exhaust pipe , K , was joined to the apparatus as shown , so that the junction could be made absolutely airtight by flowing oVer it a small quantity of melted wax .
It was arranged that the grating should be placed in position with its rulings horizontal .
For some preliminary experiments , a grating was used , with a ruling 54 cm .
wide and 7*8 cm .
long , and having 6273 lines per centimetre .
The mount was provided with rails , which allowed 15 cm .
travel for the grating , and with the usual adjusting devices for orientating the grating in various ways .
The plate-holder , C , was suspended vertically and was attached to a conical plug , E , for support .
This plug carried a guide for ensuring its being inserted correctly in position , and it was also provided with slits ( not shown in the diagram ) , in which could be inserted two thin brass strips for screening off .
light from the photographic plate when the plate-holder was carried from and to the developing chamber .
When the plate-holder was in position , a threaded plug , D , provided with a leather washer , closed the opening , and an absolutely airtight joint was made by filling up with melted wax the groove made above the threaded portion of D. The glass windows at A and B were permanently fastened into the-apparatus with sealing-wax and were used for observing the central image of the slit while adjusting the grating .
These windows were provided with removable caps for cutting off extraneous light while exposures were being made .
The slit , S , was carried by a sleeve , which could be inserted , rotated , .
, or removed at will .
When the slit was properly adjusted , the bushing , T , , was screwed in and permanently sealed to the apparatus with hard wax .
The brass tubes , F , G , and H , led to three cocoanut charcoal tubes , which during exposures were immersed in liquid air .
A fourth tube , B , led to a Geissler tube , which , when excited by a small induction coil , was used to-make observations on the pressure of the gas in the spectrograph .
In operating , the spectrograph gases were removed by means of two Trimount oil-sealed pumps , in series , driven by individual motors .
These pumps were found to be highly efficient , a green fluorescence vacuum beiug .
obtainable with them in about 15 minutes .
With the grating described above , it was found that in the first order the dispersion was such that a spectrum extending from X = 0 A.U. to X = 2000 A.U. covered about 5 inches of the photographic plate .
It was possible , therefore , , to make observation over this range with but a single setting. .
Note on Vacuum Grating Spectroscopy .
In adjusting the grating and slit , a plate coated with anthracene was inserted in the plate-holder and the light from a spark between aluminium terminals was used for illumination .
As the distance between the centres of the two observation windows was about 5 inches , the procedure followed was to adjust the grating so that the bright central image could be seen either through the lower or the upper window .
When this condition obtained , the illumination of the anthracene screen by the wave-length X = 1854 A.U. could also then be seen as well through the other window if the orientation of the grating was correct .
Fine focussing of the spectrum could be made by moving the mount of the grating with an adjusting screw slightly forward or back on the rails .

Observations .
When it was seen that the spectrograph from a mechanical and an operating point of view was satisfactory , some preliminary experiments were made with a sparking chamber such as that shown in fig. 1 .
The lamp and spectrograph were highly exhausted , washed out several times with charcoal-purified helium , and finally filled with this gas .
The gas inlet valve was then closed and the charcoal tubes , attached at F , G , and H , were immersed in liquid air to take up any oxygen , nitrogen , or carbon monoxide liberated from the electrodes or from the walls of the apparatus .
In these preliminary experiments it was found that in the visible portion of the spectrum the helium lines came out with strong intensity .
In the ultra-violet region , however , there appeared on the photographic plates a series of gas lines in addition to those which were known to be due to the metals used .
It was then decided to make a special study of the spectrum obtainable from an arc in helium between tungsten terminals , in order to pick out the lines which one could definitely ascribe to helium itself .
For this purpose the lamp shown in fig. 6 was designed .
Connection between the lamp and the spectrograph was made by means of the brass piece , E , which was sealed to the lamp by means of Khotinsky wax .
Ibis piece , E , as shown , was provided with a tapered end , which fitted , after careful grinding , very closely into its corresponding bushing , T , attached to the spectrograph .
This was the only joint in the apparatus requiring to be frequently broken where the bearing surfaces were not horizontal .
It was found , however , on account of the surfaces being ground to a good fit , that a slight smearing of " Airtite " made a perfectly gas-tight union .
N and R were two beads of tungsten , carried by two slender tungsten rods , which were carried by wires sealed into the glass stoppers F and G. C , H ' was a glass tube filled with cocoanut charcoal covered with a wad of glass-wool .
Prof. J. C. McLennan .
J was a coil of fine tungsten wire , which formed part of the heating circuit , 0 , J , P. In operating the lamp , both it and the spectrograph were filled with purified helium through the tap , D , to a pressure of from 30 cm .
to 40 cm .
of mercury .
Liquid air was then placed about the charcoal tube , IP , and about those attached to the spectrograph at F , G , and H , fig. 1 .
F , fig. 6 , was joined to the positive terminal of a 110-volt D.C. circuit , and 0 to the negative terminal of the same circuit .
The circuit included , of course , a variable o p Fig. 6 .
rheostat .
The heating circuit , 0 , J , P , was provided with current from an insulated battery , and it was found that , at the pressures cited , as soon as J became incandescent the arc struck between J and R , and then finally between N and R. At this point the auxiliary heating battery was cut off and the arc persisted without it .
At the pressures used , it was found quite easy to establish and maintain for hours arcs in helium with distances as great as 5 mm. or 6 mm. between the two tungsten beads , N and R. Tests made from time to time on these helium arcs showed a potential drop between the terminals of 45 volts when a current of 4'6 amperes was passing .

and possibly to carbon monoxide .
A list of the wave-length determinations from measurements made on a number of plates is given in Table I , and a reproduction of the spectrum of the helium arc is shown in Plate 1 .
In the visible portion of the spectrum the helium lines came out with strong intensity .

; i # An attempt was made to identify the wave-lengths , and suggestions as to their probable origin are given in the Table .
Between X = 1000 A.U. and X = 1700 A.U. , it would seem from Lyman 's results that the majority of the o wave-lengths was due to hydrogen .
The two wave-lengths X = 1216 A.U. and X \#151 ; 1026 A.U. constitute the first and second members of the principal series of the hydrogen spectrum predicted by Bitz , calculated by Bohr , and identified by Lyman .
These , it will be seen , are among the more intense wave-lengths recorded .
The wave-length X = 1329-0 A.U. was among the strongest recorded , and appears to be of uncertain origin .
Lyman gives o a wave-length at X \#151 ; 1329-3 A.U. for hydrogen , but it appears to have come out on his plates with an intensity much less than it did on the plates obtained in this investigation .
The wave-lengths X = 1561*8 A.U. , X = 1658*2 A.U. , and X = 1932*4 A.U. , are evidently due to carbon possibly having its origin in the tap grease used for making the joints gas-tight .
For the range between X = 2000 A.U. and X = 1700 A.U. , it will be seen that the spectrum consisted , with a few exceptions , of a series of wave-lengths of feeble intensity .
These would not appear to have been due to hydrogen , but may have had their origin in the vapour of tungsten , which probably was present to a slight extent in the arcs .
No indication was obtained of the presence of the wave-length X = 1640 A.U. , which Lyman found could be obtained from helium .
This was no doubt due to the fact that the arcing potential used in the experiments was only 45 volts .
i Note on Vacuum Grating Spectroscopy .
123 An arcing potential of over 80 volts , on the Bohr theory , would be required to bring out this wave-length in the radiation emitted .
The shortest wavelength recorded , it will be seen , came at X 1025-8 A.U. , but , while this is so , it should be stated here that , on all the plates , indications were obtained of a faint continuous spectrum , extending to well below X = 500 A.U. As the two tungsten beads , N ' and K , were highly incandescent during the operation of the arc , it may be that this continuous spectrum had its origin in the radiations emitted by them .
From the results of the investigation , it would appear that , in order to obtain the spectrum of helium in the extreme ultra-violet region with arcs between non-vapourisable electrodes , very special precautions will have to be taken to remove all traces of hydrogen from the helium in the spectrograph .
To do this , it would probably be necessary to admit small quantities of oxygen to the spectrograph from time to time , and to remove the excess oxygen by means of the charcoal tubes .
It would probably prove more expeditious , however , to adopt a suggestion recently made by Lord Bayleigh , to cause the helium in the spectrograph to circulate in a closed cycle , part of the circuit being external to the spectrograph , and having included in it a tube , filled with charcoal , maintained at the temperature of liquid air , as well as others suitably equipped for getting rid of the hydrogen .
Such a circulatory system could be operated for any time desired , and its use would enable one to raise the helium to the highest possible degree of purity .
The adoption of such special precautions to get rid of the hydrogen are all the more necessary if a pure spectrum of helium is to be obtained , for it has been shown that , in part of the ultra-violet region at least , the wave-lengths emitted by helium should be close to analogous ones emitted by hydrogen .
In view of the fact that the shortest wave-length recorded in this investigation was X = 1025-8 A.U. , it should be noted that the potential fall between the electrodes in the arc was only 45 volts .
To bring out the shortest wave-lengths obtainable from helium , it would be necessary to arrange matters so that the drop in potential was considerably increased .
In conclusion , the writer wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr. A. Sinclair for assistance in constructing the spectrograph , and to Mr. P. H. Petrie for help in taking the spectrograms .
