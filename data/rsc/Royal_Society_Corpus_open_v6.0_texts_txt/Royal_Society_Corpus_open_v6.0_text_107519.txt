Direct and expeditious methods of calculating the excentric from the mean anomaly of a planet .
By the Reverend Abram Robertson , D. D. F. R. S. Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford , and Radclfian Observer .
Communicated by the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. G. C. B. P.R.S. Read February 15 , 1816 .
SINCE the publication of KEPLER'S discoveries in astronomy , the attention of men of science has frequently been directed to the problem distinguished by his name , and their exertions have frequently been employed to overcome the acknowledged difficulty of its solution .
A statement of the various degrees of success , with which these endeavours have been made , is foreign to the present design .
An account of this kind is now also needless , as Dr. BRINKLEY'S examination of such attempts , published in the ninth volume of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy , affords a satisfactory review of most of the proceedings on this subject , previous to the year 1802 .
After the following methods had occurred to my consideration , and I had fully proved their utility by actual application to examples , I was anxious to ascertain whether any author had anticipated me in the manner in which the investigations are conducted .
With this view I examined such solutions as are referred to in Dr. BRINKLEY 's very able Memoir , all those mentioned by MONTUCLA , * of which I could procure a sight , and some others which had occurred to me in the course of my reading .
The result of this search is a belief that no one before has aimed at a direct solution through the same small angle , and , by means of an equation in which this angle at:d its powers are the only unknown quantities , obtained a quickly converging series for its value in known terms .
The small angle being found , with due precision , the eccentric anomaly readily becomes known .
M. DELAMBRE , in his Astronomy , published at Paris in 1814 , in three quarto volumes , calculates the excentric anomaly by a method founded on those of CASSINI , * LA CAILLE , f SIMPSON4 and CAGNOLIr ?
This eminent astronomer says of it , " Ce procede , le plus direct que je connaises , est aussi le plus precis ; il n'est qu'approxinmatif , mais il est totujours exact au-dela des dixiemes de second pour toutes les planetes de notre systemte .
" That the reader may readily judge how far the third method , which I now propose , deserves attention , I have annexed to my investigation the calculation by it of M. DELAMBRE'S two examples , and also one relating to the comet of 1682 and 1759 .
Each of the following methods of solution is to be considered as direct , although it proceeds through the medium of what is commonly called CASSINI'S approximation .
This approximation , as here used , can only be considered as the first certain step in the computation .
No hypothesis is introduced into the proceeding , and therefore no correction by trial and error is requisite .
PSX Let ALP be the orbit of a planet , C the centre of the ellipse , S that focus in which the sun is placed , and AMP a circle described on the greater axis AP as a diameter , Let L be the true place of the planet , and AM the corresponding mean anomaly .
Throughi L let the straight line ER be drawn , perpendicular to AP , and let it meet AP in R and the circle in E. Let EC , CM , SM be drawn , and let ST be perpendicular to EC , SG to CM and MN to ST .
Then MN is parallel to ET , and NT is equal to the sine of the arc EM .
It is easily proved , as in almost every writer on the subject , that ST is equal to the arc EM .
In this Problem it is supposed that AC , CS , AM are given , and it is required to find AE the excentric anomaly , for AE being found , the true anomaly ASL is easily obtained .
In each of the three following methods the angles CMS , CSM are used , and their difference is found by this proportion .
CM + CS : CMCS : : tan .
ACM : tan .
^ ( CSMCMS ) Hence the angles become known by their sum and difference .
As the angle SMN is very small , and consequently the angle MSC nearly equal to ECA in the orbits of almost all the planets , this way of finding the angle CSM is usually called CASSINI'S approximation to the excentric anomaly ACE .
FIRST METHOD .
Having found the angle CSM , sin. CSM : CM : : sin. SCM .
SM , which therefore becomes known .
Let z equal the angle SMN , s equal the series expressing its sine , and c equal the series expressing its cosine .
Put a equal the sine of CMS , and b equal its cosine .
Then , radius being t , ac -bs = sin. CMN = sin. ECM = sin. ( C(MS --z ) .
Also , : SM : : s SN SMx s , and ac bs + SM xs TN + SN = EM CMS-- , and therefore CMS %Z+ acbs + SM xs == z+ ac + SM bx s. Let d=SMb , andthenCMS=--Z+a + ds= z +a ( -~a , ~6.Z8 23 et + -.4.--5 6 +._7.- &amp;c. ) +d(z--- : + - &amp;c. ) 2.3.4 2 34.5.6 +.3.4.5.678 2.3 -345 az+ dz3 az4 ds5 +z+ dz-2-5 +r +.3.5 2 232.+2-34+ 2.3.4.5 Let e=CMS-a , and putting A , B , C , &amp; c , for the coefficients e=AB -Bz C%3 -+ Dz4 + E@X F --6 Gz7 + &amp;c. By reversing this series we find z= --e 4Z(id 4da _3+ e3 a 5a d4 5e a3 '6(i+d)+2-2(i+d)24(1 +d)'+ z2(i+d ) ' 8(1r-Fp + &amp;c. This equation is in parts of the radius , and in order to have it in degrees we use this proportion , i : 57 ? .

The substitutions for the sines and cosines of the angles CMS , SMN being as in the preceding method , let SG be perpendicular to MC , and then radius being 1 , .
: CS : : sin. ACM : CS x sin , ACMSG .
But sin. CMS : SG : : sin. SMN : SN , that is , a : CS x sin. ACM : : s : in .
Cs SN , and CS x sin. ACM therefore ac bs +a -s TN+ SNST CMSz .
Let dC --si AC b , and then ac + ds CMS z , and CMS =z+ ac + ds , as in the preceding method .
THIRD METHOD .
Let z the angle SMN , s the series expressing its sine , and c the series expressing its cosine , as before ; but let a now denote the sine of CSM , and b its cosine , and let MN meet CS in H. Then ac + bs is equal to the sine of the sumn of the angles SMH , MSC , that is , ac + bs sin. MHA = sin. ACE , the excentric anomaly .
We have therefore CE : ac + bs : CS( + b ) ST = CMS-z .
CE Let d cx ande Cs x , and tlen dc + es=CMS--z , Ce X an e'U ' and then dc and CMS z+ dc + es + d-z --+ dz -d6 1821 2.3.4 2.3.4.5.6 ?

With the design already expressed , I adopted in this example the same data with Mr. IVORY : see Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh , Vol. V. page 236 .
The preceding method bears a nearer resemblance to that given by KEILL , in his Astronomy , than to any other of which I know .
Adapting his manner of proceeding to the figure here used , he puts y= EM , e= sin. AM , f cos. AM , and g= CS .
The series expressing the sine of AE , is therefore equal to e-.fy-~ + .
+2e &amp;c. But the radius , which is i , is to the sine of AE as CS or g is to ST or EM , that is to y , Consequently y =ge.-gfy+ e3 +3 &amp;c. and there- , 3 zey z ' &amp; r-2.3.4 fore ge =y+gfy +._y -g -gey &amp;c. 2 2.3 2.-3.4 By reversing this he obtains a series , which , omitting the numbers in the coefficients , converges as the powers of g CS x sin. AM or Ics x CS AM This degree of convergency to the value of y in the foregoing examples is as follows .
In the first example as the powers of.2147372 , In the second example as the powers of.255300o , In the third example as the powers of.1o86700 .
In the third method which has been here investigated , the series converges to the value of SMH as the powers of Jf CMS-CS x sin. CSM -e or SX-M'This degree of convergency in the foregoing examples is as follows .
In the first example as the powers of.oo082o9 , In the second example as the powers of.o050438 , In the third example as the powers of -0055358 .
The third method , by which the three foregoing examples are calculated , appears to me the most simple and precise in theory , and the most expeditious in practice of any which I have seen .
This I say with the greater degree of freedom , as I am so well aware of the similarity between its series and that of KEILL'S , and so perfectly convinced of the advantages which it derives from CASSINI 's approximation , that I consider it , with the exception of some deviations , as a combination of their methods .
