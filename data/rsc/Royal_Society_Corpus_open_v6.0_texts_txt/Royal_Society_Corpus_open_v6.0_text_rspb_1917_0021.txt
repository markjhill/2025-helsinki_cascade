The Effect of Exposure to Temperatures at or above 100 ' C. upon the Substance ( Vitamine ) whose Deficiency in a Diet causes Polyneuritis in Birds and Beri-Beri in .
By Harriette Chick and E. Margaret Hume .
( Communicated by Dr. C. J. Martin , F.R.S. Received January 10 , 1917 .
) ( From the Lister Institute .
) The influence of exposure to high temperatures upon the 44 vitamine , " whose deficiency in a diet causes polyneuritis in birds and beri-beri in man , is a subject of great practical importance , chiefly for two reasons .
In the first place , it is very necessary to know what degree of destruction , if any , is suffered by the vitamines contained in ordinary foodstuffs during the usual cooking processes , at or about 100 ' C. In the second place , there is the case of preserved foods , such as tinned meat , vegetables , milk , etc. , which are sterilised at temperatures above 100 ' C. in the process of their manufacture .
Temperatures at or above 100 ' C. upon Vitamines .
The fate of the vitamines during this treatment becomes a vital matter where preserved foods form the staple article of a diet , as may be the case with troops on active service , separated from fresh food supplies .
In such circumstances the ration is usually completed with bread or biscuit , and we have made a special investigation of the wheat-grain and its various constituents in order to gauge the value of the bread or biscuit in such a diet .
The results of these experiments are given in a separate communication* which contains references to the general literature of beriberi , and to which the reader is also referred for a detailed description of the methods employed in the present work .
Polyneuritis of birds has been accepted as the complete analogy of beriberi in man and , for the sake of brevity , we shall refer to the substance whose absence in a diet occasions polyneuritis in birds , or beri-beri in man , as the " anti-neuritic vitamine " ( or anti-beri-beri vitamine ) .
As regards the influence of high temperatures upon this substance , a great number of isolated observations exists in the literature , but no one hitherto seems to have attempted any systematic study of the point .
Grijns ( 1901 ) showed that 1-2 hours ' exposure to 120 ' C. destroyed the protective properties against polyneuritis of unmilled rice , " Katjang idjo " beans , and buffalo meat .
Eijkman ( 1906 ) confirmed Grijns ' results as far as unmilled rice was concerned , but did not succeed in destroying the anti-neuritic properties of horse-flesh by heating for two hours at 120 ' C. Schaumann ( 1910 ) , however , induced polyneuritis in dogs with a diet of horse-flesh heated 1-3 hours at 120'-130 ' C. , and Holst ( 1907 ) traced a loss of anti-neuritic vitamine in beef after heating to 110 ' C. for half-an-hour ; this loss was much more marked after one hour at 120 ' C. In the case of dried peas or unpeeled barley , on the other hand , kept for half-an-hour at 115 ' C. , no particular damage was done .
Most observers have not detected any destruction of vitamine at 100 ' C. In these and other experiments , the temperatures noted appear to be those registered by the autoclave or steamer used , no measurement being apparently made in the interior of the substance heated .
This is an important point , as the latter temperature remains for a surprisingly long time far below the former ( see Table I ) , especially if the material investigated has a low conductivity , which is true of most foodstuffs , especially if fairly dry .
Further , no attempt has been made to investigate the time relations of the destruction process of the vitamine .
This is obviously an exceedingly difficult problem , seeing that the only available instrument for measurement is so very imperfect .
Nevertheless it seemed worth while to make the following effort .

64 Miss H. Chick and Miss E. M. Hume .
The Effect of Wheat embryo , in which the anti-beri-beri experiment is highly concentrated , was selected as suitable material for the present experiments , and 50-100 grm. were heated in a steam autoclave at different temperatures for different intervals of time .
It was found that the interior of the material very slowly acquired the temperature of its surroundings , and special steps were taken to ascertain the exact temperatures experienced .
In cases where the material was steamed at 100 ' C. ( Expts .
2 and 3 , Table I ) the real internal temperature was measured by means of a maximum thermometer , whose bulb was inserted in the middle of the mass to be heated , and whose stem projected through the neck of the bottle containing it .
The whole was lifted from the steamer for an instant at intervals of about 20 minutes , in order to obtain readings from the thermometer and to construct a curve of rise of temperature .
In case of temperatures above 100 ' C. this procedure is not possible , and it was necessary to make special control experiments in which similar , amounts of similar material were placed under exactly the same conditions as those of the actual test .
Steam was blown off after various intervals of time from the start , the autoclave opened and note taken of the maximum temperatures registered both inside the vessel containing the wheat germ , and outside in the autoclave .
By means of a series of such tests made separately , a temperature curve was constructed from which an accurate estimate could be made of the temperatures actually experienced by the material exposed .
The data upon these points are set forth in the first three columns of Table I , above .
The experiments fall into two classes ( a ) those at or near 100 ' C. , devised to be applicable to the ordinary processes of cooking , and those above 100 ' C. , intended to give information as to what may be expected to happen during sterilisation of tinned and canned foods .
The effect on the properties of the wheat germ of exposure to these temperatures was studied by the following method .
Comparison was made of the minimum doses of ( a ) original and ( b ) heated germ required to cure pigeons ( of weight 300-400 grm. ) acutely ill with polyneuritis , brought on by an exclusive diet of polished rice .
From the results given in Table I it is seen that destruction of the anti-neuritic vitamine progresses very slowly at 100 ' C. or thereabouts .
In fact , after two hours ' exposure to such a temperature ( Expt. 3 ) our experiments fail to reveal any significant loss in anti-neuritic properties\#151 ; the curative dose of the heated " germ " remaining about 2*5 grm. , the same as that of the unheated material ( Expt. 1 ) .
After exposure for 40 minutes to a mean temperature of about 113 ' C. the efficiency , compared with the unheated control , is reduced to about one-half , and after subjection to 118'-124 ' C. for two hours , to something less than a quarter , possibly to Temperatures at or above 100 ' C. upon 65 one-tenth .
The results in this series reveal all the imperfections alluded to elsewhere ( see preceding paper ) by the authors as peculiar to the curative type of experiment .
The material used in these experiments had rather a low water content , 10 per cent. , and the vitamine present might be supposed to be protected from destruction on that score .
A similar set of data are now being obtained , using a soluble yeast extract , containing over 60 per cent , water , whose vitamine content , reckoned on dry weight , is of about the same order as that of wheat germ .
These experiments are not yet complete , but enough results have been already obtained to show that the extra water present during the heating has not enhanced at all the destructive effect of high temperatures upon the active substance .
It is therefore justifiable to apply the results obtained above with pure wheat germ to such processes as the baking of bread , biscuit , etc. , where the water content may approach 50 per cent. The time taken to bake an average loaf does not exceed one hour , and the internal temperature rises to about 101 ' C. We may therefore conclude that , if wheat germ is included in the fiour from which the bread is made , its anti-neuritic ( anti-beri-beri ) properties will survive the baking process , suffering very little damage .
The rapid destruction of anti-neuritic vitamine in the neighbourhood of 120 ' C. suggests that many tinned foods will be found deficient in respect of this constituent , and such we have found to be the case .
We have examined two samples of army " meat and vegetable ration .
" In order to concentrate any vitamines they might contain , we extracted the air-dried material with alcohol ( see Cooper , 1913 , and H. C. and E. M. H. , loc. cit. , p. 46 ) , taking up the residue , after evaporating the alcohol under reduced pressure , with a small amount of water .
In the case of Eation A , a very slight improvement in symptoms , but nothing approaching a cure , was obtained after administration of an extract equivalent to 350 grm. ( 112 grin , dry weight ) , and in case of Kation B , an incomplete cure after the equivalent of 440 grm. ( 106 grm. dry weight ) .
Working with fresh meat , and using a similar method , Cooper ( 1913 ) obtained cures with the equivalent of 140 grm. ( = 30 grm. dry weight ) .
In the two preserved " rations " there would therefore appear to have been extensive destruction of anti-beri-beri properties during the process of manufacture .
Summary and Conclusions .
1 .
Exposure of wheat embryo to a temperature of about 100 ' C. for two hours resulted in no significant loss in anti-neuritic " vitamine .
" If , therefore , it is included in the flour from which bread or biscuit is made , it can be relied upon to retain its anti-neuritic properties after baking .

At temperatures in the neighbourhood of 120 ' C. , however , there was a swift destruction of anti-neuritic properties .
This fact has an important bearing where diets are largely composed of preserved and tinned foods previously sterilised at temperatures above 100 ' C. [ \#166 ; Addendum received August 2 , 1917.\#151 ; Since the above paper was written the experiments with yeast extract alluded to on p. 65 have been completed and the results set forth in Table II , above .
The material used was a soluble yeast extract , made up to a solution of convenient strength ; it contained about 35 per cent , of solids and 65 per cent , of water .
As before , the heating was done in a steam autoclave ; the solutions to be heated were placed in large-sized test-tubes , in quantities not exceeding 100 c.c. With this volume of liquid it was .found that there was no significant delay in acquiring the temperature of the autoclave , if the test tube were placed in position while the latter was still cool .
The results obtained offer an interesting comparison with those of Table I above , where the substance heated ( wheat germ ) was comparatively dry ( water content 10 to 14 per cent. ) .
When due allowance is made for the large margin of error inherent in this type of experiment ( see preceding paper , and p. 65 , above ) , the results of Tables I and II are found to be in reasonable accord with one another .
After exposure to 100 ' C. for one hour , slight loss of vitamine is evident in the yeast extract , a greater loss apparently than took place with the wheat embryo at this temperature , see Table I , Expts .
2 and 3 .
This may possibly be due to the excess of water contained in the extract. .
In the neighbourhood of 120 ' C. destruction of the vitamine was rapid in both cases .
