" On some peculiarities of Fcetal Digestion .
" By George Robinson , M.D. Communicated by William Bowman , Esq. , F.R.S. The author endeavours to show , contrary to the assertions of Dr. Robert Lee , that the human foetus , in coimmon with that of all the higher animals , invariably contains , during the latter periods of intra-uterine life , albuminous or nutritious matter , which undergoes digestion in the small intestines .
He finds that the nature of this substance varies very much in different animals .
In the earlier periods of foetal life , the stomachl contains very little , if any , nutritious matter .
He is disposed to consider the salivary glands as the source of the albuminous matter found in the stomach at later periods .
