Determination of the Wave-lengths of the Hydrogen Lines .
33 Summary .
The proteid reaction described by Adamkiewicz is not a furfurol reaction , but depends upon the presence of small quantities of an impurity in the acetic acid employed .
Some specimens of acetic acid yield no reaction , and all may be deprived of chromogenic power by distillation . .
The substance essential to the reaction is glyoxylic acid .
Small quantities of glyoxylic acid are produced during the oxidation of acetic acid by hydrogen-peroxide in the presence of ferrous iron .
Under the conditions used in this research , part of the glyoxylic acid thus formed is split up , yielding formaldehyde .
Glyoxylic acid is slowly formed when acetic acid stands in the air , and more rapidly in the presence of ferrous iron and under the influence of direct sunlight .
Most specimens of acetic acid contain small amounts of glyoxylic acid as an admixture .
A dilute aqueous solution of glyoxylic acid , which may be readily prepared by the reduction of oxalic acid with sodium amalgam , forms an admirable test for proteids when used instead of acetic acid under the ordinary conditions of the Adamkiewicz test .
In carrying out this investigation we have been led to employ extensively the method of oxidation described by H. J. H. Fenton , and as a result we have in some degree trenched upon the systematic study of the oxidation of organic acids which he has in hand .
It is with his consent that such of our observations are published .
The expenses of the research were met by a grant awarded to one of us by the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society .
" Preliminary Determination of the Wave-lengths of the Hydrogen Lines , derived from Photographs taken at Ovar at the Eclipse of the Sun , 1900 , May 28 .

The spectrum of the " flash " obtained in observations of solar eclipses furnishes a method of determining the wave-lengths of the hydrogen series with great accuracy , as these lines are strongly shown and sharply defined .
As the determination of these wave-lengths is somewhat removed from the general subject of eclipse spectroscopy , it seemed suitable for a separate paper .
The following determination is made from four photographs taken near the beginning of totality at Ovar , at the eclipse of 1900 , May 28 , VOL. lxviii .
D Mr. F. W. Dyson .
in the expedition from the Royal Observatory , Greenwich .
The spectroscope used is a four-prism quartz spectroscope , kindly lent by Captain Hills .
The length of the spectrum from ( A 4102 ) to the limit of the hydrogen series ( A 3640 ) is 40 mm. , so that the scale is about 10 tenth-metres to the millimetre .
The spectra were measured with one of the astrographic micrometers of the Royal Observatory ( a micrometer originally designed for ' measuring the photographs taken at the transit of Venus ) by comparison with a glass scale divided to millimetres .
The errors of the 5-mm .
divisions have been accurately determined in the course of investigations of the errors of the reseaux used in the photographic chart of the heavens .
The errors of the intermediate divisions were determined by Mr. Davidson .
The value of one revolution of the screw of the micrometer is approximately ^ mm. The wave-lengths were deduced from the measures by an interpolation formula , derived principally from the following lines , whose wave lengths are taken from Rowland 's tables :\#151 ; Ca ... . . .

3774-473 These lines are the strongest lines in this part of the " flash " spectrum .
In some of the photographs a number of the strongest iron lines were also used as lines of reference .
On the photographs taken a few seconds before the eclipse became total the iron lines are unsuitable as lines of reference , as in some cases both a bright line and an absorption line are seen , and in other cases the lines have a grey appearance , and are not sharp and clear like the lines given above .
The wave-length of h is only derived from one photograph , and is not determined accurately .
The value obtained agrees with the result given by Mr. Wright , * in showing a correction of 0'1 of a tenth-metre to the value given by Rowland .
The intensities of the lines are given somewhat roughly .
With the exception of the cases noted where other lines apparently interfere , the diminution of intensity is sensibly uniform .
A comparison has been made with the wave-lengths given by Balmer 's law , using the formula A = 3646-140 the constant of # \#163 ; Astroph .

Determination of the Wave-lengths of the Hydrogen Lines .
35 which agrees very closely with the wave-lengths of the three lines Ha , H/ s , Hy given by Rowland .
No correction to the formula has " been deduced , as ordy a small one is indicated , and it is desirable to use a larger number of lines of reference than has been employed in this investigation .
The wave-lengths were determined from each series of measures separately , and from the accordance of these the probable errors of the resulting determination of wave-lengths lie between \#177 ; 0-01 and \#177 ; 0-02 of a tenth-metre for the different lines .
