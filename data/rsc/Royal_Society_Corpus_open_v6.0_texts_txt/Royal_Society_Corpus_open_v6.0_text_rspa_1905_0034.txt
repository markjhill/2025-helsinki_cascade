) The calorimeter employed in the following experiments was similar to that described in my paper on " The Scientific Uses of Liquid Air , " * and in an improved form in Madame Curie 's work " Recherches sir les Substances Radio-Actives , " 2nd edition , p. 100 .
A sketch of the apparatus appears in my paper on " The Absorption and Thermal Evolution of Gases Occluded in Charcoal at Low Temperatures .
" !
The arrangement employed consists essentially of a large vacuum vessel capable of holding 2 or 3 litres , into which is inserted a smaller vacuum vessel of 25 to 50 c.c. capacity constituting the calorimeter , the latter being sealed on to a long narrow tube which projects from the mouth of the exterior vessel , in which it is lightly held by a loose packing of cotton wool .
A little below the upper end a branch tube is taken off which conveys the volatilised gas from the calorimeter to the gas receiver .
To the extremity of the projecting tube a small test-tube , to hold the portions of substance experimented on , is attached by a short piece of rather wide rubber tubing which forms naturally a movable joint that can be bent into any position .
With care I have found this valve gives as good results as more elaborate means of securing the dropping of the substances into the calorimeter .
A small vacuum vessel which may contain either solid carbonic acid , liquid ethylene , or liquid air , into which the test-tube is placed , cools the materials to different temperatures below those of the laboratory ; or alternatively the substances may be heated in the vapour of water or other liquids .

It is easy to detect the transference of 1/ 50 of a gramme calorie in the liquid air instrument , whilst 1/ 300 of a gramme calorie can be similarly observed in the liquid hydrogen form of the calorimeter .
In preparing for use a liquid air calorimeter , some 2 litres of old liquid air containing a high percentage of oxygen are poured into the large silvered vacuum vessel , and the calorimeter , filled with some of the same fluid , is immersed therein .
An experiment is conducted by tilting up the little test-tube previously cooled or heated , thereby dropping into the calorimeter a portion of any substance previously weighed .
The substance , if left under normal conditions , in this way falls from the temperature of the room to that of liquid air .
The heat given up by it to the liquid air volatilises some of it , which is carried off by the branch tube and measured in a graduated receiver .
Immediately preceding or following this observation , a similar experiment is made with a small portion of a selected standard substance , namely , lead .
The quantity of lead is so chosen as to produce about the same volume ot gas in the receiver as that supplied by the portion of substance experimented on .
By this means , the circumstances of the two observations are made as similar as possible , and thereby many sources of error are eliminated .
The handling of the instrument has been carefully studied and improved since the earlier experiments .
I find that the vacuum of the calorimeter itself should be a mercury vacuum .
Before inserting the calorimeter into the vessel of liquid air , it should have a good deposit of mercury over its surface , obtained by placing a little liquid air in the interior of the caloii-meter and allowing it to stand for some time .
After a consideiable 1905 .
] Liquid Hydrogen and Air Calorimeters .
quantity of the liquid air in the calorimeter has been volatilised , the boiling point of the remaining portion rises slightly above that of the exterior mass of liquid air , and the liquid over which the volatilised gas is collected is apt to " suck back .
" When this takes place the calorimeter should be emptied and filled anew from the external vessel .
The tube coming from the calorimeter ought to be of the size of wide quill tubing , and the free end of the branch tube should be so arranged below the surface of the liquid in the collecting vessel as to produce no resultant pressure .
With these precautions it is easy to get results accurate to within 2 per cent. The use of pure oxygen has no advantage over that of liquid air which has stood for some days , and thus contains a high percentage of oxygen .
Pure nitrogen cannot be used without taking special precautions to prevent the atmosphere from getting access to the calorimeter , as otherwise the air liquefies and causes great uncertainty in the working of the instrument .
When liquid hydrogen is similarly used , precautions have to be taken to keep air from getting condensed to the solid state in the neck of the calorimeter .
For this purpose , a slow current of dry hydrogen , from an ordinary Kipp apparatus , is kept discharging , partly through the aperture by means of which the bodies fall into the calorimeter , and partly through the tube by which the evaporated hydrogen escapes to the receiver , until everything is ready to make the experiment .
The hydrogen is led in by means of a T-shaped piece of tubing , with a stop-cock attached , placed between the calorimeter and the gas-collecting receiver .
When the body has to be transferred from solid carbonic acid or liquid air to the calorimeter , the following procedure is adopted :\#151 ; It is placed in the small test tube , above the indiarubber joint , which is inserted into a small vacuum vessel containing some of the substance ( solid carbonic acid or liquid air ) , so that at the moment of making the experiment the solid , by a quick vertical movement of the vacuum vessel , is thrown into the calorimeter .
A little cotton wool inserted in the mouth of the vacuum vessel prevents the carbonic acid paste , or liquid air , from being ejected .
Among the sources of error which may occur , the following should be noticed and allowed for .
In dropping a small body from the temperature of the laboratory ( say ) into liquid air , the range of temperature through which the body passes in 1/ 3 or 1/ 4 of a second is some 200 ' .
Some of its heat will be lost to the vapour of the gas in the tube before it reaches the liquefied gas ; and some at its various impacts on the walls of the glass-tubing , as it passes on to the calorimeter .
The consequence of these losses will be to make the quantity of gas measured in the collecting receiver err by defect .
Experiments were made with cooled substances to estimate the effect of a Sir J. Dewar .
Studies with the [ May 25 , similar error in the opposite direction .
It was found that 1 gramme of lead , ejected at the temperature of liquid air into the calorimeter filled with liquid air , absorbed enough heat on its passage to produce 1 c.c. of air in the gas receiver ; roughly , 1 gramme of lead falling through 200 ' into liquid air produced 100 c.c. of air in the receiver ; hence , in this case , the error is within 1/ 2 per cent. A similar observation with diamond gave 1*8 c.c. in comparison with 150 c.c.\#151 ; an error of about 6/ 10 per cent. ; and graphite gave some 4 c.c. in comparison with 300 c.c.\#151 ; an error of about 2/ 3 per cent. Such errors may be neglected in these results .
The observations were reduced by comparison with lead .
The method of comparison has obvious advantages .
Each day when experiments were being made on any substance , a concomitant series was made on lead , so that unknown errors would affect the results equally , and thus produce volumes of gas in the receiver accurately proportional to the quantities of heat carried into the calorimeter .
The choice of the particular metal in question was based on the following considerations:\#151 ; The low specific heat of lead enabled small quantities of heat to be conveyed into the calorimeter while the mass of metal was still considerable ; the variations in the specific heat of lead with temperature are small , and are very nearly a linear function of the temperature ; and lastly this metal is easily obtained very pure .
The values taken for the specific heat of lead were:\#151 ; Between -252''5 and -188 ' , or at -220 ' " 5 , specific heat = O'0280 " -188''0 " - 78* " -133 ' 0 " = 0-0290 " -188'-0 " + 18 ' " - 85'-0 " = 0-0295 From calculations based on these values , an error of a degree in the first of these ranges would only affect the specific heat by 0*000006 ; a similar error in the second range would produce the same variation in the specific heat ; and in the third range the variation would be 0-000004 .
Hence a variation of from 10 ' to 20 ' in any of these ranges would not affect the given values of the specific heat noticeably .
As a selection the following may be taken as typical of the reduction of the diamond results :\#151 ; 1905 .

Further it will be observed that at the lowest temperatures the specific heat of graphite is about three times that of the diamond .
It is also worthy of being recorded that the values of the specific heats of diamond and graphite taken between the temperature of liquid air and boiling hydrogen are far smaller than that of any known solid substance , being even lower than that of any gas taken under constant volume .
Early determinations of the specific heat of carbon in any of its forms showed complete departure from the law of Dulong and Petit .
But all such experiments were in general made over a range of temperature from about the freezing point of water to some two or three hundred degrees Centigrade .
In April , 1872 , Professor H. F. Weber read a paper on the specific heat of carbon before the Chemical Society of Berlin .
I had made experiments on the same subject for the purposes of a paper read on April 1 of the same year before the Royal Society of Edinburgh , a continuation of which was read to the British Association in the following August .
Both of these papers appeared in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' of 1872.f Professor Weber 's observations extended from 0 ' to 200 ' , and led him to the conviction " that the specific heat of carbon in all its allotropic modifications varies to a considerable degree with the temperature .
" This he verified by finding that " the specific heat of the diamond is tripled when the temperature is raised from 0 ' to 200 ' .
" My own investigations at that time consisted of two groups , the first from 20 ' to the boiling point of zinc , taken * This is from \#151 ; 18 ' to - 78 ' in the Ice experiment .

as 1040 ' C. , and the second to the temperature of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe , some 2000 ' C. I found that the mean value of the specific heat of gas-carbon in the first range was 0-32 , and for the second range was 042 , and I added " the true specific heat at 2000 ' must be at least 0-5 ; so that at this temperature carbon would agree with the law of Dulong and Petit .
" In 1875* Professor Weber published results , proceeding by a series of intermediate steps up to 1000 ' , and showing finally " that from the point ( about 600 ' ) at which the specific heat of carbon ceases to vary with increase of temperature , and becomes comparable with that of other elements , any real difference in the specific heats of the two modifications disappears , and carbon obeys the law of Dulong and Petit .
" Professor Weber further showed that the specific heat of carbon , in both its forms , when plotted to temperature as abscissa , produced a curve with a point of inflection in it , like the Old English He foundf the point of inflection at about 60 ' C. for diamond and at about 0 ' C. for graphite .
The results given by Weber lead to the Table .

But in both cases the present results coincide with the trend of the curve as pointed out by Weber for low temperatures .
The Weber formula for the diamond , namely , Specific heat = 0-0947 + 0-000994\#163 ; -0'00000036f2 , if extrapolated , would make the specific heat of diamond vanish about \#151 ; 92 ' C. Behn| gives the specific heat of graphite between \#151 ; 78 ' and \#151 ; 186 ' as 0'075 , which is much higher than the value given in Table II .

The specific heat of ice between the temperatures of liquid air and liquid hydrogen has practically been reduced to about 1/ 3 the value between 0 ' and \#151 ; 78 ' , and has finally only about half the specific 'heat of steam at constant volume .
It would be a matter of interest to investigate the general behaviour of various groups of substances , as regards their specific heats at low temperatures , and without having attempted any careful systematic investigation , the following observations extracted from laboratory records are fairly representative of some classes of bodies .

Two alums , for which Kopp had made some observatious , were included in the research , together with three other typical salts .
Again , naphthaline and paraffin were a pair , whose specific heats were examined ; also the chloride , bromide , and iodide of silver .
The results for the solidified gases , carbonic acid , ammonia , sulphurous acid , were of obvious interest , and several observations on them are given .
With regard to these bodies , it may be noted that the values found are not far removed from those of the specific heats at constant volume in the gaseous state , and I have no doubt that if the experiments had been extended to temperatures between that of liquid air and hydrogen these results would all have been below the gas constant .
The other bodies examined all show diminution of specific heat at the lower temperatures , the most marked examples being the hydrocarbons , paraffin and naphthaline .
An almost endless field of research in the determination of specific heats and other thermal constants is now opened , in which liquid air and hydrogen calorimeters are certain to become ordinary laboratory instruments .

) In the course of my experiments on the specific heat of diamond , graphite , and ice by means of the liquid hydrogen and air calorimeters , the frequent determination of the quantities of gas evaporated by lead in the same circumstances as the diamond , graphite , or ice under investigation afforded means for the direct measurement of the latent heats of hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , and air at their respective boiling points .
The same data for lead* were adopted as were used on the former occasion .
The volumes of gas evaporated had , however , to be reduced to 0 ' C. and 760 mm. of pressure .
If C be the number of cubic centimetres of gas evolved per gramme of lead , measured at 0 ' C. and 760 mm. , while the lead cools from t ' ' to t ' , m the number of grammes mass of gas per cubic centimetre under standard conditions , and s ' the mean specific heat of lead between t ' ' and t ' , then L the latent heat of the gas is given by * Behn ( ' Ann. d.

Considering the great mobility of liquid hydrogen , and its small density , it might be imagined that some spray would get carried up by the hollow enclosing gas bubbles .
If this took place in the experiments , then the latent heat would be too small .
In like manner any solid air carried down from the neck of the calorimeter would have an effect of the same kind .
If , however , the transit of the lead into the liquid hydrogen was impeded by a solid air constriction in the neck then the latent heat would be increased .
In my Bakerian Lecture , * the latent heat of hydrogen was taken to he about 200 units , from which I made the following deduction:\#151 ; " The order of the specific heat of liquid hydrogen has been determined by observing the percentage of liquid that has to be quickly evaporated under exhaustion in order to reduce the temperature to the melting point of hydrogen , the vacuum vessel in which the experiment is made being immersed in liquid air .
It was found that in the case of hydrogen the amount that had to be evaporated was 15 per cent. This value , along with the latent heat of evaporation , gives an average specific heat of the liquid between freezing and boiling point of about 6 .
" The present investigation enables me to correct this statement , the specific heat of the liquid between the boiling and the freezing point in reality being 34 instead of 6 .
It appears , therefore , that hydrogen , instead of following the law of Dulong and Petit , has even in the liquid state an atomic heat of only half the required amount .
In my paper on " The Physical Constants of Hydrogenium/ 'f it was shown that the specific heat of hydrogen absorbed in palladium was about 3'5 .
It seems therefore that hydrogen in the gaseous , the occluded , and the liquid condition , has substantially the same specific heat .
In the Bakerian Lecture , !
I noted for comparison with the specific heat of liquid hydrogen that when liquid nitrogen was similarly treated , " the resulting specific heat of the liquid came out 043 , or about 6 per atom .
" Alt , S in a recent direct determination of this quantity , gives the value 0430 .
This corroboration of the old determination of the specific heat of liquid nitrogen got by the evaporation method , tends to confirm the accuracy of the value now found for the similar constant for hydrogen .
Further corroboration of this value of the latent heat of hydrogen is afforded by Clapeyron 's equation , latent heat = ( v-u)t^- , at * ' Roy .

From some early observations with the helium thermometer on the vapour pressure of hydrogen below its boiling point , I found the Eankine equation logj ?
= 5*5038 Hence , noting that the density of liquid hydrogen at the boiling point is 0*07 , and the specific volume of the gas at the same temperature is about 818*7 c.c. , Clapeyron 's equation gives 120*3 as the latent heat of liquid hydrogen .
A corresponding mean Eankine formula , based on Travers'* smoothed results , gave the latent heat as 119 .
On the other hand , two Willard Gibbs ' equations , calculated from actual observations as evenly distributed as possible , gave the results 123*4 and 117*5 , or a mean of 120*5 .
Thus , while theoretical results seem somewhat lower than those of observation , both point to a value of the latent heat of hydrogen about 121 or 122 gramme-calories .
In the case of nitrogen the observations seem equally good , and we get its latent heat about 50*4 gramme-calories .
Determinations of this quantity by former observers are in very fair accord with this value .
A careful investigation by Fischer and Altf gave 48*9 , and more recently AltJ gives 48*7 at 718 mm. pressure ( \#151 ; 196'*2 ) and 52*07 at 96 mm. pressure ( \#151 ; 210'*05 ) .
Again , ShearerS found in two series of experiments the slightly higher value 49*8 , a result ( he says ) which " agrees very well with that computed from the vapour tension which gives 49*25 .
" From observations of my own on the vapour density of nitrogen between the boiling and melting points , I deduced a Eankine formula , log ^3 = 6*6462\#151 ; which leads to 48*03 for the latent heat of the liquid .
In similar circumstances from Fischer and Alt 's results , I find the value to be 49*65 , while a Willard Gibbs formula from the same observations gives 51*4 .
The ratio of the liquid to the gaseous volume at the boiling point being only 1/ 177 , the correction on this account may be neglected in using Clapeyron 's equation .

337 The value of the latent heat of oxygen is found to be 51T5 gramme-calories , the result of 14 observations , with a possible divergence of half a calorie either way .
Among the most recent determinations of the latent heat of oxygen , Shearer* gives the results of two series of observations as 609 and 6TO , and adds 60-8 as the result of " thermodynamic computation .
" Estreicher , f by an electric method , finds this quantity to be 58 calories per gramme .
These results are so high compared with other determinations that they must be received with some caution .
A direct and careful series of observations by Alt , $ also by an electric method , gives 5 2'07 as the latent heat of oxygen at \#151 ; 182a8 ( pressure 725 mm. ) , rising to 58'85 at \#151 ; 201o,3 ( pressure 68 mm. ) .
Olzewski , Estreicher , and Travers have made observations on the vapour density of oxygen which enable us to calculate its latent heat .
Three Willard Gibbs ' equations were calculated from 01zewski'sS observations between the critical point and the boiling point , from which a mean value of 51'4 was found .
A careful examination and selection from Estreicher's|| three sets of observations between the boiling and the melting point led to a Willard Gibbs equation , from which the latent heat was found to be 52*53 .
From Travers'f smoothed results a series of six Eankine formulae was calculated between 90c*7 and 79'T7 ( absolute ) , from which the mean value of the latent heat was found to be 53*78 .
The ratio of the liquid to the gaseous volume of oxygen at its boiling point being only 1/ 255 , its effect in the Clapeyron equation may be neglected .
As between oxygen and nitrogen it would appear that the former has the greater latent heat , a result to be expected if we rely on the constancy of Trouton 's constant , namely , that the molecular latent heat is proportional to the absolute temperature of the boiling point .
We may determine the ratio of these two latent heats independently of the value of the specific heat of lead , by selecting observations over approximately the same range of temperature , for we have noted how slight is the variation of the specific heat of lead per degree of temperature .
On examining the details of the possible sets of observations that may be compared , I select the set for * * * S * 'Phys .

Studies with the [ May 25 , nitrogen in which a mean of 106-3 c.c. of gas per gramme were given off This , reduced to 0 ' and 760 mm. , became 99-59 c.c. , over a range of temperature from 180-4 to \#151 ; 1950-5 .
Two sets of oxygen observations seem equally good , namely , the first two .
In the former of these the mean volume of gas given off per gramme , reduced to 0 ' and 760 mm. , was 79-38 c.c. , over a range of temperature from 17 ' to \#151 ; 182''5 ; and in the latter 80-34 c.c. were given off in the same standard circumstances over a range from 160,4 to -182'-5 .
Combining these last two with their relative weights of 6 and 3 , we get , putting s ' for the specific heat of lead , and w for the weight of 1 c.c. of hydrogen , L 198'-9 + 2xl99'-5 0 ( 80-34 + 2 x 79-38 ) xl6w* while from the nitrogen observations we have Hence 213'-9 , 99"59 x 14 w 597a9 x 99-59 x 14 213'-9 x 239-10 x 16 = 1-019 .
This result confirms us in the view that the latent heat of oxygen is greater than that of nitrogen .
Similar ratios between the latent heats of hydrogen and oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen are of importance in themselves , having regard to future work , and even although the ranges of temperature may not be coincident , nevertheless the change in the value of the specific of lead will not affect the ratios by much more than about 1 per cent. , supposing we take the specific heat of lead to be the same in both .
Thus , taking two of the longest ranges for temperature , namely , hydrogen from 17 ' to \#151 ; 252'-5 and oxygen from 17 ' to \#151 ; 182'-5 , we get the ratio Lh 16 x 79-58 x 269'-0 x 0-0291 _ 2.3g .
L0 lx 710-78 x 199'-5 x 0-0295 similarly , taking two short ranges , namely , hydrogen from liquid air and nitrogen from solid carbonic acid , we find Lh 14 x 51-46 x 64'*5 x 0*0280 0.g5 Ln lx 162-22 xll7a5x 0-0290 From the former of these with Lo = 51-15 , we get Lh = 121-7 ; and from the latter with LN = 50'4 , we get LH = 118-4 .
The latent heat of air is a quantity whose determination is of a different order from that of either oxygen or nitrogen , seeing that the liquid evaporated Liquid Hydrogen and Air Calorimeters .

] is not always of the same composition , and the composition has not always been noted .
Behn* made a determination of it and found its value to be 50*8 gramme-calories .
But in dealing with this value later in his paper , he takes the composition of the liquid air employed as containing 93 per cent , of oxygen .
This result may , therefore , be more appropriately used as a lower limit to the latent heat of oxygen , and thus far as a corroboration of the present value found for oxygen .
D'Arsonvalf states , without giving any details , that he found the latent heat of air to be 65 calories .
Shearer !
has examined this quantity carefully on two occasions , using the same method each time .
He distinguishes clearly the effects of various compositions .
In his earlier series of experiments he found that for air containing from 21'8 to 72 per cent , of oxygen , the latent heat varied from 44*02 to 51*7 gramme-calories .
In his later series , he found that for air containing from 48 to 90 per cent , of oxygen , the latent heat rose from 50*6 to 59 gramme-calories .
Still more recently Fenner and Richtmyer , S employing Shearer 's method , find that from about the composition of atmospheric air until the mixture contains about 94 per cent , of oxygen the latent heat remains apparently constant at 50*966 , and that then it appears to rise rapidly to 54*10 at 97*6 per cent , of oxygen .
They seem to accept 61 gramme-calories as the latent heat of oxygen , so that the increase from 97*6 per cent , to 100 per cent , is exceptionally rapid .
In the present series of observations , the liquid air employed was old , that is , it was very rich in oxygen .
If therefore we take the density of the air in the gas-receiver as being equal to that of oxygen , we shall have values of the latent heat of liquid air erring by defect .
In the earliest experiment the volume of gas given off was ( at 0 ' , and 760 mm. ) 84*25 c.c. per gramme of lead , from 18'*5 to \#151 ; 184'*5 , whence 0*0295 x 203 ' x 1000 84*25 x 1*43 49*7 .
Similarly in a later case from 17'*9 to \#151 ; 188 ' , the volume per gramme of lead was ( at 0 ' , and 760 mm. ) 79*54 c.c. , whence Lair = 53*41 .
After this , several series of experiments were made in which a succession of half-grammes of lead , 10 or 12 at a time , were dropped into old liquid air .
In one experiment where 12 half-grammes were employed , the mean volume of gas given off per gramme was ( at 0 ' , and 760 mm. ) 76*52 c.c. , and the range of temperature was * * * S * 'Ann .

) ( Abstract .
) The experiments were proposed by Professor Perry , and with his sanction and encouragement extended to more than two years ' continuous work .
The work had for its original object the determination of the explosive properties of compressed mixtures of coal-gas and air .
The main apparatus was designed by Messrs. McDiarmid and Mann , students of the Royal College of Science , South Kensington , and was made before the authors of this paper became connected with the work .
