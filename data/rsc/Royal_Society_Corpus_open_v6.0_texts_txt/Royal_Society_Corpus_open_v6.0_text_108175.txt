Note of Mr. IVORY relating to the correcting of an error in a Paper printed in the Philosophical Transactionsfor 1838 , pp. 57 , &amp;c. IN the paper referred to* it is said , " Let V stand for the integral in the equation ( 7 .
) , and supposing that p and r2 vary so as always to satisfy that equation , we shall have dV ddV d Vdp + -d 0 .
Now the error alluded to consists in having given a wrong sign to the differential dV T-d , the value of which , as has been said , is modified , in the question under consideration , by the equation ( 7 .
) .
This mistake vitiates the concluding part of the paper in pp. 63 , 64 , 65 , as far as relates to the limits of the quantities p and 72 .
M. Lious- , VILLE has done the author of the paper the honour of noticing and correcting the mistake in his Journal de Mathdmatiquesfor April 1839 .
When the sign of the differential is rightly ascertained , the analysis pursued in the paper leads to a simple determination of the limits sought , as this Note will prove , the propriety of printing which in the Philosophical Transactions is submitted to the Council .
For the sake of abridging expressions , put A2 = ( 1 +p2)2 + 22 , P2 ( l + p)2 + r2 ; then ( 1 x2 ) ( 1 p2 2 ) = A2 P2 2 .
By substituting this value in equation ( 7 .
) , V =f-1 2f 3 , dV 1=-3 X4 dX 3 p2 , ' x6 dx 33 A3 f3dxP TdT J+V A5 and hence P2 dV 1 x2 dx ( 1 P X2\2 V+ ''d- " I / ; a13oA Aa / ; which proves that the saime values of p and r2 that make V= 0 , will necessarily dV make d positive .
Further , we have dV .
from which it follows that , whatever positive number 2 stands for , dp is negative for all values of p that make 3+2p p2 positive , that is , for all values of p less than 3 .
The function V is positive when p= 1 ; it is zero when p= 12 and 2= 0 .
And , if we suppose that p decreases from 12 to 1 , while r2 increases from 0 to c &lt; , the differential equlation ( A. ) will in no instance be verified ; because , according to what has been shown , both the terms of the equation will be positive between the limits mentioned .
Thus there is no value ofp less than 12 that will verify the equation ( 7 .
) .
It is proved in the paper ( p. 62 ) that for every assumed value of r2 , there is a positive value of p , that will verify the equation ( 7 .
) ; and , as it has now been shown that the values of p which verify that equation cannot be less than 12 , they mIust be all greater than 12 .
dV Further , in the differential equation ( A. ) , dp cannot be zero ; because , r2 increasing V without limit , TdT .
rd is essentially positive .
Now , for all values of p between 12 dV .
and 3 , dp is negative ; wherefore the same function will continue to be negative in dV the equation ( A. ) for all values of p and r2 : and as dp dp is also negative , dp must be positive , so that p will increase above 12 without limit .
d'V If the sign of dp be changed , the result will be positive ; and hence , observing that x is contained between 0 and 1 , we obtain a condition between any two values of p and r2 that satisfy the equation ( 7 .
) , naniely , the expression ( 3 +p -p2 ) ( 1 +p ) + 22 must be a positive quantity , or , which is the same thing , r &gt; ( p(2 J-p+3 ) 2+ .
