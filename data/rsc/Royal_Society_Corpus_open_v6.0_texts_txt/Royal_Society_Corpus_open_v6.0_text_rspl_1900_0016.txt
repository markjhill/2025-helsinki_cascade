At the outset the object of this investigation was to determine the variation , produced by rise of temperature , in the rigidity-modulus and in the Young 's modulus of wires of different metals , but the observations made for this purpose yielded what seemed to us interesting information as to the viscosity of the substances examined , and led to-an extension of the research .
Heretofore but little attention seems to have been paid to alteration of rigidity with temperature , though j several results , of apparently very different degrees of value , are available for Young 's modulus .
The earliest of these are probably those of Wertheim 's experiments , * but on account of the smallness of the quantities observed it is not possible to regard them as even nearly 3 correct .
Experiments were made about 1870 by P. Kohlrausch and F. E. Loomis , f After referring to the difficulties attending the method J adopted by Wertheim , they remark : " All these difficulties disappear , I however , and at the same time the most accurate method of observa- j tion is obtained , by employing for investigation the torsion elasticity , j whose choice is further to be recommended from the fact that torsion 1 is so generally employed in measurements .
If a wire is loaded with a 3 weight and set in vibration about its vertical axis , the reciprocal value 3 of the square of the time of vibration affords a direct measure for the J coefficient of the torsion of the wire .
Since observations of the period J of vibration are among the most accurate known in physics , the varia- 3 tions of elasticity may be thus determined with all the rigour de-j sirable .
" The authors seem here to indicate that the investigation of torsional j elasticity would yield information to be compared with that obtained 1 by Wertheim for Young 's modulus , and this impression is confirmed | by the remark which occurs later , that the results obtained " show no j trace at all of the remarkable phenomenon of a maximum , alluded to | at the beginning of this article , which would seem to be indicated for | iron by the investigations of Wertheim .

181 bulk-modulus , and it is impossible , except on strict experimental evidence , which has not so far been forthcoming , to suppose that there is any invariable numerical relation between the two latter moduli .
Wertheim , it may be remarked , imagined that he had found evidence of an increase of the Young 's modulus from 0 ' C. to 100 ' C. and a diminution from 100 ' C. to 200 ' C. This result is negatived , as Messrs. Kohlrausch and ' Loomis notice , by the fact that if " two tuning forks are in vibration , and one of them is heated , the number of vibrations changes in the manner demanded by the assumption of a decrease of elasticity for increasing temperatures .
" It was found by Messrs. Macleod and Clarke , * in an experiment on the change of frequency of a tuning fork produced by alteration of temperature , that the period was increased by the fraction 11 x 10~5 for one degree of rise of temperature .
The amount of this change due to expansion was very small in comparison with that due to diminution of the Young 's modulus .
For the linear expansion of steel is about 1-2 x 10~5 per degree , and as the period of a fork is altered in the direct ratio of the square roots of its corresponding linear dimensions before and after the expansion , if there is no change of modulus , the period was augmented by the expansion , by the fraction 0*6 x 10 ' for each degree rise of temperature .
Hence the increase of period due to diminution of the Young 's modulus was about 10'4 x 10 5 for each degree rise of temperature .
And as the period is inversely as the square root of the Young 's modulus , the fractional diminution of the Young 's modulus must have been twice this amount or 20'8 x 10 5 for each degree rise of temperature .
It will be seen below that the change of Young 's modulus for mild steel is , according to our experiments , a diminution of about the same amount , though no doubt the change may be very different for different specimens of material .
In the 'Philosophical Magazine ' for June , 1899 , Mr. G. A. Shake-spear has described an application of an interference method to the investigation of Young 's modulus for wires , and has given values of the temperature-changes found by measurements made in this way .
Thus it was found that the final value of the Young 's modulus was for copper , iron , steel , and hard brass lower at the higher temperature than that at the lower temperature by the respective percentages 3*6 , 1'6 , 3-2 , and 3 .
Also it was noticed that repeated heating and cooling of the specimen seemed to produce an augmentation of the temperature-change of the modulus , the material apparently settling down to a steady state .
The method adopted by Mr. Shakespeare was to elongate the specimen of wire ( which was in each case about 28 cm .
long and 0*75 mm. in diameter ) by applying a weight of about 2 kilos .
The elongation changed the difference of path of two rays from the same source , and * 'Phil .

T"f " Source 182 Prof. A. Gray , Mr. V. J. Blithe , and Mr. J. S. Dunlop .
so produced a change in the number of interference bands , which measured the retardation of one ray relatively to the other .
The elongation was thus measured by the number of interference bands which passed across the field of view of the observing apparatus .
The weight being kept hanging on the -FiGi wire , the temperature was alter-----1-------- i-----------------nately raised and lowered a num-1 j ber of times until the number of bands measuring the change became approximately constant .
It was noticed that the first heating produced a diminution in the number of bands measuring the elongation , and the succeeding !
heatings an increase which finally settled down to a constant value .
] In our experiments the method j adopted was entirely different , i The specimens were wires of radius varying from about 0036 cm .
to 0'06 cm .
, and each had a length of about 5 metres .
The exact dimensions are given in the tables of results below .
The experimental arrangement followed in the case ; of each wire was practically the same .
The wire was hung vertically in the laboratory from a plate at the top screwed firmly to the lower side of a wooden beam in the ceiling .
The upper end was secured by j being passed through a hole in the plate and firmly soldered at the back .
The wire passed along the ; axis of a double-walled tube or jacket ( fig. 1 ) , consisting of two \ coaxial cylinders of tin-plate of diameters 3'5 cm .
and 5 cm .
re- 1 * spectively .
The upper and lower s ends of the jacket were closed by corks , through which the wire loosely passed .
A scale-pan weighing about 4 lbs. was hung on the lower end of the wire to receive weights for the stretching experiments , and served when no other weight was applied to keep the wire taut .

183 Steam was generated under atmospheric pressure in an ordinary boiler , and was led into the upper end of the space by what is called in the diagram the " source-pipe , " while what remained uncondensed escaped by the " sink-pipe " below .
It was found that the space in which the wire hung was thus heated to a fairly uniform temperature .
This temperature was determined by means of four thermo-electric couples of copper and German silver , the arrangement of which is shown in fig. 2 .
A German-silver wire passes along the axial space close to the Fig. 2 .
wire under test , and four copper wires are soldered to it at intervals as shown .
These copper wires are led out along the axial space in which the wire hangs .

An arrangement of mercury cups enables any of the thermal junctions to be brought into the circuit of the galvanometer and the cold junction .
Care is of course taken to ensure that the wires leading from the junctions to the galvanometer are never in contact with the inner wall of the heating jacket or with the wire .
Each thermo-electric couple before use , and from time to time afterwards , was carefully calibrated in the usual way by comparison with thermometers placed with the junctions in water , the temperature of which could be conveniently altered through the range over which the experiments extended .
The results were expressed in curves from which the temperatures of the junctions were obtained in the experiments .
The sensitiveness of the galvanometer was such as to give about eight divisions deflection per degree of difference of temperature .
This arrangement worked satisfactorily ; but in future experiments it will probably be replaced by a platinum thermometer .
Determinations of Young 's Modulus .
Experiments were made for each wire , first as to the variation of Young 's modulus with temperature , next as to the variation of the rigidity modulus with temperature , and , in connection with this latter determination in each case , of the rate of dying out at the different temperatures of torsional oscillations .
The results of the last-mentioned observations are , we think , very interesting , but we give here in the first place the information obtained with regard to Young 's modulus .
A scale-pan , weighing about 4 lbs. , was attached to the wire and loaded to such an extent as not to produce gradual increase of length of the wire .
A small reading-microscope , with a convenient scale in its eye-piece , was rigidly mounted on a heavily loaded table resting on the solid stone floor of the laboratory , and was focussed on the point of a very fine needle soldered to the wire just below the lower end of the heater .
The needle was set so as to be as nearly as possible at the proper end of the scale to give a displacement along the scale when the weight was removed from the wire .
A similar arrangement at the upper end served to determine the amount by which the support yielded with different loads .
This microscope was supported on a horizontal board firmly attached to two massive roof-girders at a distance from the beam to which the wire was suspended .
Enough of the load was then removed to cause the needle to traverse nearly the whole length of the scale , and the readings of the top and bottom microscopes were observed .
A series of readings for weights on and off were first taken at the ordinary temperature of the room , and again after steam had been blown for some time through the heatOn the Effects of Changes of Temperature on Metal .
185 ing jacket .
The temperature of the internal space was observed before and after each series of readings , and in most cases also while the series of operations was in progress .
The distance between the needles was measured at the lower temperature ; the distance at the higher temperature was obtained with sufficient accuracy from the difference of temperature and the result of a determination specially made of the coefficient of linear expansion .of the wire .
This coefficient was determined during the heating of the wire , and , as the change of length was beyond the range of the microscope scale , a scale was fixed behind the lower needle , and the increase of length read off on it by means of a telescope .
The radius of the wire was determined after the wire was finally taken down by means of a micrometer from twenty readings- taken at different points by each of two observers .
In two cases ( wires II and III ) the radius was determined by careful Veighing of the wire in air and in water , and the results so obtained , properly corrected , agreed with those got by the micrometer method to within jly per cent. Experiments were made for the following wires :\#151 ; I , German silver ; II , mild steel ; III , brass ; IY , copper ( commercial ) ; V , copper ( hard drawn electrolytic ) ; YI , soft iron .
At first everything did not work quite smoothly , the arrangement of the microscopes required a little adjustment , and the determinations of moduli for I were somewhat doubtful in point of accuracy , and for II were certainly in error .
The apparatus was , however , got into thorough order before the experiments on III were begun , and those on II were thereafter repeated .
The following is the table of results for Young 's modulus , in which is included the value obtained for German silver , notwithstanding the doubt as to its correctness , and the later value for mild steel , since there were good grounds for rejecting that obtained at first .
The radii given in column YI were calculated for the higher temperatures from the expansions observed .
The results of three separate determinations are given for the wire of soft iron ( YI ) .
Each elongation was obtained from the mean of about ten separate observations , agreeing to less than 0*5 of a microscope division .
The elongations were obtained in microscope divisions , the value of which was 0-005948 cm .
The difference between the second and third values of the coefficient of diminution for soft iron and the first of the three values , depends upon 0*2 of a microscope division .
The degree of accuracy to which the deflections could be read was to 0*1 of a division .
The lower value , 0-000136 , is probably more nearly correct than the higher , 0-000197 .
Comparing the results with those obtained by Mr. Shakespeare , reduced for comparison , we have for steel 0*000247 as against his 0*00038 , for brass 0*000373 as against 0*000352 , for copper ( electro186 Prof. A. Gray , Mr. Y. J. Blithe , and Mr. J. S. Dunlop .

The difference between the coefficients for commercial copper ( which was ordinary copper wire of the kind used by bell-hangers ) and electrolytic copper is very great , but it is not more striking than the difference between the electric conductivities of the two materials .
It was thought desirable to make a series of determinations for soft iron with the view of finding whether any progressive change due to alternate and repeated heating and cooling disclosed itself as in Mr. Shakespear 's experiments .
Nothing of the nature of change of sign ( see Mr. Shakespear 's paper ) was observed , though there was some indication of a diminution of the coefficient .
Experiments on the Rigidity Modulus , and Observations on the Internal Viscosity of the Wires .
Experiments were made on each wire , as has been stated above , to determine the change of rigidity produced by the alteration of temperature .
These experiments were made by the torsional oscillation method .
Cylindrical vibrators were attached to the wires such that the moment of inertia of the vibrating system was practically that of the cylinder only ; and observations were made for each wire with two separate vibrators of different weights , except in the cases of German silver and steel , for which one vibrator only was used , and electrolytic copper , for which four vibrators were used .
The length of wire used was , with the vibrator attached , about 505 cm .
in each case .
The lengths and radii at the different temperatures were calculated from the expansions as in the Young 's modulus experiments .
The results of the experiments are given in the following table:\#151 ; 188 Prof. A. Gray , Mr. V. J. Blyth , and Mr. J. S. Dunlop .

189 0-000447 and 0-000428 respectively .
The result given above for commercial copper agrees also moderately well with that obtained by these experimenters , viz. , 0-000520 .
But here , as indeed in all the substances examined , the differences in results are not surprising , in view of the probable difference of composition of the specimens .
The great excess of the coefficient in the case of hard-drawn pure copper above the value for commercial copper is very noteworthy .
It will be interesting to examine , as we propose to do immediately , the behaviour of copper wire soft drawn as well as hard , and to trace the effect , if any , of repeated heating and cooling .
It was noticed that the rate of dying out of the torsional oscillations was very different at the different temperatures , being , except in one case , that of German silver , very much more rapid at the higher temperature than at the lower .
This is undoubtedly the effect of a considerable increase of the internal viscosity of the wire with rise of temperature , for no practical difference existed in the immediate surroundings of the vibrator , which of course was the part mainly affected by the air in the vibrations .
The top of the cylindrical vibrator in each case was about 8 cm .
below the lower end of the heater , and the length of the cylinders , which were of brass , varied from 7 to 13 cm .
There was no appreciable change of the air-temperature at the vibrator produced by the heater .
This difference in the rates of subsidence of the torsional oscillations seems to us very remarkable , and , so far as we know , has not been observed before .
It is shown in the diagrams numbered I\#151 ; YI .
[ Note added June 20 , 1900.\#151 ; The change in rate of subsidence produced by alteration of temperature had , we have since found , been observed by Streintz and by Pisati ( 'Pogg .

In the first and last papers here cited , \ Streintz gives an account of his own work and of that of Pisati , principally as bearing on the effect which he called " Accommodation .
" In certain wires , e.g. , steel , copper , silver , brass , and platinum , examined by Streintz and Pisati , a marked diminution of rate of subsidence was produced by keeping the wire for a considerable time in continual torsional oscillation .
This is contrary to results .

Since learning of the investigations here referred to , we have begun I to extend our experiments to the question of " fatigue of elasticity , " r and have found that the rate of subsidence appears to be , in some I cases at least , a function of the temperature and of the amplitude of I vibration .
It seems possible thus to reconcile the discordance of re- : : suits thus referred to , and we hope to make a communication on the l subject at an early date .

In each curve the abscissae are amplitudes of vibration in degrees , and the ordinates , which are drawn downwards in each case , are the numbers of swings that have been completed from the instant at which the amplitude was 80 ' , the largest amplitude of swing used in the observations of periods .
The temperatures are marked on each diagram for the several curves .
Curves ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of diagram ( I ) represent Diagram I. Germ\amp ; n silver .
Curve the observations made in German silver at the lower and higher temperatures respectively , stated in the diagram .
It will be seen that the rate of dying out of the amplitude is distinctly faster at the lower than at the higher temperature .
The reverse was found to be very markedly the case in all the other wires examined .
In mild steel at 17 ' C. the oscillation , as shown by the curves of diagram II , has fallen from 80 ' to about 55 ' in 20 periods , while at 89-4 ' C. the amplitude has fallen to 40 ' in the same time .
After 60 periods the amplitudes were respectively 25 ' and 13 ' .
The logarithmic decrement is practically constant during the subsidence at the lower temperature .
At the higher temperature the logarithmic decrement diminishes in the ratio of about 75 to 60 .

Curves ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of diagram III give the the first two sets of results , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) the second .
It will be seen that the subsidence with the heavier vibrator was more rapid at each temperature than with the lighter vibrator .
The logarithmic decrements are practically constant throughout each of the two curves .
A question arises here , which further experiments are being made to answer for the different wires , as to the effect of repeated heatings and coolings on the rate of dying out at any one temperature 1 Some effects of this kind appear to be visible in the results obtained for one or two of the other wires experimented on .
Three pairs of curves are given in diagram IV(\#171 ; ) for commercial copper , and were obtained with a 3-4 lb. , a 12*7 lb. , and an 18-7 lb. vibrator respectively , and in this order .
Here it will be seen that the .frate of subsidence is greater with each vibrator in the order of its Weight ; that is , the larger weight in each case corresponds to a greater rate of subsidence , whether the temperature be the higher or lower of those used in the experiments .

193 sidence is in each case greater at the higher temperature than at the lower .
It was observed by Lord Kelvin that increase of period as well as increase of stretching force affected the rate of subsidence , these effects being opposite .
The effect of increase of stretching force increased the rate of subsidence .
The effects of increased mass of vibrator given here are therefore mainly those due to increase of pull in the wire .
We are , however , arranging to alter the period without altering the pull , and to alter the pull without changing the period , by using suitable vibrators .
There is one characteristic of these curves for commercial copper which was shown also in the case of soft iron , but which does not appear in the other experimental results .
The falling off of amplitude goes on very quickly in curves ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in such a way that the curves are almost straight lines , until the amplitude has come down to only some 3 or 4 degrees , and then the subsidence becomes comparatively slow .
The curves for the 3 lb. vibrator show at the low temperature a logarithmic decrement increasing in the ratio 27 to 60 as the amplitude falls from 80 ' to 24 ' .
At the higher temperature the logarithmic decrement is practically constant .

Diagram V(a ) gives the rates of subsidence for pure electrolytic copper at temperatures 23'2 ' and 92'1 ' with the 3 lb. vibrator .
Here there is no sign of the change of character of the curves of subsidence at low amplitudes which has just been noticed .
The curve of subsidence at the higher temperature is indeed nearly an exponential curve at all amplitudes less than 20 ' .
The curve for the lower temperature shows a logarithmic decrement at first somewhat quickly , p 2 194 Prof. A. Gray , Mr. V. J. Blithe , and Mr. J. S. Dunlop .

The initial and final values are in the ratio of 73 to 44 .

It will be observed that the curves of subsidence are nearly alike in the two sets V(b ) and V(c ) , only a very slight difference in the direction of faster subsidence with the heavier vibrator being visible .
The curves of subsidence at the higher temperature with the 24'7 lb. vibrator show distinctly more rapid subsidence at the lower temperature than in any of the other three cases .
Diagram VI shows the curves of subsidence for soft iron .
Curves ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were obtained with the 12*7 lb. vibrator ; the former curve gives the subsidence at the lower temperature , the latter at the higher temperature stated in the diagram .
It will be observed that the rate of subsidence at the higher temperature is very much greater than at the lower .
These two sets of experiments were made in direct succession to one another on May 15 .
Next , on May 16 , two sets of experiments at temperatures 15''6 and 93''8 C. were made with the 18'7 lb. vibrator .
The results of these are shown in curves ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .
Between these curves there is a much smaller difference than between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , though the temperatures were very nearly the same .
The high-temperature experiments were repeated on both days with reproduction of practically the same curve .
After twenty-four hours nearly had elapsed the experiments at the lower temperature were repeated with the same vibrator , when the rate of subsidence was found to be much slower at 13'-5 C. than it had been on the previous day at 15'*6 C. On May 18 two curves ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) were obtained with the 24'7 lb. vibrator at the respective temperatures 16 ' C. and 950,1 C. Curve ( 6 ) does not differ very widely from the curve ( 4 ) obtained on May 16 with the 18'7 lb. vibrator ; but the curve at the lower temperature lies much to the right of that ( 3 ) obtained on May 16 at the lower temperature , the companion curve of ( 4 ) .
All the results in curves ( 3)\#151 ; ( 6 ) show rates of subsidence lying between those shown in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
Curve ( 1 ) is approximately exponential .
It will be observed also that curves ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) show the somewhat rapid change of direction when the amplitudes have become small to which attention is directed above in connection with commercial copper .
Curve ( 6 ) , however , obtained at 95*1 ' C. with the 24'7 lb. vibrator , shows no such change of direction ; but a considerable part of its curve , after the amplitude has been reduced to about 10 ' C. , is approximately exponential in character .
All the curves except ( 1 ) and ( 4 ' ) , however , show very marked diminution of rate of subsidence at the lower amplitudes .

In a former paper* we described experiments on the electrical qualities of specimens of glass of which the chemical composition was determined by analysis .
Results were given for a lead-potash glass made by Messrs. Powell and Sons , of London , a lead-potash glass made by Messrs. Schott and Co. , of Jena , a barium glass , and a zinc-soda glass ( " Jena glass " ) , both made by Messrs. Schott and Co. These * ' Roy .
