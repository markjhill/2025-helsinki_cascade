" Researches on Refraction-Equivalents .
" By J. H. GLADSTONE , Ph. D. , F , R.S. Received May 29 , 1868 .
Since the paper of the Rev. T. Pelham Dale and myself " On the Refraction , Dispersion , and Sensitiveness of Liquids " ' , our researches have been continued from time to time , and a good deal of attention has been paid to the subject in Germany .

] 439 energy of a body , notwithstanding change of temperature , aggregate condition , solution , or even chemical combination , has been confirmed , and upon this has been built the doctrine of Iefraction-equivalents .
Our " specific refractive energy " is the refractive index of any substance minus unity , divided by the density ; in symbolic language d. Professor Landolt 's " Refraction-equivalent " is the same multiplied by the chemical equivalent , or P dThe largest generalization arrived at is that the refraction-equivalent of a compound is the sum of the refraction-equivalents of its constituents .
This has been sufficiently proved in a multitude of instances among the compounds of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen , and it has been shown , or assumed to be the case , in the combinations of many other elementary bodies* .
My more recent researches have branched off into several lines , but an especial attempt has been made to answer the following questions .
Have any of the elements more than one definite refraction-equivalent ?
and what are the refraction-equivalents of the metallic elements ?
A large mass of observations bearing on these points has been gathered together , and more or less collated , but it is yet imperfect , and my present object is rather to indicate the principal method of inquiry than to publish the actual results .
As the metals are opaque , their refractive indices cannot be determined in a direct manner as those of gaseous hydrogen , liquid phosphorus , crystallized carbon , and other transparent elements have been .
An attempt must therefore be made to determine their effect on the rays of light by examining their compounds ; but their crystalline salts are very frequently doubly refracting , owing to some peculiarities of internal structure , and , where they give only one spectrum , there are practical ( ifficulties about the experiment that are not encountered in dealing with liquid bodies .
The solutions of these salts have only one refraction , and it occurred to me that they might afford an easy means of determining the refraction-equivalents , first , of the compounds themselves , and secondly , of their metallic and other constituents .
In practice , many sources of error presented themselves , all of which tell upon the ultimate result , and which necessitated improved apparatus , and great care both in preparing the solutions and in taking the observations .
The method generally adopted was as follows:-An amount of salt representing the chemical equivalent was dissolved in n equivalents of water , and the refractive index and density of the solution were taken .
From these was reckoned the refraction-equivalent , and subtracting from this n times the refraction-equivalent of water for the solar line A , there remained the refraction-equivalent of the dissolved salt for that part of the spectrum .
That this fairly represents the action exerted on light by the chemical compound itself is supported by several considerations .
1st .
In the few cases , such as chloride of sodium and sugar , where the refractionequivalent of the substance has been obtained , both in the solid and dissolved condition , it is found to be the same .
2nd .
Solutions of several organic substances , such as formic and citric acids , give the theoretically correct equivalent for these substances .
3rd .
The refraction-equivalent of a salt seems to be the same , whether it be dissolved in water or in alcohol .
4th .
The refraction-equivalent of a salt in solution is not affected by altering the amount of water in which it is dissolved .
5th .
The numbers reckoned for these salts in solution bear such a remarkable relation to one another as to force the conviction that they are made up of two components , the one depending on the metal , the other on the substance combined with it .
To exhibit the nature and force of this argument , it would be necessary to tabulate a long series of results ; but for the present I shall confine myself to the salts of potassium and sodium with the corresponding hydrogen compounds .

From the above numbers several conclusions may be safely drawn .
First , it is evident that the refraction-equivalents of the compounds of potassium differ very widely according to the nature of the electro-negative constituents ; again , that the refraction-equivalents of the compounds of sodium differ pari passu with those of the potassium compounds , being always less by a number varying from 3'0 to 3'9 .
From this it may be fairly concluded that the electro-negative constituent has the same effect on light , whichever metal it is united with , and that the refraction-equivalent of potassium exceeds that of sodirum by 3'4 , or thereabouts .
But does the Table afford the data for determining the absolute equivalent of one or other of these metals ?
It was at first thought that this would be arrived at by a comparison of the metal with hydrogen , the refraction-equivalent of which has hitherto leen estimated at 1'3 ( or 1'5 in the case of water ) ; but the last column shows that the ( lifference letween potassium and hydrogen is not always the same , the differences being greater than can be attributed to errors of observation .
Inldeed the numbers seem to fall into two groups : with the mineral acids the differences lie between 4'0 and 4'7 , while with water , alcohol , and the organic acids , they are always upwards of 6 , varying indeed from 6'2 to 6(8 , the average being 6'55 .
But it is in these last-mentioned compounds that the equivalent of hydrogen is believed to be 1'3 .
Assuming this , we may reckon the refraction-equivalent of potassium to be about 6.55+1'3 , that is , 7'85 .
We have , however , other means of arriving at an estimation .
Chlorine , in such bodies as chloroform or tetrachloride of carbon , is represented by 9'8 .
Again , cyanogen , from the experiments of Dulong on the gas itself , may be taken at 9-2 Sulphur has a refraction of 16'0 ; hence sulphocyanogen may be reckoned as 16'0+9 2 , that is , 25'2 .
Subtracting these numbers from those of the respective potassium salts , we obtain the equivalent of the metal .

The mean of the first four computations is 8*2 , that of the last four 7'8 .
Perhaps , pending fiirther researches , it will be best to assume the mean of these numbers , Potassium ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..= 80 ; 44.2 [ June 18 , and since a sodium salt has a refraction-equivalent generally 3*4 lower than the corresponding potassium salt , we may reckon Sodium..=6* ... ... ... ... ... ... . .

0'200 This implies that equal quantities of these two analogous metals exert very nearly , if not precisely , the same effect on the velocity of the rays of light .
Another deduction from the above Table is that already alluded to in regard to hydrogen ; while in the organic acids it probably has the known refraction-equivalent 1*3 , it would seem that in the others , viz. hydrochloric , hydrobromic , hydriodic , nitric , metaphosphoric , and sulphuric acids , it has a very much higher refraction-equivalent , one in fact which is little less than sodium , and falls short of potassium by only about 4'3 .
Hence we may we deduceHydrogen in organic compounds ... .

It appears , however , to answer in the affirmative the question whether an element can have more than one definite refraction-equivalent .
Of course , from the Table given above , it would be easy to deduce values for each of the electro-negative constituents ; but it would be safer to generalize from a larger number of instances .
The series of observations on potasisum and sodium salts are the most complete and the most carefully revised of any which have yet been made ; but if their refraction-equivalents are fixed , it becomes a much simpler matter to determine those of most other metals .
Thus , of lead the nitrate and acetate have alone been examined ; but as the refraction-equivalents reckoned for these salts differ from those of the corresponding potassium compounds in each instance by 4'1 , the presumption is great that the refraction-equivalent of lead is very near 80 +4 1 , or 12 1 .
The following are numbers deduced from two or more salts of each metal .
They must be looked upon only as approximately true , and any subsequent modification of the value 8'0 for potassium , must lead to a corresponding modification of the whole series .
