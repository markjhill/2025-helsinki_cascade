1* DR. HALLEY'S method of computing the ratio bf the diameter of the circle to its circumference was considered by himself , and other learned mathematicians , as the easiest the problem admits of .
And although , in the course of a centuryy much easier methods have been discovered , still a celebrated mathematician of our own times has expressed an opinion , that no other aliquot part of the circumference of a circle can be so easily computed by means of its tangent as that which was chosen lie Dr. HALLEY , rriz .
the arch of 3o degrees .
This opinion , whether it be just or not , I shall not now inquire- ; my present design being to show , honv the series by which Dr. HALLLY computed the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of the circle , may be transformed into others of swifter convergellcy , and which , on account of the successive powers of IIO which occur in them , admit of an easy summation .
2 This transformation is obtained by means of difFerent forms in which the fluents of some flalxions may be expresseclO To proceed with the greater clearness , I will here set down the fluxion in a general form , and its fluent , in the two series which are used in the following particular instance , and may be applied with advaxltage in siinilar cases .

which series , being of the simplest form which the fluent seems to admit , was first discovered , and probably is the most generally useful .
But it has also been found , that the fluent of the same fluxion may be expressed in series of other forms , which , though less sinlple than that above written , yet have their particular advantages .
Amongst those other forms of series hich the fluent admits ofg that which suits my present 9 .
With respect to the indices m and n , as they are here sup posed to be affirmative whole numbers , and will be so in the use I am about t(3 make of them , the reader need not be detained with arly observations on the cases in which these fluents will fail , when the indices have contrary signs .

It may be proper further to remark , that by putting , z xn = zs and calling the first , second , third , &amp;c. terms of the series xm nxmf t+t 28 ttn+211 3+ &amp; c S.l-X ' m-m+^t .

I come now to the transformation proposed , which will appear very easy , as soon as the comm-on series , expressing the length of an arch in terms of its tangent , is properly arranged .
If the radius of a circle be , and the tangent of an arch of it be called t , it ls well known that the length of that arch will be = t3 +57+p t , + &amp; C. Now , if the affirmative terms of this series be written RI1 one line , and the negative ones in another , the arch will be ft+5+9 +,3 + 17 + aCo _oi t3 t7 tIl tl5 t9i_ &amp; C t37tI IS 19 And if , again , the first , third , fifth , &amp;c. term of each of these series be writtell ila one line , arid the second , fourth , sixtla , &amp;c. in anot'ller , the surne arch will be expressed thus : ; t ++-+-+ 33 + &amp; G. g3 t5 + tl3 + tz +t+t+ aC .

Ill each of these series the value of rin the first series , is 1 ; | in the second series , is 5 ; 8 1S 8 ; and the value of m , &lt; .
