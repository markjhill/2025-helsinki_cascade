Observations on the heights of places in the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain , and upon the Latitude of Arbury Hill .
By B. BEVAN , Esq. Communicated by Sir H. DAVY , Bart. P. R. S. Read May 23 , 1822 .
THE Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain having from time to time engaged the attention of the Royal Society , and circumstantial particulars of this great national undertaking having occupied the pages of the Philosophical Transactions , I beg leave to submit a few observations on that subject to the consideration of the Society .
The result of the survey , relative to the different sections of the meridian , in this country , has not altogether proved so satisfactory as might have been expected .
I have lately examined the calculations affected by the observations made at Arbury Hill in the county of Northampton , with some hope of discovering the means of reconciling the anomaly in that part of the meridian .
I have been at the expense of having the height of this station determined by accurate levelling to the Grand Junction Canal , from which , and the known difference of level of the various canals connected with this , I have been able to find the relative height of this station , with most of the important objects in the counties of Northampton , Buckingham , and Bedford .
From this operation of levelling , I found the country to the north of Arbury station , suddenly to fall about 400 feet , and continue at this depressed state for 9 or io miles .
Such a defect of matter , to the north of the station , was in itself a strong ground for supposing a deflection of the plumb-line to the southward .
To ascertain if this supposition were supported by the trigonometrical operations , I calculated the latitude of Arbury station , from the latitude of Blenheim , as determined by previous observation , independent of any astronomical observation made at Arbury , and find it 5 seconds LESS than shown by the zenith sector ; giving countenance to the probability of local attraction by the high land to the south of the station , which will appear by the following calculation ; in Trigonometrical Survey , Vol. 2 , p. 137 , the latitude of Blenheim by observation is stated as 51 50 ' 24'".9 or nearly 51 50 25 " The measured distance , on the meridian , from Blenheim to Arbury , is 139822 , deduced from Vol. 2 , part 2 , p. 107 ; dividing this distance by 60881.7 , according to a table in Vol. i , part I , page 168 , corresponding to the middle latitude between Blenheim and Arbury , and multiplying the quotient by 1o .
we obtain the difference of latitude -2 , t 58 " .
this quantity added to -51 50 5 gives for the latitude of Arbury 2 13 23 being 5 ' less than by the zenith sector .
It is true that Colonel MUDGE corrected the latitude of Blenheim , from the Trigonometrical Survey , to 5ยง 5o ' 28 " , and in this case the computed latitude of Arbury would come out near 3 seconds less than found by the zenith sector .
In Vol. a , part i , page 118 , the latitude of Arbury , as derived from Dunnose meridian , is given 52ยง 13 ' 26".6 afterwards 52 13 28.2 from observation* 1.6 or 1 .
second south of the observed latitude ; all concurring , to prove that the observed latitude by zenith sector falls to the north of the calculated , or that the deflection of the plumb-line was to the SOUTH : taking , therefore , the table above referred to in Vol i , part i , p. 168 , and considering the latitudes of the following stations to be as below : Dunnose 51 ?
s7 ' 7( Greenwich 5 28 39s Blenheim 51 50 28Arbury 52 1I 26Clifton -53 27 o and calculating the length of a degree , in their respective middle points , they will be found to correspond with the said table , and maintain a regular increase to the northward , agreeing with the assumed general figure of the earth : the above assumption indicates an error of 1 o0 " at Clifton and i at Arbury , neither of which is more than might be expected from the visible inequality of the contiguous land .
The result of the operations north of Clifton I have not had an opportunity of ascertaining ; but it appears to me that a few more observations by the zenith sector , at other stations , would remove much of the apparent ambiguity at present attached to this interesting question .
Knowing the goodness of the instrument used in the Survey , and the great skill and attention observed by the persons engaged , I have great confidence in the general result of the terrestrial department .
I should have been doubly gratified if I could have said as much on the determination of the heights of the stations .
Availing.myself of the levels through a long district of the Grand Junction Canal , I have been at the trouble of levelling from the following stations , viz. Wendover Down , Kensworth , Bowbrick Hill , and Arbury Hill , to the nearest point of the said Canal , and thus , by means of the known level of the different parts of the Canal , to obtain the relative heights of the above mentioned stations .
And as a comparison will be more readily made from a table of heights expressed in positive numbers , I shall assume the highest point of the summit of said Canal to be 402 feet above the level of the sea , at low water spring tides ; with this assumption , the heights of the several stations , in feet , above low water mark , will be as follows : Wendover Station 861 Kensworth ditto -8092 Bowbrick Hill 571 Arbury Hill -740 The heights of these Stations published in the Philosophical Transactions , are as below : in Vol. 3 , page 302 .
Wendover ------905 Kensworth --904 Bowbrick Hill -683 Arbury Hill 804 these will average about 78 feet higher than in the table above .
I have also levelled from the summit of the Regent 's Canal , to the mouth of the fixed cannon at King 's Arbour , or the upper end of the base on Hounslow Heath , and upon the same data this point will be 90o feet above low water mark .
76 In Vol. i , p. 173 , Colonel MUDGE gives 91 ?
for its height , which differs only by half a foot .
But at page 266 it is stated to be 118 feet , being 27 feet above the proper height .
Again in Vol. 3 , p. 307 , it is stated to be 13 feet , or 414 too high .
The grounds of my assumption of 402 feet being the height of the Grand Junction Canal summit , near Tring , are these : The range of tide , from low water spring tides at sea , to high water near Somerset House , I presume to estimate 19I feet ; from this point to the Regent 's Canal summit will be found 83 ' feet ; from this level I apply the revised section of the Grand Junction Canal = 299j to the summit near Tring , making together 402 feet as above .
From these .
levels it will appear , that Wendover Station above Brickhill is 861 -571 -_ 289 .
Colonel MUDGE'S numbers give -905683 222 67X error .
Arbury above Brickhill 740+---571 = 69 Colonel MUDGE 804 -683 -=121 Error 52 Wendover above Arbury 861740 -= 120o Colonel MUDGE 905--804 = 101 Error 192 Some fresh observations with the zenith sector made at Blenheim , and Sutton , would offer a fine check to the latitude of Arbury ; and also at Highbeach , and Botley Hill , a check to the latitude of Greenwich would be readily obtained .
