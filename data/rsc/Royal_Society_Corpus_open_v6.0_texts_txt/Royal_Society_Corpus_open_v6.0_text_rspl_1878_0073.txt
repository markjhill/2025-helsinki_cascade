The iodide was agitated in the cold for some time with a weak solution of bromide of iodine , * the excess of bromide was separated , and the product was washed with dilute potash .
On subjecting this to distillation almost the entire quantity passed over between 130 and 165 ' C. On fractioning I obtained a large quantity of fluid distilling between 140 and 148 ' , most between 142 and 144 ' .
The following equation explains the formation of this compound : CH3 ch3 | + BrI= | +11 .

1 1-82 Brom-iodide of ethylidene is nearly colourless when freshly prepared .
It has a sweet taste , and distils without decomposition between 142 and 144 ' C. This is about 20 degrees lower than the boiling point of its isomer , the brom-iodide of ethylene ( 163 ' C. ) .
It refuses to become solid even when surrounded with a mixture of ice and salt , differing in this respect also from its isomer .
Heated with alcoholic potash it yielded a volatile vapour containing bromine , probably bromide of vinyl , and iodide of potassium .
This body is probably identical with those obtained by Pfaundlerf and by ReboulJ by exposing bromide of vinyl to the action of hydri-odic acid .
The boiling points of their compounds agree pretty well with each other and also with mine .
I am at present engaged in studyiug the behaviour of these compounds towards several reagents .
I have to thank my young pupil , Mr. Harrington , for his valuable assistance during the progress of this research .

] the Vapours of the Chlorides of Thallium and Lead .
427 to ascertain the specific gravity of vapours at a high temperature that , in spite of the interest which attaches to this subject , but few additions have been made in our knowledge in this direction since the researches of Deville and Troost .
The present experiments , of which this notice contains the first results , have been made with the object of so simplifying the process as to render it easy to determine the specific gravity of the vapours of bodies possessing high boiling-points with a degree of accuracy sufficient for the purpose of controlling their molecular weights .
The method consists in vaporizing the substance under examination in long-necked glazed porcelain globes of known capacity placed in a muffle raised to bright redness .
The temperature of the globe is ascertained by a calorimetric determination made with heavy platinum weights placed in the muffle , this determination being checked by the simultaneous insertion in the muffle of a second globe containing mercury .
The porcelain globes having a capacity of about 300 cub. cen-tims .
, and containing from 3 to 9 grams of substance , are closed by loosely fitting stoppers of baked clay , and then gradually introduced in the muffle .
After remaining there until no further escape of vapour is observed , and until the temperature has become constant , the globes are quickly withdrawn from the muffle and their contents removed and analysed , the temperature being in each case ascertained by the calorimetric method at the time of withdrawal of the globe .
The following determinations of the specific gravity of mercury vapour serve to show the reliability of the method : Temperature determined Specific gravity of calorimetrically .

Before determining the specific gravity of the vapour of thallium chloride it was ascertained that this compound does not give off free chlorine when volatilized at a red-heat , and that the sublimate contains thallium and chlorine in the atomic ratio of equality .
In each experiment the total amount of thallium and of chlorine remaining in the globe was determined by analysis , and the specific gravity calculated from their sum .

Four determinations of the specific gravity of mercury vapour made simultaneously with four of the above experiments gave as a mean the number 6*0 instead of 6*728 .
The specific gravity of the vapour of lead chloride was made in a similar way , but the temperature required for complete volatilization is much higher than that needed in the case of the last compound .
The residue left in the globes was completely soluble in hot water , and contained lead and chlorine in the proportion of one atom of the former to 2*08 of the latter .
