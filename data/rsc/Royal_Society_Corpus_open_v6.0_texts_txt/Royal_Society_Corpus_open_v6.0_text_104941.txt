An Account of the Impression on a Stone dug up in the Island of Antigua , and the Quantity of Rain fallen there for Four Years : In a Letter from the Reverend Mr. Francis Byam to William Fauquier , Esq ; F. R. S. Dear Brother , Antigua , March 31 , 1755 .
AS you have the honour to be a member of the Royal Society , I have sent you , by Captain Barrett , in a box directed for you , what I esteem to be a great curiosity .
It is a stone , that was brought from a quarry , for a building in the town : the quarry is in the side of a mountain , and is about three hundred yards higher than high-water mark , and about two miles from the sea .
When the mason struck it with his hammer , it split in two , and discovered the exact portraiture of a fish ( on each stone ) which we call an old wife .
( PLATE IX .
) I have likewise sent you an account of the quantity of rain , that has fallen in this place for four years last past .
Read Dec. 11 , past .
Had I had such an instrument , as Mr. Derham had , to measure the hundredth part of an inch , it would have increased the quantity greatly ; but I have only taken notice of it when it amounted to the tenth part of an inch .
My instrument is very simple and plain ; it is a tin vessel about thirteen inches high , the aperture at top is four inches and an half square , the bottom the same ; the opposite sides parallel to each other .
It stands in my garden , free from the drippings of any trees or houses , and raised upon a pedestal , about two feet from the ground .
You will observe ax in September 51 , and September 54 .
In these months we had hurricanes .
If any thing of this kind would be agreeable to you , or the Society , I shall take great pleasure in communicating them , when in my power .
I am , dear brother , Your affectionate brother , March 31 , 1755 .
F. Byam .
