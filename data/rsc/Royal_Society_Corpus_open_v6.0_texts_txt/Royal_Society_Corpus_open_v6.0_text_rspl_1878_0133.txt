" On certain means of Measuring and Regulating Electric Currents .

] The dynamo-electric machine furnishes us with a means of producing electric currents of great magnitude , and it has become a matter of importance to measure and regulate the proportionate amount of current that shall be permitted to flow through any branch circuit , especially in such applications as the distribution of light and mechanical force .

] Measuring and Regulating Electric Currents .
293 s On .
the 19th of June last , upon the occasion of the Soiree of the Resident of the Royal Society , I exhibited a first conception of an prangement for regulating such currents , which I have since worked let into a practical form .
At the same time , I have been able to ^4ja\gt ; lize a method by which currents passing through a circuit , or ^*i anch circuit , are measured , and graphically recorded .
% .
It is well known that when an electric current passes through a inductor , heat is generated , which , according to Joule , is propor- ; onate in amount to the resistance of the conductor , and to the iaJhuare of the current which passes through it in a unit of time , or imk- .
" H=C*R . !
ji I propose to take advantage of this well-established law of electrodynamics , in order to limit and determine the amount of current J assing through a circuit , and the apparatus I employ for this pur-id iose is represented on figs. 1 to 3 , Plate 4 , of the accompanying J Irawings .
Letters of reference to the principal parts of the instru-im nent are given on the foot-note of the drawing .
nj I The most essential part of the instrument is a strip ( A ) of copper , in ron , or other metal , rolled extremely thin , through which the current to be regulated has to pass .
One end of this thin strip of metal i. s attached to a screw ( B ) , by which its tension can be regulated ; it then passes upwards over an elevated insulated pulley ( I ) , and down again to she end of a short lever , working on an axis , armed with a counterweight and with a lever ( L ) , whose angular position will be mate-t dally affected by any small elongation of the strip that may take i place from any cause .
The apparatus further consists of a number of i prisms of metal ( P ) , supported by means of metallic springs ( M ) , so | regulated by movable weights ( .W ) as to insure the equidistant posi-| tion of each prism from its neighbour , unless pressed against the neighbouring piece by the action of the lever ( L ) , in consequence of a .
shortening of the metallic strip .
By this action , one prism after another would be brought into contacLwith its neighbour , until the last prism in the series would be pressed against the contact spring ( S ) , which is in metallic connexion with the terminal ( T ) .
I \gt ; The current passing through the thin strip of metal will , under these circumstances , pass through the lever ( L ) and the line of prisms to the terminal ( T ) , without encountering any sensible resistance .
A second and more circuitous route is , however , provided between the lever ( L ) and the terminal ( T ) , consisting of a series of comparatively thin coils of wire of German silver or other resisting metal ( R , R ) , connecting the alternate ends of each two adjoining springs , the first and last spring being also connected to the lever ( L ) and terminal ( T ) respectively .
When the lever ( L ) stands in its one extreme position , as shown in Mr. G. W. Siemens on certain means i the drawing , the contact pieces are , all senary / SB to pass through the entire series of coils , which J * C*\gt ; W -aggregate resistance to prevent the current from \#171 ; % limit .

The resistance coils , by which adjoining 'f tct springs are connected , may be readily changed , so as to suit C'\hular cases ; they are made by preference of naked wire , in order par ^ose the entire surface to the cooling action of the atmosphere .
t0 In dealing with feeble-currents , I use another form of regulator , in \#166 ; ^gks of carbon are substituted for the wire rheostat .
The Cotmt duMoncel , in 1856 , first called attention to , and Mr. Edison more recently took advantage of , the interesting circumstance that the electrical resistance of carbon varies inversely with the pressure to which it is subjected , and by piling several disks of carbon one upon another in a vertical glass tube , a rheostat may be constructed which varies between wide limits , according as the mechanical pressure in the line of the axis is increased or diminished .
Fig. 4 , Plate 5 , represents the current regulator based upon this principle , and the foot-notes below the figure furnish the explanation of parts .
A steel wire of say 03 milim .
diameter is drawn tight between the end of a bell-crank lever ( L ) and an adjusting screw ( B ) , the pressure of the lever being resisted by a pile of carbon disks ( C ) placed in a vertical glass tube .
The current passing through the steel wire , through the bell-crank lever , and through the carbon disks , encounters the minimum resistance in the latter so long as the tension of the wire is at its maximum ; whereas the least increase in temperature of the steel wire by the passage of the current causes a decrease of pressure upon the pile of carbon disks , and an increase in their electrical resistance ; it will thus be readily seen that , by means of this simple apparatus , the strength of small currents may be regulated so as to vary only within certain narrow limits .
The apparatus described in figs. 1 to 3 , Plate 4 , may be adapted also for the measurement of powerful electric currents\#151 ; an application which is represented by figs. 5 and 6 , Plate 5 .
The variable rheostat is in this case dispensed with , and the lever ( L ) carries at its end a pencil ( P ) pressing with its point upon a strip of paper drawn under it in a parallel direction with the lever by means of clockwork .
A second fixed pencil ( D ) draws a second or datum line upon the strip , so 296 On Regulating and Measuring Electric Currents .
[ Jan. 30 adjusted that the lines drawn by the two pencils coincide when no current is passing through the sensitive strip .
The passage of a cur . ?
rent through the strip immediately causes the pencil attached to the lever to move away from the datum line , and the distance between the two lines represents the temperature of the strip .
This temuera-ture depends , in the first place , upon the amount of current passing !
through the strip , and , in the second place , upon the loss of heat byl radiation from the strip ; which two quantities balance one another during any interval that the current remains constant .
If C is the current before increase of temperature has taken place j R the resistance of the conductor at the external temperature ( T ) M H the heat generated per unit of time at the commencement of the flow ; R/ the resistance , and H ' the heat , when the temperature T ' and the current C ' have been attained ; Then by the law of Joule\#151 ; H'=R/ C'2 .
But inasmuch as the radiation during the interval of constant current !
and temperature is equal to the supply of heat during the same interval , we have by the law of Dulong and Petit\#151 ; H'=(T ' \#151 ; T)S , in which S is the radiating surface .
Then R'C'2=(T'-T)S C'2=(T'\#151 ; T)-\#187 ; .
R But T ' - T represents the expansion of the strip , or movement of the| pencil m , and considering that the electrical resistance of the con-f ductor varies as its absolute temperature ( which upon the Centigrade !
scale is 274 ' below the zero Centigrade ) according to a law first ex-1 pressed by Helmholtz , and that we are only here dealing with a few I degrees difference of temperature , no sensible error will be committedf in putting the value of R for R ' , and we have the condition of equi-| librium ( 1 ) 1 or , in words , the current varies as the square root of the difference of temperature or ordinates .

In order to facilitate the process of determining the value of a diagram in webers or other units of current , it is only necessary , if the variations are not excessive , to average the ordinates , and to determine their value by equation ( 1 ) , or from a table prepared for that purpose .
The error committed in taking the average ordinate instead of the absolute ordinates , when the current varies between small limits , is evidently small , the variation of the ordinates above their mean value averaging the variations below the same .
The thin sensitive conductor may thus be utilized either to restrict the amount of electricity flowing through a branch circuit within certain narrow limits , or to produce a record of the amount of current passed through a circuit in any given time .
