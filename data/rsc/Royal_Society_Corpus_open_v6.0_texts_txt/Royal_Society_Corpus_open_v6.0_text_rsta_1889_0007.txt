EARLY in 1887 we communicated to the Royal Society a short account of experiments made to examine the magnetic behaviour of iron when subjected to strong magnetic force by what we called the " " isthmus\ldquo ; method of magnetisation .
Since then the experiments have been continued and extended by applying stronger magnetic forces , and by testing samples of nickel , cobalt , and various steels , as well as wrought iron and cast iron .
It may be well to preface an account of the more recent experiments by a short summary of the results stated in our earlier paper .
S2 .
The method of experiment consisted in turning the piece of metal whose magnet , tion was to be examined to the form of a bobbin with a narrow neck or isthmus , and placing that between the pole-pieces of a powerful electromagnet .
The sample furnished with a spreading cone at each end , to facilitate the convergence of the lines of magnetic induction upon the central neck .
The magnetisation was measured by means of an induction coil of fine wire wound in a single layer , or , in some cases , in two layers , upon the metal of the neck .
Outside of this coil , and at a small definite distance from it , a second induction coil was wound in order to measure the magnetic field in the space between the two coils .
This served a double purpose : it enabled a proper deduction to be made from the values of the induction measured the inner coil , to allow for the space between the surface of the iron neck and the centre of the of the coil ; and it gave values of the magnetic force in the space immediately surrounding the iron , from which an inference might be drawn as to the value of the force within the neck itself As there was no free magnetism on the circumference of the neck , in the medial plane , the force within the metal was continuous there with the force outside , and it will be shown later that when a saitable slope was given to the conical ends of the bobbin the variation of force in the medial plane in directions at right angles to the axis was so small that the external field * On the etisation of Iron in Strong Fields ' Roy .

Preliminary notices of some of the later results were communicated to Section A of the itish Association at Manchester Report British Association . .
must have formed ( in such ses ) very approximatel accurate measure of the force acting on the metal .
In other cases , when the cones were more blunt , the force in the external field was somewhat greater the mean force within the metal .

used , and the pole-pieces of the magnet by which they were magnetised .
With bobbins of the type of fig. 1 , the magnetic induction in the neck and the field in the surroundiog air were measured by suddenly turning the bobbin round , end for end ; in bobbins of the type of fi ' .
, the measurements were made by suddenly withdrawing the bobbin from its place between the pole-pieces .
In the latter case , the induction measured was the excess of the whole induction ( ) above the residual induction which persisted when the bobbin was drawn out .
In iron bobbins the residual magnetisation was found to be sensibly constant from the lowest to the highest value of the inducing field employed in these experiments , but the form of the bobbin made the amount of this residue small .
It was measured in of the type of fig. 1 , by comparing the result of turning the bobbin round with the effect of drawing the bobbin out ; and , in the first instance , its value in iron bobbins of the type of fig. 2 , was estimated to be bout the same as in bobbins of the type of fig. 1 .
In later experiments , when other more retentive metals were being examined , and the residual magnetism consequently formed a more important part of the whole , its value was directly determined by using -up bobbins which allowed one conical end to be withdrawn ; the residual magnetism was then determined after the bobbin had been removed from the field by slipping off ( in one operation ) one of the conical ends , along with an induction coil which had been wound for this purpose upon a loose ring over the central neck .

The pole-pieces of the magnet used in the early experiments were only cm .
sqnare , and it was clear that with a larger magnet a greater concentration of the induction might be produced .
Professor TAIT was kind enough to lend us the large crnef of the Edinburgb University Laboratory , and all the subsequent work has been done with it .
The Fdinburgh magnet has a pair of vertical limbs about 50 cm .
long and 107 cm .
in diameter .
These are united by a horizontal yoke at the bottom , and are furnished on the top with movable pole-pieces in the form of rectangular blocks of soft wrought iron , the cross-section of which is cm .
square .
The limbs are wound along a length of 49 cm .
with a number of coils which are grouped in series , making about 1600 turns in all .
The currents employed by us ranged up to 40 amperes , and the greatest value of the line-integral of the nlagnetic force was consequently about 80,000 .
To allow the old bobbin , of the form of fig. 1 , to be effectively used , we furnished the poles with a pair of intermediate conical pieces of soft wrought iron , which virtually formed an extension of the bobbin 's ends .
Fig. 3 is a full-size sketch of the poles , with the intermediate pieces , and the bobbin , in place .
The figure shows the size to which the neck of the bobbin was finally turned down in experiments are described below .
The dimensions are given in millimetres .

In the first instance , however , a Lowmoor bobbin of the dimensions shown in fig. 1 , which had been used in the earlier observations , was tested in the lrgh without being turned down .

TABLE III.\mdash ; Lowmoor Iron .
A Swedish iron sampIe of the same shape gave induction of 37,620 in a field of about the same force , with current of 38 in the field coils .
S7 .
To push the induction in the Lowmoor sample to a still higher value , the neck of the bobbin was turned down to a diameter of mm. , the slope of the conical ends being approximately maintained .
The inner coil was re-wound with a mean diameter of mm. , and the outer coil with a mean diameter of mm. The following are the results for a magnetising current of about 38 amperes , the mean of several measurements being taken:\mdash ; 8 .
A final effort to raise the induction was then made by again turning down the neck of the sample to the size shown in fig. 3 .
The diameter of the neck was reduced to mm. , but its length was not reduced in the same proportion : to leave room for a sufficiently long induction coil , a little of the metal of the cones close to the neck was cleared away in the manner shown by the sketch .
The section of the neck was now less than that of the pole-pieces .
The bobbin was annealed after being turned down .
The inner induction coil was wound in a single layer of ten turns with nleall d of 2.93 mm. The outer coil was a single layer of eight turns wit , a diameter of mm. With these conditions the induction was forced to the lnous value of c.g.s. units , the outside field between the two coils a smaller value than before .
anomaly does not necessarily imply the ) surements were in error , for , as will appear from what follows , the relation of the outside field to the force within the metal is materially affected by the of the conical endLQ , and tlJat form had been altered , as has just been said , in the region close to the neck .
The excessive smallness of the neck in this case , howeyer , it more difficult than before to measure the outside field with precision .
The following are results for the strongest netising currents:\mdash ; Outside field .
S 9 .
With regard to the quantity ( \mdash ; outside field ) , it will be noticed that , if we exclude the last ( somewhat donbtful ) case , there is a progressive decrease as the induction rises , within the ange covered by these experiments .
With a field of 5000 or 6000 , the value of this quantity was 1700 in the Swedish sample and 1680 in the Lowmoor mple , and it fell to 1430 as the field was raised to ) , .
This gives great interest to the , whether the field as measured in the outside space has the same , or nearly the same , value as the magnetic face within the metal ; for in that case we should have evidence that the intensity of magnetisation passes a maximum nd begins to decrease under the action of very strong fields , and this is a result which WEBER'S molecular-current theory of diamagnetism , extended as MAXWELL has extended it to a paramagnetic substance , wuuld lead us to expect .
* After a careful examination of this important point , we have concluded , for reasons given below , that the apparent decrease of in the experiments described above is in all probability wholly due to the outside field being greater than the field within the metal , and that , if there is any variation in the real value of in strong fields , it is smaller than our method of experiment can detect .
S 10 .
An attempt to investigate the uniformity of the field ( in a medial plane along lines radiating from the axis ) was made building up a bobbin over the neck of which four induction coils were wound , one above another , with small annular spaces between .
The lowest coil was wound on the iron neck , and the other three on thin * Scc ' reatise ou ectricity and Magnetism , ' vol. 2 , chap .

The innermost coil had a mean diameter of mm. , and the outermost a mean diameter of cm .
The anmular space between them , .
thick , was in this way ivided into three parts , in each of which the field was measured .
It found that in these three the field decreased oressively with increase of from the axis .
, in one instance , the field fell from 19,000 in the innermost ring to 17,300 in the outermost ring .
It is unnecessary to describe at length these experiments , which were very laborious , and which did not throw any light on the important of how closely the force withun the metal approximated to the force in the air close to the surface of the neck .
Moreover , the form of the built-up bobbin used in this case was , as we afterwards recognised , such as to give a much more uniform field the bobbin formerly used .
Concent rIagnetic Force by S 11 .
The magnetic force in the space between the pole-pieces is made up of two parts : ( 1 ) the electromagnetic force directly produced by current in the field- magnet coils ; and ( 2 ) the force due to free magnetism distributed for { he most part over the pole-faces .
The first of these was a comparatively small part ( less than onefiftieth ) of the whole , and its value mnst have been sensibly uniform at such small distances from the axis as those with which we now considering the uniformity of the field we need only deal with the force produced by free magnetism distributed over the opposing surfaces of the poles .
S 12 .
The free magnetism on each pole-face may be treated as made up of a sel.ies of co-axial circular rings in planes normal to the axis of magnetisation .
] the whole free netism of one of these rings ( fig. 4 ) and its radius , force due to it at a point in the axis at a distance from the plane of the ring is , where .
force will be a maximum when SSOR J. A. EWING AND MR. W. LOW ON THE which giyes ; ; Hence , a series of co-axial rings will be most advantageously disposed for producing force at a point on the axis if they lie on a cone having its vertex at that point , with a semi-vertical angle of .
This conclusion is independent of the distribution of density from ring to S 13 .
The greatest force will be produced when the pole-pieces themselves saturated , so that reaches its limiting value in an parts of the metal .
that case the distribution of density from ring to ring is uniform .
The surface density of free netism at any point of a sloping pole-face is , where is the slope of the face to the axis of tion .
The whole lantity in each ring is multiplied by the area of the ring projected upon a plame normal to the axis\mdash ; a quantity which is independent of the slope of the cone .
We have , therefore , the same series of attlacting ings to deal with , whatever be the slope of the convergent forces , and ether that slope be uniform or not .
Giyen , then , a certain diameter for the neck of the bobbin to be magnetised , the greatest magnetic force will be produced at the middle of the axis of the neck if we make the expanding ends and pole faces in the form of cones , with a semi-angle of , and with their vertices at the middle of the neck .
S 14 .
This cone of aximum concentrative power is 1lot , however , the form best suited for producing a unifolYn field .
At any point in the axis and are zero , axes of and being taken in a plane parallel to the rings , and the condition for a uniform field ( uniform , namely , in the neighbourhood of the axis , over a transverse plane ) is that and shall also be zero .
Consider again the attraction of a ring at an ' point in the axis .
Taking LAPLACE'S equation\mdash ; and differenti ting with respect to , we have By of the field about the axis of the second and tbird ierms equal ; hence , writing for * The corresponding position for truncated cones , with an air space between them , has lately been stated by Professor STEFAN ( Wien , Akad .
Sitzber Feb. 9 , 1888 ; or ' Phil. Mag vol. 25 , p. 322 ) .
MAGNETISATION OF IRON AND OTHER MAGNETIC METALS .
The condition for uniform field will therefore be satisfied when ; that is , when which gives , the condition is satisfied when the pole-faces are cones convel.ging as before upon the middle of the neck , but with a semi-vertical angle S With a cone of any semi-angle , the surface density of free magnetism being , the force at the vertex due , to a ring at an axial distance , of adius r , and of length , measured along the slope , is The whole force at the vertex is being the radius of the neck on which the converges , and the radius of the base to which it spreads .
Hence ( treating as uniform ) , with a pair of truncated cones , by a neck at the middle of which they have their common vertex , the whole force there is which , for convenience of calculation , we shall write S 16 .
Applying this to the cones of maximum concentrative power , in which and and the greatest value of the force will be obtained when has ) ation value ( of say 1700 c.g. .
units for soft ought iron ) , in which case an expression which measures the greatest possible force which the " " isthmus\ldquo ; method of magnetisation can apply at a pomt in the axis of the bobbin ( over and above the small force which is directly ) roduced by the coils ) .
It is are indebted to Mr. A. for .
this calculation of the form of poles suited to give a uniform field .
to produce quite so force as this on account of the difficulty of the magnet poles .
Witl the which give the most , uniform field , for which and , the of is only 8 .
which becomes in the event of the pole-pieces being of soft wrought iron and saturated .
S 18 .
The curve , fig. 5 , has been drawn to show how the force at the vertex varies when the angle of the cone is altered .
The base of the cone being represented by AB , any ordinate PM gives the force when the vertex is at M. In the figure , AMB represents the cone of maximum concentrative power , and ANB represents the cone giving a uniform in the neighbourhood of the axis , being the point of inflection in the curve .
S 19 .
In figs. 6 and 7 the sallle two cases are further illustrated by curves which show the sum of the forces due to two equal .
and opposite rings ( situated on cones with a common vertex ) at points along the axis .
By summing up the effects of such , for the whole cone , we may judge how nearly the force is uniform from end to enud of the neck of the magnetised bobbin .
In a bobbin with cones of semi-angle the field is sensibly uniform from end to end of the neck , except close to the ends , where it is slightly reduced , and ( S 14 ) this longitudinal uniformit , implies transverse uniformity .
S 20 .
When the semi-vertical angle cones is greater than , the force at points on the axis has a maximum at the common vertex , and , since and .
have opposite signs ( S 14 ) , the field is stronger at places near the axis than MAGNETISATION OF IIION AND MAGNETIC METALS .
on the axis itself In bobbin with a narrow neck this may have the effect of making the field in the closely surrounding air space greater than the mean field wit.hin the neck .
S21 .
We may now apply the above conclusions to elucidate the experiments have been described .
The form of bobbin used in them had been chosen , without reference to theory , as one likely to give a strong concentration of netic induction , and it chanced to come very near the best form for this purpose .
The cones had a semi-angle of , and their vertices were nearly coincident ( overlapping very slightly , see fig. 2 ) .
Applying the formula of S15 , we have , for which is only two and a half per cent. short of the force attainable by using cones of maximum concentrative power .
Moreover , it must be borne in mind that in actual Fig. 6 .
Fig. 7 .
use of the isthmus method the stron gest induction will be reached when the semi-angle is rather greater than , for is itself a function of the angle , decreasing when the angle is decreased , on account of the augmented " " istance \ldquo ; of the whole magnetic circuit .
For this reason we probably obtained as much concentration with cones of as we should have obtained with cones of .
Further , in the last experiment ( S 8 ) , the neck of the bobbin had been turned down to the smallest size we found it practicable to work with .
It is clear , therefore , that no materially higher value of than the value already obtained was possible with the apparatus at our isposal .
S22 .
From the relation of the line integral of netic force to the length of iron and mean length of air in the magnetic circuit , we estimate that the mean value of in pole-pieces cannot have exceeded 1400 when the magnetising current was at its strongest .
The bution of this over the conical pole-faces was not iform .
to the neck it reached the saturabion value ( of , say , 1680 or 1700 ) , ered there at the expense of outlying portions .
This want of uniformity of ) in the pole-faces increases the magnetic force in the neck , but when a distribution of is assigned it is easily taken account of in applying the formula of S 15 .
S 23 .
Taking the experimental case ) , in which the diameter of the neck was of the diameter to the cones spread , we calculate that the magnetic force at the middle of the axis was about 22,500 , and at other points of the axis it was less .
Now , the measured value of the field in the air , close to the bobbin 's neck , was in this instance 25,620 .
To produce this force at the axis would require that the value of in the pole-pieces should have been nothing less than lC90 all over , that is to say , it would require that the poles should have been saturated from axis to circum- ference\mdash ; aquite impossible supposition .
It is clear that the force in the air close to the neck was in this case distinctly greater than the mean force within neck .
The measured induction within the neck was 43,500 .
If we accept 22,500 as the mean value of within the neck ( remembering that while increases from the axis to the circumference it diminishes from the middle towards the ends ) , the value of in the neck would be , which is , as nearly as may be dged , the same value as was produced by the application of magnetising forces of moderate strength .
S 24 .
These considerations establish a very strong presumption that the apparent decrease of in the experiments , that is to say , the observed decrease in the quantity ( \mdash ; outside field ) under very strong forces is to be explained by the facb that the outside field was stronger than the field within the neck ; and that the true value of is sensibly constant throughout the range of magnetic forces examined , namely , from bout 4000 to 24,000 c.g.s. units .
Furth Experiment on Iro S21 To put this matter further to the proof , we continued the experiments with another bobbin , also of Lowmoor wrought iron , the conical ends of which were aped so as to produce a much more field .
The shape which would give the most uniform field was not chosen , for that would have imposed so low an upper limit on the strength of the field that the test would have been rather inconclusive .
By way of compromise , a bobbin was turned of the shape and dimensions shown in fig. 8 , with cones of semi-angle , as a form which combined high concentratiye power with a fair approximation to uniformity of field .
The advantage , in respect of unifor1nity MAGNETISATION OF IRON AND OTHER MAGNETJC TALS .
of field , this bobbin had over the one formerly used may be judged from figs. 9 and 10 , which show the longitudinal variation of due to a pair of in the two cases .
The length and diameter of the neck .
The outside field and the induction were measured as before , and it was found that they decidedly less than in the former instance , chiefly , of course , because of the greater mean thickness of air space now present between the magnet poIes , which reduced the mean value of in them .
But what is important to our present purpose is to note that now , owing to the greater uniformity of the field , the quantity \mdash ; outside field ) undergoes no progressive diminution as the force rises .
Table .
gives the results .
They confirm the conclusion which was provisionally stated in S24 .
Here we may accept the strength of the outside field as closely to the meam force within the neck , so that the first column in the table might have been styled the second last column , and the last column Iy .

It remains to describe the results of tests of other samples of wrought iron and of cast iroIl , of various steels , manganese steel , nickel , and cobalt .
Messrs JOWITT and SONS , of Sheffield , were kind enough to supply rlens of pure Swedish iron and of steel , with which a number of experiments were made .

A similar construction has been adopted in many PROF p SOR J. WING AND MR. W. LOW ON TH other ; the use of the permeable metal\mdash ; wrought iron\mdash ; for the cones has , of course , the of strengthening the induction in the neck .
Here the residual netism measured , a.fter the observations were otherwise complete , by slackening one of the lles , so that it be slipped off the spindle .
A suibable induction coil , wound on a ring , was then slipped on ; whole bobbin was magnetised and removed from the field , the loose end and the coil were then slipped off together , and the ballistic effect of this was observed .
In these measurements the bobbin was demagnetised by the method of reversals , to get rid of the effect of previous stronger netisations .
A similar procedure was followed in finding the residual magnetism of steel samples .
The residual magnetism is allowed for in the values of given below .

These two experiments agree in about 1240 as the saturation value of in iron ; the apparent diminution in fields of the greatest strength is , of course , to be set down to the cause which has been fully explained in connection with iron\mdash ; an excess of the " " outside field\ldquo ; mean force within the metal , to the cones being too blunt to give a very uniform field .

Taken together , the experiments on steel render it probable that there are specific differences in the saturation values of 3 for different steels , smaller values being found in higl]-than in low-carbon steels .

HOPKINSON found that a force of 244 produced an induction of 310 , which makes the permeability only .
HADFIELD was kind enough to supply us with a bar which contairled about 12 per cent. of nese and per cent. of carbon .
The metal is excessively hard , but , by raising the bar to a bright red heat and quenching it in water , it was softened sufficiently to allow pieces to be turned , with considerable difficulty , into forms suitable for these experiments .
One piece of the bar was turned into a solid , of the size and shape shown in fig. 16 , and with that the obsery tions were TABLE Manganese S33 .
To push the induction to higher values , another bobbin was built up ( tig .

The following measurements were made with SSOR J. .

The figures in the last two columns of Tables XI .

show as much regularity as can be expected , when it is borne in mind that they depend upon the nall differences between two large quantities which had to be separately measured .
The two sets of results agree well .
They show that the permeability of manganese steel is , as nearly as may be judged , constant from fields of 2000 to 10,000 units , with a value approximating to in this sample .
It follows from this that , notwithstanding the excessive resistance which this material opposes to being magnetised , respectably high tensity of gnetisation will be produced by application of a sufficiently strong force .
In the second experiment was raised to nearly 400 .
It is ' remarkable that scarcely any of this magnetisation remains when the force is .
One might have expected that a material which resists magnetisation so strongly possess much coercive force .
In fact , however , the residual magnetism ( which was determined in the second sample in the usual way , by slipping off one of the iron cones along with an induction coil ) was so small that it scarcely admitted of measurement by the apparatus which served to measure the induced magnetism .
After applying the strongest field the value of the residual induction was only about 30 .
It is well known that with ordinary iron and steel the nlagnetisation wholly , or almost wholly , disappears when the magnetising force is withdrawn , provided the force is less a certain amount .
This elastic stage in the process of netisation , the limits of which are exceedingly narrow in soft wrought iron , but somewhat wider in hard iron , common steels , nickel , seems to extend , manganese steel , up to the strongest force we have been able to apply .
Nickel .

Two specimens of nickel , supplied by Messrs. JOIINSON and MATTHEY , have been tested .
The first was cut a bar previously used in examining the permeability of nickel when in a state of compression under the action of ordinarily weak MAGNETISATION OF AND OTHER manetising force It contained about per cent. of iron .
The bar was annealed and was built into a bobbin with wrought iron cones , and the eck was turned down to a diameter of 4 mm. fig. .

In the second , third , and fourth of these observations the residual magnetism was sensibly constant ; in the first it was a little less .
S 38 .
We conclude under qufficiently strong magnetising forces the intensity of -sation reaches a constant , or very nearly constant , value in iron , iron , most steels , nickel , and cobalt .
The magnetic force at which be said to become practically constant is less than 2000 c.g.s. units for iron nickel , and less than 4000 for cast iron and .
In stronger fields , the relation of netic induction to magnetic force may be expressed by the constallt .
specimens we have tested , the value of this constant is about MAGNETISATION OF IRON AND OTHER MLTALS .
21,360 in wrought iron , 15,580 in cast iron , 5030 and 6470 in nickel , and 16,300 in cobalt .
The experiments give a definite ning to the term " " satul.ation , \ldquo ; as lied to magnetic state .
When netisation is sured by the cbion , the term saturation is ; there is apparently no limit to the value to which the induction may be raised .
But , when we measure Ynebjsation by the intensity of magnetism , we are confronted with a definite limit\mdash ; a true tion value , which is reached or closely approacbed by the application of comparatively force .
There is nothing to show that the approach to this is not asymptotic ; but in wrought iron it is practically reached ' the magnetic force rises to 2000 c.g.s. , and after that a ten-fold increase in the force produces no material change in the intensity of S39.\mdash ; The results are further summarised in .
