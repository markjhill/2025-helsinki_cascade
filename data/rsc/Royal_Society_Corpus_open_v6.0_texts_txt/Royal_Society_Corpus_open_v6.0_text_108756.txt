THE following investigation is the result of an attempt to simplify the analytical treatment of the problem of the Attraction of Ellipsoids .
The application to this particular case , of certain known propositions relating to closed surfaces in general , showed that the principal theorems could easily be deduced without taking account of any other properties of the ellipsoid than those expressed by two differential equations , of which the truth is evident on inspection .
In fact if we take the equation x2 y2 2z a2+h+1b+hc2+h=k ' we see at once that the expression on the left side , considered as a function of x , y , z , h , satisfies the two partial differential equations d2u d2u du _/ 111 I1 ) d-+ dk z-+z 2 -a2 + b+ ++ C2 +h / duV2 jdU\2 .
/ du\2 du\d)\ die ) + 4d dh0 and these equations express all that we require to know about the ellipsoid , except the fact that the surface is capable of being extended to infinity in every direction by the variation of h , without ceasing to be.closed .
But it appeared also that the success of the method depended only on the circumstance that the right-hand member of the first du equation , and the coefficient of in the second , are constants independent of k. It was therefore possible to generalize the process by taking indeterminate functions of h for du these two constants .
As , however , the coefficient of dh could always be reduced to a constant independent of h , by taking a function of h as a parameter instead of h , we may suppose , without loss of generality , that this reduction has been effected .
Mr. CAYLEY has shown* , in the latest publication on this subject which I have met with , that if two of the principal theorems of attraction ( in the case of the ellipsoid ) be given , the rest follow very simply , and are common to all surfaces of which those two can be predicatedt .
But the demonstration of the two assumed theorems constitutes the most essential part of the analytical problem , and it is my present object to show that they , and the others connected with them , are implied in the two differential equations above written .
1 .
Suppose the equation F'(xy , , )=O ... ... ... . .
( 1 .
) represents closed surfaces for all values of the parameter 0 within certain limits ; and let the surface corresponding to any particular value d , of 8 , be called " the surface 01 .
" With reference to these surfaces let the limits of integrals be indicated thus : [ ]O signifies that an integral enclosed between the brackets , if it consist of stuperficial elements , is extended over the surface d ; if of solid elements , through the whole space within that surface .
In either case let [ ] ?
2 stand as an abbreviation for [ ]02[]0 .
Let { ( dv\ 2+ dv)\ ( dv }\ dx ) + die / +w be , for shortness , denoted by Q , ( whatever v may be ) .
Let us put also ( d)2+ ( d)+ ( )=D and let the element of surface be called do .
By means of ( 1 .
) we may suppose 0 expressed as a function of x , y , z. On this supposition we have for d oae of d impcity .
QO\d ) +TX ) +(a ) dz Let the sign of the right-hand member of this equation be so taken that Q0d0 shall be positive or negative according as the surface ( d+dO ) is without or within the surface 0 .
Since Qo'dd is the normal thickness at any point of the infinitesimal shell included between the two surfaces 0 and 0+dd , the latter surface must be either wholly within or wholly without the former , unless Q0 become infinite at some point of the surface 0 , a supposition which it is not necessary to exclude , but which I suppose to be excluded for the sake of simplicity .

The preliminary propositions to be demonstrated in this article are not new .
I am not certain to whom they are originally due ; they were , however , employed by Pro* See also Camb .

The two theorems are those marked V. and VI .
in this paper .
2 fessor W. THOMSON in an early volume of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal ( to which I have not at present the opportunity of referring ) in some form equivalent to ( if not identical with ) that in which they are here given .
They depend on the most elementary principles , and ought to be so well known as to make a demonstration needless ; however , I give one for the sake of completeness .
Retaining the suppositions of the last article , we have , if P be any function of x , y , z , [ rffdP dxd dz ]p dL S7 ( by integrating the expression on the left with respect to x , and applying a well-known transformation to the double integral ) .
Let then u be any function of x , y , z , and put dO du dO du dO du -p=U Wr-d 9=uW--d-7 , r ==tW-r--- , then a3 die dr d-+j+ -= uD2O-Dht ; and if the two members of the last equation be multiplied by dxdydz , and integrated through the space within the surface d , , the result on the left is [ ~Q ( o dd dd- ) dO j ; or , if p , q , r be replaced by their values , it is Lr-0f f ' ( du d$+d du dO du dO o but in the last of these integrals 0 has the same value 6d throughout the integration , and may therefore be put outside the integral sign ; and the integral which it multiplies is then evidently equivalent to the triple integral [ SSSD2u .
dxdydz]01 , since it would be obtained by one integration of each of the three terms of the latter .
Hence we have , finally , [ SIQQod6 ] , 1 D2 .
dxdydz]0 ' + [ SSS(UD2 OD2)dyd ' , ... .
( 2 .
) and , subtracting this from the similar equation referring to another value 82 of 0 , [ SuQodi== 02[JSSSD2S .
S ddYdz]822-0[SSSDJ2U .
dxdydz]0 +[ SS$S(D20D2U)dxdydz ] , .
( 3 .
) which last might have been obtained at once by taking the triple integrals through the space included between the surfaces 6 , , 2 .
It is of course necessary for the validity of each equation , that the functions under the integral signs should not become infinite at any point within the limits of the integrations .
3 .
Let the equation f(x / , y , , k )-= 0 ... ... ... ... ( 4 .
) represent closed surfaces for all values , within certain limits , of the parameters h , c. Let the surface corresponding to a particular pair of values h , k , be called " the surface h , k ; " and let the space ( or solid ) included between the surfaces ( h , , k ) , ( h2 , k ) be called " the shell ( h2 , k " ; similarly , let that included between the surfaces ( h , kl ) , ( h , k2 ) be called " the shell ( h , 2 ) * .
" Let it also be supposed that each of the surfaces ( h , k+ d ) , ( h+dh , k ) , is either wholly within or wholly without the surface ( h , k ) .
By virtue of equation ( 4 .
) either parameter may be considered a function of a , y , z , and the other parameter .
Let the function on the left of ( 4 .
) be such that when k is considered as a function of x , y , z , h , the two following partial differential equations are satisfied:d2k d2k d2k d1 yL K ... ... ( .
( 5 .
) ( / dk)\2 ( dk\2 ( dk ) dk0 where p(h ) is a function of h not containing k , and nt is a constant , independent of h and k. The second of these equations may be put in another form thus : considering h as implicitly a function of x , y , z , k , we have dk dk dh ++ =O , &amp;c. , dr dh dx whence ( dk k2 2 / dk ) 2 dk ) 2/ ( dh)2 dh 2 ( dh 2+ +t( ) -(\~ ^ 'y I or ( extracting the root and employing the notation explained in art .
1 ) dk Qk=-* Qht ; hence the second of equations ( 5 .
) , which is may be changed into Q , .
Qk='n .
In this form it will be actually employed , so that the two equations may be written as follows : D2k =--(h ) Qh .
Qk=n J ** ( Now let the general equation ( 2 .
) , art .
2 , be applied to the case of the surface considered in the last article , k being taken for the parameter 0 , so that D20 is D2k , and is =-p(h ) ; also let the arbitrary function u be put = 1 , so that D2u=0 .
Then , observing the second of equations ( 6 .
) , we obtain from ( 2 .
) , n [ j1 =(h)[ = ffdxdydz ]k Let the volume enclosed by the surface ( h , k ) be represented by V. Then , since the normal thns a an nh hll d thickness at any point of thebove equation is equivalent to dV n -p(h ) .

( h)dh from which we obtain by integration , putting for shortness 6n ) =--(h ) , V=F(k).(h ) , ... ... ... ... . .
( 7 .
) where F(k ) is an unknown function of k , independent of h. But if , instead of putting u =1 , we suppose u to be the potential , at the point ( x , y , z ) , of a given mass M exterior to the surface ( h , k ) , then we have ( since D2ut is again =0 ) nlJ= p(h ) .
[ Jfuxdydz k ; and if V be put for the potential on M of a ( homogeneous ) solid bounded by the surface ( h , k ) , this equation is equivalent to dV nd= ( h ) V and therefore , as before , V=F(k ) .
, ( h ) , ... ... .
( .
) where +(h ) is the same as before , but F(k ) is a new unknown function of k , which will also involve the given quantities which define M. From ( 7 .
) and ( 8 .
) we have F(k ) v F(k)* which equation expresses THEOREM I. The potential , on a given external mass , ofi a homnogeneous solid botznded by the surface ( h , k ) , varies as the mass of the solid , if h vary while k remains constant .
5 .
If we put V(h , k ) for the volume , and V(h , k ) for the potential , denoted above simply by V and V , we obtain from equations ( 7 .
) and ( 8 .
) the following : V(A ) ~-V(h2 ) kl ) _ ( ^2 k2 ) V(h2 ) k , ) V(hl , k2)--V(h2 , k , ) V(hl , k)V(h , , k , ) which expresses THEOREM II .
The potentials , on a given external mass , of the homogeneous shells ( h2 , k2 ) , ( h , ) , are proportional to the masses of the shells .
5 When the thickness of the shells is infinitesimal , this proposition may be enunciated as THEOREMi III .
The potential , upon a given external mass , of the homogeneous shell ( h , k +dk ) , varies as the mass of the shell , if h vary while k remains constant .
6 .
The above conclusions were deduced from equation ( 2 .
) , art .
2 .
Let us now take equation ( 3 .
) and apply it in a similar manner , taking for the parameter 6 , no longer k , but an indeterminate function of h ( not containing k ) , say 6=f(h ) .
This gives , without ambiguity of sign , Q0=f'(h)Q , ( for by the convention made , art .
1 , as to the signs of Qh , &amp;c. , Q , and Qh must have the same sign or not , according as f(h ) is positive or negative ) .
Hence , writing the left-hand side of ( 3 .
) in full , and introducing the second of the conditions ( 6 .
) , we have _n[(h 1 ) ?
D:flh ) .
dxdgdz nf ' ( h2)LS -^r ] -ek(h , )[5 Udcr ]h , [ ff f(h ) d.dydz + ( terms involving D2u ) .
Now let u be the potential of a given mass M exterior to both the surfaces ( h , , k ) , ( h2 , k ) , f Cudo d-h dV so that D2u is =-0 throughout the integrations .
The integral L jQ is evidently -d if V be the potential on M of a homogeneous solid ( density =1 ) bounded by the surface dV ( h , k ) ; and by equation ( 8 .
) , art .
4 , d-=F'(k).4(h ) .
The above equation thus becomes nF'( ) f'(h,2)/ ( h2 ) --f'(h , )4 ( h ) } = [ uDf(h ) .
dXdydz]h .
The function f(h ) has been so far arbitrary .
Let us now determine it in such a manner that f'(h)(h)=A ) a constant independent of h and k ; or f(h ) =A+B CJ d5l ) ( j , ih ) ( A , B being two such arbitrary constants ) .
Then the left-hand side of the equation vanishes ; therefore the right-hand side vanishes also , or [ SSSi D !
f(h ) .
dxdydz]^7 = 0 ; but since u is the potential of an arbitrary mass , this cannot be unless D2f(h)=O .
We may therefore ( introducing the value of 4(h ) , art .
4 , and including the arbitrary constants under the integral signs ) enunciate THEOREM IV .
If f(h ) be defined by the equation f(h ) =Sdh .
r-li(d)h then f(h ) satisfies the equation D2Y(h)=0 .
6 This result may be verified by actual differentiation , as will be shown afterwards ( art .
12 ) .
7 .
Resuming the equation ( 3 .
) , art .
2 , and supposing that 0 is the function f(h ) determined in the last article , so that D2f(h)= 0 , let us put uz=1 ; then the equation becomes f ( )[^ jk -f'(h ) FflQ = -0 ; if this be multiplied by dk , it expresses the following proposition : If the homogeneous infinitesimal shell ( h , k+dk ) have the density f'(h ) , the mass of the shell is independent of h. It follows that the potential of such a shell , on a given interior mass , vanishes when h has the value which makes the surface ( h , k ) extend to infinity in all directions ; for the mass of the shell is finite , but every part of it is infinitely distant from the attracted mass .
8 .
Instead of putting u=1 , as in the last article , let us now take for u the potential of a given mass M , placed anywhere .
Then if f be the density , at the point ( x , y , z ) , of the matter composing M , we shall have D2u= 4zr .
Let the surface ( h , l k ) be within the surface ( h2 , k ) , and let Mi be all that part of MI which is within the former surface , and M2 all that part which is within the latter ( so that M , includes M , ) .
Also letf(h ) be still taken for d , in equation ( 3 .
) , art .
2 ; then D20=0 , and the last term on the right of that equation becomes 4[SSSJf ( A)dxdydz]^2 .
Now the whole mass included between the two surfaces is M2'-Ml ; hence the above integral is equal to 4r(M , -M , )/ ( h ) , in which h is put for the parameter of some surface ( h , k ) , which lies between ( hl , k ) and ( h2 , k ) , and cuts the mass M2-Ml .
If the mass M be concentrated at a point between the two surfaces , then h is the parameter of the surface ( h , k ) which passes through that point .
In the general case , however , equation ( 3 .
) becomes nf(h2 ) [ 5 ]l J - &lt; nf(h1 ) [ Qk ]= 4rMM,2f(h2)+4iM , f(hl)+4z(M M2-M)(h ) .
" m k-{l~o~ ~~ L3 _kdk Jet V , , V2 be put for the potentials on M of the two infinitesimal shells(hL , k ) kh , k , with densities f(h ) , f'(h2 ) respectively ; then this equation , multiplied by dk , gives V2--Vl= ( -M2f(h2)+MIf(h1)+(M2-M , )f(h))d ... . .
( 9 .
) Y , --Vn 7 Suppose now that the mass M is unity , and is concentrated at a point between the two surfaces , then M1=0 , M2=l , and ( 9 .
) becomes V2 , -V --7l ( f(h)-f(h2 ) where h is the parameter of the surface which passes through the point .
Let the value of h which makes the surface ( h , k ) extend to infinity be denoted by ho ; then putting h , =ho , we have V2=O ( art .
7 ) , and the last equation gives 47xdk V , = -(fP(h)-f(h ) ) ; and again , if this value of VI be substituted , the same equation gives here V , is the potential of an infinitesimal shell on an exterior point , and V2 on an interior point .
These expressions suppose that the densities of the shells are f'(h , ) , f'(h2 ) ; hence , changing the densities to unity , and h2 to h , in the second , we obtain the following results : The potential of the infinitesimal shell h , , +dk ) ( density =1 ) upon an exterior point is 4w'dk nN(hl ) fa(ho )-f(h ) ) ; and upon an interior point , it is $4~r , dk S dh nf ( h ) ( f(h)-f(h ) ) .
Now f(h ) ( art .
6 ) is , -- ; hence the above expressions become , for an exterior point , n- ) ' ... ... h(E ) and for an interior point , 4d d ; ( hl ) ' 4(h ) .
( I. ) 9 .
In the expression ( E. ) , the value of h at the lower limit of the integral is the parameter of the surface which passes through the attracted point , and the potential has therefore the same value at all points of that surface ; hence THEOREM V. The extwnal eqtipotential surfaces of the homogeneous infinitesimal shell ( h , , dk ) are the surfaces ( h , k ) , in which h is arbitrary and k invariable .
The expression ( I. ) is independent of the position of the ( interior ) attracted point ; hence THEOREM VI .
The homogeneous infinitesimal shell ( h , , kdk ) exercises no force on an interior mass .
It follows evidently that the homogeneous finite shell ( h , , k ) possesses the same property .
8 The preceding articles contain all that is essential .
But it may be as well to deduce the expression for the potential , on an exterior point , of the finite homogeneous shell ( h k ) .
Let , v , 9 be the coordinates of the attracted point .
The expression ( E. ) , art .
8 , is a function of h , and through ha function of k ; for h , at the lower limit of the integral .
is a function of k , , ~ , k , determined by the equation ( art .
3 ) f( , 4 , ~ , h , k)=-0O ... ... ... ( 10 .
) ( I assume , for simplicity , that h0o is independent of k. ) We have then to integrate ( E. ) with respect to k , from k ' to k ' " .
Now putting F(h ) for the integral in ( E. ) , we have F(h)dk=kcF(h ) -F'(h)dh ; and , between the limits k ' , k " , this gives k ' , F(h)dk =k F(h " ) 'F(h')--S^kF ( h)dh ; where h " , Ph are the values of h corresponding to k " , c ' , and given by the relation f( ?
, , h , kh , )=O .
The actual value of F(h ) isj ( ) and therefore F'(h)= ; hence the required potential is n4 Ai){ ' - " it kk o ' dli +h where k , in the last integral , is the function of h determined by the equation ( 10 .
) .
11 .
To verify this in the case of the ellipsoid , we have e2 y2 _2 a2+h+b2+h+c +h ' ; here Dk-=2 b+h+ )=(h ) and -Q+4-=-0 , whence n=4 ; therefore +(a)== S^(S=((h +h)(2h+ h)( c+h X Also h'= oc .
Let us take i'=0 , k"=1 , h , =0 , so that the formula ( P. ) will give the potential , on an external point ( ) , v , : ) , of the homogeneous solid ellipsoid 2 b2.2 Then I(hi , )abc ; and h , k being now connected by the equation 2 .
^2 h+2 h. a2 + hTb2 ?
h+c2+-h-k we have h'= o , and h"= the positive root of this equation when k= 1 .
The expression ( P. ) then becomes K2 + h+ b2 +-h c+-h dh c ( ( a2 + h ) ( h+ )(c2 + h ) ) ?
which is the well-known value of the potential .
* The arbitrary constant , which might be introduced , would disappear in the result .
9 shall conclude with an independent demonstration of the Theorem IV .
art .
6 .
Considering h as a function of x , y , z , k , by virtue of the equation f(x , y , z , h , k)=O , we have Df(h)=f'(h)Q2+f'(h)D2h ( f(h ) being any function of h , and the notation being that explained in art .
1 ) .
Hence the condition of the possibility of satisfying the equation D2y(h)=0 , is that .
2be expressible as a function of h ; if this be the case , f(h ) will be determined by the equation j , ( l= D2 We have then to show that this condition will be fulfilled if the function f(x , y , h , k ) be such that D2k=p(h ) , Q2 ; i+nd/ =k ?
It was proved in art .
3 that the latter of these equations gives Qh .
Qk =fl , and also that dk ki -.h h f'om which we obtain Q2 dk Qd2= ( ( )- ' Q=-41-- ' ^-nZh , Q.-n ( 11 .
) Now suppose k expressed as a function of x , y , z , h ; then considering h implicitly a function of x , y , Z , , we have , by two differentiations with respect to x , dk dk dhA d0=+dh d.~ ... ... ... . .
( 12 .
) dek d2k dh d2k1dh 2 dk d2h ?
=2+2 dh-d*x d+ jhW j+ da dT.2 ' Let the value of dh derived from ( 12 .
) be introduced in the last equation , and the similar results be written with respect to y and z ; then we obtain by addition , / dk : -I , dk dk dk dk O=D2-2( ) 2d , d ) +dQ + ADh ' hence the second and third terms of ( 13 .
) destroy one another ; also )"k-=:(h ) , and dk n dh= --Q by ( 11 .
) ; thus ( 13 .
) becomes , finally , D2h D2h 1 ( p(h)-X Q 2=0 , or -Q2 ( h ) .
hh It follows that the equation D2f(h ) will be satisfied if f(h ) be determined by the equation f"(h ) 1 that is , if I( )=S which is the theorem in question .
This demonstration might have been given at the beginning of the investigation , and the theorem might have been made the foundation of the whole .
But as there is nothing on the face of the assumed differential equations ( 5 .
) , art .
3 , to suggest the possibility of satisfying the condition Df(h)=O 0 , the whole process would then have acquired the character of a verification , rather than of a demonstration following the natural order of discovery , in which latter form I wished it to appear .
