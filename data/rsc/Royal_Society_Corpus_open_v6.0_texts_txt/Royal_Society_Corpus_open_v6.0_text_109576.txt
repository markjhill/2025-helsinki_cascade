Continuation of an Account of a peculiacr Arrangement in the Arteries distributed on the Muscles of slow-moving Animals , 8 ; c. In a Letter from Mr. Anthony Carlisle to John Symmons , Esq. F.R.S. Read December 8 , 1803 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1804 , p. 17 .
] Since the communication of his former paper on that subject , the author has collected further illustrations respecting the connexion between the disposition of the blood-vessels and the actions of the muscles .
His first observations relate to the spermatic and intercostal arteries , and those of the diaphragm in men ; which , he finds , are distributed in a different manner from those of the ordinary muscles .
Compared with the distribution of the coronary arteries , it is found that the latter are much more subdivided or arborescent than any other set , and that accordingly these supply the heart , -a muscle whose actions we know are more rapid than those of any other part of the muscular system .
It is hence inferred , that any impediment to the accustomed course of the blood , flowing through muscles , induces a. corresponding diminution in their power of action ; and that wherever we find cylindrical arteries emitting few lateral branches , we may conclude that they appertain to muscles of slow but in general of long-continued motion .
Of this , instances are given in the human eye , the swimming-bladder of fishes , the intestinum ileum of the Cavia Aguti , and various animals of the amphibious class .
The better to illustrate his observations , the author has added figures of the swimming-bladder of the tench , and of the ileum of the Aguti .
