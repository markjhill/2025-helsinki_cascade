300 Introduction .
These experiments were begun in June , 1903 .
The plants used were raised from seed obtained from Messrs. Sutton .
The course of inheritance in regard to flower colour was the main object of the enquiry .
Preliminary Statement of Results .
There are as regards colour five easily-distinguishable types of Antirrhinum flowers , namely:\#151 ; 1 .
White\#151 ; Lips and tube pure white ( PI .
4 , fig. 1 ) .
2 .
Yellow\#151 ; Lips brimstone-yellow ; tube ivory .
The ivory tube is distinctly recognisable from the pure white tube of the albino ( fig. 2 ) .
3 .
Ivory\#151 ; Lips and tube ivory .
Ivory colour is due to a faint tingeing with yellow , and this type may be regarded as a very pale yellow , but the pigment is , perhaps , distinct from that which gives the yellow colour to Type 2 ( fig. 3 ) .
4 .
Crimson\#151 ; Lips crimson ; tube magenta ( fig. 4 ) .

The Inheritance of Flower Colour in Antirrhinum majus .
289 The colours of all these types are sap-colours , not plastid-colours .
Forms of the crimson and magenta types occur in which the tube is ivory , while the lips are magenta or crimson respectively ( figs. 7 and 6 ) .
The term " delila " was used by Professor De Vries* for such forms and has been adopted in this paper .
Yellow and magenta colours are produced by the corresponding sap-colours in the cells .
Crimson colour in the lips is due to the simultaneous presence of magenta and yellow saps in the cells .
That such is the case is easily seen in a microscopical examination of the tissue of the lips of a crimson flower .
Groups of cells containing pure yellow or pure magenta saps are found among crimson cells in which the colour is undoubtedly due to a mixture .
With the exception of the albino type , the flowers of all types used have , irrespective of the colour of lips and tube , a constant orange-yellow palate ; smaller patches similar in colour generally appear at the base of the tube on either side .
This summer Mr. Bateson has shown me white types , some of which had a little orange-yellow colour on the palate , while others had in addition the yellow patches on the tube .
Matings will be made with these types , but all whites employed and described in the experimental work have been entirely without colour .
The inheritance of the corolla colours can be represented by the following factors , which have been found to follow the Mendelian inheritance :\#151 ; Y.\#151 ; A factor representing yellowj* colour in the lips associated with ivory tube-colour .
I.\#151 ; A factor representing ivory colour in the lips .
L.\#151 ; " magenta " " T.\#151 ; " " " in the tube .
Small letters , y , i , etc. , denote the absence of these factors .
From experimental evidence it appears that:\#151 ; 1 .
All zygotes , from which Y is absent , are white , though they may contain any of the factors I , L , and T. 2 .
The factor T is not manifested unless L is also present in the zygote ; that is , no magenta colour appears in the tube unless magenta colour be also present in the lips .
3 .
All zygotes containing Y are coloured .
The actual colour may be modified and determined by the presence of one or more of the remaining factors .
A zygote containing Y only or Y and T is yellow .

t This , of course , does not refer to palate colour , which may be regarded as a separate character .
Miss M. Wheldale .
The Inheritance of [ Feb. 12 , 4 .
Ivory is " dominant " * over yellow ; a zygote containing Y and I or Y , I , and T , is ivory .
5 .
Since magenta superposed upon yellow gives crimson , a zygote containing Y , L , and T is crimson , Y and L only , crimson delila .
6 .
Magenta superposed upon ivory gives , since the latter is very pale , magenta .
A zygote containing Y , I , L , and T is magenta , Y , I , and L only , magenta delila .
The five types described are readily distinguishable and quite discontinuous .
Throughout the experimental work , all individuals met with have been at once assigned , without any difficulty , to one of the above classes .
Magenta colour , however , appears in at least three distinct shades or degrees of concentration , which are probably determined by definite factors , though evidence on this point is not yet complete .
Upon a yellow ground , these shades of magenta give the corresponding shades of crimson .
In many cases deep magentas have been bred from the lighter magentas , so we must conclude that lighter forms are dominant to darker in the same sense that the pale form , ivory , is dominant to yellow .
Similar phenomena have been found to occur in Sweet Peas and Stocks.^ The concentration of sap-colour in the tube and lips is generally approximately the same ; the lips are somewhat darker in appearance , but this difference depends probably on texture and not on difference in depth of pigmentation .
The tube may also be darker in shade than the lips , and this is the case in one or two types not yet investigated .
The magenta sap-colour sometimes appears in irregular fleckings or stripings , thus giving striped forms .
If the striping occurs in the magenta type , the ivory ground-colour shows where the magenta sap fails and the flower may be described as ivory flecked or striped with magenta .
When the magenta sap fails in the crimson type , the yellow ground-colour appears and the flower would be described as yellow flecked or striped with crimson .
No flecking or striping of ivory on yellow has ever been observed .
In several cases , where striped and non-striped forms have been crossed , striping has disappeared in Fi , and has not appeared again either in Fa or F3 .
In another case of striped x non-striped ( a paler magenta ) , the deeper striping persisted in Fi on the paler magenta ground ; a striped Fi has been given * " Dominant " is here used to denote that the lighter colours overlie or suppress the darker , as ivory , for example , conceals yellow ; and not in its strict sense of expressing the relationship between a pair of allelomorphic characters : ivory and yellow are not , of course , allelomorphic to each other .

also in the mating of two striped forms .
In the two latter eases the results are not yet complete .
The original wild Antirrhinum appears to be of the magenta type .
uEeversion " to this old form , which so often happens when crimson , ivory , or yellow types are crossed with white , is explained by the introduction into the .zygote of the factors I , L ( and T ) by the white parent .
The introduction of the factor I alone will bring about " reversion " when L is already present in the zygote .
The experimental evidence is not yet sufficient to determine whether the phenomena in Antirrhinum are fundamentally similar to those observed for Sweet Peas and Stocks .
In the two latter cases , * production of colour depends on the simultaneous presence in the zygote of two factors C and II ; the absence of both or either of these factors from the zygote renders it white .
The colour formed by the meeting of the two factors is red .
To treat the case of Antirrhinum on parallel lines , we might suppose the production of yellow , the base-colour , so to speak , to be due to the presence in the zygote , not of one factor only , but of two factors .
Any zygote containing both would be yellow ; one only or neither would be white .
If such is the case , whites should be found , which , when crossed together , give yellow .
Whether this is the case or not cannot be decided yet , since the results of crosses between whites are not known .
All phenomena so far observed in Antirrhinum could be equally well represented on the two-factor theory , provided we assume that the whites , originally mated with coloured types , contained one of the factors which constitute colour ; this is quite possible , since so few white individuals ( only three ) were employed in the matings .
The question , then , as to whether colour in Antirrhinum depends on the meeting of two complementary factors or not , must remain open for the present .
If two factors be necessary , albinos should be found , which , when mated , give colour ( here yellow ) , as in the cases of Sweet Peas and Stocks ; if , on the other hand , only one factor is necessary , then no two albinos when mated will ever produce colour , and the case will be analogous rather to the phenomena observed in animals .
In the Sweet Peas and Stocks , moreover , the colour of the zygote may be further determined by the presence of a third blue factor B , which changes the red colour to purple ; but B has no effect unless C and B are also present , and thus may be carried by an albino without producing a sensible effect .
Quite comparable to this third factor in Peas and Stocks are the factors I , * * Third Report .
Miss M. Wheldale .
The Inheritance of [ Feb. 12 , L , and T in Antirrhinum , none of which produce a sensible effect unless yellow is also present .
Any of these may be carried by an albino .
The factor I modifies yellow , giving ivory .
The factor L , superposed upon ivory , gives magenta ; with yellow it blends , giving crimson ; finally , the third factor T is not manifested unless L in addition is present .
Details of Various Matings .
White x other Types .
White x Yellow Crimson-striped:\#151 ; The type yellow crimson-striped is , as explained above , really crimson , in which the magenta sap occurs in irregular stripings and fleckings , so that the lips appear yellow striped with crimson and the tube ivory striped with magenta ; a corresponding delila form exists , having an ivory tube .
White has always been found to breed true , but the selfings of the other parent unfortunately failed , so that its constitution can only be deduced from the results of crossing .
Fi consisted of magentas and magenta delilas ( Table I , p. 303 ) .

295 three factors only ; the introduction of a fourth factor would give magenta and ivory individuals .
A similar diagram constructed for four factors shows us that , as regards the composition of the F3 they give on selfing , there are 16 kinds of magentas in Fa .
Among 13 magenta plants taken at random in F2 and selfed , 8 out of the 16 kinds were found .
( For Case 1 , Table II gives F3 resulting from all the Fa individuals selfed .
) The remaining 8 would doubtless occur among a larger selection of F2 individuals .
Of magenta delilas , there are theoretically 8 kinds ; 6 plants taken at random gave 2 .
Of crimsons , theoretically 8 ; 5 plants gave 3 .
Of crimson delilas , 4 ; 3 plants gave 2 .
Of ivories , 4 ; 6 plants gave 3 .
And of yellows , 2 ; 3 plants gave both .
A corresponding diagram can easily be constructed for Case 2 .
From such a diagram one learns that the F2 magentas are theoretically of 8 kinds ; 11 plants taken at random gave 7 out of the 8 .

Of crimsons , 4 ; 6 plants gave 4 .
Of crimson delilas , 2 ; only 1 plant was taken .

Similarly , from a diagram constructed for Case 3 , we find there are 8 possible magenta delilas ; 5 plants gave 5 .
( Table IY gives F3 for Case 3 .
) Of crimson delilas , 4 ; 3 plants gave 2 .
Of ivories , 4 ; 1 plant only was taken .
Of yellows , 2 ; 1 plant only was taken .
Finally , from a diagram for Case 4 , we find there are 4 possible magenta delilas ; 6 plants gave 2 .
( Table Y gives F3 for Case 4 .
) One white plant gave whites only .
No other F2 plants were taken .
It is clear also from Diagram I that there are 8 possible albinos .
Various yellows this year have been crossed with a number of F2 whites as a means of testing for the characters which may be borne by an albino .

The type rose has ivory lips tinged with magenta and a pale magenta tube .
The individuals used in crossing were found to breed true .
Crosses were made between this and most of the other types , but sufficient numbers have not been obtained in Fa to give a reliable indication of the results .
A type , where " rose , " i.e. , a tingeing with magenta , is superposed upon a yellow ground ( the case where the factor I is missing ) , appeared in Fa , together with delila forms of both types ; this would lead to the supposition that " rose " may be represented by a Mendelian factor .
An interesting point has arisen in connection with the cross rose x a deep crimson delila .
The cross-bred is a deep magenta , in which the tube takes the same shade as the lips .
This fact suggests , as pointed out elsewhere ( p. 301 ) , that there may be a coupling between the shade of tube- and lip-vol .

Experiments of De Vries on .
In the ' Mutationstheorie/ Lief .
IV , pp. 194\#151 ; 206 , Professor De Vries gives an account of experiments in crossing certain varieties of Antirrhinum majus .
It is stated that yellow colour was not taken into consideration and experiments were confined to the white and red varieties .
The following is a description of the types mentioned :\#151 ; Roth ... ... ... . .
Tube and lips red , the lips deeper Fleischfarbig ... Tube and lips pale red Delila ... ... ... .
Tube pale or white , lips fairly deep red Weiss ... ... ... . .
White , often with a distinct very pale red tinge Professor De Vries regards red as being made up of fleischfarbig F and delila D , two dominant characters , and white as producing two characters , w and w ' , recessive to F and D respectively .
A red Antirrhinum was crossed with white , giving an Fi like the red parent .
From the Fi cross-breds on selfing , four types were obtained :\#151 ; the original red , delila , flesh-colour , and the original white , roughly in the proportions 9 : 3 : 3 :1 .

Fw ( flesh-colour ) 4- ww7 ( white ) Professor De Vries showed that a delila and a flesh-colour in F2 gave , on selfing , an F3 consisting of delilas only and flesh-colours only respectively .
Other F2 delilas gave delilas and whites and other F2 flesh-colours gave flesh-colours and whites .
Further , among the F2 reds , some gave reds and flesh-colours in the proportion 3 :1 , while others gave reds and delilas in the same proportion .
Professor De Vries has kindly informed me that his types correspond to the following types mentioned in this paper , namely:\#151 ; Roth to Magenta Delila " " delila Fleischfarbig " Rose Weiss " Ivory " ( tinged ) " Rose delila Rose x a delila form has been found to give a deep magenta whole form ( p. 299 ) and the result is consistent with the supposition that there is an interdependency between the shade of colour in lips and tube ; the magenta tube-colour , introduced by rose , takes , in the cross-bred , the same shade as the lip-colour .

, F.L.S. ( Communicated by Dr. D. H. Scott , F.R.S. Received January 24 , \#151 ; Read February 21 , 1907 .
) ( Abstract .
) The first object of this communication is to put forward a simple graphic method of recording measurements concerning the longitudinal symmetry of plants , and to test its efficiency as a means of solving morphological problems .
The method is as follows:\#151 ; Measurements of the successive internodes of a stem are made , and are recorded on squared paper as successive ordinates ; the resultant curve is termed the internode curve .
The longitudinal distances apart of other members are dealt with in the same manner , and ranged into other curves .
The second object of the paper is to describe the general and particular results obtained by use of the method .
In a typical herb , the internode curve of the main axis is a regular and characteristic ascending-descending one ( see Curve 1 in fig. 1 ) , while those of Fio .
