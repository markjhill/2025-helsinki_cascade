The Construction and Properties of a new Quadratrix to the Hyperbola , By Mr ... Perks .
Communicated by Mr Abr .
de Moivre , F. R. S. THe Circle , Ellipsis and Hyberbola being not Geometrically Quadrable ( as infinite others ) there have been two ways made use of to find their Area 's .
1 .
By Converging Series , whereby Approaches are made nearer and nearer , according to the exactness desired .
2 .
By Quadratices , that is , Mechanical Curves , which determine the Length of certain Lines , whose Squares or Rectangles give the Area of the Figure desired .
Of this sort is the old Quadratrix of Dinostratus , by which the Circle and Ellipse are squared ; and another sort ( for the same purpose ) I inserted in the Transactions about 5 years ago .
Since that , having found the Construction of a Curve , from whence ( besides its own Quadrature and Rectification ) the Quadrature of the Hyperbola is derived , I thought the following Account might not ( to some ) be unacceptable .
Let A B , C D , be two straight Rulars joined at B , and there making a right Angle .
( Their length according to the largeness of the Figure you will describe .
) OF is another Rular somewhat longer than A B. Near the one end E , let a little Truckle-wheel ( represented edge-wise by g h , and made of a thin Plate of Brass or Iron ) be fastned to the Rular by a Pin ( i , ) thorough its Center , so that the Wheel may turn about upon the Pin ( i ) tight to the Rular without joggling .
On the under side , of this Rular ( the side from the Eye in the Scheme ) let there be pinned or glewed a little piece of Wood ( in the form of a Quadrant , the part which is seen being marked k l ) whose edge ( or limb ) k l , is an arch of a Circle of Center ( i , ) and Radius ih ( the same with the little Wheel .
) The design of this piece of Wood is , that in the several Positions of the Rular E F , the circular Limb kl always touching and sliding by the edge of the Rular A B , the Center of the Wheel may be always in a line ( i m ) parallel to the Rular A B. In the Rular CD make MB=ih or i k , and at M fasten a little Pin , and another to the Rular OF near the Wheel , as at p. To these two Pins let be fastned the two ends of a String M R , so that its whole length ( from Pin to Pin ) +p i , be equal to the intended Axis of the Curve T W. The Instrument being thus prepared , let a strong Rular S O , be fastned ( or held fast ) upon the Paper or Plain that the Curve is to be drawn upon .
Lay the Rular OF from M towards A , and parallel to A B , so that the String lye all straight along the edge of the Rular OF from M to p , the point Sk of the Quadrantal piece of Wood resting upon the edge of the Rular A B. Then with a small Pin at M keeping the String close to the edge of the Rular E F , and with your other hand upon the end E , keeping the Wheel tight to the Paper or Plain , move the Pin String and Rular OF from M towards O , the Rular CD sliding along by the fastned Rular SO in a right line , the Wheel gh will by its motion describe the desired .
Curve T V. Note , The Semi-diameter of the little Wheel must be about the Sum of the thicknesses of the two Rulars OF and A B , that it may touch the Paper .
Also it will be convenient that its edge be thin , and a little rough , that it may not slide flat-ways , and that it may leave a visible impression .
From this Construction the following Properties are demonstrable .
I. It is evident from the Construction , that the Sum of the Tangent and Subtangent is every where equal to the same given Line =MR+Ri=T W. ) for the String ( first straight at T W , afterwards making an Angle at R ) being every where the same , the Line Ri ( or Rp +p i ) is always the Tangent , and the Remainder RM the Subtangent ; the Contact of the Wheel with the Plain , being the point of the Curve to which they belong .
II .
It hence follows , that any assignable part of the Curve is Rectifiable , or equal to any assignable straight Line .
In Fig. 2 .
Let FAE be a part of the Curve , its Vertex F. HDd is the Line described by the motion of the Pin R ( in Fig. 1 .
) and may be shown to the As symptote to the Curve .
FHa perpendicular to HD Let A be given point in the Curve , AD the Tangent , and BD the Subtangent to the same point A. Let a be another point in the Curve infinitely near to A. to which let ad be the Tangent , and bd the Subtangent .
Draw A G , ag perpendicular to FH and A B , ab perpendicular to H D. By the Construction AD+DB=add b. Let a~ be made equal to a D , and draw D ~ .
then because ad+bd=AD+D B. Subtract bD and aD ( or a ~ ) from both Sums ( Equals from Equals ) there remains ~d+dD=Aa+Bb ( or C a ) Aa C , Dd~ are like Triangles ( or differing infinitely little from such ) therefore Ca ( B b ) : A a : : ~ d : D d. and compounding Bb+A a : A a : : ~d+D d : D d. Alternating Bb+A a : ~d+D d : : A a : D d. But Bb~ Aa=~d+Dd ( as is shown above ) therefore Aa= D d. Aa is the fluxional Particle of the Curve F A , and Dd is the fluxional Particle of the Line H D : These Fluxions or Augments , being equal , and their flowing quantities beginning together , are themselves therefore equal , viz. FA=H D. Let FG= x. GA ( = H B ) = y. AD= t. BD= S. So is the Curve FA=HD=y+ S : that is , the Curve from the Vertex to any given point therein , is equal to the Sum of its Ordinate , and Subtangent to the same point which is its second Property .
III .
The next Property ( and whereupon I call it the Hyperbolic Quadratrix ) is this , In Fig. 2 .
let FAE be a part of the Curve , ( &amp;c. as before .
) FIKH is a Square upon the line F H. ~IL is an Equilater Hyperbola whose Vertex is I , its Asymptotes H O , H R. its Ax HI ~ .
From a given point L in the Hyperbola ( below its Vertex I ) draw LA parallel to the Asymptote R H , intersecting the Diagonal IH in M , FH in G , and touching the Quadratrix in A. I say , that the Hyperbolic Area ILM is equal to a Rectangle , whose sides are the Ordinate G A , and twice F H , the Ax to the Quadratrix , that is , Trilin .
ILM=2FH~G A. Let FH= a , FG= x , GA= y. because of the Hyperbola GLXGH ( L S ) =F~ ~ .
therefore GL =FH q/ G H ; and LM=FH q/ G H~H ( M G ) that is , LM=a a/ a-x a+x=2ax xx/ ~ , and consequently the fluxion of the Area IL~ In the Rectangle triangle AD B , AB=a x , BD = S , AD=t=a S ; then is ADq=ABq+ BD q : or aa2aS+ SS =aa2ax+xx+S S , which being reduced , gives S=2ax xx/ 2 a Let la be a right line supposed infinitely near and parallel to L A , and intersecting AB in C. Because of like triangles AC a , AB D ; A B : B D : : A C : Ca that is a x : S ( = 2axx x/ 2 a ) : : x : y. therefore y= 2axx x/ 2 aa~ax x. Multiply each by 2 a , and it is 2ay 2axx x/ a x x. The Flowing quantity of ~ay is 2ay and the flowing quantity of 2axx x/ a ~x is theHyperbolic Area ILM ( as is shown before .
) These two Area 's beginning together at F and I , and having every where equal Fluxions , or Augments , are therefore themselves every where equal .
N. The Quadrature of the Trilinear Figure ILM being thus found , any other Area bounded with the Curve line I L. and any other Right Lines is also given .
IV .
Supposing the same things as in the precedent Proposition , I say , that the Area of the Quadratrix FabHF is equal to half the square of F g , wanting the Cube of Fg divided by six F H , or FabHF=x x/ x xx x/ 6 a. The Fluxion of this Area is the Rectangle CabB=ax~y =axx2axx x/ 2 aaaxx=xxx x/ 2 a x. The flowing quantity of xx is ~~ x : And the flowing quantity tity of x x/ 2 a~ is ~xx x/ 6 a [ as is easily shewn by bringing back these slowing quantities to their respective Fluxious .
] And hence also it follows , that the whole Area continued on infinitely towards E , is one third of the Square FIK H ; or 1/ 3 a a. Eor supposing x=a the Area above becomes a a/ 2 a a/ 6 a a/ 3~ While I was considering the other Properties of this Curve , and had given some account of them to my Ingenious Friend Mr John Colson , he returned me a Letter with the Addition of the Quadrature of the Curves Area , which I had not then enquired into : V. Supposing still the same things , I say that the Solid made by the conversion of the Area FabHF about the Line Hb as an Axis , is equal to a Cylinder whose Radius is FH= a , and height equal to x x/ 2 a x3/ 2 aa+8 x4/ a3 And the whole Solid made by conversiou of the whole Figure infinitely continued , is equal to an eighth part of a Cylinder , whose Radius and Height are each equal to FH or a. Let P/ D express the Proportion of the Periforie and Diameter of a Circle .
Then is P/ D ab quad .
the Area of a Circle whose Radius Is a b. And because Ca=y= xx x/ 2 ax/ a ~ the fluxion of the Solid is P/ D a b. q. xxx x/ 2 ax or P/ Da x2xxx x/ 2 a x/ a x P/ Da x 3/ 2xx+~/ 2 ax x whose flowing quantity is P/ D axxxx x/ 2 + x4/ 8 a. Which Solid being divided by P/ D aa ( the Area of a Circle whose Radius is a ) gives xx / 2 axx x/ 2 aa+ x4/ 8 aa for the height-of a Cylinder on the said circular Base , and equal to the Solid made by conversion of the Area FabHF about the Line Hb as an Axis .
When x=a ( that is when the whole Figure is turned about its Asymptote ) the height x x/ 2 a x3/ 2 aa+ x4/ 8 aa become 1/ ~ a VI .
The Curve surface of the Solid generated by the Conversion of the Figure FabHF about H B , is equal to the Curve surface of a Cylinder whose Radius is a , and height equal to xx x/ 2 4a+xx x/ 1 2a a. And the whole Curve Surface of the Solid insinitely continued , is equal to one third part of the Curve Surface of a Cylinder whose Radius and Height are equal to FH or a. Which may be demonstrated after the manner of the precedent Proposition .
VII .
The Radius of the Curvature of any Particle of the Quadratrix is t t/ a x. and this found Geometrically .
In Fig. 3 .
FAE is the Quadratrix , HD the Asymptote , AD the Tangent , BD the Subtangent to a given point A. Make BV=A D. Upon V rise the perpendicular V W. from A draw AWE perpendicular to the Tangent A D , till it meet AWE in W. So is AWE the Radius of the Curvature at A. VIII .
This Curve may be continued on infinitely above the point F ( but by a different and more operose way of Construction ) whose Properties will be these .
1 .
The Difference of its Tangent and Subtangent ( taking the Subtangent in the Line H S ) will be always equal to the same given Line FH or a. That is , as t+s= a , below F , so ts=a above F. 2 .
As below F the Curve Line is equal to the Sum of its Ordinate and Subtangent , so above , it is equal to their Difference or S-y .
3 .
As below F , 2ay=IL M , so above 2ay=I~ ~ .
All which ( and its other Properties ) may be demonstrated as the Precedent mutatis mutandis .
IX .
With a little variation in the precedentConstruction may the Logarithmick Curve be constructed , which is also a Quadratrix to the Hyperbola .
In Fig. 1 .
omitting the String MR P , let the distance MR be equal to the Subtangent of the intended Logarithmick Curve ( which , as it is known , is invariable .
) Stick a Pin at R in the Rular C D , to which apply the Rular E F , so that the edge of the little Quadrank k l , resting upon the Rular A B , the distance Mi be equal to M R. Then keeping the Rular OF tight to the Pin R and Rular A B , slide the Rular CD along in a straight Line ( by the Rular or Line S O. ) So will the Wheel gh describe a part of the Logarithmick Curve T V , whose Subtangent is every where M R. X. Fig. 2 .
Let FAE represent the Logarithmick Curve , whose Subtangent is equal to F H. LI~ is an Equilater Hyperbola ( &amp;c. as before ~ III .
) Let FG= x , Ga= y. FH ( = B D ) = a. GH ( = L S ) =a x. AC= xCa= y. Then A C : C a : : A B : B D. that is x : y : : : a x : a : : a : a a/ a-x .
therefore ay=a a/ a-x ~x .
The Flowing quantity of a ~y is a y ; and the Flowing quantity of a a/ a-x ~x is the Hyperbolick Area FILG ( for by the nature of the Hyperbola GL=a a/ a-x ) therefore is the Hyperbolick Area FILG equal to a y , a Rectangle whose sides are the Subtangent ( B D=F H ) and Ordinate GA ( as here accounted ) of the Logarithmick Curve .
