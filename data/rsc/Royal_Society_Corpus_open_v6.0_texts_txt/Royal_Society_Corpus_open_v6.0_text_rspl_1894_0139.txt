A bar is subjected to a gradually increasing tension , and the extensions for a series of loads are measured .
If the loads are plotted as ordinates and the extensions as abscissae , a load-strain j curve is obtained .
In the case of many materials the load-strain curve is fairly continuous ( figs. 1 and 2 ) .
But with certain qualities I of iron and steel there is a remarkable irregularity in the curve | ( fig. 3 ) .
Up to the elastic limit a the strain is proportional to the I stress , and Oa is a straight line .
Beyond a the strains increase faster than the stresses .
At some point , b , termed the yield point , a very large and abrupt permanent elongation is produced .
The bar continues to elongate for some time without increase of load , or even apparently with some decrease of load .
At some point , c , the material is so hardened that further deformation can only be produced by increase of load , and a continuous load-strain curve , cdf , is obtained .
% In some tests of very long iron and steel bars , by a Committee of the Institution of Civil Engineers , * ' the extensions for equal increments of load were carefully measured , and load-strain diagrams were plotted .
These diagrams showed for the first time the abrupt Fig. 1 .

increase of extension at b , and the Committee gave to that point the name yielding point .
It appeared from their experiments that there was a yield point also in compression , though hardly so well marked ns in tension .
Since these experiments , autographic apparatus has en U8ed for describing the load-strain curve during a test .
The autographic load-strain curves exhibit the yield point in the case of certain materials in a very striking way .

On th Yield Point of Iron [ Dec. 13^ If at some point , d , the load is removed and again imposed , then in the reloading a curve , edf , is obtained without any marked yield point .
The material is physically a different material , when it has been strained beyond the yield point .
The new curve is similar to the curves figs. 1 and 2 , and unlike the primitive curve , fig. a for the material .
In the case of a steel which will slightly harden if heated and suddenly cooled , the load-strain curve is Oacdf , if it jg tested unhardened , and very similar to edf if it is hardened before testing .
Fig. 4 shows load-strain curves for two pieces of the same steel unhardened and tempered by heating and sudden cooling .

NORMAL MILD STEEL As the yield point only occurs in materials which have been rolled or hammered in a plastic state , it has been supposed to be due to some purely mechanical condition of constraint produced by pressure , which could be broken down if the stress reached the yield point .
But auy purely mechanical condition of constraint , such as is pro* duced by cold hammering , is entirely removed by annealing .
On the other hand , annealing the bar before testing does not alter the yield point .
If anything , it makes it more distinctly marked .
Further , if the bar is strained to the point d and the load removed , or if it is hardened by sudden cooling , and the bar then annealed and again 1894 .

181 tested , it is found to have returned to a condition almost identical with that which it had at first .
In testing again , a new yield point appears , and the new load curve is such , a curve as egh .
Osmond appears first to have suggested that in the case of iron or steel any stress which produces a permanent deformation is attended by a rearrangement of the atoms within the molecules of the metal , such as marks the passage of the iron from one state into another allotropic state.* The following experiments on alternate straining and annealing , in which straining appears always to produce effects like those which occur in hardening steel , and which , like them , are completely destroyed by annealing , would be most easily understood , if Osmond 's view were accepted .
In the following experiments a bar was alternately tested to a stress somewhat beyond the yield point and then annealed .
The annealing oven , shown.in section in fig. 5 , was an iron chamber with Fie .

On th Yield Point of Iron [ Dec. 13 a fire-clay jacket ; the chamber was heated by a row of BunSen burners , the products of combustion passing round the annealing box .
When the bar to be annealed was red-hot it was turned end for end , and shortly after the gas was extinguished , and the chamber allowed to cool down slowly with the bar in it .
Every time the bar was strained beyond the yield point , its diameter sensibly decreased from lateral contraction .
Some further diminution of section was due to oxidation in the annealing oven .
After each annealing the bar was re-measured before re-testing .
In each test an autographic load-strain diagram was taken .
In the final loading the bar was broken .

In annealing , the bar was put into the furnace cold , the gas was then lit , and the bar left until it became dull red in colour .
It was then changed end for end , and after a few minutes the gas was turned off , and the bar allowed to cool in the furnace .
The bar was laid upon the bottom of the furnace , and not protected in any way .
On examining the autograph diagrams ( fig. 6 ) it will be seen that the yield point was reproduced after every annealing in as marked a way as in the first testing .
Reckoning on the area at the beginning of each test , there is a rise in the stress at the yield point from 17'45 tons per sq .

The annealing may have been imperfect .
The yield point reappeared more characteristically in succeeding tests after annealing .
Excluding tests 2 and 3 , the position of the yield point is practically constant during five loadings and annealings .

The bar was protected during annealing by placing it inside an iron tube .
The furnace containing the iron tube was first allowed to get hot , the bar was then inserted , and when heated to a dull red colour it was changed end for end , the gas was turned off , and the bar allowed to cool in the furnace .
The autograph diagrams are given in fig. 8 .
One-minute intervals of time were marked on the diagram during the tests .
The yield point in this case falls from 17*11 to 16*32 tons per sq .

after eight tests and annealings .
The difference is not great .
The total elongation of the bar was 3*76 in .
in eight tests .

The diagram is drawn dotted in fig. 8 .
There is no marked difference in the two diagrams , if the decrease of area due to successive tests and annealings is allowed for .
It is clear from these tests that the change produced in the iron or steel bar by straining beyond the yield point is completely reversed by simple annealing , and this apparently after any number of repetitions of the process .
It appears hardly possible to understand either the- singular abruptness of the load strain curve at the yield point , or the difference of the load strain curves for an unstrained and a strained bar , or the reversal of the change of properties produced during straining by simple annealing , except by supposing that at the yield point there occurs a chemical or molecular or allotropic change of the same kind as that which occurs in ordinary tempering by sudden cooling .
If mere stress can produce a change of this kind , it may be that the stresses produced in sudden cooling also are factors in the changes which occur in that case , If a red-hot bar is plunged into water the surface must cool first .
A condition of stress must arise in which there is a ring tension and radial thrust in the section of the bar .
It is well known that the stresses so set up are often of great intensity .
Bars tear or crack in hardening .
The material may be strained beyond its yield point by the stresses due to cooling .
When bars are subjected to a Wohler test , that is , to a large number of repetitions of straining action , they break ultimately with a stress much less than that which would break them in a simple loading and with a very characteristic fracture .
The outside of the fracture is fine grained , and resembles a crack extending gradually across the section of fracture .
However ductile the material , initially , there is no sign of contraction at the fracture .
The bar breaks like a brittle material .
It seems possible that here also the repetition of the straining action may produce a molecular change in the bar in the neighbourhood of the fracture .
