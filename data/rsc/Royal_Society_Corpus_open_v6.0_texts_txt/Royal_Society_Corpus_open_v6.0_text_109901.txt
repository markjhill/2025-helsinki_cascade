On the Fallacy of the Experiments in which Water is said to have been formed by the Decomposition of Chlorine .

] Some experiments having been communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh , leading to the inference that water is formed during the action of muriatic acid upon certain metals , and consequently that chlorine is decomposed , Sir Humphry was induced to repeat them ; and ascertained that the water being derived from sources not suspected by the authors , their conclusions are unfounded .
Muriatic acid gas was passed through red hot tubes of flint glass , and small portions of water were formed in consequence of its action upon the oxide of lead and the alkali of the glass .
When muriatic acid gas was passed over red hot iron in tubes containing common air , more water was formed in consequence of the union of the hydrogen of the acid with the oxygen of the air ; but when every precaution was taken to avoid such sources of oxygen , the decomposition of muriatic acid gas was unattended by the smallest deposition of aqueous vapour .
When muriate of ammonia is passed through tubes containing metals , it offers results analogous to those of the muriatic acid , and when moisture appears it may be referred to similar causes .
The author concludes with noticing a paper in the Memoires d'Arcueil , by M. Berthollet , containing some slight mistakes as to the progress of his views upon the theory of chlorine .
M. Berthollet states that MM .
Ampere and Dulong had embraced the idea of the simple nature of chlorine previous to Sir FI .
DaTvy , -an assertion which is disproved by reference to the date of the author 's first paper , and also by a quotation of a letter from M. Ampere , written on the 1st of November 1810 .
