The following communications were read :\#151 ; I. , l On the Mineral Constituents of Meteorites .
" By Nevil Story Maskelyne , M.A. , F.R.S. , Professor of Mineralogy , Oxford , and Keeper of the Mineral Department , British Museum .
Received November 3 , 1870 .
( Abstract .
) In the memoir now offered to the Society the author gives the results of his investigation of the meteorites of Breitenbach and of Shalka .
A preliminary notice of two of the minerals occurring in the former , which is of the Siderolite class , was read before the Society in March , 1869 ( Proc. R. S. vol. xvii .
p. 370 ) .
After entering upon the probable history of the Breitenbach Siderolite , and endeavouring to identify it with certain other Siderolites that have been found , or have been recorded as found , in the region extending from 1871 .
] Mineral Constituents of Meteorites .
267 Meissen to Breitenbaeh , the author proceeds to describe the individual minerals which constitute the mass of the Siderolite .
These are : first , a bronzite with the formula ( Mg4 Fe^ ) Si 03 , orthorhombic in its crystalline form .
The crystallography of the mineral was investigated by Dr. Viktor von Lang at the British Museum , and has been published in Pogg .
Annalen , vol. cxxxix .
p. 315 .
Secondly , a mineral composed of silica , having the specific gravity of quartz after fusion , and crystallized in the orthorhombic system .
Since his preliminary notice was published , the crystallography of this substance has been carefully studied by the author , and the details are given in the memoir .
The elements of the crystal are a : b : c : = .
1*7437 i 1 : 3*3120 .
The angles are :\#151 ; 100:101 = 27 ' 46 ' 100:1 10 = 60 ' 10 ' 110:101 = 63 ' 19 ' The optic axes lie in a plane parallel to the plane 010 ; the first mean line being the normal to the plane 10 0 .
They are widely separated , presenting in air an apparent angle of about 107 ' .
There can thus be no question that this mineral is orthorhombic ; and if the tridymite of Vom Rath is , as that distinguished crystallographer asserts it to be , hexagonal in its symmetry , the mineral in the Breitenbach meteorite will be a trimorphic form of silica .
Such a result obtained from the investigation of a meteorite is one of no small interest .
The nickeliferous iron , the chief constituent of the Siderolite , proved on analysis to be an alloy of the formula Fe10 Ni , and contained a trace of copper .
In addition to the two siliceous minerals , the iron encloses occasional crystals of chromite in well-developed octahedra , an iron sulphide , probably troilite , and a small amount of Schreibersite .
The author then proceeds to detail the results obtained from the analysis of the Shalka meteorite .
In 1860 , Haidinger , in his paper on this meteorite ( Sitzber .
d. k. Akad .
Wiss .
Wien , vol. xli .
p. 251 ) , held the entire stone to be made up of a mineral , which he termed Piddingtonite , and which , according to Von Hawr 's analysis , might be a compound of bisilicate and trisilicate of iron and magnesium .
This latter acid silicate , however , which has long haunted the mineralogy of meteorites , no more forms a constituent of this meteorite than does the other acid silicate Shepardite , as Dr. Laurence Smith has shown , enter into the composition of the Bishopville meteorite .
The view held by Haidinger , that this meteorite , though apparently made up of two silicates , a grey and a mottled variety , was nevertheless 268 Prof. Williamson on the Organization of the [ Jan. 26 , composed of a single mineral species varying in colour , is proved by the analytical results given in this memoir .
It has been found to be a bronzite of the formula ( Mg^ Fe^ ) Si 03 , and in association with it there occurs some chromite in distinct crystals .
Rammelsberg has also recently published the results of an examination of this meteorite ( Pogg .
Annalen , vol. cxlii .
p. 275 ) , and finds in it a bronzite associated with 12 per cent , of olivine .
It is probable that the meteorite varies in its composition in different parts , and that Prof. Rammelsberg analyzed that portion where an olivinous ingredient was in appreciable preponderance .
The mottled kind was treated with hydrogen chloride in the cold , and subsequently with potash , and again with hydrogen sulphate and potash , but in each case it was noticed that the action of the acid was confined to that of a solvent .
A little meteoric iron was dissolved , but no appreciable amount of olivine was found in the portion examined in the Laboratory at the British Museum .

" On the Organization of the Catamites of the Coal-measures .
" By W. C. Williamson , F.R.S. , Professor of Natural History in Owens College , Manchester .
Received November 11,1870 .
( Abstract .
) Ever since M. Brongniart established his genus there has prevailed widely a belief that two classes of objects had previously been included under the name of Catamites\#151 ; the one a thin-walled Equise-taceous plant , the Catamites proper , and the other a hard-wooded Gymno-spermous Exogen , known as Calamodendron .
This distinction the author rejects as having no existence , the thick- and thin-walled examples having precisely the same typical structure .
This consists of a central pith , surrounded by a woody zone , containing a circle of woody wedges , and enclosed within a bark of cellular parenchyma .
The Pith has been solid in the first instance , but very soon became fistular , except at the nodes , at each one of which a thin diaphragm of parenchyma extended right across the medullary cavity .
Eventually the pith underwent a complete absorption , thus enlarging the fistular interior until it became coextensive with the inner surface of the ligneous zone .
The Woody Zone.\#151 ; This commenced in very young states by the formation of a circle of canals stretching longitudinally from one node to the adjoining one .
Externally to , but in contact with , these canals a few barred or reticulated vessels were found ; successive additions to these were made in lines radiating from within outwards ; hence each wedge consisted of a series of radiating laminse , separated by medullary rays , having a peculiar mural structure .
At their commencement these wedges were separated by wide cellular areas , running continuously from node to node ;
