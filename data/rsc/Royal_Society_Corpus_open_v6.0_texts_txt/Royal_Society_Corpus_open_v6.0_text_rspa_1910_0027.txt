) In connection with a theory of the electricity of thunderstorms published in the ' Philosophical Transactions , '* measurements of the charges of rain were made in 1908 , and it appeared advisable that these should be continued for a second year .
1 .
The removal of the Simla Meteorological Office near the end of 1908 offered , a suitable site , and the hut containing the apparatus was accordingly dismantled and set up afresh in the grounds of the new building .
In all essentials the arrangement of the instruments remained as described in the previous paper , but it was found after the removal and readjustment of the instruments that the electrical capacity of the flain receiver had changed from 141 cm .
to 150 cm .
The rain gauge was also readjusted so that each tip of the bucket now corresponded to 0T1 mm. of rain instead of 0*14 , as before the alteration .
The apparatus for recording the potential gradient was modified so that it could be used during fine weather for registering the normal potential gradient .
This was effected by fixing a more powerful radium collector to the insulated rod passing out into the open .
The new site was found to be much less frequented by spiders than the old , so that practically no difficulty was experienced from discharging of the apparatus by their webs .
All the instruments worked satisfactorily throughout the rainy season and only a very few periods of rain were not successfully investigated .
2 .
The rainfall of the monsoon of 1908 was below the average , while that of 1909 was slightly above .
In Simla it is well known that poor monsoons are accompanied by an abnormal number of thunderstorms ; the rain during a good monsoon falls regularly and with only occasional breaks , while during a bad monsoon the periods of dry weather are longer and each ends with a thunderstorm .
This fact was borne out by the measurements made in 1908 and 1909 , for during the latter year the thunderstorms were neither so violent nor so frequent as during 1908 .
The total amount of rain which fell during the storms investigated from April 19 to September 12,1909 , was 95*8 cm .
The electrometer trace registered charged rain during 2212 two-minutes ' intervals , during 1599 of which the electrometer recorded positive electricity and during 613 negative electricity .
* Series A , vol. 209 , pp. 379\#151 ; 413 , 1909 .
On the Electricity of Rain and Snow .
The total quantity of positive electricity which fell on each square centimetre of surface was 21*7 electrostatic units and of negative electricity 6*2 units .
Comparing these figures with the corresponding ones of the previous year , it will be seen that while the rainfall increased from 76*3 cm .
to 95*8 cm .
the total charge decreased slightly .
3 .
Perhaps the most important result obtained in the previous year 's work was that more positive than negative electricity was brought down by the rain , the general impression up to that time having been that on the whole rain was negatively charged .
In 1908 2#9 times as much positive as negative electricity fell , and the time during which positive rain fell was 2*3 times longer than that during which negatively charged rain fell* ; the corresponding numbers for 1909 are 3*2 and 2*6 respectively , thus the previous result has been fully confirmed .
When charged rain is falling , the effect is equivalent to a vertical current of electricity ; with positively charged rain the current may be considered to be positive and with negatively charged rain to be negative .
Table I shows the frequency of occurrence of different current densities .

( 2 ) The larger the current density the more the positive currents preponderate .

In Table II will be found the values of all positive currents having a * N.B.\#151 ; In consequence of a clerical error the number of occurrences of positive and negative electricity were wrongly stated in the previous paper .
They should have been 1395 and 608 respectively instead of 1362 and 564 ; this gives a ratio of 2*3 instead of 2*4 .
The error is of no importance .

It is noteworthy that not a single negative current exceeding 300 x 10-15 ampere was recorded ; support is accordingly given to the impression , stated in the previous paper , that the storm of May 13 , 1908 , was entirely exceptional .

is a tendency for the preponderance of positive over negative electricity to decrease as the charge per cubic centimetre of water increases .
This result does not in any way contradict the second conclusion drawn from Table I ; for while large currents are generally caused by heavy rain , high charges per cubic centimetre generally occur during light rain ( see Table V ) .

In Table IV are given particulars of the two occasions on which charges exceeding 6 electrostatic units per cubic centimetre of water occurred .
This table is much smaller than Table IV in the previous paper , which contained 34 entries .

Perhaps the most interesting comparison is that between the rate of the rainfall and the charge which it carries .

In 1908 there was not a single case in which rain , falling at a greater rate than 1 mm. in two minutes , brought down a negative charge ; in 1909 there were 14 such occurrences .
Although the negative charges did not entirely cease with heavy rain in 1909 , yet the table shows Dr. G. C. Simpson .
[ Dec. 18 that their frequency relatively to the frequency of positively charged rain became very small .
The table , however , brings out a relationship which was not apparent in the previous work .
It will be noticed that very light rain is relatively highly charged , and that the charge per cubic centimetre for both kinds of electricity decreases as the rate of rainfall increases up to * 0*60 mm. in two minutes .
With greater rates , however , positively and negatively charged rain behave differently ; from 0*60 mm. in two minutes to the greatest rainfall rates measured the positive charge per cubic centimetre was practically the same , while with negatively , charged rain the charge continues to decrease as the rate increases .
When considering in the previous paper the origin of the electricity of thunderstorms , considerable stress was laid on the absence of negative charge in heavy rain .
These two new results do not affect materially the reasoning there used .
In the centre of the thunderstorm , where the violent ascending currents give rise to a large deposition of water and consequently to a large separation of electricity , there must be considerable rainfall from the upper clouds which , according to the theory , are highly charged with negative electricity .
The negative electricity brought down by this rain is , as a rule , far less than the positive charge on the rain from the head of the ascending current ; but that the negative charge might occasionally , even in the heaviest rain , exceed the positive charge , will be expected when the complicated process in action is considered .
The low negative charges per cubic centimetre of water in the heaviest rain indicate that the rain in these cases is probably a mixture of positively and negatively charged water , but that the negative electricity is in slight excess .
In order to investigate whether or not one sign of electricity preponderates in any one part of a storm , each period of rainfall was divided into four equal parts , and the number of times negative charge occurred in each was compared with the number of times positive charge occurred .
The data published in Table VI of the previous paper showed that there was no marked difference in 1908 , while the new data give an even smaller Table VI .

399 difference .
Another method of investigating the same effect is that of seeing whether the storms tended to begin or end with negative electricity .
This method was applied by counting the number of positive and negative signs of the electricity recorded in the first and last two-minutes ' intervals of each storm , and it was found that the ratio obtained was practically the same as that for the whole storm .
Thus there are no indications that negative electricity occurs more frequently during any particular period of a storm than during any other .
Turning now tq the question of the relationship between the sign of the potential gradient and the sign of the electricity of the rain , we find that , as last year , the data do not allow of any definite relationship being traced .
The data this year are considerably more numerous than they were previously , and from Table Y1I it will be seen that there is a very slight tendency for the charge upon the rain to be of the sign opposite to that of the potential gradient ; but the small relationship might quite well be accidental , and no definite statement ought to be based on it .

( 1 ) The electricity brought down by the rain was sometimes positive and sometimes negative ( Table A ) .
( 2 ) The total quantity of positive electricity brought down by the rain was 3*2 times greater than the total quantity of negative electricity ( Table A ) .
( 3 ) The period during which positively charged rain fell was 2*5 times longer than the period during which negatively charged rain fell ( Table A ) .
( 4 ) Treating charged rain as equivalent to a vertical current of electricity , the current densities were generally smaller than 4x 10"15 ampere per square centimetre ; but on a few occasions greater current densities , both positive and negative , were recorded ( Table B ) .
( 5 ) Negative currents occurred less frequently than positive currents , and the greater the current density the greater the preponderance of the positive currents ( Table B ) .
( 6 ) The charge carried by the rain was generally less than 6 electrostatic units per cubic centimetre of water , but larger charges were occasionally recorded , and in one exceptional storm ( May 13 , 1908 ) the negative charge exceeded 19 electrostatic units per cubic centimetre ( Table C ) .
( 7 ) As stated in ( 3 ) above , positive electricity was recorded more frequently than negative , but the excess was the less marked the higher the charge on the rain ( Table C ) .
( 8 ) With all rates of rainfall , -positively charged rain occurred more frequently than negatively charged rain , and the relative frequency of positively charged rain increased rapidly with increased rate of rainfall .
With rainfall of less than about 1 mm. in two minutes , positively charged rain occurred twice as often as negatively charged rain , while with greater intensities it occurred 14 times as often ( Table D ) .
402 Dr. G. C. Simpson .
[ Dec. 18 , ( 9 ) When the rain was falling at a less rate than about 0*6 mm. in two minutes , the charge per cubic centimetre of water decreased as the intensity of the rain increased ( Table D ) .
( 10 ) With rainfall of greater intensity than about 0*6 mm. in two minutes , the positive charge carried per cubic centimetre of water was independent of the rate of rainfall , while the negative charge carried decreased as the rate of rainfall increased ( Table D ) .
( 11 ) During periods of rainfall the potential gradient was more often negative than positive , but there were no clear indications of a relationship between the sign of the charge on the rain and the sign of the potential gradient ( Table E ) .
( 12 ) The data do not suggest that negative electricity occurs more frequently during any particular period of a storm than during any other .
Electricity of Snowfall .
During winter a certain amount of snow falls in Simla , and although the apparatus used in the work described above was not designed for measuring the electricity of snow , it was not impossible to make some qualitative measurements .
Owing to the snow remaining in the receiver , the rain-gauge did not record the quantity which fell ; therefore no continuous record was obtained of the quantity of snow corresponding to the charge recorded ; hence the charge per gramme of snow could not be determined .
Snow fell on nine days between December 23 , 1908 , and February 3 , 1909 .
On most of the days the snow was accompanied by thunder and lightning , and was generally mixed with a considerable amount of soft hail ( German , Graupel ) .
As in the case of rainfall , the quantity of positive charge exceeded the quantity of negative , and positive charges were brought down during longer periods than negative .

Although , for the reason stated above , it was impossible to determine continuously the charge per gramme of the snow , there were a few intervals during which the amount of the snowfall was obtained by melting the snow collected in the receiver .
Adding the total charge received , irrespective of sign , and dividing by the total snowfall , the following mean charges per gramme result .

Long-Period Determination of the Rate of Production of Helium from Radium .
By Sir James Dewar , M.A. , Sc. D. , LL. D. , F.R.S. ( Received January 10 , \#151 ; Read January 27 , 1910 .
) In a previous communication* the rate of the production of helium from 70 milligrammes of radium chloride was determined by a succession of observations on the growth of pressure measured by a McLeod gauge .
These observations extended over a period of about six weeks .
It was thought desirable to make an experiment to determine the amount of helium resulting from this same sample of radium , after standing in a sealed bulb for an extended period .
For this purpose the bulb containing the radium chloride was sealed off at the conclusion of the above-mentioned experiment of 1908 and kept for nine months .
In order to measure the helium thus produced it was necessary to devise a vacuum-tight joint between the sealed radium bulb and a McLeod gauge so constructed that , after thoroughly exhausting the gauge , the drawn-out end of the radium bulb could be broken off , thus allowing the pressure of the accumulated helium in the radium bulb to be rapidly determined .
Such a joint is shown in fig. 1 .
A is the small bottle containing the radium chloride resting in the cylindrical bulb B with long tubular neck drawn out to a capillary , and sealed off at C at the conclusion of the first experiment .
This tubular neck slides with slight clearance into the drawn-out neck of another cylindrical bulb D of stout glass , and is attached to it by a short , stout , india-rubber connection protected by a glass mercury cup M , previously fixed as shown on the neck of the radium bulb .
This drawn-out neck is so shaped that the radium bulb can be readily rocked in a vertical plane about the neck as pivot within the limits of the diameter of D when so connected .
