472 The Presence in the Solar Spectrum of the Water-vapour Band X 3064 .
By A. Fowler , F.R.S. ( Received December 15 , 1917 .
) The recent discovery of the ammonia band X 3360 in the solar spectrum* suggested that additional solar lines might be identified by a search for other bands which are produced under generally similar conditions in laboratory experiments .
In the first instance , comparison has been made with the water-vapour band X 3064 , which accompanies the ammonia band in the ammonia flame and in the arc in ammonia .
This band was discovered by Living and Dewarf in 1880 , and independently , about the same time , by Huggins .
J It was found by Living and Dewar that the band appeared in the flame of hydrogen or of hydrocarbons , and less strongly in the flames of non-hydrogenous gases , such as carbonic oxide and cyanogen , if burnt in moist air ; it occurred also in the uncondensed discharge through moist hydrogen or other gases , but disappeared when the gas and apparatus were thoroughly dried , or when a large coil , with condenser , was the source of discharge .
It was accordingly concluded by Living and Dewar that the spectrum in question was that of water-vapour , but they were careful to explain that in writing of this and other spectra which had been traced to compounds , they abstained from speculating upon " the particular molecular condition or stage of combination or decomposition which may give rise to such spectra .
" Subsequent work has likewise indicated that both hydrogen and oxygen are essential to the development of the spectrum under consideration , but the precise nature of the combination involved cannot yet be deduced from the spectroscopic evidence .
The band X 3064 was afterwards found by Living and Dewar to be associated with others of lower intensity , extending as far as X 4100 towards the red , and to X 2268 in the ultra-violet .
Extensive measures of the lines composing these bands were made by the same observers .
S The chief band was measured more completely by Meyerlieim|| in 1904 , * * * S * Communicated to the Royal Society on December 15 , 1917 , by A. Fowler and C. C. L. Gregory .

The Water-vapour Band X 3064 the Solar Spectrum .
473 and by Grebe and Holtz* in 1912 .
The latter series of wave-lengths have been found to be sufficiently accurate for effective comparison with the solar tables of Howland .
The wave-lengths are given on the International scale , and the lines are classified in three orders of intensity , 3 indicating the brightest , and 1 the weakest lines .
The head of the band is marked by a pair of lines at 3063-547 ( 2 ) and 3063-713(3 ) , from which point the measured lines extend on the red side to 3291-687 ( 1 ) .
Strong lines persist to a considerable distance from the head , but in the less refrangible part of the band , the lines become generally weak and relatively far apart .
The result of the comparison is to prove that the band 3064 is quite strongly represented in the solar spectrum , and accounts for a large number of lines which were previously unidentified .
It will suffice for the present purpose to give details relating to the brighter lines of the band , as in the appended Table .
To facilitate comparison with the solar lines , the wavelengths given by Grebe and Holtz have been reduced to Rowland 's scale by the addition of the following corrections , derived from the curve given by Kayserf:\#151 ; Range of wave-lengths .

In Grebe and Holtz ' list there are 53 lines which are classed as of intensity 3 , but three of them are comparatively faint in my own photographs , and have therefore been omitted .
As the scale of intensities adopted by Grebe and Holtz appears to be unduly restricted , my own estimates , on the basis of 6 for the strongest lines , are given in the second column of the Table .
The following three columns show the wave-lengths , intensities , and origins of solar lines , as tabulated by Rowland .
The sixth column indicates the difference " sun minus water-vapour , " except in the case of near coincidences with metallic lines .
The last column indicates the distances of the solar lines which are nearest to those which correspond to water-vapour .

# Some other substance probably also involved .
Of the 50 lines included in the Table , it will be seen that , while 12 are obscured in the sun by closely adjacent metallic lines , the remaining lines show a very close agreement in wave-length with solar lines , and a Spectrum of the Water-vapour Band X 3064 .
475 sufficiently consistent correspondence of intensities .
The average deviation of the 38 water-vapour lines from the corresponding solar lines , taken without regard to sign , is , in fact , only 0-007 while the range is from -f 0-019 to \#151 ; 0-009 .
The differences are not too great to be considered as arising from errors in the two sets of measurements and uncertainty as to the corrections from the international to the Rowland scale .
Moreover , the deviations are clearly to some extent systematic , as indicated by the preponderance of positive signs .
From the last column of the Table , it results that the average distance of the next nearest solar lines is 0-111 A. , and there is consequently no reason to suppose that the coincidences are accidental .
The total number of lines in Grebe and Holtz ' list is 257 ; 63 of them are approximately coincident with , and therefore obscured by , lines in the sun which are of metallic , or probable metallic , origins , according to Rowland .
Five , which cannot be traced in the sun , although not masked by metallic lines , are too faint to appear in my own photographs or in Meyerheim 's list , so that their apparent absence is of no significance .
With very few exceptions , which require further investigation , all the remaining lines are closely coincident with solar lines , but it is possible that several of them are slightly too strong in the sun to be attributed solely to water-vapour , notwithstanding the close agreement in wave-lengths .
At least 150 of the solar lines in the region of the X , 3064 band , however , may confidently be assigned exclusively to water-vapour .
It is further probable that many additional solar lines will be traced to water-vapour when sufficiently accurate measures of the other bands become available for comparison .
Besides accounting for a large number of previously unidentified solar lines , the identification of the water-vapour band in the solar spectrum is of interest as furnishing further evidence of the existence of oxygen in the sun .
