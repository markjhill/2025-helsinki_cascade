A paper was also read , entitled , " Observations on the Reciprocal Influence which Magnetic Needles exercise over each other , when placed at a given distance within their respective Spheres of Action , at different positions on the Earth ; with Tables of numerical"Re ?
sults obtained at separate Stations .
Also a method of discovering where certain local influences are acting on the Needle , from which may be obtained a proportional correction to be applied to Magnetic Observations in general .
" By Edward J. Johnson , Esq. , Commander R.N. Communicated by Francis Beaufort , Esq. , Capt. R.N. , F.R.S. The author , considering it probable that two or more magnetic needles freely suspended at a certain distance in given positions with respect to each other , would develope certain proportionate deflections determined by their position on the earth , made a set of experiments , with a few common compass needles , at Yarmouth , Lon ?
don , and Clifton , which so far confirmed the truth of his conjecture , as to induce him to fix on stations at a greater distance from one another , and to multiply his observations ; ascertaining , from time to time , that the magnetic powers of his apparatus had undergone no material change .
The results of these observations are given in a tabular form .
The author conceives that comparative observations of the amount of deflection produced by one magnet on another , placed in various situations , relative to the meridian , on an horizontal plane , will afford the means of determining the peculiar local influences of the particu ?
lar situation in which the experiment is made , as distinguished from the general magnetic influence ; because the former will act unequally on each magnet , while the latter acts equaiiy on all .
