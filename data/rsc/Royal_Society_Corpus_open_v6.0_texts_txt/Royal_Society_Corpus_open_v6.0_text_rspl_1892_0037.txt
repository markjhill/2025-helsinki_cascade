495 emission suddenly set up , certainly within two days and possibly within a few hours , was probably much greater than that of our Sun ; yet within some fifty days after it had been discovered , at the end of January , its light fell to about 1/ 300th part , and in some three months to nearly the 1/ 10,000th part .
As long as its spectrum could be observed the chief lines remained without material alteration of relative brightness .
Under what conditions could we suppose the Sun to cool down sufficiently for its light to decrease to a similar extent in so short a time , and without the incoming of material changes in its spectrum ?
It is scarcely conceivabJe that we can have to do with the conversion of gravitational energy into light and heat .
On the theory we have ventured to suggest , the rapid calming down , after some swayings to and fro of the tidal disturbances , and the closing in again of the outer and cooler gases , together with the want of transparency which might come in under such circumstances , as the bodies separated , might account reasonably for the very rapid and at first curiously fluctuating waning of the Nova ; and also for the observed absence of change in its spectrum .
I may , perhaps , be permitted to remark that the view suggested by Dr. William Allen Miller and myself , in the case of the Nova of 1866 , * was essentially similar , in so far as we ascribed it to erupted gases .
The great suddenness of the outburst of that star , within a few hours probably , and the rapid waning from the 3*6 magnitude to the 8*1 magnitude in nine days , induced us to throw out the additional suggestion that possibly chemical actions between the erupted gases and the outer atmosphere of the star may have contributed to its sudden and transient splendour ; a view which , though not impossible , I should not now , with our present knowledge of the light-changes of stars , be disposed to suggest .

" On the Changes produced , by Magnetisation in the Length of Iron and other Wires carrying Currents .
By SHELFORD Bidwell , M.A. , LL. B. , F.R.S. Received April 28 , 1892 .
The changes of length attending the magnetisation of rods or wires of iron and other magnetic metals which were first noticed by Joulet in 1841 , and have in recent years formed the subject of oiany experiments by myself , J have been found to be related to several other phenomena of magnetism .

Changes produced hy [ May 19 , that they sufficiently account for the twist which is produced in an iron wire when magnetised circularly and longitudinally at the same time .
The resultant lines of magnetisation , as he points out , take a spiral form ; the iron expands in the direction of the lines of mag-netisation , and thus the wire becomes twisted .
Professor G. Wiedemann , however , to whom the discovery of the magnetic twist is due , appears not to be satisfied with this explanation , * believing the effect to be caused by unequal molecular friction .
The subject of magnetic twists has been very fully and carefully investigated by Professor 0 .
G. Knott , and in a paper published last year in the 'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ' ( vol. 36 , Part II , p. 485 ) he indicates many details in which the phenomena of twist closely correspond with those of elongation and retraction .
Assuming their essential identity , and noting that " an increased current along the wire affects the points of vanishing twist in a manner opposite to that in which an increased tension affects it , " Professor Knott is " inclined to conclude that the pure strain effects of these influences are of an opposite character .
" Now , since the magnetic elongation of an iron wire is known to be diminished hy tension , the remark above quoted amounts to a prediction that in an iron wire carrying a current the magnetic elongation would be increased .
" We know nothing so far , " Professor Knott observes , " regarding the changes of length when an iron wire carrying a current is subjected to longitudinal magnetising forces , " and it was with the object of acquiring some information on this point and testing Professor Knott 's prediction that the experiments described in the present paper were undertaken .
The results show that it was amply verified , and thus Maxwell 's explanation of the twist receives still further corroboration .
The apparatus used and the methods of observation were the same as those described in my former papers .
Each specimen of wire examined was 10 cm .
long between the supporting clamps , and the magnetising coil , weighing nearly 3 lbs. , was as usual supported by the wire itself , an arrangement which , for reasons before given , was essential .
The indications of the instrument were read to one ten-millionth part of the length of the wire , and the wire was demagnetised by reversals before each single observation .

1.\#151 ; The wire first used was of soft commercial annealed iron , O'75 mm. in diameter .
The changes of length which it exhibited under the influence of magnetising forces gradually increased from 13 to 315 C.G.S. units , are indicated in the second column of Table I\gt ; in which the unit is one-millionth of a centimetre or one ten-millionth of the effective length of the wire .

of the demagnetising effect of the wire .
The results are also plotted as a curve in fig. 1 .
It will be seen that the maximum increment of length , attained in a field of about 40 , was 11 5 ten-millionths ; the decrement of length in a field of 315'was 22*5 , while the original length of the wire was unchanged in a field of 130 .

2.\#151 ; A current of 1 ampere was then passed through the wire .
The current , which was derived from a Grove 's cell , was measured by a tangent galvanometer and regulated by a rheostat , which had been approximately adjusted on the previous day .
As soon as the circuit was closed , the index of the measuring instrument began to move , rapidly at first and afterwards more slowly , in the direction indicating elongation of the iron wire .
In about two minutes the index had come to rest again , the number of scale divisions over which it had passed showing that the original length of the wire had increased by 310 ten-millionths .
Assuming the coefficient of expansion of the iron to be 122 ten-millionths per degree Centigrade this elongation denoted a rise of temperature ( due to current heating ) of about 2''5 .
The experiment described in the last paragraph was then repeated , the several magnetising forces employed being made as nearly as possible the same as before by inserting the same resistances successively in the circuit.* The results appear in the third Independent readings of the ampfcre meter were taken in the two experiments , and the readings corresponding to the same resistance in both series all agreed 498 Mr. S. Bidwell .
Changes produced by [ May 19 , column of Table I and in the middle curve of fig. 1 .
The latter shows clearly that the maximum elongation had risen from 11*5 to I4.5 ten-millionths , while the decrement in a field of 315 had fallen from 22*5 to about 17*5 .
^ Exp , 3.__The current through the iron wire was then increased , by an alteration of the rheostat , to 2 amperes .
The further elongation of the wire due to the heating effect of the increased current was very nearly 1000 ten-millionths , corresponding to a rise of temperature of 8'-2 0 .
This added to 2*5 , the rise due to the current of 1 ampere , which was passing before , gives 10'*7 as the excess of the temperature of the wire carrying 2 amperes above that of the room .
When the index had become steady , which happened in the course of about 2| minutes , another series of observations was made ; but instead of applying all the previously employed magnetising forces in succession , alternate ones were omitted .
This was done for the purpose of shortening the experiment , it being thought doubtful whether the Grove 's cell which supplied current to the iron wire would remain sufficiently constant when giving so strong a current as 2 amperes .
The results of the experiment are contained in the last column of Table I , and in the highest of the curves in fig. 1 .
There is again a marked increase of the maximum elongation , and decrease of the retraction in a field of 315 .
For the sake of easy comparison , the principal results obtained with this wire are collected in Table II .

When two successive readings with the same resistance in circuit differed by no more than a quarter of a scale division ( equivalent to 3*125 units of magnetising force ) , the mean of the two readings was taken as giving the true current .

The former observations were again made with the results given in the last column of Table III and in fig. 2 .
It will be seen that with both specimens of iron wire , the effect of a current is of just the same general character .
It acts oppositely to tension , heightening the curve of elongation instead of lowering it .
This action is certainly not due either directly or indirectly to mere current heating .
It has been shown that the thinner wire ever when carrying 2 amperes was only about 10o,7 warmer than when no current was passing through it .
Such a small rise of temperature would be quite incompetent by itself to account for the effect in question , for the elongation curves of a given specimen of iron have been found to be not sensibly altered when taken under widely different conditions of temperature .
Nor would it exert any material influence upon the susceptibility of the iron ; and , even if it did , the curves would not be affected in the manner observed .
It is hardly worth while attempting to frame an explanation until many more phenomena of the same order have been investigated .
Similar experiments were afterwards made with nickel and cobalt .

Taking the coefficient of expansion as 0*0000129 , this implies a rise of temperature of 2'*6 .
The retractions of the wire when carrying a current are given in the third column of the table .
Remembering that the figures in the second and third columns denote millionths of a centimetre , the close agreement between the two is very remarkable .
I have elsewhere* fully described the method of observation adopted , but I may perhaps mention that each number as set down in the table was obtained by the subtraction of two readings , the one taken when there was no current in the magnetising coil , the other when the current was turned on .
The former or zero reading was continually changing , owing to small alterations of temperature , the index rarely being absolutely at rest .
All the figures were dictated , and when the second experiment was made , I had not seen the results of the first .
I may add that the table contains all the observations which were taken in the two experiments .
Though at first inclined to attribute such small discrepancies as exist entirely to observational or instrumental errors and to infer that the current had no influence whatever upon the contraction , I think it appears pretty clearly from a careful inspection of the differences tabulated in the fourth column that this is not actually the case .
Four pairs of observations agree exactly ; once only the retraction with the * ' Phil. Trans./ vol. 179 , A , p. 218 .

current seems to be greater than without it , while in the ten remaining pairs the retraction is slightly greater without the current than with it .
It may , perhaps , be fairly concluded that the current has a real but very small effect in diminishing the retraction .
Now I have before remarked that the degree of retraction which nickel undergoes when magnetised is materially affected by comparatively small changes of temperature : the retraction of the same specimen has been found to be greater in a cold room than in a warm one , at least in fields up to 400 or 500 .
Probably this is to be explained by the influence of heat in diminishing the magnetic susceptibility of nickel , the retractions being really the same for the same intensity of magnetisation .
Such small effect as appears to be produced by the action of the current may , therefore , be accounted for simply by the rise of temperature ( 2'*6 ) which it causes .
Tension has a large effect upon the magnetic retraction of nickel :* it is , therefore , the more remarkable that the action of a current , which operates so markedly upon iron , should in nickel be practically insensible .

503 tabulated in the fourth column , it appears that the effect of the current is to increase the retraction very slightly .
According to Rowland the susceptibility of cohalt is increased by heating .
The small additional retraction indicated when the current was passing was , therefore , no doubt due to the increased susceptibility consequent upon current heating .
It may be noted that tension seems to have no material effect upon the magnetic retraction of cobalt.* Summary .
In an iron wire carrying a current , the maximum magnetic elongation is greater , and the retraction in strong fields is less , than when no current is passing .
The effect of the current is opposite to that of tension .
The magnetic retractions of nickel and of cobalt are not sensibly affected by the passage of a current through the metals .
( Tension considerably modifies the magnetic retraction of nickel , but not that of cobalt .

( Abstract .
) This paper gives the method of experiment and results obtained in some investigations on the time-rate of rise of current in a circuit having large electromagnetic inertia .
The experiments were made on a circuit containing the coils of a large electromagnet having laminated cores and pole pieces .
The mean length of the iron circuit was about 250 cm .
and its cross section 320 sq .
cm .
The magnetising coil had 3840 turns , when all joined in series , and a resistance of 10'4 ohms .
The coils were so arranged that they could be joined in a variety of ways so as to vary the resistance , inductive coefficient , \amp ; c. , and also to allow the magnet to be used either as an open or a closed circuit transformer .
The electromotive force used in the experiments was obtained from a storage battery , and the method of experiment was to trace the curve , giving the relation of current to time , on a chronograph sheet .
One set of experiments shows the effect of varying the impressed E.M.F. on the time required for the current to attain any given percentage of its maximum strength .
The results show that for any * particular percentage there is always a particular E.M.P. which takes * Loc .
