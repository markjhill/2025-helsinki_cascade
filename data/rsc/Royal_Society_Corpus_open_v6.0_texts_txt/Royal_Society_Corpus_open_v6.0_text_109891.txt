] The object of this paper is to communicate a series of observations made with a new instrument for the purpose of investigating the question of parallax .
Though a much longer period of time will be necessary to elucidate this subject in a perfectly satisfactory manner , yet , from the observations already made , it seems highly probable that the parallax of a Cygni is too small a quantity to have had any share in producing either the discordances remarked by Dr. Brinkley , or those in the Greenwich observations already communicated to the Society .
The method consists in continually observing the meridional difference in polar distance of a Cygni and P Aurigae , ( which pass through the field of the same telescope , ) by means of a micrometer adapted to this purpose .
A drawing of the instrument accompanies the observations .
