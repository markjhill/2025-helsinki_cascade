( Abstract .
) Those who have occupied themselves with the determiniation of refractive indices , must have noticed that changes of temperature influence the amount of refraction ; yet few of the observations on record have affixed to them the temperature at which they were made , and few , if any , numerical researches have been published on the subject .
To determine , if possible , the amount and character of this effect of heat was the object of the present inquiry .
The instrument employed was that described by the Rev. Baden Powell in the British Association Report for 1839 , and was kindly lent by him for the purpose .
The substances more or less fully examined , were bisulphide of carbon , water , ether , methylic , vinic , arnylic , and caprylic alcohols , the two principal constituents of creasote-hydrate of phenyle and hydrate of cresyle , phosphorus , oil cassia , and camphor dissolved in alcohol .
Of the tabulated results the following two will suffice to illustrate the main conclusions : Bisulphide of Carbon .

In every substance the refractive index diminishes as the temperature increases .
This is seen in the first four columns of the tabulated results , which represent the refractive indices of the fixed lines of the spectrum A , D , and H respectively at the temperatures indicated , while the succeeding column shows the amount of difference for each five degrees Centigrade .
This change of refractive index by heat , for which the term sensitiveness is proposed , varies greatly in amount in different substances , melted phosphorus and bisulphide of carbon being the most , and water the least sensitive of the liquids examined .
2 .
The length of the spectrum varies as the temperature increases .
The difference between the refractive indices of the lines A and H , or pu --A , is taken as the measurable length of the spectrum , and is given in the sixth column .
In the case of highly dispersive substances , as bisulphide of carbon and hydrate of phenyle , it decreases considerably ; in the case of less dispersive bodies , as the alcohols , it decreases to a less extent ; while with water the change is not appreciable .
3 .
In some substances the dispersive power is diminished , in others it is augmented by a rise of temperature ; that is , in such substances as bisulphide of carbon , it is the numerator of the fraction FIA^ that decreases fastest , while in such substances as water it is !
D1 the denominator .
The result of this is shown in the last column .
4 .
The sensitiveness of a substance is independent of its specific refractive or dispersive power .
Thus water and ether are very similar as to the actual amount of the refraction and dispersion exhibited by them , but ether is many times more sensitive to heat than water is .
5 .
The amount of sensitiveness is not directly proportional to the change of density produced by alterations of temperature ; yet there is some relationship between the two phenomena .
Thus in water the index of refraction and the density both change much more rapidly at high than at low temperatures ; again , the remarkable reversion of the increase of density that takes place at 4 ?
C. is not without its indication in the amount of sensitiveness ; and the large decrease of density at the freezing of water is accompanied by a similar decrease of refraction .

6 .
No sudden change of sensitiveness occurs near the boilingpoint ; at least this is true in respect to bisulphide of carbon , ether , and methylic alcohol .
