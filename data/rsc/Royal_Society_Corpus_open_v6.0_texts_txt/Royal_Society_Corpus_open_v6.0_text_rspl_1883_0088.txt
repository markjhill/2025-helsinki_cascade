Barometrical Disturbances .
143 exhibits considerable similarity to that of the King 's barograph at the Liverpool Observatory , at the Waterloo Docks Pierhead on the 15th of January , 1864 , when the " Lottie Sleigh , " loaded with about twelve tons of gunpowder , blew up .
The ship was lying about three miles from the Observatory .
I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Hartnup for a tracing of this interesting curve .
In this preliminary note I can only say that until copies of the barograms from extra-European stations , such as New Zealand , the Havana , and Calcutta , are received , it is impossible to see whether the phenomena so marked in their occurrence in Europe have manifested themselves elsewhere ; at Toronto they appear to have been recorded .
On that subject I shall hope to lay a future communication before the Society .

Note on the foregoing Paper .
By Lieutenant-General R. Strachey , F.R.S. Received December 12 , 1883 .
The obvious correspondence of the forms and times of occurrence of the barometric disturbances , described in Mr. Scott 's paper , at once suggested that they were due to a common origin , and the great volcanic eruption at Krakatoa in the Straits of Sunda appeared to supply a probable efficient cause .
Any shock of sufficient violence might be expected to produce an atmospheric wave , advancing from the place where it was caused in a circular form round the globe , at first expanding until it had got half round the earth , and then again contracting till it was again concentrated at the antipodes , from which again it would be thrown , back , and so pass backwards and forwards till it was obliterated .
It might also have been expected that such a wave would travel with the velocity of sound , being probably of the same nature as that which causes sound , though the vibrations had not the peculiar character that affects our organs of hearing .
It ha\#174 ; , however , been suggested to me that the wave may rather have had the character of a solitary wave produced in a liquid , the velocity of which in the air would not materially differ from that of sound .
A rough examination of the facts at first made known by the observations recorded in Great Britain indicated that 4here was j strong evidence in support of this view , and that the phenomena would be approximately .explained by the passage round the earth of a series of waves travelling at the rate of about 700 miles an hour in opposite directions from the place where the volcanic eruption occurred .
The records since procured from other places , and the more careful examination of the facts , has quite confirmed this conclusion .
Although we may expect to obtain additional data from other parts 144 Lieut.-Gen .

The first and second of the series are , in almost all the curves , well defined and generally similar in form , commencing with a distinct rise , which is again followed by a distinct fall , the fall being shorter than the rise .
These features are followed by a less definite rise succeeded by a shallow fall , after which there is again a rise , which gradually passes into the more regular trace .
The third and fourth of the disturbances can be traced in all the curves , but they no longer exhibit the same characters , and are usually nothing more than a sudden sharply defined i*ise , though in front of some of these there is a more or less distinct trace of a hollow .
The fifth and sixth of the series become less distinct and are lost at several stations , being usually rises ; while a seventh faint dis1883 .

145 turbance , as a shallow hollow , can be traced in a few of the curves , after which nothing can be distinguished .
By a comparison of the time intervals between the first and third , the third and fifth , and the fifth and seventh disturbances , and ^assuming ( which the facts seem to justify ) that the velocity of the ; wave has remained unchanged in its passage from east to west , it I -would appear that the first well-defined rise in the first of the series I corresponds to the rises which are prominent in those succeeding it .
And the same conclusion has been drawn from an examination of the second and fourth compared with the fourth and sixth of the | series .
Adopting these conclusions , the times of the successive passages of the initial rise have been measured from the curves , suitable allowance having been made where the rise was difficult to trace , or as sometimes happened , a hollow appeared corresponding in position with the hollows in the earlier form of the disturbances .
There is , of course , some doubt attaching to these measurements , but their general consistency seems to indicate that they may be accepted as fairly representing the facts under discussion .
The following table gives the results of these estimates of the times at which the successive waves passed the several stations , reckoned from midnight of the 26th August , in Greenwich mean time .

From the results thus obtained it would follow that the wave travelled round the earth from east to west in 36 h. m. , being at the rate of '1026 hour for one degree of a great circle of the earth , and from west to east in 35 h. 17 m. , being at the rate of *098 hour for one degree .
From the velocities thus determined the probable time of the origin of the wave has been calculated from the known distance of each place from Krakatoa , the time occupied in the passage of the wave from Krakatoa to the place of observation , and the observed time of the passage of the waves .
The mean value thus obtained from the waves moving from east to west for the time of the origin of the disturbance at Krakatoa is 2*52 h. Greenwich mean time , or 9*53 h. local time , that is 9 h. 32 m. a.m. of the 27th August .
In like manner the waves travelling from west to east will give the following results ( Table Y ) :\#151 ; The mean value of the time of the origin of the disturbance obtained from the waves moving from west to east is therefore 2*20 h. Greenwich mean time , or 9*21 h. local time , that is 9 h. 13 m. local time .

] On a Series of Barometrical Disturbances .
The mean between the two values obtained from the waves travelling against the earth 's motion of revolution and those travelling with it is 2 h. 24 m. Greenwich mean time , or 9 h. 24 m. local time , \j 27th August .
The velocity of the waves in miles will be for those which travel from east to west 674 miles per hour , and for those passing from west to east 706 miles per hour .
The velocity of sound is for a temperature of 50 ' F. 757 miles an hour , and for 80 ' F. 781 miles an hour .
With a temperature as low as zero F. the velocity will only be reduced to 723 miles an hour , which is still considerably in excess of the greater of the observed velocities .
The excess of the velocity of the waves '"i which travelled in the same direction as the earth 's motion of i*evo-lution , that is , from west to east , over that of those which passed in the opposite direction , is about 32 miles an hour , which might be accounted for by the circumstance that the winds along the paths of the waves would , on the whole , be from the west , which would cause an increase in the velocity of the one set , and a diminution in that of the other , so that the observed difference of 32 miles would correspond to an average westerly wind of 16 miles an hour , which is not improbable .
It should be observed that the path of the wave which passed Toronto approached very near to the North and South Poles , and that the velocity in both directions appears to be somewhat less than in the waves which passed over central Europe .
The wave which passed northwards over Asia travelled at the rate of about 660 miles an hour , or about 15 miles an hour slower than the wave which passed over Great Britain from east to west .
This reduction of velocity seems to be within the limits of what might be due to the low temperature of the regions .
The wave travelling from east to west having been perceptible on the barometer traces at several of the stations until about 122 hours after its origin , and its velocity having been 674 miles an hour , it had travelled before its extinction more than 82,200 miles , and had passed 3\#163 ; times round the entire circuit of the earth .
It is further worthy of notice that during the 30th and 31st of August and 1st September , a very severe cyclonic storm was crossing the North Atlantic , and that the wave coming from the westward early on the 31st , No. YI of the series , must have passed on in front of the cyclone , and that its next transit would have carried it into the very centre of the cyclone near the British Isles on the afternoon of the 1st September .
This perhaps accounts for no trace of it being found , though the wave coming from the eastward on the morning of that day , just before the cyclone had arrived , No. VII , was discernible .
There is no definite statement , so far as I am informed at present , of the true time of any particularly severe shock or explosion at 150 On a Series of Barometrical Disturbances .
[ Dec. 13 Krakatoa excepting that which is contained in the letter of Mr Watson ( published in " Mature , " Gth December , 1883 ) , whose ship was within a few miles of the volcano on the morning of the 27th August .
He refers to an unusually severe explosion as having occurred at 11 h. 15 m. a.m. local time , which is nearly 45 minutes later than the time , 9 h. 32 m. , arrived at in the foregoing discus-sion .
The point of the disturbance ( as indicated by the baro-grams ) which has been taken as the front of the wave is the highest point of the first abrupt rise of the trace , and is perhaps on an average not far from one hour after the first signs of disturbance , the increase of pressure having been very rapid during the interval , hut broken into two or three steps or oscillations .
During the following half-hour there is nsually a large decrease of pressure , succeeded by another abrupt rise lasting about half an hour .
Then follow a fall of about an hour , then a rise of an hour and a half , and then a fall of an hour and a quarter .
The whole length of the disturbance on the time scale is between five and six hours , corresponding to an actual distance of between 3500 miles and 4000 miles .
The length of the first main wave of the disturbance is about one hour on the time scale or about 700 miles in length over the earth 's surface .
In the present position of our knowledge of the facts , it can only be surmised that the shock of 11 h. 15 m. a.m. of the 27th August observed by Mr. Watson corresponds to the second main feature of the disturbance .
That the wave which forms the first feature would have originated at 11 h. 15 m. A.M. is apparently inconsistent with the observed velocities , , which it has been showmare remarkably consistent , and indicate without much doubt an origin at 9 h. 32 m. A.M. The barometric disturbance at Mauritius noted by Dr. Meldrum is said to have begun soon after 11 a.m. local time .
The distance from the volcano to Mauritius being about 3450 miles , the wave at the rate of 674 miles per hour would have reached the island in 5h .
7 m. Taking the great shock at 2h .
32 m. Greenwich mean time , as before reckoned , the wave would reach Mauritius at 7 h. .
39 m. Greenwich mean time , or adding the allowance for difference of longitude , 3h .
50 m. , the local time would be 11 h. 29 m. , which agrees satisfactorily with the facts as recorded .
In conclusion , it may be noticed that the sea-waves produced by this volcanic disturbance , assuming the time of its occurrence to have been 2h .
32 m. Greenwich mean time of the 27th August , were propagated with an approximate velocity of 480 miles an hour to Mauritius , of 430 miles an hour to Port Elizabeth near the Cape of Good Hope , and 420 miles to Galle , and a somewhat slower rate to Aden .
The details of the occurrence of these waves on the coasts of India will shortly be laid before the Society by Major Baird , who has informed 1883 .

Striking Distance .
In a postscript to Part IV of our researches , * we stated that , with 114,400 cells , partly of the rod form , partly of the chloride-in-pow der c form , the length of the spark between paraboloidal points was 0'7 inch ( 17-8 millims. ) , and between a point and disk 0*62 inch ( 15*7 millims. ) , r and that it does not appear , therefore , that the law of the spark being as the square of the number of cells holds good beyond a certain number .
These results were obtained at the Royal Institution ; since the removal of the battery to our laboratory we had not , at the date of the postscript to Part IV of our researches , charged up the whole of it .
Recently , however , we have put the battery in thorough order , by scraping the zinc rodsf of the cells already charged up and added newly made up cells to bring up the total to 15,000 cells , all of the rod form . .
Having the whole 15,000 cells in .perfect order , we thought that it * would be desirable to make fresh determinations of the striking distance , increasing the potential a thousand cells at a time , between two very slightly convex disks ( planes ) , a point and disk , and two paraboloidal points .
These points are one-eighth of an inch ( 3*175 millims. ) 5 m diameter , and three-eighths of an inch ( 9*525 millims. ) long .
