Whilst doing so I paid attention to the occurrence or non-occurrence of effects other than those with which I was at the time most concerned .
Since the resuffs were in many cases not in accordance with the statements of earlier observers , it seemed to me desirable to determine as many as possible of the " sympathetic " effects , which can be produced by stimulation of each of the lower cervical and of the upper thoracic nerves .
In giving the results of my experiments it will be convenient to take separately , and in order , the origin of ( 1 ) the fibres causing dilation of the pupil , opening of the eyelids , and retraction of the nictitating membrane ; ( 2 ) the vaso-constrictor and vaso-dilator fibres of the head ; ( 3 ) the secretory fibres of the salivary glands ; ( 4 ) the accelerator fibres of the heart ; and ( 5 ) , and more briefly , the remaining efferent fibres of the sympathetic region in question .
Having dealt with the origin of the various classes of nerve fibres , I shall consider some points with regard to white and grey rami com-municantes , points which naturally arise out of Gaskell 's work on visceral nerves .
The experiments were made upon Dogs , Cats , and Rabbits , most experiments being made on Cats and fewest on Dogs .
In all cases anaesthetics were used ; with Dogs , morphia was first injected subcutaneously , and later a mixture of equal parts of absolute alcohol , chloroform , and ether ( = a.c.e. mixture ) was given at intervals by inhalation ; with Cats , chloroform was first given , then the a.c.e. mixture , usually in addition about 2 c.c. of 2 p.c. morphia acetate were injected sub-cutaneously ; with Rabbits , half to one grain of chloral hydrate was given per rectum , and later the a.c.e. mixture was inhaled .
When the animal was thoroughly under the influence of the anaesthetics , the spinal cord was laid bare for a varying distance ; as a rule , twx\gt ; or three nerves were first exposed and stimulated , and then progressively the nerves above and below these were exposed and stimulated .
The procedure adopted before stimulating the spinal nerve was varied in different experiments ; sometimes the nerves just outside the dura matter were tied and cut , and small pieces of sponge were stuffed between the spinal cord and the bone on either side of the cut nerve ; occasionally , in addition , the cord was cut at the highest level exposed ; sometimes the nerves were tied outside the dura matter , and the spinal cord with its dura matter removed ; or the cord was cut into segments corresponding to each spinal nerve ; or , lastly the dura matter was opened , the spinal cord removed , and the nerves stimulated outside the dura matter .
THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
I have not observed any constant difference in result to accompany the different methods of procedure , but possibly it is better not to cut the cord when vascular changes are to be observed .
Previous observers do not , as far as I know , mention any difficulty in the exposure of the 1st .
thoracic nerve in Rabbits .
In my experiments death followed soon , or at once , on cutting through the arches of the last cervical and first two thoracic vertebrae ; the large branches of the intervertebral veins which are thus severed , allow air to pass to the heart and the heart stops beating .
In one Dog , death was similarly caused .
Death , however , does not prevent the effect of the spinal nerves being tested ; for , as Budge found , the action of these nerves continues for fifteen to thirty minutes after death ; but I think that negative results obtained more than five minutes after death are open to suspicion .
Death can be avoided by ligaturing the intervertebral veins in the chest , before opening the spinal canal .
I have not found a lethal effect to follow section of the vertebral arches below the 2nd thoracic vertebra , except in one case ; in this , the arches of five of the mid-thoracic vertebrae were cut through in rapid succession with the result that the heart stopped almost instantaneously .
In stimulating the nerves , a du Bois-Reymond induction coil was used , r the primary circuit being arranged for an interrupted current , without Helmholtz side wire , and the electrodes being connected with the secondary circuit .
In most of the experiments , currents varying from weak to strong were used , but the results to be described were all obtained , unless otherwise mentioned , by currents barely felt on the tip of the tongue .
In every experiment , as many as feasible of the actions of each spinal nerve were noted , so that the experiments mentioned in dealing with any one class of nerve fibres served to a greater or less extent to determine the origin of other classes of nerve fibres ; how far this was done may easily be made out by noting the numbers assigned to the animals in the different Tables .
The Pupil , Eyelids , and Nictitating Membrane .
The earliest observations on the origin of the pupillo-dilator fibres from the spinal cord are those of Budge and Waller , * in 1851 .
Their experiments wTere made upon Rabbits ; the spinal cord was removed from the lower cervical and upper thoracic regions , and the nerves stimulated in their course through the dura matter .
They found dilation of the pupil on stimulation of the Ilnd .
thoracic nerve , and not on stimulation of any other spinal nerve .
In the following year Budge !
found that in the Rabbit pupillo-dilator fibres were present , in the 1st .
as well as in the Ilnd .
thoracic nerve .

Later ( 1855 ) Budue# stated that , in addition to the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerves , the Vlth .
, Vllth .
, VHIth .
, cervical nerves contained dilator fibres for the pupil .
The experiments were of two kinds\#151 ; ( 1 ) the spinal cord was removed from the 5th cervical to the 3rd thoracic vertebrae , and the electrodes were placed in the intervertebral foramina ; the Vlth .
, Vllth .
, and VUIth .
cervical , and the first two thoracic nerves were found to cause dilation of the pupil .
In experiments conducted in this manner , there must be escape of current , and very little confidence can be placed in the results .
( 2 ) The nerve roots were stimulated .
In this case , the Vllth .
and VUIth .
cervical , and the first two thoracic nerves were found to contain pupillo-dilator fibres .
But as the roots were not ligatured , here also there may be some suspicion of an escape of current .
It is clear , from the introductory remarks , that some part or other of the experiments not infrequently failed , and the matter is spoken of in such a way as to lead me to think that no especial attention was given to determining the exact origin of the dilator fibres .
In 1862 Claude Bernard+ published the result of his investigations on the spinal origin of the sympathetic fibres , causing dilation of the pupil , opening of the eyelids , protrusion of the eyeball , and retraction of the nictitating membrane .
His experiments were made on the Dog .
He found that these fibres issued from the spinal cord in the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerve , and rarely in the Illrd .
thoracic nerve also .
He did not find any constant difference in the extent of the dilation produced by the first two thoracic nerves .
Salkowski^ ( 1867 ) made experiments on Babbits .
He cut the roots of the Vllth .
and VIHth .
cervical , and of the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerves , and observed a slight constriction of the pupil , which was not increased by section of the cervical sympathetic ; he concluded that the pupillo-dilator fibres issued by these spinal nerves , and by no other .
But as he only made one experiment on the effect of cutting the Vllth .
and VIHth .
cervical nerves , apart from the section of the first two thoracic , and in that case no change occurred in the pupil , his experiments are inconclusive as to the exact origin of the pupillo-dilator fibres .
Fran90IS-FranckS ( 1878 ) observed the effect of cutting and of stimulating the rami of the lower cervical and first six thoracic nerves in Cats .
He states that dilator fibres occur in the rami of the Vth .
, Vlth .
, Vllth .
, and VHIth .
cervical nerves ; in the rami of the first five thoracic nerves ; and occasionally in the ramus of the Vlth .
thoracic nerve .
It is not clear that in these experiments due care was taken to avoid an escape of current .

THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
pupil was produced by stimulating the FYth .
cervical to the 1st .
thoracic nerve , inclusive , but this experiment must be neglected , since , subsequently , Ferrier ( 1883 ) pointed out that the nerves taken were really the Yth .
cervical to the Ilnd .
thoracic , and that the Ilnd .
thoracic does cause dilation of the pupil .
Fekrier* ( 1883 ) gives an account of two experiments on an Ape .
He found dilation of the pupil on stimulating the Ilnd .
thoracic , but not on stimulating any other spinal nerve .
No great weight can be placed upon the negative results obtained by Ferrier , for it is possible that the stimuli employed by him were too weak ; his experiments may be taken as showing that the Ilnd .
thoracic is the chief dilator nerve in the Ape .
Knowing that Dr. Sherrington was making some observations upon the Ape 's spinal nerves , I wrote to him about the origin of the dilators for the pupil ; he informed me that he had obtained dilation from the Ilnd .
and the Illrd .
thoracic nerves\#151 ; more pronounced from the former than the latter\#151 ; but had not noticed any distinct effect from the 1st .
thoracic nerve .
Since then , however , he has obtained a distinct , though feeble , dilation from the 1st .
thoracic also .
The origin of the pupillo-dilator nerves in the Ape , appears ( cp .
p. 94 ) to be almost identical with their origin in the Babbit .
Lastly , Navrocki and PrzybYLSKit find in the Cat that dilation of the pupil is caused by stimulating the Vlllth .
cervical and the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerves in the spinal canal , by stimulating the rami communicantes of VITIth .
cervical and of the 1st .
thoracic nerves , and sometimes also by stimulating the ramus of the Ilnd .
thoracic nerve .
I am inclined to think\#151 ; in view of the experiments I mention below\#151 ; that Navrocki and Przybylski have fallen into the not uncommon mistake of counting the 1st .
thoracic as the YHIth .
cervical nerve .
The chief points in the earlier accounts may conveniently be arranged in the following tabular form .

As I have said above , the induction shocks used as stimuli were , as a rule , in my experiments , just felt on the tip of the tongue ; in connection with this it is worth while recalling that Budge ( op.cit .
, 1855 , p. 80 ) noticed in the Babbit that the minimal tetanizing shocks required to produce a dilation of the pupil by stimulation of the sympathetic were stronger than the minimal tetanizing shocks required to give rise to muscular contraction by stimulating the brachial plexus .
Similarly , Bernard ( 1862 ) and , later , Ferrier ( 1883 ) noticed on stimulating the thoracic nerve roots on the Dog and Ape respectively that contraction of the skeletal muscles was obtained with shocks too weak to cause dilation of the pupil .

MR. J. N. LANGLEY ON THE ORIGIN FROM THE SPINAL CORD OF THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
In most of the experiments given above , the various nerves were stimulated over and over again , to compare or make certain of their action .
In the case of the nerves which have but a slight action , there are some obvious precautions to take .
It is well known that after long or repeated stimulation of the cervical sympathetic , the pupil but slowly regains its normal size , and there is a similar protracted positive after-action on the nictitating membrane and eyelids .
Hence it is advisable to stimulate the nerves which have a weak action before those which have a strong action , or , before stimulating the former , to leave an interval of five to ten minutes .
Further , in looking for a slight movement of the eyelids , it is advisable to close them before the nerve stimulation ; thus a distinct movement of the eyelids may be observed at times when , with widely separated eyelids , no movement is appreciable .
It will be noticed that a nerve , the maximum effect of which is not great in any animal , produced in some animals no effect .
The absence of effect might be due either to ( 1 ) the absence of the kind of nerve-fibre governing the action in question , or ( 2 ) to a few nerve-fibres only being present , the number of these being insufficient in the conditions of the experiment to produce an observable effect .
With regard to ( l ) there is certainly a variation in different animals in the constitution of the corresponding spinal nerve .
This I have shown in the case of the lumbar and upper sacral nerves ; it is manifested also in the lower cervical and upper thoracic nerves by the different muscular effects produced by stimulating the corresponding nerves in different animals ; thus , out of eight of the experiments mentioned above , the Ilnd .
thoracic nerve in two cases only caused a movement of the foot .
With regard to ( 2 ) the case is , I think , equally clear ; a nerve which , in favourable conditions , produces a slight but perfectly distinct effect may , later in the experiment or after several stimulations , produce none that can be observed , although its chief action on some other tissue remains obvious throughout .
My experiments are not sufficient to allow me to decide in all cases to which of these causes an absence of effect noted in a particular case is due .
I have , however , given my opinion on the matter , in the diagrams of the origin of the different classes of sympathetic fibres in Plates 9 and 10 .
On account of the general similarity existing between the Dog and the Cat , I have not thought it worth while to make more than three experiments upon the Dog .
In all of these the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerves produced great dilation of the pupil , and the other customary effects on the eye were equally marked .
The Illrd .
thoracic nerve caused in two cases a slight dilation of the pupil , and in one case no certain effect , though there may sometimes have been a trifling dilation ; in all cases it caused a slight but distinct movement of the eyelids and nictitating membrane .
The IYth .
and Yth .
nerve in no case had any perceptible result .
On the Rabbit I have made six experiments .
Some were made after death ( cf. Table , p. 94 ) ; in these the Ilnd .
thoracic nerve retained its dilator action on the pupil longer than the Illrd .
or the 1st .
thoracic nerve , and the effect of the nerves on the skeletal muscles ceased before that on the pupil and eye .
On the other hand , when the upper thoracic nerves were 4-exposed after protracted observation on the lower ones , and death was caused thereby , the effect of the nerves on the eye failed earlier than their effect on the skeletal muscles .

The results of the experiments are :\#151 ; 1 .
The lower cervical nerves in no instance give the faintest indication of action upon either the pupil , the nictitating membrane , or the eyelid .
The VUIth .
cervical nerve\#151 ; the one which most frequently has been said to contain pupillo-dilator fibres\#151 ; I have stimulated with currents of varying strength and of varying duration , without ever producing any effect upon the pupil or eye .
In the experiment given below ( Exp. I. ) , stimulation of the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerves caused a considerable , though slow , dilation of the pupil when the index of the secondary coil of the induction machine was at 15 centims. of the scale , and a rapid complete dilation with all greater strengths of current , whilst stimulation of the Vlllth .
cervical nerve was without a trace of effect on the pupil , whether the index of the secondary coil was at 15 centims. , or at 0 , or at any intermediate position .

The pupil receives dilator fibres from the 1st .
, Ilnd .
, and Illrd .
thoracic nerves .
The relative effect of these nerves varies somewhat in different animals of the same species , and varies considerably in animals of different species .
In the Cat and Dog both the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerves cause great dilation of the pupil ; in the Cat , as a rule , the 1st .
produces greater dilation than the Ilnd .
thoracic , but this is not always the case , and sometimes the Ilnd .
is more powerful than the 1st .
thoracic nerve .
The Illrd .
thoracic nerve has a comparatively slight action , and the extent of its action varies ; in some cases the dilation produced by it is readily observed , in others it requires special attention .
I had thought that , perhaps , the Illrd .
thoracic nerve might produce a greater effect if the pupil were contracted .
To produce contraction , I injected a few milli-grms .
of pilocarpin .
The effect of this , however , was not an increase but a decrease of the dilator action of the nerve .
Experiment ( 3 ) on the Cat , in which I did not observe a distinct dilation of the pupil , on stimulating the Illrd .
thoracic nerve , was one chiefly directed to other ends , and the eye effects were only observed incidentally .
In the Rabbit , the Ilnd .
thoracic nerve is the chief dilator nerve for the pupil ; the Illrd .
thoracic nerve produces a considerable dilation , but less promptly than the THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .

; the 1st .
thoracic has the least action of the three , and in some cases has a very slight effect .
3 .
No dilation of the pupil is caused by stimulating any spinal nerve below the Illrd .
thoracic .
In view , however , of the action of the IVth .
thoracic upon the nictitating membrane and eyelids in the Cat , it is possible that , in some cases and in favourable circumstances , a slight dilation of the pupil might be observed on stimulation of the IVth .
thoracic nerve .
4 .
The nerve-fibres causing retraction of the nictitating membrane and opening of the eyelids , have in the Cat a more extended origin than the dilator fibres for the pupil .
They arise from the first four thoracic nerves , and sometimes from the fifth also .
In nearly all cases the Ilnd .
thoracic nerve is the most effective ; the 1st .
thoracic is more effective than the Illrd .
, the IVth .
has a slight effect , and may sometimes be easily overlooked ; the Vth .
causes at best but a trifling movement .
It will be seen that my results on the Dog confirm the results of Cl. Bernard , with the exception of the rarity of action of the Illrd .
thoracic , and it is possible that on this point my cases may have been exceptional .
In the Cat and Babbit , my results are on many points not in agreement with those of previous observers .
Origin of the Vaso-Motor Fibres for the Head .
Budge# ( 1853 ) , following the lines of Bernard 's description of the effects of section of the cervical sympathetic , stated that the fibres , section of which causes an increase of temperature in the head , pass from the spinal cord in the VHIth .
cervical and first two thoracic nerves .
His experiments consisted in removing the spinal cord from the 8th cervical to the 2nd thoracic vertebrae inclusive , and in cutting the issuing nerves .
He does not , however , mention any experiment on the effect of cutting one of these nerves apart from the other two , or on the effect of stimulating them , so that he can hardly be considered to have shown more than that fibres , later known as vaso-motor , issue by one of the three nerves .
Bernard !
( 1862 ) came to the conclusion that in Dogs vaso-motor nerves for the head were absent from the 1st .
and Ilnd .
thoracic nerves , since section on one side of these nerves in the spinal canal caused no , or only a slight and temporary , increase of temperature on that side of the head .
But he found a considerable rise of temperature when the sympathetic was cut between the 2nd and 3rd ribs ; whether the nerve-fibres producing this effect arise from the spinal cord or from the sympathetic ganglia , Bernard left undecided .
Salkowski^ ( 1867 ) states that in Babbits the vaso-motor fibres for the ear arise from the VHth .
and VIHth .
cervical and the 1st .
and Ilnd .

O cutting these nerves in the spinal canal , he found a dilation of the vessels of the ear .
He gives no experiment upon the effect of cutting the cervical nerves by themselves , and one only on the effect of cutting them after the first two thoracic nerves had been severed ; in the latter case the vessels of the corresponding ear dilated strongly , and underwent , on section of the cervical sympathetic , no further dilation .
The experiment is inconclusive , since the dilation on section of the cervical nerves may have been a reflex one , and section of the cervical sympathetic would probably have no effect on strongly dilated vessels ; sometimes , indeed , it has very little effect when the vessels are not dilated .
Dastre and Morat# ( 1883 ) state that the vaso-dilator fibres for the ear and other parts of the head leave the cord by the last cervical and first two thoracic nerves , and the vaso-constrictor fibres for the same region leave the cord by the ITIrd .

On various grounds they conclude that vaso-constrictor fibres accompany the vasodilators .

Temperature of same side of head noted Nerves in spinal canal , or rami communi-cantes stimulated Nerves in spinal caral stimulated cr\gt ; THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES The regions of the head which I have observed for pallor or flushing as the result of stimulating the spinal nerves are , in the Cat , the ear , the mucous membrane of the mouth and lips , and the tongue ; in the Dog , the same parts , with the omission of the ear , and the addition of the conj unctiva ; in the Rabbit I have observed the ear , conjunctiva , and gums .
These parts do not all show vascular effects with equal distinctness ; in the Rabbit it is well known that the ear is the best part for direct observation ; in the Cat the ear is also good , though sometimes the contraction of the palatine artery is more striking than that of the auricular artery .
In the one experiment made on the Dog the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth was found to respond more distinctly than any other part .
In addition to these direct observations I have made one indirect observation on the origin of the vaso-constrictor fibres of the sub-maxillary gland .
A little pilocarpin produces , as is known , a protracted and regular secretion of saliva ; if the cervical sympathetic be stimulated whilst this secretion is going on , there is after a normal transient increase , a decrease in the rate of secretion ; this is accompanied by a constriction of the blood-vessels of the gland .
In the absence , then , of any evidence of inhibitory secretory fibres in the sympathetic , and in view of Heidenhain 's experiment on decreasing the blood-flow to the gland by compressing the artery , we may take a decrease in the rate of the pilocarpin-secretion produced by stimulating a spinal nerve as showing the presence of vaso-motor fibres in the nerve .
The result of the experiment made in this way is given in the Table below [ Dog ( 3 ) ] .
Some further account of the experiment will be found in the section dealing with the secretory nerves .
My experiments have not been directed to determining with accuracy any differences which there may be in the origin of the vascular nerves of the different parts of the head .
They show , however , that if there are differences , the differences are not great .
The origin of the vascular nerve-fibres in the Rabbit has certain peculiarities which make it desirable to treat it by itself .

The results of these experiments are :\#151 ; 1 .

cervical nerves cause neither contraction nor dilation of the vessels of the head .
2 .
The 1st .
thoracic nerve has a slight and inconstant effect in the Cat ; the effect is a-pparently greater in the Dog .
In Cats , it may be distinct enough to be beyond question , or it may not be perceptible in the conditions of the experiment .
3 .
The llnd .

thoracic nerves cause complete and rapid constriction of the small arteries .
In the Cat the Illrd .
nerve has seemed to me to produce constriction rather more quickly than the llnd .
4 .
The IVth .
thoracic also causes complete constriction , but more slowly than either the llnd .
or Illrd .
; in the Dog its effect is less than in the Cat. 5 .
The Vth .
thoracic nerve has less effect than the IVth .
; in the Cat the constriction caused by it , though it may be complete , is usually slow .
In Gat ( 8 ) , however , stimulation of the left Vth .
thoracic for three seconds , with induction shocks of moderate strength , was sufficient to cause complete constriction of the auricular artery lasting for half to one minute .
In the Dog I have no satisfactory evidence of the existence of vaso-motor fibres in the Vth .
nerve , but I think it probable that they are sparsely present .
6 .
The thoracic nerves below the Vth .
have not in the Cat and Dog any effect upon the vessels of the head .
It has already been mentioned that Dastre and Morat found in the Dog flushing of the bucco-facial region on stimulating any one of the llnd .
to Vth .
thoracic nerves .
In my experiments no flushing was observed , although shocks of widely different strength were used ; the nerves which produced any effect , viz. , the 1st .
to IVth .
, caused pallor only in this region .
At the same time I have no doubt that , by varying the experimental conditions , flushing , instead of pallor , would be obtained .
Turning now to the Rabbit , we have\#151 ; THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .

Comparing the Rabbit with the Cat and , we see that:\#151 ; 1 .
The upper limit of origin of the vaso-motor nerves for the head is rather lower in the Rabbit ; for in this animal the 1st .
thoracic apparently sends no vaso-motor fibres to the sympathetic , and the Ilnd .
comparatively few .
2 .
In the Rabbit the origin of the sympathetic vaso-motor nerve-fibres is more extended than in the Cat and Dog , for in the former they originate from seven spinal nerves ( Ilnd .
to Ylllth .
thoracic ) .
There are other and minor differences which need not be detailed here .
It is noticeable that the uppermost and the lowermost nerve , each producing but a slight effect upon the ear , produces a local effect ; the middle portion of the artery , or the mid together with the lower portion becoming completely constricted , whilst the rest shows little or no change .
When a nerve has a slight effect only , its effect is usually variable ; it may cause a brief constriction followed by a pronounced dilation , whilst the nerve is still being stimulated , or a dilation alone ; the dilation is more marked with weak than with strong currents .
Secretory Nerves to the Sub-Maxillary Gland .
I do not knowT of any observations on the exact origin from the spinal cord of the sympathetic secretory fibres to the salivary glands .
I have confined my attention to the sub-maxillary gland of the Cat and Dog .
The chordo-lingual nerve ( he .
, the lingual nerve before the chorda tympani leaves it ) is cut , a cannula tied in the duct , the animal turned over and the spinal nerves laid bare and stimulated .
The observation requires some care , since , in the position of the animal , the cannula unless carefully supported , causes by its weight a kink in the duct .
I have not found that the spinal nerves , with the exception of the Ilnd .
thoracic , cause a secretion with the same constancy as they cause oculo-pupillary and vascular effects .
A longer interval must be left between successive stimuli , or the stimuli , if repeated , must be brief .
Generally speaking , it is best to stimulate for ten seconds out of each thirty , during about three minutes .
The absence of secretion on stimulation , although the nerve contains secretory fibres , is probably in the main due to the retarding effect on secretion of the diminished blood supply to the gland .
In the Cat , the cervical sympathetic produces normally a fairly rapid secretion for ten to fifteen seconds ; I have in no case obtained with any spinal nerve a secretion as plentiful as that given ordinarily by the cervical sympathetic ; although as we have already seen , an apparently maximal effect on the pupil and eye can be produced by two spinal nerves , and an apparently maximal effect on the vessels of the ear by three or four spinal nerves .
When a spinal nerve , stimulated with weak induction shocks , fails to cause a secretion , although other visceral effects are produced , the strength of the current THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
should be progressively increased .
It is with secretory fibres only that I have sometimes found it necessary to use currents distinctly strong to the tip of the tongue , in order to produce an effect .

, p. 106 It will be seen from the experiments that the find , thoracic nerve had a distinctly greater effect on secretion than any other .
The Illrd .
thoracic nerve , in each of the experiments , caused some secretion , but in three of these several stimuli were sometimes necessary before a secretion was visible .
The IVth .
and Yth , thoracic nerves gave rise , in one Cat only , to an appreciable secretion ; the I Yth .
nerve was more effective than the Yth .
; in the other cases the secretion was a secondary consideration , and it is probable that , with greater precautions , the IYth .
and Yth .
nerves might have been found to contain a few secretory fibres , In the Dog , though in an experiment conducted by a different method , secretory fibres were found in the IYth nerve ; with regard to the Yth .
the evidence was not very satis-factory , but apparently a few secretory fibres were present .
The 1st .
thoracic nerve in the Cat gave evidence once only of containing secretory fibres ; in the Dog , on the other hand , more or less satisfactory evidence was obtained in all three cases .
The origin of the secretory fibres in the Cat and Dog bears , then , a very close resemblance to the origin of the vaso-motor fibres in these animals ; in the Dog both secretory and vaso-motor fibres are more represented in the 1st .
thoracic than in the Vth , ; whilst the reverse is the case in the Cat. In order to allow a judgment upon the experiments in the Dog ( No. 3 ) , spoken of above as being conducted by a different method , some details regarding it must be given .
I have shown* that , ordinarily , whilst a pilocarpin secretion is going on , a brief stimulation of the sympathetic causes an increase in the secretion greater than the amount produced when there is no pilocarpin secretion .
From this it seemed probable that if pilocarpin were given , and the spinal nerves stimulated , secretory fibres might be detected , even though present in very scanty numbers .
The experiment thus conducted completely answered expectation ; I give here sufficient of it to illustrate its chief point .

I. The greater part of the increased flow of saliva , following immediately on stimulation , occurred in the first 7 to 10 seconds .
Allowing for the slow gradual decrease of the pilocarpin secretion , an increase in rate of flow on or after stimulation implies the presence of secretory nerve fibres , a decrease in the rate of flow implies the presence of vaso-motor fibres .

THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
Cardiac Accelerator Fibres .
The existence in Mammals of cardiac accelerator fibres passing from the spinal cord through the sympathetic system , was made probable by the experiments of v. Bezold , # shown by those of M. and E. Cyon.+ Although many observations have been carried out on the accelerator fibres , very few have been directed to the exact determination of the spinal nerves which contain them .
Beaver and v. BezoldJ found in Babbits that , after the spinal cord had been cut at the level of the second thoracic vertebra , a quickening of the rate of heart-beat could still be obtained without a rise of blood-pressure by stimulating the cervical spinal cord ; they thought that spinal cardiac nerves left the cord chiefly , if not entirely , above the second thoracic vertebra .
As the result of direct stimulation , they concluded that the accelerator nerve fibres passed to the sympathetic by the radix longa and radix brevis of the ganglion stellatum , that is to say , they issued from the cord by the lower cervical nerves .
SchmiedebergS stimulated in the Dog the radix longa and radix brevis , apparently once only , and did not find an accelerating action .
He considered , however , that his experiments were not sufficient to prove the absence of accelerating fibres in these roots .
Boehm and N(jssbaum|| stimulated the radix longa in the Cat , and in two out of five cases obtained distinct acceleration .
The radix longa they describe as coming from the Ylth .
and Vllth .
cervical nerves .
Stricker and Wagner , IF in one experiment on the Dog , stimulated the upper rami of the ganglion stellatum , and observed no effect in the heart .
They obtained , however , acceleration on stimulating the sympathetic below the ganglion stellatum ; and they found that , when the sympathetic was tied about the level of the seventh rib , and the rami up to the ganglion stellatum severed , the acceleration was greater the nearer the ganglion the sympathetic was stimulated .
These experiments tend to show that the Ylth .
, Yth .
, IYth , Illrd .
, and probably also the Ilnd .

Accelerator fibres .
The accelerator nerve I have investigated in the Cat only .
In the section treating of the secretory fibres , we have seen that three out of the four nerves which may be regarded as normally containing secretory fibres , may , in a particular animal , produce no secretion on stimulation .
I have interpreted this as meaning that there are certain conditions in the experiment which tend to prevent the occurrence of a secretion .
A similar state of things holds , and perhaps even to a still greater degree , in regard to the accelerator nerve-fibres .
In one animal , the 1st .
to the IVth .
thoracic nerves will constantly produce marked quickening of the heart-beat , whilst in another animal , the 1st .
to the IVth .
thoracic nerves will as constantly be without effect .
I take this to be due primarily to varying responsiveness to accelerator impulses\#151 ; at a certain degree of irresponsiveness each nerve will fail to produce an effect according to the number of accelerator fibres it contains\#151 ; and secondarily , to a variation in the number of accelerator nerve-fibres in the corresponding nerves .
Boehm and Nussbaum , Stricker and Wagner , and others , have noticed that the " accelerator nerves " in the thorax have much less effect on the left side than on the right .
This was also the case in my experiments .

thoracic nerves contain in some animals a considerable number of accelerator fibres , in others the direct evidence of such fibres is slight or absent .
4 .
The Vth .
thoracic appears occasionally to have a few accelerator fibres , but further evidence is desirable .
5 .
The YIth .
may perhaps occasionally have a few accelerator fibres , but at present this must be regarded as very doubtful .
It may be noted that in Cat ( 7 ) , the Vth .
and Vlth .
thoracic nerves , when stimulated after an interval of rest , caused the heart to take wider excursions , as if beating more strongly , this effect might or might not be accompanied by a slight slowing ; when the nerve was stimulated several times , say at intervals of \\ or 2 minutes , this effect on the heart rapidly disappeared , although the rise of blood-pressure remained much the same .
Stimulation of the lower cervical nerves , instead of causing acceleration , usually caused a slowing or irregularity in the heart-beat ; this was probably brought about , indirectly , by the strong muscular contraction .
It will be noticed that the origin of the accelerator nerves very closely corresponds \#151 ; and may possibly be identical\#151 ; with the origin of the vaso-motor fibres for the head .
I must confess that I had expected the origin of the cardiac nerve-fibres to be several segments lower than that of the nerve-fibres to the auricular artery .
I have made one or two experiments on the Dog to determine the position of the nerve-cells with which the accelerator fibres are connected .
In these experiments the rami communicantes of the upper thoracic nerves , the ganglion stellatum , the nerves running from the ganglion stellatum , the inferior cervical ganglion and the nerves running from it , were stimulated before and after application of 1 per cent , nicotin to one or both ganglia .
The experiments were not altogether satisfactory , since after opening the chest there was some inconstancy in the action of the nerves before nicotin was applied to the ganglion .
On the whole , however , they were decidedly in favour of some accelerator fibres being connected with nerve-cells in the ganglion stellatum , and others with nerve-cells in the inferior cervical ganglion .

THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
Some Remarks upon the preceding Observations .
The foregoing experiments have shown that in the Rabbit , Cat , and Dog , the cervical sympathetic arises from the first seven thoracic nerves at least ; and that in the Rabbit it receives a few fibres from the eighth thoracic nerve .
But this similarity in extent of origin in the three animals is somewhat superficial , for the Vlth .
and Vllth .
thoracic nerves are represented in the cervical sympathetic of the Rabbit by vaso-motor fibres , whilst in the Cat and Dog they are represented by pilo-motor nerve-fibres ; \#151 ; a class of nerve fibre which appears to be absent in the Rabbit .
Comparing the Rabbit with the Cat and Dog as regards sympathetic nerve-fibres which are present in all , we find that in the Cat and Dog the sympathetic fibres of any one kind are higher in origin , and in some cases are present in fewer spinal nerves than they are in the Rabbit .
Thus in the Cat and Dog , the 1st .
thoracic nerve has a strong and the Illrd .
thoracic has a slight pupillo-dilator action , whilst in the Rabbit the action of the Illrd .
thoracic nerve is usually greater than that of the 1st .
So , too , in the Cat and Dog , the vaso-motor fibres stretch\#151 ; broadly speaking\#151 ; from the 1st .
to the Vth .
thoracic nerves inclusive , whilst in the Rabbit they extend from the Ilnd .
to the VIITth .
thoracic nerves inclusive .
It is in harmony with this that in the Rabbit the Ilnd .
thoracic always , or nearly always , sends motor fibres to the fore foot , whilst in the Cat and Dog the lowest motor fibres for the fore foot commonly proceed from the 1st .
thoracic nerve .
Differences like these between the Cat and Dog on the one hand , and the Rabbit on the other , exist also , though only to a slight extent , between the Cat and the Dog .
Generally speaking , in the Dog , the nerve-fibres of any one kind are a trifle higher in origin than in the Cat. There is another point deserving of notice .
If we consider the various actions of the first seven thoracic nerves in the Cat , noting by which nerves the maximal actions are produced , we find that each nerve except the IVth .
can produce an effect on some tissue which is not exceeded by that produced by any other nerve .
Thus : I. Maximal effect on the pupil .
II .
Maximal effect on pupil , eye , secretion , sometimes acceleration of heart , and perhaps sometimes on blood-vessels of head .
III .
Maximal effect on blood-vessels of head , and sometimes on acceleration of heart .
IV .
V. Maximal effect on hairs of face and neck .
VI .
Maximal effect on hairs of face and neck ; and occasionally on sweat glands of fore foot .
VII .
Maximal effect on sweat glands of fore foot .
This gap in the series cannot , so far as our present information goes , be filled up by Bradford and Dean 's vaso-motor fibres for the lungs , for they find that the Illrd .
thoracic has a greater effect than the IVth .
, and\#151 ; to judge from one passage\#151 ; that the Ilnd .
has more effect than the Illrd .
Remarks on the White and Grey Kami Communicantes .
I have in the .
preceding sections dealt with the origin from the spinal cord of various classes of sympathetic nerve-fibres in a particular region of the sympathetic system .
The fibres proceeding from the cord to the sympathetic can only pass by the rami communicantes , and as there are two kinds of rami communicantes , one consisting mainly of medullated , and the other mainly of non-medullated nerve-fibres , we are naturally driven to consider\#151 ; especially in the light of Gaskell 's work quoted below\#151 ; whether the nerve-fibres with which we have been dealing pass by one only or by both of these .
A full account of the previous work on the white and grey rami is not necessary here ; it will be sufficient to mention one or two of the chief observations .
Beck , ' " ' in 1846 , in a paper on the nerves of the uterus , stated as the result of dissecting and teasing nerves in Man , that the white rami consisted of " tubular , " i.e. , of medullated fibres which arose from the spinal cord , passed from it in the anterior and posterior roots , and then ran peripherally chiefly in the splanchnics and other similar nerves .
These " tubular " fibres had , he considered , no connection with the " corpuscles " of the sympathetic ganglia .
The grey rami consisted almost altogether of " gelatinous , " i.e. , of non-medullated fibres which had their origin in the " corpuscles " of the sympathetic ganglia .
The grey rami thus ran from the ganglia to their peripheral distribution ; a few " gelatinous " fibres could be seen in the anterior and posterior roots , but these Beck thought supplied the bloodvessels of the spinal cord .
The scarce " tubular " fibres in the grey rami he considered to be fibres which had left the spinal cord by the white rami .
The experiments of Budge and Waller and of many others showed that all the effects which can be produced by stimulating the sympathetic in any region can be produced by stimulating the spinal nerves in the vertebral canal , or by stimulating the cord itself .
In consequence of these observations , and of the progress of histological knowledge regarding the ganglion cells , it became probable , though by no means proved , that efferent sympathetic nerve-fibres were simply cerebro-spinal nerves having one or more nerve-cells on their course .
This view was advocated by GASKELL.t Both Beck and Gaskell describe the grey ramus as a nerve-bundle running from the sympathetic chain to peripheral endings in blood-vessels or other structures .
And both do so on similar grounds .
Beck followed the grey rami by dissection and teasing , Gaskell by cutting serial sections .
According to Gaskell all the non-medullated fibres which pass from the grey rami centrally , run * Beck , ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1846 , p. 213 .
t Gaskell , ' Journal of Physiology , vol. 7 , 1886 , p. 1 .
THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
to the membranes of the spinal cord , and do not enter it with the anterior and posterior roots .
So far , then , what may be regarded as shown is that only medullated fibres run from the spinal cord to the sympathetic chain , and that the white rami contain very many medullated fibres whilst the grey rami contain very few .
The asserted sharp distinction between white and grey rami stands , however , on a different footing .
So far as concerns their histological characters , the difference between them is rather one of degree than of kind , they both contain medullated fibres of various sizes , and non-medullated fibres .
The principal unknown points are the nature and course of the medullated fibres of the grey rami .
It is probable that they course peripherally with the non-medullated fibres of the rami , for each grey ramus divides as , or before , xt reaches its spinal nerve , and part runs peripherally with the nerve , and part runs towards the spinal cord ; it is reasonable to suppose that the medullated fibres in the two parts have similar functions , and since those in one part run peripherally , so presumably do those in the other .
As Gaskell has pointed out , the question of the connections of the white and grey rami may be attacked from the side of physiological experiment , as well as from that of histological observation .
Some nerves have both white and grey rami , others have grey only .
A preliminary point to make certain of in this line of inquiry is the distribution of the white and grey rami .
Beck 's description for Man , is that white and grey rami communicantes are present in the thoracic and lumbar regions ; in passing down the lumbar region the white rami become smaller , and the grey rami larger ; in the pelvic region grey rami only are present .
Onodi* gives a similar description for the Horse .
Gaskell made observations on the Dog ; he found that the rami communicantes of the lower cervical and 1st .
thoracic nerves were grey only .
The uppermost white ramus came from the Ilnd .
thoracic , the lowermost white ramus was from the lYth .
lumbar nerve.t Below this , grey rami only were present .
I have examined the white and grey rami in the Dog , Cat , and Rabbit .
The uppermost white ramus I find to be in all cases given off by the 1st .
thoracic nerve .
I have given more attention to this in the Cat and Dog than in the Rabbit .
In dissecting in the Cat and Dog , the uppermost obvious white ramus is that from the Ilnd .
thoracic ; but with a little trouble one , two , or three fine white strands can be seen stretching from the 1st .
thoracic nerve to the ganglion stellatum .
When these are hardened in osmic acid and sections cut , they are seen to have the characters of white rami , that is , they consist chiefly of small medullated fibres collected in bundles , * Onodi , ' Arch. f. Anat .
u. Physiol. ' ( Anat .
Abt .
) , p. 145 , 1884 .
t Gaskell speaks of this as the Ilnd .
lumbar nerve\#151 ; giving the Dog 15 thoi'acic instead of 13\#151 ; in order that the corresponding lumbar and sacral nerves in the Dog and Man may have the same numbering .
I do not , however , think that this method attains its object , so that I prefer to count the thoracic nerves according to the number of ribs .
Q 2 with a few medium and medium-large fibres ; between the bundles are a variable number of non-medullated fibres ; besides these there are one or more grey rami , bundles consisting chiefly of non-medullated fibres , but containing scattered medullated fibres .
In three out of the four cases in which , in the Dog , the tissue between the 1st .
thoracic nerve and the ganglion stellatum was hardened and cut , there was more than one white ramus , in other nerves there is occasionally more than one white ramus , and the Illrd .
lumbar nearly always , if not always , has two , easily seen with the eye .
In one case I counted roughly the number of small medullated fibres in the rami of the 1st .
thoracic nerve , and found about 500 to be present .
As regards the position of the lowermost white ramus , I agree in the main with Gaskell .
As a rule , both in Dog and Cat , the lowermost white ramus is given off by the IVth .
lumbar nerve ; the ramus runs to , or nearly to , the Yth .
lumbar sympathetic ganglion ; sometimes , however , there is a white ramus to the Ylth .
lumbar sympathetic ganglion , arising , apparently , from the Yth .
lumbar nerve ; but it is possible that this ramus is really brought to the Yth .
nerve by the descending branch of the IYth .
Further , in the two cases in which I have noticed an additional nerve in the dorso-lumbar region in the Cat , * the last white ramus was from the Yth .
and not from the IYth .
lumbar nerve ; in both of these cases , the Yth .
lumbar nerve was , I think , in the main homologous with the IYth .
lumbar nerve of the normal animal .
In the Rabbit , the lowermost white ramus is , as a rule , from the Yth .
lumbar nerve ; this corresponds to the IYth .
lumbar of the Cat and Dog .
We may now consider the bearing of the experiments on stimulating the nerves in the spinal canal upon the question of the nature of the medullated fibres in the grey rami .
In the first section of this paper , it has been shown that no trace of any one of the effects which can be produced by stimulating the upper thoracic nerves and the cervical sympathetic , can be produced by stimulating the lower cervical nerves .
That is to say , the medullated nerve-fibres wThich are present in the grey rami of the lower cervical nerves , are either not efferent fibres , or they are too fewr to produce any perceptible effect .
The 1st .
thoracic spinal nerve , the uppermost nerve which has a white ramus , is the uppermost nerve wdiich on stimulation produces sympathetic effects .
I have also made a considerable number of experiments in the Cat and Rabbit upon the stimulation of the lumbar nerve-roots , as many as possible of the sympathetic effects being observed .
In the Cat , the IYth .
lumbar was in all cases , save one , the lowermost nerve which caused any sympathetic effect .
The exception occurred in one of the Cats spoken of above , in which there was an extra lumbar nerve , and an extra white ramus .
In the Rabbit the Yth .
lumbar was in all cases the lowest from which a sympathetic effect could definitely be obtained .
Thus in the lower lumbar , as in the lower cervical , no indication could be obtained that the * ' Journal of Physiology , ' vol. 12 , p. 351 , 1891 .
THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
medullated nerve-fibres in the grey rami are efferent fibres proceeding from the sympathetic trunk .
Putting this view on one side , we may pass on to consider some other possibilities with regard to the function of the medullated fibres in the white and grey rami .
Bidder and Volkmann# considered that all medullated fibres could be divided into two classes , differing in histological characters .
They differed also in size , and were separable from one another by the excessive scarcity or , in some instances , by the complete absence of fibres of intermediate size .
On the basis of observation as to the relative number of these two classes of fibres in various typical nerves of the body , they came to the conclusion that the smaller nerve-fibres belonged to the organic or vegetative functions of the body , and that the larger nerve-fibres were concerned with its psychical activities .
The former they called sympathetic,55 the latter " cerebro-spinal " nerve-fibres .
The scattered cerebro-spinal fibres found in the trunk of the sympathetic and its branches they considered to be sensory fibres .
The measurements given by Bidder and Volkmann are in terms of the Paris inch ; in the sympathetic of the Cat the measurements given\#151 ; taking '00001 Paris inch = '0002707 mm.\#151 ; are 11'9 p for the smallest and 17*9 p for the largest cerebro-spinal nerve-fibres , and 4'1 p for the smallest and 5*4 p for the largest sympathetic fibres .
In other nerves , fibres of greater diameter than 5*4 p are included in the class of sympathetic fibres ; thus fibres of 5'9 p in the Illrd .
nerve of the Cat , and fibres of 6'7 p in the skin nerves of Man .
These views received very little support until Gaskell 's work in 1886 .
Gaskell concerned himself with efferent visceral fibres only ; he compared the function and the histological characters of a considerable number of nerves , and pointed out that in all these cases the nerves which had visceral functions contained many small nerve-fibres , so that there was good ground for believing that efferent visceral nerves are always small .
Gaskell gives 1*8 to 3'6 p as the diameter of these nerve-fibres .
The theory of Bidder and Yolkmann , that the large fibres of the sympathetic system are fibres of general sensibility , seemed to me , at first sight , as satisfactory as it was simple , and I was the more inclined to adopt it because of some facts connected with the cervical sympathetic .
Budge and Waller found that stimulation of the cervical sympathetic in an unansesthetised Babbit caused no sign of pain .
1 have on several occasions made special experiments on the anaesthetised Babbit and Cat , with the object of determining whether stimulation of the central end of the cervical sympathetic causes a reflex of any kind .
I have not observed any certain reflex , neither body movement , nor variation of blood-pressure , nor change in rate of respiration or heartbeat , nor alteration in the pupil or arteries of the opposite side of the head .
On microscopical examination the cervical sympathetic is sometimes found to be destitute of any medullated fibre larger than 4 p. Most of the medullated fibres are 2'2 p to * Bidder and Volkmann , ' Die Selbstandigkeit des Sympathischen Nervensystems ' ( Leipzig ) , 1842 .
'S'5 / x , and there are also non-medullated fibres ; sometimes\#151 ; and this was described by Bidder and Yolkmann\#151 ; there are a few larger fibres , viz. , three to six fibres , about 5'5 [ a , and two or three , about 11 / x in diameter .
These fibres , however , are probably derived from the vagus , and run downward , for after section of the cervical sympathetic I have found , some weeks later , a group of six to eight similar fibres just inside the sheath of the superior cervical ganglia .
Notwithstanding the striking corroboration of Bidder and Volkmann 's theory , which is afforded by these facts , further inquiry shows , I think , that in the main it is erroneous .
Before proceeding with this inquiry , it will be convenient to give some observations on the size of the medullated fibres in the grey rami and in the rest of the sympathetic system .
When a piece of a ramus communicans , or of the trunk of the sympathetic down to the 1st .
sacral ganglion , or of one of the branches running to the solar plexus , or to the inferior mesenteric ganglion is teased out , after having been treated with osmic acid for a day , three sizes of medullated fibres at once catch one 's attention .
The fibres are about S / x , 5 / x , and 8 / x respectively .
Occasionally in the branches of the sympathetic , and more frequently in the trunk of the sympathetic and in the white rami , there are fibres 10 / x to 12 / x in diameter .
In examining the several strands of a teased-out piece of nerve , I have rarely felt any hesitation as to which of the three classes each fibre belonged to , the fibres of about 5 / x and 8 / x are markedly different from the rest by the obviousness of the medullary sheath .
But on measuring all the fibres of greater diameter than 3*8 / x , it is found that the gaps between the different classes are very slight , '5 ' and on including in the measurement fibres from different parts of the sympathetic system , all sizes may be found from 2 / x to 12 / x. It will be remembered that Schwalbe , !
in his tables of the size of the nerve fibres in the roots of the spinal nerves of the Frog , gives no break in size corresponding to that described by Bidder and Yolkmann .
The matter , however , requires further careful investigation .
The general appearance of white and grey rami treated with osmic acid and cut transversely is depicted by Gaskell .
I may add some further points of detail .
In the white rami there are , in most cases , more fibres larger than 4 / x than are shown in the particular white ramus figured by Gaskell .
In the grey rami both the total number of medullated fibres , and the relative number of the 3 5 / x , and 8 / x types vary .
The cervical have fewer medullated fibres than the lumbar grey rami , and the VHth .
lumbar has fewer than the YIth .
; in the YIth .
lumbar grey ramus of the Dog there are fifteen to twenty fibres above 4 / x in diameter .
The majority of the medullated fibres are in the peripheral part of the rami .
The number of small medullated fibres * Some or the nerves of intermediate size , probably arise from the division of the larger nerves , f Schwalbe , ' IJeber die Kaliberverhaltnisse der Nervenfasern ' ( Leipzig ) , 1882 .
THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
in the corresponding grey rami of different animals appears to me to vary considerably .
Whilst making experiments upon the effects of stimulating the lower lumbar sympathetic , I usually teased out the grey rami , either fresh or in osmic acid ; in some cases I found large numbers of small medullated nerves .
It is true that in the grey rami , which I have since hardened and cut , the small medullated fibres have been scattered and few , varying from about ten to twenty-five ; but their occasional presence in quantity , in circumstances which do not seem to me to leave open any source of error , leads me to doubt whether a medullated fibre , after passing through a sympathetic cell\#151 ; using this expression for convenience\#151 ; is necessarily non-medullated .
And this doubt is strengthened by some other facts .
In the Frog , the rami communi-cantes of the lower lumbar nerves consist almost entirely of medullated nerves , and [ do not find any grey rami ; most , at any rate , of these medullated fibres are connected with nerve-cells in the sympathetic ganglia .
Further , it will be remembered that Bidder and Volkmann described the short ciliary nerves as being free from interstitial tissue , i.e. , from non-medullated fibres , so that the small medullated nerve-fibres pass through the ciliary ganglion without losing their medulla\#151 ; a fact which has been confirmed by several observers , and recently by Gaskell .
Whilst speaking of the loss of medulla by a nerve , there is another point it is , perhaps , worth while to mention .
It is very commonly assumed that sympathetic nerve-fibres , after being connected with nerve-cells in any one sympathetic ganglion , pass on and are again connected with nerve cells in one or more sympathetic ganglia .
This view has been taken for various reasons , and , amongst others , because ganglion cells are found in the course of non-medullated fibres .
The real explanation of this fact is , I think , that the nerves sometimes lose their medulla a considerable distance before they become connected with nerve-cells .
This explanation receives some confirmation from what I have said above as to the variability in the medullation of the fibres of the grey rami .
The experiments I have published upon the connection of nerve-fibres with nerve-cells , based upon the action of nicotin , give , I think , strong ground for concluding that any one sympathetic nerve-fibre passes into a nerve-cell in one sympathetic ganglion only .
It is sometimes said that medullated fibres cease in the lower lumbar , or in the upper sacral region .
I do not find this to be so in either the Dog , Oat , or Rabbit .
In the cases I have examined , a few medullated fibres were found down to the last sympathetic ganglion ; in the Dog there are a considerable number above the 1st .
sacral ganglion .
From the Ilnd .
sacral ganglion downwards , there are but few in all three animals , but fewest in the Rabbit .
Thus , in one case , the sympathetic between the Ilnd .
and Illrd .
sacral ganglia contained eight medullated fibres only\#151 ; seven small , and one of medium size The number of nerve-cells below this region is , of course , very considerable .
The lower lumbar and upper sacral region is particularly adapted for experiments to determine whether the grey rami contain sensory fibres , and , if so , in which direction they run , since in this region there are no white rami .
The first point to settle was whether afferent fibres run from the sympathetic to the spinal cord by the grey rami .
If the sympathetic trunk in an anaesthetised Cat be laid bare from the Vth .
lumbar ganglion to the Ilnd .
sacra ] , and any part of it be stimulated , a reflex movement , and still more readily a rise of blood-pressure is obtained* , i.e. , afferent fibres leading to these effects are present throughout this region .
If , then , the sympathetic be cut just below the junction of the last white ramus with it , and the sympathetic be stimulated below the point cut , there is no longer a reflex movement , and usually no rise of blood-pressuret ; hence , none of the afferent fibres just spoken of enter the spinal cord by the grey rami of the Vlth .
and Vllth .
lumbar , or of any lower nerve , and it can easily be shown that these afferent fibres pass to the cord by the white rami .
Thus , if the sympathetic trunk be cut between the Ilnd .
and lllrd .
lumbar ganglia , a reflex movement and a rise of blood-pressure is obtained by stimulating the sympathetic in the sacral region , and this effect is obtained , in a more or less marked degree , as long as any one of the white rami below the point of section of the sympathetic remains intact .
A modification of the experiment with the grey rami may be made by tying and cutting one of them as close as possible to the sympathetic trunk , isolating it , and stimulating the end connected with the spinal nerve .
In the Cat , this is , as a rule , most easily done with the ramus of the 1st .
sacral nerve .
Since the ramus is about a centimetre only in length , the interrupted current used must not be too strong , and careful observation must be given to any indication of an escape of current .
In such experiments , I have not been able to observe a reflex action of any kind .
Peripheral effects are obvious , such as secretion of sweat and erection of hairs , but there is no body movement , no variation of blood-pressure , | no dilation of the pupils , and , in short , no signs of any reflex effects .
The next point to attempt to determine was whether the grey rami contain afferent fibres passing not to the spinal cord , but to their peripheral endings .
It is known that a grey ramus runs in part centrally and in part peripherally in its spinal nerve .
If , then , the grey ramus contains afferent fibres of general sensibility in both its branches , stimulation of ( a ) the peripheral end of a spinal nerve , cut in the vertebral canal , and ( b ) of the central end of a spinal nerve after it has been cut in the vertebral canal , should cause a reflex body movement .
I am not aware of any evidence of such a reflex action , and it is unlikely that if it occurred it should have escaped notice .
In numerous experiments upon anaesthetized Cats , I have looked for a body movement other than that occurring in the peripheral area of the nerve stimulated , and have never been able to satisfy myself that any reflex body movement took place .
And stimulation within the spinal canal of the nerves which do not contain vaso-motor fibres , such as the lower cervical and lower lumbar nerves , causes , when curari also has been given , no variation of blood-pressure .
* The reflex effects decrease in passing downwards .
f Occasionally a slight variation of blood-pressure may be observed , probably due to the stimulation of the vaso-motor fibres of the limb , for it is abolished by cutting the nerves to the limb , peripherally of the grey rami .
t Under especially favourable conditions , it is probable that the vascular effects caused by stimulating* the grey ramus of the VII tli .
lumbar , or of the 1st .
sacral nerve , would cause a slight variation of arterial blood-pressure , but I have not observed any .
THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
In other experiments the spinal nerves which give origin to the sciatic were cut in the spinal canal , the sciatic tied and cut in the leg , and its central end stimulated .
No effect was observed .
The sciatic was then isolated up to its origin in the lumbo-sacral plexus , and these origins stimulated , without effect ; lastly the 1st .
sacral nerve as it joined the lumbo-sacral plexus was ligatured , cut , and isolated with its grey ramus , the grey ramus remaining attached to the 1st .
sacral sympathetic ganglion ; stimulation of the grey ramus was without effect until the electrodes were almost touching the ganglion , that is , until there was in all probability an escape of current to the sympathetic chain .
I have also tried in the Dog a similar experiment with the grey rami ; the Vlth .
and Vllth .
lumbar nerves were cut centrally and peripherally of the grey rami , the grey rami isolated , and stimulated .
The grey ramus of the Vllth .
nerve had no appreciable effect on movement , blood-pressure , or respiration ; the grey ramus of the Vlth .
sometimes caused a slight twitch of some lumbar muscle , and a slight effect on the blood-pressure and respiration ; but as these effects were very marked when the adjacent Vlth .
lumbar sympathetic ganglion was stimulated , the effects observed on stimulating the grey ramus may7 have been due to an escape of current to the sympathetic trunk .
Actual experiment , then , gives very little support to the view that there are afferent fibres in the grey ramus .
On the other hand it is in the highest degree improbable that the large medullated fibres should be efferent fibres ; every visceral efferent effect can be fairly attributed to small medullated fibres , and no single visceral efferent effect can , at present , with any probability be attributed to fibres above 4 p , in diameter ; further , as is well known , the Pacinian bodies of the mesentery of the Cat are supplied with fibres arising from the division of large medullated fibres .
Assuming , then , notwithstanding the experimental evidence , that the medium and large fibres in the grey rami are afferent fibres , we have two possibilities to contemplate , ( l ) they may be ordinary fibres of general sensibility , but too few in number to produce on electrical stimulation , and in the conditions of the experiment , the customary reflex actions of such fibres .
With regard to this there are several points to consider .
I do not think that the failure to produce an effect could have been due to the general conditions of the experiment ; for concurrently with my observations on the grey rami , I made also experiments on the white rami , and even with the smallest white ramus I have never failed to obtain a reflex movement of the body and a rise of blood-pressure .
It is well known that sensoi'y fibres are contained in the annulus of Vteussens , in the splanchnic , and in the brandies from the lumbar sympathetic to the inferior mesenteric ganglia , and that the white ramus arises from the posterior as well as from the anterior roots .
Consequently , there was practically no doubt that the white rami contained sensory fibres for the sympathetic system .
Still , partly for the sake of completeness and partly to serve as a control in stimulating the grey rami , I have in various experiments stimulated each white ramus , except those in the lower thoracic region .
The ramus may , in a good many cases , he tied , cut , and its central end stimulated ; in other cases , it is easier and more satisfactory to the the sympathetic above and below the ramus , isolate the portion of the sympathetic between the ligatures , cut the grey ramus , if one is present , and stimulate each end of the sympathetic .
I have said that the uppermost white ramus is that running from the first thoracic nerve to the ganglion stellatum .
I have observed the presence of sensory fibres in this in the following way :\#151 ; The connections of the ganglion stellatum were cut , with the exception of the white ramus , to the 1st thoracic nerve and the two limbs of the annulus of Vieussens , the limbs of the annulus of Vieussens were tied , cut , and stimulated near the ganglion stellatum .
1 have mentioned above that stimulation of the peripheral ends of the spinal nerves in the spinal canal does not cause any perceptible reflex action , but it can hardly be doubted that sensory nerves are distributed to the sheaths of the spinal nerves ; and it may be said that the result shows that , in fact , the electrical stimulation of a few sensory fibres does produce no perceptible reflex effect .
But this argument involves the assumption that the sheath of each spinal nerve does not receive its sensory-supply through its own posterior root\#151 ; an assumption which , so far as I know , is unfounded , and which is at variance with some of the facts upon which the view of " recurrent sensibility " is founded .
Some direct evidence against the view that all the large medullated fibres are fibres of general sensibility of the sympathetic system , is afforded by comparing the degree of sensitiveness of different parts of the sympathetic with the number of large fibres in them .
I have taken thus the splanchnics , the homologous nerves running to the inferior mesenteric ganglion , the hypogastric nerves , the lower lumbar and the sacral sympathetic trunk , and the lumbar grey rami ; and I do not find any satisfactory correspondence between the readiness with which the nerves give a reflex body movement or variation of blood-pressure and the number of large fibres , or of fibres of greater diameter than 4 [ x , contained by them .
Further , the nervus erigens , a nerve of a high degree of sensitiveness , contains in the Babbit a few fibres only larger than 4 [ x.* One other observation bearing on this point may be mentioned .
Whilst stimulating the central end of the annulus of Vieussens , in order to ascertain from which nerve-roots the sensory fibres of the two branches arose , I found that a branch of the posterior limb of the annulus , running to the vagus , produced a reflex far more readily than all the rest of the annulus put together .
This branch was hardened in osmic acid and cut , and no single fibre larger in diameter than 4 was found in it .
( 2 ) The second possibility to consider is that many of the large fibres , and to a varying extent in different nerves , are afferent fibres of some special sense , or subserve local visceral reflexes which escape attention under the conditions of the experiment .
This view seems to me the most probable one .
Some light is thrown on it by considering the depressor nerve .
It is well known from the work of Ludwig and Cyon and others that this nerve causes a reflex fall of blood-pressure , and some- * The nervus erigens usually has one or two fibres 12 to 14 u in diameter .
THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES .
times a slowing of the heart-beat , but does not cause a reflex movement .
In the Rabbit and Cat I have first stimulated the depressor in order to be certain of what reflexes it was capable of giving , and then I have examined the nerve microscopically .
Either teased out or in transverse sections it forms a striking contrast to the cervical sympathetic on account of the number of fibres with deeply-stained distinct medulla , and diameter varying from 4 / u. to 8 or 10 / x , which it contains.* Since in all cases the depressor caused no reflex movement and gave no sign of containing fibres of general sensibility , it is fairly certain , I think , that in this nerve at any rate the larger nerve-fibres are not nerves of general sensibility .
I conclude , then , that the medullated fibres of larger diameter than 4 ju , which occur in the grey rami , are afferent fibres entering the cord by the white rami , but are not for the most part fibres of general sensibility .
It seems to me probable that the afferent fibres of general sensibility are not fibres of any given diameter , but a further consideration of this question is beyond the scope of the present paper .

It will be noticed that in any one figure the white rami are of different thicknesses ; this is to represent roughly the different degree of effect produced by stimulating the corresponding spinal nerve , so that the thicker the ramus the more fibres of the especial kind under consideration pass by it to the sympathetic .
An accurate estimation of the number of fibres of each kind which pass by the several rami is of course at present out of the question .
Further , the representation of the number of fibres in the rami of any one figure is not intended to be compared with the repre sentation of the number of fibres in the rami of any other figure .
When a ramus is represented by a broken line it indicates that a few fibres are sometimes , but apparently not alw'ays , present ; when a ?
is added , it indicates that * In the Rabbit the depressor consists of a few fibres 8 to 10 fi , about 30 fibres of diametei 's between 7 and 4 fi , and a variable number of small medullatel and non-medullated fibres .
It 2 a few fibres are apparently sometimes present in this ramus , but that further evidence is required .
I have also inserted the sympathetic ganglion in which I consider that the nerve-fibres in each particular case become connected with nerve-cells .
Thus all the fibres of the first four figures are , I think , connected with nerve-cells in the superior cervical ganglion , and nowhere else , except for a few aberrant cells properly belonging to this ganglion .
In Fig. 5 the inferior cervical ganglion ( .
) and the ganglion stellatum ( g.st .
