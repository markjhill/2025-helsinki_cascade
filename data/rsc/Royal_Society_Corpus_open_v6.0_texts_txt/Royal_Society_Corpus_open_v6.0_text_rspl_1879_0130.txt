880 ] Diurnal Variation of Carbon Dioxide the .\gt ; 4b Ixicli our experiments point .
Provided we admit that materials of the )met contain ready formed hydrocarbons , and that oxidation may ike place , then the acetylene spectrum might be produced at combatively low temperatures without any trace of the cyanogen spec-um or of metallic lines .
If , on the other hand , we assume only the resence of uncombined carbon and hydrogen , we know that the cetylene spectrum can only be produced at a very high temperature , nd if nitrogen were also present that we should have the cyanogen pectrum as well .
Either , then , the first supposition is the true one , ,0t disproving the presence of nitrogen , or else the atmosphere which he comet meets is hydrogen only , and contains no nitrogen .

Although a large share of attention has been given to the elucidation if the causes which influence the amount of carbonic acid present in he atmosphere during the day , no systematic observations with reference to the relative quantities present in the air of the land during the day and the night appear to have been undertaken since the well-known experiments of the younger De Saussure at Chambeisy , * upwards of 50 years ago ( 1820-30 ) , and a similar set by Boussingault at Paris , t a few years later , until M. Truchotf took up the question in 1873 .
But the results thus obtained cannot be said to be altogether satisfactory .
On the other hand , the question as to the existence of a diurnal variation in the amount of carbonic acid in sea-air may be said to have been fully worked out and set at rest by the careful and extensive set of observations made some years ago by Dr. ThorpeS on the air of the Irish Sea and Atlantic Ocean .
His results went to show that no appreciable diurnal difference exists .
As regards a diurnal variation in the case of land-air , the results of De Saussure are somewhat contradictory ; and latterly , what he himself considered as " one of the most remarkable results " in the whole range of his inquiries\#151 ; the discovery of a distinct diurnal variation in the amount of carbonic acid\#151 ; has been regarded as but very imperfectly established .
De Saussure published his first set of results which were deduced * " Ann. de Chim .

In 1830 he published a further set of results , among which was some experiments not made with the primary object of establishin this variation , but for the purpose of finding the difference betwee the amounts of carbonic acid in the air of a town ( Geneva ) and c the open country.* There were in all 13 such experiments extendin over parts of two years ( 1827-28 ) , eight of which had reference to tl day and five to the night .
Upon examining these a diametricall opposite result to his former one is obtained .
The mean of those made in the country gives , for the day , 4'45 vols .
, and for the night 4'02 vols .
C03 in 10,000 of air ; thus showing an excess of 043 vol. i favour of the day .
The experimental evidence as to the existence of a diurnal variation in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide was therefore incon elusive , and I accordingly undertook , at Dr. Thorpe 's suggestion am with his collaboration , to carry out a series of observations wit ) direct reference to the question at Grasmere in Westmoreland during the summer and autumn of 1879 .
Up to this time the state of our knowledge concerning a diurna variation in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide may be said U be comprised in the following statement .

] *\#187 ; the Amount of Carbon Dioxide the Air .
345 The method of estimation which I employed consisted in absorbing he carbonic acid from a known volume of air by means of baryta vater of known strength , the amount of carbonic acid so absorbed !
eing determined by titrating the alkaline fluid with a standard acid olution , 1 cub. centim. of which was approximately equal to 1 mgrm .
of JOThis method is generally known as Pettenkofer 's , but it is worth toting that it had been used by Dalton as far back as 1802.* It is \gt ; articularly well adapted to the end I had in view , for it is not nerely the most expeditious of the processes hitherto devised , but it illows of the observations being made under strictly comparative conditions . .
The observations to which this communication refers were made in a garden at Grasmere situated at the foot of a hill some 1,300 feet or 1,400 feet high , and which lies only a few feet above the level of the adjacent lake , which is 208 feet above that of the sea .
They were commenced on the 21st July and continued to the 25th October ; the whole summer and autumn being of an exceptionally wet and sunless character .
It wras originally intended to pursue the observations " dedie in diem " until a sufficient number were obtained to furnish a trustworthy average for comparison ; but the weather proved such as to render this , if not impracticable , at least undesirable owing to the difficulty , especially at midnight , of filling the jars with air in the open without at the same time admitting a few drops of rain also , even although the greatest care was used in the operation .
Whenever , therefore , any such danger owing to the state of the weather seemed imminent , and that there was therefore a chance of the error so occasioned creeping into the experiments , the observation for the particular time was abandoned .
In some instances by slightly varying the times chosen for the observations ( noon and midnight ) it was found possible to include some that otherwise must , for the foregoing reason , have been omitted .
And , with but few exceptions , the slight differences as to time observable in the accompanying tables aie to be attributed to this cause .
The place chosen for collecting the air for examination was a nook on the lawn upwards of 100 feet from the house and almost entirely surrounded by trees , shrubs , and flowers ; the plants being chiefly the following , namely : pine , yew , holly , laurel , hawthorn , mountain ash , rhododendron , geranium , rose , phlox , and azalea .
The air was taken at from four to five feet from the ground and always , with one or two exceptions noted in the tables , at the same place .
On two or three occasions it was taken near a conservatory , by well lighting the interior of which it was possible to dispense with the lamp otherwise employed when filling the jars at night ; and thus * Dr. Angus Smith , " Ah* and Eain , " p. 448 et seq. Prof. G. F. Armstrong .
Diurnal Variation [ Apr. 2* it was possible to ascertain whether any errors were being introduce thereby .
The jars used for collecting the air were the ordinary spice jars c the confectioners , but of a somewhat unusually large size and wjT mouths sufficiently wide to readily admit the hand for cleansing am drying .
The latter was effected by means of clean linen cloths specialh kept for the purpose .
The mouths of the jars were easily and tighth closed with Jennings ' tin and india-rubber capsules .
The jars employed were four in number , and were distinguished a : A , B , C and D. Their available capacities were as follow :_ A=14,260 cub. eentims .
B=14,845 cub. centims. C=14,905 cub. centims. D=13,385 cub. centims. The quantities of air experimented upon are thus very considerable indeed the jars are by far the largest hitherto employed in similar in-vestigations since De Saussure used a globe of 34 litres ; while they are nearly double the capacity of those used by Dr. Thorpe in his Atlantic and Irish Sea experiments .
The increased quantity of air thus taken for examination should , it will be seen , tend to enhance the value and accuracy of the results , since the possibility of detecting any differences that may exist in the amounts of carbonic acid present in the air during the day and at night is thereby greatly increased .
The mode of filling the jars , the interiors of which were previously carefully dried and polished , was partly by blowing the air into them with a large pair of ordinary kitchen bellows and partly by violently tossing them to and fro ; but a test experiment showed that the latter means was alone sufficient for the purpose .
Baryta water , the strength of which was frequently tested , was used to absorb the carbonic acid , and 75 cub. centims. were introduced into each jar .
This quantity was chosen to allow of a duplicate titration of 25 cub. centims. in each experiment .
After being filled with air and the baryta water added , the jars were well shaken and rolled on their sides so as to cover their internal surfaces with the baryta solution , and they were then allowed to stand not less than four hours .
Several test experiments showed that this time was sufficient to effect the maximum absorption of the carbonic acid so attainable .
1 wo jars at least were filled at each observation , and wherever the results from one jar only are noted in the tables the omission is due to some accident either in the filling , or at a subsequent stage of the* experiment .
The exposure of the baryta water being completed , the contents ol each jar were quickly decanted into a stoppered bottle and allowed to stand until the liquid was perfectly clear .
And this was found to be \lt ; ) 1880 .

point of importance , inasmuch as the precision with which the titration point can he fixed is largely dependent upon there being no carbonate in suspension .
The acid used in titration was a standard solution of sulphuric as used by Dalton , 1 cub. centim. of which was equal to 1 mgrrn .
of \#166 ; arbonic acid .
This was substituted for the oxalic acid as recommended by Pettenkofer owing to its greater stability .
The point of neutrality was ascertained by means of a dilute alcoholic solution of pure aurin ; a definitely measured quantity being employed in each titration .
The results thus obtained and set forth in the following tables , fully establish the existence of a diurnal variation in the quantity of carbonic acid , the night average exceeding that of the day by 0*34 cub. centim. in 10,000 of air ; the quantities respectively being very nearly in the ratio of 90 to 100 .
These figures are , as will be seen , based upon 53 day and 62 night experiments ; there being 27 complete day and 29 complete night observations .

C02 in 10,000 of air obtained in the present instance ; a difference , that is , of only 0-04 vol. C03 in 10,000 of air This close correspondence between the results is important on account of the method of determination pursued being essentially the same in each case , with the exception that Schulze employed jars of only 4 litres capacity as compared with 14 litres in the present case .
But what is chiefly interesting in this comparison arises from the fact of these low averages obtained by Schulze having been attributed to the contiguity of Rostock , where the experiments were made , to the sea .
They approximated so closely to Dr. Thorpe 's Atlantic results* for the day , namely , 3'011 vols .
C03 in 10,000 of air , that their lowness was generally regarded as being due to the influence of sea-air , and this solution has been the more forcibly urged also owing to the fact that , in using a modern method of determination , an average of 347 similar experiments made at Duhmef by Fittbogen and Hasselbarth , has been found to give as much as 3'34 vols .
CCh , and 17 other determinations made by Henneberg at Weend , near Gottingen , J 32 vols .

of air , while Truchot has obtained considerably higher figures still .
A similar explanation might with equal plausibility be applied to the low results more recently obtained by ReisetS in the open country near Dieppe .
For , although he employed the more perfectly absorbing method of the aspirator and Woulfe 's bottles , and for the remainder followed Pettenkofer 's plan of determination , yet , as a mean of 92 experiments made between September , 1872 , and August , 1873 , his average is only 2'942 vols .
C03 in 10,000 of air .
This result , it will be seen , agrees in a still more remarkable manner with that arrived at in the Grasmere experiments , the difference between the two averages being only 0'018 vol. C02 in 10,000 of air .
But the sea-air explanation can scarcely be so confidently relied upon in the latter instance as in some of the others .
Rostock and the place at which the air was collected near Dieppe , are both close to the sea , the one on the embouchure of the Rebel , and the other not more than 5 miles from the coast .

the other hand , is fully 20 miles distant from the sea along the lost direct line that can be drawn .
From this , then we may infer that there may possibly be other causes which tend to reduce the amount of carbonic acid present , supposing , that is , that the results m Question do materially differ from the normal state ; an assumption which , as regards the open country , has not yet been clearly established .
, The most distinct climatological peculiarity of Grasmere may be said to be its rainfall , which , during such a year as last when the observations in question were made , might have risen to 120 or 130 inches , and it is situated , moreover , within 6 or 7 miles of a point on the Sty-Head Pass which has the largest rainfall in the British Isles , an average , that is , of 175 , or in bad years such as last , of 200 inches per annum , while the general average for Great Britain is under 30 inches .
A glance at the temperature columns in the tables will show how frequently the point of saturation was practically reached during the observations .
... .
- , It is hardly possible , however , that the diminished quantity of the carbonic acid is due to the solution of this gas in rain-water .
It is well known that the amount of any gas absorbed by water is a function of the pressure which it itself exerts ; and it may be readily shown that the actual pressure of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere is far too small to exert any sensible influence upon its amount m the air .
If this explanation , therefore , of a diminished quantity of carbonic acid is no longer available , may we not possibly turn to the operation of such an exceedingly active vegetation as is found in some parts of the English Lake District as a more feasible cause of any observed reduction in its amount ?
For we are not without evidence , as some further experiments shortly to be described as well as those of M. Reiset , near Dieppe , appear to indicate , that this may after all be the chief disturbing agent .
But to return to the point of chief importance in connexion with the experiments at Grasmere , the unquestionable evidence , that is , they afford of an appreciable diurnal variation in the amount of atmospheric carbonic acid .
... The only results with which , in reference to this point , it is worth while to compare them , are those of M. Truchot made at Clermont Ferrand , Auvergne , in 1873 .
With these , although they agree as to the main fact of the existence of a diurnal difference , they nevertheless disagree considerably as to its amount .
M , Truchot , for instance , as shown by the table ( ante , p. 344 ) , has detected a diurnal variation in air taken in the neighbourhood of vegetation and in sunshine\#151 ; in a position that is presumably identical with that in which the Grasmere observations were made of as much as 2'34 vols .

[ Apr. 29 unsurrounded by vegetation the diurnal difference is as hicffi as 0-fi4 voh C02 m 10,000 of air .
These results compared with that obtained at Grasmere\#151 ; a diurnal variation , namely , of 0 34 vol. CO , in 10 00( of air-seem to point to some cause of variance unconnected with either climate or local conditions .

i n'T W .1 \th , efjistence of a diuraal variation may be said to 11 estabbsbed\gt ; the question as to upon what the difference observed depends still remains to be answered .
That in the main it is due to plant action seems more than probable .
And in order to test the accepted theory that plants absorb carbonic acid during the dav and exhale it at night\#151 ; to establish which must clearly be a first step m the evidence in proof of a connexion between vegetable activity and a diurnal variation m the quantity of atmospheric carbon dioxide\#151 ; a short series of experiments , ten in all , was made at Grasmere concurrently with those an account of which has already been given .
But before entering into a description of these it will be useful to refer to the somewhat recent experiments of M. Reiset* already mentioned , which were made in the neighbourhood of Dieppe in 1873 , inasmuch as they directly bear upon the point in question .
He ' using Pettenkofer 's method with aspiration , found that , in air taken in ' the daytime over a field of red clover in the mouth of June , there were only 2 898 vols .
C02 in 10,000 of air present as compared with 2'915 vols .
in air taken simultaneously in the open - and that in the air over a barley field in July , there were only 2'829 vols .
as compared with 2-933 vols .
m that of the open ; or a reduction in the air taken over the crops , in one case of CK)17 vol. of carbonic acid , and in the other of 0-104 vol. m 10,000 of air as compared with that taken in the open .
Nevertheless , in a leafy coppice he obtained what at first sight appeared to be somewhat contradictory results .
In this position the air gave a larger quantity of carbonic acid than that simultaneously taken m the open .
That taken in the coppice was found to contain 2-997 vols .
m 10,000 of air , while that of the open only yielded 2-902 vols .
in the same quantity of air .
The explanation of this seeming anomaly may possibly be found in the fact of a diminished quantity of light existing within the coppice .
For the purpose of the supplementary experiments to which reference has been made , a fine and healthy young geranium plant was selected , due regard being had to the extent of its leaf-surface .
This was suspended day and night alternately in a jar of air sufficiently large to contain it , the mouth being closed as already described by one of Jennings ' capsules .
The times chosen for the experiments were from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for the day , and from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. for the night .

355 was removed from the jar , baryta water was introduced and well shaken , and after standing a sufficient time to effect the absorption of he carbonic acid was titrated in the usual manner .
The results obtained were highly interesting , but it would not , ,t present be prudent to speak of them except in general terms .
It \vi\\ suffice to say that the experiments showed that if the plant did not actually absorb carbonic acid during the day , it exhaled none ; while at night large quantities were so got rid of\#151 ; thus fully substantiating the generally accepted view of the matter in point .
As a mean of seven night experiments made between 23rd August md 29th September , there were 12-18 vols .

The former was at an early period of the experiments , the latter towards their close when the plant had lost a few of its leaves and was beginning to show a diminished activity generally .
Summarising the results contained in this communication , it may be stated\#151 ; 4 ( 1 .

" By Dr. R. Angus Smith , F.R.S. ( Preliminary Notice .
) When examining the air of towns and the effect of smoke and fogs , I have often wished for a very simple chemical method of measuring the total light absorbed by these gases , vapours , and floating solids .
I do not undervalue the work of others , -but I think I have obtained a process promising good results with great simplicity , although I dare say it introduces its own class of difficulties .
