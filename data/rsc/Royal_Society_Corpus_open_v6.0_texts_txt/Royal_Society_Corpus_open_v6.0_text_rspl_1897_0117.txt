The mineral fergusonite , discovered by Hartwall , occurs in felspar aid mica deposits , in the same manner as most of the rare Norwegian ninerals , such as euxenite , orthite , samarskite , \amp ; c. The position in which such minerals are found , embedded in masses of felspar , or \#166 ; ncrusted with mica , leaves the question of their origin an open one .
Whether they are deposited in the felspar by water , or whether they tree contemporaneous with the felspar , is a matter of speculation , fergusonite is a black lustrous mineral , not unlike obsidian in outward appearance , but of considerably higher density .
Seen under he microscope , even with the highest power , there is absolutely no ugn of crystalline structure , though in thin slices the substance s translucent , and transmits yellow-brown light .
It is , however , macrocrystalline , occurring in quadratic sphenoids .
It is quite lomogeneous , and displays no sign of cavities .
Like similar mine-.als , it contains helium , which is expelled on the application of heat .
But this mineral presents a peculiarity , which has led us to publish his note .
When heated to a temperature not exceeding 500 ' or \gt ; 00 ' , it suddenly becomes incandescent , and evolves much of its lelium ; while its density decreases .
The analysis of the mineral was kindly undertaken by Miss Emily Vs ton , to whom we desire to express our indebtedness .
The mineral has jeen previously analysed by Hartwall , its discoverer , and by Weber , , md , for the sake of comparison , we quote the earlier analyses*:\#151 ; Composition of Fergusonite .

Prof. W. Ramsay and Mr. W. M. Travers .
The oxides of niobium and tantalum were converted into double fluorides of these metals with potassium fluoride ; and on examinatior of the crystals under the microscope , they were seen to be almost entbely of one form .
They were easily soluble in water , and , from previous experience with these compounds , we were able to recognise them as potassium niobium oxy-fluoride .
There appears to be hardly any tantalo-fluoride present in the possible mixture .
The uranium dioxide was estimated by heating the mineral with dilute sulphuric acid in a sealed tube , and titrating the dioxide with potassium permanganate .
The trioxide was calculated by difference from the total uranium .
The cerium metals were separated , as usual , bj means of a saturated solution of potassium sulphate .
It is thus seen that fergusonite is mainly a niobate of yttrium containing oxides of uranium , but in no great quantity .
The gases evolved by the incandescence of nearly 5 grams ( 4*852 ; of the mineral , heated in a vacuous tube , had the following compo sition:\#151 ; Per gram of Total gas .

The plan of operation was to burn in xygen a known weight of hydrogen , ascertained by measuring it , nder a small platinum crucible , in a calorimeter .
The rise of tem-erature was noted .
This operation was repeated several times , so s to standardise the calorimeter .
Some grams of mineral were hen placed in the crucible , and the operation was repeated ; the heat volved by the incandescing mineral added itself to that from the lurning hydi-ogen , and the rise of temperature was greater .

In these experiments , a correction was of course introduced for he change of temperature of the calorimeter during the experiment , :ue to the temperature of the surrounding air being higher or lower han that of the calorimeter .
The percentage of helium in the mineral , by weight , is 0"0194 , evolved on incandescence , and on further heating , 0 0132 ; the total percentage is 0"0326 .

O'1069 328 Fergusonite , an Endothermic Mineral .
Various questions are raised by the behaviour of this interestir mineral .
Its evolution of heat , accompanying its parting withelium , suggest the idea that it is a true endothermic compound ( helium .
Had its density , as is the case with alumina , and with otht oxides which rise spontaneously in temperature when heated , h creased instead of decreasing , the evolution of heat might justly ha\ been ascribed to polymerisation .
But an evolution of heat , accon panied by a fall in density , leads to the conjecture that the loss c energy is the result of the loss of helium ; and that , conversely , tl formation of the compound must have been concurrent with a gai of energy .
That the helium is actually in combination , and nc retained in pores in the mineral , is evinced by there being no pore in which the helium might be imprisoned .
Surface-absorption i equally out of the question , for the mineral is compact .
The on remaining possibility is that the helium is in chemical combinatioi And if this is true , then the compound must be an endothermic on\lt ; The question next arises , with what constituent of the mineral i the helium in combination P This question cannot at present b answered .
All that can be said is that the amount of helium doe not appear to depend on the total percentage of uranium , althoug minerals containing uranium usually ( probably always ) contain thi element .
Even in English pitchblende there was found a trace o helium .
And in malacone , a mineral containing no uranium , a trac of helium was found ; also in a specimen of meteoric iron .
Th presence of niobic and tantalic anhydrides , and of the yttrium grou ] of elements , is also favourable to its presence .
But the proportioi between the weight of the helium and that of the other element ; present makes any calculation of the atomic relations between th\lt ; helium and the other elements out of the question .
There is one other substance at least which decreases in density while it evolves heat ; that substance is water , in changing into ice The effect of compressing ice is to lower its melting point , and at thf same time to reduce its heat of fusion .
At a sufficiently high pressuri there would be a continuous transition from ice to water , no heal change taking place during the transition .
Matters would be in \lt ; similar condition to those which accompany the change of a liquu into gas at the critical temperature ; the smallest alteration of temperature would be enough to bring about the change .
In speculating on the origin of such a remarkable compound , is it not allowable to guess that it represents a condition of our earth realised only before solidification had set in ?
That these minerals , containing the rare elements , represent a portion of the interior of our planet ; and ia under the enormous pressure obtaining at the centre , combination with helium was an exothermic event ; and that such compoun s , having by some unexplained accident come to the surface ot ttte Proceedings and List Papers read .
329 ^lobe , where they are no longer exposed to such pressure , they have , n consequence of the change , become endothermic ?
The frequency )f the helium spectrum in the stars , and its presence in the sun , makes it less improbable that some such explanation may lie not far from the truth .
There are at least two other minerals , gadolinite and aeschinite , which exhibit endothermic properties .
But these minerals , instead of decreasing in density on ignition , increase .
The following table shows the gases evolved when they are heated , their densities before and after heating , and the loss of weight which they suffer:\#151 ; Gases evolved .

The fact that these minerals increase in density , and that only one yields helium , places them in a different class from fergusonite .
Moreover , the rise of temperature is not to be compared to that seen with fergnsonite , for the glow is barely visible .
