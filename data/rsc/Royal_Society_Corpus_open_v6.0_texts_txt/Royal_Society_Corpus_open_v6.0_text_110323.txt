" An Investigation of the Powers of the simple Supporters of Combustion to destroy the virulence of Morbid Poisons , and of the poisonous Gases , with a view to ascertain the possibility of controuling the extension of contagious or epidemic Diseases , " by Edward Browne , Esq. F.L.S. Communicated by J. H. Green , Esq. F.R.S. The author , after giving an account of the diversity of opinions entertained with regard to the power of chlorine gas to destroy contagion , states that this gas exerts a similar disinfecting power on the virusof small pox , and mentions the result of some experiments he tried on gonorrheal matter , on which it appeared to effect a similar change .
Various experiments are stated to have been made with iodine and with oxygen , indicating the same disinfecting agency in these substances .
The author conceives that these effects are promoted by the heat communicated to the respired air in the lungs .
He conceives that sea air possesses a disinfecting power , which he explains by supposing that it contains a portion of iodine .
He conjectures , from analogy , that fluorine and bromine may have the same urooertv .
