( Abstract .
) The author discusses the experiments in Dr. W. J. Russell 's paper , * finding from optical examination of the phenomena that the dust falls out from the layer of air creeping along the lower side of the plate , and this dust-free layer of air turns round the edges of the plate and flows over and in contact with its upper surface , so protecting it from any deposit of dust where the current has sufficient horizontal motion ; but deposition takes place where the motion is checked by the currents meeting , or where obstructions cause eddies and break the stream-lines , or by anything that tends to prevent the dustless layer of air flowing over the upper surface of the plate .
