780 PROFESSOR W. M. HICKS OH THE THEORY OF YORTEX RINGS .
In general all these terms are negative .
Hence the core is always stable for pulsations .
Substituting for u , v , w the time of pulsation is given by 1/ \J f / oL3 + ^log H I \#151 ; -2 i+/ *( 2 log x For a coreless ring this is I67 V log ( 81 ) which agrees with the value obtained in \#163 ; 1 .

[ Added April 3 , 1886.\#151 ; The cubic giving the times of vibration of a hollow ring of the same density as the fluid , and with no extra circulations , can be solved .

In 5 13 the effect of the surface velocity in modifiying the normal motion o wave motion has been neglected .
The time of vibration there given therefore wrong .
The correct value is given in the foregoing discussion S 17 .
