" On Simultaneous Variations of the Barometer in India .

[ Plate 1 .
] In this , the first of a proposed series of communications on the barometric variations , it may be useful to recall the views held by men of science as to the causes which produce them .
Since Pascal showed , by the experiments on the Puy de Dome , that the height of the mercury in the tube was lower the higher the station , it was a natural conclusion when the column of mercury fell while the barometer remained in the same place , that this was also due to a diminution of the mass of air above it .
In order to satisfy the facts , afterwards discovered , connected with diurnal and annual variations of atmospheric pressure , hypotheses were proposed as to the modes in which the quantity of gravitating matter pressing on the barometer was increased or diminished .
The actions of currents containing colder and denser or warmer and rarer layers of air , the accumulation of the air thus conveyed over a station , and the overflowing from one station to another were the most obvious methods of explaining the variations of mass .
The fact that cold air enters along the floor of a room while the air heated by the fire ascends the chimney , was a suggestion applied on a large scale to the whole globe .
The polar regions took the place of the door as the source of cold currents , and the tropical regions represented the fireplace ; from this last the air ascended the great terrestrial chimney , passed over more northerly and southerly countries till it descended near the poles , to seek its way back to the place whence it came .
This hypothesis is represented by engravings in many works treating of these variations , and the most ingenious figures are made to cover the earth 's surface , showing how the aerial movements ought to be performed : ought to be , for there is a great want of the facts which should show that the currents really move as they have been represented .
It was found , however , that , even with the aid of these hypothetical movements , one of the most marked and most regular variations of atmospheric pressure could not be explained .
The barometer rises till about 9 or 10 o'clock in the forenoon and evening , and descends till nearly 3 or 4 o'clock , morning and afternoon .
The amounts of these rises and falls are themselves subjected to laws varying with many conditions which no system of ascensional currents can satisfy .
The pressure of the vapour in the air was the only remaining source of variation depending on mass which presented itself ; and a well-conceived hypothesis founded on this element in connexion with aerial currents was supposed to explain the whole phenomena .
When we seek for evidence that the causes proposed are either true or 1876 .

25 sufficient , we fail to find it .
From my own experience within the tropics , where the great diurnal oscillations of the barometer have to he explained by these currents , we may look in vain for any traces of them during weeks of the season when the oscillations are most marked .
At stations near the sea , a slight breeze from the ocean during the day and a like breeze seaward during the night are the only movements perceived for days together ; while at inland stations even these are unfelt , though occasionally local gusts of air sweep in one direction or another .
From the summits of the South-Indian Ghats , where the Coromandel sea borders the eastern and the Malabar Sea the western horizon , clouds could be seen forming over sea and land , which scarcely moved , and disappeared near the places of their birth ; the highest cirri which mottled the sky seemed frequently a fixed fretwork , or one which moved so slowly that the forms had changed before the direction of their motion could be determined .
The clouds which occasionally ascended from the valleys to the mountain-tops remained so balanced in the air that the size of their droplets could be estimated under the object-glass of a microscope .
During these days of calm from sea to sea , the barometer rises and falls , on the highest peaks as on the plains , with the regularity of clockwork .
When we transfer ourselves to the higher latitudes of the British Islands and seek for evidence of these currents , no such regular movements as the hypothesis requires can be observed : the only appearance of the current from the pole is to be found in occasional north-east surface-winds ; the upper currents , as shown by the motion of the cirri , proceed on the average from the west .
Here also the currents fail to follow their supposed courses .
The vapour-pressure supplementary theory fails completely whenever the diurnal variation of vapour-pressure is small compared with that of the barometer ; its apparent success in other cases is a mere arithmetical result which could never support a careful comparison with facts .
When we turn our attention to the changes of barometric height which occur from day to day , the hypothesis of aerial currents seems to have a surer basis .
These variations have been carefully studied by Sir J. Herscbel , Mr. Birt , A. Quetelet , and others .
The first considered that these oscillations " perhaps take their rise in local and temporary causes prevailing over great areas simultaneously , the principal no doubt depending on the prevalence of cloud , or clear sky , or dryness , over great tracts for several days or weeks in succession He also thought that the movements of the atmosphere thus produced should be a cause of winds alternately progressive and retrogressive .
Quetelet , who projected the lines of maximum and minimum pressure on the map of Europe , suggested that the tropical current descending * Report Brit. Assoc. 1803 , p. 99 .
Mr. J. A. Broun on Simultaneous [ May 11 , near the pole formed a kind of cap ( \lt ; c ) to the globe , that this passing towards the equator in all longitudes , or advancing in sectors , would produce the atmospheric waves .
" Les ondes , dans cette hypothese , devraient se propager en meme temps que les courants polaires des poles vers l'equateur , et dans notre hemisphere du nord vers le sud"* .
Yet after a study of the directions of the wind , he concludes , " Les directions des vents n'ont pas des rapports apparents avec les directions des ondes barom etriques " t. It is not necessary to criticise these hypotheses further .
That heated air rises , and that currents of air are associated with great diminutions of atmospheric pressure , are facts which do not suffice to explain the great semidiurnal atmospheric tide , nor the sudden appearance of atmospheric waves with crests reaching from London to Peking and breadths of 1000 miles S. It does not appear impossible , however , that other causes of varying atmospheric pressure may exist than change of the mass of air ; in other words , that the attraction of gravitation may not be the only force concerned in the barometric oscillations : the following results , it appears to me , will require some additional cause for their explanation .
Having found that a marked variation of the horizontal force of the earth 's magnetism is produced by the sun 's rotation on his axis , and that the period of this rotation shown by the magnetic observations was nearly 26 days , I sought whether some effect might not be produced by the same cause on the atmospheric pressure .
A discussion of the amplitudes of the diurnal oscillations of the barometer within the tropics for a period of 26 days gave no sufficiently marked result ; if any such period exists the variation due to it appeared small : a similar discussion of the irregular diurnal oscillations in high latitudes gave a large variation .
The latter movements are evidently connected with the daily changes which have been studied by Herschel and others .
My attention was then directed to the changes of daily mean barometric pressure within the tropics ; and for this investigation , Singapore , a station near the equator , was chosen , where the irregularities due to local causes might be supposed least .
The variations of daily mean pressure there , when projected incurves , were found to resemble those previously obtained by me for the earth 's magnetic force : large oscillations ( for that region ) occupied from 20 to 30 days for some months , then disappeared to reappear later || .

# 27 The discussion of four years ' observations gave for the length of the period 25*86 days , and mean amplitudes of oscillation ( as represented by the term a sin 0 ) between 0*01 and 0*032 inch in different years .
These movements could not be traced in the observations made at Hobarton or Makerstoun , where the daily changes of pressure are increased tenfold by other causes , and probably by other modes of action of the same cause ; but some of them were still found to exist at St. Helena* .
It is not intended at present to enter into the consideration of the 26-day period ( which will show , however , the existence of the other cause of varying pressure alluded to ) , but to examine all the various changes of barometric pressure within a given area and during a limited period of time .
When stations are chosen which lie nearly in the same parallel of latitude or great circle of the sphere , it might be supposed , by the purely gravitational theorist , that , however great the distance , simultaneous variations of pressure are due to the rhythmical expansion and overflow of the atmosphere ; in the following discussion it will be seen that this suggestion cannot be made use of .
Hourly observations of the barometer made at the three following stations during the months of January , February , and March , 1845 , have been employed in this , investigation f:\#151 ; * See 'Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences/ t. 75 , pp. 16 , 121 .
t In the note already cited , which appeared in the 4 Oomptes Rendus , ' the observations for the three months January to April were employed because they showed in the most marked manner the large oscillations of the 26-day period ; the daily means then used were those for the Gottingen astronomical day , given with the printed observations to correspond with the daily means of the magnetic variations .
These means , however , have the disadvantage that one day in every week is made up of the part of the astronomical day occurring on Saturday and the part occurring on Monday .
In the present note the means for the civil days have been computed for Singapore and Madras .
General Boileau has given the means for the civil days in the work cited below .
It is due to the recent publication of his valuable series of observations that I have been able to include so large an area in my investigation .

] Variations of the Barometer in India .
The daily mean height of the barometer , derived from 24 hourly observations for each civil day and for each station , are projected , p. 28 .
The relative positions and approximate distances ( in English miles ) of the three stations are given in the preceding figure .
The first movements to be considered in the figures ( p. 28 ) are those shown by the dotted curves , which represent the mean barometric height for 27 days , including 13 days before and 13 days after each point .
In these means the variations due to the solar rotation and lunar revolution periods may be considered approximately eliminated .
It will be seen that at all the stations the height diminished from the 9th or 10th of January till the beginning of April : this movement is part of the n.rmnn.1 variation , which is most marked at Madras , amounting to 0*3 inch from January to June , while it is only 0*06 inch at Singapore .
At Simla in 1845 the range was about 025 inch , but less regular than at the other stations* .
The dotted curves show movements which appear independent of the regular annual variation , and which are similar at all the stations ; these will require a larger series for their consideration .
When we examine the change of daily mean barometric height , three well-marked movements are to be seen at all the stations .
The first terminates about the end of January , the second in the beginning of March , and the third towards the end of March ; these movements are , I believe , due to the solar rotation , and perhaps the lunar revolution ; they will be considered in another note t. The special object of this discussion is the examination of the changes of pressure from day to day .
It will be seen from the curves , p. 28 , that in general , on whatever day the barometer attains a maximum ( or minimum ) at one station , a maximum ( or minimum ) occurs at the same time at the other stations .
The means , however , for the civil days only are not fitted to show the exact hours of occurrence of the maximum or minimum : to determine these epochs with the greatest possible accuracy , the following method has been adopted .
In order to eliminate the diurnal oscillation , the means of 24 hourly observations are always taken ; but these means have been obtained for the 24 hours , having for their middle hour each hour of the * The annual variation obeys local laws ; considerable differences of barometric height exist for months on two sides of the southern Ghats , where the conditions of temperature and humidity are far from being the same .
The diurnal variation in India , especially the descent from the forenoon maximum to the afternoon minimum , seems to depend , though to a less extent , on the same conditions .
Mr. Buchan has lately shown by the difference of the amplitude of this oscillation for the volcanic region of South Italy and for the Spanish peninsula , that other conditions may exist ( " On the Diurnal Oscillations of the Barometer , " Trans. Roy .

T It may be remarked here that the solar rotation appears to produce also , and more especially in high latitudes , a 13-day period , that represented by the term h sin 29in the function of sines for the 26-day period .

Thus the mean of the 24 hours from midnight of Sunday till midnight of Monday is considered the daily mean at noon of Monday ; that from 1 a.m. of Monday to 1 a.m. of Tuesday is the daily mean at 1 p.m. of Monday ; and so on for each successive hour and for each successive day in the week .
These means before and after each turning-point are projected on an enlarged scale ( p. 37 ) ; and from the calculated quantities we shall now seek the hours for which the daily mean atmospheric pressure was a maximum or minimum at each station .

A faint minimum and following maximum occur January 21-23 at all the stations , and these are followed by a minimum , January 24 , at Simla , which occurs later ( on Sunday ) at the other stations ; these movements and the slight maximum , January 28 , 29 , which could be examined are too small for any certain comparison .

The curve for Singapore is not given , several observations having been omitted on Monday morning ( 24th ) : from a comparison with the observations on Saturday , it does not appear probable that the maximum occurred earlier than 23d 20h .
The general movement at Singapore during this week does not agree with those at the other stations , although a slight minimum at Madras ( 25d 19h ) shortly after the maximum ( fig. 10 ) seems related to a minimum at Singapore ( see 20d 0b , p. 28 ) .

] The minimum preceding this maximum occurred on the Sunday : the barometric fall after the maximum is considerably greater at Simla than at the other stations ; the epoch of maximum is thus accelerated at Simla , where the curve has a much sharper form than at the other stations .

On the whole the number of cases considered is not sufficiently great to give any weight to the conclusion that the maximum or minimum happens oftenest first at any of the stations* .
There were four cases ( 6 , 8 , 14 , and 16 ) in which the maxima occurred at all the three stations within a space of less than 16 hours .

n 2 Mr. J. A. Broun on Simultane [ May 11 , For all the cases , as well as for these , the minima occur more nearly simultaneously at all the stations than the maxima .
When the various local causes ( including the different annual and diurnal variations ) which may accelerate or retard the epochs at different stations are taken into account , we may conclude that the maxima and minima occur nearly simultaneously over the area embraced in this investigation ; and it may be added that they are as nearly simultaneous as the daily mean maxima and minima of the horizontal force of the earth 's magnetism for different stations on the earth 's surface .

) It has been already stated that other causes of change of atmospheric pressure enter in higher latitudes than those here considered ; how far the changes agree with each other , and how far they differ from those in low latitudes , will be the subject of another note .
It was found that at St. Helena the movements now studied were much smaller in general than in India , and sometimes in opposite directions* .
I have , however , chosen the well-marked movement , March 31 to April 5 ( which has nearly the same amplitude at St. Helena as at the Indian stations ) , for comparison .
The 24-hourly means for the four stations are projected , Nos. 4 , 6 , 7 , and 8 , Plate 1 .
The epochs for this movement have been already given ( 17 and 18 ) .
We find from the curve No. 4 , Plate 1 , At St. Helena , the maximum Mar. 31d 5h , the minimum Apr. 3d lh .
Thus the maximum occurred about 3 hours earlier than at Singapore , and the minimum about 6 hours later than at Singapore and Madras by the local hours t. The amplitudes of the different movements have not been taken into consideration ; it is obvious from the curves , p. 28 , that they are on the whole greatest at Simla and least at Singapore .
The barometric falls at the four stations , March 19 to March 24 , are:\#151 ; * Comptes Rendus , t. 75 , p. 10 .
t It should he observed that the hours employed are in all cases the local hours for each station ; and though , on account of the epochs being sometimes earlier and sometimes later at each place , the mean intervals are not affected for the three Indian stations , where the greatest difference of longitude is not 2 hours , yet at St. Helena there is a difference with Singapore of nearly 7 hours ; so that if the time is counted from a common first meridian the intervals would be , for St. Helena , the maximum 4 hours , the minimum 13 hours later than at Singapore .

Perhaps the most remarkable fact brought out in this discussion is the fewness of the cases in which a change of pressure perceived at one station is not felt at the others ; and this holds true for changes of not more than one hundredth of an inch of mercury .
It will also be remarked that though Simla is 7100 feet above the sea , the movements are not diminished by this diminution of the superambient air ; what part the higher latitude may have in this result cannot at present be told .
Remembering the distances of the stations , it will be seen that no theory of propagation of waves by convection-currents or by rarefactions and condensations due to them , founded on the facts as yet known to us , can explain these maxima and minima which occur nearly simul taneously on the level of the sea at Singapore and Madras , at St. Helena 1800 feet and at Simla 7100 feet above the sea-level , under conditions of temperature , humidity , clouds , winds , and weather dissimilar in every respect* .
The resemblance of the variations considered to those of the earth 's magnetic force suggests the idea that they may be due to different modes of action of the same cause .
I have no doubt that by more extended investigations we shall arrive at the explanation of many meteorological phenomena by the action of this cause , which has not hitherto been taken into account .
I shall conclude this note with the words of De Luc in the dedication of his work on the atmosphere to the members of the French Academy of Sciences :\#151 ; " J'aicru m'apercevoir , en etudiant la physique , que , depuis que cette science \amp ; 'est assez etendue pour qu'on ait forme des systemes sur presque tous les objets qu'elle embrasse , deux prejuges contraires nuisoient egale-ment aux progres de la verite ; trop de defiance contre les solutions jugees impossibles , et trop de confiance dans celles qui sont adoptees " t.

] Variations of the Barometer in India .
39 rule of similar movements at all the stations occurred on the 14th and 15th of February .
From 10 a.m. of the 14th to 10 p.m. of the 15th , the mercury fell nearly 0-3 ( three tenths ) of an inch at Simla ; no other fall of nearly equal amount occurred within the same space of time during the three months under consideration ; yet this , the largest of all the atmospheric disturbances , was apparently unfelt at Madras and Singapore .
On examining the weather registers at the three stations , it was found that there was a great thunderstorm at Simla , which began on the horizon on the 14th of February and continued throughout the 15th .
There was nothing unusual at the other stations .
As the daily mean height of the barometer was less on Monday at noon than on Saturday at noon at Simla , the fall of the mercury probably continued during Sunday the 16th .
This great atmospheric disturbance lasting during three days was not propagated even to Madras , the nearest station ; while the smallest of the other movements , some less than 0-01 ( one hundredth ) of an inch , were felt nearly equally well , and nearly simultaneously , at all the three stations .
We see here a distinction between local causes of atmospheric disturbance and that other cause which produces so many nearly simultaneous movements ; it is also easily understood that the larger deviations , of 16 or 24 hours , from absolute simultaneity may be due to similar though much smaller superposed local disturbances , a fact which an examination of the weather registers confirms .
On the other hand , the great continuous fall of the barometer at all the three stations , from the 19th to the 24th March , does not appear to have been accompanied by any other unusual atmospheric change at any one of the three stations .
V. " Supplementary Note on Simultaneous Barometric Variations .
u By J. A. Broun , F.B.S. Received June 20 , 1876 .
[ Plate 1 .
] It has been pointed out in the preceding note that as we leave the tropics and approach the higher latitudes we find greater apparent irregularity in the variations of the barometric height from day to day ; these irregularities are due , I believe , to different causes\#151 ; one being a change in the amount , and even in the direction , of the action of the cause which produces so frequently within the tropics similar and simultaneous movements .
This change depends probably on local conditions which affect the medium through which the actions are produced .
Other causes are to be found which produce variations in the mass of air above the barometer .
It is not to be expected , then , that the agreement shown generally in the barometric movements at the Indian stations would appear were the investigation extended to higher latitudes ; at the j9,7 ?
