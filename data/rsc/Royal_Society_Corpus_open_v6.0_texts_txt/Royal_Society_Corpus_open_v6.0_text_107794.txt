PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS .
Observations of the apparent distances and positions of double and triple Stars , made in the years 1823 , 1824 , and 182 25 together with a re-examination of 36 Stars of the same description , the distances andpositions of which were communicated in a former Memoir .
By JAMES SOUTH , Esq. F. R. S. Read November 17 , 1825 .
HE Royal Society having honoured the observations of s8o double and triple stars made by Mr. HERSCHEL and myself with a place in the Philosophical Transactions , I am induced to offer for the like distinction a fresh series .
The Equatorial Instruments and Micrometers used on the present occasion , being precisely the same as those with which the preceding observations were made , the prefatory matter attached to the former communication , will be generally applicable to this .
As however some of the results have been obtained in England , and others in France , the place where each series of measures was procured , accompanies the date and instrument of observation .
From the srd of April , 1825 , to the demolition of the Observatory at Passy , the micrometer of the Five-feet Equatorial was applied to the Seven-feet Instrument , in order to No. DCCLXXXII .
continued .
The star is a remarkable one ; and from its magnitude and situation in the heavens , not to be confounded with any other .
The proper motions assigned to this star in PIAZZI'S Catalogue , account satisfactorily for the change observed .
They are respectively + o".o8 in R. A. and o'.29 in declination .
These motions , in 44 years , would carry the large star 3".5 to the following , and 12".8 to the south side of its place in 1781 , or , in a direction , making an angle of 740 sf with the parallel .
Supposing then the small star fixed , ' the present angle of position and distance should be 470 nf and 22".5 instead of 480 3 ' and 26".24 which observation makes them , If we consider the uncertainty which necessarily hangs about the earlier distance , depending as it does on a single mean sure , and from the extreme minuteness of the small star , liable easily to an error of 2 or 3 " , it will be allowed that a more satisfactory verification of the proper motion of the one star , and the comparative fixity of the other , could hardly have been looked for .
This , among other similar instances will serve to show the advantage which may be taken of the measures of double stars in ' all researches relating to the proper motions of the stars .
This star appears to be a fit object for the investigation of parallax .

By this change they stand in order,92 , 157 , 1,81 , 327 , 413 , 513 , and 787 ; the commonly used power being 18t : a rigorous examination assured me , that the value of the one micrometer , was also the value of the other .
In the subsequent pages will be found observations of about i6o double and triple stars , hitherto ( as far as I know ) undiscovered : their apparent right ascensions and declinations are , I hope , generally accurate to the nearest minute : and should occasionally a greater error be detected , some indulgence will I trust be extended to me , for they were generally found at a considerable distance from the meridian , when extreme unsteadiness of the stars , and unwillingness to quit my observatory , rendered sweeping for new double stars my only mode of passing the night in it : as however they have been found on subsequent evenings from the data here given , no difficulty in identifying them , can reasonably be expected .
In the former Paper , A7 double and triple stars were selected as entitled to peculiar notice , these it was my inten ; tion to have subjected individually to a rigid investigation ; owing-however .
to the almost.unprecedented bad weather of the last autumnal and winteri months , so only of them could be re-measured ; and the observations , which are here sub.joined.as an Appendix , although.not.so complete* as I could have wished , will still I hope be deemed not unimportant .
The arrangement is somewhat different from that pursued on the former occasion : instead of individual measures being No. VIII .

When this star was observed in Blackman-street , in 1824 , and again at this place in January of the present year , I regarded it as anew double star , and registered the observations of it as such ; a comparison however of the results with the .
measures of C Cancri , leaves no room to doubt that the two stars are identical .
Our former measures were Position 68§ 17 ' sf ; Distance 6".241 ; Epoch 1822.14 .
Observations however which immediately follow , show that the larger star is itself double ; hence some suspicion as to the accuracy of these and of former measures will naturally arise , Passy ; April 3 , 1825 ; Seven-feet Equatorial .

The eye-pieces adapted to the micrometer hitherto used with this instrument being inadequate to communicate to the telescope sufficient magnifying power to enable me to procuire measures of this interesting close double star , I applied the micrometer of the Five-feet Equatorial , * which I had fortunately brought with me from England : the powers thus obtained are 92 , 157 , 181 , 327 , 413 , 513 and 787 .

The angle thus obtained may be liable to an error of one or two degrees , for I see the large star unquestionably elongated ; but the eye-piece now in use is the deepest magnifier which is adapted to this micrometer , and it is inadequate to separate the stars sufficiently to enable me to procure measures of them .
At the time of perceiving the star elongated , I was unaware that it had been observed by Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL as a close double star , as also that Mr. HERSCHEL and myself , when we observed it in England as double of the 3rd class , had noted that , " it is not to be seen triple , although beautifully defined and round .

Note .
The observations of A C , when the star A was only seen as a single star , are rejected .
This star presents the hitherto unique combination of three individuals , forming , if not a system connected by the agency of attractive forces , at least one in which all the parts are in a state of relative motion .
To begin with the two nearer stars A and ; B. Sir W. HERSCHEL'S measure of their position Nov. 28 , 1781 ( 1781.90 ) was 860 32 ' nf and it will be remarked , that a position so nearly perpendicular to the diurnal motion carries in some measure its own verification with it , as not liable to gross error .
This4 differs no less than 540 23 ' from the present angle in the same quadrant giving a mean annual motion of + I'.2 54 or direct ( uf sp ) .
The distance remains as it was , so close as to be barely separable .
In 1802 it was so also ; but at that time , though observed by No. VIII .

Sir W. HERSCHEL , no measures could be procured , which is much to be regretted .
The evidence for the motion of the more distant star C will be found in the Philosophical Transactions 1824 , Part III .
p. l 15- .
The change of quadrant the great amount of the motion ( 230 42 ' in 404 years ) and the circumstance of an error to that amount , or anything like it , being perfectly impossible from the considerable distance of the stars ; add , too , the regular gradations by which the change appears , from several intervening observations , to have taken place ; all these considerations place the motion of the distant star beyond dispute , and the present measures confirm it , the angle 670 55 ' Sf compared with that of 1822 ( 680 17 ' sf ) indicating a motion still in the same direction .
Its amount , it is true , is only _ 22 ' instead of 10 '4 ' which the assigned velocity would give , but this is as near a coincidence as we have a right to expect in such small quantities .
If this be really a TERNARY system connected by the mutual attraction of its parts , its perturbations will present one of the most intricate problems in physical astronomy .
The difficulty will not be diminished by the circumstance of the rotations of the two small stars about the large one being ( apparently at least ) performed in opposite directions , being the reverse of what obtains in our planetary system , or by that of the deviations of the relative angular velocities from KEPLER'S law , being such as to indicate either great masses in all the three bodies , great excentricities in their orbits , or a different law of gravity from what obtains in our system .

The earlier measures of this star compared with the present offer a discordance .
In 1 783 the position was stated at 8§ 24 ' n P ; in i 804 , by a mean of two measures agreeing well , 200 34 ' np .
It is therefore probable that the first measure might be in error , which from the extreme closeness of the stars might well happen .
It should be re-examined some years hence .

If we recollect that the angle of 1822 is deduced from a mean of only 8 individual measures , it will not appear surprising that an error of a degree or somewhat more should have been committed in it .
In such a case the coincidence of directions is in itself a confirmation as good as we have a right to look for .

Nothing can be more satisfactory than the confirmation these observations afford of the rapid motion ascribed to this remarkable star .
In the interval of 1.97 year since the Epoch 182s.29 the motion has amounted to no less than 130 ay't in the direction np sf , or 7.0925 per annum .
The sudden diminution of velocity is however not confirmed .
Indeed it rested on too short an interval , and on too few ob- , servations ( for such very close stars ) to deserve great confidence .
We cannot do better than recommend this star for the next io or 20 years to the constant and careful measurement of astronomers ; nor can we too strongly inculcate here the indispensable necessity of multiplying extremely their measures of position , to eliminate those errors of judgment to which the most experienced observers are liable in measures of this sort .
This done , there is no doubt of our arriving at a precise knowledge of the elements and position of the orbit described by each about their common centre of gravity ; and the question of the extension or non-extension of the NEWTONIAN law of gravity to the sidereal heavensthe next great step which physical astronomy has yet to make will be effectually decided .

R. A. 17h 410 ; Decl. 260 i8 ' S. 36 Ophiuchi ; H. and S. e. continued In the former Paper the attention of astronomers was particularly directed to this star , on account of a considerable proper motion which it was supposed to have , in common with a very distant star 3o Scorpii ; and as the point is a very interesting one , the preceding observations were made , with a view of placing the matter beyond doubt : a few comments upon them will perhaps be not without their use .
A 38 Ophiuchi B.A 36 Ophiuchi C0 so Scorpii In the above diagram , the close stars of AB of 36 Ophiuchi are represented relatively to the star C , to 3o Scorpii , and to AB of 38 Ophiuchi , as seen in the telescope ; C preceding A of 36 to the north , and A of 38 following it to the south , First , as it regards Declination .
If any proper motion of 36 exist in this direction , ( supposing the star C at rest ) the effect of it will be to increase , or diminish No. XXIV .

the difference of declination of AC ; and should A of 38 be fixed , the difference of declination of A of 36 , and A of 38 , will also be increased or diminished .
By this mode of observing we have two chances of detecting proper motion , each of which will afford a verofcation of the other ; for suppose the star A of 36 Ophiuchi to have a motion toward the south , say at the rate of one second per annum , then will the difference of declination between it and the star C to the north of it , be increased annually by one second ; but that which increased the difference of declination between these two stars , should diminish the difference of declination between A of 36 , and A of 38 Ophiuchi ; and if our observations be correct , the increase of difference on the one hand , should be exactly equal to the decrease of it , on the other ; and vice versa , should the proper motion of A of 36 , carry it toward the north .
Secondly , in Right Ascension .
Suppose the proper motion of A of 36 to be toward the west annually one second , the result will be , to lessen the difference of right ascension of it , and of the preceding star C , and at the same time to augment the difference of right ascension between A of 36 , and A of 38 ; and , as before , the decrease in the one instance , should be equalled by the increase in the other ; and if the proper motion of A of 36 , take an easterly direction , it will be detected by consequences opposite to those just described , but offering similar verifications .

In the case of 61 Cygni , by following a similar mode of observing , ( but using six stars of comparison instead of two , ) I satisfied myself in a very few months , of the enormous proper motion of that extraordinary double star .
To those who may feel disposed thus to attack proper motion , I would hint , how indispensable it is , that their Equatorial should be well clamped , and that they should wait during the observations of difference of declination , till the earth 's diurnal motion bring each of the following stars , opposite that part of the wire where the bisection of the first star was made ; the results will then be charged with no instrumental error , which it is in their power to avoid : the observations also should be conducted as nearly on the meridtan as possible .
When the above was written , I was not aware that the star 38 Ophiuchi had been observed since the time of FLAMSTEED ; on examining however PIAZZI'S catalogue , I find that it stands there under the name of 31 Scorpii , and that its place has been determined by 19 observations of that emiinent astronomer ; perhaps therefore some light may at the present time , be thrown upon the subject under consideration ; but some corrections will be needed by our observations , to render them comparable with those , to which we are alluding .
The star s6 Ophiuchi is composed of two stars of nearly equal magnitudes , and distant from each other 5".200 ; whe- .
there BRADLEY'S instruments showed it double , does not appear ; nor from PJAzzI 's catalogue , does it seem that he saw it otherwise than as a single star ; hence it is fair to No. XXIV .

suppose , that the star was by one and the other observed as single ; our observations therefore must be corrected by half the difference of declination , and by half the difference of right ascension , which with the preceding distance , and position 410 32 ' will be 1".724 in declination , and 1".946 on the parallel , equal to o".l17 of right ascension in time .
For the star 38 Ophiuchi no correction of this sort will be required : its smaller star was certainly neither seen by BRADLEY nor by PIAZZI ; and its magnitude , even were it at the time closer than it now is , would not sensibly alter the apparent centre of the disc of A of 38 .
But the differences of declination observed by us are uncorrected for refraction : the necessary equations being applied , we get , Diff. of decl .
of A of 36 Ophiuchi &amp; of 3oScorpii 3 ' 2".403 ... .
* ... . .
&amp; A of 38 Ophiuchi 5 ' 25".764 ; and when the corrections to reduce these results to observations of the centre of the two stars of 36 Ophiuchi are applied , the quantities become S ' 4"/ .127 and 5 ' 24".04o for the differences of declination ; and for differences of right ascension ( in time ) 5o2".,591 and 2 ' 1 1".905 respectively .
Now by BESSEL'S proper motion , * the difference of declination of 36 Ophiuchi and of 3o Scorpii , Epoch i 825.57 , should be 3 ' 4".930 , differing with our determination only 8-tenths of a second : hence in declination , the two stars have either the same , or no proper motion .
But BESSEL does not give the proper motion in right ascension , for it appears that BRADLEYf did not observe the No. XXIV .

transits of both stars ; PIAZZI however , by a comparison of his own observations with those of preceding astronomers , assigns to them quantities , which for 1i825.57 would give difference of R. A. ( in time ) 52'.50 , agreeing with our determination to 9-hundredths of a second ; hence also in R. A. as well as in declination , they have , if any , the same proper motion .
If however the proper motions attributed to them be correct , and if none be enjoyed by A of 38 Ophiuchi , the difference of declination between s6 and 38 should be 5 ' 23".073,.~~ ~ ~~~~ ~~ 2 ... 7 .
differing not one second from our determination : and if the proper motion in right ascension attributed to 36 be correct ( the star s8 being fixed ) , the difference of R. A. ( in time ) between them should be 2 ' I 1".76 only fourteen hundredths of a second , at variance with our observations ; quantities which may be very fairly attributed to errors of observation , Hence it follows , that the two stars 36 Ophiuchi and so Scorpii , although distant from each other more than 12 minutes , are journeying together through space ; and that the annual proper motions ( I".o7h6 and i " .
i5 toward the south , and o".59 and o".58 toward the west ) , assigned to them , are true .
From the above investigation we also learn , that the star 38 Ophiuchi has no sensible proper motion ; consequently the -observed increase of distance between it and the small star , * if it exist , must probably be sought for , in some peculiarity of the latter .
mass of his observations , ( copied from the original possessed by the University of Oxford , ) by GAEL MORRIS , and now in the library of the Royal Society : that any observation of this illustrious Astronomer , ( ' le Modele des Observateurs " of La PLACE , and whose observations , ( in the emphatic language of the same Philosopher ) constitute " l'6poque d'oui lon doit partir maintenant , dans les recherches delicates de la science , " should be recorded only in perishing manuscript , is to be hoped in these enlightened times , will not remain long an object of regret to Astronomers .

this star can hardly be doubted .
But as it is inconsistent with the laws 'of central forces that this should take place without a corresponding increase of distance ( for the angular velocity is inversely as the square of the distance in the apparent as well as in the real orbit , whatever be its position with regard to the line of sight ) , it becomes necessary to examine more minutely into the distances at the different epochs .
It will be observed , however , that in all the interval from 178i to 181g we find no measure of the distance , and that the maximum of angular velocity must have taken place somewhere in this interval .
( See Phil. Trans. 1824 .

) In such a case we must recur to estimations in diameters , though necessarily less to be depended on than positive measures .
On reexamining Sir W. HIERSCHEL'S MSS .
, we fortunately find the following observations , which throw considerable light on this point and in some measure supply the deficiency of measures .
It will be recollected that his measures of distance are always supposed to include both diameters of the stars measured .

" From all these observations , it is clear that the interval between the stars about the year i780 -could not be less than 2 diameters , and by a mean of all the estimations , must have been about this quantity , or rather more than less .
The small star being taken at 0.6 of the diameter of the large , the distance of their centres must have been 2.8 D , and the distance , including the diameters , 3.6 D. Now as this distance by the mean of all the measures , was 4".492 , we have D= 1".25 and 2.8 Di= s".5oo .

Excessively difficult .
The small star only visible by glimpses ; observations made on the meridian , with 787 ; the extreme unsteadiness of the stars renders it impossible to procure any measures of distance , and those of position must be received with caution .
The unfavourableness of the weather has not allowed in to procure other measures of this difficult star .
Sloane-street , March 18 , 1826 .
The position April 4 , 1783 , was measured with a 2o-feet reflector , 12 inches aperture , and found to be 20§ 54 ' sf .
The change is very great , no less than 430 2o ' in 42.8 years , or almost precisely a degree per annum .
There can be little doubt , therefore , that this very curious double star is entitled to a place among the revolving stars or Binary systems .
The uncertainty of thfe present observations , arising from the difficulty of the star , and the unfavourable weather , might render us cautious in admitting this conclusion ; but a series of well-agreeing measures by Mr. STRUVE , On four nights , from Feb. 25 , to April 4 , 1825 , which give a mean result 630,7 sf sufficiently establish the fact .
These interesting observations are contained in a letter from Mr. STRUVE , dated April 21 , 1825 .

presented to public view , the mean result of each night 's work is here noted ; but as the number of -observations , and the differences between the extreme measures of each series are also specified , it is hoped that the alteration will be satisfactory to the Society .
As in these observations I have not had the powerful aid of Mr. HERSCHEL , it has been my endeavour as far as possible to compensate for the loss ; hence , instead of taking ten individual observations both of distance and position on the same night , and thereby considering the star measured , I have divided the work generally assigned to each star between two evenings , the better to correct any error which unfavourable state of atmosphere , inaccurate micrometrical readings , or particular bias of judgment might entail ; and when the results have exhibited discordances greater than seemed justified by the difficulty of the observations , a third , or even a fourth night 's determination has been found useful .
To the observations contained in the former Memoir , peculiar interest was attached by the comparison of them with the results obtained by other astronomers ; of which by far the most important were those derived from the labours of Sir W. HERSCHEL ; but as the observations which are recorded in the Philosophical Transactions are ( from circumstances before * adverted to ) of themselves inadequate to furnish the final results arrived at by that illustrious astronomer , it is grateful to me , and doubtless will also be to the Society , that the kindness of Mr. HERSCHEL has supplied the necessary information ; thus the existence of fresh connected systems is substantiated , and adegree of present importance conferred on the following pages , which he alone could bestow .

I have said that the accompanying observations were made partly at home , and partly abroad ; the latter remind me of a pleasing duty : the Board of Longitude of Paris , and Government of France , have claims upon me too great to remain unnoticed , the one for having requested , and the other for having acceded to me the permission of introducing into France , free of all duty ( sans conditions ) , whatever astronomical instruments I thought proper ; t and so effectual were the arrangements of the Director General of the No. CCCCXLIII .

Between this night and the zznd of October , when the observatory at Passy was broken up , unfavourableness of the weather prevented me getting a second series of observations .
axis ; the cones however of the horizontal axis being firmly soldered and pinned to a shoulder projecting from the centre-piece , are not separable from it : the level of the axis is supplied with a silver scale , each division of which is equivalent to one second .
In the focus of the object-glass are seven equi-distant wires , the equatorial interval between any two of them being about so seconds of time : on each side of the meridian wire , and at equal distances from it , are two others , so placed that the pole star shall pass from it to either of them in two minutes , for a purpose explained in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society ( vide Vol. I. page 238 ) ; applicable to each side plate , is an apparatus for regulating the quantity of light projected from the lamp upon the wires .
The side plates are similar to those belonging to my Four-feet Transit Circle , and which ( .[ believe ) were described in REES'S Encyclopxdia , when the instrument was the property of Mr. GnOOMBRIDGE .
A second level for the horizontal axis , a spare one for the altitude circle , and a second wireplate furnished with spiders ' lines are at hand , and are ready for immediate use , should accident sustained by any of the first set , render them unfit for service-a reserve which no traveller should neglect ; lest also any of the screws by which the various parts of the instrument are connected should be lost , a few additional ones placed in the box are not , ( as I have found by experience ) , without their use .
The object-glass was made by Mr. TULLEY , and originally belonged to the Westbury Circle : its clear aperture is 2.7 inches , its focal length is 43 inches ; with a magnifying power of 300 it defines oa Lyrie , Arcturus and Aldebaran , perfectly sharp and round ; separates very distinctly the close stars of 7 Leonis , ?
Bootis , and Orionis ; whilst with i So ( the commonly used power ) under favourable circumstances , the small star south preceding Polaris , is sufficiently visible to enable the observer to take its transit , with considerable precision .
The instrument is mounted on stone piers , and has retained its meridian position extremely well ; fifteen months ' experience has shown , thatwhilst the maximum error , to which the mean of a single series of observations of any star south of the zenith of my observatory , does not exceed 4-tenths of a second , often , very often , the result of a single set will not deviate z-tenths from the true right ascension .
When the pole star is steady , its transit over the wire may be determined to one second .
Thus much for its utility .
As for its portability : the transverse axis , the telescope tubes , and the altitude circle , are included in a box 29 inches long , 14 inches broad , and 61 inches deep .
The three levels , the spare wire-plate , the light regulating apparatus , the lamp , &amp;c. are lodged in a case 271 inches in length , iII in breadth , and 31 in depth .
The side plates , with their appendages of nuts , screws , &amp;c. are contained in a box 13I4 inches long , 7 inches broad , and 71 inches deep ; arid the tout ensemble is well accomu modated under the seat of my travelling carriage .

In 1781 the angle was 5s0,8S uf .

It is clear therefore that no very sensible motion can exist in this star .
According to the proper motions set down in PIAzz 's catalogue , the angle of positlon should be liable to a slow change in the direction np sf or _ , amounting however to a quantity hardly cognizable in 4o years .
( H. ) Douanes , Mons. le Marquis de VAULCHIER , and so extreme the politeness of the principal and subordinate officers of the Customs at Calais , that the importation and exportation of them , were affairs , not of difficulty , but of gratification .
It is needless to state , that on the establishment of an observatory by a private individual in a foreign country , many difficulties must be encountered .
To Mons. BENJAMIN DELESSERT , whose liberality in promoting every thing which has science for its aim knows no bounds , I stand indebted , amongst other things , for whatever comfort my observatory afforded .
From the members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris I uniformly received every possible attention , whilst to Messrs. DE LA PLACE , ARAGO , BOUVARD , HUMBOLDT , and POISSON , a residence of fifteen months has placed me under obligations of no common order : they were received with PRIDE , and are remembered with GRATITUDE .
The Society have now before them , with few exceptions , a re-examination of all the identified double and triple stars described by Sir W. HERSCHEL in the Philosophical Transactions ; with the sentiments therefore of the illustrious author of the Mecanique Cedeste I will conclude- , " Had the labours of Sir W. HERSCHEL been confined to this department of astronomy , the discoveries he has made in it would have alone conferred upon him an imperishable name .

The total change of angle is 40 14 ' , a considerable quantity for mere error of observation in a star of the sd class , and which ( when the observation of 1 802 iS considered ) , may lead to a suspicion of a very slow relative motion .
