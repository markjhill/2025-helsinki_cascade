the zone of friction , which were nearly great circles , and of nearly uniform brightness all round .
In this case the cathodic portions of the zone which is being rubbed are those distant from the magnet poles .
The cathode rays experience not a longitudinal but a transverse magnetic force , and are curled up into small circles , so as to strike the walls again near their point of origin , and produce phosphorescence there .
It is true that at any one moment only a portion of the zone is under excitation , but each portion is excited successively , and the phosphorescence lasts long enough to produce sensible uniformity of illumination .
The Origin of Thermal Ionisation from Carbon .
By J. N. Pring , D.Sc .
( Communicated by Prof. E. Rutherford , F.R.S. Received July 26 , 1913 .
) It has been shown by the present writer in conjunction with A. Parker* that the ionisation which is produced by carbon at high temperatures , and in presence of gases at low pressures , is reduced to a much smaller order of magnitude by eliminating impurities from the carbon , and by exhausting to a high degree the containing vessel .
The results threw considerable doubt on the whole basis of the theory of electronic emission from incandescent solids .
According to this theory , f the ionisation produced by elements at high temperatures is due to the escape of free electrons which pass into the surrounding space on account of the kinetic energy acquired at the high temperature .
It was shown , however , in the above work that in the case of carbon this ionisation is probably related to some chemical action or some intermediate effect exerted by the gas in contact with the solid .
Fredenhagen , J who made measurements with sodium and potassium in a high vacuum , came to similar conclusions with regard to the validity of the above theory of electronic emission .

The Origin of Thermal Ionisation from Carbon .
345 carbon in gases at atmospheric pressure , conclude that an important part is played by the presence of impurities .
The ionisation from metals was also considered to be largely affected by the presence of occluded gases .
Richardson , * in discussing the results of Pring and Parker , admits that the ionisation originally measured by him in the case of carbon was largely influenced by the presence of impurities leading to chemical reaction .
The result of this was to lead to an abnormally high value being given to the constant A in the expression A(fie~Q28 , which was deduced to represent , on the basis of the thermionic theory , the relation between ionisation and temperature .
By revising the constants from which the values in this formula are derived , the formula was made to follow much more closely the experimental results of Pring and Parker , though it still gave values considerably higher than the latter , and did not agree with the observed influence of temperature .
It was , however , maintained that the fundamental theory put forward by Richardson , accounting for the relation between ionisation and temperature , was not disturbed .
Scope of Experiments .
The aim of the present work was to see if any direct electronic emission can be attributed to incandescent carbon , when the large ionisation effects , which were found in the earlier work to be due to chemical action , were more completely removed .
For this purpose the purification of the carbon and the exhaustion of the surrounding vessel were carried out more extensively than before , and the effect on the ionisation at definite temperatures was carefully measured .
A series of experiments was also made in which small quantities of the highly purified gases\#151 ; helium , argon , nitrogen , hydrogen , carbon monoxide , and carbon dioxide\#151 ; were admitted to the vessel at known pressures , to see if any relation could be traced between the ionisation and the relative chemical action of these gases on carbon .
Apparatus.\#151 ; The apparatus used was of the same type as that in the earlier work .
The carbon was mounted in water-cooled holders , as shown in fig. 1 .
The copper tubes ( A , A ) served for the introduction of the current used to heat the carbon .
Air-tighc connections with the side tubes of the flask were made at b , b , by means of soft wax .
The carbon used was in the form of a rod , 8 cm .
long and 0'5 cm .
diameter , and contained a hollow space in the centre , 1-5 mm. diameter .

carefully purified before compressing in the rod form .
Further purification was carried out in this work , after mounting in the apparatus , by heating for long intervals at very low pressures .
The carbon rod had a resistance of Earth Fig. 1 .
about 0'25 ohm , and by passing a current of 80 amperes at 20 volts a temperature of 1850 ' was attained when the pressure was below 0005 mm. For the ionisation measurements , one of the terminals ( D ) was connected to earth , and a source of positive potential applied to ' the wire E , to which was connected a small disc .
This disc was placed at a distance of about 8 cm .
from the heated carbon .
Since a potential of 220 volts was applied in the case of all comparative measurements , it could be assumed that the greater part of the ions produced in the vessel would be collected .
A number of experiments were made with a vessel which was coated with silver on the inside , and the metal lining wras then used as the anode .
After heating for some time , the conductivity became very uncertain , so that this method was abandoned in favour of the disc anode .
A complete collection of the ions was not essential in these measurements , as the ionisation currents varied over such a large range under changing conditions .
It became only necessary to consider the order of magnitude in interpreting the results .
The exhaustion of the vessel was effected by means of a Gaede mercury pump connected to the apparatus at M. The higher pressure side of this pump was exhausted by a Sprengel pump .
In addition to this , the charcoal tube H , which was cooled by liquid air , was also applied for the final exhaustion of the main apparatus .
After removal of the liquid air , the charcoal was always disconnected from the main apparatus by means of the The Origin of Thermal Ionisation from Carbon .
347 tap K , and before each experiment was exhausted continuously for at least 12 hours , by means of the Sprengel pump connected to L , while the temperature was kept at about 400 ' by a surrounding electric furnace .
A Topler pump of large capacity at F was used for preliminary exhaustions and for the removal of gases which it was desired to collect .
This pump also served as a pressure gauge , by using the scale placed behind the capillary at N. The column of gas in the capillary was arrested and measured when it stood at a height of 70 cm .
above the reservoir R. The calibration showed that a column 1 cm , high corresponded to a pressure in the apparatus of ( M)03 mm. This enabled a measurement to be made within 0-0001 mm. in the absence of condensable gases .
The U-tubes ( P , P ) , which were surrounded by liquid air during the experiments , were used to condense mercury vapour in order to protect the charcoal from this metal , and also in order to condense any impurities arising from the grease of the taps .
A spectrum tube connected at S was used for the purpose of spectroscopic examination of the gases present , and to obtain an idea of the pressure when below the limits of measurement by the mercury gauge .
The degree of exhaustion obtained with this apparatus when the carbon was cold could not be measured by any of the methods available .
No trace of discharge was visible in the spectrum tube on connecting with an induction coil , which , in air , gave a 5-inch spark .
However , even after prolonged use of the apparatus , detectable quantities of gas always appeared when the temperature of the carbon was taken above about 1300 ' .
The lowest pressure obtained , when the carbon was at 1900 ' , was estimated by the mercury gauge at 0-0002 mm. , but in most cases it could not be reduced below 0'001 mm. at this temperature .
Temperature Readings.\#151 ; These were made with a Wanner optical pyrometer sighted directly on to the heated carbon .
The pyrometer was first carefully calibrated and standardised by comparing with a thermo-junction pyrometer , and at the melting points of pure platinum and iridium.* It was ascertained in some earlier measurements that the absorption of the light by the clean glass of the vessel did not cause an error exceeding 10 ' in the measurement .
On account of the possibility of error in hurried individual measurements , a large number of readings were first taken at different temperatures , and at a pressure of 0-001 cm .
, and the values were plotted ( watts against temperature ) in the form of a curve .
Since readings of the current and voltage were made in every case , this * See Pring , ' Lab .

Dr. J. N. Pring .
curve was referred to in all subsequent readings , and in many cases a direct temperature reading during the actual experiment was avoided altogether .
The curve was determined after the carbon showed no further change in resistance with continued heating .
By comparing the values obtained by the different methods used for calibrating the pyrometer , and by considering the degree within which carbon radiates as a black body , * it was found that an accuracy to within 25 ' could he relied on at 1300 ' in the temperature measurements and within about 60 ' at 2000 ' .
Measurement of Ionisation .
The source of positive potential , usually 210-220 volts , which connected with the anode wire E , was first passed through a water resistance of about 1 megohm .
For the measurement of the larger ionisation currents a milli-ammeter or galvanometer was inserted in the circuit at T. For the smaller currents , a Dolezalek electrometer was used in parallel with standard capacities ranging from 0'001 to 0'3 microfarad .
The wire leading from the electrometer was encased in an insulated metal tube , which , together with a metal cylinder placed around the lower part of the glass vessel at Y , a narrow guard-ring of tin foil at X , and metal plates placed under the galvanometer and electrometer , was connected to the source of positive potential , in order to prevent any leak from the insulated anode to earth .
When using the full potential a voltmeter was connected to the circuit immediately before and after each series of measurements .
In order to ascertain the actual potential applied in the cases where larger ionisation currents were obtained , and where a fall of potential through the water resistance would result , the voltmeter was connected permanently between the earth wire and the further side of the galvanometer .
A number of additional readings were taken at a lower potential by using a source of 100 volts , and cutting down by means of the resistance .
The Dolezalek electrometer gave a scale deflection of 1 cm .
per minute when used with 0001 mf .
capacity , with a current of 3 x 10"12 ampere .
No detectable leak occurred through the apparatus when cold , and by applying an additional potential of 2 volts by means of a cell , on to the insulated electrometer wire , no appreciable leak to any of the surrounding metal guards could be observed .
Since the surface of the carbon was 13 sq .
cm .
all the ionisation values below have been divided by this figure , in order to give the current per square centimetre of surface .

The Origin of Thermal Ionisation from Carbon .
349 The experiments recorded in this paper were carried out after the carbon had been subjected to prolonged heating in a high vacuum , and was not capable of further purification by this treatment . .
Preparation of Gases .
Nitrogen.\#151 ; The gas was prepared by heating ammonium nitrite , storing in a gas-holder , and then after drying was passed through molten phosphorus and through a spiral cooled by liquid air , and then into a vessel containing mercury .
This gas was admitted in small quantities to the main apparatus through the tap Z ( fig. 1 ) by first filling the small space between this and a second tap connecting with the gas-holder .
The results of the ionisation measurements are given in Table I , and are plotted in the form of curves for the different temperatures ( fig. 2 ) .
The ordinates represent the logarithm of the ionisation and the abscissae the pressure .
Hydrogen.\#151 ; This was prepared by electrolysing baryta , and , after passing over heated platinised asbestos , calcium chloride , and phosphorus pentoxide , the gas was absorbed by palladium foil contained in a glass tube and warmed by an electric furnace .
One end of the tube connected directly to the main apparatus at Z ( fig. 1 ) , and when the palladium was cold , the end leading to the generator was closed by means of a tap and the tube exhausted by means of the Topler pump , and finally by the Gaede pump on the main apparatus .
By then warming the palladium and regulating the connecting taps , definite quantities of hydrogen were admitted to the reaction vessel .
The results of the ionisation measurements obtained are shown in Table II , and in fig. 3 .
Carbon Monoxide.\#151 ; This was prepared by the action of formic acid on heated sulphuric acid , and , after passing through a concentrated potassium hydrate solution , was admitted to a thoroughly exhausted vessel of 50 c.c. capacity , which was fitted with a tap and contained some phosphorus pent-oxide .
The gas was allowed to remain in this tube for 15 hours , and then admitted to the reaction vessel through the tap Z , as in the case of the nitrogen .
In all these experiments where gases were admitted to the reaction vessel , the U-tube P would remove any condensable impurity .
The results of these measurements are shown in Table III and in fig. 4 , as before .
Carbon Dioxide.\#151 ; This was obtained from a cylinder of commercial gas , and , after storing in a bulb , was admitted directly into the apparatus .
The measurements made with this are shown in Table IIIa , and also on fig. 4 .
Helium.\#151 ; This was extracted from samarskite , and , after removal of water Dr. J. N. Pring .
vapour and most of the hydrogen by admitting to charcoal cooled by liquid air , the gas was passed over heated copper oxide , and then stored in a tube .
Before admitting to the apparatus through the tube L the gas was exposed for a few minutes each in succession to the two charcoal tubes Y and H , which were cooled by liquid air .
Readings with this gas are given in Table IV and fig. 5 .
Argon.\#151 ; This was prepared by passing atmospheric nitrogen over finely powdered calcium carbide mixed with a small quantity of calcium chloride and heated in an iron pipe fitted with water-cooled jackets at the ends .
The unabsorbed gas was then passed several times over calcium in a smaller tube , over heated copper oxide , and then dried by phosphorus pentoxide .
The gas was then finally purified by exposing to an electrical discharge in a tube in which the cathode consisted of a liquid alloy of sodium and potassium ( 70 per cent , potassium ) .
The tube arranged for this had a capacity of about 100 c.c. Two right angle bends were provided , and platinum wires sealed in the walls , one at the end making connection with the liquid alloy , and the other joining on to an aluminium electrode at a distance of 8 cm .
from the lower electrode .
A trial was first made with this tube by admitting nitrogen to a pressure of 1 cm .
and connecting the tube to a small pressure gauge .
After passing the discharge for 8 minutes this gas was so completely absorbed as to stop the discharge .
The impure argon was then admitted to a pressure of about 1 cm .
, and the discharge passed for a few hours .
A quantity of this gas was then admitted to a carefully exhausted spectrum tube , and examined spectroscopically .
No nitrogen could be detected , though hydrogen lines were present , presumably arising from the electrodes .
The argon was admitted to the apparatus by connecting the tube to Z. The readings obtained with this gas are shown in Table V and in fig. 6 .
In the curves for argon and helium , the ordinates , on account of their lower value , are plotted on twice the scale used for the other gases .
The values of all the readings taken at the equilibrium stages are entered in the tables , and these have been plotted on the diagrams in every case when the value came within the range of the axes , and when the potential employed had been 210-220 .
Procedure of Experiment .
The apparatus was first evacuated as described above , and after any admission of gas containing moisture , was first allowed to stand several days in presence of phosphorus pentoxide , after carefully exhausting .
During this interval no rise of pressure could , as a rule , be observed .
The Origin of Thermal Ionisation from Carbon .
351 If the carbon was maintained at 1300 ' and the taps leading to the pumps were closed , the rise of pressure in 5 minutes was usually too small to measure , but above this temperature it became important , amounting at 1800 ' to about 0003 mm. in five minutes .
It would be expected that some of the gas arising in these cases would result from the decomposition of traces of hydrocarbons given from the wax seals used to hold the water-cooled tubes .
In the experiments which were conducted at the lowest pressures , the exhaustion of the vessel was continued throughout the measurement .
When using purified gases , a small quantity of the gas was admitted after first closing the taps leading to the pumps , adjusting the temperature of the carbon by means of rheostats , and completing all the electrical connections on the high potential circuit .
Readings of the ionisation current were then made by means of the electrometer or galvanometer , immediately after the admission of the gas , and then at definite intervals .
These were followed by readings of the pressure and temperature as described above .
Comparative experiments were conducted from time to time by exhausting the vessel , closing all taps , and noticing the increase of ionisation with time due to the increase of pressure which gradually took place at the high temperatures .

These results , which are plotted in the form of curves in fig. 2 , show the very large part played by the pressure of the surrounding gas .
At low pressures , however , the ionisation approaches a limiting value for each temperature .
As discussed below , this is probably due to the occlusion of residual gas .

In the case of all figures given in the above tables the readings represent the results obtained when the ionisation current had become stationary After a change of pressure of gas in the vessel , an appreciable interval was usually necessary before the ionisation assumed a constant value .
This time effect is shown in experiments tabulated below .
The important result is at once clear from these tables , that whereas with the gases which are known to react with carbon , a very large effect is exerted by the pressure of the gas on the ionisation , while with the inert gases the ionisation shows comparatively very little change over a large range of pressure , and gives values of a much smaller order of magnitude than the other gases .
Dr. J. N. Pring .
In the ease of all gases , at the minimum pressures , the ionisation converges to a limiting value determined only by the temperature .
This is probably due to the influence of residual impurities retained by the carbon .

Discussion of Results .
A. Relation between Ionisation and Pressure .
It is seen from Table VI above that , on admitting gas at a higher pressure during an experiment , a certain interval was necessary before the maximum of ionisation was attained .
With the inert gases ( helium and argon ) , which gave the lowest ionisation , this time effect could not be observed , but with the other gases it increased in proportion to their final ionisation current .
Thus , at about 1200 ' , hydrogen gave a maximum value in about 30 seconds , carbon monoxide in about 3 minutes , and carbon dioxide not until after 5 minutes .
If equilibrium was reached at any given pressure , and the pressure was then lowered , at first only a slight decrease in the ionisation followed , and finally , in some cases , the current would suddenly fall to a lower value .
The high ionisation obtained at low pressures could also , in some cases , be suddenly lowered by momentarily interrupting the potential applied to the circuit .
In many cases , however , the reduction could only be brought about by taking the temperature considerably higher\#151 ; while the pressure was low\#151 ; and then lowering again .
This time lag or hysteresis in the ionisation has been observed by other workers , and it is quite apparent from these results that it is caused mainly by an occlusion of the gas in the carbon .
The gas is only very slowly evolved on heating , and probably it cannot be entirely eliminated .

have not been entered in the above Tables ( I to V ) on account of their uncertain value .
B. Influence of Potential on Ionisation Currents .
It is seen that in the experiments conducted at low pressures , the potential difference used to collect the ionisation played a comparatively unimportant rdle .
If the fundamental ionisation arising from the carbon was largely increased by ionisation by collision in the gas , a very large change of current with potential would have been expected .
Hence the great differences observed when using different gases cannot be explained by the known differences in ionic mobilities .
C. Effect of Different Gases on the Magnitude of the Ionisation .
The results of the measurements with different gases given in Tables I-Y show that the ionisation from carbon increases in these cases in the following order:\#151 ; ' Aroon'1/ nitr'gen\gt ; hydrogen , carbon monoxide , and carbon dioxide .
This order is the same as for the known chemical activity between carbon and these gases .
While the first two are chemically inert , nitrogen reacts to a small degree to form cyanogen , * and with hydrogen to form small quantities of methane , ethylene , and acetylene , f while carbon monoxide gives a small quantity of carbon dioxide and carbon , j and carbon dioxide reacts rapidly to give carbon monoxide .
With the inert gases the increase of ionisation with pressure is seen to be very slight indeed when compared with the active gases .
It is seen from the curves ( figs. 2 to 6 ) that the ionisation does not converge to zero at the lowest pressures , but rather assumes a constant value for each temperature .
This is what would be expected in the light of the above phenomena of absorption .
At the lowest pressures the amount of gas held in the carbon would always appear to correspond to a higher pressure on the outside , and it was indeed found that the higher the temperature to which the carbon had been previously heated , while keeping the pressure constant\#151 ; and thus the more completely the occluded gas had been driven out\#151 ; the lower the final value to which the ionisation was reduced at that pressure .

The Origin of Thermal Ionisation from Carbon .
admitting and withdrawing one of the inert gases , the ionisation from the heated carbon was also considerably lowered , but could not be reduced beyond a certain limit , as would be expected from the impossibility of excluding completely extraneous gas when working at the high temperatures .
In fig. 7 curves are plotted to show the ionisation produced by the different gases when at a constant pressure of 0-005 mm. The ordinates are expressed in amperes multiplied by 10~12 and the abscissae represent the temperatures .

These values are respectively about 107 and 10u times smaller than those originally estimated by Richardson ( loc.tit .
) , and which formed the basis of the theory of thermionic emissivity , and are about 105 times smaller than the values recalculated by Richardson { loc. tit.)after the revision of the constants of his formula .
Summary and Conclusions .
The ionisation produced by carbon at high temperatures , which hitherto has been generally held to be mainly due to direct electronic emission , was found in some earlier work to be dependent to a very high degree on the presence of gas and other impurities in contact with the carbon .
The conclusion then drawn , that the large currents hitherto observed were derived from some reaction between the carbon and the gas , has been confirmed in the present work .
It has been shown that a still further large reduction in the ionisation is brought about by eliminating further the absorbed gases from the carbon .
By admitting known amounts of different pure gases to the carbon the ionisation produced was found to be directly proportional to the known chemical activity of these gases .
The progress of absorption of the gas by the carbon and its evolution could , moreover , be traced by the ionisation currents .
It is clear from these results that the thermal ionisation ordinarily obsei'ved with carbon is to be attributed to chemical reaction between the cai'bon and the surrounding gas .
While it is difficult to prove definitely that there is no electronic emission from the heated carbon itself , it is obvious that it is exceedingly small compared with ionisation which can be attributed to ordinary chemical change .
The small residual currents which are observed in high vacua after prolonged heating are not greater than would be anticipated whexx taking into account the great difficulty of x'enxoving the last traces of gas .
I wish to thank Prof. Rutherford for the kind interest he has taken in the progress of this work .
