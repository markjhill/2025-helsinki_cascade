] Prof. J. Tyndall on Heat as a Germicide .
gations of this kind , to be acquainted with some of the causes of failure which I have met with , and to know how small the difference of the variations probably is when we ascend to a considerable height in the atmosphere .
The results I have obtained from two instruments placed in positions so greatly different as those of the cloudy mountain-peak and the sunny plain , will also show the degree of accuracy attainable when the requisite precautions are taken , and accurate methods of correction and reduction have been employed .

" On Heat as a Germicide when Discontinuously Applied " By John Tyndall , F.R.S. Received February 14 , 1877 .
Boyal Institution , Feb. 14th , 1877# My dead , Huxley , \#151 ; In my " Preliminary Note , " communicated to the Royal Society on the 18th of January , various infusions were referred to as manifesting an astonishing resistance to sterilization by heat .
This resistance was traced to its source ; and I have been since informed that you were good enough to express at the time a very favourable opinion as to the significance and value of the results indicated .
It will , I think , now interest you to learn that the most obstinate of the infusions referred to in the " Note " have been since rendered tractable by the application of very simple means .
Following up the plain suggestions of the germ theory , I have been able , even in the midst of a virulently infective atmosphere , to sterilize all the infusions by a temperature lower than that of boiling water .
It is known that the prolonged application of a low temperature is often equivalent to the brief application of a higher one ; and you may therefore be disposed to conclude that in the experiments here referred to I have substituted time for intensity .
This , however , is not the case .
The result depends solely upon the manner in which the heat is applied .
For example , I boil an infusion for fifteen minutes , expose it to a temperature of 90 ' Fahr. , and find it twenty-four hours afterwards swarming with life .
IvSubmit a second sample of the same infusion to a temperature lower than that of boiling water for five minutes , and it is rendered permanently barren .
The secret of success here is an open one .
I have already referred to .
the period of latency which precedes the clouding of infusions with visible Bacteria .
During this period the germs are being prepared for their emergence into the finished organism .
They reach the end of this period of preparation successively\#151 ; the period of latency of any germ depending upon its condition as regards dryness and induration .
This , then , is my mode of proceeding:\#151 ; Before the latent period of any of the germs has been completed ( say a few hours after the preparation of the infusion ) , I subject it for a brief interval to a temperature which may be Presents .
[ Feb. 1 , under that of boiling water .
Such softened and vivified germs as are on the point of passing into active life are thereby killed ; others not yet softened remain intact .
I repeat this process well within the interval necessary for the most advanced of those others to finish their period of latency .
The number of undestroyed germs is further diminished by this second heating .
After a number of repetitions , which varies with the character of the germs , the infusion , however obstinate , is completely sterilized .
The periods of heating need not exceed a fraction of a minute in duration .
Sum them up in the case of an infusion which they have perfectly sterilized ; they amount altogether to , say , five minutes .
Boil another sample of the same infusion continuously for fifteen or even sixty minutes , you fail to sterilize it , although the temperature is higher and its time of application more than tenfold that which , discontinously applied , infallibly produces barrenness .
In a few weeks I hope to bring this entire subject under the notice of the Royal Society ; meanwhile , if you think it would interest them , I should be glad if you would communicate to the Fellows this general statement of the most recent results of experiment .
Believe me , Ever faithfully yours , John Tyndall .
