) In a previous communication* it was shown that the fermentation of glucose by yeast-juice is dependent upon the presence of a dialysable substance which is not destroyed by heat .
This substance is contained in the active yeast-juice prepared by disintegrating living yeast , and , -therefore , most probably exists in the yeast cell side by side with the zymase .
The occurrence of an analogous activating substance has been described by Magnusf in the case of the lipase of the liver .
He observed that the active juice of this organ became inactive when dialysed into water , but regained its activity when the dialysate or boiled liver juice was added .
The term coferment was suggested by BertrandJ to denote substances of this kind , and he applied it in two instances\#151 ; to the calcium salt , which he considered was necessary for the action of pectase on pecten substances , and to the manganese of laccase , which he supposed to be essential for the activity of this enzyme .
Although not entirely satisfactory , this term may be provisionally applied to activating substances such as those present in liver lipase and yeast-juice , until further knowledge of their nature and function permits of a more rational terminology .
( 1 ) Preparation of the Inactive Residue from Yeast-juice in the Dry State .
In the previous communication S it was shown that when yeast-juice is filtered through a Martin gelatin filter , both the residue and the filtrate are incapable of fermenting sugar , whereas a mixture of the two produces a vigorous fermentation .
In carrying out the experiments which established this result , the residue left on the filter was always dissolved in water as soon as the filtration and washing were completed , and the activity of the solution was examined without delay .
It has since been found possible to obtain the inactive * * Roy .

[ June 14 residue in the solid form , in which condition it retains its properties for a considerable time .
This is accomplished by spreading the sticky mass left on the filter over a large watch-glass , and exposing it over sulphuric acid in a vacuum .
The residue dries up in a few hours to a brittle mass , which is converted by grinding into a light yellow powder .
Complete removal of the coferment is generally not effected by a single filtration , and the powder prepared as above is usually found to be slightly active .
A completely inactive residue may , however , be obtained by redissolving in water and repeating the filtration and desiccation .
The powder prepared in this way and dried over sulphuric acid in a vacuum for 15 hours only loses its potential activity slowly .
The following examples show the original inactivity of the powder , its fermentative power in presence of boiled yeast-juice , and the loss of this power with lapse of time:\#151 ; I. 200 c.c. of yeast-juice were filtered in quantities of 50 c.c. through Martin filters and yielded 17'6 grammes of dry solid .
This was dissolved in 50 c.c. of water and again filtered , yielding 9'2 grammes of dry solid residue .
The following experiments were then made a.t 26 ' in presence of toluene:\#151 ; 1 .
March 8 , 1906 .
One gramme of dry residue was dissolved in 15 c.c. of water and 1*5 grammes glucose added .
No evolution of carbon dioxide was observed ; 12 c.c. of boiled yeast-juice containing T2 grammes of glucose were then added .
Fermentation at once commenced , and 108 c.c. of carbon dioxide were evolved in 20 hours , when the experiment was discontinued .

Two months later ( May 18 , 1906 ) a similar experiment was carried out , a sample of the same boiled yeast-juice being employed .
As before , 1 gramme of the residue dissolved in sugar solution was quite inactive .
On the addition of the boiled juice fermentation at once commenced ; the rate was , however , only about one-third of that attained in the previous experiment , and fermentation ceased when only 42 c.c. of carbon dioxide had been evolved .
Although the fermentation in the first experiment was not continued to the end , the comparison shows clearly that the potential activity of the dry residue had greatly diminished .

In the case of another sample of dry residue , with which two similar experiments were made with the interval of a week , it was found that in the first experiment 364 c.c. of carbon dioxide were produced , and in the second 344 c.c. , a difference of only about 5*5 per cent. 1906 .

371 ( 2 ) Disappearance of the Coferment from Yeast juice during Fermentation and Autolysis .
When a small amount of boiled yeast-juice is added to a solution of the inactive residue in 10-per-cent , glucose solution , fermentation commences and continues for a period which varies with the amount added .
The cessation of fermentation appears in such a case to be due to some change in the coferment , since the addition of a further quantity of boiled yeast-juice again sets up fermentation , and if the quantity of boiled juice added on each occasion be small enough , this process can be repeated a third time .
The following experiments , made at 26 ' in presence of toluene , illustrate this point:\#151 ; 1 .
One gramme of dry inactive residue was dissolved , in 15 c.c. of 10-per-cent , glucose solution , and three quantities of 3 c.c. of boiled juice were then successively added , the fermentation being allowed to come to an end before each addition .

One instance of this was quoted in our previous communication , * and many more have been observed , some of which are tabulated below .

[ June 14 , The cessation of fermentation in any particular mixture of inactive residue and coferment may , therefore , be due to the disappearance either of ferment or coferment from the liquid .
If the amount of coferment present be relatively small , it is the first to disappear , and fermentation can then only be renewed- by the addition of a further quantity , whilst the addition of more ferment produces no effect .
If , on the other hand , the amount of coferment be relatively large , the inverse is true ; the ferment is the first to disappear , and fermentation can only be renewed by the addition of more ferment , a further quantity of coferment producing no effect .
This is illustrated by the following experiment made at 26':\#151 ; Two solutions were made up , each containing 0'5 gramme of dry inactive residue +10 c.c. of 10-per-cent , glucose solution and toluene , and to each of these 2 c.c. of boiled juice containing 10 per cent , glucose were added .
As soon as fermentation had ceased , 0-5 gramme of dry residue in 10 c.c. of glucose solution was added to one solution ( a ) , and 2 c.c. of boiled juice diluted to 10 c.c. with glucose solution to the other Two other solutions were also prepared , each containing 0'4 gramme of the same dry inactive residue +10 c.c. of 10-per-cent , glucose solution + toluene , and 25 c.c. of the same boiled juice containing glucose were added to each .
As soon as fermentation had ceased , 0+ gramme of residue dissolved in 10 c.c. of glucose solution was added to one and 10 c.c. of boiled juice containing glucose to the other ( d ) .

The following experiments were made to ascertain approximately the rate at which the coferment disappears from yeast-juice both in the absence and presence of added glucose .
For this purpose a quantity of yeast-juice was preserved at 25 ' in presence of toluene , and samples were removed , boiled and filtered , at the commencement of the incubation and after various intervals .
In one case a parallel experiment was made with yeast-juice to which 10 grammes of glucose per 100 c.c. had been added .
The filtrates were then all rendered neutral to litmus and tested with equal quantities of an inactive 1906 .

297 " It appears from this that the coferment disappears from the juice less rapidly in the presence of glucose than in its absence .
In yeast-juice to which no addition of glucose has been made the coferment usually disappears at 26 ' in about 48 hours ; in the presence of 10 per cent , of glucose coferment was still present at the end of four days , although only in a small amount .
( The observation that the fermentation after four days ' incubation is somewhat greater than that given after two days is probably to be explained by the presence of a greater amount of phosphate in the juice which had been digested for the longer period .
) 4 .
Soluble Phosphates do not Pender the Inactive Pesidue Capable of Fermenting * Glucose .
In view of the fact that soluble phosphates , as described in the previous communication , exert a remarkable effect on the fermentation of glucose by yeast-juice , experiments were made to ascertain whether the addition of a soluble phosphate to a solution of the inactive residue in glucose is sufficient Dr. A. Harden and Mr. W. J. Young .
[ Junje 14 , to set tip fermentation .
All the attempts hitherto made to effect this have yielded entirely negative results , although both the kind of phosphate and the amount added have been varied .
Dipotassium hydrogen phosphate , a mixture of this with the dihydrogen phosphate , disodium hydrogen phosphate , diammonium hydrogen phosphate , microsmic salt , and a mixed phosphate of potassium and magnesium obtained by boiling a solution of potassium dihydrogen phosphate with magnesium carbonate , were employed , all of which are capable of producing the characteristic effect of phosphates on the fermentation of glucose by yeast-j uice .
Although these substances did not set up fermentation when added to an inactive filtered residue and glucose , they did not affect the potential activity of the residue .
This is evident from the fact that the subsequent addition of boiled juice produced an immediate fermentation .
In every case the solution of the phosphate was saturated with carbon dioxide at 26 ' and added to the solution of the inactive residue in glucose solution also saturated with carbon dioxide at 26 ' , and in no case was any evolution of gas observed after the cessation of the slight disturbance which inevitably occurs when the solutions are mixed .
The phosphate solutions were all of 3/ 10 molar strength , with the exception of the mixed phosphate of magnesium and potassium , 5 c.c. of which yielded 01594 gramme Mg2P207# In those cases in which the residue employed was slightly active , incubation was continued until all fermentation had ceased before the phosphate solution was added , and the amount of carbon dioxide evolved in this preliminary period is given in the table .
The amount of glucose , both in the solution of the residue and in that of the phosphate , was throughout 10 grammes to 100 .

experiments oh the disappearance of the coferment from yeast-juice , that boiled autolysed juice does not set up fermentation in a mixture of the inactive residue with glucose , although it itself contains a large amount of phosphate precipitable by magnesia mixture .

They also indicate that substances , which , like phosphates , increase the total fermentation produced by yeast-juice , are not necessarily capable of setting up fermentation when added to a mixture of inactive residue and glucose .
Further experiments are in progress with the hope of obtaining more information on these points .
