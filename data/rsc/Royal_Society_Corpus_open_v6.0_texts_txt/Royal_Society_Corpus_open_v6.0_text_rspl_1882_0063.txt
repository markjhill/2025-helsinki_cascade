( Abstract .
) The experiments described in the present paper were carried out during the spring and summer months of the present year , at the Cavendish Laboratory , and are divided into three distinct series .
In the first and second series , the induction coils were situated nearly in the plane of the revolving disk , as in Lorentz 's original use of the method ; the difference between the two series relating only to the speed of rotation , which was varied in the proportion of 10 : 16 .
The third series presents a point of novelty , in that the induction coils were* separated from the disk to such a distance as to render the accuracy of the result practically independent of the mean radius of the coils .
# J The small resistance , traversed by the battery current , to which the terminals of the galvanometer branch are connected , was obtained indirectly by a method of shunting .
Thus in the first series , the principal part of the battery current passed on one side through two unit coils , placed in multiple arc , and equivalent to and only a comparatively small remainder through a second branch , composed of two coils in series , of values 10 and y\j- .
The terminals of the galvanometer branch were connected with the extremities of the TV\#187 ; and the difference of potentials between them , due to the primary current , was thus rednced to that which would be required to drive t e current through a resistance of siro ' From the first series\#151 ; 1 B.A. unit=*98674 x 109 C.G.S. 1883 .

The very close accordance between the result of the present investigation , and that obtained by the'method of the revolving coil ( .98651 ) , and by Glazebrook ( *98665 ) , using another method again , leads us to hope that no error of importance can have escaped detection .
The Appendix is devoted to a record of experiments having for object the determination of the absolute pitch of a certain tuning-fork , which has served as the standard of time throughout all our work upon this subject .
It is believed that the method employed is worthy of attention , and may be useful to other physicists .

( Abstract .
) At present nothing is known of the development of these remarkable fishes , but their structure in the adult state is of great interest , and as the other related type\#151 ; the Lamprey\#151 ; has had great attention given to it lately , in most of its stages , I have thought it would be profitable to anatomists to have a detailed account of the skeleton in these lower and less known types .
I received several specimens of the adult Hag-fish ( Myxine ) from my friends the late Professor Rolleston , F.R.S. , and Mr. Frank Buckland ; for fine specimens of the gigantic type ( Bdellostoma ) I am indebted to Professor Ray Lankester , F.R.S. My guide in this work has been the excellent and most accurate Johannes Muller\#151 ; his four memoirs ( well known to anatomists ) op .
