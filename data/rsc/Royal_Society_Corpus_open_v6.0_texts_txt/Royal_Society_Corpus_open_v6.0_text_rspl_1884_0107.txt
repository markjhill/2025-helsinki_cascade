The former took chlorophyll that had become brown on standing , and acting on it with zinc powder .obtained a body yielding green solutions , which he took to be regenerated chlorophyll .
Tschirch acted on Hoppe-Seyler 's chlorophyllan with zinc powder and observed the same phenomena , the conclusion at which he arrived being the same , viz. , that chlorophyll is reproduced from chlorophyllan by reduction .
It is probable , however , that what they obtained was in reality a zinc compound of phyllocyanin , and would have been formed just as well by using zinc oxide .
Chlorophyllan is probably an impure substance containing some fatty acid along with phyllocyanin , so that by the action of zinc oxide it may yield a compound similar to those above mentioned .
The experiment was tried with the crude product obtained by passing hydrochloric acid gas into a solution of chlorophyll .
Some of this was dissolved in alcohol , and the solution was boiled with zinc oxide , when it gradually became of a bright green like a solution of chlorophyll , but its spectrum differed , being identical with that of the zinc compounds obtained directly from phyllocyanin .

" On the Electric Resistance of a New Alloy named Platinoid .
" By J. T. Bottomley , M.A. , F.R.S.E. Communicated by Sir W. Thomson .
Received May 5 , 1885 .

In the course of a series of experiments on the electric resistance of various metals and alloys , and in particular on the variation of the electric resistance of these metals and alloys with temperature , I have examined a new alloy ( called by the inventor platinoid ) , which has turned out to have important properties .
This alloy is the invention of Mr. F. W. Martino , of Sheffield ; and I have to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Martino for having provided me with specimens of his new alloy and given me information regarding it ; and for having supplied me with wires specially drawn down to the finer gauges for my experiments .
The inventor , searching experimentally for a means of rendering tarnishable metals and alloys less tarnishable , had satisfied himself that the addition of pure metallic tungsten imparted greater density to alloys , and likewise less tendency to oxidation .
Having found a mode of combining a small quantity of tungsten with copper , nickel , and zinc , he produced a white alloy resembling the alloys of silver , which proved very little tarnishable under atmospheric 1885.1 Electric Resistance of Platinoid .
influences .
Accordingly he patented the process , and registered the illoy under the name platinoid .
Platinoid is practically German silver with the addition of a small percentage ( 1 or 2 per cent. ) of metallic tungsten .
The tungsten is tdded in the form of phosphide of tungsten , a considerable percentage \gt ; f which is in the first place fused with a portion of the copper .
The hickel is then added ; and then the zinc and the remainder of the .opper .
The mixture requires to be re-fused more than once , and during theprocess the phosphorus and a considerable portion of the r lungsten originally added is removed as scoriae .
In the end there is obtained a beautiful white alloy , which is platinoid .
When polished the alloy is scarcely distinguishable in appearance from silver .
To test the quality claimed for it as to being untarnishable , I have for gome weeks been keeping ornamental specimens lying exposed to the ordinary town atmosphere ; and I have satisfied myself that the alloy has a very remarkable power of resisting the tarnishing influence of the air of a large town .
It is , however , with the electric resistance of platinoid that I have chiefly interested myself .
German silver wire has proved of great use in the construction of galvanometer coils and of resistance coils , on account of two important properties , viz. , its very high resistance , and the smallness of the variation of its resistance with change of temperature .
Both these properties are possessed in a still higher degree by platinoid alloy .
The resistance of German silver differs considerably in different specimens .
It is commonly stated to be 21T7xlO-6 B.A. ohms between opposite faces of a centimetre cube at 0'C.* ; or , reducing to legal ohms , 20935 X10-6 legal ohms between the opposite faces of a centimetre cube .
The table on page 342 shows the resistance of a number of specimens of platinoid wire .
It appears from these results that the specific resistance of platinoid is about one and a half times that of German silver .
The experiments on the variation of resistance of platinoid with temperature were carried on in the following way .
The specimen of | platinoid to be tested was wound on a wooden bobbin , on the surface 1 of which a screw had been cut , and the spires of the helix were kept separate by lying between the threads of the screw .
This coil was immersed in a bath of oil , and was connected in series with a known wire of German silver , the temperature of which was kept constant , and with a single Daniell 's cell .
The differences of potential between the two ends of the platinoid wire and the two ends of the German silver wire were determined by applying the electrodes of a high-resistance * Given by Prof. Fleeming Jenkin , F.R.S. , as expressing the results of Matthies-sen 's experiments .

The ratio of the differences of potential is the same as the ratio of the resistances of the two wires .
This method of comparing the resistance of an unknown wire with that of a known wire gives admirable results , and I have recently made great use of it .
In the following table is shown the ratio of the resistances of a specimen of platinoid wire at different temperatures to its resistance at zero .
The wire was the same as that specified as No. 20 in the table of resistances .
The length of the wire experimented on was about four-fifths of a metre .
The only trouble in the experiment was the keeping the oil-bath , which was filled with linseed oil , thoroughly stirred , and of uniform temperature throughout .

A second wire tested very carefully in a similar way gave for this average percentage variation between 0 ' and 100 ' , 0*022 per degree , with a steadily increasing rate of variation from the beginning .
To compare this increase in resistance due to increase of tempera-Iture with that observed in other metals and alloys , I find that the percentage increase of resistance for 1 ' 0 .
at 20 ' C. for copper is 0*388 , platinum-silver alloy 0*031 , gold-silver alloy 0*065 , and for 1 German silver 0*044 .
These numbers were obtained by Matthiessen in the course of his experiments for finding a suitable metal or alloy for the purpose of constructing the British Association standards of electric resistance .
It appears that the variation of resistance of platinoid with temperature is very much smaller than the smallest observed for any of the metals and alloys then examined .
Addition to the above Paper .
Received May 12 , 1885 .
I have now ( May 7th , 1885 ) obtained some information as to the mechanical properties of platinoid wire .
I have determined the modulus of rigidity of a wire of the substance , a portion of the wire marked A in the preceding paper being used for the purpose .
This wire is a little larger than No. 24 wire of the Board of Trade Standard wire gauge , and has a diameter of 0*0595 cm .
To determine the modulus of rigidity a cylindrical ring vibrator was attached by a cross-bar to the lower end of a length of the wire , the upper end being fixed by soldering to a brass plate , which was screwed to a beam in the roof of the laboratory .
The moment of inertia of the cylindrical vibrator and cross-bar was ascertained ; and the torsional vibrations of the vibrator hung by the wire were counted , and the period determined.* From this , and the dimensions of the wire , the modulus of rigidity is calculated .
The following are the particulars of the experiment : \#151 ; Length of wire used ( Z ) ... ... ... ... . .
