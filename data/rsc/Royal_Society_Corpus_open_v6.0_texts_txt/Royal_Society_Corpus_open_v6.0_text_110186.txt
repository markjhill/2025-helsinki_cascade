] The author , after noticing the peculiarities discovered by Walsh in the electricity of the Torpedo , and the opinion of Cavendish , that it resembles the action of an electrical battery weakly charged , adverts to the conjecture of Volta , who considered it as similar to that of the galvanic pile .
Being on the coast of the Mediterranean in 1814 and 1815 , the author , desirous of ascertaining the justness of Volta 's comparison , passed the shocks given by living torpedos through the interrupted circuit made by silver wire through water , but could not perceive the slightest decomposition of that fluid ; the same shocks made to pass through a fine silver wire , less than one thousandth of an inch in diameter , did not produce ignition .
Volta , to whom the author communicated the results of these experiments , considered the conditions of the organs of the torpedo to be best represented by a pile , of which the fluid substance was a very imperJ55 feet conductor , such as honey , and which , though it communicated weak shocks , yet did not decompose water .
The author also ascertained that the electrical shocks of the torpedo , even when powerful , produced no sensible effect on an extremely delicate magnetic electrometer .
He explains these negative results by supposing that the motion of the electricity in the torpedinal organ is in no measurable time , and wants that continuity of current requisite for the production of magnetic effects .
