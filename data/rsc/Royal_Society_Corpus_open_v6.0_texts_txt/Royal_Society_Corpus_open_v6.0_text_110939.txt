" Extracts of Letters from Captain Williams , first Assistant to the Commissioner of Arracan , and from Ensign Haukeu and Mr. Howe , Marine Assistant Commissioner , giving details of a curious phenomenon seen at sea off Ryook Phyoo .
" Communicated by Viscount Mahon , F.R.S. , Pres. S.A. The appearance in question , seen between five and six o'clock in the evening of the 2nd of December 1845 , was that of a large flame far out at sea , flickering several times for fifteen and twenty minutes , and suddenly ceasing .
It was conjectured to have been either a large ship on fire , or a volcanic eruption ; but no positive data exist for determining the question .
