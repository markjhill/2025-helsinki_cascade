I. " On the Expansion of Wood by Heat .
" By J. P. JOULE , LL. D. , F.R.S. &amp;c. Received November 5 , 1857 .
In pursuing the researches of which abstracts have been given in the 'Proceedings ' for January 29 and June 18 , the author found that the heat evolved by compressing wood , cut either in or across the direction of the grain , was nearly that due to the application to the particular case of Professor Thomson 's formula .
Exact agreement could not be expected , on account of the discordant results arrived at by different experimenters on the expansion of wood .
On investigating the subject , the author finds that the expansion of wood cut in the direction of the grain , is greatly influenced by the tension to which it is exposed , as well as by its humidity .
A rod of wellseasoned and dried bay-wood , gths of an inch in diameter , and exposed to the tension of 26 lbs. , gave an expansion of '00000461 per degree Centigrade , but when a weight of 426 lbs. was hung to it , its coefficient of expansion was increased to '00000566 .
In conformity with this result , it was found that the elasticity of the rod was considerably diminished by an increase of its temperature .
On investigating the effect of humidity , the author found that it occasioned a diminution in the expansibility by heat .
After the rod of bay-wood with which the above experiments were made had been immersed in water until it had taken up 150 grains , making its total weight 882 grs. , its expansion with a tension of 26 lbs. was found to be only '000000436 .
Experiments with a rod of deal 33 inches long , and weighing when dried 425 grs. , gave similar results .
Its expansion when dry , with 26 lbs. tension , was -00000428 , and with 226 lbs. '00000438 ; but when made to absorb water , its coefficient of expansion gradually decreased , until , when it weighed 874 grs. , indicating an absorption of 449 grs. of water , expansion by heat ceased altogether , and , on the contrary , a contraction by heat equal to '000000636 was experienced .
