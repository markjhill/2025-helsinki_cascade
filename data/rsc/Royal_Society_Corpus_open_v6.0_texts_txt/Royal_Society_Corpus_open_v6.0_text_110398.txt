A paper was then read , entitled , " On the Theory of the Moon .
" By J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal Society .
The author , adverting to the appearance of M. Plana 's admirable work entitled Theory du Mouvement de la Lune , enters into a com ?
parison of the analytical methods employed by that author and M. Damoiseau , and points out some differences in the numerical values of the coefflcients of some of the arguments in the expression for the true longitude of the moon in terms of her mean longitude .
He then prosecutes the subject by a series of analytical investigations , which arenotsusceptible of abridgement , but from which he obtains formula ?
which do not quite agree with those of M. Plana .
