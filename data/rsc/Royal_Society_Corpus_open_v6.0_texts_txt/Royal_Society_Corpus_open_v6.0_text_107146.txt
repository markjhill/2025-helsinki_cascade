IN analytical investigation , two important objects present them-c selves : the concise and unambiguous expression of the condi. .
-~~~~~~~~ tions of a problem in algebraic language ; and the reduction of such expression into forms commxiodious for arithmetical computation .
If the introduction of the new calculi , as they have been called , has extended the bounds of science , it has enormously increased its difficulties , in their number and magnitude .
The differential forms that can be completely integrated , occur in few problems only , and those of small moment .
In physical astronomy , the investigations give rise to , differential expressions , which call forth all the resources of the analytic art , even for their approximate integration .
For the integration of differential expressions that , by the process of taking the differential , can be derived from no finite algebraic form , recourse is had to infinite series : thus , if the expression be dx.f x , and there is no quantity Fx , such that dx.fx =-d ( Fx ) : fx is put =f((x a ) + a ) -f ( x -a)a +Df ( x-a)-a + Df ( Xa ) a , + &amp; C. and fdx.fx fdx f ( x-a ) +fdx .
Df ( x--a ) J Jdx .
DJ fXa ) &amp;c. or , puttingfx =f ( a +x -a ) , the integral of dx.fx is calculated from the series fdx.fa .
( x a ) +fdx , .
Dfa .
( x a ) + &amp;c. But , although the integrals of many expressions can thus .
be , exhibited , yet such series are useless for the purpose of arithmetical computation , except their terms continually decrease , and except the limits of the ratio of the decrease of the terms can be determined ; and the invention of series adapted to arithmetical computation , has not been the least of the difficulties encountered by modern analysts .
Although the differential expressions that admnit no finite integration have not been reduced into classes , yet there are some , from their simplicity and frequent occurrence in analytical investigation , more conspicuously known and attentively considx dx dered : such are the expressions -x , and the computation of their integrals , in other words , is the determination of the logarithms of numbers , and the lengths of circular arcs .
The necessity of calculating the integrals of expressions 'such dx dx as -T+ ' V('2 ) ' must soon have obtruded itself on the attention dx dx of the early analysts : for several expressions , as _ &amp;c. apparently dissimilar , are easily reduced d dx to the forms ; and besides , the difficulty of inteI +S V1-X grating a variety of forms , is soon reduced to that of the integraedx dx dx tion ofd , Vix , such , for instance , are the formsdx , x ) ' dx d and all that are comprehended under d _ ; a dx~ xl~dx the forms ( x V(x-dxi ) ' &amp;c. and all that are comprehended Xuer m dx under ( I laze)* It is on the grounds of convenience of calculation , and of systematic arrangement , that differential expressions , such as have been just exhibited , are resolved into a series of terms dx Pdx +P dx + Podx + &amp;c. +Q v.+ .
, , where Pdx + P'dx , P1'dx are integrable ; for , remove those grounds , and it will be tat+ I tSn +3 em+ 5 difficult to assign a reason why *'+ x In analytical investigation , after dthe tra scendental expression , next , in point of simplicity , is dx i/ ( ' ; * in a particular application , this differential represents the arc of an ellipset a figure , next , in point of Sim plicity , to the circle .
Many differential expressions depending , for their integration , on the integral of dx / ( 1e ) , it became necessary to exhibit it , for all values of x and e. A problem in consequence arose , of no small difficulty , named , analogously to the naming of the rectification of the ellipse .
In the prosecution oG the researches to which this problem led , it was discovered that the hlyperbola might be rectified by means of the ellipse , or , to speak correctly , and without the employment of figurative language , it was discovered that the transcendental expression dx %/ ( x 1zi ' ) ( e 7 1 ) might be mad.e to depend , for its integration , on that of dx ( I)e -v i. The integration of dx / does not depend more on the iength of an ellipse , than it does , on the time of the vibration of a pendulum in a circular arc , or on the attraction of a sphe .
roid ; but , in each of these problems , it occurs as an analytical phrase , an expression in symbolical language , the exact meaning of which it is necessary to know .
If the Imeaning be determined for one case , it is for all three ; and hence , with the rectification of dx ' , d ' 7( ' 2)-( z 2 ) is as simple an expression : they are considered together in -VO(-x ' ) ( i-e2 x1 ) the following pages .
I The ellipse admits of an easy mechanical description ; and , considered as a section of the cone , was admitted by the ancient geometricians into plane geometry .
the ellipse , a problem by itself unimportant , the solutions of other problems , are intimately connected ; and , with this object in view , the determination of the length of a curve line , mathematicians have enriched analysis with several curious artifices , and valuable methods .
To determine the integrals of , dx%/ ( Ij ) , it is necessary to expand them into series .
The difficulty is , to expand them into series that converge : the determination of the integral of dx ought to precede that of dx / ( '_ &lt; ) indeedin most of the series that represent the la7tter , is involved as a term , and is supposed to be known .
The determination of each integral presents a curious circumstance , in the correspondence of certain geometrical properties and analytical artifices ; for instance , the theorem for the tangent of the sum of two circular arcs , affords , analytically , a means of computing the length of the arc and , conversely , the analytical artifice * by which the integral of sdx which the itegra o , / - , )is computed ; translatedleads to the rdx properties of the sines , and tangents , of circular arcs .
Again , FAGNANI'S theorem , by which a right line is assigned equal to the difference of two elliptic arcs , affords a method of arithmetically computing the length of the ellipse and , conversely the analytical artifice by which the integral of dx/ ( ie ) is computed ; translated into geometrical language , becomes FAGNANI'S theorem .
And again , the analytical resolution of fdx./ ( Ifr ) into Au ' + Bit " + PfdutI ( 'jJ ) + Q~~t lU , ( here theintegral , on accu Qf-du ~ p(where the 'integrals , on account of the no -va ) ( contained between the values of v , o and -2 which latter series , from the smallness of v , V ' , converge with considerable rapidity ; or the latter part thus , putv Zv'G= then y an ' f ?
, f~dz ' j I~zzeJI+z~z I Now , if U ' , y 1 , V2 I fT VvZ= Coseuetl , th i tega Consequently , the integral of --(between the values of y , o and 3 ) 1+y Cdz 'between the values of z , o and 1b ( between the values of z ' , o and 3 ) and consequentlynj ( between o and x ) z{ 2+ 5 - &amp;c. }+J{ +s - &amp;c. } which is , in fact , E UL ER'S method of determining the periphery of a circle .
Now , from this analytical artifice of putting the integral of -dx J.d'u + by which means its arithmetical value is computed , may be deduced those theorems which relate to the sines , and tangents , of the sum and difference of arcs , &amp;c. by translating the formula u fv/ ( I _U"1 ) + i ?
41 =x into geometrical language .
2MS smallness of e ' , e " , are readily computed , ) translated into the language of geometry , expresses a curious relation between the arcs of three ellipses , the excentricities of which vary according to a certain law .
Hence it appears , that there are two different methods by which the analytic art may be advanced ; either by artifices peculiarly its own , or by aid drawn from the properties of figures and curve lines if , for instance , FAGNANI'S theorem be proved for an ellipse , by processes purely geometrical , then , such a theorem , expressed in analytical language , becomes immediately a means of computing the integral of dx v/ ' ; or if , by reasonings strictly geometrical , a relation can be established between the arcs of three ellipses , whose excentricities vary according to a certain law , then , by expressing such a relation in the signs of algebra , the integral of dx J(A ) may be computed by means of the integrals of du , ' 4 ( ' ? ? ? ?
) , and of dull| ( l , which integrals can be found more readily than the original integral , by reason of the quicker convergency of the series into which the differential expressions may be expanded , e and el ' being less than e. One main olject of the present paper is , to exhibit the integral of dx / ( '7 % ) for all values of e , and to reduce other integrals to it .
Much has been already done on this subject .
The researches of mathematicians on the length and comparison of elliptic arcs , are extended over the surface of many memoirs ; yet I hope to have something to add in point of invention , and more in point of arrangement and simplicity of expression .
The labours of future students will surely be lessened , if it be shown , that several methods , apparently , distinct and dissimilar , because expressed in different language , are fundamentally , and in principle , the same .
The simplest mode , and the first that occurred to mathematicians , of finding the value offdx/ ( ' A ) was , to expand the differential expression into a series of terms ascending by the powers of e , and to take the integral of each term .
This method , however , is very imperfect ; for , if e be nearly = 1 , the series converges so slowly as to be unfit , or at least very incommodious , for arithmetical computation .
It became necessary then to possess a series ascending by the powers of i e* ; and such a series was first given by EULER , in his Opuscula , published at Berlin in 1750 ; and it must be manifest , that there can be no one single series , ascending by the powers of e , or by powers of the same function e , that can in all cases represent its value .
I purpose to consider the several series that represent the value of fdxl ( '7 zi ) when e is small , when e is nearly = i , or , when V(i-e ) is small when e is L V/ ( 1-en ) and ia when e is &gt; V(-1ee2 ) and &gt; when e and v/ ( i -en are equal , or when each equals a_ .
The series for the first and second cases , I shall deduce , because I wish to consider the subject in its fullest extent ; but those serieswhen we regard practical commodiousness , are superseded by the methods by which thefdx I( l7e ) X1 is to be found , in the third and fourth cases .
Two methods then , are only requisite for finding the integral in all the values of e ; for the integral in the last case may be found , with nearly equal convenience , by either of the methods in the two preceding cases .
For the sake of conciseness , I employ the symbol D to denote the numeral coefficients of the terms arising from the expansion of ( i x)0 ; thus , Dl " signifies m ; D2 1m , m.mI ; 1l2 i , C rn * r-i 11 im , rn .

It is cha- .
racteristical of the peculiar mathematical powers of EULER , and also bears strong marks of the rapidity and eagerness with which he conducted every work of calculation .
The author discovers the series and its law , partly by tentative methods , and partly by the use of a differential equation of the second order ; and indeed , without the use of such an equation , it is difficult to exhibit the law .

Fromn the preceding analysis it is clear , that the computation of the integral of dx / ( '7H , ) is perfectly independent of the exa istence of the ellipse and its properties .
But it also appears , that the property of the bisection of the ellipse , established geometrically , ought not to be regarded as a merely curious and beautiful property , since , by its aid , the length of the elliptic quadrant may be computed .
Several other properties , considered hitherto in the light of curious and speculative truths , translated , would appear analytical artifices , and in computation practically useful .
By the preceding series , the integral of dx &gt; / ( i,6 ' t ) may be computed when e is nearly o or 1 .
It is necessary , however to possess a method of computing the integral when e is of mean value ; and the methods I am about to exhibit , are such as to supersede the useof the two series ascending by the powers of e and b in other words , from two similar mnethods , in all values of e between o and 1 , the integral may be commodiously computed .
The principle of the method is this , if df = dx ( then , " This theorem of FAGNANi has lately been very neatly demonstrated , by a most skilful mathematician , Mr. BRINKLEY , in the Trish Transactions , by a geometrical pros cess , Abut not without the use of prime and ultimate ratios .
Indeed , the nature of the subject is such , that the theorem cannot be established , without thel use of the fluxsonarv calculus , or of some calculus equivalent to it .
df ' , df " , df " ' , &amp;c. being similar differential expressions , df may be resolved into md P+M df'+ f. df " , ( dP being a perfect differential , mn , , , , &amp;c. constant coefficients , ) in like manner , df ' may be resolved into mnldP'+cz .

These results , applied to an ellipse , cause it to appear , that right lines can be assigned , respectively equal to the difference between an arc and half the quadrant , between an arc and one-fourth of the-quadrant , between an arc and one-eighth of the quadrant , &amp;c. Here may again be remarked , the connexion between the artifices of computation and the properties of curves ; for the series expressing fdx/ ( i-1e x2 ) ( cteris Paribus ) converges more quickly , the less x is ; consequently , the whole integral is more commodiously calculated by the theorem f ( i )2f ( x= , VlI b ) ) -i + b , than if x were put i , in the form of the expansion of dxj ( l , ) ; still more commodiously , by the theorem f(1 ) .

p. 90 , has treated of the integrals of these expressions ; as has LEGENDRE , Mem. de l'Acad .

page 454 .
The results obtained by these authors , may easily be deduced from the substitution of xV( I_ 2 , .
)=v ( ' _,4 .
Some of these results may appear curious a ; but I apprehend , what is chiefly necessary for the solutions of problems in physics and .
, astronomy , into which the expressions ( dxV ' ( ) enter , is a method of approximating to their integrals .
A certain method of approximating to these integrals , has been given in the preceding pages .
In different applications , its expression may be varied ; thus , f is transformed into an expression involvingf ' , f " , where f ' , f " , can be more easily computed than f ; express this transformation with reference to an ellipse , and it ; appears that the length of one ellipse may be estimated , from the lengths of two ellipses of different excentricity .
Again , f( t , , , an ez in order to be computed , is transformed into x~~~~e ' fdu ___________~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~e'-(i+ " du or into ( l+e ' ) ( X+e " ) Hdu " ; z eV I/ U_ Z ) ( , I e ' 12 ) 2*2 i-o &amp; -c .

A certain method , for computing the integral of dx &gt; / ( I-e X ( df ) being obtained , in a systematic treatise , the next business of the analyst would be , to show what differential forms depended for their integration on that of df .
Such differential forms are many ; and , by the introductionof geometrical language , with considerable embarrassment to the comnputist , varied in their expression .

Amongst these , dxl ' UA ) merits some attention .
In an analytical point of view , there is nothing curious or remarkable in the reduction of such a form to dx / &lt; ' ) , and other quantities that can be integrated ; but , with certain conditions , fdx J -represents the arc of an hyperbola ; consequently , announcing the analytical result in geometrical language , the hyperbola may be rectified by means of an ellipse ; which property is to be reckoned curious , I conceive , because the ellipse and hyperbola are sections of the same solid cone ; for , otherwise , I do not perceive why it is more curious , that an hyperbola should be rectified by means of an ellipse , than that any other curve , whose arc F , ( F an integral dependent on fdx I/ ( '7 , ) ) should be rectified by means of an ellipse .

This great mathematician has 2m+L also solved the problem of the expansion of ( a2+ -b -2b+cos 6 ) 1 ; he determines A and B , when the index 2f+I = in which case , the series for A and B , with respect to its numerical coefficients , decreases the fastest .
But the solution is not general , or , to speak more-precisely , it would be extremely incommodious to compute bA and B from the series ascending by the powers of .

That the determination of the coefficients A , B , &amp;c. depended on the integral of RdO , which , in a particular application , represents the arc of a conic section , was known to D'ALEMBERT .
In the ?

D'ALEMBERTI , therefore , rejects a method which has since been adopted : the reason , I presume to be this ; if he had attempted to find the coefficients by the rectification of the conic sections , he must have reduced the integrals of dA ( a+b .

Z ) , which , as he then could only do by resolving it -into a series , was a problem .
not more easy , than the finding of the integral of dA(a+beos.z)-L from its immediate resolution into a series ; consequently , the reduction of dz ( a+b cos. z ) into Z/ +Z"+ &amp;c. would have been useless and unprofitable labour .
-Had a certain and easy method of computing ( a+ b. cos. z)z been known to D'ALEMBERT , he would not have asserted the reduction of J'(a+b .

These observations are , however , digressive ; the problem , the expansion of ( a'+b'-.2ab .
cos I ) + , is ) I conceive , completely resolved in the preceding pages , whatever be the ratio between the radii of the planets ' orbits.* What I have advanced , on a former occasion , concerning the independence of analysis and geometry , is confirmed by the present reasonings and results .
fidx / ( 5-4A- ) , f.dl ( j ) , , Jo 2(Z_^ ) o have been computed , without the introductioi of an ellipse , an hyperbola , an oblique cylinder , or a pendulum vibrating in a circular arc ; and , as dx might have been computed , without the introduction of the Lemniscata.* I have stated the mode by which analysis may derive aid from geometry ; the extent of the aid however is , I conceive , very small ; remove the circle , ellipse , and parabola , curves whose properties have been the object of so much investigation , and we only create for ourselves unnecessary and circuitous operations , by introducing curves into the discussion of questions purely analytical .
For the purposes of classification , however , curves may not be altogether useless .
The correspondence that has been shown , between the artifices of calculation and the properties of geometrical figures , may be thought , perhaps , curious or remarkable ; and the reduction of several methods into one is , I presume , practically and scientifically useful .
On similar reductions , the perfection of analysis , to a great degree , depends : for , a frequent result of a careful investigation is , the discovery that methods apparently different , because differently expressed , are founded on the same principle and fundamental notion ; but , if examination and study thus diminish the seeming bulk of our knowledge , they , at the same time , increase an its precision and purity .
