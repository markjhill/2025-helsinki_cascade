ference of a circle to its Diameter .
" By William Rutherford , Esq. , F.R.A.S. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. &amp;c. Received November 17 , 1852 .
The author , referring to a former communication on this subject , published in the Phil. Trans. 1841 , states that , in the value of -r there given to 208 places of decimals , there exists , in the latter part of one of the terms of the series for determining the value of tan-'1 , a transposition of the figures of a recurring decimal , which vitiates a considerable number of the figures in the latter part of the value .
This error had been detected in consequence of Professor Schumacher having observed that in the value of 7r which had been given him by M. Dase , who had calculated it to 200 places , from the formula -== tan tan+ + tan-l , the figures from the 153rd to the 200th differed entirely from those given by the author .
The accuracy of M. Dase 's result was confirmed by a double computation of Dr. Clausen of Dorpat , who deduced the value of 7r to 250 places of decimals , both by Machin 's formula 7 ' Il 14 tan -tan 39 4 ?
1 5 239 ' and by the formula r 1I 1 --2 tan 1-+ tan ; and the author 's result was shown to differ from the correct value by the periodic decimal -36 .
Having been informed by Mr. W. Shanks of Houghton-le-Spring , that he had pushed his computation of the value of r to the extent of 318 decimals , the author resolved to extend his operations to upwards of 400 decimals .
As Mir .
Shanks had employed Machin 's formula , the author resolved to make use of the same .
At his request Mr. Shanks resumed his calculations , and has not only verified the author 's value of v to 440 places of decimals , but has carried his own to the extent of 530 places .
The author states that the values of -1~1 1 tan and tan ' 29 ' as well as the value of 7r , which are here subjoined , have been obtained by the independent computations of Mr. Shanks and himself , and that they both feel confident that these values are correct in every figure as far as 440 decimals .
