IV .
Part of a Letter from Mr Samuel Brady , to Dr William Cockburn , F. R. S. giving an Account of a Puppy in the Womb that received no Nourishment by the Mouth .
IN the Conversation we had about the Nourishment of the Faetus in the Womb , wherein we seemed to agree it was performed by the Umbilical Vessels only , without the assistance of the Mouth , I mentioned a Puppy at its full growth , which had never received any Nourishment this latter way .
It was whelp 'd November 1704 .
had no appearance of a Mouth at all , lived some time after it was parted from its Dam ; pulling the Skin off its Head , it had not the least passage through it : The Head was one solid Bone , without Sutures , somewhat Round , as a Mans Skull , with a little prominence in the fore-part , resembling the Os Nasi of a Man , but without any passage : It had no place for Eyes , nor Meatus for Ears , only the Outward Resemblance of one on each side , unprenetrated and placed lower than naturally .
No Jaw-bone , nor Coniveyance to the top of the Larynx and Phurynx , but thence downward natural .
I send you its Skin , stuffed carelessly for my own private satisfaction ; for which you may see it was only designed , by the little care taken in its preservation from the Mice , and the loss of the Bones : However , enough of it remains to mew that it received no Nourishment by the Mouth .
