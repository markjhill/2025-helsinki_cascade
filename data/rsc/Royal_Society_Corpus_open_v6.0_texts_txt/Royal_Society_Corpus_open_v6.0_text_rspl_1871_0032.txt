One great object with the solar-eclipse expeditionists at work to-day in the far East is to trace spectroscopically the existence of any faint solar luminous appendage to a further distance from the sun than the brighter parts of the corona hitherto so identified .
But much further they cannot go , on account of the large amount of general atmospheric illumination during every lunar-solar eclipse .
The matter may , however , be taken up again during a terrestrial solar eclipse , i. e. an ordinary sunset below the horizon , if the sun be sufficiently far below to terminate all aerial twilight .
Under such circumstances , too , it is that the zodiacal light , historically called the sun 's atmosphere , is occasionally seen stretching away to distances of 60 , 90 , and even more degrees from the sun .
Now I have recently been trying to test in this manner an alleged foreign observation of the zodiacal light 's spectrum , but in vain .
Some sort of faint bluing of the dark night sky there certainly was over the north-western horizon when the sun was more than 18 ' vertically below , and its spectrum I noted at the time , but only as being that of the very last of the twilight .
Perhaps it was only that ; but perhaps , also , it may have been the direct light of some solar appendage approximating to the outer coronal region ; for , on making up the accompanying plate* of nine observed spectra , and comparing them with a tabular solar spectrum , a wide distance was manifested between the place of maximum light in the solar continuous spectrum , as given by Fraunhofer , or near wave-length 5620 , and in my so-called residual twilight spectrum , which was wave-length 5300 .
I tested , therefore , lately Fraunhofer 's value for the solar spectrum in my own night-apparatus , by darkening its objective to all but extinction with four thicknesses of linen cloth in the middle of a dull , grey day , and found for the last visible portion of continuous spectrum wave-length 5700 nearly ; that is , Fraunhofer 's value was confirmed , and my residual-twilight spectrum left anomalous as regards the ordinary solar spectrum , but remarkably agreeable with the corona spectrum , whose chief line has wavelength 5322 , and which spectrum has been shown by Mr. Lockyer to decrease its number of lines , and tend to form a faint continuous spectrum , as it thins out with increase of distance from the sun 's limb .
