" Researches to determine the Number of Species and the Mode of Development of the British Triton .
" By J. Higginbottom , Esq. , F.R.C.S. Communicated by Thomas Bell , Esq. , F.R.S. The observations of the author , of which he gives a detailed account in the present memoir , have led him to the following conclusions : Two species only of the genus Triton are met with in England ; namely , the Triton verrucosus and the Lisso-triton punctatus .
It is three years before the animal is capable of propagating its species , and four years before it attains its full growth .
In its tadpole state , it remains in the water till its legs acquire sufficient strength to qualify it for progressive motion on land .
While a land animal , it is in an active state during the summer , and passes the winter in a state of hybernation ; but does not then , as has been erroneously supposed , remain at the bottom of pools .
Very dry , or very wet situations are incompatible with the preservation of life during the period of hybernation .
At the expiration of the third year , the triton revisits the water , in the spring season , for the purposes of reproduction , and again leaves it at the commencement of autumn .
Impregnation is accomplished through the medium of water , _ and not by actual contact .
The growth and development of the triton are materially influenced by temperature , and but little by the action of light .
The triton possesses the power of reproducing its lost limbs , provided the temperature be within the limits of 58 ?
and 75 ?
Fahrenheit ; but at lower temperatures , and during the winter , it has no such power .
