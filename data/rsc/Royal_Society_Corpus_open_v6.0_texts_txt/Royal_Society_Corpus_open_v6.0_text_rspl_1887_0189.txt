] undergone distinct retrogression , being only .
0-15 mm. in length , and formed of indifferent tissue instead of hyaline cartilage .
From this it would appear that the , fifth metatarsal actually disappears in Apteryx instead of fusing with the fourth as in the chick .
In Stage G the proximal tarsalls are closely applied to but have not yet united with the tibia ; the distalia also are still distinct from the metatarsals .
The rudiment of the mesotarsal semilunar pad has increased considerably , and in the centre of it a rounded nodule of hyaline cartilage has appeared , which I take to be the representative of the centrale tarsi , an element not hitherto recognised in birds* In a recently-hatched specimen of Apteryx , it is a perfectly distinct cartilage about 2 mm. in diameter , imbedded in the fibrous tissue of the semilunar pad ; in the adult it becomes ossified , attaining a diameter , in A. oweni , of about 5 mm. . .
As the scientific , libraries to which I have access are small and imperfect , I take this opportunity of saying that I shall be extremely gratef ul to the authors of papers bearing npon the subjects of the present investigation who will favour me with separate copies .

( Abstract .
) The authors have examined a variety of cells analogous to Becquerel 's " pile a oxygene ; " i.e. , containing two platinum or other non-oxidisable plates , one immersed in an acid fluid , the other in an alkaline one , the two fluids being connected by a wet wick or siphon , and either some oxidising agent being also contained in the acid or some reducing substance in the alkali .
In the first case continuous evolution of oxygen was brought about from the surface of the plate immersed in the alkali ; in the second the converse phenomenon was observed , i.e. , hydrogen was continuously evolved from the plate in the acid ; in each case the quantity of gas liberated was equivalent to the current passing as measured by a small silver voltameter .
Thus the following figures were obtained in various experiments , the measurements being made after sufficient amounts
