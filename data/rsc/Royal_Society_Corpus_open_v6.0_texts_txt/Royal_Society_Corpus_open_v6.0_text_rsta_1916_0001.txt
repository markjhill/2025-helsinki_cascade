Received June 8 , \#151 ; Read June 17 , 1915 .
In this communication are described the five remaining double sulphates of the series .
6H20 , in which R is ammonium and M is nickel , cobalt , manganese , copper , and cadmium .
The ammonium salts , in which M is magnesium , zinc , and iron , have been described in two previous communications , * !
in the latter of which ( that concerning ammonium ferrous sulphate ) a number of general questions concerning the whole series were also discussed .
The present contribution completes the author 's work , commenced in the year 1890 , on the double sulphates of this important monoclinic series , in all 31 salts , of which the It bases have been potassium rubidium , caesium , ammonium , and thallium .
Excluding thallium\#151 ; of which only the zinc double sulphate has been included , the other double salts containing thallium not having yet been obtained in crystals of the perfection necessary for detailed accurate work of the character regarded as essential by the author\#151 ; the four bases , potassium , rubidium , caesium , and ammonium should give rise , with the eight several dyad bases above enumerated , to 32 double sulphates .
All these have been obtained in excellent crystals , and fully described , with the two exceptions of potassium manganese and potassium cadmium sulphates , which , for some as yet undiscovered reason , are incapable of preparation .
Yet so thoroughly are the relations between the various salts , and the rules governing the replacement of any one alkali base by any other , now understood , that it has been found possible to predict the constants of the two missing salts .
Of the isomorphous double selenates , nine salts ( including thallium zinc selenate ) containing magnesium and zinc as M metals have already been described by the author , and it is intended that the remaining double selenates , those containing the other dyad metals , shall form the subject of the author 's next connnun ication .

Morphology .
The first measurements of the crystals of this salt were made 60 years ago by Marignac , * and the salt was included four years later by Murmann and Rotterf in their comprehensive crystallographic investigation .
The forms observed in both investigations were the same as those given in the list below , except a { 100 } and o{ill } , and the values observed for the principal angles will be found quoted in the two last columns of the table of angles .

Habit.\#151 ; Short prismatic parallel p { 110 } , or more or less tabular parallel to a pair of faces of this prism ( developed more than the other pair ) , or parallel to { 001 } .
Ten excellent small and perfectly transparent crystals of this magnificent bluish emerald-green salt were measured , selected from six different crops .
The results are shown in the accompanying table of angles .
The crystals were of the two types illustrated in figs. 1 and 2 .
The characteristic of the first type is the predominance of the primary prism { 110 } and the basal plane c { 001 } , with smaller faces of the clinopinakoid { 010 } C^n'^me ^ form r'{201 } , and the two hemipyramids o{lll } and oThe whole of the faces of the two latter forms were never found on any one crystal , and usually only one or two such faces were present .
The form 201 } was also very subsidiary , and on many crystals only one of the two faces was present .

The r'{20l } faces were also somewhat more prominent , and more of the faces of o { ill } and ( / { ill } were developed .
The c and p faces in many crops were affected by striation , but those crystals selected for measurement were wonderfully free from this defect , and several of the crystals measured were practically perfect , yielding brilliant single images of the signal throughout , offering no trace of ambiguity as to the position of the faces .
The contact face ( that parallel to the bottom of the crystallising vessel ) was either 6 or p. The next table affords a comparison of the axial angles and axial ratios of the four salts containing nickel .
The axial angle of the ammonium salt is almost identical with that of the caesium salt .
The values of the axial ratios of the ammonium salt clearly indicate the existence of isomorphism between this salt and the three salts containing the alkali metals .

49 117 = 1 57 The average and maximum changes of angle when potassium is replaced by ammonium are very nearly the same as occur when potassium is replaced by caesium , and are twice as great as when potassium is replaced by rubidium .
Of the 36 angles compared , 33 show differences on replacing potassium by ammonium in the same direction as when rubidium or caesium are introduced instead of potassium , the only three exceptions being when the differences are very minute .
In 32 of the 33 cases the changes are greater than when rubidium is introduced , and in 11 cases they exceed the effect produced by introducing caesium for potassium .

2*8724 The former pyknometer values obtained for the three salts were respectively 2*233 , 2*583 , and 2*865 .
The higher values now obtained are doubtless very near the truth , the error of the pyknometer method being on the side of lowness , due to inevitable mother-liquor inclusions , whereas the immersion method affords the result for the most cavity-free crystal .
In the next table the volume constants of the four nickel-containing salts are compared .
It shows that the molecular volume and topic axial ratios of the ammonium salt are close to those of the rubidium salt ; the molecular volume is half a unit higher , the x and ratios are also slightly higher and the oo ratio very slightly lower .

Refractive Indices.\#151 ; Six 60'-prisms were ground by means of the author 's cutting and grinding goniometer , * each to afford two indices directly , and the results are * A new crystal-grinding goniometer on the Goldschmidt two-circle principle has recently been described by F. E. Weight ( 'Journ .
Washington Acad , of Sciences , ' 1915 , 5 , 35 ) .
In its description a mere passing mention is made of the very efficient instrument which the author ( Tutton ) described in the year 1899 ( 'Phil .

Soc. , ' A , 1899 , 192 , 457 ; ' Zeitschr .
fur Kryst .
, ' 1899 , 31 , 458 ; 'Crystallography and Practical Crystal Measurement , ' 1911 , p. 682 ) , and which has been used in all his investigations during the past 16 years , over a thousand section-plates and prisms having been most accurately prepared with its aid , truly orientated and plane surfaced .
This instrument is capable of achieving all that the new Wright instrument is described as accomplishing , and much more besides .
The use of a second circle cannot add to rigidity , and the author infinitely prefers the most rigid one-circle principle .
After 16 years of hard service the author 's cutting and grinding goniometer is as efficient and accurate as when first constructed by Messrs. Troughton and Simms .

This is followed by another table , in which the refractive indices of the four nickel-containing salts are compared .
Murmann and Rotter obtained indirectly the values a = 1*489 , = 1*498 , and y = 1*508 for the middle of the spectrum .
There is a considerable amount of absorption by this green salt at the red end of the spectrum , but the electric arc , used as a source of light with the author 's spectroscopic monochromatic illuminator , # affords ample light for the observations in Li and C light .

Observations at 70 ' indicate that the refractive indices of ammonium nickel sulphate are diminished by about 0*0018 ' ( for a ) to 0*0022 ' ( for y ) for 55 ' rise of temperature .
The comparative table shows that the refractive indices of ammonium nickel sulphate are just slightly higher than those of the analogous rubidium salt , and not nearly so high as those of the caesium salt .
This is also clearly apparent as regards the mean refractive index given at the foot of the table .
As regards double refraction , the ammonium salt occupies a similar position between the rubidium and caesium salts and much nearer to the rubidium one ; as this property of double refraction diminishes v 4 Crystallography and Practical Crystal Measurement , ' 1911 , p. 698 .

metals .
The first series ( on the left ) shows the ratios when the / 3-axis of each salt is taken as 1 , and the second ( right hand ) series when the/ 8-axis of the potassium salt is taken = 1 ; this second series thus shows the effect on the optical ellipsoid of replacing one alkali base by another .
In both series the position of the ammonium salt is between the rubidium and csesium salts , and much nearer to the former .
Molecular Optical Constants.\#151 ; These have been calculated with the aid of the densities as determined by the immersion method , both for the ammonium salt now under discussion , and for the potassium , rubidium , and caesium salts , and the results are set forth comparatively in the next three tables .
The specific refraction and dispersion of ammonium nickel sulphate are considerably higher than those of the alkali-metal salts .
The molecular dispersion is slightly higher than that of the caesium salt .
The molecular refraction , whether calculated by the formula of Lorenz , or by that of Gladstone and Dale , is very close to ( just higher than ) that for the rubidium salt .
The mean molecular refraction shows this very succinctly .

A comparison of the optic axial angles of the four salts containing nickel , instituted in the next table , shows that the angle for the ammonium salt is close to that of the caesium salt , being slightly lower than the latter .
It has to be remembered that caesium nickel sulphate is ( by exception in the series ) of negative double refraction , so that the first median line is , in this case , the axis of the indicatrix ellipsoid , instead of ( as usual in the series ) the y axis .

Habit.\#151 ; Short prismatic parallel p { 110 } , often with narrower c faces and larger q faces than in the nickel salt ; or more or less tabular parallel to a pair of faces of this prism p{110 } predominatingly grown , or to c { 001 } .
This is one of the finest salts of the series , the crystals being of a ruby or red-currant red colour .
The crystals , of several of the numerous crops obtained were composed of completely transparent well-developed individuals , having absolutely plane faces yielding brilliant single images of the signal of unusual perfection .
Ten superb crystals were measured , selected from five different crops .
The results are shown in the table of angles .
A typical crystal is shown in fig. 4 , and fig. 2 , representing a crystal of ammonium nickel sulphate , is equally typical of many crops of the cobalt analogue .
Both are of the short prismatic type , but not infrequently Interfacial Angles of Ammonium Cobalt Sulphate .

the prism is relatively longer than is shown in the two figures .
In the great majority of crops prepared the type was that of fig. 4 , or of the same elongated vertically , the faces of the basal plane c { 001 } predominating at the terminations .
But in several of the crops the faces were relatively narrower and the faces of { Oil } proportionately larger , as shown in fig. 2 .
In all the crops the prism faces _p{ll0 } were always important , and indeed usually predominated .
The two faces of the clinopinakoid h { 010 } were often well developed , although many crops showed these faces only as strips , and not uncommonly they were either entirely absent or mere lines .
The faces of the orthopinakoid r ' { 201 } were usually very subordinate , as shown in the figure .
The two hemipyramids o { ill } and o'{111 } were usually represented by some of their faces , and the latter form often by all its faces , although small .
The orthopinakoid a{100 } was only very rarely developed to a measurable extent .
The next three tables compare the morphological constants of the four salts containing cobalt .
The first of these shows that the axial angle ( 3 of ammonium cobalt sulphate is very close to that of caesium cobalt sulphate , and that the axial ratios of the ammonium salt are very clearly such as place that salt in the same isomorphous series as the three cobalt salts containing the alkali metals .
The angular comparisons instituted in the second table are supplemented by a further short table showing the average and maximum changes of angle which occur when potassium is replaced by the other three alkali bases .
These changes are seen to be nearly the same for the ammonium and caesium replacements , and these again are twice as great as the average and maximum changes of angle when rubidium is introduced instead of potassium .
A critical analysis of the comparative table of angles also shows that of the 36 angles compared 32 show changes , when ammonium replaces potassium , in the same direction as when the latter is replaced by the other two alkali metals , and the only four exceptions are in cases where the changes are very minute .
Of the 32 , 29 show larger changes than for the rubidium replacement , and 11 show even larger changes than for the caesium replacement .

Optics .
Orientation of the Optical Ellipsoid.\#151 ; The symmetry plane { 010 } is the plane of the optic axes .
The double refraction is positive , the first median line corresponding to the refractive index y , and the second median line to a. Two section plates parallel to the symmetry plane afforded the following extinction angles :\#151 ; Inclination of2M.L .

As the axial angle ac = 72 ' 58 ' , this extinction direction of the second median line is 6 ' 19 ' in front of the vertical axis c , and the first median line is 10 ' 43 ' above the axis a , both median lines being in the obtuse angle of the morphological axes The positions of the optical ellipsoids of all four cobalt-containing salts are compared in the following table , and are graphically expressed in the accompanying fig. 5 .

Refractive Indices.\#151 ; The following table gives the results of measurements with six excellent 60'-prisms , each ground accurately to afford two indices directly , the prism edge and bisecting plane being parallel to a principal axis and principal plane of the indicatrix .
There is considerable absorption in the green and blue parts of the spectrum , but the illumination of the images of the spectrometer slit for Tl , Cd and F light was quite adequate to ensure accuracy , using the electric arc with the monochromatic illuminator , as usual .

The newly determined densities were employed in recalculating the values for the three alkali-metal salts .
The specific refraction and dispersion of the ammonium salt are considerably higher than those of the three salts containing the alkali metals .
The molecular dispersion of the ammonium salt is slightly higher than that of the caesium salt .
The molecular refraction , either of Lorenz or Gladstone and Dale , is invariably just higher than that of the rubidium salt , a fact which is very clearly demonstrated by the mean molecular refraction given in the last column of the third table .

The determinations were carried out with Plates 1 , 2 and 3 immersed in toluene , the refractive index of which ( 1'4955 ) is almost identical with the mean refraction ( l'4962 ) of ammonium cobalt sulphate .

Murmann and Rotter also found a minute face of nr { 121 } on one crystal .
Habit.\#151 ; Prismatic ( primary prism jo { 110 } ) parallel axis c. The prisms are sometimes fairly long , but more frequently short .
Ten good crystals were measured , obtained from five different crops .
The results are given in the table of angles .
The crystals were beautifully transparent in the crops retained for use , but some other crops showed an appreciable amount of turbidity .
They are not quite colourless , a faint pink tint appearing to be an essential property of the salt which in the cases of truly transparent crystals renders them very beautiful , especially when a number are seen together against a white background .
Great care is required in growing them for goniometrical purposes , as crops grown without the precautions indicated in the author 's " Crystallography and Practical Crystal Measurement " ( p. 9 ) show more facial irregularities than many other salts of this series .
The primary prism p{110 } is generally the largely predominating form , closely followed by the basal plane c { 001 } , as shown in fig. 1 .
Often , however , the latter form c is less prominent , the faces of q { 011 } being relatively larger and the orthopinakoid r ' { 201 } being exceptionally well developed , as shown in fig. 6 .
Occasionally crystals were also seen , and one was measured , having large b { 010 } faces .
The hemipyramid faces o ' { 111 } ( common ) and o { ill } ( rarer ) were usually somewhat distorted , rarely giving images of the signal so good as those derived from the faces of other forms .
The prismatic form p'{ 120 } was fairly common , appearing as a strip , but the prism p"'{ 130 } was much more rarely developed .
The orthopinakoid a{100 } was only once seen , and was then merely a fine narrow strip affording an image too faint for absolute measurement .

and Hotter was never seen on this salt , although the author has observed it on other salts of the series .
In the next three tables the morphological constants of the three salts containing manganese are compared .
From the first table it will be observed that the axial angle / 3of the ammonium salt is fairly near to that of the caesium salt , and that the axial ratios of the ammonium and rubidium salts are also close to each other ; the values for the ammonium salt clearly indicate the propriety of including this salt in this isomorphous series of double salts .
The impossibility of preparing potassium manganese sulphate renders as complete a comparison as usual of the interfacial angles of a group impossible ; but the angles of the ammonium salt are very obviously related to those of the rubidium and caesium salts in a manner similar to that which has been observed in the other groups investigated , where the complete set of four salts has been obtained .
Like the axial ratios , the angles indicate clearly that the ammonium salt does belong to the same series as the rubidium and caesium salts .
Cleavage.\#151 ; -There is an excellent cleavage parallel to the orthopinakoid r'{20l } , and also a fairly good cleavage parallel to the clinopinakoid b { 010 } .

The optic axial angle of ammonium manganese sulphate is shown in the following comparative table to be slightly larger than that of the rubidium salt .

Morphology .
Crystals of this salt were measured in the year 1835 by Miller , * who observed the forms a , c , p , q , r ' , and o ' , of those enumerated in the list of forms given below .
Murmann and Rotter included the salt in their optical investigation of 1859 ( cit. , p. 170 ) , and observed the further forms band p ' ; but they did not record any accurate measurements of the crystal angles .
Miller 's values are quoted in the last column of the table of angles now given .

Habit.\#151 ; Short prismatic parallel to p { 110 } , or tabular parallel to { 001 } .
Eleven perfectly transparent crystals were measured of this beautiful pale blue salt , selected from seven different crops .
They were of the two types shown in figs. 8 and 9 , and of intermediate types .
Many crystals of the numerous crops prepared were very simple , exhibiting only the forms c{001 } , p{110 } , q{Oil } , and r'{20l } .
On numerous others small or narrow representatives of the other forms mentioned in the list of forms were present .
On a good number of the crystals of the crops from which individuals were selected for measurement there were well developed faces of the clinopinakoid b { 010 } , the rarer prisms p'{ 120 } andp'^130 } , and the hemipyramids o { ill } and o'{l 11 } .
Traces only of the orfchopinakoid a{l00 } were observed , no measurements being possible .
The variation of the length of the faces of the prism zone causes the variation of habit from prismatic along p { 110 } to tabular parallel to c { 001 } .
Both these forms showed striation in many of the crops prepared , but the crops used were composed of crystals exhibiting this property at a minimum , and several of the measured crystals were quite free from striation .
The face in contact with the bottom of the crystallising vessel had been either por c. * 'Phil .

Cleavage.\#151 ; The cleavage common to the series , parallel to r'{20l } , is developed , but is not very facile .
There is quite a good cleavage parallel to { 010 } , and in this salt this m cleavage is undoubtedly the better one of the two .

There is every reason for confidence that the new values now given are nearer the truth .
The next table presents the whole of the volume constants of the four copper-containing salts in comparative form .
It shows that the molecular volume of the ammonium salt is almost identical with that of the rubidium salt , and in this case very slightly lower .
As regards topic axial ratios , the x and f values are slightly lower , and the u\gt ; value somewhat higher , than the corresponding values for the rubidium salt .

0*0184 0*0150 0*0144 0*0105 It will be clear from this table that the refractive indices of ammonium copper sulphate are slightly higher than those of rubidium copper sulphate ; the mean refractive index at the foot of the table shows this well .
The double refraction is also only slightly different from ( beyond ) that of the rubidium salt , being slightly less , this property being a diminishing one while refractive index is an increasing property as the alkali-metal series is ascended .

In the left-hand series , in which the / 3 axis of each salt is the reference dimension for that salt , the copper group shows its individuality in the fact that the ratios for the ammonium salt are the lowest or highest , instead of , as in the other groups , being intermediate between the values for the rubidium and caesium salts .
Molecular Optical Constants.\#151 ; These are set forth in the next three tables , for all four salts , the new values now given for the densities having been employed in recalculating the values for the three salts containing the alkali metals .
The specific refraction and dispersion of the ammonium salt stand out prominently higher than those of the three alkali-metal salts .
The molecular dispersion for the ammonium salt is not , in this group by exception , the highest , but stands below , yet nearest to , that for the csesium salt .

density determinations the crystals have had to be freshly prepared and used very soon after removal from the mother liquor .
Their goniometrical measurement , however , has offered no difficulty .
The relative development of the faces is frequently so different from the main types illustrated in figs. 11 and 12 , that it is not always easy to recognise the various faces immediately .
The ten small crystals measured were selected from the two best crops of a very large number prepared .
They afforded very satisfactory goniometrical results ( see accompanying table of angles ) in all cases but those involving the faces of o'jlll } in the zone [ cpo'~\ ; for when this zone was adjusted these faces invariably showed multiple images of the signal , due to more or less striation , so that the mean measured values of the angles po ' and o'c differed rather more than usual from the calculated values .
The rarer forms common to this monoclinic series of double salts are exceptionally well developed on the crystals of cadmium ammonium sulphate ; for instance , the faces of a{100 } , o { ill } , p'{l20 } , and 130 } have been frequently observed quite large .
Moreover , single faces of the commoner forms { 010 } and r'{201 } are occasionally found phenomenally developed ; thus several crystals were found roughly hemispherical , the large flat base being a particularly large and perfectly plane Efface , while others were found with a similarly predominatingly developed r'-face .
The morphological constants of the three cadmium-containing salts are compared in the next two tables .
As already explained , potassium cadmium sulphate with 6H20 has so far resisted all attempts at preparation .
The first table shows that the axial ratios of the ammonium cadmium salt are very close to those of the rubidium cadmium salt .
The axial angle / 3 of the ammonium salt is not far removed from that of the caesium salt , but is not so close as in all the other groups investigated .
The morphological angles of the ammonium salt are shown in the second table to be related to those of the rubidium and caesium salts in a very similar manner to what has been shown to occur in the other groups , for which it has been possible to effect a complete comparison and to determine the differences in angle of all three salts from the potassium salt .
They indicate conclusively that the ammonium salt belongs to the same isomorphous series as the rubidium and caesium salts containing cadmium .

H tions of this salt by the pyknometer method , owing to rapid efflorescence , which was greatly accelerated by powdering and necessitated rapid working and weighing while covered with carbon tetrachloride , the pyknometer liquid .
The immersion method is free from the powdering difficulty , and it is only necessary to use freshly grown crystals , and to preserve them under benzene until the moment of dropping them into the immersion liquid mixture of methylene iodide and benzene .
This was done in the cases of the five determinations now recorded , and the residt , 2'G95 , is much higher than the former pyknometer one , and can be accepted with confidence .

Optics .
No optical investigation of this salt appears to have been hitherto undertaken .
It is a matter of some difficulty , as ground surfaces of the crystals effloresce with great rapidity ; also the use of warm wax on the crystal holder for cementing purposes is precluded , as rise of temperature provokes instant opacity from loss of water of crystallisation .
By careful rapid work , however , the use of a special wax , and immediately covering ground surfaces with very thin truly plane glass plates cemented by hard balsam in benzene , all these difficulties were eventually overcome .
Orientation of Optical Ellipsoid .
The optic axes lie in the symmetry plane b { 010 } and the sign of the double refraction is positive .
The first median line corresponds to the axis y of the optical indicatrix and the second median line to a. A pair of section-plates parallel to the symmetry plane afforded the extinction angles:\#151 ; Inclination of 2M.L .

In recalculating the values for the rubidium and caesium salts the new values for the densities now determined by the immersion method were employed .
From the tables it may be deduced that the specific refraction and dispersion of the ammonium salt stand out prominently higher than those of the rubidium and caesium salts ; the molecular dispersion of the ammonium salt also slightly exceeds that of caesium cadmium sulphate .
As regards the most important molecular refraction , all the values for the ammonium salt , including the mean molecular refraction , are just slightly higher than the corresponding values for the rubidium salt .

Summary of Conclusions .
The results of this investigation of the five remaining ammonium salts of the double sulphate series- are perfectly in line with and fully confirm those already derived , in two former communications , from a study of three other ammonium salts of the series .
The chief conclusion is that the close similarity of the ciystal angles , the axial ratios , the volume constants , and the optical constants of these ammonium salts clearly entitles them to places in the monoclinic isomorphous series R2M(S04)2 .
6H20 , It being represented by the NH4 radicle ; but that they are not so definitely related , " eutropic " as it has been termed , as are those salts of the series in which It is potassium , rubidium , or caesium .
Now interchange of these It-metals has been shown to exert a comparatively great and dominating effect on the properties of the crystals , progressively with their atomic weights , while change of the M-metal only produces slight change .
But this law of progression of the crystallographic properties , both morphological and physical , with the atomic weight of the alkali metal It , which law is the essence of " eutropism , " cannot apply as regards ammonium ; for we are here dealing with a radicle group of elements , NH4 , and not with three simple interchangeable elements of the same family group of Mendeleeff 's table , definitely progressive in atomic weight and in all the properties which accompany atomic weight .
Yet the group NH4 possesses the singular power of chemically replacing these alkali metals in their salts , as also does the metal thallium , which is well known to be of a different nature to the three alkali metals potassium , rubidium , and csesium .
It has now been shown that the replacement occurs in these two non-eutropic cases with surprisingly slight alteration of the morphology of the crystals , the change , in fact , being almost nil when rubidium is the alkali metal replaced by either ammonium or thallium .
While no clear rule like that of eutropic progression can apply as regards ammonium ( or thallium ) , there are still very definite relationships which have been established as the result of the research now completed , which can best be stated separately for the various properties .
Crystal Angles.\#151 ; -The monoclinic axial angle / 3 of the ammonium salt of any group ( set of salts containing the same M-metal ) is usually very close to that of the caesium salt of the same group .
In six of the eight groups , those in which all four salts ( of NH4 , K , Kb , and Cs ) are capable of existence , the difference is less than 10 ' , and in three cases it does not exceed 2 ' .
The change in this important angle when K is replaced by Kb is usually about a degree , and when Cs replaces K about 2 degrees , the latter being almost exactly twice the former , the angular changes corresponding to the two changes in atomic weight , 46 and 93 .
The maximum changes observed for the two replacements were 1 ' 12 ' and 2 ' 20 ' , in the iron group , the NH4 replacement in this group causing 2 ' 18 ' of change .
In all the six complete groups 32 to 34 out of 36 different interfacial angles compared ( all in which the differences are beyond the range of experimental error ) show a change of angle on replacing K by NH4 in the same direction as if Kb or Cs were introduced instead .
The average and maximum amounts of the change when NHt replaces K are approximately the same as when K is replaced by Cs , and this amount is twice as great as when Kb replaces K ; for the average and maximum changes of angles are directly proportional to the change of atomic weight when one alkali metal is substituted for another .
( K = 38'85 when H = 1 , Kb = 84*9 , and Cs = 131-9 , and 38.'85 + 131'9 = 85'4 ; also Rb-K = 46 , and Cs-Rb = 47 .
) The maximum change of angle observed for the replacement of K by Cs occurs in the magnesium group , and is 2 ' 25 ' ; the replacement of K by NH4 in the same group provokes a change of nearly the same amount , 2 ' 18 ' , while the change for the replacement of K by Kb is exactly half the value for the Cs replacement , namely , 1 ' 12 ' .
This direct proportionality of the average and maximum change of angle to the change in atomic weight of the alkali metal is one of the most striking.and important of all the facts brought to light by this prolonged investigation , and is rendered the more important by the large amounts of these changes .
It is also interesting to note that the change ( strictly proportional to that in atomic weight ) in the most important of the angles , the axial angle / 3 , between the primary orthopinakoid a{100 } and basal plane c { 001 } , is so large as to be nearly equal to the maximum , and in several groups this angle is actually itself the angle of maximum change .
These conclusions are , therefore , far away from any possible experimental error , which at the highest estimate could not exceed 5 ' and probably does not exceed 3 ' .
MONOCLINIC DOUBLE SULPHATES CONTAINING AMMONIUM .
Axial Ratios.\#151 ; The ratios of the morphological axes of any ammonium salt of the series are very close to those of the alkali-metal salts of the same group , and usually lie within the limits of the latter .
They thus afford very strong evidence of the isomorphism of the ammonium salts with the alkali-metal salts of the group and series .
Cleavage.\#151 ; The crystals of the whole series of salts show cleavage parallel to the orthopinakoid r'{201 } .
Four of the ammonium salts , those of the Mg , Ni , Mn , and Cu groups , show in addition a good cleavage parallel to the symmetry plane { 010 } , and in ammonium copper sulphate this cleavage is the more perfect of the two .
The introduction of the NH4 radicle in place of an alkali metal thus appears to affect the cleavage .
A similar effect was observed in the simple rhombic sulphates of ammonium and the alkali metals ; but in this case it took the form of the suppression in ammonium sulphate of one ( b { 010 } , the more perfect cleavage ) of the two cleavages ( parallel to b{010 } and { 001 } ) common to the sulphates of K , Rb , and Cs .
Density and Molecular Volume.\#151 ; The density of the ammonium salt is the lowest in every group .
The molecular volume of the ammonium salt , however , is nearly identical with that of the rubidium salt of the same group ; on the average it is just slightly higher , the differences varying from 1*6 above to 0T6 below the value for the rubidium salt .
The average difference of molecular volume , for the whole of the double sulphate series , between a K and a Rb salt is 9'55 units , between a K and a NH4 salt 10'41 units , and between a K and a Cs salt 22*23 units .
The change of molecular volume with change of the alkali metal thus follows the order of the atomic weights of the alkali metals , and the absolute amounts are a higher function of the atomic weight than direct proportionality .
The two following tables will render these facts clear .

22-23 Molecular Distance Ratios ( topic axial ratios).\#151 ; When considered comparatively for the different salts these represent directionally in the crystal the same changes as are represented in total alteration of volume by the comparison of the molecular volumes .
The ratios may be regarded as expressing the relative dimensions in space of the unit cells of the space-lattice of the crystal structure , the volume of the cell being expressed by the molecular volume .
In the zinc and cadmium groups all three ratios of the ammonium salt are slightly greater than those of the rubidium salt ; in the magnesium , iron , manganese , nickel and cobalt groups x and are slightly greater and \lt ; 0 slightly less , and in the copper group x and \fs are slightly less and w slightly greater .
Thus , on the average , just as for the molecular volume , the spatial axial ratios of the ammonium salt are slightly greater than for the intermediate rubidium salt .
It will be observed that these results include , and are in agreement with , those previously published for the magnesium , zinc , and iron groups .
It may now , therefore , be stated definitely for the whole series of double sulphates , without exception , that the replacement of potassium by ammonium ( K2 by 2NH4 ) is accompanied by scarcely more change of volume , or change in the directional dimensions of the unit cell of the space-lattice , than when potassium is replaced by rubidium ( K2 by Rb2 ) , and by only half the change of volume which ensues on the replacement of potassium by caesium ( K2 by Cs2 ) .
Regarded in another light , the replacement of the two atoms of rubidium by the ten atoms of the two ammonium NH4 radicle-groups is accompanied by scarcely any appreciable change in the structural dimensions , either molecular volume or topic axial ratios ( volume or directional extension ) .

The a axis of the ellipsoid is nearest to the vertical axis c of the crystal , and the approximation is closest , among the alkali-metal salts , for the potassium salt .
It is even closer , except in the copper group , for the ammonium salt , the potassium salt coming next , then the rubidium salt and the caesium salt at such angles as accord with the order of the atomic weights , but with a higher function than mere direct proportion to atomic weight .
In the copper group the ammonium and potassium salts exhibit optical ellipsoids almost identically situated , with the a axis inclined 18f ' from the vertical axis c , the positions of the ellipsoids of the rubidium and caesium salts still following the rule of progression .
Refractive Indices.\#151 ; In all the eight groups the refractive indices , including the mean index , of the ammonium salt are very close to those of the rubidium salt ( which are always intermediate between those for the K and Cs salts ) , and usually very slightly higher .
The double refraction of the ammonium salt also lies intermediate between the values for the corresponding rubidium and caesium salts , the situation varying in the different groups on either side of the half-way position ; on the average it lies nearer to the value for the rubidium salt .
As regards the axial ratios ( the directional dimensions ) of the optical ellipsoid , the values for the ammonium salt of any group are intermediate between the values for the rubidium and caesium salts of the same group , and much nearer to the rubidium salt values .
Molecular Optical Constants.\#151 ; In specific refraction and dispersion the ammonium salt of every group is distinguished by values much higher than those for the alkali-metal salts of the same group .
As regards the important property of molecular refraction , in every group of the series the value for the ammonium salt , whether calculated by the Lorenz or the Gladstone and Dale formula , is very close to and just slightly higher than the value for the rubidium salt , which itself is intermediate between the values for the potassium and caesium salts , in accordance with the law of progression with the atomic weight of the alkali metal .
The molecular dispersion of the ammonium salt is nearest to the value for the corresponding caesium salt , in four groups being just lower than the latter , and in the other four groups just higher ; for high dispersion is a characteristic property in which the ammonium salts exhibit the constitutional difference of the NII4 radicle from the alkali metals which form the other L-bases in the isomorphous salts of the series .
Optic Axial Angle.\#151 ; No definite rule can be traced from a comparison of the optic axial angles of the ammonium salts with those of the salts containing the alkali metals ; these latter salts show a progressive change in optic axial angle with change of atomic weight of the alkali metal .
Final Conclusion.\#151 ; The work now described on the remaining five double sulphates containing ammonium confirms and emphasises the two main conclusions derived from the study of the three ammonium salts already described , which may be I 2 GO DR. A. E. H. TUTTON ON THE stated as follows:\#151 ; ( l ) These ammonium salts are truly isomorphous with the similarly constituted potassium , rubidium , and caesium salts of the generic formula It , M ( SO , )3.6H,0 , but are not eutropic with them ; the potassium , rubidium , and caesium salts alone form the exclusive eutropic series , in which the crystallographic ( morphological and physical ) properties obey the law of progression with the atomic weight of the alkali metal , which has been established in the previous communications concerning those salts .
This law is particularly well illustrated by the fact , to which no exceptions have been observed , that the average change of angle between the crystal faces , and also the maximum change of interfacial angle ( which usually occurs for the all-important monoclinic axial angle between the primary faces , and exceeds between a K and a Cs salt two whole degrees ) , are directly proportional to the change in atomic weight , when any one alkali metal is replaced by ?
another .
( 2 ) The dimensions of the space-lattice of any ammonium salt of the series are nearly identical with those of the intermediate alkali metal salt , that containing rubidium as the R-metal ; so that the two atoms of rubidium are replaced by the ten atoms of the two NH4 radicle-groups without appreciably altering the crystallographic structural dimensions .
To these may be added the following third general conclusion , which has been substantiated as regards thallium in a former communication* :\#151 ; \#166 ; ( 3 ) The salts of this series in which R is thallium resemble the ammonium salts closely , in truly belonging to the isomorphous series , but not to the more exclusive eutropic series formed by the salts of potassium , rubidium , and caesium .
Like the ammonium salts , the thallium salts also closely resemble the rubidium salts , but the thallium salts are distinguished optically , by their transcendent refractive power , both their refractive indices and their molecular refraction being far higher than for any other salts of the whole isomorphous series .
An interesting memoir has recently appeared by F. M. Jaegert on the crystallised ethylsulphates of the rare earths , R/ " ( S04 .
C2H5)6 + 18H20 in which R is Yt , Ce , La , Nd , Pr , Sm , Eu , Dys , Gd , Er , Thu , and NYb .
Jaeger finds that the crystalline forms of these salts are so extremely close to each other that the differences fall within the limits of experimental error .
He concludes , therefore , that they are rigorously identical , oscillating about a mean form in a manner entirely accidental .
The rare earths , forming a group to themselves , and differing so little ( especially in their sub-groups ) in the values of their atomic weights , present an altogether different order of problem to the comparison of K , Rb , and Cs compounds .
The series of rare earths belong to the central groups of the periodic system , in which the electro-positive property is at its minimum , and the chemical characters are so remarkably alike that extraordinary processes and refinement of method * 'Roy .

are necessary in order to separate their compounds from each other .
Extreme closeness of the crystallographic characters of their crystallised salts is , therefore , precisely what one would expect to find .
The very opposite is the case for the alkali metals , which latter were chosen expressly by the author ( Tutton ) as belonging to the first group of the periodic system , exhibiting the electro-positive property at its maximum , while at the same time showing large differences ( 46 between K and Rb and 47 between Rb and Cs ) in atomic weight .
Moreover , the crystal system of the ethylsulphates of the rare earths is the hexagonal , and a comprehensive comparison of the author 's results on the rhombic ( simple sulphates and selenates ) and monoclinic ( double sulphates and selenates ) series has shown that the system of crystallisation has a preponderating effect on the angular differences , the latter being the smaller the higher the degree of symmetry .
It might have been expected , a priori , that the monoclinic pair , say , K2Mg ( S04)2.6H20 and Cs2Mg ( S04)2.6H20 would give closer angular values than the more symmetric rhombic pair , for example , K2S04 and Cs2S04 , since there is a common " dead weight " ; but experience proves the contrary , thus emphasising the effect of difference of system .
Now the hexagonal is a higher system in degree of symmetry than the rhombic , and the angular differences ( which the author found very small yet clear and unmistakeable in the rhombic sulphates and selenates , although not so large as those shown in the monoclinic double salts ) to be expected in the hexagonal system , other factors remaining the same , are still smaller , and might easily fall within the limits 2/ -3/ or thereabouts .
Jaeger has , in fact , realised such a series , and his results are precisely what the author ( Tutton ) would have expected .
It cannot be emphasised too strongly ( a ) that the author 's tables of angles of the whole 31 double sulphates , the 9 double selenates yet investigated , and the whole 10 simple sulphates and selenates , show a general correspondence of mean and calculated values within for the rhombic simple salts and at most 5 ' ( probably only 3 ' ) for the monoclinic double salts , and that the constants given by the author for each individual salt can certainly be relied on within these narrow limits ; and ( b ) that the deductions made by the author , such as the important one regarding the observed progression with the atomic weight of the alkali metal , are unquestionably valid , since the angular differences in question between the salts under comparison are far and away greater than these small limits of possible error , indeed in the maximum amounting to 2|- ' .
The author has no doubt of the probable accuracy of the work of Jaeger , the results agreeing perfectly with the author 's expectations from the high symmetry displayed .
The contribution is , moreover , a very welcome one at the present juncture .
But if Jaeger 's deduction , as the author understands it , is that literally the axial ratio a : cof his hexagonal salts is rigorously the same for all the salts , the minute differences being considered only chance variations from this mean form , then the author must hold that this view is not a reasonable conclusion , and that it cannot be accepted ; it could in any case only be possibly true at some definite temperature .
There can be no doubt , however , that each salt has its own particular crystallographic angular values , and that there are real although very minute angular differences between the crystals of the various salts of the series , in accordance with the law of Hauy , which the author ( Tutton ) considers he has fully substantiated .
This law provides that , except when the symmetry imposes identity of crystal angles ( as in the cubic system and the 90 ' , 45 ' , 60 ' , and 30 ' angles of the tetragonal and hexagonal systems ) , every substance is characterised by its own specific crystalline form , the cases of isomorphism being only close resemblances within the limits of identity of symmetry .
