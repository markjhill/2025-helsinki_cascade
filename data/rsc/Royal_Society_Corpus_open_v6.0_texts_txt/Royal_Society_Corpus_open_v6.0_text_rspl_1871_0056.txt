Corrective Note by Messrs. De La Rue , Stewart , and Loewy to their Paper " On some recent Researches in Solar Physics \amp ; c. " * The erroneous date given in our paper for one of Professor Wolf 's maxima has already been corrected by us , and we give in the subjoined little Table the corrections of the few numerical data which are necessitated by the error of fixing the date of maximum at 1846*6 instead of 1848*6 .

The remark made by us with reference to this maximum ( vide p. 85 ) will remain in force even with the corrected date .
We stated there that this particular maximum showed alone an appreciable difference from the dates fixed by ourselves , for it will be found that Professor Wolf 's date differs still by about f of a year from ours .

" The Action of Oxygen on Copper Nitrate in a state of tension .
" By J. H. Gladstone , Ph. D. , F.R.S. , and Alfred Tribe , P.C.S. Received March 14,1872 .
In our experiments on the action between copper and nitrate of silver in solution , we frequently noticed that the tips of the silver crystals became red , as though coated with a thin layer of metallic copper .
This apparent deposition of a positive on a more negative metal of course raised our curiosity , and led us to look closely into the circumstances under which it occurred .
We found that it took place only when the nitrate of silver was exhausted , and only on those silver crystals which remained in metallic connexion with the copper .
We found , too , that the cupreous coating formed most readily where air had the freest access , and , in fact , that it would not form at all in vessels from which oxygen was excluded , nor on those white crystals which were far below the surface oi the liquid , though they might be in immediate contact with the copper plate .
When an inverted jar was filled with nitrate-of-copper solution and silver crystals resting on branches of copper , and the liquid was displaced by oxygen gas , it was found that the tips of the crystals became red , * Suprtt , p. 82 .
