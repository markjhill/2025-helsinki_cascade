chael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. The author describes , in this supplementary note , experiments made with the view of determining the specific inductive capacities of dielectrics , by means of an apparatus of the following form .
Three circular brass plates were mounted , side by side , on insulated pillars ; the middle one was fixed , but the two outer plates were moveable on slides , so that all three could be brought with their sides almost into contact , or separated to any required distance .
Two gold leaves were suspended in a glass jar from insulated wires , connecting each of the leaves respectively with the adjacent outer plate .
The amount of disturbance in the electric equilibrium of the outer plates produced by interposing a plate of the dielectric substance to be tried , after charging the middle plate , was taken as a measure of the spe ?
cific inductive capacity of that dielectric .
By varying the size and distances of the plates , and also the distance of the gold leaves from one another , new conditions are supplied for the more exact determination of the relative inductive powers of dielectrics of every description ; and by sufficiently reducing the dimensions of the instrument , it may be rendered applicable to comparatively small masses of dielectrics , such as crystals , and even diamonds .
An instrument capable of such universal application the author proposes to designate by the name of Differential Inductometer .
