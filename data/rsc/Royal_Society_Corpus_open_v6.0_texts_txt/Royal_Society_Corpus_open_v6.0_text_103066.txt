DR ~ E ABG ~Ff A ready Description and Quadrature of a Curve of the Third Order , resembling that commonly called the Foliate .
Communicated by Mr. Abr .
de Moivre , F. R. S. I Have looked a little farther into that Curve which fell lately under my consideration .
It is not the Foliate as I did at first imagine , but I believe it ought not to make a Species-distinct from it .
AE B(Fig.1 .
) is the Curve I thus describe .
Let AB and BK be perpendicular to each other .
From the point A draw ARE cutting BK in R , and make RE=B R , the point E belongs to the Curve Draw BC making an Angle of 45 grad .
with A B , this Line BC touches the Curve in B ; from the point E draw ED perpendicular to B C , and calling B D , x ; D E , y ; A B , a ; and making ~8aa=n , the Equation belonging to that Curve is x3 +xxy+xyy+ y3 =nxy or x4 y4/ x y= nxy Taking BG=A B , and drawing GP perpendicular to B G , PG is an Asymptote .
In the Foliate the Equation is x3 + y3 = 1/ 2 nx y~ in which the two Terms xxy~xyy of the former Equation are wanting ; and its Asymptote is distant from B by 1/ 3 B A. Again draw OF perpendicular to A B : let BF be called z and FE v ; the Equation belonging to the Curve AEB is w= azz z3/ a + z. In the Foliate the Equation is w= azz-z3/ a + 3z From these two last Equations it seems that these Curves differ no more from one another than the Circle from the Ellipsis .
I should be very glad to know your Opinion thereupon .
The Quadrature of the Curve here described has something of Simplicity with which I was well pleased .
With the Radius BA and Center B describe a Circle AK G , let the Square HPST circumscribe it , so that HP be parallel to A G : prolong FE till it meet the Circumference of the Circle in M , and through M draw LMQ parallel to H P. The Area BFE is equal to the Area KHL M , comprehended by K H , H L , LM and the Arc K M. And the Area Bfe is equal to the Area KmLH or KMPQ .
Therefore if BF and Bf are equal , the two Areas BF E , Bfe taken together are equal to the Rectangle H Q , and therefore the whole Space comprehended by BEAXBe~GZ ( supposing ~ and Z to be at an infinite Distance ) is equal to the circumscribed Square H S. N. B. This Quadrature is easily demonstrated from the Equation : for by it a+ z:a z : : z z : v v , that is A F : E F : : M F : F B , and so ~F the Fluxion of AF to L~ the Fluxion of M F. Hence the Areola EF~e will be always equal to the Areola ML~ ~ , and therefore the Area AEF always equal to the Area MA L. Hence it appears that this Curve requires the Quadrature of the Circle to square it ; whereas the Foliate is exactly quadrable , the whole Leaf thereof being but one third of the Square of A B , which in this is above three sevenths of the same .
Again in our Curve , the greatest Breadth is when the Point F divides the Line AB in extreme and mean Proportion : whereas in the Foliate it is when AB is triple in power to B F. And the greatest OF or Ordinate in the Foliate is to that of our Curve nearly as 3 to 4 , or exactly as ~ 2/ 3 ~ 1/ 3 1/ 3 to ~5~ 5/ 4 5 1/ 2 .
But still these Differences are not enough to make them two distinct Species , they being both defined by a like Equation , if the Asymptote SGP be taken for the Diameter .
And they are both comprehended under the fortieth Kind of the Curves of the third Order , as they stand enumerated by Sir Isaac Newton , in his incomparable Treatise on that Subject .
