I. Magnetic Observations .
On January 10 the magnetograph needles were dismounted and re-magnetized , having become weakened by age .
Since then work has continued as usual .
The scale values of all the instruments were re-determined in January , in accordance with the practice of previous years , both before and after the re-magnetization of the needles .

" Jan. 12,1881 Balance Jan. 7 , 1881 Jan. 14,1881 Two magnetic storms , or periods of considerable disturbance of the needles , have been registered during the year ; one on the night of January 31st , and a second on September 12th and 13th , both being accompanied by brilliant auroral displays .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been made regularly , and the results are given in the tables forming Appendix I of this Report .
Professor W. Grylls Adams has during the year continued his investigations on the comparison of magnetic distur Dances in various localities .
In addition to the curves mentioned in last year 's Report , he has received through the Committee several supplies of copies of selected traces from Mauritius , Toronto , and Zi-Ka-Wei , near Shanghai , as well as from those Observatories already enumerated in the last report .
Professor Adams has embodied the results of his researches in two papers read before the British Association , and in a Frida)- evening lecture delivered at the Royal Institution .
The discussion of the great magnetic storm of January 31st , 1881 , having been undertaken by Dr. H. Wild , of the Central Physical Observatory , St. Petersburg , such particulars respecting that occurrence as the Committee possessed were transmitted to that gentleman .
The magnetic instruments have been studied , and a knowledge of their manipulation obtained by Lieutenant Moore , R.N. , Dr. Brauner , and Dr. Monckman .
Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various data have been supplied to Professor W. G. Adams , Dr. Atkinson , Dr. Buys Ballot , Mr. Gee , Mr. J. E. H. Gordon , Rev. F. Howlett , M. Mascart , Dr. Muller , Professor Balfour Stewart , and Dr. Wild .

With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to , and published by " The Times , " " The Illustrated London News , " and " The Torquay Directory , " and meteorological data have been supplied to the editor of " Symons 's Monthly Meteorological Magazine , " the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers , Messrs. Buchan , Eaton , Greaves , Gwilliam , McDonald , Rowland , and others .
Report of the KewCommittee .
Rlectroqraph.\#151 ; This instrument has been in continuous action through the year , with the exception of a few occasions during the severe frost of last winter .
n r , , .
, In July the instrument was dismounted , and a fresh supply of acid placed in the jar , the charge-keeping properties of which had become ^The^tabulation of the curves given by this instrument has at last been commenced , and a suitable glass scale , arranged on a plan devised by Mr. Whipple , having been constructed by Mr. Baker , the average hourly tension of atmospheric electricity at the collector of the Electrograph has been determined for every hour m 1880 , except in those cases where registration failed either from disturbance or instrumental defect .
From these values the daily , monthly , and annual means have been deduced , together with other facts bearing on the relations existing between atmospheric electricity and different meteorological phenomena Some results of this investigation were by permission of the Meteorological Council submitted by the Superintendent to the Meeting of the British Association at York , m a paper which has since been ordered by the General Committee to be printed in among their Reports .
The expense of the tabulation was defrayed by a special grant from the Meteorological Council .
III .
Solar Observations .
The only solar work done at Kew during the past year has been the regular maintenance of the eye observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , as described in the Report for 1872 , These have been made on 187 days , in order to preserve the continuity of the Kew records of sun-spots .
The sun 's surface was observed to be free from spots on three of those days .
A small portable 2J in .
refracting telescope , with a magnifying power of 42 diameters , is used by the observer .
Transit Observations.\#151 ; Ninety-four observations have been made of sun-transits , for the purpose of obtaining correct local time at the Observatory : 126 clock and chronometer comparisons have also been made .
In addition to these a considerable number of star transits have been observed in connexion with the pendulum operations in pi ogress during the autumn of 1881 .

Experimental Work .
Winstanless Recording Radiograph\#151 ; This instrument , designed for the purpose of registering continuously the amount of radiation from the sky , by mechanical means , upon a sheet of blackened paper , still *4 Report of the Kew Committee .
remains at the Observatory , bat having been accidentally deranged it has not been at work for some months .
The inventor being abroad it has not been possible to place it in re-adjustment hf'ephoscopes , \#151 ; Experiments have been made with several forms of nephoscope designed by Mr. F. Galton , and also with a new cloud-camera , designed by the Superintendent .
Exposure of Thermometers.\#151 ; Experiments have been continued throughout the year at the Observatory , with the view of determining the relative merits of different patterns of thermometer screens .
For this purpose there were erected in 1879 on the lawn a Stevenson 's screen , of the ordmay pattern , and a large wooden cage , containing a Wild s screen , of the pattern employed in Russia .
Each of these screens contains a dry and a wet bulb thermometer , and a maximum and minimum , all of which are read daily at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. , their indications being compared with those of the thermograph at the same ours .
A third portable metal screen , designed by Mr. De La Rue for use on board Light-ships , which contains a dry bulb thermometer only , is also earned into the open air by the observer , and read at the same time as the fixed instruments .
Council C'St 'f theSe eXperiments is borne hy the Meteorological Glycerine Barometer.\#151 ; This instrument , devised and erected by Mr. Jordan , has remained in successful operation throughout the year In compliance with the request of the inventor , it has been continuously observed five times daily , in conjunction with the mercurial barometer .
Mr. Jordan has been supplied with copies of the observations , but the Committee have not yet , however , been informed of the results of these comparisons .
Pendulvm Experiments.\#151 ; In March , the Committee received a communication from the Council of the Royal Society , calling their attention to the fact that the invariable pendulums deposited in the Loan Collection of scientific instruments at South Kensington , could not be considered as in the custody of the Committee , and in consequence the Science and Art Department was requested to return the instruments to the Observatory .
They were accordingly received on the 15th of June .
Subsequently an application was received from Major Herschel , R.E. , F.R.S. , by authority of the India Office , for permission to make certain experiments with the pendulums , and for the loan of the instruments , with their accompanying appliances , with facilities for prosecuting the experiments at the Observatory .
These requests were granted , and since the beginning of September operations have been continuously carried on , both in the Pendulum Room and in the Experimental House at Kew .
Report of the Kew Committee .
The Indian Government will defray all expenses that may be incurred in the prosecution of the experiments .
V. Verification of Instruments .
The following magnetic instruments have been verified , and their constants have been determined:\#151 ; A set of Self-recording Magnetographs for the Nice Observatory .
A Unifilar Magnetometer for Casella .
Three Dip Circles for Casella .
A pair of Dipping Needles for Elliott Brothers .
There have also been purchased on commission and verified : A Unifilar Magnetometer and Dip Circle for Professor Tacchim , Rome .

Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 20 cases .
-Report of the Ke Committee .
Ten Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated and divided and supplied to societies and individuals during the year .

Index Glasses for ditto , unmounted Horizon , , " 55 55 Coloured Shades " " There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification , 8 Barometers , 395 Thermometers , and 7 Hydrometers .
A considerable increase having taken place in the number of Sextants submitted for verification , the Committee , after due consideration , have withdrawn the old form of certificate of examination , and substituted a more general statement of the efficiency of the instrument , recognising in future two classes of sextant ; Class A in which the total error of the instrument , from any cause , nowhere exceeds thirty seconds ; and Class B where the limit is a maximum error of three minutes of arc .
Ihe schedule of fees payable for the verification of instruments has been revised , and copies of the new scale , together with particulars as to the transmission , \amp ; c. , of instruments to and from the Observatory for the purpose of comparison , have been widely distributed amongst opticians and instrument makers .
Standard Barometers.\#151 ; From time to time comparisons have been made between the two Welsh Standard Barometers , the old Royal Society Standard , and Newman No. 34 , the working Standard of the Observatory .
The Portable Standards of the Observatory have also been employed in making comparisons of the Standard Barometers at the Hydrographic Office , Admiralty , the University Museum , Oxford , and the Royal Engineering College , Cooper 's Hill .
A metal plate , engraved with an inscription stating the history of the old Royal Society Standard Barometer , and giving details of the method employed in filling it on the occasion of its recent repair , has now been affixed to the instrument .
The large difference formerly observed in the heights of the mercurial column in the flint and crown glass tubes of this barometer , has not been found to exist in the refilled tubes , and the mean difference between their indications is now less than OOOl inch .
Standard Thermometers.\#151 ; The Committee has exchanged Standard Thermometers with the Johns Hopkins University , U.S.A. , Professor Rowland having on the occasion of his recent visit to this country Report of the Kew Committee .
presented the Observatory with a Standard\#151 ; Bandin 7835\#151 ; which he lias compared very closely with his other standard instruments .
" The Committee has received very gratifying testimony as to the accuracy of the Standard Thermometers constructed at the Observatory .
In a paper contributed to the " American Journal of Science , " Dr. Leonard Waldo , of the Winchester Observatory , Yale College , U.S.A. , remarks that after a critical examination of three Kew Standard Thermometers , in which every degree was separately measured , entailing no less than 2,300 micrometer readings , he came to the conclusion that their errors are practically insensible and too small to be detected with certainty .
Professors Thorpe and Rucker have also been engaged in testing very minutely three similar instruments made for them at Kew .
In a paper read at York before the British Association , Professor Rucker stated " they had subjected the Kew Thermometers to the most rigorous test possible , and they were able to announce that in one instrument the errors left , after the application of Welsh 's method of calibration and graduation , were not greater than four thousandths of a degree Centigrade , and in no case did they much exceed one-hundredth of a degree .
As it is impossible to read on these thermometers less than a hundredth of a degree with certainty , Welsh 's method as applied at Kew is almost perfect .
" YI .
Aid to Observatories .
Waxed Papers , fyc .
, supplied.\#151 ; Waxed paper has been supplied to the following Observatories :\#151 ; Aberdeen , Adelaide , Armagh , Bengal ( Meteorological Department ) , Colaba , Falmouth , Glasgow , Mauritius , Paris ( Montsouris ) , Oxford ( Radclrffe ) , Utrecht , Stonyhurst , St. Petersburgh .
A.nemograph Sheets have been sent to the Mauritius Observatory , and Blank Magnetic Observation Forms have been supplied to Professor Remold , Royal Naval College ; Professor Louis Perard , l'Universite de Liege ; Professor Pointing , Mason 's Science College , Birmingham ; and to Mr. Casella .
VII .
Miscellaneous .
Loan Exhibition.\#151 ; The instruments specified in the Report for 1876 still remain in charge of the Science and Art Department , South Kensington , with the exception of the Invariable Pendulum Apparatus recently withdrawn , as already stated , and the few articles mentioned in previous reports . .
Fog Prevalence.\#151 ; At the request of the Meteorological Council the Report of the K.ew Committee .
Meteorological Registers of the Observatory were searched from 1848 to the end of 1880 , and an enumeration made of all the observations of fog ana mist recorded in them .
The cost of the examination was defrayed by the Council .
Lost Journals.\#151 ; On going through the books of the Observatory for the purpose of compiling the above-mentioned tables , it was found that the volumes containing observations made between January and June 1845 , and August 1848 , and December 1853 , were missing On makmg inquiry it was discovered that the volumes containing the MSS .
results for 1845 and 1849 to 1851 were in the library bequeathed by the late Sir F. Ronalds to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians , and the Council of that Society most courteously directed these records to be restored to the custody of the Kew Committee , which has been done .
Further search has failed to bring to light any regular records of observations made between April 1851 , and January 1854 ; and it is believed that none were made during the interval which elapsed between the discontinuance of the system of observations organised under the superintendence of Sir F. Ronalds and that established by Mr. J. Welsh , after his own appointment as Superintendent .
Complete specimen sets of curves from the various photographic and autographic instruments in use at the Observatory have been prepared and forwarded to the exhibitions of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society , Yorkshire Fine Art and Industrial Institution , Richmond Industrial and Fine Art Loan Exhibition , and the International Photographic Exhibition at Vienna .
At the latter exhibition a silver medal was awarded to the Committee for their exhibit .
The Superintendent has , with the consent of the Committee , read the following papers before the Meteorological Society , all of which have been published in the " Quarterly Journal " of the Society 1 .
" On the Variations of Relative Humidity and Thermometric Dryness of the Air , with Changes of Barometric Pressure at the Kew Observatory , " vol. vii , p. 49 .

Workshop .
The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus , such as the Whitworth Lathe and Planing Machine , procured by Grants from Report of the Kew Committee .
either the Government Grant Funds or the Donation Fund , for the use of the Kew Observatory , have been kept in thorough order , and many of them are in constant , and others in occasional , use at the Observatory , but the funds of the Committee do not allow of the employment of a mechanical assistant , although one is much needed .
Library.\#151 ; During the year the Library has received , as presents , the publications of 13 English Scientific Societies and Institutions , and 72 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Societies and Institutions .
Ventilation Experiments.\#151 ; The experiments on the ventilating power of cowls of different form by the Sub-Committee of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain are still in progress in the wooden hut erected by the Institute near the Observatory , the experimental house lent by the Committee having been required for the testing of Magnetographs and other purposes .
Observatory and Grounds.\#151 ; The buildings and grounds have been kept in repair throughout the year , and the exterior woodwork has been painted by the Board of Works .
The basement of the building having been again flooded , a drain has been laid across the park to the riverside to allow of flood-waters flowing directly into the river instead of requiring to be pumped out as has hitherto been necessary .
The roofs of the Verification House and Magnetic Observatory have been entirely re-covered with felt , and new gutters fitted , \amp ; c. No action having been taken by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests with respect to the footpath across the park , its temporary repair has , however , been carried on at the expense of the Committee .

Jll M Report of the Kew Committee .
APPENDIX I. Magnetic Observations made at the Kew , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " N. Long. Oh 1 " 15sl W. , for the year October 1880 to September 1881 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnets N D and NO being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3\#163 ; inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the unit in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme ' the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0*46108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given .
The value of log tt2K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at temperature 60 ' F. The induction-coefficient jn is 0*000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' F. is 0*0001194(^\#151 ; 35 ) +0*000,000,213(*0\#151 ; 35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , whem the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1*0 foot and 1*3 feet , are 1*000075 feet and 1*300097 feet respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have oeen made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental read-ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , was determined by the late Mr. Welsh , and has since been carefully verified .
The observations have all been made and reduced by Mr. F. G. Figg .
