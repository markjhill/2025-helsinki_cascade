On [ July 17 , " On the ' Blaze-currents ' of the Incubated Hen 's Egg .

( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , S.W. ) In previous communications to the Society , on the Eyeball , * on the Skin , t and on Leguminous Seeds , j I have reported the results of experiments conducted by aid of an electrical criterion distinguishing between the living and not-living state .
The present communication contains the results of a series of systematic observations on the hen 's egg by aid of the same distinguishing test\#151 ; or blaze reaction , as I was led to designate it when it first came under my observation in the case of the frog 's eyeball .
The case of the hen 's egg is particularly interesting , for while we cannot tell a priori with any assurance whether or no a dormant egg will give the reaction characteristic , of living matter , we may\#151 ; after having learned by experience that it does not do so\#151 ; expect to find the reaction make its appearance with the progress of development by incubation .
And as a matter of fact , we find that this is what happens .
I first tested several eggs of unknown origin , bringing electrodes into contact with the superior and inferior extremities of a vertical short diameter of the egg laid upon its side .
On account of the resistance of the shell , a small piece was removed on each side , and the electrodes brought into contact with the subjacent unbroken shell-membrane .
There was no blaze in either direction , but only slight polarisation counter-currents of O'OOOl to 0*0002 volt .
A similar result was obtained when the yolk was laid bare and the superior electrode applied directly to the cicatricula , both with the egg at ordinary room-temperature ( 20 ' ) and in an incubator at 37c .
I then proceeded to test a series of ten fresh eggs reputed " fertile " and fit for incubation .
The results were briefly as follows :\#151 ; Egg No. 1 , at the end of 24 hours ' incubation , gave a small ascending blaze .
Egg No. 2 , at the end of 48 hours , gave a similar but rather more distinct effect .

] " Blaze-currents " of the Incubated Hen 's Egg No. 3 , also at the end of 48 hours , gave large effects in both directions , larger and more persistent in the upward than in the downward direction .
The difference between the reactions of these two eggs was in obvious correlation with their unequal degree of development , for whereas in No. 2 an area vasculosa was only just apparent at one border , in No. 3 it was well formed , and the heart was observed pulsating for more than 12 hours after exposure of the blastoderm .
No. 4 ( 72 hours ) reacted well in both directions , and was normal .
No. 5 ( 72 hours ) gave me pause .
In spite of repeated trial I could not obtain a trace of the reaction that I expected to obtain .
Every stimulus of whatever strength and direction gave rise to a slight counter-effect .
But the explanation of the result was forthcoming when the egg was opened .
No development whatever had taken place .
No. 6 ( 72 hours ) gave normal reaction in both directions .
Development was normal .
No. 7 ( 96 hours ) , normal reactions and normal development .
Reaction abolished by rise of temperature with embryo exposed .

No. 10 ( 12th day of incubation ) gave no blaze in either direction , only polarisation .
The contents of the egg were rotten .
The above series of results was evidently in accordance with the fundamental fact .
There was no exception to rule in any of the ten trials .
Certain of these ten observations were taken in closer detail in order to get at information as to relation between stimulus and response , effect of strong electrical stimulation , \amp ; c. , and although these matters will demand considerable further investigation , some of the results may be described now .
This first series , by no means satisfactory from a chicken-farmer 's point of view , was practically conclusive for my purpose , which was to learn whether the presence or absence of a living embryo could be diagnosed from the presence or absence of blaze-currents .
Other trials made at times of year still more unfavourable as regards probability of development , viz. , in August and in November , gave results that were equally satisfactory from my point of view .
Thus in the second series , No. 1 after 32 hours ' incubation gave small blaze effects of \#177 ; 00010 volt in both directions ; the blastoderm was the size of a sixpence , and there was no sign of circulation .
Nos. 2 186 Dr. A. D. Waller .
the [ July 17 , and 3 were used in the absence of incubation for a careful examination of the exposed blastoderms , one at normal temperature , the other at 38 ' ; polarisation currents were alone observable in these two cases , amounting to \#177 ; 0*0002 volt .
Nos. 4 , 5 , and 6 at 50 and 58 hours gave positive blaze of only 0*0030 and 0*0010 volt , and their blastoderms were found to be very defective .
Nos. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 gave no blaze whatever , only the usual small counter-deflections of \#177 ; 0*0002 volt due to polarisation , and on being opened exhibited no sign of development .
Incidentally to this first series of trials I noted that:\#151 ; 1 .
The " normal current , " from a developing egg , led oft'as described , is positive or ascending , and if the egg is left undisturbed diminishes during observation .
I consider it to be a " manipulation blaze " due to handling of the egg and disturbance of the embryo .
It is presumably the current first pointed out by Hermann and von Gendre in their statement that the embryo is positive to any other part of the egg contents , i.e. , that there is a current from content to embryo.* Fig. 1 .

The embryo is easily exhausted and killed by repeated excitations of moderate and of excessive strength .

] shocks at intervals of 5 or 6 minutes .
By strong tetanisation the reaction is completely abolished ; the chick has been " electrocuted .
" In a third series of ten trials upon " fresh eggs " from a London shop , and at a very unfavourable time of year as regards development , the results were as clear as could be desired .
At the end of 12 days of incubation nine of these eggs returned what was by this time familiar to me as a negative answer , viz. , small counter-currents due to polarisation , and all the nine showed no sign of development ; only a single egg gave blaze-currents of \#177 ; 0,0010 volt , and was found to have developed to the extent usual at the end of 24 hours under ordinarily favourable conditions .
In the following year ( 1902 ) I returned to the subject and made two further series of observations , paying particular attention to the direction of blaze-currents of the first few days of incubation .
In the interval between these observations and those of the previous year I had studied the currents of mucous membranes , with the general , but by no means invariable , result that the blaze-currents are of ingoing direction .
I therefore expected to find , and did find , that the response of an early blastoderm to either direction of current is of positive or ascending direction , i.e. , ingoing as regards the hypoblast , and outgoing as regards the epiblast .
I also took the opportunity of testing active eggs on what has been described in previous papers* as the ABC plan , i.e. , after excitation through A , the superior pole , and B , the inferior pole of the egg , the lead-off to the galvanometer through A C was found to be effective ( outgoing current at A ) , and the lead-off ' through B C ineffective .
The response was outgoing or positive at A after both directions of excitation between A B. The method of observation is further illustrated by the following table and plates .
Plates 1939-40 taken on the 6th egg ( 72 hours ) are given in detail to show how the magnitude of response varies with 1939-40 .

The presence of a blaze-current is a certain sign that development has progressed within the egg .
190 Dr. A. D. Waller .
the [ July 17 , In the early stages\#151 ; when presumably the blastodermic membrane has not yet become folded to form a tubular embryo\#151 ; the blaze-currents aroused by both directions of excitation are positive or ascending .
At a more advanced stage of development the blaze-currents are usually homodrome with the direction of excitation , viz. , positive or ascending after a positive or ascending excitation , and negative or descending after a negative or descending excitation .
In some cases , but with such infrequency as to deserve to be characterised as exceptional , both responses have been observed to occur in a negative or descending direction .
This may have been due to attachment of the embryo to the shell .
[ I have made a few observations on frog 's spawn , and although these have not yet been sufficient to enable me to specify the conditions of the presence or absence of the reaction , I think that the fact of its presence is worth reporting , as well as the further fact that in some cases of undoubtedly living spawn I have failed to detect it .
