" Second Appendix to a paper entitled 'Discovery that the Veins of the Bat 's Wing ( which are furnished with valves ) are endowed with rythmical contractility .
' " By T. Wharton Jones , Esq. , F.R.S. &amp;c. The author states that , from a microscopical examination of the blood-vessels and circulation in the ears of the long-eared bat , he has ascertained that , different from what he had discovered to be the case in the wings , the veins of the ears are unfurnished with valves , and are not endowed with rythmical contractility , and that the onward flow of blood in them is consequently uniform .
