] The work of which an account is given in the following pages was carried out in the winter of 1887-88 , and forms a sequel to much of a similar character already published by the authors , on methyl , ethyl , and isopropyl alcohols , on ethyl oxide , on acetic acid , and on a mixture of alcohol and ether ( 'Phil .
Trans./ 1886 , Part I. , p. 123 ; 1887 , A. , p. 57 ; 1887 , A. , p. 313 ; 1889 , A. , p. 137 ; ' Chem. Soc. Trans./ 1886 , p. 790 ; 1887 , p. 755 ) .
The apparatus with which it was carried out has been fully described in the memoir on ether ( loc. cit. ) .
The only important change was in the nature of the glass tubes used to contain the liquid under experiment .
While , in the case of the alcohols , ether , \amp ; c. , lead glass proved the best material for tubes , it is too easily attacked by water .
At comparatively low temperatures it becomes etched , and it is impossible to take readings .
Moreover , the water dissolves a not inconsiderable quantity of potassium silicate ; tubes of green boiler-gauge glass were , therefore , substituted for tubes of lead glass .
This glass consists of a silicate of calcium and potassium , con-taining a trace of ferrous iron ( Si02 = 71'20 ; CaO=14'99 ; K20 = 13T9 ; Total , 99*38 .
) They withstand a higher pressure than lead-glass tubes , and they are attacked with difficulty .
Even after an exposure of several days to liquid water at 280 ' C. , only 0'7 per cent , of residue remained on evaporating the water .
Inasmuch as some of the material of the glass is dissolved , however , the water cannot be considered to be absolutely pure , but the results may be given as the best attainable with water in contact with glass .
It may be advisable to state here again , that the pressures were read from gauges containing dry air , kept at a known temperature by jackets of running water ; and that they are corrected for deviation from Boyle 's law by help of experiments made by Amagat ( 'Compt .
Rend./ vol. 99 , p. 1153 ) ; that the temperatures are those of an air-thermometer , and that they were secured by jacketing the tube containing the water with the vapours of pure chlorobenzene , bromobenzene , aniline , methyl-salicylate , or bromonaphthalene , of which the vapour-pressures corresponding to known temperap 2 26.4.92 tures have been determined by us ( 'Chem .
Soc. Trans./ vol. 47 , p. 640 ) .
By causing one or other of these liquids to boil under definite known pressures , any desired temperature , within certain limits , was attainable ; and , as a small alteration of temperature corresponds to a considerable alteration of pressure , it may be taken for certain that the temperatures are practically correct .
The expansion of the glass made use of for the volume tube was carefully determined , and a correction was in all cases applied , so that the apparent volumes are reduced to real volumes .
No correction , however , was applied for the alteration in the volume tube due to internal pressure , because an estimation of its amount showed it to be much within the error of reading volume .
The results may be classified under three heads :\#151 ; I. Expansion of liquid water .
II .
Vapour-pressures .
Ill Density of unsaturated and saturated steam .
I. Expansion of Liquid Water .
For these experiments , the tube was two-thirds filled with water freed from air by boiling in vacuo .
That no air was present was often proved during the experiments by condensing a bubble of steam ; condensation always took place without appreciable rise of pressure .
The weight of water taken was deduced from observations of its volume at the ordinary temperature , both before and after experiment .
The results are as follows :\#151 ; Temperature .

The small difference is probably due to adherence of liquid to the lower portions of the tube , which had become etched during the experiments .

Vapour-pressures .
The pressures of the vapour were read from experiments with a larger quantity of water in the tube , as well as when the quantity was small ; but uniform results were not obtained .
The vapour-pressure of water , unlike that of other liquids , depends to some extent on the amount of substance present.* ' This is to be attributed to the fact , that with only a small amount of liquid present , a relatively large surface of the tube is exposed to the vapour , and , as there can be no doubt that the vapour adheres to the surface , the pressure is lowered to a certain extent .
The results , with the larger quantity , are therefore given as probably more correct .
Each pressure is the mean of some seven or eight readings in which the relative volumes of water and steam were altered within the greatest limits which the tube allowed .
The pressures are , as before stated , corrected for deviations from Boyle 's law .
Lo facilitate comparison , the results obtained by Begnault and others are placed in juxtaposition with ours ; and also columns showing the differences between our results and those obtained in other ways .
The columns are distinguished as follows :\#151 ; " It .

It has the merit of allowing temperature to be calculated from pressure , as easily as the converse ; the results , however , calculated in each way , are not absolutely the same , but do not differ to any important extent .

M. Brooch has undertaken a most laborious investigation of the formulae employed for the calculation of the vapour-pressures of water , adopting finally the one given in the table .
The utmost care was taken to obtain the best possible results from the data taken ; but , unfortunately , M. Brooch has accepted Begnault 's conclusion that the curve representing the vapour-pressures of ice is continuous with that obtained from the vapour-pressures of water , and he has employed the whole of the data from \#151 ; 32 ' to 100 ' .
By the method of calculation of the constants for the formula , this source of error has been to a certain extent eliminated , as is shown by the comparison ( p. 31 ) of Begnault 's individual observations with the pressures calculated from the formula .
In this table it is seen that below \#151 ; 5 ' , out of 31 comparisons , the calculated pressures are higher than those observed in every case but one .
The error is , however , only partially eliminated , and this probably explains the fact that the formula , with the constants given , will not bear extrapolation above 100 ' even to 120 ' , though it is supposed to hold good through a range of 132 ' .
It is to be feared that the results between 0 ' and 100 ' may even be to some extent vitiated by this source of error\#151 ; a most unfortunate circumstance , considering the enormous amount of labour bestowed on the work , and the fact that the pressures calculated from the formula have received the imprimatur of the Bureau International .
It is to be noticed that Begnault 's formula K gives results nearest the truth , but that fairly approximate results are also obtainable by the use of Unwin 's and of Antoine 's formulae .
These formulae , it need hardly be remarked , are all empirical .

THE PROPERTIES OF WATER AND OF STEAM .
III .
The Densities of the Saturated and Unsaturated Vapour of Water at Different Temperatures and Pressures .
The method pursued was ( 1 ) to find the weight of the small quantity of water in the tube by ascertaining the values of the products of pressure and volume at large volumes and at high temperatures .
If these products , for slight decrease of volume , and at any one temperature , were sensibly constant , and if the products at different temperatures bore to one another the same ratio as that between the absolute temperatures , it was assumed that the vapour-density of the steam was normal ; if hydrogen be taken as unity , the density is nine .
The weight could then be calculated by the equation given in the Appendix , p. 122 .
( 2 ) The volume of the gas was then diminished by regular decrements at temperatures rising by 10 ' at a time , and the pressure corresponding to each volume was read .
From these data the volume of 1 grm. in cubic centimetres could be calculated .
When the volume was sufficiently diminished condensation ensued .
Two distinct sets of experiments were made : one with a large tube at low temperatures , and one with a strong pressure tube at high temperatures .
The actual experimental data for high temperatures ( 120 ' to 270 ' ) are given on pp. 124-127 of the Appendix ; those at low temperatures on pp. 128-130 .
Reasons are there adduced to show that when the pressure approaches the vapour-pressure condensation on the glass occurs .
This causes the pressure to be lower than it should be for a given volume , and renders the results very difficult to interpret .
Such adhesion appears to be slight at large volumes where the vapour is unsaturated ; but , as it occurs gradually , the effect is that on decreasing volume some water is left below the mercury , and as there is no clue to the amount thus trapped the weight is diminished by an unknown amount .
But it is reckoned as undiminished , and hence in calculating the volume of 1 grm. from the actual measurements the volume ascribed is too small , and too small by an unknown quantity .
At the same time the pressure is lowered by the adhesion to the glass , and so the curve is distorted as it approaches the pressure of the saturated vapour .
Under the circumstances it appeared best to follow the experimental results as closely as possible .
However interesting from a theoretical point of view the absolute expansion of water-gas may be , in practice it is always in contact with a surface ; and although it is probable that the material , as well as the extent of the surface , would influence the amount of adhesion , yet an indication of the behaviour of steam in contact with glass cannot fail to be of use in considering the practical case of steam in contact with iron .
Moreover , the error is to a great extent eliminated by making use of the volumes of 1 grm. of saturated steam calculated from Regnault 's heats of vaporization .
Q Ranking ( \#166 ; Edinb .
Trans. , ' vol. 23 , Part I. , 1862 , p. 147 ) discusses the want of concordance between the volumes of saturated steam obseived by Fairbairn and Tate , and those calculated from Regnault 's observations on the heats of vaporization ; and suggests a difference in molecular condition between steam at rest , as in Fairbairn and Tate 's experiments , and in motion , as in Regnaiilt 's .
It can scarcely be doubted that the true reason of the discrepancy is to be found in the adhesion of steam to glass .
It is obvious that in Regnault 's experiments this source of error would be absent , inasmuch as the weight of water was simply that which entered the calorimeter .
Three sets of isothermal curves were drawn in which the experimental numbers were closely followed , the only adjustment being that of rendering the curves as smooth as possible , and of making use of the mutual relations between the curves , so as to smooth out the irregularities of each individual one .
These curves were prolonged to the points calculated from Begnault 's observations by the formula s i \#151 ; LJ T dpf + S-2\gt ; where sland s2 are respectively the volumes of saturated vapour and liquid , L the heat of vaporization , J the mechanical equivalent of heat , T absolute temperature , and dpfdt the differential of pressure in degrees with respect to temperature .
By help of this formula the following table was calculated :\#151 ; THE PROPERTIES OF WATER AND OF STEAM .

As Regnault 's measurements do not extend beyond 230 ' the higher isothermals were smoothed as well as possible and made to cut the vapour-pressure lines at certain points , to which we were guided to some extent by their own regularity , and to some extent by extending the curve drawn to pass through the points representing the volumes of 1 grm. of saturated vapour .
The results cannot be far from the truth .
The next table shown was constructed by reading the pressures and temperatures corresponding to equal volumes .

Regnault 's results interpreted as vapour-density obviously increase at too slow a rate above 210 ' , while ours appear to increase too rapidly at 240 ' , 250 ' , and 260 ' .
We therefore constructed a curve showing the relationship of vapour-densities from all sources to temperature ; the numbers given as " smoothed " are read from the curve , and the volumes of 1 grm. were again calculated .
In a series of papers published in the ' .Philosophical Magazine ' ( 1887 , vol. 27 , pp. 196 and 435 ) , we showed that for ether , ethyl alcohol , and carbon dioxide , the pressures of the vapours of these substances for constant volumes are , within limits of experimental error , a rectilinear function of the temperature , or \#151 ; a , where a and b are two constants , depending on the volume , and t is the absolute temperature .
Carl Barus , as the result of experiments with other substances , has confirmed the statement , both for liquid and gas .
He states ( 'Phil .
Mag. , ' 1890 , vol. 30 , p. 358 ) that " below 1000 atmospheres , the curves for ether , alcohol , thymol , diphenylamine , and toluidine , are so nearly linear that they may be accepted as such with an error no larger than 2 or 3 degrees at 1000 atmospheres .
" He also found that in the case of water the rectilinear relation does not hold .
If an isochoric diagram be constructed from the results given on p. 116 , it will be seen that , except at small volumes , the isochoric lines are approximately straight , but curve considerably on approaching the condensation points .
The lines should probably , as Bares found , be curved throughout , but no considerable error is introduced in considering them as straight during the major part of their course .
Indeed , accepting Regnault 's determinations as correct , it would appear that at temperatures above 140 ' , the curvature cannot be due to premature condensation , since the isothermal curves given in the diagram have been drawn , as already stated , to coincide with the results of Regnault 's work on the heats of vaporization , and yet coincide with our experimental results , except at volumes very close to those at which liquefaction takes place ; and at such small volumes , surface condensation is unmistakeable .
On reference to the Appendix , p. 128 , an account of experiments at much lower temperatures will be found .
These show that the relative effect of surface condensation is much more marked at low than at high temperatuies .
Thus , at about 30 millims. pressure the vapour-density calculated at 75 is 9 01 ; at 50 , 9 46 , at 40 , 9 90 ; and at 30 ' , 10'70 .
An increase of pressure does not appear to raise the apparent vapour-density to the same extent as a fall of temperatuie .
This may explain why an increase of pressure , at high temperatures , does not influence surface condensation appreciably , except very close to the point of condensation .
In addition to the work of Regnault , that of Fairbairn and Tate on the densities of unsaturated and saturated steam may be mentioned .
As their results were given in English units , we think it well to reproduce them here in the same form as has been adopted in this paper .
It will be seen that the densities of the saturated vapour show a gradual rise with increase of temperature , although the results of individual experiments are far from regular .

As these agree absolutely with the results calculated from Regnault 's measurements , and as neither the method adopted by Hirn , nor bis individual observations would appear to lead one to anticipate such concordance , we would suggest that it may be attributed to the " trace de sentimentr with which he credits the assistant who interpreted his results .
In conclusion , it may be noted that Regnault made experiments on the densities of saturated steam at low temperatures for hygrometric purposes , and has shown that it is practically normal at temperatures between 0 ' and 27 ' ( ' Annals de Chimie ' [ 3 ] , vol. 15 , 1845 , p. 129 , et .seg .
) .
Note.\#151 ; In Plate 7 the curves representing the relations of temperature , pressure , and volume of unsaturated and saturated steam are given on a scale large enough , we hope , to prove of practical use .
For this purpose they have been divided into three sets , a different scale , however , being applied to each set .
The pi'essures are given in metres of mercury ; the volumes , in cubic centimetres per gramme .
The heavy line shows the volumes of saturated vapour , and may be termed the orthobaric line .

Two series of experiments were made .
The weight of the water in the tube was ascertained by determining the products of pressure and volume , altering the volumes , and this was repeated at different temperatures .
Assuming that if these products for any one temperature were constant , the density of the steam was constant , viz. , the theoretical density , 9 , the weight could be ascertained by the equation V.D. x p.v x 273 W T 111636 x 1000 x 760 x ( 273 + t ) ' This expression simplifies to log W = log p.v. + 4*46179 - log ( 273 + During the progress of the experiments it happened that a trace of water passed up the tube , adding itself to that already present .
This , of course , increased the weight , hence new measurements were made to determine the amount of the increase .

These results can be verified by taking the weight at 270 ' as a standard , and calculating the smaller weights by the equation p.v. 273 + tl 273 + V : : W : W ' identical numbers with those found are obtained .
Hence the largest weight at 250 ' , 260 ' , and 270 ' is 0*002664 grm. ; the second weight at 250 ' , 240 ' , and 230 ' is 0*002588 grm. ; the first weight at 220 ' and 230 ' is 0*002547 grm. The first weight holds also for lower temperatures .
These data are adduced as a proof of the relative accuracy of the determinations which follow .

n considering these results it is seen that , as a rule , the density increases on d munshing volume this , however , cannot be ascribed to real increase of density , but to diminution of the actual weight of the water present in the state of vapour hrough adhesion of water to the surface of the tube .
That this explanation is the correct one is seen from the following considerations .
^ , A* 7f , Very 'ittle \#153 ; e of vapour-density is to be observed , although there is a slight tendency towards a h.gher value at the smallest volumes , ^pressure was never near the vapour-pressure , which at this temperature is 288'5 millings THE PROPERTIES OF WATER AND OF STEAM .
At 50 ' , at which the vapour-pressure is 92 millims. , the vapour-densities are all high , but do not rise rapidly after the first one .
The highest pressure registered ( 70'75 ) approached the vapour-pressure .
At 40 ' the vapour-pressure is 54*9 ; the highest pressure read was 54T .
The rise of vapour-density is slow at first , and afterwards more rapid .
At 30 ' the vapour-pressure is 31 '55 millims. , while the highest pressure read was 31*05 millims. The vapour-densities are very high , and rise rapidly with decrease of volume ; and at 25 ' the vapour-pressure is 23*55 milliips .
, the highest pressure read being 23*35 .
Again , there is a rapid increase of density with diminishing volume .
These pressures are all somewhat lower than the values given by Hegnault .

In this case there was no possibility of condensation of vapour on the lower part of the tube , while previously , when readings were begun at the largest volume , condensation might have taken place on the lower part of the tube .
If , therefore , the high vapour-densities are due to adhesion and condensation , the value of this reading at 40 ' should be lower than it was found in the first series .
This is in fact the case , as is shown by the following determinations :\#151 ; Tempera- ture .

first series , 149*1 , is a little more than twice as great as the largest volume in the second ; therefore , as the tube was cylindrical , the surface on which condensation could take place was about twice as great .
If the condensation is not much affected by the rise of pressure from 19*15 millims. at the largest volume of the first series to 42'05 millims. at the largest volume of the second , and if the high vapour-density is entirely due to condensation , we should expect the error to be about half as great in the second as in the first series , and this is approximately the case .
It will be noticed that the weight of the water in both sets is nearly the same .
The tube was again heated to 100 ' , and the external pressure so arranged that the volume of vapour remained about 56 cub. centims. After cooling , the tube was again heated to 40 ' , and a reading was taken with the following results:\#151 ; Tempera- ture .

o millims. c.c. 40 52-3 54-87 10-00 The result is not much lower than at the corresponding volume in the last experiment , but the gain of surface was not very great , and the pressure , 52*3 millims. , was very near the condensing pressure , 5 4'9 millims. ; and it is to be noticed that the vapour-density rises rapidly as this pressure is approached .
At the same pressure in the first series , the vapour-density observed was 10'77\#151 ; a much higher value , The experiments show that the high vapour-densities are due to condensation on the walls of the tube , and that the error due to this cause may vary considerably , especially at pressures near the true vapour pressures .
Similar experiments were not made at high pressures , but on constructing isothermal curves , it is seen that as the volume diminishes , and as the vapour-pressure is approached , the curves instead of cutting the vapour-pressure line so as to form an angle , as is the case with the other liquids which we have examined , gradually turn and run nearly parallel to the vapour-pressure line at a somewhat lower pressure .
When a considerable amount of liquid has condensed , the true vapour-pressure is reached , dhis behaviour is analogous to that of a mixture of a condensible vapour with a gas like air ; but it cannot be attributed to such admixture , for the last bubble of steam left on raising pressure was easily and quickly absorbed , and without any perceptible rise of pressure .
Its cause must , as already explained , lie in the adhesion of the vapour to the glass , causing condensation before the true vapour-pressure is reached .
