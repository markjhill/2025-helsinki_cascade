On the Extinction of Light hy an Illuminated .
147 differences cannot be considered as a shift of the bands , since the entire character and intensity of the absorption varies in different solvents .
2 .
The apparent gradual shifts observed when one acid radicle is replaced by another can be simply explained by the superposition of absorption curves , and evidence has been found in support of this explanation .
3 .
A marked change in the character of the absorption has been found in the presence of free acid , more especially in solvents containing a ketone group .
The addition of another solvent to these solutions causes a slow disappearance of the lines without shift , in accordance with the results of Jones and Strong .
4 .
The influence of pressures up to 750 atmospheres on the absorption spectra of solutions has been investigated , with negative results .
In conclusion , I should like to thank Prof. Herbert Jackson , of King 's College , London , for his kind advice and suggestions in regard to the work , and to acknowledge the help given me by Dr. Jacques Biss in this investigation .
On the Extinction of Light hy an Illuminated Retina .
By Sir William Abney , K.C.B. , F.R.S. ( Received May 4 , \#151 ; Read May 23 , 1912 .
) In " Colour Photometry , Part III , " 'Phil .
Trans./ 1892 , and " On the Sensitiveness of the Retina to Light and Colour , " ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1897 , a discussion on the extinction of light by a " dark-adapted " eye is given .
Since the latter date , a large number of experiments have been made by myself and others on the extinction of light when the retina as a whole has been stimulated by illumination of white or coloured light .
In this communication the results obtained when the stimulation is by white light are described .
In the two papers above referred to the apparatus used when the eye was dark-adapted is described , but for the observations made with an illuminated retina a modification had to be made .
A description of one form , which answered as well as any other form , is given .
BB is a box as in fig. 1 .
At the end of the box is cut a hole f inch in diameter and against it , but inside , is placed a 4-inch disc of white matt paper , in the centre of which is cut a ^-inch circular hole .
Behind the box is Sir W. Abney .
On the [ May 4 , a second end AA separated from the first by a couple of inches .
Opposite the aperture at the first end of the box is cut a circular aperture 1 inch in diameter , against which is placed a piece of doubly-ground white glass , and if necessary a second piece can be placed behind it .
The ray of the spectrum from the colour-patch apparatus can be reflected from a mirror M on to the ground glasses at d. The 4-inch white disc is illuminated by the white reflected beam of the same apparatus ( or by any other light ) through an Fig. 2 .
aperture CC cut in the side of the box .
This beam partly goes through the aperture at the end of the box and falls on G , a blackened surface , and is completely hidden from the eye end E. At the side of CC a small metal disc can be placed , which casts a sharp black image on the white disc , as shown in fig. 2 .
This may be taken as a measure of the blackness to be matched when extinguishing the light from the colour .
Annuluses ( as described in the second paper ) are employed , one to diminish the white light to any required extent , and another to extinguish the light from the colour .
This last is placed against the slit which is in the spectrum.* The box is furnished with a dark hood so that the only light which reaches the eye is from the end of the box .
The shadow cast by the disc is always the same blackness , though the illumination of the retina causes it to appear to vary .
It is not intended to give descriptions of any observations , except those which were made of the disappearance of the light coming through d , and its match with the black shadow , which is the extreme blackness which could be seen .
In one case , the luminosity of the white disc was 0*2 candle after Colour Fig. 1 .
* It will be noticed that by covering up CC the value of the extinction of a dark-adapted eye can be carried out .

passing through the annulus at 20 ' of its scale .
Each succeeding 25 ' gave exactly half the illumination .
Measures were taken with the white light passing through the annulus at 20 ' , 70 ' , 120 ' , 170 ' , and 220 ' .
The extinction of the light was made by another annulus in which each degree corresponded to 0-0086 diminution in logs .

It will be noticed that at S.S.N. 60 the red ray , when the illumination of the retina is 0*2 candle , is extinguished with an intensity 2*6 times greater than when the illumination is 0*00078 candle , and that the ratio of the maximum extinctions is for this illumination as 9*8 to 309 or as 1 to 32 .
The observation recorded in the same paper as to the recurrence of red in the determination of the extinction of colour is explained by these observations .
The white illuminates the retina more or less strongly and the red colour becomes visible .
The aperture of the pupil of the eye has not been taken into account .
An interesting and important fact is brought out by these experiments .
They show that , as the white illumination which stimulates the retina is increased , the point of maximum extinction travels between S.S.N. 's 40 and 52 .
With a very strongly stimulated retina and redder light , the point of maximum extinction may be even nearer the red than the latter number .
To illustrate this , the persistency curves ( reciprocals of the extinction curves ) have been calculated , the maximum in each case being made 100 .
The positions of these maxima give the positions of the maximum extinction .
The following table and diagram ( fig. 4 ) show the curves in which the illumination is 0 00078 , 0*0125 , and 0*2 candle , and also the persistency curve for a dark-adapted eye :\#151 ; 1912 .
