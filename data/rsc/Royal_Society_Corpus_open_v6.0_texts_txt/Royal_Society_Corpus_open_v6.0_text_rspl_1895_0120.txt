] y Solutions of haemochromogen ( reduced haematin of Stokes ) exhibit an intense absorption band between h and G. The band has the same position as the band of CO-haemoglobin , but is more intense .
With one part of baemochromogen in 25,000 parts of water ( the stratum examined being 10 mm. thick ) , an intense absorption band occupies the region between \ 410*0 and \ 430*0 .
From the examination of solutions of various strengths , it results that the mean ray absorbed corresponds to A , 420*0 .
VI .
The absorption of the extreme violet and ultra-violet by methaemoglobin indicates that this body is the product of a partial decomposition of the molecule of oxy-haemoglobin .
VII .
The band in the extreme violet ( and ultra-violet ) , which is characteristic of haemoglobin , its compounds , and certain of its iron-containing derivatives , in no respect depends upon the iron in the molecule .
This conclusion is based ( 1 ) on the fact that none of the compounds of iron , organic or inorganic , possess the property of producing a definite absorption in the extreme violet or the adjacent ultra-violet ; ( 2 ) upon the study of haematoporphyrin , a body derived from haematin by the removal of the iron which this body contains .
Acid solutions of haemotoporphyrin of extreme dilution exhibit an absorption band between h and H. If the solution be slightly more concentrated K is absorbed , and with increasing concentration of the solution the absorption of the ultra-violet extends more and more .
Alkaline solutions of haematoporphyrin absorb the same spectral region , bat the intensity of the absorption is greater .
VIII .
Neither bilirubin , hydrobilirubin , nor urobilin present any definite absorption band in the region of the spectrum where the absorption band of haemoglobin and its derivatives occurs .

( Abstract .
) Part I.\#151 ; Diffusion of Molten Metals .
In the first part of the paper the author alludes to some earlier experiments he made in 1883 on the diffusion of gold , silver , and platinum in molten lead .
He points out that although the action of osmotic pressure in lowering the freezing point of metals has been carefully examined , very little attention has been devoted to the measurement , or even to the consideration , of the molecular movements which enable two or more metals to form a truly homogeneous fluid mass .
The absence of direct experiments on the diffusion of molten metals is probably explained by the want of a sufficiently accurate method .
Ostwald had stated , moreover , with reference to the diffusion of salts , that " to make accurate experiments in diffusion is one of the most difficult problems in practical physics , and VOL. LIX .
