] This is such an extraordinary looking parasite that the Commission thinks it deserves a short preliminary note , a name , and to be figured .
The name is taken from Virgil 's description of the Cyclops , inform , ingens .
It was first discovered in the blood of a reed-buck on February 13 , 1909 , at Namukekera , Uganda ( lat. 0 ' 40 ' U. ; long .
32 ' 15 ' E. ) , the estate of the Uganda Company , Limited ; then in a bush-buck , and lastly in an ox .
The wild animals and the cattle feed in the same pastures , so that it is not remarkable that the oxen should become infected .
At present it is not known what the carrier is , and this will probably be a difficult thing to determine .
Collections of the blood-sucking flies and ticks are being made on the Namukekera Estate , and this may lead in time to the discovery of the carrier .
Up to the present the following list includes all the blood-suckers found in this particular district:\#151 ; Chrysops distinctipennis , Austen .
, Ricardo .
Stomoxys calcitrans , Linn. , sp. nov .
Stomoxys nigra , Macq .
Hcematopota brunnescens , Ricardo .
Tabanus tceniola , Pal .
de Beauv .
Trypanosoma ingens , when seen alive in a fresh preparation , moves slowly and deliberately across the field of the microscope , with a fine rippling , or at times a broader undulating movement .
In stained preparations this huge trypanosome may measure as much as 122 microns , and even then it is lying in such a formless huddled-up way among the red blood corpuscles that it looks capable of stretching out to a much greater length .
The other specimens figured measure 72 , 77 , 88 , and 82 microns .
The breadth is 7 to 10 microns .
The micronucleus is small and round .
It measures about a micron in diameter .
It lies posterior to , and quite close to , the nucleus .
From it , in well-stained specimens , a well-marked , though narrow , undulating membrane arises , which runs to the anterior extremity and ends in a free flagellum .
The nucleus is oval in form , and lies across the body .
It is situated VOL. LXXXI.\#151 ; B. 2 B 324 Trypanosoma , n. sp. nearer the posterior end than the anterior , and in our specimens has stained a pale pink .
The body substance is markedly granular behind the nucleus , while in front the structure described as myonemes is particularly well marked .
More minute measurements of one of these trypanosomes are as follows:\#151 ; microns .

83 It is unnecessary in this preliminary note to go more fully into the structure of this trypanosome , or to describe it at greater length .
An examination of the coloured drawings reproduced in Plate 7 will give a more distinct idea of its appearance than any written description .
The drawings were made by Lady Bruce , R.R.C. Pigs .
1 , 3 , and 4 are from reed-buck , fig. 2 from the ox .
All are magnified 2000 and stained Giemsa .
