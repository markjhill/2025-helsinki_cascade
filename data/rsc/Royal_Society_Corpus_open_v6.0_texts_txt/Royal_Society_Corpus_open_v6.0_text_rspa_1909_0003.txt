22 Mr. T. Royds .
A Comparison of the Radium [ Nov. 26 , So far the results are in satisfactory agreement with those obtained by Prof. Townsend , with Rontgen rays , and it is hoped to make further experiments and to see if it is possible to obtain positive ions with double the atomic charge by means of radium rays .
Possibly the molecules of a gas are ionised in different ways by the a , ,6 , and \lt ; y types of radiation , and it is not quite certain which kind of radiation had the predominating effect in the production of the ions in these experiments , though probably the greater numbers were due to the a-rays .
I am greatly indebted to Prof. Townsend for most valuable advice and assistance throughout .

) In 1904 Sir William Ramsay and Prof. Collie* gave a list of lines produced by the discharge in a vacuum tube containing radium emanation , but the uncertainty of these numbers made a redetermination desirable .
A later determination by Mr. Cameron and Prof. Ramsayf was communicated to the Royal Society on June 25 , 1908 , and was published on August 27 , together with corrections , and a final compilation of verified emanation lines added on August 5 .
After Prof. Rutherford had completed the measurements of the volume of the radium emanation , he and the writer were able to photograph the spectrum that had been observed in the course of this work , and we published in ' Nature , ' July 9 , 1908 , the wave-lengths of the stronger lines observed by us in the emanation spectrum , and a more complete list , containing 73 lines , with an accuracy of 0'5 A.U. , was given in the c Philosophical Magazine ' of August , 1908 .
Measurements which I have recently made to within OT A.U. by means of a concave grating confirm the accuracy of our previous determinations .
The complete purification of the radium emanation demands a lengthy and painstaking procedure , and is a matter of considerable difficulty , for the volume of pure emanation available in our experiments would occupy at * ' Hoy .

] Emanation Spectra obtained by different Observers .
23 atmospheric pressure not more than one-tenth of a cubic millimetre .
The vacuum tube employed must therefore be of small dimensions , and all traces of foreign gases have to be removed from the walls and the electrodes of the tube .
In the experiments of Rutherford and Royds , using the method of purification recently developed by Prof. Rutherford , * a complete day 's work was taken up before the vacuum tube was filled with the pure emanation .
We have observed the spectrum of the radium emanation at least eight times , and have obtained almost exactly the same spectrum on each occasion .
We have drawn attention to variations in the relative intensities due to the presence of foreign gas .
In the different experiments of Cameron and Ramsay , however , the spectrum is seen to vary considerably .
In their first experiment , the spectrum consisted chiefly of hydrogen , together with nitrogen , and also ( presumably ) mercury , f and of the lines remaining , which alone are given in their list , the strongest are quite absent from our spectrum ; a few of the fainter lines are probably identical with some of the strongest emanation lines .
In the second experiment of Cameron and Ramsay , allowing for a possible error of 4 or 5 A.U. in their measurements , the strongest lines in the spectrum are , roughly speaking , those strongest in our spectrum .
At the end of their final list of August 5 , Cameron and Ramsay state that our figures show a very close agreement with theirs .
A careful examination shows , however , that there are striking differences too marked to be explained as errors in measurement or variations of intensity due to impurities , for many of the strongest lines are absent altogether from our spectrum , and also from their own previous determinations .
Investigating these differences several weeks ago , I noticed that after leaving out the well-marked emanation lines , the final spectrum of Cameron and Ramsay was almost identical with the xenon spectrum obtained by the discharge from a Leyden jar with spark gap . !
An examination of the accompanying table shows that the spectrum attributed by them to the radium emanation is mainly a compound of the xenon spectra obtained with and without Leyden jar , the jar spectrum having been brought out , probably , * 'Phil .

t In none of our photographs have the mercury lines been present , though the green line 5461 has been seen faintly in visual observations .
Neither were the hydrogen lines , except seen when preliminary precautions had been taken for the removal of hydrogen from the electrodes .
+ The author is reminded that Prof. Living had remarked last summer the similarity of this emanation spectrum to that of xenon ; Sir J. Dewar reported the circumstance at the British Association meeting in September .
The author is convinced that there is no real coincidence in the emanation spectrum with the spectra of any of the rare atmopheric gases .
Mr. T. Boyds .
A Comparison of the Radium [ Nov. 26 , by the heaviness of the discharge employed .
Practically the only strong xenon line not included in their list is the line 4862'69 ( intensity 8 ) , which was doubtless hidden by Hp 4861*49 .
After eliminating the lines due to xenon from their last photograph containing 54 lines , there remain 11 .
Of these , eight are seen to be some of the strongest lines of our spectrum .
Taking into account the complete list of Ramsay and Cameron 's lines , including those printed in italics , which were seen only in previous photographs , the number of emanation lines amounts to 16 ; there are , of course , numerous coincidences within the accuracy of their measurements , of xenon lines with possible emanation lines .

4 It is not possible to explain the presence of so large a quantity of xenon as must have been in the spectrum tube as being due to a leakage of air into the apparatus .
Prof. Rutherford and I have made special experiments to test whether xenon was present with our preparations of emanation , but could not detect any trace of this gas .
It is probable that there has been , in the experiments of Cameron and Ramsay , an unsuspected contamination with xenon .
Cameron and Ramsay attribute a line at 4058'5 to the active deposit of the radium emanation , since its relative intensity increases with the length of time that the discharge has passed .
Mercury lines will , of course , behave similarly as the emanation is driven into the walls .
It appears probable that they have overlooked a mercury line at 4057'9 , which is present , according to Eder and Yalenta , in the vacuum tube discharge at ordinary temperatures , with an intensity 4 compared with intensity 10 for the mercury line 40468 .
