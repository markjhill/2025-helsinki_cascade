Its maximum lies , as regards load , between the two previous maximums , and the whole range of magnetic change is considerably increased .
The hysteresis which occurs in the relation of magnetisation to stress is absolutely static .
The value of the magnetism associated with any condition ( past and present ) of stress is reached at once , and remains unchanged for any length of time , when the load is kept constant .

My last communication dealt with the actinometrical observations made by Mr. W. H. Cole , M.A. , and myself in 1879 ; I have now the pleasure to submit the observations taken in 1880 by Mr. Cole , and in 1881 by Mr. H. W. Peychers* and myself .
The former happen to be few in number , but the latter present the longest series I have ever been able to take , extending as they do over thirty-two days .
The 1881 observations were moreover made under certain special conditions , which are not without interest .
Hitherto the two actino-meters used ( belonging to the Royal Society ) were bothf of the kind invented by the Rev. G. C. Hodgkinson , and marked by me A and B. One of these was employed at Dehra , the other at Mussooree , the observations being taken as nearly as practicable at the same moments of time ; but , as the former of these stations cannot be considered free from objections , which I have discussed in previous communications , I determined to restrict future observations to Mnssooree alone .
This * This being the first occasion of mentioning Mr. Peychers ' name , I add , that as he has worked under me for several years , I can vouch for him as an accurate and painstaking observer .
t Both these actinometers are still identical in all respects with their condition when received in 1868 .
Mr. J. B. N. Hennessey .
[ May 25 , change , moreover , enabled me to adopt the desirable condition that two observers and instruments , placed side side , should work with one and the same chronometer between them ' , so that two independent results might be obtained simultaneously .
It was under these conditions that the autumn series of observations in 1881 were made ; otherwise , both the summer and autumn series of 1881 , as well as the series of 1880 , were taken exactly in keeping with the observations of 1879 .
The procedure followed in the last-named series is fully described in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society , " vol. 31 , p. 154 , to which I may be permitted to refer , instead of making repetitions here , especially since my leisure is at present limited , so that it had perhaps better be devoted to what follows .
2 .
Returning to the autumn simultaneous observations of 1881 , not only were two actinometers employed side by side , but the two instruments were of different patterns .
One of them was A ( Hodgkinson 's ) , which has been amply described in my previous communications ; the other instrument was one * of those constructed according to designs by Professor Balfour Stewart .
It is marked No. 2 , and is supplied with two similar tubes , or thermometers , viz. , No. 1306 and No. 1307 , both of which read from 0 ' to 100 ' F. , and are graduated on the glass to degree fifths .
Tube 1306 alone was employed ; it was readily adapted to give readings for so long a time as thirty consecutive minutes of observation , by casting off sufficient mercury into the pear-shaped receptacle above .
This was done once for all before the series was begun , and in fact the surplus mercury is still in the receptacle .
Otherwise , particular attention was paid to the settings of the thermometer , in rotation and depth , and to those of the lens ; the latter was kept scrupulously clean , and was used to its full extent , i.e. , no stops were employed .
It will thus be seen that the observations were all strictly differential .
The graduations were read as usual with a magnifying-glass ; the exposures were of sixty seconds alternately in sun and shade , with thirty seconds ' intervals between , so that the instruments were read both at the beginning and end of each sixty seconds exposure , all of which is in keeping with what was done during previous work .
In point of observers , Mr. Peychers worked A and I used No. 2 .
3 .
My observations before 1881 were restricted to the autumn , but an opportunity occurred in the summer of 1881 , which was utilised so long as it lasted .
The results are of an unexpected nature .
4 .
There is another point to be mentioned .
Increased experience has suggested keener discrimination in respect to atmospheric conditions , and this has called for some concise mode of indication , which I * For the loan of this instrument I am indebted to the kindness of H. F. Blan-ford , Esq. , F.R.S. , Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India .

47 designate " day letters .
" These I briefly explain hereafter , first reiterating that I never observe when any visible interpositions exist between the sun and me ; and , in fact , what can be the nse of measuring solar radiation through a visible varying atmospheric umbrella , such as is represented by cloud , mist , haze , dust , and smoke ?
I thought of using a Crookes ' radiometer ( happening to possess one ) as a pioneer to the actinometer , in order to see if the former would suitably indicate when the latter may be employed to good purpose , but the intention unavoidably fell through .
5 .
Now , in respect to my day letters , the cases I had to provide for were these : the two visible causes of interposition are cloud ( including mist ) and haze ( including dust , smoke , \amp ; c. ) .
First as to\gt ; cloud:\#151 ; ( 1 .
) The whole visible sky may be perfectly clear , or there may be half-a-dozen small patches here and there , but none within 50 ' or 60 ' " of the sun ; for this state my day letter is A. ( 2 .
) But sometimes the condition A required qualifying , because of a peculiar cloud behaviour .
The sun being due south , small cloud balls , some 2 ' to 5 ' in diameter , appeared on the horizon about northwest , and gradually rolled up and eastwards to some 30 ' short of the sun , where they became invisible .
When the circular track , if continued in imagination , passed well under the sun , I indicated this by B. ( 3 .
) But if the track passed through the sun , the day letter used is C. 6 .
Then as regards haze : I stood on the outermost mountain range , south of which lie the plains and to the north successive hill ridges , ending in the perpetual snows .
No haze is generated on the hills apparently , but is blown up from below , the wind being southerly as a rule : hence ( 4 .
) For no haze south or north I use a. ( 5 .
) For haze to south only , b. ( 6 .
) When the haze is both south and north , I infer that I stand in it though it is invisible overhead ; for this I use c. Hence , by using suitable combinations of these letters , the condition of the sky is fairly indicated symbolically , at least for Mussooree .
7 .
The present series have been reduced in exactly the same manner as those of 1879 were reduced .
The individual results are attached , viz.:\#151 ; For 1880 Autumn , October 18th to 27th , in T. 1 , by Mr. W. H. Cole , M.A. For 1881 Summer , April 25th to May 9th , in T. 2 , by Mr. H. W. Peychers and myself .

[ May 25 glass off ; for those of No. 2 the unit is 0''01 F. , assuming a graduation of No. 2 to be 0o,2 F. yf 8 .
It needs but little familiarity with the two kinds of instruments to decide in favour of that by Professor Balfour Stewart over that by the Rev. Gr .
C. Hodgkinson , a preference which may be greatly increased by doubling the sensitiveness of the former .
I have accordingly converted all my results beginning with 1869 , and expressed them in terms of Stewart 's No. 2 , or 0'-01 F. , which unit is to be understood in all that now follows .
9 .
Again , as the average zenith of distance of the sun during my autumn series does not differ greatly one year with another , and as suitable corrections to an adopted zenith distance may be inferred from the long range series ( i.e. , three or four hours on each side of the meridian ) taken at the same season of the year , I have reduced all my autumn results to the zenith distance of 45 ' .
10 .
The long range series used are given in T. 4 , where it will be seen that the series with A in 1881 is inconsistent , so that I have rejected it .
It appears a waste of time to attempt formulating at present the correction from one Z.D. to another ; I made several endeavours of the kind with the long series of T. 4 , but feeling that the expressions were more pretentious than real , I resorted to the projection shown in the correction Curve C 1 : here it will be seen that the two curves , i.e. , of 1879 and 1881 , are fairly similar , and as the series of 1881 was taken at half-hour intervals instead of the one-hour intervals of 1879 , the correction curve I have adopted is made to agree more nearly with the later series .
All the reductions to 45 ' Z.D. have been made with the help of C 1 .

Otherwise these mean results , so far as they go , increase with the sun 's progress .

[ The results for the four autumns are exhibited graphically in Plate 1 .
] 14 .
With regard to T. 7 , no reduction to Z.D. 45 ' has been attempted , for circumstances unfortunately did not permit of observing a long series at the time .
In fact , observations in the summer were not contemplated , for , as a rule , that season is highly unfavourable for actinometrical work .
As , however , the atmosphere unexpectedly became fine and clear , advantage was taken of the opportunity to do as much work as was practicable : for this purpose none but highly favourable days were admitted , and it is a point to be noticed that excepting on May 2 , 6 , and 9 the visible conditions decidedly good .
On the dates just mentioned a dry ( dust ?
) haze visibly enveloped the observer , and the observations then taken art .
intended expressly to measure the effect of this haze .

T. 8 exhibits an abstract of the bulk of the work now presented .
The series extends over thirty-two days , in which four blanks occur unavoidably ; the visible atmospheric conditions were excellent , and the work was done with great care and with two different kinds of instruments .
Attention is called to the variable nature of the factor y ?
\#151 ; , due probably to imperfections in A. A 16 .
Turning for a moment to another subject .
As the photo-heliograph in daily work at Dehra Done is under my charge , the negatives were available for finding areas of sun-spots in the autumn of 1881 .
My means for making these measurements in a limited time were not very rigorous ; notwithstanding I believe the results obtained , of visible areas , are sufficiently exact .
Nor was there leisure to find these areas for any considerable period , i.e. , before , after , and including that of the actinometrical observations of autumn 1881 , and a considerable range of the kind is obviously essential for a complete inquiry as to connexion in time and circumstances between solar causes and terrestrial effects .
Under existing pressure , I chose the daily negatives corresponding to the days of actinometer work , and obtained numerical values of areas for umbra and penumbra .
17 .
Looking now at curves C 2 , the exhibit was intended to present curve projections of radiation and spot-areas only autumn 1881 ; as , however , there is space on the exhibit , the autumn radiation -curves for 1869 , 1879 , and 1880 have been added .
The day-letters 1881 have also been introduced , attention being here called to those containing a C or c.I repeat , that the presence of these letters by no means implies that the results are vitiated and rejectaneous from visible causes , but that merely invisible interpositions may possibly have prevailed .
Now , as already said , the curves of 1881 are exhibits of simultaneity between radiation and spot-areas , and that being the argument , neither contrariety nor similarity decidedly appears between the two curves , which , therefore , in the exhibit , yield no answer as to spot temperature- If we discard the argument of simultaneity as improbable* in presence of our own heat arresting atmosphere alone , * I can only aver that my thermometer sunk in the ground 26 feet still continues to mark a falling temperature , although on the surface we are now fast approaching maximum summer heat ( April 1 , 1882 ) .
E 2 52 Mr. J. B. N. Hennessey .
[ May 25r then the question arises , for a given radiation effect how far must we seek for the corresponding spot impulse ( if any ) ?
But my present view being necessarily limited to what appears on C 2 , I advance ( in imagination ) the area curve by some three days , bringing , , for instance , its features of 12th under that of radiation for 15th ; when this is done , there is more general resemblance between the two curves , indicating increased radiation for increased spot-area .
The middle or highest rising portions ( 16th to 29th ) of spot-area will now correspond fairly with 18th ( or 19th ) to 1st of radiation ; an interval about the same as a semi-solar rotation .
18 .
Looking at the radiation curve ( autumn 1881 ) alone , it may be described as consisting of three hills ( of which the last , alas , is cut short with the series and leads to nothing ) and intervening valleys ; between the apices of the first and second hills w'e have eleven days , between the valleys six and fourteen days .
19 .
This brings me to T. 9 , where are tabulated the means of such of the autumnal results as happen to be forthcoming , lying between 1.5th October and 16th November for each year , and also the summer mean for 1881 .
Now , looking at the yearly autumn means reduced to 45 ' Z.D. , it will be seen that they exhibit a continuous decrement of about 2 per cent , annually from 1879 to 1881 .
I think that they also have the appearance of truth about them , so far as they go , and , in fact in obtaining them considerable care and exactness was exercised , so that they may claim reliance .
But when we look at the summer mean of 1881 , which in my judgment is equally reliable , we find it only 565 , at a solar zenith distance of but 15''5 , or nearly 30 ' less than the autumn Z.D. Unfortunately , I repeat , no long series could be taken in the summer , but the autumn long series in the same year ( 1881 ) gives a mean decrease of 47 radiation for an increase in Z.D. of 17 ' reckoned from Z.D. 46 ' ; and accepting this as some approximate basis for reduction of the summer result from 15''5 to 45 ' , I can only conjecture that this summer result , if thus reduced , would be less than the autumn result of the same by , say , at least , 40 to 50 units , or about half a degree F.* This represents so great and unexpected a change that one naturally looks for flaws in the summer observations , but I can find none .
The mean is obtained from five days ' observations taken carefully in ( visibly speaking ) unimpeachable weather , and the five results are accordant ( see T. 7 ) .
Beyond this I can only say that I will certainly try to obtain other daily series , and a long series , in the approaching summer .
* The solar negatives for the summer of 1881 are not with me now , but judging from silver prints in my possession , it is certain that sun-spots and faculse were very sensibly absent in summer 1881 compared with sun-spot exhibits in the succeeding autumn ; if this he accepted as cause , variation of radiation with sun-spot area would receive very decided confirmation in the present instance .

20 .
Next , I may first mention that by the " black bulb " thermometer is intended one of those unsatisfactory instruments , of which the bulb is blackened and enclosed in a fixed glass sphere some 3 inches in diameter , and that the same identical instrument was exposed and read on the same spot in 1879 to 1881 .
Now , according to what has been said , the actinometrical summer result , if true , indicates a sensible decrease of radiation compared with autumn , but the black bulb shows exactly the reverse , and reads 19 ' higher in the summer !
There is also a similar contradiction between 1879 and 1880 , where the black bulb gives a rise of 13 to an actinometrical fall .
I confess my inability to account for these contradictions , which , however , I cannot regard as of serious importance , unless it be affirmed that black bulb thermometers are reliable : in this case there arises the question why the actinometer and the black bulb should be at such utter variance P 21 .
In concluding this paper , I venture to make a few remarks in respect to actinometrical observations .
It is astonishing how considerably one 's notion of the number of days suitable for actinometrical work undergoes modification after careful watching .
I speak , of -course , only of visible vitiating causes ; of the invisible I know nought , if ought be known .
And the presence of the former causes I now believe may be detected by a careful observer , at any place I am acquainted with , on several days in the year : no doubt one locality is far more suitable than another , but at the best a number of days will occur annually , when observations if made are worse than useless , for they are misleading .
Hence in any project for continuous actinometrical work , the stations should be selected at least in pairs , so that the omissions at one of the two may be supplemented at the other .
22 .
Another point is this : suppose that at a given station the sun 's meridional zenith distance at lowest is \#163 ; , and at highest is Z , then the system of observation I suggest is as follows :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) Observe daily from 15 minutes before to 15 minutes after apparent local noon .
( 2 .
) Observe daily a series of 6 sun and 5 shade observations when the sun on each side of the meridian is at zenith distance =g for the mean of the set .
( 3 .
) Observe a series of 6 sun and 5 shade at every half hour from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. , if possible , on every day corresponding to a change of 3 ' declination between \#163 ; and Z ; thus if the sun 's meridional zenith ranged in course of the year between zenith distances 7 ' and 54 ' ( about ) , then by preference let the days of observation for long series be those days when the meridional zenith distances are successively 7 ' , 10 ' , and 13 ' ... .
54 ' ( about ) .
23 .
By means of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) a complete connexion will be estab54 Mr. J. B. N. Hennessey .
[ May 25 , .
lished throughout the year 's work at any station , but as already remarked , I think a pair of stations essential .
No doubt several pairs are really wanted , and sooner or later I believe this will come to be-established right round the globe , for actinometer and solar photography and physics generally : at any rate this must happen , so soon as the leading nations of this earth take home to themselves the fact , that solar energy is the great force which utterly governs them , indirectly perhaps even in matters of commerce or war .
Meanwhile , even one-pair of actinometer stations will be welcome , and all the more so if established at once .
