187 A Case of Sleeping Sickness studied by Precise Methods : Further Observations .
By Major Ronald Ross , F.R.S. , and David Thomson , M.B. , Ch. B. , D.P.H. ( Received October 15 , \#151 ; Read December 8 , 1910 .
) ( 1 ) Introduction .
In a previous paper by us , published in the 'Proceedings ' of July 21 , 1910 , B 557 , we recorded our observations on this case during two and a-half months , and described particularly the regular periodical rises in the numbers of trypanosomes disclosed in the patient 's peripheral blood by methodical daily countings extending over that period .
Our technique has been detailed in another paper by us on " Enumerative Studies on Malarial Fever , " recently submitted to the Society .
We now record our further observations on the case during two more months\#151 ; until the patient 's death .
A chart and a table giving daily details of the observations are attached ; and accompanying papers by Drs. J. G- .
Thomson and H. B. Fantham record studies on animals and on the parasites themselves .
We must refer also to a recent communication to the Society by Drs. J. W. W. Stephens and Fantham suggesting that the species found in this case may not be identical with T. ganibiense .
The patient , a strong young Englishman , age 26 , weight 154 lbs. , was infected in N.E. Rhodesia near the River Luangwa in September , 1909 .
The trypanosomes were found in his blood in Africa on November 17 .
He was admitted into the Royal Southern Hospital on December 4 .
Daily estimation of the number of trypanosomes per cubic millimetre of his blood was commenced on February 16 , and continued till his death on June 29 , a period of 134 days .
During that period we never failed to find trypanosomes .
The history of the case from February 16 is recorded graphically on the folding chart facing p. 198 .
The patient had glandular swellings and ill-defined erythematous rashes on his legs at various intervals .
On April 20 he had a severe attack of vomiting which continued for four days ; in consequence he lost 10 lbs. in weight and was never again so well .
He remained in bed onwards till his death .
He became progressively more drowsy , with intervals of more or less comparative brightness .
His memory and mental powers failed steadily .
On May 7 he developed a marked neuritis due to the atoxyl , and every dose seemed to aggravate the neuro-retinitis produced by the previous 188 Major R. Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
Sleeping [ Oct. 15 , administration of this drug .
His eyes were examined weekly by Dr. Hamilton oculist to the hospital .
On May 10 both legs became markedly oedematous and remained so till his death .
On May 13 he became much worse and developed paralysis of his sphincters .
He seemed about to die , but on May 20 a sudden remarkable improvement took place .
Soon , however , he again commenced to grow steadily worse .
On June 25 he developed pleurisy and pneumonia .
He died on June 29 .
Post mortem : performed 22 hours after death :\#151 ; Brain : membranes thickened and white .
Vessels congested .
Cerebrospinal fluid increased .
Left lung : broncho-pneumonia .
Left pleural cavity : contained one pint of yellow pussy fluid .
Spleen : soft and much enlarged ; weight , 33 ozs .
Liver : enlarged ; weight , 6 lbs. Blood : no trypanosomes could be found .
Leucocytes , 17,000 per cubic millimetre .
Polymorph excess .
Smears of bone marrow , spleen , kidney , mesenteric glands , and cerebrospinal fluid , all showed large numbers of small and large mononuclear cells , but no trypanosomes could be detected .
( 2 ) Continuance of the Periodical Cycle .
The cycle recorded by us till April 30 in our previous paper continued till his death .
From February 22 till June 25 there occurred 19 rises in the numbers of trypanosomes in his peripheral blood .
This gives an average \#166 ; of six and a-half days between the heights of each rise .
The shortest period between two successive heights is four days , as recorded between April 18 and 22 , and again between June 3 and 7 .
This exceptionally short interval was due , we think , to artificial means , as we shall explain later under vaccine treatment .
The longest period recorded between two successive heights is eight days , while the usual period between the heights seems to be seven days .
It will be observed that the rise and fall is sudden , and that the height is not maintained .
While the number of the parasites was increasing rapidly , we observed many forms with double nuclei and blepharoplasts ( dividing forms ) .
During the interval between the rises , few of these forms were present .
This would seem to indicate that the sudden rise is due to an active multiplication of the parasites .
On April 28 the numbers increased from 200 to 1536 in 24 hours , and on June 19 they increased from 100 to 1500 in 24 hours , suggesting that in 1910 .
] Sickness studied by Precise Enumerative Methods .
189 our patient they were capable of dividing and sub-dividing three to four times in 24 hours .
The natural fall is even more sudden than the rise .
On April 29 the parasites fell from 1536 to 100 per cubic millimetre of blood in 24 hours .
Except on April 5 and 6 only one observation was made daily , so that obviously we may have missed the highest points reached in the various rises .
The low levels were , as a rule , maintained for three or four days , forming U-shaped bends as recorded in the chart .
The lowest number recorded was 8 per cubic millimetre of blood , while the highest reached 1536 per cubic millimetre of blood .
It is worthy of note that there is a tendency for a high rise to be .followed by a low one .
This is not without exception , but the three highest rises recorded were followed by the three lowest rises .
( 3 ) Correlation between the Cycle and the Amount of Fever .
From the chart one can observe that almost invariably the temperature tends to be higher during the height of the cycle , and that between the rises the temperature keeps lower .
In the table average daily temperatures are recorded .
These figures were obtained by taking the average of the four-hourly temperatures observed during the 24 hours of each day .
We think that this figure gives a fair representation of the amount of fever for the day , and in this table it may be noted that the average daily temperature rises coincidently with the increase of trypanosomes and falls with their fall .
( 4 ) Other Clinical Observations and Correlations with the Cycle .
The pulse rate ranged all through this case from 90 to 120 per minute .
During the height of the cycle it tended to increase coincidently with the increased amount of fever .
The respiration rate ranged from 20 to 28 per minute , tending also to increase with the rise of the trypanosomes .
With regard to the bowels there is little to note .
Their action was easily regulated with small doses of cascara .
It was very noticeable that the patient was more drowsy , and tended to have headaches , during the commencement of the cyclical rise , but these symptoms abated at the extreme height and during the subsequent fall of trypanosomes .
The lymphatic glands in the neck , axilla , groin , and popliteal space were more or less always swollen , but this condition was greatly aggravated at intervals , accompanied with marked tenderness , though only sometimes was this coincident with a trypanosome increase .
190 Major R. Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
Sleeping [ Oct. 15 , The urine throughout remained clear , usually slightly acid and without deposits .
The specific gravity ranged from 1010 to 1026 .
On March 15 he had a diffuse ill-defined erythematous rash over his left leg , occurring just before the height of a trypanosome increase .
( 5 ) Correlation between the Trypanosome Cycle and the Behaviour of the Leucocytes .
Previous to April 23 we made several leucocyte counts with the Thomas Zeiss apparatus , but were unable to find anything definite .
It was only when we made counts daily at the same hour that we were able to find a definite leucocyte change corresponding to the parasitic cycle .
We counted the leucocytes by means of the thick film as referred to in our paper on malaria , and were astonished at the remarkable variations .
We found no such variations by our method in normal persons .
Simultaneous examination of thin blood films also showed that a remarkable leucocytic variation did take place , corresponding to each rise of trypanosomes .
Daily differential counts were also made in thin films stained with Giemsa , in which we distinguished only between mononuclears and the so-called polymorphonuclears .
In these we never counted less than from 300 to 500 leucocytes to ensure greater accuracy .
We thus estimated daily the total leucocytes and the total numbers of polymorphs and mononuclears per cubic millimetre of blood , as shown in the chart and table at end of paper .
From April 23 till May 20 it is clearly seen that coincident with each rise in the number of trypanosomes there is a marked increase in the total leucocytes , and this increase is due more to mononuclears than to polymorphonuclears .
When the trypanosomes begin to increase in number the .
leucocytes increase also , more especially the mononuclears .
When the trypanosomes have reached their height there may be a fall in the number of leucocytes , but this is followed by a still higher rise during the fall of the trypanosomes .
The leucocytes would seem to reach their highest numbers on about the third day after the height of the parasitic cycle .
They then decrease rapidly for about three days to normal or much lower .
When this occurs the trypanosomes again commence to multiply , and the leucocytes again increase also , so that we have both a parasitic and a corresponding leucocytic cycle .
We did not attempt to differentiate between large mononuclears and lymphocytes , but it seemed to us that both took part in the total mononuclear increase .
We further observed that during and immediately after the parasitic fall the*large mononuclears were filled with vacuoles and a 1910.1 Sickness studied by Precise Enumerative Methods .
reddish cUbris ( stained Giemsa ) .
Many of these vacuolated mononuclear cells were of great size ( 30 to 40 microns in diameter ) .
We are inclined to think that this vacuolation with reddish stained ( Mbris may be an indication of the ingestion of trypanosomes , although we have never observed any definite trypanosome structure within them .
F. W. Andrewes , in the Croonian Lectures , * points out that an intravenous injection of bacteria causes a temporary diminution in leucocytes , followed by a marked increase , this fall and rise being chiefly due to the so-called polymorphonuclears , the mononuclears taking little part in the phenomenon .
In this disease , as in malaria , it would appear that there is a diminution followed by an increase , chiefly of the mononuclears .
This tends to suggest that the polymorphonuclear leucocytes react chiefly to bacterial infections , while the mononuclears would seem to react chiefly to protozoal blood infections ( D. T. ) .
It is interesting to note that on May 20 there was a very marked mononuclear increase , coincident with a fall of trypanosomes , and accompanied by a remarkable improvement in the clinical condition of the patient ; and again on June 24 the mononuclear excess changed into a very marked polymorph excess .
This was coincident with the onset of pleurisy and pneumonia , from which the patient died .
In connection with the leucocyte cycle , the highest numbers recorded were 50,000 per cubic millimetre of blood , whereas the lowest was 2,800 per cubic millimetre of blood .
In the latter part of the chart the leucocytic graph is altered by the injection of leucocytic extract , and by the development of an abscess and pneumonia .
The following quotation from the Sleeping Sickness Bulletin , 1908 , No. I , p. 5 , is of interest:\#151 ; " Dr. W. Thomas found that after an injection of atoxyl a change in the parasites became noticeable between the fourth and the fifth hour .
They became sluggish and much altered in appearance , and at the same time there was a noticeable increase in the leucocytes .
About the seventh hour there was a great diminution in the number of trypanosomes , and a coincident increase in the leucocytes , notably the phagocytes .
At the eighteenth hour parasites were absent and could not be found , even after blood centrifugalisation .
Instances of phagocytosis were observed on these occasions .
" Thomas and Breinl tried the effect of hyperleucocytic agents without good effects , but remark : " It is quite evident that the leucocytes play a role in the decrease of parasites .
" We think that it is possible that on some occasions , at least , Thomas may * 'Lancet , ' July , 1910 .

Sleeping [ Oct. 15 , have happened to give atoxyl at the time when the leucocytes were increasing and the parasites were diminishing , as we have shown to occur naturally .
( 6 ) The Haemoglobin and Red Cells .
During the course of the disease from February till the patient 's death in June , the haemoglobin percentage fell more or less steadily from 85 to 70 per cent. We could not detect any variation in the amount of haemoglobin corresponding to the parasitic cycle .
The number of red cells was deficient ( 3,800,000 in March ; 2,800,000 in June ) .
Their numbers were not estimated frequently .
( 7 ) The Effects of Treatment by Various Drugs .
The crucial test of a curative treatment in .
this disease would naturally he the effect of the treatment on the numbers of parasites , especially in our case , where the numbers were estimated daily .
In testing the value of various therapeutic agents , we have therefore taken the graph of the number of parasites as the indicator of the efficacy of that agent .
We would like also to point out that in estimating the effect of treatment by this method , the blood must be examined every day , otherwise the effects recorded might be erroneous .
If a drug be given at the height of a parasitic rise , and the blood examined next day or a few days later , the number of parasites would naturally be much less ; to conclude from this that the drug has caused this diminution might be quite erroneous .
It is obvious that no conclusion should be drawn until the numbers have been estimated daily for several weeks .
We think it may be possible that a drug such as atoxyl may by chance have been given , sometimes , just as the parasites were naturally about to fall , and the rapid diminution attributed to the drug .
It has been stated that atoxyl did not always cause a disappearance of the parasites , but that sometimes instead they even increased in numbers ; and further , that it seemed to have a more marked trypanocidal action when the parasites were very numerous .
These statements can be understood in the light of the natural cycle .
Again , if the trypanosomes increase in number immediately after the administration of a drug , one cannot at once conclude that this drug is of no value as a trypanocide .
The Effect of Atoxyl .
From February 16 till April 5 atoxyl was not given on account of its injurious effect on the patient 's eyes .
On April 5 we , however , injected a 1910.1 Sickness studied by Precise Enumerative Methods .
193 dose of 4 grains at the commencement of a natural rise .
The blood was examined every two hours afterwards and showed that the trypanosomes were increasing in numbers .
Twenty-four hours later there was a further marked increase .
Next day again , as we would have expected to occur naturally , there was a decided diminution in their number .
On May 2 atoxyl was again given , though it was found that every dose aggravated the eye condition .
From May 2 till June 20 , 32 grains of atoxyl in all were administered at intervals , as noted on the chart .
On comparing the graph where no atoxyl was given , and where it was administered , no very appreciable difference in the number of trypanosomes can be detected .
We cannot , however , conclude that the atoxyl has no trypanocidal effect , as had it not been given the trypanosomes may possibly have been much more numerous during the latter than in the earlier part of the chart ; and further , this particular strain of trypanosome seems to have been very virulent .
Our doses of atoxyl in any case were rather small .
It would appear to us , however , that atoxyl cannot be considered a specific in human trypanosomiasis , as quinine is in malaria .
In our cases of malaria quinine never failed to diminish , markedly , the number of asexual parasites .
Moreover , atoxyl compared with quinine is a dangerous drug .
Quinine and Methylene Blue Treatment .
Quinine 30 grains daily , combined with methylene blue , 12 grains daily , was administered by the mouth from February 21 till March 9 , and again at other intervals as noted on the chart .
No marked trypanocidal effect can be noticed .
During treatment with these drugs , however , as also with atoxyl , the patient 's face , which had before been puffy and oedematous , especially about the eyelids , became more firm and clear cut .
The eyelids became again oedematous soon after these drugs were withheld .
It would seem , therefore , that quinine and methylene blue , as well as atoxyl , had some beneficial effect clinically .
The following drugs were also given without apparent results:\#151 ; ( a ) Trypsin and Amylopsin Injections.\#151 ; 20 min. of each daily .
( b ) Succinamide of Mercury Injections.\#151 ; One-fifth grain almost daily .
( c ) Izal Oil.\#151 ; 8 min. daily , by mouth .
( d ) Trypan Red.\#151 ; By the mouth in doses of 0*5 grain , 1 grain , and 1 grain respectively on three successive days .
No albuminuria resulted , but the drug was stopped on account of the development of severe vomiting .
( e ) Potassium Iodide.\#151 ; 30 grains daily , by mouth .
194 Major R. Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
Sleeping [ Oct. 15 , We beg to apologise for complicating the case with so many treatments , but owing to the unsuitability of atoxyl in the patient other treatment was a clinical necessity .
( 8 ) Effect of Trypanosome " On April 19 we commenced to give our patient subcutaneous injections of so-called vaccine .
This vaccine was obtained from the blood of a rat inoculated from our patient .
The rat was killed when the parasites were extremely numerous ( 500,000 per cubic millimetre of blood ) .
The blood was then drawn from its heart aseptically , and mixed with an equal volume of normal saline .
The red cells were allowed to settle , and the supernatant fluid pipetted off .
This latter contained most of the trypanosomes and the number per cubic millimetre was estimated by the thick film method .
It was then sterilised by heating to 55 ' C. for half-an-hour , and by adding trikresol so that it contained 0"2 per cent. The later vaccines which we commenced to use from May 17 were simply the blood of rats , taken when the trypanosomes were very numerous .
They consisted of dead trypanosomes , red cells , leucocytes , and serum .
The injection of these vaccines produced no local reaction , even in doses of 100.000 .
000 trypanosomes ; nor were we able to detect any definite temperature reaction .
We are inclined to think that the chief result of these injections of dead trypanosomes was a stimulation of the reproductive powers of the living trypanosomes .
This point , however , requires further elucidation .
We found that after an injection of our vaccine , the next trypanosome rise usually occurred before it was naturally due .
On April 9 , 9,000,000 dead trypanosomes were injected ; the next trypanosome rise reached its height on the seventh day .
20,000,000 were again injected on April 13 , and the following rise was completed on the sixth day .
40.000 .
000 were then injected and the next rise was completed on the fifth day .
The patient 's trypanosomes , also , which were rising to successively smaller heights , continued to diminish further in number , after two more injections of 10,000,000 dead trypanosomes on April 23 and 25 .
On April 28 , however , an injection of 100,000,000 was given when the trypanosomes were increasing , and that rise was the highest recorded .
This treatment was then stopped for some time .
It seems that the effect of these so-called vaccines , if injected immediately after the natural fall of the parasites , is a reproductive stimulation of the parasites , causing the next rise to occur sooner than was natural ; and this 1910 .
] * Sickness studied by Precise Enumerative Methods .
195 premature rise tends to be less high than it probably should have been in the natural course of events .
If , however , the vaccine be injected during the natural rise of the trypanosomes , it stimulates their reproduction , causing a very high and rapid rise , and the subsequent fall is also very sudden .
We confirmed these surmises later .
On May 17 an injection of 30,000,000 dead trypanosomes was given , with the result that the following rise was completed on the sixth day .
Another injection of 50,000,000 on May 30 was followed by a rise at the normal time .
A large dose of 100,000,000 , injected on June 4 , however , scarcely allowed the parasites any time to diminish , so that they completed their next rise on the fifth day , followed by a sudden fall .
Thus it would seem that the normal period of seven days between the rises of parasites may be shortened to six , five , and even four days , by an injection of dead trypanosomes .
Doses of vaccine up to 100,000,000 seemed to cause no harm .
On the contrary , during the period from the 7th to the 28th of April , when small doses were given , the temperature was more uniform , and more near to normal than it had ever been before or after .
Again , from the 14th to the 19th of May , the patient was extremely ill , almost comatose , with a high temperature , and like to die .
On May 17 he had vaccine ( 30,000,000 ) , followed on May 19 by an injection of 10 c.c. of leucocytic extract .
The improvement on May 20 was remarkable , both mentally and physically .
Of course , at that time he had atoxyl and nuclein to increase the leucocytes , hence it is almost impossible to tell which was the potent factor .
Against atoxyl having caused this good result , we may point out that it had no such effect either before or since .
As already stated , this marked improvement was coincident with a large increase of mononuclear leucocytes .
Wo tried again to repeat this success by injecting vaccine ( 100,000,000 trypanosomes ) on June 4 , three days before the height of the parasitic rise , and leucocytic extract at the height of the rise , but the result was not so good ( vide paper by Ross and J. G. Thomson* ) .
( 9 ) The Effect of Subcutaneous Injections of Leucocytic Extract .
Thinking that the fall in the number of leucocytes might be a factor in the rise of trypanosomes , we determined to keep up the numbers of leucocytes when they were falling .
Consequently , we tried an injection of nuclein ( 25 min. ) , but this did not seem to cause much increase of leucocytes .
Yeast , 15 grains daily ( by mouth ) , was also tried .
It seemed to cause some increase , but not marked .
* Infra , pp. 227\#151 ; 234 .
196 Major R. Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
Sleeping [ Oct. 15 , At this time Dr. Moore Alexander , pathologist to the hospital , suggested that we should try leucocytic extract .
He thought that this extract might contain certain substances which would be deleterious to the trypanosomes , or which would neutralise their endotoxins .
He was good enough to prepare it for us by injecting Mellin 's food into the pleural cavities of rabbits .
The rabbits were then killed , and the accumulation of leucocytes taken from the pleural cavity , and extracted with sterile distilled water .
To our surprise , the effect of an injection of this leucocytic extract was to produce a very great increase of leucocytes in the blood on the day following the injection .
This was almost the invariable result .
In our opinion , it seems to be a far more powerful promoter of leucocyte increase than yeast or nuclein .
We tried to utilise this discovery in two ways:\#151 ; ( i ) To help the natural leucocyte increase by injecting the extract just at the height of the trypanosome rise .
We did this on May 19 .
Next day , as we have mentioned , the patient showed a remarkable improvement .
We were unable , however , to get such a happy result again .
( ii ) By injecting the extract a day or two before the rise of parasites , we thought we might prevent that rise by causing an early increase in the leucocytes .
On May 31 10 c.c. of the extract were injected , producing next day an increase of leucocytes up to 20,000 per cubic millimetre of blood , but they diminished next day to 2,800 per cubic millimetre , and the increase of trypanosomes occurred all the same .
Later , just before the patient 's death , we tried the effect of 1 c.c. doses of the extract daily .
This seemed to keep the leucocyte count high , but unfortunately the results were complicated by the patient developing an abscess at this time , and later by the development of pleuropneumonia .
Further investigation with this substance , and with vaccine , would require to be made before coming to any definite conclusions .
Such an investigation we think would lead to further knowledge regarding the natural balance of immunity between the body and the parasites .
It appears to be a law ( at least it seems to hold good , we think ) with leucocytes and trypanosomes , that the extract of dead animal cells stimulates the corresponding live cells to increase in numbers .
This would appear to support the hypothesis put forward by Dr. H. 0 .
Boss , that the extracts of dead tissues promote the proliferation of living cells.* * 'Brit .

197 ( 10 ) Conclusions Regarding the Nature and Cause of the Trypanosome Cycle. .
The true explanation of this phenomenon must be of extreme importance , not only as regards the treatment of this disease , but also , we think , with regard to the problems of immunity in general .
Before stating our views we cannot do better than quote the following extract from the Sleeping Sickness Bulletin , 1909 , No. 12 , p. 485:\#151 ; " Res Causes des Crises Trypanolytiques et des Rechutes qui les suivent .
A. Massaglia .
' Comptes Bendus de l'Acad^mie des Sciences/ Octobre , 1907 .
" In some species of animals there are no crises .
The trypanosomes increase in a progressive regular manner .
In others the trypanosomes , after an increase , suddenly diminish to such an extent sometimes that they cannot be found in the blood .
They soon reappear .
Massaglia endeavoured to find out the cause of the crisis and the subsequent relapses . . . .
Conclusions : Trypanolytic crises are due to the formation of anti-bodies in the blood .
A few parasites escape destruction , because they become used or habituated to the action of these anti-bodies .
These are the parasites which cause the relapses .
Since the trypanosomes become more and more used to the antibodies the subsequent crises become less marked . . . .
Thiroux 's suggestion of a balance between anti-bodies and parasites is an interesting one and has some facts in its support .
It would serve to explain the cause of real or apparent cures mentioned in Bulletin No. 5 , pp. 193 and 195 .
" Here it is clear that Massaglia has observed and has tried to explain the occurrence of these natural rises and falls of trypanosomes .
Our opinions on the subject are as follows :\#151 ; ( i ) The Cycle is not Rue to an Unconditional Cyclical Revelopment of the Parasites as is the Case in Malarial Fever.\#151 ; If it were so then one would expect the cycle to be more regular , and one would not expect its time to be altered by vaccine injections .
The time between the rises varies not only in the same individual , but in different animals .
This would appear to suggest that the cycle is not due to a definite parasitic development as in malaria , but is merely a question of a struggle between the defensive powers of the infected body and the aggressive powers of the trypanosomes .
The more susceptible the animal the shorter is the period between the rises as seen in the case of rats , in which the cycle is almost lost .
Massaglia evidently failed to observe the slight remissions in the rat .
198 Major R. Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
Sleeping [ Oct. 15 , The greater the resistance of the infected animal the longer is the cyclical period , as in guinea-pigs and man .
By an " unconditional cycle " we mean one of which the 'period is not affected by the resistance of the host or by therapeutic agents\#151 ; as , for instance , that of Plasmodium : By a " conditional cycle " we mean one which is so affected\#151 ; as in the present case .
( ii ) The Increase of Parasites is Due to their Sudden and Active Multiplication.\#151 ; The presence of numerous dividing forms during the cyclical rise would seem to support this statement .
( iii ) The Multiplication of Trypanosomes is extremely Rapid.\#151 ; As before stated they seem capable of dividing in man three to four times in 24 hours .
In rats the rate of multiplication would seem much greater , as many as 10 divisions or generations may occur in 24 hours .
( iv ) The Rate of Multiplication depends on the Suitability of the Infected Blood to the Parasite.\#151 ; The blood of rats seems more suitable to the parasite than the blood of man and guinea-pigs .
Also this suitability would appear to vary from time to time in the same animal .
In our case there occurred high and low rises in the numbers of trypanosomes .
Moreover the three highest rises recorded in the chart were followed by the three lowest rises recorded .
This is a very significant fact .
It would appear to indicate that a high rise sets up some reactionary condition .
This reaction , if great , not only causes the decrease of trypanosomes but extends its influence so far as to reduce the next rise .
( v ) The Fall in Number of Parasites is not Due to the Toxins they Develop.\#151 ; In man the numbers may reach only 200 per cubic millimetre of blood and then they diminish , whereas in rats they may reach over 200,000 per cubic millimetre of blood and yet continue to rise , and the toxins in the latter case must be much more abundant than in the former .
It would seem , therefore , that the explanation may be reduced to some of the following causes , all of which may come into play .
( i ) The Increase of Trypanosomes is due to their Active Multiplication , the rate of multiplication depending on the following conditions:\#151 ; ( a ) The liberation of a reproductive stimulant from the dead trypanosomes of the previous fall .
( b ) The small number of leucocytes , especially mononuclears .
( c ) The habituation of the trypanosomes to their anti-bodies .
( d ) The absence or the diminution of anti-bodies to the trypanosomes .
( ii ) The Decrease of Trypanosomes is Due to their Rapid Death and to a floss and Thomson .
