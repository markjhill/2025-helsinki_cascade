An abstract of the results deduced from the measurement of an arc on the meridian , extending from latitude 8§ 9 ' 38t4 , to latitude 18 3 ' e3t',6 , N ; being an amplitude of 9§ 53 ' 45 " , .
By Leieut .
Colonel William Lambton , F. R. S. 33d Regiment offoot .
Tead May si , Is8i8 IN the i th vol. of the Asiatick Researches , there are detailed accounts of two complete sections of an arc on the meridian , measured by me at different times , in prosecuting the trigo .
nometrical survey of the Peninsula of India .
The first is comprehended between the parallels of Punne , a station near Cape Comoriin , in latitude 8 9 ' 88"39 , and Patchipolliam n Coimbetoor , in latitude log 5948",93 ; being an amplitude of 50'10o",54 .
The second is comprehended between the parallels of Patchipolliam and Namthabad , a station near Gooty , in the ceded districts ; and lying in latitude !
5§ 6 ' o ' " , l gives an amplitude of § 6 ' iei,8 .
Since these measurements were made , I have had the good fortune to get another section , extending from Namthabad to Dautnergidda , in the Nizam 's dominions , which being in latitude 18§ 3 ' 23",6 , gives an increase of § 57 ' 3",.32 ; making in the whole an arc of 9§ 53 45",14 in amplitude ; the longest single arc that has ever been measured on the surface of this globe .
The detailed accounts of this last arc , with various conclusions concerning the three sections , have been presented to the Asiatick Society by the Marquess of HIASTXNGS , the present Governor General , and will be published in the iMth volume of the Asiatick Researches .
But as it may be three or four years before that volume makes its appearance , I have been induced to draw out this abstract of the results , thinking that the conclusions herein contained may be interesting to the Royal Society , and to the astronomers of Europe .
As a reference may be made to the volumes above mentioned , I have simply given the lengths of the sides of the triangles from which the arcs are deduced , together with the lengths of the terrestrial and celestial arcs , without including either the tables of triangles , or the particulars of the astronomical observations , farther than the names of the stars , and the mean lengths of the celestial arcs , and , consequently , the mean degrees deduced therefrom .
The first of these sections gives the degree due to latitude 9'84 4 , the middle point of that arc , equal 60472,8$ fathoms .
The second section , whose middle point is in latitude '13 " ' 55 " , gives the mean degree equal 60487,56 fathoms .
The last section gives the degree equal 60o51,78 fathoms , due to the latitude of i6§ 34 ' 4 " , the middle point of that section .
In my second paper , in the 1tth vol. of the Asiatick Researches , it appeared that the degree due to latitude 1l 37 ' 491 " , the middle point between Punnse and Namthabad , was 60480,3 fathoms .
Since that paper was sent , there has been a small correction applied to the base near Gooty , after comparing the chains with the brass standard scale .
This correction has somewhat increased the meridional distance between that base and Yerracondah south ; and , consequently , the whole terrestrial arc between Namthabad and Punne is also increased , .
which now gives the degree due to latitude ?
10 3749 " , equal 60481,55 fathoms .
However , as there are now three distinct sections , whose respective middle points lie in 9 ?
-3'4 ; 13 ' 55 ; and 163 ' 4'42 " ; I have thought it best to take the degrees due to these latitudes , as deduced from actual observation , using each , first with the French measure , then with the English , and lastly with the Swedish measure ; and thence obtaining a general mean for the compression at the poles .
Thefirst mean of these three degrees used with the French degree , gives the compression 309 , .
The second mean of the same three degrees used with the English degree , gives 3 , .
And the third mean of these three degrees used with the Swedish degree , gives 7 for the compression ; so that the mean of these three means will give the compression at the poles 3 ' or 3nearly of the polar axes ; and this has been finally adopted for computing the general tables of degrees from the equator to the pole .
It will be seen by inspecting the plan of the triangles , ( P1 .
XXIII .
) that all the sides from which the arc has been deduced lie so near the meridian , that no correction has been required ; a circumstance that has saved much trouble .
The sides being so nearly north and south , that the base reduced from each side as an hypothenuse , may be considered as a chord of an arc parallel , and so nearly contiguous to the meridian , that it may , as to sense , be taken as the chord to the same arc on the meridian ; and these chords being in general short , they will be the same as the arcs , very nearly .
I have ti e efre not been at the trouble of applying any correction ; or if the whole arc between Punnae and Daumergidda ( upwards of 680 miles ) were divided into small arcs of o3 miles each , the whole difference between these arcs and tieir chords would not be more than a fathom and a haf The number of base lines in this extensive arc are five all measured with the chain extended in coffers ; wit elevating screws , &amp; c ; and every part of the operation has been performed with the greatest posssible attention .
Th one near Bangalore may be considered as the first ; and its height above the sea was obtained by a series of triangles connecting it with another base near St. Thomas 's Mount , whose height above the low water mark was determined by observations made at the sea beach , and at the race stand near the north end of the base ( Asiat .
Res. vol.viii .
) .
The base lines to the southward are , the one in Coimbetoor , and the other near Tinnivelly , whose heights above the sea were determined from the Bangalore base .
Those to the northward are , the base near Gooty , and the one near Daumergidda .
The account of this last measurement , and of the curious experiments for comparing the steel chains with the brass standard scale , will appear in the i3th volume of the Asiatick Researches .
The particulars of the other measurements may be seen in the 10th and isth volumes of the same work .
The great station of observation at Doddaguntah , is near the first base line ; and it was at that station where the position of the meridian was fixed for extending it to the north and south .
The latitude of that station was also determined by observing the zenith distances of a number of stars from the Greenwich catalogue for i80o .
That latitude , however , was afterwards set aside from a supposed disturbance of the plummet .
The latitude was afterwards fixed from observations made at Punnae , the southernmost station of observation , by setting off degrees corresponding to different latitudes , after they were finally determined .
As Doddaguntah station has been left out in the divisions of the grand arc , its latitude was only useful in fixing that of Savendroog , one of the great meridian stations for crossing the Peninsula ( Asiatick Researches , vol. i. ) .
The other remaining stations of observation are , Patchipolliam , or Coimbetoor ; Namthabad , near Gooty ; and Daumergidda , in the Nizam 's domiinons .
We shall now see how these stations are connected by the triangles ; Doddaguntah being the referring station in counting the northings , southings , &amp;c. ; and to whose meridian the whole terrestrial arc is reduced .
Without regarding the order of time , we will set off from Doddaguntah to Patchipolliam , and thence to Punnae .
After which we will return to Doddaguntah , and proceed northerly to Namthabad , and from Namthabad to Daumergidda .

g4 4g is '60478 the degree due to latitude 2§ 2 ' j5,5 is 60487,6 the degree due to latitude 16§ 3 '4 is 605`,78 It now remains to compare each of these mean degrees first with the French measurement ; then with the English ; and lastly with the Swedish ; and by proceeding on the elliptic theory , deduce from these data three mean ellipticities , and from these three a general mean , which must give nearly the true compression at the poles , Previous to this determination , it will be necessary to inves " tigate the requisite formule for obtaining the compression by a comparison of measured degrees in distant latitudes ; and first , by the measured degrees on the meridian .
Let m ' and m be the measured degrees , in latitudes 'I and I ; and let a represent the equatorial diameter , and b the polar axis : that is , supposing the earth to be an ellipsoid , let a and b represent the transverse and conjugate axes of an elliptic meridian .
Then it is known from conic sections and the nature of curvature , that.2 ( Cos.a-+Si .
- , ) .
is the radius abz of curvature of the ellipse at '1 ; and that CTos^ a^asin bl is the radius of curvature of the same , or any other elliptic meridian , on the same ellipsoid , at the point 1 .
And since the degrees at 'land I are as the radii of curvature at these points , we have mi ' : " n : ... ... ... 2 ( Cost1 B/ , at+ Sin.1b 'I 1f ) , &lt; z ( Cos1( .

Now to simplify this expression , if a= i , e the ellipticity ; and therefore b=1 e , and b2 =2e nearly , because e must be very small .
Then will m ' : m : : ( Cos.2 '1 + ( 1 2e ) .

And if ( Sin. " ' ) and ( i Sin. 1 ) be substituted for Cos. 'I and Cos. 2 .
the expression will be transformed into ( i -e .
Sin.2 ')-g and ( x ee .
Sin. 1 ) - ; or 1+ e. Sin. 2 ' and i -+ 3e .

&amp;c. from which it appears that the increments to the degrees , beginning with the lowest latitude , will always be as the increments to the squares of the sines of the corresponding latitudes : and if m be at the equator where the Sin.

' 2o " , which is 60820 fathoms ; and lastly with the Swedish degree in latitude 66§ 2o ' i , " when it is 6o955 fathoms .
With respect to the French degree , as there appears much irregularity in the different sections of the arc between Dunkirk and Montjouy , I have used that between the Pantheon at Paris , and Eveaux , as given by DE LAMBRE in the Base du Systeme Metrique , as it appears to be the most consistent .
This degree is 57066 toises , equal to 60798 fathoms .
But their measurements being all reduced to the temperature of Se2 of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer , the above degree will require a deduction of 19 fathoms nearly , to make it what it would have measured by the brass standard at the temperature of 62 ?
, which is our standard temperature .
Hence , 60779 fathoms is the degree in latitude 47§ 3o0 46 " to compare with the Indian measurements .
Let this degree be denoted by m ; and its latitude , 47§ 3o ' 46 " by 'l ; and let the degree 60472,83 fathoms be , and its latitude 9 ?

All this is supposing the earth to be an ellipsoid .
But that 503 these Indian measurements may rest on their own ground , I shall examine whether the increments to a succession of contiguous degrees as deduced from the present data , be consistent with the elliptic hypothesis , beginning with the degree in latitude 9§ 3 4 ' " , as determined by observation .
To effect this let m( ) , m( ) , m3 ) &amp;c. be the measures of complete contiguous degrees on the meridian in latitudes l( ) , 1l( ) , ( 3 ) , &amp;c.

I shall therefore adopt it with the compression ~-o for computing the general tables of degrees for every third degree of latitude from the equator to the pole .
With respect , however , to the compression , that nothing may be left undone to give full and entire satisfaction on this subject , I shall here add an investigation similar to that given by Professor PLAYFAIR , in the 5th vol. of the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions , where , in place of using the measures of degrees due to particular latitudes , two measured arcs of large amplitudes are made use of , the latitudes of whose extremities have been determined with great accuracy .
Let ADBE be a meridian of the earth , where A is at the equator , and D at the pole .
~ Suppose F to be any point on / . .
, J that meridian , and FH the ra/ dius of curvature of the ellipse B at that point .
Putt A Ca ; DC = b ; c being the centre of the ellipse ; and let A be equal the angle AKF , the latitude of F ; or let it be the measure of the arc of latitude a Kf , to radius unity , or aK : that is , the measure of the angle aKf in parts of the radius aK , or unity .
Let GF be an indefinitely small part of the ellipse .
Then if AF = z , GH --i the fluxion of the arc AF of the ellipse ; and if GH be drawn , then the angle GHIF = &lt; g Kf =A orfg the fluxion of the arc of latitude af to radius i. Hence as 1 : A : FH : =A.FH .
But the radius of curvature FH =a b ' ( a a " .
Sin. 2A+ b1 Sin. A)- .
Let e be the ellipticity , or a b ; then b= a-e , and b &amp; =a ae very nearly , since e ' is very small .
Hence FH =a ( a e ) .

Hence FH a3 ( ae ) .

Sin. A ) =a-'2e +e Sini , A , which substituted for FH , we get Z= A(a--2e -+ e. Sin 2A ) =A ( a2e ) +A ( 3e .
Sin. 2A ) .
But Sin.2 A= I , COS. zA and therefore .
=-A ( a-2e ) + 3e Ae .
Cos.,2 A ; whose fluent is z= ( a-4e A+e .
Sin. A=aA--e ( A+e A. Sin.sA ) which requires no correction .
And this is the measure of an which requires no correction .
And this is the measure of an arc on the meridian extending from the equator to the latitude of the point F ; where A denotes the arc of latitude in parts of the radius i. Let F ' be any other point on the meridian , whose arc of latitude is A ' .
Then AF '= a A'-e ( A + A ' .

Let F " , F " ' , be any other two points on the meridian whose respective arcs of latitude are A " and A " ' .

But there must be some mistake in this ; for by comparing it with the distance between Montjouy and Dunkirk , as given by DE LAMBRE , the former is considerably greater than the latter , though Montjouy is 3 " south of Barcelona .
The mrlean degree for latitude 470§ 24 used in that paper for determining the ellipticity , compared with the Indian measurements , was deduced from that arc , and gave the compression ~-L , while the general mean compression obtained by comparing these measurements with the French , English , and Swedish degrees , was -3 nearly .
Since it is here determined to adopt 5as the compression , and 60491,46 fathoms for the measure of the degree on the meridian , due to latitude 13§ 3$ ' 44 ' ; we shall have m'60491,46 ; '1/ 13 § 34 ' 44 ' Then if m be the degree I+ 3e , Sin.

Now since 6972668 is the diameter of the equatorial circle , then,141Q59 , &amp;c. multiplied by 6972668 , gives 21905280 fathoms for the circumference of the circumscribing the elliptic meridian .

, was 39,371 , English inches , which exceeds this one by , oo5 inches : a quantity too small to affect any standard measure : so that the metre as deduced from a comparison of all the recent operations , may be considered , as to practical purposes , the same as that which has been adopted by the French mathematicians , being obtained from comparing the measurements of DE LAMBRE and MECHAIN , with those of BouGUER and CONDAMINE .
As I am in hopes that another section , and perhaps more , will be added to the arc , I shall defer making any final conclusions till I see what may be done .
The next station of observation , I propose to be as near the latitude of 21§ 6 ' 51 " as possible , in order that the middle point of the section may fall in 190 34 .
44 " , so as to compare the mean degree as obtained by observation , with the one computed from the increments as in the foregoing tables .
I say another section , and perhaps more ; because should the country to the northward be open and settled , there may be a possibility at some future day , of continuing the same arc to the northern confines of Hindostan : so much , at least , seems necessary for laying the foundation of Indian geography ; and if it were conducted with zeal and judgment , it would not be a work of many years , provided the features of the country be favourable .
The whole time taken up in the measurement of the arc between Punnae and Daumergidda , including the base lines , astronomical observations , &amp;c. ; that is to say , the entire field work , has only been three years and nine months ; and a considerable part of the corrections for the stars , for the angles , and for the reduction of the base , were done duritg the time of measuring the base and observing for the zenith distances ; so that I suppose fouryears and a half may be allowed for the whole work .
From this estimate , the meridional arc might be continued from Daumergidda to Dhelli in about five years , if no local impediment disturbed its progress .
It is however probable that difficulties might occur in Sindia 's country , MDcccSVIII .
S X which a northern direction from Daumergidda would render it necessary to pass through .
But it would be a sufficient point gained , if a series of triangles were carried from Nagpoor in Berar , to Kalpy on the Jumna , which two places , if the maps are correct , lie nearly on the same meridian .
From Kalpy , the meridional series might perhaps be continued north to the Kemaoon mountains ; Kalpy would also be a favourable position from which to extend a series to the east and west , and for meridian stations not more than sixty or seventy miles from each other , where the positions of the meridians ought to be determined by pole star observations .
Data would then be had for extending the survey on a more enlarged scale over the upper provinces ; and the arc between Nagpoor and Kalpy might be easily reduced to the one terminating in latitude 21§ 6 ' ( that station of observation and the one near Nagpoor being connected ) , so as to form one entire arc between the parallels of Punnas and Kalpy .
Thus would be formed a geometrical connection between the southern and northern possessions of the East India company , and a complete basis laid for local and detailed surveys of the whole..Innumerable might be the individuals employed in carrying them into effect , and various might be the description of these surveys .
By the assistance of this work as a foundation , they might all be rendered useful ; ;but without it , no combination of the best common surveys could ever be formed into a correct map to embrace such an extensive territory as Britishl India .
