[ Abstract .
] While the author was engaged in some experimental determinations of the changes that take place in the composition of the Cinchona barks after being taken from the tree , he noticed a somewhat singular circumstance , which induced him to institute a series of experiments , by which he discovered that the various parts of living plants excrete carbonic acid , not only in their normal condition , but after they have been deprived for days together of all access of oxygen .
The experiments were mostly made on cut portions of the plants ; but experiments were also made , for control , on plants as they actually grow .
The deprivation of oxygen was effected sometimes by Sprengel 's air-pump , sometimes by substituting for air an atmosphere of hydrogen or nitrogen ; while comparative experiments were made on plants supplied with air that had been freed from carbonic acid .
The main conclusions to which he was led are those enunciated by the author:1st .
That nearly all parts of growing plants evolve carbonic acid in considerable quantities , quite independently of direct oxidation .
2nd .
That this evolution is connected with the life of the plant .
3rd .
That it is due to two causes , namely , to previous oxidation , resulting after a lapse of time in the production of carbonic acid , and to the separation of carbonic acid from the proximate principles of the plant while undergoing the chemical changes incident to plant-growth .
