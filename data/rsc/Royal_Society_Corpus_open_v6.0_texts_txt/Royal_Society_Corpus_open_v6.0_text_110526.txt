" Researches in the Integral Calculus .
" Part II .
By Henry Fox Talbot , Esq. , F.R.S. Having explained , in the first part of his paper , a general method of finding the sums of integrals , the author proposes , in the second place , to apply this method to discover the properties of different transcendents , beginning with those of the simplest nature .
With this view , he first shows its application to the arcs of the circle and the conic sections 5 and demonstrates the possibility of finding three arcs , such that , neglecting their signs , the sum of two of them shall be equal to the third , though not superposable in any part : an equality which has been hitherto deemed impossible in the ellipse and hyperbola , without the addition of some algebraic quantity .
At a Special General Meeting of this Society , held after the or ?
dinary Meeting of the 17th of November , to consider of an Address to H.R.H. the President , on the happy recovery of his sight , It was Resolved unanimously , That this meeting feels great pleasure in congratulating H.R.H. the President of this Society , on the happy restoration of his sight , a blessing which they sincerely hope he may long enjoy for his own happiness and for the benefit of science .
