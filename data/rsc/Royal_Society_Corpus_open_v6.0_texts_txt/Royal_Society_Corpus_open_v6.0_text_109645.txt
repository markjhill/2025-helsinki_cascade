Observations and Measurements of the Planet Vesta .

] The observations contained in Mr. Schroeter 's communication , comprise those of Dr. Olbers , made at Bremen , from the 29th of March to the 6th of May , and those of Mr. Bessel at Lilienthal , from the 1st of April to the 11th of May ; from which it appears that this planet , now called Vesta , became stationary between the 8th and Ilth of May , and is now progressive .
Mr. Schroeter endeavoured also to ascertain her magnitude ; with magnifying powers of 150 and 300 applied to a 15-feet reflector she seemed equal to a star of the 6th magnitude , but without any appearance of a disc .
Mr. Schroeter , and his assistant , both saw the planet at that time with the naked eye .
As they had formerly observed Ceres , Pallas , and Juno , with a 13-feet reflector , and with eye-glasses magnifying 136 and 288 times , they now examined Vesta with the same telescope and the same powers , and found her appearance to be exactly the same , her apparent diameter not exceeding 4-T,8 , ths of a second , which\/ Ir .
Schroeter says is only one half the apparent diameter of the 4th satellite of Saturn .
Mr. Schroeter considers the intensity and unsteadiness of its light , together with its extraordinary smallness , as very remarkable for a body which , according to the calculations of Dr. Gauss , is in the same region between Mars and Jupiter , in which thethree other lately discovered planets perform their revolutions round the sun .
