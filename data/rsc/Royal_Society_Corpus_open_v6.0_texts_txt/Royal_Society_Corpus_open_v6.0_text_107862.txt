On the expediency of assigning specific names to all such functions of simple elements as represent definite physical properties ; with the suggestion of a new term in mechanics ; illustrated by an investigation of the machine moved by recoil , and also by some observations on the Steam Engine .
By DAVIES GILBERT , Esq. M. P. V. P. R. S. &amp;c. Read January 25 , 1827 .
1 HE expediency of distinguishing by separate appellations , all such functions of simple elements as measure the intensity of physical properties , will be rendered obvious by referring to the well known controversy respecting motion .
Scarcely had the principles which regulate the action of bodies in motion become subjected to mathematical calculation , when a dispute arose as to the measure of motion itself ; a dispute conducted with much more vehemence and acrimony than might be supposed incident to the nature of an abstract subject .
Several individuals of the greatest learning and reputation contended that weight , multiplied by velocity , ( w x v ) gave a product always proportionate to the motion of bodies , as was proved by a comparison of their inertia2 , by all the properties relative to the common centre of gravity in planetary systems , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. ; while other persons , scarcely inferior to the former , adverting to the collision of elastic bodies , and to the extremely curious property of motion , the conservatio virium vivarum , contended with equal confidence , that the true measure of motion was weight multiplied into the velocity squared ( w x v ) ; till , in the early part of the last century it was fortunately observed , that the different properties indicated by these two functions were not , in any respect , at variance with each other ; and the terms momentum and impetus reconciled all opinions , by removing every ground for dispute .
For a full and detailed explanation of this subject , I would refer to the admirable treatise on " The Rectilinear Motion and Rotation of Bodies , " by the late GEORGE ATWOOD , Fellow 6f Trinity College , Cambridge , F. R. S. printed in 1784 ; and to the Bakerian Lecture in the Philosophical Transactions for i8o6 , by an existing member of this Society , who has never touched any point of science : that hehas not elucidated and adorned .
In this Lecture it is observed , that neither impetus nor momentum have usually much to do with the action of ordinary machines ; which is undoubtedly true ; since neither of these functions measures directly their efficient power .
The criterion of their efficiency is force multiplied by the space through which it acts ( f x s ) ; and the effect which they produce , measured in the same way , has been denominated duty , a term first introduced by Mr. WATT , in ascertaining the comparative merit of steam engines , when he assumed one pound raised one foot high , for what has since been called , in other countries , the dynamic unit.* And by this criterion , one bushel of coal , weighing 84lbs .
has been found to perform a duty of thirty , forty , and even fifty millions ; augmenting with improvements chiefly in the fire place , which produce a more rapid combustion , with consequently increased temperature , and a more complete absorption of the generated heat ; in addition to expansive working , and to the use " of steam raised considerably above atmospheric pressure .
Since therefore a machine is efficient in producing duty , or effect , in proportion to the force applied , multiplied into the space through which it acts , I propose to denominate this function ( f x s ) efficiency ; retaining the word duty for a similar function indicative of the work performed .
And it is obvious , that by a comparison of these two quantities , the effciency expended on any machine , and the duty performed by it , an exact measure will be ascertained of its intrinsic worth .
Having never seen a full investigation of the engine moved by recoil , I am partly , on that account , induced to take it as an example of the utility to be derived from the use of this new term ; and I am in part also induced to do so , by the circumstance of a most respectable society having last year held out the properties of BARKER'S mill to the public , as fit objects for inquiry .
To investigate the Recoil engine .
Let every thing be taken in the abstract , and after a manner most advantageous to the machine .
Suppose friction to vanish , and that the perpendicular tube , and the arms , are so capacious as to allow of the fluid issuing with a velocity equal to what a body would acquire by falling in free space , through an elevation equal to that of the perpendicular tube , or through , what is usually termed , the head .
See Principia , B. 2 . ? ?

1o ' -* I Let I= the space in English feet through which a body freely descends in one second of time .
Then 2I= the velocity acquired .
h= the length of the perpendicular tube , or the actual height of the head .
Thean 2 Vh I the velocity due to the head .
Let R the length of either arm from the centre to the orifice .
x= the velocity with which that point moves in revolving , expressed by feet in a second .
Then -j= the centrifugal force at the orifice .
And since the force exerted by each particle of the fluid varies as its distance from the centre R x ?
_ -"X R= 4-1 the whole pressure from centrifugal force .
An expression independent of the length of the arm ; and the slightest reflection will make it appear that no alteration can arise from deflecting the form of the arm out of a straight line .
Then , since the pressure exerted by the actual head is expressed by its height ( h ) , and the pressure from centrifugal force by t- , ' h+x= the pressure sustained , or the virtual head , and ( h +)xx= the efficiency applied to the machine , in relation however , not to the expenditure of fluid corresponding to the height ( h ) , but to an expenditure greater in the proportion of V1+ -l ) to 1 .
But a portion of this efficiency must , of necessity , be expended in giving the rotary velocity ( x ) to the quantity of fluid issuing =V + .
Now the height due to x is - , consequently i/ 1 + xh .
xx= the expenditure of efficiency in producing the rotary motion .
And ( h + z4 -V1 + -l xL)xx the efficiency applied to the machine capable of producing duty .
Now substitute for x , ( the velocity due to h ) ( 2 Vh 1 ) multiplied by an arbitrary quantity y ; then Vi + -x ( or the quantity of fluid issuing ) V= " / i + y2 and ( y + y3 _ V'i y ' x y3 ) x2h1= the efficiency ; and dividing by ^/ ;i y j/ i + y ' x y3 X2 h2 = the efficiency that would be applied if no more fluid issued than what is due to the actual head ( h ) .
The following Table exhibits the value of both these functions , taking ( y ) from o ( where the duty must obviously be nothing ) by steps of -rsths to 1.25 ; after which the duty becomes negative .

From an inspection of the Table , it appears that when the machine is moving with the velocity productive of its greatest relative effect , namely , at three quarter parts of the velocity with which the fluid would issue under a pressure equal to that of the actual head , that the duty exceeds by a mere trifle one half of the efficiency expended ; and from thence it obviously follows , that the recoil engine cannot in any case be n one whole or in )e= 7981799 z418774 763726i i855748 I employed with advantage .
The water wheel , whenever the fall does not exceed forty or fifty feet ; and the pressure engine , provided with an air vessel , in all cases where the fall is greater , receive an efficiency almost equal to the whole expended , instead of one half ; and in practice , the duty will reach three quarters .
The wheel moreover possesses a selfregulating power , sufficiently accurate for the present illustration , and somewhat analogous to the isochronism of the pendulum ; that is , the actual weight of water on the wheel , and its velocity of rotation , must always be reciprocal to each other ; thus maintaining a given efficiency , independent of velocity .
The received efficiency of a water wheel being represented by the pounds of water passing over it x by the fall in feet , less the height due to the velocity with which the periphery moves in its rotation .
But in the recoil engine , the moving power is expending at the rate due to the height even when the machine is actually standing still ; and when it moves with a velocity exceeding that due to the length of the head , in the proportion of about 128 : 1 ( where the duty is again nothing ) the moving power will be expended at the increased rate of V ' + ( 1.28 ) : i. Here too may be easily shown the utter impossibility of executing a plan , which would not indeed deserve any notice , were it not that two ingenious practical engineers have within these few years , although at different times , and independently of each other , incurred large expense , and employed much pains in attempting to apply steam on the principle of recoil .
It is obvious that one of the factors , namely force ( or the pressure of recoil ) , must in this case be extremely small , since an aperture of one inch square will discharge about s ' imperial gallons of water each minute in the form of steam , unassisted by centrifugal force , while the pressure amounts to no more than 14,66 pounds .
The other factor ( velocity ) must therefore be made proportionably great to produce an adequate effect .
Now , since air rushes into a vacuum with the velocity of 1295 feet in a second log .

is said to have a specific gravity compared to air of 0.6235 Log. 9.7948365 2= 9.8974183 arith .

0.1025817 A velocity of 1640 feet in a second 3.2148515 Three quarters of this velocity in rotation will be requisite for imparting an efficiehcy to the machine of about one half of the efficiency expended .
But such a velocity nearly equals that of a cannon shot , and the effect of centrifugal force on the arms ( -y ) would produce a strain equal to the weight of 41776 feet of the material composing them , independently of the strain arising from centrifugal force of the fluid they contain .
And as the modulus of tenacity for iron is estimated at 14800 feet , the centrifugal force will exceed that tenacity almost three times .
But independently of this insuperable obstacle , any velocity adequate to the production of an useful efficiency must be utterly unmanageable in every other respect ; nor is it easy to imagine the possibility of any expedient , similar to the air pump of Mr. WATT , for maintaining the vacuum in which their arms are to revolve .
The Steam Engine .
To estimate the efficiency of steam acting uniformly with its entire force , at a power corresponding to 30 inches of barometrical pressure , in reference to the consumption of one bushel of coal , I assume , from repeated experiments , that 14 cubic feet of water may be converted into steam , by that given consumption of fuel , occupying about 1330 times more space than the water from which it was produced .
The whole space therefore filled by the steam amounts to 18620 cubic feet , capable of containing 1'150410 pounds of water ; and as 30 inches of mercury at a specific gravity of 13.568 correspond to a column of water 33.92 feet in length , through this space the 1'15041o pounds of water may be supposed to be raised when a vacuum is formed , giving an efficiency of 39'S36ooo , or above thirty nine millions of pounds raised one foot high .
But when this power of steam is applied through the medium of a piston , acting in the cylinder of a steam engine , large deductions must be made to arrive at the practical duty .
The air pump is usually constructed of a size to require about one eighth part of the efficiency ; Some imperfection in the vacuum cannot be avoided ; And friction must exist to a considerable amount where bodies in motion have to confine an elastic vapour , ready to escape through the smallest aperture .
So that thirty millions would probably have exceeded the attainable limit of duty , but for two expedients : First .
Causing the steam to act expansively , after exerting its whole force through a certain part of the cylinder ; and Secondly .
Raising the temperature much above 212 ?
of Fahrenheit , and thereby communicating to the steam a power beyond what is termed atmospheric strength ; but this is , of course , accompanied by an additional expenditure of fuel .
The plan of working expansively is founded on the following investigation .

Then let the supply of steam from the B boiler be cut off by the valve at ( v ) and conceive the piston to have descended B to B through the space ( x ) urged by the expansive elasticity of the steam , the density of which will then be -I +x and assuming that densities and elasticities are proportionate , X will be 1.693 2.o99 the fluxion of the efficiency , and the 2.386 efficiency itself equal the not .

i+ x , giving this very curious 3I97 result , that when x is infinite , the effi3.303 ciency also exceeds any assignable limit..3.398 But it is obvious that several important circumstances have been omitted : The reduction of temperature , and consequently of elasticity , caused by rarefaction , as the steam expands : The increased relative effect occasioned by the reaction of the imperfect vacuum : The increased relative burden of the air pump .
The relative increase of friction .
So that although this mode of working is highly advantageous , yet it is probable that , in practice , not more than from one half to two thirds of the cylinder can beneficially be occupied by expansive steam .
This mode of working has yet a further beneficial effect .
The steam , beginning to act with its entire force , imparts the requisite velocity , by rapidly overcoming the inertia ; and this force diminishing in the latter part of the stroke , allows the machine to exhaust the motion imparted , as it tends towards its close ; thus also avoiding all violent percussion , which must obviously prove most injurious to the machinery , and in other respects be a pure loss .
It would be unfair towards the memory of a very ingenious man , were I to omit noticing , that much about the time when Mr. WATT introduced this method of using the expansive power of steam , a modification of the same principle was invented by Mr. JONATHAN HORNBLOWER , of Penryn in Cornwall .
According to this method , instead of condensing the steam after it had passed under the piston , in the working cylinder , the steam is allowed to expand itself over a second piston in a second cylinder , when it is finally condensed in the usual manner ; and if the second cylinder exceeds the first in the proportion of 1+x to i , the theoretical effect will be identical with that produced by the former method .
But the mode invented by Mr. WATT excels the other in simplicity , and causes less friction .
The second expedient , that of employing steam at an high degree of temperature , and consequently of pressure , suggested itself in the following manner .
Experiments had shown , that a quantity of heat about nine hundred times greater than what is required to raise the temperature of a given weight of water one degree of Fahrenheit 's thermometer , becomes latent in the conversion of that water into steam .
That an elevation of temperature to 400 of Fahrenheit above ?
1 ?
' doubles the steam 's elastic force , and that o30 more treble it ; great expectations were consequently formed of the increased power that would be obtained , from a given consumption of fuel , by using high pressure steam ; but the following most important circumstances were overlooked , till experience forced them into view .
That the temperature of steam cannot be raised , with a speed suited to mechanical purposes , in any other way than through the medium of its generating water .
And that water heated above a 2 ?
sends off more steam , with a proportionate absorption of latent heat , increasing the density of the steam previously generated of atmospheric elasticity , thus doubling its power at 212 ?
+ 400 ; but at an expense of fuel , not much inferior to the power gained .
If steam could be heated , as an independent elastic fluid , expanding T- , th of its bulk for each degree of Fah .
; and if its capacity were the same as the capacity of water , a quantity of heat , equal to that rendered latent , would raise the power from unity 900 to 4-41 ) 63 .
If the capacities of steam and water , according to some recent experiments , be as 1,5 to i , the increase of 900 power will be from unity to 48 s3 .
But the non-conducting property , common to all elastic fluids , has hitherto prevented this advantage from being obtained .
Heated through the medium of its generating water , high pressure steam is believed however to be advantageous ; and by its means additional power may be obtained , when an increase is requisite for any temporary use .
A contrivance has recently been attempted , by which a given small quantity of water is forced into a minute boiler at each stroke of the engine , and the boiler , presenting a very large surface in proportion to its content , is kept at an equable high temperature by immersion in a fuzed metal .
Thus great degrees of elasticity and of rarity may be combined ; and the plan seems worthy of being fully prosecuted .
But the main hope of augmented power , for still further elevating the condition of the human race , by increasing the empire of intellect over brute force , and for accelerating that splendid career , which , originating with the inventions of the plough and of the loom , has acquired such unhoped for rapidity in our own times , appears to rest on the application to mechanical purposes of some fluid more elastic than the vapour of water , according to the suggestion of our President in the Philosophical Transactions for 1823 .

W B From this document it appears , that several of the large engines now at work in Cornwall , are actually performing a duty about one quarter part greater than would be the whole efficiency of steam , unaided by expansive working , or by high pressure ; assuming that fourteen cubic feet of water is the quantity converted into steam by a bushel of coal ; but other engines , apparently similar in every respect , fail in performing half this duty ; and no satisfactory cause has yet been assigned for the important difference .
As examples of the power and energies of the human mind , these applications of fire , through the medium of an elastic fluid , to mechanical purposes , stand pre-eminently distinguished : as elaborate contrivances useful to man , steam engines are confessedly without a rival .
No series of investigations can therefore be more worthy of minute and accurate attention than one which may enable us to connect by general laws , the temperatures , the densities , the elasticities , the capacities for heat , and the quantities rendered latent in assuming the elastic form ; first for steam , and then , if possible , for all other bodies capable of existing in a gaseous state , both in contact with their generating fluids , and in complete separation from them .
I have gone more at length into the principles of the steam engine , than the immediate object of this Paper either requires or can warrant ; but I trust that the Society will admit the great importance of the subject as an excuse ; a subject with which local circumstances have rendered me familiar during the whole of my life ,
