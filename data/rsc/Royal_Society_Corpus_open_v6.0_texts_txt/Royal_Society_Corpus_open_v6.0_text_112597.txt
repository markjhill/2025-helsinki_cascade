" Extract of a Letter from CHARLES CHAMBERS , Esq. , Acting Superintendent of the Bombay Magnetic Observatory , to the President .
Dated March 28 , 1866 .
" Communicated by the President .
Received April 26 , 1866 .
You will probably have heard from Mr. Stewart that the opportunity of applying usefully the experience which I acquired at Kew has been tem porarily accorded to me by the Bombay Government , by my appointment to the superintendence of this Observatory .
The confirmation of my present appointment will probably depend upon the sanction of the scheme of improvements for the Observatory which I have just sent in for the consideration of Government .
Meanwhile I have arranged the working power of the establishment so as to take up the reduction of the old observations , and I am sure you will be interested to learn that there is a probability of their turning out trustworthy and valuable .
The separation of seven years of declination-disturbances has already been effected , with the results shown in the enclosed Tables and Curves ; but as the whole series of observations ( from 1845 to 1865 ) will include two complete cycles of the decenniaI period , and as the reductions have already been so long delayed , I propose completing the twenty-one years before discussing the connected questions and publishing the whole ; it is , however , a little doubtful whether the opportunity of doing this will be afforded me , as the Indian Government , in sanctioning my appointment , have limited its duration to the end of next month ; and though I am hopeful that , partly in consequence of a representation that I have made to the Government , of the wide scope for usefulness that is open to me here , and of what has been effected and has been engaged upon since my arrival six months ago , they may be induced to extend their approval of the appointment until the improvements suggested in my Report shall have been considered , yet it seems right , as there are some interesting points about the results already arrived at , that I should inform you of them whilst I may , especially as in case of a second reference of the matter to the home Government , you will , I believe , consider them good grounds upon which to recommend the continuance of the reductions of the twenty-one consecutive years of the Bombay observations .
Referring to page 283 of your paper in the Philosophical Transactions , 1863 , it will be seen that these results supply the required knowledge of the laws of the disturbances at a station intermediate in longitude between Kew and Nertschinsk .
The general characteristics of the westerly disturbancediurnal-variation curve are the same as you describe for Pekin and Nertschinsk .
The curve is remarkably regular , and the ordinates between 8 P.M. and 4 A.M. have scarcely appreciable values , being in the latter respect like the westerly curve for Hobarton , and the easterly for Kew and St. Helena .
The maximum occurs at 11 A.M. , which corresponds to about 18 " Kew astronomical time , implying , by comparison with the corresponding hours of maximum at the other two eastern stations ( Pekin and Nertschinsk ) , a rather slow propagation of the disturbing action from north to south of the eastern part of the northern hemisphere .
The other curve ( of easterly disturbance ) presents a less systematic appearance ; and the ratios are at no part of the day smaller than 0'64 , or greater than 1-83 .
The Table of aggregate values of disturbance in the several years points very distinctly to a minimum as occurring early in 1864 , thus adding another to the determinations of this turning-point in three former cycles given by you in the third volume of the ' St. Helena Observations , ' and confirming the conclusions you arrived at as to the propriety of the appellation " decennial " to the period in question .
The Table does not extend far enough backwards to fix the time of maximum distinctly , but it suffices to place it with probability in the year 1859 .
The principal requests that I have made in my Report are for a--set of Kew magnetographs , and for a suitable room , and for a body of computers to work up the old observations .
