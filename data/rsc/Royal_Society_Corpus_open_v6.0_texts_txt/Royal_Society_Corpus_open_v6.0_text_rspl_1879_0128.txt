The exact figure for the chance will of course depend upon the limit of error taken ; but the above example seems sufficient to show that not only is Prout 's law not as yet absolutely overturned , but that a heavy and apparently increasing weight of probability in its favour , or in favour of some modification of it , exists and demands consideration .

171 , Our experiments on the electric discharge , which have been already published in the " Phil. Trans. " and the " Proceedings of the Royal Society , " enable us to state with some degree of probability the height of the Aurora Borealis , when its display is of maximum brilliancy , and also the height at which this phenomenon could not occur on account of the great tenuity of the atmosphere .
In Part III of our electric researches , " Phil. Trans. , ' we have shown that the least resistance to the discharge in hydrogen is at a pressure of 0#642 millim. , 845 M ; after this degree of exhaustion has been reached , a further reduction of pressure rapidly increases the resistance .
When the exhaustion has reached 0'002 millim. , 3 M , the discharge only just passes with a potential of 11,000 chloride of silver cells ( 11,330 volts ) ; at the highest exhaust we have been able to* obtain ( and which we believe has not been surpassed ) , namely , 0*000055 millim. , 0'066 M , not only did 11,000 cells fail to produce a discharge , but even a 1-inch spark from an induction coil could not do so .
Although we have not experimentally determined the pressure of least resistance for air , we have ascertained that while the discharge occurs in hydrogen at atmospheric pressure between disks 0'22 inch distant , they require to be approached to 0T3 inch to allow the discharge to take place in air .
We may therefore assume that the pressure of least resistance for air is 0*642 x 13 :0'379 millim. , 498 6 M. At a height of 37'67 miles above the sea level , the atmosphere would 1880 .

have this pressure ( neglecting change of temperature ) , and therefore the display at this elevation would be of maximum brilliancy and would be visible at a distance of 585 miles .
The greatest exhaust that we have produced , 0'000055 millim. , 0'066 M , corresponds to a height of 81'47 miles , and as 11,000 cells failed to produce a discharge in hydrogen at this low pressure , it may be assumed that at this height the discharge would be considerably less brilliant , especially in air , than that at 37'67 miles , the height of maximum brilliancy .
At a height of 124T5 miles the pressure would be only O'OOOOOOOl millim. , 0*00001 M , and it is scarcely probable that an electric discharge would occur with any potential conceivable at such a height .
The colour of the discharge varies greatly with the tenuity of air or other gas with the same potential .
Thus in air at a pressure of 62 millim. , 81579 M , the discharge has the carmine tint which is so frequently observed in the display of the Aurora ; this corresponds to an altitude 12*4 miles , and would be visible at a distance 336 miles .
At a pressure of T5 millims. , 1974 M , corresponding to a height of 30-86 miles , the discharge becomes salmon coloured , having completely lost the carmine tint .
At a pressure of 0'8 millim. , corresponding to 33*96 miles , the tint of the discharge is of a paler salmon colour , and as the exhaust is carried further it becomes a pale milky white .
The roseate and salmon coloured tints are always in the vicinity of the On the Height of the Aurora Borealis .
[ Apr. 22 positive source of the electric current , the positive luminosity fades away gradually , and frequently becomes almost invisible at some distance from its source ; as , for instance , in the hydrogen discharge at a pressure of 2'3 millims. , 3027 M , shown in the accompanying figure , H , which resembles in some respects the phenomena of the Aurora .
The discharge at the negative terminal in air is always of a violet hue , and this tint in the Aurora indicates a proximity to the negative source .

It is conceivable that the Aurora may occur at times at an altitude of a few thousand feet .
