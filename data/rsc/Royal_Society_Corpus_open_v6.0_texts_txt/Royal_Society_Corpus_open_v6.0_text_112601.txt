In a former communication I have shown that the hydride of heptyl obtained from petroleum has a higher specific gravity than its isomers ethyl-amyl , and hydride of heptyl from azelaic acid .
The same is the case with their derivatives , and some of these isomeric compounds also show considerable differences in their boiling-points * .
I could not compare the different heptyl-compounds which I prepared with those of heptyl-alcohol formed by fermentation , as the latter substance is very little known , and I therefore considered it interesting to compare the amylcompounds from fusel-oil with those obtained from petroleum .
From the latter substance I prepared a considerable quantity of pure hydride of amyl , which boiled constantly at 33 ?

From this hydride other amylcompounds were obtained in exactly the same way as the heptyl-com* Proc. Roy .

Pure amyl-compounds from fusel-oil were also prepared with the greatest care , and their specific gravities and boiling-points compared , under exactly the same circumstances , with the compounds prepared from petroleum .

It appears from this Table that the boiling-points of the same compounds agree perfectly , and that the specific gravities show only very small differences , those of the substances obtained from petroleum being a little higher .
This is easily accounted for by an admixture of higher boiling compounds , which towards the end of the distillation raise the boilingpoints a little , and which cannot be removed completely , even by longcontinued rectifications .
The amyl-compounds from petroleum and those from fusel-oil are therefore identical .
