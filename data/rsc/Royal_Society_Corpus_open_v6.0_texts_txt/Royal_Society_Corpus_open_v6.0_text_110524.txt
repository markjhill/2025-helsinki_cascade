" Welt Meehanik .
" By M. Kropalschek .
The object which the author has in view , in this paper , is to overturn the theory of universal gravitation , as regulating the planetary motions .
The memoir is divided into two parts ; in the first , he disputes the accuracy of Kepler 's law respecting the description of equal areas in equal times , and endeavours to confute the fundamental doctrines of astronomy relating to the elliptical orbit of the earth , the difference between solar and mean time , and the whole theory of the motions of the moon and the planets .
In the second part , the author enters into a detailed exposition of his own views of the mechanism of the heavens ; and devotes 215 closely written pages to the development of a perfectly new hypothesis , which he advances , founded on a supposed variation of the progressive motion of the planets , in an orbit perfectly circular , and by which he thinks he can explain all the phenomena they present to observation .
