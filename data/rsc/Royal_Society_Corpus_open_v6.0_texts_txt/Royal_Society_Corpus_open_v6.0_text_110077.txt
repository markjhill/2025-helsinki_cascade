] After adverting to the difference between the celerity of sound , as deduced by theory and found by experiment ; and to Laplace 's explanation of the cause of that difference , and his corrections of the Newtonian formula , the authors proceed to consider the influence af the variable force of wind upon its velocity , and state their mode of annihilating such cause of error .
They then detail their own experiments , for which they selected two open and elevated spots in the plains of Utrecht , distinctly visible from each other , and distant about 9664 fathoms .
They measured the interval between seeing the light and hearing the sound by clocks with conical pendulums , which divide the 24 hours into 10,000,000 parts , and one of the indexes of which gives one 100th part of a decimal second .
Each station was also furnished with a good barometer , several accurate thermometers and excellent telescopes , and the humidity of the air was determined by Daniell 's hygrometer .
The authors then describe the means which they adopted to insure the simultaneous firing of shots at both stations , and by which they succeeded in bringing them within 1 " or 2 " of each other , and enter at considerable length into the details of their different experiments , the results of which are given in several tables annexed to this paper ; among which will be found one exhibiting a general view of the results of the experiments of those different philosophers who have investigated this subject .
In conclusion , it appears from their researches that at the temperature of 32 ?
, the velocity of sound is 1089-7445 English feet per sexagesimal second .
