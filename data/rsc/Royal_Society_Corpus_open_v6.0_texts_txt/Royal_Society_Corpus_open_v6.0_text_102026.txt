Directions for the use of the following Tid Table , sent by J. F. M. R. &amp; R. S. S. to the Publisher SIR , HAving found my last years Tide Table very agreeable to Experience .
I here present you with another for the year ensuing made by the same Theory and Numbers , but in a more convenient form for your Tracts .
I must only desire those that use it , to note .
That when by reason of long droughts in Summer , or continual hard frosts in Winter , the fresh Waters are low , as also when the winds blow hard at N. or N. W. the Tides may hold up longer than the times showed in the Table .
But when the contrary winds blow hard , or by reason of great rains the Freshes are increased , they hold not out so long : yet have I very rarely found the difference more than half an hour .
I find by enquiry made amongst our most experienced Seamen , that the high Waters of our English and Neighbour Ports keep a good correspondence with these of the River of Thames ; Having therefore instructed my self the best I could by conference with them , I have made the following Table of Reduction , whereby the Tide Table may be made to serve at the places underwritten , by Adding , The Table is Printed in a single half sheet by it self for the use of those that desire to have it alone , and is to be sold by Mr. Baker at the Sign of the Three Pigeons in St. Paul 's Churchyard , London .
