505 A Preliminary Summary of the Results of the Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis in Rats .
By H. G. Plimmer , F.L.S. , and J. D. Thomson , M.B. , C.M. ( Communicated by Sir Ray Lankester , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received July 20 , 1907 .
) The experiments of which the following note is an abstract have been undertaken under the direction of the Tropical Diseases Committee of the Royal Society .
The strains of trypanosomes which have been used in these experiments are a Nagana from the original strain brought to England , and a Surra from Professor Lingard in India .
The Nagana strain kills rats in an average time of 5*5 days , and the Surra strain in 6*9 days .
Chinolin Compounds .
The knowledge of the action of quinine in malaria suggested the trial of various chinolin compounds .
As is well known , quinine itself has no influence in trypanosomiasis .
Cyanin was the substance first tried , as this in extremely dilute solutions ( 1\#151 ; 10,000 ) is very poisonous to trypanosomes outside the body .
A series of Hagana and Surra rats were given doses of from ^ to 1 milligramme ( which is a poisonous dose for small rats ) , but all of these died about the same time as the controls , and in every case the trypanosomes had increased in the usual manner , so that at death the blood was as swarming with trypanosomes as if no treatment had been used .
Messrs. Bayer and Co. , of Elberfeld , kindly placed at our disposal nine chinolin and chinaldin compounds and six " cyanin farbstoffe , " but none of these produced any effect on the development or course of the diseases .
JDichlorobenzidine + Acid H. This substance , which was first used by Nicolle in trypanosomiasis of mice , was found , when used both on mice and rats , to lengthen the course of the diseases , but in no case was the extension of the course of the disease very marked .
Nagana mice , after one dose of 1 c.c. of a 1-per-cent , solution , lived from 8 to 11 days , and Surra mice from 10 to 16 days , one living as long as 29 days ; in Nagana rats the disease was prolonged to an average time of 14 days , and in Surra to an average of 16 days .
In all the animals treated with this substance the spleen and liver were very much enlarged , and living trypanosomes were found post mortem , showing that the substance had not practically influenced the pathological processes .
In no case was the substance completely absorbed .
506 Messrs. H. G. Plimmer and J. D. Thomson .
[ July 20 , Trypanroth .
This was discovered and first used by Ehrlich .
When used alone it lengthened the course of the disease in both Nagana and Surra to about 14 days , but in all cases the spleen was found to be as much enlarged as in the control , and living trypanosomes were invariably found post mortem .
Arsenious Acid .
This was used at first simply dissolved in water , and later , in order to try to avoid the irritation and sloughing invariably produced , in a solution slightly over-neutralised with carbonate of soda .
When injected before the fourth day of Nagana and Surra , arsenious acid caused the disappearance of the trypanosomes from the blood , but they invariably recurred before death .
It was given in doses of 1 milligramme , and one rat lived as long as 26 days , two to 16 days , and one to 17 days , each of these rats having taken 6 milligrammes altogether .
A very considerable effect was produced on the vitality of the trypanosomes , as a rat inoculated from the bone-marrow of one of the 16-day rats did not show trypanosomes in the blood until the ninth day after inoculation .
Whether neutralised or not , sores were produced at the points of injection .
The spleen was found post mortem to be about as large as-that of the controls .
Atoxyl .
This substance , which was first used by Thomas and Breinl , has been found by Ehrlich and Bertheim to be the sodium salt of para-amido-phenyl-arsenic acid , with the formula NHa(C6H4)As0.0Na.0H,3H20 , and Moore , Nierenstein , and Todd* have confirmed this view of its composition , which differs from that originally published , which stated it to be an anilide of metarsenious acid .
This is the most important substance , so far discovered , in relation to the treatment of trypanosomiasis .
In all cases of Nagana and Surra ( with the \#166 ; exception of the atoxyl-proof cases mentioned below ) , atoxyl causes the entire disappearance of the trypanosomes from the blood , so that rats inoculated with the blood when it was microscopically free from parasites failed to take the disease ; but the trypanosomes , in our experience , have invariably recurred , and death was only delayed for a period varying with the dose and with the time of commencement of the treatment .
When the dose was sufficient , e.g. , 1 to 1*5 c.c. of a 5-per-cent , solution in three to five doses * " On the Treatment of Trypanosomiasis by Atoxyl ... .

] Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis in Rats .
507 ( a dose being given every , or every other , day ) , even after as many as four recurrences the spleen was generally found post mortem to be very little or at most moderately enlarged .
A too large dose apparently produced wasting , and a bad condition of the hair , and , we think , a quicker return of the trypanosomes .
When atoxyl is given more continuously or too freely than is required , in cases in which there have been many recurrences , and probably under some other conditions of which we are ignorant , in a certain small proportion of rats so treated a race of trypanosomes is produced which entirely resists atoxyl , and continues to develop and multiply in spite of continued exhibition of the drug .
This strain , when inoculated into fresh rats , retains its resistance to atoxyl .
Ehrlich , who has produced such a strain in mice , calls them " atoxyl-fest , " and we have obtained this atoxyl-proof variety of trypanosome in rats , both in Nagana and Surra , of which mention will be made later .

Monophenylarsenie acid .
2 .
Nitrophenylarsenic acid .
3 .
Paratolylarsenic acid .
These three bodies were sent for experimental purposes to Professor Cushny , F.R.S. , by Professor Michaelis , who discovered them .
They are of interest in connection with the treatment of trypanosomiasis , since atoxyl is an amido derivative of phenylarsenic acid , which was also discovered by Michaelis .
They are extremely poisonous substances , and were given in doses of 1 c.c. of a solution of 1/ 400 .
1 .
Monophenylarsenic acid.\#151 ; This , in common with other arsenic compounds , notably affected the development of the trypanosomes .
In doses of 1 c.c. of 1/ 400 , repeated once or twice in untreated animals , it diminished greatly the number of trypanosomes ; and in three recurrent cases , after initial treatment with atoxyl , it caused the trypanosomes to disappear , but it did not save any animal ; and it is , as are all these three compounds* poisonous in effective doses .
2. .
Nitrophenylarsenic acid.\#151 ; In untreated animals , and in two recurrent cases after atoxyl , this caused a temporary disappearance of the trypanosomes ; in a case of second recurrence after atoxyl , it produced no effect on the trypanosomes .
It is the most poisonous of the three .
3 .
-Paratolylarsenic acid.\#151 ; This caused a more effective disappearance of the trypanosomes than the other two compounds , and it was better borne .
One Nagana rat , treated only with it from the beginning , lived for 25 days , having had , however , three recurrences during this period .
.At each recurrence the trypanosomes disappeared after two doses of 1 e , c. of 1/ 400 .
In recurrent VOL. lxxix , \#151 ; p. 2 0 508 Messrs. H. G. Plimmer and J. D. Thomson .
[ July 20 , cases after atoxyl a temporary disappearance of the trypanosomes was also effected .
Other Arsenic Compounds .
Arrhenal ( di-methyl sodium arseniate ) and sodium cacodylate were also tried , but were found to have no effect whatever on the course of the disease , nor upon the development of the trypanosomes either in first infections or in recurrences .
Other Bodies .
Fluorescein was tried without any effect ; and also sodium cinnamate , on account of its reputed property of producing leucocytosis , which might have been useful from the phagocytic standpoint .
But it failed to have any effect in these diseases . ?
Treatment with two or more Drugs .
The deduction from the above-mentioned experiments with single bodies is that , at the present time , there is no substance known which alone will cause a permanent disappearance of the trypanosomes from the affected animal , i.e. , effect a cure ; so that experiments have been carried out to see whether any combination of bodies would produce the desired effect .
The compounds of mercury seemed from their known properties to be the most promising , and the results of experiments in this direction , lately published by Drs. Moore , Nierenstein , and Todd , are most encouraging .
We have not used the form of mercury ( liq .
hydrarg .
perchlor .
) with which these good results have been obtained , but we have used the lactate , sozoiodol , and succinimide , and also Donovan 's Solution ( liq .
arsen .
et hydrarg .
iodid .
) .
Of these the succinimide appears to us to be the best , as it is unirritating , and will apparently mix with atoxyl without change\#151 ; at any rate it does not interfere with the action of the atoxyl ; the lactate is very irritating , even in doses of one-third of a minim of the ordinary hypodermic solution , and it is not so effective as the succinimide ; the sozoiodol appears to come between these two in point of efficiency .
But in our experience there is a great difference in the individual equation of rats with regard to dosage and poisonous effects , which the consideration of relative weight does not help us to gauge , so that there has been difficulty in ensuring the best method of giving these drugs , and of determining their appropriate quantity .
The duration of the disease has been very greatly prolonged in most cases , and in some we have confidence that a cure has been effected .
Of all the substances tried , atoxyl has had by far the most favourable action , and it is easily tolerated , and produces no irritation .
But , as mentioned before , it has no permanent effect ; it causes th\#163 ; disappearance of the 1907 .

509 trypanosomes from the blood , even when in very large numbers , but there remain behind certain forms of the parasites which can resist it , and which after an interval can reproduce the general infection with the indifferent forms .
These recurrences can take place , in our experience , up to as many as seven times .
The resistant forms appear to be located in the intermediate periods in the bone-marrow , but there is some doubt about this yet , as in some cases we have failed to produce an infection , even with a quantity of the marrow .
It is probable also that some of these resistant forms may be found in the glands , and observations are being carried out on these points .
But when an infection is produced from the marrow of these atoxyl-treated rats , the incubation period is very much prolonged , and it may be as long as nine days before trypanosomes can be found in the blood of the inoculated animals .
Atoxyl appears to act not by virtue of the arsenic in it alone , but its effects are probably due to this in combination with some other of its constituents , as its action is much more rapid and complete than that of any other of the simpler arsenic compounds which we have tried .
The following Tables I and II give the results of treatment with atoxyl and succinimide of mercury : this latter has been given either with the atoxyl or immediately after it , the best method being , we think , to give two or three doses of atoxyl and to give a dose of succinimide of mercury at the same time as the second and third doses , with perhaps one after .
Some of our rats have had too much , and we are now giving less with better effect .
The succinimide has the great advantage of being unirritating to the tissues , and it will mix with atoxyl without precipitation , and without , at any rate , interfering with the action of the latter .

This latter is a solution , or mixture , of iodine in oil of sesame , made by Merck , who kindly placed some at our disposal , and it is stated to be unirritating , and it can be given in large doses with safety .
The results are sufficiently encouraging to suggest a further trial of this combination .
The oil takes a very long time to get absorbed ; it becomes colourless from absorption of the iodine , and appears to cause no irritation in the tissues .

The Production of an Atoxyl-proof Race of Trypanosomes in Rats .
This phenomenon is of great biological and therapeutical interest , and needs much further research yet , both for its explanation , and its bearing on treatment .
In certain rats , after treatment with atoxyl , a number of recurrences may take place\#151 ; we have seen as many as seven ; these recurrences at first yield to treatment with atoxyl , but as the case progresses towards its end , the recurrences occur at shorter and shorter intervals , until one comes to a time when they can be no longer affected by atoxyl .
The trypanosomes in this case have become atoxyl-proof .
Ehrlich succeeded in producing an atoxyl-proof strain of Nagana in mice , and we have succeeded in producing atoxyl-proof strains of both Nagana and Surra in rats .
One point of importance biologically is that these atoxyl-proof trypanosomes do not lose their resistance to atoxyl on transference into other rats , and we have carried this strain on in Nagana through a series of eight successive rat3 , and in Surra through a series of six rats without any loss of their atoxyl-proof properties .
When treated with atoxyl , even in large doses , multiplication goes on just as rapidly as in untreated animals , and the rats die at the usual time .
Our cases have been given atoxyl to test them , and have been then treated with various substances , as set forth in the table below .
Of these substances , 1907 .
] Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis in Rats .
515 trypanroth and some form of mercury have given the best results .
In thinking of human trypanosomiasis in this connection , the danger of the production of an atoxyl-proof strain will be at once apparent : so that atoxyl should be given to human beings with the greatest care and forethought .
The following Table VII summarises the few results we have obtained so far .
Rat No. 1 was inoculated from a Nagana rat which had become uninfluenced by atoxyl after the third recurrence , before which large and repeated doses had been given : and Rat No. 11 was inoculated from a Surra rat in a similar condition .
