) ( Received May 5 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1914 .
) Introduction .
The following experiments were undertaken to find out whether the Naturally Infected Dog strain of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland would protect against the other strains .
These different strains have been described in previous papers as the " Human , " the " Wild Game , " the " Wild Glossina morsitans , " " Zululand , 1913 , " etc. , and here they will be known by the same names .
" Human " will therefore mean a strain of this species of trypanosome coming from man , " Wild morsitans " from a tsetse tly , and so on .
These immunity experiments were necessarily one-sided , as it wras , with three exceptions , only animals which had recovered from the weaker Naturally Infected Dog strain which were available .
There are practically no recoveries from the Human and other strains .
One goat apparently recovered from the Mzimba strain , and a goat , monkey and dog from the Wild G. morsitans strains , and are included .
There are , therefore , no completed cross-inoculation experiments\#151 ; or at least only one unsatisfactory one , Experiment 17\#151 ; as would have been carried out if material had been forthcoming .
It will be seen from the following experiments that the Naturally Infected Dog strain failed to immunise animals against the Human , Wild and Zululand , 1913 , strains ; but it is not known whether these strains , on the other hand , would have immunised animals against the Naturally Infected Dog strain or not:\#151 ; Sir D. Bruce and others .

Conclusions .
1 .
The Naturally Infected Dog strain does not protect animals from the Human , Wild G. morsitans , and Zululand , 1913 , strains .
2 .
The Wild G.morsitans strain and the Naturally Infected Dog strain do not protect animals from the Human or the Zululand , 1913 , strain .
3 .
The Wild G. morsitans strain does not protect against the Human strain .
4 .
In spite of the damaging evidence of these experiments , the Commission still holds the opinion that the Naturally Infected Dog strain is a weak strain of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland , T. brucei vet rhodesiense .
