A paper was read , entitled , " Appendix to a Memoir , lately read to the Society , on the Quality and Quantity of the Gases disengaged from the Hot Spring of the King 's Bath , in the City of Bath .
" Bv Charles G. B. Daubeny , M.D. , F.R.S. The author has lately examined two tepid springs , which , since the setting in of the wet weather , have broken out at the foot of St. Vincent 's rocks , Clifton , immediately below the Cliff , against which the suspension bridge over the Avon is designed to abut .
The temperatures of the springs were 72 ?
and 66 ?
respectively ; and the gas consisted of 92 parts of nitrogen , eight of oxygen , and three of car ?
bonic acid .
The author deduces from these facts arguments in confirmation of the views he has stated in the paper to which this is an appendix .
Mr. Faraday 's Sixth Series of Experimental Researches in Elec ?
tricity were resumed and concluded ; and the reading of the Seventh Series commenced .
