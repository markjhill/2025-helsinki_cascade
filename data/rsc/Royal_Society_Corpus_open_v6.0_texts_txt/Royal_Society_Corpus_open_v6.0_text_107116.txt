i , sin. x ; but nothing is gained by this ; since , in order to find the arc of a circle , x ' ( 1 --x~)is expanded , and the integrals of the several parts taken and added together .
To show ( if it is necessary to add any thing more on so clear a point ) thatfx { 1 -xa } arc circle , is merely a mode of expression borrowed from geometry ; suppose the investigation of the properties of motion to have been prior to the investigation of the properties of extension , for , that the science of geometry was first invented is properly an accidental circumstance , then , such an expression as fx { 1--x ' }i might have occurred , and its value must have been exhibited as it really is now , that is , by expanding it , and integrating the several terms .
IV .
It is an objection certainly against these modes of expression , that they are foreign , and tend to produce confused and erroneous notions ; for the student may be led by them to believe , that the determination of the values of certain analytical expressions , essentially require the existence of certain curves , and the investigation of their properties .
But there is a more valid objection against them , which is , that they divert the mind from the true derivation of such expressions as - , x ' ( 1- ) &amp;c. and consequently tend to produce ambiguity and indirect methods ; for although , in order to obtain approximately the numerical value off - , fx ( 1 -z4)- .
, &amp;c. it is convenient to expand the expressions , and to take the integrals of the resulting terms , yet , if the symbolf denotes a reverse operation , f- , fx ( i--xe)-i are not properly and by strict inference equal to ( X-1)--i { x-i- ) +-3 { x -1 )3- , &amp;c. and x+ " + 3+ , &amp;c. But , in order to explain clearly what I mean , it is 5.8 CII NN Mr. WOODHOUSE on the Independence of the necessary to state what I understand by the integral or fluent of an expression .
V. Let pjx denote a function of x ; if x be increased by o , then qpx becomes p ( x + o ) , and qp ( x + o ) , developed according QR to the powers of o , becomes x+ Po + --o + " r3 0o &amp;c. where P is derived from px , Q from P , R from Q , &amp;c. by the same law ; so that the manner of deriving P being known , Q , R , &amp;c. are known .
The entire difference or increment of cpx is p ( xzo ) px ; the differential or fluxion of &lt; qx is only a part of the difference or P.o. If , instead of o , dx , or xz , be put , it is P.dx or Px ' ; the integral or fluent of Pxis that function from which Px ' is derived ; and , in order to remount to it , we must observe the manner or the operation by which it was deduced ; and , by reversing such operation , the integral or fluent is obtained .
Now , in taking the fluxion of certain functions of x , it appears there are conditions to which the indices of x without and under the vinculum are subject : hence , whether or not a proposed fluxion can have its fluent assigned , we must see if the fluxion has the necessary conditions .
Expressions such as - , -X &amp;c. have not X I1+X VI -x2z these conditions ; and consequently there is no function zpx of x , such that the second term of the developement of q ( x +x ) is equal either to 'or , or or -- , or , &amp;c. There are , however , integral equations from which such expressions may be derived .
Thus , let x= " , then -= z , let i+ x=.+ .
~+ x I+x z , let x1^ == %- , let ~x : = ' ?
-lC-----'z x ' Now , from these equations , the differential equations -xs z,.* .
, &amp;c. may , by expunging the exponential I-XI .
X 9O quantities , be derived ; consequently , if the symbol f is to designate a reverse operation , I can only know what that reverse operation is , by attending to the manner by which the expres sions affected with the symbolf were derived .
Hence , VI .

All other methods of assigning the integrals , by the properties of logarithms , by circular arcs , by logarithmic and hyperbolic curves , * are indirect , foreign , and ambiguous .

An instance or two will show the advantage of adhering to the true and natural derivation of analytical expressions .
Let x and y be the co-ordinates of a circle ; then , i-'+y , and y-/ ( 1 --x ) , now ( arc)* or z -=/ ( x^ -y ) - , in this instance , x ' ( i--x2)-- : but it has appeared , that ifx =2V { z1 --E } , Z'= ( I x ) ; consequently , in a circle , the co-ordinate x , or , in the language of trigonometry , the sine x= developement of .

In the irreducible case of cubic equations , the root , it is said , may be exhibited by means of certain lines drawn in a circle .
There is , however , independently of all geometrical considerations , a method of analytically expressing the root ; and , from the analytical expression , although it is not the formula which from the time of CARDAN mathematicians have been seeking , the value of the root may in all cases be arithmetically computed ; but , previously , it is necessary to show what are the different symbols that may be substituted for z in the equations , x= ( 2 _/ v 1){EzZ .

If practical commodiousness , however , be aimed at , it is convenient to give a different expression to the values of the roots , or to translate them into geometrical language : and this , because tables have been calculated , exhibiting the numerical values of the cosines , &amp;c. of circular arcs .

cos. -3 33333 XII , In the fifth volume of his Opuscules , + D'ALEMBERT mentions it as a remarkable paradox , that the series for the arc in terms of the sine represents only one arc , viz. the arc less than 90 degrees ; whereas the series for the sine , produced by reversion from the former series , exhibits all possible arcs that have the same sine .
I shall endeavour to solve this paradox , which , I think , originated partly from the introduction of geometrical considerations into an analytical investigation , by which the true derivation of certain expressions was concealed .
It has appeared that the equation x=(V/ )1 { 1 e~ -zV- } is true , when instead of z is put , O+z , or 2oZ- , ... .
or nO-z , 0r ~ ~S~ , QX"30 2n +l l x+ or 0z , or.3..z. .

Suppose now it is necessary to deduce z , z , z " , &amp;c. in terms of x and its powers , by reversion of series .
What does the reversion of series mean ?
Merely this ; a certain method or operation , according to which , one quantity being expressed in terms of another , the second may be expressed in terms of the first .
Hence , in all similar series , the operation must be the same ; consequently , the result , which is merely the exhibition of a formula , must be the same ; so that , whatever is the series in terms of x , produced by reversion in x -.-Z 33 +sz &amp;c. the same must be produced 1-2 3 1.2.3.4.S by reversion in x= z'+ &lt; ' i - &amp;c. in .
3 34-5 &amp;c. iIn x == .
2+ &amp; C. &amp;c. The series produced by reversion in these cases is , x. 4*+ 3.2 5-8 + ' &amp;c. Hence it appears , that weknow , a priori , that must happen which D'ALEMBERT considers as a paradox to have happened .
Why this paradox found reception in the mind of this acute mathematician , I have stated , as my opinion , one cause to have been , an inattention , from geometrical considerations , to the real origin and derivation of certain expressions that appeared in the course of the calculation .
Another cause I apprehlend was , the want of precise notions on the force and signification of the symbol = .
It is true that its signification entirely depends on definition ; but , if the definition given of it in elementary treatises be adhered to , I believe it will be impossible to show the justness and legitimacy of most mathematical processes .
It scarcely ever denotes numerical equality .
In its general and extended meaning , * it denotes the result of certain operations .
Thus , when from z3 zsf z3 X -+45 X2 + &amp;c. 7wj.2.3 I*1.2.3.4.5 1.2.3 z or z is inferred x+3+ &amp;c. nothing is affirmed concerning a numerical equality ; and all that is to be understood is , that x+ 3-7 + 3j + &amp;c. is the result of a certain 'tood *s , th 3.2 '5 i.8 z3 2z operation performed on x -Z 7z23 +.-- ' , '3'.4 .
1 &amp; C XIII .
It appears then , that according to the reversion of series , z , z ' , , &amp;c. m.ust all be represented by the same series , proceeding according ; to the powers of x ; but , if a form for z be required , which slhall in all cases afford us a means of numerically computing its value , such a form must involve certain arbitrary quantities .
These arbitrary quantities are to be determined by conditions which depend either on the original form of the equation between x and z , or on the nature of the object to which the calculus is applied .
Let now . ?

This is consistent with what I advanced in the Phil. Trans. for r8oi ' p. 99 , concerning the meaning of the symbols X + , &amp;c. It is beside my present purpose , to insist farther on the necessity of attaching precise notions to the symbols employed in calculation ; and the subject deserves a separate and ample discussion .
X. then , if z represent the arc of a circle , and x the sine , this equality* z= -x + - ?
+ -3 " + &amp;c. is subject to restrictions , 3.2 5.8 for x cannot exceed 1 ; consequently , the greatest value of z that can be determined from the equation , must be so determined by putting x= i. Let7r == 1 ++ .

there is no possible value of z that answers the equation when X is 7 1 , Letf j-- .

( 2n+ ) ir- , x3 3xS In the expression z=-x+ z -+ +8 &amp;c. considered abstractedly from its oi3.2 s.8 gin and application , there is nothing that limits the value of x. Again , by applying z3 the operation of reversion , x is represented by this form , z+ &amp;c. 1.2.3 1.2.3.4.5 But there is no method , I believe , of proving ( I purposely exclude that unproved proposition that every equation has as many roots as dimensions ) that instead of z in 3 -4 .

That analytical science was advanced by the discovery of this theorem , is indeed true ; but the circle and its lines were no farther useful or necessary , than as they afforded a mode of expressing , in geometrical language , an analytical truth .
What is analytically expressed , may be analytically combined and resolved ; and , if COTES , by the properties of figures , has expressed his discovery , it is because the mathematicians of the time in which he lived , were more skilful and dexterous with the geometrical method than with the analytical .
In order to demonstrate COTES'S property of the circle , considered as such , one of two different methods must be pursued .
Either let the demonstration be strictly geometrical , according to the method of the ancients , or as completely analytical as possible ; that is , let the demonstration be effected by the analytical method , from as few fundamental principles as possible .
I know not on what grounds of perspicuity and rigour , the propriety of a demonstration half geometrical , half algebraical , can be established ; for , besides the want of symmetry in such a demonstration , in strictness of reasoning , a separate discussion is necessary , to show the propriety and justness of the application of analysis to certain properties of extension demonstrated geometrically .
It is beside my present purpose , to inquire whether COTES'S theorem can be demonstrated strictly after the method of the ancients : hitherto it has not been so demonstrated .
To demonstrate it analytically , in the most simple and direct manner , we must proceed from as few fundamental principles as possible ; and give to the quantities concerned , their true and natural * For the analytical demonstration , all that is necessary to be known , is what is proved in the 47th of the Elements .

I think , therefore , the analytical demonstration in which the symbol V/ is introduced , ( for the cosine of an arc cannot be adequately and abridgedly represented in terms of the arc , except by means of the symbol -- , ) to be the most simple and direct that can be exhibited .
I have endeavoured , in a former paper , to show that demonstration with such symbols as V/ 1 may be strict and rigorous .

arc ; for , chord nz = v/ } 2 'XXII , In the above demonstrations , no formulas are borrowed from geometry ; and the general law of the coefficients is clearly expressed ; it is , I think , most conveniently expressed by means of the symbol or note of derivation D. The operation which this symbol indicates is as certain as any other operation , whether arithmetical or algebraical .
XXIII .
The demonstrations and method of deduction given in this paper show , I think , with sufficient evidence , the introduction of geometrical expressions and formulas into analytical investigation to be perfectly unnecessary .
It has appeared likewise , that such introduction embarrasses investigation , and causes ambiguity , by concealing the true derivation of expressions ; and , although I do not wish to give importance to my own observations , by supposing a greater confusion of notion to exist than really does , yet , I think , in what has been written and said , there may be detected a lurking opinion , that the value of certain expressions essentially demand the existence of geometrical curves and figures , and the investigation of their properties .
XXIV .
In the Appendix to the Arithmetica Universalis , p. 200 .

&amp;c. NEWTON , with great clearness and force of argument , has shown the distinction to be made between the order of classing curves , analytically considered , that is , defined but the demonstration of the latter theorem is not , it appears to me , to be reckoned in the number of strict demonstrations .
The only objection against the demonstration of the very learned and ingenious author of the Calcul des Derivations , is , that it is rather indirect , and blended with geometrical expressions and formulas .
by equations , and the order of classing them , considered ' as generated by description .
Moreover , he animadverts on the custom of confounding the two sciences of algebra and geometry ; * and , if any authority is attached to his assertion , that the two sciences ought not to be confounded together , the separation of geometry from algebra will thereby be equally urged as the separation of algebra from geometry .
And it cannot be said with greater truth , that the simplicity of geometry is vitiated with algebraic equations , than that the simplicity of analysis is vitiated with geometrical forms and expressions .
In fact , each science ought to be kept distinct ; and be made to derive its ricles from its proper sources .
XXV .
It will not demand much meditation to be assured of this truth , that , in any mathematical investigation , the geometrical method , properly so called , is not essentially or absolutely necessary .
The properties of extension and figure , to which this method has been especially appropriated , may be analytically treated ; and here it is proper to state a distinction necessary to be made , between what may be called analytical geo-metry , and the application of analysis to geometry .
The ' first does not suppose or require the:existence of such a method as the geometrical ; but , from a few fundamental principles , analy .
tically investigates the properties of extension ; whereas , in the latter , analysis is applied to propositions already ; established by the geometrical method : so that , strictly , to show the justness and propriety of the application , a separate investigation is necessary .
We find , however , in general , a vague analogy substituted , as a connecting principle between the two methods .
XXVI .
The application of algebra to geometry , gives to DESCARTES the fairest title to fame for mathematical invention ; yet the cause and nature of the benefit conferred on science by that application , seems to be indistinctly apprehended.* For , the Analytical Calculus , when applied to geometry , was not enriched with the truths of the latter science , because some connecting principle had been discovered , or some process invented by which the property of the two methods became common , and might , from one to the other , without formality be transferred ; but because the investigation of certain properties could not proceed , without first improving the means by which they were to be investigated .
These means DESCARTES improved : he found , when certain conditions in problems concerning extension were translated into the language of algebra , that the process of deduction with the general terms was slow and incommodious , because , such was the low state of the algebraic Calculus , the relation between the general terms had not been established .
The aim and merit of DESCARTEs 's speculations is to have established this relation .
If illustration were needed to make my meaning clear , I should say that DESCARTES , NEWTON , and D'ALEMBERT , benefited science precisely after the same manner .
The first applied the analytical Calculus to extension ; the second to motion ; the third to the equilibrium , resistance , &amp;c. of fluids .
As the object of investigation became more abstruse , it was found necessary to improve more and more the means or instrument of investigation .
XXVII .
As the question concerning the respective advantages of the ancient geometry and modern analysis , is not foreign to the subject of this Paper , I shall briefly state it , and endeavour to afford the means of arriving therein at something like a precise determination .
The superiority of one method above another , must consist in being either more logically strict in its deductions , or more luminous , or more commodious .
for investigation .
The discussion concerning the strictness and accuracy may , I conceive , be immediately put aside , since no method of deduction is essentially inaccurate ; and , if in geometry the inferences are more strictly deduced than in the algebraic Calculus , the advantage is to be reckoned an accidental one , and arising from the great attention with which the former science has been cultivated .
One method may , however , be essentially more perspicuous and more commodious for investigation than another ; or , in rother words , the perspicuity and commodiousness of a method ?
may depend on circumstances inherent in its nature and plan .
Now , a person not sensible of the superior perspicuity of the geometrical method , would demand these circumstances , the necessary causes of perspicuity , to be pointed out to him ; which might be done , by stating that geometry , instead of a generic term , employs , as a particular individual , the sign or representative of a genus ; and that , as in algebra , the signs are altogether arbitrary , in geometry , they bear a resemblance to the , things signified , and are called natural signs , since the figure of a triangle , or square , suggests to the mind the same tangible figure in Europe , that it does in America : and this resemblance .
of the sign to the thing signified , is supposed to be the chief cause of the superior clearness of geometrical demonstration.* Another cause may perhaps be thought to exist in this circumstance , that whatever is demonstrated , of a triangle or other diagram , considered as the representative of all triangles and diagrams , is moreover demonstrated of that individual triangle or diagram .
A third , and more satisfactory cause than the last , may be , that in investigation , for the purpose of preventing ambiguity and mistake , it is frequently necessary to recur from the sign to the thing signified ; which is more easily done , the less general and arbitrary the modes of representation are ; and , consequently , in geometry more easily than in algebra .
I do not pretend to have assigned , accurately , and all , the causes of perspicuity of geometrical reasoning .
It may depend on certain intellectual acts and processes , which it is beyond the power of philosophy to explain .
The circumstance , however , of the signs employed in geometry being natural signs , will prove its perspicuity only to a certain extent , and in certain cases .
It must fail to prove it , when the properties of solids are treated geometrically ; because the representation of solids on a plane by diagrams , is not a natural representation , that is , would not suggest to all minds the same tangible portion of extension .
It must fail likewise to prove it , in questions concerning radii of curvature , areas of curves , &amp;c. or in all questions in which the fluxionary or differential Calculus is usually employed .
The lines and mixtilinear triangles therein exhibited cannot be called natural signs , since they are only imperfect and inadequate representations of other imaginary lines and triangles , of which the mind must form what notion it can .
Not , however , to infer want of perspicuity from inefficiency in the cause assigned , if we employ the geometrical method , or view its employment in investigation , concerning motion , curves , &amp;c. it will not appear a perspicuous method ; and , if instances of its obscurity were required of me , I could find them , even in the immortal work of the Principia .
Whether we consider the fact , or speculate about the cause , I think the geometrical method can only be allowed to have superior evidence in investigations of a simple nature .
That the analytical calculus is more commodious for the deduction of truth than the geometrical , will not perhaps be contested ; and , an examination into its nature , would show why it is so well adapted for easy combination and extensive generalization .
No language like the language of analysis , one of the greatest of modern mathematicians has observed , is capable of such elegance as flows from the developement of a long series of expressions connected one with the other , and all dependent on the same fundamental idea .
If we view what has been respectively done by each method , in the explanation of natural phenomena , the superiority of the one above the other will appear immense : yet the cultivators of geometry were men of consummate abilities , and possessed this great advantage , that the method or instrument of thought and reasoning which they employed had , during preceding times , received the greatest improvement .
The analytical calculus , which has verified the principle of gravitation , was a hundred years ago in its infancy .
The question , then , concerning the respective advantages of the ancient geometry and modern analysis , may be comprised within a short compass .
If mental discipline and recreation are sought for , they may be found in both methods ; neither is essentially inaccurate ; and , although in simple inquiries the geometrical has greater evidence , in abstruse and intricate investigation the analytical is most luminous : but , if the expeditious deduction of truth is the object , then I conceive the analytical calculus ought to be preferred .
To arrive at a certain end , we should surely use the simplest means ; and there is , I think , little to praise or emulate , in the labours of those who resolutely seek truth through the most difficult paths , who love what is arduous because it is arduous , and in subjects naturally difficult toil with instruments the most incommodious .
XXVIII .
If in matters of abstract science deference is ever due to-authority , it must be paid to that by which the study and use of the method of the ancients has been recommended .
NEWTON has , however , brought forward no precise arguments in favour of synthesis ; and it is easy to conceive , that he would be naturally attached to a method long known and familiar to him , * and by means of which he was enabled to connect his own theory of curvilinear motions , with the researches of the ancients on conic sections , and with HUYGENS ' discoveries relative to central forces and the evolutes of curves .
The very ingenious and learned MATTHEW STEWART endeaa The circumstance of mathematicians having acquired a considerable dexterity in the management of the geometrical method , seems to be the reason why they endea .
voured to explain the doctrine of logarithms ( a subject purely algebraical ) by the introduction of the properties of curvwst Words are frequently stated in a delusive and imposing manner , not always 12X voured to show , that the geometrical calculus was competent to the explanation of natural phenomena ; and with astonishing perseverance-applied it to many investigations in physical astro nomy .
The labours of such a man are not hastily to be judged : yet every one must determine for himself ; and to me it seems , his reasonings , from their intricacy , call up so great a contention of the mind , that they prove , in no small degree , the unfitness of the geometrical method in all abstruse and intricate investigations .
XXIX .
It may , however , be asked , are not there some subjects of inquiry to which the geometrical method is better adapted than the analytical ?
and is not the theory of angular functions one of these subjects ?
* I apprehend not : for , if the conditions intentionally .
Dr. STEWART , ( Preface to Sun 's Distance , ) and after him his ingenious biographer , for the purpose of holding up the superior simplicity of the geometrical calculus , has said , that in order to understand his solution , a knowledge of the elements and conic sections only is requisite But , in fact , the solution is effected by proposition heaped on proposition ; and with equal truth and justness it might be said , that in order to understand the analytical solution , a knowledge only of common algebra is requisite ; since the methods by which the solution is effected , are really and properly branches of algebra .
can be adequately and unambiguously stated in the general terms of algebra , then deduction with such terms may be strictly made , and expeditiously ; since it is to be made according to a known and established process .
I have shown at some length , that reasoning may be conducted with terms which separately cannot be arithmetically computed : for the mere process of deduction , it is not necessary to have distinct and complete notions of the things signified by the general terms .
The principal object of the present paper is to show , that the analytical calculus needs no aid from geometry , and ought to reject it , relying entirely on its own proper resources .
By this means , it would gain perspicuity , precision , and conciseness ; advantages not to be lightly estimated , by any one who has a regard to certainty and demonstration , or considers the bulk to which scientific treatises have of late years swelled .
In order to prove and illustrate the opinion I wished to establish , I directed my search to those cases which have been always thought to require the aid of the geometrical method .
By a purely analytical process , I have traced the origin and derivation of certain fluxionary expressions , usually referred to logarithms and circular arcs .
I have given demonstrations of the series for the sine of an arc in terms of the arc ; of the analytical formula for the root of a cubic equation in the irreducible case ; of the resolution of xn an into quadratic factors ; of the series for the chord , &amp;c. of a multiple arc in terms of the simple arc , &amp;c. which demonstrations , with as much confilearning half a series of truths by one method , and half by another .
These considera.tions , however , depreciate the value of the geometrical method ojlly in one point of view ; for , after all , the finest exemplar of clear and accurate reasoning is contained in the works of EU cLI D. 1 !
24 dence as I dare assume , knowing how fallaciously we judge of our own performances , I affirm to be strict and direct ; established without artifices , and without foreign aid drawn from geometrical theorems and the properties of curves .
In some parts of this paper , , the subjects , for their importance , may be thought to be too slightly discussed ; the fear of appearing prolix , has perhaps driven me into brevity and obscurity .
In other parts , what I have advanced may be remote from common apprehension , or contrary to received opinion : but here ?
I make no apology ; for , what I have written , has been written .
only after long meditation , and from no love of singularityi " If I cannot add to truth , " I do not desire distinctionlfrom " , the " heresies of paradox .
" V. On the Independence of the analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation ; and on the Advantages to be derived from their Separation .
By Robert Woodhouse , A. M. Fellow of Caius College , Cambridge .
Communicated by Joseph Planta , Esq. Sec. R. S. Read January 14 , i8o0 .
ONE of the objects of the paper which last year I had the honour of presenting to the Royal Society , was to show the insufficiency in mathematical reason3ng , of a principle of analogy , by which the properties demonstrated for one figure were to be transferred to another , to which the former was supposed to bear a resemblance ; and the argument for the insufficiency of the principle was this , that the analogy between the two figures was neither antecedent to calculation , nor independent of it , and consequently could not regulate it ; that analogy was the object of investigation , not the guide ; the result of demonstration , not its directing principle .
Having shown that analogy could not establish the truth of certain mathematical conclusions , I next endeavoured to show why such conclusions had been rightly inferred ; not by proposing any new excogitated principle , nor by pointing out an hitherto unobserved intellectual process ; but I conceived they might be obtained by operations conducted in a manner similar to that by which all reasoning with general terms is conducted , C 85 j and that the relations between the symbols or general terms were to be established by giving the true meaning to the connecting signs , which indicate not so much the arithmetical computation of quantities , as certain algebraical operations .
It was further observed , that , from certain established formulas , abridged symbols or general terms might be formed , which consequently must have their signification dependent on such formulas ; and that , although the parts of certain abridged expressions could not separately be arithmetically computed , yet the expressions themselves might be legitimately employed in all algebraic operations .
The chief object of my paper was to show , that operations with imaginary quantities , as they are called , were strictly and logically conducted , that is , conducted after the same manner as operations with quantities that can be arithmetically computed : the question , whether calculation with imaginary symbols is commodious or not , was then slightly discussed .
I have since attentively considered it , and , what usually happens in such cases , my inquiries have been extended beyond their original object ; for , actual research has convinced me of what there were antecedent reasons for suspecting , that not only in the tleory of angular functions , demonstration is most easy and direct by giving to quantities their true and natural* representation ; but , that the introduction of expressions and formulas not analytical , into analytical investigation , has caused much ambiguity , confused notion , and paradox ; that it has made ( - ) + ( - ) V } &amp;c. I call the natural representations of the cosines , sines , &amp;c. of an arc x ; because , admitting the algebraical notation , they , by strict inference , adequately , unambiguously , and solely , represent the cosines , sines , &amp;c. 86 demonstration prolix , by rendering it less direct , and has made it deficient in precision and exactness , by diverting the mind from the true source and derivation of analytical expression .
The expressions and formulas alluded to are geometrical , that is , taken from the language of geometry , and established by its rules : they are to be found mixed with analytical* expressions and reasonings , in all works on abstract science ; and , as they are certainly foreign and circumlocutory , if it can be shown that they are not essentially necessary , there will exist an argument for their exclusion , especially if it appears that in analytical investigation they are productive of the evils above mentioned .
That , in algebraical calculation , geometrical expressions and formulas are not essentially necessary , perhaps this short and easy consideration may convince us ; since algebra is an universal language , it ought surely to be competent to express the conditions belonging to any subject of inquiry ; and , if adequate expressions be obtained , then there is no doubt that with such , reasoning or deduction may be carried on .
All expressions and formulas , such as , sin. x , cos. x , hyp .
log .
x , sin. nx=2 cos. x. sin. ( n ) x --sin .
( n -8 ) x , fx ' ( I -X )i = circular arc , fx ' 13 = elliptical arc , &amp;c. are geometrical , or involve geometrical language : they suppose the existence of a particular system of signs , and method of deduction ; and relate to certain theorems , established conformably to such system and method .
I. Sin. X , cos. X , tang .
x , &amp;c. These expressions are borrowed from geometry ; but , analytically , denote certain functions of x. Typographically considered , these expressions are more commodious than ( v2 1 )e/ -'--XV1 } , ( 2)-1 { XV-i _ -X~ } , &amp;c. but this is the sole advantage ; for , all anal tical operations with these latter signs are much easier , and more expeditious , than with the former ; since , they are carried on after a manner analogous to that by which operations with similar expressions are .
But , if the geometrical expressions be retained , then , in order to calculate with them , recourse must be had to the geometrical method , proceeding by the similarity of triangles , the doctrines of proportions , and of prime and ultimate ratios ; so that , in the same investigation , two methods of deduction , between which there is no similarity , must be employed .
II .
The value offx ( 1 4+ )1 , is said to be a portion of the area of an hyperbola intercepted between two ordinates to its assymptotes ; but this isa foreign and circumlocutory mode of expression ; since , to find the value of the area , x. ( i + x)-1 must be expanded , and the intgrals of the several terms taken ; and this same operation must have taken place , in order to approximate to the value offx ( i + x)-l , if no such curve as the hyperbola had ever been invented .
