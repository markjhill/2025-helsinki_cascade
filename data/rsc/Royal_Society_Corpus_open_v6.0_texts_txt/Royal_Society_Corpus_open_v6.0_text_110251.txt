spheric Electricity .
" By Alexander Barry , Esq. F.L.S. Communicated by J. G. Children , Esq. Sec. R.S. A kite was raised in an atmosphere which appeared favourable to the exhibition of electrical phenomena , from an apparatus firmly fixed in the earth , and insulated by a glass pillar .
The string to which it was affixed contained a double gilt thread , and was let out to a length of five hundred yards .
It was connected with a platina tube passing about half way down a glass tube full of a solution of sulphate of soda , coloured with syrup of violets , and inverted in a cup containing the same liquid .
A similar wire in another tube , also filled with the coloured solution , was placed in communication with the earth , and the fluids in each made to communicate by a bent glass tube passing from one cup to the other .
The result of the experiment was , that hydrogen gas and alkali were developed in the first tube , and oxygen gas and acid in the latter .
