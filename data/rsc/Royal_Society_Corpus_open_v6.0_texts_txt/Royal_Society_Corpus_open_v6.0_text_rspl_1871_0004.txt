With a view to brevity , however , and to the avoidance of putting forward speculations perhaps partly rash , though , I think , not devoid of real significance , I shall not at present enter on details of these considerations , but shall leave them with merely the slight suggestion now offered , and with the suggestion mentioned in an earlier part of the present paper , of the question whether in an extremely thin lamina of gradual transition from a liquid to its own gas , at their visible face of demarcation , conditions may not exist in A stable state having a correspondence with the unstable conditions here theoretically conceived .

, Action of Hydriodic Acid on Codeia in presence of Phosphorus .
In Parts I. and II .
of these researches the action of hydrobromic acid on codeia and its derivatives has been partially investigated ; and as the action of this acid appears to be in some respects similar to , but in others different from , that of hydrochloric acid , it appeared to be of interest to examine the action of hydriodic acid also .
Some preliminary experiments on this subject made two or three years ago in conjunction with the late Dr. A. Matthiessen , showed that when codeia is boiled with a large excess of strong hydriodic acid , no appreciable quantity of methyl iodide is evolved even after some hours treatment ; a brown tarry mass containing much free iodine was produced , but at the time nothing fit for analysis was obtained from this ; since then , Dr. Matthiessen and Mr. Burnside* have corroborated the non-formation of methyl iodide under these circumstances .
If , however , phosphorus be added simultaneously with the hydriodic acid , so as to prevent the accumulation of free iodine , methyl iodide is evolved at 100 ' and upwards in quantity close upon that required for the equation Codeia .

hydric sulphide on iodine and water : in the dilute acid thus got , iodine was dissolved , and the whole digested at a very gentle heat with phosphorus , more iodine solution being added from time to time ; finally the whole was distilled several times from potassium iodide .
A colourless acid of sp. gr. 1*7-1-75 , and containing 50\#151 ; 55 per cent , of HI , was thus obtained , and preserved colourless by keeping a stick of phosphorus in the bottle .
The codeia used in these experiments was part of a further supply most liberally presented by Messrs. Macfarlane , of Edinburgh .
On heating on the water-bath a mixture of 10 parts codeia , 30 to 50 of this acid , and 1 of phosphorus , the evolution of methyl iodide is noticed in a few minutes j simultaneously the liquid becomes brown , indicating the separation of free iodine ; after two or three hours the brown colour disappears , and the evolution of methyl iodide ceases .
If the liquid be heated to gentle ebullition , at first the same effects ensue , but more quickly ; the resulting product , however , varies in composition according to the temperature at which the reaction was effected .
In one experiment 55 grammes of codeia yielded hy condensation 22*5 grammes of methyl iodide , the theoretical yield being 24*6 from crystallized codeia , C18 H21N03 , H20 ; hence upwards of 90 per cent , of the theoretical yield was obtained .
In order to prove the elimination of part of the carbon in the form of methyl iodide , 4*3045 grammes of codeia , dried at 140'-150 ' C. , was heated to gentle ebullition with 30 grammes of 55 per cent , hydriodic acid and about 2 of phosphorus ; the vapours evolved were passed through a flask to condense aqueous vapour , and then through a combustion-tube filled with red-hot lead chromate , the COa produced being absorbed in the usual way , an aspirator being attached at the far end so as to create a diminished pressure throughout the apparatus , and thus guard against loss of methyl-iodide vapour by leakage at any of the numerous corks and joints* .
After three hours a current of pure oxygen was led through the apparatus , to sweep out the last traces of methyl-iodide vapour from the flasks and ensure the perfect combustion of deposited carbonaceous particles .
4*3045 grms. codeia thus gave 0*617 grm. C02 .
0*3720 grm. codeia , burnt in the usual way , gave 0*9830 COa .

If the reaction with hydriodic acid takes place on the water-bath , the ] resulting product appears to have the composition C68 H8612 N4 012 , 4HI ; 1 but if the mixture be heated to gentle ebullition throughout , the tempera- | ture not being allowed to exceed 110'-115 ' from loss of aqueous fluid by j evaporation , the substance obtained contains the elements of two molecules of water less , =C68 H82I2N4O10 , 4HI ; whilst if the mixture be rapidly j boiled , so that by evaporation the boiling-point rises to 130 ' and upwards , i the ultimate product contains less oxygen than this last body , being Ce8 H8212 N4 06 , 4HI .
These three formulae might each be halved ; but inasmuch as compounds containing not less than C68 have been got from these products by simple treatments , the higher formulae are more probable .
All three substances are , while moist , colourless tars , drying at 100 ' to brittle waxy-looking masses , not fusing at 100 ' when perfectly dry ; they are soluble in hot water , a decomposition being thereby produced ; while moist they appear to absorb oxygen with avidity , rapidly becoming yellow or orange .
They are also extremely hygroscopic ; and from the high percentage of iodine contained , the ease with which they decompose on heating , and the difficultly combustible carbon left , their analysis is a matter of some considerable difficulty .
From all these circumstances combined , the numbers obtained do not always accord quite as closely as might be expected in the case of crystalline and easily purified substances .
To obtain the compound C68 H8612 N4 012 , 4HI , 10 parts of codeia , 30 of 55 per cent , hydriodic acid , and 1 of phosphorus may be heated on the water-bath for three to four hours , at the end of which time the evolution of methyl iodide has entirely ceased : by filtering the syrupy hot liquid through asbestos to separate particles of amorphous phosphorus and addition of a little water when cold , a colourless tar is precipitated , which soon sets to a hard brittle mass ; this is broken up and thoroughly washed with water to separate the phosphorus acids produced simultaneously , and finally freed from moisture as far as possible by pressure between filter paper , and dried at 100 ' .
The same body may also be obtained by dissolving the original substance in slightly warm water , precipitating with sodium carbonate , and extraction of the mass thus thrown down with ether and agitation of the first portions of the ether extract with hydriodic acid : the tar thus got is identical in all respects with the original substance .
After drying at 100 ' the following numbers were obtained* ( A ) Prepared by first method : 0'3785 grm. gave 0*588 COa and 0*173 H2 O. 0*359 grm. gave 0*2535 Agl .

42*70 4*99 38*41 The falling short in the percentage of iodine found in these specimens is readily accounted for by the action of the water which necessarily adheres to the tarry product got by either of the above processes ; it will be subsequently shown that by the action of water on this body the elements of HI are removed from it .

The iodine thus set free is of course reconverted into HI by the action of the phosphorus , a mixture of phosphorous and phosphoric acids being thereby produced .
The reaction 3Ia-f Pa+6Ha0=2H3P03+6HI requires for 50 grms. of codeia 3*45 grms. of phosphorus to be converted into phosphorous acid ; whilst the equation 5Ia+Pa+8H20=2H3P04+8HI requires 2*07 grms. to be converted into phosphoric acid .
In one experiment 2*8 grms. of phosphorus , as nearly as could be estimated , were found to have become converted into the mixture of the two acids , 50 grms. of codeia having been employed .
On attempting to procure the free base C68 Hge Ia Na 0la from the hydriodate got as above , by precipitation with sodium carbonate , a snow-white mass was obtained containing , besides a small quantity of the desired base ( soluble in ether ) , a large quantity of two other bases derived from this one ( but sparingly soluble in ether ) .
The description of the products thus got will be given in a subsequent section .

If codeia , hydriodic acid ( 3 to 5 parts ) , and phosphorus be heated to rapid ebullition , so that most of the aqueous portion distils off along with the CH31 formed , the boiling-point gradually rises to 130 ' , or a little above , at which temperature the colourless liquid begins again to become slightly brown : on precipitation of the filtered product with water \amp ; c. , as before , the following numbers were obtained after drying at 100 ' Specimen A. 0*3575 grm. gave 0*589 C02 and 0*168 H20 .

are obtained containing more C and H , and less I , than the original substance .
By repeating this treatment several times successively , the same ultimate compound appears to be produced in each case , being apparently formed by the reactions C68 H86I2 N4 012,4HI=2HI + 2H2 0+C68 H80 N4 O10 , 4HI , Cea Hga I2 N4O10 , 4HI = 2HI +C69H80N4O10,4HI .
The removal of the last traces of basic HI is very difficult ; it may be accelerated by adding a few drops of sodium carbonate to the boiling solution and filtering hot from the small amount of precipitated base ; the product is apt , however , to be more strongly yellow-coloured when ob-i tained in this way than when got by treatment with water alone .

Both the final and intermediate products have a very curious structure under the microscope ; although they simulate in a high degree the appearance of crystals as they separate from a hot aqueous solution , yet on microscopic examination they are found to consist of strings of coalesced globules not unlike the yeast-plant .
In qualitative reactions all the bodies hitherto described are very similar : ferric chloride gives no coloration to the aqueous solution of the hydriodate ; silver nitrate is reduced on standing , producing a yellow tint ; nitric acid gives an intense yellow ; sulphuric acid and potassium dichromate only separate iodine j sodium carbonate throws down a white precipitate scarcely soluble in excess , and soon becoming yellow , salmon-colour , and finally dark brown ; ammonia gives a similar precipitate somewhat more soluble in excess , while caustic potash readily dissolves the white precipitate first formed .
In many of these reactions this group of codeia derivatives utterly differs from the bodies got by the action of HC1 or HBr ; most of these latter derivatives give colours with ferric chloride and sulphuric acid and dichromate ; all give a blood-red with nitric acid , while the free bases turn more or less green by exposure to air .
On similarly treating with boiling water the compound C68 H8212 N4 0 " , 4 HI , 1871.1 History of the Opium Alkaloids .
formed by the action of hydriodic acid on codeia at about 130 ' , a substance similar in characters to that got from the other two compounds is produced .
The final product , however , differs somewhat in its physical characters from those just mentioned ; instead of coming out from the hot aqueous solution in solid flakes , it appears in very minute solid oil-globules which do not readily subside , and give to the liquid a great resemblance to fresh milk ; sometimes the globules do not subside for many days .
Dried at 100 ' these globules give numbers indicating a compound analogous to that of the non-iodized base just described ; it is , however , much more difficult in this instance to remove the last portions of basic HI ; moreover , four molecules of water appear to be taken up , probably in lieu of the oxygen lost .

Action of Sodium Carbonate on the compound C68 H89 Ia N4 012 , 4 HI .
On adding sodium carbonate to the scarcely warm aqueous solution of Dr. C. E. A. Wright 's Contributions to the [ Nov. 16 , this compound a voluminous white precipitate is produced , which is apparently a mixture of three bases , two of which contain iodine , whilst the third is free from that ingredient .
The first one , which forms only a small fraction of the whole , is the free base of the original compound , C68 H8612 N4 012 ; this is readily soluble in ether , and may be obtained as hydriodate ( as previously stated ) by digesting the precipitate with ether , and agitation of the extract with hydriodic acid , whereby the original substance is reproduced .
To prevent frothing , the precipitate must be well drained from the aqueous portion .
By continuing the extraction until some 6 litres of ether have been employed for exhausting the precipitate from 40 grms. of original substance , the whole of this base is removed , or nearly so .
Attempts to prepare the base itself by evaporation of the ether yielded only a tarry substance which could not be removed from the vessel employed ; treatment with water or alcohol more or less decomposes it .
By employing a large bulk of ether after this first base has been almost wholly removed , an extract is obtained from which on evaporation solid flakes separate ; these are much less soluble in ether than the first base , and after drying at 100 ' gave the following numbers , indicating the formula C68H81IN4O10:- 0*1985 grm. gave .0*4705 C02 and 0*119 H2 O. 0*1210 grm. gave 0*0260 Agl .

Evidently a slight loss of iodine has occurred from the action of the adhering moisture while drying , as the original flakes contained rather too high a percentage of iodine .
'Phis base is formed from the original one by the reaction C68 H86 I2 N4 012,4HI=2H2 0 + HI+C68 H8l IN4 O10,4HI , identical with that taking place on treatment with water .
A portion of the substance left after extraction with ether was treated several times successively with large bulks of ether ( about 4 litres of ether to 10 grms. of precipitate each extraction ) .
After the majority of the substance had thus been dissolved , a portion of the last ether extracts was evaporated down and yielded flakes agreeing approximately with the composition required for a mixture of one molecule of C68 H81IN4 O10 , and two molecules of C68 H80 N4 O10 .

6*96 7*39 I ... ... ... ... ... ... 3*67 3*66 3*73 From the foregoing experiments it is clear that the action of sodium carbonate on the compound C68 H8812N4 012,4HI is identical with that of water described in S 2 , the two bases C63 H81IN4O10 and C68H80N4Olc being the principal products .
On precipitating in a similar way the compound Cg8 H8212 N4 O10,4HI , the same reaction appears to take place ; from the precipitate ether extracts only traces at first , indicating probably that the base C68 H8JI2 N4 O10 is not produced in any quantity , as apparently the more highly iodizad bases are more soluble in ether .
On treating the compound C881I8212 N406,4HI in the same way , an analogous reaction seems to ensue ; the precipitate is very sparingly soluble in ether , and on treatment with hydriodic acid furnished a hydriodate of which 0*233 grm. dried at 100 ' gave 0*142 Agl : hence 1=32*94 per cent. ; the compound C68H83N2O10,4HI requires 31*13 per cent. , whilst the original substance requires 40*53 per cent. S 4 , Action of Hydriodic Acid on some of the foregoing Substances .
As the action of water on the three compounds first described is to remove the elements of HI associated with the carbon radicals of the bases , it was thought probable that by treating the products of the action of water on these compounds with strong boiling hydriodic acid , the HI thus lost might be again added on .
A reaction of this nature does indeed take place , but does not always stop at the reproduction of the original bodies , another VOL. XX , C Dr. C. It .

On treating the compound Ce8 H80 N4 O10,4HI with about ten parts of 55 per cent , of hydriodic acid ( a little piece of phosphorus being also added to prevent separation of iodine from the HI by the heat ) and heating to boiling , a syrupy liquid is obtained , from which water precipitates ( after filtration from phosphorus ) a tar resembling in all its physical characters the compound C68 H^ , , I2 N4 Oj2,4HI ; it contains , however , the elements of HI+10H2O more than this substance .

It is not easy to explain why the reaction should stop short at the end of the first stage , when codeia is treated with hydriodic acid and boiled up to 130 ' ; possibly the presence of a much larger quantity of phosphorus acids in this case may tend to prevent the second reaction ensuing .

Discussion of the foregoing Results , From the complex constitution of the substances described above , it is at present thought unadvisable to attempt to give names to them .
On the History of the Opium Alkaloids .
[ Nov. 16 , All the bodies previously mentioned may be regarded as being derived from one or other of the two bases C17 H2l N03 and C17 H21 N02 by multiplication of the molecule , and addition or subtraction of the elements of water and of hydriodic acid .
These two ( hypothetical ) bases contain H2 more than morphia and de-oxymorphia respectively ; denoting the first by the symbol X , and the second by Y , the following general formulae will indicate all the compounds previously described:\#151 ; 4X+wHI+\#187 ; H20 , 4Y+mHI\#177 ; \#171 ; HaO . .

Although it may well happen that further researches may show that some of the above formulae require some slight correction , the analytical numbers hot always agreeing together absolutely accurately , yet the following points may be considered established:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The action of hydriodic acid on codeia polymerizes it , the ultimate compounds formed being derived from at least four molecules of codeia .
Hydrobromic acid also polymerizes codeia , but not so completely as hydriodic acid , there being formed , in addition to the tetra-bases , compounds which ( from their crystalline character and other physical properties ) are apparently derived from one molecule only of codeia .
Hydrochloric acid does not appear to have a marked polymerizing effect on codeia .
( 2 ) Hydriodic , hydrobromic , and hydrochloric acids all eliminate methyl from codeia , forming ultimately compounds containing wC17 .

21 I phosphorus indicate that the carbon groups contained in codeia are in an I eminently " unsaturated " condition , being capable of taking up several molecules of HI and of HaO , forming compounds not decomposed at 100 ' , 2 equivalents of hydrogen for every C17 being also added on in every case .

" On a Periodic Change of the Elements of the Force of Terrestrial Magnetism discovered by Professor Hornstein .
" Communicated by the Foreign Secretary .
Received July 1871 .
[ From the Anzeiger der k. Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien for June 15 , 1871 .
] Professor Hornstein , of Prague , has communicated to the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Vienna a paper entitled " On the dependence of the ' Earth 's Magnetism on the Rotation of the Sun .
" He shows that the changes of each of the three elements of the force of terrestrial magnetism ( declination , inclination , and horizontal force ) indicate a period of 26^ days .
The periodic change of declination for Prague ( 1870 ) amounts to 0*705 sin ( j ?
+190 ' 20r ) , where #=0 ' at the commencement of 1870 , and a ?
=360 ' at the commencement of 1871 .
For Vienna the range is a little larger .
The range of inclination is nearly one-third of that of declination , that of the intensity nearly 24 units of the 4th decimal ( the intensity in June 1870 was nearly 2*0485 ) .
Professor Hornstein regards these changes of the earth 's magnetism as the effect of the sun 's rotation , and by a mean of several determinations finds for the duration of the period 26*33 days .
This number may con- , sequently be regarded as the result of the first attempt to determine the synodic period of the sun 's rotation by means of the magnetic needle .
The resulting true periodic time of the sun 's rotation is 24*55 days , almost exactly agreeing with the time of rotation of the sun-spots in the .
sun 's equator deduced from astronomical observations ( according to Sporer 24*541 days ) .

" Corrections to the Computed Lengths of Waves of Light published in the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1868 .
" By George Biddell Airy , C.B./ Astronomer Royal .
Received October 2 , 1871 .
( Abstract .
) The author , after adverting to the process by which in a former paper he had attempted the computation of the Lengths of Waves of Light , for the entire series measured in the Solar Spectrum by Kirchhoff , from a limited number of measured Wave-Lengths , and to the discordances between the results of these computations and the actual measure of numerous wavelengths to which he subsequently had access , calls attention to his remark that means existed for giving accuracy to the whole .
The object of the present paper is so to use these means as to produce a table of corrections
