( Abstract .
) These experiments are a continuation of those described in a paper read February 22 , 1866 , with some modifications in the apparatus employed which render the comparison between torsion and flexure more direct .
The amount of torsion or flexure produced by subjecting a cylindrical rod to a uniform couple throughout its whole length , is measured by means of two mirrors clamped to the rod near its ends , in which , by the aid of two telescopes , the reflexions of a scale overhead are seen and the displacements read off .
One end of the rod is fixed , and a couple ( of torsion and flexure alternately ) is applied to the other end .
Three rods , of glass , brass , and steel , were experimented on , and the results obtained were as follows-M , n , and I denoting the resistances ( in kilogrammes per square millimetre ) to linear extension , shearing , and cubical compression respectively , and odenoting the ratio of lateral contraction to longitudinal extension : Glass .

The following communications were read : I. " On the Relation of Insolation to Atmospheric Humidity .
" By J. PARK HAIRRIsON , M.A. Communicated by the President .
Received January 30 , 1867 .
The occurrence of the maxima of insolation on days of grent relative humidity which was noticed by Herr v. Schlagintweit in India* , receives confirmation from the fact that the post-solstitial periods of maximum solar radiation in autumn , and also the diurnal maxima , coincide with monthly and daily periods of maximum lumidity .
It is proposed to show the extent to which this is the case in England by means of Tables of monthly results of radiation and vapour .
The first Table exhibits the mean monthly values of solar radiation and vapour-tension for the five months from May to September , at Greenwich , in 1860-64* .

The excess of insolation in July is 5 ?

The excess of vapour-tension in the two months is -030 .
To obtain results more exactly comparable , the monthly mean tension of vapour for each of the five months was next deduced at the hours of noon , 2 P.M. , and 4 P.M. , for the years 1842-47 , during which two-hourly observations were made at the Royal Observatory .
In Table II .

In those cases where the values of radiation and vapour do not agree , the exceptions will , it is believed , be sufficiently accounted for ; thus the occurrence of the second maximum of solar radiation in September 1843 in place of July , though tension was higher in the latter month , is explained by the obscuration of the sun , and the unusual quantity of rain in July .
The tension of vapour in September was *06 higher than in June+ .
Heat and Vapour in Canada.-The dependence of the maximum temperature in the day on the quantity of moisture in the air , in winter , at Toronto , though not directly connected with the present inquiry , is closely allied to it , and may be referred to with advantage in the absence of observations of solar radiation , to show the effects of slight variations of vapour in that country .
General ( at that time Colonel ) Sabine , in a paper in the Transactions of the Royal Society " On the Periodic and Non-Periodic Variations of Temperature at Toronto " ?
, pointed out the fact that the period of minimum heat in the year , both hourly and daily , at that station occurs between the 7th and 17th days of February , on the days when vapour is also at its minimum .
The means of temperature and tension on the ten days alluded to are respectively 21 ?
'7 and '098 , as deduced from the hourly observations which were taken in 1842-48 at the Ordnance Office .
The mean readings of the standard thermometer at 2 P.M. ( the warmest hour in the winter at Toronto ) and the contemporaneous mean tensions of vapour , in January and February , are exhibited in Table IV .

Postmeridian maxima of solar radiation.-Though , it is well known at observatories , the hour of mean maximum solar heat occurs in this country after midday , there is no numerical proof of the fact available , excepting the results of six days ' observations by Professor Daniell .
From experiments made by him in June ( 1822 ) at every hour between 9 " 30 " A.M. and 7h 30m P.M. , the mean highest readings of a black-bulb thermometer were obtained between Ih 30 " ' and 2h .
The following are the means for five days:h mn At 10 30 ... .

63 1 30 ... .

63 It may be assumed , then , that on days when the sun is shining both in the morning and afternoon , solar radiation is of highest apparent force after 0h .
Daily maxima of vapour.-The means of vapour-tension have been deduced at 10h A.M. , noon , and 2h from the bi-horaryobservations at Greenwich in 1842-47 ; the following Table , which contains the monthly results for each of these hours , shows that the means at 21 are higher than those at 10 " A.M. , or at noon , in every month from March to September : : From Tables LV .
, LVIII .

The maxima of heat and vapour occur at Toronto in July and August , vapour-tension at 2h in July being,069 higher , and in August -108 higher than in June .

On another favourable day in June , Professor Daniell obtained the following results with a solar thermometer covered with black wool:-at 10 A.M. 111 ?
; at noon 129 ?
; at 2h P.r1 .

In six of the months the mean increase is in each case '003jf .
The results a3cord with the assumed date of maximum radiation .
Actinometer-observations.-The observations of the actinometer made by Mr. Nash at the Royal Observatory in 1864 supply further evidence of the fact that the maxima of radiation occur in the autumn , and after 01 .
I have extracted the mean results of the several groups of observations which were taken at or near the same elevation of the sun , in the months of August and September in autumn , and in the months of March and April in spring , and find that the value of the mean increase of the scalereadings in the autumn is about 100 per cent. greater than in the spring+ .
The mean increase of the scale-readings in March and April is 19'4 .
The mean increase of the scale-readings in August and September is 39'6 .
The difference is 20'2 , at the same mean altitude of the sun .

The great accordance between the foregoing results renders it unnecessary to adduce further evidence of the occurrence of maximum insolation some considerable time after the summer solstice and after 51 .
Increased solar radiation supposed to be due to the action of aqieous vapour.-Herr von Schlagintweit , applying Professor Tyndall 's discovery of the absorptive properties of aqueous vapour to the phenomenon of insolation , attributed the high readings of his solar thermometer , in certain parts of India , to the fact that air , when highly charged with moisture , impedes free radiation ; that is to say , the air restores to the instrument some portion of the heat which has been radiated off from it .
A like cause has been recently assigned for the variations in temperature which take place on clear nights in Madras under different tensions of va* Compare observations on the same day at Oh 28m and 0 " 14"1 .
pour , those nights being considered clear in which the percentage of cloud did not exceed ?
10 .
It was found , on a careful tabulation of hourly observations , that the fall in temperature was decidedly greater when the quantity of vapour was relatively smallV .
Cloud , haze , and opalescence t of the atmosphere more probably the principal cause of the phenomenon.-It appeared of much importance to ascertain whether the presence of cloud , and the imperfect state of transparency in the sky which usually accompanies it , may not have materially assisted in producing the results alluded to in the last paragraph , and , i fortiori , account for the increased insolation noticed in cloudy weather in v'arious parts of India-e .
g. " on days in the rainy season when the clouds are temporarily broken , " and , as in Sikkim , " when a break in the clouds of an hour or two had to be watched for to obtain observations of solar radiation " ( Schlagintweit , 'Meteorology of India , ' pp. 49 &amp; 51 ) .
To test this point , the results of the observations for the four years ending 1844 , over which the inquiry at Madras extended , were divided into groups of contemporaneous observations of temperature , vapour-tension , and percentage of clear sky , when the mean numerical results showed that a progressive fall of about 10 F. for every ?
10 of vapour-tension was accompanied by a proportionate increase in the percentage of clear sky , -a result which is the more significant when it is considered that the infusion of visible cloud was limited to '10 .
To prevent mistake , the fall in temperature on the nights of maximum clearness was compared with the fall on nights of minimum clearness within the limits above stated .
There were twenty-five nights which were estimated to be perfectly clear , and twenty-two nights when the per .
centage of clear sky ranged from '90 to 93 , the average being -915 ( 1 000 representing an entirely clear sky ) .
The results were as follows The mean fall of temperature at an estimated clearness of sky denoted by 1-000 was 8 ?
-3 F. The mean fall of temperature at an estimated clearness denoted by *915 was 6 ?
F. The difference is 2 ?
'3 .
The contemporaneous mean tensions of vapour were -68 and -83 respectively .
It is probable then , as cloud accompanies humidity , that tension of vapour gives some indication of the state of transparency of the shy , whilst affording a measure of the quantity of invisible vapour in the air .
In any case it is sufficiently clear , both from the results at Madras'and from the slight increase in the tension at 2h P.M. , that the amount of aqueous vapour alone is not sufficient to account for increased or diminished solar radiation .
Phil. Mag. October 1866 ; where see Tables and method of deduction .
t This term was first used by Professor Roscoe .
It here represents the state of the atmosphere at the moment vapour is in process of condensation previously to its formation into cloud .
The explanation of the phenomenon of the maxima of insolation occurring on days of great relative humidity in India , however , which has been already alluded to , applies with increased force to the absorptive properties of visible moisture ; and the known action of even the lightest form of cloud in radiating heat to the earth , would point to this as the principal cause of the phenomenon , though it cannot be doubted that some of the effect is due to the action of invisible vapour , whether as warmed directly by the solar rays , or by heat derived from a secondary source .
The dependence of terrestrial heat on vapour and cloud.-It was to increased or diminished radiation under a clear or clouded sky that the inflections of the curves of mean temperature , which I communicated to the Royal Society in May 1865 , were ascribed* .
The effects produced were on that occasion considered to be principally due to radiation at night t ; but an examination of the daily means proved that a similar action occurred also by day + , the phenomenon in fact depending , as in the case of solar radiation , on the quantity of moisture in the air .
The precise values of heat resulting from the action and reaction of solar radiation and vapour cannot be ascertained until mean numerical values have been deduced from a sufficient number of hourly observations to afford trustworthy data for determination .
The present paper merely helps to establish a relation between solar radiation and humidity , and suggests an additional cause for the effects which appear to follow from it .

At Fort Franklin , Sir John Richardson found that the maximum of solar radiation was obtained in the spring and at noon .
Mr. Forbes accounted for this by the fact that the sun 's rays were reflected from the snow , and thus the bulb of the thermometers received reflected as well as direct rays of sunshine .
