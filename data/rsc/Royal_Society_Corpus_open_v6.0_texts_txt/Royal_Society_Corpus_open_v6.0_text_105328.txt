The Invention of a General Method for determining the Sum of every 2d , 3d , 4th , or 5th , &amp;c. Term of a Series , taken in order ; the Sum of the whole Series being known .
By Thomas Simpson , F. R. S. AS the doctrine of Series ' is of very great use in the higher branches of the mathematics , and their application to nature , every attempt tending to extend that doctrine may justly merit some degree of regard .
The subject of the paper , which I have now the honour to lay before the Society , will be found an improvement of some consequence in that part of science .
And how far the business of finding fluents may , in some cases , be facilitated thereby , will appear from the examples subjoined , in illustration of the general method here delivered .

The series propounded , whose sum ( S ) is supposed to be given ( either in algebraic terms , or by the measures of angles and ratio 's , &amp;c. ) I shall here represent by a+ bx + cx2 + dx3 + ex4 , &amp;c. and shall first give the solution of that case , where every third term is required to be taken , or where the series to be summed is a+ dx3 +g x6 + kx6 , &amp;c. By means whereof , the general method of proceeding , and the resolution of every other case , will appear evident .
Here , then , every third term being required to be taken , let the series ( a + dx3 + gx6 , &amp;c. ) , whose value is sought , be conceived to be composed of three others .
~xa+bx ~px +cx ~px2 +dx ~px3 +ex ~px4 , &amp; c ~xa+bx ~qx +cx ~qx2 +dx ~qx3 +ex ~qx4 , &amp;c. 1/ 3 xa+bx ~rx +cx ~rx2 +dx ~rx3 +ex ~rx4 , &amp;c. having all the same form , and the same coefficients with the series first proposed , and wherein the converging quantities px , qx , rx , are also in a determinate ( tho ' yet unknown ) ratio to the original converging quantity x. Now , in order to determine the quantities of these ratios , or the values of p , q , and r , let the terms containing the same powers of x , in the two equal values , be equated in the common way : So shall , 1/ 3 bx px + 1/ 3 bx qx + 1/ 3 bx rx =0 1/ 3 cx p2x2 + 1/ 3 cx q2x2 + 1/ 3 cx r2x2 =0 1/ 3 dx p3x3 + 1/ 3 dx q3x3 + 1/ 3 dx r3x3 = dx3 1/ 3 ex p4x4 + 1/ 3 ex q4x4 + 1/ 3 ex r4x4 =0 &amp;c. And consequently , p+q+r=0 p2 + q2 + r2 =0 p3 + q3 + r3 =3 p4 + q4 + r4 = 0 , &amp;c. Make , now , p3 = 1 , q3 = 1 , and r3 = 1 ; that is , let p , q , and r , be the three roots of the cubic equation z3 = 1 , or z3 1= 0 : then , seeing both the second and third terms of this equation are wanting , not only the sum of all the roots ( p +q+ r ) but the sum of all their squares ( p2 + q2 + r2 ) will vanish , or be equal to nothing ( by common algebra ) , as they ought , to fulfil the conditions of the two first equations .
Moreover , since p3 = 1 , q3 = 1 , and r3 = 1 , it is also evident , that p4 + q4 + r4 ( = p+q + r ) = 0 , p5 + q5 + r5 ( = p2 + q2 + r2 ) = 0 , p6 + q6 + r6 ( = p3 + q3 + r3 ) = 3 .
Which equations being , in effect , nothing more than the first three repeated , the values of p , q , r , above assigned , equally fulfil the conditions of these also : so that the series arising from the addition of three assumed ones will agree , in every term , with that whose sum is required : but those series ' ( whereof the quantity in question is composed ) having all of them the same form and the same cofficients with the original series a+ bx + cx2 + dx3 , &amp;c. ( = S ) , their sums will therefore be truly obtained , by substituting px , qx , and rx , successively , for x , in the given value of S. And , by the very same reasoning , and the process above laid down , it is evident , that , if every nth term ( instead of every third term ) of the given series be taken , the values of p , q , r , s , &amp;c. will then be the roots of the equation zn 1=0 * ; and that , the * If ~ , ~ , ~ , ~ , &amp;c. be supposed to represent the co-sines of the angles 360~/ n , 2x 360~/ n , 3x 360~/ n , &amp;c. ( the radius being unity ) ; then the roots of the equation zn 1=0 ( expressing the several values of p , q , r , s , &amp;c. ) will be truly defined by 1 , ~+~ ~~ 1 , ~~ ~~ 1 , ~+~ ~~ 1 , ~~ ~~ 1 , &amp;c. The demonstration of this will be given farther on .
sum of all the terms so taken , will be truly obtained by substituting px , qx , rx , sx , &amp;c. successively for x , in the given value of S , and then dividing the sum of all the quantities thence arising by the given number n. The same method of solution holds equally , when , in taking every nth term of the series , the operation begins at some term after the first .
For all the terms preceding that may be transposed , and the whole equation divided by the power of x in the first of the remaining terms ; and then the sum of every nth term ( beginning at the first ) will be found by the proceding directions ; which sum , multiplied by the power of x that before divided , will evidently give the true value required to be determined .
Thus , for example , let it be required to find the sum of every third term of the given series a+ bx + cx2 + dx3 + ex4 , &amp;c. ( = S ) , beginning with cx2 .
Then , by transposing the two first terms , and dividing the whole by x2 , we shall have c+ dx + ex2 + fx3 , &amp;c. = Sa bx/ xx ( = S ' ) .
From whence having found the sum of every third term of the series c+ dx + ex2 + fx3 , &amp;c. beginning at the first ( c ) , that sum , multiplied by x2 , will manifestly give the true value sought in the present case .
And here it may be worth while to observe , that all the terms preceding that at which the operation ( in any case ) begins , may ( provided they exceed not in number the given interval n ) be entirely disregarded , regarded , as having no effect at all in the result .
For if in that part ( a bx/ xx ) of the value of S ' ' , above exhibited , in which the first terms , a and bx , enter , there be substituted px , qx , rx , successively , for x ( according to the prescript ) the sum of the quantities thence arising will be a/ p2x2 a/ q2x2 a/ r2x2 b/ px b/ qx b/ rx which , because p3 = 1 , q3 = 1 , &amp;c. ( or p2 =~ q2 = 1/ q , &amp;c. ) may be expressed thus ; a/ xx xp+q+r b/ x x p2 + q2 + r2 But , that p+q+r= 0 , and p2 + q2 + r2 = 0 , hath been already shown ; whence the truth of the general observation is manifest .
Hence it also appears , that the method of solution above delivered , is not only general , but includes this singular beauty and advantage , that in all series ' whatever , whereof the terms are to be taken according to the same assigned order , the quantities ( p , q , r , &amp;c. ) , whereby the resolution is performed , will remain invariably the same .
The greater part of these quantities are indeed imaginary ones ; and so likewise will the quantities be that result from them , when substitution is made in the given expression for the value of S. But by adding , as is usual in like cases , every two corresponding vaV O L. 50 .
5E lues , lues , so resulting together , all marks of impossibility will disappear .
If , in the series to be summed , the alternate terms ( viz. the 2d , 4th , 6th , &amp;c. ) should be required to be taken under signs contrary to what they have in the original series given ; the reasoning and result will be no-ways different ; only , instead of making p3 + q3 + r3 ( or pn + qn + rn , &amp;c. ) =+3 ( or + n ) , the same quantity must , here , be made =3 ( or n ) .
From whence , pn being = 1 , qn = 1 , &amp;c. the values of p , q , r , &amp;c. will , in this case , be the roots of the equation zn +1= 0 .
It may be proper , now , to put down an example , or two , of the use and application of the general conclusions above derived .
First , then , supposing the series , whose sum is given , to be x+ x2/ 2 + x3/ 3 + x4/ 4 ... . .
+ xm/ m + xm + 1/ m +1+ xm + 2/ m + 2 ... .
+ xm + n/ m +n+ xm +n+ 1/ m +n+1 + , &amp;c. = H. Log. 1x ( = S ) ; let it be required , from hence , to find the sum of the ( mx/ m + xm + n/ m +n+ xm + 2n/ m 2n &amp;c. ) arising by taking every nth term thereof , beginning with that whose exponent ( m ) is any integer less than n. Here , the terms preceding xm/ m being transposed , and the whole equation divided by xm , we shall have 1/ m + x/ m +1+ x2/ m +2+ x3/ m + 3 , &amp;c. = 1/ xm x H. Log. 1xx+ 1/ 2 x2 , &amp;c. / xm .
In which value , let px , qx , rx , &amp;c. be , successively , substituted for x ( according to prescript ) neglecting entirely the terms x+ 1/ 2 x2/ xm , as having no effect at all in the result : from whence we get 1/ pxn x Log. 1 px 1/ qxn x Log. 1 qx 1/ rxm x Log. 1 rx , &amp;c. Which multiplied by xm ( the quantity that before divided ) gives 1/ pm x Log. 1 px 1/ q~ x Log. 1 qx 1/ rm x Log. 1 rx , &amp;c. = n times the quantity required to be determined .
But now , to get rid of the imaginary quantities q , r , &amp;c. by means of their known values ~+~ ~~ 1 , ~~ ~~ 1 , &amp;c. it will be necessary to observe , that , as the product of any two corresponding ones ( ~ +~ ~~ 1x~~ ~~ 1 ) is equal to unity , we may therefore write ~~ ~~ 1m ( = rm ) instead of its equal 1/ qm , and ~+~ ~~ 1m ( = qm ) instead of its equal 1/ rm : by which means the two terms , wherein these two quantities enter , will stand thus ; ~~~~1~nx Log. ~1 ~q x ~+~~~1~mx Log. ~1 ~r x. But , if A be assumed to express the co-sine of an arch ( Q ) , m times as great as that ( 360~/ n ) whose cosine is here denoted by ~ ; then will A~AA1 =*~~~~1~ m , and A+~AA1= * Because x~/ ~1 xx and X~/ ~1 XX are known to express the fluxions of the circular arcs whose co-sines are x and X , it is evident , if those arcs be supposed in any constant ratio of 1 to n , that n x~/ ~1 xx= X~/ ~1 XX , and consequently that n x~/ ~x x1 ( = n x~/ ~1 x ~1 xx = X~/ ~1 x ~1 XX ) = X~/ ~XX 1~ From whence , by taking the fluents , nx Log. x+~xx1 ( or Log. x+~xx1 ~n ) = Log. X+~XX 1 ; and consequently x+~xx1 ~n =X+~XX 1 : whence also , seeing x~xx1 is the reciprocal of x+~xx 1 , and X~XX1 of X+ ~XX 1 , it is likewise evident , that x~ xx 1 ~n =X~ XX 1 .
Hence , not only the truth of the above assumption , but what has been advanced in relation to the roots of the equation zn 1= 0 , will appear manifest .
For if x~~ xx 1 be put = z , then will zn ( = x~~ xx 1 ~n ) =X~~XX 1 : where , assuming X=1= co~s .
o= co-s .
360~ = co-s .
2x 360~ = co-s .
3x 360~ , ~c .
the equation will become zn = 1 , or zn 1= 0 ; and the different values of x , in the expression ( x ~~ xx 1 ) for the root z , will consequently be the co-sines of the arcs , 0/ n , 360~/ n , 2x 360~/ ~ , ~c .
these arcs being ~+~ ~~ 1 ~m : which values being substituted above , we thence get Ax log .
1qx+ log .
1rx +~AA1x log .
1qx log .
1r x ; whereof the former part ( which , exclusive of the factor A , I shall hereafter denote by M ) is manifestly equal to Ax log .
1qxx1rx ( by the nature of logarithms ) =Ax log .
1q+ r.x + qr x2 =Ax log .
12~x+xx ( by substituting the values of q and r ) : which is now entirely free from imaginary quantities .
But , in order to exterminate them out of the latter part also , put y= log .
1qx log .
1r x ; then will y=q x/ 1 qx +r x/ 1 rx=qrx x/ 1 q+rxx+ xx =2~~~1x x/ 1 2~x+xx =2~1X~1~~X x/ 1 2~x+x x ; where ~1~~X ~/ 1 2~x+xx expresses the fluxion of a circular arch ( N ) whose radius is 1 , and sine =~1~~X x/ 1 2~x+x x ; consequently y will be =2~1X N : which , multiplied by ~AA 1 , or its equal ~1X~1A A , gives 2~1AAX N ; the corresponding submultiples of those above , answering to the cosine X ( = 1 ) .
In the same manner , if X be taken =1= co-s .
180~ = co-s .
3X 180~ = co-s .
5X 180~ , &amp;c. then will zn = 1 , or zn +1= 0 ; and the values of x will , in this case , be the co-sines of 180~/ n , 3X 180~/ n , 5X 180~/ n , &amp;c. and , this value being added to that of the former part ( found above ) , and the whole being divided by n , we thence obtain AM+ 2~ 1AAX N/ n , or 1/ n X co-s .
QXM+ sin. QX2N for that part of the value sought depending on the two terms affected with q and r. From whence the sum of any other two corresponding terms will be had , by barely substituting one letter , or value , for another : So that , log .
1x co-s .
QXM+ sin. QX2N 1/ n X co-s .
Q~ X M~ + sin. Q~ X2 N~ co-s .
Q~ X M~ + sin. Q~ X2 N~ &amp;c. + &amp;c. will truly express the sum of the series proposed to be determined ; M , M~ , M~ &amp;c. being the hyperbolical logarithms of 12~x+x x , 12~x+x x , 12~x+x x , &amp;c. N , N~ , N~ &amp;c. the arcs whose sines are x~1~ ~/ ~ 12~x+x x , x~1~ ~/ ~ 12~x+x x , x~1~ ~/ ~ 12~x+x x , &amp;c. and Q , Q~ , Q~ &amp;c. the measures of the angles expressed by 360~/ n X m , 2X 360/ n X m , 3X 360/ n X m , &amp;c. And here it may not be amiss to take notice , that the series xm/ m + xm + n/ m +n+ xm +2 n/ m +2n+ &amp;c. thus determined , is that expressing the fluent of xm 1 x/ 1 xn ; corresponding to one of the two famous Cotesian forms .
From whence , and the reasoning above laid down , the fluent of the other form , x m-1 x/ 1 +x n , may be very readily deduced .
For , since the series ( x m/ m xm+ n/ m +n+xm+2 n/ m + 2n xm+3 n/ m +3n &amp;c. ) for this last fluent , is that which arises by changing the signs of the alternate terms of the former ; the quantities p , q , r , &amp;c. will here ( agreeably to a preceding observation ) be the roots of the equation Zn+1= 0 ; and , consequently , ~ , ~ , ~ , ~ , &amp;c. the co-sines of the arcs 180~/ n , 3x 180~/ n , 5x 180~/ n , &amp;c. ( as appears by the foregoing note ) .
So that , making Q , Q ' , Q ' ' , &amp;c. equal , here , to the measures of the angles 180~/ n x m , 3x 180~/ n x m , 5x 180~/ n x m , &amp;c. the fluent sought will be expressed in the very same manner as in the preceding case ; except that the first term , log .
1x ( arising from the rational root p= 1 ) will here have no place .
After the same manner , with a small increase of trouble , the fluent of xm1 x/ 1 ~2lxn+x 2n may be derived , m and n being any integers whatever .
But I shall now put down one example , wherein the impossible quantities become exponents of the powers , in the terms where they are concerned .
The series here given is 1x+x 2/ 2 x 3/ 2.3 + x 4/ 2.3.4 x 5/ 2.3.4.5 , &amp;c. = the number whose hyp .
log .
is x , and it is required to find the sum of every n th term thereof , beginning at the first .
Here the quantity sought will ( according to the general rule ) be truly defined by the n th part of the sum of all the numbers whose respective logarithms are p x , q x , r x , &amp;c. ; which numbers , if N be taken to denote the number whose hyp .
log .
= 1 , will be truly expressed by N -px , N -qx , N -rx , &amp;c. From whence , by writing for p , q , r , &amp;c. their equals 1 , ~+~~~ 1 , ~~~~ 1 , ~+~~~ 1 , ~~~~ 1 , &amp;c. and putting ~=~1~ ~ , ~=~1~ ~ , &amp;c. we shall have 1/ n xN -px + N -qx +N -rx , &amp;c. = 1/ n into N -x +N -~x x N -~x~-1 +N ~x~-1 +N -~x~-1 + N ~x~-1 + &amp;c. But N -~x~-1 +N ~x~-1 is known to express the double of the co-sine of the arch whose measure ( to the radius 1 ) is ~x .
Therefore we have 1/ n into N -x +N -~x x2 co-s .
~x + N -~x x2 co-s .
~ x , &amp;c. for the true sum , or value proposed to be determined .
The solution of this case , in a manner a little different , I have given some time since , in another place ; where the principles of the general method , here extended and illustrated , are pointed out .
I shall put an end to this paper with observing , that if , in the series given , the even powers of x , or any other terms whatever , be wanting , their places must be supplied with ciphers ; which , in order the of numbering off , must be reckoned as real terms .
